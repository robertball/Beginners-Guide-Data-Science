A very good, easy to follow recipe, and great to make ahead of time! I used a homemade *Puff Pastry* recipe from this site, and skipped the wine sauce (it was part of a big meal already). I loved how you can do it in stages. I stopped after step 2 for about an hour while I cooked something else, and again after step 3 for nearly three hours. Letting the steak sit in the pouches lets them sort of marinate in the mushroom wine juices, which adds real flavor. Finally, don't worry if your beef seems on the small side, once it is topped with mushrooms and wrapped in dough, it is definitely enough to satisfy big appetites!

when i made this, it tasted really good and was pretty fast to make, but the bottom of the puff pastry was all soggy.

I entered this recipe in our local state fair, and won first place in the cooking with beef competition!  These tasted FABULOUS!  That said, there were a couple of changes I had to make.  First, cooking time.  After cooking my test-batch 15 minutes in the oven and letting rest for 5-minutes or so, the steaks were blue in the center.  Warm but raw.  My second batch I cooked for an extra 5 minutes, for a total of 20 minutes in the oven, and after resting for 30-45 minutes (judging takes forever) they were perfect inside.  So I recommend a longer cook time.  Next, the wine reduction sauce was a little too basic for me, so I added in one cup of beef broth.  The resulting sauce (I used a 2009 Ravenswood Zinfandel) complemented the steaks perfectly, and two judges specifically mentioned the sauce was perfect.  We already plan on making this again next month for when my in-laws visit.  Yummy!

Great dish! I use crescent rolls as opposed to pastry puff for a richer and fluffier crust. I have also substitued white onion for the shallot or left the shallot out altogether and both worked wonderfully.

I made this last night and followed the exact recipe.  I made the wine reduction sauce and added a little flour and milk to thicken it up.  It was absolutely delicious.  We both cleaned our plates.  I served this with mashed potatos which went deliciously and used a cream sherry as the wine. I will definitely make this again.

I made this for a dinner party and it was a huge hit.  I was suprised how simple, but elegant this dish was to make.  The only change I made was to add pine nuts to the mushroom mixture.

WOW!  This was amazing!  I was a little concerned about the wine sauce.  I felt it need a bit more and it tasted very acidic so I added sugar to it.  It still seemed off when I tasted it alone, but when I put it on the meat/croute it was fine.  I still have to wonder what else could be done to the sauce as far as making it thicker or adding other spices.

This was very good. I actually made 11 in total so it was a little time intensive. At first I thought it was a little bland, but then I remembered the wine reduction. With that added the flavor was great. The only change I made was to bake them on a rack and I added a teaspoon of better than bullion to the wine reduction. If youâ€™re only making 2 then this would be an easy recipe and a beautiful presentation.

your recipe made it perfect. I did, however, change the wine to a Merlot which has a heavier taste that goes with French-made beef dishes.

Made this for Christmas Day dinner.  My wife said:  "you are officially in charge of Christmas dinner...forever!"  It was  big hit.   Made the wine sauce, then promptly forgot to serve it.  No matter, it was great without.  I added rosemary to the recipe, searing the tenderloins with salt, pepper and rosemary.  Also used a bit of "Spike" seasoning. Served  with Scalloped Potatoes.
