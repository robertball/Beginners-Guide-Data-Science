My 2 year-old and I both loved this rice.  I used a long grain and wild rice mixture, just because I love wild rice.  Also, I used a little more chicken broth than indicated in the recipe, because if you use it in a can, you have 2 oz left over after you put in the 1 1/2 cups in the recipe.  I couldn't bring myself to throw it out, but what are you gonna do with 2 ounces of leftover chicken broth?? Oh, the broth I had in the house was low-sodium, so that's what I used, and it was fine.  This recipe seemed to have a perfect balance of the different flavors.  I definitely wouldn't mess with the amounts of apples, raisins, and especially the garlic, or the balance might be lost.  We'll be making this one often!

I used apple sauce instead of an apple and added 1/2 tsp each cinnamon and cumin.  Turned out great.

The rice was good as a side dish. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly, and there was FAR too much butter. The next time, I used only enough butter necessary to cover the bottom of the pan, and it was a lot better. I would reduce the amount of raisins to somewhere around 1/3 cups. They overpower the dish in terms of aesthetics and in terms of taste when 1/2 cup is used. Next time, I might grate the apple. Overall, a good recipe.

This rice was AWESOME.  My boyfriend and I both loved it.  I will be making this again and again!

I used brown rice, and since the bag called for 2C liquid, I used a whole 16-oz can of chicken broth.  I also didn't have an onion so I subbed 1T onion powder.  My kitchen smelled so good.

This is a nice side dish. No fireworks or drama, just a very good accompaniment to a main course. I had a yellow sweet bell pepper in the fridge that needed to be used so I added about 1/2 cup of it diced to the rest of the ingredients that got sauteed. I have had a similar dish at a restaurant where they add some slivered almonds to the rice as well.

I loved this rice.  After having a busy work week, I was being a bit lazy.  I took 1/4 onion, I peeled and cut up an apple, and the garlic clove, and threw it in the processor.  I then put them into a large microwave safe bowl with the 3 T butter and nuked on high for about a minute until onion was soft.  Added the rice, chicken stock, S&P, and a 1/4 tsp. curry powder. Covered with plastic wrap and vented. Nuked on high for 5 mins, then medium for 15 mins, and let rest for 5 more minutes and fluffed with a fork.  It was perfect.  I left out the raisins (wish I didn't have to) but no one else here likes them but me. Will be making again.

this was a really nice side, but missing something.  Will definitely make again, but will add pine nuts for sure and probably some honey and/or Chinese 5 spice.

Really good! Gentle subdued flavors, a wonderful complement to a stronger main dish. I cooked this exactly as the recipe called for except with extra garlic. A great dish as is but I will definitely experiment with spices! I loved the raisins!

We thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. It went very well with the pork chops with onions and apples that we made. It is a very nice addition to our collection of side dishes, and we look forward to playing around with it in the future.

We thought this was a nice accompaniment to "Honey-Mustard Baked Chicken" from this site. That recipe has a slightly Indian flair to it, and I thought this rice might too. This is a fairly bland side dish, but that was just fine for us as our chicken had a very flavorful sauce. Thanks for the recipe :)

This is so easy and delicious.  I follow the recipe exactly, but I use my rice cooker instead of on the stove.  No fuss, no muss and perfect every time.

Wonderful side dish.  My husband doesn't normally like ricey type dishes went back for seconds!  I added slivered almond along with the other ingredients and the only change I will make next time is to double the recipe!  It went well withe the Apple Butter Pork Loin from this site; however I used a turkey loin instead of pork.

I made this a little differently. I used one generous tablespoon of butter which I sauteed half a large onion, one tart green apple, 2 large cloves of garlic and a heaped third cup of raisins. Sprinkled on 1/3 tsp. of homemade pie seasoning. I cooked this down for about 5 minutes before adding a third cup of NaVan (a vanilla liqueur produced by Grand Marnier) and the remainder water + chicken bouillon cube (I did add roughly another half cup of water as usually the ratio for rice is 1 to 2). Let it come to a boil and added the rice (I used basmati). Despite my changes, it was quite bland- I reduced/boiled some of the marinade from the shrimp main dish I served this with to give this more flavour. Served this with "Grilled Shrimp and Apple Skewers" from AR.

Very, very good!! I did cut down to a 1/4 cup on the raisins though. This is truly a keeper. Compliments the stuffed pork tenderloin recipe by Mary Ann wonderfully.

This was delicious!  Was looking for something different to do with rice that would go well with pork.  This was perfect!  My husband said his mom used to make this dish when he was little and it hadn't had anything like it since.  He's 48!!  He was very excited.  Will definitely be making this many times and recommending to all my friends.

This is my go-to dish at my annual halloween dinner party.  It's such a great mix of fall flavors.  I use mixed wild rice (wild, black, red, and white) and I can't imagine it any other way.  The added texture makes it outstanding.

It doesn't have any complicated steps, and its very impressive to guests.  Highly recommended.

I have to agree that this isn't the best recipe, but it's not bad.  If you like lots of flavor, this might need more tinkering, this is somewhere in the middle between plain white rice and full flavored rice with a kick. This is definitely easy to make though.

I used brown rice as that was what I had.  I followed the directions on the package as far as quantity of broth used.  I put all ingred except apples and Craisins (dd doesn't like raisins) then added those about half way through the package-directed cooking time.  This was an excellent side dish that the whole family liked and I will be making again.  Thank you for sharing!!

I served this as a side dish to my honey-garlic marinated pork roast for dinner with family. It was tasty, but maybe a little bland.  I will definitely make it again - possibly add a little something.

I served this with a seafood birthday dinner and I felt like it was a bit of a let down.  It tasted good, but it's nothing special.  It also looks completely boring once cooked - the apples fade and the raisins are pale.  It needs more color.

My husband rated this a 4, but I thought it was more of a 2 or 3.  I thought the leftovers tasted better the 2nd day.  I'll probably make it again just to give it another chance.

A very tasty rice side dish. Not really spicy enough for my taste, and I did not really care for the raisins...it seemed to have more sweet than spice. Next time I'll try adding some curry and more garlic, it should compliment the raisins quite nicely.

I followed the recipe exactly and the rice was uncooked. Let down. Won't make it again even though I think these ingredients sound really good together.

This was great! I served it with honey balsamic pork medallions and fresh string beans.

Good stuff with pork chops.  Left out the raisins and added a small bit of apple cider to boost the apple flavor.

Very good!   All the family liked it.  I served it with the pecan and honey pork chops (see review).  It went together perfectly.  I had some packet mix byriani spices and I added a small amount at the first stage, just to jazz it up a bit.  This is a definite winner and I will do it again.

Huge family hit, going to be a common dish in this family, easy to make.
