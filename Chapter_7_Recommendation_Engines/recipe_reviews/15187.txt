I read the reviews before I Ever cook/bake Anything from allrecipes.com and I am shocked! I must be a horrible cook because everyone seems to love this recipe and I thought it was gawd awful. The graham crackers we so soggy and everything tasted too buttery, like dessert-like. 
Although the chicken was so tender and was so juicy on the inside, plus the potatoes and corn we very tender as well...  It's graham cracker coating, it was just horrible to me, I will not make this again or recommend this. And I believe I will make it a point not to make any meal recipes that sound like dessert recipes.

Yuck, my stomach clenches just thinking about it.

I had some graham cracker crumbs I wanted to use up so decided to make this.  It was VERY GOOD! My husband and I really enjoyed it.

I thought this was absolutely delicious! The chicken was very tender and juicy. The corn and potatoes (I used canned potatoes, which I've never used before!), were delicious as well. Maybe 1/2 teaspoon of salt next time, but definitely a keeper!

Wow! I've never had chicken this tender before. Both my husband and I loved that you didn't even need a knife to cut it. Although he was a little wary about it being coated in graham cracker crumbs it was delicious and unusual. I'll make this one again. :)

This was amazing. I was a little bit wary of the graham cracker crumbs, but decided to give it a try anyway.  I made a couple of changes to cut down on the fat content. I used oil instead of butter for the vegetables and milk in place of the butter for the chicken. There was still plenty of flavor and the potatoes crisped up on the edges nicely.  The graham cracker coating got really crispy, which we loved. I will definately be making this again!

I'm an intermediate cook and love trying new things ...so, UNFORTUNATELY, I tried this...the graham cracker idea didn't appeal to me from the start and I'll never go against my "gut" instincts..this was not good...I served it, family members (3) took a bite or 2 & hubby suggested he make a run to KFC!  wayyyy to sweet and even if the crumbs had been some other type it would have come out soggy.

With a couple of alterations this made a quick, delicious meal. I altered it by dipping the chicken in egg yolk instead of butter and using a frozen corn medley instead of the canned corn. Next time I would decrease the initial 1/4 cup of butter to make it lighter. Will definitely make again and again!

Tastes and smells amazing but the breading was gooey so I baked it for 5 more minutes uncovered and it looked better. I would use egg yolk instead of butter to coat raw chicken.

Delicious! I loved the slight sweetness of the crackers. It was a great complement to the other flavors in the dish. Definitely a keeper.

W hile the chicken was real moistened and tasty potatoes were little dry.  I used spray better on the potatoes instead of real butter and frozen corn instead of can corn. My mom side it needed a sauce.  I got out barbecue sauce for her and she put some on her chicken and potatoes and was happy as can be.

Family enjoyed it.  Coating on chicken was flavorful.  Did take longer to cook than stated in the recipe, in order for the potato slices to cook thoroughly.

This is a great recipe - my kids loved the chicken.   I omit the salt and it still tastes great!

HAHAHHA this was good! I really liked this! Nice comfort food. In order to make it a little healthier, I put olive oil in the baking dish instead of butter, and I used an egg wash (also instead of butter). After 75 min I took off the tin foil cover and baked another 10 min uncovered to make the crust on the chicken a little crisper. Result was great!! Easy, quick to make, my tummy is happy.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe... so did everyone in the office when they got a whiff!  Superb, especially if you're not into spicy recipes but don't want a bland recipe.

pretty good. family enjoyed it. I did however have to make extra graham cracker crumbs- probably because of the size of my chicken breast
