Very tasty recipe. I substituted black pepper and used salmon instead of talapia but this was easy to prepare and has a great flavor.I also only baked it for 15 minutes at 400 which was more than enough...so be careful with the cooking time.

Okay first off I loved this recipe! Second I cooked with swai , I also didn't have feta cheese or lemon rinds. Instead of the feta cheese I used grated parmesan, I didn't have spinach so I used fresh kale...lol I changed the whole recipe. But it was so good. So if you don't have certain ingredients try it anyway.  It's awesome!

I really liked this.  The spinach was the highlight of the dish.  Excellent.  I made as directed.  I used reduced fat feta cheese and cut butter back to 1 Tbs.  I think next time I will season the tilapia a little more, maybe add some lemon pepper.  I served this with basmati rice.

This was so good! Even my super picky 7 year old liked it. I would add more spinach next time... after it cooks all the way, there isn't really a lot to go around, so I'm going to double the recipe for that, but other than that, this recipe was a 10.

Definitely need 18oz. of spinach for this.  Artichoke hearts would also be good in this.

It was good but the olives were overwhelming.  I had such high hopes based on the other reviews.  Everyone said leave out the olives (my family likes olives too).  I may try it again and either leave them out or cut way back and chop smaller.

Delicious.  Had a little more than a pound of tilapia, but kept all other amounts the same and used black pepper.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Wow!! Stupendous! I fixed this tonight in less than an hour with a fresh wild caught Tilapia that I caught and filleted myself. I followed the recipe exactly like it is offered with the one exception of too little spinach ( I had only a 10 oz bag of fresh spinach, but I did have a package of frozen ) I thawed the frozen in the microwave then added it to the baking dish before I placed it in the oven. My wife and I devoured the dish accompanied by tall cool glasses of homemade Sangria. I'm so thankful for this recipe!

I couldn’t think of anything to make for dinner, so I went to my go to site (air recipes )and then entered tilapia which I had on hand. This is the best tilapia recipe I’ve ever made. My husband loved it. I loved the greens which typically I hate greens. I didn’t have enough spinach so I added Kale to it and it was delicious. It’s easy to make and I had nearly all the ingredients on hand. (Short on spinach)

Amazing! Followed almost exactly except used frozen chopped spinach, feta stuffed Greek olives, added Italian cheese and mushrooms.   I sautéed in a cast-iron skillet and baked in the same skillet for 14 mins (my tilapia was thinner).  A one dish wonder I will make again.

Loved it!  Didn't have feta so I used goat cheese and a bit of Asiago. Really great incorporation of flavors. Gotta flavor the fish first though... I use Tony Chacheres, but any seasonings you like will work. Delicious!

Excellent! I did make some changes. I used a 1/2 cup sliced black olives instead of kalamata olives, 3 oz of crumbled feta cheese instead of only 2 tablespoons, and used the juice of half a lemon instead of 2 teaspoons. Very delicious.

The spinach was very good.  I only wilted it a bit in the pan before adding the other ingredients because it looks so overcooked in all the pictures posted.   (the dish also needed less time in the oven before the fish was cooked through.)  The tilapia, however, was extremely bland and flavorless, even though I added more lemon juice than called for.  More salt and spices are needed on the fish.  I suspect the spinach would have been a little bland, too, if I hadn't added extra feta and olives, and used the full amount of  onion and garlic even though I used half the amount of spinach and fish since I only needed two servings.

Delicious! We had this for lunch today & will be enjoying it again soon. I followed the recipe, with one accidental exception. Somehow I only used half of the spinach called for, but the correct amounts for the remaining (spinach) portion of the recipe. We like olives, so we enjoyed how much their taste stood out. The next time I will be sure to use the right amount of spinach & will up the remaining ingredients by 1.5.

The only change I made was to double the recipe for a larger group.
Easy to follow instructions, easy to make and was enjoyed by many.
Thank you, and I will be making this again.

Fantastic recipe, cooked this last night and my wife and I loved it.  Took about 40 minutes alltogether, the spinach was very tasty and paired very well with the tilapia.  Will definitely add this recipe to my regular rotation.  Also, I substituted green olives for kalamata, and used regular pepper in place of the white pepper.  Still turned out fantastic.  My recommendation is to use very little salt, the olives provide enough saltiness.

I cooked the tilapia slightly in a pan before putting with mixture in oven just to give it some color. Will definitely make again.

I followed recipe other than had Swai, not Tilapia, used few green olives rather than Kalamata olives, and doubled the spinach and cheese. For some reason the spinach tasted too salty, maybe because of the feta cheese and 1/4 tsp salt.  Next time I won't add any salt.  Otherwise it would have been delicious.

Great recipe and will definitely make again, I substituted wild caught cod for the tilapia.  Tilapia has gotten so popular and it's easy to 'farm'.  It's 'farmed' in some pretty nasty places.  I'll never eat that stuff again, yuck !  Back to the recipe, I crumbled extra feta to sprinkle on the top when it was done.  Yum!

love this dish throw a little white wine in with the spinach to give it a little more zang. I'm thinking of making the base then sub oysters on top n serving with toasted pita bread for an app at next party

Fantastic!  I made some rice to lay the fish on, absolutely fantastic.  I will upload the rice recipe once I have actual measurements.  Right now it was just done by taste.

I liked this a lot and I've made it a few times. You have to be very careful when making it though. It's very easy to overcook the veggies. Also, I don't like cooking the feta in the meal. I'm not a fan of it. I always add the cheese at the last minute so it's just a little gooey and the flavor pops.

Quick, easy, and excellent.  Cooking for one, I cut the recipe in half and left out the olives.  Not only excellent flavor, but great the next day as well.

This is a good and easy recipe that I will add to my collection.  I followed it as is except I used frozen flounder instead of tilapia because that is what I had.  Next time I will try tilapia as I think it would be even better.

Delicious!  And easy!  Tasted like something you would get at a great restaurant. I don't like olives so I substituted mushrooms and sautéed them with the onions and garlic. I will definitely be making this again. Perfect for my low carb diet.

This is an easy and delicious recipe. I sprinkled some gluten free fish coating for a little  added  color and texture. My husband commented on the appearance and said this recipe was a keeper.  A good way to spice up spinach.  I will prepare again
