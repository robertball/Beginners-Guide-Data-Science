Delicious!  I used 1 quart Veg stock (4 cups) instead of the called for 8.  It made a nice and thick puree.  This recipe makes a ton, but it reheats well.  So healthy and tasty!

Wow! For a vegetable soup, this was really great. I only used 2 quarts of stock total and mashed rather than pureed the soup. I also used skim milk and a Tbsp of flour instead of cream to cut the fat.  There was a little bit left over and I cook black eyed peas in it with a little chicken broth and they were exceptional also. Thanks for the recipe.

Very good. I had to skip the heavy cream so I  bet it's even better if you follow the recipe exactly.

Just a note: Celeriac isn't the root of the celery plant. It's a different plant altogether with a mild celery/parsley taste.  It's easier to peel if you slice it and then cut the peel off like you would cut off the crusts on a slice of bread.

I wish I could say that I liked it more as it is certainly a very unique combination of ingredients for a soup. I think the sweetness overwhelmed me and the celeriac wasn't quite a strong enough flavour to offset it. Perhaps cutting the pears back to one or two instead of three would have made it better for me.

My husband says that this is restaurant quality soup. I do not have access to celeriac root so I substituted 2 whole stalks of celery including the celery leaves. I do remove the celery strings otherwise even when I blend it I have a few little stringy pieces. Anyone that we have shared it, really enjoy it.
