This recipe is 5 stars with my modifications.  I'm used to the Mexican version so I had to change just a few things.  I left out the lime and anise and simmered 1 cup of milk with a cinnamon stick and some whole cloves.  When the rice was done cooking I put a strainer over the pot and poured the milk in.  I added 3-5oz cans of evaporated milk instead of 12oz and added only 3/4 of the can of condensed milk.  I sprinkled in more ground cinnamon and nutmeg too.  The vanilla and salt I added as the recipe states. I only let it simmer for about 5 minutes because we like a lot of liquid with the rice.

I grew up with this dish. So I had great expectations.  I followed this recipe to a tee.  Don’t know if there is a difference between the Cuban version and the Mexican version but this dish was a bit too sweet for my taste.  I'll share my beloved mother’s recipe for those who prefer a mildly sweet rice dessert.

EXCELLENT!  Just like my grandmother use to make.  I am also Cuban, and I have been searching for an "Arroz con Leche" recipe like this one for a very long time.  A++

Absolutely delicious.  I like my rice pudding thick, so I reduced it a little more than normal.  Don't worry if it looks too watery at first, the rice will soak it all up.  As for the comment regarding condensed milk.  Use it (one can should be enough)!  Rich and sweet is what rice pudding should be.

I thought this was really good, though I next time I will used more condensed milk for a creamier, sweeter pudding. I am Cuban and grew up on incredible arroz con leche and this is the closest I have found.

Like all other cooks, we change what we may.  I replaced cloves for the anise seeds.  Great recipe, will make many more times.

Iam mexican american so i grew up with my grandmas mexican version of arroz con leche, hers has more milk in it and is less sweet. I made this and for me it was way to sweet next time im a add half of the sweetened condensed milk instead of the whole can. Glad i had a taste of cuban arroz con leche it was good.

I made this last night and it is delicious.  Its sweeter than what I'm used to so i might used a little less condensed milk next time. I used long grain rice instead of short grain so I'm not sure if that's why it came out extra sweet but still delicious.   Thanks!!

Mmmm... Que RICO!!!  This rice pudding was creamy, delicious, and simple. I omitted the lemon and anise because I didn't have any. I also swapped evaporated milk for regular milk and it still turned out great. Yummy!!

A creamy orange-flavored Arroz con Leche with Arborio rice with one spoonful of margerine, and Dulce de Leche, Cuban-style with fine orange rinds, spiced with a dusting of nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla, salt, and lots of sweet raisins to taste with cow's milk, condensed and evaporated milk tempered with one egg to create a custard.  This is called Arroz con Leche Imperial.

Excellent, authentic-tasting recipe.  Reminded me of arroz con leche I've eaten in Peru.  I couldn't really taste the lime, however, so I added some fresh lime juice to the finished product.  I couldn't find star anise in the store, but I didn't find that using a cinnamon stick added more flavor than using ground cinnamon.  Next time I'll use ground spices to save time without compromising flavor.

I loved this recipe. I followed it almost to a tee, except instead of lime peel I used orange peel. I also made triple the amount of the water, anise seed, cinnamon stick combination because I knew it would reduce so I ended up with exactly 1/2 cup of the flavored water for mixing in the end. I even hand crushed the anise seeds by hand with a stone bowl and stone. I left out the raisins though, and I sprinkled the top with ground cinnamon when served. My family loved it. So sweet and delectable. I can't wait to make it again in the future.

I'm Cuban-American and grew up with an amazing grandmother who loved to cook, and she did it well. Though I never thought abut it, I was unable to gather her recipes before her passing. This Arroz Con Leche recipe is the closest to her very own recipe. Amazing, not to sweet, yet sweet enough....It's a hit with family and friends.

I made this for a spanish dinner and my friends were amazed! It was delicious. I used only half of the can of sweetened condensed milk and long grain rice instead of the short one. These two changes didn't have any bad influence on the result. Once again, delicious, thank you !!

This was very tasty. I love the sweetness of the sweetened condensed milk and wouldnt have it any other way! I used whole milk instead of evaporated , used lime juice instead of the peel . To make a creamier pudding: at the end, remove about 2 cups of the pudding to a diffrent container and stir with 2 beaten eggs. Once mixed, add back to the pot along with nutmeg to taste, vanilla , 1 T of butter,and 1/3 cup of sugar. Cook another 3 to 5 minutes

The best rice pudding I've had! Also, an easier way to thicken the pudding is to simply refrigerate it!

Great recipe! I am Mexican and this desert is very much what we call back home "dulce de arroz con leche", its different from mexican arroz con leche since the latter one it's more like a hot drink kind of like "atole". Both of them delicious!!

This recipe is a little bite too sweet for me, and I will actually add more cinnamon to have a strong flavor. The rest works really good but a little bite to rich for my personal flavor, thought I am sure many friends will enjoy it just as it is.

This is delicious!! Its not too sweet when you use raisins, they balance out the sweet and tart flavor.  I made it with long grain rice insteaf of short, 2% milk instead of evaporated, I did not have and lime or anise. I let it cook off more to make it thicker and am eating it hot right now, this is definitely a great comfort food and good on a cold night. This is supposed to be sweet, its pudding.

Great recipe!  I am Mexican and love arroz con leche.  My mom used to make it often because it is one of our favorite desserts but this recipe is better (sorry Mexican arroz con leche!) The only thing I do differently is not letting it get dry.  We like it liquidy (did I just make up this word: liquidy?).  The anise makes my family think I spiked the arroz con leche.  We all love it!! I don't think it is as sweet as other members suggest.  It is just perfect for my sweet tooth.  The only problem I find is not finding short grain rice at the store.  Long grain takes a loooong time to cook.  I did find a medium one which I will try next time.

Skipped the whole 1st step and just used 3 or 31/2 cups pre-cooked rice. Then used 1/2c cup of milk instead of 1/2 cup of water for 2nd part and didnt have cinnamon stick so used 1 t cinnamon instead.completely omited anise and lemon. (never had to strain the mixture). never pulled out a second saucepan, just left the cinnamon milk mixure in sauce pan and after boiling 3 minutes, i added the evap milk and condensed milk and 1 teaspoon cornstarch and heated that till thick. once thick i added the vanilla and salt in addition to 2tbs butter (that just melted itslef into the hot mixure). wouldve been awesome w/ the raisins (just didnt have any) and can be sprinkled w/ sugar (if like it sweeter) and milk (if like it thinner). This was super good even though i changed it up a lot. my family kept fighting for seconds.

Followed recipe except for anise and added nutmeg and allspice. Plus some almond extract came out delicious, rich and flavorful.

Wow! Who needs to buy candy when you can just make this?! I absolutely loved it. I'm still pretty new to cooking for just myself and it was easy and only took an hour. Now I've got Cuban rice pudding for days. :-)
Thanks a lot for the recipe.
If anything, I'd maybe go with a little less condensed milk since it was so sweet.
But I'm pretty sure I'm going to make it the exact same way again next time too. :-)

I used long grain rice (what I had on hand) and adjusted water (1 3/4 cups water per 1 cup long grain rice) and cooking time (cooked rice for 25-30 mins) accordingly. I cooked rice with half water/half milk ratio, anise and 2 cinnamon sticks because of previous reviews of not getting enough of cinnamon taste. I still didn't get as strong a taste as I would've liked so I ended up adding ground cinnamon afterwards and also added nutmeg and allspice. I left out the raisins and didn't have evaporated milk/condensed milk, but traditionally it was used with 100% full-fat whole milk, so I used that instead. Since I didnt use condensed milk, I added about a cup of sugar to compensate. Mixture definitely thickens the longer you cook it and will thicken as it sits. Although my changes were significantly different compared to the original recipe, I used this recipe as an outline on how to make rice pudding and it came out great!!

I helped my daughter make this for a Social Studies assignment on Caribbean cuisine. This was the dessert after jerk pork, fried plantains and black beans made with sofrito (yum). It had a good flavor, but the kids thought it was better for breakfast the next morning.

First of all, I would like to say that those giving this recipe a bad review because it does not compare to the Mexican version should not be rating. The description clearly indicates that this is a CUBAN version. With that being said, I tried this recipe and followed everything EXACTLY as described. The recipe is good and tastes good but there are few things that I would say are missing to give it the five stars:

1. The recipe calls for too much vanilla extract. 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract overpowers the flavor. I believe that 1/2 a teaspoon would be enough for this recipe. 

2. There are people who stated they felt something was missing (those who were looking for the Cuban version I presume). I found the secret is to add a cinnamon stick to the rice as well, not just to the water with anise (not to exclude the cinnamon to the water, you still keep that). If you another cinnamon stick along with the milk, that should give it the kick that some may be looking for. You would then discard that cinnamon stick when serving.

Overall, this is a good recipe. It took me a bit of tweaking to fix the overpowering taste of the vanilla but I will definitely be making again!

arroz con leche is the hispanic version of rice pudding, much more liquidity to it. its amazing one of mexicans (and other hispanic cultures) favorite desert. i added a tiny bit more milk to this recipe.

The anise gave it an interesting kick but I omitted the lime peel. All in all in was still creamy and yummy, just not the flavor profile I was looking forward to.

Very  tasty and simple! I also modified and restricted my ingredients to cinnamon, water instead of milk, evaporated milk, half the condensed milk, raisins, and vanilla. Very good!

As an American who typically loves ethnic foods, I was not a big fan of this. I like creamy rice pudding, but I think the condensed milk in this recipe didn't go well with the rice. Two of my family members and a close friend also tried it and didn't like it.
