This is a great glaze. I made a pound cake but didn't have what the recipe required for the glaze. This recipe was perfect. The group I made it for were scrambling for a second piece.

I first tasted this glaze at a pot-luck, and it was wonderful.  The flavors blend beautifully, but if you try, you can identify each one!

I didn't have coconut extract but I used all the other flavors.  I tried it while hot, right out of the pan and was hesitant on using it on my pumpkin bread.  The flavors were very powerful.  I'd made two loafs of bread and opted to add the glaze to only one, just in case I didn't like it. I was surprised.  Once the bread absorbed the glaze, the flavors weren't as powering and was actually very good.

What's not to like about a glaze with all of these wonderful extracts??  Poked holes in the top of my angel food cake to allow the glaze to seep deep inside.  Will use this again and again.

Sensational! Used this glaze on my 5-Flavor Poundcake, and I never thought such a simple glaze would elevate it to new heights!!!

I am just not fan of this glaze. I had all the extracts on hand, and made a half batch to test. Something was just too over powering (perhaps the rum?). I think I would prefer this without the rum extract.

I used this glaze to top my lemon cake but I added some powdered sugar to give it a "crust" that stayed on top.  I used a lemon juice curd to enhance the lemon flavor.  Not a fan of rum or butter but the others blended well and sweetened the cake!

Using this flavor 'profile' and adding it to a standard powdered sugar and white Crisco icing and adding about a cup an a half of crushed pineapple to yellow cake mix, and adding coconut on top of the cupcakes, my cupcakes disappeared in minutes last night!!  I have already been asked to make these for our upcoming luau!  They were a major hit!!!

This is awesome, only missed the run extract, because the store didn't have. Once I find some I'll review it again, but without the rum is wonderful so I can only imagine with
