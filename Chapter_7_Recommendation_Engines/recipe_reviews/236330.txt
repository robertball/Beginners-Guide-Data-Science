09.14.16 ~ Really nice change on an egg salad recipe. I had an open jar of tahini on hand and a girl friend had given me a bottle of za'atar spice. I had not used the spice in/on any recipe so I was excited to find it in this recipe. I really liked the taste of the egg salad. It held up nicely for lunches without getting watery. That is always a plus in my book. I will certainly be making this one again. Thanks CAMILLEELISE, for sharing your recipe.

I actually do love mayo-based egg salad. Be that as it may, I love trying new things. This caught my eye while searching for something to do with tahini (besides the obvious hummus) and I had all the ingredients on hand.  The tahini and zaatar go extremely well together and pair wonderfully with the eggs. The yogurt I had is fat-free Greek, so it made the spread a bit thicker and I needed to add a bit more, other then that I stuck to the recipe.  I suggest not leaving out the pickle, the acid really balances it out. This is a lovely recipe for a sandwich, a big dolop on a lettuce salad or in a tomato cup. I'm going to try replacing egg with chicken, I suspect that would be lovely as well.
