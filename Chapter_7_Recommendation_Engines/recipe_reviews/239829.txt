This is the EXACT recipe once used by "The Tea Room" at L. S. Ayres Department Store in downtown Indianapolis.  My mother used to take me there, when I was a little girl in the 60's, and this was my very favorite soup of all time.  Now, a restaurant in the Castleton area of Indy (George's Neighboorhood Bar & Grill) serves nearly the same thing and it's absolutely, wonderfully delicious!

I've been looking for Chicken Velvet Soup and finally decided I would try making it. The velvety texture of this soup makes it a winner. I did add celery carrots and onions to the soup to make it a little more hearty along with garlic powder salt and white pepper. My family loved it.

This soup really does have the most velvety texture. I am going to use the base for my other creamy soups. However it was too bland for us. So I added some garlic and poultry seasoning. I also added celery onions and carrots for flavor and served it with a crusty garlic Italian loaf.

Really good!! Added noodles ( had them) and some canned carrots. Liked that it did not make a huge pot. Will be a soup that will stay in my recipe box!! Already recommended to family!!

I wish I could say that this was FABULOUS!....but it was just meh. The texture is truly velvety however the flavor is lacking...and I used homemade stock. I would saute some onions or garlic and then blend them into the soup or maybe add a finisher of sherry or truffle oil. The kids added salt and pepper with some scallions. Some would call this simple we called it bland.

A very simple and quick soup that is different and very tasty. Very creamy and it does reheat well. Makes a very quick evening meal with all common kitchen ingredients.

Love this simple fabulous soup! I sprinkle celery salt in as well and add 2 cups cooked rice. (Trader Joe's microwave Jasmine-3 minutes) My husband LOVES this with toasted French bread and butter.

It does have a velvety texture indeed; however it had no flavor. I won’t make this again.

I added some onion powder a good bit of paprika some black pepper and just a little Italian seasoning. I used one cup of half and half rather than 1/2 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of cream. I thought it was absolutely delicious. Velvety is the perfect word!
