Needless to say, my kids really dig pizza and sloppy joes so I knew that this recipe would be right up their alley's. The only change I made was omitting the corn and replacing with two small cans of green chiles. Hubby and I loved it too!

My husband is away on business so I've been trying to make "fun foods" for the kids, well my  son LOVED it & my daughter took the meat off & well, I guess pretty much ate the crust (she loves sloppy joes, but hated this mix).  I made the "quick and easy pizza crust" from this site (which the baby really liked).  Next time, I will use my recipe for sloppy joes, thanks McCormick-

I know as a McCormick recipe, that you are supposed to use the McCormick seasoning, but it was awful.  I rinsed off the ground sirloin (at about $5.00 a pound, yeah I was gonna rinse it)  & remade it using my own recipe, then this was good.  Thanks for the idea McCormick, not the spice packet.

This was so great!  Since several other reviewers did not like the seasoning packet, I just made my own sloppy joe recipe, which I love.  Then I put it on a Boboli and topped with mozzarella cheese - perfect!

A good recipe except for the amount of salt.  I made the recipe omitting the seasoning mix, and used my own mix instead. Was much better.

THIS WAS SO QUICK AND EASY. I USED KROGER BRAND SLOPPY JOE MIX AND LEFT OUT THE CORN. YUMMY.
