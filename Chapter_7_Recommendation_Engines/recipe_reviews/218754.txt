A simple weeknight meal the husband and oldest son enjoyed. I couldn't find monterey jack cheese, so colby jack was sub'd along with sliced grilled chicken instead of the deli. It was a bit dry in the middle, maybe using a creamier cheese like gruyere would help keep the chicken moist while baking. The mushroom gravy did help eliminate that, but for the boy who doesn't like gravy, it was dry to eat.. so he used ketchup, the kid's condiment of choice. Will make this again, subbing out chicken for ham or other meats & using other cheeses.
