I love cornbread made with all cornmeal and no flour. So this recipe really appealed to me. Since it's just my husband and I, I cut the recipe in half and made it in my smaller cast iron pan. I couldn't bring myself to add the salt because the self-rising cornmeal already has salt in it. What I really liked about this recipe is that the shortening that you melt in the skillet before adding the batter creates the crunchy crust on the bottom of the bread. Neither Pam nor oil does that. So good!

I have never made cornbread without flour so I was a little concerned but I was not disappointed.
This is good stuff and will be my go to from now on. Light, fluffy and quite tasty.

I made no changes and it was just like what Grandma made.  The cured cast iron skillet is the way to go.  Wonderful crispy bottom.

Had to use butter, sadly. Result: terrible. Dense, heavy bread with a rock-hard bottom crust. 
“Melting  shortening in the skillet before adding the batter creates a crunchy crust on the bottom. Neither Pam nor oil does that.” Nor butter... bacon fat, here I come!

Growing up, I loved cracklin' cornbread.  Since it's impossible to find cracklins' now that I live in the Northeast, I've found two very good substitutes to add to my cornbread - and this is my favorite recipe.  I either crumble up about 1/2 cup of pork rinds or chop up about 1/2 cup chicarone (sp?) and stir it into the batter, without reducing the amount of shortening called for.  Yum.

This is by far the worst corn bread I have ever had. Very dry.
