Just my luck and got another mind boggling formula due to manufacturers downsizing their product. So I decided to throw caution to the wind and use a 15.25 oz box of spice cake mix and a 15 oz can of pumpkin puree because that's what I had on hand. Mixed the pumpkin and cake mix together which resulted in the consistency of peanut butter. Filled the muffin cups up to 2/3rds and used a small bent/offset icing knife, sprayed with non-stick spray, to kind of smooth out the batter.  Baked for 19 minutes and cooled. I had to eat three of these babies to make sure I liked them. Apparently I did. The top was firm with a moist inside. Maybe a dollop of whipped cream wouldn't hurt either.

Good flavor.  Cooked 22 minutes and should have cooked 28. Added cinnamon, ground cloves and nutmeg to the mix.  Take out of pan immediately and cool on a rack. Will make again using longer cooking time.
