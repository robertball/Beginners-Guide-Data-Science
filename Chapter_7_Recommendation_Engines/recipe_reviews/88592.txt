..A deep sea fishing trip resulted in a freezer full of tuna steaks..One particular recipe I chose left me with a few marinated and grilled tuna steaks which I used to make these tuna lime tostadas/tacos.  I just cut the steaks into bite size pieces, used flour tortillas and pico de gallo rather than the corn tostadas and salsa.  I also added a diced avocado..Served with drunken fruit slushies...No complaints!

While preparing this, I kept saying to my husband that I thought it seemed like it would need something... but they were REALLY good on their own.  We ate them on whole wheat tortillas like soft-shell tacos, and added a few toppings like shredded cheese, lettuce, and extra salsa.  Didn't use the sour cream.  We'll make them again!

My husband thought these were amazing! He really liked the flavor mixture. I cut back on the cilantro a little and added more salsa. Also added some garlic salt to taste.

This was delicious.  I cooked a tuna steak in the skillet which I had marinated in a bit of balsamic vinegar, olive oil and all purpose seasoning and used it in this recipe.  So easy and tasty.

this is a wonderful recipe! I made a full batch for myself & I've gotten at least 5 meals from it (and there's still some left). I never would have thought to prepare tuna this way. it's delicious! I made a couple of slight changes -- to the tuna mixture, I added a dollop of mayo just to keep it together, and a can of black beans for variety. I ran out of lime so I finished it off with lemon juice. I cut back on the cilantro a bit. and I sprinkled the tostadas with pepper jack, broiled for 1 minute, and topped with sliced avocado. absolutely delicious! thanks so much for the idea!

I loved this but I did have to change it up a little due to food allergies. I used homemade GF tortilla's that I pan fried until crispy as my base. I used the white tune, onion, cilantro, lime, salt, and pepper as called for. I took out the corn and replaced with mushrooms and black olives and added extra salsa because I love it. Replaced the hot sauce with old bay. Then topped with avocado. This way it was GF, corn and dairy free and still something I could eat. Thank you for a recipe that could be modified to my diet and still taste great. I would never have though to try it with out this recipe as a starting off point.

This was an AWESOME recipe!  I followed it to a T, but I made quesadillas with them!  Just lay a flour tortilla on a plate, put some of the tuna mixture on it, cover it with the second tortilla, and fry it in a pan, both sides, until lightly browned. Cut into wedges and dip in salsa.  WONDERFUL!!

My fiancee and I are trying to eat healthier - this sounded like a great option. I prepared according to directions - to be honest - (its just our opinion) we REALLY didn't like it. We love albacore & are NOT picky eaters but I couldn't even finish mine. Dont let this influence you trying it - it seems it was a big hit with others. As for us though, we wont be making this again.

This is a good semi-homemade meal.  Don't skimp on the salsa and lime juice.  The fresher the ingredients the better.  If you make your own salsa, it would kick it up a notch.

Very good recipe! I had this saved for quite a while and was just too scared to try it. So glad I did. I cut this down to 4 but only had 1 can of tuna so I added some shredded cabbage for filler. I normally don't add sour cream to my tacos but it is very good with these. Will definitely make these again. Served with a cucumber, rotel, and caper orzo pasta salad.

These were pretty good for a fast, no-cook meal.  Were even better microwaved with a little cheese melted on top.

A good alternative to the typical mayo-based tuna dish, but nothing outstanding. I followed the recipe exactly except I left out the onion and hot sauce because I didn't have any on hand. I felt like the tuna was missing some flavor. I might try this again and add more spices (maybe some cayenne pepper?) Overall, not bad!

I added some things to the recipes to better suit my taste buds, which like things on the spicier side:
-1/2 finely chopped jalapeno pepper
-1 tablespoon mayo
-small pieces of avacado for garnish
-shredded cheese for garnish
I also did not use any salsa, as I didn't want to buy a whole container for just for the small amount called for in this recipe.
Lastly, I put the tostada in my toaster for just a little while to make it warm.
With the things I did above, I thought this on the cheap side recipe turned out pretty well.

I rarely follow a recipe exactly as it posted.  This one I made a couple of minimal changes, more lime and added 1 clove of pressed garlic.  This recipe turned out amazing, truly loved everything about this meal.

I was actually surprised.  I was in a hurry and decided to try this - and it was a great quick meal!  I was surprised at how much I liked it, considering I'm not a tuna fan... I did spread Miracle Whip on the tostadas before putting on the tuna mixture and I felt like it made a good transition between the crunch of the tostada and the bulk of the tuna mixture.  My toddlers weren't thrilled, but I liked it enough to have again!

I was a bit disappointed with this. I wish I had made the tuna mix and then let it sit in the fridge overnight. Ok, it was a light healthy lunch, but it could have been better. Thanks anyway.

I liked this a lot minus the cilantro because I really despise the stuff. Used lemon instead of lime and added a bit more salsa. Love tuna in almost any way shape or form and this was certainly something a bit different. Thanks for a great lunch!!

Good idea, but will change a few things next time. We will make sure we have taco shells or tostada shells. We fried some flour tortillas since we didn't have the right shells & we know now to make sure we have the right ones. Also, no more extra hot sauce on top, we'll put more in the mixture cause adding the extra on top leaves in in a small area & to hot. We'll also probably put some sour cream in the mixture instead of on top also. We used defrosted frozen corn instead of canned & liked that much better.  Since we used Taco Slaw as a side & put some on top of these, we'll also use that again with changes I noted on that review. Hubby said this was a nice change.

Had to make too many alterations so it wasn't dry and had some flavor. Even after that, not very good.

Great recipe. BIG HIT WITH THE WIFE. Can't leave anything alone though. Cut the recipe down in half but added  more cilantro, olives, avocado, and doubled the lime juice. Also a little salt. Great flavors. Highly recommend white corn tortillas.  Little bit of texture and great flavor with the mix. Thanks.

This was fantastic and very easy to prep and serve. We use picante sauce for the hot sauce/salsa and skipped the cilantro. We'll definitely be making this again!

I enjoyed this, especially with how fast and easy it was to prepare. I served this in pita pockets instead of on top of tostadas, and I skipped the sour cream to make it even lighter. Now I'm finishing off just the mixture for lunch. I'll make this again. Even my 22 month old enjoyed it.

Made this tonight for a quick dinner for the family and it was a big hit. I really like that it's low fat and high in protein. I made my own fresh salsa instead of a jar and added some shredded lettuce to it for extra greens.

Quick, easy, healthy dish.  Great for summer.  I found that even after adding triple the amount of salsa and 5 T lime juice I could barely taste either, so my suggestion would be to add the salsa as a topping, versus an ingredient to allow for personal flavour preferences.

really good way to server tuna and it was such a terrific and easy meal for summer time.  I added 1/2 cup of shredded cheese to the mix and put a mixture of sour cream and salsa on top.  Yummy!

Made as directed on tostadas the first night, then the husband finished it off as a dip with tortilla chips the next day. This was okay, I like all the ingredients in the recipe, it just didn't seem like the tuna really meshed well.

We ate it as a taco filling the first night then I spooned it over salad the next day. I almost liked it more as a salad. It was a tasty twist on regular old ground beef.

My husband and I both thought this was great! It's a nice, light dinner that is easy to make and clean up. I left out the cilantro & hot sauce and added a touch of garlic powder - it was perfect. Thanks!

Very tasty and filling! I did change a few things - I used about 4 green onions instead of 1/2 a red or yellow, and 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper because I didn't have hot sauce. We made tacos and topped it with pepper jack cheese, homemade guacomole, sour cream, tomatoes and lettuce.  I think we will be eating this often! Thank you, Caroline!

The adult members of our family gave this a big thumbs up.  We loved the fresh and light taste that the lime and cilantro gave the tuna -- way beyond plain old tuna salad loaded with mayo.  The kids weren't huge fans, but we'll just make it for lunch when they're at school!  I also loved how easy this was to prepare.  I made it by the recipe -- possibly adding a bit more onion than it called for.  It was delicious!

Great recipe and virtually zero prep-work/time!  I don't think you can make a tuna sandwich faster.  Presentation is amazingly nice for a quick lunch/brunch type meal.  No changes necessary but can be easily modified for different diets/tastes.

I thought these were fairly hideous. The flavors just didn't seem to meld well. With millions of ways to make tuna salad, this would be the millionth-and-one on my list.

I did like this....did not add any hot sauce (couldn't have it, and don't really like it anyway).  Hubby liked this recipe too.  Unfortunately I halved the recipe and shouldn't...it didn't make enough for us for a dinner.  Didn't use mayo like some other reviewers, just the sour cream.  Nice for a light lunch that takes no time to prepare.  Thanks for the post.

I used a leftover tuna steak (Sesame Seared Tuna from this site, cooked MR), I pan-fried corn tortillas (I like them much better than store bought tostadas ...they taste better & have much better visual appeal) & even though I like cilantro, I wish I had followed LindaMcClean's lead & omitted it or subbed italian parsley instead. I did decrease the amount quite a bit (hard to tell though when the recipe calls for a "bunch" LOL) but the strong flavor of cilantro still prevailed over all the others. I added some roasted red pepper for color & flavor & I topped them w/ shredded monterrey jack cheese. Even w/ the strong cilantro flavor, this was pretty tasty. I think the sour cream is a must to help mellow all the flavors out & I'm not real big on sour cream. I told hubby I didn't know if I would bother to make this w/ canned tuna & he said, "I don't know...it'd probably be pretty good as long as you leave out the cilantro" so there you go. I forgot to thank Caroline C. for the heads up about marinating it for awhile...I made it up & let it sit in the fridge for several hours.
