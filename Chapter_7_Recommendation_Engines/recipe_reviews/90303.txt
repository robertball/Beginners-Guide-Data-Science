I followed the recipe to the book and it's delicious! But a little too salty so instead, I used 2/3C chicken broth and 1/3C soy sauce (I use premium soy sauce, which is saltier) to balance out. Another time I tried 3/4C chicken broth and 1/4C soy sauce - makes the recipe a little bland but if you're watching your sodium intake, this might be a good option. I have made this 5X already and e-mailed it to all my crock pot friends. Way to go!

These were way too salty and according to my Korean boyfriend, not Korean.  He said that to make the recipe more authentic (and less salty) sugar should be added to the broth.

Good slow cooker recipe. I used low sodium soy sauce and chicken broth, but tripled the quantities of both because our slow cooker is 5 quart oval and I didn't want the liquid to burn on the sides of the pot. Also added in an extra tbls. of paste and doubled the garlic. We made 8 medium thickness pork chops. They were very tender and flavorful. We served them with simple steamed mixed vegetables on the side.

5 star w/ suggestions from others.  Here's how to take a 4 star & make it 5 star: (1) use 1/2 c. low sodium chicken broth; (2) sub Ponzu (seasoned soy sauce) for soy sauce.  Ponzu had 400mg sodium / svg, lite tarmari has 700 mg sodium and regular soy sauce has 900+mg sodium.   That's it.  Has a GREAT flavor, pork chops shredded apart and are neighbors at the condo wanted to know what smelled so good.  We served over Jasmine rice with stir fried mixed veggies.  The "zucchini and onion stir fry" recipe from this site is really good with this too.  Thanks for sharing.  We had to find the Korean chile paste at a local Asian market since Whole Foods, Earthfare and local Ingles didn't have it but it was worth the hunt to get it!

I used extra bean paste because I love spicy food and I used 2/3 chicken broth and 1/3 soy sauce as recommended by another user.

This recipe started off with a great flavor, and by the end of the chop, It was so salty, we couldn't eat it anymore.  I used both low sodium broth and soy sauce, so I'm not sure what happened...

Like the other postings, this was just too salty.  I used low sodium soy sauce and even added sugar.  Not a recipe I will try again.

This was ok.  The flavor was pretty good, but it was salty.  I think the sauce would have been better as a stir fry sauce instead of a slow cooker recipe.  I just thought the soy overpowered the meat.

Yummo! I did these in the slow cooker with a big ol' pack of pork chops from Costco; great! No changes to the recipe and will make it again as is.

My family absolutely loved this recipe and it was really easy!  I'd like to know the type/size of pork chops that other people used in this recipe.  Thick? Thin?  Boneless?

These were absolutely delicious. I couldnt find the chile paste so I looked up a substitute, red pepper flakes, and it was still great. So I bet it could only be better with the paste. I had the pork chops with the kikkoman sponsored fried rice recipe on this site, which was also great.

This was great! We used low sodium soy sauce and chicken broth due to a lot of people saying it was salty. My mom loved it so much she had two pork chops. We served it with brown rice and broccoli. We will make this again.
