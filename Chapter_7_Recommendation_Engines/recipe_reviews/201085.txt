This was really tasty and the perfect comfort food.  I cooked it with the lid on and it thickened up nicely and served it over rice.

Used the pressure cooker - 20 min for the beef/onions and broth (the beef was still partially frozen), release pressure, add the rest of the stuff, return to pressure and cook for 5 more minutes.  I also added 1/4 head of chopped cabbage to the meat/onions.  It disolved into the broth and served as a thickener.  Yummy AND fast!

I made this for my husband who is allergic to soy and gluten intolerant. I omitted the flour, used beef short ribs instead of stew meat, and added some carrots. The results were amazingly tasty. It tastes even better than the curry prepared with the Japanese curry bricks. Very flavorful and easy to make. Thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe. I will definitely be making this again!

Thank you for this dairy free, soya free recipe.  'm wheat and wheat product intolerant, plus lactose intolerant.  This curry is great. (I used cornstarch for thickener...)

This is a stick to your ribs, hearty meal. However, the curry and molasses add a different wonderful flavor. It has a touch of spice, but my 7 year old ate it up! I served it with some buttered toast and made it as directed. Great meal

I followed the directions to the tee and hated it at first , I let it sit overnight so the potatoâ€™s could soak up the two heaping tablespoons of curry, was amazing for my lunch the next day

Made it as directed. It was a little plain. I would add some more curry, and more heat next time. But perfectly serviceable.

I like this, and eat it like a stew, using 2T of corn starch to thicken.
Think beef stew with curry powder.

Like another reviewer, I cooked this in my instant pot. I realized potatoes can act as a thickener so didn't use any flour (or salt and pepper). I wasn't crazy about the addition of rice vinegar largely because it leaves too acidic a taste. I usually love curry, and I liked this but won't make it again.

Thanks for the recipe.  I used 3 lbs potatoes, which was a little too much, but saying "3 potatoes" in the recipe doesn't tell me much.  It would be a lot easier if you would say how many pounds of potatoes you need in the recipe.  I also tripled the molasses and used ground beef instead of stew meat.

It was not my families favorite. I haven't cooked with curry before either. It just tasted odd to me. Maybe if I was used to this type of cooking we would have liked it....

Holy wow, was this good!!  Next time I think I'll add more meat (what can I say, we're a family of carnivores.)
