I've seen this recipe published in assorted magazines using a mini Snickers in the center in place of a Rollo, er "chocolate covered caramel candy".  I decided to give this recipe a shot and add a photo/review as it was lacking both.  The dough came together quite easily in my KA and I chilled the dough for a few hours.  The dough was easy to work with, though I found it best to grab some dough, flatten it in my palm, then wrap it around the Rollo, pinching off any excess before rolling it into a smooth ball.  These took 10 minutes for me and yielded 49 cookies for me.  They were a hit with Mr. LTH's bandmates.  THANKS for the recipe, Pellie!

These were very good but they are missing something to make them spectacular!  I dipped my caramel candies in sea salt and sprinkled a little on top.

Made these as part of a Christmas platter and they were a huge hit. This recipe doesn't need any real changes, however I didn't think the cookie looked finished so I drizzled a little dark chocolate over the tops to get rid of the brown blob appearance. These were a big hit.

Delicious! I used mini Rolos for the center. Make sure there are no cracks or it will leak out.

I made these with bite size Snickers because that is what I had on hand. They turned out amazingly delish. The recipe is easy to follow and the dough perfect to work with. Thank you.

I made these for my families Christmas cookie platter this year and these disappeared first. This was really easy recipe and that was a big hit for a picky family.

The dough was very crumbly and honestly difficult to wrap around the candy.

They worked out so well for me. My batch didn’t make as much because I used Oreos and Reese’s peanut butter cups for mine. If you live in a warm climate or you have naturally hot hands, work quickly when rolling the mixture out to fill because it will melt quickly and be hard to work with
