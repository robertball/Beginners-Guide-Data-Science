Wow, this was amazing!!!  I did change quite a bit of things though... I cannot have gluten, so I omitted the saltine crackers and used crushed GF cornflakes instead.  Also, we didn't have any butter beans so I used an equivalent amount of cooked, mashed lentils instead.  After trying it both ways (lentils vs. butter beans) everyone liked the lentils much better!  I also added a little diced green pepper and that REALLY enhanced the flavor, and I omitted the jalapeno pepper (don't like spice).  I make this recipe ALL THE TIME, and we never get tired of it!!!!!!!!!!!

This is a fabulous recipe. It can get a little messy when cooking, as it's not "binded" well with crackers, so i now use fresh italian breadcrumbs, instead. You can also dip it in cornmeal if you want a bit of a crunchy outside. It's loaded with protein, and is delicious as a burger on fresh bread!

Something different.  Changes (of course): 
1) Used black beans.
2) 1/4 cup bread crumbs instead of saltines
3) italian cheese blend instead of chedder (just because I didn't have cheddar)
4) 1 minced clove of garlic instead of powder
5) Baked for 8 minutes each side at 350Â°.

I'm amazed by some of the reviews of this recipe, where people say they don't like the butter bean burgers--especially if the authors have altered the original recipe (using lentil or black beans instead of butter beans), added ingredients (extra eggs or crackers/bread crumbs), or completely omitted ingredients (e.g. jalapenos) and complained the recipe lacks flavor.  Others complained that the recipe yielded "mushy" burgers; perhaps it was BAKING them, instead of frying them as directed in the instructions.  These reviews are without merit.

I encourage you to try the recipe as it in its orignal form.  I have made this several times following the directions.  Friends, family and I and enjoy it tremendously.   If you follow the recipe exactly as it is provided, you'll find a flavorful vegetarian burger that is slightly crispy on the outside and moist in the center.   I think you'll like it.

These are fantastic! I omitted the cheese and jalepeno (my kids were eating as well), used fresh garlic and 1/4c. of bread crumbs instead of crackers. After I shaped the patties I dredged them in dried bread crumbs and let them sit in the fridge for several hours. Had no problems keeping them together in the pan and they are very pretty to boot. The best veggie burger I've had so far.

These are absolutely delicious! The first time I made them, I used butter beans. Then, when I went to the grocery store to buy ingredients to make them again, I bought lima beans by mistake. I made them with the limas and they were just as good! My husband liked them better.

These were really good. I didn't have butter or lima beans in the house, so I used black beans instead. I added cayenne to the mixture for a little kick and topped the burger with taco sauce. Nice healthy lunch!

i liked these alot, i think others were a little put off by the fact that they were made of beans, but they still ate them! i added alot more jalapeno and onion. also used breadcrumbs instead of cracker crumbs, because that is just what i had. have made these twice-- pay attention to your mixture, if it is not adherent enough you can always add another egg, or if too gooey add more crumbs. fried them in canola oil and served with ketchup. thumbs up!

The burger's turned out really good but the cooking time is 6-8 mintues per side. That way they have a nice golden layer. A nice varation was adding pesto to them and not garlic powder but garlic.

These were delicious. I've never been a fan of butterbeans (lima's on steroids) but somehow ended up with several cans of them in the pantry. 
These were really tasty and even better the next day. I stopped eating meat a while ago and I'm always looking for new recipes to add to my files and this one is a keeper. Even my meat eating husband and kids liked this and said they would gladly eat it again.
I did lightly dredge the patties in flour and let them sit for awhile before frying them, and I also added an extra clove of garlic. Thank you for a quick, and easy recipe! **I have made these MANY times since I originally reviewed it and I can tell you that they are equally delicious with Black beans, pintos, limas..even garbanzos. I have experimented with different spices (like making an italian version to use as a substitute for chicken parmesan) and they have all been just great. This is a great recipe on its own, or as a base..and they freeze BEAUTIFULLY!"

These burgers are excellent!  I couldn't bear to fry these healthy burgers in oil.  Instead I put them in the oven on a sprayed cookie sheet for 7-10 minutes each side at 400 degrees.  Turned out great!

When I make any burger like this I always make a whole batch then freeze them.They are so much easier to grill when frozen first.You will not have that problem of them falling apart.

This is a great recipe to use as a guide. I changed the ingredients to match our taste and what was on hand. My wife loved them! Here is what I changed. The rest was the same:  1 can chick peas (butter beans) 1/2 tsp of onion powder (fresh) 3 Tbls Italian bread crumbs (saltines) 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper (jalepeno) 1/4 cup olive oil (veg. oil)  I cooked them in a non stick skillet with just 2 tbls of olive oil.

These were a nice change from a traditional ground beef burger.  As other reviewers suggested- sub 1/4 cup bread crumbs for the saltine crackers as it helps the burgers hold together better.  Also- unless you really do not care for it, do not leave out the jalepeno- the burgers are a little too bland without it.  Thanks for sharing the recipe, Silverwolf!  I enjoyed changing things up a bit.

I was surprised by how good these were.  I used black beans instead of butter beans and they were delicious.  The next day we didn't have any more buns so my husband made these with tortillas and they were great that way too.  We'll be adding this to our menu frequently.

Awesome! My family is not vegetarian - but we LOVED this recipe. I thought they were better than regular hamburgers. My husband said that he "wouldn't go that far" - but that he really thought they were tasty and wants me to make them again and again. He even passed the recipe on to one of his buddies at work. This is a must try! I followed the recipe as written - except I used pickled jalapenos and added some bread crumbs as needed to help the patties stay together.

These are the most delicious veggie burgers! The flavors work really well together. I've been making them on a regular basis, and get lots of compliments. i like to serve them on a toasted sesame roll with a low-fat chipotle mayo, baby greens, and sliced red tomato, and a side of baked sweet potato french fries

I did do many changes but these are fabulous. I think since I made changes and still loved it it deserves 5 stars. My changes where I used white beans, I couldn't find butter and then once home it dawned on me I should have looked in the organic/health food area of the grocery. I also didn't want to buy more cheese so I used Colby Jack that I had and I don't like jalapeno so I used canned green chilies. I doubled the garlic powder too. Then I baked in the oven rather than pan fry. I loved these and can't wait to make them again and I will find the butter beans but keep to all the changes I made. Well maybe I will buy cheddar next time.

Wowee!  This was sooo good and very different.  I followed everything pretty closely, but I did saute the onions first, and use bread crumbs instead of crackers as recommended.  I did 6 minutes on a side medium-high heat in about 5 tbsp of olive oil and they came out crispy and delicious :)

Very tasty!  everyone loved these.  I made the recipe as directed but used 2T of oil instead and actually think I could have used less - using a non-stick pan helps.  I did stick them in the freezer for about 10 minutes so they held better in the pan.  I think next time (later today!) I will make these into 6 patties that are thinner so its crispier and firmer throughout.  If you deseed and rib the jalapeno there really isn't a lot of heat.  Let them sit in the pan w/out flipping for a while so you get a nice crust.  I covered the pan part of the time to help the inside cook a little.  Nutrition fact using 2T of oil instead are: 249 cals, 14g fat, 22 carbs, 4 g fiber and 11.5 g protien.  These are pretty filling and I liked them w/o the bun which saved some calories.  Thank you for the recipe!

I don't know what went wrong, but after cooking the burgers I could not get them to resemble anything beyond a puddle of slop. I followed the recipe exactly, but to no avail.

This is our favorite veggie burger recipe.  I've made it lots of times with several different kinds of crackers and they've always come out yummy.

I always dredge the burgers in cornmeal and chill in the fridge for a while before cooking and they never fall apart on me.

These burgers taste great.  I used whole wheat homemade bread crumbs instead of the crackers, because that is what I had. Even my 4 year old liked them and she doesn't like beans!

Awesome though the oil made them very greasy but soooo yummy. Going to try cooking them on the George Foreman Grill next time to reduce the oil that soaks into them.

These were good! This recipe can be made vegan by omitting the cheese and using the following instead of an egg: 2tbsp corn starch mixed with 1 tbsp water. I sauteed the onions with diced red and green bell peppers in place of the jalapenos. I used 6 saltines and did not have a problem forming these into patties or flipping them in the frying pan. They did not crumble like other reviewers stated. I fried each patty in only 1 tsp of olive oil. They were surprisingly delicious, and so much better than frozen veggie patties!

Let me start by saying we are serious meat eaters.. and these were AWESOME!  I didn't have any problems with the burgers staying together.  I did tweak it a bit.  I replaced the saltines with app. 1/2 cup italian bread crumbs, used fresh garlic, and I grated about 1/3 of an onion instead of chopping- adds a lot more flavor and uses a lot less of the onion.  Just make sure to squeeze some of the liquid from the grated onion so patties aren't too loose.  Also, we left out the cheese.  I didn't mash the beans too much so they still had some texture.  Also, I dusted with a little cornmeal before placing in the skillet and barely used any oil to cook them in - maybe a tablespoon or less in a non-stick skillet.  We topped them with crispy coleslaw which added some nice CRUNCH!  I figured this recipe cost welll under $2.00 to make.  Can't beat the price and the taste is delicious!!

Really good! I added a dash of worcestershire sauce in mine and some red pepper flakes for spiciness. Yummy! Thanks for a good bean patty recipe!

So in all honesty, I'd give the taste a 5 and the texture a 2. I doubled the recipe and tried frying 1/2 and baking 1/2... neither batch stayed together :( but the taste is awesome! I use fresh garlic and added fresh parsley. Yum! Since I can't get it to stay together as a burger I think I'll double and bake as a veggie meatloaf from now on. You really can use any bean, cheese, or binder and it will taste good.

Very good, although I changed a couple of things. I used panko bread crumbs instead of crackers. I omitted the cheese because I didn't have any. I added a fourth of a teaspoon onion powder. I let the mixture sit in the fridge for a few hours before forming the burgers (which helped a lot). And finally, I dipped the burgers in corn meal before frying. I served them on lightly toasted sesame seed buns with mayo, tomato slices and lettuce. They were delicious. Even the pickiest eater in the house liked 'em!

AMAZING! only a few changes... used fresh garlic instead of powdered, italian breadcrumbs instead of saltines  (coated with a mix of italian breadcrumbs&panko), and tossed a few jalepeno rings&strips of fresh red pepper into the food processor and then mixed into batter. it turned out awesome!

These looked really nice, and smelled really good, but they just didn't taste that great. I was disappointed, but I may try making them again using more spices and additions.

These had good flavor.  Did they mimic a burger?  No.  They were a little dry.  Could be that the ratio of crackers was too high.  Trying to figure out how to make them "juicy".    Changes:  Used 1 T of butter rather than 1/4 c. of oil.

These were really nice. Minor changes made after reading other reviews: Used a clove of fresh garlic, 1/4 cup Italian breadcrumbs. After shaping I patted more bread crumbs on patties and refrigerated for a few hours. No issues with patties falling apart. My son said it tasted like mashed potato (that wasn't a complaint). Very mild flavor which can be suited according to one's own taste. Will certainly be making these again. Perhaps will try baking them next time as I don't like to fry - that was the only reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5. Thanks for sharing!

These are delicious and super easy to make. I'm a vegetarian and I get sick of eating the same tasteing things all the time, but this is very flavorful. I'm 15 years old and I found this very easy to make, so I'm sure it would be a wiz to more experienced chiefs. The only thing I didn't do was add the jalapeno, and that was simply because I didn't have that. Great recipe!!

This is a tasty burger, but I did have a hard time forming/keeping the patties together.  I didn't fry them, I just brushed each one with some olive oil and baked it for 15 minutes at 400.  Thanks for a nice alternative to the black bean burgers I've been making :)

WOW!!! These were incredible! My boyfriend and I really loved them! The recipe is a good base for a great burger. Needs some tweaking. 

I was able to flip the burgers easily. I just made sure to make a tight patty first.

Combining suggestions from previous reviewers, I edited the recipe in the following ways:  

-Sub 1/2 cup breadcrumbs for crackers 
-Used less oil than described -Shredded part of the onion, soaked up oil water so they weren't wet...had to chop the rest because i couldn't shred it all 
-Used fresh garlic  

I also made some other changes:  -Added some fresh parsley I had on hand -Used feta instead of cheddar  -Mashed the beans half way so I could still see some beans

I cooked this in Ex virgin olive oil, and it stuck to the pan. One of the patties fell apart as I flipped them over. So, I will do what another reviewer said, and add breadcrumbs next time. I didn't think my husband would like it, but he loved it! Good, cheap meal! I put it in a bun, and topped it with guacamole. Yummy and very filling!

Wow - I'm so surprised by how much I love this! Like many others, I ended up making this into a Black Bean Burger, only because I couldn't find butter beans in our store (? I need to find out what other name they go by - my husband thinks lima beans...) - Anyhow, I made exactly as written, except used black beans, Italian breadcrumbs (no saltines on hand)and a sprinking of taco seasoning, let sit in the fridge to firm up as others suggested, coated with more breadcrumbs and served with homemade salsa on top. Loved it so much I turned around and made another batch, this time experimenting by adding a splash of lime juice and some fresh chopped spinach (haven't tasted it yet.) LOVE this - thanks for the submission! (update: couldn't wait - tried the tweaked batch tonight - great! Also wonderful served with the No Guilt Zesty Ranch dip from this site as a condiment)

These were good, and would be open to some nice interpretations, as butter beans are pretty much a good neutral base.  Next time I make these, (and I will make these again), I will add some cilantro and scallions instead of the onions.  A nice dollop of pico de gallo on top would finish it off nicely too.  Mmmmm, can't wait.

These were pretty good, but I need to work on the seasoning because they were a little bland.  I used green onions and replaced the jalapenos with green chilis.  I also used bread crumbs in place of the saltines.  After I made the patties, I coated the outside in more bread crumbs mixed with parmesean cheese and then baked as others suggested.  If nothing else they made me realize that I really like butter beans! haha

These were better than expected and my 4 year old loved them! Followed recipe except eliminated jalapeno pepper and used fresh bread crumbs in lieu of crackers.  Next time I may add bell pepper in place of jalapeno.

Don't know what I did wrong, but this mixture fell apart in my skillet. I used black beans in an attempt to make it look more like real burgers. In a last ditch effort to salvage the mix, added 1 1/2 t. chili powder and 1/2 t. cumin, and served it in soft tortillas. It tasted OK but I won't make it again.

I was pleasantly surprised with how much my husband enjoyed these burgers!  I used bread crumbs instead of saltine crackers (since I didn't have any on hand) and baked them at 350 degrees for about 10-12 minutes per side.   Oh, and I added some red pepper flakes instead of jalapeno peppers.

These were great.  Had to rethink my cookiong becuase my sister needs to eat better less greasy foods.  So I baked these in the over instead of frying in oil.  Turned out nice. Also used bread crumbs instead of crackers.  Thanks for the recipe.

I gave this 4 stars because they were really tasty. After reading a lot of reviews, I added an extra egg and almost doubled the amount of crumbs, but they still fell apart when I cooked them and were very greasy.  I found a solution though. I tried microwaving them individually on a plate that I had sprayed with non-stick cooking spray. This firmed them up enough to transfer to a LIGHTLY oiled skillet and quickly brown both sides. Using an ice cream scoop to measure out the mixture and flattening it out gave me perfect, bun-sized patties. Thanks, Silverwolf, for a great recipe!

These are very tasty, I used canola oil, and inadvertently put about 1/4 cup in the bean mixture! I think that will be standard, as it probably adds to the flavour and helps hold the burgers together.  Will for sure make these again. Might try using quick oats instead of saltines for a healthier option.

Very good.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I let the burgers hang out in the fridge for about an hour before cooking - and they held together very well.  I will make them again without a bun - they are tasty all on their own.

Awesomness. Hm, I just wonder why so many people didn't use butter beans but some other bean? Wouldn't that be a totally different recipe? Well, it was the first time that I've ever tried this bean, and they are aptly named-- they have a richness to them, which makes them perfect for this burger! I followed exactly, except adding chopped garlic, chilli powder, giving them a little breadcrumb crust, and I made 6, instead of 4. Yay, love it when there's more of something I like:) Definitely should have tried refrigerating them after forming--that's a great idea. Oh, I used about 3 TB of olive oil because I wanted them to brown nicely, but made sure to let some of the oil drain out by placing them on paper towels after cooking. I'd say 8-9 min on med. high heat is better.

IMO, not a bad burger.  It seemed to be laking something, or maybe it was because it was made with beans and not meat.  I am going to try it again, but I will try it with bread crumbs as suggested by others.  Also, I may try adding some rice to give a little bulk.  All in all, not bad. Thanks

These were pretty good.. I wouldn't go as far as "amazing" though. Mine came out a little bit dry, next time I might add another egg or reserve some of the bean liquid? I used bread crumbs instead of crackers, and added a small amt. of crushed red pepper. They were not as spicy as I expected, actually. I also baked these (healthier) with a bread crumb/chili powder topping.  Baked @ 350, they took about 8-10 mins to cook per side.

These are great.  My husband and son (non-vegetarians) love these.  I wouldn't put them in the food processor, makes them too mushy and don't hold together well.  Just mash the butter beans up lightly(get pre-seasoned ones, more flavor) and add the other ingredients.  After forming them, coat in cornmeal and put in the fridge for about and hour.  They should hold up well that way.  I like them without a bun, but my family likes with vidalia onion, a little mayo and mustard.  Yum!

Excellent flavor and easy to make.  However, these must be dredged in flour prior to frying otherwise they will fall apart and be a gooey mess!

Very good.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time.  Good, but not "meaty" enough.  Needs a more substantial bean than butter beans.  The second time around I followed the advice of some other commenters and used black beans instead of butter beans.  Much, much better.  I also added a little bit of cayenne and worchestershire sauce.  We do this meal every couple of weeks.

I thought this was a fantastic recipe. I also love the fact that these are noth "trying" to be meat. The flavor is fabulous. I made this recipe exactly to the recipe and it was pretty good. However, now I add 1 tsp of fresh thyme, 1 tsp of fresh rosemary. Sometimes I use bread crumbs vs. the saltines, and I don't notice a dramatic difference. I ALWAYS use 2 eggs though. That fixes any issue of them falling apart or being mushy. There is also no need to use 1/4 cup oil. I only use a few tbsp.

I wish I could give this recipe a zero! I don't know why it got such rave reviews. As soon as I went to fry them, the first 2 fell apart completely in the oil.  The second 2 that stayed together took 15 minutes to cook, and when eaten were crunchy on the outside and a mushy rice pudding consistancy on the inside. I was dissapointed and disgusted. If you like something that just tastes like fried and nothing else, go for it.

I do not have much experience frying but I had to give this a try since I like beans so much and I am glad I did.  The pattie stayed together perfectly and was not at all greasy! Used flax flakes instead of crackers and dipped them in a mixture of cornmeal and cayenne pepper for a little extra crunch and spice. Served with a salad for dinner and also in sandwiches the next day for lunch, great both ways!!

This is a great recipe, which I changed ever so slightly.  I used bread crumbs instead of crackers, olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and parmesan cheese.  I also made my patties very thin and served them on French bread rolls.  Really delicious-- my picky husband even thought so. This recipe is a keeper for sure.

AWESOME! I used white navy beans, no hot peppers and used half cheddar half Parmesan! It was awesome! My 2 year old crumbled crackers while i chopped it was so fun, and my husband said they reminded him of white castle! This is definitely a recipe to change and make your own!

Love love these! I have never made them with jalapenos in them and when I first started to make them I use bread crumbs last few times follow with Crackers as the Recipe calls for. If you add an Extra egg to the Mix and let the Patties set in the Fridge for about 2 hours ahead before frying they will not fall apart. Plus Hot sauce instead of the Japs are great with it too.  I've been thinking of rolling them into Balls and frying in a deep fryer sometime to see how they come out.

Followed the recipe exactly. Burgers came out great. They are pretty floppy at first, but after a couple minutes in the oil, they hold their shape well. I thought they might burn, but 5 mins per side is pretty dead on. When done, the outside is a nice crispy texture (almost like the outside of a fried tenderloin), the inside is pretty mushy... but it's beans and it wasn't off-putting. They were not too spicy with the minced jalapeno either.

These are delicious! I'm not usually a fan of bean burgers, but this one is a winner in my book! I usually just use bread crumbs in place of the crackers, and olive oil instead of veg. These have turned me into a bean burger lover! Thanks for sharing!

I am now a believer!, I loved this more than any vegie burger.  I used a can of seasoned butter beans with regular bread crumbs. I had no problem with it forming. I fried it in just about 2 TBS of oil.  I had to turn it down to medium heat because it was starting to burn. I topped it with a tomato and served it on allrecipes tasty buns.  Try it, you'll like it.

My husband is a vegetarian, but I am not and we both love these burgers. I try to make them pretty thin (about 3/4 of an inch or so) so they'll have a crispier outside (and not such a soft, thick inside). I also add more jalapeno since we love spicy things. Just a great, easily tweaked recipe! These are wonderful served just like a regular hambuger! Thank you!

My kids loved these.  We took a reviews suggestion and put them in the frig for a few hours.  That did seem to keep them together.  We breaded them too but because we did that the baking them did not work.  We had to fry in oil so the breading didn't make them all dried up.  I am going to try not breaded, in the oven next.  I would love to keep these more healthy by not frying them.

I loved these, just had a hard time getting them to stick together, they kept falling apart, but that is my only complaint, the flavor is delicious and being vegetarian, these are perfect for when I make turkey burgers for the rest of my family!

These were ok. They really needed more salt than I put in and something else since they were kind of bland. When I make these again I'll add more garlic powder, salt, and then maybe some onion powder.

Very cool, I love burgers not made from soy, quorn, or some other fake stuff but you don't come across them often. I can never exactly follow a recipe exactly but this one I did with all the same ingredients minus the measuring cup. It turned out great except just a little too oily. I used olive oil, safflower oil, and sesame oil to flavor. Still great, but I think next time I may brush it with oil and take the recommendation of baking it instead of frying. I am also anxious to see how the frozen ones turn out.  Thanks

These were really good. I made them in nice firm thicker patties coated them in flour & let them sit on the fridge for an hour or so. I heated some oil & carefully turn them after I knew one side was nice & crispy & I didn't have any problems with them falling apart.

First time I have submitted a review because I love these.  Just made the changes that were suggested (used 1/2 cup of cracker crumbs & dry bread crumbs). Hubby liked them & for them to have no meat in it that was incredible.  Thanks for the recipe.  I want to make them again very soon.

These burgers were fantastic! I used black beans and they turned out great. I think the color of the beas made the burgers look more like meat, which my 10 year old liked.

I loved this burger.  It had a crispy outer layer and great taste.  My boyfriend and I enjoyed it with a Baked Pineapple recipe on this site.  This is a keeper as part of my vegetarian day meals!

Ahh, the butter bean patty :) What can i say about those? lol, i didnt know what butter beans were until i went on a wild goose chase trying to find them at grocery stores and FINALLY coming across them in a CAN.. Believe the look on my face when i find them in a CAN and all along i was looking for dried beans called BUTTER BEANS! But at least after all the looking, the butter bean patty didnt let me down :) it was good and tasteful, i may have added a pinch more of seasonings, but all in all... 1 and a half thumbs up! :)

These were very good! I used some seasoned bread crumbs instead of the crackers because I didn't have any. I also omitted the cheese because I was planning on topping these with some cottage cheese. It was a very nice little lunch :)

Personaly I thought this turned out great...we threw them on the grill. I found mashing the beans too hard so I put them in my food processo than added all the ingredients. For the grill they were a bit too gooey so I added the whole package of saltine crackers. Turned out fabulous! Plan to put this in my KEEP box

These were so tasty! I trusted the submitter's choice of butter beans and other ingredients and am glad I did. The only changes I made was substituting Ritz crackers for saltines and used over 12 (I lost count) and real garlic for the powder. My first few were really difficult to flip or get off the pan so I covered the pan with a lid the second time around it and seemed to distribute the heat more evenly and seemed to solve the problem. I also followed other reviewers' advice and just kept adding crumbs until it felt like they were the right consistency. I'll be making these again!

I doubled the recipe and added and extra egg as it seemed dry. As previously suggested....I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of saltines....made into patties and chilled in freezer for 1/2 hour before cooking. Also...used 2 cups of sharp cheddar.   Made them because my veggie daughter was here for the weekend, but...everyone loved them. Will be a regular in this house!

The first time I made this, they fell apart and it was a disaster!  The second time though, it was absolutely delicious.  The key is to make sure that you drain the beans *completely* so no liquid is left at all.  I put them in a colander and shook them out a bit.  I also doubled the amount of crackers and used Ritz.  Drop them in when the oil is nice and hot and they stay together.  Good with chile peppers or bell peppers!

Great, and so easy!  Most veggie burger recipes have twenty ingredients and require tons of prep, but these came together in 15 minutes.  I added extra jalapeno - all of a large one, seeded - and it was delicious.  I'd suggest doing as another reviewer did and covering them as you cook to help them hold together better; mine did fall apart a bit but they were fine in the end.  I served them on Portuguese rolls with avocado, red onion and tomato.  The fella ate two!  EDIT:  I still love these, and the fella asks for them often.  I always add the whole jalepeno, and contrary to what I said before, the secret to getting them to stick together is to use a lot of oil and fry the heck out of them (uncovered).  Which is how Silverwolf recommended they be made in the first place, after all!

These were sooo good! I doubled the recipe and that made 6 burgers. Followed the recipe, except added a few more crackers since it was a little too wet. Held together beautifully! Also fried them in olive oil. Make sure not to over brown. My 12 year old would have never touched them if he knew they had butter beans in them so I didn't tell him and he loved them! This is a keeper!

I didn't have jalapenos on hand, but I used 1 onion, 1 leek (left over from another recipe), and 5 cloves of garlic. (I also doubled the recipe) I sauteed the onion, leek, and garlic in 2 tbsp margarine until soft and then mixed in with all other ingredients. I made the burgers thin and served on fresh potato bread rolls with fat free Miracle Whip, red onion, and tomato, german potato salad, and corn on the cob. Doubling the recipe made enough burgers for me to freeze about 6 and have another 6 on hand for the next few days. Will definitely make again. Thank you so much for this recipe.

Wow!! These were so good. Took a few suggestions from prior reviews. Used chopped red pepper instead of jalapeno,2 eggs, 1/2C-3/4c Italian flavored breadcrumbs, also coated the patties in bread crumbs, and chilled in fridge for 1/2 hour before frying. I also added some Penzey's chipotle chili powder for a mild, but tasty kick. Mixture was gooey, but firmed up nicely after chilling. This will definitely be a "regular" at the table.

These were OK.  A bit on the bland side, so I added some salsa to my bun for more zip.  You can't flip these without them falling apart.  Perhaps mroe bread crumbs would help.

These are so good, and can be soooo much healthier and diet friendly too! I used egg substitute, less cheese (part skim mozz.) italian bread crumbs instead of crackers, and used the George Foreman to cook them with just a spray of olive oil cooking spray! Just don't try to flip them or they might come apart.

I made this last night and it was a hit with the kids. I had a fluke with one can of butter beans I opened the can and there was only 3 butter beans in the can. So I used one can of butter beans and a can of garbanzo (chick peas) beans. I used bread crumb and egg replacer. I used seasoned flour on the outside next time I will use cornmeal but I did not have any. I will also increase the jalapeno peppers. I made half with cheese and half without cheese. My youngest put BBQ sauce on his. My oldest ate his with ketchup and I put ketchup on mine and also honey. I love the flavor honey adds to it. ADDITIONAL COMMENTS 7/17/09 I have really added a twist to this recipe I dust mine with Fish Fry Mix with lemon and then fry. I stopped dusting with seasoned flour. I then serve on top a bed of garlic pasta and add a sauce such as Mango Ginger and Habanero on top the burger. Also if I do not have butter beans, garbanzo beans (chick peas) work great. My family really loves this recipe.

I made these for my vegetarian daughters.  Used leftover brown rice instead of saltines and omited the jalepeno.  They were delicious and reheated fine the next day.

My family was impressed as I'm trying to get them excited about more vegetarian meals in our home.  I sent my husband to get a couple cans of butter beans and he came back with "seasoned butter beans" with onions.  I wasn't sure but tried it anyway following the recipe pretty closely.  The only other changes I made was to make it less sloppy by adding more bread crumbs and coating the patties in crumbled salt-n-pepper kettle chips for crispiness.  My husband wanted more, my 12 year old son appreciated his hunger being satisfied but didn't want seconds.  But this is also coming from the kid who, for years, thought being a vegetarian meant only eating hotdogs.  We'll be having this again.  Thank you!

very good, substituted dry bread crumbs and real garlic. Added about 1/3 c of frozen corn. Best homemade veggie burger I have made. Froze two patties to eat for a quick lunch.

these were delicious!!  they have a great taste and texture.  i added diced green peppers  and dipped them in cornmeal, like others suggested.  i froze them, too, since i live alone, and they seemed to heat up just fine if i put them in the toaster and then in the microwave (although a toaster oven would have been ideal).

I used a food processor which might have been a mistake, because they came out a bit mushy and soaked up a lot of oil when fried. My husband liked the flavor much more than I did, but (more importantly!) my 2-year old devoured them.

Tried these last evening for dinner.  My husband thoroughly enjoyed them.  I did add more cracker crumbs/bread crumbs and used less oil for cooking.  They browned up nice!  Served with a stir-fry of zuchinni, yellow squash and onion. A great low carb meal.  I will try other beans for variation in the future.  Thanks for an easy, no fuss recipe that can be altered to taste!

Excellent !!  I love this burger. I bought a black bean burger at Grand Central Station's Food Market before and found extremely dry (and expensive).  This recipe is by far better.  I wanted to make it more Mexican, so I added    chopped cilantro(1.5 tablespoon) and a pinch of cumin powder. I also coated them with corn flour before grilling for a bit crisp result. It went very well with a mango salsa.  I am sure I will make this again soon.

Pretty good!  My 11 yr old ate two which if you knew  him, says alot.  Next time he asked me to add alittle more cheese.  I didn't use as much oil as called for.  I used a nonstick skillet sprayed with Pam.  I think I used 1 tbsp of oil -- max. I also didn't have crackers so I substituted italian bread crumbs.  Everything was great!  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was very tasty with a few modifications. As previously suggested, I used bread crumbs instead of crackers. I had to omit the jalapenos, so my tots could eat them. I, also, added veggie worcester as suggested in a previous review. I fried in a nonstick pan without as much oil, too. The whole family enjoyed them.

I made these butter bean burgers tonight, and they are really good! I followed the recipe for most part but instead used bread crumbs and added fresh sautÃ©ed  garlic, bell pepper, and onion. I also added some cilantro to the mix. I fried 2 of the patties and baked the rest of the mix - just to see if there is a big difference. Both are good, if you want to be healthier,  bake them in a well oiled pan for about 8 mins per side at 350 degrees. The burgers didn't stick to either pan and they held together beautifully :) This recipe is a keeper!

These were delicious. Because I was making them for my kids, I omitted the jalapenos and added fresh parsley, otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and they were buttery and crispy - yum. My daughter ate it without the bun! Who knew! Will definitely make again.

Excellent recipe. Will try with breadcrumbs next time. I used less onion than what it called for. Also the only problem was it didn't hold together very well and always breaks apart while I was trying to flip the burger. Will also try to bake the burgers instead of fry.

This one is a keeper. I took some suggestions from other reviewers like using bread crumbs instead of crackers and coating them with breadcrumbs and letting them sit in the fridge for a few hours.

Because of some digestion issues I have I omitted the jalapeno pepper and browned the onions before adding them. Just for fun I added a few dashes of liquid smoke. I have to stay away from fried foods so I put them in an iron skillet coated with nonstick spray in a 400 gas oven for ten minutes on each side. They turned out wonderful, with a slightly crunchy coating on the outside while moist and tender on the inside.

I have made lima bean burgers but this recipe was great because butter beans are so soft and meaty tasting. I followed the recipe exactly but I could see how you could modify it in a lot of ways to make your own unique version. I used red pepper & garlic jelly, and mayo as the only condiments. The red pepper jelly was a perfect compliment.

Fantastically easy to make and delicious though sometimes they do tend to fall apart a little.  Like a previous poster suggested, I dip mine in cornmeal before frying or baking.  Both ways are delicious!

Great recipe, i made this with about 1/2 butter beans and the other 1/2 a mix of pinto and kidney.

They came out amazing, although they all fell apart, next time i'm not using the oil, it made the mix too mushy.

Easily the best "veggieburgers" I've ever had. Even my fiance, who isn't vegetarian, loved them! He says that they taste like crabcakes.

These were really yummy tasting, but they didnt stay together very well while cooking and were extremely oily. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil...but other than that followed the recipe exactly. Next time I will probably follow suggestions to use either extra saltines, or bread crumbs, and bake them instead of frying.

I saw all the 4 and 5 star ratings but was still skeptical.  Tried these last night and they were quite good. The family loved them. I topped mine with mustard but the rest of the family topped theirs with chipolte ranch dressing.

These are so good that I've been craving them ever since I first made them.  Our only issue with these was that "burger" is kind of a stretch... we tried to eat these on buns with all the burger fixins and they just squished out the side of the bun every bite we took.  The taste was incredible though!  It was a good knife and fork "burger," but next time I'll probably go bun-less! :)  I might try half beans half lentils to see if that firms them up a little more.  Update: Cooked down some dried lima beans and also cooked some lentils.  So I made half and half burgers.  YUM!  I also froze the leftover burgers and today we got them out of the freezer and put them right in the hot oil.  I actually burned them a little bit because I was afraid the middle wouldn't defrost, but they came out with a nice crispy cornmeal crust and hot insides.  Super quick and easy if you make them ahead and go freezer-to-frying-pan! Update #2: I've played around with these so much and I've decided they're pretty much fool-proof.  My favorite add-in is cooked brown rice.  They give these some texture and stick-to-your-ribs-ness that is really good.  I've never omitted the cheese, but I can't really taste it, so I think you could save yourself some calories and fat by taking it out.  I simply love these burgers.  It's a shame my husband doesn't feel the same way.

Very yummy with an excellent creamy texture! I used fresh garlic, Italian bread crumbs (instead of crackers as was suggested by others) and it was GOOD! I will make it again :-)

me and my roommate just made this recipe and fell in love! we never cook anything and this was cheap and easy enough even for us to handle... we did use black beans instead of butter beans (just because we like black beans more) and added red pepper for some extra flavor... we also used plain bread crumbs instead of saltines because that was all we had... the consistency was perfect and held together well... we decided that this will be a weekly staple in our diets!

These were really good.  I used garbanzo beans and pureed them in the blender before adding all other ingredients. I thought they needed more garlic & also added some curry.  Overall a great versatile recipe that can be adjusted to taste!  Thanks for posting :)

I added some cumin and coated the burgers with cornmeal.  Not bad.  I like habanero sauce with mine.  Still doesn't replace a true hamburger, which I doubt is the purpose of this particular meal, I couldn't help but think about a hamburger while eating this.  For a meat eater (humanely raised only) I would suggest not comparing this sandwhich to a burger and just enjoy it as is.

A good recipe for any leftover beans. I used leftover lima beans in mine.  I put green chili's instead of the jalapeno ones because my husband can't eat them.  I thought they were good.  Would never serve over/with a bun tho.  Way to much starch.  The bean burgers are great as a "side" or as the main dish.  My husband on the other hand took a bite and was looking for the trash can. HA. But they are good!  COOKING TIP:  try taking two spatulas to turn your bugers (or any thing) put one on the back and one on top.  When you flip the burgers it rest on the additional spatula and truns easily.

This was not a favorite for us.  However, we are not used to eating meatless burgers.  Also, I thought it had a better flavor before cooking.  My daughters liked it ok.  But I found that the largest problem was the difficulty of keeping the mixture together, particularly while flipping.  I was careful, so they did not fall apart completely, but it wasn't easy.

the use of most kinds of bean will work with this if you mash it enough. and almost anything can be made to taste edible if you add enough seasoning to it.

In all fairness to this recipe, the flavor was fine but I just didn't like the texture of these burgers. I used breadcrumbs instead of crackers, but otherwise made as directed. I won't make again, but if you need to prepare a meal for vegetarian friends this probably a good choice.

I LOVED THESE!  I also used Black Bean and sauteed the onion which made it better.  I left out the jalapenos and loved them.  I also added 1/8 C parmesan cheese.  I put VERY little oil in the bottom of the skillet and fried them. There is no need for that much oil. I have not been enjoying Morning Star Garden Burgers asmuch lately.  I think  they must have changed the recipe. These will be my new substitute.   My 3 yr old son LOVES them as well.  I make them on a slice of bread or a hamburger bun add BBQ sauce and some more cheddar cheese.  YUMMO

WOW this is good! I couldn't flip the "burgers" so I put it all in a casserole dish, sprayed with PAM, and baked it for 30 mins at 400. It tastes amazing! I didn't use the oil so that cuts down A LOT of the calories - and makes it stick ;) Also, I used 1/2c panko breadcrumbs instead of crackers as I didn't have any.

They didn't bind at all with the recipe as is. If I make these again, I will follow some of the other users' suggestions.

Awesome...with some changes of course. I used two eggs instead of one and more crackers than suggested. I also didn't add jalepenos (I don't like crunchy food), but I added red pepper flakes and cumin. I let patties sit in the fridge for about a half hour too before cooking. Will definitely make again.

These are very tasty.  I do add adjust the amount of crackers as needed to make a formable mix.  I do not add the cheese and use egg substitute to make them vegan.  We have added this recipe to our rotation!

This recipe was a great inspiration. I read it and immediately knew I didn't have many of the ingredients. I substituted the lima beans for black beans, saltine crackers for ritz crackers, jalapeno for green pepper, and cheddar for mozzarella. I also added 1 egg white because my mixture was not binding like I thought it should. In addition to the garlic powder I threw in some ranch dip mix (the powder). I tried cooking as instructed but I was getting oily bean soup so I used an ice cream scoop to drop the mixture onto a greased cookie sheet and stuck the patties in the oven at 425 for 7 mins then turned the broiler on the crisp them. They were delicious!

the flavor was ok.... but they are extremely hard to fry. I ended up with mush. sounds crazy but if you leave the crackers and eggs out it could be worked out to make mashed faux-tatos.

These were a little tricky but really yummy. I doubled the crackers because it was pretty sloppy and I made them thin to avoid a mushy middle. Unfortunately, the thinness made it hard to taste when put on the bun. I even added feta instead of cheddar to puch up the flavor. I will definately make these again but either double up the patties or serve them open face. I wouldn't be too keen on eating them just as the meat in a meal though, maybe with something on top--guac, salsa, melted cheese, etc.--they may be able to stand on their own. Thanks for sharing!

These were pretty good. After reading reviews that they could be bland, I used 1/4 cup italian bread crumbs in place of crackers, a dash each of hot sauce and cayenne, and added a couple pinches of cumin and chicken broth powder. I made them into small patties, coated them in corn meal and baked them at 350 until crispy (about 30 mins, flipping periodically). Next time, I will coat them in bread crumbs, make larger patties like the recipe calls for, and saute them in a skillet, as I think the oven dried the center out more. I dipped the little patties in ranch. There's room for improvement here, and I'll try them with lentils or other beans, just to mix it up next time. Thanks for the recipe!

These were pretty good - I think they could use some additional spices/flavors or maybe an aioli or flavored yogurt sauce to accompany them.

I made these exactly as written & liked them, but it seemed that the burger was almost the same consistency as the bun. I froze leftovers & had them one night, heated in a skillet on the stove. Didn't use a bun, instead dipped them in BBQ sauce & they were incredible. Next time I'll make a double batch. Thanks for posting the unusual & awesome recipe!

I have made this several times since I discovered it. You can use bread crumbs or cracker crubs. It's great alongside a salad. My fiance, who hates any meal without meat, loved them!

Yum! These are great. Very quick and easy. I used celery instead of onion, and a banana pepper instead of jalapeno. Other than that, I followed the recipe. Since I don't have any burger buns, I just made a little sauce of plain yogurt and feta cheese. Really good with corn on the cob and cucumber salad. Thanks for the recipe!

I'm torn on this recipe. I followed the directions to a tee and while the flavor is excellent, I hated the texture! It's like eating a creamy, hummus patty! Not my cup of tea... If I can find a way to mod the texture, it's a great recipe. The hubby loved it regardless :)

These burgers are absolutely delicious!! I followed the recipe exactly and could not have been more pleased. I doubled the recipe and it made 8 patties. They are a little difficult to keep together when frying, but they are so worth the effort.

Great flavor! We tried them as presented and they were good. The next time we added cooked brown rice mashed, omitted the crackers, used soft cooked lentils and great northern beans in stead of the butter beans and finished them off with a handful of thinly sliced dried mushrooms and an egg white. A great substitute for cutting down on meat and is an excellent patty all around!

This made a really good side dish. I was inventive with seasonings (seasoned salt, Old Bay and bread crumbs) and let it sit in the fridge for a while to stiffen up a bit before making the patties. I made 4 thin ones so they would fry crisp. My husband wasn't at all warming up to trying this, but said it was surprisingly good when he tasted them. The recipe was good, but it's a bit of work just for butter beans as a side.

It worked really well in a pita with cucumber/yogurt/mint sauce.  To cut out the oil for frying, I tried cooking a couple on foil on the top rack of my gas BBQ grill & that worked pretty well.  It didn't have quite the same crispy crust as the fried ones did, but tasted great once in the pita.

Yowsa! This was tasty! It even smelled good when I was making the patties. It has TONS of flavor and I love the smooth, rich texture in the middle. I made these using Italian bread crumbs instead of the Saltines as some had suggested. I can already think of different ways to serve the mash besides as a burger and I can't wait to try them. I will make these again and again! Thanks Silverwolf!

These were great. I followed the advise of others and put them in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes before cooking. I also used panko crumbs instead of the saltines. They held together well when cooking. Will definitely make these again.

I originally rated this a 3 but came back today to change it to a 4. I don't know if it was being refrigerated overnight or the addition of some mustard (as opposed to being served plain), but it tasted even better the next day. I love the crispiness of the outside, and inside had a nice consistency too.

This was so good! My 23 daughter is a vegetarian and we have tried many bean burger recipes - most were tasty enough but rather dry. This recipe turned out moist and the butter beans give it a wonderful creamy texture without an overpowering "bean" flavor. My twenty year old son ate it and loved it - he actually chose to have a second Butter bean burger instead of barbecued chicken! Note: I used 1/2 cup dry breadcrumbs in place of cracker crumbs.

It was very good, but it was really crumbly!  It didn't want to stick together when frying it at all.  Maybe if I tried in a nonstick pan instead of my cast iron pan.  Or I might try adding more binder, like more crackers or maybe even a little flour.

I've been a vegetarian for 13+ years. Of course I've tried EVERY bean and veggie burger there is. I have to say this is my favorite. It has a subtle flavor with a mild kick from the jalepenos. I was able to get 6 small burgers from the batch so I had to hide them from myself as not to eat them in one day. This has become a regular in my diet. Thank You for sharing Silverwolf!

These were certainly easy to prepare and very good tasting. I didn't have any beans but great northern, and I only had TVP to use for the saltines. They turned out very well, will make again, maybe a little spicier.

This definitely needs more than just 6 crackers, as it was very sloppy.  I added more crackers to be able to form into patties but we still were not impressed with the taste.    Thanks.

Really liked these.  Made some alterations (more seasonings, more breadcrumbs, no jalepeno), but they turned out well.  If you are concerned about flavor, make a small test patty.  Try that, and decide if it's good or needs anything.  I added red pepper flakes and more garlic after my test run.

Used italian bread crumbs instead of saltines, fried in canola oil instead of vegetable oil.  It turned out GREAT!  I would recommend topping this with salsa.

This was a good burger, had everything in the house to make it. Make sure the oil is hot is hot in the pan, before puting in the burger. And brown well.

We loved this recipe. We tried it the original way, loved it.  Then we decided to throw other things in them with no real measure - toasted sunflower seeds, chopped cauliflower and brocolli, chopped garlic. Loved that too. It's a very flexible recipe that you can't go wrong with.

these turned out exactly like the picture!!  How often does that happen.  As for taste,  all I can say is that my husband usually will not even look at a bean and so forget eating one!!  But....he really really loved these.  Make sure that they are nice and crispy on the outside!  Yum....  take the chance and make them!

These will definietly become a standard in our home. I think I might add a tablespoon of bbq sauce or worcestershire sauce to the mix next time. I also used too little salt.

This is a great recipie.  It's not as heavy as a regular burger, but it's still filling.  The only downside is getting the burger to stay together in the pan - easily avoided by coating it in breadcrumbs.  I nixed the onions and used salsa instead of jalepenos, which gave it a great taste.  Will be making these again...soon....

We love this recipe.  Like some of the others, I substituted black beans instead of butter, and used italian bread crumbs.  Coating the burgers lightly in the crumbs also helps in holding it together.

I was not a big fan of this dish. I made it according to the recipe and was expecting to like it quite a bit (since I'm a vegetarian and, as such, am quite used to eating thigns like this). My partner liked it, and eventually ate it all, but it wasn't overly impressive by any means. Average.

I was a little nervous after reading all the reviews, but decided to try this anyways.  I did follow some of the other reviews.  I had lentils at home, so I used those instead, 1/4 c bread crumbs instead of crackers, and I sauteed the onion/jalapeÃ±o mix.  Everything seemed fine until trying to make the patties, I coated them in another layer of breadcrumbs (Italian this time) but they  did not want to hold shape. I tried another reviewers advice and added another egg, that made it worse.  I think next time I will leave enough time to refrigerate the mixture before. I did manage to get them to the pan (only need 2 Tbls. oil) and they fried up wonderful!  We added some pepperjack cheese on a toasted bun and steamed veggies on the side and it was great.  Only thing, it makes a lot! So if cooking for 1 or 2 you might want to half the recipe.  Next time I will try with butter beans, but definitely a healthy alternative to frozen veggie burgers.

Great recipe!  Instead of the egg, I used silken tofu that I whipped smooth in my mini-chopper.  I definitely used too much as it was difficult for the burger to maintain its shape while cooking, but that is my fault.  I used about 1/2 cup of tofu and I will definitely reduce that to about 1/4 cup.  Another reviewer suggested refrigerating the burgers before cooking.  I refrigerated the mixture briefly (about 15 minutes) before forming patties and breading them and then I refrigerated them again. (See photo).   They browned, but were sticky, but again -- not the fault of the recipe.  My husband and son, the meat eaters absolutely loved the burgers.  My son ate 2!  Definitely a keeper!

This recipe was a HUGE hit with my family especially my very carnivore hubby. The day after he kept asking me when I was going to make it again. 
I used lentils instead of butter beans and it really was excellent.  Definitely a keeper.  Thank you for sharing!

THis is really good. Garbonzo beans work better. I found that they stayed in shape better when I used more crackers.  I also used some Wondra.  Even my mom, a hard core carnivore likes them!

Good, the texture is mush, next time I'll add rice so it has some bite to it and I love the corn meal suggestion.  And there is no reason to use that much oil.

I added garlic....but I add garlic to everything this side of a hot fudge sundae....

I do not get the 5 stars. These were very mushy. They did not hold together at all. I followed the recipe except for I did not use the jalapeno, and added some crushed red pepper instead. I also did not use all the oil required - if I did it would be extremely soggy, 2 tablespoons is enough for frying them. I dropped them by the spoon in the pan. They tasted ok. I am still looking for the perfect veggie burger recipe though.

My husband and I loved this recipe!!! It is a definite keeper.  I made some changes though. I used chipote power instead of peppers and mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar.  I also tried this recipe with cream cheese, but it wasnât as good.  I fried it in olive oil too.

I do not usually like legumes. (I couldn't find butter beans, so I substituted with part navy beans and part kidney beans).
This however was fantastic. They did come out a bit messy, sort of a big blob, but they tasted so good, not a single person in the family cared. Served them up plain and they disappeared.

I made these tonight and I thought they turned out pretty good. If you put some mustard on your burger bun these really taste similar to a Krystal or Whitecastle burger.  I didn't use the pepper and I used the Italian bread crumbs instead of the crackers. I'm a total cooking novice so if I can make these anyone can.

My husband hates butter beans, but loved this recipe.  It is a tasty alternative to yet-another-frozen-burger.  It was, however, a little on the oily side.  I think I should use hotter oil the next time.

My first attempt at reducing the amount of meat our family eats - we're REAL carnivores! Easy to make, cheap ingredients..this one is a winner! Even my midwesterner meat-lovin' husband ate 2 burgers!
Thanks!

Very delicious!  Thanks for the recipe, everyone in the family ate them.  The only thing I did diffrently from the recipe was bake them in the oven on my baking stone at 425 degrees.  Then I turned on the broiler for the last few minutes.  I added some dill weed to the bean mixture before baking.  I made this the same night I made the Mexican Bean Burgers, which were excellent as well.  We could sample both.  (Mexican Bean burger recipe in this collection, below).  Thanks for a good recipe.

I really enjoyed these burgers!  I found out that I didn't have any breadcrumbs on hand, so I used Italian seasoning and some crushed soup crackers which I did have.  I added fresh garlic, which I had minced in my mini-processor.  I decided to mash the beans in the processor as well and I liked this because it helped the mixture to stay together when I was cooking it.  I will definitely make this again and share it with my mom and friends!

When I tell my friends that I make this for dinner, I get strange responses. But its easy and healthy and cheap to make. Better than any veggie burgers you can buy!

I did not care for them. The first bite I thought was ok. The second bite made me nauseous and I couldn't eat anymore. I had been saving this recipe for a long time and was so excited to finally make them but I won't make them again.

made these on 6/11/18. made some substitutions but nothing to the point of changing the recipe. first I used 1/4 cup plus 2 Tablespoons of quick cooking oatmeal to sub for the bread crumbs or crackers. 2, I used some Tabasco  jalapeno sauce for the minced jalapeno, I just guessed at it 7 or 8 shakes, other than that I made the recipe as is written and it was delicious. My patties were tender yet held together. I highly recommend making this. for me it might could have used a bit more onion and garlic but that is just me personally it does not mean I would change anything. this has a mild but delicious flavor I do not think you would want to over do it on the spices and seasoning. I am keeping this recipe . it is very good

I am not a butter bean fan but he is. I was making these for the meat eating man and the veggie me. Not too often we can eat the same exact meal so this was nice. I added extra peppers,  garlic and used panko and a mix of the cheeses I had in the fridge and they turned out nicely. Totally will make again!

I followed the recipe. The mix came out extremely sticky and almost impossibly to form into patties.  Then they fell apart when I flipped them. Absolutely worthless.

Delicious! I wanted to make this exactly  according to  the recipe  so I could rate it on its own merit, and so that's what I did. My husband and I thought it was really tasty and I will definitely be making this again. I was delighted that the burgers did not fall apart as other recipes for bean burgers have done. If I WERE to change anything next time, I'd put a little more jalapeno in it because we like our spicy food.

We're giving this 4 stars, but noting that we want to tweak it for next time. 
First time we've used butter beans in a patty recipe, and was very happy with how easily they mashed compared to other smaller beans!   I was a little concerned that it would be too much jalapeÃ±o, but that was not the case.  We wound up wanting more spiciest flavor.  Maybe next time we'll use shredded Mexican blend cheese instead of the cheddar?  Maybe some flavored crackers?

It really soaked up the oil in the pan. I might try just a splash in the bottom next time to see if that helps. Patties also fell apart making them, so they weren't good attractive enough to serve to company. We didn't care for the pieces of barely cooked onion. I might try cooking them ahead of time or using onion powder/ salt to flavor.

This was much better than I expected, I did add a little season salt and a dash of Cajun spice for flavor and slightly less onion so my son will eat it. He loved it and said he would eat it again some time.

I did make a few changes, mainly because I was trying to use things I had on hand:
1) 1/4th yellow bell pepper instead of jalapeno
2) 2 cans beans and 1 large onion
3) 2 large squares of crumbled plain shredded wheat instead of the crackers (just because they needed to be used and that's what I had)
4) seasoned with ground mustard and tumeric, salt/pepper
5) 2 eggs (and I'm glad I did, because they are still tricky to flip without falling apart)
Very tasty!

This was SO delicious! I also thought it might be bland, but no - quite flavorful. I actually omitted the cheese (lower fat), so I can imagine *with* the cheese it would be even better. I did also use a little cayenne pepper instead of the jalapeno, since I didn't have any. Still gave it a little heat. I will be using this recipe again, and may try freezing the patties for a make-ahead dinner.

This was a little difficult to make because the of the texture of the paste. If you can manage for form it into patties and cook it without it falling apart or sticking to everything, it's really really yummy.

I've made these twice now and they are hands down the best vegetarian burgers I've found. They hold together very well, and are delicious. Instead of Saltines I used Triskets because that's what we had around the house and I figured they were a healthier option. I added an extra jalepeno the second time - they give it a great flavor. I hoped for a little kick, but they weren't spicy at all. My daughter requested these after I made them the first time!

It turned out great but I had to make a few changes. I used 1/4 cup of plain bread crumbs , added 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp chili powder and used grated cheddar instead of shredded cheese so it would bind a little easier. I made the patties and put it in the fridge to set for 20 minutes or so before sauteing in an iron skillet. I had some cooked fresh butter beans left over. I served with pico de Gallo over the burgers and cooked corn.

Awesome burgers... didn't have butter beans, so I used pinto and great northern.  My non-vegetarian daughter liked them more than the veggie child!  If you pack them really tight and have hot oil, they stay together and brown really well.

I used green pepper instead of jalepeno and bread crumbs too.  I aded a little finely grated carrot as well. Let them chill for a few hours and they didn't stick together so well when frying.....oh well I suspected as much. The flavour was just alright.

These were awesome!  I used bread crumbs because I didn't have the crackers in the house.  I think next time I will use green chilis instead of the jalapeno pepper.  Mine held together beautifully. This is a great meal that you can whip up if you forgot to defrost something for dinner.

I used italian bread crumbs instead of crackers and rolled them in cornmeal before chilling, and they turned out great. I've made these several times, much to the pleasure of many a meat eater when I do so.

I made these burgers with cannelloni beans, panko bread crumbs and dredged the burgers in corn meal.  For half of the recipe I used real cheddar cheese and the other half I used soy cheese.  The real cheddar burgers held together very well but the soy cheddar was wetter and didn't hold together as well.  Next time I will try adding more breadcrumbs to the soy cheese burger in hopes of creating a tighter burger.  Overall this is a great recipe, which I will make again. Thanks for sharing it.

I've made these twice already and can't believe how delicious they are. I love the fact that they are made with Butterbeans because I only just discovered butterbeans recently.  Very easy to make as well.  I use Extra Virgin Olive Oil to fry them up.

My family loved these -- just the right amount of "heat" for us.  I used fresh garlic instead of powder and chopped it in a mini food processor along with the jalapeno.  I formed the patties, then chilled.  They cooked up just fine in just a little bit of oil -- no problem with them falling apart.  One son recommends ranch dressing, the other topped it with ketchup, but my husband says its perfect as it!

These taste really good, I also put them in the freezer for a bit, and dredge them in breadcrumbs before cooking.

These were super easy and delicious!  Took the advice of other reviewers and shaped the burgers then chilled for an hour in the fridge.  Dredged in breadcrumbs before frying.  Served on potato buns with lettuce, avocado and a bit of mayo.  My 5-year-old ate TWO!!Perfecto!

Wow, these were delicious. I used Anaheim chilis (milder), added cilantro, and also added some oatmeal as others suggested. I couldn't find butter beans, so I used cannellini. My whole family loved them. I will be making these again and again. Thanks!

A true hazard to make. Unless the recipe is adjusted, it doesnt stick together making the frying impossible. Though it tastes nice, it turns out to be a crumbly mess not a burger.

Added extra egg white and breadcrumbs with the saltines, ground mustard seed, green onions, worcestershire sauce, and fresh lemon juice  Also used green and red bell pepper instead of the jalepeno.  Served on grilled sourdough with pepperjack cheese.  Very Delicious!!

These were very tasty   . I used tinned red kidney beans as that was all I had the first time I made them and they worked well.I have also added a little grated carrot so I found the recipe very adaptable. Thanks for sharing

It reminds me of a fried mashed potato ball.  It's really good.  Don't make the patties too thick or they won't cook all the way through without burning the edges.  My non-veg boyfriend liked them!

I love this recipe! the only issue i had with it was that it didn't bind well so after my first attempt i added 1/4-1/2 cup bread crumbs and they were much better.  i will definately make this again!

We were trying to find some different ways to use beans and found this recipe.  I've made this many times since my family LOVES it!!  We made one modification. Instead of the crackers, we use bread crumbs (about 1/4 cup).  And after the patties are formed, we rolled them in additional bread crumbs to give them more of a crust.  Very good!

My family loved this recipe.  I used home grown frozen butter beans.  I cooked them in water until they were soft and then followed the directions.  I had to add 12 crackers instead of six and I left out the pepper so the children could eat them.  Good recipe

Very good! I added more jalapeno because I like things spicy. I made it in my food processor. Has a good texture and yummy flavor. Tastier and cheaper than store-bought veggie patties. Will make often. Thanks!

Very good!  I've never used butter beans before.  My boyfriend and I loved these.  We used red bell pepper instead of jalapeno (because he doesn't like things too spicy).  I coated the burgers in flour on both sides before putting into the oil, just to bind them together a bit.  Thanks so much for a great recipe!

I loved the premise of the recipe but since I was making it with my young children in mind, I omitted the jalepeno, onion and cheese and added 1 T. parmesean cheese, about 1/2 cup chopped walnuts or almonds (sauted in margarine). My children really like this alternative burger.

These were good - easy and pretty tasty.  The consistency is a bit odd - almost like mashed potatoes, but the flavor was good.  I only used 1/2 the mixture and refrigerated the other 1/2 - i look forward to experimenting with the other half tonight!

I don't know what I did wrong. The flavor was okay, but it was so hard to make patties, as the mixture was very goopy. I drained the beans well, and I used 1/2 cup bread crumbs instead of cracker crumbs.  Will try these again, maybe with more beans.

these were really delicious.  I used some of the comments to enhance this recipe.  I added fresh crushed garlic and garlic salt.  I also used 1/4 cup of italian bread crumbs and combined it with the mixture then coated more on the outside. (i like things crispy).  I also made it the night before so the patties would stay together (i work a lot so this made it easy to cook the next day)  We didnt eat ours on buns but i put it on two slices of grilled bread with havarti cheese. Delicious!

Easy to make and pretty tasty but left me somewhat hungry still.  I think this is at best a side dish, not a real dinner.

This came out really well. I did have to add more crackers to the mix to make it hold together better but that wasn't a problem. I poured a packet of dry onion soup mix into it by mistake because I was looking at another recipe at the time that called for one, and that gave it a lot of extra flavor I think. I will be making these again, thanks!

Great sub for black bean burgers... an interesting, mild flavor that works well with a variety of toppings. I did use more crackers than I expected... just keep going with it until the mixture is firm but not dry.

So good! I froze them and cooked one at a time and it worked great. I also used breadcrumbs instead of crackers, and cooked some in the oven and they turned out great with less fat. Such a great vegetarian recipe! Thank you!

These we soooo good! My kids loved them. I made a pot of beans and was looking for something to do with them. I thought I would try this. I am glad I did. Going to make these again tomorrow for lunch with the left over beans. Enjoyed them!

Hubby and I aren't vegetarians and we LOVED these! I didn't have a jalepeno on hand so I used 1/2 cup of salsa for heat. Substituted italian breadcrumbs for the saltines. Next time I'll add chopped veggies to the mix and serve caprese-style instead of as a sandwich.

Super YUM!

I loved it. The idea of it is wonderful, especially because I don't eat hamburgers! The first time I made it, I forgot the egg. I was like 'why are these like mashed potatoes??' then once I realized what I did and corrected it, it was awesome. I look forward to experimenting with them :)

How about 10 stars? Omitted the egg which means it didn't hold together well...will try tofu next time to remedy that. Added dash of paprika, cumin & Mrs Dash, chopped roasted bell peppers, and garlic powder. Yum yum yum.

This has now become a staple dinner in our house, it is delicious!  Usually I add a yellow or orange pepper instead of the jalapeÃ±o and add a pinch of cayenne to substitute the spice.  Sometimes we use crackers and sometimes we use breadcrumbs (depends on what is on hand).  We like this best with butter beans, tried black beans once and it was definitely not as tasty.

My whole family enjoyed these, even my 2-year-old. They're a little different for us because we're not vegetarians, but we do like to keep things interesting at the dinner table and this fit the bill. We'll be making these again!

Very good.  
On the advice of other reviewers I used red bell pepper (no jalapenos bc of the salmonella scare) and I refrigerated and dredged in cornmeal before frying.
I actually doubled the recipe, but we each ate 1 of these and were completely full.  This is a great recipe for chefs on a budget.

I was pleasantly surprised to this recipe!  I think it was because I used Olive Oil instead of Vegetable Oil (I'm kind of anti Corn.)  I also used Pinto Beans instead of Butter Beans.  This is a great way to sneak in lots of vegetables into your meal.  The greatest part about this recipe is that it made 4 LARGE patties, all at a cost of maybe $2.

These were very tasty.  I did substitute salsa for the jalepenos as another reviewer said.  However, next time I would use more.  I don't eat eggs, so I put in a tablespoon of milk.  I won't the next time.  They didn't need it.  These formed into nice patties.  Very filling.

Although I added Worcestershire sauce and steak seasoning, these still had a bland quality to them. They were also hard to keep together despite adding a lot of extra bread crumbs and then coating the outside before frying. I would only make these again if I were short on ingredients and absolutely had to cook something. I might try making them again with black beans and salsa.

I tweaked this a little, based on other reviews.  I sauteed onions and green peppers, omitted the jalapeno, added Vigo Italian flavored breadcrumbs instead of the saltines, and added some Montreal (McCormick) steak seasoning. I fried the burgers in olive oil.  They were DELICIOUS.  Even my hubbie, who's not a vegetarian and hates the Morningstar/gardenburgers, ate the entire thing.  I didn't serve it as a sandwich, but next time, I think I'll try that.  These were tasty enough to stand on their own.  When I finish up the pre-made veggie burgers that I have in the freezer, I won't ever buy them again.  These are MUCH better.  Also, I froze mine (wrapped in plastic wrap and then foil, and then in freezer bag) and they held together fine when I cooked them.  Thanks for this recipe.  Will be a staple in my recipe box from now on.

These are great, for what they are.  Relatively quick and easy to make and healthy.  I make them thinner for less bulky burgers that don't taste like a hunk of beans.  Fry them hot for a seared taste.   These are also hot sauce friendly for sure.

Great flavor!  I served these easy-to-make bean burgers on whole wheat buns with sliced avocado, lettuce, tomato and catsup/mustard.  These were delicious hot out of the frying pan.  I tried reheating the leftovers in the oven the next day, but they lost their crisp texture and tasted too oily.  Definitely one to eat up right away, and with how delicious these are, that shouldn't be a problem!

These burgers are delicious! I ommited the jalapeno peppers and substituted bread crumbs (2 slices of bread in food proccesor) for the crackers. I also added a few tablespoon oil, cumin,italian seasoning,salt,onion powder, celery seeds and garlic powder. Follow the suggestions to dip the burger in cornmeal before frying or baking.

Absolutely delicious!  I added a little onion powder, red pepper flakes instead of jalepeno, and parsley.  I'm thrilled to find tasty vegetarian meals I can share with my friends!  It makes my lifestyle so much better.  Thank you for sharing!

I decided to whip up some of these burgers for me and my girlfriend last night. I did make a few changes per suggestion of the other reviewers, but the base recipe remained the same.

These were a HUGE hit. I'll be making them more in the future.

I used black beans instead of butter beans, sauteed the onions and added about 9 crackers instead of 6. I dipped each patty in a cornmeal/chili powder mixture. I omitted the jalepenos. I served the burgers on a kaiser roll w/ kettle chips on the side.

good stuff.

I was skeptical trying this recipe.  My first try at a 'substitute'.  I used fresh
minced garlic and gr pepper, only the eggyolk, added worcheshire and hot sauce no salt, Italian bread crumbs instead of cracker. I will definitely make this for myself and my family in the future, as a burger, and as a salisbury steak style dish, and with a tomato type dish.  This is very versatile and if you don't tell them, the won't know the difference!

I made these and they came out fantastic.  I did make a couple of minor changes however. I added extra jalepenos because I love mine to be spicy, used scallions instead of an onion, and added minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  Also I changed the saltines to ritz because its what I had on hand and this worked out pretty well too.  My boyfriend even ate these and enjoyed them and he usually doesnt care for a vegetarian dish.

My family found these extremely bland. I followed the recipe except added worchestshire sauce and bread crumbs per other reviewer's suggestions.  The patties were still quite crumbly, and although not bad-tasting, not good either.  I'm not really sure what could make this recipe a 'keeper' for our family, and I've tried a few variations.  It was nice to try something different, though, which is why this recipe got three stars instead of one.  Sorry. :-/

I fiddled w/ this recipe a little.  I left out the shredded Cheddar & added a slice of Cheddar to the burgers of those who wanted cheese.  I also added finely chopped green peppers to the mix, a can of garbonzo beans, and used bread crumbs rather than crackers so the burgers would stick better.  Very good; thanks for the idea.

This recipe really need some more flavor, even with the jalapeÃ±o. I sauteed the onion and added a garlic clove to it. As suggested, I added thyme, whorchestore sauce, and rosemary. Finally, I coated them with bread crumbs, cayenne, and paprika before cooking them in the pan I used for the onions.

I thought it was yummy and so did my 4 year old daughter who ate it all up.  My husband (a carnivore) thought it was tasty but a bit bland.  Next time I'll add a bit more of the garlic, onion, red pepper and worcestershire sauce.  If putting a cayenne in the cornflour for dipping (as suggested by another  reviewer), put in quite a bit... I didn't add enough and couldn't taste the cayenne at all.  All stuck together... no problems with that.

We loved this recipe!!    As my husband said, "I could give up red meat for recipes like this!"  Ours didn't stay together very well, but that may be because we have to use GF crackers.  Regardless, we will definitely use this again!!

Made these last night for dinner.  I followed the receipe except I omited the cheese (trying to cut back), and I used a few dash's of hot sauce.
I loved these, they do have a different texture than most other "bean" burgers, but I think that's what makes them good.
The only thing I think I did wrong was to make the patties to thick.  I have them today for lunch and I will see how they turn out re-heated.

I made no substitutions and loved this recipe! It isn't "trying" to be meat, but the result is very tasty. I will definitely make this again, and I've already forwarded the recipe on to my vegetarian friends.

I've done this for years, with pinto beans.  I never even thought about trying it with butter beans, but my family and I loved it..

These were better than I thought they would be. I made them for my parents, who loved them. I thought they were good, but my husband the kids didn't really like them, so I probably won't make them again.

My husband loved these!  I was surprised at how quick and easy these were to make and get on the table.  I used chopped red pepper to give them some more color.

These are good but a little mushy to truly substitute for a hamburger. After a few hours in the frig, they easily formed patties. Great flavor!
