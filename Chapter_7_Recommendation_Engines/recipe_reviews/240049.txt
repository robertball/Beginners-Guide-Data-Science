What a surprise.  I have made these several times to rave reviews. I had better luck melting the chocolate chips (more like 1 cup) into the marshmallow  butter mixture after it melted then stirring in the candy corn and cereal.  I'm not a big candy corn fan but they mix in well and this is a fun easy Halloween treat.

These were delicious! I was surprised by how yummy the candy corn was mixed in. We used mini M&M's instead of chocolate chips. Adults and kids all loved!

We left out the chocolate chips and drizzled chocolate on top instead.  Did these in the microwave, melting the butter, slightly warming the marshmallows, then stirring in the candy corn and krispies.  Used a bowl with the bottom buttered to push into the pan.  The recipe is a good one.

These were good! Brought them to my daughter's preschool and they were devoured. 
Next time I'll add less rice cereal or more marshmallows. I'll also press the chocolate chips on after they cool a bit so they hold their shape instead of melting all over the place. :)
