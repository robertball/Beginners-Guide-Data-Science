This chicken was fantastic and a big hit at a recent dinner party I threw.  I left the anise out of the rub and used spiced rum instead of dark rum, but otherwise, left the recipe as is.  I served it over basmati rice w/steamed green beans that I then sauteed w/a little olive oil and slivered almonds.  I can't say enough great things about this meal.  The sauce thickened up really nicely and had a great flavor over the spiced chicken.  I will definitely make this again and again.  (Oh, I also baked the chicken as I live in a condo and cannot have a grill - it was still delicious).  Thanks Linda!

I made this recipe and skewered the chicken for a get together and my guests and they loved it. I rubbed then marinated the chicken longer than the recipe indicated, about 3 hours which brought out the flavor and also added salt for added flavoring. Next time will try to kick up the spices just a tiny bit but not enough to over power the chicken. I'll be making this again very soon!  Thanks for sharing Linda.

We didn't care for this.  I followed the recipe exactly too.  The Mango salsa is good.  The chicken, not so much.  We didn't care for the spice combination.  Will not make this one again.

I left the rub on for about 1 1/2 hours but would still like more spice. Next time I'll double the rub, I think. The sauce was great. I'd like to try it on salmon, pork and maybe even ice cream. Definitely company fare!

This recipe was excellent.  I served it at a dinner party, and everyone loved it!  I also grilled some red and green peppers and served them on top with the mango salsa, which I thought added some nice colour.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I really really liked this as did my husband.  The only things I did differently was:  Didn't add the anise seed (didn't have) and used fresh ginger instead of ground.  I put the dry rub on first then patted in some fresh ginger and let marinade.  I cooked this on the Foreman Grill for 6 minutes and perfection.  The sauce was really good too, I added a little bit more honey than called for.......Very easy and yummy!!  Thanks for a great recipe, I will make this again.

Delicious! my boyfriend made it and the whole family loved it!. The mango sauce woud taste great with cheesecake or vanilla ice cream too.  If we make it with the chicken again i think we'll add some spice to the sauce.  
Thanks!

This was ok.  The seasoning combo wasn't quite right.  I would make it again but I will play with the seasoning next time.

This was very tasty!  As I hadn't planned ahead and shopped on the same day that I was cooking this recipe when I got to the grocery store all the mangos were unripe.  I substituted frozen mango and it was excellent.  I will certainly make this again.

This was an especially delicious dish! The only thing I would change would be to add more spices to pump up the flavor of the chicken with maybe a marinade to brush on while grilling. Also, the mango wasn't quite ripe and I only had orange juice cocktail on hand, which might explain why the mango sauce didn't quite live up to my expectations. Next time I'll add something to give it more flavor!

I did not make this entire recipe, I only used the spice blend for the chicken, as I had already made a fresh mango/avocado relish. The combination of flavors was perfect. I served the chicken over rice and then topped it with my (uncooked) relish. I will definitely make this again.

I absolutely loved this rub and sauce.  I made exactly as written with the exception of the anise seed.  This is so flavorful, and a very unusual combination of flavors.  An exceptional and very unique chicken dish.  Thanks for sharing this, Linda.

This was excellent. I made a few changes, I used Gold Rum instead of Dark Rum, chicken thighs and drumsticks, and brown rice. Also, I did not have anise. I think I would use chicken breast next time just because it is easier to eat. My husband liked it and he doesn't usually like fruity sauces on his meat. This is a keeper, I think I will make it for my Bunco group! I really enjoyed the fresh taste!

Decent - used 3 chicken breasts instead of 4 and had just enough sauce.  next time I would definitely let the chicken marinate in the spices longer.  Cubed and skewered before grilling which worked VERY well!

This was delicious. I would double the rub and add a little salt next time. I left out the anise from the rub because I'm not a fan of that flavor. I also didn't have dark rum, so substituted spiced rum and a touch of molasses for the Mango sauce. YUM.

I tried this for a small party and the compliments did fly. My daughter insisted on copying the recipe onto a card and placing it in the "Must do again" section of my recipe box.
Just great!

My husband really liked this but I had some issues with it. Didn't have anise and forgot to put cayenne on the chicken. No matter, it had a good flavor but was not very tender on the grill. Maybe we need more oil on the grill. I think I used too much orange juice in the sauce, too concentrate tasting. Next time, I'll increase the lime and use less OJ. I added red pepper flakes and cayenne to the sauce but it still felt like it was missing something.  I'll need to experiment more for next time if there is one.

There's so many better recipes out there, I wouldn't waste the ingredients on this one. I wanted to like it, pride myself on making an exotic and delicious dish- but alas this is not the recipe. Way too sweet, should have seen the warning signs when other reviewer posted "I may try this ontop of ice cream!" Looks like it's take out tonight!

Best chicken I've had in a very long time.  I did rework the spices a bit...1/2 t of ginger, 1 t of cinnamon and cumin, no anise, 1 t of cayenne for the rub. Rubbed the mix on the whole butterflied chicken and left it in the fridge for about 4 hours only because I had other stuff to do. Got the grill going and put the chicken on.  For the mango salsa, I used 2 mangoes, hand squeezed OJ of 2 oranges and 1 whole fresh lime, 2 T honey, jazzed it up with some pepper flakes and 3 Thai whole peppers, cornstarch/H2O, w/2 T of Capt'n Morgan Lime infused light Rum and let that simmer on the stove while the chicken was cooking.  Also, had half of a baked potato instead of the rice, home grown spinach salad!  Only had chicken this good one other time in my life!  WILL be doing this one again!  :)

I thought this would be so much better than it came out.  The only thing I changed was I baked my breasts instead of grilling and I had to cook the sauce longer after adding the rum.  It was just too harsh raw.  Overall the flavor and balance was just lacking, mabye some salt and smokey spice would help

My wife is a fantastic cook.  When I return the favor and cook for her, this is my top dish.  It is very easy, yet exotic.  It is very easy to play with the spice combinations to suit your specific tastes, as anise and cayenne pepper are quite strong.  A great meal.

An excellent meal for entertaining or simply grilling on a nice evening in summer. Only comment would be to add about 10% less honey than called for.
