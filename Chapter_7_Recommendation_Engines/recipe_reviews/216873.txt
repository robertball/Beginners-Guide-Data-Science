I made this for my husband's birthday (his favorite flavor of pie).  We both loved it, although it was very rich.  At least the richness made it last for more than a day.  lol  This was my first experience with scraping a vanilla bean and it took me a good while to split it initially.  The editor's note about saving the dried vanilla bean in sugar is great.  Just that touch of vanilla in coffee with cream is heavenly.

I had never used vanilla beans before, but it was soooo worth it! This recipe is awesome! I've made it at least three times in the past month, because everybody just keeps wanting more. :) I have to admit though, I did use pre-made crusts to save time, but I let the rum soak into it.

Overall this was a great pie. I made mine in a tart pan instead of a pie pan and only put the crust on the bottom. The crust is delicious! I used half coconut milk and half coconut cream for the mixture and still added some Lorann's Gourmet Coconut flavoring oil to it. I didn't have flaked coconut, which I will make sure I add next time I make this. I think it is needed mostly for texture than anything else. I ate a maraschino cherry with each piece. Delightfully coconutty!

I made this pie this week to go with my husband's gumbo dinner. It is a very expensive pie to make. But everyone that ate it gave it rave reviews. It is definitely one to make for special occasions.

I cheated and used a pre-made crust.  I also did not use any flaked coconut.  Instead, I bought a coconut, opend it up and scrapped out the insides and toasted it.  I added this to the filling.  This recipe is wonderful!!  Thanks for sharing.

I had very high expectations for this pie because of the reviews and also the ingredients and time invested.  It was good, but not worth 5 stars.  Coconut cream pie is one of my favorites!  I've made one using a relatives recipe which I feel is better.  This pie is very time consuming, I made it over the course of the day...from beginning to end, it took 5 hours.  I liked the idea of each layer having some form of coconut, however, I still like my relative's recipe better.  If you have no other recipe for coconut cream pie that rates a "5", you will probably love this one.  I'm sticking to my relative's old stand-by recipe!

I made this pie for a potluck dinner.  Even though I did not make the crust (used a pre-made frozen one), the result was a fluffy, coconutty, decadent pie.  Loved it!  Using a frozen crust made the whole process and clean up a lot easier and faster.

I, too, used the Pillsbury ready-made crust from the refrigerated section of the grocery store.  We really liked this recipe, but I do have another recipe that I like a bit better.

By far the best coconut cream pie I have made

Not wanting to heat the oven I used a purchased graham cracker crust  . For the filling: My can of coconut milk was only 15 oz, so I made up the difference by adding three additional oz of milk to the required amount. I added a good cup and a half of toasted coconut (waste not want not) and only about 5 oz of sugar due to coconut being so high in sugar. I only had two whole eggs, and that was perfectly fine. I forgot to stir in the butter and omitted the vanilla, I have no vanilla beans and was going to use extract but after tasting the pudding I decided it wasn't called for. I added a few drops of yellow food coloring, as the coconut milk was an ugly grey color. . By the way that super cheap packaged flaked coconut toasts up quite nicely in a toaster oven, but really quickly, so take extra care.

This recipe was WAY too involved and complicated to warrant the outcome.  The flavor was good, but not good enough to make me want to ever make this again.

This is a great recipe! I did make some changes for the filling, instead of a vanilla bean, I substituted the regular sugar for vanilla sugar that I always have on hand so the vanilla bean taste is still present. Finally, to cut some calories, I used skim milk. Other than perhaps missing out on some richness from the whole milk, the custard sets just fine for all the cornstarch that goes into it and you don't really miss it. Your standard non-dairy whipped topping also works in place of the whipped cream. In fact, I suggest it readily if 1) you're trying to cut calories again and 2) you're not planning on having the entire pie eaten in one sitting. Whipped cream can revert back into liquid after a few hours and will ruin the leftover pie.

Delicious pie.
I bought a refrigerated pie crust, however, and pre-baked it myself - I didn't make the actual pie crust from scratch.

This was good, but wonderful and it took a lot of time, money and effort to make.
