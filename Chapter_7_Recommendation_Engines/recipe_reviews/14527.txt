I am a caterer and made this for a wedding rehearsal dinner a few months ago.  It was a huge hit!  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and pounded them so that they were uniform in thickness.  I marinated the chicken for 2 days & grilled them about 3 1/2 minutes per side.  I garnished the platter with lemon halves, roasted heads of garlic & sprigs of fresh rosemary.  My only suggestion is to be careful with the fresh oregano...it is very pungent, so don't get carried away!!

This is incredible!  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and placed them in the marinade before I froze them.  I then thawed over night.  I grilled the chicken and it came out perfect.  I used a teaspoon each of the dried herbs.  The chicken had a great strong lemony taste, plus the hint of the garlic and herbs gave it great kick.  I cooked my chicken about 10 minutes per side and they turned out perfect.  I can't wait to make again.

Very juicy and easy to make.  I used boneless, skinless breasts, bottled lemon juice and dried herbs - wish I had a mortar and pestle to crush the rosemary.  The first time I made this, I only used two breasts but kept the rest of the ingredients the same.  I marinated for an hour and then cooked them on the George Foreman grill - delicious!  The 2nd time I made four breasts w/the same amount of marinade - not quite as flavorful but still very good.  I recommend adding more spices & garlic than the recipe calls for if you like a stronger flavor.

My 13-year-old daughter, who suddenly hates everything I put in front of her, absolutely loved this recipe! I've already made it twice in the last 3 weeks. Because it is too cold out to use my grill right now, I put the chicken in the oven for an hour at 350 degrees F. Served with wild rice, salad, and hot dinner rolls made dinner a hit in my house!

I could give this receipe six stars, taste great. It is a little cold to be grilling outside so I cook it in the oven instead. 375 for about 25 minutes covered with aluminum foil, removed the foil turned on the broiler and cooked about 10 minutes to add some nice color to it. Don't forget the wine for the cook, that is very important.

Simple and good! I served with Greek Orzo Salad and garlic french bread topped with chopped tomatoes, feta cheese, & chopped olives and got many compliments. Didn't grill the chicken - I baked at 350 for an hour as per suggestion of another review... next time I think I'll try and cover with foil so the chicken is a little more moist.

A nice way to use fresh garden herbs.  I marinated overnight and it tasted good, but not great.  The cooking time was about 10-15 per side.

I made this last night, and it was fabulous.  We had it with pitas, tomatoes, onions and lettuce.  I used chicken breast tenders, and didn't grill it for an hour - It would have been to dry.  I highly recommend it!

For maximum flavor try preparing the marinade mix a day or two in advance (refrigerated) to allow the herb flavors to infuse into the oil. It cuts the marinade time and is much safer than letting the chicken sit refrigerated for longer than it needs to. The dish was magnificent. I served over rice with a tomato, green bean & sprout salad. Will definitely be continuing to make this one!

I LOVE this recipe!!  I've made it several times and it's always so yummy-I serve it with pita bread or flat bread, hummus and tzatziki. I also prepare the chicken the night BEFORE I cook it, so it marinates a full day.  I turn it and re-coate the chicken once or twice during this time also.  I find the chicken really soaks up the marinade that way, and it comes out very tender.  I use double the lemon juice, (1/2 cup).  I also find this recipe tastes better on skin-on, dark meat chicken, but that's probably because it's fattier!  Lastly, I do bake this ( I don't have a BBQ), 350 degrees for one hour.  Ladies, if you want to impress a new guy, this is what to cook-you can't screw it up, it takes hardly any time, and he will love it!!

This was great! I made the recipe just as listed, except I used thighs and marinaded them overnight. Put them on the BBQ grill and they turned out fantastic..took iceburg lettuce, and leaf lettuce alone with Walla Walla Onions, cucumbers, tomatoes from my garden, and warm pita bread and Tzatziki sauce. I cut the chicken into bite size pieces after letting meat sit for about 10 minutes. Made for a great light summer meal. Will make again for a larger family gathering!

Marinated cut chicken pieces overnight and roasted in oven at 375 degrees for 55 mins.  Chicken looked very tasty coming out of the oven.  Picky 11-yr old said it was ok, I thought the breast was dry, and no comment from DH.  Won't make again.

Very nice marinade. The chicken was moist and tender with subtle herb flavor. I used bone-in chicken breasts and cooked them on the charcoal grill.

I baked as a previous review did for 40 minutes on 400 but it came out too dry.  I think 350 would have been much better.  And this recipe has NO salt - so I added a couple of shakes to bring out the flavor.  Also, two lemons is too much, one lemon next time!

I think the Mediterranean, between the Greeks & the Italians, has the corner on the market of great cuisine.  I love the flavors and the health benefits.  For this one, I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and did everything else as written.  Served alongside a Greek salad; great simple fare.  Added a bit of salt to the marinade; would probably reduce the amount of olive oil next time.  Thanks for the recipe, Karen!

It was VERY tasty.  I had to use dry herbs - the substitution is 1 tsp of dried for 1 tablespoon of fresh herbs.  I marinated it overnite and it was very moist.

I gave this 4 stars because it was too lemony for our taste and it seemed to overpower the other ingredients.  Made exactly to recipe except I baked it in the oven and did not grill it.  Maybe that was what made the difference.  For me, by cutting down on the lemon I think this would be a 5 star recipe!  Thanks Karen for submitting this.

I followed the recipe pretty close except that I used chicken breasts and instead of grilling, I browned them in a pan and then finished cooking them in a 425 oven for about 15 minutes.  Once they were done, I transferred them to a plate and de-glazed the pan with some chicken broth to make a sauce to put on top of the chicken.  Very good!

Very good recipe. It came out really very tender and moist.  However, I would recommend seasoning chicken with some salt and/or garlic powder prior to cooking. Will definitely cook again...

This was so tasty! I'm always afraid of over-lemoning so I only used one lemon (which ended up being about 1/4 cup) and it was perfect. I used 5 cloves of garlic and let it marinate for about 6 hours. I cooked the chicken at 400 degrees for 45 minutes and then put it under the broiler for about 2-3 minutes to get the skin nice and crispy. Oh my gosh this was SO good!

Absolutely the best chicken we have ever eaten!  It was so good, everyone kept going back for leftovers.  Even the kids loved this one!  I marinated it in a large ziplock bag over night.  It was so quick and simple to throw it on the grill the next night.  A great busy day recipe and wonderful for company too!

Awesome chicken!  Very flavorful, the herbs meld nicely with the garlic and lemon juice.  I cooked mine in the oven at 350 for about an hour and half, but it was about a 6 pound chicken I had cut up.  I also used bottled juice instead of fresh, since I didn't have fresh lemons on hand.  This is a dish I will definately make again!  Thanks Karen.

This was very good for a light summer dish. I served it in pitas with tzatziki sauce. The chicken was very moist, but I think it needed some salt and pepper.

I made this last night and it was fantastic.  Cooking the chicken on the grill is key, I think you would lose something flavorwise if cooked this in the oven.

I thought this was very good and easy. I didn't have fresh herbs, so I used dried. Marinated for 7 hours.

Wonderful!  Chicken was really moist and tender.  Didn't have the fresh herbs so I used 1 tsp. each of oregano, thyme, and rosemary and turned out great!  Thanks Karen!

Easy recipe and I baked the chicken at 400 for 45-50 minutes instead of grilling because it was winter when I made it. My family loved it. Enjoy!!!!

I used BLSL which meant I had to cook it differently, but the lemony flavor really shone through. Thanks for sharing!

This was great.  I used pork chops instead of chicken and wow it was so yummy.  I also used dry herbs.  It's great on the grill when the outside gets   crispy.  What a winner.  Can't wait to try it on chicken

This recipe was extremely easy and very tasty.  My grill is broken so I just baked it at 350 for about an hour.  It makes a great juice to serve over rice. It has become one of my husbands favorites.

Very good recipe...but how on earth does this dish have 30 grams of fat per serving? There is no possible way! I used skinless chicken breasts. Did the orig. recipe call for a whole chicken cut into pieces?

Failproof!  I used reconstituted lemon juice, oregano and garlic from a tube and added some powdered thyme for more flavor.  Used boneless chicken thighs and only marinaded for about 45 min and it was as good as when I marinate longer. Chicken was so moist and savory. You cannot go wrong with this recipe!

OMG...this is so good. If I could give it 10 stars, I would. Used whole legs since we both like dark meat. Marinated in a ZipLock bag. It's worth having an herb garden just for this recipe. Did it over medium heat and turned often so it didn't char. Just left the herbs on it on the grille. Served with chunked potatoes tossed in EVO with dried herbs, wrapped in non stick foil, then wrapped again. They only took 5-6 min. on each side, then put them in the top section of the grille while the chicken cooked and they were done perfectly. We used medium heat instead of high. Just served with sliced tomatoes and green peppers from the garden. NO cleanup at all. Think I'll probably just freeze my herbs at the end of the season so they'll be "fresh" all winter. Even my other half complimented me. Thanks Karen

More than the sum of its parts.  It's easy to prepare, using ingredients commonly found in the kitchen, it's foolproof - the chicken is moist every time - and it smells absolutely divine whilst cooking.  I can't recommend this recipe enough.

This is a very easy and very good recipe. The tomatoes, feta cheese and calamata (Greek) olives are a great side dish with it. I also served "Mom's Cucumber Salad" with it. You can find the "Mom's" recipe on Allrecipes.

This was very good. Boneless chicken breasts should be baked at a high temp for a short time...there's not enough fat to keep it moist for longer, lower-heat cooking. Try pounding it to uniform thickness and baking for 20 min at 450. It'll make a huge difference!

The recipe wasn't all Greek to me - in fact it was easy, delicious, and FAB-U-LOUS! I marinated it overnight instead of 8 hour as the recipe suggests and I suspect it came out even better!

I am partial to the Greek style garlic chicken breast recipe on here, but decided to give another one a try. I thought this turned out pretty good. I liked the different herbs on it. It is a little less juicy than the other one, but still has great flavor. I just used 4 large bone in chicken breasts, because that is what I had. I have fresh lemon juice, I juiced, that I keep in the freezer at all times. On-line it said 2 Tblsp. equals one lemon so I went with that. I served it with grilled baked potatoes, zucchini, and tomatoes.

Great flavor (I marinated overnight) and easy to make. I baked at 375 for 45 minutes and it was perfectly moist. I especially love the lemon kick in it although I only had 1 1/2 lemons on hand.

I used regular canola oil (found I was out of olive oil and wanted to get the chicken marinating).  I cut the rosemary down since I'm not a fan but added marjoram.   Salt and pepper. I would suggest that for an added lemon kick--zest the lemons first if you use fresh ones.  Might as well get the essential oils from the zest since you already have the lemons. Did the boneless skinless breasts using a grill  pan and was really happy with the results.  Will definitely be making this one often. Thanks so much!

Oh so good!! Only used 1/4c. olive oil and the rest of the recipe remained the same. Delicious.....made this with Tomato Feta Salad on this site and grilled asparagus.....great dinner and family loved it! I did omit the rosemary and substituted with dried thyme.....very tasty.

Delightful dish!  Rather than a cut-up chicken, I used this recipe for cornish game hens.  I did everything the same, except after marinating the hens overnight, I put them in my crockpot on low for 8 hours with about 1/4 cup of chicken broth. I finished them off by broiling them for 8-10 minutes so they would have a nice brown skin.  The meat was so moist and flavorful, it fell off the bone.  I'm a big fan of the crockpot, and this recipe worked well.

I made pita sandwichs with this chicken after I chopped it up.  Along with the chicken, I added lettuce, tomatoes, onion, black olive, provolone cheese, and ranch dressing.  The kids could not stop complimenting this combination.  I noticed one child kept sneaking bites of the chicken before we added it to the pita-si it was a hit with everyone here.  The flavors were mild-but very pleasant.  Thanks Karen!

This was very easy and delicious!  It was not too spicy for my picky children, but just tangy enough to be interesting for adult palettes as well.

This recipe was really tasty. The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because the olive oil made it a very smoky dish to BBQ. The oil dripping onto the BBQ caused flare-ups. Used dried herbs instead of fresh and it still turned out great.

I served this up for a guest who said it was the best chicken he had ever tasted!!
I used chicken breasts and cooked them on the BBQ the same way as you would a steak. They only took about 5 minutes each side and were really moist and tender

Although this dish was flavorful, my husband and I both found it extremely dry and tough.  Maybe because of the acidity of the lemon juice?  Don't think we'll be trying this one again.

easy, fast to put together but a little bland as is.  I have to add more garlic, some sea salt to increase the flavor a little, but I make it over and over again.

This is BETTER than the chicken at the Greek restaurant!  Amazing flavor.  Followed recipe exactly except I baked the chicken in the oven.  Had to cook the breast a little longer, about 50 minutes, but it depends on the size of the pieces.  Marinated over night and all day.

Wonderful!  Great mix of ingredients.  Chicken was very juicy with great flavor.  The only thing missing was salt.  I sprinkled the chicken with salt just before grilling and that was the perfect touch.

DELICIOUS!!  I spatchcocked a roasting chicken and marinated almost 24 hours.  Then I actually roasted the chicken in the oven instead of on the grill and poured the marinade over the top and in the roasting pan while it cooked.  So the chicken was able to continue to soak up some of these fabulous flavors.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND this simple and yummy recipe!

My new summer favorite! I use chicken breast cut into thin strips/pieces and thread them onto bamboo skewers to cook on the grill. Serve with grilled cherry tomatoes over rice. "Molly's Mouthwatering Tzatziki Cucumber Sauce" is a must have to go with this.

Very easy, very good and it pleased my children (ages 12 and 8), who each asked for second helpings. Served with a vegetable and fresh fruit and it made a tasty, healthy meal. Have been given "permission" to make again.

This is an excellent chicken recipe!  I have made this twice now and both times altered the ingredients because of what was on hand.  I used thin sliced chicken breast, I only had dried herbs/seasonings and only used thyme and oregano and garlic powder.  I also added just a little bit of fresh ground sea salt.  The first time I made this I added fresh lemon juice, the second time I made it I omitted it (again because did not have on hand).  Both times the chicken was great!  I served this for company which included a crew of 4 (5 yrs old and under) kids that typically won't touch anything that has an herb on it and they devoured it!  I also sliced the chicken after it was cooked the first time and used it to make gyros and then the second time just served the breast pieces whole as part of a BBQ.  Also, don't worry if you don't have the marinade time, the dish will still be terrific!  Thanks Karen for giving me a great recipe variation for chicken that I will make again and again!

Maybe I just don't like the Greek flavorings????  I don't know why, but despite all the raves from other reviewers, my family really didn't care for this.  Not bad, just not as wonderful as I had expected.

I halved the recipe and made this using 2 bone-in, skin on chicken breasts. The flavor was delicious and just right. I also added a touch of red wine vinegar, as well as salt and pepper to taste. I really enjoyed that it used fresh herbs, but I think it would work equally well with dried herbs. Thank you for sharing!

My fiance loved this.  I enjoyed using fresh herbs from my garden.  I highly reccomend using this on seafood.

Really fantastic mix of flavors. I took boneless chicken breast, cut it up into pieces and marinated it. Grilled it up for use in greek chicken pita sandwiches. Top with some tzatziki, lettuce, feta and olives. Fantastic!

Bleah! I knew I should have trusted my instincts on this one. The acid (lemon) ratio is way off here, the marinade essentially pickles the chicken (and I only left it in five hours or so) and imparts an awful bitter lemon flavor with nearly zero impact from the herbs or garlic. If you want a good Greek style marinade (why did I stray from it to begin with?) try searching for the 'Souvlaki' recipe by Abby Benner. It calls for pork but I use boneless chicken and throw in bell peppers and mushrooms (also grilled). This recipe was a huge disappointment, would not make again or recommend.

I've made this recipe virtually every weekend since I found it! My family enjoys it with a greek salad and couscous. The only thing I did differently was add a pinch of salt to the marinade. Delicious!

Super-duper yum. This is the Greek chicken recipe I was looking for. I forgot I was supposed to marinate, so that part didn't get done. I made it with greek potatoes and it all turned out great.  I used two lemons with 8 pieces of chicken and it was enough lemon flavor. Thanks!

Very good, I used a bunch of onion and garlic powder, and salt and pepper.  We used an 8 pound chicken cut into pieces, threw the lemons in the pan after juicing them over the chicken and cooked at 425 for 20 min, then 45 min at 400 (This was one HUGE chicken.) Make sure to season it well with salt and pepper, that's key!

EDIT: I just tried this again using the FRESH, not dried, herbs. What a difference this makes! Definitely "5 star material"! I would imagine this would work with any combination of fresh herbs (I'm going to try basil and rosemary next!)
Old review: I am sure I would rate this "5 stars" if only I had used fresh herbs rather than dry! Even with the dried herbs the chicken was quite tasty. I used the chicken, along with tomato and onion, to make pita sandwiches for tonight's dinner. I then topped it with my "Easy Greek Yogurt Cucumber Sauce" as a spread. Delish! I'm saving this to my recipe box.

The beauty of this recipe is that no one dislikes it. It is one of those rare dishes that pleases everyone: picky children, teens, adults with food allergies. I served this at my daughter's birthday party and the crowd (12 and 13 year old girls) ate it up. I recommend salting and peppering the chicken right before you put it on the barbecue. I served it with a make-your-own Greek salad bar, homemade pita bread, and tzatziki. People swooned, and no one complained!

This was pretty good.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, dried herbs, & about half of the olive oil.  Served it with the spanakorizo recipe from this site and had a tasty, and filling, Greek dinner.

I didn't think this was amazing, but I didn't use fresh herbs.  It was good, but lacked that definitive taste I was looking for.  Served it with pitas, so they might have absorbed some of the flavor.  Fresh herbs would probably help.

I love this recipe.  It smells wonderful as it is cooking on the grill, and tastes just as great.  I have not used fresh herbs with it yet, so I just double the amount of herbs since I use dried.

This was pretty good, but the chicken was quite dry for me, maybe I cooked it too long.  Next time I might try baking it in the oven with the marinade rather than grilling it.

Thank you Karen for your delicious Greek Chicken receipe that my family enjoyed.  Just had it three days ago.  We like it so much that I am going to make it again today. I used the mini toaster instead of grilling and it' so quick, easy and delicious.   Thank you.

I made this and it tasted fine, but I expected more flavor. However, I used boneless/skinless chicken breasts and dried herbs instead of fresh, which could account for the less robust flavor?

I removed the skin and pierced holes in the meat with a fork so as much flavor would infuse in the chicken.I baked it indoors at 375 and for the last 15 minutes broiled it.The spice combination was wonderful.I didn't change a thing except we opted out of cooking outside.

Yassou!!! Wow this is sooo yummy, I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have charcoal. So I cut up some red potatoes with the skins on, into bite size pieces. I put them on the bottom of my roasting pan, I also used chicken breasts cuz that's what I had, put my chicken breasts which marinated overnight on top of my potatoes in a 375 degree oven for an hour. It was the best chicken ever. Thanks so much, I can't wait to grill it! ;)

I made a few substitution and added a few things. I used all dry ingredients (garlic powder, rosemary, thyme, oregano 1 tablespoon each). Instead of lemon (juice) I used lemon pepper seasoning, a generous tablespoon as well. I also added a pinch of salt, ground cumin and curry powder.  Marinated it overnight. Next day I threw it on the grill and then finish off in the oven. It was delicious! Very moist, flavorful, and yummy!   Thank you for sharing this recipe with us.

I used 4 chicken breasts butterflied and marinaded those in ziplock baggie for 2 days.  Cooked on grill (butterflying allows marinade to get well into the meat and it cooks faster and more even (no burnt on the outside, undercooked in the middle).  Fried chopped up red bell pepper, green bell pepper, pablano, and white onion in olive oil and dry greek seasoning in the iron skillet (sort of like how you cook fajitas).  Chopped up finished chicken and mixed with peppers and onion and put on pita.  Hummus on the side.  Really good.

Very good... we broiled the chicken since it was too hot to grill outside.   I made "Suddenly Salad" Basil and Pesto pasta salad to go with it.  Mixed it up with some feta cheese and it was really good.   Not all that great by its self but good when all mixed together.

I had a problem with grill flare ups when making this.  What wasn't charred beyond belief tasted wonderful.  Have to figure out how to grill this stuff without the flareups.

Very disappointed in this recipe; could not taste the herbs and even with salt added it was really really bland. We had guests too; yikes! Better to sprinkle to use dry herbs just before bar-b-quing and a whole lot easier!

Phenomenal.  I used chicken breasts and I broiled them.  They were SO flavorful I could not believe that there wasn't any salt added!  Makes an unbelievable chicken salad, wrap, club salad, etc.

This was a little bland.  I tried it twice and though it went well with greek potatoes, on it's own, it was a weak.  Frying gave better flavor than grilling.  I'm still searching for the best greek chicken!

A hit again with may father & son. My father was so surprised to realise that he was eating chicken as the meat reamains very moist. The only alteration I made was not to cut in pieces. I kept it as a whole piece & grilled them on BBQ with a sheet of aluminiun foil in roder to make it easier to grilled the other side. Many thanks Karen for sharing your recipe. Rochtur

I used the marinade for boneless chicken thighs (so moist!).  Grilled them whole and then chopped into smaller chunks right before serving.   I also reserved part of the marinade for baby red potatoes, which I quartered and roasted in the oven.  Served with flat bread, sliced onions, shredded lettuce, feta cheese, and tzatziki sauce from this website.  Delicious!

This was SO good!!!  I marinated for almost 24 hours.  If my grill wouldn't have caught the chicken on FIRE it would have been better.  But I got some great char marks (haha) and baked it off the rest of the way in the oven.  It was so moist and had fantastic flavor!  Thank you!

This was good! I didn't use a whole chicken, but I used breasts for the two of us.  Tasted great, easy to make.  Letting it marinate makes a huge difference.

I ran out of fresh rosemary so I used Cavenders greek seasoning in place of the spices and I did what Navy Mom did ....I put everything in a ziploc bag and then froze the chicken breasts. Served this with the Elegant Orzo and spinach from this site. Thanks.

I served this with brown rice pilaf cooked in chicken broth, containing sun dried tomatoes, garlic, chopped celery and black olives and I tossed in fresh diced green onions at the end and topped with feta cheese. Steamed broccoli on the side made a great meal, even left over!

This was amazing! I used chicken legs because those are my boyfriend's favorite and I used some thin boneless skinless chicken breasts. I bought extra meat and made 2 dishes of marinade to soak them in. I only marinaded for 8-9hrs but the taste was unbelievable. I used the extra thin sliced boneless chicken for chicken salad and he said it had such a good flavor.

For Joan K, the fuss about it is that is extremely tasty, easy,fast and good for a hot summer night. I made chicken kobobs and served them  with couscous w/mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes from this site. I'm making them at least once a week and I never heard "again this?".Thank you Karen, your recipe deserves 10 stars!

This recipe was great! I doubled the recipe and made it for a group of 16. I used boneless, skinless breasts and thighs and cooked them on the George Foreman grill to save the hassle of grilling for such a large group. I used all fresh herbs and marinated the chicken overnight. Wonderful!

This dish was very easy to make. The marinade has just the right blend of herbs.  We found it needed salt, but that could easily be added to taste at the table.  I used a combination of bone-in and boneless breasts and, because it is the middle of winter,  baked them at 350 for about an hour.  The bone-in breasts seemed to have more flavor for some reason.  Will definitely make this more often!

I did this in a hurry - only marinated for an hour, didn't dice it, then stuck it on the George Foreman - and it was great. Chicken was very juicy and moist.

I never had a chance to try this chicken as it was all gone before I could try it! But the review from friends thought it was great! I cooked it on skewers to reduce cooking time and added green and red pepper as well. Cooks in about 3 minutes per side on the barbeque.

This is a good recipe. I followed the directions for marinating and instead of grilling, baked in a 350 degree oven for about 45 minutes. I would definitely make this again. Thanks!

So good and so easy.  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and cooked them on my George Foreman grill.  They only take about 4-5 minutes, depending on the thickness of your chicken pieces.  I would add a pinch of salt to marinade.  Very tender, juicy and flavorful.

Delicious! We loved it. I only marinated the chicken about 4 hours and cooked on a rack in my oven. I basted it continually to keep it moist. Will cook it on the grill too sometime - sure was good.

This was an excellent Greek chicken recipe.  We all loved it.  My son gave it an A+.  The rosemary really adds a special flavor.  Next time I may try grilling the chicken on our George Foreman to see how it comes out.  I highly recommend it!  Bravosas!

Four stars based on l had to add 1-2 tbsp of salt. It will be bland without it.
Otherwise, this marinade is a win!

Fabulous marinade!  Do yourself a favor and use the FRESH herbs as advised.  I strongly suggest letting the chicken marinate for at least 24 hours to get the full delicious effect, (obviously less time for just boneless/skinless breasts!)  Also, I DO add some salt to the marinade.

I made it twice with the same batch. I preferred when it was marinated over night rather than the 8 hours. It took on more of a lemon flavor and was moist.

I marinated the chicken for two days in the refrigerator.   I oven baked at 375 for 45 minutes.  I lined a tray with parchment paper then used a cooling rack to hold the chicken above the sheet.  The breasts were as juicy and moist as the thighs and legs.  Definite keeper!

I love this marinade. I have made it twice. Marinating overnight was the best, but even a few hours was good. We BBQ'd the chicken. . Delicious, used dark meat once, white meat the second time.  I sliced the boneless chicken breasts thin before marinating.  I will try this with beef and lamb also.

Absolutely refreshing. This meal made you feel well fed, but didn't make you feel really full. It was a perfect balance. I served it with tzatziki and pita bread.

Very tasty. I marinated for only 1 hour, then baked skinless, boneless chicken breasts in the oven (covered) at 350* for 1 hour. It was juicy and full of flavor.

I would follow other reviewers' advice next time I make this & marinade the chicken the night before cooking it for dinner. I think it needs that extra time to meld the flavors. 

For 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts I made the following changes:
1 tsp of the dried herbs
Juice of 1 lemon
1/4 cup oil
Mixed in a Ziploc with chicken breasts.

Preheated oven to 350.
Placed marinade & breasts in a glass pan. 
Sprinkled with Tony Cachere's seasoned salt & pepper.
Covered with aluminum foil.
Baked for 30 minutes.

Served over a Greek salad. Delish!

I combined this recipe with a tzatziki recipe as well as some homemade pitas (both found on this site) and made a great dinner. I shredded the chicken, and made extra of everything so that if we have a crazy night we can just throw together a yummy greek pita! It works great, and we're now going to use it in our meal rotation for sure. I didn't end up grilling the chicken because I don't have a grill. I pan fried chicken tenderloins and breasts, and it was just fine. I imagine this type of chicken would be good grilled, pan fried, or baked.

I used skinless chicken thighs and marinated for 2 days, didn't have lemon juice so I subbed a squeeze of lime and had dried herbs on hand.  Used my cast iron grill pan (I LOVE this thing - perfect for the winter, it's just awesome) and cooked on medium heat for 15 mins.  The chicken was moist and delicious.

I only had time to marinade for about 8 hours, but in that time my chicken didn't pick up much flavor. If I make this again, I'd marinade for at least a day, maybe two.

What is all the fuss about?  I found that it needed like a sauce to go with it.  I marinated it for over 24 hours too.  Served with either feta or Tzaiki (sp) would be a must for us if we were to make it again.

I made this recipe a few weeks ago. I cooked the chicken on a George Foreman tempered grill. I used boneless chicken breasts. My wife and son loved it.  We ate the left overs on a salad the next day. I'm making it again today, but I'm going to try injecting a whole chicken with the marinade and putting it in the rotisserie.

I planned for this for dinner, picked up all the fresh herbs after work, but when I checked the recipe when I got home, I was so annoyed at myself for not realizing I needed to marinade overnight. I threw the oil in a bowl anyway with all the herbs, I added a good tbsp. of garlic powder, salt and pepper and dredged the chicken breasts (skin on)in the spice mix. Squeezed a little fresh lemon over top, added a sprinkle of lemon pepper, not too much. Baked at 400 for about 40 minutes, until no longer pink. Served with a Greek salad. Delish! I can just imagine how much better the flavors would be next time when I marinate overnight. Give this a try, you won't be disappointed.

Chicken was lovely. I am a sucker for rosemary. I used a whole chicken but next time I would use boneless skinless chicken breasts just because they are so much easier.

This is sooooo delicious! I was preparing a Greek inspired menu for some business associates & this filled the bill perfectly. Since I love spice, I added a couple of chopped Serrano peppers to the marinade for half the chicken & it great. All my guests loved it.

This is a great recipe. My first time trying Greek food and it turned out wonderful. The only thing I did differently was add half a cup of Greek yogurt. The taste and aroma was paradise. I paired it with brown rice pilaf and a side salad. Thanks for sharing

We loved it, and I didn't have time to let it marinade long in the herb mixture, only about 1/2 hour. Cooked it on our electric grill (the kind that closes and cooks from the top at the same time) so it only took about 10 min (half way through I turned the chicken breasts as one side of the grill always seems to cook at a bit highter temp) And I just used real lemon juice as I didn't have any fresh lemons. Would definitely make this again!

Excellent!  

I had some leftover lemon olive oil so I used that instead of regular oil. It was delicious and easy to make. I did not have time to marinate it for the recommended time but it was still good. 

I made greek wraps with hummus, taziki sauce.

I followed the recipe for the marinade using the fresh herbs. Marinaded cut-up chicken tenderloins and then made into kabobs.  I grilled the chicken kabobs along with pepper and onion kabobs and served with grilled flat bread.  I'll put it in rotation.  Easy to make & yummy!

This was good. The seasoning was right on and had a great taste. I marinated for about 8 hours, I really think that wasn't enough time. Next time I will marinade overnight. I don't understand what about this recipe is Greek though... its just seasoned chicken, nothing Greek about it.

This recipe is AWESOME! I used cut up boneless skinless chicken breast so I could put them on skewers. I added a bit more lemon to the mixture along with some white pepper. I didn't have the time to let it sit overnight so waited only an hour and a half before grilling, but WOW. The flavor was outstanding. I will be making this over and over again.

This is probably the 4th grilled chicken on this site that I have made for my kitchen. This was was just 'okay' simply because I found the chicken was alittle dry compared to other recipes I've used before. Also, if you leave the chicken overnight to marinate, then the olive oil combined with the lemon juice will solidify which is not great and caused my bbq to smoke up quite a bit. Giving this recipe a B-

This chicken was great!  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and a few tablespoons olive oil since I didn't have as much chicken as called for.  I was only able to marinate for 4 hours but it still turned out tasting great.  Great and easy recipe thanks!

I really liked the flavor in this chicken, but it was a little rubbery for me (I cooked this in the oven, but the temp was a little higher then I usually have it!).  I will try this again for sure when the weather is a little nicer and see if I can do better on the grill!

I marinated chicken legs in this marinade, and it was very, very good. The only thing I think it was missing was salt - but we added this once it was cooked, to taste.  Very good recipe...and it didnt stick to the grill!

My family went crazy over this recipe! I let it marinade for about a day and a half and I used skinless boneless breasts.  The only thing I would do differently is maybe salt the chicken before putting it in the marinade, it was almost a little bland, but everyone scarfed it down.  And the next day they put it on a spinach salad and said it was to die for.  I will definately make this one again, just add a little salt to it.

This was a huge hit with the kids and the spouse.  Tangy, tasty.  We marinated it overnight and the lemon juices practically cooked the chicken through, so we just popped on the grill for a few minutes for the finishing touch.  Delicious!

This is my family's favorite chicken recipe. I use boneless skinless chicken breasts. Also, for a quick dinner, I have substituted a 1 and half teaspoon of Italian seasoning (dried) with salt and pepper instead of the fresh herbs. Still a hit.

This was delicious and easy.  I used 2.5 lbs. of boneless, skinless chicken tenders and I did use fresh herbs.  I let this marinate overnight and the chicken turned out great, very flavorful.  I served 5THSISTER'S Yougurt cucumber sauce with it.

I only had 15 min. to marinade, but used this recipe as a basis.  It was a hit!  My changes were to add a generous amount of garlic powder, subbed generous amount of onion powder for onion, fresh garlic that I ran through a garlic press, and extra oregano.

Good.  Followed other reviewers suggestion to add potatoes to chicken pan.  Next time would remove the skin from the thighs to reduce fat, but very good and flavorful.  Potatoes turned out beautifully soft and yet a slight crunch around the edges.  Very simple dish to assemble.

Very nice, light flavor. I used 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of a chicken quartered. I also grated 5 cloves of garlic instead of 3 chopped. Simple and versatile, I serve this with brocolli or over a salad for a light dinner.

Wonderful, Greek flavor. I used chicken breasts, butterflied for quick cooking.  They marinated for only a couple of hours and I grilled them on a cast iron grill.  I served them with pita bread, cucumber, tomato and tzatziki sauce.  Great meal!

Way too lemony for my taste. Definitely not worth the time (or money) to marinate then cook this entree. Will not make again :(

Very good flavor. We used a couple of pounds of chicken and still had plenty of marinade. I used all dried herbs, including the garlic (used garlic powder). I added the equivalent of 2 extra cloves of garlic (we like garlic a lot), and I also added the zest of 1 of the lemons I juiced. We only marinated for about 3 hours. We used chicken legs and boneless, skinless chicken breasts and it tasted great on both.

This chicken came out wonderful! I usually use boneless skinless chicken breasts. I always make extra to have the next day cut up on a salad.  The whole family loves it.  Always look forward to grilling season to make this recipe.

This is great.  I've made it a few times already and it is so simple to put together.  I've also marinated some pork chops in this and those tasted great.  A good way to use up my fresh rosemary and thyme.

Could have been zestier. The marinade smelled great but the flavor mellowed out too much during cooking. I did put foil down on the grill for the first half of grilling time - and then let it "blacken" (and it really did!) for the last half.

This was a good marinade - it kept the chicken moist.  To me, it wasn't much different than another other citrus based marinade ... nothing too greek about it.

This chicken is excellent.  I have prepared both on the barbeque and in the oven.  It turns out well no matter how I cook it.  I have also substitued dried oregano, rosemary and thyme for the fresh (about 1 tsp of each).

So easy, and totally fool proof. I "grilled" the chicken in a cast iron grilling pan, and it was so wonderfully moist and flavourful. It looks nice cooked up and other than the marinating, it is really fast.

This really is a great marinade.  I did not change anything in the recipe and marinated boneless, skinless chicken breasts overnight then grilled them on medium high for 7 minutes each side.  A wonderful lemony flavor. Yum!

This was a great recipe!  I used chicken breasts and due to a change in dinner plans, they marinated for 2 days.  I baked them at 350 for about 45 minutes and they were so juicy and had a lot of flavor.

My picky family LOVED IT! I didn’t use any fresh herbs, just used the herbs in my spice cabinet and it was still so yummy!! Don’t skimp on the marinade time. I did 8 hours and it was delicious; but 24 hours would make this killer!!! The chicken was tender and juicy. Great option for weekly meal prep.

This tastes pretty good! :) Would make again, likely regularly. Might add some more lemon juice in the future.

I followed "msoulusa"'s review comment and baked the chicken. 

"I could give this receipe six stars, taste great. It is a little cold to be grilling outside so I cook it in the oven instead. 375 for about 25 minutes covered with aluminum foil, removed the foil turned on the broiler and cooked about 10 minutes to add some nice color to it. Don't forget the wine for the cook, that is very important." - by  msoulusa

I followed the recipe exactly and marinated my chicken overnight, completely forgetting that all that lemon juice was going to be in contact with the chicken for hours on end.... the result was what I called "Gray Rubber Chicken" and it was not even edible. I threw out the entire dish, got take out for the family and spent the rest of the evening cleaning and deodorizing the entire house which stank like nothing I've ever experienced. 

If I was going to attempt this again.... I wouldn't. I know for sure I've done a lemon Greek chicken that wasn't a disaster but this clearly wasn't it. The only thing I can think of is that *maybe* this would work if you only marinate a very short while like 30 minutes and grilling the meat would be an absolute necessity. 

I'm  honestly jealous that so many other people had success with this recipe as the idea of it is so delicious. Oh well. I will try again!

Wowzers! Amazing flavor even after just 3 hours of marinating. I added plain greek yogurt to the ingredients and i only had 1 large juicy lemon that i also zested.  I also used Cavendars Greek seasoning. This was delicious as chicken gyro sandwiches with homemade tzatziki sauce, tomatoes,  cucumbers and feta.

Loved this recipe! Marinated the chicken for 16 hrs instead of 8 lol! Skipped the rosemary because I'm allergic and added a about half teaspoon of basil instead.  Came out delicious!

Awesome great recipe, I did make one  change and cooked the green beans on the range. Next time I will follow the recipe all the way, the cooking aromas are just as wonderful as each bite, this is going to be on our menu in the future.

This dish was amazing! Instead of using a whole chicken, I used two chicken breasts and halved the quantities on the ingredients. The spice blend was amazing, the oil allowed for a juicy meat and good color, and the lemon gave it a bit of pop. Served with pita bread, cucumbers, tzatziki, rice and feta cheese. Was a hit for entertaining and relatively easy. I wasn't able to allow the chicken to marinate for hours, but 45 minutes did the marinade justice. I would definitely recommend this!

I made it according to the directions. I only used 2 pounds of chicken and refrigerated the extra marinate (non contaminated) And to my delight it was just wright. Not too strong or overpowering. Made 2 more pounds of chicken with the leftover marinate 1 week later. Even better the second time around. I will entertain family and friends in the week ahead. A grand slam!

This was okay.  The marinade didn't give it that much flavor and the end result chicken was good, but not awesome.  I would probably look for a different marinade next time.  Or, if I'm in a pinch I would use this but just use dried spices since I would have all the ingredients on hand.

This recipe is easy and delicious! I followed the ingredients list exactly but didn't measure anything. I went heavy on everything especially the garlic--I just used the jarred pre-minced kind--and  fresh squeezed lemon juice.  I threw it all in a freezer ziploc with >2lbs of chicken breast tenders in the morning and tossed it the fridge. For dinner, I laid the tenders on a cookie sheet with sides and baked at 350 until cooked--about 20min or so. I paired the tenders with homemade tziziki from another super easy recipe on this site--the first one that comes up. I added some chopped tomatoes and rommanine and fresh pita bread, and we made sandwiches with it. It was FANTASTIC. My young adult son (who rarely admits to liking anything I cook these days) told me numerous time that night and even the next day how yummy it was. Our family of four finished the entire batch with nothing for leftovers. This recipe is going into our regular rotation. Super easy dinner and almost no clean-up.

Yummy! I followed the recipe exactly, except I cooked these in the oven. I used chicken leg quarters and marinated them for 18 hours. 350 degrees, covered, for 45 minutes. I took the cover off and drained the juices. I then broiled them for 10-15 minutes, until the skins were crisp and browned.  I served this with Chef John's Rice Pilaf recipe (from this site) and a side salad. It was a winner!

I used less  olive oil & a little more garlic probably (I'm heavy-handed with the garlic), & unfortunately had to use the cabinet spices-not fresh- but man! This dish was a hit with the whole family! We didn't even get to marinate it ahead of time for more than a half hour, & with no salt, it tasted fabulous! It didn't need salt! Hooray!

Made the marinade exactly as described, the first time around, and it was good, but a few minor tweaks enhanced it. I used the zest from one of the lemons, a couple of pounds of chicken thighs and saved aside  about a 1/4 cup of marinade. I put veggies on skewers (mushrooms, peppers, zucchini, red onion) and basted them with the extra marinade while we grilled the chicken. The veggies and chicken both turned out great!

This is an excellent and delicious dish. I used wings (cut into flats and drumettes) and instead of lemon I used lime (limes are a little sweeter) and marinated for 24 hours as suggested. One of the best grilled chicken recipes ever!

I used a two pound pack of chicken breasts-made it for two-so I cut back on the seasonings and lemon juice a bit and used dried herbs instead of fresh. It was absolutely delicious. This will become a staple.

Great! Going to make some changes next time. I will be using boneless skinless chicken thighs and stabbing them all with a fork a bit so the marinade really gets into the meat. Marinate at least overnight. I would recommend 2 days. Great with the good for you greek salad, pitas and hummus.

I varied the amounts of ingredients slightly, such as I used whole butterflied chicken verses chicken pieces, grilled on charcoal grill rather than oven baked, otherwise followed suggested directions and will for sure do this again this is a life long favorite, also works well with fish or shrimp and straining the left over marinade and heating it then allowing it to cool makes an awesome dipping sauce

I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts since hubby doesn't care for dark meat.  I cut the chicken into strips & then cut slits in the meat to allow the marinade to reach all the crevices.  I've let these marinate up to 2 days in the refrigerator.  These are yummy and so good chopped up & put on salads  (Greek salads are a summertime favorite!)  Plan on making a large batch as these freeze very well.  Just let thaw and grill as usual.

Followed recipe as is and grilled the chicken. Came out tender and juicy and nice slight flavor. I then added a little Mrs. Dash which made it pop more. Overall good as it's healthier alternative.

I also used boneless, skinless chicken breasts; cut them into chunks; let marinate for about 8 hours and then skewered and grilled. If I were to do that again, I'd probably use thighs instead, in hopes of getting some flavor into the dish. I really did think it turned out very bland.

Used beef instead of chicken, and marinated it a bit longer. Came out way to lemony, would not make again.

I absolutely love this recipe and my family loves eating it.   The marinade makes this wonderful.  The lemon juice gives the chicken such great flavor.  I've cooked this in the oven and pan broiled...either way, the flavor is incredible.

It's easy to make and very tasty. You can bake it in the oven, but  keep your fan running. I cut back on the oil, since you don't really need a half cup of oil.  Also, I made it in my mini-blender. It blends the seasonings, lemon and oil beautifully, and they don't separate.  The chicken was very tasty.

This was very good, though it might've been a slightly too lemony for my mom. (The 2 lemons came out to 1/2 cup of juice). I decided to make the marinade (with a teaspoon of each of the dried herbs, and added a few extra garlic cloves) and let it sit overnight. In the morning I added 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts to the marinade, and later in the afternoon covered it with foil and baked it in the oven at 350 for 25 minutes. Per another reviewer's suggestion, I also broiled it for about 10 minutes to give it some color. Came out very tender and moist. Great recipe. Will definitely be making again, though next time I will try using fresh herbs.

very good recipe. The next time I make it I will use chicken breast pounded to be the same thickness. My chicken breast were to large my own fault but the marinate is great

Delicious! I baked it in the oven at 425 for about 30 minutes with grape tomatoes and crumbled feta cheese on top about ten minutes before it was done.

Excellent!  Nice amount of lemon and spice.  I used boneless skinless chicken breast, which was good, but bone-in chicken pieces would even be better.  This recipe will be a regular on my menu plan!

Great marinade!  Could dial down thyme and rosemary If you are waiting 8  hours.
This dish can rival ANY purchased at a local greek  restaurant.

I was very dissapointed in the flavor of this.  I marinated it for 2 days.  For the amount of chicken called for, I would triple the amount of marinade.  I will try it again to see if that helps.

Family seemed to like it a lot. I was a little disapointed, but over all it got a 4 star at our house. The first time I used the whole chicken. We liked it better went I used tenderloins or breat instead of chicken on the bone.

I used split breasts and added salt to the marinade; very moist and great taste.  I liked how the lemon taste was subtle and not overpowering.  Will make this again.

I really liked this but I used dry ingredients instead of fresh.  I think next time I'm going to add a little more lemon.  I marinated for 2 days and I would have liked the lemon to be more prominent.  Thanks!

This is a great base recipe. The chicken comes out flavorful and tender. I knew to add my favorite seasonings for chicken, salt pepper and cayenne to suit our tastes. Without these the recipe would be a bit bland.

With the first bite, I instantly knew that I spent WAY too much time preparing a mediocre recipe. Cutting and chopping the three tablespoons of fresh herbs took an aweful lot of time for the end results.  I won't be making this again.

I marinated the chicken for two day's rather then the shorter time suggested. Grilled on very low heat for an hour, the end result was a very moist and very tasteful bird.

This recipe was very tasty. I only marinated it for 6 hours or we would have eaten at 11pm!! Good flavor, served with greek salad and greek potatoes.

I followed this recipe as originally submitted except for the following revisions:  1).  used dried oregano instead of fresh oregano (but I DID use fresh rosemary and thyme) 2).  I let the chicken marinate for more than 48 hours.  With that said, I was very disappointed with the final results.  While the chicken did turn out very moist, it was extremely bland.  Not sure why?  I thought the extra marinating would make it more flavorful.  As a result, I would be very hesitant to try again considering how much I had to pay for the fresh herbs.  Didn't have the WOW factor I expected, but wasn't necessarily bad either, thus the 3 star rating.

This was very tasty.  My husband has already asked me to make this again.  I think it could stand to have more lemon flavor, as the lemon flavor just didn't stand out.  Next time I will definitely double the lemon.  Even so, it was very moist and flavorful.  And sooo easy to make.  I broiled it in the oven instead of using the grill.  With the pan on the second rack closest to the top (top rack is too close) I broiled the chicken with the oven door slightly ajar.  Just waited till the chicken was a little brown, then flipped the breasts, and repeated.  I served this with a Greek salad and I also made cheese filled phyllo triangles.  Very filling meal.

This was pretty good.  Nice addition to the collection - since we eat a lot of chicken, it's nice to have several different varieties of recipes to choose from.  I started to buy fresh herbs but I would have had $10 tied up in them, and only one use.  So I used dried like others suggested.  It wasn't quite as moist as I was hoping, but I think it was because I didn't get quite enough juice out of my lemon.  I'd love to try this with fresh herbs so I'm considering growing my own herb garden.

We altered this recipe a bit by cutting boneless chicken breasts into cubes and making kabobs.  The marinade is great and this way allows the chicken to take on a lot of flavor!

The flavor was fabulous.  But next time I'll use boneless chicken breasts and thighs.  The bones made the chicken cook unevenly.  The oil actually made our gas grill fill with flames!  Scarey.

I made this with mixture of bone-in legs and thighs and boneless chicken breasts. The bone-in chicken was better but it was all very good.  The company asked for the recipe.  That is always a good sign that the recipe was a success.

This was very good. I used skinless boneless breast cut into stips. We grilled it quickly and it really stayed moist. This is one the whole family enjoyed.

Excellent recipe, which we have as a regular meal now. A little prep work is required, but it's worth it. Sometimes I add a little feta cheese on top.

Pretty good.  I baked the chicken in the oven instead of grilling it and it was fine.  Served with a romaine salad with feta cheese and Greek dressing.

I used chicken breasts cut into pieces for kabobs, and it was a hit! Very very tasty, and I have made it several times.  It needs to be marinated for at least a few hours to get the full effect, otherwise a lot of the flavour is lost.  I serve it with greek salad and crusty bread.

Just barely 4 stars for us.  I used 1lb of boneless skinless breasts, pounded to even thickness, and halved the marinade ingredients.  We thought this needed something more... salt? hot pepper flakes? more herbs?  It's an easy, light dish, so I'll keep tinkering until we think it's perfect.

This is a delicious recipe. If you like it spicy like my family,I would sprinkle seasonings over chicken before grilling because much of the zing is lost when removing from the marinade.
