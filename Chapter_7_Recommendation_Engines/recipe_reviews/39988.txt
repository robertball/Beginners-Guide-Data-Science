This salsa has a wonderful flavor.  Adding all the sugar produces a salsa like you would serve on meat.  My last batch I left the 3 1/2 cups sugar out and it makes more of a chip dipping salsa.  Either way is great!

I include 1 peeled, chopped mango and the juice of the lime too. Using red onion makes it even more colorful. Agree that less sugar & more vinegar gives it a bit more "zing" and we like it that way. It's great alongside grilled fish or chicken too. My kind of recipe; easy but impressive and versital.

This isn't salsa. This is jam. If you want salsa, leave out the pectin and so much sugar. In fact, leave out all the sugar. As a jam, the recipe rates a higher star rating, but as a salsa the recipe gets just two stars.

Wow! I have made 5 batches of this salsa, the last two times using frozen peaches, drained well.  I also have been using only 2 1/2 c. sugar, as the original recipe was a little too sweet for us, though still worth 5 stars.

I only gave it 4 stars because I onle added 2 cups of sugar instead of 3 1/2 and I think it is still to sweet to eat with chips.  It's fantastic for chicken or pork though.  I think I will make another batch with very little sugar to eat with chips.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

This was awesome. I did do some touching up though. I didn't add any sugar since my peaches were very sweet and ripe and I added a 32 ounce can of chopped tomatoes and a 4 ounce can of tomato paste. I also only used 1 jalapeno since my kids would be eating it. I made 15 pint size jars and I am making more today!! Excellent recipe!!

I was looking for a recipe to recreate the famous Harry and David's peach salsa when I found this.  My entire family says it is better than Harry and David's.  It is very addictive especially with Nacho Doritos!

We loved this!  I cut back on the sugar, 1 1/4 cup TOTAL, but kept everything else the same.  I was a little bummed that it only gave me 2 pint size jars and a bit, so I ended up making another batch to round it up to 5 jars.  It didn't fill the last jar so it is in the fridge cooling for later, yum yum! Overall, delicious!  I can't wait for next peach season and I will quadruple the recipe!!!

This salsa is really sweet and earthy tasting.  I added a few extra jalepenos because mine were so incredibly mild.  I also only use 3 1/2 cups of sugar instead of four, I think that's plenty.  If you are looking for a spicier version of this, I'd suggest putting in a WHOLE lot more hot stuff.  As it is, this is one of our favorite salsas- sweet, earthy and tangy.

This recipe is fantastic.  I needed something to do with an over abundance of peaches last year.  My family ate peach salsa all year long.  We like it with chips, but I'm sure it would be great on grilled meat.  It's really sweet.  I only wish the peach crop was better this year.

I really liked this salsa, although I only used about 1/16 of the sugar it called for and 1/3 of the pectin.  It was very good but not too spicy so I made it again with these alterations. I added extra red peppers, onion, and jalapenos.  I didn't use any cumin or pectin, and still just a small amount of sugar. (I quadrupled the batch and only used a 1 Cup total of sugar) It was FABULOUS! My family liked this version even better!

We LOVE this salsa!  Our local peach orchard had a bumper crop of peaches this summer and we were looking for something different to do with all those fresh peaches and happened upon this recipe.  My husband has made multiple batches of this recipe and has given out small jars as gifts and we've gotten rave reviews every time it's served.  This is a versatile accompaniment to grilled meats and is great as an appetizer with cream cheese & crackers,   Already looking forward to the next big peach crop!

I didn't follow the recipe exactly... I left out the gelatin and replaced the sugar with a few tablespoons of honey, I also added 4 chopped mangoes.  I wanted it to be more of juicy salsa instead of a sweet jam.  The flavors are AWESOME!  It's a little sweet, a little hot and totally addicting!

This is a wonderful salsa, BUT I thought it sounded too sweet, so I only used 1/4 cup of sugar and it was still delicious. I also included the juice of one lime. I think that the next time I make it I will leave out the pectin as well.  Not sure what the point of the pectin is, because a salsa is not a jelly. This has great seasoning and flavor. Oh, yeah, I used a red onion. Don't hold back on the jalapenos!

Excellent the way it is, but I never have everything a recipie calls for, used all of the medium sized red pepper so it was a little over 1/2 cup, used parsley instead of cilantro, and used lemon zest instead of lime.  4 cups of fresh peaches was 12 off of the tree.  The next time I made it I used fresh peaches I had frozen, and not as much cumin as my jar was almost empty.  Still turned out great.  The salsa makes a great gift for your non cooking friends.

I am a wide variety of salsa connoisseur, and I must say that this is the most unexpectedly addicting salsa that I have experienced.  I recently moved into a house with a fruiting peach tree and ended up transforming the entire thing into variations of this salsa!  
I would recommend altering the recipe with more jalapenos/onions and/or less sugar if you want a more traditional salsa taste.  
A 5 star for sure!

This is amazing salsa. Be sure to taste and adjust peach amouts if the cilantro and green chilies start to overwhelm the "salsa taste and color". I made the inital batch as written, 2nd  batch more peaches, 2+ tsp. lime zest. Great on fish or chicken or just straight onto chips!

My friend gave me a box of peaches over the weekend and I didn't just want to can them.  I made your salsa tonight and it is great!  I have never used pectin before and it made the recipe! I got all the ingredients from my garden except the garlic and sugar.  I was somewhat skeptical about the amount of sugar, but after it all boiled together it was perfect!I would like to enter your recipe in the state fair.  Bravo!

Due to reading reviews I made sure to taste the salsa before adding the additional sugar, and sure enough it was plenty sweet on its own.  Delicious! Will definitely be making this again and again...

Just made my first batch of this and would have to say it's wonderful. Will be making more with little less sugar as my 13 year old says it's little to sweet for him. The picky 8 year old says he loves it the way it is and has not put the bowl down. Thanks for the great recipe.

Awesome! This was my first attempt at canning and it went great. I did add a few fresh tomatoes to the salsa, and I did not add the extra 3 1/2 cups of sugar. I can't imagine how sweet it would be if I had. My peaches were very ripe and I think that the salsa has a good sweet/tangy taste. If you want a hotter salsa, I would add more jalepenos or keep the seeds in them. I doubled the recipes and ended up with 11 jars of salsa! Definately a keeper!

Made this with my 11 year old daughter as our first try at canning with a Ball starter kit (3 x pint jars). While tasty, this recipe unfortunately fell short - literally - as it only produced 2-1/2 jars. I was afraid this might happen so I had already added a bit more on the peaches, onion, and red pepper, plus a 1/2 cup of frozen corn. Next time I will add an extra cup of peaches and add'l corn, pepper, etc. Also, I read about the sugar reduction suggestions so cut back to 1/2 cup of white sugar (on top of the initial 1/4 cup) then used 1 cup of brown sugar, and 2 Tbls of honey, plus dashes of cinnamon, ground cloves, and nutmeg. Calling it Maria's Caribbean Peach Salsa (Maria is my 11 year old daughter).

just made this salsa recipe- it is way too sweet.  I even cut back the sugar but still sweet.  Would probably call it peach preserves rather than salsa.

I just made this salsa, and have only tasted what was left in the pan after canning the other, but what I had is awesome!  We just dipped a cracker in it to taste it, but I can imagine the possibilities are endless.  I left all of the seeds in my jalapenos, so it has quite a kick, but we like things spicey.  It reminds me a lot of the jalapeno jelly that I make, the taste, but more of a sauce than a jelly.  I will definitely be making this again.  I would like to try one that is more of an actual salsa (without the pectin), but love this!

We LOVE this salsa!  We cut back on the sugar like some had suggested (1 and 1/4 cups total) and it was perfect. My only question -- while it was still warm, the consistancy seemed just right. After being in the refrigerator, it was too thick and gel-like. I've never used pectin before. Would reducing the amount of pectin keep the salsa from becoming so thick?

Great base for a peach salsa recipe. I omitted the 3 1/2c sugar in favor of more hot peppers, a little more vinegar, added green and red peppers for more color and red onion.  Added some salt to off set the 1/4c sugar.  Very good!

I added sugar to taste, my family likes a more spicy salsa.  My first batch I made without pectin and thought was a little runny.  My second batch I added 2 tablespoons of pectin which added a just a little viscosity and I thought this was perfect.

Excellent salsa!!   Next time I will make a double batch; it's delicious while it's hot, too.  I didn't add as much sugar as mentioned by others, but tasted as I added and got it just right for my taste.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe, Lori!!

Very tasty, but with the pectin added it came out a little too thick, more like a salsa jam.  I agree it is better as a meat condiment than a dipping salsa.  Also great on cream cheese.

Wonderful salsa/jam. I didn't change anything in the recipe and it came out perfect. May try changing/adding a few things next time like another reviewer used mango and substituting red onion for regualr onion.  We use it as a topping for chicken or pork.

A fabulous salsa. I've canned several pints each peach season for the past couple of years. I don't add as many jalapenos though - we don't like it too spicy. I just add them until it tastes just right, and it gets spicier as it sits, too. Friends and family rave about this salsa and are always asking for another jar!

Being inspired by a jar of peach salsa from the local grocery store, I made this.  WHAT A SUPRISE!!!  We LOVED THIS BETTER than the store's.  We will be making this again, and for many years to come!  Thank you for such a great recipe!

Used only about 1/2 cup of sugar, and added some extra jalapenos - delicious!  Great with chips!  Didn't have any pectin, so just skipped it, and it was still great!

Yum! This is VERY good. I probably should have seeded my Jalapeno peppers, it is pretty hot, but we like hot! I like tart and tangy, so I only added 1 cup of sugar (on top of the 1/4 of a cup mixed with the pectin). I also squeezed some of the juice from half a lime in there.

In addition to a red pepper, I also added a yellow and an orange peppers to make the salsa more colorful and flavorful. I also doubled the peaches and other ingredients so I could get more salsa(I got 8 pint jars).

I don’t like to rate something that I have made changes to, but this one is the exception. I never would have had such good salsa if I didn’t start with this recipe. I made it just as the recipe called for up until the pectin and sugar. Then, because I didn’t want a thick jam like salsa I took other reviewers suggestions and cut the sugar to 2 cups and the pectin to 1/2 pkg. I have been making this for about 4 years now but this years batch was the best. Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent tasting except way too much cumin.  Cut it back to one teaspoon, or maybe even a half.

I found Holly Jorgensen’s review very helpful.
I also added 32 ounces of tomatoes and 4 oz tomato paste.  I eliminated the pectin and sugar. I did add  1/4 cup brown sugar, salt, 1/2 t allspice and 4 drops of Franks Redhot..
I really love Newman’s Own peach salsa so added some of those ingredients. But! This was an excellent base recipe.

I really liked this salsa. I may try it with a little less sugar next time. However, it's good as is! Canned peach salsa would make a great gift!

Made this for the first time tonight. Followed many comments and didn't use the pectin or full amount of sugar. I only used 1/2 a cup for a double batch, and it was still really sweet. I liked it, but hubby would prefer less sweet, so next time I'll leave out the sugar completely or add more vinegar. It was easy and has a great flavor, though. Can't wait to try it on some meat. It's delicious with chips, even hot! Take note that if you omit the sugar, you will drastically reduce the yield. I only got about 6 cups total (6 half-pint jars) and I doubled everything but the sugar.

I have made this both with the sugar and the pectin and without.  I like it without because I like the kick that a salsa should have for my chips.  Either way it has turned out great each time!

I made this salsa as directed,  and wish I had read other reviews first.  Definitely too sweet!  I'll try it next year with way less sugar and also skip the pectin.

I got rave reviews by adding a 32 oz can of diced tomatoes and only used the 1/2 cup of sugar. Healthier and delicious.  Everyone who tries it says it is the best they have ever had!
