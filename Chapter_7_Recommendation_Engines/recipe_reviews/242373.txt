These ribs are awesome!!!  I've made them twice, once in the oven and once in a stove top smoker. Both times they tasted great!! My husband loves them. I only omitted the cayenne so it wouldn't be too spicy for my son. I also used a pre-made raspberry chipotle sauce, purchased at a wholesale store. The ribs are really good with just the rub or with the sauce too. I will be making these regularly. Thanks!!!
