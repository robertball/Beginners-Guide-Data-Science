I'm sure this is delicious but--buy the Pepperidge Farm puff pastry circle things. Thaw and roll those out, put the chicken in the middle and pinch together -very easy!  The pastry sheets were difficult to say the least -what a mess. I just happen to have some of the circle puff pastry and they were so much easier. Also, after all of the problem with the pastry sheets (too dry, cracked, no cutting board that big! -probably most of the problems were my fault) and after all the effort, the frozen spinach tasted just like that -frozen spinach.  My boyfriend liked everything but the spinach. If I was going to go through all the steps to make this delicious chicken -I would never, ever use frozen spinach. Maybe saute/drain/squeeze out water of fresh spinach until dry instead?

I tried out this recipe because I was looking to use up some extra ingredients I had laying around, but not a fan.  I added only a dash of nutmeg for flavor, but I was hesitant about adding it at all, and I now wish I'd omitted it altogether.  It tasted weird and my husband and I weren't impressed.  There also wasn't much flavor in this.  I added minced garlic to the spinach and that helped a little, as well as adding shredded mozzarella on top before sealing the puff.  However, it was very easy to make and would taste much better with some additional seasonings.
