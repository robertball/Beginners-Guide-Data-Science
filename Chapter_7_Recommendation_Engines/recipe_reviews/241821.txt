Wonderful! Easy to put together, fast and simple yet sophisticated in flavour. I used gluten free rice crisps instead of baguette. The thyme and balsamic vinegar are great together. Thank you Saveur for this great recipe!

Absolutely delicious.  Didnâ€™t use the thyme, tasted just perfect without it.

Five stars for easy plus fantastic taste. I used bruschetta toast which I will not do again. Will use the toasts recommended in the recipe, I just didn't have any on hand. The bruschetta toast makes a mess.
