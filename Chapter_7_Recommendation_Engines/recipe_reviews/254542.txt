I prepared this as written other than not adding more salt and pepper at the end as it seemed to already have plenty. While my husband was sceptical at first he actually ended up really liking them. I thought they were delicious. The kids wouldn't touch them too bad more for us! They are pretty messy to eat but they look beautiful and much fancier than the actual work involved to make them.
