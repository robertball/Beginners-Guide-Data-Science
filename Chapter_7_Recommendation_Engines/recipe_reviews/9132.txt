I don't know  how you come up with 16 servings with ingredients of this size. But thank you for helping me find this recipe. I had lost it from 25 years ago. However, my purpose in finding it, was try making it more healthy.
I substituted 1 cup of oats for the flour, 2/3 cup of splenda for the sugar, added NO brown sugar, used fruit cocktail in its own juice, 1 egg white,  in place of whole egg. It turned out great. With all the calories and fat saved, fiber increased, I splurged by putting on 4 tblsp. real lite whipping cream, from a can. That only added 30 calories. My kids and husband loved it. Now I make it every other week...GUILT FREE.

This cake was okay; my husband and sons seemed to like it better than I did.  It definitely wasn't what I was expecting. I decided to double the recipe and use a 13"x9" pan.  Like other reviewers mentioned, it was more like a cobbler. It didn't have a whole lot of flavor, and the sweetness was overpowering, to the point of leaving something of an aftertaste.  Also like other reviewers stated, I don't think it would matter what kind of canned fruit you used, because you really don't taste the individual flavors of the fruit.  I used one can of light fruit cocktail and one can of mandarin oranges, and it didn't seem to make much difference.  The fruit did make the cake nice and moist, though, and the texture was fine even after refrigeration; the top stayed crunchy and the cake didn't go soggy.  I definitely agree you could cut the amount of sugar in half.  Maybe using half white sugar and half brown sugar in the batter would help improve the flavor, and possibly adding a teaspoon or two of a spice such as cinnamon.

My mom made this cake for us when we were growing up. I decided to try it for my husband.  When mom couldnt' find her recipe, Allrecipes came to the rescue.  I substituted Splenda (white and brown) for the sugar, and it came out great.  My husband loved it.  I also used Fruit Cocktail in it's own juice instead of heavy syrup.

I first tried this recipe back in the late 1960s, but lost the recipe.  It came back when I saw "Steel Magnolias" as the Cup-a Cup-a Cake.  I made it without the egg.  And like the movie, I always serve it with good vanilla ice cream, just to cut the sugar!  Simple to make for a last minute dessert, guests think you created a master piece.....and you did!

My husband liked it a lot, though thought it could of used some spice as well.  I think I'll add a bit of nutmeg next time.  Best when eaten same day while the top is still crunchy, it goes soggy pretty fast, though I did put it back in the oven for a bit the next day and it was still pretty good.  If you like sweet, this is a good cake.

This is fantastic!!!!! I made some changes after reading the other reviews and it is awesome.
I cut the white sugar down to 1/2 cup, added cinnamon, nutmeg & allspice also added about 3/4 of a can of chopped carrots.  Then for the topping instead of brown sugar I used a topping I had from and apple crisp recipe which was 2/3 c of br sugar 1/2 c flour, 1/2 c oats, 3/4 tsp cinnamon, 3/4 tsp nutmeg & 1/3 c butter softened, mix together and sprinkle on top of batter.  I also put it in a little bigger pan, a 8 x 11" baked the cake the same as the recipe and it was to die for.

Very tasty! Perfect served warm on a chilly evening. Easy to prepare with few ingredients and with every measurement being either 1 cup, 1 tsp. or 1 can, it will be easy to memorize and whip up any time. Mine was done in about 30 minutes, so you may want to check it at the end of the baking time.

Not cool. This was so very sweet. The truly odd thing about it was that the sweetness completely lacked a flavour beyond the brown sugar. It just needed something more to it, more fruit, some spices - cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice or whatever. I'd use roughly 2 tbs of brown sugar sprinkled on top before baking & a light dusting of icing sugar after baking.

I think this recipe is really good. It reminds me of the Fruit Cocktail Cake my dad would make when I was a kid. It is very sweet as other posters have said, but that's exactly how I remember it.   Thanks for sharing this, it brought back great childhood memories for me!! :)

I don't like giving this recipe only three stars, but it really didn't come out well. It was super easy to make and mine took an hour in the oven when I made it for Easter dessert yesterday. But even though I cut the sugar by about a third, it was still overpoweringly sweet.  My other complaint is that it didn't taste at all of fruit, just of sugar (and of the cinnamon I added based on other reviewers' suggestions). I don't know what to do to make this cake taste of fruit, so I probably won't make this again.  But I'm open to suggestions.

We really enjoyed this.  I reduced the sugar in the recipe by 1/4 cup and also reduced the brown sugar that I sprinkled on top to 3 T and this was still sweet enough.  It was perfect this way.  I used canned peaches in juice that I diced up.  This is a great recipe and you wouldn't know that it is low fat.

Yum! This was the first (and definitely not the last) time Ive made this cake, and it was great! Super-moist and sweet! Loved the brown sugar on the top - much better than icing. I threw in a banana because it was a little ripe.. a nice addition to a great cake. Thanks!

Great taste! My oven didn't require the whole 40 minute baking time, 30ish was ideal. Also I'm going to reduce the amount of baking soda next time as there was a bit of a soda taste. Very moist and satisfying - and low fat, too!! This recipe is going into my "Favourites" file.

Very good, especially for a cake that is essentially fat-free!  Does satisfy that sweet tooth without the guilt.  Tastes much better cold or room temperature than warm, though!

I had surprise company for dinner and made this as an easy and quick dessert. It was a hit. I had 3 pieces left over and the next day they reminded me of a "wet bottom pie". 5 stars in my book!

I make this all the time.  I do cut the sugar to 3/4 cup and only use 1/4 cup of brown sugar. That cuts down on the sweetness.  I also add pecans to top.

I thought this recipe was a little odd, since there was no oil and no applesauce.  I was concerned that it wouldn't rise, or that it would fall apart.  It did rise, but the batter was very sweet, as some of the other reviewers stated, so I cut back on the brown sugar sprinkled on top to about 1/4 cup.  This coffee cake reminds me of pineapple upside-down cake, but it needs a pinch of salt, and perhaps a bit of cinnamon to boost the flavor.

Not bad, but probably won't make it again. It really is a bit too sweet. I added a tsp allspice and a tsp cinnamon after reading others' reviews... can't imagine it would have been too tasty without the spices!

its a good recipe for basics, but I also cut down on the sugar and added some spice to it.  To give a hint of "fruit" flavour. add a few drops of almond extract to the batter.

This cake is awesome! The second time, I added spices - 1 T cinnamon, 1 t allspice. Yummy! Moist and if you have leftovers, doesn't dry out!

This is a "guy" cake.  It's one of my husband's favorites!  I, like many other reviewers, cut down on the sugar and used Splenda.  It's best when still warm with ice cream.  It's truly an old fashioned recipe -- my mom used to make it when she didn't have other cake ingredients on hand.

It's really not "incredible" or that unique tasting, but it is a very easy cake and tastes good for what it is.

I've never had a fruit cocktail cake before, but I tried this recipe because I had so many cans of it in my fridge going to waste.  My husband liked the cake, but it was just too gooey and sugary-sweet for my taste.  Is fruit cocktail cake always so...squishy?  I think my problem is that I have nothing to compare it to.  Personally, if I were to make it again, I'd cut the sugar down.

I love that this is easy, low fat and has fruit, I made it  whole grain and almost sugar free.  I used whole wheat flour, added 1 tsp cinnamon, dash of nutmeg and salt, just 1/2 cup Splenda and used about 1/16 cup brown sugar splenda mixed with oatmeal for the topping.  Next time I will add nuts to the top and add 1/4 cup oatmeal to the batter since the cake was really moist.  Thanks for posting and all the great ideas in comments.

My mom made this cake when I was young.  She always drained the fruit cocktail, and added 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the dry ingredients.  She also added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts to the brown sugar sprinkled on top.  It was wonderful served warm with whipped cream!

As others have noted, my Mom used to make this when I was a Kid.  I was cleaning out my pantry and found several cans of Fruit Cocktail. I added about half a cup of Walnuts and an extra Egg Yolk.  I used 2/3 cup of Sugar. Before I added the Brown Sugar on top I added 2 Tablespoons of Ground Flax Seed on top of the Batter.  (I almost always add Flax Seed to Baked Desserts for a Healthy Kick) LOL......Tasty, tasty, tasty!  Next time I will top with coconut.  Aloha!

This recipe was okay.  It was quick to make and I had all the ingredients.  40 minutes seems like a long time to cook.  Mine was done all the way through in 25 minutes.

This cake smells divine coming out of the oven. The overall taste is bland...maybe adding some nutmeg to the mix would help with that. But, for the most part it isn't too bad.

I did not care for this. There was no flavor. I'm sorry. It was a waste of ingredients. I agree with some of the other reviewers that suggested it would be good with just one type of fruit.

This was good.  I used the lite fruit cocktail (with juice instead of syrup) and I still thought it was too sweet.  Also, I think it would work much better with plain peaches or pineapple.  It is almost a cobbler.  I would make this in the winter when fresh fruit isn't readily available by all means.

My mother passed a double recipe on to me for a 9x13 pan.  I used a 10"square and the middle took forever to get solid.  I have never been disappointed with this very easy cake.  It is very moist and looks like chocolate but isn't.  Delicious!

I did use less sugar as one reviewer said.  Used 2/3 c of sugar. Also added cinnamon, cloves, spices and chopped walnuts.  Also cooked only for 30 minutes.  Did not like the texture, was way too doughy.  Flavor was ok but could use more taste, don't believe I'll make anymore.

Very  quick and easy. I used half the sugar (white and brown) ànd it turned out well.  Juice from fruitcocktail is required. A 4 for easiness and taste.  Serve hot with whipping or ice cream

So easy and as another baker suggested, I did add a little pumpkin spice to it.  Also made a quick cream cheese glaze.  Pretty tasty and you are getting your fruit!

Way too much liquid for this recipe. Wouldn't even cook, just made slop . Looked up other recipes and the amount of undrained Fruit coctail called for in this recipe is used with double the amount of every other ingredient in this recipe. Last Allrecipes recipe I'll ever make.

My kids LOVE this cake!!! The only difference I did was mixing in the brown sugar, only because I didn't read the directions fully and just threw everything in the bowl, now I mix half the brown sugar in and put half on top...I also added a little less white sugar as others have stated in their reviews. I double the recipe to make in a 9X13 pan :)

My mother always made this cake with fruit cocktail - I prefer pineapple chunks or canned crushed pineapple (with juice).  Then I add chopped nuts (I love walnuts) and maybe some cinnamon.  For the topping I use brown sugar, nuts and cinnamon.  Top a nice warm cake with either cool whip, ice cream or Byrds Custard hot (its a vanilla sauce).  (By the way - Byrd's custard on hot apple pie is to die for.)

Nice quick and easy. I shifted my flour and soda with a fork. Blended juice then folded in a beaten egg and fruit. Cinnamom was a must. Baked for 45 minutes. A masterpiece. My village children loved it on a rainy day. The con: Too moisted (more puddy like than cake).Can't see eating leftovers. LOL If any left. Great recipe for a special occassion.

I tried this recipe and it turned out too sweet.  I should have realized undrained fruit cocktail would have made the cake too sweet.  For others, who are about to make this cake, cut white sugar to 3/4 cup and skip the brown sugar part.

I thought it was okay but a weird texture. My hunny can't seem to stay out of it though. I will make again as stated just because he enjoyed it so much but I won't be partaking in it. Also cook times seemed off by a bit, mine needed maybe five extra minutes

This was my grama's favorite, used to make it for her when I was 8 years old. Now I make it for my grandkids! We always used chopped walnuts on top with the brown sugar. This is hard to keep because nibblers can't leave it alone!

This recipe was okay.  It was quick to make and I had all the ingredients.  40 minutes seems like a long time to cook.  Mine was done all the way through in 25 minutes.

Way too sweet for our taste. It's easy, but I can't get past how sweet it is.

This recipe gets points for being quick and easy, but the finished product was just okay.  Other than the extreme sweetness, there just wasn't that much flavor.  Cool-Whip helped, but it was still pretty bland.  We did like the way the brown sugar made the top crunchy, though.
