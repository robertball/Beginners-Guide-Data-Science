Absolutely delicious. My husband's grandmother used to make this icing over chocolate cupcakes when he was a very young child. She used vanilla instead of maple extract. Then she topped them with a chocolate rosebud. I surprised him by making the same cake recipe, and icing them with this icing.  When he saw the cupcakes he had tears in his eyes and gave me a huge hug. Then he devoured lots of them in a short sitting and for days after! :) I found it was easier to just dip the cupcakes in the icing as opposed to spreading it on- it gave the cupcakes a smooth look. This tastes silky and soft and like caramel. It's just so delicious I see why it was a favorite of my hubby's family. Highly recommended over chocolate cake- the flavors were meant for each other!

this is amazing! It was just what I was looking for. I replaced the maple extract with baileys(3tbls). It was so good

Worked like a charm. I replaced the vanilla with cola flavoring to use on top of a cola cake. Excellent texture.

I used this icing for the orange drop cookies II on this site because I didn't have any icing sugar on hand...I substituted 2 tsp orange juice concentrate for the maple extract...And all that I can say is "WOW"! Very unique, reminds me of a meringue/icing mixture...Loved it! Thanks

Very good taste!  I had to cook it 9 minutes before it would peak, but it is a great frosting!

Excellent flavour.  I used vanilla extract instead of maple.  Really nice on yellow cupcakes.
