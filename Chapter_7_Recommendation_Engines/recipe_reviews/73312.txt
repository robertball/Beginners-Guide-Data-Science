I've been making a version of this for years with a couple minor changes:I also add a bit of garlic powder to the marinade.And the TIME for marinating given here is in my opinion way too short.Marinating ANYTHING for only 10 minutes isn't going to impart much flavor or tenderize meat at all.The chicken should be marinated for at least 3 hours preferably longer like 5 or 6.Other than that this is a great recipe.

The black bean salsa was wonderful! I didn't use either green pepper or black eyed peas and substituted oil and vinegar salt and pepper for the Italian salad dressing (because I didn't have any of these and sweet vidalia onion instead of red onion and it was definitely a keeper! The chicken took longer than the recipe said but I had huge chicken breasts so of course it would take longer to grill. I also marinated it longer than the 10 minutes it stated about 4 hours it needed that to get the flavor imparted to the meat. Yum!

Fabulous! The salsa seemed like lots until we all dished up! It was devoured by 3 teenage boys my husband and me. You could double (or more) the lettuce...I chopped it up first so it was easier to eat. The marinade is enough for more chicken than listed. I sliced the chicken breasts in half to shorten the grilling time. Wish I'd marinated and cooked more for leftovers. Followed recipe for the most part (mixed spices with lime juice...didn't have tequila (or any other alcohol) but added a tequila lime dry marinade from Cabelas that I had in the cupboard to the lime juice and spices and only marinaded for about 20 minutes since the chicken was so thin) Also I didn't have Italian dressing so I just sprinkled in about 1 tsp. Italian seasoning and 1-2 TBSP each of vinegar and oil in the salsa (you could use more if you like Italian dressing). I made the salsa about 1/2 hour before dinner and it worked great. I don't know that waiting 6 hours is necessary. I did stir it every few minutes while it sat in the fridge. Will definitely make this again!

The marinated chicken was amazingly good but I used apple juice instead of tequila and I didn't use the cilantro just because I didn't have any. My family and I were not too taken with the salsa but would definitely use the marinated chicken recipe again.

Fabulous! I made this on my stove-top grill pan. First I pan-grilled the chicken then I added the vegetables on the other half of the pan after 10 minutes and heated the dish. It was great! You can eat this with Mexican Rice or in a wrap! Fantastic!- I did leave out the tequilla as I was serving this dish to young kids - Still came out great!

I substituted red wine vinegarette for the dressing and I always pound chicken fairly thin (or at least evenly thing) and then marinate at least overnight for maximum flavor.

Great marinade! To save time we used a premade salsa from our local grocery store and mixed in the beans and black eyed peas. It was excellent!
