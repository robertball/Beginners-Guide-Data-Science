Brilliant recipe.

I mixed mine in my Magimix - and then baked it in my Airfryer for 18 minutes at 190° - it was light and airy with a lovely crust and honestly was the closest to “normal” bread that I’ve tasted.

Not so great IMO.  I even added a teaspoon or so of both sugar and salt since I knew it would be a complete & total bust without it.  It dried out within a day or so even though the loaves were wrapped in cellophane as soon as they cooled.  I plan to cut up this bread into tiny cubes to use in my spinach balls so at least there will be no waste.  I wouldn't made it again unless it was for a gluten-free stuffing since I would be adding butter, onion, celery and spices.

I couldn't believe there was no salt in this bread, so I added a half tsp. salt, plus a tsp. of sugar. Loaf was very pale on top. I turned on broiler for a couple of minutes to make it more attractive. I am going to keep playing with this a bit, but as written, it needs some help. I chose it because it was easy to make and seemed to have a nice crumb. My loaf didn't have as nice a crumb as her picture showed, but actually the taste was pretty good. Just be sure to add a half tsp. salt and a tsp. of sugar to the dough.

This bread was super easy to make. Mine did not brown as nicely as pictured, baked it an extra 15 minutes, still came out fairly pale. Happy with the consistency, but lacked flavor. I'm not much of a baker, but I would think it needs some sugar or salt in the recipe

It is less sugar. I guess to eat.
