I was so hungry for deeply flavored Chocolate Cookies (without Chocolate Chips or icing) and I had a hard time finding this recipe. These are not just for Christmas, but anytime!    They are delicious - but I  cut the icing to 1/4 of what they said and drizzled it over them - plenty!  Very orangy, but I love a chocolate orange flavor.   I think you could substitute cherry and make them chocolate cherry flavored, too.
