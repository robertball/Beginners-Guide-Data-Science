I think this is an excellent recipe! I only gave it four stars because I altered it some. I thought for sure that I had a block of cream cheese, but alas! I did not. So, I mixed in a 6 oz. package of grated parmesan cheese, which I did have on hand. It is SO good! :) I'm sure it would be excellent with the cream cheese too. :) Also I used leftover corned beef that I had cooked in the crock pot last week for St. Patrick's Day. - Instead of the packaged deli stuff (it was a whole lot cheaper my way too! ;-)  )

Used my leftovers from previous nights Crock-Pot corned beef dinner, and used this recipe as a guide. Made a huge pot of it, and literally not a single spoonful was left. So good! ( If it's too thick just add extra broth). Added corn, which brightened it up.

I'll give it 4 stars since I haven't made it yet, but it sounds like 5 to me!  Have the corned beef and cabbage, so can't wait to try it tonight!

I followed the recipe with the addition of baby carrots and baby red potatoes. I omitted the dill seed as I did not have any. I grated some swiss cheese to top it off.

Perfect as is. I chose to substitute heavy cream for half and half and only used 8oz for a slightly thicker and creamier chowder. Even my picky eater enjoyed this.

Made for the first time just as recipe stated. Sorry added extra onions and garlic. We took it to church gathering hoping to bring some home, did not happen. It is truly amazing and as my children say "It's a keeper"

I will start off by saying I adjusted the recipe.  I needed to use my left over corned beef and roasted cabbage.  Since they were already cooked I added them at the end to warm up.  I also added the tarragon at the end, as I believe fresh herbs should be an addition at the end.  I did not add dill seeds, as I did not have any.  Also, I made the soup with the broth and the half & half and adjusted salt and pepper as needed.  I did not feel the need to add the cream cheese and corn starch slurry.  The soup was plenty creamy with the half & half.  The addition of the flour into the butter and onion mix truly adds enough body to the soup, in my opinion.  Overall, it was a great way to use leftover corned beef and cabbage.

REALLY good!  I had some leftover German cabbage. This soup was the perfect way to use it up. I agree with some reviewers that a rye crouton is in order here though. It is a VERY rich soup though and a little goes a long way.

This was a huge hit.  I stuck to the recipe with a couple minor additions.  Added diced potatoes and some cut carrots.  I also finished the soup with 2 T of cider vinegar and some jalapeno tabasco.  And more salt and peppper.  The soup was rich and wonderful.  Fantastic with sourdough!  Will definitely be my go-to recipe for leftover corned beef, every year.

This is pretty good.  It's kind of bland though.  I had to add salt and a little bit of dill pickle juice.  I'll make it again, but it's not my favorite.  I also added a can of hominy to give it a little more bulk.

My family loved it!  I added an extra cup of broth from cooking the corned beef, added extra flavor and not so thick.

Best Ever for Left-over Corned Beef and Cabbage
   I made this last year for a church Soup Supper with left overs from the St. Patrick Day feast of corned beef, cabbage, carrots and potatoes.   It was an instant hit.  There wasn't any left when I got to the pot.  This year, I bought extra Corned Beef  to make sure I had enough to make some for the family.  I am really looking forward to it.  This is a very easy recipe to modify with your left over ingredients.  So, skip the expensive deli meat, cook up some corned beef and the fixins and enjoy!

I followed the directions then added about 1/3 cup of leftover mashed potatoes, 3/4 cup leftover corn and 1/2 small leftover baked potato cut up.  I also made some croutons out of some pumpernickel bread.  I also added about 1/4 cup grated parmesan just for the heck of it.  It was a winner!  Very creamy and flavorful.
