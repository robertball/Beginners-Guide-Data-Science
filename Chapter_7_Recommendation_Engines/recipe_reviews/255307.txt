Excellent bread, came out beautifully. I used a tablespoon of chia seed and two tablespoons of whole flax seed instead of the sunflower seeds. Will definitely make this again.

Quick & easy vegan bread recipe that's absolutely delicious. I substituted roasted pepitas (baby pumpkin seeds) because I find they have more flavor than sunflower seeds so always have them on hand.  I doubled the chia seeds because they're so good for you, and sprinkled more on top for crunch.  The time & temperature was perfect. Wrapped in a towel still warm & cooled on a rack so it comes out moist. Perfection. Nutty, delicious & so quick and easy with no rising or fuss.

I've been looking for a healthy bread recipe that has a nutty texture that tastes great and fills me up.  This definitely ticks all of the boxes.   It's easy to modify with different kinds of nuts or seeds.  I will definitely be making this many times over.
