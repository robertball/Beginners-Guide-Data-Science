Delicious.  I made the recipe as written and found it a little too sweet so 2nd batch tonight I eliminated the grenadine and added a dash of lime juice. YUMMMMMY!  Great way to top off the night  :)

Yummy! I made this as my "featured cocktail" at my annual Christmas Eve shindig and it got rave reviews! I didn't have raspberry vodka so I used the regular kind and they still turned out delicious and pretty too! This will become a regular at our house!

I threw some raspberries into the shaker and garnished with a fortune cookie for a party. So good that we went with hair of the dog for breakfast following.

Yummy, I made these for an all girls party and everyone loved them. Since my friends and I like a lot of vodka in our martinis we made a slight adjustment after tasting the original recipe first; 3 oz of the vodka and only 1 oz of the orange-flavored liqueur.

I'm not a fan.  I thought it was much better without the orange liquor, and even then, good but not fabulous.

I made this and found it to be much too sweet for my taste. I eliminated the grenadine and cut the Cointreau to 1 oz and added an ounce to the vodka and it was *perfect*! EVERYONE just loves this and it has become my signature drink. I do use POM for the pomegranate juice and I think that makes a big difference.

Sweet and delicious! My roommate (who doesn't drink) even had one. We were afraid that it would be too alcohol-y, but it was perfect!

This drink is very sweet; too sweet for my tastes, but others might enjoy more.
