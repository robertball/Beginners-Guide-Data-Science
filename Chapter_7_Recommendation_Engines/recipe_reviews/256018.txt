I was surprised when I read the other reviews.  I made this for two different groups of coworkers, and it was a hit.  I kept it wrapped and refrigerated as suggested in the magazine, and the texture was fine.  I found it easy to cut and serve.

I, like the others here who rated it, made it just like the recipe.  It tastes really good but it is so sticky.  I tried every knife I had and finally got it to cut  kind of messy, with a scraper that goes with my food chopper.  The picture looks great.  Would love to know how you got it to cut like that!

I made this fudge exactly as directed.  I didn't care for the texture, which is soft and sticky, unlike the type of fudge I'm used to.  The flavor is ok, but I won't be making this again.

I really wanted to like this. I gave it two stars for ease of preparation and chocolate and peanut butter just go so well together. But the texture is not good. It was a big, sticky mess to try and cut, and it feels like a lump of  super sticky play dough in your mouth. I followed the recipe exactly. Disappointing. I will not be making this again.
