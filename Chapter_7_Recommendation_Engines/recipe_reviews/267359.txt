Notice the first word of the title of this recipe is Tangy. Don’t expect an overly sweet smoothy. This is perfect for those people like me who are cutting way down on “sweet” and want a little more healthy protein in their diet.

Pretty good but you have to watch the amount of yogurt or it will be too tart.

I absolutely loved this!  I did make the mistake of buying sweetened plain greek yogurt, so, I am sure it was sweeter than the recipe was supposed to be, but, it was still delicious! I loved the peanut butter flavor!

Made this for breakfast this morning. It was really good. Not overly sweet. I did misread the recipe though. I just glanced at the ingredients and thought it was 1/2 cup of the yogurt. Oops. But delicious. I will definitely make this again.

To me, the predominate flavors are the yogurt and peanut butter. When reading this recipe, I thought it called for too much yogurt. I started with just 1/2 cup, and it was the perfect amount. Any more would have overflowed my single cup Ninja blender and would have made it too tangy for me. (Plus, the calorie count for one serving is over 600, so reducing the yogurt brings the calories down.) This tasted healthy and was filling. Thanks for the recipe.

Both my husband and I really enjoyed this! Perfect combo of peanut butter and chocolate, and the fact that it takes like, 2 minutes to make, made it a definite winner in our house! I did use a frozen banana in place of the ice cubes, just for personal preference. Thanks so much for the recipe!

I made this for my son, i'm  trying to get him to gain weight and I thought this would be perfect. While the flavor was good we had consistency issues. It just wasn't thick like a "normal" smoothie. If I were to make it again, i'd probably try adding more ice to see if that helps.
