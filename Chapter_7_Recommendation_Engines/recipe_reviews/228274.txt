This was very quick and easy, but tasted like I know what I'm doing. I didn't have sliced almonds handy, so I put some fresh rosemary into the wine while it was reducing, then put some on top of the fish the last few minutes of cooking. Even my teenage son, who hates fish, thought it was good.

The only change I made was to squeeze lemon over the fish in the pan near the end of the cooking. I also served it with a lemon wedge on each plate for individual taste. Make sure to watch the pan carefully after the heat is turned to high. I'm wondering of medium high would be a better temp for fillets tsagty are a bit thick.

This ended up being very greasy. Flavors are not crisp. It ended up being a very heavy meal, with just a side of rice.

I made this for my partner for Valentine's Day and he enjoyed it. It is a simple garlic wine sauce so using a good quality Riesling and very fresh snapper are key. A wonderful simple yet elegant dish. Thanks for sharing!

Awesome.  This was easy and fast. It came out great.  Tried to add a photo but wouldn't upload.  Added mashed red potatoes along with a honey and ginger salad. All ingredients found in publix.

I followed the recipe exact, but Added shallots, garlic, parsley.  The sauce was wonderful and my guests I loved it. This is a keeper and will make it again.

I didn't like the recipe or outcome at all.  I followed the directions but the butter burned badly on the first batch-my fault. There was so much butter it seemed gross to fry the fish in all that grease.  On my Try #2 I reduced the butter and followed the directions.  The pan sauce still burns badly as it's mostly butter while you are cooking the fish. \  It was a good reisling but the flavor of this dish was not good!

This was very bland. The fish was cooked perfectly and moist, but it really needs citrus added.

I was very tempted to tweak this recipe - it just seemed too simple, with so few ingredients. I am SO glad that I didn't however. It was excellent!  The blending of flavors was amazing and took me by surprise. We really enjoyed it and I will definitely be making it again.
