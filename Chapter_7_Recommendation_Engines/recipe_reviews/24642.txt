I have never taken it to a pot luck and come home with leftovers. You don't use the whole jar of jalapenos, you only use the amount to get the flavor you want. When reading the recipe, it tells you to add the DESIRED amount of jalapenos, not the whole jar!

It is also called Hamburger dip for those of you unable to get past the name.

Yummy receipe even if the name is intimidating to your guests.  Followed the receipe exactly and it came out just great!  I used the Tostitos Scoops for maximum dip extraction.

This is a very yummy dip, but my kids wouldn't touch it. No problem as hubby and I ate it all. Next time I made it, right before serving I added a thin layer of shredded cheddar cheese and sliced green onions on top so that you had to dip through that. It looked much more appetizing. Make sure that you buy the sturdy tortilla chips for this. Thank you.

This was great! I plan on making this as a dip at my pot-luck junk-food birthday party later this month. I made myself a test batch of it with things I had on hand after seeing this recipe, and the only thing I was missing was the green chili's. Next time I think I will make sure to add those - everything benefits from a little spice!

My family eats this on sandwich buns. I use cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom. We call them Chicken Joes instead of Sloppy joes. They are always a big hit.

YIKES!! What a name! However, it was soo easy I decided to try it.  I made it this morning and didn't reheat to serve until dinner time.  Yes, it was good but a little bland. Try adding some S&P while browning the meat. However, I think I'll stick with my own tried and true "danger" dip (meat, salsa & cheese).  Thanks for the laugh Cindy!

I amped this recipe up a bit... I omitted the peppers, and poured in a can of "Mexican Rotel." That made it look a little more appealing (the reds and greens). I also added a half pound more of Velveeta cheese and sea salt and ground coarse black pepper. It wasn't spicy... but VERY WARM. After I bround the meat and sauteed the onion, I poured that into my crockpot and added the rest. SO GOOD (even after just 10 minutes)!!! I definitely recommend this recipe! :)

It really does look like Alpo gone bad, but it smells and tastes fantastic. It's easy to make and it satisfies most people's tastes.

This was rather bland so I added one can of Mild Ro-Tel tomatoes and it made it 5 stars!  I took it to a April Fools potluck and it was a hit.  For something so simple and UGLY, it tasted very good served over Scoop Fritos.  Thanks for posting Cindy!

I adjusted the ingredients by omitting the jalapenos, adding one 4 oz can green chiles, 8 oz cream cheese, 1 can water, garlic powder, and 1/4 cup salsa. My brother wished for the jalapenos, but the rest of my family has gringo mouth, so they were happy. Great flavor; I love the versatility--it will become my standard cheese dip. Cindy, I think this dish needs a new name; you could call it "Good Dip" because that's what everyone says when they eat it!

It was a really good dip.  It makes a TON though. I had a small party of about 10 people and there was so much left over. I am wondering though..how it got its name??? (smile)

Very tasty.  The men loved it!  Not too sure about what to dip in it though.  Used "scoops" but it was only okay with the tortilla chips.  Maybe a good pita chip.

We liked this very much but added the Rotel like others did. I also don't use ground beef anymore so I substituted the ground turkey which was very delicious. Personally, though, I would rename it something more appetising than to refer to it as dog food. I think that leaves a mental image that some folks might not get past...you know, the power of suggestion! Thanks for sharing.

Who can wait a whole day for the flavors to meld?  We can't.  I started this 2 hours ago, and we're already chowing down.   I used a 7-oz. can of mild green chilis and 1 T. of chili powder in place of the jalapenos.  Happened to have an uncooked boneless pork chop and a boneless chicken breast to use up, so I diced them and added to the ground beef, onion, and (of course) a T. of "jar" garlic.  After browning, place all ingredients in the slow cooker.   I also added part of a brick of cream cheese (again, cleaning out the fridge).  Wow, the chunks of meat turned out to be a great addition to this dip.  I generally don't mind store brands, but in this case, I highly recommend the Velveeta brand cheese, not a knock-off.  My husband is barking for more.

This is EXCELLENT! I have made this many different ways, but my favorite way is with a tube of Jimmy Dean's spicy sausage instead of ground beef. It is very hearty and it is usually one of the first appetizers polished off in my home!

I forgot to make this and refridgerate the night before my son's birthday party. So I threw caution to the wind and made it anyway with about 1 hour to chill and threw it in the microwave for the party. Even tossing it together at the last minute and nuking it, it was still a huge hit. Everyone who tried it asked for the recipe and kept going back for more. I was pretty impressed. Tastes a lot like the Cheeseburger Con Queso at Red Robin. Which is gooood! Only thing I did differently (well, aside from previously mentioned) was increase the cheese and season the beef with some seasoning salt, garlic powder and pepper. I'll definitely be making this again!

Not a bad dip recipe but I'm not a fan of processed cheese and cream of mushroom soup.  I make a variation of this dip with cream cheese and salsa in place of the processed cheese and jalapenos. I leave out the soup and also add a little ground pork  sausage to  the beef.

I didn't change a thing in this recipe but have to tell you, I am serving this at a potluck at work and it will be presented in a brand new, never used dog food bowl.  Thank you for a great recipe.

UNBELIEVABLE recipe. I have known about this recipe for years, we call it Alpo dip, but I bet they won't let you call it by that name on the site, because it is a trademark name. This is the best, be sure to add the jalapenos to your taste, the flavor gets stronger over nite, which is why you make it the nite before, so the flavors 'marry'. We love this, it is addicting, so be warned! Kim

Woof!  Woof! and YUM - YUM!  This dish is a real crowd pleaser - I mean everyone loves it!  The name gets them to try it and the taste keeps them eating till it's gone!  My husband did ask me to cut the jalapenos in half - so reluctantly, I do!  :-) You must try this at least once - I promise - you'll prepare it every time.

Made this when I had some friends over and they loved it!  (I was calling it "Alpo")  I halved it because we didn't need as much as the recipe called for - it was a small group.  I would make it again.

DEFINITELY make the night before, and start with less than the listed amount of jalapenos. I used 1/2 the jalapenos the first time I made this, and what tasted fairly lifeless the night before was almost too hot when it was time to serve and I had to add more cheese to make it safe for Wisconsin mouths. I have now made this several times and it is a favorite appetizer when I entertain. I use 1 lb. of beef to each lb. of cheese, and start with 1/4 of the jalapenos, sometimes stirring in more just before serving it. This recipe does NOT serve 48, though. More like 25-30, depending on your crowd.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and everyone thought the name was hilarious.  They were hesitant to try at first but once they did, they couldn't stay away. After reading the reviews I had higher expectaions, but overall was very pleased with the result.

This went over very well.  I made a few little changes.  I used Mexican Velveeta, and added a small can of diced green chilies. I let it set over night and when reheating it I added some salsa to loosen it up.

Very easy to make and a great party dip. The processed cheese didn't make it taste as good as I think it could have. I used Mexican Velveta. Maybe I'll try a different kind of cheese next time.

Oh....my....god! If I could give this more than five stars, I would! I'm doing everything in my power to stay away from the fridge right now before I devour it all! And yes, it really does look like dog food ha ha. The only changes I made are that I used about 4 oz of jalapenos, and 1 8 oz. block of sharp cheddar cheese mixed with a cup of shredded Chipotle cheddar. Thanks Cindy, I know I'll be making this quite often!

Made this for a recent large family gathering - everyone just huddled around the crock pot eating this!  It definitely needs the overnight treatment as indicated in the recipe to develop the flavors - it didn't taste like much except ground beef immediately upon making it, but was delicious the next day when reheated.  More jalapenos can be added at that time if you want to add more heat.  Thanks for a keeper!

I made this last year for my work Christmas party. I am still getting asked to make it again or for the recipe, almost a year later. The recipe calls for 1 pound of cheese, I could only find 2 pound blocks and used the whole thing. I think half of it would not of been enough. I also added a few cloves of garlic to the burger when I cooked it. I added the whole jar of jalapeno, and even though it was pretty spicy it was great, even the ones who didn't care for spicy foods loved it. I did not have time to do it in a crock pot. I just reheated it on the stove before I went to the party and transferred to the crock pot to take it there. I added milk a little at a time until it was the consistency I wanted.

this was very good, very versatile.  I used cream of onion soup instead and liked it very much.  The taste reminded me of a specialty burger McDonald's used to have back in the 80's that was served on a rye bun.  I only used 1 lb. of beef.  Was a tad bland, so did add some garlic powder, and a bit of tomatillo for a bit of zip.  If I had a can of chopped chilis, would have added.

A friend pulled this recipe of this website back in 2005 or 2006 and gave me a copy. I didn't make it until last November, when I took it in a crockpot (along with Frito Scoops) to a Dave Ramsey Seminar at my local Seventh-Day Adventist church. After the seminar, when everyone was going through the refreshment line, I noticed that only a few people were touching the dip. I forgot that Seventh-Day Adventists are vegetarians! Needless to say, I was very embarrassed. But those that tasted the dip raved about it. I had plenty of leftovers the next day, so I used the dip for enchiladas. Be sure to use Frito Scoops or another sturdy chip because others will break. I also suggest thinning out the dip with enchilada sauce, salsa, or beef broth if it is too thick for your taste. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This is indeed very popular at pot luck events but I too thought it was a bit bland so I added red pepper flakes. I would perhaps add a packet of taco seasoning next time. Also, Worchestershire sauce and mustard (powder or Dijon) add bite.

I did some minor adjustments on this recipe and it was equally awesome. Instead of ground beef try a tube of Jimmy Dean Sausage (cooked of course, depending on how spicy you want it use hot sausage) 2 cans of cream of chicken soup, a whole big block of Velvetta Cheese and a medium size jar of (also depending on how spicy hot, med or mild) Pace Picante sauce. I used regular sausage and Medium Picante sause, it was just enough spice. Just put it in a crock pot and let it melt. Tortilla chips complete it. Never any leftovers...Yum

This was really good.  Made it for a party as part of a "nacho bar," where I set out the dip in a crock pot, along with tortilla chips, salsa, guacamole, sour cream, olives, limes, etc.  It was a total hit!  I did make some minor adjustments - while cooking the meat, I added salt, pepper, garlic, and some yoshida's sauce.  Also, I used all the same measurements in the recipe, except for the cheese - I used 2 lbs. (instead of one).  This made the dip "cheesier" and less thick, which worked for the nacho bar.    Can't wait to make this again!

I put this out first for unsuspecting guests to set off my April Fool's dinner.  Everyone just stared at it! (It might have been the dog bowl that made them hesitate) Once they braved the first bite, it was gone almost instantly.  I made it the night before and tasted it then, but I thought the cheese was way too strong.  The next day it had mellowed/blended and was MUCH better!  I seasoned the meat with garlic salt, worcestershire, & pepper while it was browning with the onions.  I also threw in a can of chopped olives.  After 1/2 of it was gone, I put a big dollop of sour cream on top and guests were happy to be able to cut the heat.  (only used 1/2 a can of jap peppers)  Put sour cream on top if you want it to look better too.  Thanks for the recipe, it was perfect!

I thought this was a really great recipe. Very filling and not too spicy. Make sure to add all of the jalapenos!

This recipe inspired me. I used turkey burger, jack pepper cheese & a three pepper combo instead of velveeta and jalapenos. Made it for Halloween:)
Served with Blue Corn Tortilla chips and Tomato Basil potato chips (kind a purple and orange combo. My husband just wanted to eat the dip.

Excellent and easy recipe.  I made this for a Halloween party, and everyone enjoyed it.  I used about 2 tablespoons of finely chopped jalapenos and served with Fritos Scoops as suggested.  And yes, it really does look like dog food--how fun!

My son begs me to make dog food dip. Then I made the mistake of bringing it to my classroom for a class party (high school kids). Now they are always asking me, "Miss H., when are you going to bring dog food dip?" So I bring it and they all love it.

My Kids love when we have a "party night"

For us that means a Fun Friday night  appetizers, & desserts dor Dinner.  It also means game night with dad, mom & the kids!  This dip is so highly requested, that I know just make it in bulk and divide into four and put the three we will not be eating into Zip Lock Gallon Freezer bags, for another party night.  It is so nice to heat it up and just grab the tortilla chips!

Easy recipe. I didn't make it overnight before the party, and not many people ate it. But the next day, everyone couldn't get enough of it!

My husband and I did not like this recipe.  This is a very rich dip.  We prefer the classic - 1 can of rotel tomatoes, 1 lb of drained/browned/ ground sausage, and one box of Velveeta put in crock pot and eaten w/ tortilla chips.

I've made this a couple of times, and have passed the recipe on to family and friends, all to rave reviews!  I agree that you should cut the jalapeno back, or you can even leave it out - tastes great either way!

Made this and took to a party last night. It was the first time I had made it, but with such great reviews I did it without trying it at home first(which is what I usually do). Anyway, I doubled the recipe. There was about 60 people there and lots of other things to eat and I came home with no left overs. I served it with Tortilla chips, and fritos corn chips. they were both good, but I preferred the corn chips. thanks for a new party staple.

I made this for a family gathering. I used much less of the peppers than what was called for because not everyone in the family likes peppers.
I put the dip out as an appetizer...everyone was huddled around the crock pot until it was empty! It was such a hit, they ask for it whenever they are coming to my house now.

We like spice, but even this was a bit much. I didn't even use the recommended amount of jalapeno peppers. This was too hot with really no flavor. And yes, it looks like dog food.

Big hit with the crowd for Chinese New Year. I had to print the recipe three times for my friends.  I did use a whole loaf of "processed cheese food" because I really like cheesy stuff.

This tasted like meat and jalapeno --and looked terriby unappealing. No one had more than one serving. Save your time and money. There are far better dip recipes out there.

I have made this one several times for home and work potlucks.  It not a pretty dish but the name gets 'em to try it once and the taste keeps 'em coming back for more!  I love it!  I do add some garlic to the ground beef when browning it.  It really does need to sit overnight in the refrigerator overnight for the flavors to marry.  Good stuff!!  Addictive!

This is so popular with my family and friends, that people always ask if I am making it. I also found it a little bland so I added some taco seasoning......Really bump it up a little. I also make it with ground Turkey and light Velveta, no one knows the difference!!!! great recipe!

I finished making this dip a little while ago, my BF likes it a lot.  I think it's pretty good too.  I'll see how it holds up tomorrow when a couple of his pals come over for NCAA Football.  Overall, simple recipe with good flavor.  I did add some smoked Gouda and two garlic cloves but that was a personal preference.   I just personally can't take straight velveeta, I usually have to cut it down with another kind of cheese or I find the taste to be really overwhelming.  I will update my review after tomorrow.  ??

This dip was good but too spicy hot for my liking. Next time I won't put near as many jalepeno peppers in it and possibly add a variety of cheeses.

I make something very similar to this, it has ground sausage as well as beef and chili peppers instead of jalapeno, but I think I will try adding jalapenos to it next time. As for "interesting names" I think my families recipe has this one beat, cause ours is called "Dirty Diaper Dip" :)

As written 4 stars, after using seasoned salt, garlic powder and pepper on meat,  5 stars.  Very good as a sandwich filling too.

I have been making this dip for years and it's a hit every time! When I make this dip for my brothers, I use chorizo to give it extra heat. Be cautious...it can get pretty hot depending on the spice of the chorizo! I have also made this dip with ground turkey when that is all I had on hand and it went unnoticed.

Very simple recipe to make. Made exactly as recipe written. I wouldn't skip the 8 hour period in the frig. It gives all the flavors time to come together. Had a warm bite to it, combined with very good flavor. Glad I tried this recipe!!

I served this at my fall open house, and several people just stood by the dish and ate it - without chips!  Now, a young girl who recently immigrated from Africa is wanting to make it for her brother who is coming to visit from England!

When I tell my friends the 'real' name of this recipe, ALPO dip, they say NO WAY! It's just hamburger and cheese, but it is so good! Never had it turned down for it's name, they embrace it, after tasting it the first time, it's history. I've always had it devoured!!!

I added bell pepper and mushrooms.  My guests loved it.  I used a bit more ground beef since that's what I had in a package.  I was able to freeze half for later use. would make again.

This is a really yummy dip despite how gross it looks. I served it in one of my dog's extra bowls and it did truly look like dog food.

Really good dip! My only mistake was not listening to previous reviews. I served it with regular tortilla chips. The chips could not handle the thickness of the dip and kept breaking. I will try the fritos scoops for the next time.

I was scared to try this recipe, because I didn't know if my co-workers were going to get past the looks of it. I cut it in half, because we have a small department. Big mistake. I should have made the whole recipe. Everybody loved it. It's a great recipe.

I read a lot of the reviews before I made this and I have to say, I would absolutely NEVER make it again. In fact, my husband and I ate a little but not the rest.  It tastes okay but not good enough, imo, to overcome it's appearance.  I was going to take it to a party but ended up doing something else instead. I loved the one persons idea that served it in a dog bowl for scoobie doo party.  So, I guess if I had to have a kids birthday party and theme was scoobie doo, I would make it again.

OMG!!! This was absolutely the best appetizer i've made/had in a long time. I made this for my Christmas party, using Veggie Ground Round, and it was the first thing gone. My guests didn't even know they weren't eating veggie meat, they thought it was the real deal. Nice kick to it. Made a small portion one night for dinner (couldn't help it, it's that good), and while still absolutely delicious, i would def recommend making it the night before for the flavours to mix. Makes me salivate thinking about this recipe ;)

The recipe itself tastes pretty good, however, I couldn't get past the way it looks.  It looks very unappetizing and was not tried by many.

I brought this to our Halloween potluck at my work. It was a great hit. There was some leftover though. Prior to my potluck I tried it at home for game night and it was another hit. A little too spicy for some. Was great in omelets the next morning & as a topping on home-made nachos.

This is a great recipe. I was serving up a Mexican dinner and wanted a new dip recipe that I could throw in the crockpot.  I wasn't sure the can of mushroom soup would work out, but it was totally delicious!!! I followed the recipe and it only served 5 of us because it was so good.  Next time I think I will add some sauteed onions and green chilies just to give it a Mexican flair.  This is a keeper recipe.  I made it last weekend and I think I could make it weekly.  You do need to let it sit overnight-flavors just blend perfectly.  Love it!!!!!!!!!!

This is my first reveiw EVER!  This recipe was a HIT at my BBQ.  Everyone kept refering to how much they loved my "mystery dip".  It was the talk of the party.  My boyfriend and I despise mushrooms.  However, you seriously cannot taste them in this recipe.  Sounds like such a simple combo, but the flavor is unbelievable.  I made this with 3 pounds of ground beef, 1 1/2 lbs of velveeta and 2 cans of mushroom soup, and a 12 oz. can of sliced jalepenos (DRAINED).  DELICIOUS!!!!  I was hoping the filets I bought would be the talk of the party..but nope it was this dip.

My husband and brother in law went crazy over this. I had to add some garlic powder for more flavor. Added some tomato juice to left overs since it got too thick. A keeper.

This was a hit at my party!  I'm not sure it really needed to sit overnight.  It tasted the same it did to me, but my friends ate it up!  I used about 2/3 of a 7oz can of jalepenos, and it had just enough kick.  I'll make this again for my next party!

I admit, I was intrigued by the novelty of the name. What an extremely easy recipe!  I did reduce the jalapeno by at least half and all the "eaters" agreed that any more peppers would have drowned out the other flavors and just been painful.  I served it with Frito Lay Scoops and the crockpot came home empty.  Can't ask for more than that!

This is a very good dish. Wife invites friends over and she does not cook. It's left up to me. Anyway try this dish don't think anybody will be dissapointed. The jaiapenos give this a nice wang! Served over fritos scoops. Just like the rest say, WON'T BE ANY LEFTOVERS.

This recipe is one of the best I've had in a long time. I love the spicy(ness?). I first tried it for a potluck at work during the holiday's (06) and it disappeared within a 1/2 hour. I've taken it to other functions since then and if I don't take some out for myself when I get there I don't get any.

I added a can of Rotel for color and it kicked up the flavor a bit.  The barn didn’t matter, everyone in the office loved it.  No leftovers

It really doesn't have much appeal visually.  However, for flavor it was ok.  Without the *pickled* jalapenos, it would be a dud.  I think that sausage would increase the flavor very well.  I'd like to make it again and go with more cheese, it was very gray in color, and I would try with adding some Worcestershire sauce.  Even some diced peppers might be a nice addition.

Didn't use cream of mushroom soup. Made this for two, and used the 8 oz. package of processed cheese, added green pepper, red & white onions & diced tomatoes. Only used 3/4 lb of hamburger.still made a lot. I was scared of how fast the cheese was starting to develop a filmy layer yet didn't want to dilute taste by adding water. So I threw this in my crock pot on low for an hour. then switched to keep warm. Let it sit all night. Was even better the next day. Here we are on day 3 and this is absolutely delish! so easy & colorful. I like the name. We dumped this over tortilla chips & ate with forks. Add sour cream & beans, and this could easily become taco night!

I used banana peppers to make it less spicy and used it as part of a Nacho platter.

A great tasting dip. I've found people are often unsure because it does indeed look like dog food, but after one bite they can't stay away!

I wanted to make this for our factory's potluck. Luckily I made it ahead of time as I usually do for potlucks- to test them out.  The food is great- don't get me wrong- but it seriously looks like dog food!  I knew if I brought it no one would eat it.  Unless you can dress it up to look more appealing, people may be leary.  I took something else to the potluck.
