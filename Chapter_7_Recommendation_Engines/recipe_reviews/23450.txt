Really excellent - preparation time can be cut by cooking the beans ahead of time, plunging them into ice water, draining and wrapping in a clean cloth and refrigerating the day before.  Then continue with the recipe just before serving.  By the way I am no relation to the Terri Pringle who submitted the recipe even though we have the same last name!

Oh my, this recipe is my absolute favorite recipe for green beans EVER!  While the green beans are boiling, I saute the garlic and red onions in butter, then add the thyme.  I don't discard the garlic or let the garlic rest in the butter for 20 mins.  Then I take the green beans right from the pot to the skillet and toss them in the garlic/butter/red onion/thyme, add the red wine vinegar and the salt, pepper, and nutmeg to taste, and serve. I didn't have fresh parsley on hand so I omitted it. Heavenly!!

Keep to the cooking times exactly on this or you will risk soggy beans.  I tread the line very closely, but they turned out very tasty!

My husband and I love those little green beans anyway, but this recipe makes them taste wonderful.  We try to use the fresh herbs when we have them.  Thanks -- we have already made this twice in one week!

These went over very well, and were good--but I don't know if they justify the time spent making them.

Five star recipe that allows the taste of fresh green beans to shine.  Prepare green beans ahead as suggested by another cook for ease of preparation if you wish.  If you have fresh thyme add to taste for an even more delicious flavour.

This is really an wonderful recipe for green beans.  I like the simplicity of it--and
it doesn't cover up the fresh bean taste.  Try it!

I totally forgot to add the vinegar and nutmeg and Iâ€™m very glad I did.  Not sure we would have found either appealing, especially given the rather hefty amount of vinegar called for.  This was very good just with caramelizing the onions along with some fresh thyme and garlic.

This tasted pretty good, having used fresh green beans from the garden with fresh thyme instead of dried. I thought the vinegar overwhelmed the flavor a bit, so I might cut back a little bit next time. Also, I re-heated leftovers the next day, and it tasted even better.

My husband who is a green bean fan said these were the best beans he'd ever tasted.  The green beans have good flavor, bright color, and just the right crunch!

This wasn't that bad. I can't tell what it needs but the red wine vinegar didn't help it any. I think my family would rather eat green beans plain.

I don't know how to keep the beans crispy save for cooking them for less time that what's recommended here. Cut butter down to lower fat content. Used shallots instead of red onions because that's what I had; was a good substitute. Would make again.

Not bad, but I would have tried to cook the beans a little bit longer. It was probably just me as a novice fresh-green-bean-cooker but they were still a little hard. Otherwise it was good.

This has become a go-to recipe for my family.  Even my daughter, who does not like green beans, loves this.  FYI - Haircot Vert can be found at Costco.  It is always fresh and lasts much longer than standard fresh green beans.

We really liked these. Cook the green beans to your preferred doneness; I like mine a little more done than 5 minutes gets them, so..I just boil them longer. I also skipped the ice bath, and just drained them. I did not discard my garlic (but you have to be careful not to burn it if you don't discard it, because burnt garlic is super gross and also easy to do), nor did I let my butter wait for 20 minutes (because I don't see why, and I'm impatient). There are a lot of subtle, complex flavors to enjoy here, and we enjoyed them all. Thank you, Terri Pringle, for sharing your recipe which will certainly be a hit at our table for years to come!

I thought these were pretty good. The caramelized onion is the key to the flavor so don't skip that part. But I didn't let the garlic butter sit (nor did I discard the garlic) and it turned out fine, so that makes it a bit easier.

Loved this, it was very similar to a  Haricot dish I had whilst on holiday in France. I did make a couple of changes though, I didn't have red wine vinegar, so I used cider vinegar instead and I didn't throw out the garlic, I kept it in the dish, I just added it when the onion had finished sweating. This is one you should try, all of my family loved it, even my picky eaters, thank you for sharing it with us.

I served this recipe for company, and we were craving a little zest for our beans.  These had a very mild flavor -- too mild for my taste, but good nonetheless.  My guests put fresh squeezed lemon on the beans, which told me that I should not bother making this recipe again.

Followed the recipe exactly except for allowing the garlic butter to cool for 20 minutes because ainâ€™t nobody got time for that! These green beans were delicious and the smell that hit me once I added the nutmeg brought back unexpected memories of my Omaâ€™s mashed potatoes. I didnâ€™t find the red wine vinegar overpowering, but rather, a great complement to all the other flavors. My suggestion to anyone concerned about the vinegar would be to use a good quality vinegar that has a nice flavor profile in addition to the acidity. I used a Chianti red wine vinegar bought at my local grocery store.

Beautiful presentation and so yummy! Do not overcook the beans. Next time I will take less time in the blanching process as they had to sit a little too long in the skillet before serving. Delicious.

Love it!  But I always steam the green beans in the microwave to speed up things.  Also, I love garlic, so I just add it directly (minced) to the butter, onions, and thyme.  Makes the overall recipe about 30 minutes instead of 50.

I didn't bother with that butter garlic step. I did spend extra time carmelizing the onions. Also, I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used balsamic, rice vinegar and a little red wine. It was yummy.
