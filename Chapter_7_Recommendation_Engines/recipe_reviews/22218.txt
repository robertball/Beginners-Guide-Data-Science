OMG what more do you want besides chocolate syrup, ice cream and booze!  These were so good DH requested I make another batch.  I know we'll make these often, especially during the hot summer!

Very yummy and easy to make.  I thought the brandy was a little too strong (I'm not s big brandy fan), but my boyfriend thought they were delicious.
