I substituted half and half for heavy cream. Green onions for shallots. Pinot Grigio for Chardonnay.  Grated Parmesan for Romano cheese. Added just about 8-10 tiny cubes of mozzarella and about 2 tbs of crumbled Feta cheese just before serving.  Substitutes were for on hand availability/savings.  It was absolutely fantastic.  I approximated all measures and adjusted for taste, I ended up adding more half and half to reduce the excessive lemon juice I had over squeezed from a half of lemon. I hope I can duplicate it next time, All four of us really enjoyed it and I will do this again soon.  My compliments to the contributor of this recipe.   I also made a bruscietta brushed with EVOO, using some of the pan fried shrimp, mozzarella, sliced baked/dried tomato slices, red peppers and garlic to go along with it.

I doubled this recipe and I'm so glad I did because we like a lot of sauce on our pasta. I also omitted the shallots, used half/half instead of heavy cream, and only used half the butter and it's still fabulous! I like the zip that the lemon adds.

Add angel hair pasta to the ingredient list to aid shopping. Delicious sauce but number of shrimp seemed inadequate so I added scallops

I didn't flour the shrimp.  For one thing, I'm trying to cut down on carbs,and for another, why bother?  Otherwise, this came out really good.  I used WAY more garlic than called for (we just love garlic around here) and I used fat-free half and half (thanks Linda) instead of cream.  I stirred about a tablespoon of flour into the half and half and that was all I needed to thicken the sauce.  The lemon seemed to disappear into the sauce, so I squeezed a bit more in at the end of cooking.  I served this over whole grain linguine (which looked awful in the package, but came out okay).  I took the leftovers to work for lunch.  Very good recipe, DonnaT.  Thank you.

Based on all of the positive reviews, I was really looking forward to this. Unfortunately, we didn't care for this at all. It looked bland, it tasted bland...I won't be making this again.

Very good. I used pino grigio instead of the chardonnay and added diced roma tomatoes to the sauce. Next time I will up the garlic and shallots for more flavor. Overall this was a very delicious dish.

THIS WAS AWESOME! I made it on the fly with all three of my boys running around and it turned out GREAT! I didn`t have the exact amount of cream but it was still wonderful. The sauce was very flavourful and my kids ate it up and asked for seconds (ages 3 & 18 months) I was hesitant to add the butter (too much fat) but I did it in the end and glad I did. I will make this again and think I might use it as my go-to recipe for company. Thanks for a wonderful, easy recipe.

It was very good. I didn't have any shallots, so I omitted those, and did cut the butter to only a quarter cup. I addded italian seasonings--maybe 1/2 tsp. We really enjoyed it and it was pretty simple to make!

I used this sauce recipe to make a homemade version of olive garden's chicken scampi and it was so yummy and more delicious than the copycat recipes i've tried! i heated 2 T olive oil and added 1 med clove minced garlic. cook 6-8 chicken tenderloins, season with garlic powder and pepper and set aside. saute 1/2 large red bell pepper and 1/2 large green bell pepper, sliced,  in remaining oil until soft. set aside. cook sauce as per these directions, except i used milk instead of cream, so i needed a bit of cornstarch to thicken, added in about 1/4 c sour cream for creaminess and tang and whisked over a quick boil after the second bit of chicken broth was added to reduce. use only 1/2 the butter, it really doesn't need it, and add in some italian season and serve over pasta cooked in chicken broth. super yummy!! :)

Very, very delicious and seemed to be beyond restaurant quality. Like some other reviewers, I also added scallops, and cooked them the same way I prepared the shrimp.

Awesome!!!  Used parmesan and 1/2 the butter directed and still wasn't necessary.  Do not think the breaded shrimp was necessary either.  But will make again for sure!  Didn't think I could make something this good!

We had this for dinner and it was so delicious.  I served it over Angel hair pasta.  I usually make the traditional shrimp scampi that doesn't contain cream but I won't be going back!!!  :)   Great recipe, easy to make and serve.  Thanks very much!!!

This was SOOO delicious I have been craving shrimp like all the time right now and this recipe is exactly what I needed! We aren't big wine drinkers around here so I substituted the Chardonnay with Parrot Bay Key lime rum and I substituted parsley with Italian seasoning because our store was out and we keep it on hand and this was sooo good. We served this on top of some parmesan noodles and it tasted so good it was worth the time it took to cook it!

I must have just done something wrong...the dream made the whole mixture curdle, which I had hoped would dissolve.  The taste was pretty so I just kept adding red pepper, mushrooms, garlic salt..but nothing seemed to help the flavor.  However,  I let it sit while eating my salad and veggies, it seemed to taste better.  

I was so excited for this, but like I said it could have been something I did based on all the good reviews.  I am not a "measurer"..lol

We enjoyed this dish, although I won't make often b/c of the high calorie content. I decided to make the sauce and add the shrimp at the end to cook - seemed to work well for me. I added pinch of pepper flakes and more garlic as mentioned by others. Used 1 cup of wine and cut the broth in 1/2. I didn't bread shrimp b/c I forgot, so i added in a little corn starch at the end to thicken. Sauce was still runny, but if you like to sop it all up with bread it's perfect.

Excellent recipe, very rich so I wouldn't make it very often but for a special meal, you betcha!!  I made two tiny changes, only used 1 tsp of lemon juice (not lemon lovers) and used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of the cream.  Otherwise, followed the recipe.  Timing was perfect and adding back in the shrimp that was floured thickens up the sauce perfectly.  I served it over angel hair pasta.  Thank you for posting this great recipe.

This sauce is really ggod. Add the lemon juice a little at a time to taste. You can also use dried parsley and parmesan cheese. I've made without the shrimp for a white sauce for pasta.

Not much a fan for shrimp...I know, don't hate. However, this recipe was a Hit. Had to add a little more wine, water and cream because the recipe did not look like it was going to be enough...and I was right. My family loved it. Thanks

I thought it was good but the cream came out kinda gravy like? Maybe its because I substituted chicken broth with vegetable broth but I think what can make this recipe better is making the shrimp extra crispy by frying it =)

This was delicious. The only change I made to the recipe, was not adding shallots and that was because I didn't have any on hand.
I served it with pasta the first night and the leftovers were served with brown rice. It reheated wonderfully too.

What I see happening a lot with reviews, people make a lot of changes to a recipe and then give a rating...How can you rate it good or bad when you're not following the original recipe?  I don't think leaving out the shallots made too  big of a difference in this recipe, but some of the changes I have seen made in other recipes are just crazy - then someone will give a review. How is that an accurate rating?

Utterly delicious decadence!  My changes per time & necessity:  I doubled the shrimp; used green onions instead of shallots; used Pinot Grigio instead of Chardonnay; used 3 TBsp butter instead of 1/2 cup.  Oh-My-Goodness.  I think I could eat this every day if I didn't know it would kill me, and even then it might be worth it!  I served over fettucine.  Try topping it with a nice garlicky bruschetta, it's crazy good.

This was good.  Comparable to the shrimp scampi at Grand Luxe and Cheesecake factory (if you flour and fry the shrimp).  I recommend using the rice instead of pasta.    As the sauce isn't thick.  The rice will absorb the excess.  Gonna have my leftovers with brown rice for lunch!  I also used alot more garlic. Will definitely make it again!!

Really didn't see the need to bread the shrimp.  Adding 1T. of flour after sauteeing the shallot and garlic helps the sauce to thicken.  1/2 c of butter to finish isn't necessary either.

This is delicious! I orefer a thicker sauce, so I reduced the wine and broth even more before adding the cream. Got rave reviews - thanks for the great recipe!

This was very good! I made this recipe as written and served the sauce and shrimp over fettuccine noodles.  The shrimp had this beautiful four coating with a wonderful texture and I lost quite a few while I was making the sauce. To avoid soggy shrimp I did not add the shrimp to the sauce but instead warmed them in the oven then served them on top of the sauce topped with fresh parsley. Amazing! The sauce was delicious! To avoid the curdling the cream, lower the heat to low and add a little cream at a time, if the cream starts to curdle add in a little butter. The acid in the sauce may cause the cream to curdle but adding more fat will help. Thank you for the recipe will be making this again!

This needed a lot more seasoning.  I prepared it as given except for more garlic. When I served to my family (who were pretty excited that I was trying a new recipe, they quickly said it has NO flavor.  So I added a lot of Italian Seasoning and "Gourmet Garlic" seasoning before I served myself.  Mine was great.  they added the same to theirs, but it was not mixed in as well, so a little disappointing.  My daughter went back for leftovers and liked that much better since it had the seasoning.

This was delicious!! I actually used chicken instead of shrimp and added a dash of Italian seasoning. Just before I served it I stirred in some brown rice and it was like risotto. Excellent - definitely a keeper!

Fabulous!!! I am a shrimp scampi snob -it is one of my favorite dishes!  This was great! I added more garlic and lemon as well as some cooking sherry and a pinch of crushed red papers. Served it over angel hair pasta.  Worth the calories and fat for a special dinner!

Great recipe.  I did add sun dried tomatoes chopped that I had drained as well as subbing fat free half and half and only using 2 tablespoons of butter at the end of the recipe.  Thank you for a delish dinner, I will make again and my husband loved it!

Do NOT return the shrimp to the pan for reheating, especially not for five minutes.  You'll end up with pink pieces of rubber.  Once the shrimp are cooked, don't cook them any more.

I added a few more cloves of garlic, used a Sicilian white wine named Insolia, added a bit more Chicken stock and butter to increase my sauce since I served it over thin spaghetti. I also browned and added sea scallops which everyone enjoyed. 
I will definitely make it again.

I reviewed the comments and added more garlic, a dash of old bay, used FF 1/2 & 1/2, 1/3 cup of butter and added 2 sections of laughing cow Swiss and 1/4 cup of parm to the sauce to thicken and flavor. Very good, sorry for all the changes but worked thru it as I went along to get flavor and consistency we prefer. Would definitely make again. Served over zoodles.  Delicious.

Make a stock out of the shrimp shells. Use a small potion of miripoix and water. Boil it down to the one cup and sub it for the chicken stock. Makes ALL the difference!!!!

Great basic recipe! Here's what I did: I sliced a few carrots very thinly (just enough to give color and texture), sliced one medium onion thinly, men's three clothes of garlic. I sauté these in olive oil until onion is almost translucent. I then added the shrimp coated with the flour and salt and pepper and sauté that with some additional olive oil and spices including the parsley. I added the chicken broth all at once. I don't know why they ask you to divide it. I then added one cup of cream and 3 tablespoons of lemon juice. I did not have white wine but it was perfectly fine without it. And I didn't see the need for the butter so I didn't add that either (it's a lot less fat anyway). I added my pasta and set it aside to settle for about 10-15 minutes.

So I'm a little bit of an impatient cook. I was waiting for this to thicken a bit and took matters into my own hands - mixed up some cornstarch with water and mixed it in. Well crud, all this did was separate the butter and leave me with clumpy shrimp. So I seperarated the shrimp with the clumpy cream sauce, placed it into a new saucepan and added 1/4 cup of half and half. Good as new if not better! Added also a pinch of red pepper and it turned out exactly like my favorite expensive store bought scampi. Absolutely yummy and I'll make it again, possibly with the same cornstarch mistake ??

This is a fantastic recipe! I followed a couple of the other suggestions - used half and half instead of heavy cream and just added 1 tablespoon flour to it instead of cooking the shrimp with it. Served it with linguini for Valentines Day and it made a very special dinner. Will definitely make again!

I used green onions instead of shallots. I doubled everything except for chicken broth and heavy cream I used 1 and a half cups of each. It turned out awesome. 4 of us completely devoured it.

Delish with changes. I had no Chardonnay, shallots or chicken stock. Used Brandi, onions and beef stock. I omitted the lemon juice. I forgot to divide the stock during cooking process and added all at once. No problem. It still worked. I loved it and will make it again. Yum!

Fixed this recipe for the first time tonight. Followed the recipe exactly except I did have any wine on hand so I substituted extra chicken broth. This recipe was delicious however next time I will use 1/4 cup butter and not put the shrimp back in the pan. As so as I did the batter came off and the cream soaked into the shrimp.

I wasn't able to try this recipe as the cream curdled as soon as I started to pour it into the pan. I'm going to try making this recipe again, next time omitting the lemon juice.

As written, this is pretty bland.  Made it a second time and added WAY more garlic.  That helped a lot.

It was a hit with my husband. I made a few changes due to what was on hand. I didn't flour the shrimp, it just wasn't necessary. I also added a little more lemon at the very end for extra flavor and did zest from the lemon on top with fresh diced tomatoes. I didn't have fresh parsley so I used dried and also added some dried basil to kick it up a bit. I reduced the butter to 4 tablespoons which was more than enough. Also used white cooking wine since i didn't have a white opened. Used diced onion instead of shallots since it was handy.  Had parmesan cheese and that worked just fine.  Served it classic with a salad and warm rolls.
