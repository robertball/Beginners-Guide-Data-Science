I am a beginner when it comes to cooking and this was really easy to make! I did substitute orange marmalade for apricot preserves, and I left out the red pepper. I also doubled the preserves to take away the mustard taste. It came out perfect! I will definitely make this again. Thanks!!

We like spicy food, so we sprinkle additional red pepper flakes on top - SOOOO good! Sauce needs some additional salt, but all in all, we like this! We also used half-and-half instead of the whipping cream to cut some calories :)

I forgot the mustard which made it "too sweet with an unanticipated aftershock of spice" for my husband. I think it was a nice subtle sweet/spicy flavor. Mine thickened up nicely in about 5-7 minutes. I'm thinking about using it as a barbeque recipe without the cream, perhaps over a salad.

It's a good idea with great ingredients, but I think it needs more marmalade.  I practically doubled the amount & I think I should have tripled it.  Red pepper flakes were a nice touch, as well as the toasted almonds

Not one of my favorites. It sounded great, and was easy to make for the most part. I did add twice as much marmalade and mustard since the only flavoe it had was sweet and had to add corn starch to thicken. We ate it, but I will not make it again.

My boyfriend and I loved this! I did substitute walnuts instead of almonds, because that's what I had on hand, but so good!

Not that flavorful. Need to add more red pepper or something. Also need to let the mixture sit for 10 min after turning off stove. Sauce needs to thicken. Need to try again.

I did not care for this recipe.   I love all of the ingredients but married together it just didn't taste good.   I ended up adding much more marmalade too as the mustard was overpowering.
