I made my own pizza dough, I used half a recipe of Pizza Crust for the Bread Machine II, which made 14 oz of dough, exactly what I needed for half a recipe of the stromboli.
I think with this recipe less is more as the side split open when baking, next time I would use 1/4 the toppings with 14 oz of dough, I sprinkled with Italian seasoning as well. Will serve with pizza sauce on the side. Baking time of 30 minutes was spot on in my oven.
Very tasty, will be a hit at our hockey party tonight!
