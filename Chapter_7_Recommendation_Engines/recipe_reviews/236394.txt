It's delicious! My husband prefers meat so I used homemade chicken broth. Also I added 1/2 lemon at the end :)

I loved green borsch when we lived in Ukraine! I just bought  some sorrel seeds so I can make it authentically (instead of spinach). I also love to make it with chicken broth, but with no meat. Delicious!

I've been collecting Russian recipes and this one's a keeper because of its simplicity,  tasty flavor and nutrition. This is a very good soup, reminds me of a soup my Russian father used to make. A nice comforting soup good on any day but  extra good on a cold or overcast day. It's a "light" soup but I am a "light " eater most days so it is my preference but I'm sure some meat could be added to make it heartier. 

I've made this soup twice and the only thing I did different the second time was using  10 cups of broth (I used chicken even though I'm sure good veggie broth  would be good as well) instead of the water.  I also sprinkled dry dill, a bit of fresh pepper along with the salt and sour cream dollop just before serving. Yum!

Was tasty but needed meat, so I added 1lb of  pork loin on the second try... now it makes for a good hearty soup
