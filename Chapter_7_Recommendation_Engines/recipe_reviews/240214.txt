I am always looking for interesting salads that are substantial enough to be a meal for my family. I buy that 7 pack of romaine lettuce at Costco or Cash and Carry...so making it through that much lettuce in a week's period is a challenge. I really liked the addition of corn (I used fresh corn). I also threw in some black beans to boost the nutrition.
