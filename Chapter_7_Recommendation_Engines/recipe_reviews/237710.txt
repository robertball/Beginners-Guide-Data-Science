Woooow! This exceeded my expectations!!!  Like another reviewer said "this is better than regular chocolate cake.Light and fluffy when it came out of the oven and a little more dense once it cool down, but delicious both ways. I only had 1/2 cup of butter so I substituded the rest with melted coconut oil and buttermilk instead of regular milk. I would like to use half coconut oil half butter next time so I'll report back to see how it turned out. Thumbs up from everyone in our family!Thanks Stacey for sharing your recipe :)

I cut the recipe in half, and used 1/4 cup butter instead of 3/8 cup, and 1/2 cup honey in place of the sugar.  I completely omitted the chocolate chips.  It took 40 minutes to bake in a 9" pie pan. This fantastic gluten free recipe was sweet and delicious!

I made this according to the recipe.  The first impression was so awful I thought I was going to have to toss it, but after it sat for a few hours some sort of miracle happened, and I have to admit it's exceptionally good, and I don't mean just as a "healthier" version of chocolate cake.  Of course, if you're looking for diet food, this isn't it, but if you're going to load up with sugar and fat, you might as well include a healthier carb if it's this wonderful.  I frosted it with a simple ganache made with about a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips melted with 1/3 c. sour cream.  It may be my signature dessert from now on.

This is an amazing cake, favorite chocolate cake recipe -- gluten free or not -- and one that family asks for again and again.  Some changes: (1)  I substituted coconut oil for butter.  (2) I added 1 t. cinnamon and 1 t. instant coffee to the melted coconut oil to bring out the richness of the chocolate flavor  and (3) I substituted 3 T. coconut sugar, 3 packets stevia, and 3 packets monkfruit extract for the sugar, so it's not quite as sweet (I don't like super sweet cakes). ALSO -- I whipped the eggs and milk for a couple of minutes in the blender before adding the quinoa. This makes the texture of the cake very fluffy.

This cake is really good. I made it by the recipe twice and everyone loved it. However, I also have a family member that cannot eat chocolate. Huge bummer. I took a chance and traded out the Cocoa Powder for Peanut Flour and swapped the Chocolate Chips for Peanut Butter chips and it was just terrific. I made a peanut butter frosting and everyone loved this cake too!

Will be my go to gluten free chocolate cake.  Only think I added was a tsp. of instant coffee into the batter to enhance the chocolate flavour.

Cake is delicious... but incredibly crumbly.  Read somewhere that Baking Powder can cause this.  Maybe I didn't level them out right.  Will definitely try this again with less Baking Powder.  It's nice to make a cake and know that there is something healthy in there for you.  Thank you to the inventor of this recipe.

I was distracted when making this cue and forgot to add any butter!  It was still delicious, very moist, stayed together…and much lower in fat!

this is one of the tastiest chocolate cakes I have ever eaten.It beats the flour chocolate cakes by a mile...It is light and delicious! My first time baking with Quinoa. This is going to be a regular treat on birthdays for my chocolate loving gluten free friends. I hope it is listed under chocolate cakes as well...and that different ingredients don't intimidate those who haven't tried using them. This was easy to make as well. I cooked my Quinoa like pasta and then drained it.

This is a delicious gluten free option that is easy to make without having to stock up on a bunch of GF flours. The recipe doesn't state specifics on pan size, which will drastically affect the outcome. The first time I made this, it was tasty, but dry. The second time, I poured it into a 9x13 baking dish and baked at 350°F for 30 minutes. It turned out perfect!

Wow! This was really good. I have never baked a cake without flour before, so was a little concerned how it would turn out. It was very moist and had great chocolate flavor. Perfect with vanilla ice cream and a cold glass of milk. Next time I might bake it in two cake pans and frost it. Great recipe!

This is the best chocolate cake ever!  Better than wheat recipes I think.  It turns out best if you blend the quinoa in the blender until it is smooth.  I have made this recipe numerous times and it is excellent every time.

I loved this! Best chocolate cake I have ever had ever! I loved the texture. You would never know its gluten free. I doubled the recipe and poured it into 2 round pans. Cooked for 40 minutes.

Yummy!  I'm g-f also appreciate the quinoa nutrient value.  My 75+ parents, traditionalists who grew up with Betty Crocker, loved this too.  I used about 2/3 c each pecans and choc chips, and next time will add a full cup of nuts.  I think this would be amazingly good in round cake pans, layered using a raspberry filling/spread between the layers.  Not sure how the form will hold as it is slightly looser than cake,  but it is so good this would be fun to dress up and serve!

I loved this recipe! It was delicious, although the texture of quinoa is hard to change... So if I make this again, I guess I will blend or mash the quinoa so it won't have as much of it's texture. :-)

(I gave some to my neighbor who is gluten-free, and she absolutely LOVES it!!! She even asked for the recipe!

Great cake.  Even better the next day.  One tip I would recommend is to mix the milk, eggs, and melted butter and add that liquid slowly to the blender with the quiona.  I found there was so much liquid vs. quinoa that the quinoa didn't really puree like I wanted it to. With less liquid added in the blender, it would have pureed much more smoothly then I would have added the remaining milk/egg/butter mixture.  I used a food processor (I don't have a blender) and the cake was delicious.  I didn't even frost it - all it needs is a light dusting of powdered sugar.  I added a tsp each of cinnamon and espresso powder to highlight the chocolate.  Wonderful recipe and relatively healthy for a dessert.

This cake was fantastic!  I took it to a school function and everyone raved about it.  It was rich, but not too dense and with a great flavor.  I served it with raspberry sauce to cut the chocolate a little and it was so good.  Great recipe - thanks!

I did not have chocolate chips, nor nuts. I increased the coco powder to 1.5 cups and the sugar to 2 cups, and the quinoa to 2  1/3 cups and added an extra large egg. I threw the cooked quinoa in the freezer, it was still a little on the warm side, however this is amazing!!!! moist, the best texture and I am making it again tonight!!!  Best cake ever!!!!

I invited friends at the last minute for supper and needed a dessert that was gluten free....this worked.  I had everything in the cupboard and the end result was amazing.  I have already saved this recipe to have on hand next time.  Serve with ice cream or fresh strawberries and whipping cream!

I was so crazy ecstatic about how good this was! I only added 1 cup of sugar but you could probably get away with 3/4 cup if you wanted. Hubbs and dad are diabetic so this was an awesome recipe to find. So so so delicious!!!

Very potent chocolatey taste, it was delicious. I love the facts that I did not have to cream the butter and sugar (easy wins!!) and that I did not have to substitute with gluten-free because it already is GF! Next time I would use less cocoa powder but will definitely make it again.

I halved the recipe and baked in an 8x8 pan, which is pretty close to half of a 9x13 pan.   This is a nice satisfying chocoate cake.  Moist and dark.  I do not have a blender and used the food processor.  The quinoa was not 100% smooth, but it was fine.  Just an awareness of "something" between the teeth a little.  I did not add nuts or chocolate chips, but that may have camouflaged the quinoa texture.  It was not a problem though.  Happy to have a gluten free dessert for friends without having to buy special ingredients.  Thank you for posting the recipe.

Made this today, omitting the chocolate chips and nuts.  Hubby served as my guinea pig, as he will definitely tell you if he doesn't like a recipe!  I didn't tell him what it contained, only that I was trying a new recipe that I had not made before.  He proclaimed it "very good".  I put a german chocolate icing on it.  It was moist and delicious.  I'm not real big on chocolate, but I thought it definitely had enough chocolate flavor without the chocolate chips.  First gluten-free recipe I've made.  Will definitely save this one to my recipe box.

Fabulous! Very moist, delicious chocolate flavor. I replaced the sugar with 1/2 cup of agave, and it was great. One of the best chocolate cakes we've ever had!

This was a wonderful surprise.  Making GF cakes has never been particularly thrilling for me - and I always thought they were extremely dry.  This is now in my recipe box for all future GF birthday cakes (or cupcakes)  I didn't add the chocolate chips - I didn't think they were needed - extremely moist

Wow! This is an amazing recipe.  No changes made. I did leave out the nuts but it still had a nice bite to it. I tried the cake when it was warm, I didn't really like it. I waited until it cooled off to try it again. I added Nutella on top. It's a perfect midnight snack :) Thank you for this recipe!!!!

I made this just to try something different. I followed the recipe, except I used up some open chocolate chips I had. I ended up with about twice what was in the recipe, but no one complained. Go figure. I wish I would have made a chocolate sauce like the picture has, but otherwise this was great and very easy.

As moist as a cake mix except the flavour is homemade and amazing!!  Incredibly easy to make.  I have made it as a loaf, as a cake, and as cupcakes.  Brilliant every time.  Easily five stars ....and I have never given anything five stars.   If you need to eat gluten free, try this recipe!

So delicious and 'healthy'.  I have made it several different ways and it's always delicious.  I have substituted flax or chia "eggs" for the eggs, used cooked brown rice instead of quinoa and used Truvia in place of the sugar.   Always turns out moist and so fudgy.

Okay I was intrigued by the use of quinoa in a cake so I made it the first time as written.  By the way, PLEASE include cake pan sizes - I have several rectangular pans and they are all different sizes.  I used a standard 9 x 13 and the cake was only about 1 inch tall. The first time- although it tasted delicious- it was actually a bit 'greasy' from so much butter.  Also, I guess I didn't cook the quinoa long enough because I actually had some crunchy kernels in the cake.  No one minded that however because flavor was great.  The second time I used a 12.5 x 8 x 3 pan. 
 I left out the choco chips and nuts and I took other reviewers advice and subbed some applesauce for half the butter.  It was just as moist and didn't affect the flavor.  Cooked the quinoa a bit longer - but still had a few crunchies in the bottom of the cake. Both times, I lined my pan with parchment paper on the bottom and sprayed with cooking spray.  Release was a breeze.  Cake rose higher using less butter.  Also, the second time I used buttermilk instead of milk, two real eggs and egg subs to make up the other two (I ran out of real eggs) and that probably also helped the rise.  Overall the recipe is a success for flavor, but if I make it again, I will do so with the changes I used on the second try.

I made this for someone on a GF diet for Easter dinner. It was quick to put together and was delicious and moist. Followed directions exactly except I blended the wet ingredients and then added quinoa and blended again. Everyone was talking about how good it was! Definitely will make again when a GF dessert is needed. (The only reason I wouldn’t make it otherwise is because chocolate cake isn’t my personal favourite type of dessert).

I love this recipe!  The second time I made it I altered the ingredients slightly to be dairy free due to a friend's diet.  It was a birthday cake for her and she just loved it too!  She has the recipe now.  The last two times I made it, instead of making a cake I made mini-cupcakes - I think I like these the best because I freeze them and then we have little chocolate bites that are really rich and delicious.

OMG! Just took this out of the oven about 5 minutes ago...so it's still warm. Couldn't wait for it to cool down to try it. It's amazing! I made as stated in recipe, except used 1 cup sugar and 3 packets of Truvia (stevia) sweetner, and then 1/2 cup butter + 1/8 cup and the other 1/8 cup coconut oil. I was concerned it would taste too much like coconut oil if I used too much. Next time I will sub in more coconut oil for the butter...at least the quarter cup, or maybe 1/2 cup. I also added about 1/4 tsp of butter extra just because I had it and thought it might add some extra buttery flavor to the cake. I used both semi-sweet chocolate chips  and pecans because I love pecans. I think next time I will eliminate the nuts though. I don't have a super expensive blender, but my quinoa seemed to blend up nicely. I did do as one other person suggested though and beat the eggs and milk first with the vanilla and butter extracts, then added in melted butter/coconut oil, and finally the quinoa. Also, just because I didn't have time to make it last night, my quinoa sat in the fridge overnight. Not sure if it being super cold and having 100% absorbed any water made the difference in that. I will DEFINITELY be making this again...likely becoming my go-to chocolate cake!! Can't wait to try another reviewers post about making a peanut butter flavored cake.

I had a few issues making this. First, it required far too much salt. I think a pinch is adequate as the half teaspoon made it taste too salty with hardly any sweetness, even with the chocolate chips. I also found that when I blended it, it didn't come out smooth as stated. It did when I added the dry contents to the wet then blended it in the mixer. It's got a great texture and is moist when baked. I will definitely make it again but with a lot less salt.

Delicious! The first time, I made a half recipe just in case I didn’t like it. I think I undercooked it because of that but it made he middle of the cake a little gooey and SO good. The flavor was really rich and chocolatey. Will definitely make a full cake next time!

Followed recipe exactly and it is SO good. It did take about 50-55 minutes to set up in the he middle, however. Rich, moist but not dense, and such an incredible way to get the family to consume quinoa.

This cake is decadent, moist and totally luxurious!

Of course, me being me, I had to just taste the batter a bit to see if any adjustments were needed. My daughter and I agreed it needed triple the vanilla, so I used a full tablespoon of vanilla. I also added about 1/4 cup of real maple syrup to the batter as to my taste buds, it needed something extra as the flavour was a little earthy. 

I used 90% cocoa chocolate as all the rest have some type of glucose from wheat and wheat is what I have to avoid. I also react to lecithin. Most chocolate has lecithin or glucose syrup from what. I also have to be very particular about what cocoa I used, or I react to that as well. I use dutch processed baker's choice cocoa, the best I can find. 

The dark chocolate bar made the cake have a slightly bitter tinge and I absolutely love it. It counteracts the sweetness. 

My daughter remarked that it's just like a chocolate mudcake and it is. I'm in love with this cake. I will probably try to use flax seeds for eggs next time and almond milk for cow's milk, and all maple syrup for the sugar . 

But as it is, this cake is the BOMB! It's been so difficult to find cake recipes as I react to rice flours, potato starches, maize flours...the gluten free version of things with other types of starches makes me swell up like a balloon. Like gluten free pizza makes me incredibly sick. 

Because I am so sensitive to cocoa powder and how they process it (sometimes it makes me react), I will endeavour to

My toddler who  doesn't eat anything chocolate flavoured, gobbled this up!!! I made a few changes; used oil instead of butter, omitted pecans and chocolate chips because I didn't have any and made them in muffin moulds ( 350 degrees for 22 minutes). I plan to send them for pot luck at my son's school next week. This recipe is a keeper.

This is easily one of the simplest recipes,yet it is really great. I added white chocolate roughlly chopped to the batter and some strawberry jam on the top,just to make it look a bit nicer. Was also a bit worried it would be dry, but that was not true at all.

I made this for Passover dinner, served with raspberries & whipped cream & garnished with fresh mint.  It was a HUGE hit!  I didn't mention until after everyone had tasted it that it was made from QUINOA & no one could believe it.   I used honey instead of sugar- and based on the other reviews, I originally reduced them amount to only 1 cup.  However after I tasted the batter, I felt it needed more sweetness, so I took a chance and stirred in 1/4 cup of brown sugar (after I had already poured the batter into the pan!)  Good thing I did.  Even with the full 1.25 cup, it was just barely sweet enough.   Otherwise, I followed the recipe- except that I probably added more pecans & chocolate chunks than called for- and also added a dash of cinnamon to deepen the chocolate flavor.  I baked it in a spring form pan with a tube insert, which made a pretty presentation.  The only reason I'm not rating this cake a full 5 stars is that the cake was **very** crumbly.  Next time I'm going to try cooking the quinoa a little more to make absolutely sure there's no moisture left in in.  I'm also dying to try liquor or orange juice instead of the milk.  In any case- the TASTE was just *spectacular*, so even though I want to work on the consistency a bit, this recipe is definitely a keeper.  Thank you so much!

WOW!!! This recipe is SO GOOD! I made this in a 9x13 pan which the cake sadly stuck too, so definitely be sure to use parchment paper and cooking spray. The texture is more like a brownie. Great recipe! Will certainly be making it again!!

This cake was absolutely delicious! I made it for my birthday and shared with a bunch of friends. I'd forgotten to add the chocolate chips but it really didn't need them. It was chocolatey and moist. Everyone loved it - especially those who needed gluten-free.

For a gluten-free cake,  this recipe is pretty tasty. I used a red quinoa. I thought the finished cake had a bit too much quinoa texture - a little gritty. If I make this again, I'd try to  over-cook the quinoa. My blender didn't seem to pulverize the quinoa enough - even though I used a high speed setting. As others have said, it's a bit crumbly - not surprising since its gluten free.

I made it just as the recipe says. It was delicious. I will make it again for my family because it was super easy, tasty and moist. It is better when cooled down. No frosting or icing necessary. It will be my go to recipe for cake. I don't even like chocolate cake but it is just that good.

Omg this is going to become by default chocolate cake recipe for all time. It's really easy to put together once you have all the ingredients. I replaced pecans with walnuts and used Belgian chocolate bits for the extra chocolaty flavor. It was amazing when hot and great even when it cooled down. Strongly recommended.

I made this by subbing all fats with COCONUT OIL (which still has mild coconut flavor) and XYLITOL (USA birch tree ) for under 3000 calories, two 9" round cakes about 1" high.  

Used regular Hersey cocoa powder, got pretty intense chocolate flavor, will try something more potent next time.

Not health food but oooh so much better than many alternatives for a true chocolate lover. Half  of  the cake was gone before it cooled off.... I have not found decent dark chocolate that is sugar free,  low/good fats, so this is pretty close to the best option for us right now!!! LOVE IT!! Try it!!

I don't go far off the beaten path when it comes to baked goods. However had to give this a try. You see my husband hates quinoa but loves chocolate cake. So I whipped this up one day and he pretty much devoured the whole thing! It's a bit heavy but what can one expect not using flour.

My fiancee totally loved this cake. He was like "Man, this cake is awesome!"  The cake was very moist and very rich. I brought some of the cake to work and all the people who tried the cake was fascinated.

For me it was a bit too sweet...next time I will reduce the sugar.

Thanks for the recipe. Awesome, awesome, awesome!

It was ok.  For me, it still had the stinky baking powder or soda smell that I associate with most chocolate cakes.   Also, I used a little more than 1/2 cup butter, but not the 3/4 cup called for in the recipe.  It was fine.  And, I reduced sugar to 1 cup.
But, won't make again.   A waste of good quinoa really.....

Easy and delicious!  I adjusted this for nine servings size and it fit just right in an 8x8 pan.  I made it and took it untasted to a salad luncheon and it was a big hit!  The texture was moist and it did not fall apart.  I baked it so I would have at least a couple of hours for it to cool before serving (thanks for that tip from another reviewer) and dusted the top lightly with some powdered sugar to add a little character to the top.  It did get done 3-5 minutes sooner since I was cooking in the 8x8 pan and I used a brown glass pan.  This is going on my list of delicious things to make when I want to take something chocolate and tasty to functions or if I want chocolate cake at home.

i'm not sure how fair i can be with rating this as i am out of cocoa powder.. i wanted something sweet that would still be healthy, hence choosing this.. i just put it in my mind that i was making muffins.. that being said.. this came out okay.. i used liquid sucralose for the sugar and am sure the texture/consistency would have been better if i had used sugar.. but again, i was trying to make something healthy.. this came off very eggy.. i *did* use jumbo sized eggs so maybe that's why.. or maybe it's just the nature of the dessert.. made me think of a souffle

Phenomenal. I added a quarter cup of coffee because my blender is weak and I needed more liquid. Best chocolate cake I have ever made.

This cake is amazing! I used semi sweet chocolate chips. It does taste like dark chocolate. I think next time I'm going to increase the sugar a bit and use milk chocolate chips (or even white) instead. That is not because the cake is not good, but simply because I personally prefer it a bit sweeter. It tastes just like a piece of good dark chocolate. It is definitely very crumbly, but as long as you're prepared for that, it's not an issue. :)

These were really, really good.  I used less sugar than called for and dark chocolate chips.  My 2 yr old loved them and I don't feel guilty giving him a chocolate "cupcake" for breakfast.  I topped with the Paleo Chocolate Frosting from this site and they were just outstanding!

loved it, thanks for sharing, what a great treat for our son who is gluten free.  made no changes to original recipe.  I did make sure I found soy/gluten/dairy free chips to use as others have ingredients we would not use.                       ..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
