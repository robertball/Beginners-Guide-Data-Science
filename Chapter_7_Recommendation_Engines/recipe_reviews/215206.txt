I used frozen bananas, fat free evaporated milk, and cut back on the ice. My kids thought it tasted like banana bread! They drank up all four servings.

I made this smoothie today in honor of National Banana Lover's Day :) I scaled it back to one serving and used skim milk, fat-free evaporated milk, and Splenda. Still delicious!

I thought this tasted pretty good. It kind of reminded me of of a banana version of orange julius. I changed the servings to 2, or half the recipe, with the calculate button. The only change I made was subbing reduced fat milk and evaporated milk and 1 packet of Truvia for the sugar. My ice is not crushed, so I went with 6 ice cubes for the 1 cup I needed. The only downside, is I just wish evaporated milk came in smaller cans. I really dislike opening a can unless, I am going to use it all. However, I think it added some kind of a slight creaminess to the texture I don't normally get from just using milk in similar banana milk drinks. I also didn't add the cinnamon on top, because I forgot. I thought it tasted fine without it.

While simple and easy...it wasn't our favorite, it was okay. Not sweet and not seasoned enough with nutmeg. My daughter and I added sugar and nutmeg until she was satisfied. But we both agreed, it still had the after taste of evaporated milk slightly above the banana taste.
