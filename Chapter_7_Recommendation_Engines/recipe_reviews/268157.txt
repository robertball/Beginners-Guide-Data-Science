This turned out incredibly well. I did set the liver aside, way aside, so far aside that I didn't use it. After straining the gravy I picked the meat off of the neck, pulsed the other giblets in a food processor along with some of the carrots and returned them to the gravy. Giblet gravy as I know it has giblets in it.

It was very tasty but it did require a lot of time. Not sure it was that much better than my plain old one made with drippings and flour paste and a little water! I did like the addition of chicken broth and garlic. Will definitely use that again!

Wow! Truly 5 star. I confess just made up to the rue since will finish tomorrow. All strained & ready for the turkey drippings. I am going to cook mushrooms w/butter, then add some flour as my rue. This will be out of sight. The "starter" as it is now, smells like Thanksgiving. Can't wait!
