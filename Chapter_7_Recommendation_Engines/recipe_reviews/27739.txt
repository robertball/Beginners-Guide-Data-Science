I thought this was really good. I know it's supposed to be "soupy" but I did add just a little cornstarch (maybe a teaspoon or two) just to thicken it up a little. I poured the curry chicken all over some rice (used the "fried rice with cilantro" recipe that can be found on this site) and let the sauce soak through the rice. So good! Note to curry paste newbies: Either be super careful or have your Ajax or Comet ready because the paste will stain anything it touches.

I order and eat curry chicken fairly often at many different Thai, Indian, and Malaysian restaurants. Every place I've been does it a little different. I followed this recipe exactly, and was very disappointed with the results. There is definitely something very important missing although I donâ€™t know what it is. It is spicy but lacks flavor. Also the dish comes out much much too soupy, the sauce has the consistency of water.

This is a really easy and yummy recipe, but I found it a little lacking in flavor. I added a little extra fish sauce, probably 4 tbl. spoons, and about 3-4 tbl. spoons brown sugar. Alot of Thai recipes are better with brown sugar. I served it over jasmine rice, and everyone loved it, including my two yr. old twins.

Very very good recipe. Instead of green curry I used Panang curry paste that I bought at the local supermarket. I also  made a few changes. I added a small can of pineapples and one zucchuni like the way my local thai restaurant made it. I cut out the waterchestnuts. It was delicious although I think the thai restaurant put in more coconut milk but you can adjust it to your taste. Will definately make it again!

Ahhh yeah!  Found one that tastes like what the good Thai restaurants serve, and I even forgot to add the mushrooms, and I only had dried basil on hand!  Beware of adding extra green curry paste like I did.  Serve over white rice like I always do at the restaurant, especially if you think it is "too thin" (don't ruin this good Thai recipe by adding cornstarch).  Thanks, Ken!

Really enjoyed. Added some cornstarch to thicken somewhat, as well as some onion, carrot and celery. It was delicious! The fresh basil is very important and next time I will try red curry paste in stead of green for a different taste.

I don't really know what to make of this. I love Thai food and eat it often, but I've never had anything with water chestnuts or bamboo shoots in it. Also, every time I've had mushrooms in Thai dishes, they have been straw mushrooms; and cilantro - not basil - seems to feature heavily. This was a nice enough meal, but a little bit weird. Btw, I would advise anyone who isn't used to cooking with things like green curry paste and/or fish sauce to add it a little bit at a time - both really are an acquired taste, and you could easily spoil the meal by adding too much at once. (Apologies for the long review).

We enjoyed this.  I took another reviewers advice and put in pineapple which was good addition.  It complimented the spicy.  Will make again.

Definitely a bit spicy, but my gf and I liked it as is.  I reduced the coconut milk by 1/2 can and it was just the right amount.  We followed the recipe as is except for the fresh basil (and coconut milk) which we didn't have.  We used dried and it was a mistake.  DEFINITELY use fresh basil.  I would make a suggestion of adding another half of a bell pepper, some julian carrots, and another 1/2 cup mushrooms.  I think this would make it about perfect.  Serve over Jasmine rice for a complete meal!

This recipe is awesome, my family loves it!! I love how easy it is, I add about 3 or 4 green chilis and cilantro (the way our fave restaurant does). With or without the additions this dish rocks..Thanks Ken

Normally for 2 tablespoons of curry paste you would use 1 can of coconutmilk.  Kapocha or eggplants (Thai) would be good in a green curry.  I prefer pork in green curry.  Chicken is great with red or yellow curry paste with potatoes. I have been cooking Thai for 25+ years.  I have learned from many in Thailand during my over 30 trips about The Kingdom.

BTW fresh water chestnuts are wonderful and sweet normally used in stirfries by Thais.  Canned are starchy and not a usual ingredient for a Thai curry.

This recipe is too soupy as others have said. Unless it is supposed to be a soup, leave out one can of the coconut milk.
Many reviewers say it tastes like it's missing something. It is. The curry powder. We like curry, so we had to add about two tablespoons of the powder, but that should be added with caution to suit your tastes. Don't use dried basil in this. If you can find fresh Thai basil use that. It is what is used in Thai restaurants. It has just a bit of a different taste to it. If not, regular grocery store variety fresh basil is fine. A leaf or two of Kefir Lime also helps. That ingredient is also used in Thai receipes almost without fail. Both the Thai Basil and the Kefir Lime can be found in Asian grocery stores.

Short review: If you want to make a good curry, consult your curry paste container and see what it has to say.
Longer review: Most pastes will say ONE can of coconut milk and ONE can of water. And then you reduce the liquids to a desired thickness. I can't imagine using 2 cans. 
Also, I've eaten a lot of green curry (it's my favorite) and I have to say I've never seen water chestnuts in any of those recipes. Bamboo shoots are usually in panang or massuman curries. Green curries usually have zucchini/broccoli, onions, carrots, and sometimes snow peas and/or kaffir lime leaves. Personalize it. As another reviewer suggested, cilantro would probably work a lot better than basil and it's usually easier to find in your grocery stores. Finally, if you're using a pre-made paste, you probably don't need fish sauce. That's usually involved in making the curry paste from scratch.

This was an OK recipe.  It was a little runny. So, I would probably not use as much chicken broth if I make it again.

This was absolutely delicious!  It tasted like I had ordered it from a Thai restaurant instead of whipped it up in my own kitchen! I will suggest expirimenting and adding more vegetables to the dish and maybe a tad of cornstarch to the sauce because it does come out rather thin, but still, this dish is a delight.

My party was a hit thanks to Ken, the recipe was perfect - I did add a few things.  Tomatoes, and potatoes.  All the guests raved over the extra ordinary flavour, truly Ken is something of a magician and this curry recipe will be passed down to my decendents so that they may enrich all their dinner party guests of the post millenuim!  This curry is truly post-milleneal!

This was a very easy, very tasty recipe.  We substituted low-fat coconut milk to reduce the fat content and it still tasted great.

I love thai curries generally and I really didn't like this. I'm not sure why I found it so different from everyone else. I found the fish sauce overpowering - next time I'd use 1/3. I made the recipe exactly as shown - I do that every time I make something first time. The coconut milk was a little too much, but still not enough to drown out the fish sauce.

I halved this recipe and omitted water chestnuts & bamboo shoots because I didn't have any.  Used red curry paste and red peppers instead of green.  Otherwise followed recipe ingredients and this dish was fabulous.  We are Indian curry lovers so this milder version was a nice change.  Husband loved it and I will definitely make again.  Very easy  too.

Ken you're getting a five because I and everyone else really enjoyed this dish.  My friend who cooks with coconut milk all the time, told me that 2 tins was far too much and I also left out the chicken broth.  The liquid did reduce (it took forever) however, next time I will add the vegetables later as they just turned to mush.

I have to go with the comment that there is something missing from this recipe that is extremely important.  I love green curry and get it when we eat out Thai at many different restaurants.  But I could not bring myself to eat more than a few bites of this.  It was way too bland.  I prepared the recipe exactly as indicated.  It smelled WONDERFUL.  But the taste was extremely disappointing. It was "spicy hot" enough, but it was lacking something else that I cannot put my finger on.  I had to throw it out.  I suspect that maybe there is too much fish sauce or something because the blandness had a greasy mouth-feel to it.  I'm at a loss to figure out what is not right with this one but I don't want to try it again!

This DOES taste exactly like the food you get in the Thai restaraunt! And...you can even do it in the crockpot. Just keep the chicken breasts whole, add everything to the pot and cook it about 5 hours on "low", then cut chicken into pieces.

This soup was alright, not like the ones I've had at thai restaurants, but it does taste like a thai dish.  I think the coconut milk overpowered the whole dish and it tasted like it was missing something.  My sister liked it, I personally won't make it again though.

I have not made this recipe yet, but my husband loves panang curry chicken and has been begging me to try out a recipe. Has anyone considered adding lemongrass to this recipe? Our favorite local Thai place uses it in their curries and it gives the dishes that extra zip. Just curious. Thanks!

7/25/08 juicy; good flavor; best over jasmine rice; use 1 can coconut milk & red curry paste instead of green. See review of 7/28/08

Awesome flavor!  Used red peppers instead of green to make it look prettier and served over white rice.  Next time will add some salt and sugar.  This recipe makes a large portion.

I made this and it turned out great!  I couldn't find curry paste so I used to T of curry powder. I had no idea how much to add. I also added cayanne pepper since the powder wasn't spicy.  I will make this again for sure.... do others find the paste in their regular grocery?

This recipe is excellent. I think the heat in green curry paste must vary by brand.  I put a little more than was called for in the recipe and still had only mild heat when it was cooked.  Thanks Ken!!

Easy and tasty recipe.  I only use one can of coconut milk, two cans seem too much.  Did not use chestnuts or mushrooms, substitue with eggplants.  This recipe is a keeper.  There is no substitution for the fresh basil, yum.

I thought that it was plenty spicy with 2 tbls of green curry paste.  Must be the brand you use.  This was very good, something was not quite right though.  It was a touch more coconuty than the typical restaurants ones I've had, but something else was missing.  My guest had seconds though, so all in all a very good recipe.  I added 1/2c. shredded carrots to mine, and left out the bell pepper because my Thai restaurant makes it that way.  Don't put in the cornstarch, the sauce is traditionally thin.

This recipe made a LOT of sauce (we hate when we run out of sauce at our fav thai restaurants), almost too much.  And it is definitely hot.  Next time, I think I'll use 1 or 1.5 cans of coconut milk (oh, I use lite, by the way).  I substituted cubes of peeled eggplant for the green pepper.

I'm pretty sure I used a curry paste that ruined the recipe.  For whatever reason, all I could taste was coconut milk and the ingredients - no curry in the sauce, even though I used the correct amount.  I'd also cut the coconut milk in half, and added red pepper flakes, but that didn't help.  Will not make it again, as I'm not sure what I could do to correct it.  It's a mystery!

This was way, way, way too spicy for me.  I can't imagine that any human can eat this.  I ended up rinsing everything and recooking it in just plain coconut milk.  It was okay in the end.

This was great!  We added green onions and bean sprouts and a little extra curry because we like it really spicy.

This was quite good. I added celery and sliced baby carrots into this, as it seemed to lack substance, consisting only of sauce and chicken.  It wasn't, in my opinion, too hot or too mild, altho I enjoy it rather hot so would probably increase the ammount of curry next time I make this.  I tried to boil down the sauce a bit, but after 30-40 minutes of boiling it hadn't reduced enough and was still rather soupy.

This recipe was very tasty -- AND HOT, but a little too soupy in the sauce for my liking.  I will probably add some cornstarh mixture to thicken it up when I reheat the leftovers.

This is going to become my official I'm-too-tired-to-cook meal.  Very easy and versatile!  I tossed in more veggies like tomatoes, sliced carrots and celery.  Can easily be served as a vegetarian dish or substitute fish or seafood in lieu of chicken.  I also made fresh springrolls from a recipe I found on allrecipies, and the dinner table looked and smelled like our favorite thai restaurant - but without the long wait.

This was definitely spicy- that green chili paste has quite a kick. I thought the coconut milk was a bit overwhelming- two cans is a lot. The recipe was pretty good but not outstanding, I'll try other curry recipes before coming back to this and tweaking it.

This was my first foray into homemade thai food... the smell of the fish sauce scared me to death so I skimped a little on it- but the flavor was still great overall.  I would definitely make this one again.  Thanks Ken!

If you follow the recipe it is very soupy.  You need to boil it down or add less coconut milk.  Also I added 6 tbsp of green curry paste, was really good

I never saw such disagreeing reviews as this one - but Ken - I go with the side that said it was not Spicy or hot.  I scaled this down to four servings - it called for 1 tbls of green curry past - it was so bland that I ended up using 5 tbls and 1/8 red cayanne pepper.  With those adjustments we really enjoyed it.  Its a quick meal to make during the week.  I will make it again.

This was my first attempt to make Thai at home.  Ken's recipe was so easy and it turned out pretty good.  But the sauce needed more spice for me (maybe it is because I used red curry paste instead of green?).  I added 1 tsp cayenne pepper and some black pepper.  Didn't have fish sauce, but used soy for the salt factor.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this recipe almost exactly as stated, with the only exception of using dried basil instead of fresh.  It came out extremely bland and boring.  It had heat, but it still tasted bland.  I tried to make it more interesting by adding salt, pepper, and other spices, but to no avail.  This is nothing like what I've had in Thai restaurants.  Sorry, but I will not be making this dish again.

I've never been to a Thai restaurant, but didn't like this recipe.  The curry was too hot and too soupy, with an odd assortment of vegetables.  It had an odd milky green color as well, which was unappetizing.
