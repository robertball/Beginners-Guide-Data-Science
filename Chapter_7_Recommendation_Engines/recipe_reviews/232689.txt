DELICIOUS! I used a 16oz. bag of frozen tortellini cooked according to the pkg. I have to admit that I pretty much eyeballed everything (did not use any extra artichoke liquid, as I felt it didn't need it), but all of the flavors together were wonderful. I served this cold and it was a huge hit  at dinner tonight...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I wasn't quite sure about the pimento peppers - I assumed that meant one of those little jars; 3 oz = 3 Tblsp.  They kind of got lost in the salad.  I thought the salad needed something crunchy - I tried sliced carrots the second time I made this and they really helped.  In the end, I the dressing just didn't do much for me...

This was delicious!  I dropped half of my tortellini on the floor and added small pasta to make up the difference and it still came out spectacular.  I also added grape tomatoes.  I am a fan of artichokes but my husband is not, and he loved it too (even with extra artichoke liquid!)  A keeper in my book.

Fantastic. I had dry tortellini and cooked those up and I also added black olives and pickles instead of pimentos. Also added grated radishes and carrots from my garden. This salad is wonderful and I cant wait to serve at a picnic tomorrow. I'm sure it will bring out more flavors as it sits overnight. A keeper.

Wow, this is really good!  I'm impressed!  I followed recipe exactly except used a 16 oz bag of frozen tortellini instead of 9 oz.  Great recipe!

This was really good!  A super easy fix for when you want to make lunch a little different from the usual pasta and marinara sauce.  Instead of pimento peppers - which we didn't have in the house - I used roasted red peppers which were delicious!  Next time I will add less mayonnaise to make it a little lighter.
