Ohhh, I could eat a bowl full of this! My cooking time was shorter, about 30 minutes, as my spaghetti squash was small. It is so important not to overcook this if you want the squash to separate into spaghetti-like strands! Copying what a favorite restaurant of ours does, I added julienned zucchini, unpeeled--makes for a livelier, more colorful presentation. I've also made this using sunflower seeds and it is equally delicious.

This is SO good.
It's a shame that the ONE person who rated this one star has to skew everyone's perception of how good this is.
It's definitely 5 stars.
I had to use rubbed sage (I used 1tsp), but it was still AWESOME.
I loved every bite.
The only flaw is my spaghetti squash was too small and it didn't fill my family of 4's tummies all the way.
This would be a GREAT lunch dish because it's lighter than most meals.

this is delicious. i sauteed some garlic, shallots, and onions, then sauteed the cooked squash a little bit. very tasty. for thanksgiving i will be doing basically the same thing, but doubling the recipe, maybe a bit more cheese, putting the whole cooked thing in a big casserole dish, and topping with bread crumbs. yummy!

This was great, I will definitely make it again. I used powdered sage, walnuts and a parmesan, asiago, romano blend. Really tasty and healthy too.

I LOVED,LOVED,LOVED this recipe. The pine nuts, romano and squash really worked together. I threw in some garlic, and added my usual blend of spices(we like strongly seasoned food.)The only reason I'm rating it a 4 star recipe is because my oh-so-loveable hubby didn't care for it. But really, what does he know?

This was very good. I found fresh sage so I finally tried this. The only addition I made was some salt that had a few spices in it. I think theis would be really good with the addition of chicken to make a one dish meal.

Very tasty, even though I had to omit the pine nuts (friend is highly allergic).  When I make this for my family next time I'll add them - they will really make this dish special.  I grew lots of sage this year and dried it, so I used dried sage in this (a heaping teaspoonful).  I'm so glad to have another recipe that utilizes sage - I tend to forget about unless I'm cooking poultry or making stuffing.  It goes very well with this dish!

We will make this again and again!  My kids said it was better than regular spaghetti, and enjoyed helping me prepare it.  The squash has a slightly sweet flavor that blends perfectly with the cheese and sage.

Don't know if this is a fair rating of the original recipe because I butchered it up based on what ingredients I had on hand..but it tasted lovely! Used walnuts and slivered almonds instead of pine nuts. Sauteed the walnuts with some garlic in the butter (used 1/2 olive oil). Also added sundried tomatoes. Feta instead of Romano.

I loved this!  The balance of flavors was perfect.  Everything complimented each other so well - I loved the pine nuts with the squash, and the cheese (I used freshly grated Parmesan, what I had on hand) was a nice finish.  The sage wasn't too overpowering either.  I used rubbed sage and it was still fantastic.  We paired it with some breaded chicken cutlets and some good bread - fantastic meal.

This was my first foray into the world of spaghtetti squash and wow what an introduction! This recipe was awesome, and when I added some onion and garlic as per other reviewers it made it even better! I also decided to add some sauteed spinach and cut up chicken breasts to the mix and omitted the cheese. Amazing!!!!

Yum!  A perfect way to do spaghetti squash that is light and refreshing!  We increased the butter to three tablespoons, then sauteed the pine nuts in it with garlic and shallots.  PERFECT!

Out of this world! Cooked the squash as stated, then added it to a saut√© of shallots, garlic, S&P, a dash of crushed red pepper, and wilted spinach. Mixed in the toasted pine nuts at the end, and sprinkled with toasted Panko bread crumbs. This was quick, easy, and delicious!!

Delicious. Instead of Romano, I used crumbled goat cheese, and instead of pine nuts, I used chopped toasted walnuts. I also threw in a few garlic cloves that I roasted with the walnuts.

I love this kind of recipe...simple but classy and very tasty!  I did add a little more cheese than it called for.  I didn't have fresh sage either, so I used 1 tsp ground sage (dried)...I also threw in a little dried basil for some more color.  I noticed some unappealing pooling of liquid as I was getting ready to put this on the table...so I let the squash sit in a colander to drain for a few minutes, then put it back in the serving bowl and zapped in the microwave just before serving (and I also sprinkled a little more cheese on top just before serving)

Quintuple yum.  I used about 4 Tbsp. of butter (wicked, I know!) and started by toasting the pine nuts and sage leaves in the melted butter.

Made it per directions. It was fantastic! My 15 year old son raved about it. He never had this before...wants me to make it again. The Romano cheese was the secret weapon.

This one of my favorite 5 star sides, I have it often when we visit Rome. It's especially nice when accompanied by a Veal dish.  I fix it with the same ingredients just different proportions, I bake the squash the same amount of time, add the toasted pine nuts and cheese and toss. I melt two TBS of unsalted butter with 1/4 teaspoon of ground sage, drizzle over all and lightly toss again and salt and pepper. Even my husband (the avowed carnivore) eats this side dish.

So I could just use what I had readily available in the kitchen I substituted a few ingredients. Rather than using pine nuts I used walnuts and instead of pecorino romano cheese I used feta. It was fantastic and tasted and felt like comfort food! This will certainly become a fall staple in my house.

Super good! To serve just two of us, I used one very small spaghetti squash and 1 finely julieneed zucchini (w/ skin) and treated it as 4 servings when I added the rest of the ingredients. I used rubbed sage, about 1 tsp. I found this dish a little bland, so I tossed in a couple pinches of salt. I served this with Halibut Supreme from this site and the two dishes together really balanced each other. Yum! Just a tip, I cut the squash in half and microwaved it on paper plates and covered it with a paper towel. 5 minutes on one side, 4 minutes on the other. When it's a bigger squash, I do 11 minutes total.

Forget the long baking time! I put this in a microwave steamer for 10 minutes! I also added garlic and diced tomatoes! Left out the cheese because my friends are vegan, still it was a hit at my party.

Love this recipe! I didn't have any sage so I left it out and it was still delicious! I always make this dish and pair it with a whole chicken I cook in the slow cooker and they go together great!-bam88b

I really liked the method of preparation and the flavor combination--except the sage. Maybe I just don't like sage in general, but I think it overpowered an otherwise exquisite, subtle dish. The pine nuts and romano were great though.

I don't want to skew the ratings, I'm pretty sure I cooked the squash wrong.  I would have appreciated direction on how to seed it- I just took out the seeds and I am pretty sure I should have taken out the membrane too?  It was too wet when done.  I tried to dry it out in the oven and microwave with no success.  Anywho, I ended up using regular spaghetti with the same ingredients and it was very good.

I just made this and we loved it!!! Don't use sage, but I did sprinkle an Italian seasoning blend in place of it.  Feel like we are eating healthy and major comfort indulgence at the same time.

Winner!  As well as the shallots and garlic that someone else suggested, I sauteed the squash with speck (but regular bacon would be fine), portobello mushroom and dried sage.  No butter for me, just a touch of parmesan.  This very simple dish got a "wow!" from my fiance, who has asked for it again tomorrow night.  Now that's positive feedback!

I love squash but wanted a new way to make spaghetti squash that had less fat and calories.  This worked so well.  I only used  tbs of cheese and had to use dried sage as I didn't have fresh.  I also didn't have pine nuts so I left those out, but would like to try them next time.  I felt it needed just a touch of acid so I added just a splash of red wine vinager.  It was really tasty and everyone really liked it.  I'll definatly make this again.

I did not care for this. I love squash, but I thought the fresh sage was overpowering. Just a personal preference I guess. I think I will try something a less savory next time.

Really, really good.  I don't like recipes that overdo a veggie and this was perfect.  Since I didn't have any pine nuts in the house I substituted roasted sunflower seeds and added a little bit more of the fresh sage than called for.  I have a slow oven so it took longer than the time called for in the recipe and I did add a little water to the pan and covered it with foil.  I will definitely make this again.

I absolutely loved the texture of this dish. However, there was something about the flavor that didn't quite do it for me.  I think I will opt to try this combination of squash, nuts, butter/ cheese again, but next time I may opt to roast squash, then saut√© with butter, walnuts, gorgonzola, and maybe just a little white wine.

I've made this once exactly as described and also with the the substitution of pine nuts with toasted slivered almonds and the addition of garlic (roasted alongside the squash in the oven). It's been addictively delicious both times, although the garlic added some nice depth of flavor. This simple yet creative recipe's joining the permanent rotation!

Great recipe.  If you want to cut down on cooking time, simply microwave the squash, cut side down, in about a 1/4 of water for 5-7 minutes depending on the size of your squash.

Spahetti squash is so fun! I think mine was a bit undercooked at 50 minutes, but I went with it, anyway. I used more butter than called for - closer to 2 T instead of 2 t. I also used parmesan instead of romano. The combination of flavors is delicious.

Yum!  The spaghetti squash I used was 5 1/2 lbs. so I used half for this recipe and it was perfect.  I barely eked out 2 tablespoons fresh sage from my garden.  It's the end of March here in Colorado and my sage is just starting to leaf out.  I roasted the pine nuts for the last 4 1/2 minutes while the squash was still baking -  pine nuts toast up very fast so watch them.  Thanks Sarah for a great recipe.  Update: tried this again with the other half of squash but didn't have any pine nuts and used toasted almonds instead and still very good.

Super easy and super tasty.  Definitely will have a lot in our rotation.  We used what we had in the frig, so Parmesan cheese and pumpkin seeds instead of pine nuts.  Also roasted the seeds in the squash to add to the mix.  Will be eating this instead of white pasta in the future

This is awesome.  Added some minced garlic and fixed a side of marinara for my hubby...ended up fitting both our tastes perfectly. Thanks for the recipe!

This was awesome.  I love mushrooms and garlic so I sauteed them and added them.  I also made an additional side dish with whole wheat pasta.  Everyone loved both dishes.

So easy and fun to make. Delicious. Sage is a nice touch. I think a bit of garlic would be a nice touch.

I think my squash was entirely too big for this recipe. I added some additional butter (about 2 tablespoons total) and carmelized some white onions in the butter. The first several bites of this dish were good, but eventually I just could not eat any more of it without heaping on more cheese. I believe this dish would be best served as a side dish so you don't become sick of the flavor.

I made this recipe with 1 tsp rubbed sage, walnuts, and asiago cheese because that's what I had on hand, lots of variations would be good.  My husband and I enjoyed it.

I thought this would be a good flavor combination since I like pine nuts with brie and honey and I like sage and I like spaghetti squash, but it just didn't taste good together. The pine nuts were overpowering the whole thing. I gave it 3 stars because I'm thinking I am the odd ball here.

This was great!  I made it from memory and did a few things differently.  I sauted some garlic in butter and veggie stock then added the cooked squash, tossed and then added the other ingredients.  Next time I won't use the garlic, and I think a splash of dry white wine would be good too.

This was good and has potential to be better without the sage. I used dry sage and it was just too strong. I would try the recipe again, but maybe with some other herb or just the cheese and nuts. Pretty decent otherwise.

Awesome recipe, thank you!  I even used it as a main dish and my meat-lover hubby still enjoyed it! I only had dried sage so I used 1 tsp, but could have easily doubled that if I wanted.  Plus I added a little bit of sauted garlic and onions as we like flavorful foods.  Salt and pepper to taste and enjoy! Give it a try; easy, delicious, and nutritious!

I couldnt believe how good this was!  I didnt have Romano by itself so I used a four cheese blend that hard Romano, Parmesan and 2 other cheeses. Reheats well too. I had to have some for lunch the next day. My husband said its one of the best thing he's tasted. My 2 yr old ate it as well.

This recipe is fantastic! Based on other reviews, I eased up on the sage. I added 1/2 tsp. of rubbed sage, and it was perfect.  I used walnuts because I didn't have the pine nuts.  Thanks for this very original and wonderful recipe.

This is really good.  I used about 1.5 tablespoons of butter and some fresh green onions from the garden and used plain old plastic can Parmesan because I didn't get out to get the good cheese.  It was tasty.

ok - -spaghetti squash is just about the COOLEST vegetable ever!!!! I remember my parents making it when I was a child, but in all my 49 years, never had done so myself! This was good, but I didn't have fresh sage so used powdered, and 1/2'd the amount.... I thought it was still just a bit overpowering. There was just myself, husband and 14 year old so there are left-overs. I think I'll add some red peppers flakes as one person suggested for my lunch tomorrow. NOW I'm going to look for more spaghetti squash recipes!!!

It was fine but not as special as I was expecting. A little on the bland side. Maybe I just used too big of a squash compared to the other ingredients.

This was really good!  However, I'd use A LOT less sage.  I used the fresh and lessened the amount and it was still over-powering!  Other than that, it was wonderful!

I made a last minute decision to add spaghetti squash to my dinner.  I didn't have on hand pine nuts or any cheese of any sort.  I just used sage, salt and pepper, and butter.  Still turned out wonderfully, and will be made again!  I can't wait to add the other ingredients to see how it turns out.

I am disappointed that the rest of the family does not care for it.

OMG made this  tonight for dinner...it was amazing...I have to say though, you need to add garlic, shallots and maybe another veg (I added zucchini). , otherwise, I can see how it would be bland.   Made garlic bread with it and it was delish!

I made this because of the reviews. It was not well received by my family. The sage flavor way too strong and the pine nuts though toasted were not appealing.  Ah well.

This is an easy to prepare recipe, but does take time due to the roasting of the squash. The roasting could be done in advance, separating the squash from the skin, and saving the squash for the next day or later in the day.  Fresh sage and butter are important to the flavor, as is the fresh roasted pine nuts.

Would definitely make again.  My only challenge was fitting both halves of the spaghetti squash in the instant pot at one time (I had to do them separately).  This recipe seems like it would be very versatile to include different things in the squash like sun dried tomatoes or feta cheese.  However, I would not want to consider it a main dish as it was not particularly filling.

I made this according to recipe,  and while it was quite tasty, my crowd thought it should have more cheese and sage, so next time I will double the cheese to half a cup and put in 3 T fresh sage.  It is possible that I picked a very large squash at the market, and that is why it needed more cheese and sage.  Even as I made it, it was yummy.

I used Parmesan instead of  Romana as I believe that is used more in Italy with a sage butter sauce. I also sauteed the sage in the butter which infused the sage throughout all the butter.

I am filing this recipe under my favorites".  The only tweaking I did was to mix in 2 TBSP green onion tops  and  sprinkle some fine Panko on top before serving.  My boyfriend is fussy about squash in general but sure did like this one. Come on, what's not to love about the flavor and texture of spaghetti squash especially  when combining these terrific tastes?  Try it!

Very tasty! I increased both the butter and the cheese by a lot -- we like a lot of cheese and 2 tsp just seemed like hardly any butter for all that squash. It probably ended up more like 2 tbsp of butter and a cup of cheese. I also added quartered grape tomatoes because I had them on hand and needed to use them, and they went well. My favorite part was the toasted pine nuts though, yum. Next time I make it I will double those!

A very delicious and fun way to cook squash. Even squash haters will probably love this one! Made it pretty much like the recipe but cooked the spaghetti squash in the microwave, face down with just a little water (about 3 tablespoons) for 12 min. It cooks perfectly and after cooling for a few minutes, it is very easy to scoop out the spaghetti strands with a fork. I also added one zucchini cut into Juliann strips which was saut√©ed with the 2 teaspoons of butter in the recipe before adding the cooked spaghetti squash and the rest of the ingredients. Will definitely be making this great recipe again.                                         CO Karen

I will definitely make this again.  It made a delicious lunch.  I added some cooked chicken, mushrooms and red onions.  I am sure roasted tomatoes and spinach would be good additions as well.  I omitted the butter since I drizzled my squash with olive oil during baking.

Spaghetti squash is very healthy and wonderful but I'll have to find a different way to cook it. like the texture of the dish but I found it very bland (I followed recipe to a tee) and did not love the sage mixed in there (2 Tablespoons was too much for my taste). I feel I should have subbed the Romano for a stronger cheese and added spices + garlic.

Will definitely make this again! Have made several recipes with spaghetti squash, and, so far, this is my favorite. The only change I made was that I didn't have any fresh sage, so used dried sage.  When I baked the squash, I put it cut side down as instructed, but, added a bit of water to cover the bottom of the baking pan to keep the squash moist as it baked. Suggestion: check squash periodically for doneness. Time does vary with size of squash. 
 Totally yum!

I love this dish. It's actually quite filling so can definitely be a main dish. I added saut√©ed garlic, onion and zucchini and also added more cheese at the end. The toasted pine nuts really add a delicious and unique taste to this dish. I am inspired to grow spaghetti squash as a result of this dish!

First time making spaghetti squash and it was so easy and good! Made the recipe as written and taste wise, I felt it was a little overpowering on sage, but my husband didn't and wouldn't change a thing. Poor guy, I'll be reducing the sage just a little bit next time. Will be making this again for sure!

Excellent but add the cheese at the end...use less than the recipe calls for.  Also good with a touch of lemon juice.

I made it with a tad of leftover pesto sauce and it's yummy! Wish I'd discovered this squash sooner

I used parmesan instead of romano because I didn't have it available...and I didn't measure out the sage bc I didn't have 2 tbsp on hand...I believe I emptied about 1 tbsp into the mix.  I also cooked the spaghetti squash about 45 mins because I like my spaghetti squash more on the crunchy side than soft side.  It turned out so delicious anyway and it's so easy to make!  LOVE THIS YUMMY RECIPE!

I was dubious this would have much flavor but I was pleasantly surprised! My squash took the full 50 minutes. I toasted the pine nuts in the oven after removing the squash. I didn't have sage, so I just used Italian spice blend and Parmesan. I might add the other things next time or cut down on the butter but this is just fine as is. Thank you! Will definitely make this again!

I was underwhelmed by this dish.  I love spaghetti squash and thought this would be great, but it was just kind of blah.  Would have been fine as a side dish or if we'd had something on top of it, but it was our main dish.  Won't make this again as is.

I really liked this my hubby thought it was only okay. I thought i had sage then could not find any so I just added some garlic powder. He didn't like the pine nuts but I did.

I made this recipe exactly as directed, and it was delicious!  I served it as a side dish, and we had leftovers for lunch the next day.  Even my daughter, who "hates squash," had a second helping!  I will make this again.

I found that 50 minutes was way to long to cook the squash, and it was a very large one at that.  A little to bland for me

The dish was tasty, but didn't provide that certain "umph" we were looking for.  Also, I cooked it at the temperature and for the time suggested, but the squash still wasn't tender enough.  After increasing the temp to 375, and cooking for an additional 10 minutes, it was done.  My squash was a bit crunchy (not sure if it's supposed to be soft).  I'll make it again, but next time will probably go with brown sugar and butter instead.

This was tasty, but the cheese didn't mix in well with the squash.  The combination of the Romano chees, squash and pine nuts tasted great, but I think some alterations to change the consistency will be better.  This was a great recipe to start with for experimenting with something I'd never eaten or even seen before!

Although we didn't have pine nuts we made the recipe and enjoyed it very much.  My husband doesn't care too much for the texture of spaghetti squash so I gave this 4 stars.  We made half the squash one day and used the rest a few days later with simply brown butter and the cheese.  Fried it till a little brown and it came out great!  I'll be making this again.  Very good flavor for a winter type squash.  Sometimes squash is blah if you don't use a good recipe like this.

Everything about this recipe was amazing! Be sure to use fresh sage only and not a powder substitute.  I may have used a little more butter but that's it.

I was hoping to LOVE this dish but it wasn't 5 stars for me.  I agree it needs a little garlic or hot pepper flakes - something to give it a little more flavor.  To me, the sage was a bit too much.  I think next time I make this I will cut back the sage and add some garlic.  If it still needs a kick, I'll add the pepper.  The pine nuts/parmesan cheese was a great idea for this type of squash though!

I made this as described, wasn't really a fan-it was OK.  I did not have fresh sage so maybe that was the difference.

This was really good!  I used parmesan cheese instead of Romano because it's what I had on hand.  It was so delicious.  My family loved it.

I have no idea how I could dislike a dish so much given the other great ratings.  I made it exactly as per directions.  I didn't even know how to save it.  I must have messed up somewhere...but I don't know where.

I'm sorry, but I didn't like this at all. Followed the directions, but maybe my squash was too small, because it was mushy. There certainly wasn't enough to feed 4 people, but that's OK, because nobody really wanted much.

This recipe was good, but I felt the sage was a little overpowering (but I used dry sage).  I also had to cook mine for about 15 minutes longer.  Will definitely make again with less sage.  Thanks for a great new idea!

I doubled the ingredients to mix with the squash.  The squash I had was very large; hard to cut in half.  I substituted Parmesan cheese (what I had in the house) which made for a milder taste. My daughter enjoyed the dish more than I.

Delish!  I made it for my dad (who is NOT a veggie cuisine guy) and even he loved it.
