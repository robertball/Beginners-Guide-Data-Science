I like to use fat free evaporated milk and sugar free CHEESECAKE pudding. For low carbers like me, this can be served in dessert dishes like mousse. I just spoon the mix into a large ziploc bag, snip off the corner and pipe into the dessert dishes, polishing off with a dollop of whipped topping. My family loves this dessert.

My concoction:

12 oz pumpkin puree, 1 cup skim milk, 1 package instant sugar-free vanilla pudding mix, 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice 

(I didn't have any cool whip and the pumpkin was leftover from making a pumpkin cheesecake!).  This actually came out really well, had the consistency of a mousse, and was really tasty.  I definitely recommend this recipe.

Since there is no crust it is more like a mousse but it is delicious. Layer it like a parfait with crushed lowfat graham crackers for that crust "fix."

This is ok, since it IS a pumpkin pie for dieters, but I prefer it without the pudding mix in it. It gives a really bitter taste to the dish that I could do without.

A great quick and easy dessert for pumpkin lovers. :) More like a mousse. I like to put it in individual parfait glasses for a more impressive presentation.

Pumpkin pie is one of my favorite all-time desserts, and this recipe satisfies!!  I make the recipe pretty much as is, only I use sugar-free, fat-free cheesecake pudding mix.  I then make a crust with 5 low-fat graham crackers and two tablespoons of melted Brummel and Brown, baked for like 8 minutes.  Fill the crust and FREEZE!  Pumpkin ice cream pie!  Top it with the remaining Cool Whip lite and dig in.  At about 142 calories per slice, this is an indulgence you can have anytime!

I LOOVVEE pumpkin pie and this is stuff is pretty darn good! I used fat free sugar free instant cheesecake pudding and canned lite whipped cream instead of cool whip (hydrogenated oils, ick).  The consistency was good, not too runny and not too thick. I plan on adding crushed graham cracker to the top before serving after dinner!

This is def a keeper.  Changed it a bit due to ingredients on hand and others suggestions.  Used pure pumpkin instead of puree.  Added skim milk, cinnamon, a little vanilla and splenda.  Used instant banana pudding instead of vanilla (all I had) and folded in some Reddi-Wip whipped cream.  Let is set for and hour or so.  More of a mousse consistency.  Will add a little bit more pudding next time to get it to thicken a tad more.  So satisfying for a low-cal, low-fat dessert.

This is good, used 2 percent milk and added a tsp of splenda with the pumpkin spices.  Made this again, doubled the spices and used regular pudding to make it sweeter for family.  Still want to try it with cheese cake pudding.

Just what I was looking for--something quick, easy, sweet, and low-cal!  It even has some nutritional value with the pumpkin and milk.  I didn't follow the measurements exactly (just used up leftovers), but this turned out nicely.  It isn't especially sweet, so you may want to add a little Splenda or something.

This was really good but it is NOT pie. Putting it in the pie plate was pointless. Trying to cut and serve it was a disaster. Next time I will just mix everything together in a bowl like pudding and serve it in small dessert bowls.

Instead of vanilla pudding, I am going to used the butterscotch pudding.  I think the  light cool whip instead of the fatfree will make it a little thicker.

Awesome pie filling, especially for a "dieter's" pie.  I used the lowest calorie crust I could find, cause I just have to have crust with my pumpkin pie!

I really enjoyed this.  Like others said, this is more like a pumpkin mousse, so I added less whip cream.  I think next time I'll follow others' suggestions and use graham cracker crumbs as a quick crust.  For presentation, consider turning this into a parfait - cutting this into bars is not the best idea.

This is a delicious alternative to pumpkin pie!  My mom is diabetic, and I made this so she could enjoy the taste of pie without all the sugar and fat.  We were both pleased with its taste.  It has a very mousse-like texture, which we liked. It is also extremely rich, and neither of us could finish either of our servings (which really isn't a bad thing-it just makes it seem that much more decadent!)

I served this in small ice cream dishes with a few Nilla wafers. Wonderful!

Way too sweet. I used half the amount of Cool Whip that it call for, and it still tastes like it's basically pumpkin-flavored Cool Whip. I would cut the Cool Whip down to 1/4 cup at most, or leave it out altogether and just increase the milk to 3/4 or 1 cup.

This was so easy to make and tasted GREAT!  I took the advice of another reviewer and layered it with graham crackers to create a parfait.  My husband loved it so much he didn't care that it was good for him, too!!  I will definitely make this again!!

I layered crushed graham crackers between two layers of the pupking filling.  This gave the mouse a little more substance, texture and flavor.  The next time I make it I'll cut back on the whipped topping on the top layer by half.   Otherwise, a very yummy dessert that is very easy to make!

My mom made this for our Thanksgiving and really enjoyed it.  I don't like pumpkin pie, so it really wasn't for me.  Definitely more like a mousse or pudding instead of pie, and I bet it would be good made as a parfait with graham crackers (as another reviewer suggested).

This will change your view on Pumpkin Pie!!  It doesn't taste like a diet recipe.  Its so delicious!  Serve with cinnamon graham crackers or ginger snaps or eat it plain, but I promise you, you will LOVE it!!!

Very easy quick and cheap dessert. My family loved it! Will make again. I used the cheesecake no sugar pudding.

I tried this recipe and it was really good my kids even loved it.  I also tried to make it with Cheesecake pudding mix since I love pumpkin cheesecake and it had a weird taste.  I would recommend following the recipe exactly was the best take on a dieters pumpkin pie.

I found this recipe looking for a crust less pumpkin pie recipe but not necessarily 'diet', and decided to try it anyway since I had the ingredients, albeit not the diet versions. I used 2% milk, regular pudding and real whipped cream. I was skeptical at the amount of pudding (1 oz) as it didn't seem like much and after taste testing the mixture, it just tasted like the pumpkin puree straight out of the can so I added the remainder of my 4 oz. box of pudding and increased the milk according to the directions on the box. That improved it tenfold. I also portioned it into individual dessert cups. The end result was a pleasant pumpkin pudding-like dessert which was quite refreshing. This might be a nice alternative to a traditional pumpkin pie which is typically too rich and filling after a meal.

The only change I made was using cheesecake pudding.  I really like the simplicity of this recipe. I am going to try it with the new caramel flavored pudding mix next time to see how that works. Thanks for the tasty recipe!

I will make it again. And again and again. I am not a pumpkin pie fan but this was so good. I used white chocolate pudding instead of vanilla.

So yummy! I’m trying to eat healthy so this was a great low-cal dessert. I was too lazy to look for and defrost cool whip from my freezer so I made it without the whipped topping. I served the mousse in tiny bowls, dividing it equally. It gave me that pumpkin pie fix that I crave every once in a while!

This was awesome! The directions should have stated to put this in individual serving dishes. I made the recipe pretty much as written except I used real whipping cream because of all the unwanted ingredients in store bought whipped toppings. I also used fresh pumpkin. My b/f absolutely loved it and so did I.

Just made it and tasted it before I even put it in the fridge! Tastes fantastic! I put some in mini pie crusts for those that wanted it and the rest back in the cool whip container so we can scoop it out!

While this is named pumpkin pie for dieters it can easily be for those that are gluten free, like me;) This gave me the flavor of pumpkin pie without the crust and was great. I did use my own pumpkin pie spice and my spoonful was probably not level but heaping but I like pumpkin pie spice. Since this is mouse like I filled ramekins instead of a pie plate. To serve I topped with whipped topping and dark chocolate. I will be trying again with the cheesecake flavored pudding mix.

We all loved this.  Didn't even miss the crust. I did not use a pie plate. Served in individual bowls. You could put a graham cracker under each serving if you wanted to have a crust.

Easy pumpkin mousse with good flavor as is.  Could use a bit more spice.  Serve it up in individual cups.
