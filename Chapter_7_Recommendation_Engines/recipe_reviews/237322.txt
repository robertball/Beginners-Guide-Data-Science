Lactation Friendly Cookie Haiku: "These are delicious! Followed submitter's small notes, with little changes." The recipe submitter mentions in the description adding 1/4 c. cocoa powder (which I did), along with reducing sugar (which I also did - the white sugar to 1/2 c., and the brown sugar to 1/3 c. brown sugar/Splenda blend.) I never know when a cookie recipe calls for "oats" if that means old-fashioned or quick-cooking (obviously, not instant though), so in this case, I used old-fashioned, making the cookie a little chew-ier, which is fine by me. I had to check the ingredient list a few times to make sure I wasn't missing baking powder or baking soda, but nope, neither of those there; also saw no cinnamon listed and felt like it needed a touch, and I probably used a 1/4 tsp. I definitely didn't get 60 cookies out of my dough though, unless the cookies were teeny-weeny. I made decent sized balls of dough and flattened them out w/ the bottom of a soup can, and ended up w/ around 40-ish cookies. Ate one w/ a cup of mother's milk tea that afternoon, and while I may not have noticed a difference in my milk supply, my LO was happy to nurse, and I was happy to be eating a good, relatively healthy cookie.

For a lactation cookie, this is about as good as it gets. It definitely increases milk supply, although that is mostly due to the brewers yeast for me. The brewers yeast does leave a little bit of a weird aftertaste in these cookies, which does get old after awhile but it is still more pleasant than gagging it down in some juice.

These came out good although I did make a few minor changes.  I reduced the sugar to 2/3C brown and 2/3C white.  I then added 1/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa and 1 cup of chopped walnuts.  I also used a gluten-free flour blend instead of AP flour.  I've used other lactation cookie recipes before, but now prefer this one!
