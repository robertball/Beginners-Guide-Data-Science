I loved this soup and it was so easy to make.  I was surprised that only one other person mentioned adding liquid to this soup.  I even left the juice in the two cans of tomatoes and still found this extremely dry.  I took another reviewer's recommendation of adding a can of beef broth (low salt) and it was perfect.  I purchased a bag of frozen "soup vegetables" that already had the okra and potatoes in it.  Made it that much faster to make.  I can't wait to have some tomorrow since soup usually tastes better the second day.  Thanks for sharing!

If you make this soup, be sure to use frozen or canned potatoes, as raw potatoes will not get tender in 4 hours on low.

Great recipe. We added a lot more okra than was called for and we topped it off with fresh parmesan. We'll definitely make this one again.

I thought this was pretty good, nothing fantastic, just pretty good. My husband, however was VERY pleased with it and my two year old that only likes mac and cheese ate 2 bowls! So it gets a five because the family was happy and it was very easy to make. I did add 2 cans of water and 2 beef bullion cubes. I also just used a bunch of different frozen veggies I had. (I save small amounts of leftover veggies and freeze them for soups like this) I also cooked on low for 6 hours.

Great! Amazing how much flavor is in this soup! Kids love it and they are getting all their veggies! I saved time by using frozen vegetable soup mix (because it contains okra and potatoes in addition to the regular vegetables) I tripled this recipe and served it at my child's school for a program his class was having. Great cold weather soup, eat on it all day long right out the pot!

I followed this recipe exactly with one exception: I used ground chicken breast, not ground beef.  It all turned out quite good!  4 hours on low is probably good enough - I turned it to high for the last 2 hours because it took so long to hear up (what with the veggies being frozen and all), but in the end I would say my veggies and okra were over cooked, so I would stick with the creator's cooking reccomendation.

Great left over too - I took a small portiona and used some corn starch to thicken it up - also turned out good.

Will make again!

I couldn't wait to break in my new crock pot with this recipe.  I added some red pepper flakes and a few good shakes of oregano, which gave it more of an italian kick.  I will definitely make this again.

This was really good. Altho I added 2 beef boulion cubes and 1 can of tomato sauce, a bay leaf, italian herbs. It came out pretty much like the soup i make on the stove but i never thought of adding okra..i loved it. Thank you for this recipe!

Like LUZIANNADANNA, I bought the frozen veggie soup mix since it had potatoes and okra already in it. It took about five hours for mine to cook, but that didn't bother me. Also I only used one can of diced tomatoes. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written. This is a staple item for cold, winter months.

This was a great recipe. I added about 1 1/2 C of beef broth, used frozen veggies w/ okra added and did not add the ketchup. I also added 1 6 oz. can of tomato sauce. I've made this with the slowcooker and on the stove. Both were very good.

We liked this one!  I threw in about 1 cup of thinly sliced cabbage, 1 tsp. minced garlic and a tbs. Louisiana hot sauce and some additional basil and oregano.  Substituted 1 can of Rotels for the plain diced tomatoes.  Also added 1 tbs. balsamic vinegar.  Most soup recipes will stand up to 'tweeking' very well.  We definitely like things with some sass!!

Easy and very tasty.  We nearly always make enough to have next day !  Hint: toss the potatoes into the microwave for 5 minutes, then go!  I also like to soften up 1/2 cup of mulled barley, and include that.  Thin or thicken as you prefer.

Great throw together recipe.  My household doesn't really do hamburger meat so I used ground turkey instead.  Added a little worsestershire as some suggested. Great over rice. Thanks!

I think the garlic and tomato paste makes this soup too sweet for my taste. Also it took a lot longer to cook than recommended in the recipe.

Okay ,well this was okay. I really liked the addition of Okra to soup which I have never used before. The potatoes did not cook so next time I will leave them out and boil them before I serve. Also was a touch bland so add some spices. Or cover with beef broth instead of water.

Good starter base but as written it was just bland and not soupy enough for us. I read a lot of reviews and followed others suggestion on seasoning and adding 2 cups of beef broth. A very hearty soup.

This was delicious! I used a 16oz bag of All Natural brand "vegetables for soup" and added one can of seasoned diced tomatoes and one can of Italian stewed tomatoes and did not drain them prior to pouring them into the crockpot.  I also added a can of red kidney beans (drained) and two small cans of sliced mushrooms (drained) to the mix.  I'm actually eating this at work as I write this.  I ommited the ketchup, but added a lot of seasonings: garlic, Italian, Oregano, more garlic, parsley, salt and pepper.  I can't wait to make more of this.  Simply wonderful.

So EASY! I did use canned potatoes as others suggested. I did not use water, just substituted beef broth. Added a bit of garlic and Lawry’s season salt. Very filling and easy on the pocketbook. Thanks!

As others have noted, use chicken, beef broth, etc. to add more liquid or you will not have enough. This is an absolute keeper! It is good with or without Parmesan cheese sprinkled over the top. I also made it on the stove top in no time at all.

soup was fantastic. i left out the potatoes and poured the soup over prepared egg noodles instead. added a bit of red peppar flakes to ground turkey, and poured the juices and all into the soup!  Yummy! Used a frozen fiesta blend that included garbanzo and kitney beans, and also used a lot more frozen okra than called for. Really turned out great!

Needs alot more seasonings and spices. Love all the ingredients by themselves, but very plain without extra spice...perhaps lots of Italian herbs.

This is my second time making this soup.  The kids had never had okra before and they went crazy over it, loving the taste!  I used beef broth instead of the water.  Needs about 7 hours on low, not 4.

This was FANTASTIC, but I did make a few modifications. I used one 12 oz bag of frozen mixed veggies, and one 12 oz bag of frozen cut okra. Instead of the ketsup, I added an 8 oz can of tomato sauce. For the liquid, I used a can of low sodium beef broth, and refilled the can 3 times with water and it was the perfect consistency. I also added some garlic powder, basil and oregano. This took longer than 4 hours for the potatoes to soften, eventhough they were cut up fairly small. I would suggest closer to 6 hours. Great base recipe. Thank you!

This soup was Great! I didn't drain the tomatoes and had to add 1 cup of beef broth in addition, hence the 4 stars. I did use 1 can of diced potatoes because I was afraid regular potatoes wouldn't have time to get done due to my time constraints. I had to turn my heat up to high for about 30 minutes because some of the veggies weren't done. I simply forgot the ketchup, but it was probably just as well, because the soup was plenty sweet enough without it. I'm going to make it again tomorrow, because I'm sick and just want soup to eat. This is so good that I just want to cook this recipe. Thanks KR. You done good!

Great soup. Even if you decide to add your own flavor to this it's a great start. I have made this countless times and the pot is always empty after dinner is served.

I really like this, but I modified it a LOT. My son, who hates veggies with a passion, LOVED THIS!! :) 

First, I just cooked it on the stove. I used 1 can of beef broth and added water as necessary. I also added a pound of hot sausage. Per one of the reviews, I added some bay leaves and a tablespoon of oregano. I added barley. i substituted Rotel instead of the tomatoes. i also added cayenne pepper to my taste. Instead of slow cooking, after browning the meat I added everything and then boiled for 3 minutes, and simmered for about 2 hours. 

The result is wonderful. Add some parmesan cheese to each bowl, if desired, for even more flavor.

I did as previous raters suggested and added 2 beef bullion cubes w/2 cups of water.  I also added dried oregano, basil and parsley along with 2 bay leaves.  Yum!

Excellent! Never had okra before but always looking for something new and healthy. May even leave out the beef just for a vegie soup. I used low sodium vegetable stock in place of water.

This soup was excellent.  A great soup for the slow cooker, we could not stop eating.  Usually, half ends in the freezer for left overs. None left over here.

We all loved this soup, especially my boyfriend who said he did't like okra! I cut the tomatoes down to 1can so it wouldn't taste like italian stew, and added about 20oz of beef broth instead. I added a small amount of leftover it. sausage to it and deleted the ketchup. Will definately make this again. Delicious and easy!

This was pretty good, used frozen okra and 2 cans italian style tomatoes.  I think I let it cook too long as the veggies were a little over done, but other than that, not bad.

I used this as a base.  I did not add frozen veggies, but canned ones instead because I did not have any frozen ones.  Did not add any okra because I was afraid it would get slimy.  Needed some seasoning, but other than that it is a good base.  Thanks for sharing:)

This is the very first time,that i have made this~the okra is very hard to cut,you have to use one good sharp knife & i also believe what they DON'T tell you in the recipe is that..the okra should be boiled before putting it in the slow cooker,with everything else..i also took the advice of some other cook~she used canned potato's as of instead using raw,potato as it won't be cooked in 4 hours..another thing i used differently was Diced tomato's with little green chillies in it~as our stores don't carry Italian Diced tomato's..so it's to play around with the flavors..i even put the juice in with it..so the fact that,my okra is still crunchy after cooking it for 4 hours~i will transfer it to a pan & heat it on stove top to see how the okra will soften up~but all in all~the broth taste awesome~!!..i used fresh okra by the way~our stores don't sell frozen okra~ours game from out garden~   :D

As so many have noted the recipe needed tweeking. Here's what I  did. I used a frozen vegetable gumbo blend  soup mix which include okra, onion s, celery, corn, and red peppers. Then I  added a half an onion chopped, a half of a large carrot chopped and I medium potatoes diced. I, too, dropped the ketchup.  For spices I added 2 tablespoons of basil added 2 tablespoons of oregano.  I used a quarter of a cup of red wine and also of Worcester shire sauce. We  had a cup of left over green beans in in the frig so I tossed them  in as well. I also added a clove of garlic.  Everyone thoroughly enjoyed the new creation!

I used this recipe as a framework because I had some fresh okra that needed to be used. But I expanded the flavor profile and ingredients. I used ground turkey, lots of green, orange and yellow peppers, added celery, garlic, tomato paste and lentils. I used chicken broth to give it more depth of flavor.
I also used my XL pressure cooker so it was ready much quicker.

This was really delicious!  I used ground turkey and left out the okra because I didn't have any.  I also used a sweet potato because that's what I had.  Like others, I added a can of beef broth.  Again, based on what I had, I used a can of stewed tomatoes and a can of Rotel with habaneros, which added a nice little kick!  Versatile recipe based on what you have in your pantry, and quite delicious!  I cooked on high for about 3 hours and then low for 30 minutes and it was perfect!

This is a very good, basic recipe.  I've made this more times than I can remember of the past few years.  I do make some tweaks to the recipe.  I do not use ketchup and use beef broth instead of water.  The beef broth really makes the soup much more flavor able than using using just plain water.

I have made this soup several times because my husband absolutely loves it! Of course, I love it also. But what is really neat about this soup is that you can make it your own depending on what mood you are in. Tonight I added quite a bit of garlic to the onions that I browned with the ground meat. Then I added a 28 ounce can of fire roasted whole tomatoes that I chopped up as they cooked. I left out the potatoes and just used the rest of the vegetables that the recipe called for except that I use cans of green beans and corn. I used a bag of okra. Then at the end I seasoned the pot with Italian herb seasoning. That really did the trick! My house smells delicious!  Have fun with this easy recipe soup! ??

I made this soup and it was very dried out. The next time I make it, I will add some beef broth or more water.  Besides being dried out, it was delicious.

Made this with fresh veggies instead of frozen (carrots, peppers, beans), and diced the potatoes very small.  Used broth instead of water, and added extra Italian seasoning.  Next time, might add hot peppers or sriracha for a bit of a kick, but pretty solid recipe overall.  Cooked on low 6hrs.

I loved this.  Looking for veggie filled soup!!  I used a whole bag of   okra 12 ounces.  I then used beef broth instead of water like 2 cups of beef bouillon.  I actually had the okra in my freezer and was looking for a way to incorporate the veggie into my diet.  This was easy and good.  I think I overcooked in the crockpot but still it was good.  I am a novice at cooking so fab  for  newbie.

This is a good Recipe- however- I agree with Foxy about the potatoes.  We let it cook on low for 6-8hrs and the potatoes were done then.  Also- we added a package of brown Gravy mix and it was awesome!!

I love this soup.  It is a good base for many others
I made the following changes:  
1) Steamed diced potatoes for 30 minutes before adding
2) Used low-sodium beef broth instead of water
3) Added cumin, garlic powder, and chili powder at the end.

Next time ill add italian spices.

Have to run out and teach a yoga class so this is a perfect healthy meal to leave behind for the family.  I added some spice (chili peppers and McCormicks Steak seasoning). I left out the okra and potatoes. I also cooked it on the stove top because I'm short on time today....still yummy!!
