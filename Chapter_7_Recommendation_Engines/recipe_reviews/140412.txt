This recipe is nothing like the fatayer filing i make. PEPPER..needs PEPPER..lots of it..freshly ground black and some cayenne... lemon juice, sumac, olive oil...the spinach must be DRY ( I use frozen chopped and squeeze out ALL of the water once it is defrosted )...and more salt...( the dough sucks out the flavouring so the filling must almost be over flavoured for the end result to have any flavour !!! must taste too spicy, too lemony, too olive oily to oniony before you put in the pockets and you willhave perfect end result fatayer

The dough is wonderful, but I agree with the other reviewer, the filling was a little bland. I added sumac to taste and a little salt. Thanks for the recipe!

The spinach was pretty bland.  I used frozen, so that might be the problem.  Using frozen roll dough would cut down on the work.  This recipe was just okay for me.
