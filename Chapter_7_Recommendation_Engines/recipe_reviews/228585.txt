This was excellent! Sweet and savory with warm, gooey blueberry bursts. I only made a few changes. Subbed brown sugar for white, cut the salt down a bit and added some vanilla. I used home-frozen blueberries and thawed them overnight in the refrigerator. 

I also baked them as muffins, which the recipe is perfectly suited for. I put them in at 375 for 20 minutes and they came out perfect. Made 14 muffins.

The way I would describe this is a cross between a blueberry muffin and sweet Southern cornbread, with the cornbread flavor dominating.  It was very moist, a little crumbly, and the fresh blueberries burst with sweetness.  I found it a little salty, so next time, I'll cut it to 1/2 tsp.  This is definitely "outside the box," but we enjoyed it.

The first time I made this I used an 8x8 inch pan.  The second time I read the recipe all the way through and used the recommended 9x9 inch pan.  I wasn't as impressed with the outcome using the 9x9 pan.  I've made this two more times, using an 8x8 pan and the cornbread comes out so much more cake-like, moist and rich!  I highly recommend using an 8x8 inch pan!

Being British and therefore having no idea what cornmeal was (having only read about it in American children's literature) I had no idea what to think of this recipe when I found it, but I'm SO glad I tried it! The combination of milk and cornmeal adds a whole new dimension of both texture and flavour to the cake (and now I know why you Americans call it 'bread' and not 'cake'... it's much less sweet than a lot of other recipes, good for those with more of a savoury tooth). The only thing I wish I'd done differently was bake it for 35 mins - 30 mins wasn't quite enough: so watch that tooth pick like a hawk!

This was fantastic! I made it exactly according to the directions, and I had to stop myself from eating half the pan. I did use fresh blueberries, which I think makes a difference. Next time I will try it with a little less salt, but I don't want to mess too much with a good thing.

This recipe is perfect and easy to remember. It says to fold the blueberries into the batter but nothing is wrong with mixing/ mashing the berries in the batter. Also, don't cook it until the toothpick comes out completely dry; carry-over cooking will cause the cornbread to overcook if it's not properly timed.

Super easy to make and delicious.  Served it for Mother's Day brunch and everyone loved it.  

Made some modifications based on other reviews and my personal preferences.  Mods:  decreased salt to 1/2 tsp; substituted 1/2 cup oil for 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce and 2 Tbs oil; used frozen berries that I thawed the night before and added berries to flour cornmeal mixture first before adding wet ingredients.  I baked in 8"x8" pan and 30 minutes was fine.

I love the corn and blueberry mixture together. I made muffins out of the recipe. This is an extremely dry muffin, the flavor is good but I would add a little sour cream next time to retain some moisture. When the muffins are hot I butter them and dip the tops in sugar. Also added 3TBL of sugar to the batter.

I was looking for something different and this was it! I used fresh blueberries, substituted 1/4 cup of brown sugar in place of the 1/2 cup regular, and instead of 1/2 cup vegetable oil I used 3 Tbsp of oil and enough applesauce to equal one-half cup. Baked it in a Bundt pan, too. Oh, my!  Had to have two pieces just to make sure it was good. It was!??

This is great for breakfast or just a snack! I added the zest of a small orange and about 3 Tbsp orange juice (use a little less milk). I also used an 8x8 pan lined with parchment and it came out perfect. I would definitely make it again.

Really good cornbread! I cut the salt & sugar in half, used 1/4c applesauce + 1/4c canola oil & added 1 can of Oregon blueberries. Used the can juice + milk to = the 2/3c liquid.  Came out very moist & packed with berries, which I had mixed into the dried ingredients so they would be coated for better suspension throughout the bread. My parrot loves it, too! I will make it again - it's great with morning coffee. It's so moist it doesn't even need butter.

Loved this cornbread, very moist.  My husband does not like cornbread, but kept going back for more. I used brown sugar instead of white, which is the norm for me when I bake bread. I also added 2 teaspoons of vanilla and reduced salt to 1/2 teaspoon. Used a bundt pan since I don't have a 9 inch square pan. Checked the cornbread after 15 minutes and noticed there were cracks in the top, and then lowered the temperature to 350 and continued baking for 18 minutes.  Cooled in bundt pan for 10 minutes before turning out on a plate to cool.  Delicious!

Per the recommendation of others, I made some modifications to this recipe and it turned out dangerously delicious! For the first batch, I just used light brown sugar in place of regular sugar and coconut oil in place of vegetable oil. So yummy!! I literally ate half the pan and had to make a second batch! For the second batch I used light brown sugar in place of regular sugar, used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, used only a pinch of salt, used 2/3 cup of sour cream instead of milk and reduced the baking powder by approximately 2/3 teaspoon and replaced the 2/3 teaspoon with baking soda, and I added 2 teaspoons of vanilla to cut the tang of the sour cream. Baked at 400 for 15 minutes and then reduced to 350 degrees until done. Thank you so much for your recipe!! Both batches were so amazing, they were all gone in less than 48 hours!! ;)

If using frozen berries, drain them first.  My cornbread was green because I added the juice.  While this made the flavor even better, it did look a little strange!

After reading reviews I did use only 1/2 teaspoon salt. I also only used 1 cup blueberries and thought the amount of blueberries was just fine in the final product. I recommend the full 30 min cook time. I did 27 min and it was not fully cooked in the center.

The only change I made was to use 1/4 cup white and 1/4 cup brown sugar and a little vanilla.  Like it alot, but should have used more sugar as the berries weren't very sweet. I would have liked it to be just a little bit sweeter.

I had some extra sour cream, so I increased the eggs to 3, decreased the oil to 1/4 cup and added a cup of sour cream.  Cook an additional 5 minutes.  Very tasty.  Will definitely make this again.

I love this recipe and have always used fresh blueberries and used brown sugar.   Careful not to overlook and keep in Tupperware container so it stays moist.

Great recipe! I changed it a little bit- a stick of melted butter in place of the vegetable oil (not a huge fan of vegetable oil in baked goods) and a snack cup of apple  sauce in place of the eggs. I also put a little bit of brown sugar on top of it before baking it. It turned out moist and sweet and delicious.

My husband is on a gluten free diet so I substituted GF flour for the all purpose flour. Of course this changed the texture. It was slightly more crumbly but still moist and light. Otherwise followed the recipe as written. Been looking for a way to use all the blueberries we are getting from our garden right now.. this is it!

I made this in an 8x8 glass pan and baked for 25 minutes.  I never wait for a fully clean toothpick. It was so moist and altogether perfect! I used 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce and 2T of oil to make it lower in fat. I used fresh blueberries. I also used half of the salt as other people recommended. My boyfriend's southern family was really impressed and absolutely loved it!

I loved this recipe, but did make a minor change.  I wanted a healthier version, so I substituted a combination of mashed (cooked) sweet potato and sour cream for all of the oil. I'm sure yogurt would work as well.  With the sw. pot./sour cream substitution this was a very moist cornbread.  It took about 23 min. to bake at 400 degrees.

Don't change a thing it is perfect. It took more to wrap my head around blueberries in cornbread then it did to give this a 5 star. Moist, not as dry as most cornbread. Don't need anything on it either, but butter is always good. No need for syrup or honey like other cornbread.

I changed nothing, and loved it.  It stays fresh if covered for at least three days.  I did make it separately without blueberries, and found that the cornbread itself was the best recipe I've ever tasted for cornbread.  It was great with butter when fresh and hot, and yummy as johnnycake with milk and sugar, too.  This is a real winner, and easy to make, too.

Incredibly easy,  simple and amazing!  Never thought of putting blueberries in my cornbread but it works!  Three thumbs up from my family.  Sometimes the simple and few ingredients are the best!  Thank you for great recipe!

My family and I loved this. The blueberries make the cornbread more of a breakfast treat than a dinner carb - but  that didn't seem to stop us from finishing the pan!

I was really hoping to love this recipe, after reading all of the great reviews.

I followed the suggestions of substituting the applesauce  and using an 8x8 pan.

After baking the bread for an extra 10 minutes, the bread was raw in the middle.

Perhaps someone can shed some light on what may have gone wrong?

I made this on Memorial Day to go along with ribs, potato salad and greens - and oh my goodness, it was perfect! My husband and adult daughters loved it!  I generally make a quick corn bread with the  "Jiffy" mixes, but this will definitely be a regular on my dinner table!  It was simple, quick and delicious! Thanks so much for sharing!

For my first foray into cornbread, this turned out wonderfully. I didn't have baking powder (or cream of tartar to substitute) but I believe the cornmeal mix I used already had it in as the basic recipe with it didn't call for baking powder. Still turned out moist and fluffy.

Oh my goodness! This was delicious. Not too sweet and had a wonderful texture. I will be making this again very soon. This would be good for dessert with ice cream, for breakfast, brunch, or a snack. I made this as is. The only change for next time will be to double the recipe.

This was a berry wonderful sweet addition to the regular cornbread! My husband almost ate it all (he saved a piece for me) will most definitely keep this one! I want to try with strawberries as well and see how it turns out.....!?!?!

Very good recipe.  Nice combination with the cornmeal crunch.  I like my bread cake a little sweeter which is the only reason it was not a 5..., but this was delicious for sure and would recommend you try this.

Directions had the wrong timing. It looks so delicious but it was disappointing to find out that 30 minutes wasn't enough.  I wish I'd done differently was bake it for 35 mins - 30 mins wasn't quite enough: so watch that tooth pick like a hawk!

I've made twice, both times with splenda and once cutting salt.  Do cut salt to 1/2 tsp.  The batter was quite dry & I resisted the temptation to add more liquid before baking.  It worked out fine without it.  Needless to say there is a reason why I made it twice - it is a wonderful and interesting recipe.
