I just wanted to note that my original recipe called for Montreal Steak Spice which has a lot more flavor and depth than regular steak seasoning salts.  If you do not have this seasoning you can make an approximation of it using 2 parts paprika, course grind balck pepper and salt to 1 part garlic powder, onion powder, crushed corriander, dill and crushed red pepper flakes.

This recipe is great!  You can make it with any combination of root veggies; I like to skip rutabagas and new potatoes and add butternut squash and turnips.   Thanks!

I was looking for a decent way to cook my root vegetables and chose this recipe because I thought the combination of veggies and spices sounded good.  I honestly didn't care for it.  The spices together were mediocre and I did not care for the way the rutabagas and parsnips tasted.  I suppose that if you like these vegetables unflavored, you will like this recipe.  I prepare them more heavily spiced.

Great recipe. In contrast to other reviews I found it to be over seasoned, so I guess you need to adjust for your personal taste in that respect.   I also prefer my veggies in bigger rustic chunks so I obviously had to increase the cook time accordingly. One little tip I have is to add a slug of maple syrup when there's 10-15 mins left... adds a lovely woodsy caramelised layer of flavor and enhances the sweetness of the roasted veg. Yum! (FYI - I don't use the sweet chilli sauce).

I liked the flavors, but not the texture. I didn't like the rutabega and parsnips--I was hoping to find a good recipe for them, but I'm still looking. I only ate the potatoes and yams--had to throw the rest away.

Fan-freakin'-tastic.  I cut the root veggies thin to be more like chips, this is a definite repeat.

This was great! I had never had parsnips or rutabaga until we went to England for our honeymoon. Since we've been back, I've been wanting to cook them myself. I substituted more of the other veggies since I don't like carrots, and next time I'm omitting the steak seasoning. It was just too much. And I used the Montreal steak seasoning...Other than that, great recipe! Will definitely make again.

These were pretty good.  I did find them a bit too spicy for my palate, and I think it was the extra pepper that did it--the submitter is right, Montreal Steak Seasoning packs a punch, and it has pepper in it already.  I'd leave out the additionl pepper next time.  I don't think I've ever had parsnips or rutabagas, and I have no idea if I like them--didn't find them in the store so I just left them out and put in a red pepper instead.  I also used baby carrots--tossed them in as is, although I really shouldve cut them in half at least since they took the longest to cook.  These veggies are good; just modify the seasonings to taste.  Thanks for the recipe!

My family did not like this.  I can't really blame the recipe though.  I think we just don't like rutabaga.  Also, since I didn't have any sweet red chili sauce so I substituted a small amount of chili oil which is probably totally different.

I cut back on the amount of chili sauce (and would probably omit it altogther next time). The carrots ended up a little burnt so I would probably add them a few minutes after the other veggies next time also. I added a little kosher salt. Very good. Thanks!

I didn't add the parsnips and I added about 3 teaspoons of freshly grated cardamon I served it with steamed asparagus and broculli and homemade whole wheat and molasses bread.  It was wonderful!

My entire family liked this- even the kids. I didn't use the steak seasoning and even used less chili sauce-but the flavor of the vegetables was great. I used more regular potatoes and no rutabagas-so maybe that is why it was so popular.

This was easy to make and excellent. I hate plain veggies and steer clear of Greek restaurants because  I dislike plain baked veggies  like they always serve. These were amazing, great flavor.I did add an onion, quarted and seperated to the mix.  I will definately make these again.

I only did rutabagas, sweet potato and carrots and it was delicious.  
I used savory spices such as thyme, oregano and rosemary with the onion and garlic powder and paprika and old bay.

Skipped the carrots, added a touch of good cinnamon and ginger. Went liberal on the steak sauce and maybe the hot sauce.
Turned out great. A tasty blend of veggies. This recipe is a keeper.

My husband ate almost the entire pan of this!  I only used two tablespoons of sweet chili sauce, but next time I will use more.  My favorite is Mae Ploy sauce. I also didn't used a rounded teaspoon of the steak seasoning.  I used butternut squash instead of rutabaga.  I think the seasoning would work well with any mixture of root veggies.

This is a terrific recipe.  All we have to do is to insert our favorite root vegetable.  Personally, I like leeks, garlic, onion, potatoes, carrots, parsnips, even mushrooms (although you'll need to leave those larger since they'll melt down) as long as you keep the size of the veg similar and density is also important.  sometimes i keep this as is and some time i add a little sugar, honey, chilies, etc.  But this is a terrific go to as your starting point.  don't put a veg in here you don't like.  only use those you like; those in the fridge.  you'll come back time after time.

Yes, I just loved it especially the parsnips that I added.  They were sweet and delicious.  I read the hint about using Montreal Steak Spice which I often use for barbecueing and grilling.  It is a great addition.  Wonderful recipe on cold winter days, but would be fine in warmer weather, also.

A very good recipe for root vegetables, but if you don't like rutabagas or parsnips or carrots, it is better to leave them out and go with what you like. My personal preference was to substitute acorn squash for rutabaga.  I also found that the carrots and parsnips cooked more slowly than the other vegetables, so next time I will try giving them a head start by par boiling them.  Husband thought the spices were a little overwhelming, and I will reduce the punch next time to suit our tastes.

Delicious! I made this as a test run to see if we liked it enough to take to a Thanksgiving dinner. I omitted the extra pepper, onion powder, and rutabaga. My 15-year old son and I could not stop eating it right out of the pan. It's a winner!

I scaled this down to 4 servings, and it fit perfectly in my 9x13 foil-lined pan. I didn't have rutabaga but used 2 carrots and also a med-sized quartered onion that I know goes good in a dish like this. Per a reviewer's comments, I skipped the black pepper because the Montreal Steak seasoning had it in it; I like spicy but I thought it would be too much for me. Added a little salt (the seasoning was low-sodium) since I thought it would benefit the dish. After the second 20-min bake, my carrots were still a little hard. I kept it in for an addt'l 6 min which also gave the veggies more browning (esp the potatoes). Thanks for a delicious and healthy recipe!

The turnips should have been put in the microwave for a few minutes before baking. They were still pretty hard.

I made it exactly as the recipe stated except that I just about doubled the root veggies, oil & chili sauce (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/237906/homemade-chili-sauce/ - super!) for my large crew. There are 9 of us! Rutabagas & parsnips are new flavors for us. Chopping the veggies is the longest part of preparation. The colors in this dish are fantastic! The aroma was making us all anxious for dinner tonight & the taste did not disappoint. Everyone loved it & most were going back for seconds & thirds! It's definitely a winner in our house!
