I followed the recipe, exactly (or so I thought)! I had all the ingredients, and as I sat back enjoying the smoothie I looked on the counter at my lonely clementine orange. Minus the hiccup I caused this smoothie is good (and will probably be better with the orange!). If you're not fond of protein powder you'll probably not like this beverage, because it is detectable. Overall this is a lovely smoothie!

This is "The Smoothie" recipe to keep because it is great as-is but it's also so versatile! Make it as is and you will have a tasty and super nutritional drink to start your day and get you through to lunch. Keep the chia and flax seeds in easy pour containers in the fridge and you're golden on adding the super -food ingredients so quickly. The beauty of this recipe is that it is really versatile and you can substitute what ever fruits and powders you prefer....I like to up the ante with a high quality protein powder like VEGA which is no-gluten and no sugar added. I love the frozen berry option (fast) and frozen banana to add a mellow flavor. When I'm craving the taste of PB&J I add a scoop of PB powder (all the flavor with less calories).  Love this solid go-to recipe every day !

This recipe is really versatile.  I often swap the almond milk for 1 cup of plain yogurt and add in (or replace) the orange with 1 cup of raspberries and/or strawberries.  I have this  smoothie every morning for breakfast and feel great! The chia and flax make it extra healthy and help fill me up.  I keep both my chia and flax in the freezer to maintain freshness.
