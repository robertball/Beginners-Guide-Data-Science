Update:  I made a double batch of these (to freeze for later use), and baked them on a lightly oiled baking sheet.  400 degree oven, turning once after 12 - 15 minutes then baking an additional 12-15 minutes.  The results were great.  Less oil absorbed than with pan frying, and the "crab" cakes came out crispy and golden, with a lot less mess and work.  I've also made this with the commercial Italian Bread Crumbs.  The flavor was out of this world!  Outstanding!  These make a wonderful vegetarian dinner when served with sliced tomatoes (topped with a dab of mayo) and fresh corn on the cob.  These were so good that I make them at least once a week during the summer.  I followed the suggestions of others, by lightly salting and draining the shredded zucchini before combining with the other ingrediants.  The butter gives it a rich decadent taste!

I live in Maryland, and these definitely do not taste like a real crab cake, although they did remind me somewhat of the frozen grocery store kind.  A reasonable facsimile for vegetarians.  Due to previous complaints of sogginess, I squeezed the zucchini after grating it, and used commercial dried (canned) bread crumbs because they are denser than fresh bread crumbs (the recipe didn't specify which type to use).  Also, "seasoned" bread crumbs were noted in the body, although seasoned was not specified in the ingredients list, which caused some confusion.  As a Maryland crab cake afficionado, I would not recommend you use seasoned bread crumbs as the seasonings would detract from the Old Bay.  I'll make these again, but next time I will increase the dried bread crumbs to  1 1/8 cups to help counteract the sogginess and increase the Old Bay to 1 1/2 tsp. to enhance the flavor.

This is an update from my last review of this recipe. This time I took the advice from Roger who reviewed a spinach recipe and suggested using a potato ricer to squeeze out the water from the spinach. I tried his idea with the zucchini and I can't tell you how well it worked. For those who are commenting on the saltiness of the Old Bay (which I agree with), there are several copy cat recipes out there which would enable you to control the sodium. I did take the advice from other reviewers and added an extra tsp. of "Old Bay Seasoning". I also added some garlic and onion powder and some black pepper along with a little cayenne. Yes, they are a tad bit difficult to handle, but if you flour your hands and LIGHTLY roll them into a ball and then pat them into a patty, it's not too bad. I used a Fry Daddy which made the job very quick and easy without the cakes tasting too heavy or greasy. Thanks Patti and Connie too!!!!

These were very good.  I worried about the zucchini being too watery, so I shredded it into a collander and added about 1/2 tsp. of salt.  I let it drain for about 30 minutes (pressing slightly with wooden spoon)...yielding about 2/3 cup water.  I will definitely make these again.

This one gets RAVE Reviews!!!! 
I have made this recipe 5 times in the last 2 weeks.  I modified it slightly in that I used 1 large zucchini and 1 large potato.  I made sure I squeezed all of the liquid from these in order to insure an easier mixture to work with.  
Instead of coating with flour, I used the Japanese bread crumbs and coated each side and fried them.  I have made them ahead but coated them with the bread crumbs just 
before frying.  That way they don't get soggy. 
I left the melted butter out the second time and I didn't see any difference.  
This is certainly a great recipe.  My daughter and I love them and I would serve them as a side dish for company!!!! You must try these.

This is the best zucchini pattie recipe I've ever tried.  I used 1 more egg to substitute for butter.  Also I didn't have Old Bay Seasoning at hand so I used a combination of black pepper, mustard, minced celery, nutmeg, ground cloves, cayenne pepper, paprika and ginger (I tried to imitate Old Bay Seasoning as much as I could) and the result was just fantastic!  Thanks Connie!!

A very good side dish, though not much of a vegetable dish. You will definitely want to "drain" the zucchini. I spread mine to a thin layer on parchment paper, cover with paper towels, sprinkle a little salt, and use a rolling pin to press out the water. Repeat this process several times and you won't regret it. It does use a fair amount of paper towels, though.

I use Emeril's Essence instead of Old Bay Seasoning and it tasted wonderful.

Add the bread crumbs gradually. It is easy to add too much even at the given amount. This results in a finished product that tastes like stuffing and is very dry. Enough bread crumbs have been added when the mixture just barely holds together when flattened into a patty. Bon Apetit.

Great recipe!  I've made this a few times and found that the small to medium zucchini works best.  I drained and squeezed out zucchini, added more Old Bay and froze patties before cooking.  Freezing makes them easier to handle and you can cook as many or as little as you want.

These are absolutely incredible!  They are a bit messy to make and I drained the zucchini all day with a weight on top.  But, they are so incredibily delicious that I did not mind the mess one bit.  Here's a little tip: if your mix is really wet then form the patty in your hand, sprinkle flour on one side, pat it in then turn over and do the same thing on the other side.  Then kind of gently toss in the pan.  I had no trouble as long as I rinsed my hands after every couple of patties.  My husband  does not like squash and he scarfed these right down.  They are incredibly tasty!

I'm not a big fan on "crab" anything, but loved the taste in these babies.  They really are delicious. We live near the Chesapeake Bay and my husband enjoys crab cakes when we go to certain restaurants.  I made these for him and he was really impressed. I couldn't believe he ate more than one.  He really likes Old Bay and I guess that's what did the trick for him.  I strongly suggest you squeeze the zuchinni completly dry with paper towels before you attempt this recipe, otherwise you may have some issues.  Other than that, it's perfect as is.  Thanks Patti Jo

I wish I video taped my meat eating brother in-law's face when he tried these. It was like christmas morning. I sqeezed the cr*p out of the zucchini with paper towels, dredged them in panko bread crumbs instead of flour and baked them at 400 degrees F, 12 min on each side per another reviewer. I've made them like, a gillion times. Sooooo awesome!

I just made these. However, I also needed to change the recipe. I used panko crumbs as well. I also added salt, pepper, cayenne, garlic power, dried mustard and I probably increased the Old Bay by at least 2-1/2 times. I also didn't use the flour, and I opted to bake at 400 w/ a little olive oil. I'm giving it a 3/5 because without the extra ingredients I think it would be on the bland side. My mother really enjoyed my version and I will be making her more to store in the freezer.

Excellent!  I didn't change the ingredients at all (and didn't press out the zucchini after grating, either).  I didn't flour, but baked on a cookie sheet (13 minutes at 400, flip and 10 minutes at 400).  

Perfect, and it was wonderful.  I can see making these regularly!  Comes to 4 WW points+ each (18 points for 5), but well worth it.  

Thank you!!!

Excellent! We've made them twice so far in the last few days and can't get enough.  We get vegetables from our garden and a local co-op, and we've had a lot of zucchini of late that we needed to try something new.  Thankfully I found this on here!  To change things up, we made a batch with grated carrots mixed in and another one with equal parts grated yellow squash and zucchini, along with  chipotle powder, chopped onions, garlic scapes, and even a grated radish.  We made them for guests and had them topped with tartar sauce... our guests gobbled them right up!  A great recipe as is, and even better when you find other combinations that work well when you want to change it up.  Looking forward to trying these leftovers topped with an egg in the morning!

Hubs had one of these.  I had four of 'em. He SAID
 he liked them, but actions speak louder than words.  I had four of them.  They were awesome good.  Didn't taste even remotely close to crab cakes, but boy they sure were delicious.  I added some fresh minced garlic and that was a good thing - it added a burst of flavor these might have been lacking otherwise.  Awesome. I'll be dreaming about these.

I always wonder why all you good cooks don't peel the zucchini? Who  has ever seen bright green flecks in a Maryland crab cake? It's a very nice recipe.  To the reviewers who said it didn't taste like crab. Well, when they made it, they KNEW it wasn't crab! It is good for vegetarians, those with zucchini-filled gardens, as well as for transplanted Marylanders, who cannot get the real thing. Plus--it tastes good!  No other excuse for making it is needed.

These are fantastic!  I've served them as a main course as well as making them smaller and serving as appetizers.   I don't use any butter and don't miss it.  I do put salt on the grated zucchini and after letting it sit awhile I press as much as the liquid out as possible.  I make them an hour or so ahead of the meal and put them in the fridge to chill.  Then I take them out and rather than using flour I use Panko crumbs.  They turn out crispy and delicious.

I have been meaning to try this recipe for years, and am glad I finally did.  Had a $12 crab cake sandwich earlier the same day that wasn't half as good as these were.  Do as others have recommended; increase Old Bay, add garlic of some sort, and salt and squeeze your zucchini.  We followed the recipe and fried them this time.  Served with a remoulade-ish sauce.  Much heartier than expected and very inexpensive.

I'm glad I read comments from other reviewers before making this!  I also made sure to drain all of the liquid from the zucchini before adding the other ingredients.  
I fiddled with the original recipe a little. I added 1 potato, shredded, as well as some additional Old Bay.  Freshly ground pepper seemed to really give it some "oomph."  I found that the addition of instant potato flakes (about 1/4 c.) really helped keep it from being too soggy.  I dusted with Japanese panko to coat the outside.  They were really good this way.  I'd make it again!

Oh wow, absolutely the best Vegetarian recipe I've cooked so far. I will use this recipe again. I baked them at 400 for about 15 minutes, then 400 on the other side for 15 minutes.I then turned the oven on broil, browned them a bit,then flipped them over,and browned them.I used 2 teaspoons of Bay's in the mix,and squeezed the Zuchinni several times before baking.   I used Italian bread crumbs.Broiling them totally makes them appear fried.

Hey guys, make sure you are using SEASONED bread crumbs. It doesn't say that in the ingredient list, but does say it in the directions. With this it turns out AMAZING!!!

great!  change the spices for different taste.   add fresh ginger, cilantro, cumin, and garam masala for zucchini samosas.  or try cinnamon, nutmeg and brown sugar for zucchini "cookies", my kids love them.  i bake with a spray of pam on each side.

YUMMO!!! I'm making these for the 2nd time this week at the request of my husband.  I found this recipe when I was looking for ways to use the massive amount of zucchini growing in my garden, and this is surely a hit.  I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and salted the zucchini and let it sit in a colander for 30-45 minutes after shredding it in the food processor.  I added a bit of crushed garlic and increased the old bay a bit.  I also used packaged seasoned bread crumbs, and the consistency was perfect.  I skipped the flour altogether and baked the cakes.  I sprayed a foil lined baking sheet with butter flavored cooking spray, and then sprayed the tops of the cakes too.  The first time I cooked them at 400 degrees along with a roasting chicken and 15 minutes per side was perfect.  However, this time they are in the oven alone and they stuck a bit, so I will reduce the heat/time next time around.  Although these won't replace crab cakes for us (we're big seafood eaters), these zucchini cakes have certainly earned a place on my Meatless Monday rotation.

Really good and you would never know it wasn't a crab cake - except it needs more Old Bay Seasoning.  I used canola oil so as not to add other flavors, kept my gas flame closer to medium so they would get done through.  After putting cocktail sauce on it, you would not know the difference, except for needing more Old Bay.  My husband loves this recipe and since he grows an abundance of zucchini and loves the stuff.  I have a real winner here!  Good job!  4 stars because of the seasoning. I  might add a bit of salt and pepper too...

These tasted very good!  the zucchini DEFINITELY needs to be drained first!  i am SO glad i read the reviews that suggested to do that!  I shredded them and salted them and put them in a colander for about an hour and then pressed with a wooden spoon...got almost a CUP of water!  I fried half of them and baked the other half.  we definitely preferred the baked ones.  will for sure make again though!

Very tasty for a vegitarian dish.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and baked these on a greased baking sheet for 12 mins on each side and they turned out very well (sometimes you do have to make small compromise to taste for health!)  My husband who only eats Kosher and has never tasted crab loved them and even my 2 year old gobbled them up and said "more?"  I used Italian breadcrumbs because that was what I had on hand and served with mayo with fresh chopped parsely mixed in.  Next time I might up the Old Bay Seasoning by 1/2 teaspoon.

Easy, satisfying recipe.  I doubled the Old Bay,  used panko instead of traditional bread crumbs and salted/pressed the zucchini before making the patties.  I tried both the baking as another reviewer suggested (400* for 12 min, flipping, bake another 10 min) and frying as written-- there's no comparison.  If you're going to eat something breaded, you might as well fry it and enjoy it as it's meant to be.  :)

This is a great recipe.  The really do taste like crab.  While I liked them alot, I think the smooth texture the flour dredge gives them is not as nice as a bread-crumb dredge... but that's just my opinion!  They were still great!!!

Delicious! I've tried this two ways. First, I salted and shredded the zucchini the day ahead and let it sit in a strainer overnight before squeezing out and making the recipe. The second time, I salted and shredded the zucchini, squeezed them out after about 30 mins and made the patties right away. I recommend this second way. Easier, and I only had to use 2 zucchini instead of 3. Very yummy, I increase the Old Bay seasoning to 2 tsp, add 1 tsp dry mustard (or dijon), 2 minced cloves of garlic, 1 tbsp dried parsley, 1/4 tsp dried dill weed, and bake at 400 degrees on each side for about 15 minutes. I put bread crumbs on both sides and spray with cooking spray right before putting them in the oven. Served with tartar sauce, this will definitely be a regular. **Update: I've also put approx 1/4 cup scoops rolled in bread crumbs into muffin tins and baked for 45 mins at 350 degrees. When ready, dip in chipotle ranch or a lemony hollandaise. Yum!

Just finished baking a batch of these and I must say, they are very good.  There is no confusing these with actual crab cakes but with that said I think they hold their own quite nicely.  Grated the zucchini w/Kitchenaid FP then squeezed out the add'l mositure.  After mixing all ingredients,  I used  panko crumbs mixed w/flour and 'breaded' each patty, misted both sides w/canola oil then baked at 450 15 mins, flipped & baked another 15. Served with fresh cob corn and remoulade sauce.  Great way to use up those oversized Zucchinis.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was very good. I added a can of real crab meat for the protein. I also added more bread crumbs and more old bay as mentioned. I also cooked smaller patties to help keep the crispiness... but real crab cakes are mooshy on the inside and crispy on the outside... I then made a sauce to eat with them with a couple big spoonfuls of mayo, some roasted red pepper and cayenne pepper to taste. blended it all up in the processor. it was tasty the next day on toasted bread with the sauce and lettuce and tomato and a little avocado. I reheated in the toaster oven to maintain the crunch.

These were delicious and much more flavourful than I expected. They were also very easy to make. I grated 2 relatively large zucchinis and drained them as recommended. I did not fry them in oil but instead just grilled the patties on my pancake griddle. They came out perfect!

I fooled my family with this recipe. I baked them in the oven instead of frying them. A little oil on a baking sheet, and drizzled a little oil over them. In the oven for 30 mins. I have made them 4 times this summer already. Great.

Very good!  They don't taste anything like a real crabcake (coming from a girl who is born & bred in B'more), but they are very good.  I used red onions & added an extra dash of my Old Bay.  I didn't dredge them in flour (unnecessary calories to me).  I fried a couple in olive oil, which was just too good.  Then I baked the rest in the oven (again...calories) for 20 minutes at 350.  I then flipped them over & broiled them a few more minutes.  Next time I think I will try just broiling them for 10 minutes on each side.  A very worthwhile recipe!  Thanks!

This recipe was wonderful! I only wished I had found this when I had more zucchini left in my garden.  I did double the amount of Old Bay seasoning, and also added 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper.  I topped the patties with a mustard cream sauce which I also found on this site, which was also wonderful. I did find that the zucchini has to be squeezed very dry in order to form patties.  I squeezed by hand and then put the zucchini between paper towel and squeezed some more to absorb the rest of the moisture.

Had the great flavor of a crab cake .  Added panko crumbs and an extra teaspoon of Old bay.  Served with a mayo-dijon dip.  Was fantastic and loved by my zucchini-hating husband!

After reading the reviews I added extra Old Bay, a large garlic bulb minced, salt & pepper, and 3 chopped green onions in place of the reg. onions. I mixed the ingredients in a bowl, covered the bowl and put it in the frig. for 2 hours before frying. The flavor was terrific.

These were very good.  A lot of layers of flavor here (I used a tad bit more spice than what was called for).  I followed other people's advice and "squeezed" the water out of the zucchini between two papertowels.  Be careful not to overcook them!

I've made this recipe MANY times and keep making it to prove to myself that it's NOT really CRAB.  The melted butter makes it rich enuf that it compares equally to those cakes I once had at Cape May.  A VERY filling meal.  A salad besides is enuf.  NOTE:  make sure your Old Bay is NOT past shelf life.

AMAZING!!!   I added celery, poblano pepper, and garlic to the onions while sauteeing.   I did squeeze the excess water from the shredded zucchini as others have suggested-  there was a lot of it, so I highly recommend doing so.  I added some parmesan cheese to the final mixture and added more Old Bay than called for, also as others have suggested.  I put the final mixture in the refrigerator for about an hour which helped it firm up a little more before I used it.  
I did not form the mixture into patties, but rather stuffed it into large portabello mushroom caps and baked at 350 for about 20 minutes and  finished with a quick broil to brown the top.    This was unbelievably yummy... I mean  REALLY really good.   This is something I'm going to make time and time again and will be sharing the recipe with others.   Thank you Connie! !

Sorry Connie, I just did not like this recipe at all.I did not change one thing in your recipe and it was very bland tasting to me and my wife. I will stick to my artifical crab meat for my crab cakes, they are pretty good.

Not exactly crab cakes, though along the same lines, and a great way to use up all that summer zucchini! I heeded other reviewers' warning about the zucchini being too wet, so after grating, put mine on a paper towel, covered with another, and pressed down to remove excess moisture. Also used 2/3 zucchini and 1/3 grated baked potato (because I had one on hand) and liked the texture lent by the potato. Used commercial bread crumbs, and had no problem with the "cakes" holding together. Added some garlic powder and fresh lemon peel before mixing.  Cooked in canola oil, not butter. Delicious!

These are so fantastic!!  I have been making them for years, just never reviewed them before.  My husband literally jumps with joy when I say I will make them. They are easy and so amazingly awesome they melt in your mouth and the taste is out of this world.  I would give it 10 stars if that was an option.

Wow!!! I will be making these again and again. They will not replace my crab cake recipe, because it is the best in the whole world, but these are great!! I will share my crab cake sauce with you. It is tasty with this recipe too. Mix 1 cup mayonnaise, 2-4 teaspoons chili garlic sauce (found in Asian food section of market), and 1 ½ tsp fresh lemon juice. Cover and refrigerate as you prepare your cakes. I use 2 teaspoons of the chili garlic sauce, but use more if you want more heat. Oh…I used Italian style bread crumbs in the zucchini cakes and they turned out great.

Surprisingly good.  The old bay does give the cakes a flavor similar to one aspect (the spice) of crab cakes.  Following the advice of other reviews, I pressed the grated zucchini dry (with lots of paper towels) before adding them to the egg and butter mixture.Incidentally, I saved some of the egg-zucchini-etc mixture for the next day but apparently it sweated some in the fridge overnight and this sogginess made the cakes hard to keep together and not taste as good.  So make all the cakes at once (and press the zucchini dry too).

Good. I made these twice---once fried and once baked. Saved lots of calories by baking and I thought it was actually better. I used bread crumbs instead of flour to dust the pattys.

I read a lot of the reviews so I added extra Old Bay.  These did not taste like crab cakes!  They tasted like OK zucchini cakes.  Add some crab to the zucchini and they might work.

Really yummy, but pretty greasy. If I could go back, I would make a big arugula salad with a light dressing as a side to balance it out!

As a lover of crab cakes, I had doubts about a zucchini cake being similar, but this recipe was a pleasant surprise. I omitted onion since I'm not a huge fan of them, and added more old bay seasoning as suggested in other posts. They turned out perfect and stayed together nicely.

My husband absolutely loved them. I took other raters advice and drained/pressed the zucchini as well as baking them in my convection oven on a cookie sheet. They browned nicely. I grated the onion and increased the Old Bay to 1.5 tsp. I did not coat the patties in flour before baking. I will make them again for sure.

I opted to bake mine instead of frying them.  And I added red bell peppers because I like these in my crab cakes.  They do not need to be dredged in flour if you are planning on baking them.  I made 4 at first--two with flour two without.  And the without were much better.  Also before I made the rest I reduced the size to more of a large potato chip than a small hamburger patty and I preferred these much better.

We didn't want to fry them so we followed MANDT2's comment.  I actually don't love regular crab cakes... too mushy.  I thought these were really great.  Made a creamy legume soup to go with.  Excellent veg dinner.  If you salt and squeeze out water watch the overall salt level since Old Bay has a lot of salt.  Next time we plan to find a recipe for lower salt Old Bay and add more seasoning.

Excellent! Like others have commented, I used a potato ricer to squeeze out excess water in the zucchini, then set on paper towel. Perfect texture!  Made a quick aioli sauce to dip - yum!

These didn't taste like crab at all to me but they were still tasty. I didn't have trouble with too much water or them being soggy at all. I did use zucchini out of my yard that was gigantic, more like a winter squash really and dried inside. Maybe that was why they were not soggy. I rubbed oil on my hands before I dredged them in flour. I also baked mine at 400 for 10 minutes on each side. Great with chili paste!

What a good way to use a lot of zucchini! I substitute plain oats for the seasoned bread crumbs, double the seasoning, and fry on a non-stick griddle. I use the butter on the griddle rather than in the batter. Good variations: 1) add semi-mashed pinto beans, 2) substitute 1 T. sugar and 1 t. cinnamon for the recipe seasoning.

If you are expecting these to taste like a Maryland crab cake, you will be disappointed.  If you are looking for a delicious way to make use of summer's bounty, you will be rewarded with this recipe. Served with grilled corn and a tomato casserole they made for a delicious vegetarian meal.  I did drain the zucchini well after shredding and had no issues handling them. I used a non-stick skillet and fried them in just a couple of Tablespoons of olive oil. Very Good! Additonal comments:  These were wonderful reheated under the broiler and are delicious with an egg for brunch.

WONDERFUL!!  What a great way to "use up" all of that Zucchini.  I did modify a bit.  Used 2-3/4 c. zucchini and put it in a dish cloth and "rung it out".  Used 1-1/3 c. ITALIAN bread crumbs and instead of dredging in flour, I used PANKO bread crumbs.  YUM-O  You'll find PANKO in the oriental section of your grocery store.  Fried in Canola.  Served with cocktail sauce.  DELICIOUS!!

These are fantastic! As a vegetarian in Baltimore, let me just say that I don't care if they taste just like crab or not: they taste delicious and took care of my crab cravings! I did add a bit more Old Bay and onion than the recipe called for, and used unsalted butter to counteract the sodium in the seasoning. I also salted the zucchini as others suggested. After salting and letting it sit for about 20 minutes, I put it in a fine mesh strainer, rinsed off the salt, and pressed the liquids out - it reminded me of draining frozen spinach. Used bought seasoned breadcrumbs and didn't have any problem making patties. Next time I'll try broiling them. THANK YOU Connie! YUM!

I was looking for something to do with the abundance of zucchini this time of year when I came across this recipe.  I love crab cakes, but my husband is allergic to shellfish, so I thought this would be a great way for us to both enjoy a dish.  We did both LOVE them...but I agree with others that they are more reminiscent of a potato pancake than a crab cake.  I even made the last few way smaller and flatter, and we really enjoyed them that way.  Will definitely make again as a small flat pancake.  Thanks so much for this recipe.  yum!

Wow! I admit I was VERY skeptical when reading this recipe, but was I ever pleasantly surprised. They really do taste like crab cakes. I squeezed ALL the liquid from the grated zucchini, then drained it in a wire collander for a couple hours(if you don't get all the liquid out, the mix will be WAY too soupy). The patties were still sticky, and messy to work with, but it is worth it! I've made this several times now, and I've figured out a few things; get all the water out of the zucchini, add more bread crumbs, lose the butter, and the Old Bay Seasoning really makes this recipe. Ohh, and use EVOO, it makes a big difference also. :) Yum!!

This is the absolute best thing to do when you dont want to spend the money on crab meat.  Anyone who did not rate this 5 stars did not follow the recipe or just dont like zucchini.
Great way to get your kids to eat thier veggies!

this was allright, with a few modifications. i used chopped green onion in place of minced regular onion, whole wheat bread & after shredding the zucchini, i pressed as much water out as possible. i then formed my patties, and placed on wax paper in the freezer for 10 minutes so they would hold together better while cooking. i also used a lot less oil.

I've been making this recipe for a couple years now. We LOVE it! I always have to make a double batch because my 5yo devours them!! I do squeeze out the extra juice after shredding the zucchini and put the patties in the freezer just till almost frozen...I think they cook up much better that way. Thank you! It is  KEEPER for us!

I tried this and I adored it! I'm vegetarian, but no one else in my family is. They typically don't like if I cook vegetarian versions of dishes, however, this recipe, they all loved! The flavor was exquisite. I followed the recommendations and drained the zucchini first. I also added a little more of the seasoning than stated. I used Italian bread crumbs because they were all I had, but they worked great! This recipe is lovely and I will definitely make it again!

Absolutely delicious!  This was our weekly "Meatless Monday" dinner and it turned out very well. As a tweaker, I did some things differently, as I wanted my zucchini cakes to turn out more like Ruby Tuesday's mini zucchini sliders. I added roughly 1/4 c of diced (jarred) roasted sweet red peppers as well as a handful of feta cheese, breaking up some of the bigger chunks. I was in a hurry and could've done a better job squeezing out my zucchini, as the "batter" was a tad too wet to actually form into patties when I started the first one. Improvising, I added more breadcrumbs, and I also threw in some Panko as well. Perfect! I loved the addition of the Old Bay...they actually tasted like crab cakes to this Midwestern girl! I added my usual garlic/onion powders to taste, some black pepper, and subbed mayo for the melted butter. I fried them in garlic-infused olive oil (used just enough to coat bottom of my skillet.) Served with sweet potato fries and sliced avacado, my husband, and even my 4 year-old daughter, cleaned their plates. Thanks to the extra zucchini from my MIL, I'll be making these little beauties again this week. Next time, I'd like to do the slider version on some sweet rolls with butter lettuce and tomato. *Drool*

Only change I made was I baked them instead of frying (did not dredge in flour, just brushed one side with a little olive oil as previously suggested).  Just be sure to spray your baking sheet so they don't stick.  I flipped them mid way so they were nice and crispy on both sides.  These were delicious!

I thought this recipe was excellent.  My husband loved it and wants to know already when I will be making it again.  I followed some other suggestions such as putting the zucchini into a collander to drain the moisture out, adding a little extra old bay seasoning (about 1/2t more), and a few dashes of garlic powder.  This was delicious.

Not sure they taste like crab, but they were a big hit at dinner tonight.  I took another's suggestion and baked them on a lightly oiled cookie sheet at 450 for 12-15 minutes each side.  I served with cocktail sauce (homemade) and a corn/blackbean salsa.  Great dinner.  Thanks!

My aunt had me try these without using the word 'crab' cake. Good thing too because I hate seafood and I probably would never have tried them. They are the absolute yummiest thing ever and you'd better plan on making a double batch because they will be gone in a flash. They're also great reheated the next day.

Very good cakes. I fried them but I think next time I may bake them as recommended by another reviewer. I also really squeezed the water out but probably could have done it even more since the inside was very soft even though the outside was crisp. Will definitely make these again.

I WISH THERE WERE A BILLION STARS because this is that good. As a new vegetarian, I was looking for something simple to make as a meat substitute. I had all the plans for side dishes in the works and, when I stumbled on this, it was love at first sight.. and later.. love at first bite. This recipe is perfect and delicious. I followed it completely and only added some salt and pepper on the zucchini before I mixed it with all the goodies. It tastes amazing and much better and more compassionate than crab cakes. Everyone loved them and they were so easy! These "crab" cakes left all of us very un-crabby and that's the way we want to stay!

No one here to eat these but me, but I declare them delicious. ( adapted them to make them gluten free.) I'm excited about making them again soon!

We loved these.  I accidentally put the dredging flour in the recipe the first time, and didn't the second.  I actually liked the accident ones better - they stuck together better and tasted better.

These were pretty good.  I used them as a main dish for a meatless meal, and they were excellent dipped in Ranch Dressing.

I made these exactly to the instructions, but baked them instead of frying.  They were a bit dry and could have used a sauce on them.  But all in all, very good!!!

I made these for my friend's engagement party and they almost never made it out to the guests. I found a group of people around the plate in the kitchen wondering if they should just eat them all themselves and not pass them around to the rest of the party.

I am not sure that I would go so far as to believe for a moment that these could as good as my crab cakes but they are exceptional none the less!  My daughter doesn't eat eggs, and these work fine without them.  I also made them with just spray oil to the pan to reduce the fat.  No problem. I made extra to take to lunch this week with some homemade gazpacho too.  Really good combo, and good for you too

baked these like someone else suggested -- 400 degrees and 14 minutes on each side.  doubled the old bay and added an egg.  also realized i forgot the onion as i was popping in the oven so sprinkled some minced onion on the top.  husband gave it "10 stars out of 11."  i think i would've preferred it as written (with less spice).  great base recipe though, will use again.
**UPDATE had some fresh corn to use up and tried it in this recipe -- needed 3 total eggs and was touch and go for a whlie, but stuck together and came out great.  this is now my go-to veggie patty recipe.

AWESOME!!! I can't wait to make these again. I did salt the zucchini and let it drain in the colander for about a 1/2 hour. I unfortunately didn't have old bay seasoning so I used italian bread crumbs and seasoned with a little salt. Wonderful recipe!

As a "mock crab cake" I give this a 1 star.  As a Fried Zucchini Cakes... I give it 4 stars.  Very tasty BUT ...taste nothing like a crab cake except for the "Old Bay"  that is used in Fish and Crab cakes.  Living in New England a crab cake is not a crab cake unless it has that "fishy tast" which these do not.  So if your looking for a crab cake use crab.  If you have fresh Zucchini and want to make something different...make these cakes.

Yum! We all loved these! They don't taste like Crab Cakes but the are delicious. I placed shredded zucchini in a colander and sprinkled 1/2 teasp of salt over it and allowed it to drain for a while, then squeezed the remaining moisture out with a clean dish towel. We enjoyed these as a side dish so I made them small and the were perfect. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is great, especially if you bake them like other reviewers suggested so they're all done at the same time and with less fat. I could tell from the amount of zucchini that I would need to double the recipe to feed my family of 4. Doubling it made 12 patties, 3 each, which was the perfect amount. (3 med. zucchini). I just squeezed the zucchini after I grated it. I added the bread crumbs gradually, and ended up not needing all of them. I will make these often as we all enjoyed them!

These are great!  The first time I made these I used Matzo meal as a replacement for the breadcrumbs and its was not very messy at all.  I made these a second time with fresh breadcrumbs and they were much more difficult to handle.  They were still very good though.  I added a bit of cayenne and more Old Bay.  I served these on top of a very simple salad with homemade honey mustard dressing.  I will definitely be making these again, and again.

Maybe I blew it by using italian breadcrumbs ... all I had on hand at the time, but I have never been so disappointed in a recipe.  The reviews were soooo positive!!  Ugh! I was visiting my folk and had just cut the zucchini from the vine and was gungho to "surprise" them with "crab" cakes ... well, I got the surprise cause they all were RIGHT when they told me they would never taste like crab.  At least they tried them ... and my mom, bless her heart saved them saying they were fine to her and she'd have them for her lunch a few days.  Got to love moms!!  I am determined to try these again because of all the positive reviews, but for now, I do recommend sticking to plain bread crumbs for sure ... and definitely squeeze out as much water as you can or  you will have trouble handling the cakes. Thanks for the recipe to try!

This is a great way to get in lots of veggies.  I added shredded carrots and minced garlic and left out the Old Bay.  I tried them fried in oil and baked. For the difference in calories, there was not a huge difference in taste.  I'll bake them from now on.

Absolutely wonderful, and amazingly similar to crabcakes in consistency and flavor!  I took the advice of several other posters and baked them at 400 degrees, rather than frying.  I lightly oiled the baking sheet, and flipped them after about 15 minutes, cooking for an additional 15 minutes.  However, instead of just dredging them in flour - I used a mix of 1 part flour to 2 parts panko, which made them crunchy without the added "powdery" flavor and texture that flour adds.  I also added some fresh ground pepper, about 1/4 cup of parmesan, and doubled the Old Bay amount.  My husband was skeptical, but he happily ate 2 for dinner, and specifically asked for another in his lunch box the next day!  Will definitely make again!

These were excellent!  I used summer squash intead of zucchini and dry cornbread stuffing instead of the breadcrumbs just to use up some things in my pantry.  I added the flour into the mixture instead of dredging it since it was too hard to handle otherwise.  I also added a bit of onion salt and garlic salt to the mixture.  The recipe makes 8-10 small/medium cakes.  YUM!

I LOVED these zucchini cakes. I just made them last night. I read a lot of the reviews and increded the old bay to 2 tsp and the bread crumbs to 1 1/8 C. I doubled the recipe and squeezed (with my hand) as much of the liquid as possible out of the shredded zucchini. I shredded the onion and added a green onion as well. I made the patties and baked the first batch. While they're baking I pan fried using about 1/4 C orr less of oil 5-6 patties. My husband went crazy with the taste. He LOVED it and he is picky. He ate it with cocktail sauce. When the baked ones were ready we ate them too, but we both agreed that the fried ones were WAY better.

These were fabulous!  I combined all the advice on the site and drained the zucchini, doubled the Old Bay and added black and cayenne pepper.  I prefer the healthier option of baking them on an oiled pan at 400.  

For a delicious falafel-esque lunch, try a patty on a pita with tzatziki sauce!

This is one of my favorite recipes.  I was really happy when I found out that you could freeze zucchini so that I could make this in the wintertime,too.  To avoid a soupy consistency, I don't add salt until the patties are in the frying pan as salt will make the zucchini "sweat" otherwise.  The recipe does not call for salt, but I find that a little really helps bring out all of the flavor.

Delicious!! Easy and very tasty. These are a great way to use up zucchini. I dont think they tasted like crab cakes at all. Tasted like zucchini cakes with old bay. Followed the recipe exactely and they came out great as a side dish. Will make again!

Okay...so I didn't have any Old Bay Seasoning, but I really wanted to try this recipe. I added one dash of the following spices to the mixture instead: papricka, cinnamon, black pepper. I also added about 1/2 tsp salt; 1/2 tsp mustard; 1/2 tsp red pepper seeds; 1/4 tsp crushed bay leaves; 1 ground clove. Although this was much more time-consuming than using the Old Bay Seasoning, the cakes tasted great. I should have added a bit more red pepper to make it spicier. Anyway, the only other thing I would change about this recipe is that I would (like most other people said) dry out the grated zucchini. It was a bit too soggy, but it cooked up well. Thanks Patti Jo!

These were excellent.  Tended to be a bit messy trying to hold them together long enough to get them into a fry pan.  Maybe another egg would help?  They are really tasty though.  This is a keeper.

I've made this dish so many times it's become my signature meal. A couple important things: one, do not fry them. Bake at 400 on an oiled baking sheet for about 12-15 minutes, then turn over and bake another 10 minutes or so until they're done. Two, grate and drain the zucchini for at least two hours, longer if you can. I leave mine in the colander in the sink and squeeze out moisture every so often. 

Everyone who's ever tried them has loved them, from my meat-eating relatives to the picky teenagers and my toddler.

Yum. Took seasoning advice of others, also squeezed out excess water, half potato, half zucchini, extra 1/2 cup of panko. Made balls and then gently squashed into pancakes. Can't wait to try the healthier baked version.

This recipe is great!  I used Panko bread crumbs rather than regular, and I fried in coconut oil.  Only thing I would change would be a little be more Old Bay Seasoning, and a dash of salt.

These were yummy. I only used 1 tbsp of oil, and used a brush to coat the whole pan with it, and it was just enough.  I was prepared to add another tbsp of oil after flipping but it didn't need it and I was glad because I'm watching my calories.

I have made these numerous times over the past two months and all agree they are great.  Many are having issues with getting all the liquid out of the zucchini;  today I used my salad spinner... worked wonderful!!  I also make the patties and put them in the freezer for about an hour, then fry which helps the problem of them falling apart when trying to turn them over.  We like them best with Panko crumbs.  I have also made a double batch and froze some with great success... freeze without the breading and add it when ready to cook.  This is a very tasty, easy dish.  Thanks so much for sharing.

Awesome zucchini cakes!  Husband thought it was crab.  Did use lots of xtra old bay, garlic powder & a touch of cayenne (as others suggested).  Also tried panko bread crumbs instead of flour.  Highly recommend & will make these over & over again!

Funny, I made these last week, and the recipe was in my weekly email today! I had some zucchini I didn't want to just sauté (boring!), so I found this recipe and thought it sounded promising. The only thing I did differently was to bake the zucchini cakes, rather than fry them. I sprayed them with a bit of canola oil so they'd crisp up in the oven, and baked them on a silicone baking mat. I made a spicy remoulade to top them, and they were a big hit with my honey, who usually doesn't like zucchini. I had a couple for lunch the next day, and gave some to my sister,a nd they were great reheated the next day. I will definitely make these again when I get a hankering for crab cakes (I've recently gone back to being vegetarian).

Ohmygodsogood. Like others, I squeezed out the water in the shredded zucchini by putting it in a colander with pretty small holes, then squashing it down. I have made this recipe with regular bread crumbs and italian bread crumbs, and I would definitely recommend using EITHER italian bread crumbs OR regular bread crumbs, but with double the old bay seasoning. Otherwise they taste a little bland. I like to fry them up two at a time, then put them on a rack on a cookie tray in the oven to keep them warm. This keeps them crispy until served and they don't taste oily. And lastly, I tried baking them, but I still think frying gives them a crispier exterior and keeps them moister on the inside. Thanks for an amazing recipe!!

I used egg replacement and 1 Tbsp of oil instead of butter which worked fine, but I did find these a bit soggy like many others, but VERY TASTY. 
Used 4 zucchini for this batch and only got 6 fritters (I had expected about 10-12 because it "served" 5).
I may up the breadcrumbs next time.
I also sprayed my sheet and baked at 200-210*C for about 17 min each side which was good.

Made this last night and wasn't impressed, I do think I will try to make it again though, and just tweak the seasoning and maybe combine zucchini and grated potato.

So easy and delicious - I doubled the amount of Old Bay, used around 1-1/2 cups of bread crumbs and baked per other reviews - delicious and healthy!  Served with a dab of sour cream - hubby and daughter loved them!

My family and I LOVE these! The only thing I would change is using butter for frying rather than oil-it tastes better. We had these with the Chicken Cordon Bleu II from this website, and the cakes taste soo good with the gravy on top!

Eh not bad will have to tweak the recipe a bit.  There was too much breading to this recipe and it tasted more like a stuffing than a "crab" cake.

I made this recipe last night for supper along with a broccoli salad and creamy macaroni and cheese.  I didn't have any trouble getting the cakes to stay together, and I followed the recipe just as written, packing the grated zucchini to measure 2 1/2 cups.  These were a great hit at the supper table.  It is surprising how much they really do taste like crab cakes.

I guess after reading the reviews, I was expecting something spectacular.  The cakes weren't bad (they were edible) but I wasn't wowed at all.  I may try them again, in case it was a fluke, but the crab cakes definitely were not very impressive this first time I made it.

REALLY good. My daughter eats fish (no other meat) and my son rarely likes veggies and both LOVED it.  I had shrimp I needed to use so added them, chopped. Otherwise followed the recipe (baking, not frying) and they came out great.  I made a sauce of lowfat mayo, lime juice, hot sauce, mustard, Worcestershire and paprika and served with a lime wedge.  I was happy too as this recipe is a healthy one, low in calories especially baked.

WOW these are good! Got rave reviews from my boyfriend. I only had 2 cups zucchini so I scaled the recipe down, but kept the amount of egg, onion, and seasoning the same. I didn't have Old Bay so I used a pinch each of nutmeg, paprika, crushed bay leaves, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper. I also added 2 cloves of garlic, which was a perfect addition. I forgot to add the butter so I fried them in a mix of butter and oil and that worked out great. After reading reviews I put my zucchini through a potato ricer to drain out most of the water. I also froze the patties before frying to help them stick together, but I'm not sure that was really necessary. Great texture and flavour, and super easy to make. I will make these over and over, thanks for sharing!!

These were great!  You definitely have to drain the zucchini for a bit and make sure you get most of the moisture out.  Otherwise, the recipe worked!  I baked mine at 400 for 15 minutes, flipped and baked for another 15 minutes. They had a nice crispy outside and a tender center - just like a crabcake!

This was pretty tasty. Mine ended up with a little too much bread and not enough zucchini, so I'll use less crumbs next time. The refrigerated leftover patties made nice ground meat(less) crumbles which I used to make veggie tacos.

Just heavenly!  The taste was excellent, I didn't have any problems with too much moisture from the zucchini.  The only problem is, though, I wish the recipe would have stated how thick to make the patties.  I think I made mine too thick and they were a little soft and squishy in the middle.  This recipe should make 6 patties, I made 4.  My bad! Everytime I have some extra zucchini around I will shred and freeze just to make these!

This is a great recipe. I really wanted the real deal though. So, I did 1c. zucchini and 1c. crab. Also, had to improvise with what I had on hand. So, I left out the egg and added 3T of mayo instead (I'm PG and realized when I needed the egg that I had put the empty egg carton back in the fridge!). I also did not coat the cakes in flour as the consistency of the cakes we great just the way they were.

I used 3 eggs instead of 1 (for the 5 serving recipe) and found it stuck together better.

I was sooooo excited to try this recipe. First of all, I'm not sure why so many reviewers are commenting on the extreme need to drain and dry the zucchini -- that was no issue at all as the consistency was not an issue. What was an issue is I felt as though I were eating dense patties of  stuffing. My boyfriend agreed. This was the first "yuck face" I've seen on his face from any recipe I've tried from this site. Yes, they were flavored nicely (can't beat Old Bay), but unless you want your guests to subliminally think you're feeding them stuffing patties, I'd suggest you use the recipe to stuff mushrooms instead of making patties out of them.

I prepared zucchini long time in advance and drained on paper towels.  Changed it up a little.  Served with a thick slice of tomato on top and drizzled with balsamic reduction (syrup) as the salad for the meal at a dinner party...it was a hit!!!!!!

I have an abundance of zucchini growing in my backyard right now. I thought this was a good way to mix it up. My boyfriend and I both enjoyed these. I baked them as other reviewers recommended. I also didnt use just seasoned bread crumbs...i used panko and stuffing mix (cornbread) as well and they held together nicely. In  addition I whipped up a light sour cream sauce for these. Only sour cream, old bay, and a little water (to thin) was used...then garnished with chives. yum!

Instead of frying these I placed them on a lightly oiled pan and then drizzled some olive oil over the top.  Bake at 400 degrees for 25-30 minutes, flipping them halfway through.  They were a hit!  The Old Bay is really what creates that crab taste for you.  We will be making these for years to come.

These were good but not fantastic.  We normally don ever fry anything but I was looking for something different.  We made the Chipolte Mayo someome else suggested but these were better without them.  I followed the recipe exactly.

Drain the zucchini while you're gathering the other ingredients in a strainer in the sink.  Make sure you squeeze it a couple of times to get as much as you can out.  While forming the patties, you may find you need more bread crumbs about 1/2 way as the zuccini weeps out more moisture as you go along.  It really helped that my husband and I were a team, I formed and placed in oil, and he turned them and removed to drain.  As he removed one to drain, I would add another to the oil, keeping it moving smoothly.  I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!!

ADD CHEDDAR CHEESE!!! My daughter and I loved these because I made a batch of unaltered zucchini cakes and another batch with some cheddar cheese. My husband LOVED the unaltered cakes. ALL IN ALL, THE 'CRAB' CAKES DO NOT TASTE LIKE 'CRAB' CAKES BUT THEY ARE STILL VERY TASTY.

these were very good.  Don't fool yourself though, they are NOT going to taste like crab cakes!!  However, they are very tasty zucchini cakes!  I would recommend a couple of things.....First, take your shredded zucchini and place the pile into a kitchen towel.   Then bring up all the corners into a bundle and squeeze it over the sink with all your might!  You will have 1/2 cup of liquid or more come out.  Second, add about 2 tsp or more of the Old Bay for seasoning.  I used 1 1/2 tsp and still felt these were underseasoned.  I also skipped the flour step and just placed my cakes right in the oil.  very nice dish with some ranch and sour cream on the side.  I'll have to try with cocktail sauce, too.  thanks though, this was great to use one of those giant zucchinis from my garden that was too big to slice and needed to be shredded!

Loved this; doesn't taste like zucchini at all! I used Trader Joe's seafood seasoning,  which has no salt, so I could control the amount of salt. I also found the batter easier to work with if it's chilled overnight. It's great to make a batch at night and fry it up for breakfast.

These were great!  My brother in law was over for dinner and he is a vegetarian so I thought I would give these a try.  I will definitely be making these again.  I followed others advice and made sure to press as much water out of the grated squash as possible.  I also baked them to avoid oil saturation.  Thanks.

I keep kosher, so I've never eaten crab cakes, but these sure are good. I followed reviewers advice and drained the zucchini with a weight on it for a few hours. I think it did too good a job - the patties were a bit dry. I think next time I'll squeeze less thoroughly. I baked them on 375 for about half an hour, and I don't think frying is necessary.

Following other reviews: I lightly salted the shredded unpeeled zucchini with kosher salt and let drain, then I squeezed the excess moisture, which was a lot.  Two cups of shredded zucchini turned into 1 cup when all the water was squeezed out.  Since I had so little zucchini, the Old Bay Seasoning was very strong.  Next time, I'll leave it out.  I did add black pepper and cayenne pepper.  I used Panko Japanese breadcrumbs and put about 1/3 cup in the mixture, along with 1/8 cup flour.  After making the patties, I patted additional breadcrumbs onto each pattie before cooking. I baked them on a baking sheet in a 400 degree oven for 25 minutes, turning over once halfway through.  Then I finished them off under the broiler, less than two minutes on each side.  Next time, if I use Panko, I'll add Italian seasoning, dried oregano, dried parsley or something along those lines.  I may try them with Italian style breadcrumbs, which I think would be good too.  I dredged a couple of mine in flour before adding the Panko, and I would not do that in the future.  The flour didn't cook off in the baking process, though it probably would in the frying process.  Because I called them crab-style cakes, my husband was expecting crab and now I have to make crab cakes. :)  We both agreed they were very good and could see ways of improving them.  Mine were a little dry without Marinara Sauce, probably because I cooked them too long.  NOTE: 1 large zucchini makes about 2 1/4 cups of shredded zucch

These were pretty good. I added chopped jalapeno for spice. I also suggest making thinner patties as the thicker ones I made tasted a bit "bready" and pasty on the inside; the thinner ones were crispier and had better flavour!

These are an awesome way to use zucchini in the summer! While they don't quite taste "exactly" like crab cakes, they are  delicious and have made it onto the regular rotation at my house. UPDATED REVIEW: Try adding 1/2 tsp. ground mustard when you add the Old Bay. It's fantastic that way!

These were excellent..although I did not know to squeeze out all the water from the zucchini...so the final result was watery....I used ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs, and I also used green onions instead of regular. I also added some cayanne pepper and regular pepper. Will make again for sure....but just remember to to squeeze out all the water from the zucchini!!!!

This recipe is awesome we usually make this a side to some grilled talapia.  We usually use lots of old bay seasoning and if I'm really watching my calories I spray it with cooking oil and broil it instead of frying it.  Very yummy way to get those veggies in!!!

Excellent!  My and my family's only complaint was there wasn't more.  The recipe yielded 6 cakes for me.  Next time, I'll double it.  Also, hubby (mr. meat and potato only guy) wants to try these on a bun.  A healthy alternative to hamburgers.  I set shredded zucchini aside w/ sprinkled salt to release water, then I squeezed it out.  Note - be careful about how much salt you use, as my cakes turned out a little salty due to the old bay already called for in recipe.  And as others suggested, I did add an additional tsp of old bay.  Also, I made a dipping sauce too.  Anything will do.  Dill dip, tarter, or good ol' ketchup.  Great recipe!  Thank you for submitting!

I agree with others that it doesn't taste like crab.  But these were great.  My husband liked them so much he wanted me to make them for him for breakfast the next day and has been begging for them ever since...so for dinner tonight they will be made again.  Being it only takes about 1 large zucchini and I can get them at the local farmers market 3/$1 I think this will me a common in our household.  

I also doubled the OLD BAY and used a little less butter.  Squeezed out zucchini too!! 

Thanks for sharing this one its a keeper!!

This recipe was a great way to use zucchini, and generally tasty too.  Two things, however...  I'm from Maryland, where we are known for our crabcakes, and this tastes nothing like crabcakes. It tastes like a seasoned zucchini cake, which is fine - but no sweet crab flavor.  Secondly, as many had advised, I doubled the amount of Old Bay.  Mistake - remember that Old Bay is full of salt in addition to the seafood seasonings, and it made the cakes incredibly salty.  Next time I'd keep the Old Bay as is in the recipe, and use some additional non-sodium herbs and/or seasonings.

My husband and I liked this very much, we do not feel it taste like crab cakes.  You have to squeeze out the excess moisture out of the zucchini before mixing with other ingredients other wise you get mush.  Also the receipe doesn't say to use flawored bread crumbs.  Not very good with plain breadcrumbs.  Very good way to use excess zucchini.

This was pretty good, I shredded the zuccini in the morning and kept squeezing out the water all day while I kept it in the fridge.  I wouldnt of added more old bay or it would of been too spicy.  It fried up nicely and was tasty.

I thought these overall were okay.  The old bay spices were a great touch in them!  However, next time I would coat the outside in breadcrumbs to make a crispy crust.  The softer flour crust just didn't do it for me.  We would make these again.

These are tasty morsels. However, I don't believe they taste like any crab cake I have ever had. If one is expecting the flavor and texture of a crab cake, this is not the recipe to try. But if one is looking for a great vegan appetizer, this would be a wonderful recipe. Thanks for sharing, Patti Jo!

The first thing this recipe should tell you is to make sure that "all" of the water is out of the zucchini before you even begin to prepare the recipe.  It was sloppy trying to keep it together before you put it in oil and once it was in oil "more" water came out and made the pan soupy.  I kept having to pour out liquid time and time again.  The taste is great and if you can get all the water out of the zuccini prior to preparing and cooking it would be wonderful.

Very delicious, topped with cocktail sauce! Grated a potato & added, fried in olive oil.  Added a touch more zucchini. This is definitely something I will keep on making.

I thought these zucchini cakes were great!  I doubled the Old Bay seasoning and think I will increase it again the next time I make them.  I also put the shreaded zucchini in a colander and salted it and weighted it with a bowl to remove the liquid.

Very good as is. I modified to taste the second time around by adding Parmesan and garlic powder and a little more Old Bay. I drained the zucchini, but the mixture was still a little too goopey, so instead of adding more bread crumbs I added potato flakes until the consistency was right. Served with a sour cream sauce (Sour cream, lemon, dill, salt, pepper) Of course I think it's 5 stars my way, but the base recipe is very tasty and does remind me of crab cakes.

Excellent Recipe!! Grated a large zucchini, a potato and half of an onion into a colander and let it sit about 20 minutes to drain (don't really know if it was necessary) added a little parmesan cheese, some salt and pepper along with the other listed ingredients. Had the same texture as crab cakes but didn't really taste like crab.........didn't taste like zucchini either..........just delicious! They were so good, I made them again 3 nights later.

I LOVE this recipe! I add in a shredded carrot, minced onion, minced garlic, and minced fresh pimento - all fresh veggies. Baked on a stone at 425° turning once.  Absolutely amazing!

These are amazing!  I didn't have Old Bay so I made some (very easy to do) using a recipe I found on the internet.  After I shredded the zucchini, I placed it in a colander and lightly salted it, then let it sit for a half hour or so.  After that, I squeezed a ton of water out of the zucchini, then followed the recipe as written.  I did take one other reviewer's suggestion and baked these instead of frying.  425 degrees for 12 minutes, flip, then bake another 12 minutes.  (Don't dredge in flour if you're going to bake these.  I did, and it didn't help them to brown as it would if I'd fried the cakes.)

The only thing I did differently was bake them in the oven at 400° for 30 minutes, turning after 15 with a little bit of butter. They had a crispy outside and a nice soft center. I did it this way because I was baking some cod at the same time. I loved it. It had just the right amount of spice. Will definitely be making this again soon. I had enough to make 6 good size cakes. Can't wait to eat the last 2 for lunch tomorrow! Next time I'll cook them on the stove and compare. 
Update: I brought the last two to work and served one as a sample with the recipe to the gals in the office yesterday. They all loved it! One even bought zucchini on her way home and made last night! Her hubby who doesn't like zucchini liked these! This is a big hit in our office!
Update: this has become my husband's favorite way to eat zucchini! The last time I made them, I had some baby Portobello mushrooms that I needed to use up so I chopped and threw them in - awesome! I still haven't tried frying them. I find baking them in the oven is so easy and has to be healthier so I've stuck with that.

Absolutely loved these. I didn't have Old Bay Seasoning, which after eating them is a MUST, so I made my own. I used whole wheat flour to dredge them in. I brushed a cookie sheet with a thin layer of olive oil and baked them at 400 degrees for 12 minutes flipped and baked for another 12 minutes. I can't wait to share this recipe with my friends and family.

I find this recipe hard to rate.  I followed it to a tee, then with the next batch I incorporated several other reviewers' suggestions.  Bottom line, if you are a crab aficionado, I have to agree with “Marcie” from Baltimore, Maryland, who said these taste like filler.  I was really glad I served the cakes on Portobello mushrooms (thank you to another reviewer)or this would have been a total loss.  There wasn't even a suggestion of the taste of crab.  However, it made for excellent stuffed portobello mushrooms for our company last night and that's why 4 stars instead of 3.

This sounded interesting when I searched for a zucchini recipe.  I used extra Old Bay Seasoning, also, and decided to include an 8 oz. package of imitation crab.  My husband and I both liked it.  I would do this again.

Very good.  I used 3/4 cup plain bread cumbs and 1/4 seasoned bread crumbs due to what I had on hand.  Followed the rest to a T with the exception of screwing up and mixed the flour with the other ingredients instead of dredging.  I will definitely do that always as I have made these several times before as written and they stayed together much better this time and cooked to a beautiful golden brown.

Saw this recipe in the morning and made it for dinner.  It was delicious.  I too should have read the reviews, next time i will drain the zucchini but I made it right away and it was not to wet.  I think the bread crumbs may have soaked up any extra liquid.  I did add a little more old bay and what was called for and I also dredged them in panko breadcrumbs.  I put some olive oil on a cookie sheet and put the cakes on the sheet and sprinkled a little more oil on top and baked them.  They came out crispy and delicious.  Will definitely make again and again.

Awesome!  I only had plain breadcrumbs so I just added some Italian seasoning to the mix and added some garlic powder.  I did squeeze out the moisture from the zucchini in paper towels.  I'll definitely make these again and again!

These were GREAT! I did add some Frank's Hot Sauce when I mixed them up and even added more when I ate them. Next time I make them I will increase the bread crumbs and Old Bay. I will definitly make these again!

I used the larger grate side of my grater, and didn't even think about the need to "dry" the zucchini.  Used store-bought bread crumbs (salt-free seasoned) and didn't have any consistency issues.  Thought I had Old Bay Seasoning in the cabinet, but didn't...used 1 tsp of Goya Sazon which was a great substitute!  I'm definitely going to use the baking method next time to be a little healthier.  Great Recipe!

Definitely, you need to use a ricer or just squeeze in a paper towel, to dry the zucchini enough to handle.
 Great tasting, and we'll make them again, but for sure you're not going to fool anyone that their's a crab in there somewhere. We used Phillips Seafood Seasoning, but there's just as much salt in that as Old Bay.
You can never have too many Zucchini recipes this time of the year.

This was pretty tasty. I did what other reviewers suggested and squeezed out the water from the freshly grated zucchini with a rice cooker. If I were to make this again I probably would use only half as much bread crumbs, because it turned out kind of doughy. I also would add extra seasoning, maybe a dash of paprika, a few pressed garlic cloves, some black or cayenne pepper?

These were great!  Definitely drain! -- I didn't do a good job of it... will next time!  Didn't change much other than my own spices because I don't keep Old Bay and added grated carrot.  Thanks for great recipe!

Leave onion chunky for a bit more crunch in the filling. Simple and yummy!

Draining the Zucchini is a MUST! I pan fried these but they were a bit soggy even after draining the zucchini for 1 hour. Next time I plan on draining for more than 4 hours to see how that works.

Out of this world! These are perfect for summer time when you need to use up all that zucchini in the garden and for when you're craving crab cakes but don't wanna spend the money on the real thing.  I will make these again and again!

Today was the second time I've made it, but the first time with the Old Bay (used italian bread crumbs/seasoning first time). Remember the moisture issue from the first time, so I ran the shredded zucchini through my salad spinner and that seemed to help quite a bit. Also, since I had a scant two cups of zucchini, I left the bread crumbs at one cup and I think that helped as well.

Delicious! I doubled the recipe, added cheddar and baked with olive oil in the oven 12 min each side.  Came out perfect.  Crispy on the outside, not greasy and very flavorful on the inside.

Good, easy and fast.  I'm vegetarian, so I don't know what a crab cake tastes like, but why do you need one when you have these?!  I squeezed the zucchini before I measured it (definitely needed as they were still a little loose on the inside).  I had some leftover tzatziki which I served with them and it was exactly what they needed!

These were pretty good. The kids ate them, so that's a plus! Used Emeril's Original Essence seasoning because I didn't have Old Bay. Still turned out great. Would like to try baking them as one reviewer suggested. Just to make them healthier.

Mmm delicious! I made a healthier revision with egg beaters. BAKED at 400 for 15 mins then turned them and baked them for another 10 mins or so. I used italian bread crumbs, skipped the butter and the flour and oil of course. I will be making these a lot!

I salted and squeeze dried the shredded zucchini before adding it into the mix. I also left out the flour step. I greased a cookie sheet with some vegetable oil and set the oven to 400*F. I cooked the patties for 12 - 15 minutes on each side (until they were golden and crispy). They are very delicious, even if they don't taste like crab.

These were great! Will make again and again! The only thing I did different was, I used seasoned bread crumbs because thats what I had. Next time I will use plain, because it might have made them a little on the salty side. I also used 1/4 cup of clam juice instead of the butter because I had it and didn't want to waist it. Instead of pan frying, I did as another review suggested and greased a baking dish and baked 30 min. per side. They were so good even the non zucchini eaters in my house ate them! I served them with tartar sauce. Next time, I think I'm gonna try melting a little cheddar over the top and serving them as the main dish with a side of sour cream! Yum!

I know I totally changed the recipe but I took all the ingredients and added them to a box of potato pancake mix.  Mixed it all together and baked it for 10 minutes per side then pan fried them in very little oil.  The zucchini melted away and my kids loved them.  Only made 12 pancakes.

This was very Good, I salted the Zucchini to get the moisture out (I do it with a similar recipe so it was automatic) I also used a different type of seafood spice. I didn't think  it tasted much like crab, but it was a good zucchini cake with a mild seafood flavor.  My kids all enjoyed it and ate two or three each! I will be making it again, but will probably play with the spices a bit, it needed some garlic.

I judge restaurants in SE Louisiana by their crab cakes. Definitely not the real thing but it had the right flavor (old bay) and texture. We enjoyed these and will make many more times.

These definitely were not crab cakes, but they were very tasty. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and salted and drained my zucchini, like I would for any zucchini fritter. I also sub'd Panko for the flour. I am very glad that a previous reviewer suggested adding the bread crumbs in slowly, because I didn't even use half a cup of bread crumbs, and could have probably gotten away with using even less. They had good flavor, but were a little dry. Will use even less bread crumbs next time.

We love these.  A great way to use up all the garden zucchini.  I make a dip with mayo, old bay, lemon juice and sou cream.  Yummy!

Delicious.  I took another reviewer's suggestion to salt and drain the zucchini for 30 minutes prior to making.  It really helped to remove excess water.  I also baked the cakes in the oven on 400 on a greased cookie sheet and then finished them in the broiler.

This is a fantastic recipe.I omitted the flour dredging, and used panko crumbs. Fried to a golden brown> I did not have any problems and otherwise followed the recipe/ My one year old grandson absolutely loves these!

This was good.  But is not a substitute for a 'good' crab cake.  I was disappointed after reading all the reviews.  The texture of the zucchini does not mimic the texture of crab.  It is important to drain the zucchini thoroughly before using it in the recipe.    I have not decided whether to make this again.  Perhaps for a potluck or party.

These were so tasty! And surprisingly filling too. We baked them at 400° for 25 minutes, flipping halfway through. They were served with homemade cocktail sauce. A vegetarian and omnivore approved recipe.

Used Panko crumbs in place of the flour. Out of this world.  Delicious! My vegetarian son that hates zucchini ate about 6 of these patties. They do not taste like crab but it was delicious none the less. I made Lemon Dill Mayo with a tiny bit of blended chipotle chili and that was bomb for dipping the zucchini!

Did as a previous reviewer said and skipped the flour and rolled them in panko bread crumbs, and baked @ 400 for 15 minutes on each side. They were really yummy, Didn't taste like crab to us, but still good.

Overwhelmed with zucchini I turned to this and WOW! Messy to make but that's where the love comes from! - I used panko & bread crumbs with bisquick as the "flour" and they were awesome! I made bite-sized ones for an appetizer to take into work for the 4th party - excellent reviews! Made a somewhat "remoulade" sauce for dipping

This was a fantastic recipe for zucchini!  I've prepared a few as the recipe calls, a few with chick peas and curry, and a few with Italian seasoning for future dinners.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

These are great with a remoulade sauce.  I whipped a quick one up with ketchup, mayo, cocktail sauce, and a dash of Louisiana hot sauce.  My mom commented that the cakes needed salt and pepper and more Cajun seasoning to kick up the flavor.  I will definitely make it more spicy next time.  Good starter though!

I LOVE this recipe. I have used it many times and just put in more breadcrumbs to avoid the mushiness but think I'll try some of the tips on draining the zucchini first the next time I make it.

I made this recipe the last time my mother in law was here, and she loved it.  Not only has is circulated through our family, but it has circulated her workplace as well.  Everyone loves this alternative to regular crab cakes.

Loved these.  Will make again.  They have an Indian food flavor to them, although they do not taste like crab cakes.  I baked them instead of frying.  They also freeze really well - shape them, cook them, and wrap individually in foil and just dethaw in the microwave.

I have nothing but great to say about these. As I fried them, I kept the finished ones hot in the oven and ohhhhh they were the best use of zucchini I have found in a LONG time! I made a "dip" of tofu mayo and horseradish for these... a dollop atop each and what a SWEET supper I had!

I love zucchini, and I love crab cakes.  I was really excited to try this recipe, but there was nothing too exciting about it.  I followed the original recipe exactly--and did take advice to minimize the water from the zucchini.  Maybe it would be better served differently--jazzed up--but it just didn't impress me as it is.

I only used 1/2 cup bread crumbs and cooked in the oven vs pan fry. I didn't have onions but I used garlic powder. "horsey" sauce on it makes it the best. yum!  I liked it.

These are fabulous!!  For someone who just returned to vegetarianism, these are perfect; full of flavor, void of meat.  Even my 1 year old loved them, and actually cried when we were out of them and she couldn't have more.  I did sub olive oil for the butter and didn't bread in flour, though.  The olive oil sub worked well, but not skipping the breading was a bit of a mistake.  The first batch into the pan nearly fell apart.  The next ones I packed really tightly and they held up, but barely.  So to others who are going to make this, it pays to bread them.

These were delicious! I followed other reviewers' suggestions and squeezed the liquid out of the shredded zucchini before mixing all the ingredients together, and I added a little garlic powder just for fun. I skipped the flour dredge and baked on a greased cookie sheet at 400 degrees, for about 12 minutes a side. They browned up nicely and were nice and crispy on the outsides. The taste reminded us a little of Thanksgiving dressing, but in a good way. This recipe is a keeper - tasty and very easy!

Nice! The zucchini definitely needs to be drained before making the batter. I otherwise followed the recipe exactly and topped these with sour cream, dill, Old Bay, and green onion. Thanks!

Crab taste – no.  Very good – yes.  I have been going meatless on Monday’s for over a year and I’ve pretty much given up on getting my family to join me.  I didn’t offer them any of this but my daughter asked for some and liked it.  I will make again but will try to grate my zucchini finer next time.

These were delicious! Probably one of the best dishes I have had with zucchini..well next to the zucchini bread I made from here. I froze the cakes before handling and that really helped out a lot. I also added about a tablespoon of mayonnaise too just because i am used to putting mayonnaise in crab cake recipes. I am from MD and these don't taste like real crab cakes but they are very tasty. I added a cup of homemade bread crumbs plus another 1/2 cup of crackers crumbs. I am making another batch tomorrow to freeze! I have lots of zucchini to get rid of. Thanks for the great recipe!

Seeing yummy looking Zucchini cakes in the deli at my local grocery store for $1 apiece sent me in search of a recipe to protect my limited budget. This one does the trick and leaves lots of room for future adjustments. Given how much we love zucchini, these are likely to be a favorite at our house all summer long.

These were okay, but I probably won't make again.  They were very soggy in the inside, and gave the impression that they weren't done, when they were.  The inside tasted like stuffing.  Not really what I was looking for.  I will stick to my potato pancake recipe that I use, and just add zucchini to them like I usually do.

Awesome!  Looking forward to making them with the zucchini that I'll be growing in my garden this summer.  I serve it with the same sauce that I use for crab cakes-a remoulade sauce

I've never tried Old Bay Seasoning in zucchini cakes and it was really good!  Except for that, I really don't think I'd get these confused with crab cakes, but I'd make them again anyway. I did not use the melted butter in the cakes themselves, but I did fry them in a combination of olive oil and butter to add some of the flavor.

Wow! These taste really good! And if you close your eyes while you eat them like the Patti Jo said, they really do taste sorta like crab cakes. My 4 year old devoured them before I got finished cooking them all! I only squeezed the zucchini out a little in a paper towel and I did double the old bay and used olive oil instead of butter. Very delish!

these were really good. i thought they tasted more like a sweeter version of a potato pancake than a crab cake. i squeezed all the water out of the shredded zucchini, added the flour into the mix instead of dredging the the patties in flour, and i didn't have any old bay, so i added some garlic powder, salt, cayenne, italian seasonings, and parsley. my boyfriend and i really liked them like this.

These were better than I even expected!  I've not had a lot of crab cakes, so I can't attest to how "accurate" the taste is to the real thing...but they were wonderful either way.  I lined a cookie sheet with foil, sprayed it with olive oil cooking spray, placed the patties on it, and sprayed the tops of the patties with the spray.  Then I followed other suggestions to bake for 25-30 minutes at 400 degrees, turning once.  They don't get quite as browned as the fried version but tasted the same and were a little healthier this way.  Definitely drain your zucchini once grated, though.  I enjoyed eating these plain and warm...thanks for a good, unique recipe.

For some reason, I decided to add the flour into the mixture, rather than just lightly coating the outside- ooops! I don't fry food very often! I realized what I did right after, but it was too late! So I cannot give a proper star rating until I try this recipe again (I'll just assume it would have been much better without my mistake)- just thought I might try to prevent anyone else from making the same mistake!!!

Yum! I followed MANDT2's suggestion and baked these at 400 for around  25 minutes, flipping once. I wasn't sure if I still needed to dredge in flour if I wasn't frying, but I did, and then misted with olive oil on both sides and they turned out great. I highly recommend Remoulade Sauce a la New Orleans from this site on the side. We served these with grilled tomatoes and asparagus...summer on a plate!

These were great! They are an excellent alternative to real crab cakes. We are trying to cut down on our grocery bill by incorporating two or three vegetarian meals per week, so when I saw this recipe I wanted to try it. I did not have Old Bay seasoning but I found a recipe for it and just made my own. I also didn't have any onion so I used onion powder instead and I added a few grated carrots for color. Frying these made them nice and crispy, though next time I might bake them at 400 degrees (per another reviewer) to cut down on the fat.

Great recipe!  We really enjoyed these, and it was a good way to use up some of the zucchini from the garden.  I shaped mine into little zucchini 'crab' balls and let them sit in the fridge for a couple of hours.  Then I deep fried them until golden at 375 degrees.  They were delicious.  I served them with different dipping sauces, remoulade, sweet red bell pepper sauce, and honey mustard. A huge hit!

These were fabulous! Just make sure that you ring out the zucchini well. Mine produced about 1/2 a cup of water. I also didn't use any oil. I just put the patties on a cookie sheet lined with reynolds aluminium non stick foil. I put them in the oven on 400 degrees for 15 min., flipped them and put them back in for another 15 minutes. I served them with sweet potato fries and a fresh green salad. A word to the wise...if you're not really fond of peppery food then be careful with the old bay. Those who suggest doubling or tripling the amt. are out of their gourds.

I'm obsessed with these zucchini cakes. I always add more seasoning when I make these, but I do that with everything I make. :-) I throw together a chipotle lime aioli to go with these and it's so delicious.

Very good recipe. My hubby loved them, said he didn't even realize they were made out of zucchini. I did drain the grated zucchini in a colander for 1 hour then squeezed the remaining juice out before using. The result still was alittle goopy but fried up just fine.

Good flavor.  I also had the same problem with it being to watery.  I did drain the zucchini for a ~30 minutes, but I think it needs to drain longer.

The only change I made to this recipe was to throw in some dried minced onion instead of fresh - I was feeling lazy and it still came out WONDERFUL. I highly recommend this tasty dish, you won't believe you're eatting vegetables!

Fantastic! So easy to make, the prep time was only a few minutes! After grating the zucchini I put it in a dishtowel to ring out all of the water. That is a must. I doubled the Old Bay seasoning and that was perfect for my taste. Instead of frying them, I baked them for about 10 mins on 375 then broiled them. I will be using all my extra zucchini this way!

As a native Marylander, crab has been my only "cheat" as a vegetarian.  However, after trying this recipe, I may be able to stave off the crab cravings more often than not!

If you are a traditional Maryland crab cake fan, no the zucchini will not give you the exact texture you're looking for or the sweetness you get from a great crab cake without all the filling.  You definitely have to squeeze out the extra moisture from the zucchini and add a lot more Old Bay than the recipe calls for.  I think it helped that I added Old Bay to the dredging flour as well.  Put them on a toasted bun with some homemade tartar sauce and I almost feel like I'm back home!

Overall, I am SO HAPPY that I tried this recipe -- it is simply fantastic (with some extra Old Bay)!  Thank you for sharing it!!!

This recipe turned out very well.  We don't have the Old Bay in Australia so I added a hot curry powder instead.  The baking idea was much more succesful than frying - cleaner on the palate and the hips!  What is Old Bay by the way?

Weird......I was a bit apprehensive about trying, but we LOVE them!

My hubby gets sick on crab, but loves the taste. We made these last fall and they were wonderful. My picky 4 year old even ate them. They were a bit runny even after squeezing out excess liquid. I added more seasoned bread crumbs. 

Next time I will freeze and extra batch for winter. 

Thanks for sharing!

These were fantastic! Really great way to use up all the zuc's from my garden!  Drained on paper towel for 1/2 hour and added minced green pepper to the rest of the mix.  As one reviewer commented to add more Old Bay - I say NOWAY!  I added two tbs. and it was WAY too salty. But other than that - delish.

These were delicious. I used Italian bread crumbs. I also used an ice cream scoop (for uniform size) then formed the zucchini into flat patties. Put the flour on a plate and put the patty in the flour then flip with a small spatula (coat well with flour or they are too soggy).

We thought this was OK, nothing too over the top. If we make it again, we’ll use the regular bread crumbs instead of the Italian and add more of the Old Bay Seasoning.

Also, my wife had a great method for getting the water out of the zucchini. After grating it, she simply wrapped it up in a very clean dishtowel. She then wrung the towel as tight as she could, squeezing out the water. She used two towels in all and the zucchini came out perfect!

These didn't taste like crab, but they were delicious.  It was my first experience using Old Bay seasoning and I can definitely see the potential with that in future dishes.  I used Panko bread crumbs because they were the only non-seasoned ones I had and it turned out wonderfully crispy.  I threw together a spicy kind of tartar sauce  with mayo, relish, lemon juice, dijon mustard and several dashes of hot sauce.  I can't wait to try this recipe with other veggies like spinach, brocolli and mushrooms.  Thanks for a different and tasty new side dish.

These cakes tasted pretty good.  but they were a lot of work and made a huge mess.  It was great to find another way to use zucchini.  I probably won't make these real regularly, but for the occasional "something different" for dinner, it's just right.

Very quick and easy to make.  Cooked the recipe as written and it tasted great.  Be sure to let the zucchini drain before you use it or the mixture will be a little too wet.

These did not taste like crabcakes, however they were very tasty.  We really enjoyed them and I will make them again.  Next time I will follow the advice of others and not used "seasoned" bread crumbs, I will use more butter and more Old Bay.  Very tasty treat!

I wouldn't say it tastes like crab, but if you think of them as zucchini patties, they are pretty darn good!  I was a little weary of adding 2 tsp. Old Bay due to the fact that I cut out salt due to high blood pressure, but very pleased that I added the 2 tsp.  I also used panko breading, but think next time I'll try the Italian bread crumbs.  Will be sharing this recipe!

These turned out wonderfully...I listened to the reviews and increased the breadcrumb amount, and I think next time I'll add some Old Bay to the flour coating to give it an extra kick.

These had a very good flavor, I'm from Maryland and my husband actaully thought they were better than crab cakes. 

However, they did not stick togetehr at all. Half of them fell apart while frying, what a mess. Maybe next time I will add an extra egg white.

I've made these for about 20 years. Always delicious when zucchini are fresh in the summertime. Don't use the big, overripe zucchini at the end of the season. I omit old bay...too much salt, which I can't have. A no salt product and freshly ground pepper is what I use. Also good with a little dill weed added to them.

The cakes turned out fairly well, although they didn't taste as crab-like as I had hoped. If I make these again it will probably be as veggie burgers like other reviewers suggested.

We did this recipe exactly as listed, but dropped them in our deep fryer. Amazing! I think they are best if the actually cakes are kept small, like 2 to 2.5 inches in diameter.

My roommate and I really LOVE this recipe, especially with a little tartar sauce.  I would double the seasoning.  I tried to grate the zucchini with a peeler but will use a grater next time, as the recipe calls for.  Straining the zucchini was a pain in the butt, there must be a good way to do this, because this recipe is soo worth it. I won't fully dredge the patties next time in flour - the sides didn't cook.  I also  had the flame on too high so the first side got browned quickly - I turned it down to make sure that the second side and the egg got cooked.  Be careful to cook it too long though - the zucchini is nice with a little bit of crunch to it.

Thank you!!! I doubled the recipe because I had the zucchini on hand. Could some zucchini be moister than others? I had no problem at all with the mixture being too wet. Doubled the Old Bay spice and added oregano, salt and pepper to the breadcrumbs. My sweetie and I ate about 2/3 of the doubled recipe with cut veggies and dip at lunch then finished off the rest of the cold cakes for dinner! WONDERFUL!

This was super yummy and super easy! I shredded the zucchini in the food processor, then put it in a colander and squeezed some of the water out. Ate it on buns with tartar sauce, lettuce, and tomato. It was delicious and I was surprise how quickly I could get it all together.

I could not believe that these would taste like crab. Boy was I wrong! I have made this recipe a couple of times and have had many people sample, it they are totaly blown away when I tell them there is no Crab in it. I call it this recipe "Surprise Crab Cakes", the surprise is there is no crab.

Excelent recipe. I was a bit skeptical at first!!
I did add a few more bread crumbs and stuck the mixture in the fridge to help the patties stick better. Other than that. Wouldn't change a thing. The second time a round I used regular seasoning salt since I was out of Old Bay... tasted just as good. Thanks Connie

These are great! I'm eating one now as I type. I used italian seasoning instead of old bay because thats what I had. I also used shredded zucchini instead of grated. I doubled the recipe too. It turned out fantastic. Thanks for the recipe Patti.

This was awesome.  The first time I made it, I didn't drain the zucchini so it was REALLY soupy.  I added a bunch of flour and dropped onto the skillet pancake-style, which actually turned out tasting pretty good.  The second time, I drained the zucchini and then followed the recipe exactly.  It was really good; the kids loved it.

I personally thought that these seemed a little bland and mushy (and not really like a crab cake!)  However, my husband really enjoyed them, and the recipe is now a staple in a good friend's kitchen.  Make the patties thinner to avoid excess "mushiness".  We enjoy making small dollar-sized cakes to use as appetizers!

Excellent dish!  You really should make this.  I did and was quite surprised with the taste.  My husband and I thought we were actually eating crab cakes.  When grating the zucchini, be sure not to grate them too small as they'll be too watery, resulting in a mixture that's difficult with which to work.  Also, we added an extra teaspoon of Old Bay as we really like the seafood taste it provides.  Try this recipe.  You won't be dissappointed!

These were very good.  I'm not a big zucchini fan, but my hubby loves it, so I wanted to find something we would both like.  They tasted nothing like crab, but that's ok.  To get the water out I sprinkled salt on the grated zucchini and put it in a collendar and let it sit for about half and hour. You'd be suprised how much water the salt took out. Then I squeezed out the excess liquid.  I served them with a honey mustard sauce.  Yummy.  I tried to tell my five year old they were "Crabby Patties" but she didn't buy it.

AWESOME! These were the best! I used "I Can't Believe it's Not Butter" instead of butter and Canola oil in place of Vegetable oil. Turned out wonderful! Next time I may use a little bit more of the Old Bay seasoning, but that's just a personal perference.

Excellent cakes! As suggested by others, be sure to drain off as much liquid as possible before adding the bread crumbs so that the cakes crisp up nicely. I also added more old bay. I may try using cooking spray instead of oil next time to make them a bit healthier.

This recipe is very good!  Although it doesn't taste like a real crab cake..the Old Bay Seasoning gives it a comparable seafood taste.  I did as the others suggested..and squeezed out the liquid from the zucchini and I used 2 teaspoons of the Old Bay Seasoning.  Me and my husband both liked it very well!

these are sooooo great.  i am a crab cake addict and you can't get decent crab in the area where i live so this is a great substitute for when i just have to have crab cakes.  i've not tried draining the zucchini first, but will the next time i make.  i've never had a problem with the patties holding together, though. i keep my hand slightly damp, like when your making meatballs, and make smaller patties.  i like to make a roasted red pepper mayonaise to serve with these.

These were AWESOME! The kids and hubby actually ate them but with mixed feelings...this however was an accomplishment since they're all dreadful carnivores and not particularly experimental.  I doubled the old bay and added a tad more butter and dredged in italian breadcrumbs instead of flour.  My co-workers whom i shared with LOVED them and demanded the recipe!  It's a keeper!

This was a fabulous recipe.  I made a lot of them when zucchini was in season, and then I froze them.  They are great reheated!  My fiance get can't enough of them!  Plus, they taste just like crab cakes!

I really liked this recipe.  Great way to eat your veggies.  I wouldn't double the Old Bay for this one.  If you are short on zucchini, stretch the recipe by adding shredded carrot and/or potato.  I allowed the patties to sit in the fridge for at least 30 min before sauteing.  Less mess this way.

These were wonderful, in fact I couldn't detect the lack of crab.  Thanks for the tips on draining the zucchini, a little salt and a heavy weight did the trick.  I had to search for the Old Bay seasoning, but found it at "Real Canadian Superstore".  (I live in western B.C.)
This will become a "favourite". Thanks, Helen.

this was great -made this for my son's vegan girlfriend using egg substitute- wonderful. Also suggest you drain the zuccini by sprinkling the zuccini with 1 teaspoon of the salt and place on a plate. Mix it with your hands to evenly distribute the salt. Place a heavy saucepan on top of the zuccini and allow it to sit for 20 minutes to purge itself of liquid. Makes it lighter and a lot flakier.

The first time I made this I didn't strain the shredded zucchinis, and the inside was a little soggy, but they still tasted good.  The second time I made them I let them strain in a colander over a bowl for about 1 hour, and then also added parmesan to the rest of the ingredients.  THEY WERE AMAZING!!!

My son is a vegetarian and he doesn't like zucchini and I tried this one on him and he like this. I guess it was the bay seasonings that did the trick.

BF and I both LOVED this recipe!!  Doubled onion, doubled old bay, used panko instead of bread crumbs (what I had on hand)added ground mustard, garlic powder, salt, pepper and cayenne and baked at 400 for 35ish minutes. Flipped the last 5 minutes and they were perfect. Made a sauce out of cholula, garlic Chile sauce, Greek yogurt and some dried cilantro.

2017-09-24 - This time I used 3 packed cups of zucchini UNDRAINED, almost 1 Tbs Old Bay, and a little over 1/4 cup of onion.  The patties did not stick together well (my fault), but they also did not taste like they had too much breadcrumbs.  The increase in Old Bay was a good thing.  Served with tartar sauce (leftover from last year's batch!) and sliced tomatoes.  Still three stars, but a quick and decent light meal.
2016-08-05 - Per Imp70: "I shredded it into a collander and added about 1/2 tsp. of salt. I let it drain for about 30 minutes (pressing slightly with wooden spoon)"
Per many reviews, used plain breadcrumbs and doubled the Old Bay.
1 pound zucchini peels and shreds to 2 cups, so you need 1.5 lbs for one batch of this recipe. I used 2 cups to make 6 burger-size patties, and we each had two with a cob of corn as our suppers (and then DBF had another 15 minutes later).

This recipe was okay.  DBF thought it would make a decent patty for a veggie burger.  I thought the proportion of breadcrumbs to zucchini was too high, but I'm not sure that I could reduce them and still have the patties stick together.

I do not like zucchini, but these did not taste like zucchini, so that was good.  I served with Tartar Sauce IV (needs less dill and more lemon) and corn on the cob.

Triple the Old Bay.   I did press the zucchini to get the water out.   Also I sprayed the cakes with olive oil and baked at 400 for 30 minutes, flipping and spraying the cakes halfway through.

Good taste, but you really do need to squeeze the water out of the zucchini. I let it drain in a colander for a couple of hours and it was still too wet. I used a heaping teaspoon of Old Bay and coated the cakes in breadcrumbs, and also froze them before coating as someone suggested. They did taste like commercial crabcakes, but nothing beats the real thing!

I have made this several times now and it is always delicious. Crispy outside and creamy inside.  I have made it for friends and they love it.  Perfect summer recipe for fresh garden zucchini.  Remember to squeeze out extra moisture from the grated zucchini and it will be perfect!

I was craving a tasty vegetarian dish and tried this recipe using eggplant instead of zucchini based on what I had available in my fridge. It turned out very well, I added a little more bread crumbs and toned up the seasoning with allspice, curry, garlic powders and fresh lemon thyme plus salt and pepper to serve. Yummy. I'll do it again with the zucchini next time.

Not bad! Even hubby ate it without too much complaint and he's a meat and potato guy. :) I cut back on butter to 1 tap and added chopped red pepper and purple onions to beef it up. was able to make 6 patties, each 1/3 cup in size. 2 wwpp each if anyone care to know. :) next time, I'll add more spices.

I've been on the hunt for meals that are healthy, delicious and easy to make. Much easier said than done. This fits the bill.  A GREAT appetizer by itself, but now I'm looking for a good dipping sauce to go with it.

i enjoyed them but they were crispy on the outside and soggy inside. My zucchini was dry so no excess water from that so not sure why they were soggy on the inside.

This recipe is awful. I drained the zucchini for hours and squeezed a lot of water out.  Made it exactly as the recipe stated.  They were a giant mushy mess.  No idea how people got these to stick together.

I made this vegan, and it is sooo good. I subbed 1T of ground flax combined with 3T water for the egg, used Earth Balance spread in place of butter/margarine, and doubled the Old Bay.
Fried 'em first time (delicious!) but baked at 400 second time= even better. Next time will use cornstarch in place of flour for 'dredging' and see how that goes.
I have a new go to recipe for a quick lunch or dinner. Thanks Connie and AllRecipes.com :)
PS the only vegan bread crumbs I can find, locally, are 4C plain :)

I have waited all winter for fresh garden zucchini to make these again, super delicious.  I do think they need something...either a sauce or ??? (But I won't say what, because the review is for the recipe, as it stands-ok diced tomatoes and home made creamy garlic dressing) Agree with other reviewers, they can be impossibly wet to prepare, so I grate the zucchini, let it drain for at least an hour and even refrigerate before rolling in flour and cooking...they are lovely.

These were great! I added some green onions as well as minced and used Italian bread crumbs. Cooked them till they were crisp.  They were great with ranch dressings and some brown rice.  A great meatless night dish!

This is my #1 favorite recipe for zucchini. I have been using this recipe for several years now. I have even frozen some patties to use over the winter, and they are still delicious! My family has also complimented them, and have come back to my house asking for more. I'll be using my zucchini for this recipe a lot this summer!

These were awesome! I was intrigued when I found this recipe because 1) I want to cook at least one meatless dish a week and 2) I became allergic to all shellfish at the age of 26.  I made some minor revisions; I omitted the butter, added some onion and garlic powder, a touch of cayenne and mixed in some panko breadcrumbs.  I also squeezed as much liquid out of the zucchini as possible.  These tasted so much like real crab cakes I couldn't believe it!  My husband loved them as well.  Will definitely add this recipe to my list of dishes.

This wasn't the taste or texture I was hoping for.  Too bland with the recommended amount of spices, but tastes like nothing but Old Bay if you increase that.  Just not my cup of tea I guess.

Wonderful!   I added a can of tuna and MDH went nuts over these.  I didn't have any bread crumbs on hand so I smashed a bag of stove top stuffing!(chicken flavor) Worked great. Will definitely make again.  However, I had a very difficult time keeping them from falling apart.  Any suggestions? ? kblender

I am from Baltimore, Md, and we pride ourselves on crabcakes.  These taste like the inexpensive frozen crabcakes you can buy in the market, or the kind that are served in those "buffet" places, (here we have "Golden Corral").  To a crab afficionado, these taste like filler, but like Connie says, it's a great way to use up that extra zucchini you get at the end of the summer from your garden and friends.  One thing you must do is drain the zucchini.  Put it in a colander with some salt, then squeeze through a tea (terry) towel.  You will only get about one fourth of what you started with.  If you don't like the seeds, scrape them out before you drain the zucchini.  They are a little work, but I think worth it...another thing, don't forget to dredge them in flour before frying, this makes them more like crabcakes...crunchy on the outside.  Thanks Connie, I think it's a great recipe.

I was blown away by this recipe.  I ended up using a bit more of the Old Bay Seasoning, and it was perfect! The mix was extremely wet and difficult to handle, but once it was in the pan it firmed up immediately.  This is a great way to use up all that extra zucchini, especially if you are looking for a fried treat!

Followed recipes as best as possible. I drained zucchini and used a combination of fresh spices on hand. My husband loved it and said it would be good for breakfast, as well. And, he doesn't like zucchini. Thanks for a great new recipe.

Great dish. I think I would not be fooled into thinking that these tasty patties are crab cakes. They don't need to be exactly like crab cakes. They are wonderful as they are. I used cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs (because I have a meat grinder and can smush up a whole box of saltines in no time), and I used Cavender's Greek Seasoning instead of Old Bay (it's a local product, google it). I think I can probably make them without the recipe, now. 

First, don't worry if the batter is a little gushy. It should be barely workable. My suggestion is to make a ball and roll it in the flour on a plate. Put it in the skillet and don't worry about shaping it into a patty. after you turn it you can flatten it out with the spatula. When they are done they should be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, like a crab cake.

The patties are cooling off on my kitchen counter as I write this. 

The patties taste very good.  However the mix was too wet. The patties were falling apart in my hands when I tried to dredge them.

I will try this recipe again but will omit most of the oil and probably add a bit more bread crumbs. I added some salt, pepper and garlic powder because the Old Bay spices alone were not enough to give the mix a punch. Overall, though, a great recipe to adjust to our tastes!

It's been way to hot to turn the oven on and found this recipe and it was perfect. I had zucchini I needed to use and made this up in no time.

I used panko and didn't use the flour,

Fried in Olive oil.

Will made again and Connie- thanks!

Instead of using bread crumbs I used panko crumbs, omitted the old bay and used fresh cilantro. Added 1/4 cup of the frozen mex corn mix and 1/2 cup shredded cooked chicken for a main meal. Drain the shredded zucchini.
Served them w/ Marie's chipolte ranch dressing on the side.

These are a fantastic summer treat. I didn't have any Old Bay Seasoning, so I mad my own concoction of salt and other dried spices I had in my kitchen (garlic salt, chives, oregano, pinch of thyme, cayenne pepper and paprika), which turned out just as well. I also dried the zucchini a bit (sprinkle salt on a batch of paper towels, spread the zucchini on top and set over a strainer sprinkle a little more salt, squeeze lightly to get excess water out when done). I've brought it to several events with a dill-sour cream dip (whip sour cream with a splash of lemon juice and fresh dill), and people love it! Just make sure your patties are flat enough that they cook all the way through, as zucchini can still be pretty wet. Adding a bit of grated cheese (a lighter flavour, mozzarella, etc.) to the mix can be tasty too!

Made this last night. Added 1/2 white potato and a 1/2 of carrot shredded along with the mixture. Had drained it in a collander for at least one hour and then put in the fridge. Continued to pull the liquid out before making the patties. Used some other's advice about baking them. Put them on parchment in a preheated 400 degree oven for 13 minutes on each side. When I went to turn them I sprayed them with olive oil in my "misto". Should have sprayed them on the first side. They were delicious. 4 small zucchini yielded 11 cakes about 2" in diameter. Added one egg, one cup of my homemade whole wheat breadcrumbs and about 1/4 cup of panko, salt, pepper, garlic powder, dash of ground mustard. Great dinner. Thanks

Very simple to put together and good flavor. Definitely should try if you have some extra zucchini about. My husband said, "So there's NO crab in these?"

These crab cakes are DELICIOUS! We made half the batch just as the recipe said and the other half with actual crab meat. I have to say, they are quite good with crab too. The only thing I would change is to use less bread crumbs, they were a bit bready.

Fantastic.  The whole family loved them.  We ate them with a little ranch dressing or horseradish sauce.  Easy to make and a great way to use up the large amounts of zuchini coming from our garden!

Great appetizer, squeeze water from fresh zucchini to make it less watery.  I served with ranch dressing. husband at them with blue cheese.  I formed into balls instead of patties and called them fritters.

I doubled the spice but wish I had added some cayenne. I also subbed minced celery as I have an onion allergy. I really enjoyed these and will definitely be making them again. I used the potato ricer to get most of the liquid out of the zucchini and then wrung it out in a tea towel. I'm going to mix together a bit of harissa paste and mayo for a sauce next time.

Awesome!! My pantry is always missing some important ingriedient in every recipe! I used zesty italian croutons, ground them up and used for the bread crumbs. I took my zucchini and ground it up in the food processor with the onion so it was minced. I also made my own 'old bay' seasoning, added 1tsp of spicy brown mustard and they tasted just like restaurant quality!

These 'crab' cakes are beyond delicious. My husband doesn't care for seafood, so this was a perfect way to get a taste I love without actually using any crab. I've passed this recipe on to my family and friends. They're definitely loved by all.

We have made these for years and they're one of our favorite ways to use zucchini now. We followed other suggestions and bake for about 10 minutes each side rather than deep fry. Double this recipe to freeze leftovers - an easy grab n go lunch. Thank you Patti Jo! I've passed this recipe on to many people.

Came out too wet inside and way too salty for my taste.  I must admit the zucchini's I used from my garden may have caused the water content but I do not think I will use this recipe again.

Can't believe it, but this actually does taste like crab cakes. It wouldn't take the place for any seasoned Marylander, but it's a fantastic way to get rid of excess zucchini or provide a vegetarian-friendly (though not vegan) alternative.

My husband and I are new vegetarians and this is one of our favorites. I often use this as our carb/bread side. I use a generous dose of Old Bay. Also, after shredding the zucchini (and onion and sometimes yellow squash), I wrap in paper towels and squeeze out the water. It's really not a crab cake, but it's one of my go-to dishes!

These were delicious. Not sure if they tast like crab cakes, but they do taste delicious. My husband brought me some Old Bay seasoning when he went on a golfing trip, as we can't get it where I live, so I got to try it. I served low fat sour cream with them, although I intended to serve them with tartar sauce, but I forgot, and the sour cream was great. Next time I would make them thinner because the crispy outside was the best part. Thanks for the great recipe!

These tasted great and the hubby really enjoyed them.  Next time I'll try baking them, though, to get away from the oil.

Made twice. 1st time zucs were too watery. Next time we put in clean dish towel, folded over and twisted like crazy. That worked and they held together well. Very good.

These were easy to make and really delicious. My husband started eating them before I could get them onto buns. We ate them with just ketchup, which was good, but they would be better with some type of creamy sauce on the bun.

I did the 3 serving calculation on this dish - it was PERFECT.  I used a homemade version of Emerils Essence seasoning and it worked great.  I fried these, but next time I'll try baking them.  YUM.

My crab cakes were horrible. They tasted too much like the seasoning which completely ruined the taste. I was very disappointed because I was very excited to try these after reading the reviews. I do not recommend this to anyone.

I followed the recipe exactly and these were amazing! I have made them twice in one week already. A quick meal for my husband and I and impressed our guests as well. They didn't stay together as cakes very well, but they were so good we didn't mind.

I liked these a lot, and my husband almost fell over because he thought they were so good! Although they are nowhere near being like crab cakes. Still, a good way to use up zucchini.

I made these tonight for a potluck, they were a hit with veggie and meat eaters alike!  I followed the suggestions of previous reviewers by salting and pressing the zucchini to reduce moisture.  I also used whole wheat bread crumbs and used 1 1/2 tsp of old bay per batch.  I made a double batch and rolled them a bit smaller to yield about 18 appetizer sized cakes.  Instead of frying, I baked them on a lightly greased cookie sheet at 400 for 10 min, then flipped and baked for another 10 min. I'll definitely make these again!

I enjoyed these very much.  I followed someone's suggestion and froze the patties before I cooked them.  It helped to hold them together while cooking and I didn't have to cook them all.  I still have a few in my freezer and I think I will go cook them up right now.

Hate to be a "nay sayer" with all these great reviews but, if this is a crab cake it's more like the ones that you don't want because they have too much filler. The only possibility I can think of is that I  shredded the zucchini too finely.  My vegetarian husband thought the flavor was good but definitely bready.

the only thing i would change is double up on the bread crumb. one cup is not enough to hold the patty together. very hard to handle. other than that, ive made them twice already!

We call Mondays, "Meatless Mondays" so I am always looking for a great meatless recipe. This was a really tasty and I served as an entree with sweet corn on the cob and a salad with avocados and tomatoes from my garden. I followed the suggestions of others to squeeze out the water in the zucchini in a ricer & to increase the amount of Old Bay by 1/2 a teaspoon. I used seasoned Panko breadcrumbs and rather than frying baked in the oven with a little olive oil in the pan. Came out crispy and not oily. I will definately make again & again.

Mine didn't really stick together to make cakes, they fell apart as soon as they hit the pan. But they made a delicious zucchini mess that I spooned into a bowl to eat.

I basically followed this recipe as written with just a few changes based on other reviews.  Instead of flour I used Panko flakes for an extra crispy texture and added 1 finely diced jalapeno for a little kick.  I baked in the oven to avoid some of the fat content.  Although these tasted good, I felt there was something missing, maybe a sauce of some sort.

I made these the first time today and followed the recipe exactly.  They were absolutely delicious with grilled salmon, corn on the cob and a mango salsa.  We rated them a ten. A keeper recipe.  Next time I would double the recipe and try to freeze some.  Also, I had to wet my hands with cold water to form the last three patties.  I got 8 patties out of this recipe.  Has anyone tried to add a flat can of crab meat to this mixture?  Definitely try the recipe just as it is before playing with it.  The seasoning makes the difference.

These were fabulous! I double the recipe and added a small can of crab meat that had been in my cupboard forever LOL.  After shredding the zucchini I wrapped it in cheese clothes and gave it a good squeeze to get as much water out as possible.  I did not use egg but egg substitute and once I made the patty I very carefully floured them then set them in the hot oil to cook.  They tasted so good!  We all went back for seconds….so much for freezing them.

Ok so in regards to ingredients I followed the recipes completely though I did not fry the cakes, I bake them instead.  While I thought the texture of the cakes was wonderful, the flavor was lacking.  There really just wasn't much of it. It is a great base recipe but needs more flavor.  I used minced regular white onion, but I noticed in a lot of the pictures it looks like people used green onion, that might add more flavor.  The cakes also need a sauce.  Next time I will make a horseradish sauce to compliment them.

The best part of this recipe was the next day. My son has a girlfriend who is a very reserved eater. I fixed these one evening (baked option) when she was over for dinner thinking "She'll probably hate these too".  Instead I was asked for the recipe the next day so her Mom could make them at home! I'm making them tomorrow for the MIL, they're so good!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

These were tasty.  The kids liked them too.  Made them as described using the baking method, not frying.  I made six large pancake sized cakes about 1/4-1/3 inch thick.  After 12-15 min. a side at 400 degrees, they were crisp and tasty.  I would decrease the bread crumbs next time as my son asked if I put soggy bread in!  I used gluten free bread crumbs...perhaps they are heartier in flavor.

followed recipe exactly and was disappointed. very soggy mixture with little taste, either of zucchini or crab! probably would have been better to increase Old Bay and add some salt. used italian bread crumbs which probably were not the best choice for "seasoned" bread crumbs.

These were pretty good, however, I could have used a little more flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly as written, but next time I think I'll add a little parm or romano cheese.

Oh my god, these were the best things ever. I made these for my vegetarian boyfriend and he gobbled all of them up. I partially drained the zucchini, but had no problems with them not sticking together. I will definitely be making these again.

This tasted just like crabcakes! This was a delicious meal! I followed the advice of others by draining the grated zucchini and baking them rather than frying them, as well as adding a small dollop of non-fat mayo on top. This was such a delicious and *healthy* meal! So easy to make, I'll be whipping up some more for family!

I've made these a few times as a side dish.  They are easy to make and taste great.  Not exactly like a real crab cake but I think they are a good imitation.

Fantastic! The perfect combo of fast, easy, and delicious! Definitely drain the zucchini first, though.

These were great, not exactly like crab cakes but the old bay gives it that seafoody spice.  But I would recommend chilling them before frying helps them stay together / not so sticky.  Thanks for posting!!

My family enjoyed these. I followed a previous reviewer's advice and baked them instead of frying. It made the process easier, and they still tasted great.  I would not say that they taste like crab cakes, but they were still good.

Not bad, need to kick up the spices a bit.  Definitely squeeze the shredded zucchini! I'd make again for myself, hubby wasn't too keen on it.

I salted the zucchini, drained it & squeezed it dry - this made the mixture too dry & tough.  I would probably drain it all day and call it done.  Also, there was too much Old Bay (and I love Old Bay).  I got 4 cakes & baked them at 400 for 25 min, flipping half way through.

These are incredible!!! I was looking for a Real crab cake recipe when I stumbled across this recipe, and am I glad I did.... Made the recipe as written but when I taste tested it before forming into patties I felt it needed more Old Bay seasoning, I added a total of 2 1/2 tsp. They received Rave reviews and I am making them again tonight.  Thank You for this recipe, it is simply the best and doesn't cost much to make.

I am from Maryland and we truly value a good crab cake. Although these don't taste exactly like crab cakes; they are AMAZING. I am not a huge fan of vegetables to begin with, so when I am eating them they have to be prepared in a way that I am not thinking about what I am eating. These are perfect for me. My husband loved them as well! MMMMMMM!!!

I made this, and two other recipes during the summer to use up the pile of zucchini from the garden. I added extra onion powder and a little extra hot sauce. I think these are great.. might need some kind of dipping sauce though. Although I do eat meat, I try to limit myself, so these would be a wonderful option for a main dish for vegetarians, or people like me.

Delicious. Subbed the Old Bay seasoning for celery salt and it worked. Ran out of celery salt and have never quite perfected the spices since (I use pepper, salt, cayenne, mixed herbs, paprika and a bit of garlic). I used the baking method as well to keep it healthy. Great as veggie burgers too.

I just made these for the second time, great recipe. My wife is the only vegetarian in the family so it is always a challenge to come up new and interesting meals that the whole family will like. I made a spicy Cajun sour cream dipping sauce that really complimented the “crab” cakes. The second time around I doubled the Old Bay amount and added garlic powder, salt and pepper to taste…most of the family thought there was real crab in it.

Unique use of excess summer squash! I am a crab cake lover (or snob), so even though it is apparent these are to be considered a imitation or poor mans crab cake, I cannot give it 5 stars since crab is not included in the ingredients. The only thing that makes your taste buds even slightly consider them to taste like a crab cake is the Old Bay seasoning which is a staple for crab or seafood dishes. The texture of and the sweet crab meat taste is still sorely missed. But! This is a fun and entertaining use of all that zucchini when we've tired of making bread and casseroles with it! Serve it with a great home made seafood sauce of your liking, close your eyes and dream of crab cakes. You just may trick yourself into believing it is a crab cake you're eating! ;)

Wonderful taste, but doesn't taste like crab cakes.  Enjoyed them.  Ate with a garlic cucumber tzaziki dressing, and it went great with it (leftover from falafel pitas).

Fabulous, fabulous.  We loved these -- made them exactly as directed and they were amazing.  Made other crab cakes from this site at the same time -- they didn't taste nearly as good.  Thanks for posting.  This is a definite keeper!

Through my experiences as a vegetarian, I have often come to find that it is the supporting cast of flavors that really make a dish, rather than the traditional meat component.  The same is true for this recipe.  The zucchini provides the crab-like texture and the supporting cast of flavors combine to produce a "crab-cake"!  Whip up some remoulade sauce and you have the entire package!  I was very impressed with this recipe and will be making it again and again.  I do recommend getting rid of the excess water from the zucchini after grating it though.

These didn't taste remotely like crab to me, but they were very good, and I'll almost definitely make them again.  I didn't have any of the issues with them being very soggy or wet, and I did not do anything to dry out my zucchini, so.. maybe I was just lucky.

These are really tasty zucchini patties even though they don't taste like crab cakes to me.  I'm sure I'll make them often during zucchini season.

I made these last night from memory after seeing the recipe during the day.  Couldn't remember exactly but I was very close.  I didn't dredge in flour and I pan fried in light butter.  I was out of bread crumbs so used crushed saltine crackers.  By mistake, I dumped in a lot of oregano because the top was missing.  I also used garlic powder, salt and pepper (I don't have Old Bay).  They were AWESOME!  I called them "Crabby Patties" and the kids thought they were great, even the fussy neighbour kids that stayed for supper.  Thanks so much for this recipe, it was a delicious (and sneaky) way to get my kids to eat their veggies without complaining.

These were awesome!  I did sweat the zucchini.  I did not use any oil because I baked them instead of frying them.  I also did not use any flour - I just put them on a cookie sheet after shaping them into patties (400 deg, 12 min on each side).  I made a mixture of mayo, sour cream, and hot sauce to dip them in.

I made as is, except instead of dredging the patties, I accidently added the flour to the mixture. Turned out fantastic.

Unique and tasty solution for all that extra summer squash! I squeezed out the water from the zucchini between a few paper towels before combining it with the rest of the ingredients, but the patty mixture was still a bit hard to keep together. They didn't taste like crab to me but my boyfriend & I thought they were delicious nonetheless. Next time I'll add some crushed red pepper for a little heat.

Second time making this, I added a couple of grated carrots. Came out very good!

3rd time. Baked w/no flour. 10 mins per side at 400. Might decrease the temp next time & coop for longer. Also will try leaving out the butter. Used panko bread crumbs.

These were very tasty. I made exactly as recipe was written except while the cakes were frying i sprinkled the tops with extra old bay. I didnt have any problems with them being soggy like some reveiwers did. Great way to use up some zucchini. I will be making these again! Thanks!

These were great!  Not too soggy like others mentioned, but I missed the step of dredging in flour and I accidently mixed the flour and bread crumbs into the mixture, turned out great so not sure if I'll try it the right way next time or not.  I followed advise of adding 1 1/8 tsp. seasoning, I think I'll add closer to 1 3/4 tsp. next time.  Even my daughter who doesn't like zucchini was eating them up! Great recipe.

really fantastic. crispy outside, soft and 'melted cheesy texture' inside. I was worried that they would be flat as there is no 'salt' in the recipe, but I made them as directed and they were perfect - a little chipotle mayo would be perfect with them. Yummy!

These are great! I used whole wheat bread crumbs mixed in, and coated them with panko crumbs. Doubled the Old Bay. I took the advice of another reviewer to bake them at 400 for 12 min. I buttered a foil lined pan and baked them a bit longer. Crispy, not greasy! I didn't strain the zucchini and had no problem. Great with heirloom tomatoes!!!

I didn't have Old Bay seasoning so used a garlic and herb blend, added some parmesan cheese to the mixture and added some extra garlic powder to the flour.  EXCELLENT!!!

Very tasty and easy to make. I agree that the batter is very difficult to handle and will try next time to make it stick together better. I will be making these regularly!

my mom came over with a ton of zucchini, and i had to find something to do with it, so i decided to try this recipe. Holy moly! i made them for dinner last night for my son and myself, and had a few left over.. my husband found them and ate them, and told me they were amazing. (he ate them cold, right out of the fridge. lol) Everyone liked them so much, i made them again today for lunch.  The first time i made them with dried onion flakes and no old bay, and the second time i used frozen (sauteed) onions and did use the old bay. they were both sooo good. My 2 year old, Mr. Anti-veggie, ate 2 whole patties by himself today in one sitting.  I will make these often, and will try to use other kinds of veggies, too, to switch it up. I try recipies in this site all the time, and there are very very few that are worth rating, but this is one of them. thank you!!

This recipe has become a summer tradition in our family.  Though we would never presume to think these could ever replace crab cakes, these are just too yummy not to make time and time again.Thank you, Patti Jo, for submitting yet another fantastic way to use what my garden abundantly produces!

Really good way to use up zucchini from the garden.  Served it with either lite sour cream  or applesauce.  Used shallots instead of onions and added some parmesan.  Will make again and again until zucchini season is finally over!

Needed more seasoning as written, but that may be because I had to continue wringing moisture out of the mixture even as I was making it into cakes so I'm sure I lost some of the old bay down the drain.  Next time I would shred the zucchini earlier and let it sit a lot longer to drain it's moisture out.  Nevertheless, this is a winner way to eat up zucchini.  I used the baking method, rather than frying, which was healthier and worked great!

Soooooooooooo good. I had some zucchini and yellow squash so I used both in this recipe. I also put in some paprika ( I like everything spicy). It turned out very tasty. My two year old son gobbled it down in minutes. This recipe is a definite keeper.

Great! Reading other reviews I pressed the zucchini between a couple of paper towels to get rid of the excess water. Turned out great. Even my husband (a dedicated meat eater) liked it. : )

These were good, however, rather than using wheat flour as the binder, I suggest using masa (corn flour). It has a mildly sweeter taste that is more in keeping with the sweet meat of the Maryland Blues used in making the authentic Maryland crab cake.

Great recipe.There isn't any 'Old Bay' seasoning here where I live so I just used salt and a little bit of pepper and it still turned out to be a great dinner.

Made just as-written. It was good, but tasted best when eaten with a spinach salad w/ veggies and ranch dressing. I don't think it tasted like real crab cakes, but close enough for what I was expecting from this recipe.

I bought enough zucchini (not intentional) to make the recipe for 12 servings! So I gave some to 3 different people and they all loved them.  Only thing I would do differently which one person agreed with is to add more Old Bay seasoning.  Otherwise, these are delicious.  In fact, my son thought I had added crab meat to the recipe.

I halved the zucchini and added half flaked imitation crab and I haven't found anyone who doesn't like it yet! Even people who say they don't like crab! And I love that it's a much healthier version! Thanks for adding it!

I was a bit skeptical but thought so many good reviews can't be wrong.  I was pleasantly surprised!  Didn't have Old Bay, so used a Blackening Spice blend instead.  I salted and drained the zucchini and then squeezed out the water in a dish towel.  Served the cakes with chipotle mayonnaise.  Now I can't wait for the zucchini in my garden to mature.

My family thought these were wonderful. Only thing I changed was the seasoning. I used 2 tsp of Old bay and added some garlic and salt to my flour. I just couldn't dredge them in plain flour, lol. I made cocktail sauce for a dip. I will certainly be making these again. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Pretty good. I even made a gluten free batch for my husband. Definitely a zucchini recipe and not at all like crab. I put 1.5x's the old bay instead of doubling and I'm glad because it was a bit salty with that much. I added fresh pepper and think the flavor is good.  Not sure how to get them more 'firm' in the center. They were crispy on the outside but pretty soggy on the inside, even after draining the zuch.

Super tasty!!  I was so paranoid about them being soggy that I think I rang out the zucchini too much.  Next time I won't try to get so much moisture out of it and I'll make the patties bigger.  I did them on an olive oil basted cookie sheet in the oven.  If you put ketchup on them, they actually taste seafoody!

Being a vegetarian for about 12 years, I really don't remember what crab cakes actually taste like. These were really good though! I also baked them instead of frying them.

These are very good.  I used 1 zucchini & 1 yellow squash.  I baked the patties as one reviewer suggested, using what I thought was quite a bit of oil on the pan, and they stuck to my baking sheet.  After I flipped them, I added a bit more oil, and after that they shaped up just fine.  I should have drained the liquid off the zucchini first, as suggested, because the mixture was VERY moist.  When I was forming the patties with my hands, I squeezed some of it out, but doing this I also lost some of the butter and egg.  So, 4 stars for being yummy but a pain to make.  In the end though, they were well worth the hassle.  Very tasty recipe!

The biggest mistake I made was adding an extra teaspoon of Old Bay...I found the end result too salty (but not inedible; I served it with sliced tomatoes, cucumber, and corn on the cob--a perfect end-of-summer feast!) & my husband made sandwiches out of the patties & tomato slices, calling the flavor too "zesty".  That was my mistake though.  Thanks for the yummy vegetarian main dish!

These cakes were great.  I'm from Maryland so I never set myself up to think they would taste like Maryland crab cakes.  But another Marylander wrote that they did taste like the frozen kind - this was true.  I veered on a few things, but here they are: 

added 1/2 tsp of garlic salt
doubled the old bay
used panko bread crumbs
chopped onion 

The cakes were pretty soggy (even though I sopped up the juices before I mixed everything together).  So I added a little flour to the mixture (2 tsp).  Stirred well, and then dreged the cakes in the flour.  I let them sit for a while to soak up moisture and then dredged again before frying.

Pretty tasty, although it doesn't really taste like a crab cake to me. I tried baking rather than frying to cut down on fat. It worked ok, but I think I'll fry them next time. Also, it is a little salty--I may try making my own Old Bay to cut down off the salt. I'll probably make these again when I have zucchini that needs eating.

I've made this quite a few times now since I originally rated the recipe. I always bake them at 400 degrees for 13 minutes on each side. I use the Fred Meyer/Kroger brand of seasoned bread crumbs. My kids ONLY like these if I use half shredded yellow/crook-neck squash. My husband prefers them this way as well. I don't really notice a difference, but they certainly do. I don't use Old Bay, because I think they are great without it. This is definitely a keeper!

I was so happy with these cakes!  I forgot the butter in the microwave, and they turned out great without it.  Good way to save a few calories.  I also opted to bake the cakes instead of frying and added some finely diced red peppers.  Great, healthy meal option.

Very good.  Squeezing the water from the zucchini is a must.  Just use your hands and squeeze the water over the sink.  I refrigerate the patties for at least 30 minutes before frying.  I also roll (really more like pat) them into breadcrumbs instead of flour.  Made a couple times in the last week and will make again for sure.

This is a nice starter recipe. Definitely needs more Old Bay. Sauteed celery, onion, and red bell pepper would be nice too.

I took into consideration the tips offered and made it with other spices on hand as I didn't have Old Bay Seasoning.  I also baked instead of pan frying.  I froze them to be reheated later, and they were pretty good.  Not at all crab-like, but for a friend who can't have crab, it was a nice meal.

I've made this twice in about a week. I think this recipe is great.  Easy to make & uses up alot of zucchini.  I used about 1/2 cup of mixture per cake & doubled the recipe.  The left overs heat up well.

Awesome.  I ended up squeezing water out of the zucchini between two layers of paper towels.  By the time we got to the table, only 1 or 2 were left.  My boyfriend sneakily ate several, and then took a few to his father next door.  Also, I love the floavor of Old Bay on anything.  It reminds me of my time spent in Delaware.  Thanks for the recipe.

As a vegetarian I don't know what a true crab cake tastes like but these were and interesting change from the typical veggie fritter.  I took the advise of another and squeezed the water out of the zucchini after shredding it.  I also used Italian style bread crumbs and I baked them.  Whatever you do DON'T add any salt, the Old Bay has plenty!  The resipe was a 5 star for simplicity but the taste gets only 3 stars.

This was just Ok. I cooked my patties on the griddle and barely used any oil for cooking. Im sorry, but my family all agreed that the cheesey "Zucchini Patties" from this site is better. Thx.

I thought these were great!  While I'd never get them mixed up with actual crab cakes (the texture just will not allow it!), the flavor was perfect.  I did press out some of the liquid as other reviewers suggested.  I also added a little bit of lemon zest and some fresh parsley, because I had it in my garden.  I fried them in a shallow layer of oil and butter, and served them with a sauce of mayonnaise, lemon juice and dill.  Yum!!

These were really good. Quick and easy to make also. Great way to use up the extra zucchini this time of year. Tasted like a potato pancake a little bit. my husband put apple sauce on his.

Fantastic!  Add a little cayenne for spice if you want.  We tried to bake it, but it was a little mushy, so we finished it with frying.  Wonderful!

After I shredded the zucchini I squeezed the water out just with my hands. Then I set it in a colander with a couple dashes of salt for about 15 minutes. The zucchini was PERFECT for frying at that point. Otherwise I made the recipe as is except I used I can't believe it's not butter spray (didin't have any actual butter on hand) and I forgot to dredge the patties in the flour. Even with the changes they were phenomenal!! Must try!!

This one gets a RAVE review from me!!! I made these exactly as the recipe indicated.  I did squeeze all of the liquid from the grated zucchini. They came out great.  I honestly do not care for zucchini AT ALL. Several were given to me and I felt bad just throwing them away.  I am amazed at just how good these are -- I will definitely make these again. My very picky eleven year old son loves seafood and I fooled him with these. Thank you for a super recipe.

These are excellent!  Not JUST like crab cakes, but so good, who cares!?!?!  I did squeeze the juice out and increased the Old Bay to 2 tsp.  Served with Super Al's Cocktail Sauce from this site (which was also fantastic)!

Wow these are really good.  I could not find zucchini so I used eggplant.  I grated the eggplant in food processor added fresh made bread crumbs, 2 eggs, butter,onion, old bay, and rolled in flour like the recipe said. I baked them in the oven at 400 degrees 15 -20 min on each side. They turned out crispy and moist inside. I did ring the water out of the eggplant like the other viewers reccomended.  I would make these again.  Yum Thanks Connie for a great appitizer

My first written review.  I love this recipe.  I tried it once as written, then tried it again trying to make it a little lower in calories.  I added a little more onion (I just like onion), I omitted the butter and added an additional egg white.  I also added a dash of garlic powder (I did not dredge in flour).   Instead of frying in oil, I used non stick spray on a low heat until browned and cooked through.  It tasted the same as the original version.  Just a bit healthier on an already healthy meal.  Thank you!!!

The taste was good, but it wasn't the taste I was expecting. I did increase the Old Bay as suggested by others. I will make again but without the expectation of "crab" cake. Crab cake texture but not taste.  Tasty zucchini patty regardless.

This recipe is so great I have been sharing it with everyone. The zucchini is so plentiful right now and it is a good way to use it up. 
We have been eating these a few times a week and using various dips. I like to add fresh garlic to the recipe and more spices. It seems as though I change the recipe around every time I make it. I sauté in EV olive oil every time instead of frying in oil. They always come out wonderful with or without flour. One time I didn’t even have the eggs and they were still good. I would recommend over and over.

I absolutely loved this recipe!  It really is clever.  I am not a seafood lover, but have always loved crabcakes!  I didn't have the OB seasoning, and they came out so good.  Next time I will try it with all of the proper ingredients.  This will be in heavy rotation this summer to use up my heavy zucchini supply!

WOW. That's about all I can say. We followed the recipe exactly as it said and they came out PERFECT. Pretty easy, too--we just threw the veggies in a chopper and mixed everything into one big bowl--how easy is that? Anyway, these are a great veggie alternative to crab cakes, had an absolutely yummy texture to them, and were great on toasted wheat buns.

These were delicious and really did taste like crab cakes!  I served with homemade tartar sauce.  The mixture was too thin to shape into patties and dredge so I just added a little whole wheat flour to thicken and dropped onto my hot griddle with a big scoop and flattened.  I made a double batch thinking I'd freeze half but my family ate all but 4!!!  Great zucchini recipe...Thank you!

Well, it's zucchini time in the garden again! Came across this recipe looking for something new to try....and this is great! Followed the recipe except I did salt and drain the shredded zucchini first as suggested by others. And for some idiotic reason I dumped the flour in the mixture and skipped the dredging in flour step. These were very easy to work with and they browned up beautifully. I did add tons more Old Bay because we like it spicy. Served with a green salad and homemade tartar sauce. My 10 year old just loved these, she even cleaned up all the loose bits of zucchini on everyone's plates.  She has requested that I make this once a week. We'll see.....

very good!  Fried is better than baked.  I followed reviewers' advice to double the Old Bay but it was too spicy but family really liked them anyway.

We loved the flavor and concept of these, but the texture was pretty far away from ideal.  I felt, in retrospect, that the butter made the mixture greasy, and they were difficult to handle, since it was so moist. They fried up very soft, heavy, and soggyish in the middle, even after I pressed and drained the zucchini. It's a fantastic idea, we liked the flavor, and are looking forward to having something similar again when our zucchini bumper crop comes in, but I want to mess with the recipe more, make them lighter, crispier, and less squishy inside.  Thanks very much for the jumping off point!

This was a good recipe. I used the baking method and it turned out nice and crispy on the outside, soft and yummy on the inside. I would have given it a better rating, but I thought it needed more Old Bay and/or some heat. After I used a little hot sauce it was delish. I think they would be good as a sandwich too. A lot of options, great with corn on the cob and a few beers. Mmm, beer.

Wonderful! I didn't change a single thing. These were sooo good! I was really surprised. If you're on the fence about making these, do it! Next time I will probably bake them, just to make them a bit lighter. Thanks!

Really good and easy.  I made sure that I squeezed the liquid from the zucchini before i did anything else to it.  They held up well and tasted almost like the real thing!

Personally, I don't think these zukie cakes resemble crab cakes at all, HOWEVER, they are a great zucchini cake! They taste great, have a nice texture, and are pretty versatile. You can change the seasonings to match whatever you're making for dinner, you can bake or fry them, and even the kids love them.

We've come up with a variation that minimizes the mess and makes them appealing to the kids at the same time: Muffin Tins. We call them Zucchini Cupcakes, and serve them as a side dish. We've also had them on a bed of baby spinach salad with Newman's balsamic dressing.

Overall, we love these little cakes--crabby or not!

Yum! A few suggestions: salt/drain the zucchini first. To avoid the raw zucchini/onion taste, saute the squeezed zucchini and onion for a few minutes before forming cakes.

These were awesome. I used this recipe to s-t-r-e-t-c-h crab cakes. I had a party and wanted crab cakes and this was a way to make my ingredients go further. I doubled the recipe and added a large can of crab meat from Trader Joes. Also, I did what others noted and baked in oven on a sprayed cookie sheet and flipped half way through. I will make these again.

People, you can't be serious. Of course these won't taste like real crab cakes, a little Old Bay won't magically transform zucchini into crab... BUT it doesn't even matter because these little babies are SO good!  Don't be skeptical- if you have lots of extra zuccs and nothing to do with them because you've already made a bazillion loafs of zucchini bread (my situation), MAKE THIS RECIPE!  My mom and I raved and high-fived about these for atleast a week after we made them.

This was pretty good - and easy too! I took the advice of another reviewer & baked them instead of frying. Just make sure you have enough bread crumbs (I ran short), otherwise your patties will be soggy & hard to handle. ps. If you don't have Old Bay seasoning, there are recipes for it on the internet. It was easy enough to mix my own from the spices I had on hand. Good recipe for a week night!

Not being a zucchini fan, I really didn't expect to like this - but I did, and so did my family. No, it doesn't really taste like crab cakes, but it does come close! I pretty much followed the recipe, although I did add an extra teaspoon of Old Bay to the filling, and a teaspoon to the flour coating. I also increased the bread crumbs to 1 and 1/2 cups. After draining the grated zucchini, I squeezed it between paper towels to remove excess liquid, which worked well. I assembled these the day before and refrigerated them over night. They held together very well. I also thinly sliced a whole lemon, and sauteed it in the pan along with the zucchini. Very tasty! Thanks for the recipe; I'll be making these again!

We loved it - but due to a communication error my son grated cucumbers instead of zuchinni for this recipe.  (That was why it took more crumbs than it should LOL!) We look forward to doing it again with zuchinni.

My vegetarian husband loved these - even ate them as leftovers (!). I followed other reviewers' advice and added more Old Bay seasoning, but they were a little too salty for me. Next time I'll add more onion, maybe some shredded carrot and the normal amount of Old Bay. I also baked them - much healthier and just as yummy!

Does not taste like crab, but was great vegetarian alternative. My husband loved them and he doesn't like zucchini!I used the baking modifications posted by another reviewer, I also added 1/4 cup more bread crumbs and drained the zucchini before mixing it in. Plan on making again.

I love making these in the summer when you can buy fresh zucchini on the produce stands.  So tasty when they are crispy, so don't take them out of the oil too soon.

Very easy to make and delicious!  It's easy on the budget and much healthier than the real thing!  I added some chopped green bell pepper I had on hand.  Tasty!

I can't say enough about this recipe.  I love crabcakes, but don't eat them often because of the cost of crabmeat.  The bay seasoning really fools you to think there is crabmeat in them.  I love them, as does my husband and 16 month old.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

YUM!
I used my food processor to shred the zucchini, doubled the amount of Old Bay and used chopped red onion. Put it on a Light hamburger bun w/a homemade thousand island dressing. For someone on weight watchers, this was a satisfying, almost indulgent meal. Will definitely make again.

I really liked this recipe.  I made it twice in one week.  I took someone's advice who had already reviewed the recipe and added an extra teaspoon of Old Bay Seasoning.  It was just right.

I made this dish last night and it was terrific! I didnt have the Old Bay Seasoning, but I looked it up and found the recipe: (1tbsp celery seeds, 1 tbsp black peppercorns, 6 bay leaves, 1/2 tsp cardamoms, 1/2 tsp mustard seeds, 4 cloves, 1 tsp Paprika, 1/4 tsp mace.) From the suggestions of other reveiwers, i squeezed the liquid out of the grated zucchini in a cloth over the sink. I fried the patties in olive oil and it was very very good. I would definitley make this again!

I tried this last night and my husband and I loved it.  I followed the recipe just as it was with no problems. I squeezed the water out of the zucchini.  After frying them I put them on onion buns, added bacon, onions and pepper jack cheese then broiled for a few minutes.  Then I added tomato and tartar sauce.  I will definitely make again!

I made these and accidentally added the 1/4 cup flour in with the mixture!  So I still dredged the patties in flour and browned - they were delicious!  None of the "falling apart" that many reviewers described.  I would, however, use flavored breadcrumbs next time (I used plain), and maybe add more old bay or garlic, etc.  I thought they could have used a little more flavor.  My kids actually ate them, and they thought they were crab cakes.  This recipe is a keeper!

I really liked this, as did my husband.  He thought it tasted like crab cake, but I only thought it did a little (maybe the green zucchini kept me from truly believing!)  I did follow some other reviewers and here's how I did it:  used seasoned bread crumbs (some herb, some 3 cheese, and some plain), improvised for Old Bay by following some others' suggestions, and going to McCormicks website to find the ingredients to Old Bay, which fortunately I had almost everything in my cabinet, then coated patties with plain bread crumbs, and baked at 350 for about 10-15 min each side.  I did cut my zucchini the night before, but hardly got any water out.  My patties were slightly on the dry side (not bad, I just was expecting almost mush based on other reviews!) and held together very well.  Don't know how leftovers will be yet, but I am definitely thankful for this recipe to help ease my zucchini burden (we ate this dish tonight with steamed zucchini and had zucchini bread for dessert--lots of zucchini growing in our neighborhood to eat up)!

really tasty!! I added more Old Bay, some garlic and a little imitation crab.  Also, squeezing the zucc over the sink worked well for me.  My husband ate them at room temp and thought they were great as well.  Also put some sweet hot mustard on top for zip!!

This is SO GOOD!  We didn't think they tasted like crab cakes, but we still loved them--a new way to serve all of that zucchini!  I always try to make things as light as I can, so I omitted the butter and used egg substitute-all else was the same.  I've never made the original, but I wouldn't because it is excellent this way and we're saving a few calories.

Really good. Added a few extra little spices - garlic, salt and pepper, etc.. Cooked them in EVOO. A great way to use the tons of zukes I grow.

these have been certified as very good by all who tried mine!  if you'd like to "kick it up" with spice, add Mortons Hot Salt, and reduce the amount of Old Bay just a tad.

I thought this recipe was a good use for extra zucchini, but it wouldn't be my first choice.  The cakes were good but not spicy enough for my taste nor cleverly enough disguised to fake out my children who won't touch zucchini!

Everyone loved the flavor of these cakes! I think I made mine a little too thick but they were crispy on the outside and eggy/hot on the inside. Will make again, but maybe just less than half an inch thick next time.

My boyfriend "hates" zucchini so I had to sneak these by him.  Well, he liked them so much he asked what they were and I had to admit they were made from zucchini.  He said they taste almost like something else.  "Crabcakes?" I asked.  "That's it!" he said then asked for seconds. He asked if I had any left the next evening.  (Out of about a dozen mini-cakes, I ate 3.)  He even bought zucchini so I could make more!

NOT the best zucchini patty/pancake I've ever tasted.  AND it DIDN'T taste like a crab cake.  Oh, well.  I'm going to see if I can doctor this one up somehow - I was really expecting something great.  My boyfriend agrees that they are "ok."  I'll try it again, but will probably stick to my family's recipe.  Thanks for sharing anyway.

TASTY!!!!  Must "squeeze out" the zucchini though, as suggested previously.  Will make again.

We had these with shrimp scampi and wild rice.  They were really good.  I ended up adding a little more old bay seasoning and bread crumbs.

Made this for my vegan brother and neice (a couple of substitutions)and my Chesapeake Bay native boyfriend...It passed the taste test as zucchini cakes but not as crab. I drained and drained the zucchini and still ended up with a gloppy mess. The taste saved it from being a total disappointment and we may make it again just because it does use up zucchini in an unique way.

no probelm keeping them together.  Used the suggestion of another reviewer to rub hands with flour before forming patties.  The taste was great and made a great side dish.

My husband was a little skeptical, but he really loved these zucchini cakes.  They do turn out awfully green.  Maybe I will peel the zucchini next time before grating it, but then I think a lot of the nutrients would be lost.  I added a little dry mustard to the mix, and it made the cakes even more yummy.

This is a wonderful recipe and a great way to use my garden zucchini.  No one can tell they are not the real thing!  Even fooled my teenage daughter who "hates" zucchini!! I modified it a bit by blending in some of the ingredients in another recipe I love from Martha Stewart.  I added minced jalapeno pepper, dijon mustard, and cilantro.  Then made a chili-lime aoli for dipping.  I'll be making them again this weekend for a barbecue we have been invited to.

I thought that these were great! One thing that you have to do is drain the shredded zucchini otherwise the patties will not hold together.

I was a little leery about how much it would taste like a crab patty, but someone unloaded some large zucchini on me so I had to do something with them.  They were wonderful!
My husband wondered if freezing some shredded zucchini in the chest freezer would enable us to enjoy these in the winter months.

These were the hit of the evening.  I made the mixture early in the morning, refrigerated it and fried them as an appetizer.  Now, I realize I forgot the butter.  They were great!  My son wanted to know how much crabmeat I used!  Thank you!  Since I have quite a bit of zucchini still to harvest, I'll make them again...using butter this time.  Again, just great!

I guess if you haven't ever had REAL Maryland crab cakes, these would taste like a crab cake...however kind of bland.  Not horible, but nothing great either.  These were hardly touched on the dinner table, and we all love our vegetables.  I won't be making them again.

I had alot of people at work that were wondering what to do with all the zucchini they had. I noticed this recipe and gave it to 2 people to try. By the time the week was out I had printed out 10 more copies for others. Everyone who has tried this is raving about it.

Yesterday I picked more zucchini than I imagined I would have at this point in the year...I logged on to this website, used this recipe (at 10:00 last night), and my husband and I enjoyed an almost "midnight snack" of Connie's Zucchini Crab Cakes!  They were great as a snack, would be great as a side dish, and I even enjoyed a few leftovers for breakfast!  Really easy to make!  Great use for all of the zucchini piling up on the countertop!  I will pass this recipe on to my mom and sister!  We loved them!

I have made these many times, with some modifications. I grate some carrot and mix it with the zucchini - it adds color and flavor. And definitely spread out the zucchini on some paper towels first so it isn't too mushy. I broil instead of frying, and don't use the flour- just mix everything together and shape into patties.

I was intrigued by this recipe and had to try it.  Although we didn't feel they tasted like crab cakes, they were very good in their own right.  I plan to make them again, especially when the garden yields a bumper crop of zucchini.

As I was making these last night, I was thinking they were going to be a miserable failure because it was like patting wet mush.  However, to my amazement, they fried beautifully to a crisp and tasted delicious.  My husband loved them also.  Next time I will take other reviewers' advice  by adding salt to the zucchini and letting sit for a bit (to help lessen the water); increase the Old Bay; and chill the patties an hour or so before frying.

I've made these many times. They are very tasty. They taste just like the real thing! The zuchinni isn't obvious at all when eaten, and even my six year old brother ate these! What a great addition to the recipe blog!

These are delicious, also by adding real blue crab meat tastes even better, and can stretch crab meat a long way and people will not even notice!

Made exactly as directed. I used "hot" Old Bay and the seasoning was perfect. I tried the oven method (as recommended by another reviewer) but preferred the recipe exactly as written.

I didn't have any Bay Seasoning so I substituted steak seasoning and it tasted great. I served them with sausages and home-made zucchini-pepper relish.

this was sooo good I did make adjustment when I normally make crab cakes I add peppers so  I added peppers a whole onion which I cooked a little before adding it to mixture. I added garlic Italian bread crumbs  and I season to smell (I can smell if it needs more lol) I cooked some on the stove top and some in the oven both turned out good the ones on stove top was crispier.

Love this recipe! Per other suggestions I up the amount of old bay and I bake these in the oven. I have given up on dredging them with flour since I bake them instead of fry. I just scoop and dump onto a pan and nudge in the approximation of a patty. Sometimes I through some mozzarella in the mix. Great way to use up zucchini!

Per another suggestion, I baked it at 400 for 30 minutes, flipping halfway through. It was excellent and required nearly zero oil. I also was able to skip the flour. I would use a little less salt next time, but it was otherwise delicious.

This is a very good recipe.  I have made other zucchini crab cakes and they did not stay together as good as this one did.  I added more Old Bay and they were delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent recipe - instead of flour i used pancake mix, used only 1/2 c of breadcrumbs, and also added 1/2 tsp of baking powder - they puff up a bit more and look more like crab cakes.  I also added a shredded carrot for a little more color.

I took the advice of someone and increased the old bay to 1 & 1/2 tsp. and the bread crumbs to 1 & 1/8 cup....I've never ordered crab cakes as I think it's a waste of crab, but to me, the texture when making patties and the texture when eating probably resembles a crab cake...the recipe made 7  (3" to 4"patties). I fried them in coconut oil as I love the stuff....I'd guess about 3 minutes on each side til golden brown and crunchy....delicious...
   Make SURE you get as much liquid out of the zucchini as possible, otherwise they are too soft and don't get crispy....someone suggested a potato ricer and this worked great!

These are great! Coming from MD where crab cakes are king, I wasn't sure what to expect.  Marylander's - these cakes are not like the MD style crab cakes we're used to but the flavor of these are great so give it a try.  I love the zing from the onion and old bay.  Even my husband who doesn't like veggies or crab cakes was impressed.  I kept the ingredients the same but I baked the cakes instead.  Per another review, I baked them at 400 for 12-15 min on each side and they turned out great.  I made a double batch to freeze half and I'm glad I did!  Thanks for the recipe.

These were very good! I drained the zucchini with a bit of salt until it was good and dry. I froze the patties for an hour just to help hold their shape and then I drizzled them with oil and baked them at 400 for 15 mins per side. I also threw it on broil for 3 mins to crisp up. They were still semi soft in the middle so they didn’t feel like a crab cake, but the taste was there!

Fabulous recipe! I made it for supper last night and was skeptical as far as thinking it actually might taste like crab cakes...well, it was pretty darn close.

I did squeeze out the wetness of the zucchini with paper towels and also added a little extra Old Bay and bread crumbs (Progresso herb and garlic). I also used a little more onions (minced green onions) than a quarter cup. I refrigerated the patties for around a half hour, then fried them until they were crispy on both sides. My picky hubby gobbled them right up and loved them! Me too! We’ve got a winner here, folks ??

Very good and I baked at 400 degrees 10-15 per side instead of frying.  Thanks for the recipe.  I had a lot of shredded frozen zucchini and this will make a great side or main dish to use it instead of baking breads.

I make it often, with several changes.  I squeeze the excess liquid out of the zucchini with paper towels. I use scant 1 cup Ian’s brand gluten free panko crumbs in place of the breadcrumbs.  I use dried minced onions, non GMO.   I use the low sodium Bay Seasoning TM, and dredge my cakes in  less than 1/4g cup gluten free flour . It’s very different from the original, and very difficult to tell it is gluten free because it is not gummy. These are conveniently made the day before and put into the refrigerator.  Great option if you limit or omit gluten!

Wow!  amazing.  I had to make my own version of Old Bay seasoning and I didn't have bread crumbs so used mazel meal but about half the amount---and they did stick together--I tested as per another reviewer's advice. Then I mixed panko and flour for the outside and baked in the over--with quite a bit of oil and it was great!

I make these every summer!  Really enjoy them AS WRITTEN, but this year I'm trying to get away from gluten, so I used corn flour and 2 eggs, had a pepper on the counter top, so diced that in too...Excellent.  One other thing is that I now shred the zucchini a day early...its easier to handle if its dryer.

I also make a home made creamy garlic dressing to eat them with...they need something for a little zing...(crushed fresh garlic, chives, sour cream, mayo and heavy cream--or milk).

These were unbelievably good--so good we're considering adding mini versions as a Thanksgiving appetizer! Made these Gluten Free (GF) using GF bread crumbs (plain) and GF all purpose flour. Tonight, some were stolen from my meat loving husband! I've never had crab cakes, but he has and claims the texture was perfect! Of course, noticeably missing the crab, but he wants them again. I used Jan's Old Bay Seasoning (from this site and reduced amount of celery salt), but other than that, made as written. This is a keeper for us and will make again! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I utilized the frozen, shredded zucchini that was in my freezer (3 cups- unpeeled).  It worked well.  These patties are nice and crisp, even after being refrigerated.  I used a large cookie scoop (4 tsp) to make even balls then flattened,and floured.  The moisture from the Zucchini is needed to make dough balls.  I would at least double the bay seasoning next time.  I think this recipe would work well with other spices such as chili powder.

Yummy.   Used 1 TBLS Old Bay...will use less next time.   Used panko instead of flour, sprayed with canola oil on foil and grilled about 7 minutes per side.  Turned out excellent.   Made 6 patties.  Served with a sauce of 1/2 c. Mayo, 1/3 cup roasted red peppers, 1 t. Cayanne.  1/2 cup breadcrumbs, no flour or panko.  Cook in airfryer 20 minutes.

LOVE!  its a hit every time I serve it.  Great alternative to the real thing,  Great recommendation MANDT2  to cook it in the oven and will definitely try that next time.  I appreciate the alternative to frying.

These are delicious!  A great way to enjoy the flavor of crab cakes without the crab!   I make them a lot during the summer and my meat-loving husband loves them too.  I add 1/2 tsp. more of the Old Bay than the recipe calls for; makes the flavor perfect for me.  Thanks for sharing this, Patti Jo!

My only complaint is we wanted more when they were gone! I followed the recipe exactly. They were deliciously crispy on the outside with a wonderfully tasty moist inside. My husband (who is not vegetarian) made sarcastic remarks when I told him what I was making for dinner. But once he tried one he came back for more! Then was disappointed after they were gone.

I double the recipe and took changes from previous reviews. After shredding the zucchini add a little salt and let it rest for 30mins. I also but a little old bay in the flour. I did bake them at 400 degrees (15 mins on each side). Added more seasoning as well garlic powder, black pepper and parsley. 

This is definitely a keeper

I've made these several times. I always add more Old Bay, as this makes them taste more "crabby".. Today, I took the advice of several reviewers: I squeezed the liquid from the zucchini with a potato ricer, and I baked them (thanks, MANDT2). I spooned the mixture into greased muffin tins, and baked at 400 degrees, for about 20 minutes.  I let them cool for about 10 minutes before removing from the  muffin tins. Turned out great.

I made these  exactly as stated and they were amazingly delicious. !  I was tempted to add some salt and pepper, but I am glad I didn't, these patties were nicely seasoned just with the Old Bay.
I used 2 medium size zucchinis . I grated them over 2 layers of paper towels. then I wrapped the paper towels around  them and squeeze between the palm of  my hand, over the sink. This way, I was able to get rid of most of the zucchini juice.

I had a bunch of extra zucchini that needed using. I followed the instructions exactly except baked instead of fried (and also pushed a lot of water out of the zucchini using paper towels), and they were really delicious. I've never actually eaten a crab cake, so don't personally have a basis for comparison, but I found these quite delicious, even though I don't like zucchini. 

My bf who really loves seafood also enjoyed them very much.

Excellent.  I did make a few changes like adding more Old Bay, dry mustard, cayenne, salt and pepper, onion powder, garlic powder.  I made them ahead and formed the patties then baked at 400 for about 15 mins per side spraying with olive oil Pam, flipping at least once.  They are very good!

I made it according to the recipe except I added a little more Bay Seasoning. It was delicious and I will be making it again tonight. 
The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 stars is it really didn't taste like a crab cake to me. I am from Maryland so I am pretty fussy about my crab cakes.

My family loved it!! I made it last night with a nice side salad for our Meatless Monday meal, great alternative and great for guests that don't eat meat . for small gatherings,  but next time i will use a lighter oil maybe peanut oil, grapseed or olive oil. I think the canola oil was a little too heavy for this dish.

They definitely wouldn't have fooled me as crabcakes but they were pretty good. I might try baking them next time. They soaked up a lot of oil (and yes, the oil was plenty hot when I threw them in).

I didn't put in the cheese. I put in 3/4 c of bread crumbs and 2 eggs. Didn't dredge in flour. Used salt, pepper and fresh garlic instead of seafood seasoning (which I didn't have)
The changes meant less calories and the taste was GREAT!

These were delicious!  I am trying to eat healthier and my 24 yr old, picky daughter came to me with this recipe.  She actually made them and now wants to make a double batch to eat and freeze.  My very picky husband even ate one!  :)
We will be baking them next time thanks to the review from MANDT2, thank you.

I really enjoyed this, but I'm not sure how close it tastes to crab cake, as I'm allergic to crab. I didn't have old bay so I seasoned it with curry, garlic powder, onion powder and cayenne, because I really enjoy those spices. Turned out great, next time I'll try baking it instead of frying.

These were amazing. I made it to the recipe exactly and was so impressed. They tasted just like crab cakes! The aroma of them cooking was so enticing I barely made it through the cooking time without sampling one. I honestly love this recipe and it's going in my print recipe book on the counter to save forever!

These are so good. I added flour to mixture (oops) then used more to dredge with and it was fine.

This recipe sounds wonderful, and according to the reviews, I can't wait to try it.  One question:  reading the ingredients list, then the instructions, one says "bread crumbs", the other says, "add SEASONED bread crumbs."  Is it seasoned bread crumbs or not, and if so, what flavor seasoned bread crumbs????

My husband calls this dish "crabless" cakes and he loves it! I follow the recipe as written except I no longer add the butter. It's just as good without it.

Very good!  I did add cheese which we love.  Also, I mixed the ingredients and decided I would bake rather than fry.  I patted the whole mixture into a square, cut it into smaller squares, and put them on an oiled baking sheet.  I sprayed oil on the top, and baked at 400 degrees for about 10 minutes, flipped the pieces, and baked for another 8-10 minutes until well browned.  A keeper!

I made these for the first time--following the recipe exactly--and we were very disappointed.  They did not taste like crab.  The middle was slushy. Cooking them any longer would have resulted in burning them. 

I would not advise anyone trying them without first referring to the  posts with advice; and I strongly suggest that the recipe be augmented with everyone's tips and tricks, such as draining the zucchini.

These are great. Grated them into a colander and added a little salt, waited, pressed the water out. Then followed the rest of the recipe.  Baked them in the oven at 400 for 40 minutes with some spray oil.  Coated one in spicy panko crumbs and that was good.

The 3 rating is for the original recipe, which does not direct you to drain the shredded zucchini first. If you follow this recipe as I did, it will be very difficult not to have a soggy mess for your "cakes." So take the advice of the reviewers and drain the shredded zucchini first.

Love these zucchini cakes!  We're vegetarians and love zucchini squash.  This recipe was given to us by some non-vegetarian friends. We followed the recipe exactly, but we didn't have Old Bay seasoning.  We found a substitute recipe on this website.  We dredged in flour and fried in canola oil. They turned out fantastic!  My husband made a dipping sauce of sour cream,  dill weed, black pepper, season salt, and lemon juice.  Delicious!

Tried this twice now and loved both times. We can't get the crab seasoning up here so the first time I just used some Lawry's and it was nice. Then today I decided on an eastern version and made the cakes with chili, cumin and garam masala plus some salt. Made naan bread and raita and it was great! Used the oven fry method and squeezed liquid out of the zucchini both times too. This will be a staple here.

I thought these were to die for! Tastes exactly like crab cakes. My husband didn't think they tasted like crab cake he said it had same consistancy but different flavor BUT he still ate them and complimented them. I will use this recipe again! Maybe next time instead of frying it with vegatble oil I'm gonna try olive or coconut to make it healthier.

I would give it 4.5 if possible. The only change I would make in the future is to slightly increase the amount of Old Bay seasoning.

Very good,  Drained the Zucchini first (recommended), added 1/4 cup minced red bell pepper and salt and pepper.   But didn't really need it.   Tried it on english muffins with remoulade and pepperjack cheese and it was a bit too much in my opinion.  I did try it again with a pinch of crushed red pepper and it was a nice addition.    Basically, a great base recipe, but you should on tweaking to your taste.   (side note:   raised in NJ, so not quite to MD standards)   Thanks for a great idea!

These were terrific! I veganized them by using gound flax and water rather than egg and I added some TVP for protein.  I also followed another reviewers recommendation to bake them and they turned out great.  Thanks for this great recipe! After making a triple batch, I will have loads of "crab" cakes to freeze for later.

This is a great recipe. I have made it twice and it has been a hit. I like it best when the patties are thin and cooked until crisp.Other family members liked it better when thicker patties and not so crisp.

Amazing.  I used a potato ricer to squeeze the liquid out of the shredded zucchini which worked really well.  When I doubled the recipe I put in an extra egg (3 eggs). I don't know that it was necessary, but the end product was delicious.

Awesome, although a bit watery. Perhaps something to squeeze the water out would solve that issue.

DELICIOUS!  I added 4 med. shrimp just for some added flavor, salt and pepper.  Took out the butter.  Still tasted Very good. Made ahead and refrigerated. Dredged in panko instead of flour just before cooking, cut the stickiness. Great side dish or main lunch meal

I'm rating this recipe for making it as is, without tweaking.  They were so soggy they wouldn't form into patties!  You can't even make them if you don't double the bread crumbs!

If you double or nearly triple the bread crumbs then You can make these, but as is, you have a big sloppy mess.

my family is from maryland but living in the midwest, it's impossible to find affordable lump crab meat.  i added chopped jalapeños and an extra half cup of breadcrumbs, and while isn't not crab meat, it's a fantastic substitution!! I will definitely make these again!

They didnt taste like crabcakes, and I did add more Old Bay than the recipe called for.  I thought they tasted ok, but just not crabcake.  I am going to give this another try.  Will wring out zucchini in a dishtowel next time.

This was really wet and could have done with being salted and drained. I couldn't dredge it in flour because it was so wet, so I just dropped the batter into the pan- with spray olive oil. They were ok. They didn't taste like crab but my daughter loved them

Fantastic!! I, as suggested, drained my zucchini and added a few more spices (dill, cardamom, black pepper, garlic, and dry mustard). I fried mine in oil. They turned out perfect. I was surprised at well they held together and the taste was really wonderful. I just wish I had made more. Great recipe!

I made these twice already and they are fantastic!! I peeled the zucchini first and squeezed out the liquid once it was shredded. I made a little tarter sauce to serve with them also.

We're talking WOW factor here. Who knew zucchini could be THIS great?  Warning.. these "cakes" are addictive.   Next time I will try the baking at 400 method, so I can make more, faster.   : )   
Thanks Connie!

I've made these like 4 times now. The first time I accidentally forgot to dip them in the flour and they turned out just fine! No need. I also don't drain my zucchini or do anything to get the water out & they turn out great. I grate the zucchini then immediately make the recipe, maybe that's why; they don't sit around getting watery. Also, I only use 1/4 c oil & I think I could even use less. I love these! So good. Think I might try the oven version next since it would be alot healthier.

To make them taste more like "crab" cakes, I added a packet of bonito flakes. I served them over fresh tomatoes and squeezed some Japanese Mayo over them as a garnish. I also shredded a half of carrot in the mix to give it a pretty color.

Although I made changes I think this was excellent. I've made mock crab cakes before and they are really wet. I did shed, salt and drain mine.  I called them more of a "summer pancake" I didn't have oldbay which gives it the "crab" taste but I had fresh basil, and cilantro and I chopped those up and put them in there. I fried some and baked some at 400 for 12min, flip and 12min more. Little mayo, and a tomatoe on top! Yum. I make these like once a week!

These zucchini cakes are amazing! I forgot to put flour but they still turned out great. I made a few changes: lightly salted and squeezed all moisture out of shredded zucchini; added 1/2 cup Italian bread crumbs and 1/2 cup panko; instead of Old Bay seasoning (did not have it on hand) added 1 tbsp dried oregano, 1 tbsp dried basil, some pepper and garlic powder. They tasted great. Even my kids, who loath vegetables, gobbled these up. Thank you for the recipe.

I've made this recipe twice.  The first time, I used an extremely large zucchini, scraped out all the seeds, added dehydrated onions to soak up some of the moisture, added a little garlic salt as well as all the other ingredients (except butter), and it was awesome.  Not soggy at all.  I didn't measure any of the ingredients; I just added everything together until it looked right.  I also added butter to the vegetable oil for frying.  I must've done okay because it was really good.

The second time I made it, I did everything exactly the same as the first time except I added a half a bottle of clam juice to make a "poor woman's crabcake."  Although these came out a little soggy (not too bad, though), they really tasted like crabcakes.  Put one on a bun with a little cocktail sauce and you'd think you were in Maryland.  Excellent recipe.

only 4 stars, because i followed other reviewers and tweaked it a bit.  i would have given 5 stars if these changes were in the original...... I increased the Old Bay to 2 teaspoons.  I lightly salted and drained the zucchini as per other reviewers.  I accidentally dumped in the flour along with the breadcrumbs, but this turned out just fine for my family and i had no problem making them into patties so will do that again.  To make this a vegan meal, substitute 3 TB water + 1 TB ground flax for the egg and omit butter.  When you mix those two together and let sit for 5 min before adding to the crumb mixture the flax serves as a binder just as well as the egg would have.  Lastly, I oiled a baking sheet and baked them for 15 min at 400, flipped them and baked again for 15 min.  THESE WERE GREAT AS A MEAL!! i served them with tzakziki sauce (warning, tzakziki is not vegan) made from this site, corn on the cob, and a smoothie.

I followed MANDT2 suggestion of oiling a baking sheet and baking them at 400 for 15 minutes on each side and they came out super yummy.  Hubby and I ate them with diced tomatoes on top.  My picky son liked them too an added bonus!

These really taste like they are made with real crab meat!  The only problem is you cannot keep them as leftovers, the next day they tend to be soggy.  Next time I make them I'll make sure to eat them all!

Tried these last night and they are wonderful.  A great use of zucchini and the flavor really is much like a crab cake.  Better than the bread crumb laden crab cakes I have had!

Very flavorful.  As another reviewer mentioned, I salted and drained the zucchini before mixing with the other ingredients, then baked @ 400 on a lightly oiled cookie sheet for 12-15 minutes per side.  Served with Dill Sauce and Sufferin' Succotash Salad from this site.  VEGGIE HEAVEN!

Very surprised at how good and easy these were and I'm from Maryland. I didn't change a thing in the recipe and although my husband said they didn't exactly taste like crabcakes he ate three of them and I ate two. They were just like crabcakes in looks and texture only without the shells. A squeeze of lemon made them even fresher.

These were good. I did squeeze out the liquid from the shredded zucchini (without salting it) and did up the seasoning some but otherwise made as written. Very good. Thanks for the recipe!

Love Them!  Since I had read many complaints of them being too mushy, instead of adding 1 C of bread crumbs I used about 1/3C Coconut Flour since this absorbs so much more moisture.  Also drained the zucchini real well.  Then tripled to Old Bay and put Panko crumbs instead of flour on the outside before cooking.

I made this vegan using egg replacement and earth balance butter. I also increased the Old Bay and would consider increasing it even more. It was delicious. My only complaint was it was slightly oily. I may try baking next time as some people suggested.

These are fantastic!  I've made them about 4 times, using panko style as well as regular packaged bread crumbs.  I grate the zucchini on a "coarse" grate, and also add a medium carrot grated on a "fine" grate...it adds a little color & sweetness, I think.  Also, I grate the veggies onto a double thickness of paper towel, and fold it up to make a ball and squeeze it to remove excess moisture.  If I get it too dry, I just add an extra egg.  Also, I took the advice to BAKE them at about 400 for 10-12 min. each side.    They are good cold, too.

I just made something very similar except I had a small can of crab meat that I put in with the zucchini. I  did not have any bread crumbs so mixed in some flour and a little bit of baking powder.  They fried up nice and fluffy.  Will definitely make again!

This was just ok.  I really didn't taste much of the Old Bay in this.  I guess some cooks like this recipe but it sure doesn't taste like real crab cakes or even "just like".  It's more of a zucchini fritter.

I just made these tonight and they were great.  I didn't go into this expecting them to taste like crab, so I wasn't disappointed...instead I found this to not only be easy, but such a big payoff in flavor, economy and the "impress your friends" factor.  I did not drain my zucchini so I had to wash my hands after forming the third one.  The first two were not as flat so I cooked them for 1 minute to get the inside cooked...when I cut them with my fork delicious steam poured out, yum!  A great appetizer.

This recipe is great!  I didn't have Old Bay, so I used 1t each of garlic powder and onion powder and salt and pepper to taste.  Can't wait to serve them tomorrow at a family get-together.

Amazing. I didn't change anything and they weren't soggy at all. I did let the mixture sit for 20 mins. so maybe that is why. Very tasty and inspired salmon cakes the next day. Using the same recipe just substituted the zucchini for salmon.

Very good,, though I can't attest to them tasting like crab cakes, they were good in their own right. I left off the butter and flour and added more bread crumbs.  Healthy and very good.

Pretty f'in good!  Made according to recipe.  Squished as much liquid out of the Zucchini in a metal collander as i could.  Just fried in a little OO and veg oil.  Really good....just need the perfect dipping sauce.....cocktail sauce was pretty good with it.  Definately putting it in high rotation during Zucchini out the ears season.

Always looking for a veggie dinner to change things up. I enjoyed this dish because I enjoy crab cakes. Could not find Old Bay Spice, but used Zatarain's Shrimp and Crab -- a spicy hot liquid, so 1 tsp was just right.

Tastes GREAT! Be sure to salt & squeeze juice out of the grated zucchini!! I doubled the recipe, substituted rice bread 'crumbs' & gluten free flour for a gluten free version. I added more onion & tripled the Old Bay, added a little oregano, basil & garlic powder. No need for additional salt with the Old Bay. I baked mine, grease the pan well. They were very hard to handle & fell apart easily - I didn't squeeze out enough juice. Excellent recipe!!

AWESOME! Crispy on the outside, and moist on the inside. Even those who aren't zucchini lovers will enjoy these, as they are flavorful, just like a crab cake.

These were OK; certainly a new way to use up all those zucchini. I made it exactly as written except used another reviewer's advice and baked them, also salted and drained them ahead of time. What I didn't like was that they were too salty and spicy.

Never one to leave anything alone...I added 1 shredded carrot for color, I drained the zucchini to get rid of the excess mositure, I used Mrs. Dash instead of old bay, and I let the mixture firm up in the frig for easier pattie making. This is such a great idea for vegetarians!

Great tasting recipe. My family loved it. I did add chopped bell pepper and that really gave it a 'wow' factor. Instead of bread crumbs, I used potato flakes.

This was Pretty good. I didn't have any of the seasoning so I just used salt, pepper and parsley and they came out really well. I forgot to squeeze out the excess fluid from the zucchini but they were quite nice anyway; gooey centers with crispy exterior. They were wolfed down by my hungy mob in a flash.

This was really tasty. I added carrots and cajun seasonings but didnt add enough. I squeezed a lot of water out of the veggies. I baked in oven with broiler. Paired with sauce of mayo, dijon mustard, lemon juice, and terragon. I got that a sauce from recipe on here for chicken asparagus roll ups.

My whole family loved these!  Delicious.  Ours stayed together well, but next time I'm going to press out some of the water to help the texture and to make it easier to cook.

Taste is very good but they were a bit greasy.  Will be experimenting with how to change that.  Did not dredge in flour the second time which was better

4 stars ONLY because, even after draining the zucchini slightly, the mixture was too moist to form firm enough patties to dredge with the flour. So... I simply incorporated the flour.  Also, I baked the patties (as suggested by another reviewer) in order to  reduce fat.  The flavor... FANTASTIC!  A firm hit with the entire family - including my "no zucchini" spouse.  Will definitely stay on my favorites list.

Did the salting and draining in the collander-thing with the grated zucchini before mixing. I'm sure that this aided in the forming of the patties and the frying. Couldn't find Old Bay seasoning (U.S. only?), so I went with a garlic/red pepper seasoning that worked quite well. Dish was very flavorful, light and tasty - we loved it.
Did it again - still couldn't find 'Old Bay' - this time I used the suggestion of someone who said to make my own 'copy-cat' Old Bay. I aslo made a 'Garlic Aioli' sauce (this site - with extra garlic) for the cakes..........WOW!!!!!!! - what flavor!!!!!

Definitely too soggy.  I agree that you need to squeeze out the liquid from the zucchini after it's grated.  I would also add a little more Old Bay seasoning to it, especially if you decide to use plain bread crumbs.

I went into this thinking they really going to taste like crab cakes, but I don't even think they were close.  If I had the mindset of them being zucchini patties, I think my expectations would have been a little different based on all the good reviews.  I followed all the suggestions, and I also baked them as suggested by one reviewer, but ultimately I think I should have pan-fried them and just used less oil in the pan.  I think the oil may have given them more flavor this way.  I will try it again doing it in the pan instead.  Maybe to make this again I would add some kernel corn, too.

I've never used Old Bay, but decided to use the extra spoonful that others suggested. Draining the zucchini was a pain, but these were so good it was definitely worth it.

Really, really good!  The only change I made, was leaving out the Old Bay seasoning.  I didn't have it and am really not sure what exactly is in it, so I guessed and used salt, pepper, a little paprika and some fresh flat leaf parsley.  Super tasty!

I made this recipe as written, although I used some frozen shredded zucchini that I had.  I drained the zucchini thoroughly and actually had to add just a small bit of water back.  I agree with some other reviewers that it was a bit salty, but overall, the recipe was very good.  My mother even asked for the recipe.  I would make this again.

This was great! My husband (total carnivore) loved them too! My adjustments: DOUBLE the Old Bay; HALF the butter; Add some garlic powder (I made plain bread crumbs, didn't have any); and DRAIN the zucchini (I rang it out in my hands!). Next time I'll try broiling them. If you're not sure how big to make them, I would lean towards smaller/thinner. The thick ones could get soggy in the middle. Definitely try these!

These were unbelievable!! They really did taste like crab cakes! O made them for a dinner party and everyone asked for the recipe!   I did read some of the reviews and took some advice....I drained the zucchini in a colander with a little salt for about half hour, I used 1 tablespoon of old bay, and I used 2 eggs instead of butter. I also tried to dredge them in flour but the were a little too soggy, so I just dropped them with a large spoon into the oil and they were AWESOME!!!!!!

These are really good, however, they are difficult to keep form falling apart. My first few came out of the pan looking scattered, not like patties.

These are really good! They don't exactly taste like crab cakes, IMO, but very tasty nonetheless. I do drain my zucchini a bit before mixing the batter so it isn't too runny. I have made these a few times before and will continue to make them here and there in the future! Thanks for sharing. :)

Great recipe, and I'm sure it would be even better if I could buy Old Bay Seasoning, which no one around here has ever heard of. It would be nice to know what alternative spices could be used.

I'm rating these as a 4 star because I loved them and my husband was just so-so about them.  Because of that I've only made them the one time. Like I said, though, I really liked them.

They don't taste crabby at all.  For zucchini cakes, they were fine, but they weren't anything like crabcakes to me.  I used a measuring cup to form them and baked them to help them stay together.

This recipe was wonderful. It was actually better than crab cakes and so easy to make. I followed this recipe exactly as directed but, next time I think I will make it with cocktail sauce. This is one of the best  recipes I have found on this website.

This is a regular part of our dinner rotation! I have tried these both baked and pan fried, and had success with both, although the texture of the pan fried version makes that one my favorite between the two. Last time I made them, I used whole wheat bread crumbs and dredged them in potato flour, and that was excellent as well. Even my boyfriend, who is an avid carnivore, loves this dish. Highly recommended!

Very good! I'd suggest using Panko crumbs instead of flour. Also, they taste just as good if baked.

though they didn't look very nice as the end product, the flavor was quite good; shredded zucchini makes a nice vehicle for crab cake seasoning flavor.  definitely drain your zucchini though, mine was quite wet and I feel that greatly contributed to mine falling apart in the end...

This recipe was awesome. I am a vegetarian and my husband is not. He loved these "crab" cakes. He said that there was obvious differences between the real and these, but he liked the flavor. That's enough for me! I did follow suggestions and put the zucchini in a collander with a 1/2 teas of salt to help drain some of the liquid. Worked like a charm. My patties held together well. Will definitly make these again.

These are really quite tasty, however I would disagree that they taste like crab cakes.  I made these a little like you would potato latkes.  I used a towel to squeeze the excess liquid from the zucchini and I used a 1/2 a cup of matzo meal and 1/2 a cup of italian breadcrumbs. I also doubled the amount of Old Bay seasoning.  I will definitely be making these again.

Loved these! Took other reviewers' advice and squeezed as much water out of the zucchini as I could and added an extra 1/4 cup of bread crumbs to help them stay together.  My husband and I loved them.  Great with wasabi dipping sauce.

Yummy! We used low-salt Old Bay & Italian bread crumbs, and it was REALLY SALTY.  But, I'm gonna try it again with non-salty bread crumbs.

O..M...G... This recipe rocks! I just tried it and did as some other reviewer suggested and baked instead of fried. I don't have a clue what Old Bay seasoning is so I added Montreal steak spice instead..What a good kick! I also used Italian Seasoned bread crumbs...added a little sea salt, pepper and basil. I had to use EXTRA breadcrumbs because the mix was too wet. It worked out fine!! It was tricky because I made a big batch using 3 eggs in the mix. I just eyeballed the breadcrumbs until I felt the consistency was patti-able. Thanks for this awesome idea!

these turned out really great. i followed MANDT2's advice. i salted and drained the zukes first,formed into 6 patties,  and oven baked @400 degrees on a greased cookie sheet(mine took at least 15 mins each side though). i served these with baked salmon II from this site and some rice pilaf with spinach. yummy

I would have rated this a 2, my husband a 4.  I just didn't think they were very good for the amount of work and the amount of fat.  The only change I made was to squeeze some of the liquid out.  I think in the future I will stick to plain old fried zucchini!

My husband and son really liked this recipe.  I squeezed out the water from the zucchini before and had no trouble keeping the patties together.  I'm not crazy about crab cakes, so these were just o.k. for me.  Will make again for the family.

These are really good. I fried mine in just enough oil to cover bottom of nonstick pan. Cooked until well browned, which made the outside nice and crispy.

Be sure to really squeeze your shredded zucchini and it's much easier to work with. Zattaran's breading for the bread crumbs worked great. Loved, loved, loved it!

Really great taste and texture. Batter was too messy to handle though even after adding an extra cup of breadcrumbs. I did not have any Old Bay on hand so I used some Greek seasoning and it was very yummy. I will definately make this again and squeeze out the excess water from the zucchini so it handles better and try some Japanese bread crumbs to dredge instead of flour. This is a keeper but the recipe needs modifying somewhat.

Wow, delicious. I followed the recipe except I didn't use oil in the recipe but I did pan fry them. Also, I used season bread crumbs and omitted the onion flakes. I did squeeze as much liquid from the zucchini after it was grated. Next time I make them I will peel the zucchini and try to fool everyone into believing it is real crab meat.

SUPER EASY to make with little mess! I didn't dry the zucchini off, but I did buy all organic local produce and breadcrumbs and it's never very cold here in California - not sure if that had anything to do with it. They were a little bit bland, next time I might try adding a little garlic or extra onion.

I'm eating a leftover one right now and it's still fabulous the next day! Wow...these are soooo good!! The only thing I did different was when the patties were made, I sprinkled a little more Old Bay on each side. Yum yum yum!!!

Quite tasty and a good use for zucchini. I served with some sour cream and fresh chives. I lightly salted my shredded zucchini then rinsed and wrung it out. Cakes held together perfectly this way. I fear they might be too watery if you don't squeeze out at least some of the moisture.

So good you can't believe it until you try it.  Make a double batch, because you'll want to have some extras for later.

These didn't taste like crab cakes but were an excellent use of zucchini. I sprinkled them with extra Old Bay because they seemed to be lacking a little flavor. Overall though, they were good and I would make them again.

These were pretty good.  I didnt drain the zucchini and I never had any problems with the cakes falling apart.  I just thought that they seemed to lack flavor.

I gave it 4 stars because it tasted great! Flavors were simple and perfect - ideal use for all the zucchini we have growing.  I'd have given it 5 stars if the patties were easier to dredge. Mine were either too liquidy from the vegetable or because I used panko instead of bread crumbs.  Not sure.  Bottom line, I made one batch to try and will be making them again for dinner tonight!  Thanks!

Looking for a recipe to use up the garden summer squash?  These where soooo good!  I didn't even use the Old Bay Seasoning--didn't have it, instead used Italian Bread Crumbs.  I'm sure it would be just as good or better with the Old Bay.  To serve, topped with a dab of sour cream.

I didn't really like this that much. I tried it baked, it might be better fried but I don't even think that would save it. I won't be making it again. This is probably a taste preference.  Although everyone in my family said it was OK but nothing great or special.

Nice substitute for vegetarians looking to create a familiar dish.  Recipe works well without modifications.  Does not reheat well, turns soggy.

These are good.  I would never mistake them for crab cakes but a nice vegetarian option.  Also a great way to use up the zucchini coming from the garden.  I made the recipe exactly as it's written except that I baked them (350 for 15 min. each side) for a healthier approach.  I also forgot to dredge them in flour first but they were fine.

This is one of our favorites. I use about a tablespoon of Cajun seasoning (instead of Old Bay) to spice them up and serve them with sour cream and salsa. They are delicious!

I thought these were pretty bland.  Definitely needs more old bay or something.  Good base recipe though.

Not quite as satisfying as crab cakes, but still wonderful and a great veggie option.  Like others, I squeezed the water out, added additional Old Bay and baked them.

I didn't like this very much, but I can't say it was the recipe's fault. First mistake was adding a shredded carrot to the mix.  Wasn't a good flavor addition, too strong. Second mistake was using half a Tablespoon (not a typo) of spicy cayenne seasoning instead of the Old Bay.  Guess what?  It came out too spicy!  Duh! Two things that I did RIGHT that give me hope for trying this again: One, I followed a prior reviewer's suggestion to press the zucchini in a potato ricer and it worked great! Second, I baked them at 400 for half an hour (15 one side then flip for 15 on the other).  They still weren't crispy enough for me so I broiled them for a few minutes on both sides and THAT got them nice and crispy. Will try again and next time, I will stick to the recipe!!!

YUM!  I've been looking for meat substitutes in meals and this is a good one.  Husband and kids liked also. Would also make a good appetizer if entertaining.  I did not have a problem with them being soggy- but I did squeeze some of the liquid out of the zucchini and I also added dried minced onion to one batch (perhaps that helped absorb some of the moisture?).

Great recipe, squeeze the water out of the zucchini really well using fresh clean kitchen towels and add a bit more of the old bay to taste. I add some dried parsley and oregano to the mix. This is always enjoyed by everyone who tries it. Tastes great dipped in some sour cream.

I thought these fell apart a little too easily, and were a little too soft on the inside and messy to make - I think next time I will let the zucchini stand and squeeze out the water before I make the zucchini cakes. But even so, they were a HUGE hit when I brought them to a dinner with friends. One of those friends requested the recipe, has made them several times since, and named them on his blog as one of his top five recipes of the year :)

No, they don't taste like crab, they taste like Old Bay, but the great thing is...they don't taste like zucchini!  I used half regular (unseasoned) bread crumbs and half panko, breaded in panko and used 2 tsp Old Bay.  I fried, but I make such a mess frying I'll probably try baking them next time.  I think I'll cut back a bit on the Old Bay next time, too.  I only had mild hopes for this recipe, but when I tasted them I thought, "Wow!  They're really good!"  Thanks for a great way to use a less than favorite vegetable! Edit: I did bake them the second time, 400 for 15 minutes a side...they got plenty crispy and it was a lot easier!

This is a keeper!  I baked them as was suggested by another reviewer to reduce the amount of fat, and I also added a grated potato to the mix.  Adding an extra half teaspoon of the Old Bay seasoning was a good idea.  My husband loved them, and my 15 month old son even liked them!  I know this isn't much as far as a vegetable goes, but every little bit of vegetable I can get into him is a plus!

How anyone could confuse these with crab cakes I don't know. As Zucchini cakes these are fantastic. I only wish I had made mine a little smaller as I made four large patties. I enjoyed with spaghetti sauce as my dipping sauce. Yum.

This recipe is so good! They were a hit, my problem is I literally use one roll of paper towels soaking up the zucchini juice. I also can't keep them in cakes, so most of the time I stick them in a nice bowl and let people spoon it up.I've made this recipe about five times.

I obviously need to try this recipe again.  I baked them as suggested and added additional Old Bay. They tasted more like stuffing patties than crab cakes (and since I love stuffing it wasn't a total waste) although they weren't what my taste buds were craving.

These were terrific!  I doubled the Old Bay like others had suggested and reduced the oil but did everything else the same.

We really liked these!  WE used the suggestion of another member and did them in the oven.  We also used the suggestion of salting the zucchini to help drain it more.  We will use more Old Bay next time, and we may try them browned in a tad bit of oil in a non stick skillet.  We will deffinately be using this recipie again and again.  Thanks!

Amazing! My partner was skeptical of the dish when I read the ingredients to her, but these "crab" cakes won her over as soon as she took a bite. I will definitely make these again.

As a vegetarian, I was particularly pleased with this recipe.  I doubled the Old Bay, added garlic & lemon juice, and substituted crushed Ritz crackers for the bread crumbs.  Baking and squeezing moisture from the zucchini were great recommendations from other reviews.  It was an incredibly delicious and easy-to-make entrée.

These were really good (8yr vegetarians)and even fooled a carnivore! I took the advice of a previous post to bake versus frying and it really did make a difference. A great way to use zucchini. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is AWESOME!  I didn't have to change a thing.  The Old Bay seasoning is a very nice touch.  They taste so much like real crab cakes.  I will definitely be making these on a regular basis.

Great recipe, but you have to make sure you squeeze, squeeze, squeeze out as much liquid as you can from the zucchini. My son loved them, and I can only get this kid to willingly eat 4-5 vegetables. They were good cold. Definitely a keeper.

I really like this idea.  They didn't remind me of crab cakes other than being cakes, but if you're looking for an easy and tasty way to incorporate more veggies into your diet, this is a good one.  I used one yellow squash and one zucchini (squeezed all the water out by pressing the shredded squash against the bottom of a colander), and I also added some shredded carrot, onion, and diced green pepper.  Lots of Old Bay.  I omitted the flour dredge and baked them in the oven at about 400 for about 12 minutes on each side (as someone else here suggested) to save on calories/frying etc.  They really turned out great, nice and brown. A little dry, but I think that's because I baked them and because I added some extra crumbs.  The Husband says next time he suggest putting a tablespoon or so of olive oil in the mix.  I also made a cilantro sour cream to go with them.  I'll definitely make them again!

I can't get Old Bay Seasoning so I just googled a recipe for it and made my own. Not sure how authentic the flavour was but the zucchini cakes were very yummy.

Pressed the squash in paper towels to remove moisture - worked well with no problem making the patties.  Doubled the Old Bay - I think it was just right!

I gave this recipe 3 stars for now although I have a feeling it's partly operator error. I chose to bake mine as opposed to frying to avoid the greasiness and they came out alright, but not the best. Next time I will definitely dry out the zucchini more and I think that will help tremendously.

I love these. I leave out the onion and add lots of Tabasco to the mixture. Sooo good! The 2nd time I made this recipe I opted to be more figure friendly. I baked at 400 for 15 min then flipped and baked another 15 min. I sprayed the top with a little EVOO and they came out great!

I really liked these! I did not coat in flour but just pressed the mixture onto a griddle until it was flat. I didn't like the way they turned out w/the flour. Second time I made these I added 1/2 cup of grated parmesan cheese but they were good both ways. I even eat them cold!

These were just OK but hardly a substitute for crab cakes.  I think they'd taste better if you just expect them to taste like what they are... zucchini cakes!

Although these were good, I have NO CLUE why the word "crab" has even been associated with this recipe. These are not at all like a crab cake, but rather, they are a zucchini cake! They are quite tasty though and I will definitely make them again. I added extra Old Bay seasoning and I baked them in a 400 degree oven for about 14 minutes per side. A GREAT alternative to pan frying! Less oil, less mess and much less fat, but they still get nice & crunchy by doing them in high heat in the oven.

These were really good. Better than I thought. I drained the zucchini also. It took my husband a minute to realize there wasn't really crab in it. I accidentally added the flour into the mix instead of dipping them in the flour. Next time I bet they will be better I am sure. Bread crumbs would be good too.

Splendid! 
I subsituted the Bay Seasoning for "Mrs. Dash" Seasoning, which ended up tasting spectacular! These were really a treat, and didn't taste like zucchini at all! Hard to imagine that something so tasty could be good for you.

I liked these a lot, but they didn't taste like crab to me at all.  Love the zucchini flavor anyway, so they were still good.  We ate them with hot sauce-mayo combination and it fit nicely.

These were a huge hit in my house!  My partner is not a fan of crab (which is a big sin in Maryland) and she doesn't much care for zucchini, but this sounded so good I had to try -- and we both loved them!  They won't fool anyone into thinking they are made of crab, but they are delicious in their own right.  I did increase the Old Bay to 1 tablespoon, but other than that, I followed this exactly.

DELICIOUS!!!  I also recommend draining the zucchini first, and I added 1-1/2 tsp of the Old Bay. What a yummy way to use up extra zucchini!

We had lots of extra zucchini from our garden this year and didn't need 6 loaves of zucchini bread so we made this recipe. YUM! We patted the zucchini with paper towels before mixing it in to drain excess water. Used regular breadcrumbs (seasoned would be a little too much for our tastes) Everyone loved it even my 18 month old...he scarfed it down before the rice he had which is amazing. Tastes a little like onion rings.

Wow! What a great use of zucchini. I've been asked for this recipe so many times I've lost track.

I normally read ALL reviews before starting a recipe, but for whatever reason I read a couple and decided to make the recipe as is, but bake in the oven.  To begin, I did not drain or squeeze the zucchini and it was like trying to make patties out of cake batter - it just didn't work.  I ended up using a ton more flour just so they'd hold their shape.  The end result was just not all that good.  I won't make this again, I'll attempt the "Zucchini Patties" that someone else suggested.

My family ate these zucchini cakes but we will likely never make them again.  They did not taste like crab cakes.  We followed much of the advice from others, like removing the excess liquid, adding more Old Bay seasoning, etc.  The cakes were just not very good.

This recipe tasted exactly like plain old fried squash...nothing else.  If people can't tell the difference in these and real crab cakes, there is something wrong with their taste buds!

As a vegetarian I am always looking for new and interesting things to feed my family.  This one was one of the best that I have tried from all recipes.  I added a little more old bay but other than that I stuck to the recipe and they turned out great.

My 25 year old son who is "not" a zucchini fan devoured these as I've made them a few times already this season.  They are fabulous without changing the recipe.  Thanks for this out of the ordinary recipe :-)

Delish!  I made the recipe as written and it was fabulous!  I did, however, grate the zucchini, add a bit of salt and then let drain for about 30 min.  Wonderful vegetarian recipe!  This will definitely stay in my rotation.

I just made this recipe for the first time and my only regret is that I didn't make a double recipe!  These are GREAT!  I did salt down the zucchini after grating it and allowed it to drain in a colander set upon paper towels for about an hour.  Other than that, I prepared as written.  This recipe is a keeper---thanks for sharing!

These were okay, but not great.  Tasted *nothing* like crab.  They'd be good served as a vegetable side, but I don't think they're hearty enough to serve as a main dish.

These zucchini cakes are wonderful.  They taste great, are adjustable to your individual tastes (I ate mine with a curry sauce), and they can be frozen without losing their taste or texture.  Thank you so much for this recipe - it's a lifesaver for those of us buried under a mountain of zucchini!

Very good, and a great, different way to use the zucchini from the garden. I would definitely make them again.  I omitted the flour, and fried with olive oil.  However, I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it didn't taste like crab cakes at all, more like bread stuffing with zucchini.

These were really good! I couldn't find any Old Bay Seasoning here in Scotland so I just looked up what it was made from and added the individual spices instead- it turned out really well. Also, I fried them on my George Foreman Grill- no fat or oil which is really good. The downside of this was that they didn't really crisp up but that's better than being laden with oil, right?

Really good!  The old bay really gives a good flavor and the texture was great. I dried out the grated zucchini by twisting it in a tea towel and letting the water drain out. The cakes were not too dry or too wet.  Served with a dill/sourcream/mayo sauce. YUMMY!

i'm giving four stars just b/c i changed the recipe so much.  i took other's advice and omitted melted butter, but substituted with 1 tbsp. mayo.  i didn't have any old bay, so i just spiced them up.  these cakes were delicious!  can't wait to try it with the old bay!  i used hidden valley spicy ranch for dipping too!

These were pretty good.  Baked them to save calories and doubled the Old Bay.  The cakes really need to be eaten right away since they are not as good once they cool off.

I was disappointed in this recipe.  There was a lot of messy prep work involved, and the outcome wasn't worth the sticky hands and massive cleanup.  I felt that this lacked something - spice, sauce...perhaps a creamy dill or tartar sauce would have gone well with this.  I did alter - I baked (as many of the reviewers suggested) rather than pan-fry.  The patties were so flimsy, I don't think I could have managed flipping them, though the trade-off was a slightly crunchy exterior.  Perhaps this is where some of the flavor was lacking?

Yum. This recipe is awesome! I use more Old Bay seasoning than the recipe calls for (about 2 tbsp), and bake instead of fry. I used shredded carrot in one batch that turned out great and added a nice splash of color. I've never had real Crab Cakes, so I wouldn't know if they tasted "real" or not. They seem to want some kind of dipping sauce, but I haven't nailed that one yet. Tarter sauce? Will definitely make again.

These didn't fool me into thinking that they were real crabcakes, but they're just as good as the real thing! I made a sauce with mayo, chili sauce and a little garlic.

These came out so good, even I was surprised.  I didn't have any Old Bay Seasoning, so I just improvised from the spice rack.  Major thumbs up!

I am a big crab fan and these did not do the trick for me.  They looked great but I found I could barely eat them.  I am not a zucchini fan so that may be part of the issue.

I've never had crab cakes since I'm a vegetarian but my mom loves them so I wanted to try this recipe. Both me and my meat loving husband loved them. I decided to listen to the reviewers and to make them healthier I baked them for about 25 mins. Other than that followed the instructions and ingredients the same. Very good!

The changes I made:  salted zucchini and squeezed out excess water, left out butter, used paprika, garlic powder (no additonal salt needed) baked with cooking spray.  Will make again and will try with egg substitute.  Thank you!

I make this recipe (almost) exactly as stated, and the "crab" cakes are excellent! I do use a little less butter, and a lot less oil to fry. I also make a tarter sauce for dipping. So good!

This recipe is surprisingly delicious. I added a teaspoon more of Old Bay seasoning, a dash of garlic powder and a sprinkle of hot pepper seeds to spice things up a bit.  I topped them off with a little coctail sauce and served them with a small baked potatoe and a side salad. My family fell in love.

I thought these were perfect! The only thing I did differently was squeeze most of the water out of the zucchini to avoid sogginess, and I didn't dredge them in flour because they come apart. Dusting them on each side did just fine. Beautiful! Thank you :)

These were delicious. I used the griddle to cook them and that took a long time. Probably cooking them in an oiled pan would work better. I will definitely make these again! (I even had two for breakfast the next day!)

If you get crab cakes from a cheap restaurant that uses mostly filler, I can see how these would taste like crab cakes to you.  To me, they tasted like breaded and fried zucchini slices (which I happen to like very much).  I had 1/3 of a batch and did not have my hunger satisfied, however.  Next time I will probably make them as a side dish or an appetizer, rather than the main course.  They were not very filling (no protein really).

Very tasty. I 'fried' them in nonfat cooking spray rather than using oil to cut down on fat and calories. In my opinion, the Old Bay Seasoning is the key ingredient in this recipe to making them taste similar to crab cakes. I love crab cakes and, of course, zucchini can't take the place of that taste, but combined with the Old Bay it came pretty close. Will definitely keep this one and make again.

This was really good.  I did add a half teaspoon of Sweet Swamp seasoning (a spicy bbq rub) because some reviewers said it was a bit bland.  It was a good addition.  I served some salsa ranch dressing on the side.  I might try baking them next time since they seemed to soak up a lot of the oil but I definately will make these again.  Also the dredging in flour was not as easy as it sounded.  My patties were difficult to hold together so I patted the flour on each side before putting it into the hot oil.

These really don't taste like crab, but they are great! I used Trader joe's 21 seasoning salute instead of Old bay so I could adjust the salt. (old bay is too salty for me) Everyone loved them and I'll be making them again for sure.

This was very good. I looked in two different grocery stores and was unable to find Old Bay Spice, I don't think they carry it anymore! So I improvised with garlic powder, salt and pepper. Frying them in the oil made them a little greasy, but definitely tasty.

Another native from Maryland, I didn't really feel these tasted like genuine crab cakes, but I didn't expect them to. My husband described them as "vegetable crab cakes". I used 1/2 cup extra bread crumbs - might use a bit less next time as I thought they were just a little dry. I squeezed the liquid out of the zucchini like many others suggested. I liked dipping them in a lemon-herb tartar sauce. Next time I might try adding a little red pepper or carrot

Definitely a keeper! We were surprised that these were so good. I don't think I could fool anyone into thinking they are real crab cakes though.  I used 1.5 tsp of Old Bay instead of 1. Also, I followed other reviewers' advice and drained the grated and lightly salted zucchini in a sieve for about 20 minutes before starting.  I served it with fresh steamed green beans.

These did not taste like crab in my opinion, but they were still good. Next time I make them I think I will try adding a couple of different seasonings. They were a little bland even though I added more than a teaspoon of old bay.

These were great!  Even my 3yr old ate them:-)  We did fry them and served them with cocktail sauce.  Oh..didn't have old bay seasoning...I'll try it next time.  I did salt the grated zucchini and press the water out of them for 20 min before making the cakes.  They were still a little watery, but not bad.

I've made these twice and they are excellent. My family loves crabmeat but not the price so these were a most welcome addition to our budget restricted menu.

Very Good. I've been looking for a different way to fix zucchini.(Especially since I don't really like zucchini in the first place...) I would not mistake it for the real "crab cakes"though. Also, I think it needs some kind of dipping sauce to go with it. I used a dill dressing, and it went good with it.

Very good, but I'm also not likely to mistake it for crab.  I don't have the patience or the forethought to allow the zucchini to drain for long, so my patties were a little damp.  Also didn't make sure the oil was hot enough for the first batch.  I'll still use this recipe when I have an abundance of zucchini, and my sister also loved the taste of the patties.  Wonder if anyone has considered serving them on a bun as a veggie-burger?  Seem to taste much like the gardenburgers my sister gets.  My husband and boys unfortunately avoid these like the plague.

Tasted good but was still "mushy" in the middle (I did "drain" the zucchini) It's been so hot & humid here so the cakes were hard to hold together but like I said, they were very tasty!

I thought this recipe was very good. I've never eaten crab cakes so I can't compare that way but they were delightful! I also used the 2 tsp of old bay seasonings instead of one. Will make again!

I followed the advice from others, 1. Squeezed out water from the zucchini between layers of paper towels, doubled the old bay spice, and fried in EVOO.  Turned out great.  I think it needs a dipping sauce of some sort.  Will experiment, but this is a keeper for sure.

I'd have to agree with a couple of the other reviews in regards to this not tasting like "crab" cakes.  However, like many people have said, as zucchini cakes, they're GREAT!  I made these for a BBQ that a friend was having and they were a huge hit!  Everybody liked them...including kids!  Saved this one to my recipe box!

I had one baby zucchini, which shredded to 'bout 1/2C, so I scaled this recipe down to make 2 cakes for my dinner last night.  This recipe provides a decent ratio of filler vs veggie, but I amped up the spice with the addition of some cayenne.  This would also be good served with a sauce, like a garlicky aioli.  Thanks for the recipe.

Another tricky one to review! Had I been expecting these to taste/look anything like crab cakes, I would have been extremely disappointed - sorry, but they don't come anywhere close, imo. However, as I have never been fooled by mock anything, I knew that what I would actually be getting would be Old Bay-seasoned zucchini patties, and these I give 4 stars. I had to add a little more breadcrumbs as the mix was a little sloppy, and I wish I had used more onion and s&p. But anyway, I would certainly recommend these. Thanks, Patti Jo!

Great way to use up your zucchini. My youngest daughter does not like zucchini but she loved these. Found that I had to add a little more bread crumbs as consistancy is a little runny.

Furthest thing from crab I ever did see.  As far as the patties went they were good but can't say they reminded me of crab meat in any way.  Too fussy to put together.  BUT still tasty for what they were.

These were great!  I added a can of crab meat, some corn, and a little red pepper.  Great with a sauce of Miracle Whip and garlic chili sauce.

These really DID taste like crab cakes!  I served them with a spicy mayo dip and it was just like we were on the coast!  I really liked these and made them just how the recipe stated, with no changes at all. Thanks!!

strangely good, although it is not exactly the same as having big hunks of crab in a cake, but if you normally buy the cheaper stuff that is so fine, you will not miss the crab and also save some dollars!

Very good!! I doubled the recipe and used 2 tablespoons of Old Bay. They reheat very well in the oven on a baking stone. If you refrigerate the mixture before patting them out, it helps out tremendously. Thanks for a great recipe!

THESE WERE EXCELLENT!! My husband and I LOVE crabcakes, so we weren't sure if these would stand up next to them. Well, they did!! I had to use Creole Seasoning instead of Old Bay, but they tasted great! Perfect texture! Great recipe!! Will definitely be making these often!! Thanks for the recipe!!!

Very good, but did not taste like crab cakes. I used very young zucchini, so it was not too moist. If I make it again I will use a bit more Old Bay Seasoning. I used seasoned bread crumbs, but it still needed more flavor. A bit more Old bay may do the trick.

This was so tasty! I also accidently used the flour in the zucchini mix. I also drained the zucchini and onions before I mixed in the other ingerdients. Instead of the Old Bay seasoning, I used hamburger seasoning in the mix as well as in the flour I used to coat the patties. The whole family loved these! I will definitly be making these again!

These were fantastic, but at first I had some problems with the batter.  I couldn't dredge in flour because it was way too soupy.  Instead I just put the batter in the hot oil and fried like a pancake...just make sure you don't make them too thick.  Also, they tasted nothing like crab cakes, but more like potato pancakes.  My hubby loved them and so did I.  A real keeper and a great new way to use up my zuchs from the garden.  Thanks!

These were good, a nice change from sauteed zuchinni. I did not use the Old Bay, just salt, pepper and garlic. I thought there were too much bread crumbs. I will make again but with less crumbs and probably just spray a nonstick skillet with pam instead of frying.

I added a little imitation crab to increase our fish intake and to add to fun.  Also, I let the patties set up in the freezer for about 30 minutes to help keep them together in the deep fryer.  Will make this again.

I thought these had good flavor, but not crab cake flavor. They reminded me more of a potato pancake instead. A good use for zucchini, when you have tons of it.

This recipe was a hit at Easter dinner.  I made this with a side of "Wasabi - Jalapeno Sauce" (also from this site). This was hard to form into patties, so I actually used Stove Top stuffing instead of bread crumbs and doubled up on the amount.

Followed everyone's advice and drained the zucchini just by squeezing it in some paper towels. Followed everything else to a T. Have to agree with most that it doesnt totally taste like a crab cake, but a nice pass of one. Enjoyed very much.

We really liked these!  I didn't use Old Bay, because I don't have it, but I used a Southwest seasoning blend.  I was hoping only for a delicious fritter, but I was surprised at how actually like crab cakes they were.  Even more-so if you cut your zucchinis in half lengthwise before grating, so that the strands stay short.  I used panko for the breadcrumbs.  I'll happily make this again.

I loved this recipe.  Very tasty!! Not exactly like crab, but awesome taste.  I would definately make it again.  I used the extra Old Bay like some others have suggested and it was perfect!

Yum. These are sooo good!!  I actually omitted the butter because they were moist enough without it. I also added a clove of garlic just for fun. Put them in the fridge for about 30 min. to firm them up before cooking, and they hold their shape really well!! Do yourself a favor and follow some of the others' advice-drain the zucchini really well or they will be soggy!! Awsome!!!!

This recipe was FABULOUS!  I drained the zucchini (as noted by others) before mixing it up and it turned out wonderful!  These also freeze quite well (bake in the oven to reheat).  I will definitely be putting some up for winter.

Very good. Like others I squeezed out the excess liquid from the grated zuchini and they turned out great. Good way to use up all that zuchini from my garden.

Wonderful!  The only thing that I did extra was add a little more Old Bay because of some of the reviews and we loved them.  Even my little guy ate them.  They taste exactly like crab cakes....thanks Patti Jo

Told my family they were having "crabbie patties".  DH was fooled and he liked them.  The 4 year old ate them, but the 8 year old could not be fooled and he did not like them.  I thought they weren't bad.  Easy to do, not too mushy as I drained the zuchhini well during the day.  Thanks for a new idea for a family in a food rut!

These were delightfully crispy and reasonably tasty.  I didn't have quite enough zucchini so mine held together very well although they tasted a little "bready" (my fault, not the recipe's).  I did not drain the zucchini, but it didn't seem to affect the outcome.  I was afraid they would taste too strongly of Old Bay, but I think if I made them again I would use even a little more. Worth a try for something different with zucchini.

I was so disappointed with this recipe.  I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and baked the patties instead of frying.  Even though I drained the zucchini, the patties could barely keep together when shaped.  Once cooked, they were bland and totally unappealing.  They had the look of crab cakes, but definitely no where near the taste.  I do not recommend this unless you find some *really* tasty and creative ways to jazz it up!

As my husband said "Awesome". These were exceptionally good. Do remember to drain your zuc for a bit. They are full of water and draining and squeezing out the excess really helps make them easier to work with. You will love this recipe. And I know there is no crab in them, but you could fool me! Thanks for the recipe

Easy, quick, and very good!  Like other reviewers said, make sure to drain your zucchini as best as you can (I just squeezed it in my hands over the sink, worked great).  I added a little extra Old Bay and a tiny garlic.  Baked instead of fried (350 degrees for about 15mins on each side).  I thought these needed a sauce to go on top, so next time I'll make one to go along with them!

I thought these tasted very good, but crab? Not that I thought. I made a few modifications. First I let the shredded zucchini drain over nite in the fridge, added a bit more Old Bay, used part crumbs and part ground up oatmeal (ran out of crumbs) and I baked them. I baked them for about 30 minutes on each side  @350 on a sheet that I sprayed with olive oil. Quite yummy and the actual prep time making them was quick.

My family enjoyed these. I made a few changes based on previouse reviews. I squeezed the zucchini in a dish towel to dry them out, used panko insted of bread crumbs and flour, and doubled the Old Bay seasoning. I served these with Ranch Dressing. Yummy, but  didn't taste like crab.

Personally, I thought this was an okay recipe. I experimented on it while my zucchini-hating husband was out of town. But I know that it would be wasted effort to get him to enjoy it, so I won't put the effort into making it a second time for him. (And it tastes like zucchini patties, not crab.)

I wouldn't necessarily say that these taste like crab, but regardless - we LOVED them.  I used olive oil in place of both the butter and the vegetable oil, and they were still fabulous.

Delicious "crab" cakes! I didn't have zucchini on hand so I used yellow squash instead and added a little more than 1 tsp of Old Bay  seasoning. They turned out perfect.

I love this recipe.  It really is a great way to use all of the leftover zucchini you get from your garden.  I did dread the cakes in breadcrumbs instead of flour--they come out crunchy and delicious.  Excellent recipe.

I made this recipe and didn't tell anyone what they were. Someone asked if there was crab in them! I almost added too much of the Old Bay Seasoning. A little goes a long way.

This is truly a fantastic recipe.  As mentioned a number of times previously, get at much water as possible out of the zucchini.  I thought i got enough out the first time (and believe me, i got a lot out), but they were still maybe a bit too mushy.  Next time i'll try the suggestion of letting it dry out for a period of time instead of just squeezing all the excess out.  I used double the old bay, but that was simply personal preference.  All in all, a great vegitarian find.

These will definitely be a regular in our household. Just make sure you get as much liquid out of the zucchini before mixing.  We even let our zucchini sit in the fridge over night to dry out more. My hubby says they are better than any crabcakes he has ever had.  I used about twice as much Old Bay.  Outstanding!

Yum!  Definately a new favorite for me.  I dont know if I would say it tastes like crab, but they are really really good.  My husband loved them too.  Very easy to make, the only work involved is grating the zucchini.  I did squeeze out as much moisture from the zucchini first, and mine came out nice and golden.  Thank you!

This is a keeper!

I added parmesan cheese to the mixture, didn't dredge in flour and fried in a non-stick skillet w/o oil. Maybe because of my changes, the patties stayed soft in the middle - more like a potato pancake. My husband is not a zuc lover, but grudgingly gave his approval to this one. Great flavor - thanks!

These were very good. I am glad that I read the reviews before I started. I took the advice of others by salting and draining the zucchini. Also I used Japanese panko as suggested instead of the breadcrumbs and flour. I used more Old Bay also. Definitely not "crab" but a  very good vegetable course.

These were okay. The texture was right but there seemed to be not much flavour. Also, despite draining them on paper towel after cooking them in the oil, they still seemed too oily.

Mine were pretty "watery". They fried up nicely but tasted more bland than I had expected. They were good but they sure didn't taste like crab cakes to me.

Awesome recipe!  My guests and I loved them.  I made them last night and my husband and I are already craving more!  Do drain the zucchini well.  I, like others who reviewed, did add more of the Old Bay seasoning.

I made these without reading the reviews first.  I guess I should have, because they were very mushy inside.  They did not taste like "crab cakes" at all.  Maybe I expected too much.

Really good! Use extra Old Bay and serve them quick. They taste great right out of the pan, but start to get mushy if you eat the rest of your meal first - draining might help this a bit.

These were so good!  My whole family really enjoyed this. I cut down the recipe to use up one half of a zucchini I had left over from making zucchini bread.  It's a nice break from traditional vegetable recipes.

What can I add without being redundant?  These cakes are a tasty and interesting way to get rid of that unaviodable zucchini population explosion in the garden!  When you've saturated your neighbors with all they can stand, hand them another zucchini or two along with this recipe and they'll take more!

These tasted pretty good when they were still hot and strait from the pan, but after they sat alittle bit the taste changed alittle.  My kids wouldn't eat them, but they are picky eaters.  I added a shredded potato, salt, and pepper.  That helped the taste I think.  It was worth trying.

These are delicious- but please don't try to pass them off as crab cakes! They are great tasting zucchini cakes. I doubled the Old Bay, and dredged them in Parmesan cheese. We loved them, but whoever met a green crab??

Very good.  I drained the zucchini for about 45 minutes first with a tsp. or so of salt sprinkled over.  Didn't have any problems holding together after that.  Even my kids eat them!

Everyone in my family LOVES this dish! They are pretty easy to prepare, and absolutely delicious. Just one problem -- I CAN'T MAKE ENOUGH! No matter how many I cook, people want more. As a vegetarian, it's nice to have a tasty, satisfying new dish to add to the repertoire.

This recipe is wonderful. Recently my husband had developed an allergy to shellfish. This recipe was wonderful for him. He and I enjoyed them. I also served them with cocktail sauce. I will definitely makes these again

I had to add 4X the amount of old bay but these cakes were excellent. Just remember to drain the zucchini. Otherwise, the batter is too wet.

Tasted good, but I don't think it would've passed for crab.  A nightmare to fry up because it wouldn't hold together.  I squeezed the zuc dry per some of the suggestions.  I won't rave about it, but it tasted ok.

I made for the family and it got mixed reviews.  The flavor was very mild and consistency a little wet.  Next time I try it I will add more bread crumbs and probably 2x the Old Bay seasoning.  These do not work well for warm-ups, so don't make more than you can eat in one sitting.

Although I substituted the Old Bay seasoning (couldn't find it in New Brunswick) for another table blend (is the Old Bay really the key to the crab taste?), I thoroughly enjoyed those zuc crab cakes.  They're great with ketchup or a dijon mayo with a side of corn on the cob.  I gave the recipe to my friends...I can't wait to eat them again!

This recipe was surprisingly delicious.  It gets five stars from me in all categories except the quickness rating because you need to allow a couple of hours for the zucchini to drain.

Needless to say, I was skeptical...especially since my husband insists he HATES zucchini!  After reading the reviews I figured I would try them and see if everyone was right.  Well, this is a super recipe and although I have eaten GREAT crab cakes, this could have fooled even me.  My husband ate one and said they were great, but asked if I'd sneeked in some zucchini noticing the green skin.  When I told him that there was NO crab, he was really shocked!  Yummy and so easy.  This is now in my recipe box.  I just LOVE this site!

Excellent way to use up that zucchini!  I used my food processor to grate the zucchini and found it to be a little runny.  Next time I will drain it for a while or just add more bread crumbs like I did this time.

Being from the New Orleans area we get a lot of fresh seafood and I have eaten and made my share of stuffed crabs and crab cakes. This recipe isn't as good as the real thing, but it is an excellent substitute. I served them with a horseradish mayo sauce. I used green onins and italian seasoned bread crumbs. My husband didn't know it wasn't crab until I told him! He ate the leftovers on a bun for lunch the next day! By the way you really need to drain the zucchini.

These are excellent and a great use for the abundance of zucchini.  I did have to add extra bread crumbs it wasn't thick enough to form a patty, it might have helped to drain the zucchini to remove some liquid.

This is a winner!!!  I jazzed it up bit with finely chopped green pepper and jalapeno pepper.  I also substituted half of the white/yellow onion with green onion and I have cooked this in both a frying pan and a deep fryer.  I like the deep fryer better.  Thanks Patti Jo!  This is a great recipe.

I tried these last night and was surprised how delicious they were...The family was really please
and yes they tasted like crab cakes!
If everything vegetarian tasted this good, I would turn vegetarian in a minute.

My daughter and I are vegetarian, while my husband is not.  It was a pleasure for 
all of us to eat the "same" meal.  My husband tried these along side his "real" ones
and liked them just as well.

This may very well be our favorite recipe on MyRecipe.com.  We shipped a 1 lb container of Old Bay seasoning to England because of this recipe.  Put it in your recipe box now, because if you make it once you'll want to make it again.  Hooray for Connie's Crabless Cakes!

I guess I'm the only person who wasn't a big fan of this recipe. I was excited to try it after reading all the rave reviews. But I found them too soggy, and something was definitely missing from the taste. I may try them again with a few alterations.

Wow this phenomenal! We had it with a nice remoulade but they're just as good solo. Will definitely make again!
