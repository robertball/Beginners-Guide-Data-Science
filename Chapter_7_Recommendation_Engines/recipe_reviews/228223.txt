I made this following the recipe pretty closely. Used quite a bit more seasoning than called for and a blend of pepper jack, havarti and sharp cheddar as I'm not much a fan of mozzarella. The pie is very creamy, not wet at all and the vegies on top get a little browned. I liked the flavor a lot; being in a fall mode. Is very filling & would make a great brunch, lunch or dinner dish.

Very tasty. However, it was a bit runny. Next time, I'll reduce the half-and-half to 1/2 C, not 3/4 C. (Actually I used milk, and the taste was excellent.) I think that'll solve the problem perfectly. I also shredded the zucchini, since it was a lot faster to do than slicing it. Another change for next time: 2 med zucchinis instead of the 3 used. I added steamed broccoli and spinach, which added some lovely green to the quiche. Yum!

I have made this recipe several times, only it was under a different submission. I came back to make it yet again today, and the old recipe was gone, but this one had appeared. Either way, delicious quiche and I don't change a thing.

I accidentally only bought 1 lb of zucchini and if there was 1/2 lb more it would have been way too much (1 lb was almost too much).  The pie pan was overflowing and it took 1-1/2 hours to cook.  It was good but seemed to be missing something.

Very nice and moist. The vegetables are perfect. I didn't add mushrooms (just MR'd out lately). What a nice taste the ricotta was.

Looks good, but waiting for comments. Will be used at church for Easter morning brunch between services - reheated. Used butternut squash rice, mushrooms, yellow squash, onions, and 2% milk instead of cream. Made 2 pies - did not want spillover. Smells yummy. Hope I get a piece!

Taste is good, but mine did not turn out like the picture. I could only fit 1 cup of mozzarella into the pie and my filling was still dripping over the sides. I would recommend grating the zucchini or cutting it down into something smaller than the thin slices, at the very least half or quarter the slices.  Maybe only use 1 lb instead of 1.5.

My whole family loves this!  It's a great way to use up zucchini, too.
