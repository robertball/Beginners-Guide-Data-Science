Wow this is the best BBQ sauce recipe I have ever made! I used it on ribs and I am sold - all the other recipes I have for BBQ sauce are out the door as this one is the one I will use for ever! I would like to offer an update to a couple comments received from the reviewers. 1) This is a sweeter sauce feel free to reduce the amount of brown sugar; may even consider replacing some of the brown sugar with honey.  For those with a concern of it being too thin, I have placed it on the stove bringing, it to a boil then simmering until you get your desired consistency.

Finally, the perfect bbq sauce.  We prefer to substitute bourbon for rum, and be sure to use LOW SODIUM soy sauce.  It's very quick and easy to make. Everyone raved over the pork bbq; I just placed a pork loin into the crock pot, poured the bbq sauce over, and let it cook for hours.  Made a side of homemade coleslaw, and we were livin'! Great recipe!

For years I have been developing new BBQ sauce recipes and looking at existing ones.  I have jsut tried it and served it with Baby Back Ribs- I doubled the recipe because there never is enough sauce.  Here is what I canged:
Used Myers Dark Rum- excellent flavor and color, and I added an 8 oz can of drained crushed pineapple.  No juice- just the pineapple.  Simmered for 30 minutes, cooled it and used it.  Superb!!!!  A new favorite.

This is one of the best BBQ sauce I have ever had! Like most people said, it was really way too sweet using a cup of brown sugar. I will definitely cut it in half next time. I also skipped the rum and any other alcoholic beverage. It still tastes fantastic! I turned up the heat to a medium-low so I could get a little boiling action going to thicken a sauce a bit. This is great with chicken!

The only reason this didn't get 5*'s is because it is soooooo salty!  Otherwise, the flavor is excellent - I will try again with reduced sodium soy and see if it makes a difference.  Otherwise, incredibly easy and quick to make.  I love dark rum in this for flavor.  I used 1 tsp garlic powder prepared yellow mustard.  Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely Awesome is right!  I made this for my husband and he said it was by far the best bbq sauce he has ever tasted.  I actually put it on top of salmon and the bbq sauce complimented it perfectly...can't wait to try it on chicken!

This is excellent!  I minced one of the garlic cloves, and diced the other for the texture.  Also, I recommend the dark rum and 1/8 tsp Cayenne pepper for a little heat.  This is wonderful on chicken.

I ran out of store bought BBQ sauce and decided to make one from scratch.  This was delicious.  I was skeptical about using rum as an ingredient but the sauce turned out fabulous.  (used spiced rum).  The sauce wasn't as thick as store bought.  I may try to thicken it with some flour/water next time.

I love this sauce. It is sweet and spicy and tastes great on chicken. I will say that when making this  I was forced to use Southern Comfort instead of rum due to an innovatory mix up with the Hubby and instead of chili sauce I used Valentina brand Mexican Hot sauce as a substitution, (I really had no idea what was in my kitchen when I started cooking.) I was worried about how it would turn out, but I was really surprised on how good it is. I will try it with the rum, but I feel that I will fall back on the SoCo for certain foods. Thanks for sharing this!

Loved the recipe...gave it 4 stars, because for my taste a full cup of brown sugar is extremely sweet. Just my taste. I cut the brown sugar to a half a cup, used Tennessee whiskey instead of rum (all I had on hand). Very interesting flavor....a darker, thicker sauce, simular to "store bought" consistency. I did add a 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne for some heat. Again this sauce is very good, I like the chili sauce in the recipe.....very good on a pulled pork sandwich.

Chili sauce comes in a bottle  and can be found near the ketchup, mustard, worchestershire sauce, hot sauce.  Heinz makes it and it's delish.  Great substitute for ketchup.

This recipe is truly a keeper!

This sauce is tasty but far from the "best I've ever had" which soaks these review as much as the rum does your meat from this recipe.  And that's just why, in my opinion, this sauce doesn't deserve the five stars many give it.  The rum is just too strong in this recipe.  Backing it off by a quarter, if not a half, will go a long way in making this better.  Thickening it up with more ketchup will help, too.  This isn't a terrible BBQ sauce, not by any means, it's very good and tasty when the right amount of alcohol is added.

I am very glad that I omitted the brown sugar, I am sure that it would be very, very sweet!  I made mine using bourbon instead of rum.  I think it was overpowered by too much soy, worchestershire and bourbon.  It was plenty sweet even without the sugar.  I did like the use of chili sauce in this recipe, but I won't be making this again.  It's not for me.

Well, I screwed up this recipe and used Thai chili sauce instead of regular. Not what I was wanting but tastes great but with an asain twist! Am saving it to use on grilled chix next week. Now my husbands off to buy regular chili sauce so I can make regular BBQ sauce for my pulled pork for  tomorrow.

My hubby loved this sauce!  I made pork in the crockpot, and then after draining and shredding it, I put it back in with THIS sauce, and OMG!  My hubby couldn't get enough!  We didnt have the chili sauce or mustard, but we added some rice vinegar a bit more ketchup and some more spices.  AWESOME!

Very good, very easy. Had all the ingredients on hand (helps to have a rum drinker in the house) and cooks in no time.  I'm curious  to try it with maybe bourbon.  This is a sweet bbq sauce, if you're looking for more tomatoey or vinegary this isn't it but it is really good.

The name says it all and then some! I made it last nite for a back rib dinner. It's one of our fav foods. Well I can tell you that we don't want any other sauce, bought or homemade. One of our sons always had to have Bulls Eye, but no more.  Next time I'll try it on chicken breasts and meatballs. Thanks Joel for a fabulous recipe!!!

This sauce is great.  I didn't have any chilli sauce so I used Franks hot sauce and only about a 1/4 cup and it still has a nice after bit. This is a good simple sauce for anyone trying to make their own bbq. I couldn't stop tasting while cooking it.

Great recipe, thank you!  Made this last night to go with our chicken wings. Like others, I only used 1/2 cup of sugar.  What a nice change to store bought sauce.  It's a pretty small batch when it's done, so I had to make another.  Next time I'll know to double or triple the recipe.

My boyfriend and I made this to go with some meatballs we made...yum yum! We put it in the slow cooker with the meatballs and used scotch instead of rum because we didn't have any, but the sauce was absolutely delicious.  I ate the meatballs for lunch the next say and they may have even tasted better with the sauce.

Awesome!  Very easy, quick and flavorful. Very little to chop - just the garlic and you could use garlic powder if you wanted to.

This recipe is wonderful!  I used a hot chile sauce and the resulting bbq sauce is spicy and very flavorful.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!  I will definitely be making it again.

I have made the recipe dozens of times.  I've made it "as is" as many times as I've changed or added things, all depending on what I was using it for.  Today I used the dark rum (like I've done many times before), took away a little of the brown sugar, added a little more chili sauce, and added 1/2 tsp of liquid smoke.  This is the premier base sauce!!!  Experiment and have fun.  Thanks for such an easy and adaptive recipe.

Today I was making all kinds of BBQ sauces and I like this one the best, but I made a small tweak to this as I like sweet more then heat in a BBQ sauce, but not too sweet.  I only used 1/2 C brown sugar,  2 TBSP Frank's hot sauce instead of chile sauce, and for a smooth sauce used 3/8 tsp garlic powder instead of crushed, and no black pepper.  But as other reviews suggested use only half the sugar and I must full heartedly agree.  It does not make much so, I made a double patch for tonight's grilled pork chop dinner for a family of six, so that I could have enough left over to make a BBQ chicken pizza. By the way, with a double batch I filled 1 pint jar. Next time I will  x4 this recipe to can some for later.

I do not cook with alcohol of any kind.So I will make it without any alcohol added.I also do not see any vinegar in the ingredients.That will give the tanginess to it.

This was my first time making bbq sauce, and I was very pleased!  I find it to be a bit sweet, but me and the wife loved it on pulled pork sandwiches.  I've read a few of the reviews, and next time might just try tweaking the recipe a bit.

Fantastic! I added a few dashes of habanero sauce because we like spicy food. Also I didn't have mustard so I left it out, but it was still the best BBQ sauce I have ever had. My husband agrees.

Made this tonight and this was SUPER!,Today was a gloomy day didnt feel like grocery shopping had almost everything for it, taking note of others advice i lowered the brown sugar to 1/2 cup instead of a cup. says use chili sauce i had franks hot sauce and used that amount, i did not have much alcohol in the house but a smidgen of bacardi so only used that small amount, I did not have 1/4 cup soy sauce i used about 5 teaspoons of what i had left and substituted the rest with terriyaki sauce,i used the full amount of worstechire sauce, used garlic powder instead of garlic and 1 tsp dry mustard.
I placed all ingrediants in my slow cooker on high setting and let it simmer for about 2 and a half to 3 hours..I had 4 cans of Canned Chicken chunks ,I took them out after the 3hours of cooking ,drained them and dumped them in the cooker and sauce, and turned to low setting for another 1 and a half, you would never know the chicken was canned chicken it soaked up all the sauce like pulled chicken or pork and was the best sauce ive ever had in my life SERIOSLY! my husband was skeptical at first but said this was beyond 5 stars in the end and finished off his plate and all the leftovers...SUPER JOB WITH THIS RECIPE

Awesome sauce!!! I agree it does have the flavor of the rum - but I love it. I did change a few things, I used sweet asian chili sauce instead of chili sauce, I reduced the brown sugar to 3/4 cup. I also didn't have quite enough worchestershire sauce so used almost an 1/8 cup. I then added a couple tablespoons of red onion. Love the flavor, and it is a nice consistency, not overly thick. I will use this one again!!! :)

Great stuff.....I brought to a boil and then let it simmer which gave it a "stiffer" consistency. Also added some crushed onions and kicked it up with some red pepper.....first time I left it as written, and it was soooo good.

I don't feel right giving this any less than 5 stars. Although I don't really feel it is a 5 star sauce, I modified it a lot... so if it's less than perfect- it's probably my fault. I didn't have rum or bourbon on hand so I just left that out (which may be a big reason why it's not quite wonderful to me). I love onions so I added about 1/2 a cup of onions. 

This ended up being very sweet AND very spicy. I should have paid attention to the reviews and added less brown sugar. I added a bit more ketchup to try to minimize the sweetness.I made this today so it could sit a day in the fridge and then I plan to use it with chicken in my slow cooker to make pulled bbq chicken sandwiches.

I'll come back and let everyone know how they turn out :)

This was just ok - a little to watery for my taste.  It was better on the chicken that I froze and then defrosted and cooked then on the chicken that I used it immediatly on.  I need to find a way to thicken it up.....not a finger licking bbq sauce but still tasty

MMM awesome it is! I made it exaclty as stated, but I chopped the garlic instead of pressing. I used a Puerto rican rum called Ron Del Borillito. It is not a coconut rum, its less sweet. If i used coconut rum i think it might have been sweeter, but it was just sweet enough. It was not spicy but more "flavorful" in taste. (im sure you can adjust the spicyness if you want)This will be my BBQ recipe from now on- thanks!

Tried this recipe tonight minus the Rum and it turned out better then I expected. It had the perfect amount of heat which was perfect for my taste.  Tried it with backed chicken this time and the family were raving about it so this is my sauce from now on

I'm sure this recipe is good as is, but I had to make substitutions based on what I had on hand and it came out fantastic!  I used 8oz chiles in adobo instead if chili sauce, 8 oz tomato sauce in place of ketchup, and bourbon instead of rum. Run the chiles through the blender first.  This does make it quite spicy with a smoky flavor but we loved it.

We found this recipe the one might in a hurry to get food ready before a big party. In a rush at the store we accidentally bought sweet chili dipping type sauce from the Asian foods section of the store instead of regular chili sauce. It was the best mistake I ever made. It's our absolute standby for pork. I will never use anything else again! One of these days I will try this recipe with regular chili sauce but the other is so perfectly sweet and a little more vinegary so it's perfect. Thanks for the recipe! Ps. We leave out the rum. Don't need it when doing the sweet chili dipping sauce

This was sooo good but put my own twist on it and we loved it. I added a half cup of beer, low sodium soy, and 1 teaspoon of natural hickory liquid smoke. This is to die for great. Thanks

AMAZING end result!!!!... BUT be careful what type and how much of the chile sauce you add, especially if you simmer it for 30 minutes.

Made with Splenda to make it low-carb, used bourbon instead of rum, and used prepared mustard instead of dry mustard.  My husband was very impressed.

Apparently you must LOVE the taste of rum to like this BBQ sauce as that is the predominant flavor.  My husband came into the kitchen and asked me what the smell was while the sauce was simmering.  I assured him that the rum flavor would mellow and just add a complexity to the sauce (like when adding wine to a sauce), but I was wrong as it just tasted of rum in the end.  I will have to keep searching for an awesome BBQ sauce, I guess.

Great flavor. It had more of a kick than I was anticipating. Next time I will use less chili sauce. I let it simmer for quite a while to thicken up. Note to self: don't thicken too much (it sets more once put in the fridge).

Excellent! Already making a second batch. I am tripling it to keep in the fridge as our go-to bbq sauce. So easy and rivals our family's old favorite Sweet Baby Rays.

I am an all around rum girl, and after reading the many complaints about how much rum flavor remained in the sauce, I was excited! Well, mine didn't end up tasting like rum at all (no one even knew there was rum in it), but it was still awesome on beef ribs. It was very spicy from the Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce, which was exactly what I was hoping for. It was not too sweet or too salty to me. Perhaps it depends on the brands you use. I used Sriracha for the chili sauce, Kikkoman Tamari Soy Sauce, and Monarch Silver Rum. Also, I was out of fresh garlic, so I used two teaspoons of garlic powder instead. Thanks for sharing this recipe. I will be making this again. For those of you that managed the extreme rum flavor, let me know what brand you used, please! I'd like it more rummy! ;)

Couldn't get my usual sauce at the store so I tried this recipe. Got raves! I was afraid it would be too sweet but it had the right combination of sweet and spicy. I didn't have any chili saice so I used Beaver Cocktail Sauce and I added smoked paprika and chili powder. YUMMY!

Enjoyed this sauce immensely, the only change was using 1/2 cup of brown sugar, and 3 cloves of garlic.  Next time I may try it with Jack Daniels just for a change, but will definitely use it again.  Will probably double the recipe so I have extra, but this one did cover two racks of ribs that I did on my Big Green Egg smoker.

Being on a low sodium diet means you basically can't buy most any sauce or dressing, which makes BBQ a real challenge. However, this recipe did the trick with a few substitutions: Coconut Aminos for the soy sauce, and Hunts unsalted Ketchup (you may have to order these online). I also replaced the rum with a half cup of orange juice! It was absolutely divine on some slow cooked pulled pork!

DEE-LISH!!  I also used dark rum & added a few drops of  liquid smoke . I also used Bragg's Liquid Aminos in place of soy sauce. The combination of the flavors was marvelous! thanks

As others have indicated this really is an excellent homemade BBQ Sauce. I used it to make BBQ Pulled Chicken in my Slow Cooker, adding 1/2 diced onion. 6 large Chicken Breasts, seasoned first, then covered in this BBQ Sauce ( I doubled the recipe ) at low heat for 6 hours was perfect.

This recipe was delicious! I did make changes to it though only because I didn't have child sauce in the house. I used a 1/2 cup of ketchup, added a couple tablespoons of molasses, and a little honey.  It was really taste and I would definitely make it again!!!!

At first reading all the ingredients, I was sceptical.   But I’m glad I listened to the other part of my brain, because it turned out to be a great sauce and made a double batch for later.

Followed the recipe EXACTLY.  

Sauce tastes great - but not like BBQ sauce - hence the 2 Stars.

4 Stars if it was re-labeled as Teriyaki sauce!!!

I should have realized this would be too hot using Sriracha HOT Chili Sauce. If I'd reduced it down from 1/2cup to 2 tbsp might have been OK but wayyyyy too hot with that much Sriracha. I substituted Johnny Walker Red Label Scotch for the rum since so many reviewers said it was too sweet (and it is all I had on hand). That was fine but Bourbon would be better. It thickened nicely simmered on low for 30minutes.  I gave it to my neighbor who grows hot chili's in his yard. He liked the heat.  Will retry with a milder chili sauce and Elijah Craig Small Batch bourbon which I know I like. Just wanted to warn you about the Sriracha!

This sauce is way too sweet, way too salty, and way too spicy for our family’s taste. I was surprised, because I have some family members that love very spicy food. It could probably be adjusted; however, I’ll probably just try a different recipe.

This truly is an awesome bbq sauce.  So easy to make with ingredients you probably already have in your cupboard.  I didn’t have any rum so I just left it out and it was still amazing.  I would suggest making a double recipe just to be sure you have enough for your pulled pork, chicken or ribs.

I used white pepper and then juice of 1 lemon to bring up the acid. It was a bit thin so added cornstarch to thicken.

Excellent!!! And it was easy to make too! I chose this recipe because the ingredients are all items that I had on hand. Except for the dry mustard so I used prepared mustard instead.  My boyfriend didn't trust that a homemade sauce would be better than the overpriced specialty sauce he bought (an argument we have quite frequently... Store bought vs homemade) so we ended up making our individual racks of ribs with our respective sauces. Needless to say he was very disappointed with his own and ate some of mine.  Though he did say that it was too sweet, he also hates to admit when he is wrong! The fact that he has leftover ribs and I don't says a lot more! This sauce was so good that  I will most likely never buy a bottle of sauce again!

I've been making this BBQ sauce for years, but only now reviewing it because I've only now joined the site.  As many have suggested, cut the sugar in half unless you like a very sweet sauce.  I like subbing half of the sugar I do use with honey.  Low sodium soy sauce is a must in this house.  Since I didn't know what sort of chili sauce was meant, I use siracha, which gives it quite a kick, but it's good that way!  Great with rum, spiced rum, southern comfort, and probably numerous other alcohols.  This BBQ sauce contains no vinegar when most do, but between the alcohol and the siracha, I don't miss it.  I mostly use it stirred into shredded chicken, pork, or beef (and it tastes great on all 3) to make BBQ sandwiches.

Wow!  I used Cocktail sauce in place of the Chili sauce as that's what I had on hand.  I also used my favorite rum, Mount Gay.  (the best rum for rum & cokes) :) I'll continue to use this recipe, everyone in the family loved it!

This recipe turned out amazing. I didn't have powdered mustard or chili sauce, so I added chili powder and liquid mustard instead and it still turned out great.

This is an excellent recipe! My only change(as per previous reviewers)was to halve the sugar& add a DASH of liquid smoke. I tripled the recipe and used it in conjunction with the "Slow Cooker Pulled Pork". So very glad I had some left over to use on turkey burgers and as a dipping sauce for grilled chicken! I am always looking for ways to avoid pre-made, bottled or boxed foods. Thank you, now I will never have to buy bottled BBQ sauce ever again!!

Love this BBQ sauce!!  I omit the rum and use minced garlic which I strain out after it has cooked.  My family loves it!  Very easy to make and can last in the fridge for quite some time.

My husband really enjoyed this sauce! Could this be used in a slow cooker?
