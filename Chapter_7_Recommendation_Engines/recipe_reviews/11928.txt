This is a wonderful pasta salad! I added chopped tomatoes and onions, and used Asiago cheese instead of Monterey Jack (it was what I had on hand). Using vegetable rotini also adds lots of color. Thanks, Linda!

Really good pasta salad.  Made for a family get together and it was inhaled!  I left out the cheese cubes and added some grape tomaotes I cut in half, 1/4 of a large green pepper and just a little minced vadalia onion.  I've made this pasta salad before without the Old Bay, but I really like the addition of it.  Made it a little spicy but it wasn't so much that my 2 year old couldn't eat it. Delicious!

I believe this might have been a great recipe, but I had to dump it down the disposal after adding the recommended amount of Old Bay seasoning.  It may have been a typo, as it was more than a full bottle of seasoning and just TOO much.

This salad was a big hit at two parties this summer.  I used pretty much the same ingredients but added a lot more veggies.  The combination of the cajun spice and Italian dressing works very well.  I didn't have Monterey Jack so I cut up mozarella cheese sticks along with cubed summer sausage.  I added cut up carrots, onion, tomato, broccoli and marinated artichoke hearts.  I made it the night before to let the flavors blend.  And also to let the pasta soak up the dressing so the salad wouldn't be too wet.  But extra dressing can be added before serving if it's too dry. Will make again!

I liked the addition of the old bay, I think it set it apart from other pasta salads.  The only thing I changed was using regular italian dressing instead of zesty which worked really well!

Very good flavor but MAN was it spicy!!! We added mayo to the leftovers to bring it down a notch and it had a milder curry flavor.

I made this for our beach camping trip, and everyone loved it both at dinner and the next day sitting on the beach. I loved the mellowness of the jack cheese, and the zippi-ness of the Old Bay seasoning and Italian dressing. Will make this again-in fact this week. Its perfect to keep in the fridge when its hot outside.

i've had a similar recipe for quite some time although without the seasoning and with cherry tomatoes cut in half and tossed with the salad. it's delish and perfect for a quick and healthy filler-upper.

I used tortellini instead of rotini for some more flavor. I only used 8 oz. Cut the Italian dressing in half. Used 3 1/2 tsp Old Bay (it wasn't spicy enough when I halved the original recipe). Left other ingredients as recipe called for. Was still missing something, so I added some tomato cubes and some extra sharp cheese cubes. With my changes I'd rate it a 4 but as written a 3 is as high as I would give it.

This was good!  I doctored it.  Added tomato pieces, chopped celery, green peppers, and carrots, forgot the cheese (not intentionally), and used spaghetti (out of rotini).  I didn't have zesty Italian dressing but used Good Seasons regular Italian.  I think it was the addition of Old Bay, which I am a big fan of. Definately one of the best (cold) pastas I have had.  Will make again.

We have made this four times now and loved it more each time. However, it didn't go over as well at a function as many people wouldn't even try it because they don't care for olives.

I am actually on here getting the recipe again to make this for a girl at work who tried it when I brought left overs for lunch. The only think that I did differently was add tomatoes. Do not skip on the Old Bay seasoning.  I had no idea what it was but found it at WalMart, it adds a perfect flavor and it was not spicy like I had thought it would be.  Others mention this spice as being too much in quanity but if you read this there was a typo when the recipe was first posted on the amount.  Also DO make it the night ahead, this salad gets better overnight and stays tasting perfect for at least 3 days! I also used Kraft zesty italian and was SO glad I did. I dont use this type of dressing on my salads so I didnt know what brand to go with. Their dressing is thick and chunky, unlike when I attempted to make this in the past the dressing was so oily (dont remember that brand I used).  Thanks for the recipe!

My family LOVED it!!! I used fat free italian dressing because that's what I had on hand, and it was great! Also used bow ties instead of rotini, because the store I happened to go to doesn't sell rotini(go figure!)...next time might add some salami, as it seems that it would also be great in there!

I loved this pasta salad. I added cherry tomatoes, but followed everything else the same. I felt the tomatoes added more color, interest and flavor. I will definitely make again.

This is a great start to a wonderful pasta salad. I used extra minced garlic and black pepper. I subbed shredded Parm for the Jack cheese, cause that's all I had, but I'm SURE its better with the Jack. I felt like it needed more veggies, so next time I will add halved grape tomatoes and diced carrot pieces. Thanks for the recipe!

This is really good...but better after I added a ton more veggies. I used chopped zucchini, cukes, grape tomatoes, sliced black olives, and a red & green pepper. The flavor just seemed to pop. Really good pasta salad for a hot summer night.

I didnt put the cheese, put 4 tsp old bay, used 8 oz of olives, and added 1 large tomato and 1 tsp salt to it and used good seasons packaged italian dressing(the kind you make at home).  My family and friends loved it.

YUM...I was skeptical about the Old Bay - it's a staple in my pantry but have never used it for anthing but seafood and would never have come up with this.  Oh how narrow my vision has been lol!  I forgot the cheese (!?!?) and it's still excellent.  I'm sure it'll be a BBQ hit - thanks for sharing!!

I used whole wheat rotini, 1/2 chopped onion, cheddar cheese(thats all I had on hand). Didn't have any of that seasoning, but used YAYA-B Greek Seasoning instead. Was good. I would make again. Is a versatile salad, that you can vary ingredients, and it will still taste good. I think I will try pepper jack cheese next time, and add some cherry tomatoes, and peperonni also. Maybe red peppers also.//2nd time I made I used garlic/onion jack cheese, red pepper, onion, whole wheat pasta, and all rest of original recipe ingredients. I will try more of the old bay next time I think-perhaps 1 teaspoon more. I think it needs a little more zing with just the old bay. Otherwise, I think I almost prefer the greek seasoning.

I love this recipe!  I'm not a big fan of mayo, so I love that this uses italian dressing.  I used multi-grain pasta, used 4 tsp. of old bay, used mozzarella cheese, and added red onion.  I'd definately make this again!

I liked this very much.  I took out the celery and the olives because of some whiney men in our group of friends, added some slightly nuked broccoli and some halved grape tomatoes.  I made it the day ahead and then throughout the next day continued to add dressing and Old Bay until it was where I thought it should be.

This is a really good pasta salad, and it's a really simple recipe.  I made it on the morning of the 4th of July, and the flavor was great by the late afternoon when we ate.  We had plenty left over (it makes a lot) that kept suprisingly well, too.

This is a totally average pasta salad.  Its good, yes.  Most people will eat it and enjoy it.  But you won't get any raves about how amazing it was, and requests for the receipe.  So, its a good, simple, make-ahead dish that everyone will appreciate, but nothing special that will wow anyone.

I never would have thought it was the Old Bay that pulled this pasta salad together. I made this a day ahead, and by the next day, all the flavors melded together perfectly. Quick, simple ingredients, and tasty; you can bet I'm keeping this one. Thank you!

This pasta salad is great! Although I didn't have any of that seasoning, I did add some different spices and it went over very well with everyone. I also added some carrots and celery, just for more vegetables (and to try and "hide" the fact that I used too much noodles in it haha) Perfect salad for a side dish. Thanks so much!
