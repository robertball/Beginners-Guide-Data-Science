Gathering the ingredients and making the pralines were pretty easy but the recipe needs more clearer instructions.  I had a hard time with melting the sugar at medium heat because it wouldn't melt and took the longest time to liquify, I would put it in between 7 and 8 (heat on the stove).  Also, the instructions weren't too clear of how long to heat the liquid sugars (I would say about 5 minutes without stirring) and dropping them by the spoonfuls, I had half my batch seize up on me and they didn't turn out into pralines cookies...more like pecan praline crumbles.  Finger Food anyone?  Overall, in the end, the Pralines were a hit (the ones that made it out...the crumbled pralines weren't that big)

As written, this recipe is a 1 or a 2, not because of taste, but because of presentation.  If made as directed, they will crumble to bits.  I am from New Orleans, where the pecan praline originated, and we NEVER put our pralines on wax paper.  The heat from the hot liquid will melt the wax right onto the surface, making them impossible to remove, without breaking into bits and pieces.  In New Orleans we use one of 2 surfaces-either a marble slab (done by most of the shops in the French Quarter that do demonstrations) or parchment paper.  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla because we love vanilla.  I only cooked them over the stove for 1-2 minutes.  One to 2 minutes will yield light creamy tan pralines.  Cooking them 5 or minutes will turn the sugar mixture a dark brown, which is still good to taste, just not that visually appealing.  Also, these will come out waif thin, which is how they serve them in New Orleans, rather than as a big puffed cookie type.  For thicker cookie like ones, just use less liquid.  With modifications I think this recipe is a 5.  It is the way I have seen them made since I was a little girl.

Very good!  However, I did add about 1/4 tsp vanilla extract to the mix to give them a little better flavor.  I cooked mine on medium-high heat to speed up the process, and to keep them from running all over the place I waited about ten seconds after taking them off the burner before dropping the first.

I followed the original recipe with no modifications to the ingredients, and my attempt was very successful. The only change that I implemented was placing the mounds of mixture on parchment paper instead of "generously buttered" cookie sheets/pans, and they lifted perfectly and the clean-up was a snap.  I think that I may add a bit of vanilla next time around and would also suggest waiting about 10 seconds before dropping the praline mixture. Thank you (and your Mom) for this recipe.

When I thought these were done cooking, I dropped the first few onto sheets, and they were too runny. I put the mixture back on the stove for a few seconds and they seized up. Be very careful about how long you let these cook. I also might add a tiny pinch of salt or use salted butter. Overall they tasted pretty good.

Taste- 5 stars; Directions: 3 stars; This was my first try at pecan pralines.  I just got a wild hair to try them and, for my first try, they turned out pretty good. The only change I made was using Splenda instead of sugar ( only because I don't keep sugar in my pantry).  A note for other first tryers: Don't over cook these or they become "pecan bricks" instead of pecan pralines. Thanks!

Recipe needs more guidance (i.e. length of time to boil).  I followed this recipe but added 1/4 tsp vanilla extract; however mixture was extremely runny it never "seized" up like others said.

Well, I guess I should have read the other review before trying this! I may have not waited long enough, but seize up on me it did!
Oh well, sugar + nuts = good :)
no matter what shape it is in :)

Used the recipe and it made them as advertised.  Slight change, used a splash of Mexican vanilla and dropped on parchment paper.  I'm not a chef, just a guy with a little time on my hands and a neighbor with pecan trees!

The recipe as written was a big ol' mess. Half the batch seized up on me and I had to reheat them with extra butter. After that they turned out okay. I will try a different recipe when I want to make them again.

This was my first attempt to make Pralines and with this recipe it was a DISASTER. In my opinion this recipe calls for way to many pecans. They did not stay together and the only places they stuck was the pan and the spoon. I will find another recipe before trying again.

I thought these turned out well. I heated the mixture on medium for about 10 minutes and it was still a little runny. Overall very tasty for how simple and easy it was to make them :)

These were okay. The sugar never really liquified so they were "grainy". I may have had my expectations set too high after having pralines from New Orleans... will keep  looking. Thanks anyway!

It was a good recipe and everyone raved about it, but it didn't set like it should have. A temperature to cook to would have been very helpful to me (I'm still a novice at cooking). Overall, still great!

The recipe worked for us because it didn't include any milk products (we used milk-free margarine).  The recipe should include instructions to "cook to a temperature of 239 degrees, then turn off heat and stir in pecans", just for clarity to other readers.   From there, you can let it thicken until ready to spoon out onto prepared sheets.

Great pecans. Suggestion possibly for those that had it seize up on them... I simply poured the pan onto a baking sheet and proceeded to constantly stir them/chop them with a rubber spatula. This allowed them to stay apart and also reduce the amount of sugar built up on them. It made them more crystallized, rather than turning into bricks. I wanted them for a salad, not a brick to eat for a snack. I actually put them into a colander with small enough holes to shake off excess sugar and just tossed them around in there till I had just the pecans remaining without all the powder.

This is very similar to the one I use, but I can see where there could be problems if you were unfamiliar with making pralines.  You 100% need a candy thermometer! When the temp reaches the soft ball stage, remove from heat, add butter, and spoon up.

I haven't tried this recipe yet, but I will!  Looks good & sounds easy.  The picture is wrong!  Under the photo is a link that says "1 of 3 photos"...click there and you'll see the actual picture of the pralines!
