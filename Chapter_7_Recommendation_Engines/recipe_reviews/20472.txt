This cake turned out phenomenal!  I changed the recipe quite a bit, so it would be more like a margarita.  I used white cake mix, and used lime juice where it called for lemon juice.  I made 2 separate batches of glaze.  I also used top shelf liquor; Jose Cuervo and Grand Mariner instead of triple sec.  Immediately when the cake came out of the oven I poked several holes in the cake and poured a shot of tequila over it, 2tbsp of grand mariner, and poured Â½  of one of the batches of glaze on it as well.  After allowing the cake to cool for 15 minutes I took the cake out of the pan and glazed the cake with the other half of the first batch of glaze.  Finally, about an hour later I glazed it with the 2nd batch of glaze.  I made this cake for a small, Mexican cuisine themed  get together at my house, everyone loved it So easy, moist, flavorful and delicious!  Will definitely make again!

Made this cake for a fiesta party and every one really liked it. I only changed one thing. I am not a drinker, so I couldnt see spending $25.00 on alcohol to make a cake, when I will never use the tequilla and triple sec for anything else. So I bought the Cuervo Margarita Mini's (the come in a 4 pack for about 6 dollars) and only used one of them in place of the required amount of tequilla and triple sec and it still turned out great! Using the mini's really cut down on the cost and it didnt give it too strong of a tequilla flavor! I had to duble the amount of powdered sugar, the glaze was way too thin

This was my first Bundt cake and was an emergency bake for an office party. I read many of the reviews and decided to use yellow cake, lemon pudding, and substituted equal parts of Bacardi non-alcoholic frozen margarita mix. I don't think the Police Department would go for the Tequila and Triple Sec. I also used the margarita mix as a substitute for the liquid in the icing - except the lime juice. Nothing beats fresh lime! The cake turned out absolutely beautiful! I added more confectioner's sugar to get a nice heavy white icing, and garnised with lime twists. It was an absolute HIT!!! The party honoree took most of the cake home before everyone could eat it up! I'm not a drinker, so my husband and I asked around about wheter it actually tasted like a Margarita. Nothing but nods of approval. This was a great alcohol free alternative.

This cake went over huge at my last get together.  Really simple to make.  If you can't find orange cake mix - substitute water in recipe with OJ!

Thank You Carol!!!  I won second place in a Latin Dessert Contest!  (won a free pound of expresso...)  I changed a few things.  I used the lemon cake and changed the juice to lime.  I also added more glaze to the cake.  I also found the judges licking the sides of the plate where the icing oozed.  I have been instructed by my teammates to make this again.

Wow, what a great cake.  I used the lemon cake also.  I tinted the glaze a cool green and also used the candy lime slices as a garnish.  It was so pretty.  I did put a little more booze in the cake and glaze which was great for me, maybe not everyone.  I took this to a mexican themed birthday party.  Everyone loved it and they were licking the glaze of the plate when the cake was gone.  I will make this again, and I have already given out the recipe twice.

Very good, but as everyone knows, you need a salted rim on a good margarita.  I love the flavor of sweet and salt together (sea salt caramels, anyone? chocolated covered salted pretzels? Yum).  So, to complete this recipe, which is sweet enough to be able to carry it off, I recommend you do one of two things -- sprinkle flaked kosher salt over the glaze before serving (not much is required), or, do as I did another time -- crush up pretzels very finely and scatter them on top. The sensation is quite good and fun, to boot (in fact, when I make margarita pie, I used crushed salted pretzels, sugar, and butter, to press as the crust).

This cake was GREAT!! I made it with a few changes: I used Betty Crocker Super Moist French Vanilla box cake, orange juice instead of water, and lime juice instead of lemon juice. I doubled the glaze and when I took it out of the oven, I poked holes in the bottom and put about 1/2 cup of it in and let it sit for ~10 minutes, then flipped it out on a wire rack and put the 1/3 of the remaining glaze on, waited 30 min, put 1/3 more on and waited 30 more min and put the last 1/3 on. Then, after the glaze had hardened, I squeezed lime juice on the cake and sprinkled coarse salt all over it. People really loved the sweet/salty combo, I got tons of compliments on this cake. Thanks for the recipe! :)

This cake was a hit at two different occasions I made it for.  I could not find orange cake mix, so I substituted with white cake mix and added 1 tablespoon of grated orange rind, squeezed some juice from the orange and added 2 teaspoons of orange extract.  I also made extra glaze and coated the cake again before serving.

I noticed in some of the reviews that people had issues with the cake sinking or deflating.  I'm willing to bet that the problem is that they were using smaller cake mixes that were 16.5oz rather than the 18.25oz listed in the recipe.  Last year Duncan Hines decreased their boxed cake mixes by 1.75oz and it makes a BIG difference if you are trying to "doctor" a mix.  I usually buy an extra box of cake mix so that I can get back to the original 18.25oz weight.  I hope that helps!

I made this for a friend's birthday.  It was a big hit with everyone.  I think it needs a bit more lime juice and thicker icing.

After 3 batches of individualy measured out cupcakes with different amounts of everything I came up with a better recipe.  It kinda follows this recipe but instead of orange cake use white cake. instead of lemon juice use liquid margarita mix.  Don't use any water, instead use  1 1/8 cup tequila and 1 1/8 cup triplesec. It might seem like a lot of liquid but its not and believe me I really worked at this recipe. When it comes to the frosting just start pouring things in and see how you like it.

I made this cake for my mah jongg group and our husbands.  We had a Spanish theme dinner.  I substituted orange juice for the water and used a sugar free fat free instant vanilla pudding.  It was DELICIOUS!  Everyone had 2 slices.

I have never found an 18.25 ounce cake mix, but the 15.25 works just fine.  Neither have I ever found an orange cake mix, so I have been using white.  I also find that sugar free instant vanilla pudding is excellent in this recipe.  That being said, I've been making this recipe for over 12 years, and it is PHENOMENAL!!!

The first time I made this exactly according to the directions.  My glaze was thin and most of it ran off the cake and onto the serving plate.  It was still a huge hit, and we wiped the yummy glaze off the plate with our fingers.  The next time I made the glaze as directed, but as soon as the cake came out of the oven, I poked holes in it with a meat fork and poured the glaze over the top.  I continued to let the cake cool in the pan for about a half hour, then inverted it onto the serving plate.  After completely cooled, I dust the top with powdered sugar for an extra nice presentation. I've made it this way numerous times, and people at work always ask for the margarita cake whenever we have a potluck.  I have never had a problem with the cake coming out of the pan, although as it is cooling, I occasionally jiggle the pan to ensure the cake stays loose. I have a good heavy Bundt pan, which I grease generously with Crisco, and dust with flour.  Hope this helps, although this cake really needs no additional improvement!

I wish I could give this recipe more than a 5-star rating!  This cake was a big hit at a mexican themed dinner party.  As suggested by other reviewers, I used white cake mix (rather than orange)and lime juice (rather than lemon) and I doubled the amount of glaze and added extra tequila to the glaze.  Some reviewers thought that the glaze was too thin - I found that the thin glaze absorbed into the warm cake much better than a thick glaze would have.  When I took the warm cake out of the pan, I turned it out onto a rack and put the rack on top of a sided cookie sheet...this allowed me to spoon excess glaze back onto the cake - I didn't want a single drop of that yummy glaze to go to waste!  I will definitely be making this cake again soon.

This is to die for!!!! so very yummy and moist. The glaze is delicious, I made it a bit thicker and kept re-pouring it over the cake. At serving time I sifted confectioner's sugar (since the glaze was invisible) over the top and sprinkled with finely grated lime peel. Very lovely presentation and my husband, the teens and my 7year old devoured it! Thank you Carol, this will be a frequent flyer for me!!

Good grief, will all the different reviews, I had no idea what to do!  I stuck with the original recipe.  It was good, but as others said, it wasn't all that margarita-ish.  I would use 1/4 *lime* juice instead of lemon juice (lime is in a margarita, not lemon!), and add more liquor and lime to the glaze.  Thanks for the recipe!  I'll definitely try it again.

I used the Jose Cuervo mini margaritas everywhere it called for separate margarita ingredients...I also followed many of the other reviewer's advice and used yellow cake mix, replaced the oil with applesauce, and made 2 seperate batches of the icing with one of them only using half of the liquid ingredients.  When the cake came out of the oven, I poke holes in it and drizzled half of the thin batch of icing on it.  I let it cool for about 10 minutes, then turned it onto a plate and poured the other half of the icing on...I waited about a half hour before drizzling the thicker icing on.  SOOOO GOOD!! Doesn't taste too "alcohol-y" or sweet, believe it or not.

Excellent and easy! I used a white cake mix, lemon pudding mix, lime juice for lemon juice, and Cointreau for the Triple Sec (I think it's pretty much the same thing?) I baked it in a glass 9x13 pan at 325 degrees for 45 minutes.
I wanted to decorate it so instead of using the glaze, I used a prepared vanilla frosting and just threw some tequila and contreau in the icing. It was easy to work with and turned out great. I think it's my new favorite cake! Thank you for the recipe

This was delicious and very easy.  I followed suggestions and used bottled margarita mix (w tequila in it) I also doubled the amout of glaze and poured it over warm cake (still in pan)with holes poked in it so glaze could be absorbed. Everyone loved this!

Incredibly delicious! Super moist.  I got rave reviews and requests for the recipe!  I used the orange cake mix which I believe to be unnecessary if you cannot find it--(had to actually order it online).  I did take the advice of some past reviewers:  I poured one shot of tequila, 2 Tbs. Grand Marnier and 2 Tbs lime juice over the cake as soon as it came out of the oven.  I let that sit a bit.  I inverted the cake 10 minutes later and poured the glaze over it.  I made a second batch of the glaze but added more powdered sugar to thicken it up since it is a very runny glaze.  Since I juiced my own limes, (which I used instead of orange juice) I mixed the lime zest with some regular sugar and made a pretty sprinkle for the top.  It added a little color and actually made the cake look like a salted margarita glass!   This cake recipe will always be in my recipe box!

Made this for a Mexican themed party and it went over amazingly! Took advice from others, used lemon cake and only lime juice. It stayed super moist! Didn't have other liquor so I just used tequila and thought it was perfect (but we're big tequila people). the icing tasted just like a margarita and the cake was a hit! thanks!

Great, easy, though I made some changes.  Here is what I did:  1 box of yellow cake mix, 1 sm pack of vanilla pudding, 1/2c applesauce (replaced oil), 1/4c margarita mix, 1/4c tequila, 2T each of Triple Sec and Lime juice.  Mix and cook per cake mix instructions (350 for ~40 min).  Here is the big improvement -- the glaze is 1c regular sugar, 1/4c butter, 1/4c margarita mix, 1/2c tequila, splash of water, boiled for 5 min and then slowly drizzled over the cake once it is cool.  Prick the entire top of the cake with a toothpick and over an hour add spoonfuls of the glaze.  Slow is key for it to saturate the cake -- YUM!  I dusted it with powdered sugar to pretty it up since the glaze is clear.

This was great!!  I followed others' suggestions - used a white cake mix, changed the lemon juice to lime juice, and added lime zest.  The guests - margarita fans, all - raved about the cake, and especially the glaze.  I doubled it (it WAS the best part, after all), and used really good liqueurs in it - Grand Marnier, top notch tequilla.  FANTASTIC!

I've followed the advice of others and use OJ instead of water and lemon pudding instead of vanilla.  Everyone always likes it.  It tastes more like an orange Dreamcicle to me than a margarita, but the tequila is a nice balance to the sweetness of the cake.

This recipe also makes 24 cupcakes - just reduce the baking time to about 20 minutes and check with a toothpick until it comes out clean.

This is a great cake, however in the past I have always used lemon cake mix as I was unable to find orange.  I made it with orange this time and it is not as good.  I'll stick to the lemon which  makes this one of the best cakes EVER!

This cake was fantastic!  Took it to a fajita/margarita party and it was a huge hit! I used a golden vanilla cake mix, orange flavored tequila and margarita mix in place of lemon juice. Also made two batches of the glaze. One as directed and poured half on the cake in the pan when it came out of the oven and the other half over the top after the 10 minutes while it was on the cooling rack. Second batch of glaze I used more confectionary sugar, less liquid and lime zest so that it would be thick enough to drizzle over the top and not absorb.  Refrigerated the cake for about 2 hours.  Can't say enough good things about this cake!

I am giving this a 4 star rating because I changed the recipe so much. I used Lemon cake mix and Lemon pudding. I took this to a Cinco De Mayo event and I must say this was a huge hit. Thanks so much for the recipe. I will diffinetly be making again and again.

Rave reviews, took this cake to a themed party and there wasn't a single bite or crumb left behind.  I used a tube pan in place of the bundt pan.  I also mixed the liquid ingredients for glaze and slowly added it to the confectioners sugar to desired consistency as all the liquid was not needed.

This is outstanding. I will keep this one. I doubled the glaze. I kept using what had run off until the cake absorbed it all. I took this to a BBQ and everyone wanted the recipe. I served it with sweetend whipping cream. I also used white cake mix and subsituted lime juice for lemon juice, the last thing was that I added lime zest..All I have to say is OLE :)

This recipe is awesome.  I changed the cake mix to lemon.  Put the lime juice in the cake and the lemon juice in the glaze. Then doubled the sugar in the glaze to thicken it up some.  Yum!

I was so hopeful for this cake.  I wanted to make it for a party so I made one the day before and the the cake deflated in the pan.  The flavor was okay.  Thinking it was just a fluke, I made another cake the next day and again it deflated.  I have never had this happen to me and I have made MANY bundt cakes, my favorite being the Irish Cream on this site.  Maybe there is too much liquid in this recipe?

If I could give this cake more than 5 Stars, I would! I made it for a Co-Workers Birthday and she ate 3 pieces, everybody else had 2! I used White cake mix like others had suggested. I also used the juice of 2 limes in the mix, and 1 in the glaze. You do need lots more Powdered sugar in the glaze than it calls for too. VERY MOIST!

Absolutely devine...rich, moist and delicioulsy flavorful.  I used the lemon cake mix as well as lemon pudding. I pierced the cake top with a large fork while still warm and drizzled part of the glaze on top.  When the cake was completely cool I thickened the remaining glaze and drizzled the cake with all the remianing glaze.  Lip smacking good.

Everyone loved it.  When I put the glaze on the cake when it was warmed, it was all absorbed so when the cake was completely cooled, I added a second glaze on top.  The caked ended up being very moist!  Will definitely make it again.

I followed a lot of the suggestions by other reviewers such as using lemon cake mix, substituting lime juice and thickening the glaze. I went one step further with the tequila to add some zing: I drizzled tequila on the bottom of the cake before removing it from the pan and then drizzled more on the top after turning it out of the pan. The first time I took it to work, I had 15 people ask me for the recipe!

Great recipe!  I don't like orange or lemon cake mix (also thought it wouldn't taste like a traditional margarita), so I used a white cake mix, and added 2 teaspoons of orange extract, then followed the remaining instructions. I took some to work, gave some to the neighbors, and my husband and I ate the rest. Everyone wanted the recipe!  I am making it again this weekend for a Cinco de Mayo party, but will use lime juice in the cake this time, as others have suggested.  Thanks, Carol, for a great recipe!

One of my guests said that it "just melts in your mouth."  It turned out great!  I followed the other's suggestions and switched to yellow cake and lime juice.  I also added a little lime zest.  The guys went back for seconds - may need two cakes next time ... it disappeared in minutes!

I enjoyed this recipe.  I made it for a Mexican themed dinner club and a teacher's appreciation luncheon.  I found the glaze to be a little strong so I reduced the amount of tequila by half.  I also recommend pouring on the glaze over a wire cooling rack and reapplying until all glaze is used.  This keeps the cake from absorbing all of the glaze on the bottom of the cake and making it too strong.  I also added green food coloring to simulate "lime margarita" and it turned out really pretty.  I garnished and served this with sliced starwberries, sugared limes wheels and a dollop of whipped cream.

I was in two minds how to rate this cake was it 3* or 4*.  I decided to rate on the positive side.  I used A Duncan Hines Orange cake and the only change I made was to use apple sauce in place of the vegetable oil.  I just can't see how this can be referred to as a Margarita cake.  I did not read the other reviews until after, I think you would have to use a lemon cake and lemon Pudding mix and use lime juice in place of the lemon juice to get more of a Margarita taste.  Nothing about this cake as written tastes like Margarita, the cake itself is orange in colour and actually does taste quite good.  If anything I think it tastes like the Spanish Saville Oranges but not Margarita!

This is a great recipe!  I made a few changes after reading others reviews.  I used white cake and lime juice in place of lemon.  Also, I doubled the glaze and applied it in 2 batches.  First, after poking holes in the cake while still warm in the pan, I spooned one full batch of the glaze and let it soak in for 15 minutes.  Then removed the cake from pan and let cool completely.  Next I made another full batch of glaze, but this time thicker and spooned over cool cake.  After tasting the cake, I think I will skip the 2nd batch of thicker glaze, it made it too sweet.  This is a very versatile recipe, almost any combination of alcohol can be used.

this is one of the best cakes I have ever tasted. Everybody that tastes it asks for the recipe.  I did change it just a little, I used a strawberry cake mix in place of the orange.  I frosted it with cool whip and put halves of strawberries all around the bottem.  I put clear sugar crystals around the edge of the top (to look like margarita salt) and put strawberry halves with a twist of limein between them around the top.  Besides being very tasty, it was very pretty!!!!

I used lemon cake mix instead of orange, and substituted fresh lime juice for the lemon juice. As soon as the cake came out of the oven (still hot and in the pan) I poked a few holes in it with a wooden skewer and poured a shot of tequila over the cake. I added more confectioners sugar to the glaze to make it thicker, and waited until it was almost cool to glaze it, so it was more of a glaze on top instead of soaking into the cake. I took it to a cinco de mayo party and everyone loved it!

I made two batches as cupcakes for a Cinco de Mayo Parrothead party. I used yellow cake mix (not lemon), regular vanilla instant pudding & lime juice instead of lemon. I added a small box of regular lime jello for flavor/color (half box per batch). It made about 6 dozen cupcakes total (filled 1/2way). I doubled the glaze recipe (twice) & added a dash of the jello mix. I poked holes in the tops & glazed them twice, letting it sink in.  Then I added 1 cup more powdered sugar to remaining glaze & iced them. I tried to rim cakes with glaze & sprinkle on margarita salt, but it seemed too much. I'll try adding a Tbsp of salt to glaze next time. People were a bit leary of these at first, but once a few tried them, they dove into them.  There was so much glaze inside, the texture was almost like bread pudding. The thicker glaze on top hardened & kept all the moisture in. Will definately make again! Since I made them as cupcakes & had added the jell-o, I called them Margarita Jell-o Shot cakes.

I have made this cake at least 10 times. It is a hit with the family and friends. I have never found Orange Cake mix so I substitiuted it with Lemon Cake mix and did not add Lemon Juice.

I couldn't find orange cake mix, so I used a lemon and it came out just fine!  It was a hit at the office this morning, Tequila for breakfast - and the boss wanted the recipe!

I used a reviewer's idea , Cookin in D-town, doubled the glaze and added shots to it when it came out of the oven.     Please note: I made this cake 5 hours before I served it and no one could eat it because it was way to strong. Lesson learned: If you make it the same day, don't add shots after it comes out of the oven! The next day, the cake tasted fabulous!  I used a white cake mix and added fresh lemon juice like the recipe calls for; I feel the lemon juice complimented all the lime favors. I only use fresh squeezed juice, never the bottled kind. The flavor is night & day. :)

Delicious with these changes: White cake mix, lemon pudding, lime instead of lemon juice, and double the glaze.  For the moistest cake, poke holes in hot cake and pour 1/3 glaze over it while still in the pan, then wait 10 minutes, turn out cake, poke & glaze with another third (a pastry brush was helpful), then add more sugar to remaining glaze to thicken it and drizzle that over cooled cake.

Replaced orange cake with lemon, lemon pudding for vanilla, and anywhere it said lemon juice used lime and came out with a wonderfully moist, delicious cake. Definitely a keeper!

Delicious! Couldn't find orange cake mix so I used lemon and was it delicious! Instead of tequila, I used margarita mix with alcohol in addition to the triple sec. Made it for dessert after margarita ribs! Will make again and again.

I just made this cake tonight - w/ the alteration of an orange cake from SCRATCH w/ just the added tequila, triple sec & lime juice.  I also added lime zest to it & Oh My Gosh -- this cake was phenomenal!  it was so moist & fluffy - i couldn't wait to show it off and brag on myself so i ran a warm slice across town to my mother after my husband & i got into it.  AMAZING cake & the glaze was incredible, too.  i thought it would be too tart, but on the cake it compliments it so well.

Very yummy and easy to make. Most of the glaze leaked onto the plate, however. I got much better results when I made a thicker glaze and poured it onto the cake after it had cooled.

I've made this recipe several times for parties that I have attended. No leftovers either time. I always use lemon cake mix since I'm not a huge fan of anything orange flavored. Also, I use Cointreau instead of triple sec as that is how I like my margaritas... :)  Overall, great recipe!

This wasn't bad, but not very margarita-y. I used another member's review to make this recipe better: Use white cake mix and vanilla pudding. Use lime juice instead of lemon juice. Use 2 1/4 Cups pre-made margarita (not the mix, the actual pour-and-serve kind). I also used applesauce instead of the oil, but that's inconsequential to the results. I made these as mini-bundts and they were delicious. For the glaze, I used 2 tablespoon lime juice, 4 tablespoons margarita, and 1 1/2 cup powdered sugar. I also added about 1 teaspoon of light corn syrup to thicken it a little. I glazed the cooled bundts, but it soaked right into the cake anyway. This made for a super moist and very flavorful bundt. The margarita flavor is all there, but with none of the alcohol after-taste!

Very good, with some changes.  Used white cake mix and lime juice instead of lemon juice, and also added the zest of two limes to the cake mix.  It was delicious, and almost everyone asked for seconds after a very filling meal.

OMG I LOVE this CAKE!!! My family can't get enough of it either! I have been requested to make it over & over again! I do substitute limes for lemons in the recipe, gives it a more "margarita" taste! LOL. I also add EXTRA alcohol when I make it for me & my close friends! LOL.

I used a silicon bundt pan for the first time -- didn't know to vary the cooking time/temp -- and ended up burning it!  Then I wised up and made cupcakes out of it, and they were FABULOUS!!  Everybody loved them!

Is anyone old enough to remember the Harvey Wallbanger cake from the 70's? It would seem you could take this recipe and adapt it to mimic any cocktail!

I made this cake for a summer picnic with a dessert contest.  It was going to be VERY hot so I figured I would make a light and refreshing dessert which is exactly what this was.  The cake was so moist and delicious.  It had a different taste than anything I've tried before.  The citrus flavor is so light and refreshing!  It is just outstanding.  I WON 2nd PLACE with this cake!  THANK YOU!

Delicious, moist, light cake. Perfect for summer get togethers. I used yellow cake mix and lime juice, like many other reviewers had suggested. Be sure to get as much glaze as possible on the cake, don't miss a drop. I frosted mine on a cooling rack over a rimmed baking sheet so I could keep spooning the run-off back on top. Yummy!

This recipe was superb.  I wouldn't substitute lemon or yellow cake for the orange. I did substitute lime juice for the lemon juice and I think the secret to the glaze I found was to pour it on when it is still warm but not completely cooled!  My co-workers raved over it!!

I bake this cake often.  Everyone at work requests me to bring it to potluck lunches.  I have passed this recipe along to many co-workers and friends.  I do make one change to the recipe.  I use pineapple upsidedown cake mix instead of orange.  The reason I started doing this is becuase I live in a small town and the local grocery store does not carry orange cake mix.  It also gives it extra flavor because with the triple sec you get the orange taste too!

It was an excellent lemon/lime cake, but I wouldn't say it was a margarita.  I guess you would have to souse the cake in liquor to achieve that effect.  Seems to be a waste of !expensive! liquor that you can't even taste in the cake.  Save your money, and replace the liquor with regular juices.

Very good and moist.  I followed the other users advice and used lemon cake and lime juice instead.  I held back a little on the tequila just in case it was too much, but it was perfect.  Rave reviews from my entire family.

I followed the original recipe the first time and found it too orangey, not really margarita-like.  I used yellow cake mix the second time and loved it.  I also made the icing thicker.  The cake got rave reviews each time though.  Love that it is such an easy recipe!

This recipe is fantastic!!!  I have used it twice now and it was a hit both times.  I used lemon cake mix and used about 1 1/2 cup confectionary sugar for the glaze.  I put the cake on a plate and the extra glaze was absorbed by the cake and made it much better.

Awesome cake for my office Cinco de Mayo potluck!  I couldn't find the orange cake mix but substituted with orange jell-o and orange extract.  I made the icing a little thicker than suggested.  Super easy cake to make and I will be making it again!

I did not care for this recipe. I did exactly as the recipe directed and when I took the cake out I checked it with toothpicks throughout to make sure it was done.  The whole cake collapsed within 15 minutes of taking it out. It called for WAY too much pudding...it was way too moist and not very cake-like. The taste of tequila was overwhelming and did not seem to go with the flavor of the cake.

Awesome. Unable to find th orange cake mix. So I used Lemon. Used lime juice insteda of lemon juice. Substituted OJ for 1/2 the tequilla and 1/2 the triple sec because I didn't want it to be too strong. But I don't think it was necessary. Glaze was thin but I think that adds to the cake...it seeps into it and is then a awsome moist delight! Easy too. My guests LOVED it.

I made this cake for my bartender friend for his birthday, it was fantastic and everyone loved the flavor. I doesn't taste too much like alcohol. I used lemon cake mix instead of orange, and poured the batter in a 9x13 aluminum pan. I wanted frosting instead of a glaze so I blended together 4 cups confectioner's sugar, 1 cup shortening, 2 tbs milk and the tequila, triple sec and lime juice from the glaze recipe. I continue to make this cake for my booze loving friends!!

This cake was superb! I used the recipe as it is except for doubling the glaze! We decided it could use triple glaze.  wonderul texture and flavor.  We enjoyed the first one warm.  will let the next one cool if we can take the smell.

It was good, I just got more citrus flavor out of it than margarita. I will try glazing when it's cool next time...and there will be a next time.

Great cake, also had to thicken up the frosting, which was fine as the first lot soaked in and made it more margarita like.

This is the first review I've done and glad to say this cake is a keeper! It was a big hit at a Mexican theme pot luck I took it too! I did double up the glaze and added an extra shot of tequila and 1/4 of the glaze to the top of the cake while in the pan before turning it out on the rack to cool. I also used a white cake with lime juice instead of lemon. I'll be making this one again!

This was the best.  I'd been waiting for 2 months to have an ocassion to make it!  I couldn't find an orange cake mix so I added 1 TBSP orange extract to a yellow cake mix.  [Also, I tried the margarita salt on half, but didn't care for it on the cake.]  Everyone raved about it.

Awesome cake for a fiesta night!!  I altered the recipe a little to make it with more umph.  I used Cuervo for the cake and Grand Marnier where it calls for Triple Sec.  Then poked the holes and put a shot of Patron Silver over the cake fresh out of the oven.  I put 1/2 of the glaze on it after the shot (I used 1800 silver for the glaze).  Let it cool for 15 minutes and flipped it on a serving tray.  I then put the rest of the glaze of the first batch on the cake.  Then I made a second batch with half of the liquid it called for.  It made it nice and not too thick.  Lay it on and ENJOY!

I liked this cake, but think I'll try it with the lemon cake next time.  I thickened the glaze quite a bit as well and poured some over the bottom of the warm cake as suggested.

This recipe ROCKS! It kinda made me feel like Sandra Lee - using mixes - but hey...it was amazing! I noticed in the reviews that not many people could find an orange cake mix, and neither could I, so I substituted a lemon one. I added some lime zest on top and it was good to go. It was a huge hit! I've made it twice and loved it both times.

Fabulous recipe!  I didn't have tequila, so just used the small can of Bacardi margarita mix(in the freezer section)instead of water, and orange juice because I couldn't find orange cake mix.  The cake is so moist and absolutely delicious.  A hit.

This is a great summer dessert.  I originally made it for Cinco De Mayo and have used it for two cookouts this summer.  I used Margarita Mix in place of all the liqours because it's all I had on hand.  For the reviewers who stated it didn't taste like a margarita try it this way!  It had the perfect zing of a margarita without being too much.  I've also used an orange cake mix everytime.

This cake was wonderful.  I needed something special for a Cinco de Mayo celebration at work (we sold nachos and desserts to raise money for March of Dimes).  This margarita cake fit perfectly.  I'm not the "measuring type", so I put my own spin on it and poked holes in cake after baking and pour prepared lime jello over top and refrigerated it.  Also didn't have triple sec in the house, but a "readytodrink" margarita mix did the job, too.  The lime jello really made the cake "pretty" when cut.  Everyone raved over it!

Nice, citrusy flavor.  My only substitution was to use Grand Marinier instead of Triple Sec--like they often do in "premium" margaritas.  I like cakes a bit denser than this, but for a light, summer cake this will do nicely.

My mom made this while she was here visiting a few weeks ago.  After reading the reviews she used the Lemon Cake and substitued the orange juice for the lemon and lime juices.  We served it at my housewarming party and it was a HUGE hit.  People were asking for 2nds, 3rds, 4ths.  My boss can't stop talking about it - weeks later.  He's requested I make it for an off-site meeting we are having tomorrow.  Definately a keeper.

I am a cook for a Hospice unit in AZ and I made this for Cinco De Mayo, what a hit!  The house smelled wonderful and all the visitors asked what I was making.  I followed the recipe exactly but did not use the glaze, just dusted with powdered sugar.  I brought a piece home for my Mom and she made it a couple of days later, with the glaze.  This is a wonderful dessert that will be made again.  Thanks for sharing.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out to be wonderful.  My friends and I decided that the orange cake overpowered the other flavors - and that if I had used regular white cake, the margarita flavors would have stood out more.  Delicious the way it was, but I will try using white cake next time.

This cake was amazing!  Will definitely be making this again!    If you cannot find the orange cake, pineapple cake mix works great!

Took this cake to a Breadbreakers gathering. It was a huge hit. The orange coloring is also perfect for this time of year (fall).

Very good.  I couldn't find the orange cake mix, so I used lemon.  It tasted very lemony to me, but everyone at our Cinco De Mayo party loved it!

This was so yummy!  Didn't much taste like a margarita, but it was still awesome and was a hit at my party.  I had no trouble finding an orange cakemix...duncan hines makes an orange creamcicle dessert cake.  For the icing I substituted milk and orange extract for the liquor so all could enjoy the cake.

This was a disappointment.  I used lemon cake mix b/c I couldnât find orange and used OJ instead of water.  The final product was a â¦lemon cake.  No hint of margarita in it.  Howeverâ¦it was a very moist and tasty lemon cake.  But for all of the extra ingredients, I was hoping for moreâ¦.

I also used a lemon cake mix because I couldn't find orange. I used only 2 tbsp. lemon juice and then 1/4 cup triple sec to get more of the orange flavor. I live at high altitude, so I added 1 tbsp flour but otherwise made no changes. I found that I had more batter than would fit in my pan, probably because of the extra rise at 5200 ft.

This was a great recipe, will make again - I had Mexican night at home, decorated the room, made Quesadilla's and Spanish rice,  with classic Margarita's to drink.  We then watched Desperado and Once upon a time in Mexico, and noshed on the cake -- it was awesome!! My substitution was by mistake, but cake came out perfect, used Vanilla (prepared pudding)-- the 4 pack for a little over a dollar, I used one of those,instead of the dry mix, I also added orange zest to my glaze.  I will make this again.

Wow! This cake was great, although I did make some modifications.  First, I used yellow cake mix.  Secondly, I substituted orange juice for the water, as one reviewer had suggested.  I didn't use any lemon juice at all; just lime.  For the glaze, I did it as suggested, but that all sank into the cake, so then I made the glaze again, but this time with cream cheese, to make it thicker, like frosting.  Everyone at work raved about this cake; they said it was delicious!

Wow! What a keeper. I could only find lemon, but that didn't matter. I also had to use cointreau, but the taste was still orangey. I made the icing thicker and topped with lime peel. Then I wet the rim of a cake stand and dipped it in margarita salt. It was great. Yum, Yum. Byt the way, it did taste like a margarita.

I would have given this a five, but I think that a lemon supreme cake mix would have been better for that margarita flavor.  I also used the instant lemon pudding, as some other reviewers reccommended.  This was still excellent though, and I would highly reccommend it!

After reading everyone else's modifications I too decided to try the recipe with a yellow cake and lime juice instead of lemon.  It was amazing.  I had this for desert for my annual cinco de mayo party.  I got tired of making flan every year so I decided to try something different.  Everyone loved this cake so much that it was gone in 10mins.  Can't wait to make it again.

Man, what can I say about this recipe!!!  I needed something different for a Mexican themed party, so I made this cake.  I didn't think that anyone was going to eat it, but everyone had at least one piece, and everyone asked me for the recipe, even those who never cook!  I didn't have any left for myself for later! I followed the advice of the others and made it with lemon cake mix and lime juice.  I also doubled the glaze.  It looked a little plain when I made it, but I decorated it with lime slices and gummy worms.  I couldn't speak any higher for this cake.  Definately try it.  I'm glad I did!!!

I have made this cake for several occasions and it has been a hit every time.  Very easy and a real crowd-pleaser.  Make sure you put the glaze on while the cake is warm, so that it soaks in.  The glaze is tart and wonderful, so you want it in the cake and not on the plate!

Very unique and yummy cake!  I made this for my husband's birthday and had requests for the recipe.  I made it as a sheet cake instead of a bundt, and took the advice of others about using lemon cake mix and lime juice.  The only thing I didn't really like was the glaze, but that might very well just be a personal preference.  (I wish I could give this 4.5 stars, because this is a very minor complaint.)  The cake itself was very moist and flavorful, but I think next time I might make a more traditional cake frosting with the margarita flavors mixed in.  Oh - and a gummy worm garnish on each slice is a must!!

I didn't have a bundt cake pan so I used an angel food cake pan and it turned out great.  I used the lemon cake mix as others suggested as well as used only lime juice rather than the lemon, and added a little extra powdered sugar for the glaze and kept scooping the glaze that ran off back onto the cake until it was gone.  Overall, this was very easy to make and tasted very moist and lemony.  I could not taste the tequila or triple sec in the recipe, but still love the taste.  I think next time I will try making it with white cake mix, and substitute the tequila and triple sec with kahlua and amaretto.

This cake was pretty good.  I wish I had read the reviews again before I made this cake because as previously stated, the glaze really does need to be thickened. I could tell it was too thin and kept trying to add more powdered sugar, but I didn't want to overpower the other glaze ingredients, like the TEQUILA!  I may try adding in a little cream cheese to the glaze next time.  Overall a nice, moist cake.

I made this cake while my in-laws were visiting and they were so impressed! I bought the margarita mix that had the tequila already added.  I put a little extra of it in and it was wonderful! This was also good the next morning for a nice "tart and sweet" breakfast.

This is not a fancy looking cake--but the flavor and moist texture is nice.  I followed the suggestions of commentors and used lemon cake mix and lime juice too.  Next time I might add a few cocktail umbrellas once it's done as garnish to give it more margarita-like mojo. :)

This cake disappeared in a day.  It had a great citrusy taste, the frosting being the most flavorful.  Not as margarit-ee as I had hoped but still an excellent recipe and one I will use again. Very easy and worth a try.

I couldn't find orange mix anywhere, so I just used the lemon. I've made it three times and has been a hit everytime. Just think it looks a little plain. would like to serve it on a festive plate and like one reviewer said, add gummie worms for decoration.

I made this cake last night for a few friends.  I, too substituted the lemon cake mix for the orange.  I also substituted lime juice for the lemon juice (since I bought the lemon cake mix).  Everyone loved it.  It was very tasty and I would highly recommend it.  I will DEFINATELY be making this one again!!!

Made this for my daughter's birthday - she LOVES margaritas.  I will say I had my reservations about it.  Being an unconventional cake, I was worried the 10 or so people that were over wouldn't care for it.  Seeing all the 5-star reviews gave me the push I needed to go ahead and make it and holy moly am I glad I did!  I took into account a couple of changes I read about:
*I did use white cake as I couldn't find orange cake mix
*fresh lime juice in lieu of lemon juice
*I poked holes in the cake before unmolding it
*Doubled the glaze and poured some over the bottom to seep into the holes
*3 layers of glaze once unmolded and cooled on a rack
*after the third layer I sprinkled fresh lime zest over the top
I thought seriously about doing just a tiny sprinkle of salt as suggested but I chickened out.  Next time I will try that and it will be soon as I had people already asking me to make this cake for one event or another.

Thank you, Carol, for a fabulous recipe!

I made this cake for a combo cinco de mayo-kentucky derby party.  I was nervous bringing something that I had never made or tasted before but, based on all of the positive reviews, I decided to take a chance.  Well, it was delicious.  Like others, I made the following changes:
1.  I didn't want to risk a flat cake so I bought 2 cake mixes to make sure I had the full 18.25 oz.  (Cake mixes are now 15.25 oz)  Bought a Duncan Hines Yellow cake mix and a cheap Walmart yellow cake mix to steal the extra 3 oz. I needed from.
2. Substituted yellow cake mix for orange.
3. Substituted margarita mix (non-alcoholic) for the water.
4. Substituted lime juice for lemon juice.
5. Substituted Grand Mariner for triple sec for both the cake and the glaze.

The cake baked up nice and full (filled the bundt pan - no flat cake!)  Once out of the oven, I poked holes in it using the end of a wooden spoon and poured some glaze over it.  About 10/15 min after that, I removed the cake from the pan onto a cooling rack.  I placed a plate under the cooling rack to catch  the glaze drippings...so I could put it back on the cake (don't want to waste a drop!)  The glaze is thin so I made an extra batch and tried to thicken it by adding an extra cup of confectioners' sugar.  It didn't come out as thick as I had hoped but it was an improvement (couldn't get it to look thick and white like the picture).  Once the cake had cooled for an hour, I poured more glaze over the cake.

The cake was delicious.

I make it a point to always read the reviews before I try a recipe because sometimes there are helpful hints listed. But these are out of control. Almost every single person talks about how they changed the ingredients before actually trying it as is. I made it exactly as it stated, only switching the lemon juice with lime juice since we'll, its a margarita cake. Turned out great! I will definitely make it again.  Super moist and super easy. My first bundt cake and it came out of the pan beautifully. I greased it down with Crisco and voila!  I also didn't have any problems with the glaze like some people stated. Poke holes in the bottom and pour a little bit of glaze when it first comes out of the oven and then drizzle the rest once it has cooled for a while. Garnished with lime zest.

So disappointing. was looking for this type of flavor profile, but a real cake, not a box mix! May as well serve twinkies.

I made this Margarita Cake for my sisters 50th and decorated it with the Mercado Margarita Mix logo. This is a great, moist, lemony, delicious recipe that I highly recommend. She was quite impressed and I had fun making it.

So good!!  I also could not find orange cake mix, so I used yellow cake and used orange juice instead of water.  I did not make any other changes to the cake and it came out perfect...fluffy and moist.  I'm at high altitude, so maybe the 15.25 oz cake mix wasn't an issue.  I did 1.5x the glaze and I think it was just right.  The glaze is pretty "boozy" the first day, but after the first day it's much more mellow.  But, it's still delicious the first day.  Everyone who has tried it has loved it!

LOVE this bundt cake - and so easy to make!!  absolutely cannot find orange cake in our area, so i used vanilla cake mix + orange blossom liquid from williams-sonoma (1tsp) + orange zest from 2 large oranges - gives cake orange-fleck look, too.  i added 8oz pkg of sour cream for a more dense, moist cake.  icing is thin but remember, this is a 'glaze' not frosting like the gooey kind you see on birthday bundt cakes.  use more powdered sugar, as others have suggested, and poke chopstick holes on the top of the cake to let the glaze ooze through the cake.  top with sliced strawberries (fill the bundt hole, too) and lime zest for a pretty red-white-green mexican margarita cake!  enjoy!

Very good and flavorful. I did not have triple sec and used schnapps instead and it worked just as well. The glaze was a bit thin and soaked right into the cake but it was still super tasty!

very good.  I added orange extract and used lemon cake and lemon pudding. Used contreux and skipped tequila. Really good. Next time I might grease and flour, or cool longer than 10 min and part of my cake stuck in my greased nonstick bundt pan.

This cake was wonderful. I did use top shelf liqour and changed the lemon juice to lime for a better margarita flavor. I made it for my husbands work party and all I brought home was an empty container... it was a huge hit! Thanks for a great recipe.

Great flavor!  I got a lot of compliments on the sweetness of this cake when I brought it to a family cookout. I was a little disappointed when I couldn't taste any of the tequila though. I  subbed 2/3 c. orange juice for the water for extra flavor. Next time, I'll increase the tequila from 1/4 to 1/2 cup.  I added 1/2 c. chopped pecans to the batter, and it was delicious!  I may cut the amount of conf. sugar in the glaze the next time I make this cake.  It was a little too sweet for me.  I'll definitely be making this cake again!

Modified the recipie by using a mini-bundt pan (baked at 350 for 12 minutes) then dipped the mini-cakes in the glaze.  Also used lemon cake instead of orange (although I might try the orange next time -- these are very lemony), doubled the powdered sugar in the glaze and very lightly sprinkled kosher salt on the cakes while they were still wet.  They're a tremendous hit in the office today.  I was looking for a "finger food" dessert for a mexican-themed pool party that was a step above a cookie but not as cumbersome as a sliced cake would be.  This will work brilliantly!

Nice recipe.  Although I'm not sure how a margarita tastes, I would have enjoyed more lime flavor in the cake.  Used a confetti cake mix for the multi-color effect and followed the changes many gave such as using all lime juice & lemon pudding.  Only used 1/2 of the Grand Marnier (or Triple Sec).  Added about 1/3 cup sour cream to make it heavier.  Glazed it hot (poked holes in cake) right out of oven.  I made sure I loosened cake so I could get it out of pan.  Even so, I think the sugary glaze made it stick to the pan so next day I had to use a spatula to ease it out of pan.  (I do like the idea of using a "second glaze" - maybe making a double recipe - first time right out of oven and next time after it cools.) Refrigerated it overnight in pan with glaze on it.  Next day took cake out and turned it over. I made a cream cheese lime frosting with conf. sugar, juice of one lime, 1/2 pkg of cream cheese and a little cream.  Spooned it over the top.  Helped my sweet tooth and desire for lime flavor.  Not a big fan of boxed cakes, but this came out nicely.  4 1/2 stars.

I made this for a Memorial Day party and there was not a slice left. I did make a few changes though. I couldn't find orange cake...i used white cake and lemon pudding mix, and lime juice instead of lemon, for a more "margarita-y" taste. Delicious!

This cake is tasty and easy to make. It does not, however, taste like a margarita. I haven't a clue how to make it taste that way. I used lime juice for the lemon juice, maybe I'd try adding more lime juice in place of the water, if I was inclined to make it again. I doubled the sugar in the glaze hoping to get a thick, white glaze, but it did soak into the cake and go clear on me anyway, which I did not like. So I'd add more confectioner's sugar next time, and probably omit the triple sec from the glaze so that I could keep the ratio of sour:sweet nice and even while still adding a boatload more sugar. I'd also use lemon flavored pudding next time to ramp up the cake flavoring. It's a tasty cake, but more citrus flavor is better, when you're talking margarita. P.S. I used green food coloring and the specified orange cake mix, and got a nice avocado green colored cake. Thanks for the recipe, everyone enjoyed it!

I made 30 cupcakes instead of a bundt cake.  I used white cake mix and 1/3 c Margarita mix (non-alcoholic) and 1/3 c water.  I also used lime juice in the cake batter instead of lemon juice.  When they came out I poked holes in each one and spread ~1/4 teaspoon of tequila over each one, then spread a little bit of the glaze.  I added more powdered sugar to the glaze to thicken it, and added a few layers to each cupcake until it was white.  They have quite a tequila/lime kick to them, so next time I might not use Margarita mix as a sub to water.  All in all very good though!

The first time I made this, I couldn't find the orange cake mix, so I used lemon instead, and it was amazing! I saw Orange Delight cake mix today in the store, so I am going to make it using that mix for a friends birthday. Should be amazing!!

This cake was a hit! I couldn't find orange cake mix at my local grocer, so I substituted yellow cake mix, orange zest, and a 1/2 tsp of orange extract. Also, I substituted Grand Marnier in place of the triple sec. Topped it with lime zest and lime slices. YUM!!

I used the lemon cake mix as everyone seemed to suggest, and I also used orange juice instead of water. The cake still just tasted like lemon cake. The glaze was far too runny and tasted like slightly margarita flavored powdered sugar. Made it to take to a dinner party, and now I need to make something else instead because it didn't turn out well at all.

I recently made this cake for an office b-day and it was a huge hit. I had to use lemon cake mix also as I couldn't find the orange however, I added an extra 1/2 tsp of triple sec (as it is orange flavored) to try and cut down the "lemony cake taste" and it did help.  Very easy to make and already giving out the recipe to everyone!

This was a hit at this years Cinco de Mayo party. I did change the recipe a bit and added pineapple tequila instead of plain. Also orange juice instead of water. YUM YUM!

Made this cake twice and it turned out well both times! I added some lemon rinds to the glaze just for an added effect.

This cake was a great hit at a Fiesta Party I went to.  I made 2 cakes, one with the liqueur and one without.  When I made this cake I used Margarita Wine coolers instead of water for one cake and the 2nd cake I used the wine coolers instead of ALL liquids even to make the glaze.

I made this cake for tailgating at the Jimmy Buffett concert and it was a big hit. I followed other reviewers' advice and used lemon cake mix and lemon pudding mix and I also added the grated zest on one lime to the cake batter. It was delicious!

The outcome of this cake was different from what I expected.  I used lemon cake instead of orange and followed suggestion from other reviewers. The glaze was really good.

This was a very good cake, but it didn't taste like margaritas!  As another reviewer suggested, I bought mini margaritas for the alcohol.  I also used that with the powdered sugar for the glaze.  Once in a while you'd get the taste of the margarita in the glaze, but that was it.  Other than that it was a very moist lemon type cake... good, but not really as advertised, IMO.

WOW. This cake is delicious. I used lemon cake instead of orange. The first glaze was thin and didn't really make the cake look frosted. I did poke holes in the cake when I poured the glaze. I double glazed the cake like other reviewers but only a cup of powdered sugar and a juice of one lime and it was thick enough. Made this cake for a work party and it was a hit. Some folks poured a tequila shot on the cake and some took a shot then had a bite of cake. This is my new party cake!

Subbed lemon cake for the orange, used grand marnier instead of triple sec, poked holes after the cake was done and poured more tequila on it (about 1/8 of a cup).  For the glaze, used more sugar to make it thicker, added grand mariner instead of the triple sec and added lime zest for taste and color.  FAB recipe!

I used the Lemon cake mix instead of the orange as other reviews suggested... But this tasted like a pound cake... my suggestion would be USE MORE LIQUOR! It was really good, but, like I said, it was a moist pound cake and not the margarita flavor I was hoping for.  I will make this again and at least double or triple the liquor - esp. in the frosting. We'll have a good time when I make this cake next ;)

I thought it was delicious and moist and good! It did not remind me of a margarita though: too orangey. I did not win my block party dessert contest (of only 4 entries) and it was not all eaten by the end of the party. I gave my 2 1/2 year old daughter a bite and she didn't like it. I made the recipe as written, except I used lime juice instead of lemon, and I found the glaze to be way too runny so I doubled the amount of confectioners' sugar.

this was good cake, no doubt.  Moist, sweet--definitely got completely consumed at the last dinner party i attended.  My only disappointment...where's the margarita flavor?  The citrus is good, but I want more boozy-ness.

This cake recipe is amazing. I made one last night and it's gone already. My husband LOVED IT! I couldn't find any orange cake mix so I threw in some grand mariner & some margarita mix in there to add to the flavor. I will definitely be making this again.

substituted the orange cake mix [hard to find] with yellow cake mix and added orange extract.

I would have given this only one star, but I thought maybe the modifications that I did affected the taste.  I couldn't find orange cake mix, so I used white cake mix and vanilla pudding, substituted orange juice for the water and lime juice for the lemon juice.  I also doubled the glaze - all of these modifications based on reading the reviews.  Bottom line, when the cake was done the tequila flavor was WAY too strong.  (And I like to drink Margarita's).  I won't be making this one again.  Sorry Carol!

This is a very good cake, i made 5 for a party and it was a hit. i was very lucky to find orange cake mix too! I did how ever modify the recipe a little, on 2 cakes i substituted triple sec with Madori, and for the glaze i used Madori. It turned out awesome!

I couldn't find orange cake mix so I used lemon.  I used more lime juice than lemon so the cake wouldn't be too lemony.  I followed the directions exactly for the glaze but it was way too thin and either absorbed into the cake or ran right off it.  It didn't look anything like the picture.  Some of my friends like it but I was very dissappointed.  I had to spend too much money on alcohol for this cake.  I was really disappointed and probably won't make it again.

A friend made this cake for a party we were having..it was great, so I search it down and have made it myself. A+..I would say the only draw back is having to buy the liquor, but I'm sure I'll find some use for it:)

I thought the glaze needed salt - what is a margarita without salt?  I'm glad I did.  I think I added a little more than a 1/4 tsp of salt to the doubled glaze recipe.  I also put lime zest in the glaze, which added nice green limey flecks to the presentation. I had the girls over for dinner, and it was a big hit.  Good recipe.  Someone else mentioned they were planning to try the recipe with other cake flavors/liqueur combinations.  I'm thinking chocolate cake & baileys for the next attempt.

Excellent!!  I had to make a few minor modifications:  I couldn't find an orange cake mix, so I used lemon cake mix.  And in the glaze, I used lemon juice instead of lime juice, since I didn't have any lime juice. My guests loved it.  It was the perfect ending to a night of grilling and margaritas.

Oh my gosh, what a different cake!  I made it for my inlaws (who aren't drinkers). It's funny! They never even knew there was alcohol in it...I sure didn't tell them. haha!  Hubby LOVED this cake. He and I both agree it needed extra glaze to be perfect. It was so moist! I used lemon cake like many other reviewers suggested.  I also used top shelf tequila (Jose Cuervo).  Absolutely delicious! But I don't know if I'd serve it to nondrinkers again...especially if we double the glaze next time!:-)

Recipe was great - however I made the following changes - lemon cake mix, lemon pudding, lime juice in the cake - I changed the frosting to have more tequila and less triple sec (I used Cointreaux - will try Grand Marnier next time) - I poked toothpicks into the cake to let the icing soak in really picked up more of the icing that way and decorated with candied lime slices found at the mall candy store. Went over great at a tequila party.

I have tried this twice...I'm not sure what I am doing wrong since everyone else raves about it.  I am a pretty experienced baker, but this cake is not what I expected at all.  I tried it first using white cake mix and adding lime juice to get the "margarita" taste. The second time I followed the recipe exactly.  Each was a disappointment.  Both seemed way too tart; my husband's co-workers didn't even finish the leftovers and those guys eat everything... I was really looking forward to this recipe so I may give it one last try. If anyone has suggestions, please post. thanks.

I made this for the Fourth and it was a hit with everyone!  I followed others suggestions and used a lemon cake mix and lime juice instead of lemon juice in the cake.  After taking the cake out of the over I drizzled tequila on the bottom of the cake before removing from the pan.  Delicious!

I doubled the glaze, used the lemon cake mix (although it was very lemony...too bad they don't make "lime cake mix"), and lime juice.  It was very moist and delicious!

I also had a hard time finding an Orange cake mix, so I used Lemon and did the Orange juice substitution.  I have to agree with the "plain" factor as far as looks were concerned, so I added gummy worms...it's a "Margarita" recipe, worms worked!!  Over all it was very popular and well received.  I'm baking it again for a tennis potluck fiesta.

Took this to a party - to say people loved it would be understating the matter!  When I went to move the remaining pieces to the hostess' plate so I could bring my plate home with me.  The other guests panicked (thinking I meant to take the cake also) and threw their bodies in front of the cake screaming "NO!" so I couldn't take it. (maybe I put too much booze in the cake!) Nummy recipe! Thanks!

I made this cake this afternoon.  It was so simple & is absolutely delicious.  We're having company in a few weeks so I wanted to make for my husband & myself first to see how it would turn out.  I know our company will love it!  The glaze is fabulous!!!!!!!!!

This was a popular dessert at our latest potluck! Watch the baking time--the top of mine was a bit dark (may be due to my pan, though).  Prefer a thicker glaze, but that's a minor adjustment.

I made it for a Cinco de Mayo party and most people liked it but it turned out too lemony. I used the lemon cake mix. We couldn't really taste the tequila in this recipe. I would probably use more tequila next time. It really just tasted like a lemon cake. The glaze was pretty good and overall the cake turned out very moist even the next day. It was okay but great.

I had to try this cake for "Cinco de Mayo".  Sure glad I did.  It was wonderful!  Very moist, and everyone loved it...and wanted the recipe.  This is one cake I will make over and over. I couldn't find an orange cake mix, so I used a yellow cake mix and substituted orange juice for the water. Turned out great!!

Delicious! I didnât have orange cake mix, so I just used yellow and substituted orange juice for the water. My glaze came out much thinner... so I just poured it on and then topped the cake with some 10X to make it look pretty.
    Iâve also made it with rum instead of tequila. This cake has been a big hit with my family and friends!

Very good cake, was a hit at a get together I had. I did make a few small adjustments, as recommended by other reviewers- used a lemon cake mix, and lime juice instead of lemon. Also, zested some lime into the batter as well. I would like to try with an orange cake mix  though, as I feel that would be equally as good!

I only gave this cake four stars because I made some changes to the original recipe after reading some of the reviews. With the changes made I think it's a five star cake. Everyone loved it, even those that don't like margarita's. Will definitely make it again. 
I used yellow cake mix and topped it up to the required 18.25oz with orange cake mix. Using just a few ounces of orange cake mix gave it just a hint of orange flavour but a bit of an odd colour. Next  time I'll use white cake mix and top up with orange. I substituted the oil with apple sauce and used lime juice instead of lemon juice. I also dusted my bundt pan with sieved orange cake mix.
The glaze is very good and after reading the reviews I made two batches of it. The first batch I made exactly as in the original recipe. I poured half of the batch over the cake when it was hot from the oven and still in the pan. The other half I poured over the cake when it had cooled down just enough for me to turn it out of the pan onto a rack. The second batch I made a little thicker by adding more sugar. Half of this I brushed on to the cake once it had completely cooled down. I thickened the remaining half even more (by adding more sugar) and added a drop or so of green food colouring. This  half I drizzled on top of the cake. 
I made this for our 4th of July celebration and everybody loved it, but unfortunately I was so busy I forgot to take a picture of it!

I follow the recipe except as suggested by others "Before flipping over on to cake pan use a skewer to poke holes and drizzle about 1 Tsp ea of lime juice and triple sec"  I also add fresh fruit making it especially good.

If I could give this cake more starts I would.  Rates right up there with the favorites now.  I made it for a Bunko function.  It was a huge hit.  So moist and so good.



Notes:  
I actually made this twice, the first time I went to allrecipes.com and they had a couple suggestions.
One of them was when the cake 1st comes out of the oven, poke it with a fork all over and pour 1/2 of the icing into cake.  After 10 min.  Flip cake onto platter and use the other 1/2 (after poking fork holes and while cake is still warm).

I actually doubled the icing.  (The first batch I split for the top/bottom while warm).  The 2nd batch I modified so it was a bit thicker and poured over the top after the cake had cooler; prior to serving.

For the 2nd batch, I only used 1 T. of the Tequilla and Triple sec and the 2T of the lime juice.  The icing is thinner than normal but it basically gets soaked into the cake.   If you would like it thicker, add more powdered sugar.

I also grated lime all over the top.  This cake was so moist.  Enjoy!!!

This cake was incredibly moist and delicious.  I used canola oil rather than vegetable oil as I didn't have any. I garnished the cake and plate with lemon wedges and drizzled the glaze on those as well.  Those limes were delcious in birthday cake shots afterwards! :)

This cake was wonderful! Definitely worth digging out the bundt pan that has been in that deep dark corner of your cabinets. After reading about 40 reviews, I settled on the following tweaks; Lemon cake mix instead of orange, lime juice instead of lemon, about 2 Tablespoons of lime zest in the mix and definitely double the glaze as this is like candy. One VERY IMPORTANT note is that this recipe is for 18.25 oz of cake mix and the boxes now only come in 15.75 oz sizes so I bought 2 boxes of cake mix and used a kitchen scale to weigh out the dry cake mix and it came out perfect - otherwise I would anticipate that it would be too wet if the liquids were not scaled down.  This got printed and shared already!

After reading the reviews, i used a lemon cake mix, oj for the water and lime juice instead of lemon.   Also used the margarita minis.  Made it for a birthday cake and will definitely make it again.  Tastes like summer , nice and light.  It was a huge hit.  You need to try it...yum

I love this cake. The first time I made it I couldn't find the orange cake mix so I used lemon. The second time I made it I did use the orange cake mix. I liked the lemon cake mix version much better--it had a better flavor and was prettier. I didn't care for the orange color produced by the orange cake mix.

I made this for a bunch of foodies at work :) and everyone raved about it and stated they were going to be making it also. My only change would be to use lime juice instead of lemon in the actual batter. However, the recipe as written  is wonderful. Very moist.

The cake tasted great. I made some common substitutions: lemon cake mix, lemon pudding, lime juice and margarita mix. The lemon flavor over powered any hint of margarita flavor, but it was a great citrus-y summery cake.

Very disappointed after reading all the rave reviews.  I needed a recipe for a Cinco de Mayo potluck and thought this would be perfect.  I made it with the lemon cake mix and doubled the glaze. The glaze had a nice flavor but was too thin to make much of an impact on the overall flavor of the lemon cake.  It was definitely not a hit at the party- less than half was eaten. If you decide to make it, double the glaze, and add more powdered sugar to make the glaze thicker.

Followed the basic recipe but I added green food coloring to the orange cake and grated key lime peel.  When the cake came out of the oven I poked holes in the top and added icing with grated key lime peel to the icing and made it a little thinner so it would soak into the cake.  Once the cake cooled I made another batch of icing and added key lime peel to it and made it thicker and iced the cake. Then sprinkled margarita salt on top of the cake.  My husband and I LOVED the cake it was hard not to eat the entire cake at one sitting!  Will be making this cake a lot.

This is by far the best bundt cake ever. My family goes nuts over it.
I like to poke small holes on top and drizzle more booze on top.

I make this cake all the time; I'm actually in the process of doing nine of them for an event this weekend.  Since I can't always find orange cake mix, I tend to substitute the water with orange juice, and use white cake mix as the base.  

There are times I'll use a lemon icing or glaze instead of the glaze above, depending on people's alcohol tolerances.

I wanted to make mini cupcakes with this recipe and it went super good. I did change the lemon to lime juice and added extra tequila. For the frosting, I folded the glaze in the frosting but added double the quantity of tequila and triple sec. It was finger licking good!!! thanks

Everyone LOVED the cake. I too could not find orange cake mix so used lemon with lime juice instead of the lemon. I forgot too that others said to use less liquid for the icing it was way too runny need to adjust this the next time. Still looking for the orange cake mix so that I can make it the right way.

This cake is excellent! I made it last year for Cinco de Mayo and it was a big hit. I was requested to make it again this year for a going away party. The only deviation I made from this cake was to bake it as a sheet cake. Highly recommend!

This cake was awesome.  I brought it to a Margarita Party with me.  I used orange cake mix, vanilla pudding, silver tequilla, grand maraner, and all lime juice (no lemon).  I glazed once while hot and twice after the cake cooled.  Then dusted it with confectioners sugar.  Yum!

I made this cake for a Mexican themed work party and it was gone in an hour. Everyone that had some said they loved it! I used a white cake mix, lime juice instead of lemon, and poured tequila and triple sec over the cake before putting on the glaze (recommendations I found in another review).

This was a hit at my Mexican themed party. I had to substitute lemon for orange cake mix but other than that stuck to the recipe until I got to the glaze... I felt it was too bland and needed some extra lime and lemon juice for that margarita kick. I also used about 1.5 the amount of glaze. I did not get the white glaze look shown in some of the pictures - so opted to dust my cake with powdered sugar and use thin lime quarters along the top to decorate. The finished product was amazingly moist!

I used white cake mix, fresh squeezed OJ instead of water, and.... because I thought I had vanilla pudding mix but didn't, I used what I had - jello chocolate caramel chip.  I made three batches of the glaze using only 2tbs of sugar and poured half of it into the bottom of the unremoved cake right after it came out of the oven, then the rest over the top after turning it over.  It all soaked in quickly.  Then another batch according to the directions over the top once it was cooler and that all soaked in too.  Too late, out of time, no pretty glaze on top.  Took it to a dinner party fearing the worst and everyone said it was AMAZING.  Most didn't guess any alcohol at all, those that did didn't guess tequila.  The chocolate combined the other flavors so that no one thing stood out, even the lime.  So it didn't taste like a margarita but it was very tasty, smooth but complex if you tasted more closely, and very moist.  I am almost afraid to make it with the vanilla pudding as written for fear I won't like it as much!

this is a keeper! I did as suggested by others & used lemon cake mix & pre-made margarita in place of the water, lemon/lime juice, tequila & triple sec in both the cake & glaze. I really soaked the cake in the thin glaze.

Very yummy.  Like other reviews, I used lime juice instead of lemon juice, used 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil, used orange juice in place of water.  I used grand marnier in place of triple sec.  I made cupcakes and when then came out of the oven, I poked holes in the tops and poured a little tequila on top. I had to add more powdered sugar to the glaze to thicken it up and added lime zest to that.  Overall great recipes and my husband who is a margarita fan, loved them.  thanks.

This is always a hit!  My friend and always use strawberry cake mix.  One time she could not find an orange mix, tried the strawberry, and we decided we like it better.

I just made this last night, but I made cupcakes instead.  Couldn't find orange or lemon cake mix, so I used white cake mix and lemon pudding mix, and used lime juice in place of lemon.  I also used Friday's "pre-made" traditional marg mix (with tequila already included) in place of the tequila/triple sec.  Finally, I subbed melted margarine for the veg oil.   I got 22 big, fluffy cupcakes out of the recipe, and I baked them for only 22-24 mins.  I topped with a bit of sea salt for some balance, and everyone is raving about them!  Seriously, what a perfect Cinco De Mayo treat to bring in to the office!!!   The icing is a little thin for what you expect on cupcakes, but it's so delicious that no one is complaining ;)

I made this for my best friend's birthday, and she loved it! I followed other reviewer's suggestions and also made some changes of my own. I couldn't find orange cake mix, so I used yellow and a pakage of lemon pudding mix. I also substituted lime juice for the lemon juice in the cake and margarita mix for the water. I added slightly more tequila to the batter and I also poured a shot of tequila and a half a shot of triple sec over the cake after it came out of the oven. It was so dense and moist. YUM!!!!

Loved this recipe!!!  I made it for a work - Mexican potluck; so I took the advice of other reviews and used Frozen Bacardi Margarita mix.  I doubled the Frosting recipe so I could have more and I added lots more of the margarita mix to it.  So it definitely tasted like a Margarita.  It was a hit.  Didn't bring any home.

This was a big hit at work today... I thought it tasted more like an orange Push-Up than a margarita though.  The outside got a little dark, so I think the next round I will turn the oven down to 325 and cook a bit longer- this may be due to my oven though since it is 20+ years old!

I made this in 2007 as the recipe calls for (exept I used strawberry cake mix b/c thats what I had) and it turned out plesantly good.  The adults thought it was a very nice cake and the kids were wishing they were adults to try it.    I made this again in 2009 and I followed some of the advices in the review poll (more of this,  more of that if you know what I mean).   I would recommend the recipe to be followed as is.  Maybe you can change the cake mix flavoring and adjust the icing to taste- I did double amount of icing both times, one for when the cake was still warm and the last before serving.  PLease give this cake a try as is first.  Ah! and don't use margarita mix!!! The second time it tasted somehow odd.

No orange cake mix so I used Lemon. I used an already prepared Margarita mix.  Turned out great.  I even tried it with Strawberry Margarita mix.  Next time I think I'll try it with a regular yellow cake mix.

This cake turned out very moist and tasty.  I used white cake, although next time I might try it with the orange if I can find it.  Also, I used lime juice in place of the lemon juice.  I baked in a tube pan for 50 minutes.  I ended adding more powdered sugar to get the glaze a little thicker.  After the cake had cooled a bit, I placed it on a plate and poured the glaze over the top so the glaze could seep into the cake.

a girl @ work made this cake for cinco de mayo..... delicious.. as most reviewers she used lemon cake due to lack of orange cake... wonderful. she baked in a 9x13 pan so the glaze worked perfectly. She made it again using lemon cake and lemon pudding with thicker glaze said it was even better !! Some non drinker co-workers said they would make with limeade but i would rather have leftover tequila and triple sec than mess with a great recipe!!!!!

I used the Duncan Hines Pineapple Cake mix & Grand Marinier instead of Triple Sec.  I agree - the glaze is a bit thin, but the cake is delicious.  I prefer the pineapple cake instead of the orange.

Yummy cake!  The first time I made it according to the recipe and it was perfect.  The second time I tried adding more liquor to cake and icing but it tasted too strong.

I made this cake for a Mexican Theme dinner and it was perfect.  The recipe was easy to follow. I also used more confectionary sugar to the glaze because it was too thin..

It was good - we could really taste the alcohol.  I used a yellow cake mix and substituted OJ for the water.  I also used fresh lime juice.

This was my first attempt at a cake and I turned out really well. However, I was a little disappointed that the cake did not turn out more like a Margarita. I knew that the orange cake would make a nice base, but it overpowered the lime. Maybe next time I will make a using a lime cake mix.

Very easy to make.  I used regular cake mix and added a little extra lemon juice. Also while making the frosting definitely have to taste to get correct flavor that you are looking for. All in all made this for a cinco de mayo party and everyone loved it.

Since my Dad retired, he's became the baker in the family.  When I read this recipe a few weeks ago, I knew he had to bake this for me.  This cake got more compliments on any other cake he's baked.  It was so moist and flavorful. I think we've got Dad talked in to entering this cake in the Kentucky State Fair in August.

i thought this was a good, moist cake. didn't taste like a margarita imho, then again, i made a few changes to the recipe so i can't really fault it for that. had to use lemon cake, only had enough lime juice fo the glaze, etc. if you want the glaze to be more visible, let the cake cool longer. i did and you could see it fine. it still ran, but that could be because i poked holes and poured glaze in both the top and bottom, without doubling the recipe. the reason for three stars is i don't know if i'd make it again, which could be hormonal as i'm pregnant and the taste of tequila did not sit well with me.

This cake is a HIT! I've made it several times and it's always all gone. I've used pineapple cake mix also when my store didn't have the orange cake mix and that was VERY good. YUM!

while it is hard to find the orange cake mix, substituting the more readily available strawberry is good too.  Publix carries orange cake mix... recipe itself is great, and a big hit at our office party.

This was very good. I made it with yellow cake mix, vanilla pudding and lime juice. The cake was moist and bland tasting, but the glaze was fabulous. It truly tastes like a margarita. I recommend a double dose of the glaze or perhaps some extra on the side that people can pour on each slice.

Refreshing summer dessert.  I left out the liquor and added lemon and lime zest to both the cake and icing.  It received rave reviews at my party.

Four stars for a moist cake, but one star for the "margarita" portion of the recipe.  I was disappointed.  Between the orange  cake mix and triple sec, the orange flavor was almost too strong. I had to thicken the glaze quite a bit. Good for what it was, but not what I was looking for.

I had a couple's wedding shower- mexican theme and thought this would be the perfect cake to top it off and it was. Everyone loved it! It was very moist all the way through and just enough tequila in the glaze to give it the little extra zing! We decorated it with limes and little maracas. This was great!

I also couldn't find the orange cake mix so I used lemon and I used lime juice instead of lemon.  I made it in a sunflower cake pan so it would look a little nicer since I heard complaints about presentation.  I poked holes in the cake to absorb the glaze and it turned out real moist but honestly it just tasted like a moist lemon cake, nothing like a margarita.

Cake was very good, I did use the lemon cake because I could not find an orage one. Also my frosting did not turn out like the picture. Still tasted great and was great to do something different.

This cake is fabulous!  I made this for a fiesta party and it was a huge success!  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great!  I would definitley recommend using an orange cake mix (Betty Crocker makes an orange supreme cake).  Thanks for a great recipe!

Wow!  I took all the suggestions and this cake was way to lemony!  I would not reccomend using a Lemon cake and lime juice.  I wish I had made it according to the recipe, but i do not want to spend the money on making it again when it was not what I expected.

Everyone at our Mexican Night Supper Club was crazy about this cake.  It was a little hard to find the orange cake mix- I ended up buying a Duncan Hines cake kit with syrup and icing mix just to get the orange cake mix.  Otherwise, very easy.  A real winner.

Excellent recipe - the cake was a hit at our Cinco de Mayo lunch at work.  I added a confectioner's sugar/vanilla glaze two hours before serving.

This did not have a strong liquor taste at all. I even read the reviews and added more tequila and triple sec and I used name brand liquors. I used lemon instant pudding and even soaked the cake before icing. It was a great lemon cake, but it was a waste to buy the liquor. It made it very expensive and added nothing more. It was very pretty.

This was good. Very moist. It really did remind me of a margarita.

I thought it was a very easy recipe to make.  A little expensive to get going, but has a crisp, not too sweet taste.  Refeshing!

I thought it was great with the orange cake mix... was a big hit in my Spanish class.  I thought the bright orange color made it a unique fun cake that everyone enjoyed.  I'll be making it again!!

This is the first time I have ever made a bundt cake and the effort was worth it.
Even though I am not a huge fan of Margaritas, I enjoyed the cake and it only
got better with age.

Yummy! I've made this for two different events - it was easy, moist and looks as great as it tastes.  It can be made a day or two ahead and covered with no problem. It has more of an orange dreamsicle flavor than a traditional margarita, though.  Anyway, it's a keeper!

Used the tips offered by other reviewers ... went with a lemon cake mix, used fresh lime juice instead of lemon. 

It's a great cake: light but incredibly moist. I may have glazed the cake a bit too soon, however ... most of it soaked in/ran to the bottom of the plate (then again, I also increased the glaze recipe by a half). Next time I'll wait just a little longer. to glaze.

My husband, who isn't a bit citrus fan, had two helpings!

Good cake, very moist. However, it did not taste anything like a "margarita" more like just an orange cake.

I also made this for a mexican theme dinner....Everyone thought it was good, very moist and a nice "light" taste after a filling meal.  My husband is the only one who thought it needed more glaze. I didn't have a problem finding an orange cake mix, so I followed the recipe exactly.  It looked a little "boring" though, so I sprinkled powdered sugar on the serving plate and put some fake yellow flowers in the center to dress it up.  Very easy & quick.  Good, but not absolutely amazing- Good enough to keep for any future mexican nights though.

What a great recipe!  It smells so good when making it.  I also had to use a lemon cake mix (couldn't find orange) but I added half lime juice & half lemon juice to add more of a "margarita" flavor.  It turned out great and was super simple!  Definitely a keeper!

Made this Margarita Cake for a Mexican Dinner which was attended by 8 people.  Everyone couldn't stop exclaming how moist and delicious this cake was.  They all asked me for the recipe to boot!  Excellent!

My family preferred this cake over rum cake. 
I doubled the glaze recipe.
