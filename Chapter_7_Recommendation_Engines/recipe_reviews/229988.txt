Added a few steps - chicken-fried the steak (had better luck with the coating) put in a 9x13 baking pan, added the peppers, tomatoes and onion, covered and baked at 350 for approximately one hour.  Tender!

I made this tonight for the first time in many years.  It's the exact same recipe I used to make from a cookbook that  was a wedding gift--40 years ago!  I rarely fry things (to mess up the stove) but it was worth the effort.  My husband went back for seconds! Since my Swiss steak was 2 1/2 pounds, I used a 15 ounce can of petite diced tomatoes and a little extra water with a dissolved bouillon cube.  I did put it in a 9x13 dish after browning (so I could go ahead and clean the kitchen) and baked covered with foil. Frozen chopped bell peppers worked fine. I will not wait so long to make this again. Very yummy and tender, was good served with rice.

I had never made Swiss steak and came upon this recipe, now i make it at least once a month for myself and my husband and we love it. I never do anything different, except I use chicken stock in place of water. Also, I sometimes use tenderizer on an inexpensive cut of beef, but as long as the beef is pounded out and cooked for the time stated, it really isn't necessary, it is nice and tender. We eat ours with steamed jasmine rice, yummy! Thanks for this great recipe.

I did this in the crockpot for about 5 1/2 hrs.  I tasted at the end and definitely thought it need more sauce and seasoning...so I added in about a cup more water, a bouillon cube and some garlic powder...also added a flour water slurry to thicken it up a bit.  Served it over egg noodles, topped with some chopped fresh parsley, and it was devoured!

My grandma use to make something like this and never got the recipe (really wasn't one), then i found this recipe it was sooo much like hers, so gave it a shot!!! After a few minor changes it was just like hers!!!!! I used olive oil instead of shortening and a bit more then it called for, I put the flour and salt, pepper & meat in Ziploc bag, then shook it off as I added to the oil browned the meat threw in veggies and canned diced tomatoes 14 oz. Instead of 8 a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce and a cup or so of tomato juice and salt and pepper and let'r simmer for about 2 hrs.

This was great!  I also baked it and added about a cup of beef broth and a tsp of Worcestershire sauce.   Will definitely make again.

Thought I would try this and I'm glad I did, we liked it served over egg noodles.  I did use home canned tomatoes and more of them than recipe states.  I also added a bit of celery.  I will make this again.

Pretty good basic recipe.  Could use some additional seasoning.  I added stewed tomatoes and fire roasted peppers and onion.  I seasoned the flour with smoked paprika.  I also braised the steak with beef broth.  The family loved it.

Excellent recipe! This is my first time making Swiss Steak. I was, admittedly apprehensive about it. After reading lots of reviews, I decided to brown the meat with vegetable shortening (more shortening is needed than called for in the recipe) after mixing different seasonings (I did not measure) in flour in a ziplock bag. If spicy taste is wanted, add cayenne pepper (we like spicy foods). Shake meat in seasoned flour to coat, add to oil. Add browned meat to 9X13 casserole dish and top with bell pepper, onions and celery. Cover with aluminum foil and bake at 350 degrees for approximately 1 1/2 or until meat is tender. I served with white buttered rice and mixed vegetables. DELICIOUS!

The only changes I made were to cut the recipe in half for my husband and me and to add seasoned diced tomatoes. Pretty easy and it has a nice flavor.

I made this tonight. It was really good. I did make a couple changes. I added a bottle of beer instead of water and used tomatoes with jalapeños. I also simmered it for a couple hours.

Great recipe! I placed in slow cooker after browning and added celery and mushrooms along with more tomatoes. Did add beef bouillon cubes also for more flavor with the water. Cooked for 5 1/2 hours on low. Meat was so tender! Will definitely make again. .so easy and delicious!

I have made this recipe several times. The first time as written, the next time I substituted boneless pork chops. Great flavor and my husband loves it. Will make again
