This is a terrific recipe! It takes a trip to the Asian market to get some of the ingredients, but the flavor they add are worth the trouble. I added chicken to the recipe and plan to make it again with shrimp. The quantities that I had to buy the Asian ingredients in will make the recipe at least two, maybe three, more times. All in all, it is a very economical meal. The amount of garlic looked like too much to me, so I just did 2 1/2 tbsp., but I'm sure it would have been fine with 4. The fresh ginger tastes so good in this recipe. Leftovers are just as good as fresh! I want to use this for company sometime, and have all the chopping done early and throw it together when they arrive. This is a definite keeper.

That previous review was not accurate. This recipe does not take long to cook, unless you plan to get in and out of the kitchen in 5 mins. Then you might consider heating up some frozen box thing. This recipe was quick to make, easy, and tasted great. I would enjoy more authetic Chinese cooking tips and ingredients.

First off, let me just say how nice it is to see a real recipe here and not “Aunt Thelma’s Mayo Cheese Cake Mix Biscuits”.  This recipe is GREAT.  This was my first successful foray into Chinese cooking at home, and mostly thanks to all of the in depth technique notes (keeping the wok very very hot, etc.), it came out beautifully.  I made a few substitutions: I swapped the dried bean curd out for hickory smoked tofu marinated in tamari, brown sugar, black pepper, and cayenne pepper.  I also added in the highly recommended preserved black beans, and they were amazing as promised.  Also, I did not have enough fresh ginger or garlic on hand, but the recipe came out okay with 3T of garlic and 2T of ginger.  All in all a great recipe, my boyfriend and I loved it, and there are PLENTY of leftovers!  I think that next time I make it, I'll want a little drizzle of sweet sauce (like a plum wine reduction or something) to set off the savory, lightly caramelized flavors.

Best set of stir-frying instructions I've ever seen. And great guidance on ingredients. We agreed that this is the most successful stir-fried dinner I've made. I added snow peas (instead of peas) and broccoli, putting them in first to cook. Fabulous!

I'm pre-rating this recipes, because it sounds so wonderful! I'm having trouble coming up with some of the ingredients.  Is Shredded Black fungus the same as Shredded black Mushroom?? Are dried bean curd sticks the same as bean threads?? Help! I'm desperately trying to make this!

Lemme guess-English major? :o) This tasted so yummy! I, unfortunately, have an electric stove but it still turned out fantastic. Who would have thought I'd ever like something with bean curd in it?! Thank you for the entertaining recipe directions and thank you for the delicious dinner!

I love this recipe!  It makes a ton of food, so I had plenty to much on for several days.  It reheated very well.  I've also had a lot of fun experimenting with the ingredients, depending on what I find in my grocery store.  I never leave out the ginger, though -- that really gives this dish a great kick.  I do wind up using every bowl in my kitchen whenever I make it, but that bit of mess is totally worth it for this great recipe.

This was really, really, REALLY good.  I made it for my boyfriend and myself, and we practically ate the whole six servings at once!  I have an electric stove, and my wok pan was a little small, but it still tasted good and BTW the directions for cooking the basmati made it come out PERFECT!  The instructions are wonderful and make this a very easy recipe to follow.  I found that you do use a lot of dishes but if you just make a small attempt at putting the dirty ones in the DW as you use them, the kitchen is pretty clean when you are done! And I am one messy cook...

Seriously the best fried rice I have ever made.  I added some leftover roast chicken from last night but otherwise just followed the recipe.  I loved this recipe and my husband had seconds.  Thanks so much for posting it.

I love to read recipes/books-yep I'm a little different! I have made many recipes from this sight and this is got to be the best written instructions and footnotes I have come across. This individual should write a cook book. Will be definitely making this in the near future, can't wait to visit Uwajimaya's in Seattle to find all the ingredients.

My husband and I were very excited to try this recipe, but felt it just wasn't the taste we were looking for.   Good, but not great.  The recipe and directions were very well written.  Thing only thing we changed was the peas, we substituted edamame instead.  Just not a keeper for us.

WOW. After reading the description of this recipe (and suffering from 1/2 the ailments listed) i decided this would be a nice treat for the me and family. I was right. It was a HUGE hit. I did use a little less ginger, and it turned out wonderfully. Thanks for the recipe- I'll be making this again!!!

Lovely! 
We're vegetarian (no eggs) so I made some "scrambled tofu" instead and added that.
About the bean curd sticks (also called yuba), dried mushrooms etc... We can buy them in the Asian food aisle of Walmart, of all places! But maybe only here in Hawaii...?

Fantastic recipe. I've made this six or seven times now, always use this recipe for reference then go from there. It's incredibly versatile. Your imagination, your personal taste, and your dietary restrictions are really the only limits to what you can do! But I highly recommend the preserved black beans, bean curd, black fungus, and dried mushrooms. Tamari is so superior to soy sauce I don't even buy the latter anymore. I get tamari at my grocery store, but those other ingredients I pick up at Pacific Ocean Marketplace. The good thing is they're all dried, so just use what you need and ziploc the rest and they'll keep pretty much indefinitely. Once you get comfortable with the whole I'm-eating-fungus-and-I-really-like-it thing, you might try adding other varieties of dried fungi and mushrooms to the dish. Oh, the bean curd I get at POM isn't in sticks, it's more like flattened balls of clay, if that makes any sense at all. The first time I looked for sticks forever so hopefully that saves someone some time.

The recipe footnotes alone are gold. The flavors reach umami-level. Definitely add a bit of chili paste and cashews, etc... for a exceptional meal.

This was very good fried rice. I added chicken thighs. It didn't taste quite like restaurant fried rice but it was still very good.

Just made this for the first time.
Used refrigerated short grain, worked great. Only have electric top, worked ok.
What's up with the bean curd? We halfed it and used 3 sticks, but it still was like... a lot. Maybe our asian market's sticks are bigger than your asian market's sticks (giggity). But seriously they're like 12" long per stick.

I could eat this every day for the rest of my life, and the description and recipe tips are great. Even though I have an electric stove and used an old heavy-bottomed steel pan, it turned out yummy with lots of great texture and color!
