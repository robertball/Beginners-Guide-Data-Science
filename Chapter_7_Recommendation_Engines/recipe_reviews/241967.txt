This is always a good standby dish. Easy to make and tastes great. Tonight I served with roasted potatoes and glazed carrots instead of the pasta.

My family loved it! I followed the recipe exactly as shown and it came out perfect. The chicken was crispy on the outside, tender & moist on the inside and perfectly seasoned. I've added this recipe to my favorites and will definitely make it again.

I made this exactly as written, except I only had two eggs, which was plenty for dipping the chicken. it came out very tender and moist. I used the leftover spaghetti sauce to mix into the noodles, which turned out great.

Made this for dinner tonight, OMG good very good on the top of the list to save.  I baked it at 375 for twenty minutes because I have a electric oven and it burns cheese easy.  But changed nothing else.  I did not make pasta to go with it cause the chicken was big enough that a salad, home made French bread, pineapple upside down cake ( we haven eat yet) was to much.

I used thin cut chicken breasts and baked for 20 minutes; dinner was served! Perfect flavor and a wonderful crunch. I served it over pasta with extra sauce.

Delicious and so easy!! I cooked my chicken a little longer (about 20 min) once the fresh mozz started to brown. Definitely adding this into our meal routine. Thank you for this easy and yummy recipe!

Excellent! I didn't have bread crumbs so I made my own. It turned out perfect! (I did forget to use Parmesan cheese, but it tasted good anyway.

This dish is amazing! This was my first time ever making chicken parm and it was perfect! The only detail I changed was using garlic bread crumbs instead of Italian.  I’ll definitely be making this a regular meal!

My husband and whole family gave this rave reviews.  I could've used a little less bread crumbs and cheese mixture than it says and it would've been less wasteful.  Even with 5 half breasts, it still only used about 3 large eggs.  Texture and flavor were awesome--restaurant quality.  We will definitely make this again!

We didn't think the chicken would be done in only 10 min in the oven - but it definitely was!  The only adjustments I made were I put the chicken on a baking rack in the cookie sheet and next time I would add a bit more salt.

Classic Chicken Parm!  This was a big hit with my family & I was glad I made a double batch. The only changes I made were to add slightly less salt to the flour (I used gluten free flour which worked great) and 1 tsp garlic powder (not salt). I also used seasoned (gluten free) breadcrumbs. The breading ratios were off, however. I made the recipe as-is (not doubled) and I had a bunch left over after using twice as much chicken. Otherwise, we loved this recipe.

Great recipe...I used the baked method.  I did season my chicken with garlic, salt, pepper & Italian seasoning.  Also did not have bread crumbs on hand.  Used leftover Garlic & Herb seasoned croutons crushed up.

Very easy to follow and it came out perfect!  I used 3 Perdue chicken breasts and placed them in the oven for 20 minutes ( I'm paranoid about chicken not being cooked throughly). I used hunts garlic and herb spaghetti sauce and poured the remaining sauce over pasta.

My husband and 5 year old twins LOVED it.  I tried the suggestion listed, to bake and not fry the chicken, and it was wonderful!  They asked me to make it again soon!

First time ever making a meal like this, baking chicken has always been a bit intimidating to me, but with this recipe not only was it SIMPLE, but it turned out PERFECTLY. Only changes I made to the recipe, is I used Gluten Free Noodles, GF breadcrumbs, add more salt and pepper to taste.

I made this for the family and it was a hit! I used homemade marinara instead of marinara from a jar and it was delicious. Fresh mozzarella is key as well!

Very simple to make. Our first time ever making Chicken Parm. Was not disappointed. Very juicy, and just the right amount of breading. 

Also we used Bertolli Marinara and Burgandy Wine for the sauce.  Worked Great!
