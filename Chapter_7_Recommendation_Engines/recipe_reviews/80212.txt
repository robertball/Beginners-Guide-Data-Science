It's not a bread machine recipe if I have to turn on the oven.  Dumped it all in the breadmaker on whole wheat, 1.5 lb loaf, light crust.  Added 1/4 cup water during kneading b/c the mix was too dry.  Final result was still a bit dry.  Texture about as expected for the flours (medium grainy).  I don't understand why this recipe used all purpose instead of bread flour.  Bread had a hint of sweetness, faint orange flavor, ginger undertones.  Overall I'd say it was too mildly spiced to be a specialty bread and too flavored to be an all purpose bread. I won't be making this again.

Yum, it doesn't have a coarse yeast-bread grain (at least I think of yeast-bread as coarse-grained).  It's more like a quick bread in that it's fine-grained and somewhat soft.  It's also nice that it only rises once.

I like this bread, but I don't love it.  I would make it again because I have not found many breakfast breads.   I think it would make good french toast.

I added approximately a Tbsp of finely chopped candied ginger and would add double that amount next time. I would also add a bit more cinnamon and powdered ginger.

I used this recipe as the basis for my adaptation of Christopsomo (Greek Christmas bread) to my bread machine. I added spices, raisins & nuts and VOILA! Christopsomo.
