Do not change a thing! These are perfect as written! They do make a lot though, so if you're not making them for a lot of people, and you have zero self control when it comes to such deliciousness (like I do), I'd advise you to cut the recipe in half. Thanks for sharing!

These are okay if you're needing a quick sugar fix, but I wouldn't serve them to guests or take them to a social function.  They are extremely sweet and not very attractive.  They might look better if the whole thing was cooled on a single cookie sheet (or 2 since it makes so much of it) and cut into squares like you normally would see fudge presented.

I cut the recipe in half and added 1/2 cup of natural pb. I actually set them in the fridge for 2 hours, and they were ready to go! I took them into work and people couldn't get enough! I had more people asking for this recipe than anything else I've baked and brought into the office.

These came out fine, but I had to let them sit overnight to set properly.  Even then, they came out softer that the typical no-bake oatmeal cookie - not that that's a bad thing, it just wasn't what I was expecting.  The mixture was pretty loose when I placed them on the waxed paper - as usual, I used my cookie scoop to get fairly round, same-sized cookies.  Flavor is excellent - fudgie, chocolatey and super sweet.  I would definitely make these again, but I think I'll try boiling the mixture a bit longer (4 to 5 minutes) to get a firmer, more fudge-like consistency.

I only had 1/4 cup of chocolate chips and a BIG craving for chocolate! This recipe was perfect! It works great even when cut in half 3 times!
Simple, Easy, Quick, Delightful!

these are soooo addicting!  I have to give some away to neighbors so I don't eat them all!  Left out the walnuts, didn't have any.  Have to keep them cold so they don't turn to mush, yummy!
