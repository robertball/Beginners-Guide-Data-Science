This made a wonderful addition to a Saturday morning pre-booze cruise brunch! Our liquor store doesn't carry pear liquor so I had to call an audible and subbed pineapple vodka. Served in a champagne flute these drunken berries were quite a hit for soon to be drunken guests. THANKS for the recipe angela!
