These turned out great! I served them with swiss cheese, grilled onions and mushrooms on top. I also added 1 teaspoon of Aleppo Pepper & 1 teaspoon seasoning salt. To help the patties stay together I used 1/2 cup of oatmeal and 1 egg.

Wow what a great recipe! I used our George Foreman grill for this and just cooked them for 6 minutes...no need to flip (I love that indoor grill!). I like the fact that I had all the ingredients on hand and DH loved the flavor. I saw on previous reviews some said that this reminded them of meatloaf??? Well, to us it didn't. This burger had good flavor and I'm glad we gave it a try! Thanks so much Jeff for posting...this will definately be a keeper in our house!

These were good but it reminded me of a meatball or meatloaf. I trated them like a normal burger cheese,ketchup, lettuce tomato and onion. I will try them again but I think I will either top them with mozzerella an roasted red peppers or tomato sauce and mozzerella .

Flavors were outstanding! Maybe the people who thought otherwise used dried minced onions? I used a fresh onion and minced it up. I made just over 6lbs and ran out of Worcestershire so I used Dale's Seasoning to round out the amt I needed. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. Also, it is key to handle the meat as little as possible. After I mixed everything together (using wooden spoons kind of folding it in) I put into the fridge. I'd made it the day prior to needing. The day of, I took a 3/4 measuring cup and scooped out some of the meat. The measuring cup was just slightly overfilled. Then I gently pressed together into a ball. I placed the ball on a hot griddle (about 450) for 30 seconds. Flattened with spatula. Let it cook for 2 minutes. Flipped it, and let it cook for 3 more minutes. It's the "smash burger" method I read about in my Food & Wine magazine. SO GOOD!!! The cooking method was great but the meat was just fantastic. I was afraid because I could smell the italian seasonings but when I was eating the burger patty (tried the night prior with just the meat & bread to really see if it was good) it just tasted like meaty goodness. Wouldn't change a thing. In fact, I'm totally gonna use this exact recipe & altered cooking method to make hamburger steaks. Make a nice onion mushroom brown gravy to go over these bad boys? Oh yeah, good eating. I could not be happier with this simple yet flavorful beef patty. THANK YOU!

These burgers were delicious!!! I used garlic powder (California blend)instead of fresh. I look forward to making these again and again!! They didn't taste like meatloaf to me like some of the reviews have mentioned! My whole family loved these, thanks for a great  recipe!

These burgers are delicious!  They do NOT taste anything like meatloaf.  I was a little leary of the italian seasoning, but it was perfect.  Didn't change a thing.  Great on toasted rolls!

We used ground round for these. As I always say, you need a little fat in a burger to make it juicy. Added a bit of tabasco sauce. Really good stuff, and we thank you, Jeff!

These were great. Moist and didn't fall apart! I did omit the extra salt for dietary reasons as W. sauce has so much, but otherwise followed as written. Everyone loved them! I believe mixing everything then refridgerating helps the flavor so much. Thanks for a keeper!

We thought the Italian seasoning was overpowering.  It was all we could taste and my husband was burping it up for hours.  Next time we will leave it out so we can taste the yummy onion and garlic!

Well, I am not a burger fan myself, but I made these for a BBQ this past weekend where all my guests raved about how fabulous the burgers were.  Everyone who had a burger couldn't stop talking about how flavorful they were.  I even had one friend email me later saying "I absolutely have to have the recipe for those delicious burgers".  Thanks for the recipe, it was a hit at my BBQ!

These were great and easy to make.  I ground some frozen sirloin that I had and substituted "Montreal Steak Spice" for the italian seasoning.  They are the closest thing to the elusive "world's greatest cheeseburger" that I am questing for .

These made some tasty burgers.  We made a few revisions.  Rather than old boring salt, we used seasoned salt.  We skipped out on the Italian seasoning and opted for several dashes of liquid smoke instead.  They were a big hit for the fourth of July this year.  We're planning on doing them again onc we get our grill.

We love this recipe!!! I use lean ground beef.. I follow the recipe as is... no need for binding ingredient like egg... now we have weekly yummy burgers... we do a burger buffet where we use this as the basic hamburger and we'd have an assortment of toppings like blue cheese, bacon, sauteed mushroom, caramelized onions, salsa, bbqsauce, etc... oh, and flame-grilling will bring you this recipe the best! Thanks so much!!

I made these over the summer and they were a HUGE hit!  Everyone at my 4th of July barbeque was raving about them.  Has to be the best burgers I've ever made.  Since I was making them in the summer, I also added fresh basil from the garden..  That was amazing too!

These were just ok. I think they are missing something. I topped the burgers with mozzarella cheese and roasted peppers. They did taste like a meatloaf or something of the sort. Won't make these again.

This was a pretty good recipe.  I thought the Italian Seasoning gave the burgers a little strong/overpowering taste.  I'll definitely make them again, but I'll cut the seasoning down to 1/2 tsp.

This earned high praise from my husband...I never make my "own" hamburgers because they just aren't "that" good... but not with this recipe.  I read the reviews and was a little concerned about the "meatloaf" comments... so I smelled all my ingredients, and whichever smelled like my meatloaf, I left out... like the Worcestershire sauce.  The Italian seasoning was fine... and instead of the salt & pepper, I added 2 TSP of seasoned salt to the mixture... that covered some of the salt that I lacked from leaving out the Worcestershire.  The flavor of the garlic and onions was very intense...perfect for me...and the kids... but could have been a little less for hubby (though this didn't slow him down!) I might cut down on the garlic a little the next time.... but I'm sure the moistness came from the onions... so those stay!  These were GREAT!

These burgers have so much flavor and are sooo... juicy!  Beats a restaurant burger any day.  The flavors blend better if refrigerated as called for, but, I've made them in a hurry without refrigerating and they turned out well, although, not quite as good.  My husband really loved this with bacon and cheddar cheese.

We love these!  I've made them as traditional burgers and I've also made this into a loosemeat recipe (brown the hamburger w/onion & garlic, add the other seasonings, add a cup or so of beef broth & simmer).  I've tried the recipe as written and also w/the steak seasoning instead of Italian seasoning.  Very nice mesh of flavors.  The raw patties freeze up great, so I always make extras for quick dinners.

I melted cheese on these and served them on toasted buns ~ everyone adds their own condiments. The Boy didn't like them as much as I did but he still gobbled 2 burgers. Thanks for the great recipe Jeff!

This is the only way I will ever make hamburgers or meatballs again.  I had leftover meat and made Italian meatsauce.  This is very good.  I let mine marinate overnight.

NOT BAD. I MIGHT TRY TO USE A LITTLE LESS GARLIC NEXT TIME. I DONT AGREE WITH A FEW OTHER REVIEWS ABOUT THE BURGERS TASTING LIKE MEATLOAF. IVE TRIED OTHER BURGERS RECIPES THAT ARE BETTER BUT THIS IS GOOD WHEN YOU WANT A LITTLE SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

I didn't make these on the grill but on my grill pan in the house and they turned out just great. This is a great go to burger, not too fancy and definitely not a bland piece of meat. I served these on Belles Hamburger Buns, also a recipe on this site and it was a great hit.

Since it was just two of us I cut the recipe in half with only 1 lb ground beef and half of ingredients. I didn't use the italian style seasoning and they were amazing. I will start using this as my burger recipe.

Good basic burger. I let mine sit in the fridge for the full 4 hours and it was very flavourful. I didn't measure the black pepper or Italian seasoning and since I was out of worcestershire sauce I subbed in some steak sauce. MMM, will definitely make this again. Topped with coleslaw and a side of fries. Great. Thanks for sharing.

"OK". Italian seasoning gave burgers a "strong" taste.  Might make again, but would reduce the amount of seasoning.  Came out a bit dry.  Probably won't make again.

Perhaps I shouldn't have added an egg but I did. I thought they would hold their shape a little better with an egg added but I was wrong. Sorry to change things up a little but I also deleted the italian seasoning which I didn't have on hand and I added 1/2 teaspoon of Wright's Hickory concentrated liquid smoke instead. Good flavour and worth taking a photo for submission!

Easy to make and very delicious!  The company commented on how good they were and asked what was in it.  Today when rating the recipe I realized that I even forgot to put the Italian seasonin in .. oops!  I'm sure that will only make this recipe better!  I did double the W. sauce though as others suggested and added 1/2 cup oatmeal and 1 egg to hold it together.

Very juicy burgers.  I added 1 tbs of montreal grill seasoning to the mix.  It was a lot of meat for just my small family so the next day I used the already prepared meat to make meatloaf.  It was THE BEST meatloaf ever!  I added 4 tbs of ketchup, 1 cup of uncooked oatmeat, a pinch of salt and one egg.  I made a ketchup sauce with 1/2 cup of ketchup 1/3 cup of brown sugar 1/4 cup of lemon juice and 1 tsp of mustard powder and glaced the meatoaf the last ten minutes of cooking (I cooked the whole thing for about 1 hour 15 minutes.  I will use my new creation as my new favorite meatloaf recipe.

This was tasty!  I did not have any onion so I used 1/2 tsp of onion powder and I followed other reviews and replaced the Italian seasoning with steak seasoning.  I was going to make these last night for supper but hubby wanted chick fil a so I made these for lunch.  SO GOOD!  I only had cheese on top, I really did not need that.  Thanks for sharing:)

This is our usual burger recipe, except with ground turkey instead.  Sometimes we add liquid smoke flavoring when we use the forman grill or we add more Worcestershire or mix in other seasonings but any way we make them they are still delicious.

Excellent. The sun actually came out for a couple of hours last week so we got the barbecue out for the first time this summer and made these. I made them just as stated and can't wait for the sun to make another appearance so I can make them again. Many Thanks.

Great recipe! I was pleasantly surprised, because on the surface it seems all to simple. I did like some readers suggested, and replaced the italian seasoning with montreal steak seasoning, and it was great! The only thing I would say is if you do that, omit the salt, as the steak season has plenty. I didn't, and it was still good, but on the verge of being to salty. Thanks!

These were just okay.  I added some bread crumbs because the mixture was a bit too wet.  My husband and I both thought that the Italian seasoning was too strong and overpowering.  Next time I will do as others suggested and replace it with steak seasoning.  But the onions and garlic added great flavor.

What a wonderful burger!  We made these exactly as the recipe states, grilling them outside on the BBQ.  We brought them inside and placed them between 2 slices of buttered sourdough bread, topping each burger with provolone cheese.  We then grilled them in a frying pan as you would when making grilled cheese sandwiches.  DELICIOUS!

I just used this recipe for a cookout last weekend and EVERYONE loved the burgers! Even people that weren't eating one had someone close to them saying, "You have to try this!" I went a little lighter on the garlic and onion, but refrigerating before hand is a must!

Good old fashioned hamburgers, nothing like the smell of them grilling. The secret is indeed in refrigerating long enough for the flavors to mingle and unify. DELICIOUS!

Really great burgers!  I was complimented they were on par with gourmet burgers purchased at a restaurant.  I modified the recipe slightly and used some crushed red pepper in lieu of the Italian seasoning. Will definitely make again in the future!

This was soo good. My husband and I no longer wish to go out to the gourmet burger places. We eat them on the thin sandwich bread, and add spinach, some turkey bacon, sliced tomatoes, and a drizzle of bbq sauce. Thank you so much for this recipe.

Easy to make, got a lot of compliments on the burgers, but not for me I guess. I could tell why many have said it tasted like meatloaf.

Good flavor. I used 2 garlic cloves and green onions because that is all I had at home. Topped with American cheese, tomato, and lettuce. Tasty, but  I probably won't make again because  my boyfriend wasn't feeling the ingredients.

These were excellent burgers.  They do not taste like meatloaf.  The italian seasoning was very good, thought it might be overpowering but it wasn't.  The texture is just like a hamburger.  Very good recipe

These burgers are not just for on the grill!  I make these once a week since finding this recipe.  The family loves the basil and garlic flavors and the burgers sear up nicely on the skillet with the olive oil in them.  I do add one egg and 1/2 cup of bread crumbs to hold the burgers together a little better.

These burgers were good. I made exactly as written and they went on the George Foreman grill and made the whole kitchen smell yummy! I made carmelized onions, toasted the buns and put swiss cheese on top and my hubby loved 'em! Thanks for the recipe.

I omit the Italian-style seasoning.  Added a little bit of milk to have a juicier burger.  Was pretty good.

Nice, juicy and flavorful. Not spectacular, but very good. I used part ground beef, part ground chicken, and seasoned salt instead of regular.

Just made these for four families and they were a hit, even with the kids. Very tasty and did not come apart. Also very easy to make and the ingredients are likely in your pantry already.

I made these for a cookout last summer and now that it is getting warm again, my friends have been requesting these. They are super easy to make, just make sure to follow the suggestion about chilling them for a few hours prior to cooking them- it really enhances the flavor.

I made a very similar and this has to be probably the best recipe; it makes the burgers so juicy and flavorful! Higher fat beef will make it juicier.

I made this for my family and they LOVED it. While grilling these, I also basted them with a good quality teriyaki sauce that just made these pop with flavor. I will definitely be making this dish again.

While this was good, it tasted like it should have been a meatloaf instead of a burger.  Next time I make it - I will not use the Italian Seasoning.

These came out fantastic.  The only modifications I made were I put in 3 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce and an extra clove of garlic (we're garlic fanatics).  I also added 2 tbsp of olive oil and 1 egg to help hold it together.  Then I topped it off with some provolone cheese.  My entire family absolutely loved the way these turned out.

My husband LOVED this recipe and so did I.  It has a great flavor and its very quick to make.  I didn't have time to marinate and it still tasted fantasic.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting to spice up the average hamburger.

I made this for a barbeque and it's amazing how many people came up to me and said, "Wow!  Those burgers are great!".  Made the recipe exactly as stated.  It was great!

We love this recipe!  This is our standard hamburger now and have made it at least half a dozen times.  I usually add a couple extra tablespoons of worcestershire though and double up on the garlic as we love the stuff!

I made this with 90% lean beef and it came out really tasty.  My husband and I liked that it just tasted like a really good burger, not a weird concoction of flavors.  Using the low-fat beef, I did add a little bit of olive oil for moisture (I would have preferred chicken broth if I had it on hand!).

This is a great burger recipe to use if your flame grilling...instead of the italian seasoning blend, I used Montreal Steak Seasonings.  Everyone at my picnic wanted to know the secret!

I really wanted to like this recipe, and I can see that it does appeal to many people.  However, I found it to be quite unappealing.  I wound up wasting a couple of pounds of ground round, because no one could finish his burger.

A new twist on a summertime favorite.  By the end of the summer, hamburgers on the grill don't seem special anymore.  With this recipe, I can make that 'specialness' last longer.

Good burger! I grated my onion in because it adds so much flavor. I forgot to add the italian seasoning, and wouldn't next time anyway, because that reminds me of one of my meatball recipes. Thank you for a simple burger!

Seemed fine. Unfortunately I didn't get to put the seasoned meat in the fridge beforehand. I did add an egg and the patty didn't fall apart.

Made some grilled onions and put those and swiss cheese on top. I'll probably leave out the Italian seasoning next time and maybe add something to hold the burgers together better.

Sometimes simple is best and that's certainly the case with these burgers. I made two minor changes, I micro planed the onion and garlic and I cooked them in a cast iron skillet. I can't wait to try these on the grill!

Juicy, but tastes like meatloaf.  Not a problem, especially if you like to add toppings, but there is a very distinct meatloaf taste and feel to these.  

Followed the recipe exactly, just added a little bit of egg as a binder for forming the patties later.  All in all, my guests enjoyed these burgers, so who really cares if they taste like meatloaf?

Cooked them slowly on the stove and then cranked it up at the end to have a nice crunch on them. We will definitely make  it again. I read the other reviews and decided to cut the Italian seasoning in half but will do the full amount next time because it could've use it. 
Everyone has different taste buds and I like things hot, spicy and full flavored.  :)

Very good. I like the onions and garlic inside the burger. Because my husband and I like our burgers medium-rare, I sauteed the onion and garlic in butter before adding to the burger.

I thought this made for flavorful hamburgers with the nice crunch of the onions. Quick and easy! I would make them again! I let them marinate for about 3 hours before cooking.

Used lean ground beef, followed recipe exactly, burgers were very moist, spices good, does not taste like meatloaf but next time I make it I will add a some chilli powder to give it a little more kick.

Loved this recipe. Instead of following to the T I added 1 Tablespoon Grey Poupon and did 2 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce. Then I actually fried it in two table spoons of EVOO on the stove because I don't own a grill in my apartment. Definitely making these again, hopefully I can try them on the grill one day. Roommates and boyfriend loved them too!

these were pretty decent.. more like a 3.5.. i followed the recipe to a T and felt like this was lacking in salt.. i'd add maybe 1/2 tsp more if i decided to make this again.. i didn't feel like the flavors were overwhelming like others did.. and it didn't taste like meatloaf to me.. i think i was hoping for something a little more bold.. ty for the recipe

OMG! These burgers are to die for! They are juicy and flavorful.  Per other reviews, I used Montreal steak seasoning in place of Italian seasoning.  I used ground chuck, used my garlic press so it wouldn't be too chunky; 3 finely chopped shallots, omitted the salt and added fresh chopped basil.  YUM..so good.  Will be my only burger recipe from now on and can't wait to make for company.  Do not over-mix meat or over-handle when forming burgers.  You don't want them too dense.  Mine were formed into loose patties.

This is probably the best burger I've grilled. I subbed shallots for onions since I didn't have any onions and it worked out GREAT! This will be the ONLY way I will grill burgers from now on.

Absolutely delicious.  Refrigerating the meat definitely strengthens the flavor.  The burgers were moist and delicious.  The only change that I made was to substitute monterey steak seasoning for the Italian seasoning.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I like to keep burgers simple and this is it. I have done this for 50yrs and do not stray much except to use A-1 sometimes.  I have begun to leave the salt out until cooking and salt them as I turn them.  great recipe I have served to thousands of people over the years, nice to see someone else has similar taste. I use garlic and onion powders but it is not the same and the key is mince the onion and garlic , I think.

We made these for my daughter's Baptism. We had a small bbq at our house afterwards. I think we used less onions than the recipe called for. Everyone enjoyed their burgers, so I think it was a hit!!

I really liked these.  Added more garlic and double the italian seasoning and didn't add any additional salt.  A few of my patties started to come apart a bit so I think I'll address that next time I make these.  Other than that they were fabulous!

These were okay. We made them over the weekend for a party and no one said "oh wow, these are amazing!" Just your normal polite, "Great food". I will try something different next time.

We absolutely LOVED these burgers. I cooked them on the big smoker outside (like grill) and they came out perfect. Wow! I also added ONE egg and some Slap Ya Mama Cajun seasoning to the already said ingredients. I used ground Sirloin. so tasty.

I followed the recipe exactly and refrigerated them for 8 hours.  I'm sorry, but was disappointed that the taste wasn't detectable enough to think of them as garlic and onion flavored.   I used fresh garlic, onion, and seasonings so I know it wasn't that.  I'd like to try letting them marinate for 24 hours.

Hubby, youngest son & I liked these but the other 3 kids didn't like them at all. They do have a meatloaf flavor w/the Italian seasoning & minced onion(I even halved the Italian seasoning).

These were delicious!  The only change I made was to add an egg and a half-cup of bread crumbs (to a doubled recipe), although that may not have been necessary.  Also, while on the grill, as well as using bbq sauce, I poured a little wine on each one.  The Italian seasoning was just right for our taste buds.  Mmmmm!

These were good burgers--easy to put together.  They didn't taste like meatloaf like other reviewers said.  At least not MY meatloaf!  :-)  I'd make them again.

I was going to give this recipe 5 stars as I made them exactly to the recipe and loved them.   I made these for my husband and kids to take to Scout Camp and doubled the quantity to get 8 full burgers (and there was a little left over for me to try one at home).   I am giving 4 stars however as my husband said he thought they were a little bland.  There were no comments from the other campers either.  Perhaps I didn't season quite enough but I had meant to use a little Tabasco in the mix and didn't, next time I think I will.  Doubling this recipe gave me 8 large plentiful burgers and I thought the one I had was really juicy and tasty.  I bought the pre-chopped onions in the tub and I think they were cut a little large.  There seemed to be too many onions in the mix.  I also used Italian seasoning and I think some fresh herbs might have worked rather than dried.  Maybe I should have used steak seasoning like other reviewers.  I flash fried my burger to seal it then popped it in the oven until fully cooked.  I thought this burger was delicious!

These were excellent!  We loved them.  I used ground turkey and since my eldest son has developed an onion alergy, I used a couple of tablespoons of dry onion soup mix.  Just a quick tip, if you have a griddle, make them on there (400 deg).  They were all done at the same time.  Great time saver and no over cooking trying to keep them warm.

Hamburgers can be bland, the seasonings in this recipe made these special.  They even reheated very nicely.  I took one to work the next day and carried it back to my desk and several people went "mmmmmmm...what have you got?"

I also added 1 egg to keep it all together.

These are so good!  I changed the recipe a little by adding twice as much worcestershire and omiting the salt and Italian seasoning.  They were moist and  delicious but not too salty--perfect.  In fact we are having them for dinner again tonight.  Thanks, great recipe!

This recipe was great! I added a few tablespoons of oats, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. My dad said they were the best burgers he's ever had...and he can be quite picky! :)

This recipe is delicious, but my husband and I both like it better when we omit the Italian seasoning.

Terrific burgers. I made them for my roommates, and all of them said they were great, so much better than plain old hamburgers. I added an extra clove of garlic, and a little more couldn't have hurt (my friends and I love garlic). I will definitely make them again in the near future.

This was pretty good. I just thought it could us something a little extra. I wasn't bad but, there was just something missing?

Good burgers - a little on the dry side.  I used cajun spice instead of the Italian seasoning.  My husband said they were too garlicky (?).  Will keep playing around with my burger mixture.

We tried this recipe and LOVED it!  I did not have any Italian Seasoning on hand, so I left it out.  We are sure to make these burgers again...thanks!

We really weren't thrilled with the Italian seasoning taste.  I think I will try it again with less worcestershire, Cavender's Greek seasoning, and add some green chili peppers.

we liked the idea of this burger.  We made them per instruction but they had way too much onion and the consistancy was like meatloaf.  We'll definately try it again but with less onion and something to add some ZING to the tatse...

Everyone liked these. It is nice to have something different then the plain old burger all the time. Will make again.
