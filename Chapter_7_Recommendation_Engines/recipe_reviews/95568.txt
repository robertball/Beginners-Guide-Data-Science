I ended up with two large bags of persimmons so I tried five different persimmon bread/pudding recipes from this site and this recipe was the winner (to be served Christmas Eve)!

    First, I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out great.  The second time I made it, I added one TB of soy milk, substitued 1/8 cup of wheat germ for i/8 cup of the flour, and added two TBS of brandy.  This also turned out great.
    I baked it in a buttered and floured pie dish, then unmolded it and dusted it with powdered sugar.  On Christmas Eve, I'll serve it with brandied whipped cream on the side.

This was absolutely delicious.  Probably the best pudding I have ever made!  It got rave reviews from everyone in my family. It was moist, light, a little chewy on the edges, not too sweet yet flavoursome. Perfection!

Okay, so this sounded really good.  Unfortunately there must be a mistake with the measurement of the baking soda because this was a recipe gone completely wrong!  It was a total waste of time and ingredients because the batter tasted like a big alka-seltzer tab!  My roomate and I did have a great  laugh over the catastrophe though!  Once it was baked it retained the same flavor  which was of salt and fizzy baking soda.  It was horrible!  Please look over the ingredients list!

I have loved this recipe in years past but is has evolved in to something even better over the last few years. 

First off, I mistakenly used evaporated milk once instead of sweetened condensed milk and it made a vast improvement - now I always do it. It makes it moist, decadently dense and a smidge less sweet, which I prefer. 

I also like to double this recipe and cook it in my grandmother's bundt pan (adding about 20 minutes to the cooking time) and I find that a water bath helps keep it moist and uncracked.

This year I've had to cut out gluten but didn't want to cut out this holiday favorite. To replace the flour I used 1/2 Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free All Purpose Baking Flour, 1/4 Tapioca Flour and 1/4 Sorghum Flour plus 2 tsp of xanthum gum.

Other additions: a jigger of brandy cream, 1/4 tsp nutmeg. 1/4 tsp cloves.

My family loves this and fondly refers to it as Piggy Pudding.

We have a persimmon tree so I'm glad to find another good recipe. The only problem is this was far too sweet. I would add just 2/3 cup of sugar. Also, it overbaked on the outside. I might try baking it in a waterbath next time.

WOW!  I did not expect this to taste so great!  I was kind of weary at first with the SCM because I don't really care for it, but it's not too sweet.  This pudding is absolutely delicious!

I am from the home of the Persimmon Festival and know good puding.  This was cakelike and I was very disappointed. No one would eat it.

My kids loved this. It's like a bread pudding with pumpkin pie flavor.  Perfect with a sploosh of whipped cream on top.  Not as good after a day, so plan on making this and serving soon after.

Loved it! Never cooked with persimmons before and this was the first recipe I tried and it was a big hit! Was really great with vanilla ice cream and hot fudge!

I used regular milk and half the sugar, and it still turned out amazing. I also added extra cinnamon and a little nutmeg. I definitely recommend Gram's amazing and malleable persimmon pudding recipe.

This was tasty, and although the "pudding" title was misleading, I did notice the amount of flour in the recipe, so I wasn't terribly surprised when it came out "cake".  Still, good.  Added nutmeg and cloves.

Easy and very good but too sweet for my taste. I took out the cup of white sugar and replace it with a 1/4 cup of brown sugar. Increased the cinnamon to 1/2 teaspoon.

I made this without the cinnamon as I wanted to taste more of the persimmon flavor.  I would definitely make this again!  Very moist and flavorful.

I have made this several times in the last two years. I lost the original recipe my grandma had given me and I was heartbroken until I stumbled across this recipe. IT is exactly the same and even cooked in the same type of baking dish. Thank you for the recipe! I highly recommend it.

This was amazing!!  It was moist, not too sweet... what a great way to use up persimmons from our tree.  Thank you for the recipe. I'm making it again this week and might even make extra to freeze.

MMMM!!! This was great!! I had never had a persimmon before last week, and I saw some and wanted to try one. Then I had 3 left over and looked on AR...I really enjoyed this!! I had a carton of cream, and I put in about 1/2 cup of whole cream to make sure it would be really moist! Great sweet buttery taste!!MMM!!
