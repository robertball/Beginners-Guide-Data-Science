If you WEIGH 2oz sugar, 4oz butter and 6oz flour for a round pan this is PERFECT.  Simple and AUTHENTIC recipe - trust me the generations of home shortbread makers in Scotland will tell you the same thing!  Thank you for this great recipe.  (Use your hands and mix then plop into pan and press in, prick with fork, cook on 300 degrees for thirty minutes and when it starts to BROWN slightl it will be ready.  Cut when still cooling and sprinkle sugar on top).  PERFECT.

This shortbread recipe has made me famous around the neighborhood.  The best part of this recipe is that it is a quick and easy make with ingredients I usually have around the house that is super delicious.  One tip I learned from a French chef that makes this recipe even better than it already is: when adding the butter to the flour and sugar, it helps if you chill the butter first and then cut it up into small cubes (I cut the butter in half lengthwise twice and just chop from there).  Then, with your fingertips, knead the butter into the flour and sugar.  The idea here is not to end up with dough but rather crumbs.  If you start to end up with dough, you should put the dough in the refrigerator a while to let it cool down.  After you end up with crumbs, you should let it sit in the refrigerator for at least an hour before baking (half the time I skip this step though).  Additionally, as someone else has already said, wait to cut the shortbread until it's cooled because it comes out of the oven very soft and will crumble if you cut it just after it comes out of the oven.

Oh My God...these are wonderful. I baked them a little longer(until top had just a hint of color). They were perfect ...crispy with softer centers. Do not cut until completely cold, then they won't crumble. Excellent!

I made these before going to a campout along with another type of cookie I made oft times before. I look for easy inexpensive recipes because I like to share and don't have much money or time.

These Scottish cookies are absolutely wonderful. Very easy to make. Crumbly, but not too bad in that area. And though the texture was a bit of a surprise, it added to the overall effect. They taste great without any embellishments and are very filling. They were a HUGE hit at the campout and I have people requesting more for next time.

The recipe is good and easy.  I baked these for my British neighbors with rave reviews. The helpful advice I followed from the reviewers: I baked these at 300 degrees for 30 min, I mixed the ingredients by hand, sprinkled w/sugar after baking and cut once they had cooled a bit.

Absolutely yummy. I really have to let it go cold, before you cut it up. Or it will crumble.

This is an excellent recipe.  Taste even better than the Walker shortbread that you buy in the store. You can make it crunchier by adding a teaspoon of corn starch.  Very easy to make.

Very good.  I added a 1/2 tsp of almond extract and froze it before cutting it into wedges (I used a pie 9 in. plate).  Thanks for the recipe!

I have been making and eating shortbread all my life.  It has to be my favorite biscuit of all time.  I did have to make a charge to this recipe.  Personally using brown sugar, I find the taste is not correct.  Instead of the brown sugar use white sugar.  These taste far more superior and more like the traditional shortbread from England and Scotland.  Make sure you don't over bake, a shortbread biscuit should be pale, it will firm as soon as they cool.

I was born and raised in Dublin, Ireland and have grown up eating Walkers Shortbread. When family come to visit they always bring walkers with them, I've told them to save their money! This recipe was so cheap and easy to make and the flavour is close enough for me.

These had good flavor, but they were so crumbly, they had to be eaten with a spoon. Also, too thick when cooked in a 9x9 pan. Shortbread should be crispy, not crumbly.

I used weight not volume as suggested, tossed in a tad more butter, because I had it, added about 1/4 tsp salt and about 1 tsp vanilla.  I then took about a tablespoon of dough and pressed it into buttered mini-muffin tin cups.  I found that if the dough was about half way up the cup it was the best amount.  I baked it on 350F for about 18 minutes. Careful as they turn brown from one minute to the next.  It made about 24 little cookies not counting the uncooked dough I could not resist eating!!

Is it me, or is this recipe missing a cooking time? Even an estimate would be helpful, 10 minutes an hour, whatever.

I enjoyed this simple recipe! I read some of the other reviews, and baked at 350 for 30 mins and let cool, I sprinkled sugar ontop after 20 mins of baking and added a ts of vanilla. I used a pizza cutter to make sqaures and the shortbread squares came out perfect! Will make a lemon glaze or dip in chocolate and nuts next time!

I really love shortbread, so this was super disappointing.  The flaws are mostly in the method, but here are a few remedies.  Start w/cold butter cut into 1/2"-1" pieces pulsed w/the flour.  The missing salt is really noticeable.  It needs at least 1/4 tsp of salt, maybe even 1/2 tsp (haven't tried that much yet).  Refrigerating for an hour or before shaping/baking.

The first time I tried the recipe I didn't have enough butter so I tried to make a half batch and it came out terrible.  I tried again yesterday with the full ingredients and it came out perfect.  I made small round balls then flattened them and pricked them with a fork.  They smell and taste as good as Walker's brand.  My father likes them better than Walker's.  I will be using this recipe often.  I love that it's so simple with only 3 ingredients.

So simple yet so delicious.  I used salted sweet cream butter, my store brand, and it was amazing.  I then bought a european butter and the taste was way off.  So the butter you use makes all the difference in the world.

This simple shortbread is exactly what I was looking for: no fuss, delicious, and what I consider to be the real deal (though I'm not Scottish...). But adjustments / additional instructions to the recipe are necessary: Since there is no time listed for baking in the recipe, I would recommend keeping an eye on the shortbread after just a few minutes. I'm not sure how long mine took to bake, because all of a sudden I turned around and the edges were browning. Just be sure to keep an eye on the shortbread in the oven and you'll have delicious shortbread! 

Also, you might want to consider cutting the wedges before baking, and then cutting them again while the shortbread is still at least a little bit warm, or I believe you'll risk crumbling.

Have tried other shortbread cookies from this site and I think these are the easiest!  I don't have a cookie press and normally I had to use a small glass to cut out cookies and they were VERY delicate.  I flattened the dough in a round 9" springform pan and it was super easy... the hard part is waiting for them to cool.

I tried to fine my mother's scottish shortbread recipe which I've lost - and this is the closest thing to it. Use 1 full cup of butter instead to make it less crumbly, and of course, much more buttery.  That's how I remember it, so take it or leave it.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is fantastic! My husband added 1/4 tsp vanilla extract. It was gone less than 24 hours after I made it. Next time I plan to use it as a base for fruit pizza.

I made two batches of this, one following the recipe exactly and the other following the most helpful positive review  (2oz sugar, 4oz butter, 6or flour, 300C for 30mins). They both turned out great!

I made this recipe using Imperial margarine in place of butter because that is what I had.  Overall it was very good!  I will make this recipe again.  My kids and their friends enjoyed it!  I mixed the dough together with my hands and pressed it into a buttered pie plate, pricked holes in the top with a fork and baked it for about 35 minutes total at 350 degrees.  I think next time I will use a bigger dish to press the dough in so that it will be thinner and more crisp as a result.  Mine was not cooked in the center despite putting it back in the oven twice, maybe this is because I used margarine instead of butter?  I sprinkled sugar over the top after it was done cooking.  I will use this recipe again and try it with butter and maybe a little more sugar and some vanilla flavoring.

very Good! My Grandma is originally from Scotland and use to make Scottish shortbread all the time for her American Grandchildren. Tastes just like what she use to make! I did make them into small round shaped cookies and poke with a fork instead of the traditional big round shape. I also made the dough a few days ahead of time and refridgerated it and pulled it out 4 days later to bake, still tastes good! (might want to let it sit an hour or more before working with as it's very stiff after being in the fridge.

First time I made this it did not turn out great - I realized the cheap unsalted butter that had been in my fridge for a couple weeks was the problem. I made this again today, with high quality salted butter (local HOPE creamery) and it turned out wonderful! With so few ingredients, use the best stuff you can. It was also a bit thick (I used a 9 inch square pan) so I held back half a cup or so of ready dough and it came out with better texture. I will bake the leftover dough as a couple cookies.

This is a good basic shortbread recipe but it is better if you substitute 2 tbsp of the flour with rice flour.   Also, shortbread sould age for a few days before eating and that way it is not nearly as crumbly.   Have been making many types of shortbreads for years and they will keep for weeks in a covered tin just on the shelf

I haven't made shortbread in years.  This recipe turned out pretty good, EXCEPT it doesn't say how long to bake.  I checked every 10 minutes & finally took them out of the oven after 35 minutes.  I should have baked another 5 or 10 minutes.  I used a round, glass pie pan.

I was looking for a traditional recipe and this is it. I do add a pinch of salt (as my Scottish nana taught me). i make mine in muffin tins so i have easy portions made. and i use my food processor for all the mizing (cream the butter, sugar and salt and then slowly add the flour). People rave about them!

This was so simple and delicious. I used margarine instead of butter, and it worked wonderfully. The flavor and texture are great - it's light and a little crisp. I let the shortbread cool before cutting, and that kept it from being crumbly. I also sprinkled the shortbread with sugar while it was cooling to add a little sparkle and sweetness. Great recipe!

Excellent, simple but delicious recipe for traditional Scottish shortbread.  Made just as described, and all came out perfectly.  I use the kitchenaid for most of it, then mix in the final bit of flour by hand.  Recently put in some green food coloring to serve on St. Patrick's Day - Celtic roots....

Very good. I grew up in Scotland and have eaten a lot of shortbread. I like to use Kerrygold butter which is an Irish butter. It can be found here in the US. In Scotland we use "caster sugar" which is a finer sugar than the regular kind. I found some "superfine" sugar here which seems to be the same. This requires just the right amount of baking time, so know the idiosyncrasies of your oven and work with them

Couldn't be simpler!  And tastes like the real deal. We've visited Scotland a couple of times, once on the isle of Skye at the Hebridean Hotel Broadford. Their shortbread was made fresh daily and was always in a tin covered in castor sugar. Their recipe was too large for me to convert but this recipe of Cheryl O's has pretty much nailed it!  I sprinkle sugar on it before it bakes and when I take it out. Just shake off the excess. Works beautifully in silicone bakeware, just don't slice too deep!  Hard, expensive Walker's is history in this house! Thanks so much!

GREAT recipe. I followed MOUSIREID instructions, and did it by weight, and I liked the turn out. It is a bit more of the crumbly side, even after cutting after cool, but its nice and "light" (as much as 1 stick of butter can be I suppose). It's not super sweet, so it pairs well with tea. The sprinkle of sugar did a nice touch, and I ended up leaving mine in the oven for 3 minutes longer to color it a bit. I only wish I had a nice orange or berry jam to spread a bit atop it! Terrific little treat for anyone.  I dare you to try and keep it past a day, I definitely made excuses to go to the kitchen every few minutes...

Tried this recipe yesterday.  To a T and it was fine until I tried cutting it.  It all absolutely crumbled apart and though the overall taste was OK it was dry and not buttery like I expected.  Still searching . . . . .

The BEST shortbread recipe I have ever come across, almost better than the original Scottish Shortbread you buy in those fancy tins!!! Always works out perfectly, even though I often triple the recipe. I usually make them as round biscuits and sprinkle lightly with sugar (warning, these disappear far too fast!) just make sure you use REAL butter for the taste

Just what I hoped for light, buttery, sandy ... One question: When I pat the dough into the pan, how can I make the top nice and smooth? Mine came out a little ugly , due to my uneven patting!
And I doubled the recipe too and thought it turned out fine; I used a larger baking pan.

If you like shortbread you'll love this recipe. I have made it twice and it is was simple and perfect both tries. I can see adding to this basic recipe easily if you wanted to add any special twits to it.

This was a great and quick recipe and I liked that it does yield a smaller amount because I was baking for only 2 (i used 9X9 pan and cut about 16 little squares.  I cooked for 28 minutes.   I also warmed raspberry jam after I took the shortbread out of the oven and drizzled on.  I let cool for a long time and had no crumbling.

Update: I made these again and followed another review to put the dough in mini-muffins pans. This is a great idea. I had left over raspberries and strawberries, so I put one or two small pieces in each tin. This was perfect and much needed otherwise the shortbread would have been too thick for me without another flavor. I love this recipe, it is so fast!! Also, when using the minis pan, it cooked for about 15 minutes.

I made this recipe for the first time 3 days ago and loved it, though I did add nearly a tbsp. of vanilla extract.  The dough was very sticky when I placed it in the pan, so in the future I might add a little extra flour. Oh, and I did sprinkle a little sugar on the top while it was baking.  The flaky density and buttery flavor is fantastic! Friends have enjoyed this and I will make it again!  Thanks for the recipe!

Cut before baking.  Added scraped pulp of 1/2 vanilla bean to butter and sugar before creaming, then add flour.  Baked in cast iron skillet.  Fabulous!  Best shortbread I have ever tasted.

Well I've never really tasted traditional or non-store bought shortbread and this was a great way to take my first taste. At first I was relunctant to bake it because it seemed to simple to be good! I must say like the other reviewers it was a little 'cakey'. But I don't think I baked it long enough anyway (only 8 minutes!) I also added 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract and 1/4 almond extract which added a extra kick!

Fantastic! So easy to make and so very good. I usedsalted butter and ppressed into the pan, and leveled with a spoon to smooth. I then baked at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. I let cool for 10 minutes, and then placed in the fridge for 20. After it was completely cool, I cut into squares. It did NOT crumble- it was crunchy on top and perfectly tender underneath.

Goodbye store-bought shortbread!!!!  This was wonderful and easy.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and "cut" cold butter in and mixed with fingertips until crumbly.  I didn't have the right size pan so I made them into cookies by squishing a tablespoon full into a ball then pressing it down with a fork.  They still came out flaky and wonderful.

I've made this my go-to shortbread recipe and use the food processor as I do for pie crust.  Quick, easy, and just like Scotland.

Im sorry but I was disappointed in this recipe. I saw all the great reviews and thought for sure this would be close to how my mum used to make them. She was from Scotland . her shortbread was wonderful and full of a buttery flavour. No one like them and compare them to paste...not being mean just honest.

This is better than my favorite red box brand Scottish shortbread cookies.  Added 1/4 tsp vanilla and 1/8 tsp almond extract.  My kids loved it!!!

I made this shortbread yesterday, and sorry to say, was not very impressed. It just tasted like a butter crust, and not really shortbread.

How many things in life turn out just right?  This is one of them -- the sweetness, richness, firm yet crumbly texture all evenly balance to make this as close to perfection as you're likely to ever get.  A great addition to our holidays!

these were awesome - i doubled the batch and put them i glass baking dishes - 300 degrees for 40 mins.  i did add about a tablespoon of mexican vanilla extract and one teaspoon of salt. i put the dishes in the fridge after coming out of the oven for about 20 minutes and they were easy to cut.

I used fruit sugar instead of icing sugar and baked this in a 9x9 pan. When cold I frosted it with a butter cream icing, garnished with chopped walnuts and quartered marashino cherries. Then I cut them into squares with a sharp paring knife to serve as Shortbread Sq.  I found them a little thick. Next time I will try putting them into a 9x12 pan instead. They are delicious! The same recipe can be doubled, rolled by the tablespoon full into balls and baked as cookies. These I also frost with a petit four icing and garnish with a 1/2 a marashino cherry. My guests love those at Christmas time and they are also nice to put into gift containers for friends.

Delicious, although a bit too thick for me. I'd consider putting in in 2 rounds for thinner slices. So incredibly easy to make and definitely a quick fix for something sweet.

These were very tasty. The only thing I did do was added 1 Tablespoon of vanilla. However I used a round dish and it came out think, so next time I would will use a 9X13 pan and it will be much thinner....

These do taste just like Walker's Shortbread! I followed a couple of extra tips posted, I added about 1 tsp of cornstarch which gave the shortbread more of a crunch/crumble texture than a cakey one and I added about a 1/2 tsp of almond extract. Yummy!

I was a little skeptical, because the recipe seemed almost too easy.  I had been looking for a Scottish shortbread recipe to make at home.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out perfectly.  SO DELICIOUS and buttery. After reading other reviews, I did let it sit out for about 15 minutes before I attempted to cut it and it was not crumbly.  I cut them into little kit-kat size bars and they held there shape fine.  If you like Walker's shortbread, this is the recipe for you.  Yummy.

My husband's family is Scottish and we love this recipe.  It is so simple and great tasting.  I've probably made it a dozen times and it will continue to be a favorite of my family.  I double the recipe with no problems.  I also make it with Splenda instead of sugar most of the time.  It still turns out great.

this is the best shortbread recipe I have ever made.  Just like the Walker's I didn't beleive it until I made it for myself.  I baked it for 30 minutes at 300F.  This is now my #1 shortbread recipe and I have added it to my favourites.  Sooooo simple

if you press relly hard into pan before you bake, they wont crumble. I used a metal spatula. I also like to place a layer of chocolate chips on top while hot and spread like frosting then allow to cool.I can't believe how easy these are to make.So So good!

I'd never made Scottish shortbread before, so i followed it letter for letter; and it turned out delicious! Although i might add, a previous poster suggested setting the oven to 300 for 30 minutes, it took me 45 to cook it. So maybe the original 350 was better--and just watch it till it gets brown around the edges. The finished product will melt in your mouth!

My first time making shortbread and it was amazing.  I used an 8x8 pan instead, 'blended' the dough with my hands, and baked it for about 25 minutes.  I don't think I had 2 pieces before they were all gone.

So tasty!!!  My British husband wished that I had sprinkled sugar on top (as one reviewer recommended), but I liked it less sweet.  Fabulous texture if kept in the refrigerator (they tasted fresher than the ones that were left out).  I mixed by hand.  We'll definitely make this  again and again!

Thank you for this great recipe Cheryl.  Works well for each batch.  If you are making it without a blender, give the dough a good knead and it will not be as floury.  I added 1 cup of butter for more buttery flavour.  Agree that better to make many batches instead of doubling as the dough will be unwieldy.

I used these ingredients to make a doughy pile of heaven when I was younger but it never occurred to me that I could bake it!  =)  I made these when craving a good cookie to go with my tea; these turned out wonderfully.

This recipe is VERY simple, but the finished product just isn't that great. This shortbread has a very floury, heavy taste and texture. It was crumbly and tasted pretty good when fresh from the oven, though. (Of course, it should be noted that even though I didn't like this recipe all that well, I still managed to eat 2/3 of the pan all by myself over the course of a few days!) Bottom line: Edible, not incredible.

LOVE this shortbread recipe! I make a triple batch every year for my holiday party and it vanishes almost before I can have a bite! I did add one more ingredient to this, about a 1/3 tsp sea salt, and i do use organic salted butter. Comes out wonderful every time!

This was so easy and quick to make. And the taste is wonderful!  Much better than anything store bought.  They are creamy, buttery, and have just the right amount of sweetness.

This recipe is the most simple and best for shortbread. It's exactly as my grandmother and mother made.  The real secret is salted butter. Other recipes call for unsalted and it's just not the same. I use salted butter in all my cookies.

I did increase the sugar by two tablespoons after I tasted the butter/sugar mixture. Once I combined the ingredients, I added about a cup of roughly chopped pecans.

Total baking time was probably about 22 min in my gas oven.

My husband is in awe. Thank you for bringing me back to some great moments growing up.

HOLY COW THESE ARE AWESOME!!  Tastes just like Walker's Scottish Shortbread you can buy in the store...only better and cheaper!  I tweaked the recipe and used brown sugar and added 1 tsp of vanilla.  I also whipped my butter and brown sugar together before adding the vanilla and flour.  They were crumbly if you try to cut them while warm - let them cool overnight and then cut them.  Not crumbly and extremely decadent!!

The taste was great, made as is.. and topped with homemade peach and pecan preserves. I only gave it 3 stars because I did let it cool completely and it was still too crumbly and ugly, they were supposed to be my dish for the Easter potluck tomorrow and now have to make something else.

As written 4 stars. After following another reviewer's advice for very traditional Scottish shortbread, I WEIGHED 2oz sugar, 4oz butter and 6oz flour and put it in a round pie pan, this was PERFECT. Cut into wedges while it was hot. Let it cool a bit, and it was crispy outside, tender inside, flavorful and buttery. YUM.

Quick and simple recipe for shortbread buttery goodness.  I made this late one night when I was itching to bake but only had a few basic ingredients on hand. Followed this recipe exactly, even used a 9 x 9 glass pan. Important to wait until it cools before cutting.  I also sprinkled nutmeg on top before putting it into the oven, which perfected the recipe for me. This is a fairly traditional shortbread, texture is slightly crumbly but it still melts in your mouth. Will definitely be making again this year for the holidays!

Delicious!!  I think this is better than the Walker's shortbread cookies since it is so buttery and light.  The cookie just melts in your mouth.  I made this everyday for a week and then I made a double batch to see if it would last a little longer. No such luck.  It lasted about a day. I am going to try adding some mini chocolate chips to my next batch to see how they turn out.  The only problem with this recipe is that the cookies are so good you will eat more than you should.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.  

In some of the reviews, people have said that they added salt.  I use salted butter and found that this recipe is wonderful exactly as it is written.

Very good recipe - tastes just like how my grandmother used to make it for the holidays.  I wish there was a time on this recipe though because I had no idea how long to put it in for.  I started with 20 minutes and just kept checking until it was what appeared to be "done" and golden brown on top.  It's very crumbly at first, so I took other reviewers advice and waited until it was completely cooled before trying to cut into squares.   It was delicious and everyone loved it!  I love easy recipes that only need a few ingredients.

I loved how easy it was to mix together and put into the pan to bake. I doubled the recipe and it came out fantastic. Just a couple of tweeks - 1. I baked at 300F for 35 minutes and they came out fine. Can't wait to make it again. I will be giving it away for Christmas this year and just know our friends and family will enjoy this beautiful shortbread. Thanks Cheryl

This recipe is fantastic! I added 1 tsp. of vanilla, but that was the only change I made, and it is just perfect! I baked in a 9 in. round pan at 350º for 30-35 mins or so, just until barely golden. Thank you for the great recipe! I'll be making this more often than my hips would like, I'm sure.

I gave it 4 stars because its a happy medium between my tastes and my husband's (and his family's) tastes. He and my in-laws are pie crust eating fools lol. I, on the other hand, eat the filling and leave the crusts for dog or my husband (which ever begs first). If you like pie crust, this is a sweet version. It was good, just not to my liking. I think this would be good as the crust to either a fruit pizza, a cream and berry tart/torte or even a cheesecake. Maybe next time I'll throw in some nuts or slather it with jam (or chocolate!) I will definately will make again for the aforementioned experiments and for my husband ;o)

Wonderful!!! I followed the recipe by weighing the ingredients like a former reviewer suggested. I made 2 seperate batches and they are gone!!! I sprinkled green sugar on top after taking out of oven, to decorate for St. Patty's Day.  Just perfect!! Thanks!!!! Good note to remember is to not cut until cooled.

I made this recipe a slightly different way.  I sifted all dry ingredients into my mixer's bowl.  I added butter in chunks and whipped them until the dough was semi-firm and fluffy.  Put in a 9x13 pan and followed instructions from there.  My family LOVED this recipe.  Word to the wise, wait for the cookies to cool before trying to remove from pan.  They are prone to crumble before they cool.  Definitely worth your time! DELICIOUS!

Yum! Incredibly easy and delicious! This is a keeper. I baked at 350 for 30 minutes; next time I might leave it in the oven a few minutes longer, but otherwise, I followed the recipe and it came out great. Thank you!

Wonderful cookie!  I added 2 Tbs of dutch cocoa and 1 tsp vanilla to the batter, and they came out wonderfully--not too sweet, with a nice chocolate flavor!  I also baked them at 300 degrees for 30 minutes, and that seems just right.

Fabulous!  Can't believe I had never made shortbread.  This is the perfect way to start!  I think next time I'll make a parchment sling so it comes out of the pan more easily.  I baked it for 28 minutes.

This is a fabulous easy recipe.  To bring down the glycemic level I used honey instead of sugar and it worked perfectly.

I don't eat dairy, so I used Earth Balance Buttery Sticks instead of butter...probably a slightly different consistency in the end, but it was still delicious.  I baked in a springform pan and added about 2 T lavender flowers, plus a sprinkle of powdered sugar on top.

This recipe is delicious! The shortbread has a delicate, buttery texture that is divine! Since the recipe didn't say how long to bake it, I looked at a few other similar recipes and ended up baking it for 30 minutes. I also used a 9 inch, deep dish pie pan. It turned out perfectly! We topped it with ice cream and fresh strawberries from our garden!

Absolutely amazing. I threw all ingredients in the food processor (used a spatula to get the sides) so it was almost effortless. Only three dishes to wash! This is easier than buying them

Yummy shortbread recipe. Good texture and taste and very simple to make. I was worried about my crumbly mixture but once I packed it into the tray it was fine. I was able to cut it really easily once it was cool. I will make this recipe again.

To die for!!!  Very easy and I love that I always have the ingredients on hand.  I realized too late that I added 1/2 cup sugar instead of 1/3 cup, but it made no difference.  I added some vanilla, and baked at 300 for about 30 minutes.  I will definitely be making these again, probably in very large quantities.

This, according to my half scottish half english bf is spot on! I screwed up by overbeating the butter and my dough was sticky and soft, not stiff. Nonethless, I sprinkled some flour and kneaded it in by hand to form a slightly less sticky dough. I did not modify the proportions patted it into a 9.5inch spring form and it was perfect. I baked it at 300f or 150 degrees but it was slightly overbaked at 40mins. Next time I'll stick to 30mins. Other than that,I sprinkled about three tablespoons of sugar when it was cooling. I also used salted butter all the way, which gave it an interesting salty and sweet flavour. Next time I'll use half salted, half unsalted. Other than that, when I brought it to my bf's office, it was gone in minutes!

The flavor was really good.  I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13 glass pan.  I thoroughly beat my butter and sugar for about 5 minutes then I added the flour but only beat just enough to mix everything.  I took reviewers' suggestions and baked at 300F for 40 minutes, frequently checking for overbrowning.  The texture on the sides was super light and crispy.  The inside texture was comparable but slightly more tender.  I'm actually about to use this as a base to homemade Girl Scout Samoa cookies!

Good recipe.  I love that this is simple and easy to throw together in a jiffy!  I followed the recipe exactly and then used an egg wash on the top and sprinkled with a little bit of decorator sugar.  So yummy and that tiny bit of sugar on top gave a occasional crunch.  Goes great with coffee!

This came out great - just don't forget to prick it!! I did & got a very cake like finish, which worked out great for what I was doing (baked apple topping). I can't wait to try it again, this time remembering to prick the dough. The taste was wonderful!

I made this for my neighboor as a Christmas gift.  She comes from a Scottish family and has been looking for a good recipe for shortbread that rivals her Auntie's.  She took a bite of this and got chills and said 'This is it!'

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for.  I ended up leaving mine in the oven about 25-30 minutes.  It's true that this recipe is not crunchy, but it was very crispy and seemed to just melt in my mouth.  This recipe is great alone and with some additions.  Yummy!

I am so glad I decided to look up a recipe for shortbread. I'm not a great baker (I'm pretty bad actually), but I figured I would give it a go. This recipe, along with the suggestions in the reviews, was very helpful. 
 I weighed out the ingredients as suggested by MOUSIREID. I baked it in a  glass pie plate for 35 minutes at 325 degrees.  I finally learned to start with semi soft butter and knead the dough very well, after trial and error. 
 My family loves this, and I love it. The shortbread is perfect and flaky. Thanks

Great recipe - so easy! I changed mine a little for orange shortbread cookies by adding a teaspoon of vanilla extract, three tablespoons of orange juice and the zest of one orange. This recipe is great by itself or as a starting point for creating other fruited or flavored shortbread cookies! Yummy!

Great cookie! Easy to mix, and bake and eat!  I added different chips (chocolate, butterscotch, toffee) to various batches and they all came out well.  Nice to make with kids, as well.

This is the perfect "quick" dessert - not too sweet or too heavy, the perfect thing to have on hand to go with after dinner coffee or tea, or for a late night snack.  A teaspoon of lemon extract adds nice extra flavor.  Definitely a keeper.

Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!  These are wonderful!  Great light cookie full of flavor.  I added a tsp of almond extract to give it a small extra kick.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was very good. Because it was so crumbly I wasn’t able to prick it... the shortbread “dust” obscured any pricking attempt. Tasted outstanding. I’m thinking of trying it again with a bit less flour.

The shortbread was delicious, but I had to experiment with the baking time, since it wasn't given in the recipe. I found 35 minutes at 350 degrees was ideal.

I doubled the recipe despite what reviews said. And instead of making round cookies I made them into small balls and put them in a mini muffin pan and pressed them down with my thumb. These came out perfect. I was able to get 40+ cookies out of a double batch.  My new go-to shortbread recipe!!!

Wow! I always assumed shortbread was difficult to make, probably because it's so difficult to find GOOD melt-in-your-mouth shortbread anywhere other than bakeries (so I don't have it very often, even though I LOVE shortbread), but this is by far the easiest cookie recipe I've ever made. Would've been nice if the recipe had included timing, but I just checked it regularly and it was done at about 25 minutes. I'm kind of upset that I never thought to look up the recipe before. I'll still be buying the local bakery's wonderful shortbread at Christmas because it's still the best shortbread I've ever had, but otherwise I'll be making my own from now on! (a note since I've seen others saying they're crumbly: I didn't find them crumbly at all, they came out just slightly crisp on the outside and soft in the middle - you have to make sure the dough is well combined so that it holds together or yes, they're going to be crumbly. I also cut them while they were still warm and soft, they became much crisper as they cooled and I imagine would've made a big mess if I'd cut them then)

I made these today, and they were good! Not quite as perfect at the Walker brand, but still good enough to fulfill a craving.  I did make up individual cookies instead of a whole pan. I baked at 325 degrees for the 30 minutes, but they got a teeny bit over-done, next time I'll kick it down to 300.

This is a good basic recipe but changes need to be made.  The order of operations is very important.  First, the butter should be cut into pats and placed in a medium size mixing bowl and left there until they are at room temperature.  Then cream the butter.  After that, add the sugar and cream butter and sugar together.  Last, gradually add the flour and keep mixing until thoroughly mixed.  You will probably have to use your hands for the last parts of mixing.   Place into the buttered tin and pat down and bake until lightly browned on top.  The shortbread came out about 1/2" thick and was delicious.

Delicious flavor for such a simple recipe!  Mine was a tad too crumbly, so I will press it harder down into the pan before baking next time.  I made it exactly as written, and guessed at the time - I baked too long, 35 -40 minutes- bottom was burned so I cut it off.  Next time I will press firmly into the pan, and pull out of the oven when the edges are golden, not brown!  Thanks for the easy delicious dessert!

Since coming upon this recipe a few days ago, I've made it twice! Super easy and so good!  The second time I added finely crushed pecan pieces and one teaspoon of vanilla and it still came out perfectly!  This will easily be a frequent addition to my baking routine!

So easy to make and they taste so similar to walkers and homemade shortbread I had in Scotland..absolutely love.

Didn't change the recipe at all, though I did pop the pan into the fridge for a few minutes before I put it in the oven because i was waiting for something else to come out of the oven.  So glad i found this recipe!!!

Made today and was blown away. They DO taste just like, if not better than, Walker's shortbread. I added a pinch of salt and mixed ingredients in a stand mixer until it resembled sugar cookie dough. I pressed into my dish and scored the dough into 12 equal servings then pricked with a fork. Like other reviewers, I baked at 300 for 30 minutes. As soon as they came out the oven, I sprinkled with a little sugar and cut into pieces. Once cooled, I heated my oven to 350. I removed the shortbread pieces and placed them on a cookie sheet. As soon as I put the pan in the oven, I turned the heat off. This allowed the cookies to get a nice even color and crunch. So yummy!

It's a simple recipe yet wonderfully delicious.  The key ingredient is the butter and I recommend using a European butter. I doubled the recipe and used one cup each of salted and unsalted butter.

I use this recipe with a press-in cookie sheet. The cookies come out like little tea cakes. Light and flavorful they make a welcomed addition to coffee and tea! Great for the holidays as well. I bake them for 11 minutes in the Wilton sheet.

So much like Walker's! My husband raved about the recipe, it is much better than the one I used before from this site, he just suggested to use a bigger baking form for next time to get it thinner - mine were quite thick this time. Thanks for sharing!

Very easy and delicious recipe. Tastes like everything I remember from my Scottish neighbors. In variations I have added 1/2tsp vanilla and 1/4tsp almond. I have also doubled the recipe, reduce temp to 300 and cook for 50 minutes. I will be making it this holiday season with preserves in it.

Perfect!!!!  You can't get a more simple, and more traditional shortbread than this!  Instead of putting it into a pie dish, though, I put it in an 8 x 8 square pan.  Much easier to cook!

So easy to make and tasty! My son and I both like thicker shortbread so this recipe was great for us. I baked in a glass 9x9 pan at 300 degrees and found that it needed to be in the oven for 45 minutes and the top was still not quite browned. But that didn't affect the wonderful taste!

I followed the recipe exactly and these make a really good lightly sweetened shortbread cookie. I thought they tasted even better the second day than when I ate them while they were still warm. I'm kind of a sugar fiend though, so next time I might try adding a little more sugar.

This recipe came out exactly as promised. Because the dough is so stiff, I turned it out onto a pastry cloth to work in the rest of the flour - much easier than trying to stir it in. What a treat to have homemade shortbread!

I made these for Christmas, and melted mint chocolate chips and drizzled over some, and repeated with milk and dark chocolate. The buttery flavored over ruled the milk chocolate, and the dark chocolate didn't complement the type of cookie well. I even added skor bits into some of the dough for skor-bit-short bread cookies- those ones where the biggest hit!! then the mint where the next fav. Only rating it a 4 b/c  they were not very fluffy or melt in the mouth for me but sturdy and buttery.

I didn't have white flour so I used whole wheat flour and it still came out delicious and buttery.  I baked it for about 15 minutes, but it was still kind of soft.  Next time I will bake it a little longer so it is crispier on the outside.  This recipe is definitley a keeper.

I thought it was delicious, and I love the soft texture! Replacing 1 TB of butter with applesauce added sweetness and made me feel less unhealthy. Wonder if more of a repalacement would work?

I thought this recipe excellent; I did add a little cinnamon to it though, just to make it a little different; I also replaced a small amount of the white sugar with a bit of brown sugar.  Lovely recipe! mjoint u.k.

Delivers what was promised! A delightful buttery shortbread cookie! Texture was not as "crumbly" as other shortbreads but the taste was fantastic! My husband, who is not usually a fan of shortbread couldn't keep his hands off! Will make again.

This shortbread is REALLY good and super rich! It was almost too easy to make (I kept thinking "this can't be it, I must be missing something" but sure enough, it came out lovely. I did like the other cooks suggested and let it cool completely before I cut it.

These turned out pretty good - lighter consistency than the shortbread that I am used to - perhaps because i let the butter come to room temperature?  Great buttery delicious flavor though and so simple to make.

This was wonderful!  How can you get simpler than three ingredients!  I only had an 8-inch pan so I had to keep an eye on it to keep it from burning as it took longer than the recommended time in the recipe.

Such a simple recipe that calls for what you readily have in the kitchen! Not too crumbly, with the perfect amount of butter. Make it fun, have the kids help mix the dough with their hands! I baked it at 300 degrees for about 35 minutes in a glass pie pan.

Excellent no fail recipe! So simple a child could make this (providing of course there is an adult to handle the oven). Sweet, melts in your mouth, not too buttery, not too sweet. Just perfect little bits of perfections perfecting with every superific bite.

Perfect shortbread. My tip is to check on it every few minutes while it's in the oven-- I think it ended up taking about 20 minutes to bake. Quick, easy, and delicious.

I added a bit of salt, and vanilla ('cus I'm not Irish, so tradition be damned!), baked them in my cast iron pan and these came out great! I'll make these again.

Unemployed, flat broke, and not much around the kitchen to bake with. Well I always loved shortbread and as it happens even I was able to scrape up the ingredients for this one. The one change I was forced to make was 1/2 cup of butter and 1/4 margarine as I only had one stick of butter left. I watched them like a hawk since the directions didn’t really give a baking time. I waited until the edges just started turning golden then pulled them out, cut up into 8 pieces and sprinkled with sugar on top. YUMMY! I don’t drink coffee or tea, so I had a few with a nice hot cup of hot chocolate. I will certainly make them again.

Delicious.  Just 3 ingredients - doesn't get easier than that.  I let mine cool before cutting and had no problem.

Delicious!  Who knew shortbread was so easy to make?  Tasted just like Walker's to me, but fresher!

Very easy to make and very good.  They are only crumbly while still hot.
