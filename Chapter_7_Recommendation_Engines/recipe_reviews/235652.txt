This is A CRANBERRY LOVER'S DREAM!  I had never used cornmeal in a cookie recipe before so I was curious as to how it would taste.  The cookie was so delicate and with the burst of cranberry filling it was just divine!  My only change was to sprinkle the finished cookie with confectioner's sugar.  Larkspur, you really out did yourself on this one!  Thanks for sharing!

Changed nothing! Totally genius to sub corn meal for usual hazel nut in linzer tortes. The cranberry filling is delicious and tart, or you could use the traditional raspberry jam filling, a bit sweeter and also delicious.Great recipe!

I pressed the dough into mini cupcake pans, then put in a scoop of the cranberry filling.  Delicious!  I had to make some plain dough cookies because there wasn't enough of the cranberry filling.  I might try stuffing the cavities with a mix of cranberry sauce and whipped cream on  Christmas Eve!  Love the recipe!

My daughter-in-law loves these type of cookies so we made one batch together. We should have doubled it as these were yummy! We used seedless raspberry jam (microwave for 15 seconds before spreading on the cookie). Don't bake until brown but follow the recipe! Came out perfect, not too sweet. We forgot to "finish" them with powdered sugar but will next time I make these for my family.

These are a good choice for your holiday cookie tray. They are very pretty and the cranberry filling is spot on. The texture, using cornmeal, is different but OK. I like that these are unusual. Make sure to chill the dough very well. It is workable when really cold but a mess otherwise.

These cookies are delightful, I am so pleased with them! I was drawn to the use of cornmeal because I love cornbread/muffins with jam. Note that one hour is NOT enough time to chill the dough. I tried rolling out after one hour and ended up with a horrific, gooey mess. I wrapped the dough back up and refrigerated over night, then worked in small batches as another reviewer suggested. I made a double batch and worked in quarters of that (so halves of a single batch). This was my first foray into Linzer cookies and I gave them away as gifts; my friends loved them and they were oh so pretty wrapped up in parchment. I did make the delicious cranberry filling (also a double batch) and probably used a little too much on each cookie because I ran out toward the end. The double recipe yielded about 30 cookie sandwiches (3” diameter). I also used gluten free flour (Cup 4 Cup) and it worked perfectly. Highly recommend.

These are delicious!  The flavor of the cranberry filling compliments the sweetness of the cookie.  I found that the dough is easy to work with when it is COLD.  So I worked in small batches and kept everything cold.

Success!! Great dough to work with & the filling was easy to make. I’ve always loved linzer tarts, but never made them due to the almond nuts. (My son has nut allergies.). These were fun to make, had a beautiful presentation & tasted delicious!! My only issue was I was a little shfilling(maybe I overfilled the cookies). Really not a problem because I just used jams from the fridge for the last few. I made them for ??Thanksgiving & will definitely make them for Christmas

I made these last Christmas and will again this year.  It is not a overly sweet cookie, which is a nice change this time of year. The blend of flavors is perfect.  Made the recipe exactly as written and received rave reviews from everyone at our annual party.
Sidenote: Using a 2" linzer cookie cutter, with dough rolled 1/8" thick,  I got exactly 30 complete cookies with one teaspoon of filling in each.

These were incredible!  My kids loved them. I honestly thought they were going to be another     cranberry cookie I got to eat all by myself, but I was lucky to get some.  That's a good thing too .
