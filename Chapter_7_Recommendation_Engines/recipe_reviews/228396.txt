I made this today. Family LOVED it. Did adjust slightly. Daughter not a fan of bell pepper so used chopped green onion. Added some minced garlic. Didn't have time to strain cucumbers for 4 hours so after slicing them I sprinkled them with salt instead of adding it to the dressing and set the colander in the sink. Them tamped them dry before adding to dressing. Cucumbers drained well in 1/2 hour. Used prestrained Greek yogurt and omitted sour cream. Delicious, and ready in 1 1/2 hours.

This was delicious, but I think there's an error in the salt measurement. I put in only 1 tsp, and even with the salt reduced this much, the result actually tasted of salt, which dulled the brightness that I associate with cucumber salad. Next time, I'll cut that in half.

I also added about a half of a mild, medium white onion, sliced very thin.

With these changes, I'll definitely make this my go-to cucumber salad!

I followed the recipe precisely and it came out extremely bitter. I am not sure what I could have done to correct that problem

I didn't make changes except to use  lite sour cream.  I didn't think it had much taste, also put in fresh dill.

This was the best cucumber salad I've ever made!  I did add some of my preserved lemons to the mix, but wholly cow, the dressing made those cukes dance!

I made this recipe today for a family event. However, I did not let anything sit for even an hour. I added the greek yogurt and sour cream and all of the other items listed here and mixed them all right away. I added more vinegar than stated, because I felt it was a bit to yogurt tasting and thick. I also added lemon juice and onion and garlic powder. I also cut up tomatoes and added them. I may add more salt as I find this to still be a bit bland when I put it in the fridge to cool.
