Great recipe!  The cookie portion was easier to work with after I left it in the fridge for a while.  I let it bake on parchment paper and it was done in exactly fifteen minutes.  I'm not crazy about coffee fillings so I used one from another chocolate torte recipe that's absolutely fabulous: 1 c. heavy whipping cream, 1 (8 oz.) pkg. cream cheese, 2/3 c. dark brown sugar, and 1 tsp. vanilla extract.  In a large bowl, combine softened cream cheese, dk. brown sugar and vanilla.  Beat until soft.  In a separate chilled bowl whip cream to form soft peaks. Then fold into cream cheese mixture.  It's hard to resist a chocolate torte!

I don't think this needs nearly as much coffee as called for. Otherwise very good.
