I selfishly admit that I never bothered with anything other than canned cranberry sauce for the simple reason that I don't like it. But this year I decided to make it myself as something a little special for my husband. He loved it and so did my mom! (Others at the table didn't even try it as they just don't like cranberry sauce either!) I used half orange juice and half water, and because so many reviewers commented that it was a little on the watery side I boiled it for 15 minutes to thicken it.  What I found, however, was that once it cooled it really thickened, so 15 minutes was a little too long. My guess is that boiling this for 10 minutes would be just right. This is a beautiful sauce, jewel toned, definitely fresh looking, fresh tasting, and delicious. Best of all, my husband appreciated the extra effort. It was such a snap to put together I now wonder why I never made it until now. I will never buy canned again.

I gave this recipe 4 stars. I used 1/2 cup orange juice and 2/3 cup water for boiling. I also boiled for about 5 minutes then simmered for 15 to reduce the sauce. It has thickened nicely in the fridge and it tastes divine. The perfect combination of sweet and then tart. I love the way the flavors explode on my tongue with the tart follwing the sweet. This will be served again.

I made this for my family at Thanksgiving.  It was good, but I found that about 3/4 cup of both sugars was better as the 1/2 cup was quite tart.  Will use again for Christmas!

This is so simple to make.  I used OJ instead of water, as suggested by others, but cut the amount by 1/4 c.  Also threw in a handful of dried cherries and a chopped apple.  Yum!

I made a from-scratch Christmas dinner, and used this recipe.  It was a complete hit, and all my guests thought I slaved over it.  It was so tasty and so easy, I'm now adding it to my recipe box for next Christmas.  Thanks!

Terrific! First time I've tried cranberry sauce. So easy and the brown sugar makes all the difference. For a variation, I threw in some pomegranate seeds too!

This was the easiest most impressive dish I have ever served. I made the sauce using 3/4 cup of each of the sugars. I placed chicken breasts in a baking dish and pour the sauce over it. Baked 1 hour @ 350 degrees.  Delicious. (works very well with pork also).

Simple to prepare. I won't go back to the canned stuff ever again. Replaced some of the water with orange juice because I like that combination.

This cranberry lover prefers cranberries that are tart and not too sweet. I would use the 1/2 c. white sugar only. The brown sugar overpowered the cranberry flavor, and made the dish too sweet. Neither do I like the brown sugar taste mixed with the cranberry taste.

This is a good recipe--not too sweet, and I like the combo of white & brown sugar. I always cook my cranberries until they pop & the sauce thickens, so that takes far longer than 5 minutes. I thought the sauce tasted a little acidic, so I added a teaspoon of vanilla, and that made all the difference for me.

Simple and easy!   I boiled for longer than 5 minutes until it looked thicker.  I also used the suggestion of using 3/4 cup of both brown and white sugar each which worked well.

Perfect!  The brown sugar really makes this nice.  I took the advice of a couple of the review and added a pinch of pumpkin pie spice, substituted 1 cup of orange juice for the water, cut out a 1/4 cup of sugar (since the O.J. is sweet) and let it simmer for additional 15 minutes to thicken.  I've burned my mouth since I can't wait for it cool it's so good!

Excellent! Made this for Thanksgiving and it turned out perfect.  Only thing different I did use half orange juice for the liquid and it set perfect.  Lots of great comments from guests too.  Will make again!

I've never made cranberry sauce before. I found this recipe to be easy and quite yummy.  It was a bit more watery than I would like so next time I make this I will be following the recommendations on the other posts to simmer it for awhile after boiling it for 5 minutes.

My sister made this at Thanksgiving and I loved it so much I had to do it for Christmas.  I added OJ like other reviewers suggested, but forgot I was going to until after I'd already added the full amount of water.  So I just simmered longer to reduce the liquid.  Made it a day ahead and it was delicious today!

This recipe was great with a few changes! I know some people like to use orange juice instead of water, but I find that it makes it too citrusy. So, I made it with water, but I did cut an orange and squeeze in some fresh juice. Also, while the water and sugar were boiling, I threw in a cinnamon stick for some extra flavor. The flavors were amazing and everyone was asking me for the recipe!

This was very easy and good!  I used 3/4 c white sugar and 1/2 c brown.  I think I will use more white and less brown next time, but still very good!  I will also use OJ next time, but none in the house at the moment.  Will make again!

Wow! How easy can it get? By reducing the water to 1 cup, the sauce thickened and jelled perfectly, so no need for cornstarch. Made a day ahead, the flavors can develop better, too. The sauce has a beautiful, jewel-like color that you just can't get from a can. I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because, as much as I love brown sugar, I think I'd prefer all white in this recipe. It does come out tart, so if you expect it to be as sweet as canned, add more sugar to taste as the sauce cools.

This is as good as any homemade cranberry recipe I have tried! I added 1 Tsp orange zest, but cut back on the water (1st time I made it was too thin.) The mixture of sugars does really well. Usually a little bit of cranberry sauce goes a long way, but this year there were no leftovers! Wow.

Based on another reviewer's recommendation, I squeezed juice from two oranges to get about a 1/2 cup of juice and used my potatoes peeler to scrape small bits of the orange peel into the mixture. the water was reduced to 2/3 since orange juice was added.  I also added a bit of pumkin pie spice since it is a combination of all the right spices. I wish I doubled the recipe.

This is really the very basic of cranberry sauce recipes. Like other reviewers, I use half the fluid as orange juice (fresh), but also (all the following by "taste") add the zest of the squeezed orange. I add a little cinnamon and ginger, and depending on the company, perhaps a jigger of bourbon (added while simmering the cranberry "plus" so that the aclohol boils off) or port. (I prefer the bourbon.) When kept in the fridge it is terrific days later!
Oh, I  always  use two bags of cranberry instead of one. As Jane Marple said, "I cannot resist my own cooking" (though others might!). Happy Holidays to all.

This turned out fantastic.  So delicious and fresh tasting too.  I used orange juice instead of water.  It wasn't too "orangy" - just had a freshness to it I don't think it would have had with just water.  I'll never buy the jarred kind again!

First time I made this I reduced the sugar but that was a mistake It was too tart, and I don't even like super-sweet things. To make this healthier, you can sub the sugars for granulated Splenda (1/2 cup, just like in the recipe) and Splenda Brown Sugar Blend (reduce to 1/4 cup, since Splenda Brown Sugar Blend is used in half the dose of regular brown sugar). No one could tell I'd subbed the sugars at all. This is incredibly quick and easy to make and gives a lovely thick-sauce consistency and authentic flavor. 

I make this often to go with the Winter Chicken Bake from this website, which calls for cranberries but doesn't taste like much with just plain old berries, and the store-bought cranberry sauce is packed with sugars and other nonsense. :-) Hope this helps.

Edit 12/2019: I now use 1/2 cup Swerve Brown Sugar and 1/2 regular Swerve and no-one can tell these are sugar subs. Delicious. I make this year-round.

Very good! Not too sweet or too tart, very balanced. Used half orange juice and half water and boiled about 10 minutes per other reviewers.

This is the best recipe for cranberry sauce I've found.  I usually reduce the water to 1c and cook slightly longer because I like mine thicker.  Sometimes I use part OJ or add cinnamon, or both.  My family loves this side dish...I use it as sandwich spread for turkey.  It freezes well in little containers so you can have it all year (cranberries disappear in the northeast after the holidays...)

This recipe is great!  My first attempt at cranberry sauce and I am so pleased.  I also changed a few things, however...
1. Used 1/2 C. freshly squeezed OJ for 1/2 C of the water
2. Added the zest from one orange (the orange I used to squeeze the OJ)
3. Cooked longer than the 5 minutes recommended, about 10 min, for all the berries to "pop" and make it a little saucier and less chunky.
These changes gave me a sweet, not too sweet, orange infused cranberry sauce that I will happily refer to from this Thanksgiving on!  Thank you for this recipe!  :)

This was delicious, but missed five stars because of the excess water in the recipe. I will reduce water to 1 cup and it should be perfect! This will be the recipe I use.

I gotta admit to being skeptical since I don't like canned cranberry sauce.  Neither does my sister in law, but we both loved this stuff.  It was so easy to make and I will make it every year during the holidays.  The only thing is that it is a bit runny.  I think it would be great spread for a left over turkey sandwich too.

This was the best cranberry sauce ever! I will not buy the can again. I replaced half of the water with OJ, used the same amount of both sugars, boiled for 5 min and then simmered for 15 minutes to get it a little thicker. I let it cool at room temp and it was perfect. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

This is so DELISH! I used the amount of water called for in the recipe, but added a few scoops of frozen orange juice concentrate to the pot. I made this with Splenda granulated sugar and Splenda brown sugar and it turned out wonderfully! I have only tasted it from the cooled pot and love the flavor. I can't wait to see how it is with my Turkey dinner! My husband, who doesn't like cranberries, even said it was really good! I think this sauce would be terrific over a piece of angel food cake with whipped topping! :) Yumm! My only advice is to watch the pot! Mine bubbled over and made a huge, sticky mess- totally my fault!

Excellent. I also added pumpkin spice and a splash of orange juice. I have found that the trick to get it really thick (cut it with a knife thick!)is to let it cool completely at room temperature. I have put my sauce in the fridge too soon, only to end up with runny sauce. It seems counter intuitive, but it works!

Wonderful! I made a few changes. I used about 1 cup of Tropicana Pomegranate Blueberry juice along with 1/2 cup of water. Then, I cut the white sugar in half, and used the full amount of brown sugar. Then, I added just a splash of orange juice and a dash of cinnamon. Wow, is it good!!

I made this last year and I am making it again! I do not scrape the foam and I add some fresh orange zest for a twist. I also run this thru the blender once it has cooled a little to make it smoother as I am not a fan of chunky sauce - but that is just a personal thing, the recipe is awesome!

My grandmother, who loves homemade sauce but never makes it because she's alone, absolutely loved this.  It was really fresh and tasty, not too tart either (according to those who ate it, I'm not a fan, I made it for everyone else).  Super easy to make, I am impressed.

Didn't use brown sugar, just 3/4 cup white.  Boiled water, sugar, pinch of salt and berries for 5 minutes then simmered for 15 minutes.   We love the sauce this way !

This is on the tarter side, which is okay with me.  I used this on waffles, on cube steak, would be great on chicken or turkey, too. Was super easy, followed the directions except used coconut sugar in place of the brown sugar.

I add a little cinnamon, vanilla, ginger, and nutmeg, I also don't use as much sugar, but otherwise the recipe is great! It is super easy to make and is relatively quick.  I have been making it for at least three years, every Thanksgiving. I am quadrupling the recipe, there is never enough left over!

The combination of brown and white sugar is interesting but not that impressive.  I would halve the amount of water in this recipe.  Maybe that is why it is called, "Washed Cranberry Sauce"   A little too thin for our taste.

This is a great starter recipe but I have used some reviewers tips about replacing the water with OJ and adding a diced apple, 1/2 cup sultana raisins  with the cranberries and using 3/4 cups brown sugar instead of 1/2cup (hubby likes a sweet sauce). Cooked it for  8min because we like a sauce that is a bit thicker.

Delicious.  I prefer this over cooking it into a thick mono-textured sauce, though I like that too.  The berries retain their shape and make a thin sweet sauce for them to swim in.  Tart and good.  I'll definitely be eating cranberries more often!

Overall a good recipe. I agree with the fact that you need to add more sugar to the recipe. I also did 2 parts OJ and 1 part water.  Tastes good to me.

I think it is great as is, except I boiled for 10 minutes instead of 5. Just plain yummy and easy :)

Great Recipe.  Used apple juice instead of water (I would have used OJ but didn't have any) and I added some cut up oranges.  It came out really yummy.  The only thing was that it was a little runny, next time I'll drain off a little bit of the sauce.

I made this sauce about 2 years ago and quickly discovered it's a shame I can't get Ocean Spray berries year-round.  I buy a case each year and hope they make it through all the family requests....

I made this the day before thanksgiving. It was good on leftover turkey sandwiches, but alone, it could definitely be sweeter. Too tart for my taste. I subbed 1/2 cup water for orange juice as suggested. I was hoping it would be just like my grandfathers recipe he used to make, which has now been lost. Needless to say, I was disappointed, as was everyone else :(

This sauce is excellent and was much easier to make than I thought it would be. I did add pumpkin pie spice as several others suggested. I used part apple juice since I didn't have orange on hand. I cooked until it thickened to a jam like consistency. It was wonderful. The only problem for me is that our large family are not big cranberry eaters, so there was still some left over. Hubby isn't big on cranberries but continued eating it that week on any poultry he could get. It would probably freeze, but I didn't bother. I think next Thanksgiving I will cut the recipe down some.

Good if you want a basic tart sauce. It's better if you make it with the OJ, ginger, cinnamon and sugar... with those additions it's AMAZINGLY delicious!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving, as the husband loves "real" cranberry sauce.  I followed the recipe exactly, and was impressed with the appearance and texture.  The husband ultimately gave it four stars....thought it could have been a bit sweeter.  I'll probably use 1/2 C more white sugar next time.

Much better than canned! This recipe saved Thanksgiving when we forgot to buy canned sauce.  Now I'll deliberately skip the processed stuff.

This was perfect for Thanksgiving.  I doubled the recipe and used half water and half OJ.  Important to skim all of the foam off, which is easy enough to do when it's boiling.  Will definitely make again, it's delicious!

A perfect recipe for cranberry sauce. The color was divine, the balance of tart and sweet was heavenly. I added a 1/2 cup of OJ and a generous splash of Grand Marnier to mine. 

My mother (who lives right next door) made hers w/o the OJ and GM and I preferred hers over mine, but mine was fabulous so it was a close call. Five stars all around. No excuse to eat it from a can. Fresh is best and so easy.

It's a terrific recipe, but I agree that there's too much water and it should include the caveat that it's best served chilled. but thanks - at least one person didn't believe i'd made it myself but the dirty pot was right there on the stove, so...

This recipe is great... we just made a double batch in anticipation of Thanksgiving.  Followed quantities exactly, but boiled for about 15 minutes and mixed 1 tsp cornstarch with 2 tablespoons water and added it right at the end.  Perfect consistency.  We will definitely make it again!!

I've made this a few years in a row now, and it always works out well.  I normally use splenda for baking instead of sugar and add cinammon, nutmeg, and ginger.  Works well as a side, heating & served over french toast, or even as a spread in a sandwich.  Thanks Michelle!

Very good and so simple.  I used orange juice instead of water, added a little extra  brown sugar, and blended the lumps out for the kids.  I think it would taste good as a frozen treat too.

The recipe was incredibly easy to make! It was a bit on the tart side for my liking, but with a bit more sugar it would probably be perfect.

This was the first time in 8 years that I had to cook my own Thanksgiving dinner and my husband insisted on home made cranberry sauce.  His particular palette was very pleased with this recipe.  I doubled the recipe and as others have done - substituted orange juice for part of the water.  I cooked it for at least 15 minutes until it reached a desired thickness.  Also had to add an additional 1/2 cup of sugar (1/4 cup for single recipe) to get it slightly sweet.  We loved it and will continue using this recipe.

Yum!  This is my first time making cranberry sauce.  I can't believe how easy it was.  I also used 1 cup of pulpy orange juice and got back a bit on the white sugar.  I didn't have any pumpkin pie spice but I did have some apple pie spice on hand and added a couple of dashes.  After boiling for 5 minutes I simmered for 15 more.  Be sure to still often...the sugars will scorch if you don't. I can't wait until tomorrow to eat!!!

Five stars for simplicity and taste combined.  Followed recipe exactly.  Served in the pot after about half hour of cooling at room temperature.  Rave reviews and plenty eaten up...including some eaten on its own out of the pot :-p  Still some leftovers from 6-person Thanksgiving dinner (me being Canadian, Thanksgiving's a month earlier).  Fresh cranberries should be available at your local market around Thanksgiving - now I understand why cranberry sauce is traditional with turkey, it's seasonal, so maybe it goes back very long ago.

I really liked the taste a lot! Next time I will use a little less water because I like my sauce thicker.  I added some walnuts to give it a little crunch.  I never realized making cranberry sauce was so easy!
