1.13.20  ... I heard of, but hadn't had or know what redeye gravy was, but now I do & I'm quite happy about it.  :D  'Pretty cool when magic happens with something simple.  It doesn't taste like salty coffee;  nothing like white or traditional gravy; a different kind of good.  Thanks!

I am not familiar with redeye gravy so I have nothing to compare this recipe to. It did have a reddish tint to it when you dumped in the coffee but I think it was mostly from the bits that came off of the ham. That part sinks to the bottom of the pan when you are trying to dish it out and the butter takes over. It is thin and as I said, hard to spoon out over the biscuits. The recipe didn't call for flour. Maybe it's not supposed to be in there but me and the hubs both agreed that thickening it up would have been better. The way it was you were just basically watering down and sogging up the biscuits.  The flavor was good so I plan on trying this one again but I'm adding flour to the drippings next time.
