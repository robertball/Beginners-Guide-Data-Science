The first time I made them I followed the recipe the way it is. But as I was adding the ingredients, I realized how much sodium and fat would be in it. The texture turned out way too hard and all you could taste was bread crumbs, I think that 2 cups of bread crumbs is too much. 
However, I still had a feeling this recipe could be good, so today I made several changes: 1 whole egg + 2 egg whites, fat free cottage cheese, 1/4 cup of 2% cheddar + 1/2 cup parmesan, 2 minced garlic cloves, onion, spices and 1 cup of bread crumbs.
For the sauce: I reduced apricot jam to 1/3 cup, ketchup to 1/3 cup as well, and didn't add any oil just sprayed some Smart Balance before baking. I think that the key was to add less bread crumbs, you really don't need more than 1 cup. It turned out fantastic! I would have never imagined this combination of flavors would be soo good!

Great, delicious recipe!  What a wonderful way to have meatballs again.  The only advice I have with it is to make sure the pecans are FINELY ground.  I left ours a little big and they added an unnecessarily crunchy quality to them-- but they still tasted great!

Even though these are vegetarian, they seemed overly high in calories and fat.  I pulled out all the stops in order to try to reduce both.  Instead of 4 whole eggs, I added 1 cup of egg substitute (like Eggbeaters).  I also used fat-free cheddar cheese and non-fat cottage cheese.  I used 1/2 nuts instead of the full 1 cup (I had cashews and almonds on-hand) and finally I used panko bread crumbs instead of regular bread crumbs.  Things I added include: 1 tsp Italian herb mix, 2 carrots and 2 stalks of celery minced in a food processor, and 1/4 cup vital wheat gluten.  For the sauce I completely omitted the oil and used sugar-free apricot spread.  This made about 16 large balls.  The flavor was actually very good and I've already made this recipe this way a couple of times.  Even my non-dieting and non-vegetarian boyfriend liked them.  The only slight issue with them may be the texture (they come out of the oven a little soft). When left in the fridge overnight they actually firm up quite a bit and are perfect.  I think one could also throw the batter into a loaf pan and make a "meat"loaf out of this.  According to my (rough) calculations, each meatball has only about 120 calories and very little fat.

I noticed that some reviewers said their meatballs came out mushy and wanted to say it is VERY important that you DO NOT use fresh bread crumbs as that is whats causing them to be mushy. I hope this helps I would hate for anyone to miss out on this recipe it is really awesome!

This is a great recipe.  The second time I made it, I rolled the balls smaller than called for, and it really altered the flavor because the sauce ratio was different.  I prefer the larger size.  I like these so much, I have been caught eating these cold from the refrigerator! ***I have made these numerous times since my original review and I have made an alteration in the recipe. I use 1 1/4 cups dry bread crumbs and 3/4 cup of fresh bread crumbs. I think the texture is better as they aren't quite so firm. They still hold up well in sauces. Great for making subs too!

These were okay.  The sage in them makes them taste too much like Turkey stuffing.  If I was to make them again I would not use sage, but I would use more italian spices like oregano, thyme, and basil and lost of garlic.
They were very easy to make, baked well, but the stuffing taste was something we didn't enjoy too much.

These were delicious, exceptionally so the next day.  I followed the recipe exactly except I made my own whole wheat bread crumbs and added some Italian seasoning with them.  They freeze great and are fantastic when reheated.  I just made 10 times the recipe for my daughter's wedding reception, per her request, froze them ahead of time, reheated them in the Nesco, and got at least 20 requests for the recipe.  This is the best vegetarian recipe I've found in some time.

This was really good.  I selected this recipe today because I have been looking for meaty dishes without soy.  I followed the recipe step by step up until the baking.  I baked mine longer than what the recipe called for. (my total cooking time was 1 hour)  I didnt realize that the balls would firm up a bit more AFTER cooking, so my 'meaty'-balls became a little hard.  I dont know, they just seemed too soft at 40 minutes.  But even when hard, they were good.  My mother enjoyed the flavor of the sauce.
  
Also, I cooked one of the 'meaty'-balls plain(without the sauce)it was wonderful.  I ate that one after cooking 40 minutes.  I guess that one seemed right(more done) because it was dryer than the ones with the sauce.  I will use this recipe when making spagetti from now on. (bake them and then just throw them in the spagetti sauce.

Lastly, I dont know who well they freeze, but I'm gonna try.

I love these meatballs! Christmas wouldn't be Christmas without them. I thought I reviewed them last year but I guess I didn't. I make them "Swedish Meatballs" by adding a little nutmeg to the mix, and baking them with a can of mushroom soup poured over the top. YUMM!!

The best way to make this recipe is to chop the ingredients super fine.  You don't want chunks of anything in the mixture.  For cheddar cheese- 4 ounces: use a super fine grater.  Cottage cheese, onions, & pecans use a (Pampered Chef) food chopper and chop, chop away. (I give each batch that I put under the chopper 32 chops.)  Omit sage but add 1tsp. Italian seasoning & 1/2 tsp. garlic powder. I usually end up with a yield of 24-28 meatballs.

Cover a baking pan with foil.  Spray foil with cooking oil spray so meatballs don't stick.  Bake @350 degrees for 30 minutes flipping meatballs over halfway thru cooking time.

I've never used the sauce recipe because I use the "meatballs" for meatball subs on hoagie rolls with tomato sauce & topped with mozzarella cheese toasted in the toaster oven.  I've made this recipe probably a dozen times for my vegetarian daughter.  You won't be disappointed in this recipe.

Edible, but I don't think it's a keeper.  Had too much of a bready flavor, so if I were to do it again, I would probably cut down on the bread crumbs.  The sauce was really good though.  I think I will use that again with regular meatballs.  In spite of being vegetarian, DO NOT mistake this for being healthy.  I got 18 meatballs using a 2 tbsp scoop out of this recipe.  Once I added up JUST the caloric stuff, that worked out to 205 calories per meatball.  Yikes!  BTW:  this is the same recipe as Sweet and Sour Faux Meat Balls except for one less egg.

This was very good. I did use fresh bread crumbs but dried them in the oven prior to using them and it turned out just fine. I used low fat cottage and cheddar. Great recipe! I might decrease the sugar next time, just a question of preference... Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe gets five stars for the meatballs alone. So far, I have made this recipe twice & used it solely for the meatballs, not the sweet & sour sauce. The first time I made it I baked them in a marinara sauce instead for spaghetti. They were absolutely delicious! This last time I got a little "crazier". I only had ricotta handy and some deli slices of white cheddar. The food processor fixed my cheese issue (actually, I think I used too much because I paid less attention) and the ricotta actually worked really well also. I decided to try baking them with no sauce. I sprayed the baking dish really well with cooking spray and covered them with foil to keep from drying out. They turned out perfect and tasted awesome without any sauce at all. I think my favorite use for them was "Swedish Meatball" style with some leftover gravy that I had in my fridge & thrown over egg noodles! This recipe is a major keeper!!

I've experimented with a LOT of vegetarian meatball recipes over the years to satisfy everyone in our family (meat & nonmeat eaters), and without question, this recipe is the best.  The sauce was a bit sweet so next time I will probably use tomato or cream sauce.  Otherwise outstanding. Thanks!

Can I give this a 10 star rating?  We love these and you could never tell there isn't meat.  I do use all lower calorie ingredients like Egg Beaters, reduced fat cheeses, less oil, and sugar free jam and they are still awesome.  Thank you for this recipe.

made these with 1 1/2 cup fresh bread crumbs, 1/4cup oatmeal, 1/4 cup TVP, 1/2 cup black bean flour. deleted cottage cheese. Added fresh flat leaf parsley (handful), 2 garlic cloves, 1/2cup carrots, jar of butternut squash organic babyfood (1/4 cup puree of any other squash or sweet potato would work too), and pulsed in the food processor. I like to slip veggies into everything! I baked without sauce for 10 min on 425, in a greased pan to seal the "meatballs" and then flipped and repeated. I voiced uncovered for 25 min. Covered with tinfoil and cooked another 20 min. They were so moist, delicious and "meaty" The kids even asked for seconds. Made enough for another dinner, lunch, or dare I say a wrap or sandwich! Yum! Thanks for the wonderful idea. I also made the sauce with tomato sauce and brown sugar, skipped the jam (just added more brown sugar to taste).

I made this recipe for my daughter's birthday party (mostly carnivores were there) and no one noticed they didn't contain meat!!!!  I had one guest ask me for the recipe and when I gave it to her she was shocked to see there is no meat in them!  I used apricot pineapple jam for the sauce and added a little more onion than recommended.  I have found a family favorite, thank you so much!

These are absolutely the best ever. I have only ever made these the "italian" way with red sauce, so i have never made the sweet and sour sauce. but the meatballs are just so delicious. Since getting this in my all recipe email, i must have made them at least half a dozen times. i add all the normal italian spices, use seasoned bread crumbs, whatever nuts i have on hand (they all work fine it seems) and seasoned bread crumbs. i omit the salt because the breadcrumbs are so salty as it is. so great!!!

These meatballs were SO good! We loved them. I used regular bread crumbs so the batter was mushy so I added some more bread crumbs and a little crushed cornflakes. I couldn't find sage anywhere so I just left it out. I didn't have dried basil so I added fresh. I will definitely make again but I want to see if I can make this recipe lower fat as it has a TONS of calories/fat, etc. Anyway, will try with egg beater the next time to see if it comes out just as good. Will update that too. The sauce was good but I made it in on the stove. I made half and it was still too much. It was okay, will add less ketchup next time as I didn't read the reviews where it said to reduce, oh well, next time!

These are so delicious, and so easy to make. I
followed the recipe to a tee other than reducing the
ketchup to 3/4 cup (as others suggested), and
omitting the sage (seemed out of place). I served
them to my 83 year old dad, and he never knew
they were meatless! Next time I will double the
sauce and serve them over rice. Five stars and
highly recommended.

These are amazing! The first time I made them I followed the recipe, but now I use them to finish up veggies, beans, nuts, cheeses, or other leftover foods. I'm convinced that you can't mess these up!

I doubled the'veggie meatballs' (used 2 cups bread crumbs) Beacuse of the reviews. They are great 5+ stars; However the sweet & sour sauce was just okay. Out of 6 people only 2 liked it.  I was sure glad I didn't cover them all with the sauce. The sauce needs something- might try adding a little brown sugar & Soy sauce. I will make dipping sauces next time and let everyone play around and find the right combo for themselves.

These are very good.  You would not immediately know they don't have any meat in them.  I halved the recipe for the balls and the sauce, and it made 15 appetizer sized balls and plenty of sauce to bake them in a little of it and toss them around in it after they were cooked.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I did add some more spices ... black pepper, salt and garlic powder.  My advice would be to grind up the nuts as fine as you can and mince the onion. I used Italian bread crumbs and did not find any issues with hardness or dryness.  Do not hard pack the balls, just loosely roll them into balls with only enough pressure to hold them together.  I will make these again, even meat eaters would like these.

The meatballs came out perfect with great texture! The sauce was nice too although I opted to up the "dash" of hot pepper to make it a little spicier. Next time I might try these with a more traditional red sauce as they would go much better with pasta, but all in all, a fun and tasty recipe!

There isn’t much food that I dislike but I think sweet and sour sauce just may be one of them.  The “meat”balls themselves were very good.  I just did not care for the sauce.   I used only ½ cup of nuts to try and cut back on the fat content of this recipe.  I also used one whole egg and four egg whites instead of the four eggs called for in this recipe.  When mixing the ingredients I felt that one cup of bread crumbs was plenty, and I was right.  Much more than that and I think they would have turned out hard.  I have been using a similar recipe to this for years, however, my recipe does not call for the spices this recipe did.  They lend a nice touch.  Great recipe.

AWESOME!!!!! RAVE REVIEWS!!!!
No substitutions on this one!
I made them for a bridal shower for a vegetarian bride. The guest couldn't belive there wasn't any meat used! They are quite easy to make, a little messy but tolerable. They are so savory too. Will make these many more times even for the carnivores!

I really really loved this recipe! I altered it a little because I thought I had all the ingredients. Once I started I realized I didn't so I improvised! Instead of cottage cheese, I used feta cheese. I used mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar and I used almonds instead of pecans. I also added chopped garlic and Cavendar's seasoning. I didn't end up making the sauce because I wanted to use this for spaghetti. It was REALLY GOOD!!! I was looking for something to add to my spaghetti b/c sauce and noodles get old. This does the trick!!!!! I also froze my leftovers.

These are delicious! I was somewhat dissapointed with them the night that I made them, thinking that they were a little too dry, but like others said, they are FABULOUS the next morning! I loved the "meatballs" so much that I attempted to make them without the sauce the next time, and they came out horrific. If anyone knows how to make these with a tomato-based sauce, please let me know.

My 14 year old daughter recently became a vegetarian.  This recipe is her current favorite.  She would eat these meatballs everyday if I would let her.  I made these for Easter and everyone liked them.

I used the veggie-ball part of the recipe a few times, cooking them in Cream of Mushroom for a Swedish-Meatball type of recipe. Delicious. I tried it with the sweet and sour sauce for the first time yesterday and my husband and I LOVED it! We had orange marmelade on hand, so we used that instead of the apricot jam. We eliminated the salt because we had bought pre-made seasoned bread crumbs which already had a lot of salt in it. Delicious! We served it with plain egg noodles, which were good with the sauce as well. I think we'll make it next time we have friends over! YUM!

These are incredibly tasty.  There are a few changes I made.    I used 1 cup ground almonds (pecan allergy), added an extra egg, and nixed the sage.  I only give it four stars because the sauce was very thick and there wasn't much of it, even though I covered the pan in the oven.  Next time, I will double the sauce, add water, and bake it longer.

WARNING: THIS RECIPE MAY FOOL MEATEATERS.
This is an awesome recipe. I tried it of the first time this weekend. My wife gave a sample some very nice family in the neighborhood. I received a call 1 hour later, "Loved the meatballs, the kids loved the meatballs but we are can't eat meat/milk together and dinner is milk based!! What was in those meatballs? ” I read the list of ingredients twice and promising them a copy of the recipe. Neighborhood harmony restored.

Feedback: I replaced basil and sage with mixed Italian seasoning, and replaced the pecans with walnuts. This worked out perfectly. I double all the ingredients and ended up with 35 meatballs (5 x 7 fits perfectly on a long baking tray).  
Next step: The same ingredients should make 83 1.5 inch diameter meatballs cooked for 30 minutes or 280 1 inch diameter meatballs cooked for 20 minutes (Feedback to follow).

My husband is always asking me to make this recipe. We've eaten it many times and it's always delicious. I've taken it to parties and can hear people saying how scrumptious it is and wondering what meat it is! When they find out that it's vegetarian, I love the look of complete surprise! The only changes to the recipe that I make are I use mixed nuts, whatever is on hand and I make more sauce, usually one and a half times (or even double) the stated recipe as it's so moreish. I serve the balls with either rice (my personal favourite), pasta or with mashed potatoes and a green veg. We'll be eating this for years to come :)

This is a VERY  forgiving recipe & tastes wonderful.  I live abroad & can't get cottage cheese, plus other cheeses are super expensive.  I usually have to reduce the cheese and replace the cottage cheese with whatever is handy -- cooked rice, quick oats, etc.  Then I moisten the mixture with milk & a splash of oil.  I'm sure veg chicken stock would work, as it's to help with binding.  Have added grated carrot & once even cut up some dried Chinese mushrooms that needed to be used.  Have tried both walnuts and peanuts and prefer the walnuts. The bread crumbs seem to really make the texture work (vs. more cooked rice).  I spice with whatever I have on hand.  As others suggested, make extra sauce.  We love these with BBQ sauce & they get better the longer they sit.  Leftovers are great in sandwiches.  YUM! [I realize that my version is not the exact recipe, but I'm sure I'm not the only reader needing to make substitutions due to availability of ingredients.]

These are ok. The sauce tastes a lot like McDonald's sweet and sour except that there is a strong vinegar and ketchup flavor. Not exactly what I was hoping for.

These are delicious!  I didn't have pecans, so I used sliced almonds that I pureed in my mini processor. I also ran out of bread crumbs so I subbed in seafood breader and I used hard italian cheese and mozzarella in lieu of the the shredded cheddar.  It was delicious!  The sauce is savory/sweet and smells heavenly.  These would be great with egg noodles.

EXCELLENT! I think that the key ingredient is abricot jam. It makes sauce more like a fruity ketchup than an asian sauce... so it come along well with the meatball ingredients. The only thing, I found the sauce a bit too sweet. So next time I will put less jam. Thanks for sharing this amazing recipe :)

These are wonderful! I made them for my grandsons and they loved them too - even the "pickey" eater! I used low fat and fat-free cheeses and it was fine. I didn't have sage, substituted marjoram for oregano. Next time I will try wheat germ or WW bread crumbs if I can find them, or one cup of Italian crumbs as another reviewer suggested. I think these meatless balls would also work well baked in tomato sauce and over pasta, or any sauce and base combo. Thanks for the great recipe!

These are in the oven now! I can't wait to try them! I didn't bake them in the sauce, I placed them on a cookie sheet and baked them, then I can freeze them and use in other things.  What I did is doubled the recipe, and used 6 eggs total, 2 cups of sharp cheddar and 1 cup of shredded parmesean, 1 1/2 cup of bread crumbs, no sage, and lastly I didn't have pecans, so I toasted almonds and ground in my food processor until fine, and used them instead.  Can't wait to try!

Disclaimer: I did alter the recipe a bit, but I think this gets 5 stars for the base recipe of the meatballs! (I haven't made the sweet and sour sauce yet, but it sounds just like what my mother used to make).

I used almonds instead of pecans and oyster crackers instead of bread crumbs.  I added cumin and a couple of diced radishes for spice.  I also deep-fried them to save time (8 minutes total cooking time).  Amazing!

They don't really taste much like meat, but they are delicious and will go well with all kinds of dishes depending on how you spice them.

I was honestly shocked at just how good these were!  And easy to make.  Only thing I did different was heed the advice of several who suggested less breadcrumbs - one and a half cups worked great.  Will make these often.

I made these without the sweet and sour sauce, and used them with regular spaghetti sauce. If you use italian bread crumbs, I wouldn't add the salt. These were a bit too salty for me, but they freeze well.

Pretty Good. I only made the "meatball" portion and cooked them in a different sauce.  I liked them but my kids only picked at them.   
Thanks for the ideas, if I take anything away from this....

Thank you for a great recipe!  I fixed this for my husband and two boys, all of whom are unabashed carnivores and none of whom will touch cottage cheese.  Second helpings were had even after seeing the ingredients list.  I did substitute one sleeve of crush Ritz crackers plus a teaspoon of Italian seasoning in place of the breadcrumbs because that's what I had on hand. I patted it into a silicone loaf pan rather than making meatballs and brushed the top with the sauce.  End result was wonderful.  Sauce was a little sweet so I will try swapping tomato sauce for the ketchup next time and halve the sauce recipe.  We had close about 3/4 cup left over.

I have a few vegetarian friends and I made this for one of their birthday parties. Even the non vegetarians didn't realize that these weren't made with meat. My vegetarian friends have since asked me to make these several times. Great recipe. Thank you.

I only made the meatball part and then used spaghetti sauce on top.  Yum!  These are delicious.  My skeptical husband even loved them.  My 10 and 8 year liked them too.  This recipe is a keeper.  I can't wait to try different sauces!

These are fantastic! Even my boyfriend, who doesn't care for most 'fake meat' meals, loves them. I used parsley instead of sage because its what I had on hand, but other than that I always stick to the recipe and they always turn out great! Good sauce to meat ratio as well. They are good on their own, or on a crusty hoagie roll for a filling meatball sandwich. My new favorite recipe!

Yum!!! I am currently working on cutting meat out of my diet, and trying new vegetarian recipes. This one is a keeper! Very tasty and easy to make. I left out the sage, because I didn't have any and they still tasted great. I also cut down on the breadcrumbs, the texture turned out fine. It's very hard to find vegetarian dishes that are satisfying, but this was was filling and yummy. Going to try it with marinara sauce next time!!

Thank you...now I have a recipe to use when my family is craving "meat"!  I didn't read all the reviews, but I agree that the breadcrumb amount needs to be cut, but I'll also increase the amount of nuts I use.  I used walnuts instead of pecans (good source of omega 3's since we don't eat any meat) and left some chunky to give the meatballs a contrasting crunch.  This recipe will go well with any sauce you decide to use with it.  Everyone enjoyed it, and I'm glad that we can have meatballs/meatloaf without having to use vegetarian mince.  Just a bit of advice to any new veggies out there....the only way these are vegetarian is if you use vegetarian cheddar cheese. (Cheese is made using rennet which comes from a calf's stomach).  Cottage cheese is always vegetarian.  :)

I knew right off that I couldn't stomach all that fat, so yes, I did alter. My rating is based on the recipe, with changes.  Used more onion, added cumin because I like it-a lot! Made a "hot" sweet and sour sauce, adding anaheim chili pepper and seeds. I used only 3 eggs, and 2 Tbsps powdered milk mixed with 2 Tbsps water for the 4th egg. I used 1/3 less fat monteray jack cheese, and light cottage cheese. Lastly, I substituted about 1/2 cup soy granuals for 1 cup of the breadcrumbs. I think I added a little water also, but check consistency and texture first. The balls should be somewhat firmer/denser than meat-type meatballs, but they should still be moist enough to yield under moderate thumb pressure. The balls will lose much of their density/firmness as the fat is cooked off into the sauce.

I have these meatballs in the oven right now - they smell so good!  I tasted the meatball and sauce mixtures as I was making them, and they are excellent.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I'm really excited about the other potential uses for a recipe like this...perhaps as a starting point for meatloaf or homemade veggie burgers?!  I also think these meatballs would be the perfect party food made ahead and kept warm in a crockpot with sauce - either sweet and sour or Italian tomato sauce.  They were easy to assemble, too.  I think next time I will make a triple batch and freeze them for quick suppers, just like the frozen meatballs from the grocery store, only sooooo much better.  My three-year old says we should eat them all before daddy comes home, LOL!!!!!!!

one of the best vegetarian meatballs recipes.  Should line pan with tin foil and/or add a little more water to sauce.  Also should remove meatballs right away as sauce hardens quickly.

These were OK.  They had a mushy texture.  I'm used to buying and eating "Nate's Italian Meatballs" (veggie frozen meatballs). Maybe I'll try a different combination/ratio of ingredients next time.  I didn't make the sauce - I just baked them in regular canned spaghetti sauce.

Didn't care for the sauce on these, it seemed to missing something.  I might try the meatballs in a pasta sauce next time.  I didn't think the sage seasoning in the meatballs went with with the sweet & sour sauce.

I used these "meatballs" for spaghetti and they were amazing. I baked them in a casserole dish without sauce for about 40 minutes. I can't wait to use the leftovers for "meatball" subs!

This is a recipe I have made tons of time.  It is also good with a tomato (marinara) sauce.  I have also made them into "sausage rolls" using the meatball mixture rolled in puff or filo pastry, just add some grated carrot or butternut squash.  It will make a pretty good burger as well.  Great recipe.

I was skeptical, but needed a change from our beans & rice/pasta/stir fry rut. These were wonderful! I used  sunflower  seeds instead  of nuts (allergy in the house).  Would  probably    double the sauce next time because we loved is so. I used less ketchup as per other reviewers.

The only change I made was to use whole wheat bread crumbs.  Maybe that was the problem???  I was so ready to love these, especially after reading so many good reviews.  BUT... the texture was terrible, so dense and hard to chew.  The flavor was okay, but overall this was a flop.  I'm tempted to try them again with white bread crumbs, but I'm also scared we wouldn't like them either way.

We enjoyed the meatballs, they were not mushy at all as some others posted.  They were firm and a very good consitance.  The taste was great!  Would make again.

The sauce was excellent.  I might recommend grating instead of mincing the onion though.  My husband doesn't like onion bits.  He also couldn't believe that there wasn't any meat in them!

Very rarely do I take the take to rate a recipe, but this one was extremely deserving.  These "meatballs" were excellent.  They had wonderful texture and flavor and the sweet and sour sauce was a extra flavor bonus.  I thought they were even better the next day after being the fridge for a night.  I will make these again for both meat eaters and non-meat eaters.  The only thing I did change was that I did not add sage as was suggested in some of the other reviews.  Excellent recipe!

I have never rated a recipie less than 5 *****, but this one really didn't work for me.  Like another cook before me, the meatballs were mushy and although they had a nice texture on the outside, the insides were severely underbaked.  Added baking time only made them hard. The glaze was great and I will probabally use that for something a little different later on.  I tried them so as to "escape" soy products for awhile. I neither recommend this recipie nor will I make them again ... sorry. :-(

Wow.  As a #1 meat lover,  I was SHOCKED how good these are!  They are DELICIOUS!  I had a vegetarian friend over for dinner and gave these a whirl.  Followed the meatball recipe as written except: ( used 1 c. Egg whites, made my own sprout bread bread crumbs and used my own seasonings).  My friend also LOVED these and took the recipe home.  The texture and firmness were perfect after baking (I was nervous because the raw state seemed a little soupy), you could not tell it was a "meatless" meatball.  I'm already thinking about all of the other sauces/meatballs you could make with this recipe - curry..teriyaki.. mushroom gravy..and on and on.  Whoever came up with this recipe is brilliant!

Awesome in theory but made lots of changes....you will NOT be disappointed!  Egg whites, nonfat cottage cheese, vegan cheddar (which is creamier), lower on breadcrumbs and jam. Add more garlic, Italian seasoning,  and hot sauce. Served at a large party, not one person could tell it was healthy or vegetarian. ..everyone LOVED THEM! My new secret!

These were good. I skipped the sauce and instead bake them without sauce and then put a barbecue sauce on them and serve them as an appetizer. And used ground gluten-free rice chex cereal in place of the breadcrumbs. It did a good job. I will make these again. UPDATE: made as Italian style meatballs in spaghetti sauce...AMAZING!

These were so yummy! My husband and I love these.  They are one of our new favorite vegetarian dishes.  I've made them several times now with different sauces and they always come out perfect! The only change I made was I used oats instead of breadcrumbs each time.  Thank you for the amazing recipe!!!

I have tried many many vegetarian burgers and meatball recipes and nothing compares to this one.. i did make a few changes.  substituted the cottage cheese with ricotta cheese., mixed nuts for the pecans which iground into a paste, added garlic powder and ground ginger.  i did not use the parsley, basil or any of the herbs.  i baked the meatballs and then brushed with orange ginger sauce. and some with sesame sauce.  there were a HUGE hit .  i am going to try crumbled blue cheese and franks hot sauce for a buffalo wing taste.  Thanks for the recipe

I first tasted these delicious meatballs at a Bunco party. Even though I am the only vegetarian in the group, everyone tried and loved them.  I made them myself today with a few variations:  I used walnuts instead of pecans, Panko breadcrumbs instead of seasoned breadcrumbs, and I added 1 can of pureed Northern white beans for protein. I think there are many variations you could try, depending on what is on hand.They were amazing and everyone raved about them again. We ate them as Italian meatballs in sourdough bread with a little marinara sauce.  Great!

These meatballs are very versatile.  I make them plain, without any sauce.  Then they can be basically a meat substitute for anything.  Covered with mushroom gravy, they were my thanksgiving turkey replacement.  Warmed with marinara, perfect meatball hoagie.  Siracha hot sauce turn them into a spicy appetizer.  Love this recipe, a must for vegetarians that don't want to eat the store bought "meat substitute" products.

They turned out fabulously! Used only 1cup of bread crumbs and substituted tomato sauce for ketchup. Couldn't have been tastier. Would make great burgers as well. Can't recommend them enough as they are SO yummy. In fact, I don't normally post reviews but couldn't help myself in this case.  Fear not. Just make them!!!

The meatballs were fairly good, but kind of tasted like seasoned breadcrumbs, even though I halved those. Which might have been okay except for my second issue, which was the sauce. Like others, I tried to cut the ketchup. Honestly, while I totally understand the urge to do so, I wouldn't recommend it: you don't end up with enough sauce. You just don't. Also, the sweetness of the ketchup cuts the vinegar, and you need that if your meatballs are going to be sweet and sour and not just . . . sour. Having said that, this is clearly the result of my modifications to the recipe, and not anything to do with the recipe itself. I think that if I'd followed the instructions on the sauce, the bread-crumb flavor of the meatballs might have been masked a bit. So I'll probably try this recipe again - as written, this time!

These are amazing. The ingredients are things I keep in the house anyway. I followed the recipe except that I used fat-free shredded cheddar, fat-free cottage cheese, and one cup of panko bread crumbs(2 cups seemed excessive). I took off one star because when I made the sweet and sour sauce and tasted it, it was a little bland for me, so I added about fourth a cup of brown sugar splenda, and that made a big difference. Oh, and I used sugar-free apricot jam. The baking time was good, and when they cooled a little, I tasted the corner of one of the meatballs, and they taste as good as they look and smell. Served this with mashed potatoes and corn on the cob. Next I'm going to make the meatballs with brown gravy and then marinara sauce. This is definitely a keeper because I don't always keep ground beef on hand for traditional meatballs and now I don't have to. Thanks KIMCA for the recipe.

Very good! I used walnuts instead of pecans, a little less oil and a bit more oregano and skipped the sage. Like the texture and flavor! Happy to have this good, new recipe. Thank you!

Loved, loved, loved these!!! We used gluten free bread crumbs from the health food store. My husand and boys thought these were 'just right' and want them again very soon. Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe was awesome, save for one thing... Texture. It was a little too compact. If there were a way to give them more of a 'loose', textured taste, I'd love to know.

Compliments to the recipe maker, though, especially because there's no soy involved.

WOW!! These were AMAZING!!! I made them exactly as it was written. I almost thought that it wouldn't be enough sauce but it was. I will make these again and again and again. Who would have thought to put cottage cheese in a meatball? I threw these in the cast iron skillet for about 35 minutes. Perfection. This recipe is definitely going into my menu rotation. THANK YOU!!!!

Absolutely delicious.  I used 1.5c fresh bread crumbs b/c I had them and 0.5c panko and chopped cashews instead of pecans.  Nice flavor - I'd make extra sauce next time.  It was very tasty and I could see using orange marmalade if you don't have apricot jam.

Absolutely Fabulous!  I'm trying to make one vegetarian meal a week....and this was one of the first ones I made.  Both my husband and I LOVED it!  The nutty flavor was delicious, and the texture was better than expected.  This was so easy & great.  Thank you for posting!

I always make these, they are so tasty! However, over the years I made some changes that I found greatly improved the dish as a whole. I add Mr. Dash or Montreal style spice mix to the meatballs to improve the favour. Then I make a different sauce with ketchup (1 cup), vinegar (1/4 cup), Worchester sauce (3 tbsp) and brown sugar (1 cup). I cook the meatballs halfway alone in the oven, then add the sweet and sour sauce to let it thicken while the meatballs finish cooking. This is a huge success at every pot luck I attend.

These were a hit with my family, and we are not vegetarians. I used pecan "meal" because I wasn't sure the texture would go over well otherwise. Glad I did; I will do that from now on. I liked the sweet n sour but I think I prefer it to be more savory. Will simply bake and add to spaghetti sauce next time.

I make this every year for my Italian family for Christmas dinner; a winner every time!    I sometimes substitute walnuts (when I can't find pecans) and instead of the sweet/sour sauce I use two cans of cream of tomato soup with a bit of extra water added.  Delicious, particularly if you kick up the basil and add a bit of rosemary and oregano.  Make sure you don't go too light on the salt - easy to underdo and can make them rather bland.  Better the next day... if they last!

These were incredible! I followed some of the suggestions and made some of my own adjustments and it turned out incredible!  First, I decided I wanted to make meatball subs - amazing combination.  In making them I added 1/2 cup shredded carrot, 2 shredded cloves of garlic, substituted very finely chopped walnuts instead of the pecans, and made my own breadcrumbs by toasting my bread and spraying olive oil on it and seasoning with oregano and rosemary.  The only other adjustment was not intentional - I forgot to add the seasoning in the meatballs, so I just added it to the sauce minus the sage.  To prevent having soggy meatballs, which my husband hates, I formed the balls, placed onto a greased pan, and cooked in the oven for 20 minutes or so or until lightly browned and they could hold their shape.  I then added the sauce and cooked for the full 40 minutes.   DELICIOUS!! MAKE THIS DISH!!

Our family review: Dad says it was a very flavorful dish with wonderful presentation,  My 10 year old says it is a great dish for being meatless, but the sauce was a bit too sweet,  My 8 year old said she also felt the sauce was a bit sweet but was a tasty explosion in her mouth.  I think the meatballs were fantastic and the sauce sensational.  Will surely make this again.  Yum !!

This is a totally awesome recipe.  I made the mistake of letting the mixture set before I made the balls.  It still worked but was more difficult.  I also used a 9 X 9 pan.  It was much more efficient than the 9 X 13.  I made it for my mom and a couple of her non vegetarian friends tasted them.  Everyone thought they were delicious.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I covered these with 2 cans of tomato sauce instead of the sweet and sour and baked them for the same amount of time to use in vegetarian spaghetti and meatballs!  It was perfect!  They also freeze great.  I just thawed out the leftovers from that meal and threw them into my vegetarian chili and mashed them up.  Great recipe! Thanks!

Great recipe!  I used tomato paste instead of ketchup (much healthier).  To avoid hard meatballs, don't squeeze them too tight.  My last bit of advice is to buy pecan meal from the bulk food store in order to get the pecans the right consistency.  It's only available at Christmas time, so buy a bunch and store it in the freezer so it doesn't go rancid.  Thanks for a great recipe KIMCA!!

I haven't made the sauce yet, but the meatballs themselves are incredible. If I hadn't made them myself I wouldn't have believed they were vegetarian. My husband has been missing meatballs from our meat-eating days, but these should fix the problem. THANK YOU for such a wonderful recipe!

Was very excited to try these, but did not care for them.  The sage just does not seem to belong.  Also with all the italian seasonings, a spaghetti type sauce would be better suited.  The texture of the meatballs was great, but would not make again with the sweet and sour sauce which was only okay.  Overall too many competing flavors that didn't blend well.

This is a keeper recipe!  I was very skeptical about it...I even made another dish on the side incase it was not edible because I was scared there was not going to be any dinner.  But everyone in my house loved it.  My son who does not like meatballs wanted more and more.  My mom stopped in during dinner and she hates vegetarian foods she liked them with the pecans...this will be in the front of my recipes for a long time as it's something the whole family enjoyed meat eaters and vegetarians alike.

This recipe was amazing. A bit hit and so easy to make. I did make a few changes just because I didn't have enough of everything. For starters I used 3 eggs, just under 1 cup of shredded cheese, 1 teaspoon salt (and it was still a bit salty), marjoram (no sage on hand), 1 1/2 cups breadcrumbs, just over 1/2 cup cottage cheese and just under 1 cup of finely chopped pecans, sunflower seeds and cashews (mainly pecans though). I also added 1 carrot, finely chopped (finely shredded may make the mixture too wet).

I chose to use a marinara sauce, because I didn't want to sweet and sour sauce and it was delicious. I cooked the meatballs in the sauce and they turned out great. 

Since the recipe made so many, I just rolled them and baked them solo (no sauce) and have popped them in the freezer - so easy. 

I will certainly make these again. Fantastic!

I loved this recipe.  I made it for a 4th of July picnic and got rave reviews.  I added more bread crumbs until you could shape into meatballs.  Don't make them too big since they swell during the cooking period.
I will make again

I absolutely love these. They're great. Last time I made them, I didn't realize I was out of chopped pecans until it was too late to turn back, so I ended up using chopped (and smashed) almonds instead. And they were still good. I defenitely recommend these!

Wow! This one's a keeper. I've made them like 5 times already. Definately worth it to make a double batch and freeze them. They reheat wonderfully. My husband loves them (not a vegetarian like me).  The texture is fabulous. I like them best with regular red sauce. Thanks for this great recipe.

I served these on Christmas day and they were a huge hit! My father-in-law announced that he'd better tuck into the meatballs I'd made, knowing that we're vegetarian, then was shocked to find out that they weren't really meat!

I wish I would have chopped the pecans finer. They were a bit crunchy, but the dish was very good. My husband liked the sauce a lot.

These are amazing! I've made them twice now, once for a holiday pot luck and everyone loved them and people couldn't believe that there wasn't any meat in them. I made them again last night and they were even better this time! They only thing I would recommend is if you don't like a strong ketchup flavor to cut back on the ketchup. I like it just the way it is, but my husband thought it was a little strong. I will definitely make this again and again!

I live in New Zealand and the on-shelf vegetarian options here can sometimes be a little bit bland. These were FANTASTIC! Everyone I've made them for has gone crazy over them - particularly the sauce, although it is quite sweet. The meatballs have the most amazing texture too. This one is definitely a keeper.

This recipe is a keeper!  I followed the recipe exactly and the vegetarian meatballs turned out great!  My husband (who is not a vegetarian) really enjoyed the texture of the meatballs, and asked that I make an Italian dish with them.  I finely ground the pecans as other reviewers suggested.  I also used 100% dry breadcrumbs, and the texture of the meatballs was perfect.  I was weary of the ingredients in the sweet and sour sauce, but it was surprisingly delicious.  It was very sweet, but very good.  Next time I will add even more hot pepper sauce to spice it up some more.  This recipe is definitely worth trying for any vegetarians tired of soy meats.  Thanks for the recipe!  I will also try these meatballs with marinara or mushroom soup in the future!

Most of my family are vegetarian...very picky vegetarians...and this recipe was a hit!I did make a change to it as I used what I had in my pantry by adding 3/4 cup of Spicy Red Pepper Jelly instead of the apricot jam.  While I haven't tried it with the apricot jam; i think the red pepper jelly gives it a bit more kick and less of a ketchup taste to the sauce.  I will definitely make these again.

My husband and I really enjoy this recipe and have made it several times now although never with the sauce.  I have used jarred spaghetti sauce when making the meatballs.  I have also used the same exact recipe and cooked it as a loaf to use for sandwiches - I had to increase the cooking time by 15-20 minutes when doing so though.

These are the best veggie meatballs I've tried so far. The recipe is easy to follow, the only hesitation was with the amount of pecans to use (1 cup pre or post grinding?) We used 1 cup of ground pecans and I think it would have been better with a little less than that. Also on the advice of many reviewers we did not use the sauce but instead used the sauce from "Lana's sweet and sour meatballs".  The veggie meatballs with Lana's pineapple sauce was amazing and I will no doubt make it again.

meatballs were very good, the sauce was moderate, some of my family liked it but I did not.  I would try the meatballs with a Ground Nut sauce or  swedish meatball gravey or perhaps a more traditinal sweet and sour sauce

great recipe - people couldn't believe this had no meat in it. Will definitely make again.

personally I wasn't amazingly keen on the sweet and sour sauce - bit too ketchupy for me but it went down very well so I may well make again (but I might also look for a more authentic recipe)

This is one of my favorite dishes of all time. I use whatever nuts I have. I have tried it with pasta sauce and while good, it's not as good. These are better the next day if that's even possible. Can't say enough good. 

I have served this to meateaters and they ALL have loved them. I served it to a group of friends and one said she realized later that she had meat (what she thought was meat) at a vegetarian's house! 
Thanks for the recipe!

I really did like these meatballs. I was expecting them to taste a little bit better, but they were still very good. I would almost give it 5 stars, but I really didn't like them until the next day. The leftovers were really good. I plan to make them for the vegetarians in my family on Thanksgiving. I'm going to make them the night before though ;) Thanks for the recipe! I was so tired of eating the same stuff! I love a new vegetarian recipe!

Incredible - this is definitely the best recipe I have found on allrecipes.com, and everyone I have exposed it to has loved it.  While it is a bit expensive, there is nothing quite like putting it together and getting your hands into it - literially.  Thank you very much, KIMCA!

I made the "meatballs" last night for the first time (using my own sauce)and they were really, really delicious. However, I would cut way back on the salt - maybe start with a teaspoon (or less)and then salt to taste after all of the ingredients are mixed. Other than that, this recipe is a real winner!

My boyfirend thought I was lying when I said there is no meat involved. I also used a jar of spaghetti sauce instead. I made this for a second time on thanksgiving and it wasn't as good. We were running behind on dinner and left the meatballs in the oven to stay warm. It overcooked and became really hard and flavor-less. Don't forget to take them out exactly when the recipe calls for!

I absolutely loved this recipe. My non-vegetarian boyfriend said that they were wonderful. Difficult to tell that they were not meat. They are easy to make and taste divine. Try making these for a party. They will be a hit for sure.

If I could give this a zero, I would.  Everything was so promising.... the meatballs smelled fantastic, the sauce was nice.  When I took them out of the oven, however, the outside was alright, but the inside has the consistency of raw dough... Mushy mushy mushy.  I thought that maybe more time in the oven would firm them out, but nothing worked.

these were very good and a nice alternative to the soy products that I am often stuck with. I too used more Italian seasoning and oregano-no sage. I had enough left over to use with spaghetti later in the week. My husband- a meat and potatoes man liked them and he really liked the sauce! Thank you for this creative and yummy recipe.

This recipe was a hit at my twins b-day party with vegetarians and meat-eaters alike. My brother in-law is steak and potatoes guy and self proclaimed "hater of vegetarian" really liked these and even said if he hadn't been told they were vegetarian he would not have known. Thank you so much for a great veggie recipe.

These were a hit, will definately make again!  I added garlic and 1/2-3/4 cup less bread crumbs and still firmed up surprisingly; I thought it was gonna turn into mush, but didn’t.  I would add more hot sauce as it was pretty sweet with out much sour but great base recipe.  Also I was short on cheese but don’t think it affected them.

I had a veggie meatball recipe a few years ago that was just okay; I tried this version as an offering for my daughter, who has recently gone vegetarian. As another reviewer suggested, I used half the amount of bread crumbs and I used panko instead of regular; I also used Italian seasoning, because it was all I had. The mixture was pretty mushy and a little tricky to form, but it firmed up nicely in the oven, and the finished product tasted as close to real ground beef as any vegetarian version I have ever eaten. Overall, I was very pleased and I will make this recipe again!

Sweet and tangy! I served it with rice noodles. They cut the vinegar a bit. Even non-vegetarians should like this dish. I didn't have apricot preserves. I substituted a combination of orange and strawberry. Hmmm. I'll make again with apricot. That will probably be even better.

These were very easy to make. Followed recipe exactly and they turned out perfect and tasted WAY better than I thought they would! Will make again for sure and might try another sweet n sour sauce or even a creamy mushroom sauce now that I have a basic, great-tasting "fakeball." Lol

I made these as a side dish to our Christmas dinner. I followed the directions exactly as written. I put the pecans in a mini food processor and chopped them very, very fine. I have to say, for someone who is not a vegetarian, they were delicious!  My two sons who are vegetarians loved them. Will definitely make this again.

My wife doesn't like onions, so I substituted onion powder; roughly 2 teaspoons; turned out great.  I would definitely recommend small curd cottage cheese, or you need to blend them up a bit.  I also used 3/4 c eggbeaters substitute instead of regular eggs to cut down on the cholesterol.

For a few of them, I fried them in a cast iron skillet to brown the sides, the put a homemade tomato sauce on them, covered it with tinfoil and put it in the oven at 350 for about 15 minutes. I then made them into a meatball sub with mozzarella and broiled to melt the cheese. It was amazing. My wife doesn't really like meatball subs, but she really like it.

I didn't have any sage so just added a bit more of the Italian spice instead.  I wasn't sure about this combination but it worked out great.  I made the sauce and baked it separately from the balls because I wanted to serve them on buns and didn't know if the sauce would be too sweet.  It wasn't so the next time I am going to double the batch and save half for 'snacking' on.  My husband who is a true meat and potatoe man told me that this recipe is a keeper!

Good recipe but we adapted to fit our taste. I left out the sage because I just personally don't like sage. We actually forgot the pecans and they still turned out hearty! They sweet & sour was really sour! I think it was the preserves I bought; fixed that with 1/4 c. Splenda.

Wow! Hands down the most convincing meat free dish I have had.  My husband and 9 year old were convinced it was made with burger.  I would have thought so too if I hadn't made it.  Bravo!  I will try this "meat" for spaghetti meatballs and a meat loaf.

I have to try making them again. I didn't make the sauce, we have our favorite Sweet & Sour Sauce by Contadina. They were terribly dry. I also used minced onion (dry) and think that dried them out. I'm sure they will be great once I cook them correctly.  I will rate them again after I try them again.

This is the first review I have ever made anywhere a little messy to make the vegetarian balls but worth it perhaps a little more breadcrumbs would have helped .Sauce was great and cooked them on my grill make sure you coat them with vegetable oil and turn them for a really crispy outside . I then put them in a crock pot and added the sauce. They were a bit with the wife ??

Just tried this recipe last night on the family & it got a "thumbs up!" Really gr8 sweet & sour sauce.  When I told husband on phone that I was "trying out a new recipe," he commented afterwards that he didn't have very high expectations and was pleasantly surprised that these tasted so good.  Did modify recipe by using mozzarella cheese & reducing ketchup to 1/3 cup & salt to just a tsp. Thx 4 sharing recipe!  &:0)

This is a fantastic recipe!  I'm not a vegetarian, but I'm always looking for options to serve to my friends who are.  Everybody loved these, meat eaters and vegetarians alike!  They were even better the next day so if you're serving them for a party, I would recommend making them the day before and reheating them in the crockpot.  The second time I made them, I used low/no fat or low sugar/calorie versions of everything I could and personally didn't notice any significant difference in consistency or taste.  Wonderful!

I am not a fan of soy meat substitutes. As a vegetarian, if I want something meaty, I usually opt for mushrooms. I got a craving for cocktail meatballs, with cranberry and chili sauce. I used this meatball recipe and was thrilled with the outcome. They hit the spot and my meat-loving husband enjoyed them too. Easy to tailor to your liking. I added italian seasonings as well and used low fat cheddar and low fat cottage cheese.

I made these exactly except changed the sauce to 1/3 cup apricot jam and 1/3 cup ketchup.  I was worried when the sauce only coated the tops of the meatballs...it worked out because I think otherwise would be too overpowering.  I will try reducing the amount of bread crumbs next time for fat content.  Done cooking at 35 mins.  Spray the bottom of the pan.  Otherwise these were amazingly good!

I'm not a vegetarian but I live with my boyfriend who is.  We like to cook together and are always looking for meals that will satisfy us both.  These were AMAZING.    I used finely chopped walnuts instead of pecans, because they struck me as a "meatier" nut.  I also got creative with the sauce, tuning the ratios to our tastes and adding some leftover tomato sauce.  They turned out great and made delicious leftovers over spaghetti the next day!

I didnt think this sounded good based on the ingredients, but the reviews were great, so I thought I would try it. This is the best food EVER! Great comfort food! I replace the cottage cheese w/ tofu. It makes the mixture less bumpy and less sticky when forming the balls.  I also use basil instead of orgeno. GREAT RECIPE!

I made this last night and it turned out great.  I made a few modifications.  In the “meatballs” I used Ezekiel bread for the crumbs instead of Italian bread crumbs.  I added Italian seasoning, and left out the sage.  I made more sauce than called for because I wanted to serve it over noodles.  I used tomato sauce instead of ketchup, apple cider vinegar instead of white.  Added a little brown sugar, garlic powder, and Worcestershire sauce.  After 40 minutes of baking, I used the sauce in the pan to baste the meatballs and baked 10 more minutes.

These are delicious - but instead of baking them in the sweet and sour sauce, I just bake them on a cookie sheet, and serve with spaghetti and marinara. I agree with the other reviewers that the amount of bread crumbs can be cut slightly (just add slowly until the texture is such that they can be formed into a ball and keep their shape), and I leave out the pecans to lower the fat content a little. They turn out great every time!

I have tried this recipe on several occasions and everyone loves it including the sauce. Some have not realized that it is not meat.  It taste so good and I love it. As a matter of fact I am going to make it again this weekend for a church gathering.  It is absolutely delicious.  An excellent vegetarian dish.

I had my doubts about this recipe, but the meatballs were amazing! I agree that the sauce was a little too sweet for our liking, so we'll probably serve it on the side next time, but this is definitely a keeper. We are going to use this meatball recipe for other dishes. Wonderful and satisfying!

This was my first attempt at meatballs since becoming a vegetarian 18 months ago, and I was delighted!  My non-veg husband enjoyed this as well, although my 5- and 3- year old daughters were less than impressed.  We served them over rice, and they made for a filling, delicious meal! I followed some suggestions and made a couple small changes of my own: used eggbeaters in place of eggs, nonfat cottage cheese, chopped the pecans almost to the point of mincing, used half Italian breadcrumbs and half Panko, didn't have sage but added 1/4 tsp cumin.  Prepared the sauce as directed, but it seemed oily - may try less oil next time.  Baked as directed, 35 minutes at 350, and they came out great.  Actually didn't have room in the pan for all the meatballs so I baked 4 separately on a cookie sheet, will try them tomorrow night over spaghetti with marinara. Easy, quick, and yummy - give it a try!

The 5 stars are for the acutal meet balls.. then sauce was good... but had a very strong taste which only comlimented the meat balls if there was a small layer, just basically brushed with the sauce, otherwise it was overpowering. Will def make these meat balls again, and perhaps a meat loaf! They do look taste and have the texture of meat... closest I have had to real meat since becoming a vegetarian

I should have listened to the reviews that said to only use 1 cup of bread crumbs; I made the recipe as stated, and it tasted like mediocre stuffing.  I also agree that the seasonings in the meatballs and the sauce compete too much, and I think the cheddar cheese should be upped to 1 cup.

I can't believe how good these tasted!! I used fat free cottage cheese and only 1 cup of store bought bread crumbs. (1/2 c. garlic & herb, 1/2 cup plain). My husband loved these too. Definitely a keeper!

These were pretty good, I only used 1 cup of bread crumbs but I think 1 1/2 might be better. Also I didn't crush the nuts to finely which gave them a weird texture but still good. next time I know better. I will be making these again!

The meatballs are excellent. The sauce wasn't anything exceptional, it wasn't bad, but next time I would try it with a different kind.

I made these for my vegetarian daughter last night and she and I both absolutely loved them.  She was surprised as she hates pecans.  She said she couldn't tell they were in there.  The sauce is wonderful and we made sure we got every drop out of the pan when we stored the leftovers.

I wanted to try this so bad after reading the reviews, but I didn't have time to get all the ingredients.  I subbed the cottage cheese with feta cheese, replaced real eggs with Egg Beaters, and omitted the salt.  I grated the onion so I wouldn't have chunks, and I crushed chopped pecans with my rolling pin (no food processor).  I used a standard 1 Tbs cookie scoop and yielded 28 meatballs exactly.  I baked for 30 minutes with a mist of olive oil (no sauce), and I'm glad I didn't bake longer - once out of the oven the meatballs continued to cook some and became the perfect texture for me.  Next time I'll sneak in shredded carrots/zucchini for a veggie boost.

Definitely a keeper! The 'meat' balls are very flavorable ....... ummmmmm!! If I could I'd give recipe 8 stars, even though I purposely left some ingredients out. No Italian seasoned bread crumbs, so used Gourment Round Croutons - Parmesan Cheese and Garlic Flavor. No apricot jam for the Sweet and Sour Sauce so used peach preserves. Left out the minced onion, oregano, and hot pepper sauce - too many spices. Even with the changes/omissions, the taste is GREAT!!

I am rating this based on the taste of the meatballs only (not the sauce). I made them as directed except I baked them in a dish without any sauce on them. Once they came out, I separated them and put a few in marinara sauce for meatball subs for dinner ("Best Marinara Sauce Yet" recipe on this site) and the rest I am freezing for later. I plan to try the sweet and sour sauce later. The meatballs are so good, though! The only thing I changed is I used low fat cottage cheese and cheddar cheese to cut down on the fat, and I added a clove of garlic.

It was very good.  The meat balls were a bit too salty, and the sauce was a bit too sweet.  A good start for experimenting with veggie meat balls.

This even fooled my husband!! He's a meat & potato guy & my daughter is a vegetarian. He thought I used ground chicken or turkey. Served with stroganoff sauce (no one is a sweet & sour sauce fan). I baked on a greased cookie sheet for about 8-10 min, turning half way through. Suggest adding bread crumbs a little at a time, just enough so you can roll into balls. Plan on making patties for a burger and in spaghetti sauce. Nice change from Tofu & beef.

Really great if your a vegetarian! I make these just as the recipe says except I leave out the sage. I bake them in the oven with no sauce and then add them to a slow cooker with BBQ sauce and we snack on them all day! So yummy! And they get better as they sit. I've made them several times and never get sick of them. Thanks for sharing this! xo

I am struggling to be a full fledged vegetarian.  I was raised a meat eater but just don't see any reason that an animal should die so that I can survive.  Especially with all the wonderful alternatives.  I added a little olive oil to this recipe just for texture.  It was excellent

These are awesome! I made them twice in one week.  I took them to a Halloween party for a veggie option and they were gone within minutes and then I made a second batch later that week- they reheat really well.  One thing I changed was to make the "meatballs" slightly smaller the second time.  I had no problems with them being too mushy at all.  Great recipe!

This was really very tasty.  The only change I made was to add minced garlic to the "meat".  I did, however, find the meatballs to be a little dry.  Next time I will moisten the breadcrumbs with a little milk before adding to the mixture.

These were good - I would definitely make them again.  The only thing I didn't absolutely love was the sauce - I guess the flavors were OK (I love sweet and sour anything), but there wasn't enough of it.  The sauce barely covered the meatballs in a 9 X 13.  Strange.  I would probably double the sauce.  Or pour some sort of creamy mushroom sauce over it, as another reviewer suggested.  Pretty versatile.

These were easy to make and tasty. They did not taste like real meatballs and I read in other reviews but they were good none the less. When I baked them I put the sauce over half and left the other half plain to use with spaghetti. The sweet and sour sauce was surprisingly delicious, and I cut down the ketchup just because how many reviewers said it would just taste like ketchup other wise. I might make these again but probably not any time soon.

Very interesting. I would have never believed that this combination of ingredients would lead to this taste and texture. It was pretty good. I do not think I will make it again - as I preffer real meatballs (made from ground chicken). I did not tell my husband what was in the meatballs - to see his reaction. He thought they were pretty good as well. We both liked the sauce too (which needed to be doubled and then thinned out a bit with some hot water. I did make a bunch of changes to make the meatballs low fat and healthier. I omitted the cheese and pecans in the "meatballs" and left out the oil in the sauce to redude the fat. I also substituted heart healthy oats for the bread crumbs. I needed to add more oats in place of the omitted nuts to help make a denser mixture that would hold together as a ball and not fall apart.  If I do make these again, I would take the advice of a previous reviewer and shred carrots and zucchini to sneak some vegetables into this mixture. I will also saute the onion because they were still very firm when we ate them, and I would like the onion to be softer and be part of the meatball mixture.

These were very good, but a little too nutty tasting.  I will definitely make them again, but less nuts.  The sauce is wonderful, and goes well with the rice.

I made these for my vegetarian friend who was visiting. My whole family liked them, even my picky 4 year old and our teenager too. My husband said he couldn't tell there wasn't any meat in them. I even enjoyed them and I don't eat regular meatballs. Great recipe. The sauce tasted like there was too much ketchup like others have said. Otherwise it was great. Would like to try with pasta and tomato sauce too.

These are surprisingly pretty good and definitely taste better the next day.I
 have made these twice now.  I used a home made Autumn Fruit spread instead of the jam called for in the recipe the second time around and they were extra yummy.
Everyone really likes this recipe--thank you for sharing.

Delicious.  We didn't have sage and I wish we had.  But the consistency was amazing.  I wish the sauce was a little sweeter.  Best veg meatballs my fiancé and I have ever had.

This recipe is delicious! My daughter is a vegetarian but the rest of the family is not so it's a challenge to find a meal that I can make for all of us. Everyone, vegetarian or not, LOVED them.  The texture was just like a regular meatball.  My son had no clue that they weren't meat until I told him half way through the meal. This is definitely a keeper!!

This is a good recipe but certainly not vegan with cheese and all those eggs. I used walnuts and omitted the salt, but oterwise followed the recipe exactly. I loved the sauce, but it should be doubled.  I think I overbaked the meatballs as they were dry and pasty inside. I might have made them too large, too. However it is an excellent recipe and I will tinker with it in the future.  The only OTHER good veggie meatball I ever had was "Mom"s Meatballs" from my favorite vegan health food store in Pleasant Valley, NY. She serves them at her lunch counter and even sells a bagged mix.

Loved them!  Have been a semi-vegetarian for years and this is the best "meat like" recipe I have tried.
Thank you so much for sharing.  It will be a new family favorite.

I have been a vegetarian for a little over a year.  It is really difficult to find any good "meat-like" recipes.  This was fabulous,,,I will definitely bring it to my family Christmas dinner.

I am always looking for vegetarian recipes to serve my non-vegetarian friends and I made this for my annual Christmas Eve
get together.Everyone loved these meatballs and some actually thought I was serving meat on Christmas Eve.
I made them Italian style instead of sweet and sour so instead of your sauce I used a good quality Italian marinara sauce. They were excellent and in fact the reason I am commenting so long after the fact is that the original batch I made was for 20 servings and I am making them tonight for just the immediate family so I needed to convert to 4/5 servings.

Making these meatballs was so easy and quick, and they came out really well.  I actually used 3 eggs instead of 4, which was fine.  My two meat-eating friends praised their flavor and gave me many compliments.  Thanks!
