This is a great bar cookie. I did find it a little crumbly, but of course I am at high altitude so it may be okay for sea level.  They were great even without the frosting.

Thank you Carol for posting this recipe! I have looked for it for years. My mother made these every Christmas and I did not have the recipe. I will now take over the tradition! Thanks!
