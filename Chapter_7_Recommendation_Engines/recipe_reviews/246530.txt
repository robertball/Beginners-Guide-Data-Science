Because of allergies, we changed the corn starch to arrowroot! It work fine, but I am wondering if halving the amount would be better!!!

We also have made this with four cheese Mexican cheese and the doubled the hot sauce we had in the house to make it more flavorful... It was not hot at all, just made the flavors blend well. I also nearly double the milk to make it the right consistency.

Cornstarch gives a strange aftertaste and it dose not give that velvety, shiny, silky look and feel. Tried with potato starch and was a bit better in taste but same texture, then tried with sodium citrate and it was the best of all, also added a bit of roasted mustard seeds along with the taco seasoning mix.

I often wonder how something so easy can taste so good. I used sharp cheddar cheese and this turned out perfect. No doubt this will go great on just about anything, not to mention that it's addictive.

Great and easy. I LOVE nachos for dinner. I love that this calls for real stuff and no fake cheese products.

This was really easy and quick to make. I used NY Extra Sharp cheese. I grated it myself. Make sure you whisk it over low heat until very smooth. I added about 1 teaspoon each of finely chopped red bell peppers and finely chopped jalapeño peppers because I prefer a mildly spicy cheese sauce and I like the added colors, too.

I used flour instead of cornstarch. I also found it thicker than I preferred & thinned it quite a bit with more milk. For the cheese I used 1/2 pepper jack & 1/2 sharp cheddar. It turned out great...I'll definitely be keeping this recipe & using it over & over!

I didn't have any hot sauce or cream cheese, but I added 1/2 tsp chili powder and about 1/2 tsp of Lawry's seasoning salt. It was a good smooth consistency and came together easily and quickly.

Turned out awesome! Had to add more liquid though than what was called for too make it more of a cheese sauce. It was very goopy at first. Also turned up the heat for a bit and that helped.

It was okay. It didn't have the "nacho cheese" flavor that I was hoping for. I used 2T flour instead of the cornstarch and ended up using a lot more milk. We ate it. It didn't go to waste, but I won't be making it again.

A little on the mild side, even with extra sharp cheddar.  But it is a good starting point.
