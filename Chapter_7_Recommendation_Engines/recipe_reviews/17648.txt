I tried this because I wanted something different to do with cubed steak. It was a huge hit!!!! It was very easy to prepare and extremely tastey. Like other reviewers have mentioned, I tenderized the steak. Then I dipped the steak in egg before the crumb mixture to help it stick. I fried these in batches in my electric frying pan. I then placed it all on a baking sheet and spread the spagetti sauce over it and baked for about 10 minutes then I added mozz cheese to top it all off, returned it to the oven and baked until the cheese had melted. It was wonderful! I should mention that I used Italian bread crumbs and added oregano to the breading mixture. 

I will certainly be making this again!

this is a great recipe served with some angel hair pasta sauteed in garlic and butter and some rolls.  my friends loved it.  it's important to press the bread crumbs into the steaks until you can't make any more stick.  and make sure they're tenderized.

This recipe was good but next time i won't simmer the steak in the sauce because it made the meat soggy. I think i will keep the sauce on the side.

My husband loved this recipe, he thought it tasted just like the Veal Parmesan from the Olive Garden.  I made some alterations:  I used Italian Bread Crumbs, egged the chop steak before putting the bread crumbs on.  I fried them until they were nice and brown and crisp.  Then I put them in a baking dish and topped them with mozzarella cheese and baked (you could also broil) them until the cheese melted.  I heated the sauce separately on the stove because we don't like the breading to get soggy.  Like many others I also served this with angel hair pasta sauteed with butter and garlic.

Tasty and so simple to make.  I used others' recommendations of pounding the meat first (be careful, it thins out quickly and can fall apart), then dipping in an egg/milk mixture.  I used seasoned bread crumbs and added some dried oregano to it.  I did not add salt to the mixture as there is plenty in the bread crumbs, parmesan cheese, and spaghetti sauce.  After frying, I placed them on a cookie sheet, sprinkled on some mozzarella cheese and broiled for a few mins.  I heated the spaghetti sauce separately and let the family put on as much as they wanted.  I stored the leftovers separately, as well, so the sauce wouldn't make the breading soggy.    My husband loved this dish.

This recipe is just like chicken parmesan.  It was good, but it had gotten cold before we were able to eat it.  I think if we had eaten it straight from the oven it would have been better.  I will defiantly make again.  Thank you

Excellent!  I am always looking for a way to use up the cube steaks that I have, because I have never been to fond of them.  However, I could hardly even tell this was cube steak.  It tasted just like a meatball.  Also, I added some italian seasonings to the bread crumb mix, and after cooking the steaks I patted them with a paper towel to remove some of the extra oil.  I will definately be making this again.

I couldn't believe BOTH my kids liked this! Son is super fusy about what he'll eat. I always pound my cube steak pretty flat. Doing this helps to make them more tender. They can be chewy at times. I would suggest dipping meat in a beaten egg so that crumbs stay on better. After pounding meat it gets a bit bigger, so I had to fry these in batches. Couldn't fit all in fry pan to cook with sauce so I put on a baking sheet. Baked at 350 for 15 min. then topped with sauce and provolone and parmesan cheese. Also suggest using Mozzarella. Baked an additional 10 min. Next time I would cut back on baking time, after these are browned in fry pan, they really don't have to cook long. Made up my own sauce for this. Not bad and a very inexpensive meal. Thanks Mary Lynn!

My husband and I didn't really care for this recipe. It sounds simple enough but the taste wasn't what we had hoped for. It must have been the steak cubes that gave it a different flavor. It was easy, though.

My family loved this!  From the big Italian guy down to the little picky eater, all requested this is made again!  If one recipe can 1. be inexpensive 2. easy and 3. please 'em all, it's for me!  We are SO used to cube steaks that taste like a bike tire, this was good and tender (the simmering helped with that).  We threw mozzerella cheese on top of the cube steaks the last 5 minutes of cooking.

A suggestion for this recipe would be to use Top Sirloin Roast sliced 1/4 inch thick to make small steaks.  And don't mix with the spaghetti sauce just serve the sauce on the side for dipping.

Works well for my picky family

I really liked this recipe. I substituted minced beef for the steak (making little meat balls) and it was absolutely gorgeous. Easy and quick to make and made a real change from spaghetti bolegnese. I will be doing this one again!!!

What a wonderful dish! Fast and easy. I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and ground sirloin. It would have been a little better had I used an egg wash before breading the meat. It really didn't have much breading and needed a little "crisp and crunch" to the outside. I made Nanny's spaghetti sauce and used it. Thanks we enjoyed this dish.

In ate some of this as did my husband, but the leftovers are still in the fridge. So it was okay, but I won't make it again. I think we're just used to meatballs or chicken served this way.

We found this recipe to be similar to our recipe for Chicken Parmesan (except the oven is used for that one). I have also substituted Pork Chops in place of the Chicken just to see what came out!!! The Pork Chops were great as were the Cube Steks. Thank you, I never even thought of that!!!

I used chicken breasts instead of beef and it turned out wonderful.  I add Italian seasoning to the bread crumbs and i seasoned the chicken with salt & pepper before breading them.  I also used some oil to make the breading stick to the chicken.  It was a much need change from just plan speghetti.  I also used marinara instead of plan sauce.  My husband says THANK YOU.

My son and I had this, it was something new to try but,won't make it again. I think it would be better using chicken. That's my opinion. I'm not a big fan of cubed steaks.

It was a hit with my family of boys. 
We raise our own beef so when we have top round not everyone looks forward to the meal,but all we're surprised and enjoyed every. Single. Bite. 
I did double dip mine in breadcrumbs (dipped in crumbs then an egg wash then into breadcrumbs again).

Taste delicious, but I had trouble with the coating. It would not stay on. haven't figured out what to do next time and I will make again. It was a great dish and family loved it. Just had problems with the coating.

This is a fantastic way to "dress up" cube steak! I used only 1 lb of steak, but still used the 1C bread crumbs & about 1/3C grated parmesan. I also added some dry Italian seasoning, and a smidge of lemon pepper & crushed red pepper. I double breaded the steaks by dry coating them, then running them through an egg wash (2 beaten eggs w 1/3C water), and then back into the crumbs. I pan fried & then moved the steaks to a baking sheet. I topped them w a few TBSP of homemade sugo (red sauce) given to me by my Italian neighbor, and a generous handful of shredded Italian cheese blend. I popped them into the oven @ 400 degrees F long enough to melt & brown the cheese. I served them w rigatoni coated in EVOO & tossed w crushed red pepper, pinch of salt & pepper & about 3/4C shredded Italian & asiago cheese! It was gourmet eating on a frugal budget! My husband, and even my 2yo daughter, loved the zesty flavor & tenderness of the meat! It was so good I would even serve this to my Italian neighbor!

This is good. As mentioned by the others, I tenderized the meat and also used milk and egg batter with the crumbs.  What I think made it so good is that I added a can of zucchini (in Italian style tomato sauce) to the spaghetti sauce.

Terrific!!!  A brand new family favorite!  This was soooooooo good!  The only thing I did differently was to first pour a small amount of Meyer Lemon Oil into the pan, then extra-virgin olive oil on top of that.  Brought a really nice tang to the meat/sauce without making it taste lemony!    Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Very good way to prepare cube steaks.  Hubby liked it.  I tried it with venison and it came out tough.  I would reduce the cooking time to 15 min.  But the recipe was very easy & very good

I made this recipe to try something different with our cube steak. It was a big hit with my family. My husband don't care to much for Italian type food, but he liked this. And like most I fixed noodles with salad and bread sticks. It just sets it off. So if you just want to try something different this is the recipe to do it. I will most definitely be fixing this again.

I didn't love this.  Part of it was the cut of meat I used, I'm sure.  It was tough.  But I just think that chicken tastes much better in the tomato-based sauce.  I would certainly make this with chicken though.

I tried this and it didn't turn out right. It was good, but all the breading came off. Am I doing something wrong?

Really good, I used rump steak which was very tender and put a little mozzarella on top.  Very good.

I rate this as an average recipe.  It's a lot like chicken parmesan, only with cubed steak.  I'll probably not make it again, although it did not taste bad...it just was not especially good.
