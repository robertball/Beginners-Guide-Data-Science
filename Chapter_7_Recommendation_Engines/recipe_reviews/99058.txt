This is a really yummy recipe, and easier than it sounds. The dressing really makes it perfect. I've made it twice, and was out of dijon the first time, so I added some molasses to regular mustard. I also substitute broccoli for cauliflower, as I'm not a big fan of cauliflower. I steamed both the kale and the broccoli, rather than boiling them. This is an excellent way to cook kale, and great as leftovers too! Enjoy!

This was great! I used broccoli instead of cauliflower and raisins instead of currants, and it tasted wonderfully unique. I also added a little bit of red bell pepper for color, and I made much more of the dressing than the recipe called for. Try serving over quinoa! Excellent!

A good recipe but not one of the best.  Needed a lot more of the sauce.  I ended up adding more lemon juice and olive oil in the end.  We all enjoyed it served over rice as a main dish -- I just wanted more flavor.

I love this recipe.  A delicious way to eat those cruciferous vegetables that are so good for you.  I've made it a few times now.  I cook the cauliflower and kale together in a big pot with a pasta insert (instant steamer!)  I also doubled up the sauce to add a little more flavor -- although I thought it was pretty good with the single batch of sauce too.

We really liked this unique combination of flavors. The lemon really came through, and the tartness was balanced perfectly by the raisins (I used flame, which are larger, softer, and sweeter). The first bite was a little iffy, but the flavor grew on us. I doubled the dressing, and I steamed the kale rather than boiling it. Definitely a keeper.

pretty good.  i doubled the dressing, as others recommended, but it wasn't liquidy enough to serve over rice as another mentioned.  i think if i do this again, or w/ the leftovers i have, i will put roasted hazelnuts or almonds.  it seems to need that sort of texture.  i also suggest making the dressing/currants about 30-60 minutes ahead of time to allow the currants to plump more.

I just loved this recipe. I was a little wary when I looked at the ingredients, but the flavors combine to form such a clean and summery taste. I substituted raisins for currants, as that's all I had on hand.  I served it warm along side a mandarin pork dish, but I actually enjoyed it better cold/room temperature the next day.

Really good dressing.  I didn't have lemon, so I used vinegar instead, and even so, the combination of flavors is great.  I used less olive oil than listed and recipe worked out fine.  Would use this on a variety of vegetables in the future.

Great mix of these veggies together.  I choose to add honey to the sauce to make it a sweet dish..didn't have currants, so used dried cranberries.  I enjoyed this alot, my husband would have preferred it savory..so maybe I'll follow the recipe, omitting the  honey..and getting some currants ( or raisens) . Thanks for sharing.

absolutely delicious. I was skeptical as I made the dressing- it was so simple- but I could eat this all day.

Not good. I was skeptical of the lemon-dijon combination before making this dish; after trying it I realized my skepticism was warranted. It's not a good combo at all. I won't make this again.

I thought both the cauliflower and the kale were a little under cooked for my taste.  I would boil them both til quite a bit softer than the recipe suggests.  Also, the sauce was a little too tangy for my taste.

i tried this recipe with brown spicy mustard instead of the dijion and it worked very well. you could also use lime juice if you don't have lemon. i found this dish to be great on salmon or chicken

This was nice, though it could have used more seasoning. Maybe more mustard. I roasted the cauliflower instead of boiling it, then mixed the hot cauliflower with the kale to wilt it.

I expected to like this more because I love each individual ingredient. The cauliflower definitely needed more than 5 mins. (make sure you chop it pretty small) I found the kale too "watery" from being boiled, even after I drained it for several minutes.  I'd suggest tossing it into the steamer with the cauliflower for the last 1-2 minutes. I also had to make extra dressing.

not a huge fan of this at all!  My roommates didn't like it either.  I love cauliflower and kale, and this just didn't do either vegetable justice.
