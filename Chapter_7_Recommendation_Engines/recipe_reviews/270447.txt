Great flavor, but I did have to double the almond since I didn't have the cherry flavoring.  I also used butter instead of crisco but I'm sure it would be the same either way.  I found the mix to be a bit dry since there are no eggs so I just added extra cherry juice to compensate.  Love the chocolate-cherry combination.  This is a repeat for sure!

I just made these and they are great!  I am sure the recipie would work perfect as is, but I had to make a few changes due to what I had on hand.   I used margarine and added a few extra drops food coloring for a brighter color.  I also increased cherry flavoring to 1tsp.  I live in a very rural area and the only cherry flavoring I could get was a store brand.  I think I wouldn't have needed the extra if I had a more concentrated brand.  They have a great texture and taste amazing.   I know a few chocolate covered cherry lovers who are going to go crazy for these!
