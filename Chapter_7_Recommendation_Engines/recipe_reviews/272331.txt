This is so good an easy! Iâ€™ve made variations of this before but I really likes the simple seasonings in this one. I use about 2 lb frozen chicken and the salsa was a tomatillo and chipotle pepper salsa. YUM! Save the juice and add a little back to the chicken after shredding it. Then save the rest of the juice to use in a soup or chili or additional flavor in other dishes like rice!

Great recipe for chicken! We made a bunch of rice in the rice cooker after we got home from work, and then we steamed up some green beans. This recipe gave us some tasty leftovers to garner some envy at the office. We used mild Pace Picante sauce for our weaker tastebuds, but we're stepping it up to medium next time.
