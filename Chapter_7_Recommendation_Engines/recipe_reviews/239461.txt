As written this is kind of bland cookie.  I omitted the raisins and added 1/8 tsp each ground cloves, nutmeg, and ginger.  The flavor is great with those additions and the toasted coconut is wonderful.  The dough is more of a thick batter that gets dropped on the baking sheet, so I did chill the dough for 30 minutes prior to baking.  These are a nice, cakey cookie.  I took these to a small gathering and they got very good reviews, though my husband did suggest that they would be better with the addition of butterscotch chips.  I lined the baking pan with non-stick pan lining paper and allowed to cool on a metal rack.

This cookie is quick to make and includes items one usually has on hand. Great for those watching their oil/butter intake. They tasted ok, but this would not be a recipe I would search out to make again. I prefer a chewier texture and these definitely need more taste. There wasn't any real flavor that stuck out. I know what was in them, but seems like there was not enough to make any of the flavors shine through. Maybe would be better tasting with a few adjustments.

I liked these bc of the moisture to them. They weren't the most flavorful, yes, kinda bland but I liked them still. Maybe I would add more coconut or chocolate chips next time.

I didn't really like these -- the texture was VERY odd.

Added walnuts because I I only had smooth peanut butter, extra half cup flour to thicken, 1/2 more cinnamon and 1/2 tsp vanilla and they tasted great.  Did not look very cookie shaped otherwise I would have given 5 stars.
