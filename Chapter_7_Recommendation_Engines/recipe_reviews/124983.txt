I used 3 eggs and no baking powder. THE BEST. JUST WONDERFUL!!! MOIST! The frosting makes these brownies. Be sure to make a double batch in a 13x9" pan because they will be gone! (5 eggs, no baking powder for a double batch)

This really is the perfect brownie recipe that I have been searching for. It is easy, and not too gooey or too cakey - just the right texture. The cocoa powder does make this brownie taste so much better than others that use the baking squares. I also made the frosting for this recipe, and it is also very, very good! I don't have any reason to ever use any other brownie recipe again - this one is a keeper for my recipe box.

If you like things really, really sweet this is the recipe for you. This frosting totally overwhelms the brownie it is so sweet. I like the brownie recipe - things that we have in the pantry - next time I will just sprinkle milk chocolate chips on top to melt or even mint chocolate chips.

I have made this recipe again and again.  I followed the tip from babyjaimie and used 5 eggs and no baking powder for a double batch.  I also drizzled caramel sundae topping over top of the batter and swirled in before baking.  I ice it with a vanilla bean butter icing and I have to tell you....they are out of this world. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was sooooo good! I added a little cinnamon to the batter. The frosting has very good flavor but VERY rich, next time I"ll cut back on the cocoa powder and powdered sugar a bit. Also,frosting topped with pecans broke up some of the richness and added a nice bit of crunch. Definately  a keeper along with a Tall glass of cold milk~Thanks :)

These were the best brownies I think I have ever had (that is saying A LOT).  I made them for my husband's birthday.  He requested them again a week later, and has asked for them again today (about another week later).  Delicious.  Freaking Delicious.  The frosting is the best part -- though I did replace the coffee stuff with vanilla.

Wonderful!!!  The only change I made was adding vanilla instead of the coffee.  It uses staple ingredients, so no special trip to the grocery store required.  Tastes just like the ones my Mom used to make.  Make a double batch, they'll go quick.

I don't know what I did wrong....
Everyone else says they're perfect and mine....well, they seperated. The top is entirely liquid butter, it was boiling. I called a few people and they said it shouldn't boil.
I've only made brownies once before, and it was from a box, and they didn't work either. But these....I hope when they cool down they'll be okay, but I think i might have to pour the butter off the top.

Very good! Very easy to make! My whole family LOVED them! We didn't use the coffee in the frosting. If you like a very good chocolatey treat every once in a while try this!!!!!

I too like brownies using cocoa powder; I prefer the taste over ones with unsweetened chocolate.  These are great, moist and they taste just right, not too sweet, not too bland.

These are nearly identical to “Best Brownies” from this site.  In fact, with the addition of another ½ tsp. of vanilla, these ARE identical to “Best Brownies.”   It’s no wonder I liked them then, but they could use a little more cocoa powder, another tablespoon maybe.  After I had already cut the brownies I realized I had intended to frost them!  So, rather than making the frosting as directed, I just whipped up a quick buttercream by not melting the butter and eliminating the coffee.  I was then able to pipe the frosting onto the cupcakes individually.  A very respectable brownie.

Good brownies, but don't add the eggs rather baking soda as one reviewer suggested unless you want cakelike brownies.

I'm not a brownie fan at all but my hubby is, so I've tried three or four recipes, looking for the best tasting brownie. I must say this is it. Compared to another high star recipe the only thing that's missing are the chocolate chips. So instead of icing i'll put some chocolate chips here and there before baking next time.
I must admit the batch I made is almost gone and my hubby isn't even home, so... Great recipe!

These were just "ok" to me. I followed the recipe exactly except only cooked for 23 minutes because they were so thin, I was worried they would be dry. Well they were still dry and cake-like to me. I prefer a moister, denser, fudgier brownie. Guess I'll keep searching for that perfect brownie recipe....thanks anyway.

I was really disappointed with this recipe. All the reviews I had read raved about the moist chocolatey flavour. I found these bland and not at all moist and gooey like I had hoped. I even followed the suggestion to add 3 eggs and omit the baking powder. Didn't help at all.

I've made these several times and they're an absolute hit! The first time I made them, they were a little over done, but still good. Everytime after that, perfect. My fiance says they're the best he's ever had.  :D

These were ok, very quick and easy and used ingredients that are usually on hand.  Too sweet, so they definitely don't need any frosting, but they worked when I was looking for a quick chocolate fix.  I subbed brown sugar for white and sunflower oil for melted butter cause that's what I had on hand and they still worked out.

Very good brownie and so easy to make.   I too, like another reviewer, omitted the baking powder. Have never cared for baking powder in a brownie becuase I feel it affects the texture.   For the reviewer (first time brownie maker) please, please measure exactly and follow instructions.  I promise you that with a little practice you will be able to make perfect brownies - do not overbake because that was my big mistake at first.

FINALLY! The delectable brownies I've eaten in church potlucks as a child! I just love these brownies! They're moist, chocolatey and delicious! The thin layer of icing makes them perfect.   (I didn't add the coffee to the frosting.)  This is the best recipe for homemade brownies and it takes the same amount of time as it would to make the boxed kind, but so much better!

These were just okay brownies. I didnt love or hate them. The brownie is almost not sweet enough and the frosting is just too sweet, you would think it would cancel each other out and be ok, but sadly no. Consistency is great though, not too chewy or cake like, a good in between choice!

On the advice of other reviews I immediately made a double batch in a 13 x 9 pan for the first time making these brownies.  Now, I don't think I have ever tasted anything as sweet and "chocolatey" as this recipe...I doubled everything in this recipe both for the brownie and frosting.  The brownies came out moist; I did use baking powder and eggs even though other reviewers found that using 5 eggs and no baking powder worked; I like my brownies "tall" in the pan.  It cooked for about 35 minutes in a glass pan.  The frosting is more like a really chocolate glaze.  The consistency is not quite like frosting, but does kind of get "candied" as it sits in the bowl.  I did not place the frosting in the fridge while the brownies cooled as I usually do with other frosting as I thought it may crystallize.  I poured the frosting over the brownies when they were still a bit warm....I did one of those, "holy  that's a lot of chocolate" took another bite and decided that I really liked it.  I could have cut back on the cocoa powder in the frosting; so if you double it, I would add more powdered sugar and maybe cut the cocoa to 4 or 5 tablespoons (when doubled).  I also brewed coffee and poured that in rather than warm water and instant coffee; that may have given it a bit more "kick"  I will definitely make these again, but tweak them just a bit...any die hard chocolate fan will be in Heaven!

This was great! Very easy to make. Also, I used part mango butter (zero fat) and part real butter and I could not even tell.

Yes, these are definitely RICH when you include the frosting.  The brownies alone are moist and have just the right amount of chocolatey sweetness..  However, the frosting made them almost a little too sweet, even for me. But still, a very easy and basic recipe that I will most likely make again. If you have a major sweet tooth, these are for you ;)

I used 5 eggs, no baking powder for the double batch and whoo! Boy are these sweet and chocolatey. They're almost more fudge like than brownie like, especially after being refrigerated.

This was a great, easy recipe. I made it without the frosting and added chocolate chips to the batter. Very good, only complain is that it's a bit sugary.

This recipe was all right.  Wasn't WOW, but it wasn't too bad either.  The brownie itself didn't taste too much like a brownie to me.  It had more of a chocolate cake flavor.  The frosting was absolutely delicious though.

Followed the suggestions of other reviews, used 3 eggs and no baking powder.  Also used 1/2 tsp vanilla in the frosting instead of coffee.  These were fantastic!  An easy way to make brownies from scratch without having to melt chocolate.  My oven cooked them in 25 minutes and next time I might check at around 20 minutes.

Very tasty brownie recipe. I made mine in a circular tin and perhaps it was too big so they're thin brownies, but it didnt really rise at all. Delicious though!

I make this recipe with my 6 yr old daughter! we put it in mini muffin tin and bake for bit size brownies. they last all of 10mins once they are cool enough to eat! one batch makes 24 mini muffins. try it lots of fun with kids. but cook times change 350 oven for only 8-10 mins.

Followed recipe as is and got cake like brownies.  It's all a matter of preference, and I prefer brownies that are more dense, chewy and fudge like.

These are very good brownies! I didn't make this frosting and used another from this site instead but the brownies rose alot and I foolishly poured the hot frosting on the still hot brownies which caused them to become fudge like as opposed to the cake like brownies they would have been had I waited for them to cool. I do prefer the cake like brownie myself but I will say these tasted very rich and homemade and I would make again.

These brownies are awesome! the first time i made them to the recipe and they turned out delicious. Today i doubled all the ingredients in the recipe (to make a huge batch) and added a cup of chocolate chips AND a swirl of peanut butter on top just before they went into the oven, needless to say they are heavenly!!

Even if you don't make the frosting, the brownie alone is fantastic. Moist and rich! This recipe is definitely a keeper. Will try the frosting next time - I just ran out of butter this time around.

I would give this 10 stars on the frosting/icing alone! I was needing something for a BBQ and found this gem! So quick, so easy, so delicious! Only thing I changed was used vanilla instead of coffee. I will try it the coffee way next time. Yum!

These brownies were awesome! I was dying for something chocolaty, but didn't have anything but cocoa powder on hand. I'm very picky about the texture of my brownies (I like 'em fudgy and chewy), but these came out perfectly. The key to getting them that lovely fudgy texture is to take them out of the oven when they're slightly underdone. The frosting was also delish! I've never had a chocolate frosting come out so well before, and it really made the brownies superb. The next time I make these, I might throw in some mini choco chips for an extra chocolaty kick. =)

5 STARS X 10!!! OUTSTANDING brownie recipe!  I will make this again and again!  I love how the edges didnt turn into concrete and the rest is moist and rich and just plain old yummy.  I doubled the recipe to fit a 9x13 pan and scaled back the sugar by 1/3 of a cup. SUPER, have hidden these from my fiancee :-)
****UPDATE:made these again, and again yummy! I didnt make the frosting recipe...instead I mealted a half a bag of semi sweet chocolate chips with a can of fudge frosting and spread thinly over the brownies (I quadrupled the recipe for a potluck).  Theyre great like this, I love the original version as well...if youre looking fo ra chocolate fix. youve found it!

This is an excellent recipe for super rich, fudgy, chocolatey brownies.  The taste and texture are very good.  I did not change any ingredients in the brownies, but I did double the recipe to make a larger pan.  After tasting the brownies, I decided not to add the frosting - they are very sweet and rich and it just seemed like it might be too much yumminess all at once for me today :-)..... I may try to play with it when I have time... maybe reduce the butter and sugar a bit, and then try with the frosting.... we'll see.  But if you need a quick and delicious chocolate fix, this will definitely do the trick!  Thanks for a yummy recipe.  I will definitely make again.

Excellent! I've always made brownies from a box, so did my mom. I've had my mother-in-laws and there ok, so I've never been in a hurry to make it from scratch. I'm so glad I finely did. I doubled the recipe [5 eggs, no baking powder] and used the frosting. Yum. They are sweet but very dense cake like. Will make again.

I found this to be one of the best brownie recipes I have. I did not change anything about it. So quick and easy and moist. I also like that it uses cocoa instead of having to melt the chocolate squares.

Better than the box- I would not change a thing!  I am going to be putting the dry ingredients into a jar and passing them out as christmas gifts with a little tag to tell people to add 2 eggs and a stick of melted butter- perfect little gift! Will use over and over!

This is AWESOME!  I really like some rich chocolate, so i doubled the cocoa content.  The flavor is SO yummy!  I've been looking for SO long!    I think that next time i will add an egg yolk or double it and use 5 eggs instead of 4 to help offset the additional cocoa dryness.   I also added walnuts.  YUM YUM!

Bake these if you want to wow the entire world! I add as many walnuts as the mix will hold and top with walnuts too.  My colleagues at work eat them in 2 hours or less.

Super yummy brownies! I made a few alterations. I tripled it and added no baking powder as another reviewer had suggested. Then, I added a handful of chocolate chunks into the batter. For the frosting, I did not have instant coffee but I did have freshly made coffee which I subsituted. Also, finished I realized the recipe (tripled) called for 4 1/2 cups of powdered sugar, I only had 2! Two cups was sufficent! So, I would recommend possibly cutting the sugar by half. Save some calories so you can eat another brownie!

These were good. This recipe has a lot of potential. I only had double yolk eggs, but still used two anyway. Perfect moistness. I used half white sugar and half brown - but next time I will increase the sugar by 1/3 cup because these weren't sweet enough (I only served them with a sprinkling of icing sugar). Definitely double the recipe because they could do with being a bit thicker. I did add the baking powder as I wanted them to rise. These cooked in about 20 minutes, so make sure you check the batch. We like brownies without icing, so next time we would increase the sugar in the batch. Thanks for the recipe and I will try again and update. Made these again about two days later and upped the cocoa to 1 cup, 5 eggs (I only had double yolk eggs so nice and moist, 3 cups of sugar - half brown, half white, left everything thing else the same. I found these actually had the flaky top after they cooled. They tasted better after about 4 - 5 hours, than warm out of the oven. When cool, they seem to contract and the top crackles and the middles get all squidgey. When they're warm and heated, they rise and expand, and are kind of cakey (in a good way). They were five star worthy with this moderation and I will continue to use this recipe as I've never seen them go so fast.

This is almost exactly my family recipe except that Great Grannys' calls for 1/2tsp. vanilla and 1/2tsp. almond extract and no frosting. This has been used by 4 generations of my family now and not one has ever changed anything! I make 6 batches every other week-one for my husband and one each for 5 neighbors. Everybody loves them and just can't get enough! This is one of a few things I am basically "required" to bring to get-togethers! Wonderful recipe!

So So so good!  This is such an easy recipe, and really tastes terrific.  I have a new oven, so my baking times are usually right on with the lowest baking time...so 25 minutes made really delicious, moist brownies.  I didn't use all of the frosting, just added enough to make it taste like I wanted.  I also didn't have instant coffee, so I added 1 T. coffee grounds to the 1 cup water in the frosting recipe, and strained it through a coffee filter to get the coffee water...the frosting tastes like coffee if you eat it by itself, but on top of the brownies, it just is delicious, and not like coffee.  Super recipe!  Thanks!

these are good when i need a chocolate fix, but i prefer a more dense brownie. i followed the recipe, with the addition of cinnamon in the batter, because chocolate and cinnamon is the best. 

the Texas frosting listed on this site went perfect with this brownie. well it is perfect on a lot of things, haha. if you use another icing, which i think was a must on these brownies, scaling to 9 servings should make enough.

i probably won't make again. the search continues...

This is a recipe I have used for years.  I add 1 tsp vanilla and omit the frosting.  Great for a quick dessert from pantry staples. May add 1/2 cup nuts. For chewy texture, shorten baking time. Delicious!

I made this recipe twice. The first time I made it gluten free by using white rice flour instead of all purpose and I added 1/2 tsp of xanthan gum. I came out delicious. The second time I added chocolate chips and doubled the recipe. I did not use icing. This has become a favorite and easy brownie recipe.

Awesome!  These brownies are dense, moist and delicious.  I didn't use the frosting - they are definitely chocolatey and sweet enough without.  I figure I can save a few calories this way too!  Thanks for posting this great recipe.

9 27 16 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/124983/rich-chocolate-brownies/ ... 5 stars with frosting,3.5 without.Using a glass 9x13,I doubled the recipe pretty much except 3 eggs,not 4 & increased vanilla to 1 1/2t.Oh,less sugar: 1 3/4c for double recipe.  Mine was done by 25 minutes.These didn't come out too gooey (although it wouldn't be me to make a complaint over that!  :D) or too cakelike.  They're more fudgy than cakelike for sure.  I'm not a fan of cakelike brownies - hence,one less egg.If I wanted cake,I'd go for a cake recipe.  :o  :)  'Might like them a little taller.They're about a half inch,but that's not a flaw.It's more something that may improve clean cutting.For the frosting, used hot coffee instead of water - still added the instant.I accidentally (as in "oh, there's more confectionary sugar in the cup!" after I'd frosted) reduced sugar to 1 1/4c. Very thick, added 1T milk.It's a not-firm, but stays-in-place-once-on the brownies frosting,nice & shiny.'Didn't double the frosting, but did add a pinch of salt to it.Stays shiny, but not hard.It "gives" a little when you bite,forming very slight crinkles.Yummy,I say.'Might need some vanilla in the frosting - just cause I'm a vanilla freak.I'll add all the sugar next time, too.One more comment,using a flat spatula(looks like a pie server but flat & has a straight edge, not pie shape),this cuts beautifully.I mean gorgeous - like those photos where the frosting doesn't spread into the cake.(I secretly think they make t

I just made these for the kids ... YUM! May not be any left for them! ;) I prefer frosting on my brownies but we tried these before I got them frosted ... they don't even need it. DELICIOUS! Rich in chocolate flavour, soft and moist in the middle. I baked them in a stoneware pan that was a little larger then the recommended size so next time I'm going to double up the recipe.

Best brownies I've ever had!  Rich, fudgy, but still light with a great chocolate flavor throughout!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I don't like my brownies with frosting usually- so, I added a handful of semi-sweet chocolate chips on top before baking ('cause I'm a chocoholic!).  Will definitely save this recipe.

I thought that these were very rich, fudgy brownies. You'll definitely need a glass of milk for this one. These brownies are so much better than the boxed ones. The only thing I changed was omitting the instant coffee granules with vanilla extract. It is my go-to brownie recipe from now on.

Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful! I made a double batch and my entire family loved it! The only thing I changed was the 'frosting', added coffee instead of coffee grounds and I put in about a 1/2 table spoon of vanilla extract. All in all, a great and easy recipe! I am making it again tonight! YUM!!!

Brownies were good hot from the oven but I think they dried out very quickly.  I added swirls of peanut butter and my husband really liked them.  He finished the plate.

Frosting was excellent but I didn't care for the brownie too much. It was too much like cake and I prefer a fudge like texture. Flavor was good but I probably won't make them again.

As a generally skeptical person when it comes to people saying things are, "the best they have ever had," I felt that i NEEDED to share how good these are. I love baking and have recently gotten more into it -- these brownies were SO easy and SO good. I agree with others who have said that the frosting is a definite. I wasn't planning on making it but when I had all the ingredients right in front of me I thought "why not?" It's incredible. These are GLORIOUS! Go make them. now. and making double batch -- i didn't and they'll be gone within an hour.

I'm an aussie, we don't really cook brownies, but I am trying to master some American recipes for my American husband. This brownie recipe is great. Best of all is that is requires only standard cupboard ingredients. If I happen to have some chocolate buttons, or even some block chocolate (chopped up), I will throw in a handful or two, but it is great with or without that addition. I don't ice it as it is sweet enough for me already, I just dust with powdered sugar. Thanks!

This is an amazing recipe! I took another users advice and doubled the recipe, and used 5 eggs, rather than 4 and baking powder. AMAZING - and that frosting- YUM!

frosting is what makes it fo' sho'! haha I really wasn't going to make the frosting, but I started tasting it along the way and boy am I glad! It really isn't chocolate overkill like I thought, the instant coffee gives it the perfect flavor. I added a little vanilla instead of more water (too boring to me) YUM! boyfriend loves as well

These are really phenomenal. The only thing wrong with them is that there just aren't enough!!! They are gone literally that same day that I bake them.  Too delicious. I think what makes the recipe is that it uses flour. I have tried other recipes that don/t and they are just a huge sugary mess. Thanks!!

These were some of the best brownies I have ever had, and so easy to whip up at a moment's notice.  I made the full batch of frosting but then just frosted half because my son prefers everything without frosting.  We ended up putting the full batch just on the half.  So good.  Will definitely be making again.

These are some of the best brownies I have ever made. The texture is perfect - not too cakey, not too chewy, just perfectly fudgey but not gooey. I cut the amount of frosting by 1/3, and thought that was perfect. I will absolutely use this as my go-to brownie recipe from now on.

mois t and chocolatey.  I made mine in a 9x9 and the brownies were too thin.  I reduced the baking time to 20min. I think I will make the following changes, double the recipe and bake in 9x13 leave out 1/2 cup sugar. add chocolate chips, m&m's or reeses pieces

Excellent, added about 1/2 cup chocolate chips and 1/4 cup white chocolate chips because that's what I had on hand. Very moist and gooey and chocolatey.

The Best!  And sooooo easy that you can involve your pre schoolers in making it as well! I read the recipe and thought what? only 1/2c flour? how can that be right? but I followed the recipe exactly- and OMG YUMMY! also have made it adding an extra egg like some people have suggested, really good also!  Tastes like  real chocolately goodness!

Great flavour, definitely chocolatey brownies. The only problem was that they are a little dry. You can solve this problem by putting in a little bit of vegetable oil. Still, definitely yummy! The only brownies recipe that I will be using from now on!

This is a great basic recipe.  I usually make brownies with melted chocolate, but I have to say that cocoa may be the way to go.  It would be easy to mix some favorite candies or nuts.  I did however add more cocoa to the frosting as I though it was a bit too sweet.  Also, I only baked for 20 minutes (in my oven 25-30 minutes would have burned them). I believe substituting applesauce for the egg may work.  Chewy, delicious and completely wonderful brownie!

Fabulous! I did take the suggestions of others by using 3 eggs, eliminating baking powder, and using vanilla in place of the coffee for the icing. I have been searching for a brownie recipe that would be a keeper and this is it! Thanks so much for sharing!

I was quite impressed with this recipe I only had one egg so I subbed the other with 1/4 cup applesauce and they came out perfectly. nice and fudgy. I didn't even add the frosting, just a few sprinkles of mini choc. chips. Then we had brownie a la modes!!! oh yes!!

I do catering for weddings and this is definately the best recipe ever!  Nobody ever leaves a crumb and I always have requests for more.  I have changed the recipe slightly, by adding another quarter cup of flour and another quarter teaspoon of baking powder.  It just helps the brownies to lift a bit more, without loosing any of the taste or texture.  Definately worth baking!

My husband loved these. I thought they were okay. I left off the icing, so that might have a bit to do with it. I'm still looking for a brownie recipe that turns out like the box--moist and chewy, with the flakiness on top. This recipe comes close, as it has the moist and chewy bit down. I'd make them again.

The icing on this brownie makes it worth 5 stars!  I used french vanilla instant coffee instead of regular instant coffee.  It doesn't give it a coffee taste but instead it enchances the cocoa flavor.  I also followed others who suggested substituting an extra egg instead of the baking powder.  I also used half white sugar and half brown sugar. That really made the brownie rich and decadent.  I doubled the recipe and cooked in a 13 x 9 inch pan.  It made appx. 24 brownies.  I sent half with my husband to work.  Everyone in his office has a big smile on their faces this morning!

This was a great brownie recipe. Super easy and delicious. Very rich.  I did substitute vanilla for instant coffee in the frosting.  Also added a cup of chocolate chips to the brownie batter.  We will definitely make it again!

I found this recipe right before Thanksgiving in 2006 - and have been making it ever since!!  I was looking for a recipe that would give me brownies similar to a type that was carried by the cafe at Borders.  The Borders  brownies had a layer of chocolate and white chocolate candy.  So I modified this recipe.  When I am putting the brownies in the pan, I spread a thin layer of brownie mix on the bottom of the pan.  Then, I sprinkle semi-sweet chocolate chips and white chocolate chips on the thin layer of brownie mix. I top the chips with the rest of the brownie mixture.  My family absolutely loves the brownies this way (they are awesome warmed in the microwave!!).  The only problem I had in my modification was that the brownies would stick to the pan.  So, instead of greasing the pan, I use parchment paper - they come out perfectly every time.  I will be using this recipe for years to come.

Really easy to throw together for a quick dessert. I added about a cup of dark chocolate M&M's to take it up another notch. I'll update how they were after we've tried them. EDITED: Perfect combination. Total chocolate utopia. Orgasmic. Worthy of more than five stars.

I made these brownies exactly as instructed, and while they had a nice flavor, they were very cake-like and dry.  Maybe a simple omission of the baking powder would solve that problem??

The thing that I really love about these brownies is that all the ingredients were at home already.  Because you can mix by hand and the measurements are easy with a double batch, they are great for making with children.  Great tasting and really rich!  Awesome brownines.

Wonderful! Followed the recipe with the exception of the instant coffee, still came out fabulous. Be careful though, it is rich, so a little of these brownies go a looong way!

These tasted really buttery - not exactly what I was hoping for.  I made these in a mini muffin pan which I greased with Pam but they were basically destroyed as I took them out.  I like the mini muffin-size brownie idea but recommend using mini muffin-size papers.  I think I'll find another brownie recipe and make another batch with papers which I'll top with a dollop of vanilla icing and a raspberry.

I had never made real homemade brownies until these. My Dad ate half the pan within minutes of it coming out of the oven. I thought they couldn't be that good and then I ate the other half!!! Awesome chocolate fix!!

Very good brownies!  I made them gluten-free with millet flour, and cut the sugar in half.  They were very rich and tasted like fudge.  I imagine that they might have had a chewier texture if I'd used the whole amount of sugar, but we loved them as they were.

Was looking for a recipe like the one that I used in high school that was on the can of Ghirardelli ground chocolate and cocoa powder that used melted butter, and this one works well for me.  I don't like to frost my brownies (frosted brownies are a little TOO sweet IMO) but I *do* like to add a handful of chocolate chips and a bit of grated orange zest to the batter  ;-)

These are the best brownies I have ever had. I cut down the cooking time to about 20-22 minutes and they come out a bit gooey (which I love).

my husband doesn't have a sweet tooth in his entire mouth and usually says chocolate things I make are too sweet, rich, etc.  He walked in the door after work and ate one within 30 seconds and said he loved it.  That's the true review :P  OH I didn't put the coffee in the icing but vanilla like someone here recommended.

WOW! These are impressive.  I've long been looking for a homemade brownie recipe that was as rich and moist as store bought...and this recipe is as close as it gets!  I'm not usually a fan of icing on brownies, but these ones need it - they'd be a little too dry for my liking without.  A great recipe though and I'll definitely use this one again.

I don't know...maybe I did something wrong too, but the brownie mixture did not "form" correctly it crumbled...and for the frosting it was too watery, it didn't even "frost". I followed the measurements exactly..maybe this recipe isn't for me. It tasted alright but not the way I was hoping it to...

I was going to post this recipe and it's already here! These are super easy and I love the fact that I can make them with cocoa instead of baking chocolate. Everyone  I know who's tried these absolutely loves them and my husband's co-workers just signed him up to bring them again this year for the holiday potluck (didn't even ask him, just signed him up! LOL) I double the recipe and bake it in a 9x13 pan. I think the coffee just adds that little bit extra yum! And I always use real butter. There is really no reason that they should be "dry" or have butter floating on top. ??? Never once happened to me. And they are tons better if you let the frosting set for a few hours before you eat them.

Perfect!  Instead of making frosting, which I felt would have been a bit over-powering, I just sprinkled a little powdered sugar over the top after removing it from the oven.

Thanks!

This was OK for me.  The frosting made it good, but the brownie itself was dry I felt.  I took previous suggestions and doubled the batch and used 5 eggs instead of baking powder.  I also subbed out the coffee for vanilla.

I followed the recipe exactly and they were fantastic! However, I didn't make the icing as I felt for our house, it was overkill. The pan of brownies was demolished and I can be sure I will make these many many more times.

Changed a few things. Added cinnamon, almond extract,chocolate chips and swirled Hersey dark chocolate syrup on top. I didn't used the icing do to wanting to cut out a few calories. lol

Will definitely make again.  Very good.  The frosting is a little rich, and I will probably put none or less instant coffee in it.  I also added a few drops of vanilla and a pinch of baking spice to it.  I thought it made it taste very yummy!

This was really easy.  I am not a baker, but these turned out great!  I didn't have instant coffee so I used 3 tablespoons of brewed coffee instead of water and instant coffee.

THESE ARE DELICIOUS! but they were so rich that the frosting was a bit too much. this is an easy, quick dish and great for beginners.

Wowzers!  These are yumalishious!  Very rich!  Each time I make them I'm going to put a little less sugar and cocoa until I find the perfect amount.  Don't get me wrong-I love them the way they are, however, I want to be able to eat 5 of them in one sitting and not be sick! ;)

Excellent recipe. Though I thought that the brownies themselves could have used a bit more flavor, the icing made them perfect. My family finished the entire thing in under an hour! I will certainly be making these again.

Excellent flavor!  I substituted 2 tsp of coffee instead for coffee granules and the water, and cut back on the powdered sugar just a bit.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Oh dear..I don't know what I did!! The frosting tasted like coffee and no one but my brother liked it!! I should of just used some premade I already had..But reviews insisted it's what "makes the brownies". Also, when I  took them out, there were a million holes on top!!  At least it tasted good..So three stars.

I used the brownie mix but not the frosting.  It was a respectable brownie recipe.  Next time I might try adding chocolate chips.

OK, the name says it all!  WARNING...Very Rich, Very Chocolately, Very Sweet!!  So easy to whip up even my 4 year old said "well that was fast!"  Hardest part was waiting the 30 minutes for them to cook..and then cool.  Will be making these again for sure, but I really don't think they need the frosting.  These are comparable to two-bite brownies :D
