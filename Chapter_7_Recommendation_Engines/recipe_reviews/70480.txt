Yum! Easy to make also. I used Boca meatless ground burger instead of Quorn, and it turned out great.

I made 4 servings of this recipe, and it tasted wonderful.  Instead of the meat substitute listed, I used another one that was sold at Wild Oats.  (I don't recall the brand, but it was a crumbly type of "meat" that looked like hamburger.)  I also added caraway seeds, doubled the garlic, and added some pasta.  We will definitely be making this recipe again.

I really enjoyed this recipe! Its nice to have vegetarian options for dishes that normally require meat. Used sliced mushrooms instead of mycoprotein. Added celery and green beans (used canned but im sure fresh would be tasty!)Also used 2 cloves of garlic and low-carb elbows. Very easy to make.

So delicious!  I made it using sliced fresh mushrooms instead of the Quorn, and served it over naan (indian flatbread).  Hubby and I are fairly new to the vegetarian thing, and I was nervous that it wouldn't satisfy us.  But it did!  So delicious, the texture and combination of just enough spices were divine!  This will definitely become a staple for us.

This is a great vegetarian recipe, though like most reviewers I made it with mushrooms (portabella caps) instead of Quorn.  As written, I thought it was missing a little something as I tasted it cooking.  So I added more (LOTS more) paprika and a dash of cayenne (since I've never been able to find good hot Hungarian paprika).  That added measurably, but it was still missing a note.  Finally, when I reheated some leftovers, I added some caraway -- and that made the dish shine!  NOTE:  This recipe makes about double what I'd call "2 servings."  YMMV.

Carnivourous husband even liked this!  
I made lots of substitutions because I don't like peppers and was short on a few items, but this was really easy and tasty.  Used Mushrooms and Zucchini instead of peppers and Morning Star Steak Strips because I'm not sure what this Quorn stuff is.  It was great!

This pretty much tastes like Italian, what with the tomato and oregano and all. I do not know what Quorn is, so I substituted tofu using the following methodology:  Press a block of extra firm tofu in a kitchen towel to get as much water out as possible.  Cut into half inch cubes.  Coat cubes in a mixture of 3T firmly packed brown sugar, 1T paprika, and 1/4t ground ginger powder.  Bake in 400F oven on parchment until edges get firm.  Mix into recipe where Quorn is used. Also, I used a can of "Pear tomato strips in puree and basil", Great Value brand from Wal-Mart, then left out the tomato puree addition. Served over spiral noodles. This was easy, satisfying, not too strange for my husband, so I'll make again.

we really liked this!  I served it over buttered egg noodles and used crumbles for the protein.  Next time, I will change the order of the MOP, though -- I would add things at different times, but really good all around!

YUM!! Thanks for the recipe using Quorn - a product I use a lot. Using crumbles as others have done would make a completly different recipe than intended, try this with Quorn. It can be found in the freezer section of larger supermarkets, and health food stores (either in the meat substitute section, or the health food section.)

REALLY good!  The only changes I made: I used a red pepper instead of green, because that's just what I had.  And I forgot to add sugar at the end.  But it was still really tasty and since I almost always have these ingredients at hand, I will definitely be making this quite often.  I think the only change I'd make next time is I might perhaps use a wee bit less wine. :)

Husband is a meat & potato man, if he could eat that every night for dinner he would. Read a review that someone else wrote about her husband liking it & he like meat as well,so figured I would give it a try.  Just so happens another friend of ours dropped in who is a really big eater & meat lover. Gave him a bowl of it as well & they both really loved it.  Husband said this is a keeper. So this will be made again.  :)

This was excellent!  I did make a couple of mods based on what was on hand.  I drizzled some honey in to give it a little punch of sweetness, and I subbed an unmeasured amount of worchestire for red (I was out).  I subbed 2 stalks of celery for GP since I wanted to use it up.  We loved it.  Thank you so much!:)

I lacked a few ingredients, so substituted the green bell pepper for a red one, and replaced the red wine for vegetable stock. Also didn't have any whole canned tomatoes so I just used chopped ones. I omitted the sugar in the end, and used a bit more tomato puree for sweetness. Having read other reviews, I added about 1 tsp of carraway seeds, which was a great touch. I also added a handful of frozen green beans. I doubled the recipe and it made four standards size portions. This is a great dish that I will be making many more times!

Not impressed. I don't use Quorn, so I used ground, seasoned seitan instead. The second day I added braised cactus leaf and was able to salvage the leftovers.

Wonderful! I doubled the recipe to have enough for two nights. I made some modest changes: used a whole package of Morningstar crumbles because that's what I had on hand. We don't eat onions, so I added more garlic. Also added a stalk of celery, a cup of sautéed mushrooms, extra smoked paprika, cumin, and thyme. Served it over whole wheat bow tie pasta.

I liked this but just thought it needed a few more spices or flavoring. I followed the directions except used white wine instead of red. I served over egg noodles. My husband seemed to enjoy this since he even ate the leftovers which he hardly ever does!
