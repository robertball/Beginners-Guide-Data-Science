This is a FABULOUS spice mix!  I've made this recipe a half dozen times, so finally made up a pint jar with the spices (multiplied the spices by 10, combined, and stored in labeled mason jar).  I rewrote this recipe to be called "Any Meat, Lotsa Beans, Chocolate Chili" and have been handing it out with ziploc baggies of spices all over town, to rave reviews!  I throw in whatever meat, beans, and veggies I please, and the chili comes out delicious every time.  BEST THING ABOUT THIS RECIPE is that you can use left-over, cooked meat, canned beans, and just throw the spices in there and the whole thing is delicious IN ONLY 15 MINUTES!  I also use whatever tomato product I have on hand, and must add some sort of corn, either fresh, frozen, or canned.  Enjoy this recipe... You'll be making it often!

The flavor of this dish isn't for everyone but I loved it.  The addition of the cocoa powder added an extra layer of flavors to the dish that you don't find often in most chilis.  I would definitely make this again.  My only critique, and it is slight as this dish is pretty perfect as is, is that I found the proportion between meat and beans to be too heavy on the beans side.  Next time, I would either increase the lamb by half a pound, or decrease the amount of beans by a cup.  If you're using canned kidney beans, 4 cups is roughly 3 cans.  Otherwise, delicious!

My husband loved this but there was something very weird about it.  I didn't care for it at all.  I would want a lot more tomatoes and less beans.  Maybe it was the beans I used but there was a really bad bitterness that ruined it for me.

This was good and spicy!  We actually raise our own lambs for eating so we have ground lamb availble in our freezer (sorry to those who couldn't find it, it's so good with it!). I actually added 3 cans of diced tomatoes one with green peppers and onions and 2 cans regular rotel.  Next time I will omit the crushed peppers as it was a little spicey for my kids, but they still loved it and said that it was a 'good spicey'.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

We really liked this recipe and I will certainly make it again.  The cinnamon and the cocoa powder add a very subtle and Mexican flavor to this simple and quick dish.  I used two cans of kidney beans and drained the liquid out of the cans as I don't like the flavor or consistancy of the liquid.  I did add a little water to the pot to replace the bean water.  I also added some frozen corn at the end, but this can certainly be left out without.

This is wonderful, I actually used sweetened chocolate powder and it was still very good. I guess it does not matter whether you add sugar to the unsweetened powder or if you just use sweetened powder.

This recipe is awesome!  I had lamb sausage instead of ground lamb.  Basically, the chili was gone in one day.

I made this for the FFA Chili Dinner.  It was a huge hit!  The only change I made was using different types of beans such as black beans, red beans, etc.

Very good chili! The lamb really works in chili and I would have never tried it. I halved the chili powder, because I don't like spicy, and I thought it had the perfect heat--just enough to make your throat tingle. I also thought it was a little bean heavy so will probably cut down on the beans next time, or at least use smaller beans instead of kidney. Even my 1 year old ate a whole bowl (and was up crying at bedtime probably from indigestion, but that's not the recipe's fault!). I love incorporating cinnamon into main courses, and the cocoa and cinnamon blends into this so subtly that you don't taste it directly, it just adds to the flavor.

How to make it without so much heat

Fantastic chili recipe, rich and deeply flavorful.  Works well with other types of beans:  I've used black and it was just as delicious.  I calculate 4 cups as two cans and don't have the "too many beans" problems others have mentioned.  You can rinse the canned beans to reduce gassiness and salt, and just put in a little extra plain water.  

I am sure that if you can take the heat of that much chili powder, this recipe is great as-is.  I cannot, so I used the following to substitute for the chili powder and flakes:  3/4 tsp chili powder, 1.5 tsp paprika (to give red pepper taste without heat), increase cinnamon to 1/2 tsp, increase cocoa to to 1.5 tsp.

I followed the recipe exactly and I thought it was good, but not great. It really needed some tomato sauce or tomato paste to give it some body. I am a big fan of Cincinnati chili, so I felt it could have used more cinnamon and cocoa powder as well. The heat from the red pepper flakes was fine for me but the kids thought it was a little to spicy.

This was a great and different chili. I had a pound of ground lamb to use and wanted to do something different. I added more onion, a chopped red pepper and two large stalks of chopped celery. I only used about 2 1/2 tbsp. of chili powder, but I added a can of Rotel. I also used a mix of one can of kidney beans, and a can of black beans, both drained and rinsed. Delicious!

I was a little scared to try this recipe.  If you like to taste while it cooks, don't!  It was notsogood during the cooking process but after sitting for a day it was good.  It's different from typical chili but not too different.

Ok yes I made a few changes....  I added two diced poblano chilis, and I used 1/2 can of tomato & basil soup.  The diced tomatoes I used also had green chilies in it.  I used 1/2 can of chili beans and 1/2 kidney beans.  This recipe will be occuring this cold winter season.

I think I'm going to have to use lamb in all of my chili recipes from now on! This was good - very flavorful. The broth was a bit watery and lacked body so I may add a little tomato paste next time. Used one can of kidneys and one can of black beans, rinsed and then added one can of water for liquid. Will definitely make this again.

I found this recipe a few years ago, and it's been in my regular rotation ever since!  Boyfriend asks me to make this chili all the time.  This recipe is great as written.  Add a little shredded mozzarella and hot sauce to garnish, and this is a great meal.

I’m nit a big chili fan but I love mole.  I had ground lamb so thought I’d try this. It produced a very deep dark rich-tasting chili that was terrific....but not to everyone’s taste. I didn’t give it lots of stars because it caused wicked heartburn.

We have our own lamb, and this has quickly become a favorite recipe.
I doubled the cumin, cocoa and cinnamon. It's quite spicy - which is good! I did temper the heat by adding honey.
Like others, I recommend rinsing the beans. I added a can of water to make up for the lost liquid.

Delicious! I'm recently on a low sodium diet, and learning to make food that doesn't taste bland without a ton of salt has been challenging. With some homemade salt free chili powder and no salt added tomatoes and beans, this made a very flavorful and healthy dinner! Estimating ~ 300 mg per serving, and that's including 2 oz of Swiss cheese and a generous dollop of sour cream to top. Yummiest thing we've made yet! Definitely a keeper. The lamb is a very tasty change from my standard beef, and the notes of chocolate and cinnamon go VERY well with the chili spiciness. Add "easy to prepare" and it's a 5 star winner!

This was good! I drained the beans because it helps to prevent gas! I made the chili as directed except I used black beans. I think kidney beans would have given it more of that chili flavor that I love! I also added a can of corn. needs a little tomato juice. I only used half the chili powder but ended up adding the rest! As I usually do, I served the red pepper flakes on the side so everyone can add them according to their liking. I will make this again.

I just made this for dinner tonight.  (1-26-16) The spice amounts were perfect and we really enjoyed it.  Some things i did differently are draining the beans; i like a less 'soupy' chili.  I also added another can of beans because it was still more soupy than 'thick'  I also added a dollop of plain Greek yogurt on top.  It was a huge hit even with my picky teenager!

I made and took this to our tailgating and it was a huge hit! I was expecting left overs but there wasn't even enough for those who showed up late. I'm already figuring out when J can make it again. Most delicious!

I loved it! I used black and white beans instead of kidney. Great flavor!

I have to admit, this is pretty tasty. I seasoned it per the recipe, but I had to stray a bit to use what I had on hand. I used 1 can of pinto beans. I'm only making this for 2, and that had the right ratio of beans/meat for my taste. Also, maybe it cut down on the liquid which made it pretty thick the way I like it. I also used 1 can of mild rotel because it's what I had. I'm surprised I liked it given the ingredients. Good recipe! We'll see how my husband likes it when he gets home. He's a chef. I think he will approve.

Not sure that the teaspoon of cocoa is even detectable, so I'd just call it "lamb chili." Anyhow, made it per the recipe except only half the chili powder because I ran out. Guests said it was the best chili ever. Just spicy enough to be interesting but not punishing or sweat-inducing. I served it with wheat berries (boiled, like rice), which gave something to chew and allowed the flavor to linger longer in the mouth.

Won me second place in the chili competition! You have to have an adventurous palette, but it's really different, lean and delicious.

This is a keeper! The only changes I made were to use 1 can red kidney beans, and one can of garbanzo beans (because that's what I had), and used only 3 TBSP chili powder. So easy, so good! After I stirred in the tomatoes & beans & brought to a boil, I transferred it to a slow-cooker for 5 hours. I was going to garnish with crumbled feta, but we were so excited to eat it that I forgot all about the feta! Just the right amount of spice & flavor medley.

I made a couple of changes to fit the taste of my family better, and everyone loved it.  First, I reduced the chili powder to 2 tablespoons.  Next, I used a 28-ounce can of crushed tomatoes and one 15.5-ounce can of dark red kidney beans instead of the proportions in the recipe.  I also drained and rinsed the beans before adding them.  Finally, I used Hershey's Dark Reserve cocoa powder.  I'm sure the recipe tastes good as written, but my family would never have liked it.

The recipe was good, the combination of flavors was good but it just wasn't wow for me.  I don't know if it was the lamb or the spices or what, but it wasn't my favorite chili dish (and I love lamb, so I was surprised).  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a wonderful recipe. Went by the directions, except used fewer beans than called for.  Would lighten up on the chili powder. Ended up adding an extra can of beans to the leftover before freezing for another meal, hoping that will calm the heat down a little.
