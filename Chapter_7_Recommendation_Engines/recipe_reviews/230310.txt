Next time I'll add the taco seasoning. Good, but pretty blah.

I used 2 cups of cheese, only 1 can of corn and added half a packet of taco seasoning. Pretty good. Will try with sour cream instead of mayo next time.

Very good!! I did sub the mayo out and used sour cream instead. Added 1/2 pkg of taco seasoning as suggested. Only 1 can of corn is lots. And used a jar of salsa instead of the can tomatoes. And sprinkled the green onion on top afterwards. Everyone loved it.

This received many compliments at our 4th of July bash!  It's a great base recipe.  I did doctor the published recipe up with some spice based on reviews, added a couple of teaspoons of Penzey's Bold Taco seasoning, a shake or two of garlic and onion powders, salt and pep.  Oh, and a shake of Tabasco, too.  I did omit one can of corn, the consistency seemed perfect to me after just adding one.  Served with Fritos scoops, and chili cheese Fritos.  A winner!  Thanks for sharing with AR.

Sorry. Tasted weird. I followed the directions but my husband didn't like it and when I tried it, I had to agree. Luckily I was sick and didn't go to the family dinner where I was supposed to bring the dip!

I made this according to the recipe, served it at a buffet, and received many compliments. Because I had doubled the recipe, there was a bit to bring home. We ate it over a period of three days, and each day it seemed to get slightly thicker, which I liked. Excellent, and now my go-to for covered dish dinners.

This was the first time I made this, so I stuck strict to the recipe. It was a huge hit at the bday party I took it to, & 5 people asked for the recipe! Next time I will add black pepper & the spicy version of rotel.

This was pretty good.  Loved the tomatoes and the pop of corn, but needed a bit more flavor.  We added a bit of chipotle tabasco and a little salsa to get a better dipping consistency so it didn't keep breaking the chips

I liked this because it was a little different than typical chip dip. It tasted great and the party guests enjoyed it! It made a lot, so I'd only bring about half for a potluck next time.
