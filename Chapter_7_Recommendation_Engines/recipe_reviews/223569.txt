This is an interesting coleslaw.  It’s sweet like a standard coleslaw, but the Catalina dressing gives it a bit of a tangy taste and I could easily detect the celery salt.  While I enjoyed this, it’s something I would only eat occasionally and in small portions.  Unfortunately, the recipe is just for the dressing and does not provide the recommended amount of coleslaw.  The description alludes to a large bag, but based on the amount of dressing this makes, I’m guessing this is a recipe for a commercial or restaurant sized package of coleslaw.  I cut the recipe in half and had enough dressing to cover 2-16 oz. bags, but I do prefer a crunchier coleslaw.

Scaled this back for a small bag of slaw mix.  Very good. Cut back on the sugar a bit.

I used light Mayo, a sugar alternative and fat-free Catalina and added a little more Catalina than the recipe calls for. Pretty tasty.

This is a good alternative to regular slaw dressing & very easy to make. I use it on broccoli slaw that I put onto fish or shrimp tacos. The extra little zing from the Catalina dressing is perfect.

Nice change from regular slaw dressing, the Catalina dressing gives it a little more zip.  I used light Mayo instead of Miracle Whip, but other than that followed the recipe.  Next time I may even put a little more Catalina than the recipe calls for.  Will make again.
