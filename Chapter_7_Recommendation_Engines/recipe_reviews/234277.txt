this was excellent. I sprayed my tinfoil with cooking spray thinking that would keep the cheese from sticking, but it didn't. The flavor was delicious, just enough kick. Next time I think I will skip the cheese until we unwrap them, maybe that will keep the cheese on the corn. Will definitely make again & again!

This recipe is delish!!!  The only changes I made was to make more of the paste, (first time I made it I felt like I could not taste the seasonings that well) also instead of chili powder I used onion steak burger seasoning. (It's my go to spice) Added some garlic powder and along with the shaker parm we put in a little bit of grated real parm that we had left over.  We also had to up the time to 30 mins.  That is perfect for us.  Also because of reviews.....we used non stick aluminum foil so no problems with any of the coating coming off!!

I think I solved the problem with the sticking to Aluminum foil. I laid the aluminum foil down then I laid parchment paper between the corn and the aluminum foil then roll them all up together. The  cheese from the corn mixture does not stick to the parchment paper and it came out perfect the corn was sweet delicious and I sure do it again.

The flavor was very good! The only reason I give it a four star rating is because after wrapping the corn with aluminum foil, the mixture stuck to the foil and very little was on the actual corn. I am currently devising a plan to help resolve this issue! Very easy, cheap, and yummy side dish.

Super tasty!  Added an extra 10 mins as well (30 total), and it was perfect.  My husband isn't a huge fan of corn, and absolutely loved this...he's asked for it several time since.

Great and very easy. I found that mine were a bit under cooked and needed 10 more min. But they were still the best corn on the cob I have ever had.

Waste of parmesan cheese - it sticks to the foil.  The taste of chili with corn just wasn't a good combo.

Ohmygoodness!!!  Who knew that fresh, sweet, corn on the cob could get any better!?!?!?  I wanted to cook a LOT of corn for company and was just looking for the appropriate time/temp for roasting in the oven --- then I stumbled upon this recipe. Talk about Dumb Luck!

Mine took a little longer to cook than listed, however, this was quick and simple nonetheless! I prepped a few extra and put them in the fridge so they could easily be popped in the oven for a quick treat :)

This recipe could use a little salt. Also - to avoid the problem that previous reviewers had mentioned with the cheese sticking to the tinfoil, I just brushed the tinfoil with butter before putting the corn in it and didn't have a single sticky cob! Decent flavour.

Great flavor but I had a similar issue of the Parmesan sticking to the aluminum foil that an earlier reviewer had. Also wish I would have added another 10 minutes cook time. All in all a very flavorful recipe.

I skipped the chili powder, otherwise it was very tasty. I use only the Reynolds non-stick foil, has a yellow stripe on box. Use it for everything,,thank you Reynolds.

I skipped the cheese altogether... used kraft Vegán mayo and subbed a few shakes of chipotle powder instead of Chile powder.  Cooked for a half hour or so... Man was this a good Vegán side dish!

My neighbor brought this to my house and we loved it!  I made it tonight and it was Wonderful!  This is my new way to make corn on the cob from now on!  The only thing I changed was not using chili and substituting a blend of chipotle and spices I had specifically for corn on hand.

Delicious!!  Love the combo of the cheese/mayo/chili powder - my only complaint is that the sauce sticks to the aluminum foil but I don't see any way to avoid that because of the cheese.  The flavor is great though!!

Of all the corn recipes on Allrecipes this one is perhaps my favorite.  When ever I fix this for company when we have barbecues my company is always surprised by it's wonderful flavor.  I never would have thought of adding parmesan cheese and chili powder but it a real winner.

I've made this recipe a few times already and it was amazing. All of my dinner guests loved it too. I plan on making it again this coming holiday weekend. Try it on the bbq instead of the oven as well!

For whatever reason, the cheese turned into a big mess inside the foil so not a great presentation. But delicious.

My whole family loved it and we scooped up the extra marinade that stuck to the aluminum foil with tortilla chips :)

My husband and I both thought it was delicious. I followed the recipe and increased the cook time to a total of 30 minutes as suggested by others. 
I sprayed the tin foil with cooking spray, no problem with sticking. Yes, some of the parm cheese did fall off and cook, but it was like having some parm crisps to munch on.
The only thing I will do different next time and yes there will be a next time, is to cut back on the chili powder a little.  Oh, and I had no fresh parsley so I used dried.   Still worked.

I really wanted to love this but I didn't. It was ok, but I wouldn't make it again. It was messy to make and eat. There are definitely better ways to flavor corn.

This is a delicious combo. I used ancho chile pepper, which is a favorite chile. The only changes I'd make next time is spray the foil with some oil (the cheese does stick, but I just scraped it off with a knife, and spread it back onto the corn), and I would also use less of the spread on each ear. Maybe one tablespoon instead of two - its just a bit overkill for my taste for corn to be that smothered in the cheese/mayo spread. Otherwise, it made grilled corn tastier than just oil, salt and pepper and was super easy to toss together.

I have actually made this recipe a couple of times and it turned out pretty well, especially the second time.

I think the oven roasting was fine, but the topping neither clung to the corn and was goopy at best in the foil.  I wasn’t a fan of the flavor even though I was the one who brought it to the meal thinking it sounded like a good blend. Possibly it didn’t work because I used fresh Parmesan from a bag instead of powdered Parmesan, which would more likely result in the appearance in the existing photos. I didn’t finish it, and I am of the generation who was told to “clean your plate” so I usually do.

I would never have thought of putting mayonnaise on corn but this corn is so very good and so easy.  I followed the recipe and add some Cajun seasoning.  Be sure and have the seam side of aluminum foil up so you don't loose a bit of this seasoning mix.

Love this recipe! It has great flavor compared to the boiled corn on the cob. Yes I will make this again!

It is good but it doesn't take much for fresh corn ( white & yellow) to taste great. I can eat it without any spices.  I'm lactose intolerant and I didn't have any dairy cheese on hand . Therefore, I made the recipe as it called for without the cheese . I will make this gain.

Used the basic recipe and loved the hint of spice form the chili powder.  I cooked an additional 10 minutes for a total of 30 and for the last five open the foil and turned the broiler on low to sear a bit.  My family loved it!

Mine didn’t melt down as much as the picture shows. I still had a nice coating of the mayo combo. But, the flavor was really great with the corn.
