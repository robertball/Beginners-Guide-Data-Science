Fantastic! Great to see you put out this staple of the Queen City. First off, the thicker chili makes it really versatile for making awesome chili cheese coneys (don't forget to add mustard and onions), or as a topping for potatoes or loaded french fries. Pro tip: cook the beef just in water for about 20 minutes. Then put it in a bowl and throw in the fridge overnight. This causes all the fat to rise to the top and solidify so you can easily scoop it off with a spoon. Then return to your pot with all the components for a nice slow simmer.  Finally, I like to add a tbs of cocoa powder to the chili while simmering. This city was known for its German heritage but this one is a shout out to our Greek immigrants. Enjoy!

Soooo good! I am of Cincinnati descent, so I had to add just under a T. of unsweetened cocoa powder to make it “authentic” Lol! Other than that, I made it as written. Tastes like home!

Love this kind of Chili from SW Ohio.  So many ways to make since being introduced in the mid '40's as Skyline Chili.  I like to go back and forth between the Cincinnati version and the Skyline version.  All that needs to be done is for Skyline is add 1 oz of unsweet chocolate and eliminate the chili powder.

I hate to give a bad review, so a 3 is as low as I can go. I am hoping my issue was a 'lost in translation' problem.

1/4 cup of chili powder? 

I always follow the instructions exactly, the first time I make it. Then I can adjust. 

I knew by the smell that, this was too spicy for me. Once the ridiculously small spoon hit my mouth I was reaching for a drink.

My daughter who loves spicy thought it was ok, but lacked depth of flavor because all she could taste was chili powder.

The family stopped into Skyline chili last summer on vacation. This version in my opinion was even better. Nice spicey bite without being too overboard on anything. The only change I made was that I halved the cloves. I was afraid of that being too overpowering. We had it traditional over spaghetti and on hot dogs. Very good recipe.

Thanks Chef John for this recipe. Just moved from Cincinnati to Florida and was missing my chili. We also enjoy five ways (with beans) and hot dogs with chili, cheese, onions and mustard. You’re right, you either like it or hate it.

Amazing how the humble ingredients (hamburger, tomato paste) can end up so tasty.

This is delicious. I love the mix of spices and it's just slightly hot. I added the onions and cheese which I think is a must.

I wanted to love it. Chef John's recipes have never let us down, but it wasn't something we liked. It smelled really good, but I think the spaghetti and cheese just didn't work with it. I kind of feel it needed some green olives in there for a few salt bombs. Maybe serve over spaghetti squash or something.

Another Chef John success! And an added bonus if there's a heaven on earth smell it's our house right now. Oh my! We did 1/2 recipe and it was more than plenty for 2 with leftovers. I agree with stopping the simmering earlier otherwise it would be too dry.

I'm from Texas so I omitted the allspice, and cloves. I added a smidge more of cumin, garlic, salt and tomato paste. I have never made a "4 way" without a Gold Star or Skyline seasoning packet, but I don't have any. This is a good alternative. My husband, who was born in Cleveland and had many a Skyline and Gold Star, told me, "Don't forget that recipe! It's delicious!" It's been a long time since I've seen him eat that much and put the leftovers in the fridge! (You ladies know what I'm talkin' 'bout!) Thanks, Chef John!
02/03/2020  My husband has requested this made again today! He loves this recipe!

Delicious! I'll make it again.
Makes a lot. Next time, I'll make half the recipe.
Took longer than expected. Simmering the sauce at medium-low wasn't enough heat to make it get thick. After an hour, it was still very watery. I cranked it up to medium-high heat, and that did the trick.
I read some other recipes and saw that many folks put in some chocolate. So I put in 2 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder. There are so many flavors happening, I don't know if it made much difference. But it sure didn't hurt!

This is not a bad Cincinnati chili recipe. Better than most. However, it falls short of Skyline. I live in Cincinnati and I have made every chili recipe trying to find something like skyline. All have been good, BUT NOT LIKE SKYLINE.

This is great. Very much like skyline chili but much better.
