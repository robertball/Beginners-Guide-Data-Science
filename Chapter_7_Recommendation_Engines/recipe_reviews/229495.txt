This recipe is easy to throw together and my husband loved it just the way it was!  No ingredients add to change the recipe.  It was good staight out of the oven and even better the next day.  I will definitely make again.

Whole family enjoyed this tasty dessert. Made by 9 and 10 yr old grand girls. Topped with whipped cream. Didn't realize until dessert was eaten that the girls only used only one can of the filling. There were a few dry parts on top but I just mixed whole dessert together before serving.

Just made this for the family and it is absolutely delicious.  Instead of melting the butter I just cut two cubes into slivers and laid them on top before I put it in the oven. I will definitely be making this again.

Yes I put a little different spin on it.... Instead of using yellow cake mix I used the muffin mix called cinnamon toast crunch, and I added about a half cup of walnuts, and a half cup of golden raisers. It turned out fabulous!

tried this recipe for a Christmas party that I was attending. I was pressed for time and this was just what the doctor order. Simple, easy, required little time and very few ingredients. Wow couldn't have asked for anything simpler.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I didn't have the brown topping. However, I made it again and this time grated butter over the top, with much better results.

This was just what I was looking for to use some fresh apples from the tree!  It was super easy and super yummy!  My husband and 4 sons like this better than the pie crust cobbler I usually make.  Will make again and again!

I did not make this dump cake but I have made a cherry dump cake.  I wanted to share my experience with the butter.  Instead of melting the butter, I froze it.  Then I used a salad shooter (a grater would also work) and grated the frozen butter over the cake.  Simple and no dry spots.  Worked great.

I used a pastry dough blender to cut the butter into the cake mix. The butter distributed evenly. This is an easy and delicious dessert.

I made this with Blueberry Pie Filling and even though I screwed it up, put butter over berries then added cake mix, it was Delicious.

We are making it tonight with Apple Pie Filling and Lemon Cake Mix, because that is what we picked up by mistake.  Can't wait to try it.

Tomorrow, for Easter, I am making it with Pumpkin Pie Filling and Carrot Cake Mix.  I hope it turns out as good as I imagine.

We are definitely having fun playing with this recipe. Maybe next we will try Cherry Pie Filling with Chocolate Cake Mix. Thanks for sharing.

I was skeptical that a boxed cake mix would work for a cobbler, but it worked great! Granted, I only had white cake mix in the pantry, so it was a softer (less crunchy) consistency than probably yellow cake mix or a typical cobbler recipe would make... but it was still yummy! Made this for my 70 year old dad and he said it tasted “just like Mama...” [my grandma] “...used to make.” So that’s a huge compliment!!! Another note: I only had unsweetened apple pie filling, so I added maybe 1/8 c brown sugar and a light sprinkling of apple pie spice to the top of the apples before I added the cake mix or butter. It was good, not too sweet at all! And it only took 50-55 minutes to cook, so check on it when it starts smelling!

My 87-year-old Mom had a similar recipe that called for one stick of butter. I had tasted hers so I did the same. I had 2 cans of pie filling  - one apple and one cherry - so I used both and called it a mixed fruit cobbler. I sprinkled some cinnamon/sugar mixture on the top and that put it over the top. Nothing else needed. Hubby loved it!!

Made this for the folks. Was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was. The only thing I changed was instead of using melted butter on top, I sliced semi-cold butter and placed it evenly over the cake mix. It blended perfectly while cooking and made the top so

Real good and real easy. Add a little ice cream or whipped topping and it feels the need for something sweet after dinner. I would like to try it with cherry or another pie filling.

Very tasty! 
I used spiced apple pie filling, then added walnuts, cinnamon, and cloves. I attempted to grate the butter -- kind of a messy disaster. Will try another method next time.

Love this easy recipe!  I've made it several times and it's wonderful.   This time I added a little caramel sauce over the apples  as a variation and it was  wonderful.  I'd love to add a few nuts but one person doesn't like nuts.  Great recipe and thanks for sharing!!!

YUM! This was so incredibly easy and unbelievably good! Our family was thrilled (and I imagine if you brought this to a get together people would think you spent hours preparing it!)

I made this super easy apple cobbler...actually it was so delicious I made it twice in one week!  I made it for a potluck at work not a crumb left. The person that ate the last of it even washed my cake pan as she asked for the recipe as did many others. Made it again a few days later for my family 4th of July picnic again a huge hit so much so now they want me to make it for our family reunion in a few weeks. The only thing I did different was follow some advise on other reviews by shredding the butter over the top vs using melted butter..perfect!!

Use 3 cans apple pie mix next time. Used apple pie spice
Sprinkled oats on top of cake mix.
Slice butter thin and put on top.

I used a spice cake mix and still felt like this needed a bit more kick.  I probably would have like this better with cherry pie filling than Apple.  Next time, I think I will add some oats for more of a crisp as I like a bit more texture.
