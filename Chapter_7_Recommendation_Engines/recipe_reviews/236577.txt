I love this soup!  It's super easy to make.  I use spinach instead of watercress because it's so hard to find.  And I add a lot more liquid.

I made some changes based on what we had on hand and what we liked. I took another suggestion and used spinach instead of watercress and added meatballs. I also added carrots as my little one loves carrots. I did half chicken broth and half beef broth. It was very good and we have made it repeatedly!

This soup was amazing! And so simple. I'd never had watercress before and I'm glad I tried it, it gave the soup a unique flavor that I really enjoyed. You could add spinach instead as some other reviewers suggested but I would highly recommend sticking to using watercress. My only critique would be that I had to add A LOT more liquid.

For as simple as the ingredients are in this soup, it is really, REALLY good! I do love my cream-based soups, but this was nice and light, and I actually felt good eating it! I did not have watercress on hand, so I used spinach, which worked great in this and only regular chicken broth (no low sodium on hand), but I didn't find it salty at all. I may add some mini meatballs next time, just because I think they would be yummy in this. I doubled the recipe. This is simple, fresh and delicious...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

spinach instead of watercress, chives and parsley.  Its perfect for a quick light soup. For something a little heartier I might sautee some chicken with garlic in butter but as is is a nice refreshing light soup.  so YUM

Excellent!  Added a few things to it.  Sautéed up mushrooms, garlic, sliced carrots, scallions, and spinach.  Added in some chopped up grilled chicken that I had left over.  Will make again and kids loved it!!

Awesome soup and quick to make.  I have never bought or used watercress, but I always have fresh spinach on hand.  I also used a refrigerated tortellini instead of frozen.  Not a fan of the frozen.  I'll make this over and over and over again!

I absolutely love this soup! The recipe is great as is or as a springboard to creating your own version if you are adventurous! For my own version, I added about a 1lb of cooked chicken, a couple handfuls of coin carrots, 4oz of baby bellas, a small amount of red onions, and some minced garlic all sauted in some butter (2 tbls.), then I topped it off with the spinach and scallions to my liking. I also added more chicken broth to compensate for the extra food items in the pot. Delicious!

This is excellent as written. The second time I made it I had a lonely large mild Italian sausage left from a cook out. I took it out of the casing fried and crumbled it up and added it to the soup. So good. I also used spinach as that is all I had.

We make tortellini in broth quite often. This recipe differs slightly with the addition of the watercress, scallions and hot sauce. I substituted spinach for the watercress, as that's what I had on-hand, and made my own homemade chicken broth from the carcass from last night's "spatchcock chicken" (recipe also from this site). This was a quick, and easy weeknight meal after a long day at work. I really liked the additions, and will make it this way again.
