This was an amazing simple recipe that required only a few ingredients. I used frozen broccoli instead of fresh, but it turned out great. I also added a bit more garlic, some lemon pepper season, italian seasoning, and freshly grated parmesean. Instead of putting it all in a bowl, I found it better to saute the oil, garlic, and pasta together for a few minutes. YUM!!!

Great recipe - I added crumbled feta and a few red pepper flakes - and that really made a difference!

I made this dish tonite for my family.My kids rated it an 8 on a scale 1-10.Of course I had to throw in my own twist.I added minced onions w/ the garlic. I used 2TBs butter along w/ the oil and added a splash of milk to make it creamy.Sprinkle parmesan cheese on top and WALA youve got a meal as good as Olive Garden.

I cooked the garlic/ olive oil mixture first then set it aside so that the flavors can blend.

The best recipe ever! The whole family loved it. Although we did add some grilled chicken so for us it's called the 'One Dish Non-Vegetarian Vegetarian Dinner'.

Ridiculously easy for a credible dinner. I added lemon pepper some Mrs. Dash (garlic & herb) and parmesean cheese -- otherwise it was too bland. Also reduced the amount of olive oil since it tends to always be too much no matter which recipe I use.

As I'm new to vegetarian cooking I'm finding that I need more spice. I used grapeseed oil instead of olive oil--it's lighter and actually just as good or better for you. I added basil oregano greek seasoning red pepper flakes onion extra garlic and fresh bruschetta. As someone else suggested I added the oil and garlic mixture right to the pasta after it was done cooking. I'd make this again adding more spice.

This was good. But I had to add alot more garlic than it called for and that made it better. It tasted fine but overall seemed to be just a bit too boring. I will try it again and tweek it a bit.

This dish was quite bland. Maybe the suggestion to "steep" the oil and garlic longer would have helped. I added red pepper flakes which made it bland and spicy.

Kids loved it because it was plain. Good hot summer night dish because it is light. The black olives added something I didn't think I would like.

Family started a tradtion about 3 yrs ago called " Meatless Monday" so I'm always on the look out for new recipes.. Like the others I found this bland and in need of more flavor.. the cheeses were a good idea or a simple cheese sauce for a more " fancy ' mac and cheese ' will probably not make again

Loved how quick and easy this recipe was! And it was something a little different. Followed other's advice though and made a few changes. Used very small amount of oil with pressed garlic and drizzled over penne and broccoli. Also added some feta cheese and a grated Italian cheese blend while noodles were still hot. Tossed with a little garlic powder onion powder and a little sea salt. Tasted great!

Good easy simple recipe. I didn't use as much oil just 1/3 cup. I added some lemon juice and salt free garlic and herb. Sprinkled with some feta. I also used noodles made out of veggies. Will make again.

Really enjoyed this. Made some minor changes based on reviews and personal preference. Used whole wheat angle hair pasta. Added an onion and mushrooms. Used a combination of garlic and basil infused olive oils and just added a little at a time until amount I wanted (about 1/4 c.). Added fresh basil and Parmesan cheese when I mixed the pasta with the olive oil/veggies. Oh and used a combination of black and green Greek olives. The olives added a unique taste to this dish. Very good! Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe! The whole family ate it which is saying quite a bit. Not even close to a one-dish dinner though. One pan to steam the broccoli one pot to boil the pasta and one pan to sautee the garlic. But it was worth it. I added halved cherry tomatoes.

Me and the family found this recipe to be a bit bland and overly oily.I added some pesto and parmesan that made it a bit better but I couldn't take away the oil once it was added.

I completely remixed this recipe. I used spinach squash cut in quarters cheery tomatoes Italian seasoning and fresh parm. Seasoned it with Himalayan salt minced garlic and cracked pepper. My vegetarian daughter liked it.

This was pretty bland though it could have been my fault. I substituted minced garlic in a jar for the garlic cloves but there was really no flavor whatsoever. A little cheddar cheese (I didn't have parm or romano) and a little italian seasoning thrown in there made it edible. I may try it again with different cheese and cloves.

I loved this although my son says he wants protein so next time I will try to add some chicken or cook it on the side for him. Would double feta amount for next time. Used 2 cans of whole olives and added 1 diced tomato and Parmesan.

I made this dish last Thursday I did make one change to it because I one of the people I was feed doen't care for penne pasta so instead I used a "salad macaroni" noodle. We all loved it! I really liked it because it is on the mild side when it comes to spices allow one to easily season to taste. I would give this recipe 5 stars. Because of how easy it is to make and how adaptable the recipe is if one wished to change it to include meat. Chicken could very easily be added to this by simply using a pre-cooked chicken or as I entend to do the next time I make it I will allow time to cut-up and brown some skinless/boneless chicken breast into bite size pieces and cook them so that they are still warm when added to the rest of this dish.

I liked this alot I would definitely double the called for garlic next time I make it. I do appreciate how fast it was. As tip - when your noodles are almost done boiling add the broccoli and finish cooking the noodles. The broccoli is just right and you have less dishes and save time!

When I first decided to make this recipe I thought well it will be something to get by with tonight expecting it to be somewhat bland.. But it was absolutely delish with a little less oil doubled the minced garlic crumbled feta cheese and some red pepper added in. I will definately be making this again and often. Thank you so much for the recipe!

This was delicious!  I sauteed the broccoli and garlic in the oil before adding to the pasta instead of blanching it, and I added garlic salt and pepper to the pasta.  I also used gluten free pasta.  Even my picky kids ate it (minus the olives)!
