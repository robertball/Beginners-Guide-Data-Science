The soup was really good! I didn't have fresh tarragon so I used dried but I still wanted the green in my soup so I put in some fresh spinach.  When I served it, I topped it off with a little bit of Monterey Jack cheese. Had leftovers for lunch.  I'll make it again.

So delicious! I had leftover chicken that I didn't have any plans for and found this recipe. I eat low-carb/keto, so this was perfect! I made a half batch and the ingredient amounts were spot on...I wouldn't change a thing!

Excellent! I seasoned my chicken breast with garlic powder & sea salt prior to sautéing it. I used 4 garlic cloves instead of 3 (I love garlic!!!) It actually enhanced the flavor of the soup, in my opinion. I used 3/4 cup of grass-fed butter instead of 1/2 cup. I used Bella mushrooms, they seem to have a firmer texture. This soup is sooo yummy. Will definitely be making this again!!!

This was delicious! I did what another reviewer did and added spinach for more greens. I also am not a big dairy fan so I only used 8 ounces of whipping cream and it was delicious! Absolutely making this again

This was so delicious and we absolutely loved it! I made a few substitutions, like coconut oil for half of the butter and coconut cream for 3/4 of the heavy cream (only used 1/2 cup of cream, with 1 1/2 cups of coconut cream) since my goal was to make it a little healthier and hopefully not lose the wonderful flavor. It worked. I might even try all coconut cream next time. I didn’t have time to run out and get the fresh tarragon, but happened to have a nice  dry Parisienne mix of chives, dill weed, basil and tarragon. We added some fresh spinach, just before serving. Will definitely be making again.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!  On this cold winter day, satisfies so much!  I did use have the butter, and baby bellas as I like their flavor better.  I also added a dab of sour cream on my 2nd bowl, adding just a touch of tang & was also delicious! 

If you want to thicken without adding carbs, a touch of arrowroot powder or almond flour also works.  I like the almond flour better here.

This was delicious! I used about half the butter when sautéing and added 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes & thinly sliced kale during the last 5 minutes of boiling. So good that we are making this a regular family dinner.

Excellent taste! Easy to make. I used pre-cooked smoked, shredded chicken. Other than that shortcut, followed the recipe as written. Very nice. Next time I might pulse a cup in the blender and reintegrate it into the soup for a little thickness. But it’s great as is!

Super tasty and very popular at my house. I love mushrooms and this was enough to satisfy my strongest craving for them. Very rich soup - I'll definitely be making this again!

Excellent soup and even better since it's low-carb! I scaled this down to four servings, using only 2 tblsp of butter and added a little olive oil and 1 cup of heavy cream, and dried tarragon. Personally, I would saute the onion first and then add the chicken, reducing the saute time. The chicken chunks turned into shredded, although it was still delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

This soup is too delicious! I stayed close to the recipe but there are so many calories in a serving that I decided to go about half 'n half with the cream and milk. It is so good though, that I'll just enjoy it and try to get rid of the calories the next day. A keeper! Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent recipe.  SOOOO good!  The only note ill mention is that you can use half the amount of butter and this still tastes excellent.  I found that the original amount was pretty excessive.

I'm not used to soup with so much fat, but the flavor was good and my husband enjoyed it.  If I make the soup again, I will cut the butter way down.  I’d also brown the chicken and sauté the other ingredients in a sauté pan, then transfer to the soup pot.  I think I’d enjoy a little more browning, which is hard to get in a sea of butter.
