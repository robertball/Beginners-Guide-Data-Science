This is the recipe I grew up on... My mother used to do it all the time and i was searching for the recipe... Thanks

By the way, I have used dark brown sugar instead of white... Tastes better

Thank you so much for posting this recipe! We've been trying to make Harisseh at home for a while but it kept coming out hard and we weren't sure how to fix it.  I tried this recipe and followed the instructions (didn't use almonds in the dough as we didn't have any chopped ones on hand) and it came out wonderfully.  The sugar syrup was too sweet for me, but the harisseh was tasty even without it.  I will definitely be making this again!

I made these cookies for a Moroccan-themed dinner at a friend's house so I could use the rose water I brought back from a trip to Morocco. In the text of the recipe, note that you should mix 1/2 C sugar to the flour mixture, not 2 cups. I omitted pouring the syrup over the cookies since I wanted them crispier and not so sweet. I used a 12x8 teflon baking pan so they would be thinner & crispier. Also, I didn't blanch the almonds since I was short on time and they turned out fine. I served these cookies with peeled, sliced oranges (cut in 1/2" rings) sprinkled with cinnamon. The rose water was subtle and added a unique flavor.

Not very tasty, but also not sure what it should taste like.  I followed the exact recipe, but it came out crumbly and just the flavor of Rose.
