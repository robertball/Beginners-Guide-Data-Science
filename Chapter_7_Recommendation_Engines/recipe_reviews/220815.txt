I loosely followed the recipe as I only needed 2 servings.  I added a chopped yellow squash and a chopped zucchini for more veggies.  I used low fat basil-tomato instead of Parmesan cheese--it came out beautifully!  We loved it!  Very tasty, filling and low cal/fat.  Will definitely make it again.  Note: the veggie filling would also make a wonderful omelet.

Made this for the family as we are trying to have a meatless meal introduced into our diet.  Unfortunately none of my family enjoyed this. There was a definite lack in cohesive flavor. The spinach, tomato etc completely turned out to not be a flavorful combination. The Portobella taste was lost to the funky taste and texture of the filling.  Unfortunately will not be trying again.  * Also, the avocado did nothing to help the taste.   Sorry for the not so great review. Thank you for the recipe.

Add a little goat cheese in the spinach mixture for a tasty, protein replacement meal.

I followed the recipe mostly, and we found it good, but not great.  I added the filling and cheese before baking the mushrooms.  This got everything to the same temperature and let the cheese brown a bit.  As for the filling, it needs an acid, perhaps either red balsamic vinegar or red wine.

We love this recipe!! I usually serve it over white rice, and sometimes use guacamole instead of just plane avacado on the top for extra flavor. Surprisingly tasty for such diverse ingredients!
