excellent bread. I use 1 1/2 cups of raisins and boil them with 1/12 cups of water and 1 1/2 tsp. baking soda until a froth forms then turn off and let cool, once cooled, drain liquid. This keeps the bars a little more moist longer. My doctor loves this recipe.

I loved this bread - good trail food or for a quick snack.  Sunflower seeds are a must - they give it a nice texture and flavor.  I increased the applesauce and reduced the oil a little.  Keeps well in the fridge or freezer.

Just finished baking and eating one.  They are delicious and will be taking some to my husband's cardiologist.  I used egg substitute instead of eggs; used Canola oil as supposed to be good fat; used light salt.  I will have these around all the time from now on.  Thank you!

Excellent packable recipe for backpacking.  Leave the wet & dry ingredients and change only the fruits & nuts to suit your taste.  Baked this in a 9x13 pan, cut into squares and wrapped in foil.  This bread held its shape, did not crumble and remained delicious on a week long backpacking trip.  I was a little skeptical about its integrity after it was jammed into a 38 lb. pack, but to our surprise the bread came out unscathed.  Plus the taste is good to boot.

Yummy!  Usually I don't like raisins but this was good with the raisins.  I didn't have any sunflower seeds so I used chopped walnuts.  This is a very versatile recipe.....add or subtract whatever.  I thought it was a little on the sweet side, so next time I will cut back on the honey and/or brown sugar. It makes A LOT...must be eaten in 3-4 days or it will become dry. I will definitely make this again and see how well it freezes.

Yum!  The sunflower seeds give this bread a wonderfully nutty flavour and the texture is very hearty and filling.  Definitely will be making again.

This is a good base recipe, for a clif bar like snack, but tastier, and endlessly versatile. They can be a little dry, so I suggest being liberal with the wet ingredients and I individually wrap and freeze them.    

My alterations:
Double the dried fruit, cranberries are my favorite but I usually use a mix. And like other reviewers I soak the fruit. 

I put at least a cup of sunflower seeds (toasted, it makes a big difference) and sometimes other nuts.  

I've played around with the oil-applesauce ratio, and honestly never notice much of a distance, I also add about 1/2 c of peanut butter. 

I never put more then 1/2 c brown sugar.  And add cinnamon, because cinnamon is always good.

This recipe is delicious and versatile. I really like that you can vary the fruits and nuts you add to the bread. I added chopped dates and put in Sunsweet Fruit Puree oil substitute for the oil. They came out good but they weren't as moist as I'd hoped. Next time I will increase the honey to make that flavor more pronounced. I have a feeling peanut butter would be great in these too. I baked these in muffin pans and am enjoying them for breakfast and for a pick me up for the gym. These will travel and freeze well. Thank you so much!

It's really yummy, and it tastes really nutritious.  I like the sunflower seeds and the texture.  Can pass as a graola bar, but has a more bread like texture.  I used only 1/4 c of oil and 3/4 c of applesauce to try and cut down on the fat even more.  Other than that, I hope u guys all enjoy!

Very good!  I don't usually like quick breads that are too dense, but I like the flavor that honey and molasses lend to this one.  The sunflower seeds is a must for added texture.

I did not like this at all! to be fair it is the only logan bread recipe i have ever tasted, so maybe I just don't like the bread but to me the flavors just didn't mix well. I also don't see why it is 'perfect for camping or hiking' because I don't think it would keep very well.

Not sure why you need to put this in two 9 inch pans. I just put it a 9 x 13 and cooked it for the same amount of time. The oats, nuts and fruit make it a good hearty and dense bread. 36 servings is a little on the small side. I did add a teaspoon of cinnamon since I felt it needed some kind of spice. And I prefer cranberries over raisins. I have better luck when I reduce the cooking time 5 minutes and reduce the oats to 1 cup. Doesn't seem as dry.  I add hemp protein powder.

The only thing I changed was using dried cranberries instead of raisins. These are very delicious and do perk you up a bit. I only needed 40 minutes to cook each one using silicone bakeware.

Great recipe for camping/back packing etc.  I love the idea to freeze it and use it when you need it.  Better than "powerbars"

Made this recipe last nite.  I ran out of honey so I added corn syrup to make up what I was missing.  I also used craisins instead of raisins.  I did use the additional applesauce for moistness.  I also used whole wheat pastry flour instead of the regular whole wheat flour. It was ready in about 35 minutes.  Had it for breakfast today and it was awesome.   I don't want to share it with my family.  It tasted better cooled than right out of the oven.  It's very different from all the other baked breads and cookies I usually make.

This turned out great! I made the recipe exactly as the original called for except that I added perhaps 1/8 cup less oil (not sure if that made a difference or not). Next time I will add other things like pumpkin seeds or cranberries. I wasn't sure what the texture would come out as but it's nice, dense, and chewy without being obnoxious. The molasses adds a lovely sweetness and color and I may try next time to add more molasses and less honey and oil for a richer color and more bitter taste. All in all excellent.

Very easy to make and very tasty.  I went a little crazy in adding more ingredients.  I added a handful of coconut flakes and some sesame seeds for some more crunch.  Very good.  I look forward to trying different types of dried fruits in this recipe.  Definately a keeper.

The best Logan bread recipe I've found. I tweak it a bit by substituting oil for more apple sauce. The more you do this the chewier the bread will become. I also usually reduce the quantity of sunflower seeds and make up the volume with pine nuts and flax seeds.

Excellent! I used chopped apricots and dried cranberries in place of the raisins, and a combination of sunflower and flax seeds. This recipe also halves easily (in case you've only got one 9x9 pan like I do!).

I make these to eat at work for a mid morning snack.  Perfect for breakfast.  Not too sweet, but lots of substance.  Goes fairly well with coffee.  I just make them in a 9x13 cake pan.  Cut and individually wrap, put in the freezer and they are ready to grab and go in the morning.  Thawed and ready to eat at 10AM!  I omitted the rasins and even used strawberry applesauce that the kids didnt like.  Tasted great!

I won't be making this again.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I made it into 3 loaves instead of the two squares ones. This was so incredibly dry I had to add 1 full cup of orange juice just so I could get all the dry ingredients incorporated!  I kept checking over the ingredients to see if I had missed something but, no, I hadn't. 
The baked result was dry also.  I made it acceptable for eating by toasting and buttering the slices but I won't be making it again and I've got 3 loaves to get through.

FANTASTIC recipe!  This bread came out great--absolutely beautiful--and delicious.  I used raisins and figs and eliminated the seeds this time, which made it taste like a Fig Newton cake.  Really yummy--my 5-year old couldn't get enough!!  Thanks!  Perfect to take along camping for breakfast.

This quick bread was a hit!  Both my dad and my boyfriend loved it.  The only thing I changed was to cut out the sugar and increase the honey to about a cup.

This recipe was awesome!  I love to eat it as a snack with a cup of hot tea.  I added 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and used dried cherries instead of raisins!

I love this! Great for breakfast, snack or anytime! Yes, you definately should make sure you use the sunflower seeds. Makes for a great texture. They freeze well too.

I skipped the sunflower seeds and added more raisins. I think you could use less sugar in this, maybe just 1/2 c. But it's very good as is and it freezes well.

Delicious! I followed the recipe as written except for swapping craisins for the raisins. I made it into 5 mini loaves and baked them for 32 minutes. Love the crunchy texture and the sweet molasses flavor.

This recipe is called "THE ORIGINAL" and I've made it and variations of it  for well over 20 years.  
Others recipes work as well, find something that works for you. 
Some are too dry, some too flaky, some too sweet, some not sweet enough....Guess what, each one meets a certain requirement.  Some need a hard-tack to hump on the trail, some want a softer one to eat as a hearty snack.

We love healthy foods and all the ingredients sounded good. But the results were very disappointing. Very dry and not much taste.

I cut this recipe in half and cooked in an 8x8" pan.  I did add a little extra applesauce.  I used all white whole wheat flour and it turned out great.  My only complaint is that there is a LOT of sugar in this with the brown sugar, honey and molasses.  Will fool around with this and if I have success, will get back to it. (or even if I don't ).

The taste is very good.  I made a 1/2 recipe and cooked it in a bread pan.   Be sure to smooth out the top before cooking, as it doesn't move while cooking.   Mine is pretty lumpy on top, but still very good.

This will be a great bread for backpacking or canoeing in the backwoods!!  For my taste I will cut the sunflower seeds and add some apples and or crasins.  Maybe test with some cinnamin.

Other wise I loved that it was not as dense as other recipes I have tried, I definitely reccommend this recipe!!

I have been making this bread for years now because of a wheat sensitivity I substituted Spelt flour for the wheat & all-purpose flours, comes out very taste every time

These bars are wonderful. I make them once a week for my husbands lunch and for afternoon hikes in the mtns. I follow the recipe but add extra dried fruit, extra nuts and flax seeds. I also add more sunflower seeds. I cut back the oil once and replaced it with more applesauce. They were too dry so went back to original recipe. My husbands fast-food friends at work love them which is quite a compliment. I have never had to freeze them but even after a few days in a Ziploc they are still yummy and delicious. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This is fantastic.  It is very filling.  I would like to have the nutritional information so I can figure out how many points it would be for Weight Watchers.  Will definitely make it again.  I don't care too much for raisins in recipes, so I substituted dried cranberries.  I didn't have any oil, so I substituted 1 Tbsp butter and 1/2 cup water.  It still turned out good.

I love this bread.  I used craisins instead of raisins and I add 1/4C of flax seed to the recipe as well for added nutrition.  Keep in airtight container or freeze for best results.

This bread was just okay.  I didn't find it really that good and it was a bit on the dry side.  Probably won't make again.

I really liked this bread. I loved the idea of wrapping them individually and freezing them. I took other reviewers suggestions and cut the oil and instead used more applesauce.  I used dates and sunflower seed but next time I think I'll try cranberries. They are very filling... a quick and easy snack!

i made this bread as directed & really love how flavorful it is. the only downside seems to be the dry texture which explains the need for individual wrapping. used full flavor molasses & dry roasted sunflower seeds. packed some bars for a weekend trip & froze the rest for another time. thanks ln.
