And by four stars, I mean with the changes suggested by others- I seasoned the chicken for extra flavor, and used garlic, Parmesan cheese and other seasonings in with the filling. With those changes it was really good!

Its a great base recipe!! I saw the bland comments and wanted to make sure people dont RINSE their artichokes. Also I added some cooked crumbled bacon, about 4 peices. It added a nice salty flavor!!

We liked the idea of this recipe, but the filling was rather bland.  Overall it tasted ok and had a great texture and presentation, but if I made this again I would mix in stronger cheese, along with quite a bit of garlic, onion and herbs for more flavor.

I made this dish for my kids, husband, mother and step dad and the adults LOVED it!!  The subtle flavor of the artichokes and ricotta cheese was incredible!!  My son ate it without complaints but did admit it wasn't his favorite.  My daughter, who is the pickiest eater I know, was too freaked out about the artichoke hearts and refused to eat it.  Otherwise, I'd say it was a big hit!  I did add a little parmesan to the mix and seasoned the chicken breast with some basil.  Great side dish with this is brown rice with a touch of cilantro, lemon zest and parmesan cheese.

I made some changes.  Used low fat ricotta and infused olive oil with garlic and salt and brushed it over the breasts before putting in the oven.  Also, thinking that the breasts would be too pale, I sprinkled paprika over them.  The result was a moist, delicious stuff breast that my co workers and family raved about.  Thanks for the recipe, I will definitely prepare it again.

I think the problem is the definition of "a pinch". Don't be shy with the cumin and black pepper. I also sprinkled Parmesan and the extra stuffing over the top of the chicken while it was cooking. It was very good and will be repeated.

I followed the instructions exactly; it was okay, quite bland though. I served it with Alfredo sauce and salted the chicken too. Not sure if i'd make this again.

Very bland.  Giving it a 3 star was generous.  The ricotta and spinach stuffed chicken is A LOT better!!

I want to start by saying this is an amazingly easy & super quick meal.  It has a ton of potential.   I followed the recipe fairly close, but decided to add some garlic and italian seasoning to help out the flavor, but it didn't work, it was very bland. This recipe needs more flavor, and spices.  The cumin (I doubled) isn't noticeable.  I even mixed early so the seasonings could marinate into the cheese.   I am not good at spices (don't know enough about what to mix) so I didn't put too much in.  Some one who knows what they are doing could make this amazing!

The filling was very bland so I added grated asiago cheese, some mozzarella and salt. That didn't help!  The filling was too runny also.  I won't be making this again.

I agree with the other reviewers that this was rather bland. No one in my family cared for it. Adding Parmesan cheese, which was suggested by other reviewers, would be a good idea.

The ricotta mixture was bland. I upped the basil, cumin, and added oregano, onion powder and salt and pepper.
 30  minutes cooking time was too long for 8 ounce breasts. Reduced the time to 22 minutes. 
Brushed the top of the chicken with kitchen bouquet to give it a better look and taste. 2nd time around was much better

To add moisture, I followed another reviewer's idea and mixed olive oil, garlic, and salt to brush over the top of the chicken.  After I had already stuffed and rolled the chicken, I realized I had forgotten the basil, so I added that to the oil mixture as well.  It ended up fine, but next time I will add the basil in the cheese mix.  In the description of the recipe, it suggests serving with pasta sauce, so that is what I did.  I used a four cheese tomato sauce and it added just the right touch to the chicken.
