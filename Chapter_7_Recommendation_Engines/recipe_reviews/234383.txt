These are delicious! Typically served in Italy around the holidays, this is similar to "Torta gorgonzola, mascarpone, e noci". The cream cheese adds a nice twist to the flavor. Stuffing the mixture inside a date is simply genius. Thank you for the recipe.

I REALLY liked these. Give me a sweet and salty combination any day! I warmed the gorgonzola with the softened cream cheese in the microwave for a few seconds before mixing it together, put it in a piping bag with a tip wide enough for the gorgonzola cheese crumbles to pass through, and piped the mixture into each date. I also toasted the walnut pieces. I think serving these warmed or at least room temperature is key. I also want to try these with crumbled bacon added to the cheese mixture.

I searched for a recipe using dates and cream cheese and this came up. I had all the ingredients, so I made a dozen for a snack. Super easy, no measuring necessary, quick to make, and delicious.

Easy and delicious! The vegan guests didnâ€™t sample them, which was fine. I had them all to myself!!

These are an acquired taste for sure. I usually love dates, cream cheese, walnuts and Gorgonzola...but not altogether.
