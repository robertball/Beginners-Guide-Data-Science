I made this soup late last night for dinner today and it smelled so good that my husband and I had to have some as soon as it was done!  If you love curry..and I love me some curry.. this soup is for you!  I basically followed the whole recipe, except I added about 1 1/2 tablespoons of Curry powder and a 1/2 tablespoon of Garam Masala (sp?).. I think without the Garam Masala it might have been lacking some depth of flavor...it adds a nice spicy taste (more of an earthy spicy not heat) .. if you don't have Garam on hand you could try adding some ground cinnamon, ground nutmeg, cumin and black pepper..  I also used 1 percent organic milk instead of the half and half.  And just a warning.. this soup is spicy!  But in a good way..not an overpowering spicy where you can't taste anything.  I will definitely be making this again... maybe tonight ;)  I might add some butternut squash next time.. I took a picture of the soup and I will upload soon :) Thanks for a great recipe!

WOOOWW!! DELICIOUS!! I followed a review and added ground nutmeg, black pepper, cumin and ground cinamonn. YUMMY!!! It's really good and tasty.
---------------------
I made this soup again, it's like the 5th time I make it.  I'm giving it as an appetizer for Thanksgiving dinner. I made it for a friend and she described it as: "a party of flavors".

I love pur√©ed carrot soup, and I was looking for an alternative to the usual ginger/carrot combination. I think the curry worked well with the carrots, but I will reduce the amount of curry next time. I don't have a high tolerance for spicy food, so it was a little too much for me. If you like spicy food, then this should be fine. I used regular milk instead of the half and half and it seemed to dilute the soup to a nice consistency.

Fantastic recipe! 

We changed it up a bit by adding another 1/4 lb of carrots, 3 extra cloves of garlic. Mixed 1/4 tsp of cayenne with the curry before. Replaced 1 cup of orange juice for 1 cup of chicken broth.

Turned out absolutely incredible, it had a subtle spicy flavor that wasnt even overpowering to my 7 yr old. We plan to make this quite often in the future.

Very good. Don't be afraid of the curry - it gives a nice subtle flavor that is delicious in this soup. I added other orange-fleshed vegetables - sweet potatoes and pumpkin. I left out the half and half.  It was so good and it cooked pretty quickly. It freezes well.

My husband and his guy friends raved about this soup. It's pretty easy, as soups go. Due to a dairy alergy, I substituted soy milk for cream, and it still tasted very smooth and rich. I also added a tsp ground cloves.

Love the flavor combo.  Added a little extra curry.  Made with coconut milk and my lactose-free friend thought it was great.--Made this again for my friend and I on a rainy day.  It was so delicious and comforting.  Great with bread and mimosas.

I added a little garam masala and cardamom. Turned out great. Would have been even better with some fresh cilantro sprinkled on top. Thanks!

This was lovely. It was the first time that I had ever tasted carrot soup, and I didn't quite know what to expect, but I am now a big fan. I substituted 1/2 tablespoon of the curry for an equal amount of garam marsala, put in an extra 3 cloves of garlic and a tart apple but otherwise followed the recipe, and the soup was a wonderful blend of sweet and deep, mellow spicy. I ate it with garlic bread and it was perfect together. Really, the only negative thing is that - for me at least - it took a lot longer to both saute and simmer the carrots until tender than the recipe states. About twice as long.

After reading some reviews, I used 1 Tbsp curry powder and 1 Tbsp garam masala, used only j1/2 cup cream and WOW!  TEN STARS if I could.  Easy to make using cheap ingredients and delicious!  This dish is spicy, but not tearing-and- sweating-into-your-food spicy.  More like an "OH my this is too spicy..... wait........ YUM! Perfect!

I used the suggestions of adding the cinnamon/nutmeg/pepper/cumin mix and substituted 1 can of coconut milk for the half-and-half.  I thought it was pretty good, but still missing a note on my palette - so I blended in about 1/4 c. of roasted pistachios.  It was nice, but OMG, after it sat in the fridge for a day, it was AWESOME and wasn't missing anything, so I would highly recommend making it in advance and then reheating.  This will be a definite staple in my soup repertoire!!!

I had some carrots I wanted to use up and found this recipe. Made with fat free half and half and fat free chicken broth; did not top with pistachios (didn't have any - didn't miss them). Other than that made exactly as stated. For WW followers with the fat free half and half and chicken broth this equals 3 points for a 1 cup serving. Good way to get in more veggies!

Very good soup! I might cut back on the curry for a crowd that can't tolerate too much heat, since it was a bit spicy. But still very good!

Mmmmm! The best soup I have ever had was a chunky Carrot Cashew Curry soup, and I wanted to recreate it. I have to say that with this recipe, I got pretty close. What I changed is: - Added two handfuls of roasted cashews with the curry powder - Substituted 1 1/4 C orange juice for one of the cups of broth (suggested by someone else)  I ended up having to add a LOT of salt and pepper at the end - the soup is very sweet, but turned out awesome with the additions. Be careful to not over-puree the soup so that it doesn't turn into baby food! I like mine chunky :)

This is a good base but it is missing something.  Like a previous reviewer said, it's  missing a sort of depth of flavor.  Next time I am going to try adding a 1/2 cup or so of white wine to see if that gives it a boost.

Very yummy! My modifications included: using fresh carrots from our garden, also fresh celery leafy tops from the garden. (That's the green in the photo.) I also use real chicken stock that I keep portion sizes in the freezer. Used whole milk, as suggested. Served with fresh cornbread muffins, honey & butter. Yum!

We really enjoy this soup as do our guests but because it seemed a bit too sweet I add 1/2 cup fresh orange juice.  Gives it  a lovely flavor.

Loved this recipe!    I followed the suggestion of other reviews & used 1 1/2 tablespoons of curry powder and 1/2 tablespoon garam marsala.     I substituted 1% milk and used homemade chicken broth.    The soup probably would have tasted richer and creamer with half-and-half, but it was still delicious with the low fat milk.

SUPER yummy and I do not like curry.  I used fat free half and half and it was totally wonderful.  My kids and husband loved it.

This soup was wonderful. The only changes I made was I used fat free half and half and used 1 tablespoon of curry powder and 1 tablespoon of garam masala. I ddn't have pistachos so I used cashew nuts. I will make this again.

I LOVE this soup.  My husband wasn't quite so sure but said it was "okay".  My co-worker said it looked like mustard.  Hence the 4 stars.  However, it is absolutely delicious to me, and I'll be making it again for myself :)

Oh my gosh - I wish I could have given this soup ten stars! Awesome, awesome, awesome. I decided to use the slow cooker - I sauteed the veggies and then dumped them into the slow cooker with the broth. Left on low for 8-9 hours, then pureed carrots and added homo milk instead of heavy cream. I let it simmer for another half hour or so and then served with homemade naan bread -- WOW! Fantastic for a wet cold fall night. I will absolutely be making this again! Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

We loved this soup.  I sub'd 1 cup of fat free sour cream for the dairy since I had that on hand and it worked great.I was a little afraid of the amount of curry but went with it and it was excellent.  I wish they'd have given a carrot count instead of recommending 1 1/2 lb. which I always find difficult since I don't have a kitchen scale.  I used 8 med. to large carrots and it was perfect.

This was SO delicious and comfy, and SO easy...we make it about once a week...a great way to use up carrots (we always have too many somehow) and the curry adds a wonderful kick that cures my Indian Food craving every time!  Lovely over mashed potatoes or with Naan to dip!

Absolutely loved this soup!  I used light cream and ended up using about 4 1/2 cups of low sodium chicken broth to get this to the right consistency.  Really great curry taste, but I will use just a bit less next time around (and I adore curry!).  I also used about 1 1/2 teaspoons of pumkin pie spice to sweeten this a bit.  Would be a great recipe to entertain with, and would be terrific finished with a swirl of creme fresh.  A do-again, for sure.

My husband who hates soup said I quote, "This soup is banging!!".  I added Madras Curry for a bit more spice and also a celery stalk when sauteeing the veggies.  Awesome quick and easy soup!!

Need something to warm the soul and tantalize your taste buds? Then you've found it in this soup.  I made this soup as an appetizer to Thanksgiving dinner this year(which my family has never done before, "an appetizer for Thanksgiving"? I was asked, and everyone from the kids to the grandparents loved it.  The subtle not overpowering use of curry is nice and the chopped pistachios give it that elegant touch.

While this tastes very good, my soup game out very thick--more like a pur√©e. I used 2% milk instead of whole milk and it still delicious. However, I prefer the "Cream of Carrot Soup" recipe on this site.

Awesome flavor!  Mine was a little too spicy because of the curry I used, but I was able to cut some of the heat by adding a bit more dairy.

This might also be good with cauliflower pureed into it too.

Excellent starting point. While very tasty as is, I find it needs a boost in flavor. Today, to try something a little different, I used coconut milk instead of half & half. And to add a bit more brightness, I added fresh lime juice. Oh, so tasty!

I thought it was awesome. I made a few changes based on dietary restrictions and preferences but pretty much stuck to the recipe. I added a cored, diced apple. I used coconut oil instead of butter. I also left out the sugar and used whole milk rather than half and half. Next time I would love to use light coconut milk. Nothing like the coconut curry combo. Thanks for the great recipe, as I too was looking for something more than a light summery carrot soup.

My proportions were totally off (only had 1/2 of the carrots on hand and used 2/3 of the stock and probably 3/4 of curry), but it was still incredibly delicious! Just ate two bowls by myself. ;) And the other reviewers are right - this is so rich, delicious and creamy, it doesn't need any cream or milk.

Thanks, this was an easy recipe.  I used 20 oz carrots instead of 24 oz and 2 onions since that's what I had.  It had a good flavor, but sorry, it did taste a little like baby food with milk, as another reviewer said.

I added chicken and served it over jasmine rice to make it more "dinner" instead of first course.  I also added a little red pepper to spice it up.  Delicious!

This was a hit at Christmas dinner with several guests asking for the recipe. My husband threw in more than a pinch of sugar, and I thought it was too sweet as a result.  Otherwise, easy recipe, great to take in a crock pot to a potluck or to keep warm before serving. Because it was a potluck/buffet, I opted for no garnish, which did not lack for taste.

I am not an expert on curry soups, but I'd had a carrot curry soup out and wanted to try one at home. We followed the recipe and I found that it lacked the level of heat that I wanted.

This was a GREAT recipe!  For fun, I used green curry paste instead of curry powder and it was quite potent but absolutely delicious.  Perfect for the winter.

I used 1/2 the amount of curry called for and it was still QUITE spicy- making it unsuitable for our kids, who are not fans of overly spicy food. Other than that, it has a great flavor and texture and is easy to make.

Amazing! I used spicy indian curry powder, and I left some of the carrots in chuck form and pureed the rest. It was very pretty. Also, I only had 1 pound of carrots, so I added a big potato and it was delicious served with naan!

This was ok, but something was missing for me...it felt like pureed baby food and didn't have a depth or richness I'd like in a creamed soup. I did use veggie boullion cubes because I didn't have chicken broth so perhaps this is why it lacked depth.  I have substitued veggie broth for chicken before and it's been ok.  I may try again with chicken stock and maybe adding a yam to make it a bit richer.

Fantastic way to use up carrots before they go to waste. I love curry. Served this with homemade samosas. Yummy!

An excellent soup, the only thing I would change next time is the amount of curry. It was fine for me, however my wife and 2 year old son thought it was a bit spicy. Oh yea, I also used goats milk instead of half and half and it turned out great.

this soup was absolutely fantastic!  it was great to find such a delicious recipe without ginger (not one of my favorite spices).  i didn't have whipping cream, so i used buttermilk and it turned out fine.  and i tossed in a little zucchini since i had some i needed to use up, still great.  can't wait to eat it again!!!

This soup is delicious. I used my food processor to slice the carrots and onions. I used some homemade turkey broth and homemade chicken broth. This recipe is definately a keeper, I always have the ingredients on hand.
