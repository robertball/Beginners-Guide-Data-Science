Everyone enjoyed this simple yet refreshing salad.  I used pitted, black kalamata olives and sprinkled about a teaspoon of dried oregano in before tossing.  Will make this often this summer!

Took this to a potluck yesterday and it was hardly touched.  Tasted blah.  Even added fresh ground pepper, and this was still unexciting.

This was good. Slicing the cucumbers paper-thin is the authentic and best-tasting way to go!

My son says letting it marinate, and adding some dill & it would be a "5"! Nice, easy, quick, and flavorful summer salad.

I changed the dressing a bit. I made my sweet-and-sour greek dressing to top the salad and it was much better.  I mix about 4 parts red wine vinegar to 2 parts beet juice to 1 part white sugar.  Then, I mash the feta cheese into the mixture, making sure the sugar is fully dissolved (this can be made more tart by adding more vinegar to taste or more mellow by adding more beet juice to taste).

Very bland. The ingredients seam good, the portions i think are off (5 cucumbers, 5 tomatoes, and only 1/4 cup vinegar?). If i made this again enough changes would be made to make it a different recipe.

I made this salad this morning with organic produce I picked up from Bountiful Baskets.  I made exactly as directed except for the olives then let it sit in the fridge to marinate.   It does need some salt and pepper and maybe a little oregano.  With just the wine vinegar it is a little flat.  I think that the feta and the olives should give it a little salt, but I omitted the olives (was all out) and my feta just wasn't salty.  Really light and refreshing and a great warm weather treat!  Thanks for sharing.

It's expensive, but I doubled the feta cheese volume. I'm glad I did. It's awesome to get some cheese in nearly every bite. I also doubled the olives and may add more next time. I chose the sweet route, adding about 75 drops of sweetener to the mixture, but I may try it the classic way next time. GREAT recipe. We love it.  FOLLOW UP NOTE: I prepared this the classic way the next time, following the recipe exactly, and my wife liked it better that way; I prefer the sweet version. Go figure.

This was good. I made this salad for lunch so I didn't use the amount of ingredients called for, but I did follow the recipe exactly. I think I will make this again for lunch.

Loved this recipe.  I only used 3 cucumbers and two tomatoes (because of the sheer volume of the salad) but otherwise this recipe was spot on! I cant wait to have some as leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

Quick and easy. Just a few more olives, feta and red wine vinegar makes this even better.  Next time I may use whole olives sliced in half.

Fast & easy summer salad with tons of flavor. I always add about 1 Tablespoon of capers for a nice flavor contrast.
