Outstanding bread!  The flavors meld beautifully with no competition among them.  I mixed up the ingredients and then 1/2 it.  I baked the first batch as written which was wonderful, but the second batch....  Oh my!  Added 1 extra banana, 1 tsp of banana extract, 1 tsp of coconut extract, a pinch of orange rind, cranraisins and golden raisins and then added walnuts, pecans and macademia nuts. On a side note for the second batch:  The addition of a 3rd banana meant having to cook it a little longer.  Definitely a crowd pleaser!

Killer, KILLER bread. Like ZOMG good. I had no applesauce because I haven't been able to make my own lately, so I used one cup melted butter. My family is not a fan of coconut so I left it out. (Shame on them. I'm going to go ahead and add it next time, they can stick it.) I made no other changes. I did cover it halfway through with foil to keep it from burning. So, so good. The combination of all those flavors was off the hook. Scotdog, you were dead on, girl. This one's a keeper!

Fantastic! This is the best zucchini bread I have ever had. The only changes I made were to only use 1/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup applesauce, just because I ran out of oil, and added pecans instead of walnuts. This bread is super moist, has amazing flavor, and the texture is perfect. Mine did need about 60 minutes in the oven. Thank you for sharing this with us! :)

Very delicious. I decided to make muffins instead of loaves. (Much easier to serve.) I was perhaps, a little conservative with the ingredients...it wouldn't have hurt to add more coconut and a little more brown sugar/cinnamon/nutmeg. (I'm famous for not exactly measuring ingredients, haha my fault) I didn't have any walnuts so I made it without. Husband and roommate both said they were delicious, especially with butter. It was a tad bit difficult to gauge the cooking time, but it was around 40 minutes for 12 muffins. The insides came clean off the toothpick, but upon the first taste, the muffin still seemed kind of mushy. I learned that the inside will firm up as it cools.

I've been experimenting with a lot of quick breads lately, and this is the tops!  It's so moist, and the kids couldn't get enough of it!  I also went light on the white and brown sugars, and used 2 c. WW flour and 1 cup all-purpose.  I really like the combination, what a great recipe!

5+++ This is fantastic! I used 2 cups WW Pastry & just 1 c All Purpose. Went a bit lighter on the brown sugar & replaced half the white sugar with some Splenda. Used my homemade pumpkin pie spice for the nutmeg. Subbed pecans for walnuts & left out the coconut. I'll be giving these as Christmas presents to co-workers, yum!! I also used my mini loaf Pampered Chef stone. It made 4. Thanks so much for the recipe.

One word for this quick bread DELICIOUS!! I made it exactly as written, it was simple to make and would be good with a layer of cream cheese on it. It's sweet enough and really tasty!! Thank You Tahoe Girl!! You have a winner here!! Patty

We are always trying new things to have with coffee in the mornings, and at least semi-healthy is a must for us.  This will fit in nicely for us.  I goofed and mixed up the flour amounts and so did 2 c whole wheat and 1 c white, and I made one loaf with nuts and the other without and both without coconut (trying to please the extended family's tastes).  They turned out great.  I found that when the toothpick came out clean, though, it could have used a little more cooking time, so next time I'll use the method where you touch the top of the bread and it's done if it springs back up quickly.  I like that the recipe was already made in a healthy way so I didn't have to change things.

The recipe is quite good as is, but based on what I had in stock and what we really like, I made the following changes, and it was awesome!
1) Changed the flours to 1 cup white & 2 cups whole wheat
2) reduced the oil by about 1/3 
3) didn't have any applesauce to use but used a little crushed pineapple instead (even more Carribean)
4) added one more very small banana
5) reduced the sugars by more than half and added some Splenda or Sugar Twin to replace just some of that (maybe half).
6) added some coconut as another poster mentioned (also a sweet component)
7) added about 1/2 c  chopped pecans too (actually ait was probably a little more than that, because we really love them down here in Texas)
8) tossed in a few raisins and dried cranberries too as well as about 1/3 c of flax seed.
9) lastly I added about 1/3 - 1/2 c of quick oats for a little extra fiber.

I used 4 mini loaf pans. Just make sure they are evenly spaced in the oven and check for doneness with a toothpick a little sooner than you would with the larger loaves.

Next time I may leave some of those ingredients out and try fresh chopped cranberries (for a little tartness and maybe substitute a little grated carrot for some of the  zuchini just for a little change-up

**Btw if zucchini is on sale or you just happen to have a lot on hand, grate it and freeze in 2 1/2 c portions to be ready to bake the next batch. Spread it thin in a freezer container or flat in a freezer bag for quick incorporation on short notice

WONDERFUL - even my picky husband who hates zucchini bread keeps coming back for another slice.  The bananas and the coconut give it that extra special flavor.  So very very very moist.  This is a keeper.

This is by far THE BEST zucchini bread recipe I have EVER made!  I made two batches!  The 2nd I didn't have the ripe bananas nor the walnuts so substituted a carton of vanilla greek yogurt.  Also added a little more applesauce, then used pecans.  I'm saving this one!

This is a great, healthy recipe!  LOVED IT!! I changed some things to what I had on hand.  I used 2 C of whole wheat flour, 1/2 C almond flour & 1/2 C ground flax seed.  Added an extra banana, instead of oil I added 1/2 C drained crushed pineapple, more of the 'caribbean' flair... and in addition to the vanilla extract, I added 1/2 tsp almond extract.  I had to bake a bit longer then called for but with any recipe cook it until the tooth pick comes out clean.  Great flavor!  Will be making again & again!

I made this this bread yesterday and all I can say is what a mistake.  I have been a semi-professional baker for may years and this was a true failure. I followed the recipe to the letter and it was heavy and overly bananaish. Will not make again!!

Well heck - I found I didn't have applesauce so I used plain greek yogurt and added 2 rings of canned pineapple (minced). I did decrease the brown & white sugar by half because of sweetened coconut & adding chopped craisins which are also sweet. I used light brn sugar. Used 3 cups of grated Zucchini. Also adjusted to 1/2 AP flour and 1/2 whole wheat. Baked in 4 small loaf tins for time recommended and they turned out so moist and flavorful. I forgot to flour pans after using non-stick spray but it didn't cause a problem. I did add 1/2 tsp ground coriander as well as lemon zest and 2 tblsp lemon juice. You can add your own twist to this recipe. I couldn't stop eating it - no butter or crm cheese spread required. I did freeze two mini loaves wrapped in foil and once thawed; just as yummy. Will be making again with my minor adjustments.

Absolutely AMAZING! Me and the little guy made this together today, and let me just say that there was flour (and everything else) flying, lol. We had the best time and the results made it all the more special! I used my tube pan and just poured all the batter in there and that worked out perfectly. I made this exactly as written and would not change a thing! Tahoegirl, a BIG thanks to you and your Grandmother, for a truely delicious recipe that I will be making OFTEN, and for the great memories that were made today with my son! :)

Another reviewer is correct in saying "This is  KILLER zucchini bread."  I cut the sugars in half -- and it was perfect! Lots of compliments from co-workers. Don't forget, the coconut adds its own sweetness.  Be careful with the nutmeg.  I added a few extra grains, and it was too much for my taste.  Great recipe for the green monsters clawing their way out of the garden this time of year.

so good!  I used a half cup coconut milk instead of the oil, and omitted the shredded coconut because I didn't have any.  The only other changes I made were; 1. to use 2 cups whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup quinoa flour and a half cup oat flour instead of using all purpose. 2. half cup white sugar and three quarters cup brown.
It was the the best loaf, banana zucchini or otherwise that I have ever made.

***I threw in a quarter cup ground flax and some wheat bran the second time I made it (left out a little whole wheat flour) and it didn't change the taste at all, it was still delicious!

This is a great recipe!  One suggestion is not to take it out of the pan too early.  I did this and the loaf tragically broke in half diagonally.  My friend and I were forced to eat the broken pieces.

FABULOUS!   Have made it 4 times in the last month.  I followed the recipe the first time except added semi sweet chocolate chips.  I have played with it the last three times (all were good but here is where I am at with it and it just came out fabulous again!)  NOW: 1/4 c oil 3/4 c unsweet applesauce  Have used either pecans or walnuts and both were great.   ALWAYS add the semi sweet chocolate chips.  I think we would like them without but we really LOVE them with the chips.    A couple oz of pure creamed coconut.  (I had extra from a party.  I don't have exact measurements yet on this and I don't know that it adds more flavor)  Last 3 times I have used 2 cups of White Whole Wheat Flour and 1 Cup Graham flour from.  (Can't tell that it isn't bleached white flour that I used in the first recipe.)

Since I've seen the rave reviews for this I decided to make it for H2's last day at work to share with his staff.  Since H2 is diabetic, I used all whole wheat flour and subbed splenda and sugar-free maple syrup for the brown sugar.  The batter was a little dry so I needed to add 1 cup of water.  It smelled amazing while baking and I could hardly wait to "sample" some before sending it out.  Thanks Tahoegirl for the great recipe.

Waayyyyyy to sweet! I really didn't like it much because of this. I did some alterations to make it healthier and I loved it! I replaced half the oil with apple sauce, used only 1 cup of sugar total instead of 2, and used the following flour combo: 1 cup white flour, 1 cup multigrain flour, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, 2/3 cup bran. It tasted fantastic!

This was an amazing recipe, perfect because I was looking for one that would use less oil and maybe could incorporate my ripe bananas. It called for applesauce and some whole wheat flour. I didn't add the coconut or walnuts due to allergies, plus I doubled the recipe and it came out very moist and delicious. Big hit even with kids!

Very good. I used all whole wheat flour. Next time I'll add more coconut - the flavor didn't come through as strongly as I would've liked.

This recipe is fabulous!  Dense, moist.   To complete the island feel, I used macadamia nuts instead of walnuts.  Will definitely make again.

I love it! it's a nice new twist to zucchini bread for us. usually we have it with choc chips so i was wondering if we'd miss the sweet choc.  Hubby approved! This is worth bringing out for company.. served with butter.. yum

Amazingly Good. I'm not a huge bread fan, but unbelievable bread. So moist and used up those overripe zucchini/bananas and applesauce! Have to admit it smelled so good I ate a slice while still chewy and not finished baking. My honey did too! Couldn't wait! MAKE THIS!!!!

I love this bread!  I made a few modifications though. I used 1 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup of buckwheat flour and then the 1 cup of wheat flour. I ran out of cinnamon so I added a dash of pumpkin spice in addition to what cinnamon I had.  I also didn't have applesauce so I substituted coconut oil which adds great flavor. Overall great bread!

This is also great gluten-free. Just substitute the 3 cups of flour with your favorite gluten-free baking mix and add 1.5 tsp xanthan gum. The recipe is already so moist that the dryness of the gluten-free flours is not noticeable.

Very tasty.  To add more nutritional value, I altered the recipe just a bit - used 2 cups whole wheat flour instead of 1, added an extra banana for moisture, three cups of zucchini, cut the sugars to 1 1/4 cups (still sweet), and roasted the walnuts on the top.  I made muffins instead.  Cooked them for 27 to 30 minutes.  Good recipe!

All I have to say is that this is the best thing I've ever baked, hands down. And I bake a LOT. I used 3 bananas, doubled the coconut and used 1 1/2 C. of Whole Wheat Flour and 1 1/2 C. White. Amazing. Made them into muffins, baked for 25 mins.

I didn't have walnuts on hand so I subbed in Heath Bits.  I like this bread a day old better than fresh...easier to slice.  It freezes well.  Keep in fridge unless you will be eating it all within a few days...very moist.

This was an excellent.  Made as written, and everyone enjoyed it.  Next time, I will reduce the sugar a bit (perhaps to 1 1/2c. total) to reduce the sweetness just a bit.

Yum, so good! Used 2 cups of whole wheat flour and 1 cup of all purpose, used sour cream instead of oil and added a half of an extra banana. Added a couple handfuls of flax seed too. Will definitely make again!

Very tasty. I followed the recipe exact - it was sweeter than I usually care for but I loved the coconut in it.  My loaves took a lot longer to cook, close to an extra half hour because they stayed too moist in the middle but that could be the pans I used (stone pans seem to take longer to heat up)

I made a batch of this and a batch of traditional zucchini bread at the same time and the traditional was way better.  The bananas really gave this a strange taste.

Excellent bread.  I made this last night (I have tons of zucchini and was in the process of shredding to freeze.  Followed the recipe with one exception.  I decided to double the recipe and but realized I only had 2 bananas (rats), so I rummaged through the pantry and found an 8 oz. can of crushed pinapple so I subsituted this (gently drained) for the 2 missing bananas.  It turned out great, however I am sure the correct number of bananas would have been just as good.  Thanks for the recipe.  I am sharing it, along with sample of the bread at work today :)

Solid recipe.  Cut the recipe in half to make 1 loaf.  Changed it a bit to accomodate ingredients on hand-- used sweetened applesauce and doubled it to replace all of the oil, used 2 ripe bananas and omitted the coconut.  The extra banana made it wetter so I had to bake it for 70 minutes.  Tastes Great, and I don't usually like zucchini bread.

Wow!  Great recipe to use up both Bananas and Zucchini! We loved the flavor and texture of the bread. Next time we'll use less sugar, maybe just a half cup of each. Thanks for sharing tahoegirl~~from N. Dakota  : )

Let me start off by saying I suck at making bread. It always comes out burnt around edges and raw in the middle.  This bread came out perfect. The only change I made was  I left out the coconut. Yum yum yum. The boys ate the first loaf in a couple of hours!  I would feel proud sending one of these off as a gift or for a pot luck. Next time I might leave out the nuts, (toddler didn't like those). Tip, I made sure there was some distance between the loaves in the oven, also half way thru I switched their sides. I think I cooked them for 55 min. I probably could of got away with 50. Either way this is a great recipe. Will make again and again!

UPDATE: MY PARENTS REALLY ENJOYED THIS - EVEN MY CONFIRMED, "HEALTHY STUFF = NO GOOD" DAD! :) Mmmm! Good bread, Tahoegirl (and I'm not really a fan of sweet / quick breads in general...). :) I've been wanting to bake something lately, but haven't had enough time to. This weekend, I did. I like to bake for others mostly, so when I saw that this recipe yielded two loaves, I was sold. The fact that this is a healthy recipe was the final deal "maker" for me. My dad is on a restricted (heart healthy) diet. He refuses to eat whole wheat / grains (doesn't like them), but incorporating them into his diet is very important. Since I have two loaves of bread, I'm going to deliver one to my parents. The good news is that 99% of the time they enjoy what I share with them. If I can "trick" my dad into eating this and THEN tell him that it's healthy, maybe he'll be more open to expanding his diet lol! Healthy foods don't have to taste bland - and this certainly is proof of that. One note: I had to bake my two loaves (I purchased (2) 8 x 2 in. disposable loaf pans because I only have one stoneware loaf pan at home) for nearly 70 minutes. At the 45 minute mark, both were gooey (i.e. "raw") when a knife was inserted into the center of each one. Another thing to note: I found that 2 smallish-sized zucchini's precisely yielded 2 1/2 cups shredded with just a teeny bit leftover. Thanks so much for sharing your grandma's recipe, Tahoegirl! I'm sure my parents will thank you too. :-)

WOW!!!  I don't know how I mussed this last summer when I was trying every recipe using zucchini I could find.  Fortunately, I have still plenty of shredded in the freezer.  These are incredible--texture is smooth, almost melt in your mouth & wonderfully moist. Flavor is out of this world & there are some excellent zucchini recipes on this website. I made a couple slight changes--used half regular/ half whole wheat flour, replaced walnuts w/ pecans & (as suggested in another review) used pumpkin pie spice instead of nutmeg.  I also tossed in a handful of dried cranberries.  My only complaint--normally I have one muffin for breakfast--I had to make myself stop at 2!!  Thanks so much for sharing a superb recipe!

I really, really liked this. I followed the recipe exactly you would never know that it was part whole wheat flour or used applesauce. But I did think the bread almost had too much variety in the flavors. The next time I made it I left out the bananas, add more zucchini (probably about 2-3 cups), and then add about half a can cream of coconut to really bring out the coconut flavor. It turned out ridiculously good!!! So moist and delicious!!

This is a very good recipe.  I made it exactly as directed.  I think it would be good with just the zucchini (no banana)as well.  I baked the full batch in a bundt pan...it was huge!  When baked it went just past the top of the pan.

Wonderfully moist!! The recipe needs NO revisions. The only thing I did different is I used Sucanat in place of the sugar to make it just a little more healthy. And I only used 1 3/4 cup. My oven also took about 60 minutes.

Delish and I'm sure it will even better when I get rid of this cold and can taste it more.  LOL.  I did have to use 3 cups of all purpose flour b/c I didn't have any whole wheat but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I'm wondering has anyone tried using a cup of the pineapple sauce they make instead of applesauce?  That may make it taste more like a pina coloda.  Yum!!

OMGosh this is fantastic!! The only changes I made was I used 1/2 c Splenda brown & white sugar and used pecans. I love the coconut in it, the texture is wonderful. Thank you so much Tahoegirl for sharing this amazing recipe with us (wish I could give it more than 5 stars)!

I DON'T EVEN LIKE ZUCCHINI... but someone gave me one from their garden (a huge one), and I didn't have the heart to say no... I found this recipe.. I got 8 loaves of bread from it .. it is so moist, and the blend of flavors is wonderful! I will *definitly* make this again.. and buy zucchini just to make some. and it's healthy, to boot. LOVE!

Delicious!  We couldn't wait the 25 mins...had to dig in :)  It lives up to its 5star rating!  I did cut back on sugar by 1/2 c white sugar.  Other than that, I made it as directed.  If you like the healthier options, I definitely think that 100% whole wheat flour is an option.  My next batch will be.  (I use white whole wheat rather than red whole wheat...Think of it as albino wheat...the grain is white rather than red; a different variety that has a milder, softer taste and its more moist and cooks similarly to regular white flour.)

Awesome zucchini bread! It's great with coconut oil instead of vegetable oil for a healthier alternative. Will definitely make this again and again.

Fabulous! Using the advice of an earlier reviewer, I added 1 tsp ea banana & coconut extracts & added 1 cup of dried cranberries. I don't like whole wheat flour so used regular flour instead. Kept well for a over a week - Moist & Flavorful. A big hit at home & in my (almost) all male workplace!

I love this bread - I use more apple sauce and less oil, plus more whole wheat flour and less white. makes it just as good and just a tad bit healthier!

Wonderful texture & winning flavor. I added the extracts recommended by the Jan 2011 reviewer & a combination of craisins, jumbo raisins, a few walnuts and 1/2 cup candied kumquats, chopped.

This break was so easy and delicious to bake.  My home smelled heavenly white it baked up.  

I omitted the walnuts since I don't care for them too much and used 3  overripe bananas instead of 2 and it came out perfectly :)

Delicious! I did make a couple of changes.  I didn't have apple sauce, so like other suggested I subbed butter for that and the oil. Also, the kids were so excited that I was making muffins, I couldn't disappoint so I made into 24 muffins instead of bread.  Worked out really well! I was able to use up the zucchini and ripe bananas!

I've never made any of these quick breads before so this was my first attempt.  My family devoured this bread.  My daughter even brought some for her boyfriend to try, he gave some to his mom, and I was asked to please share the recipe.  Didn't change a thing.  Yummy!

This needed to bake much, much longer even though I increased the oven temp to 350 degrees from the start.  Even with lots of additional baking time, the final result was way too dense and moist with little areas that weren't baked enough.  The ingredients really appeal to me, so maybe I'll try it again, but I'll cut back on some of the moisture rich ingredients (probably the oil, applesauce, or part of a banana) or use a little more all-purpose flour in place of some of the whole wheat flour.  The flavor was very good.

So so so good. The best quik bread I have made to date. I loved it all I omitted the apple sauce because I didn't have any and added 3/4 oil and 3 cups of zucchini to help with the moisture. I am not a coconut fan so I omitted that and I even ran to the store for the walnuts and it was worth it. I made one loaf and 12 muffins. Muffins cooked in 20 minutes so I tasted one while the loaf is cooking past the 40 min mark.

I thought that the zucchini might be weird with banana, but it turned out great!  I didn't have any coconut so didn't add that.  I did add chocolate chips. Yumm! Somehow all of the flavors work together. It took about 60 minutes until it was done.

Excellent recipe!  I skipped the coconut, which is very high in saturated fat, but otherwise made the recipe as-is.  Very moist - my 11-yr-old is scarffing down 2 slices right now!

One of the best zucchini bread recipes I've tasted.  Good texture.  Wonderful flavour.  Best part - the kids loved it. I used 2 cups whole wheat to 1 cup all purpose flour.  My oven also took about 60 minutes.

I made one loaf and a pan each of mini (bake abt 15 min) and regular sized (bake abt 20 mins) muffins and my kids are devouring them!  What a great way to sneak them their veggies!

This is a cross between banana bread and zucchini bread but I love that you can use up bits and pieces from your pantry. Would be fantastic with cream cheese frosting or a fresh orange glaze.

I think it's perfect, I made it again this morning and added 2 grated carrots. Delish! I do find that I need 60 minutes for it to be fully baked. Yummy!

This is a great recipe.  I used 1 C oil instead of the 1/2 C applesauce because I didn't have any.  I would definitely sub applesauce in the future though.  Thanks

A bit of extra work, but yum.  Only change was I used 3 cups of allpurpose flour (no wheat), and cut the sugar in half by adding no white sugar.

Totally amazing!  I made this today since I have a ton of zucchini from my garden.  I didn't have applesauce  so I used 1/2 melted butter instead.  I also added 1 cup chocolate chips and pecans instead of walnuts! I could not keep my family away from this.  They ate an entire loaf  in less than 1 hour!

I love this recipe. Not only really great tasting, flexible:  Found I was out of some ingredients, so substituted 1c rice flour for the wheat, added extra zucc. and 1/4c oil in place of the applesauce, forgot the salt, tweeked it with my favorite addition, orange zest...Just as Good! Another trick: make aprox. 30 cupcakes ( scant 1/4c batter each), bake 25mins or til center done. Saves  time and makes easy to serve.

I was looking for a good zucchini bread recipe to make mini-muffins to put in the kids' lunches.  We live in the Dominican Republic, so when I saw Caribbean Zucchini Bread, I thought, WHY NOT!  

I am so glad we made this.  It is so very good!  I didn't have any nuts.  I will make sure and buy some, and I didn't have any applesauce, so I just put in a grated apple instead. I also don't have anywhere to buy whole wheat flour, so I had to use 3 cups white.  But I did add half a cup of ground flaxseed to try to make up for it.  

We will be making these again and again and again.  THANKS SO MUCH!  FANTASTIC  RECIPE!

Fantastic…super moist and full of flavor!  I always love to try a new loaf and/or muffin recipe and loved the sound of this one.  I did modify some of the ingredients just a touch to reduce some calories/fat as I so often do.  I used one whole egg along with 5 whites, used ¾ cup unsweetened applesauce along with ¼ cup canola and also reduced my sugar as I always find bananas add a fair amount of sweetness.  I ended up using just under ¾ cup of each brown and white sugar and still found it sweet enough.  I used a pumpkin pie spice in place of the cinnamon/nutmeg (was almost out of cinnamon and didn’t realize) and used 2 cups of cake & pastry flour with one cup ww.  Left out the nuts too, personal preference.  My loaves were done in about 53 minutes!  Loved it…so did my 8 year old :)

I made several mini-loaves of this bread to send home with guests after Easter Brunch.  I felt the bread lacked flavor but everyone else seemed to like it.  I did leave the coconut out since my daughter-in-law has a coconut allergy.  I will certainly try it again.  Possibly using a little more zucchini and spices to perk it up a little.

I tend to leave out coconut for recipes I will be sharing with coworkers... I am SO glad I didn't do that for this recipe. It's a fabulous recipe! I love the way the flavors blend together to create a deliciously moist and flavorful bread. The store was closed for Easter so I couldn't get applesauce...used oil instead. Then other than using pecans (preferred) I followed this recipe... and it's delicious! Couldn't ask for a better quick bread! This recipe will be kept on file...sure to make again!

My idea of a great recipe is one that is versatile enough to accept substitutions to suit one's style or to accommodate ingredients on hand.  Having said that, this is a GREAT recipe!  I loved the idea of having a topping and accomplished this look by combing almond flour & chopped macadamia nuts.  I also wanted to include chopped pineapple  the results were fantastic, will be making this again!

This was absolutely, hands down, the best zucchini bread I've ever had. I used 1/4 cup oil only and used an extra 1/4 cup of applesauce. I will cut down on the white sugar next go around. Between the applesauce, bananas and brown sugar it's likely sweet already. Thanks tahoegirl and her Grandma!

This recipe is perfect! I can't bake. I admit it, but this recipe makes me look skilled. I have made it three times and each time it was perfect! Not only is the taste superb, but no matter what I do to it, it still is amazing. I have added raisins instead of coconut, and use pecans instead of walnuts. I will also add a bit of dried cranberry. Because I am not a baker, I never change the basic recipe, but why would I? It's perfect! Oh, It freezes well too.

This stuff is AWESOME!  I had some bananas and applesauce to use up and went searching for recipes and found this one.  I however did not have zucchini so I used some firm, crisp, not too sweet apples instead that I put through the food processor, peel and all, and cut into little bits.  I don't know what kind of apples they were but they weren't overly sweet.  I also used unsweetened coconut since I had the sweetness of the apples.  40 minutes baking time was perfect for me.  I will be making this again!

This recipe is fantastic.  I wouldn't change a thing.  The cooking time is right on but I added 15 mins for a large loaf.  My second attempt will be with almonds instead of walnuts just because that's what I have on hand.  The coconut flavour is a nice addition.  Very moist.

very good, bread.  not overly sweet.  I liked the tropical flavors in the recipe and did not feel they dominated.  i had bake my bread for 5 min longer that the time stated and yet they still were not 100% finished but that may just be my oven.  be sure to check your loves before to pull them out.

Can use yogurt in place of applesauce.  Use coconut oil for added flavor.

We have made this several times and it is always moist and delicious. My wife loves it toasted in the morning with a fresh cup of coffee.  We usually use half ww flour and half unbleached but I think we'll try next time heavier on the ww flour and lighter on the sugars.  Great recipe, everyone always loves it.

I had great success in baking six mini loaves (3.5" x 6") of this quick bread.  By baking in the mini pans, the bread is done at the 35-40 minute mark.  The texture was great, and my DH and DS could not detect the coconut used in this recipe.  We thought the flavors complimented one another well.  We like it as bread, but our favorite way to eat this is toasted with a little butter.  Thanks for sharing, tahoegirl!

De-lish!!!  A few modifications: I added all white flour instead of wheat; decreased white sugar to 1/2 cup; I also used fresh blueberries instead of coconut & walnuts.  Also, I cook my bread at 350 for 50 min.  (Last half covered with tinfoil so it doesn't burn.)

My joy at finding a recipe to use the abundant zucchini and overripe bananas on hand was increased when my husband pronounced the results "delicious".  Although I followed the basic recipe, substitutions were done to make use of what I had available. I had 3 ripe bananas so left out the applesauce. I used all brown sugar since we are trying to avoid the white sugar, and omitted coconut as I did not have it. Made 1 loaf and 12 muffins, and raised the oven temp to 350. The muffins were done in about 30 min, and the loaf about 1 hour. The consistency of the batter will vary; when the knife comes out without any gooey batter stuck on it remove the bread. I froze the muffins so I can pack 1 for breakfast at work when I wish.

Delicious!  A nice, new twist on zucchini bread.  Like other reviewers, I used 2 cups of whole wheat flour and 1 cup of white flour.  Reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup each of white and brown.  Did not have applesauce on hand, so used yogurt - worked fine.  Next time, I might throw in a handful of chocolate chips or some drained crushed pineapple.  Flavors blended better when tasted the next day.  Makes 2 nice, big loaves.  Thanks!

This is an awesome recipe.  I had an old tried and true recipe, but I haven't made it since trying this one.  I make this when everyone has zucchini and freeze it.  No changes needed here.  It is perfect as is!

Followed the recipe other than using 1c Quinoa flour to replace 1c of flour.  It turned out too moist and I baked it double the time it was supposed to be in.  Ended up like it wasn't baked enough but still had good flavor.  May try it again just to see.

These were wonderful loaves that baked up moist and flavourful. I did need to bake them longer than stated, but my oven is always slow, so that is probably the reason. It's nice to have something different than the regular zucchini bread for a change. Thanks!

Agreed!  Delicious bread.  I used 2 cups whole wheat and 1 cup all purpose, reduced the amount of white sugar and increased applesauce amount.  I also added a pineapple juice, brown sugar, and butter glaze after baking.  Poked a few holes in it with a knife and only used a little bit of the glaze.  Yum!

This is delicious! Though, I intended to add a teaspoon of coconut extract, but accidentally added almond extract instead.  Oops, I realized it and then added about a 1/4 t coconut extract (that's all I had).  Surprisingly, the flavors turned out amazing.  Usually I omit nutmeg in recipes like this, but went with a scant 1/2 teaspoon.

This bread is so yummy! I only had 2 cups of zucchini, so I added an extra banana. I didn't have applesauce, so I subbed 1/2 c plain yogurt. Also, I threw in a tablespoon of Jamaican rum - now that's Caribbean! This will be made again. My husband loved it. He raved as much as he did when I made "We Be Jammin' Jamaican Banana Bread" from this site.

This is one of the best quick breads I have ever made. I followed the recipe as directed and I added a streusel topping of 2 T flour, 1/3 C brown sugar, 1 T butter, 2 T nuts, 1/8 t cinnamon and 2 T coconut to the top about 1/2 way through the baking time. Perfection!

I like the twist on regular zucchini bread with the coconut. It did take 60 minutes, and a part of the top still wasn't all the way cooked.

The amount of nutmeg called for is WAY too overpowering. It kinda ruined the flavor of the bread for me, but I can tell it would be fabulous without it!

We loved this. Didn't have walnuts, so I didn't worry about them, I used all whole wheat flour (I've found that white vs. wheat makes no difference in quickbreads like these), I replaced the white sugar with Splenda, and I substituted more applesauce for the oil, and it turned out AMAZING. Great flavor and texture. It's really good warmed, cold out of the fridge, or toasted. I will definitely make this again sometime! With a few omissions/substitutions, it's a great low-fat low-calorie treat, which is something I'm always looking for! Even if you don't make any changes, it's still a tasty nutritious dessert bread. Thanks for the recipe!

I make a few changes, but overall we love these.  I swap out oatmeal for some of the flour, use much less sugar and leave out the nuts and coconut so it's less caribbean. We add chocolate chips and bake in mini-muffin tins and the kids (and hubby) dig them up!
