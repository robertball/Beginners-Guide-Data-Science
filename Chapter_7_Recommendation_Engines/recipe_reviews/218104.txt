I found this recipe while trying to figure out how to make my own barbecue pork steamed buns and thought that this would make a suitable filling.  Last night's supper was the test run, and I am well-pleased; it tasted just like I imagined.

I did not have light soy sauce and so just used 1/2 cup of the regular stuff.  I did not have rice cooking wine, so I used the cheap sak√© I did happen to have on hand.  I also lacked the Chinese rock sugar as well as the inclination to make it myself, so I took Good EatNZ's suggestion to use an equivalent amount of brown sugar.  The variation turned out just fine.

This dish is extremely sweet, so unless you plan to eat it in small amounts (such as in steamed buns) or over rice, I would try using 75% or less of the sugar.  In any case: delicious!

This was excellent!  My husband cooked this (so its easy too!!)  he replaced a few things (because of what we had!)  All dark soy sauce, used 2ozs of Brown sugar and water with a tablespoon of vingar (cider)  He also used ordinary onions.  AND - he has just confessed that he forgot to add the ginger!!! ANYWAY - it was great, 1lb of meat was not a lot for our family of three, although it was VERY rich and salty, we had it over a plain fried rice and fried cabbage (neither of which we added salt to - as we could see how salty the pork would be)  It was so tasty and the meat was REALLY tender!!

I used Malbec instead of rice wine, ginger, brown sugar plus a half a cup of dark soy sauce....kept adding water in the course of two  hours and came out....better than expected!  Awesome sauce.  This is truly one EPIC meal paired with white rice, and spinach sauteed in garlic and sesame oil.  Plus  Conquista 2010 Malbec  - CHEERS!

Used Muscato in place of Chinese rice wine. And added a few teaspoons of oyster sauce. Used the water boiled for the meat to replenish the sauce.
