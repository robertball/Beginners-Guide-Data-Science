I am not a fan of the traditional Green Bean Casserole served during holidays - this is a great alternative. I used fresh broccoli and added fresh mushrooms, good stuff!

This was a quick side for Breaded Ranch Chicken. I totally spaced on meal planning for this week and when I plugged in broccoli and cheddar cheese soup into the ingredient search on this site, this is what I came up with. I made a couple small changes to improve the flavor--I added a half cup of extra sharp white cheddar cheese, onion/garlic powder, a squirt of dijon mustard and a shake of Frank's Hot Sauce. This was SO freaking simple to assemble and it went right in the oven along side the ranch chicken. This was inhaled--even the littlest ate his portion and asked for seconds! I'll make this again with my small adjustments. GREAT pantry side dish.

This is an alright recipe. My wife forced me to make it, but I did not follow it religiously. The cheese soup is funky, and bland, so we ended up adding 1c. finely shredded cheddar, 1/2 teas salt, and 1/2 c more milk. It turned out alright, but would make a better base for a pie w/ some chicken than a stand alone dish. Next time I will find something else.

I was originally just looking for a recipe to use a can of cheese soup I had. I wanted this to be a whole meal so I used half the broccoli and added some chicken breast cut into cubes,  a can of diced potatoes and a few slices of fat free
Cheddar cheese. It was delicious.
