These where soooo good!!! However, I did make a few changes that really put the cap on this perfect meal. First of all, I used Ahi tuna steaks instead of salmon. Then I made a sauce of the lime, brown sugar, and I used oyster sauce instead of fish sauce. I couldn't find any Thai chilies, so I used a bottled Thai pepper suace instead. I grilled the tuna steaks on the BBQ grill, and basted them with this sauce. Served the steaks whole instad of mashing them up on buttered buns with grilled red onions, lettace, and  home made sauce made of mayo, dijon mustard, and burger sauce. Finished it off with home fries on the side! The best tuna burger ever tasted! Defintly a keeper!
