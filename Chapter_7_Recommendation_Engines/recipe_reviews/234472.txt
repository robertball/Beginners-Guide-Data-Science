I made these scallions pancakes the other day. My kids and wife loved them...I thought they were good, but not excellent. This was my first time making scallion pancakes, so that may have been a contributing factor. We order them from our local take-out places all the time, and they are usually a little bit more flaky from them (although not always perfect from them either): mine was a bit dense/doughy. I have to admit, I forgot to brush the oil on the pancakes before rolling them, so that may have contributed to the problem. We used plain soy cause as the dipping sauce, but a sauce more like one used for dumplings would be more appropriate.

I would definitely make these again, and would recommend this recipe. If I can get them a bit more flaky, and if the original author would add dipping sauce recipe, I would give this 5 stars/

I have not tried the recipe but reading it I noticed that the salt was off.  1 tablespoon of salt equals 3 teaspoons. Reading further in the recipe it states to use 1 teaspoon first and then a 1/2 teaspoon later. So recipe should read 1 1/2 teaspoon divided, that would correct the sodium numbers, literally cutting it in half. In saying this I am looking forward to trying this recipe. Thanks for posting it.

I'm making these as I'm writing. Very simple recipe to to follow. I allowed the dough to rest for a good hour before rolling it out again. I also added a little sesame oil to the canola oil that I brushed the dough with. I  made a dipping sauce which consists of soy sauce, rice-wine vinegar, toasted sesame oil, garlic powder, and honey and sugar to taste. Topped with a few scallions it's an easy accompaniment to this recipe.

I liked this recipe, though I felt the pancakes were a wee bit heavy/doughy.  I followed the recipe almost exactly as written--only differences were I let the dough rest for about 60 minutes (needed extra time to finish mincing the scallions) and I used less salt.  This recipe calls for WAY too much salt--1/2 tsp per pancake would be excessive IMO!  I just sprinkled a pinch on each one before rolling.  I wasn't entirely sure what was meant by rolling the scroll into a "disk"--I think I did it right, but that description makes me wonder.  Served them with Trader Joe's Gyozo Dipping Sauce and homemade egg drop soup.  This was my first time making scallion pancakes, so perhaps I'll try a couple other recipes and see which I like the best.  Thanks!

i tried this recipe. I found the dough heavy and hard to work I would like to know what consistency of the dough should be? Mine was a bread dough... Found it hard to get it stretches out  bug and thin. I followed the recipe. I did use bread flour. Perhaps it was too heavy.

I really liked these pancakes.  They came out very well!  Next time, I would like to try a  blend of sesame oil and vegetable oil to brush them with.

Once you form the scroll/rope into a disc, roll it out to no more than 1/4" thick, then fry it. The flavor is fine.

Made the pancakes tonight and they came out pretty good except that they were too salty even though I cut the salt back to 1 1/2 tsp. My husband liked it as well.We would both like to see a good dipping sauce recipe along with it. Thanks!I would make it again..it was as good as any restaurant pancake.

Would make them much thinner next time.  1/2 inch thick rounds seems awfully thick.

I tried this for the first time today. The dough was sticky even after I let the dough sit. Once I got some flour on it, it was fine. It rolled out well with only a little contracting. The method of rolling and folding ensures an even distribution of scallion. I didn't find them all that flavorful by themselves but with some sauce, they were excellent.

I added a bit more salt, and used a combination of sesame oil and vegetable oil inside. Good, will try again.

Very tasty! I couldn't believe how well they came out the first time. My boyfriend had a hard time believing I made them myself.

On my second go, I learned the hard way that you definitely have to let the dough sit- the longer the better. I'd also suggest getting the water as hot as possible.

As for dipping sauce, I'd suggest Trader Joe's Soyaki sauce. It makes for the perfect accompaniment.

Good recipe. I substituted chickpea flour for half the flour and added cumin and sesame seeds. Next time I'll use sesame oil to add to the flavor. I didn't think the salt was too excessive. They were even good cold. Thinking of eating the leftovers for lunch with goat cheese.
