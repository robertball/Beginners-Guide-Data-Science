I have been making mashed potatoes like this for over 50 years...and it's the way MY mother made them.  For this recipe to be a success, you have to know a little about potatoes.  Notice the recipe called for BAKING potatoes.  Red ones will be gummy.  Yukon Golds make GOOD mashed potatoes. Start them off in COLD water so everything will reach boiling at the same time.  When they are tender, drain them in a colandar and let them STEAM.  The more steam is gone, the more the potatoes will absorb the milk.  (No problem with 'soupy' potatoes here...you even MAY have to add more milk than the recipe calls for.  While the potatoes are steaming, heat the butter and milk in the same pot you cooked the potatoes in.  (Why wash another pan?) Add the steamed potatoes and mash and season.  (I've had my share of 'gummy' and 'soupy' mashed potatoe in my time :)  Oh! And if this is for a special occasion...use cream instead of milk.  Over the top!!!

Perfect mashed potatoes.  Heating the milk and butter is a must, I didn't realize what a difference it would make, my potatoes were not gummy and they stayed hot longer.

Great recipe for "good old fashioned" mashed potatoes! It's straight forward and just plain delicious. The perfect mashed potato for your favorite gravy! I always heat up my milk in the microwave and add it to the potatoes (sometimes use half n half to make them creamier). You just can't go wrong with this classic recipe for comfort food!

Take about 8 cloves of raw garlic and throw them into the water with the potatos and let them cook together. They will be soft and mash easily.  TO DIE FOR

This recipe is not bad but I added all the milk in and the mash potato became too runny (like soup). I'll say not to add all the milk this recipe suggested. Just add a little milk a time until u think it's the texture u want and that's it. Then maybe u'll love it. ^-^.

There isn't enough butter in these mashed potatoes, you should have a least a stick of butter.  I make mashed potatoes all the time and everyone just loves my potatoes.

Sometimes the simplest recipes are the best! Smash the potatoes to mostly lump-free before adding the butter and milk. One thing I suggest doing differently is to add the butter to the potatoes first, then add heated milk as needed. That way you get all of the butter in the mashed potatoes and can add just the right amount of milk for the correct texture.

Great basic recipe.  If you're watching your calories etc, try substituting the potatoes starchy cooking water for most of the milk.  After that, only a quick splash of milk is needed.

I just made this recipe and it is fantastic.  I made this recipe x 4.  I only used 1/2 the milk (I think if I added any more it would be too runny) and added 4 dabs of cream cheese for a little umph. Excellent, this is a great recipe for you to make into your own.

This is your very basic recipe for mashed potatoes and I have always made them this way. I personally prefer using half & half or heavy cream in place of the milk. It's not healthier but it does makes these creamier. I also prefer "more" to my mashed potatoes (ie: chives or sour cream) BUT these are very good and go well with many traditional meals.

I took a leaf from a previous review and added a package of cream cheese to this recipe.  The result is nothing but delicious!  It did take a LOT longer than the stated cook time for the potatoes to get soft enough to be able to mix them, though! I may cut back on the cream cheese next time, though, to make them a bit "healthier".  I will NEVER make boxed taters again!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is how I make mashed potatoes, but I don't heat the milk and butter separately.  I drain the potatoes well, then add the milk and butter, salt and pepper and cook on low heat for a minute or so. Then I mash the potatoes with an electric mixer. But, I don't mix too long, or you have starchy potatoes.

These potatoes are so easy & yummy. I actually followed the recipe so am qualified to rate it. I waited to add the warmed milk & butter until the potatoes stopped steaming in the colander. This step was something I hadn't thought of before, it kept potatoes warm during mashing.

If the mashed potatoes are too runny, just mash/whip a little longer. The longer the potatoes are whipped, the more they will thicken up.

Try substituting 2/3 cup of the water the potatoes cooked in, mixed with 1/3 cup of powdered milk for the 1 cup of milk.  Very Nice.

Lee's Mashed Potatoes - I find when making mashed potatoes that using evaporated milk makes them creamier and I leave a little of the potato water in there to thin them down. I like a lot of butter and salt is a must.  Lee S.

Thank you for the great mashed potatoes recipe! I think this is the first time I've ever made them from scratch.  We had my boyfriend's parents over for dinner and I made these with the chicken I made and they came out great!  The only thing is, I did not use salt and pepper.  Also, I probably used about 2.5 lbs. of potatoes, I just eyeballed them though.  Also, with the amount of potatoes I only used half a cup of milk and that was perfect.  I kind of destroyed our blender on another recipe I was making, so I used a fork to crush the potatoes, then I added the milk mixture and then whisked it to the creaminess.  At this point, the mashed potatoes were kind of cold, so I had to microwave them for a bit, which was no problem.  Great recipe, will definitely use it again.

As advertised, this is your basic delicious mashed potato recipe.  I left the skins on my Yukon golds, and used skim milk.  Perfect compliment to my country ribs with gravy.  Thanks for sharing!

I have been making mashed potatoes for over 60 years and along the way I have learned a few tricks for creamy mashed potatoes. I am currently cooking for 3. So I use 7 small potatoes or 4-5 larger ones. After draining the potatoes, I put them back in the pan over a high heat to dehydrate excess water on the potatoes. While heating in the pan, I shake the pan to move the potatoes around. Then I add 1/2 of a quarter pound stick of butter, slicing it thin so it quickly melts on the hot potatoes. (I don't think this recipe uses enough butter.) Then I mash the potatoes with a potato masher until all of the lumps are mashed. Then I add the milk, about 1/3 cup, gradually, mashing as I go until I get to the consistency that I want. I prefer mashed potatoes with a little substance. So I think this recipe uses too much milk. If gravy were used on them, they would likely be very watery.  The main thing here is to dry the excess water from the potatoes before they are mashed. The water seems to make them more "grainy" than creamy. So I don't agree with the reviewer that said to add water instead of some of the milk. I like the idea that one reviewer suggested to boil garlic cloves with the potatoes, but would suggest that the cloves are smashed and left to sit for at least minutes before adding them to the potatoes. This not only increases the garlic flavor, but also increases the health benefits of the garlic.

This is a good no-fail base. Here's a warning... this recipe makes for a loose, smooth and almost runny mashed potatoes. If you, like me, like your mashed potatoes on the thicker side, don't add in all of the warm milk and butter mixture at once. I did make that mistake but I quickly solved the runny problem by adding in about a quarter cup of instant mashed potato flakes. It thickened it up and it still tasted like it was made from real potatoes. I doubled the amount of butter for richness (used Smart Balance Spread) and did not need to add any salt. Actually, I found the Smart Balance Spread to be on the salty side so I put in a couple pinches of sugar (yes, sugar!). It gave it more depth and it's not like it was candy-sweet or anything. I also sprinkled in a touch of no-salt meat seasoning (a combination of onion powder, garlic powder, etc) and some green onion for freshness.

I use sour cream instead of milk. Butter can be melted but sour cream goes in right from the container  into hot potatoes.

Very good and yes basic, this is always how I prepared mashed potatoes, except we call them cream potatoes. I think just eyeballing your milk will help with the consistancy you may want, instead of just adding the whole cup of milk at once, everything kind of depends on the size of your potatoes. I think this will help so your outcome will not be soupy potatoes.

Great recipe for mashed potatoes.  I used half & half to make it a little creamier and I put in a little garlic salt to perk it up.  Great recipe . . . I will definitely be making this again very soon.

My husband and I really liked this recipe.  However, I boiled the potatoes longer so that they would be softer and I also added garlic powder to give them a little kick.  I made them in the blender because I couldn't find the potato masher and it was really hard to get the potatoes out of the blender.  But other than that, it was really simple.  I would suggest adding a little milk at a time as to make sure its not so runny, which is what I did.  It's hard to please my husband so I'll definately make it again.

Very, very good mashed potatoes :-)  I didn't follow the proportions exactly, but I judged how much I needed based on what the potatoes looked like. I also used heavy cream instead of milk, and added a sprinkle of fresh ground chili. It was so good!

These were easy and oh, so yummy!  I made mine with red potatoes with the skin.  I suggest adding liquid to potatoes a little at a time as mine were too runny.  No one cared, though - they were great!  Thanks.

Great basic recipe. If you don't mind a little extra fat, use half and half instead of milk! It makes them much more creamy and less grainy!

Like the recipe says, basic mashed potatoes.  Can't go wrong with that.  I'm a southern girl so I add a good bit more butter to mine.

I'm an Asian whose mom never made mash and I "don't do" cooking myself. I wanted to try making basic mashed potatoes and this recipe works! I put in both black and white pepper, and added a light sprinkle of garlic powder like some suggested, ewww, it reeked. Next time I'll just reduce it to a pinch. Otherwise I followed all the measurements to a T and it came out just fine, not runny or anything. Easy to make, tastes good, but next time I'll eat it with gravy LOL.

Be sure to add the milk a little at a time to get your desired consistency.  If I would have added it all, they would have been way too thin.  Just a matter of preference I suppose.  Otherwise they were pretty tasty.

Amazing! I'd always had a hard time with turning out 'potato goo-soup' instead of mashed potatoes. These taste just like my mom's! 

A bit of a side-note, if you have a microwave-safe measuring cup, you can microwave the milk and butter together, stir it up a bit, and then blend with the potatoes that way. My stove was otherwise occupied when I made these, haha.

I use this recipe alot and sometimes mix it up by adding a little crushed garlic. I also like to use chicken broth or a bouillon cube when boiling the potatoes. It adds a little extra flavor and my 8 yr. old LOVES them.

I was planning on making a different mashed potato recipe from this site, but my mom beat me to it and made mashed potatoes how she always makes them, basic and simple. Went very well with what we served it with, "Slow Cooker Cassoulet" from this site. I like basic mashed potatoes, reminds me of my child hood!

I thought I liked lumpy mashed potatoes untill I tried this.  Warming the milk and butter makes the potatoes very creamy.  This is the only way I will ever make mashed potatoes.

This reciped is perfect.  It DOES make a difference to heat the milk and butter.  Cold milk and butter added to hot potato makes the potato gummy.  If you think it's fine to use cold ingredients because that's the way you always have done it, you are missing out on something special!

I already know how to make mashed potatoes, and it doesn't really need a recipe to make them.  I have always made my potatoes with milk even skim milk, and they taste wonderful.  You don't even have to heat the milk and butter. Just put them right in with the potatoes after they are drained, and they will warm up because of all of the heat from the potatoes.  This will save you a step, and some clean up.  If you are looking for a richer mashed potatoe, try using canned milk(undiluted) and a few tablespoons cream cheese.

We absolutely loved this ... I took the advice of the other reviewers and ensured I warmed up the milk and butter. To this mixture, I added about 3 tablespoons of grated parmesan cheese as well. I first mashed the boiled potatoes with a fork, and then added the milk into the mashed potatoes in 3 parts. After every addition of milk into the potato, I used my hand mixer to blended the milk mix and the potatoes. Absolutely YUM! Thank you for sharing this recipe :D

This was good even though I forgot to add the salt and pepper. At first, it seemed like way too much milk but it got thicker after whisking. I used russet potatoes which mashed up nice and easy.

I have referred to this recipe for years, but never followed it exactly. I like to boil  1-2 cloves of garlic per pound of potatoes. Mash the potatoes with the garlic using a potato masher. Add the melted butter and milk slowly so you don't end up with soupy potatoes. I use 2x the butter and half the milk from this recipe.  Add salt and pepper to taste. Once you have the flavor you like, use an electric beater until you get the consistency you like.

Not enough butter, too much milk.

It is a good thing I poured things in slowly and realized that the consistency was fine after just over half the amount of milk.

If the potatoes are cooked with the peeling on, they are easy to peel and mash, have greater nutritional value, and have a delicious flavor.

Very Good Recipe.  I've made it 2x.  

As Syble suggested.. it's important to allow the potatoes to steam after they cook and before you mash them.  I let them sit in the colander until they stopped letting off steam.  Then the potatoes will readily absorb the milk.  

The second time I made them I boiled them in vegetable broth, and also added 1/4 cup cream cheese.  Did think it improved the flavor in a very subtle way.  

Everyone one loved the recipe both times that I served it.  

Enjoy!

I love this easy, simple recipe. I have always put in 2-3 bay leaves in while cooking the potatoes.  My husband says they are the best Mashed Potatoes ever!

This is definitely easy to make, but seems to be missing something. Maybe more butter and salt.

Easy, quick, simple with that "homestyle" taste. Heating the milk and butter first is a must. I do often times use a little more butter to taste. This is the first recipe I followed when learning how to make mashed potatoes and no matter how I change them up now, I always use this method as a base.

Good flavor. I used an extra T butter after I made them as I thought it needed it. I only used 3/4 milk that's all they needed. I didn't heat the water before adding potatoes, I just put the potatoes in the pan and added water to cover.

I liked the idea of warming the milk and butter so I thought that I would give this recipe a try. Glad that I did, that potatoes were really creamy and this recipe opens the door to add any of your favorite flavorings. Next, I'll try to add some garlic.

Really good.. really basic. I omitted the milk and added more melted butter instead. Didnt peel off the skin coz dont wanna waste the nutrition. The dish was complimented with Easy BBQ Bake Chic and Old Fashioned Brown Gravy from this site. My mom liked it, so does my family so Im givin' it 5*. Check out pic.

Sometimes simplicity is absolutely delicious. The potatoes came out great, and I can easily tweak it for some additional flavor (garlic, truffle oil, cheese, Etc.).

It was one of my first times in the kitchen, and this recipe was simple and easy to follow! I boiled the potatoes for an extra long time, and they turned out so soft that I didn't need a potato masher. A wooden spoon was all I used! 10/10 would make it again!

I doubled the recipe and it worked out great! Left the skins on and left them pretty chunky due to the lack of a potato masher in my kitchen.

Great recipe... for a richer taste try using canned evaporated milk... I use this for mashed pots. and mac n cheese and it makes the flavor that much better!

Great just the way it is.  Don't put all the milk in at once.  I like my mashed potatoes a little drier than some people and with a little extra pepper.  Then with some good gravy over the top...mmmmm...perfect.

Exactly how I make my potatoes ... only I don't use an electric mixer, since they come out gummy when I do.  I hand mash the potatoes, then stir in the melted butter & milk.  Perfect every time!

Very delicious outcome.  Thanks for the recipe.  I can see how this can easily be "fancied up" with adding garlic, dry ranch dressing powder, cheese, etc.  Glad to have a basic and tastey base recipe!

I never use milk in my mashed potatoes, but use condensed milk instead.  I usually use the Great Value kind at Wal-Mart and I have perfect mashed potatoes every time!

Superb! Added 4 ozs of cream cheese; garlic powder; and less than 1/2 cup of milk. Served these with a pot roast I made and it was a huge hit.  This will definitely be my new standard mashed potato recipe.

Simple, classic comfort food. Added a bit more milk and just whipped them up using a fork. We like lumpy potatoes.

I was amazed at how tasty mashed potatoes can be without cream.  I used 2% milk with a little extra margerine/butter and they turn out wonderful.  My husband, who is rather picky about his potatoes, really enjoyed them.  I used red potatoes and left some of the skin on, too, for color and nutritional value.  Great potatoes!

I've made this recipe many times, but I'm finally getting around to rating it.  It's really great!  Your everyday mashed potatoes; it goes well with almost anything!  It goes well just by itself, but I usually serve it with some dish that has some sort of gravy to it.  When I'm being healthy conscience, I'll omit the butter and it's fine as it.  I never add the black pepper either, it's not needed.

very easy recipe for beginner cookers..I must add that.. depending on the type of potatoes you need to add less milk.Also the evaporated "can" is so good in mashed potatoes you don't need butter.

This is a great mashed potato recipe the only problem with it is the potatoes should be put in cold water. You don't boil the water and then add the potatoes I learned this from a professional chef. Starting them in cold water ensures they cook evenly and they don't get gummy. Happy cooking

These are SO delicious! Sometimes simple is the best!  I used Yukon Gold potatoes and also light cream.  I've learned that after draining the potatoes, return them to the pan and steam for a few min to dry them out a bit. So rich and creamy, I could eat a bowl of this! Thanks for this easy guide!

The potatoes will still be VERY hard and too firm to mash if following this recipe. I recommend cutting the potatoes into small pieces to boil or boiling for an extra 10-15 minutes

The recipe turned out great.  They were real easy to prepare and cook.  The whole recipe from start to finish only took me a half an hour.  It was well worth it.  The potatoes turned out creamy and smooth, and I had plenty of leftover.  They were the envy of my office lunchroom.  My wife loved them as well.  She told me she is now spoiled.  I will never go back to the boxed potato flakes again.  They are well worth the slightly extra time.  Excellent.

First time making mashed potatoes and worked perfectly.  I *mostly* pealed the potatoes but left some skin on them.  I added garlic salt and cayenne pepper based on other comments.

Good old fashioned mashed potatoes.  Better than my mother's (sorry, mom).  I needed help with proportions of potatoes, milk and butter . . . and heating the milk and butter before adding really made a difference in keeping them hot (Duh!).  But I had never thought of that before.

My family loved how creamy and buttery these potatoes tasted! I used half and half instead of milk but love the idea of warming it with the butter first. Perfecto!

This is how I always make our mash potatoes. But I never measure milk or butter -- eye ball and taste as I go. This is a great benchmark to start with. Of course I don't know how much my potatoes weigh either so it's a little guessing game.
I used salted butter once since I ran out of unsalted. Surprisingly, I got a compliment that it was soooo good. So I been using salted butter ever since. Salt in water as well. Today i used 75% whole milk and 25% cream. Yum!

I love this recipe and yes I will make it again. The only thing that I did was cut back a little on the milk maybe less than a quarter less and I used and extra tablespoon of butter and it cane out fluffy and smooth . I added a full one teaspoon and a quarter to half of salt . It was perfect .

Made it with Citrus infused chicken breast and green beans, I usually do roasted potatoes or rice. Wanted to do something different. I always hope that when I search for a recipe that All Recipes pops up, I trust the recipes you put out. I have not been disappointed yet

I made a few variations with my recipe; I left the skins on the potatoes. I also chose to use my blender instead of a masher to cut down on time, adding 3/4 cup more milk and 2 more tbsp of butter to the sauce mixture to help the blender along. Came out so creamy and delicious!  Thank you for this easy guide to mashed potatoes

They were fine per the given directions. I added garlic salt and a few tablespoons of sour cream. I also used almond milk (that's all I had in the fridge)-didn't seem to make the consistency any different. I left about 1/3 of the skins on. Skins on is obviously a personal preference, but everyone in my family loves them that way.

Recipe was easy I just didn’t peel the potatoes first I boiled them and then peeled them. I made it using 6 potatoes. And added more butter. Salt to taste and pepper from a grinder is best to use.

Great, simple & classic. I made a few slight changes like doing half whipping cream to the milk & added just a little hunk of cream cheese. Add your "broth" slowly, I ended up with WAY too much, almost ended up with runny mashed potatoes but it came out perfect!

Great easy mashed potatoes recipe especially for someone making  mashed potatoes from scratch for the first time i did have to add more butter though the recipe says 2 tablespoons of butter but i ended up having to use 1 stick of butter and overall they turned out great.

Great!  Maybe a little more milk than needed, but it is hard to say when the potatoes are measured in weight.  I added a little extra butter.  Great basic mashed potato recipe.

Super easy and delicious. I'm always concerned the milk will be too much when I pour it in, but it ends up being the perfect consistency once all mixed together.

Definitely be aware of the amount of milk you add! I made this with my cousin and we almost ended up with potato soup. We had to drain some of the milk mixture, but it was otherwise very tasty with some turkey gravy.

I made it exactly as instructed. The trick is to ensure the potatoes aren't over boiled. They need to be a bit firm so that the final product doesn't come out runny.

This is one of those recipes that makes you realize you know diddly-squat in the kitchen. A perfect raitio of ingredients helps eliminate the need of guessing and ending up with stucco or mashed potato soup. I doubled the recipe and used leftovers in other recipes. Thank you for the recipe.

4.7.18  Life is full of surprises, and today I had one.  I’ve been cooking for a long time, and seldom, have I ever used a recipe for mashed potatoes.  Not sure exactly why I decided to do so today, but I can only tell you how glad I am that I did.  I thought 1 cup milk and butter was going to be too much for 2 lbs of potatoes, but I used all of it, and these were the creamiest, best mashed potatoes that I’ve ever had.  Awesome recipe, would give it 10 stars if I could!

Must heat butter & milk - it makes a HUGE difference! Nice & creamy, add a boatload of butter IF YOU WANT but you do not need to. I added a tbsp extra of butter on top & was perfect.

It was pretty good if a little bland. Took some ideas from the commentors and heated the potatoes after draining them to get rid of the water. Also doubled the amount of boiling time. Gravy is pretty necessary. I also used a little more butter. Pretty good for learning to make mashed potatoes, if somewhat generic.

This recipe ruined our Thanksgiving meal! It turned our potatoes into potato soup. It made us laugh, we made a memory, but it was pretty sad! We ended up pouring it into cereal bowls and drizzling the slop with our perfect turkey gravy.

This is the wayI learned how to make mashed potatoes as a child, I do use less milk and sometimes I use 5% cream as well.

These were just as the title says--pretty basic. I did add more butter than called for. I heated the milk and butter in the microwave, and it did help the potatoes stay warm.

Tastes just like my mom's mashed potatoes. This was SOOO easy to make! The only ingredient that I changed was instead of regular dairy milk, I used almond milk and I can't tell a difference. It's perfect for Thanksgiving, Christmas, and it goes with any southern meal. I love that it's not too thick, but not too creamy; it's a perfect balance. I also cooked a pack of McCormick's brown gravy, and it goes well with the mashed potatoes.

Just whipped these up to go with a nice roast and gravy.   Great basic recipe, just add or minus milk or butter for your own taste.

It was pretty good! Just some helpful tips for more flavor: cook the potatoes for at least 35-40 mins for more creamy mashed potatoes. I added some basil leaves and it really gave it a lot of flavor. I also added a little more butter because 2 tablespoons is not enough! Overall, good for beginners but it needs more flavor.

Good, basic mashed potato recipe. I do agree with those that said it needed more butter, but with me trying to make things a bit healthier, this was just fine. Thanks for sharing. :)

For 5 lbs. of red potatoes (NO, they aren't gummy!), I heated up 2-1/2 C 1% milk with 1-1/2 sticks of butter; Cut up the potatoes into chunks with about 2T Kosher salt and boiled them at high altitude for about 25 minutes until they were fork tender. Used a potato masher before adding the hot milk & butter, then used my electric mixer to make them creamy. Added Lawry's Seasoned Salt and Seasoned Pepper to taste, and they're in my crockpot, waiting until we leave for my friend's house! This is basic Mashed Potatoes 101 - keep 'em simple, folks!

Awesome simple recipe.  Heat milk and butter in a sauce pan. I add some minced garlic and top with shredded cheddar for a special night.  Sub cream for milk if you arent watching calories

Easy to make and good basic recipe that can be altered to fit your taste buds desire. I added 1/2 cup onions chopped, 2 tbsp chopped garlic, sauce  in 1/2 tbsp of olive oil for 5 to 8 mins. I then added this mix when I was mix all ingredients.

The key is to add the milk slowly... which I learned the hard way! We managed to mix enough to get them to an acceptable consistency so they were salvageable, but lesson learned. Besides my error, they were delicious.

Straight forward and delicious! I just add room temp butter and heat my milk in the microwave. The picture threw me off bc it looked a bit runny for my tastes but you can add as little or as much milk as you want depending on how soupy or thick you want the mashed potatoes. Also i leave the skins in,  it makes this super simple.  I pick the large skins out after the mashing and leave some of the small ones in,  skins are good for you and i tend to like the taste. This comes out delicious!

I believe there was too much of the sauce. Brown gravy really helps this recipe. Adding a bit of half and half, or heavy cream would really improve this recipe.

I wanted a simple and easy mashed potato recipe, and that's exactly what this is. The texture and consistency was perfect, and the milk and butter mixture gave it a really good flavor base to allow others to add to for their own tastes. This just might be my new go to! :)

Super easy to make! I love that the potatoes aren't saturated in butter; people can add more or less to their individual preference. Very fluffy. I will definitely be making these again and again!

It was pretty good. The only thing is in order to get my mashed potatoes warm again, I had to put them in a pot. This made the consistency of the potatoes change from fluffy, to dough-y.  I added some garlic powder for taste and it was better.

So simple yet delicious! Heating the milk and butter is so smart. Keeps the potatoes much warmer and makes them very smooth in the end. I took the suggestion of a user and added 6 cloves of garlic to the water, then mashed them with the potatoes.

perfect consistency... I too would add more butter, and garlic salt instead of salt and pepper- but that's personal preference!

Tasted bland and flat, one dimensional. Not nearly enough butter. Using Yukon Gold potatoes would increase flavor.

Will definitely make it again! It's so easy and yummy! But I agree with the other review, about not adding the milk and butter mixture all at a time. Just keep on adding bit by bit until it became the texture you like. Although it's mashed potatoes, everyone has different preference of the texture?

This was a really good mashed potato recipe! Nice and simple like I like them! I used more butter and they were still a little bland, but I prefer a blank slate I can work with to something with too much going on! This will become my go-to!

This is how I was taught to make mashed potatoes while growing up. Although I never heated the milk and butter. This makes a big difference in keeping the potatoes hot. I drained the potatoes once they got tender, set them back on the turned off stove burner (gas range) and added butter. Mashed them with a turned off electric mixer and began adding milk, turned on mixer and continued to add milk (maybe 1/2 cup) until desired consistency was reached and they were fluffy. This is a wonderful recipe for basic mashed potatoes.

I added a touch more butter, but if you've got good 'taters, all you need is a little milk, butter, salt'n pepper. Perfect.

A lovely, simple method that produces delicious mashed potatoes every time! Only thing extra I do is throw in some chopped up chives to add a little bit of colour.

The only thing we changed is we added garlic to the butter and mashed ours in the kitchen aid mixer. We used whole organic milk. The potatoes taste as good as the whipped potatoes at high end restaurants. Highly recommend this easy to make recipe!! We used Klondike Rose potatoes (red skin golden flesh bought at target). Enjoy!!

I, like another reviewer, would have thought that this wasn't enough butter. I always add a LOT more butter than this to my mashed potatoes...usually about half a stick or so. Although I might prefer them this way, this recipe produces pretty good mashed potatoes as written, and I'm glad that I tried them because I'm pretty sure it's a lot less fatty when made with 2% milk than the potatoes that I usually make. This might become my regular "weeknight" potato recipe to make things a little lighter...although I might add a SMIDGEN more butter. :)

I always use this recipe to make mashed potatoes.
I use 4 medium russet potatoes,or four meduium yukon golden potatoes.
I also add some cheddar cheese,which makes it extra special!

These are a good basic for gray and mashed potatoes. Next time will add milk slower though as they were a bit runny and I had to add instant mashed potatoes to thicken them up.

Good basic recipe - a bit too much milk for my liking.  Just add a little at a time to get the right consistency for your own tastes.

I like basic potatoes as this recipe calls for.  As does my husband.  I make a few changes though:

I use a 5 lb bag of potatoes, boil them, mash them up, put a 1/2 stick butter in to melt, then mash again, add the milk (usually about 3 tbsp), salt and pepper and whip with a electric mixture and it's nice and smooth.  My family loves it.  For holidays I double the batch and use 1 stick of butter.  

I havent' tried melting the butter and milk first, I may try that next time tho.

Excellent and simple!  I never warmed the milk/butter ahead of time, but it's excellent.  Also, I keep the skins on for health and taste (well-scrubbed).  It's delicious!

Very good and very simple. The 1 cup of milk may seem, initially, to be too much but after folding the milk into the mashed potato mix, it will incorporate nicely and give a smooth texture to the mashed potato. With that much milk though, this recipe is not ideal for 'next day potato'.... i.e. should be eaten right away. Thanks and really yummy!

Great recipe! I tripled it and it made a HUGE amount! Freezes well for future use. I added several cloves of mashed roasted garlic at the end. Also added a bar of cream cheese (remember I tripled it) along with salt and pepper. Everyone loved it!

bit too bland for my family and I. Used evaporated milk and cream cheese, and it had a faint creamy sort of taste to it. Seemed just okay to me, dad took one little bite and said it was too plain. You definitely need to add more to this recipe, but its a good start.

Good basic recipe. Might be better with some rosemary or garlic. Also, I found them dry because I spread them out in a serving dish and put them in a warming drawer. Next time I will make these up just before eating them.

Good recipe - warming the milk and butter does make a difference.  I added some garlic cloves to the boiling potatoes and then mashed them with the potatoes to add more flavor.  I think it would be a little bland for my family if I made it "as is."  But, that is the beauty of a simple recipe, you can adjust to meet your family's preferences.

Great base for mashed potatoes. Used about six small russets to equal the 2 pounds, which was  perfect for the amount of milk and butter it called for. Just eyeballed the amount of seasoning I wanted to add.

A basic mashed potatoe recipe.  Nice, creamy texture.  I used half and half cream and added some garlic seasoning for garlic bread. You MUST use russet potatoes!!! IT'S A MUST!!!!!

Good, but not the best mashed potatoes I've ever had.  I used garlic salt instead of regular salt to season the potatoes.

I did this recipe for 15, subbed 1 cup of milk for half & half I had and added a few shakes of garlic salt.  They taste pretty good but my greatest difficulty is salting food so I think it's a little salty.  I wish Joe had said how much salt to start out with.  We'll see how the family reacts tonight...

My husband likes mashed potatoes whereas I like whipped spuds, so I tried this recipe to make him happy. :) I microwaved the milk and butter together on medium until the butter was melted... Oh, and after draining the potatoes I returned them to the pot and put the pot back on the burner (electric stove so heat turned off but still hot) for a moment to evaporate any excess moisture. Makes for even better potatoes! Next time, I'll add cheese and maybe garlic salt. Thanks so much for the recipe, Jon!

Great recipe, turned out perfect, and very easy to make.  I did what the other person said about boiling garlic and mashing it with the potatoes and it was superb.  Thanks.

I enjoy making different recipes just to try a little variety. But this basic potatoe recipe is hard to beat. This is the way my wife makes her mashed potatoes and when I want to make a recipe that I KNOW will be really good, then I make them like this. This is the best way I've found yet to make really good tasting mashed potatoes.

a little to bland for my taste.
I added a touch of garlic powder.
I used 1/2 the milk as some suggested and it turned out to have a good consistency.
