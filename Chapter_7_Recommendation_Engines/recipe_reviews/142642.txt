I have cooked many briskets in my life but never had one turn out as delicious and fall-apart tender as this one.  Briskets are hard to find in Southeastern Tennessee...when I ask a butcher, they always show me a Corned Beef Brisket.  So when I found a 6# flat beef brisket a few weeks ago, I snatched it up and put it in the freezer for a special occasion dinner.  Then along came this recipe and Easter dinner at the same time so I made the brisket exactly as the recipe called for, except I didn't allow for the extra 2# pounds of my brisket. So there was way too much sauce for the too-small roasting pan which made a big mess in my oven. The brisket was so juicy it didn't need the added beef broth. All that said, this was the most delicious brisket ever. Everyone in my large family was raving about it!! There is only enough leftover (I had to hide it) for some BBQ sandwiches tonight.  This is the only way I will ever cook brisket again.  By the way, this is my first review...I was never moved by a recipe to write one before.

This recipe is very tender and juicy. I took the advise of the other reviewers and cut down on the salt. After the brisket was finished cooking I scraped off the seasoning and discarded. Put the brisket aside then used the juice and made a sauce to pour over the brisket. My whole family loved it.

I've had this recipe in my box to try since it was first published.  However, I've never made (or maybe even eaten?) brisket before, so I didn't realize it's not a grocery store meat staple (or even a butcher staple here in my small town).  However, I finally found a brisket and the search was WORTH IT!  Even though everything in me wanted to add liquid smoke (I don't even know why...just because I *thought* I should), I resisted and stayed true to the recipe (um, w/out black pepper because I detest black pepper) and I'm so glad I did.  It is AMAZING, as is!  I did not find it too salty (in fact, I added a little sea salt to mine at service) and the chili powder is spot on.  My brisket was a touch over 4lbs.  I'm going to start stockpiling brisket so I'll always have one on hand in the future, just for this recipe.  The day I could finally use my brisket ended up being a weekday, so I prepared the spices, rubbed the meat, then tossed it in the a large crock pot and poured a can of beef broth over it all and cooked on low for about 10 hours.  THANKS for a fantastic recipe, ChristineD!!!!!  If you haven't tried this yet (and w/only 40 reviews, lots of you are missing out!), DO IT!

Great recipe... I added a few ingredients to the rub: 2 tsp ground mustard and 1 crushed bayleaf, and also a little more water to the pan... it turned out great and very tender... I had some "Sauce" left over from the "Sylvia's Ribs" I made the other night and served it with the brisket... awesome combination!

If you take out the seasoned salt and use 2tsp dry mustard and a crushed bayleaf instead, this is an exact match for Tom Perini's recipe (also attributed to him at the food tv site via Paula Deen). He's quite famous here in TX as the owner of Perini Ranch Steakhouse, so I knew if I could trust any oven brisket recipe it would be this one. Thanks for adding it. **UPDATE - Don't panic if you check the brisket after a few hours and it's "done" according to a meat thermometer but tough and dry -- brisket needs to REALLY cook down to become tender, and the full cooktime listed here is absolutely correct. The liquid will keep it from getting dried out, but you do NOT rely on a thermometer for this cut of meat, it needs to cook FOREVER for the connective tissue to break down and get tender. Also, in Texas you can't buy a 4lb brisket - about 9-15lbs is the norm, so I can see why some people are having trouble figuring this recipe out.

I hope I can stop licking my plate long enough to write this review! I made the recipe as written and finished the last hour of cook time on the grill using indirect heat. WOW! Hubby and daughter stuffed themselves and I have to say that the only bad thing about this brisket, is that we were too full to take our evening walk!!I have been known to eat leftover pizza for breakfast, but I think I will have a brisket sandwich come day light. :D

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for.Excellent!I added 1 tablespoon smoked paprika and rubbed the mixture onto the brisket.Then sprinkled liquid smoke ontop.After cooking at 350 for 1 hour in my roaster uncovered I added the beef broth and covered it then reduced the temp to 220 and cooked for about 4 hours. Then at that point it shredded beautifully and was so moist and flavorful it did't even need sauce although bbq sauce would be great!

Simply wonderful.  We like cumin, so I added a some of that at well.  It turned out very tender, and was a nice change from the way I usually see brisket (bbq).

Fantastic - I made 2 minor changes in that I used Chile Lime Pepper & dark brown sugar instead of Chili Pepper & white sugar - the meat just fell apart & it had such great flavor - thank you

Have been wanting to make this forever. I finally found a brisket! So I go to get my spice mixture together and I can't find my chili powder! No time or $$ to go to the store. Since the chili powder is such a big part of the spice mixture at first I think I will have to find another recipe. And then I decided to try and find a substitute online.  Sucess! ( 1tsp paprika, 2 tsp cumin, 1 tsp cayenne, 1tsp oregano, 1 tsp garlic powder)  Just mix it all up and then measure out the two TBS. I had everything and the bonus was there was no salt in the homemade chili powder. This Brisket was wonderful!! I served it with mashed potatoes and asparagus. I poured some of the juice on my taters and meat for myself and put some Stubbs barbeque sauce on my DH meat. This will be my go to recipe for brisket. Thanks ChristineD

Just finished serving this for Christmas dinner.  Made it for the first time, wow, it was so great.  The smoky flavor that comes from the chili powder of the dry rub is excellent.  So tender.  Once I sliced it, my wife poured some of the pan juices on the meat, and it was simply amazing. I highly recommend this!

Excellent Recipe!!  It was "fall apart" wonderful. I made it for my entire family and unfortunately there were no leftovers to enjoy the next day...I guess I'll need to make a bigger one next time.  The rub is what makes this so great...I used New Mexico red chili powder and I've never had more compliments on a dish.  Thanks!

After visiting Austin, TX and having THE best BBQ I've ever had....ever @ Franklin Barbecue, I vowed to never ruin my palette by attempting to make my own brisket. But I did, almost immediately. I bought a 6 pounder from my butcher, followed this recipe, except I rubbed the beef with dijon mustard prior to applying the dry rub and added one bottle of stout and a few dashes of liquid smoke to the broth. Oh, and I added a teaspoon of hickory powder to the dry rub (helps bring out that smokey flavor). It exceeded my expectations by miles. It's not quite Franklin's slow smoked version, but you will be hard pressed to find an oven recipe better than this. I am cooking an 8 pounder for a party today. It should be noted that a 4lb brisket is very small and almost impossible to find in some instances, so you need to increase your cooking time accordingly to the size of your brisket

This was my first attempt at brisket, and the cut I got was really lean and only about 1.5 lbs, so I had to modify a bit, but I tried to stick to the ingredients and method as much as possible. For the rub I used 1 tbsp chili powder, 1 tsp for the rest of the spices, omitted the seasoned salt and subbed in 1 tbsp dried onion flakes for onion powder (all I had on hand). I halved the cooking times since my cut was small, but otherwise stuck to the instructions and the flavor was FANTASTIC!! Seriously, the prep was so simple and the spices were spot on. I will make again!

This was a wonderful seasoning and very easy for a first timer like me. I am fully convinced that buying the brisket from an actual butcher added to the flavor of this meal. I took other's advice and didn't add the extra salt. I also, instead of cooking at 300 for 3 hours, reduced it to 200 for 4 hours and it still came out wonderful. The only reason I changed the cooking time was so it would be ready by the time my husband came home from work! Excellent

This was really good.  It was tender and juicy.  The jus was very flavorful, in fact, I have some left although the brisket is gone and I am freezing it.  Wouldn't think of throwing it away.  Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent recipe and oh' so tender.  Everyone loved it.  The only thing I did different was pull it out of the oven with 20mins cook time remaining, drain half of the stock out of the pan and add 1/2 cup bbq sauce to remaining stock in the pan and brush the brisket with the sauce.  Then I slapped it on the grill in my pan for 20mins to give it that crispy bbq edge we Texans know and love!

Fantastic!  I had never prepared a beef brisket before, so I followed the recipe pretty closely with only a few substitutions/exceptions.  My BF doesn't care much for chili powder but I still wanted to try this one since it doesn't involve BBQ sauce.  Therefore, I used a suggestion from another review for a chili powder substitute (paprika, cumin, cayenne, oregano and garlic powder) - worked perfectly and gave it a little warmth.  Wasn't sure I would like that, but it turned out delicious!  Also added a few splashes of Worcestershire when I added the broth.  End result was a little salty for us even though I cut the salt a bit, so I will omit the regular salt totally next time (leaving just the seasoned salt).  While the meat was resting, I added a cup of water to the juices (next time will add 2 because it was still a bit too rich) and then thickened with a 3T water + 3T cornstarch mixture.   I reheated leftovers today for lunch - was heavenly!  I also froze a serving to try another day, will see how that works.  Thanks for this recipe!  Absolutely love it.

I made this today for a church group and everyone said how good it was and asked for the recipe.  The only change I made was I used an 8 pound brisket.  I think if I used a 4 lb. brisket I would only use half of the rub as it covered and seasoned the 8 lb. one very well.  This was very good and I will make it again.

I made this last night and cut the salt down quite a bit. I added just 1 tsp salt and 1 tsp lawrys season salt and it was awesome. I also had about a 1.5 lbs brisket, so I for sure didnt need 2 T of salt. Everything else I left the same though and it turned out great. I cooked it in a dutch oven and it was just as tender as briskets I have cooked for 8 hours. I will never do one in the crock pot again (as long as I am home to cook it). The meat just fell apart, I agree though that the rest time is very much needed. I also added sliced onion to the top when I added the broth and they were delicious as well. Served with steamed veggies and a potato/cauliflower mash...very good!

Very easy and very good recipe! Instead of using all the different seasonings, I used Emerils Essence and added the sugar and garlic powder. Followed the directions and had a very good brisket to serve on New Years Eve and had tons of compiments! My brisket had a layer of fat on it, which i put facing up, so as it cooked, the fat seeped down the meat to keep it juicy. After it was done, I scraped the layer of fat off and discarded. Super easy and super delicious, what more could you ask for?

The end result, was a juicy brisket. However getting there was different. I normally smoke mine in a smoker or low heat on a covered grill. However, I started this out in the oven, Followed it to a T, with the temp at 350 for an hour and then I lowered the temp to 300 and after 3 hours, meat was still tough, not up to 160 degrees but the internal temp...and totally needed the oven for other things. Made the choice to pull out the Nessco roaster. Placed the brisket in it and poured extra broth in it and turned the temp down to 250 and by in the morning. It was tender and just right. I will say nice flavor, but it was on the salty side. I'd make again but I'd cut the salt way down by half. It's a good and decent recipe. TY

Like MANY of the reviewers I've made a BUNCH of briskets over the years and thought mine was the ONLY way to prepare it ..... well ... I now have modified my recipe to incorporate much of this version. I use my own rub and will continue to. Mine is similar but spicier and I start off with 3 hours of mesquite smoke but in a COLD smoker so as not to start the cooking process. Once that's done I follow the COOKING piece of this EXACTLY and it is really a fine end result. Thank you, ChristineD for teaching an old dog a new trick!!!

Sad that I had made this for Easter with such high hopes.  I dont think that brisket is made for the oven, I prefer it smoked.

This is an absolutely perfect recipe, not too salty as others have mentioned, the only thing I added was a good bit of liquid smoke to the broth.  Your home is going to smell awesome while this is cooking!

I can't believe I never cooked a brisket before. This was so full of flavor and mouthwatering! It may be the best recipe I've tried on this site so far and I've tried lots! I've ordered more brisket from the butcher!

My only previous experiences with brisket have been at a home in Texas and at BBQ restaurants; can't believe I made something this good in my own kitchen on my first try!  I'm so happy with this recipe!  I subbed celery salt for the seasoning salt (it's what I had) and used kosher salt instead of table; found the meat perfectly seasoned and wonderfully tender without completely falling apart.  I'll be making this whenever brisket goes on sale at my local butcher counter.  Thanks for a great recipe!

FYI:  It does not have the smoky BBQ flavor that I associate with brisket, but it was delicious and tender.

Sorry folks...we've been making smoked briskets and this is not a Best Ever Brisket...it is, however, a good pot roast.  Instead of beef broth, I added a bottle of beer and the last hour of cooking ladled my favorite BBQ sauce over the meat.  It made a tasty sandwich...but so would any pot roast made the same way.  I prefer a smoked brisket to this method.

Loved this recipe could not wait till it was done. Tender as could be. Only thing I think I will change is use half the black pepper and regular chili powder I used Mexican hot chili powder and it was great for me but wife could not eat it to spicy.  lol

Recipe didn't say to sear the meat first.  This would've improved the recipe greatly.  I may try to cook it in the crockpot next time.  Also, make sure to use only the amount of "rub" that stays on the meat itself.  Do not pile on the extra on top of the meat, it will simply burn.

Good but not great, did have a nice flavor but I mine wasn't as tender as I would have liked it.  Perhaps next time I will sear in a pan or on the grill first, it was missing that crispy outside and tender center that  I was looking for.

I made this last night for dinner and my whole family loved it, even the youngest children! I did make a few changes based on the other reviews, but very little. I made this in a dutch oven, added a bbq rub and after the 1st hour I added only a cup of beef broth, let it set up for 30 minutes and then sliced and put a little smoked bbq sauce on the side! YUMMY! and EASY!

I had a 1-lb recipe so cut the seasonings into fourth, and threw everything together in the crockpot (after dissolving the spices into the broth). Put it on low for 8 hours and it came out tender and juicy. This is THE tastiest brisket I've ever had. This recipe is definately a keeper.

I used this recipe to cook my first brisket. It was excellent. I made one change though. I didn't have any beef broth, so I used coffee instead(saw that on a different recipe). I will be using this recipe again. Also, some people may want to use less pepper.

This was amazing! It was so juicy and moist! I had never made one before so this was unchartered ground for me. As everyone has said, be sure it is a BEEF brisket! I mentioned to Christine before making it, I'd have to change up the rub as my husband is allergic to powdered onion & garlic. She was right, you can play with the rub a bit to suit your taste, I rubbed it down with minced garlic first and added paprika & ground mustard to make up for the loss of the other two powders. My butcher told me to cook it fat side up (I wouldn't have known to do that, maybe some don't). We had it for dinner two nights with mashed potatoes and vegetables and there wasn't enough left for the BBQ sandwiches I planned! My husband "eats to live" and rarely comments on anything... last night he asked me to make it again and said it was "the best ever". Thanks, Christine, I'm buying another next run to the market.

We loved this!  Our butcher did not have brisket, but recommended a bottom roast.  Like other reviewers, I did not use the regular salt.  Even my seven year old had seconds.  Did not last long in this beef eating household.

This is really good and so easy to throw together.  I used the seasoned salt but ommitted the regular salt just b/c some people said it was too salty and I figured we could add salt to taste to the cooked meat.  I also subbed paprika for half of the chili powder b/c I was worried it would be too strong of a chili powder taste for my kids.  My hubby made sandwiches with it and added bbq sauce and loved it.  I had mine as is and it was delicious.  Thanks!

Absolutely moist and delectable; fall apart brisket!  Based on other reviews, I coated the meat in a dry mustard.  Instead of the broth, I used a very stout beer (Guiness) with a tbsp+ of liquid smoke.  I then mixed the dry marinade, coated the meat with it and placed in the slow cooker.  I added 1 large onion on top of the brisket.  Cooked for about 6 hours.  

I've made this recipe several times and this time it turned out perfect.  I plan to use the modifications I used today to make again!  Delicious!

This is OMG delicious and turns out tender and yummy every time I make it.  The gravy is just the way my family likes it, pepper and all.  It's in my monthly rotation and I can always feel sure of a happy family when it is on the dinner table.

I had never made a Beef Brisket before and there is a local BBQ place that has wonderfrul Brisket.  My husband wanted me to try to make it, so I pulled up this recipe and gave a whirl!  GLAD I DID!  I have made it twice now (Christmas & Super Bowl Party) and will be making it for years to come.  When I went to Sam's Club to buy the Brisket there was two cuts, a Choice and a Flat.  I went witht he Flat both times.  It is a little bit more a pound, but has the majority of the wasted excess fat cut off of it already.

Best Ever Brisket...the name says it all!  This was every bit as astounding as my husbands 16 hour smoker brisket...his words.  This was my first brisket and I followed the rub with less salt, ground mustard and bay leaf (in place of season salt) per some suggestions...I rubbed the brisket in the morning and vacuum packed in a canister for 5 hours before putting in the preheated 350 oven (not sure if it aided in breaking down the meat, but will do the same every time).  Served with brussel sprouts sauteed in red wine vinegar with ham, scallions and garlic (sugar, salt, pepper and ground mustard added after sauteed).  This is a keeper!

This was by far, the best brisket recipe I have found.  I used Soul Seasoning for the seasoned salt.  My entire family (from our 2 year old twins to 12 year old picky daughter) loved the flavor and devoured the brisket.  I will be using this brisket recipe again and again.  Thank you for sharing!!

This makes a very nice brisket, tender and easy to make.  The tenderness was impressive.  I have a sensitive stomach, so the chili powder was a little more than I should have used; however you could hardly taste it.  I had a problem with the hot pan and the foil, and I would suggest if you have a very large pan that you wrap the foil under it prior to starting the cooking so that you can just fold it over the top an hour in.  The hot pan and foil combination was a juggling act for me and though I thought I had it covered, I didn't do as good of a job as I thought, and the meat was drier than I had hoped.  I think I will try the mustard recommended instead of the chili pepper in the recipe the next time.  This was definitely good, and very easy to prepare.  The gravy made was a bit more spicy than I would have wanted.  So next time, less chili pepper (I probably will try 1 T next time around.)  Definitely a recipe to use again and again.  Tender, easy, tasty.

I cannot believe how INCREDIBLE this brisket recipe is or how much my kids LOVED it!  I did back off on the chili powder as they don't like things too spicy, but it is crazy easy to make and tastes like you slaved on it.  Thank you for sharing it with us!!!

this was great. I also added very little salt as some other reviewers suggested and I used low sodium chicken stock rather than beef stock because that's what I had on hand.

So, here is the thing: I've made this twice now, but with a roast (cause that is what I had.) Then we shred it and serve as taco meat with soft fried corn tortillas. WE LOVE IT!! I suppose one day I will do it with a brisket.....

Tender, and moist, it melts in your mouth.  The broth mixes with the seasonings and meat juices to make one of the best aux jus I have ever had.  We saved it and used it on rice for another meal in itself.

I made this for the 4th of July, and it turned out great.  I fortified my beef broth by boiling a beef bone, onion and garlic.  Boiled these in a sauce pot, strained the stock and added this hot stock to the brisket when it was called for.

Three things:
1) Very EASY to make.
2) Brisket was super TENDER, almost fall apart.
3) Way too SALTY, which got it 3 stars in my book.
I will try again because the texture of the meat came out wonderful but will adjust the seasoning.

came out great. i left out the regular salt like most people suggested and just went with the seasoning salt. i also added baby carrots and sliced onions for the last 90 minutes of cooking time.if you like gravy, and i was able to make a great one from the liquid with a little corn starch, you might want to double the amount of beef stock, broth. the gravy was terrific but we had to use it sparingly as there wasnt quite as much as i would have liked (i served this with mashed potatos). excellent meal though.....even my youngest children loved it. this recipe is definately going into the rotation. takes a little while to cook but there is almost no work involved.

This was very good.  I used only about 1/4 tsp of salt because I always reduce the salt.  My brisket was only about 2 lbs, so I cooked it for a bit less time.  It was tender and a bit spicy.  My 4 year old loved it!

Wonderful! The only thing I did differently was to use brown sugar instead of white. Will definitely make again (and again!).

Made this for a picnic type get together last summer and everyone loved it.  I didn't want the chili powder to take over the flavor so I only used 1/2 tsp.  Good stuff!

It was my first time making brisket. This helped a load. And my four other dinner guest agree that it was fabulous!! :) only weir part is It says it serves 16. My brisket was just slightly smaller. By less than half a pound and I only fed 4 full grown men and myself(a lady). Doesnt make it any less amazing. Just depends on your serving sizes I'm sure :)

FANTASTIC recipe!  I added two additional ingredients:  4-5 sliced onions (to set the brisket on and they are delish to serve with the gravy over the brisket) and a bottle of beer in addition to the beef broth.  Resting the meat is the key to juiciness, and with a brisket, make sure you cut against the grain.  This was to die for!

I loved the flavor but the beef broth evaporated and burnt on the bottom of the pan so I should have kept an eye on it and added more when I needed it. But I liked the flavor and the rub.  I think that that Brisket could have been more moist if I added more liguid to the bottom.  Thats the only thing butI would totally make it again and definetly will !

The brisket was beyond tender, but was WAY TOO salty.  Next time I'll use 1/2 of the "salts" & chili powder, as it had a little too much heat for our liking.

This was my first time making a brisket. It came out very tender but VERY SALTY. I followed the recipe but next time will do a low salt beef broth, and lower sodium on the other ingredients. I was quite disappointed as this was to be my main meat for Christmas dinner. Off to honeybake I goon this Christmas eve afternoon for a turkey. :(

The name says it all!  I followed the recipe exactly except I used a 12 oz. bottle of Guinness Beer instead of the beef broth and it came out perfectly tender and moist.  The beer seemed to add a little something to the taste.  My family devoured it and it's now on my list of standards.  Very easy to prepare on a busy day...just throw it in and forget it.  What more can you ask for?!?

I made this 2 days ago for my husband, who normally likes beef rare, and not spicy. He LOVED IT! I would use less chili powder. I cut down the salt and will reduce it even more. Note: I had a smaller brisket, 2 lbs and for the 2nd part, roasted it for 3 hours at 200 degrees. It was so tender, juicy and flavorful. I scraped off  the rub like one reviewer suggested.

Great recipe. Very easy to make. One thing that I added was roasted garlic. I slow roasted elephant garlic and cut small pockets in the brisket. Then I put some of the roasted garlic in the pockets and followed the rest of the recipe.

I made this the night before I was going to serve it so that I could slice it and let it sit in the juices so it would be super moist.  Let me tell you, it was absolutely amazing!  Here are my few changes:  I only added some seasoned salt, not the other tbsp. of salt it called for.  I used Low Sodium Beef Broth. I also used 1 TBSP of Chili powder and 1 TBSP of smoked Paprika and kept everything else the same.  This was so tasty!  Even my 7 year old son loved it!  Make this brisket for sure--it truly is the "Best Ever Brisket!"  Thanks Christine for sharing it with everyone!

I followed directions, but mine came out dry.  I also thought the chili powder was too much.  May try it again with ancho chili powder.  I wound up mixing the leftover meat with salsa & making enchiladas with it.

Excellent flavor, very tender & juicy.  It was saltier than what we're used to so I'll cut back on the salt the next time I make it.

delicious! I liked tearing the peices apart and adding sweet brown sugar and hickory bbq sauce, heating that up, and putting it on toasted hamburger buns for a sandwich! My husband could not stop complimenting how good it was!

Here goes one more FIVE!  Oh, my!  YUM!  This is such an easy way to fix a family-pleasing meal in short order!  Just mix a few spices, rub it on the meat, stick it in the oven.  It's just as easy as that!  I followed your recipe exactly with the exception of the tablespoon of salt.  It was perfect!  I'm an oven-type person, and that's the method I'd prefer for this meat (I have the luxury of having the time, though).  Thanks, Christine!  This was wonderful!  Definitely a keeper!

We thought this was excellent! I used all the ingredients listed as recipe reads but cooked it different. I put it in the slow cooker on low for 8 hours after 6 hours I took it out and shredded it to soak up the juices for the last 2 hours. Thanks Christine. I will be making this again.

My brisket was just over 3 pounds, but I followed the recipe exactly as stated and it worked perfectly.  My whole house smelled awesome while this was in the oven.   I especially liked the kick that came from the chili powder and the black pepper & it was so tender.  I received compliments from everyone who tried it.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Christine!

This was my first time making brisket and it was so easy. My whole family loved it. Next time I will cut back on the salt but,I will surely make this agian and again. I served it with bread, pickels, onions and bbq sauce. SOOOOO Good. Just as good as a bbq resturant.

Far too salty! I cut back on the salt as another reviewer suggested but only by a 1/2 tsp and that was not enough. I literally WASHED IT in the sink the next day in order to be able to eat the leftovers. For my tastes, the chili flavor was a bit too overpowering. After a good scrubbing under warm water (LOL) it went down just fine.

This was really good! My husband loved it. I think I would go a little lighter on the salt next time though (maybe half the table salt). This recipe is a keeper though.

I followed the recipe to the letter.  Add it came out absolutely perfect.  Cooked it for Easter dinner today, and took it over some friends.  Everyone loved it.  I stuck my chest out a little bit.  But definitely will cook again, super easy.  Used the drippings to pour over the meat after cutting, and adding some of my favorite bottled BBQ sauce Sweet Baby Ray's for a finger biting excitement.  Thanks for a great recipe, I am on main dish duty for the next month so keep the good ones coming.

Way to salty. I read many say that but figured I would be ok I like things slightly salty. Was overbearing. The chili powder didnt work for me either. 

I think with half the salt and little to no chili powder it would be better. 

Cooked a 4lb piece as directed and I found it slightly dry. Will try it once more before I give up on it.

It was just OK.  I didn't add the season salt because several reviewers said it was too salty.  Wish I would have added it or a little more salt because it could have used it.  Did add 2 tsb ground mustard and 2 crushed bayleafs again per reviewers.  Still think it is missing something.  It needs something more, but not sure what that is. I actually rubbed seasoning on it night before too. Hubby and daughter ate it and honestly didn't complain, but not sure if I'd spend $20 and make that again.  Sorry.

WOW~!!  This was so awesome~I would never go thru all the bother of smoking a brisket again~this turned out so much better~we thickened the leftover juice and used it as gravy~MMMMM!!
I used my momma" club" roaster pan and that is always a sure vessel for perfect cooking~We cant wait to entertain and serve this  dish~thanks so much for sharing it with us~

I made this exactly as the recipe the first time and it was wonderful !  The second time I made it, I did cut the pepper back to 1/2 tablespoon of pepper and liked it even better.  This is the only recipe I use to make brisket and the meat always turns out moist and tender.

Fantastic! This was my first time making beef brisket and this recipe was very simple.  My cut of meat was about 5 1/2 pds, but I followed the recipe as is and it came out falling apart and melt in your mouth delicious!

Ask for the first cut - or a flat brisket.

Great spice rub - I did not have seasoning salt so I used paprika instead - cooked in my Dutch oven and it turned out great. I made gravy with the pan juices, adding a little extra beef stock and thickening with flour and water. I was concerned that it would be too spicy with all that chili powder, but it was great, just the slightest bit of kick under a lot of good flavor.

I made this for a special dinner and followed the directions exactly. The meat was very tender, but it was WAY to much seasoning. It was so salty, I added 2 cups of really hot water to it after slicing just so i could eat it. Not sure if I would follow the seasoning ever again.

Great brisket, fell right apart with no knife needed.  I made one slight change.  I put the brisket in the smoker for the last hour to give it a slightly smokey taste.

All I can say is... WOW !! This was the BEST Brisket I ever had.  It was the easiest thing I ever cooked, and the meat was like butter. Didn't even need a knife. The spices were perfect, and the gravy even had a nice little kick. People that i made it for could not stop raving about it. I will make it again...

Great recipe, the best brisket that I have ever done. Very juicy and tender. My family loved it. I did follow other cooks and added 1 tablespoon of Paprika and used brown sugar instead of white. My results were fantastic and will use this over and over again.

I subbed a small amount of cayenne pepper for the black pepper and omitted the seasoned salt because my son is allergic to those two ingredients.  The flavor was still excellent, although the meat did not turn out quite as tender as I expected.  My husband really enjoyed this and he is not usually a fan of any kind of oven-roasted beef.  I'm sure I'll be using this again, thanks for the great recipe.

Was wonderful. I had to substitute au jus for the beef broth. Used the BBQ sauce from Sylvias ribs. Went together very well. Had an eight pound brisket. Cut in half,one half BBQ and the other as written both were equally good. Thanks for the recipe. Will definately make again.

Made this for dinner last night, very moist and tender. Followed the recipe exactly but cut the time by 30 min due to time constraints but turned out perfect. Added flour to the broth after I took the meat out and made some gravy to serve with mashed potatos. SO DELIC, thanks for sharing. We will be making this again!

This was a very tasty brisket.  I substituted sea salt for the seasoned salt and I added three types of ground peppercorns:  white, red and black.  I punched holes in the brisket with a knife, applied the rub and let mine marinate over night.  I slow cooked mine for several hours.  It was scrumptiou, moist and fall apart tender.  My Mexican family loved this!!

Oh my goodness, this was so delicious!!  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I cut the measurements in half due to having only a two pound brisket.  I cooked it a little too long so it was a little dry, but that was my own error with the smaller size.  The flavor was amazing!!  I am eating some leftovers right now and I wish there was more!!  Try this, you won't be disappointed!!!

Way to much salt, I will probably leave out a Tablespoon of the regular salt next time. Otherwise it turned out very tender and delicious. I also cooked it longer than the recipe said.

I didn't use the tablespoon of seasoned salt as called for and it's still a bit on the salty side.  Other than that, it's truly a "best ever" brisket.

Followed the recipe as is, but did cut back on the salt per others reviews.  I thought it tasted just like a roast??!!

I would have given this a 5 star rating however the brisket was a little to salty. But not over bearing. I made this for myself, my other half and daughter. It was gone that night, he loved it. I would not cook this once it starts to get warm, as I made it for St. Patricks day and it was 75 out I had to turn the AC on due to cooking for 4 hours. This dish was very juicy and tender. I will be making this again with less salt ingredients. Thank you.

I had never made a brisket before. I was always afraid because I had heard that if you didn't cook it right, it would be tough. This recipe is outstanding!!!!!! This is THE BEST brisket I've had! Like another review wrote, its juicy on its own. Once you cover with foil and slow cook it, it juices right up. So if you don't have any beef broth on hand, I wouldn't worry about it. I will definitely be making this again.

Fantastic. I used a smaller brisket (2#) and halved the recipe. It worked wonderfully. This was a great into to cooking brisket.

This is an excellent recipe. I had just recently found a huge brisket on sale and decided to give it a try. Never having cooked brisket before I found this recipe and decided to give it a try and am very happy I did. Melt in your mouth tenderness and great flavor. Really recommend this.

My first brisket ever and it turned out phenomenal.  Lots of flavor and VERY moist.  Like others have noted...leave out the additional sale and it's perfect.

TOTALLY DELICIOUS!  I followed the recipe exactly as stated with no changes except I used a 4 pound point brisket which is a leaner cut of brisket.  I've been cooking briskets for years and this HAS to be the best recipe ever!  Thank you so much for sharing.  PS:  made it many times after with regular briskets and it's simply crazy delicious!

This was my first attempt at Brisket and I was quite pleased with how it turned out.  It was especially good the next day when I sliced it very thin and placed it in the crockpot with beef broth, celery and onion mixture and heated it on low all day.

Delicious, fall apart brisket. This was the first time that I made brisket and I was quite pleased with the end result. Very tender and it just falls apart. The flavor is good too.  I highly recommend this recipe. I know I will be making this again in the near future.

Excellent! Really, really good. I was out of seasoning salt so I did omit that, but otherwise kept it the same. My brisket was about 2 and 1/2 lbs because that was the biggest one my store had. I also didn't have a roasting pan, so I placed the brisket on a cooling rack on top of my deepest cookie sheet and very carefully put in the liquid in the bottom of that. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

We really enjoyed the flavors. I cut the chili & pepper by half and omitted the celery salt (none in the house) and there was still plenty of rich flavor. Many oohs and aahs. Even the toddler asked for seconds.

This was my first brisket.  I chose to rub it and refrigerate it overnight.  I did as the instructions listed but baked it covered at 250 degrees instead for 4 hours.  Timing of our dinner plans changed so I left it in the oven warming (170degrees) for another 4 hours.  Even with all of that, it was still juicy & received rave reviews from my guests (family will tell it like it is!).  It was a flavorful recipe and made the house smell wonderful.  I will no longer be hesitant when it comes to making brisket!  Thanks so much for sharing!

This was the first brisket I've ever cooked and it didn't disappoint.  My kids shied away a little when they first saw it uncovered (dark brown and covered with spices) but when I cut into it and gave them piece it was all over.  Forget sitting down just cut it up and eat with your fingers.  Thank you.

This was a brisket fail! The cook time was way over the top - at least for my oven. I would like to try again adjusting cook times, but where I live Brisket is almost impossible to find and expensive. What a bummer!

The rub and cooking method are great! I accidentally overcooked my brisket, though. Mine was well done at about the 3 hour mark, so next time I would cook it a little less, or just keep checking it. I also used only about 1 and a quarter tablespoons of chili powder because my 1 year old was eating it. The flavor was perfect. Thank you Christine!

Will Make Again.  Don't be afraid of the 2 TBS of chili powder unless you don't like the flavour.  This was NOT hot spicy.  Since I used Chili powder, I did not add the TBS of salt, the "seasoned salt" I used was McCormick "salt free parsley patch" which I highly recommend on your spice rack.  I thought mine came out a little dry but flavourful with the juices.  Thank you CristineD ... good job!

The chili powder seemed to overpower everything else.  I think next time I would do 1 tablespoon of chili powder and maybe add some b. sugar instead.

Wow, this was REALLY good! I could not find a brisket that was 4 pounds. After 3 different grocery stores, I ended up with a  2 1/2 pound brisket. That was the biggest I could find. The only change I made was I only used 1 tbs chili powder versus the 2 called for in the recipe. We don't like too much heat so the 1 worked out well for us.  This one was SO good that I was hoping for left overs. That didn't happen. It was gobbled up within 10 minutes. Everyone wanted seconds and thirds.

This was THE BOMB! I skipped the salt (but used the seasoned salt) and subbed smoked paprika for half the chili powder. So tender and delicious! I will definitely be making this again!

This recipe is truly the best!  I am not into the saucy ketchupy sauces that overpower the meat.  I did this recipe according to can_it_rachael's review.  I grilled it the last hour turning it every 20 mins, over indirect heat.  Very juicy crust on the outside and juicy, tender meat on the inside!

What an easy recipe!  Really delicious.  I was concerned with previous reviewers' comments about it being too salty or spicy so I cut the seasonings in half.  Still it cooked down very nicely.  I think if I added the other half of the seasonings it would have still been good.  This one is a keeper.  The hubby loved it.  Lots of options-made sandwiches &  Southwest burritos/tacos.

I used truvia(sp?)instead of sugar, but this turned out amazing. So tender could cut with a fork and flavor was so amazing. My brisket was 4.75lb so I added 30 minutes of cook time.

Turned out very tender.   Did not have any beef broth but I did have a lot of boxes of hamburger helper potato stroganoff,  so I used the dry sauce packet and mixed it with a cup and a half of water, heated it up a little bit and poured it as a substitution for the beef broth .   It turned out amazing... a and nice thick yet pourable gravy that was excellent on the brisket and on mashed potatoes .    Only other substitution I used for the dry rub... I did not have onion powder so I used steak seasoning instead of season salt and it was excellent

I have been using this site for at least 4 years now and have never written a review. This recipe has been requested from me on so many occasions. The gravy that I make from the drippings is phenomenal. Tweek to your liking if you'd like, but the recipe by itself is fantastic! Thank you for the recipe!

I love this recipe.  I admit I leave out the salt because it makes it too salty in my opinion, but everyone that has tried this loves it.  I use this rub on ribs too and they turn out excellent!!!!

Amazing! Perfect recipe! I just made this today and within an hour of eating had to write a review! I could not get a brisket at my store that wasnt already corned, so i thought a bottom round roast could be a good substitute and it was the BEST roasted meat i have ever made. The rub gives the exterior an excellent spicy, sweet and smoky flavor. I do not care for seasoning salt so instead i added 2t dry mustard. Cant wait to try it with an actual brisket!!!

I have been using allrecipes.com for almost ten years and after cooking this brisket, I finally created an account so that I can rate THIS recipe. I cooked this for my mother's birthday last night. I had an eight-pound brisket, so I increased the time cooked uncovered to 1.5 hours but kept all else the same. And I left the table salt out. I fed six of us on an eight-pound brisket and there were hardly any leftovers (and my mother asked for them!). My brother, my dad and my husband couldn't stop picking while I was cutting the brisket (and they all really know how to cook). GREAT JOB on this recipe!!

I'm sorry but this was way too salty for me. The spiciness was ok but it was borderline inedible with salt. If I ever make it again, I will def cut that back.

YUM! This was fantastic! I forgot to buy beef broth, so I used mushroom soup base, and I cooked this in the slow cooker for 10 hours on low. The amount of liquid in the recipe wasn't enough to cover the brisket in the cooker, so I added 12oz of beer. SO delicious! It's got lots of flavor and just falls apart. I used the juices to make a thin gravy for mashed potatoes and the meat, and served with shredded sauteed brussel sprouts. Great recipe, definitely a keeper!

I followed this recipe to make brisket sandwiches on pretzel bread rolls with lettuce, tomato & mayo -- yum!  Inspired by a sandwich my husband devoured on our trip to Hawaii.  I feel a little guilty about how easy it was to cook the brisket.  To think that all these years I was avoiding it!   I could not find a 4-lb brisket in the store, so I bought 12 lbs. and cut it up and froze some.  That was the only thing that took any effort at all!

awesome!!! I just made it today for dinner and served with mashed potatoes and sauteed carrots. I didnt have onion powder so I used dried onion flakes. I wouldnt do that again. After the first hour some of the flakes burned on the bottom of the pan and needed to be removed. Either I would wait to add the onion flakes until the broth went in or better yet I will pick up onion powder! My family loved it!

I cooked it in a crockpot, eight hours on low.  When it was almost done I took out some of the broth and added flour and cornstarch heating in a saucepan to make a gravy.  It was a hit.  So glad to find a recipe without BBQ sauce or ketchup.

I was in the country at a friends house with all the ingredients EXCEPT chili powder. After rooting through her spice cabinet, I found a bottle of McCormick Jamaican Jerk and just used that in lieu of all the spices in the original. It was the biggest hit of the weekend. I have never cooked a brisket in a stove, but will definitely continue with this cooking method!

I made this yesterday and it was amazing! I didn't have chili powder in my kitchen so I subbed a tablespoon of cayenne pepper instead and gave the brisket the perfect kick! SO tender & juicy...I'll be making this many more times over the winter too!

This is a great recipe. I made it according to the instructions with no changes. It was juicy and fork tender. Had great taste and tasted even better the next day.

I think in the future (and I will be making this often) I'll put the rub on the night before to let it marinade and then take the foil off the last 30 min of cooking. 

Thanks for a great recipe!

Made this for a football party, it was super easy and everyone loved it!  I didn't have seasoned salt, so I added a bit of paprika, thyme and oregano.   Turned out great!

I have made this multiple times. My family loves it but my daughter sometimes complains it's too spicy. So this last time I made a few changes.  I had a 7.8 lbs brisket, so I doubled the chili power, onion powder, garlic powder, white sugar and season salt (Lawry's). I left out the salt and only used 1 tsp of black pepper plus added 2 tsp of brown sugar. And doubled the beef broth. It came out even better than the original recipe and it was less spicy.

I love this brisket.  I have made this several times over the summer and it's alwasy a huge hit.  My only addition is to use the juice from the brisket and add ketchup, brown suger, and tabasco to create a wonderful sauce for the meat.

The brisket was excellent. Very tender and moist, however it was too salty.  If you use this recipe, be sure to cut the salt at least in half.

Very good rub! I changed it up a bit by starting it in the oven at 400 degrees for 30 minutes, then wrapped it tightly in foil and baked at 300 degrees for about 2 hours. Oh, drizzle some olive oil on it before you seal it up. It was succulent.

This was my first attempt at making a brisket. I did not find it too salty. I thought the seasoning for me and my family was spot on. I made one change. I added a small can a tomato sauce to the beef broth. I thought it would play of the chili powder nicely. I was correct. This was an around the table approval.

Wish I had read the reviews.  Way too much salt.  If I make it again, I will leave out the 1 tbs of regular salt.

Delicious and easy!  Anything I can throw in the oven and forget about for the day gets high marks from me!  The seasoning on this was very good and made the gravy I made a little spicy and different!  Served with mashed potatoes and salad.  Nice meal for company!

I was hesitant to try to roast a brisket, for fear it would come out tough (and it's NOT an expensive cut, so didn't want to waste the $$).  I read some of the previous reviews and they were nearly all 5 stars, so gave it a try.  IT CAME OUT GREAT!  The most tender and flavorful brisket I've ever had.  I served it for Easter dinner, and all my family loved it.  They kept asking for seconds (and thirds as long as it lasted!)  Thanks for a foolproof recipe - I will be making this again and again!

This was a great recipe. The only change I made was to cut the salt to 2tsp and used a salt free seasoning blend instead of season salt.

This  was truly an excellent recipe. Didn't change a thing. It came out very tender. Just be careful about how much rub you put on the brisket.

With just the 2 of us I bought a 2 pound brisket, cut the spices in 1/2 except a little less for the chili powder.  It came out just delicious.  My wife raved about it and insisted I add the recipe to the family book.  Well done.

Reduced both salts by 1 tsp. each.  Had to rinse spices from meat after done and filter juices. Too spicy. Returned meat and filtered juice to covered roaster and put on low for 20 minutes. EXCELLENT tenderness and flavor. Usually Traeger brisket but we raise our own beef so have several whole ones a year. Love this oven method. Trimmed ALL connective tissue and almost all fat cap from briskets. Made about 14 lbs. Tweak it for yourself. Added 2 TB. Worcestershire to beef broth when adding to pan.

I'm not sure if I didn't have the right type of beef (however it says brisket) but this did not work for me. The meat is still pink after cooking it for 5 hours. Also, the recipe is entirely tooooooo salty. I read the reviews prior to preparing this dish and scaled back on the salt because some mentioned that it is salty. The meat was still extremely salty. I don't think I will try this one again. However, the photos of what it is supposed to look like makes it very tempting.

I have never made a brisket before tonight...I can not believe how easy it was and tasted great.  I used a larger brisket (about 5.5 lbs) and had planty of rub for the brisket.  Everyone loved it!

The brisket turned out wonderful.  I didn't have any beef broth so I used half a can of French onion soup and filled the rest with water to equal the beef broth amount.  Very flavorful and made excellent sandwiches the next day with BBQ sauce.
Thanks for a fool proof recipe.

This turned out to be really great.  Came pretty close to what I get when I visit Texas.  I cut the chili powder in half and did not use any seasoned salt (did not have any).  Will definitely make again.

I made this following the recipe, but with a 6lb roast (so I cooked it a little longer). It looked so beautiful, and the aroma while it was cooking was wonderful! I never would have thought of putting chili powder on a roast (okay, I'm not a culinary genius) but it worked great.  Tasty, juicy, incredibly tender... my only other comment is that I would put less salt on it next time, or only use the seasoning salt, because I like to keep my salt intake lower (and I think it would still taste luscious).  I even took a picture!! Great recipe!

Wow, first time making beef that wasn't hamburgers and it was amazing! I also added mustard powder, bay leaf, and paprika. It came out perfectly. Doesn't need sauce but I mixed a 1:1 ratio of the juices with barbeque sauce and put it on it after I cut it and stuck it in for another 10 min. and it was awesome!

Hhmm, the flavor was good, but my brisket turned out somewhat dry.  However, the meat was somewhat redeemed when I mixed the sauce from the pan and the leftover brisket, heated it up and served on fresh rolls.

fantastic. the spices give the beef a great taste.I have used this recipe twice. I kept on checking the beef every 1/2 hour to make sure that it had plenty of broth in the pan.

Read the reviews and had to try it.  Everyone LOVED it!!!  Be sure to follow recipe.  I've made it three times in the last month.

OMGoodness.  I used half the amount of chili powder and added beer to the broth.  This brisket was wonderful!!!  I had never cooked a brisket before...but my boys ate almost the whole thing in one sitting!  Definite hit.  Will make many more times.  EDIT:  Made again, did not add beer to the broth, and halved the chili powder.  I lowered the temp to 275 and left in for 4 hours because I had to attend my son's ballgame (after adding broth).  Splendidly perfect!

This is so good and easy to make.  My only regret is that I didn't buy a bigger brisket.  The spice rub is dead on.  I did not find it to salty or to spicy.  I'm just wondering how this would taste in my smoker.  I guess I'll need to purchase another brisket and find out.  This is easy to do and has tons of flavor.  Thanks for recommending it to me, Christine- Happy Holidays!

I was in love with this recipe one hour into cooking it, the smell in my house was any meat lovers dream.  This tasted great, and was versatile to be used in many dishes.  We had as is with sides the first night, simmered in BBQ sauce the next night for sandwiches, and even made quesadillas for lunch.  Very easy too make, and delicious.

Instead of the full tablespoon of salt I used half of that, and then used 2 cups of broth instead and my family loved this. I didn't even wipe the spices off the surface or anything before serving. I commented to my dad about how some people didn't like that, and he looked at me like he'd skin me alive if I even thought of doing that! So apparently he really liked the flavors on the top.. my family was fighting to get those 'good pieces'. Needless to say, this brisket didn't last long at the table, lol.

I had trouble finding a brisket, but I finally found one and I'm glad because this is tasty.  Next time I will omit the salt and just use the seasoned salt, as it was a bit too salty for us.

This was really good. My husband loved it. I was running around all day so I ended up cooking the brisket in the slow cooker (4 hours on low I think). We made sandwiches with the brisket. After tasting the brisket as is, I did continue with my usual routine and slathered Jack Daniel's Sauce on my sandwich. I know its a sin but I wasn't raised to eat beef. My finished product was YUMMY!

Our brisket didn't turn out as tender as others. I thought the recipe was just okay. I felt like it was a bit spicy too.

Tried this for the first time this evening. Definitely too much chili powder. I'd cut that in at least 1/2 next time. Other than that it was OK, nothing great. Made a gravy with pan drippings which was good drizzled over the meat. Had garlic rolls, mashed potatoes, and green beans along with it.

This was my first time making brisket.  The meat got very tender and was juicy.  I did think the chili powder was a little too dominant, but other than that it was great.  I made a sauce out of the drippings by adding flour, cooking that, adding water and a splash of white wine vinegar (thinking it would make it a little like bbq sauce).  The sauce was great too.  Thanks ChristineD!
