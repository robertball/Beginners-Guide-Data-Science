Very tasty. I chopped up a whole medium sweet onion. I placed this in a 13 x 9 and found that there wasn't quite enough biscuit mixture to cover the entire pan. This was very good and I can see where you could add spices and such to this to suit your own tastes. This is a typical hobo type dinner; suitable for family, not for company. Thank you.

After reading other reviews, I added a liberal amount of garlic salt and seasoning salt to the hamburger mixture.  After pouring into a baking dish I grate about a cup of Cheddar cheese on top before adding the baking mix topping. I doubled the amount of baking mix topping, which worked out well. I only put 3/4 cup of the bbq sauce and next time will eliminate it altogether as it doesn't need it at all.

My friends and I cooked this for a group of teenagers and it got mixed reviews.  I thought it had good flavor and liked it, but others weren't crazy about it.

I really liked this, as did the rest of my family!  This dish has a lot of meat in it, I can't imagine it as a side dish, it fits much better as a main dish.  After reading the reviews, this is what I changed:  I added a good amount of garlic salt and seasoned salt to the ground beef and then some brown sugar (2 T?) to the mixture before putting it in the dish.  I topped the mixture with shredded cheese before topping with the biscuit mix (only the amount which was called for in the recipe, it was about 3/4 inch thick when done- perfect for me!  I did add 1 T honey).  When done baking, I topped with the extra bbq sauce and cheese.

As unusual as mixing these ingredients sound, I've found that everyone that has tried it has wanted the recipe. It's easy enough for anyone to make, I definately recommend doubling the topping though.

I had some trouble with this one. First off for me it was a major bean over load, the next time I make this I will have to alter the amounts somehow. The breading on the top did not bake all the way through the middle and was quite runny, I had to leave it in an extra 12 minutes. It was certainly not the most attractive looking dish I have ever made, but despite my difficult time prepping it tasted amazing!

After making this a second time, it is definitely one of my favorites! Turned out perfect!

I really like the recipe simple and pretty easy to make. I'm going to try it again with honey baked beans and a honey bbq sauce to see if that makes a difference in the taste. It was a little much on the bbq sauce but I really felt like something was missing and I'm not really sure what I'm hoping the pairing of the beans and sauce will make a difference.

What a nice, simple and quick supper!  I had only one can of baked beans, so I added a can of vegetarian chili with beans - tasted very good.  Next time, I'll try it with a cornbread topping.

I love this dish.  I changed the beef to ground turkey, used a whole onion and used Jiffy cornbread as the topping instead of biscuit baking mix.  I also seasoned the turkey with Adobe seasoing, instead of garlic salt like previous reviews suggested.  I have made this dish twice so far. My suggestion would be like others to add 1 to 2 MORE cans of baked beans than what the recipe originally calls for and to use one box of cornbread mix if you are going to try that route.  I tried two, but it made the topping really thick.  The second time, I only used one box, but added 1 cup of milk (instead of 1/2 cup) and the balance was MUCH better.

This was really good and had lots of flavor!  I made it just as written except that I omitted the 1/4 cup cheddar cheese and the 1 tbs BBQ sauce.

I read the reviews and made the following changes - added some garlic powder and seasoned salt to the meat/bean mixture, only used 1/2 cup of barbecue sauce, doubled the crust, and skipped the extra sauce and cheese on top. It was perfect!

I thought this recipe was lacking something, like more veggies. Next time I think I'll put in a layer of broccoli or peas and carrots. It would be more shepherd's pie like which is fine with me. My husband really likes it, of course he's not as veggie crazy as myself.

Very good weeknight dinner.  Affordable too. I used ground chicken, fat free beans, and skim milk (cut calories where ever I could) and it turned out great - very flavorful.  Good addition to the weekly rotation.

I followed the recipe exactly and found it tasted like baked bean cake. The baked topping w/ meat & bean filling did not work for me.

This is so tasty, very easy to make, and cheap! I've always liked baked beans and cheddar cheese together, so this was instantly appealing to me. I did make some changes...I used 1 lb of lean ground beef, 2 (22 oz) cans of Bush Bourbon and Brown Sugar Grillin Beans, added a pinch of cayenne pepper, and used Sweet Baby Ray brown sugar bbq sauce. I only had 1/2 cup of bbq sauce, but it still tasted great. I really liked the ratio of beef to beans that I used...1 1/2 lbs of meat and smaller cans of beans just didn't seem too balanced. And I liked the crust, but I think I'll definitely try the cornbread crust next time. Thanks for the keeper! This is a good base recipe.

This is excellent!  I only used 1 can of beans.  I also used sweet Italian sausages instead of ground beef.  I was thinking it might be too weird, but it turned out fantastic!  Definitely easy and filling!

Adding a little garlic salt, seasoned salt, and brown sugar made this a scrumptious and easy dinner dish for when my mom had to work late! It needs a little more biscuit batter to cover shallower casserole dishes, though.

This was really good after I made a few changes.  I used 1/3 cup of onions instead of 1/4.  Also this recipe was missing something so I added 1/3 cup diced green bell pepper and it added the perfect flavor and color! Also, I used a box of Jiffy cornbread mix and prepared according to the Jiffy box and then poured over. Also, I used KC Masterpiece Original BBQ sauce and it came out perfect!  One more tip, if you use a 9x13 casserole, make sure to add a little extra milk or water to the jiffy cornbread mix so it will be thinner and cover the entire casserole.  If not, you will have to use two boxes and that will be too much cornbread!

This was easy to put together and very tasty especially for a winter meal when you want a taste of BBQ, but can't grill out!  I made it just the way the recipe is written with great results, this time, I'm going to try it topped with cornbread mix instead of the baking mix for added flavor and I'm also going to try adding some bacon that I have on hand.

The first thing my husband said (when he came up for air) was, "Is there more?"  This was so easy to prepare and so tasty.  I didn't change or add anything to the recipe.  I used honey barbecue sauce which gave it just a little sweetness.  I will be making this again.  Someone had suggested making a cornbread topping and I'm going to try that.

This was really good and easy ingredients! I added some taco seasoning, garlic, basil and oregano to give more flavour. I didn't have biscuit mix so i used the Biscuit Baking Mix from this site (scaled down.) I will definitely make again. Not fancy but good.

This is pretty good for a quick easy meal, with things you would probably have on hand.  Don't make any special trips to get the ingredients.  It is a little bland.  It needs something, I'm just not sure what.

I added a can of black  beans (mashed), and only used one pound of ground beef. I loved it and my family did too.

Very good! I put it in a 9x13, and the crust did cover it. However, the crust  was thin enough that it was done in 30 minutes, so cooking time will depend on the size of your dish. I would like to try it with green pepper and maybe corn inside. Thanks for a great recipe!

Made this using 1 lb. hamburger, 28 oz. beans, 1 cup BBQ sauce, cheese on top of meat mixture, and 1 box corn bread mix (mixed with 1 cup milk). Next time I will add an additional 1/2 cup BBQ sauce to the meat mixture. Thanks for the recipe!

The barbecue is subtle - even with using spicy barbecue.  'Not that subtle is a bad thing, but I thought it'd be ... well, barbecuey!  It's pretty good, but not so barbecuey.  I halved the recipe with ground turkey so added the full t of worcestershire, extra onion & barbecue.  I made the full amount of topping & it pressed the limit for a pie plate.

This is a great starting point but we agree that it needs a little something. We thing if you simmered the beans and bbq sauce it would enhance the flavor of the beans more.

Very easy and economical. Because I have a 14 year old boy in the house, this recipe only fed 4, but I'm sure I will make it again. I didn't put extra barbecue sauce on top, just cheese.

It was good. Something for a cold day. I used a light sauce which made it super sweet (don't recommend it). Easy simple and best of all I had all the ingredients in my house, didn't have to go do a special shopping trip.

Yum! (Even my picky husband ate it AND got second helpings!)   I'm always looking for ways to make things easier... therefore, I used a ready-made refrigerated pie dough and "rolled it out" (spread it) on top of the meat/bean/etc mixture. I baked the entire thing at a 400 degrees for about 20-30 minutes. (During the last 10-15 mins of baking, I covered the edges of the pie crust with strips of foil to keep them from burning.) It was delicious and flaky and a perfect blend of flavors!!!  Also, I used ground turkey (with lots of seasoning) and added a can of kidney beans to the mixture. Great flavors!!

We just loved this and the leftovers make great cold-day lunches. I did make a few changes following other's suggestions. Added garlic salt, seasoned salt and a tablespoon of honey to the meat. Topped the meat with about a cup of cheddar cheese and then used corn bread topping following the recipe on the package. It flowed evenly over the top and came out golden browen. Then topped with some shredded cheese. This will definately be one of our favorite winter weeknight dishes.

This was surprisingly good. I had my doubts, but I needed to use my ground beef. Both my husband and I liked how this tasted. It gets points because it was so EASY. It went together in 15 minutes and the time in the oven allowed me to get my sides together.

I wanted to try this because I was interested in the baking mix topping. The meat filling was pretty run-of-the-mill (I added some garlic powder, more Worcestershire sauce, black pepper) but we really liked the topping. I will probably use this instead of pastry to top savory pies etc in the future. Thanks for a neat idea!

I changed it a little  but it was really yummy.  I used biscuits instead of mix.  I didn't have any Worcestershire sauce.  Also I did not put more BBQ sauce on the top, just shredded cheese.

I loved this!  Of course, I love anything with BBQ sauce.  I did make some pretty significant changes, one of them being I made this in the slow cooker vs. the oven.  Super easy, I dumped the meat mixture (with more spices than called for in the recipe) into the slow cooker, and topped it with canned biscuits since I didn't have any biscuit mix.  Next time I'm going to top the biscuits with honey, as another reviewer suggested.  Sounds great!

This was absoultely yummy!  Great for family BBQ's or pot lucks!  The only thing I would change is adding 2(28 oz) cans of baked beans instead of the 15 oz. cans.  And I also added 1 med sized green pepper when I added the onion.  Just be sure to use the baked beans with the "juice" not the creamy brown kind.  Thanks so much for the great recipe!

This was very good. I added garlic powder and a chopped onion to the ground beef, and added some cheese below topping as well. Like other reviewers, I doubled topping for 9x13 pan. Next time I will try this with cornbread topping.

This was alright as written, which is the way I made it. Something just didn't click, though. Here are my suggestions. Instead of baking mix, use cornbread. I think it would complement the good stuff underneath better. With that, you can decide if you wanted to add cheese on top, but I wouldn't do sauce. The cornbread will be great without it. I think I would actually rather mix some cheese into the bean and meat mixture. Just my own thoughts.

Family friendly and hearty.  I had already browned ground beef, so I added about 1/2 cup of french-fried onions.  I also topped the filling with prepared cornbread mix.  My family enjoyed it.  Next time I might try half ground beef and half pork sausage.

The general idea of this recipe is good, and as I love my bbq sauce for grilling meats I thought this would be great. Unfortunately the bbq sauce was way too over powering and I didn't even put it on top. I will however try this again with a bbq mixture.

i added garlic powder, seasoned salt and a southwest seasoning with only 1/2 cup bbq sauce. then i topped it with cornbread - make sure it's a relatively thin layer or (like mine) the bottom of the cornbread will still be uncooked. 
overall - a very good recipe. the whole family enjoyed it.

This recipe is great.  I like trying different things, and my husband loved it.  I used spicy ground sausage instead of ground beef.  Gave it a good 'kick'.  I used a little less on the BBQ sauce, and was glad....a cup seemed like a bit much.  Good winter time recipe

I found after baking it in the oven it tended to try out and I didn't care for the crust. I was sampling as it simmered on the stove and enjoyed it so will stop the recipe there and serve with warm rolls.

This was an easy recipe. My husband called it "camp" food! He's not fond of BBQ sauce but I am and this combination suited us both. I used a sweeter yet spicy BBQ sauce which was a really nice compliment.

This was really good.  Like other reviewers, I seasoned the meat with garlic powder, season salt, salt and pepper.  I also added a pinch of brown sugar to it.  My son is allergic to the topping, so I substituted low-fat cresant rolls instead.  I just rolled them out flat and placed them on top.  I still had to cook it about the same time frame.  My 10 year old son has declared this his new favorite recipe.  Everyone in my house scraped the bowl clean! Just a reminder though to let it rest when it comes out of the oven for about 10 minutes and it thickens up nicely. Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicous!  i used the Jack Daniels Original #7 BBQ sauce that has a fantastic flavor.  I put this in a long casserole dish but should have used a deeper one that way the crust would have covered it.  As it was, it did not!
 
This will be a recipe that I make from time to time.  With that in mind when I browned the ground beef I did an extra portion toward the next time so the prep time will be quicker. 

Next time I htink I will add a bit of kick with some spicier ingredients as people have mentioned in their reviews.  But as this recipe stands it is very tastey and very good!  A definite keeper!

Great recipe, but made a few changes. Used ground turkey instead of beef, used half the bbq sauce, doubled the Worcestershire, 1Tbsp splenda brown suger,added extra minced garlic and garlic salt (I love garlic!), a little cayenne pepper to spice things up and topped with a little cheese before putting the biscuit topping. I added 1Tbsp honey to the mix and doubled the topping to make sure it covered the entire 9x13 dish.

Really good! I rated it a 4 because I think you may want to tweak it to your  
own taste! I think a cornbread crust would be really great! And I had the opposite problem from most that I had too much crust! I added more to cover the top, and I didn't expect it to "puff" up so much! I think some corn or beans would be great in it. I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Hot and spicy and it gave it a great kick!

Easy to make; a hit with the kids (bonus points for that!!).  I added a bit of grated cheddar cheese before adding the bisquick mix. Just before taking out of the oven, I sprinkled top with more cheddar cheese.
Great recipe and ready in a short time.

I thought this recipe was very good but I think I will try something different for the top next time, like cornbread or crescent roll dough. With the recipe as-is, I would use a faster oven because the biscuit top was a little tough. Maybe 375 for a shorter time period, which would theoretically brown it before it gets overcooked. I also added some cheese to the meat mixture because it was too liquidy. I probably should have drained the beans.??  Anyway, very tasty and satisfies a barbecue craving.

This recipe was very good and extremely simple to make. Instead of Worcestershire sauce, I used Dale's sauce because I was out of the Worcestershire. I used red onion  and thought it complimented the meal well. It is very filling. Not too sweet. Not too spicy. Not too saucy. I also added more cheese on top than the recipe called for because we love cheese.

This only gets four stars because I knew it wouldn't be five without some changes. I always pre-cook ground beef and turkey with seasonings, so I didn't start this from that step. I just added dehydrated onion instead, and also to save time. I made the beans how I would typically make baked beans: BBQ sauce, onion, molasses, brown sugar, smoke sauce, worcestershire sauce - I just mixed it all in a 9 X 13 pan. Then when making the baking mix (separate bowl), I added about 1 Tablespoon of honey. I put shredded sharp Cheddar cheese on top of the mix about 5 minutes before it was nice and golden. I put pre-cooked pieces of sliced maple bacon on the top of the cheese. YUM! My husband's favorite food is baked beans, so he LOVED this!!! I was leary about ground meat in with the beans, but it was a wonderful combination. It'd also be good with pre-cooked chicken (canned or frozen). I actually liked the amount of mix there was for the topping. In a 9 X 13 pan, it made just a light, thin crust.

This was very good and very easy!  I didn't add the additional BBQ sauce on top and used more cheese than it called for.  My whole family loved it!

I liked the hamburger and bbq bean mix, but I didn't care to much for the topping.
