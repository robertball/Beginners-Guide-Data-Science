This is time consuming like all risotto but is well worth it. I wouldn't change a thing.

The chicken broth overwhelmed all other flavors. If I make it again I need to dilute the broth.

I was so impressed by this recipe! Next time I will dilute the chicken broth as it became too salty as it was absorbed but otherwise I was very pleased and will definitely make again.

This is a very good recipe. I had to adapt it due to guests food restrictions and it was still wonderful. I couldn't use onions so I used three cloves of garlic. I also tossed in a handful of spinach near the end. And served it with Parmesan on the table not mixed in. While I'm sure the changes I made may have reduced the depth of flavor it was still rich flavorful and enjoyed by all. Makes me think this may become the basis for numerous variations (asparagus or mushrooms or...).
