Absolutely delicious! This was my first eggplant recipe and it turned out great. Like the other reviews, I would recommend baking the eggplant for about 6 to 7 minutes per side instead of 5 to ensure the eggplant is not chewy. Also, I added chopped mushrooms and onion to the layers and it really added texture and taste. I also added chopped garlic..which I do to pretty much any recipe where it could work because I'm a garlic fanatic, if you like garlic, I'd recommend throwing some in there :) Will definitely use this recipe again!

A really tasty dish. My eggplant was a bit chewy, so could probably have used a few more minutes in the oven. Also, halved the original recipe. Definitely will use this recipe again as soon as we get another eggplant from my garden.

Great alternative to frying eggplant!  The only thing is I prefer panko bread crumbs over regular and I did add salt, pepper, and italian seasoning to bread crumbs before I dipped eggplant. I also used the garden fresh spaghetti sauce recipe from this sight! Made it very delicious!

The eggplant really needs to cook at 425 F, 350 is too low and it will be unpleasantly chewy. I made the recipe twice, and it was much better when the eggplant was cooked at a hotter temp. Otherwise, good recipe.

Excellent recipe.   For an  even healthier  version try using ground flax seed and water mixture  at  a ratio of 1 tbsp flax to 3 tbsp water  as a substitute for the eggs. Then prepare the eggplant early by slicing them,  sparingly sprinkle with sea salt, placing them on paper towels in single layers and watch the towels soak up the water.  Let them sit for about an hour before coating them in flax mixture and bread crumbs. .  Best  Eggplant Parmesan we've ever made at home!!!

Excellent way in which to cook an Eggplant Parmesan without the frying.

My additions:

* 1/2 cup sauteed onion, two garlic cloves and about 8 fresh mushrooms sliced. (I had halved the recipe) I placed this mixture in the middle of the eggplant slices.

* Used Panko breadcrumbs and season with garlic salt and Italian seasoning.

* Looks and smells great. Pleasant presentation and kudos for ease of preparedness.

Made this last night for dinner. I cut the recipe in half since I was just cooking for myself, but I followed everything else exactly. Turned out GREAT!

This was a winner. Made a few changes based on what i had available, Panko and Provolone instead of whole wheat and mozzerella. It was fantastic.

So good!! I will definitely make this again! My husband is not normally a big eggplant fan but loved this. I used the suggestion to slice and soak up moisture from the eggplant with paper towels and something heavy for about an hour. I coooked the eggplant at 350 for ten min. each side and used Italian bread crumbs. Consistency turned out great. For the marinara, I used a spaghetti sauce (by: courtneynoonan) recipe I found on this site which had great flavor. We added a bit of garlic salt to our serving.

LOVED this recipe, very little prep time & very easy start to finish and DELISHOUS to boot.  My husband had never had eggplant before and we were both in agreement - it's a keeper.  I used the original recipe on site and just saw this 'healthier' one... doesn't look to different except the egg mixture, this actually calls for MORE eggs (white or whole) I might let the eggplant cook longer in the oven and maybe 400* to have less chewy - but great !

The recipe turned out delicious.  However it was a lot of work prepping and the final 'presentation' with the baked eggplant looked dry. It wasn't dry, just looked as if it might be.  It was for my family so they didn't care.  Even my 5 year old ate it!  However if I made it for guests I would probably put extra sauce over the top layer of baked eggplant to cover it before I put on the cheese.

We were given a lot of eggplants and I was trying to find a recipe for Eggplant Parmesan that was not fried.  We tried this recipe and it was very good!!  Will definitely be making this again in the summer when we get loaded with eggplants from our garden! :)

I have always loved Egg Plant Parmesan but this recipe is replaces my old recipe.  So much easier to bake the egg plant prior vs. oil/fry.  Nice and firm. Agree to make sure eggplant is well cooked in oven prior. I didn't get in a hurry to pull it out of the oven either.

I have made this several times. The quality of the pasta sauce can make a difference in the results.  It was always delicious but really incredible with my mom's arrabiata sauce - made from her garden's tomatoes! I am making this for Christmas eve.

this was delicious! I used panko, seasoned with basil, oregano, and garlic. I put fresh basil leaves on each layer. I baked the eggplant slices for 8 minutes a side then baked the assembled dish at 400 for 30 minutes.

I put kosher salt and paper towel on the eggplant slices first and let them sit 30 mins: otherwise they retain their bitter juices and the dish is a bit bitter for me.
Also, I think we should note that "healthier" does not mean "healthy": it's still swimming in pasta sauce, cheese and breading, people :P That being said, it was delicious ^_^

it was great, but I would have put aluminum foil on top, for first 20 minutes, and last 20 minutes off?  the top cheese was a bit burnt and chewy. Still, really good.

This was my first time making eggplant parm. It turned out absolutely delicious! My family and co-workers loved it! 10 minutes of pre-baking on each side worked perfectly for me. I added some garlic, onions and mushrooms. Yum!

This is a great base recipe. The baking of the eggplant is an excellent way to reduce fat and greasiness. I modified the recipe to bring down the sodium content: substituted tomato sauce with garlic powder and Italian seasoning for the spaghetti sauce and eliminated any added salt. I did use 6 eggs for the wash and I needed about 3 cups of breadcrumbs to bread the eggplant (perhaps mine were larger than usual). My only critique of this recipe (and many others are like this) is the prep time. I’m pretty skilled in the kitchen and it took me about 2 hours to prep, not 25 minutes. Now I did leech the eggplant to remove the bitterness and improve tenderness, which added about 40 minutes. I also had to bake the eggplant in batches, which added another 30-40 minutes. So, unless you have three ovens, a team of six helping you, and magic eggplant that come pre-leeched, preparation will take longer. Aside from this, the recipe came out awesome, and will make again.

Very simple to make and full of flavor. I didn’t have much mozzarella so I increased the Parmesan which really bumped the flavor up. 
I will make this recipe again.

This was fantastic! Easy to make and as good as the high fat model! I make my own spaghetti sauce from roasted tomatoes and my own Italian 
spices, so I had this already on hand.  This came out fantastic. It is good to have a few vegetarian meals per week and this is a great  choice to have!

Everyone who has tried this eggplant loved it!  I am very happy with the results.  It was delicious and baked not fried.

This was so easy and delicious.  From another recipe, I salted the eggplant before breading and let it sit while getting my other ingredients ready.   Egg Mixture ~ I added minced garlic, grated parmigiana cheese, & parsley.   After baking on both sides, added more parmigiana cheese, scooped spaghetti sauce on top, topped it with chopped tomatoes & mozzarella cheese.  Baked for another 10/15 minutes because I was crunched for time. My husband loved it!

Great as is, was easy and fast for a wonderful meal. I served it with salad and a spinach/garlic linguine. Also, I added mushrooms and garlic to the eggplant before the sauce and cheese. I may also try it with crumbled ground turkey. Very good recipe!

Excellent!  I was worried that the eggplant wouldn't taste the same being baked, it was great.  I did use plain breadcrumbs because it's what I had and didn't want to go to the store. I also used fresh Basil because I had it. Very tasty!

Awesome! I also added the mushrooms, onion and garlic. Additionally the Panko bread crumbs work really well. I will definitely make this again

This makes a huge amount of food!  I cut the recipe to three serving, but easily have five here!  I don't mind, though, since this combines some of my favorite things.    Very good...but I am glad I cooked it at 425°.  Made the eggplant tender but not squishy.
