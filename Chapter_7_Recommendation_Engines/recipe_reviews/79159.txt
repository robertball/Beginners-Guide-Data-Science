I love these and I love cardamom!  I used half a cup of raisins and half a cup of dried cranberries.  All I had in the house were walnuts so I used those instead of cashews.  This is an amazing recipe.  It's one I'm sure I'll be using for years to come!

These are definitely a keeper - if you like Indian rice pudding, then you will like these. Instead of cashews, I used almonds (like one of the other reviewers) and they turned out excellent. And this is a tip that applies to all rice krispy treats - make sure that you sort of coax the krispies into the baking dish - don't press too hard, or they'll be dense and heavy instead of light and airy.

A crispy rice treat for grown-ups! The spice is very subtle and tasty. I substituted almonds for the cashews and they worked just as well. I also sprinkled just a bit of salt over the top as the bars were setting for a sweet/salt taste. Will definitely make again.

Cardamom is one of my favourite spices for baking so had to give this recipe a try.  I was NOT disappointed!  If you enjoy chai tea or Indian rice pudding you will enjoy this treat.  I personally prefer using dried cranberries but many friends have said they prefer the golden raisins.  Either way this one is a keeper.  Next time I will try with dried blueberries or maybe even dried cherries.  The choices are endless.

I was very hesitant to make this recipes as I would never think to combine these ingredients together, but to my surprise all my guests had seconds and thirds!  Personally though, I still prefer the traditional rice krispies.

Mmmmmm! If you like Indian rice pudding, you'll love this!  I really liked it!  I varied it by crushing the cashews into pretty smalll crumbles and added slightly more cardamom.  Give this recipe a try!

Definitely different, would have been fine with just cashews. Would make a variation of this again.

An awesome (adult) twist on regular old Rice Crispy Treats.  The whole house smells SO GOOD while the Cardimom, marshmallows and butter are melting.  They tast pretty darn good, too!!

this is a really good recipe, i didn't think at first that i would like it, but i really enjoyed making it. The raisins were a great add, and the Cardamom gives a great subtle taste to the treat, i would have never thought to combine any of these ingredients together, but all in all was a great recipe

Yup, yet another winner from allrecipes! I don't like raisins much, but they totally worked in this recipe. I wanted to cut back on the marshmallows and use some brown sugar instead, but I wasn't sure how it would set up. Regardless, this is delicious as written. Thank you!

First time making these and they were devoured at a holiday party. Next time, I'll probably add a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg to compliment the cardamom, but it isn't really necessary. They were delicious with the regular recipe instructions.

I used walnuts instead of cashews and a mix of currants and chopped dried figs instead of the golden raisins. Very good. Much better than the original crispy treats in my opinion.

Cardamom too powerful. I love spicy Indian food but am not that much of a dessert eater. - I would reduce cardamom by 25% if I ever made again, but find myself preferring old standard krispie treats instead.

Fun flavor, you can play with this recipe. Crushed my cashews,  used large marshmallows, torn in half and added a bit extra cardamon. Also added a little poppy seed & dried cranberry per another review. Family liked it. Note, melt the butter, then quickly add marshmallows, stir till all melted then add to cereal mix.

I love the taste of Chai, so I did add cinnamon,and allspice. These disappear as fast as I can make them. We think of them as a "healthy snack", haha. I will often add dried cranberries, dates, and any type of nut i have on hand.  Delicious!

I love the cardamom in this recipe!   I didn't have the cashews or the golden raisins so I substituted almonds and craisins.  It was outstanding!  I imagine it would be wonderful with any nut and any dry fruit.   It is more substantial and complex than your normal rice crispy bar -- the grown up rice crispy.

These are great!  I love the cardamom.  I grind my own fresh so used a little less than 1tsp.  Definitely worth the effort to grind your own.  What a tasty way to spice up an easy treat.

These were good.  I cut the recipe in half and I used salted cashews and a blend of dried fruit.  I didn't think the salt made much difference.  I've made rice cereal treats many times.  After the marshmallow and butter have completely melted, I turn the stove as low as it will go (we have gas)and mix in the dry ingredients.  The marshmallow doesn't set up as quickly so mixing is easier and less is stuck to the pan.  I use a pan with a wide bottom.  Will make again soon.

I made the recipe without any substitutes. It was considered a big hit with my family. I am not a fan of raisins, however I didn't notice the raisins. They added to the overall flavour of the rice crispies.

Oh my!! These are wonderful! I made a few modifications to the recipe. I used Earth Balance in place of butter and vegan marshmallows instead of regular ones. I also used 3 tsp of fresh ground cardamom, used a combination of raw cashews and almonds, and added a handful of minced crystalized ginger. Will definitely be making in the future.

Incredibly delicious!  A huge hit.  I added 1tbsp Rose Water to the marshmallow-butter mix as well as 2 tbsp powdered coconut milk (don't use liquid as that will pop the cereal), some dried cranberries, and substituted strawberry marshmallows for the regular kind and chopped pistachios for the cashews.  Yeah, they all got eaten!
