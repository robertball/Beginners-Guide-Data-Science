When I decided to make this, all I had was a box of chocolate cake mix.  I adjusted the servings until it pretty well matched the size of my cake mix package.  This adjusted the amount of egg and oil portion of the recipe.  I used M&M's because I had those on hand and they were less expensive than chocolate chips.  Baked for 10 minutes and they all came out great.  I'm sure I will make these cookies again.  I may try and use a carrot or pumpkin spiced cake mix just to see how the different mixes work out.
