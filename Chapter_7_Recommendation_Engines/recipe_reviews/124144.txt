Quick and filling but quite sweet. I could not finish mine but the kids did theirs, slowly. It says something when my kids say that something's too sweet. I'd make this again but I'd cut back on the sugar by half. Next time, I'd add raisins and maybe a little cinnamon/nutmeg.

This is the first time I have given a negative review but this recipe is bad!  I used less sugar and cooked it a little longer so it wasn't so soupy but it was sickly sweet.  We couldn't finish it.  Don't waste your time or ingredients--there's too many good ones out there.

My family loves this.  To make it quicker, I leave the egg out but put everything else in a glass bowl, give it a quick stir, then cook it in the microwave for 2 minutes, stir, then 1 1/2 to 2 minutes more.  I put the butter in, add about 1/2 t. vanilla and cover with wax paper for about 5 minutes, stir and serve.  It's much faster and just as good.

We loved this! So hearty, sweet and homey!  So much better than the packaged maple-flavored oatmeal, with a more distinct maple flavor and real oatmeal texture.  Next time I will probably add a bit more milk while cooking as it was a tad too thick, but this recipe is a keeper! Thank you!

I just made it for my family and they loved it!  I did reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup as suggested in other reviews I also used to 2 egg whites instead of 1 egg and 1/2 a tbsp butter.  Then I put a 1 tsp of ground flaxseed in to boost nutritional value.

Super sweet, even for this 'sweet tooth'. I would suggest starting with half the sugar. Also, boiling as directed will curdle the egg. The mixture only needs to be heated (on medium low heat) until thickened, then add the oats.

Add 1/2 tsp. of salt to reduce the sweetness and you could omit the egg and substitute a thickener like 2 tsp of corn starch by dissolving it in the liquid ingredients. probably 1/3rd a cup of brown sugar is enough. Also, just some caramel candies 2-3 per serving of oatmeal would be pretty tasty.

This was really good. I read the other reviews and recduced the brown sugar amount to 1/3 cup, and it was still sweet enough to eat alone.

Wow! Based on other reviews, I cut the brown sugar in half and added a bit of cinnamon & nutmeg. Even my daughter who hates oatmeal like it! This will be a regular breakfast item in our house.

Very good! The first time I made this I didnâ€™t have any brown sugar, I used white sugar with a glob of molasses. I like to add Penzeys Extra Fancy Cassia Cinnamon, and a little vanilla; it tastes like your eating a Cinnabon!

This was deliciously sweet and very filling. It was creamy and will definitely fill you up for the day ahead. It seemed very thin but after standing for 5 minutes and then serving into the bowls, it thickened quite a bit more. I used 2% milk. unsalted butter, and added a pinch of salt when I added the oats. Thanks Janet for a wonderful start to our day!

Took some other members' suggestions & used 1/4 cup of brown sugar. It was really good. Sweet but not too sweet. It seemed to take longer than the recipe mentions or maybe it was just me. I'm not a big oatmeal person & I will make this again. I recommend this to others.

Well, I liked this recipe, contrary to some other reviewers.  I must have a sweet tooth because I didn't find it "sickly sweet" at all.  It was tasty and the consistency was good.  I did add a little vanilla before letting it sit for a few minutes and I skipped the butter.  My kids couldn't get enough!

This is pretty good.  I never thought to put an egg in the oatmeal.  A nice added boost of protein!  I use about 1/4 cup brown sugar and then sweeten with raisins or cut up peaches.  Very creamy and filling!

I cut the brown sugar to 1/4 cup and used 1/4 cup of egg beaters instead of the egg to make this recipe more weight watchers friendly! I also garnished with a tsp of mini chocolate chips

Fantastic Recipe!! After reading the reviews I did a 2 serving version and only used a cup of milk and 1/3 cup brown (un-packed) sugar, and 1 whole egg. I threw some fresh bananas and 1/2 cup of blueberries on ta-da..yummy! Can't wait to try it on my teenage son!

So good and so sweet! I have a major sweet tooth, so I love this. I have started leaving out the butter, as I don't personally think there is a difference. I use skim milk and add a little cinnamon or nutmeg sometimes. It's a great breakfast or lunch option for me. Thanks for sharing!

I've made this one with or without the egg and there isn't much difference in the taste.  So, when I feel like a bit more protein I'll add it in, if not this is still a hearty, delicious meal! I love oatmeal!

Personally, I would give this a five. I loved it! My kids said it was either a four or 4.5. They thought it should have been a little sweeter. With just an addition of a  pinch of cinnamon/sugar, they said it was just right.

My husband and I loved it!  I put less sugar in it and it was perfect.  We are not oatmeal type of people but, with this recipe, it is easy to enjoy it.  All the ingredient is already there also.  Even when we have to rush in the morning, there's always time to make this dish.  Thank you for a great recipe!

I've been trying to find an oatmeal recipe I like and this one is pretty good.  Was very, very soupy, maybe because we used old-fashioned oats?  Ended up using almost double the recipe to thicken it up.  A little sweet, but good flavor.

Excellent recipe, simple, quick and very tasty. If someone seems it's a bit too sweet, one can easily cut down on the brown sugar and it can also be used with egg substitute and/or skim milk but in my opinion it's superb just as it's written here.

Was ok.  Not exactly what I was looking for and when I thought Butterscotch oatmeal, though!
