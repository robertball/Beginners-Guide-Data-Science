This recipe is "alright", but we, IN TRINIDAD, usually use less condensed milk & 2 cups of rum to every 6 eggs (they chemically cook the eggs to preserve the drink). Also, Ponche de Creme or Ponche Crema doesnt mean "Punch WITH Cream", but "Cream Punch" or literally "Punch of Cream", as some people do call it.

So, first of all, I'm trini and i LOOOVVE ponchecreme.  So for the drink it self, 5 stars. This recipe needs some fixing however. I've been away form home, and although i made this with my mom for years at home, I could not remember the recipe. So, I called up Mom who says: use 3 cans of evaporated milk and 1 to 1 1/2 cans condensed milk depending on how sweet u like it. Also, add the rum sparingly depending on your own tastes. Finally, when beating the eggs, add the peel of one lemon (helps to cut the freshness of the raw egg). Serve with lots of ice  :)

The recipe is okay, however, my mother (a Trini) uses (3) cans of Evaporated Milk and 1.5 cans of condensed milk. The recipe listed above can be overly sweet with the amount of condensed milk stated.

i usually buy the store bought kind but, homemade is much better.  my husband and i visited trinidad a couple times and had this.  it's excellent! thank you so much for posting this recipe. it will taste a little too sweet and thick at first. but after you chill it and add plenty of ice it taste perfect.

Great recipe!  It was  huge hit at a holiday party.  One suggestion.  I balked at using raw eggs so I put the eggs in a ceramic bowl and placed the bowl in a pot of boiling water.  I let them stew for a few minutes.  They didn't cook all the way, but enough to pasteurize them for a bit, about 5 minutes.  The eggs took on a "custardly" feel and then I used them as the Punch Cream recipe called for.  Tasted great and I felt much better sharing it with others knowing the eggs weren't totally raw.

This was fun to try, but definitely not a favorite.  I think the aromatic bitters threw it off too much for me, although my guests didn't complain.  They just stated they preferred my usual homemade eggnog (Christmas Creamy Eggnog), but were pleased to try this anyway.  We'll stick to the traditional eggnog from now, but thanks for offering a taste of Trinidad, anyway!

I made it with 2 cans condensed milk and 2 cans evaporated milk and it was a nice mix.  Not too sweet.  I didn't have the bitters at hand so next time I will try with that.  Very delicious!

This recipe is awesome. The thought of drinking raw egg disgusts me so I use a vegan egg substitute I got at the health food store.
