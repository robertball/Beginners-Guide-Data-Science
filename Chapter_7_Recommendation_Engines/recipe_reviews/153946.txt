So awesome...much better than rice krispie treats! :) I also used Golden Grahams instead of the crisped rice cereal. Mmmmmmm!

Excellent! 
I halved all the amount and it still made a big batch.
I suggest spraying some cooking spray in your large bowl before adding ingredients in and blending and use the biggest possible bowl you can.
After i boiled the sugars i stirred in a tiny hint of almond and vanilla extract.
When everything was spread out on cookie sheets lined with wax paper to dry i added a very tiny sprinkle of salt which made for a nice sweet salty combo.

This is very nice.  It makes a huge quantity.  Mine turned out just a little soft.  I used timed and measured correctly except on the quantity of cereal.  I discovered when I got home that I had purchased my cereals a size too small.  So maybe that affected how it turned out.   Anyway it is very nice.  I can't eat very much of it because it is very sweet.  I must say this recipe is a lot of fun for kids to help with and it is ready to eat very quickly.  My grandkids like to measure and pour and it is easy because it took whole packages of cereal and whole packages of almonds and whole sticks of butter.  So everyone had a turn putting ingredients in.  Also the grandkids liked bagging this in pretty bags to give to other people for Christmas gifts.

This is Christmas Crack! So delicious it'll turn anyone into an addict. Perfect for munching alone, but also can be put as a topping for ice cream, yogurt & oatmeal. Using a cooking thermometer, make sure to bring butter, sugar, syrup mixture to 233 degrees. For slightly firmer (chewier, caramel-texture): 235-236 degrees. Enjoy!

I loved this stuff.  I made a lighter version and it turned out delicicously addictive.  I only used 1 cup of butter and 1 cup of corn syrup.  I also substituded the sugar with Splenda.  (about 16 packets equal 1 cup)  Will make this many more times.

The flavor was delicious.  How can you go wrong with so much butter and sugar!  However, mine turned out chewy and not crunchy.  I wish I had used my candy thermometer instead of just relying on the suggested timing.  I wonder if the ratio is a little off, maybe less butter would make the end result more crispy?

It came out sticky but tasted wonderful. I must not have boiled the syrup long enough. I would make it again. It makes enough for the whole neighborhood!

Cut it in half and it still made a lot. Very tasty, my daughter asked when will I be making it again as soon as the 1st batch was gone.

This was ok, but bland. It would be nice as a base recipe, but definitely needs some add-ons to jazz it up. Also, with the amount of coconut listed, you couldn't really taste it.

So delicious! Everyone that starts eating this at my house cannot stop. One of the superior gluten and dairy free snacks that I have come across. I just substituted Earth Balance Natural Buttery Spread in place of the butter.

Made 1/2 batch and that made 2 cookie sheets.   Put dried cranberries in some.   Would think it would be great with apricots or cherries.
