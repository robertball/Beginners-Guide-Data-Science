I used 1.5 pounds ground beef, added fresh garlic when browning the beef with the onions. I cut up extra potatoes and carrots. I used 2 cans of veg beef soup and 2 cans of cream of mushroom.I did not add salt - there is enough in the soup.Then I let it simmer a bit on the stove while I rolled the dough - I used a top and bottom crust.It looked better when serving and was also easier to serve.I did turn the oven up to 375 about 15 minutes before it was done. It turned out GREAT.Thank you for sharing your recipe we will have this again. I made this again but added some frozen peas and frozen corn and I liked it much better.

First meat pie I ever made, and will be sure to make it many more times.  I didn't have veg/beef soup on hand, substituted it with condensed cream of tomato soup.  Added a little water and some peas.  I cooked the potatoes and carrots by themselves and then added to mixture.  Took the easy way out and used frozen pie shells.  Easy dish to prepare but very impressive.  Thanks for submitting it Tracy.

I received this recipe via email and it sounded good. But I'm a cardiac patient and pie crust isn't on my diet (and I don't like it, anyway). But I forged ahead and made the filling with the ingredients listed. I put the filling in a lasagna pan and baked for about 35 minutes. Then I made a batter using about 3 cups of biscuit mix and skim milk. I removed the filling from the oven and spooned the batter on top. I returned it to the oven and raised the temp to 425 degrees and baked until lightly browned (about 15-20 min). Will make again.

4.5 This is very good 'comfort' food. :)  I did use Tomato Soup as suggested by another reviewer in place of the Veg. Beef Soup.  Also browned the beef & onion with fresh garlic.  Added frozen peas at end.  Instead of 2 pie plates, I used a deep 9x13 casserole & just placed a pie crust on top.  I thought it was fine with just the top crust.  Froze the leftovers & thought the reheated leftovers tasted just a good or better!  This would be a good recipe to make ahead and freeze.

My family loved this.  Very good!  To jazz it up a bit I added a little shredded cheese and mushrooms.  I will make this again.

This was different alomost like sheperds pie. I made a mistake and used Veg Beef soup so there was no need to add carrots etc. I did cube 1 small potato and came out fine. I may make this again but use cream of beef soup, potatoes and frozen veggies.

I followed the recipe with some small modifications.  I simmered the onions with a clove of diced garlic before adding the meat to brown.  I also used the frozen shredded potatoes (hash browns) and store bought frozen crust... the ultimate lazy dinner.  It was delicious, good comfort dinner but not heavy. Heres my suggestion, double the filling recipe so you haven enough for a second pie and freeze the unused filling.  It is soooo fantastic, you pull the frozen bag of precooked filling out, let thaw, and drop it into a waiting pie crust.  You've got a meal on a night when you really didn't want to cook.

This meat pie was great.  I added celery and used dry onion.  I used vegetarian vegetable soup.

This turned out really good. I used ground turkey and I suggest that you season it to your liking. I used tomato and cream of mushroom soup. Also added a can of peas and corn. Cook the potatoes and carrots a little before adding them to the mixture to soften them. Next time I will make this in a casserole and add pie crust on top. My 5 year old and 13 month old really like this.

Made this tonight. I had 1.5 lbs of meat so I added an extra can of vegetable beef soup as well as some garlic to the recipe. I also added only one potato to the mixture because the soup had potatoes in it. I made the pie with a top crust and liked it but my guys only thought it was ok. Unsure if I will make this again.

I have made this a few times and we love it. I have frozen the extra pie as this filling will do 2 pies. The frozen pie tastes as good as the fresh.  Basically follow recipe thru, I don't always use the extra carrots as the veg soup as enough for us.  Great recipe

Very tasty meat pie. Followed recipe exactly with exception of using pre-made frozen pie crusts. Next time, might use more soup (1 can ea.) to make pies a little more moist. Good, easy recipe! On a later occasion, made 2 more pies due popular demand. Used 2 cans each of cream of mushroom and beef veggie, (instead of 1 each). As per someone's suggestion, fried up fresh garlic along with ground beef and onion. Included canned mushrooms and added grated mozzarella on top before placing store-bought crusts on the pies. This gets better and better.

I don't know if I did something wrong (I can't imagine I could screw this up because the recipe is so easy) but it was pretty underwhelming. The consistency was also very weird. With the 2 cans of soup, I was imagining this would have more of a gravy consistency but it's more along the lines of ground beef held loosely together with soup pudding. The potatoes definitely need to be cooked at least a little before it goes in the oven or else there will be too much of a crunch left in the potatoes (unless you cut them into very small cubes). I added red pepper flakes, a little cajun seasoning called "Slap Ya Momma", seasoning salt, a little sea salt, and fresh ground pepper. And while the meat was browning, I added about a clove or more of minced garlic. Before I put everything in the oven, I added 2-3 tbsp of butter because the filling just tasted off. The reason why I added 2 different kinds of salt is because I used low sodium soup. I'm hoping the flavors really come together tomorrow for the leftovers but the meal same day, was just ok. Which is a shame because since this makes so much, there's another whole pie filling sitting in my fridge. This recipe doesn't deserve to be thrown out but it definitely needs tweaking. I suggest if you want to try it, just halve everything so you make one pie instead of 2 and end up wondering what to do with the rest that you don't like (I'm hoping that by adding a beef gravy to the filling and then serving that with noodles will be good).

My family enjoyed this pie.  A good week-night meal.  I may experiment with using different soups next time. (It was a little too  "vegetable beef" for me!)  Also might add some different veggies and some fresh herbs.

We made this the other night for dinner and followed the recipe exactly with exception the addition of garlic and we added a bottom crust as well.  The end result was ok - surprisingly bland....this would be a good recipe for someone just learning how to cook.

Recipe was very good. I added a little layer of Cheddar cheese as the top layer (before the top crust)  I also added a few mild banana pepper rings. I wish I would have used a little less potatoes. Very good! Thanks!

I pretty much love anything with pie crust! I thought this recipe was an easy meal and had no trouble understanding or following the directions. It turned out just fine.  All of us should know that we are able to put our picture with anyone's recipe if there is not one already. It may be unfortunate that a modified recipe's photo was used, but it seems a lot of people are quick to judge without thought.

This is even better as a leftover a day or two later. I found that I didn't have enough pie crust and actually needed one more due to the amount of filling it made.

This was the easiest and the tastiest meat pie I have ever fixed. It went over real well with my real picky eaters.

Really thought we would like this but it is bland, even with extra seasonings.   Family didn't care for it--will not make it again.

My boyfriend requested Meat Pie, and I am so glad I found this recipe!  I had enough to fill 2 pie shells and gave the extra to my boyfriends dad.  The dad immediately called us with compliments.  The other was eaten with my parents & they absolutely adored it as well!  Huge hit, Yum!

i thought this was rather boring actually, and there were a lot of things that could have been improved upon to make a tastier recipe. also the vegetables need to be cooked slightly before putting in the pie or they will be hard.

Did this as is and it was very good. For the crust, I used frozen pie shells in which I filled one and flipped the other on top of it and sealed. We are going to make revisions for the next try as we both thought the taste was similar to a pasty. I'm going to use less carrot/potato so that I can add some rutebega and will use a ground beef/sausage mix. It will be awesome.  Thanks.

Pretty good!  I used refrigerated pie crusts on the top.  I would recommend cooking the carrots and potatoes for a few minutes in the microwave first to help soften them up.

I must admit that I thought this recipe looked a bit strange but I had all the ingredients so I thought "What the heck"!! Even when I was putting it together I didn't think I would like it....BUT GUESS WHAT?? It was REALLY REALLY GOOD!! I made the filling this morning then added the crust just before baking. I also added a can of sliced mushrooms and some minced garlic. I did par boil the carrots and potatoes first. Also I defrosted a frozen pie crust for the top. Served with a tossed salad and it was a hit. I will definatley make this again and the best part is I still have one pie to freeze for a night I don't feel like cooking. Thanks for the great recipe!!

Very tasty and easy to make.  I used mixed frozen vegetables in place of the carrots and added 2 cloves of minced garlic.  I plan on making this recipe twice a month...we loved it!

This was a ok recipe.  I followed exactly for one and mixed in beef noodle and cream of mushroom for the second pie.  The one with veggies had a lot more flavor.  A good recipe to experiment with.  I will make again.

I thought this was ok, a little bland for my taste though, even after I added a little garlic powder to try to spice it up. I think I would have to really add something to make it worth having again. It's a good basic recipe to build on though.

I'm one of those people- I sort of made this recipe. But it turned out delish! I subbed pears for the potatoes, and added lots of veggies which probably really changed the flavor profile. But the base recipe was sound. Mine came out a bit runny, but that's probably the pears.

I make this regularly and for company, everyone loves it!  If I don't have vegetable beef soup on hand I substitute a beef boullion cube in water.  And I usually make my own butter pie crust.  Delicious!

Absolutely delicious.  I also added a can of peas, and the flavor was awesome.  (Oh, and instead of the veggie-beef soup, i used a can of condensed Tomato soup...really gave it a rich flavor).  Highly recommend this recipe.  And you can make it a little easier by buying two deep dish frozen pie crusts and using one as the top crust.  Very good!!!!

Thanks Tracy, this was a hit with the whole family! I used frozen peas, carrots, corn, diced up one large baking potato and fried up 8oz of sliced mushrooms. I also added one minced clove garlic to the onions, a few dashes of worcestershire sauce, and a few dashes of white pepper. I will be making this again. Great left overs too!

A note to Eileen K, I too noticed the egg in the picture, so I went in search of Mrs. Sidek's review to see what she said.  Lo and behold, the "mystery" was solved as she states right in her review that she added hard boiled quail eggs!

This was a great recipe. I didn't have any veg beef soup on hand, so made gravy with beef stock... probably would have been better with the soup. Will definitely make this again.

Just wanted to thank Tracy for great recipe. Lots of reviews! Of course I am lazy and used frozen veggies and canned bisquits as topping. I make it both ways. I don't like mushrooms so used cream of celery soup for myself. Family likes mushrooms so make it that way too. Perfect for the colder weather that is coming.

very nice tasting pie, leftovers were as good as first serving. I did add a sprinkle of mint, maybe a half teaspoon, to the meat mixture. the only change I would make for the next time is I will use dough on the bottom of the pie as well as the top; this will make it easier to serve. will definitely be making it again.

One star indicates “couldn’t eat it”.  My one star indicates “I would never make it”.   Why canned soup?  Outside of the fact that canned soup leaves a distinct unpleasant taste in recipes, it is not healthy, unless you are using the low sodium soup, which is even nastier.

Made one tonite for the first time.....never tried a meat pie before! I added fresh garlic & onion to the hamburger when I cooked it, fresh green beans (already steamed),  shredded carrots), a small amt of mushrooms & green pepper & 1 can of cream of mushroom soup. Instead of cubed or sliced potatoes, I layered the bottom of the pie plate with leftover mashed potatoes before I added the other ingredients. It was STUFFED to the brim! SO GOOD! Wish I had someone to share it with!

Some said that this was too bland. You do have to embellish a little.  Salt and pepper and worchershire go a long way.  I added garlic and Lawry's seasoning too.  Previous people said to use tomato soup instead of veg. beef and it was nummy!  Also some cheese and mushrooms on top of the meat didn't hurt!  Definitely will make this again!

Great recipe!  My boyfriend said his mother used to make him meat pie and asked me to make one.  Well her recipe was a little plain so I found this one and made it.  He absolutely loved it!!  Make sure and let the pie stand it will thicken up and cut well, if not and  you just dive in like my boyfriend did it's like a chicken pot pie and will be messy lol.

We thought it was a quick, easy, and delicious meal. I particularly liked the fact that it made two pies, one of which I froze and ate later.

I just made this recipe exactly as written.  We loved it.  Carrots had a little bite to them. I like them that way but husband would like them softer. If you want the carrots soft, bake 10 mins longer and don't forget to let it sit 15 minutes after baking.  I feared it might be dry, but it was not.  Will definitely make again

I have prepared this recipe 4 times, only I use ground turkey instead of ground beef. My son, his girlfriend, and several of his buddies have all flipped over it. It is easy to prepare and tastes delicious. Thank you Tracy for this recipe.

This was very good. I added a little fresh garlic to the mixture and next time will add some worchestire sauce just to try as someone else suggested. The family liked it a lot.  It was neat getting some vegetables into the kids. One problem I had was that the pie was runny inside. My oven is not working right, so, it probably has something to do with it. Still we'd make it again.

This was a good basic recipe, but could use some more spices. I shared this with coworkers and they loved it.

We really liked this.  It was quick and easy, and very tasty.  I substitued frozen peas and carrots for the carrots, and added a bit of worcestershire sauce, garlic and grated parm.  Delicious!

Didn't have tin of vege soup so I used packet soup and added 1/2 required water.  I also added beef stock powder, peas, and a bottom crust.  Everyone loved it.

I didn't have potatoes on hand so I used sweet potatoes instead.  I kind of liked it, but my husband kept saying, "with regular potatoes, I could eat the whole other pie by myself."  I'll try it again.

This recipe was pretty easy and turned out pretty much what I thought.  It had a lot of flavor.  My husband went back for more.  Not much left over.  It did remind me shepards pie.  I will make again

I left the potatoes out, cooked and mashed them and spooned onto the pie, grated cheese and browned.

Needless to say...I read it, made it EXACTLY as called for (with ONE crust on TOP!!) and my youngest son loved it!! It is his second day after he had his braces tightened...he CAN'T chew anything hard. He had 2 helpings!  Thanks for the recipe!!
