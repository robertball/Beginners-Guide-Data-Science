Set aside some of the liquid in the can when draining the beans because you will need to add a little bit of it, otherwise, you'll have very dry beans.  I liked the flavor that the brown sugar brings to this recipe, but this was just a little too sweet for us.  In the future, I will reduce the brown sugar to 1 tsp and saut√© some chopped onion in the bacon fat to add to the beans.  Small thing, but melt your butter first, stir in the brown sugar, and then add your drained beans and crumbled bacon.  We like butter beans, but they're something that I seldom think about serving on their own as a side dish, but we enjoyed them with pork chops.

Holy cow this was good!!!  I used extra bacon (always good) and probably a bit extra brown sugar.  It could easily be addictive!!!

This was quick and easy and delicious.  I had 3 pieces of bacon left in the package, so that's what went in.  But no one in this house has ever complained about too much bacon.  And I might cut back the brown sugar a little next time, but I would not eliminate it.  This would be excellent exactly as written, and thus the 5 stars.

These were just okay for us.  I made them as directed and they came out on the dry side.  The flavors were nice, but I think a little more liquid would help.
