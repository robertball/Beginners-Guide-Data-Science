I can't imagine making this recipe exactly as outlined here. Not sure how the potatoes and cauliflower would simmer without the addition of at least two cups of water (or broth). With the liquid, however, it got nice and saucy. I also doubled the carrots and added garlic. 
Also, due to the low burning point of olive oil, it's a poor choice to use for frying. Olive oil also has a Mediterranean flavour that's not right for a curry dish, and it's expensive. Save your olive oil for a nice dressing and use regular vegetable oil and butter for this dish.

My husband loved this. I cooked the potatoes and cauliflower first though. Also added 1/2 c. frozen peas at his request. Great flavor, smells wonderful. Spicy.

This was a great recipe that even my curry-wary husband loved. 

I made a few changes though. 

1. Cut out the butter - indulgent and not needed. A touch of oil did the job.

2. I accidentally read the recipe backwards and doubled the tumeric and halved the curry. It was a wise mistake! It came out so yummy this way.

We ate it in fresh whole wheat pita bread and loved it! It's also great as a cold snack.

This was okay.  I added a little extra curry powder and turmeric.  I found it was a little dry so during cooking, added some water. (I would have used chick.broth but I didn't have any on hand)

Very tasty, but i made changes as per some other reviews. I added enough water and vegetable stock for the vegetables to cook without pre-cooking, and added peas (good tip). I also upped the curry powder and turmeric, and added 3 large spoonfuls of creme fraiche 10 minutes before serving to make a creamy sauce. Served with pilau rice, poppodums and naan, this was a lovely alterntaive to a meat curry, and very light.

Agree this is a great starter recipe with so many possible variations. Some type of liquid is definitely needed in order to simmer the vegetables. Liked the suggestions of tomato paste and creme fraiche. I substituted thick chunks of yellow squash for the potatoes but may use potatoes another time. Didn't realize I had no turmeric on hand until I had the preparation well underway. I omitted the salt(because I used chicken broth)and pepper(reviewer's tip)and even with these omissions we thought it was very good. Since I didn't use potatoes I didn't see the need to pre-cook the vegetables so my cooking time was still only about 20-25 minutes. Glad I saw this recipe and thanks for the previous reviews - will definitely be making this again and again.

Excellent! I made this for dinner last night and it was great, had it for lunch today and it's even better! I subbed sweet potatoes for white, doubled the curry and turmeric and added 1 cup chicken bouillon for moisture.

Delicious! I followed the others suggestions to use chicken broth and/or water while simmering the potatoes and cauliflower. I used 1 cup broth and 1 cup water. Next time I will use 1/2 cup more of each, I would have liked just a bit more sauce. I also added a few other things for a bit more spice and flavor; 1/2 tsp. curry paste, 1/2 tsp. chili powder, 1 tsp. garlic, 1 tsp. fresh grated ginger and I did use additional curry and turmeric. Thanks very much for the recipe and the added suggestions to make the exact curry dish I was looking for!

this is a very good starter recipe!  It easily accepts substitution of whatever vegetables you happen to have on hand. I used fresh instead of frozen. I added nutritional yeast for a thickening (didn't have tomato paste on hand) and red pepper flakes to spice it up.  I agree with the many before me, if you like a lot of "kick" add more curry powder.

Like another member suggested, I cooked the veggies first, until they had about five minutes left to go. Then I added them to the skillet and also added about 1/2 cup of water to evenly coat the veggies. Served over rice, I couldn't stop eating it.

I didn't have tumeric or red pepper.  I thought it was very good anyway.  I added a little water twice to help cook the potatoes and cauliflower.

I add some chkn broth as others suggested. I also cut the curry powder to 1.5 Tablespoons, added 1 tsp garlic, few squirts of lemon juice and 1/2 tsp ginger.  With these modifications this recipe is dynamite!

Like other reviewers said, this recipe is a great base.  I added some chicken broth at the simmer point, as suggested by the other reviewers and skipped the salt.  Instead of black pepper, I added a little red chili powder for some real kick.  Instead of the olive oil, I used a less flavorful and more versatile high heat oil.  Toward the end of the simmer time, we threw in a handful of frozen peas.  I'm keeping this one in the recipe box.

This is a good curry dish. I found the butter unnecessary. As other reviewers suggested, I added 2 cups of broth to skillet after the spices and before the potatoes and cauliflower. Let it come to a boil, then add vegetables. Fantastic over rice!

Creamier: Add a cup of water, more spices and smother it for 15min, lid over the wok. Even creamier: add milk. Btw this recipe is called "Aloo Gobi Masala" (Potatoe - Cauliflower Curry)

This recipe was very tastey, but definitely did require some extra cooking and moisture for the carrots and potatoes.  I also added garbanzo beans and garlic, and everybody, myself, my 2 year old, and my husband, loved it.

This is a pretty good quick curry recipe. It's definitely a lighter version than with the coconut milk. I did add about 2 cups of veggie broth and some arrowroot powder (about 1.5 tsp) to thicken the sauce up a bit.
Very yummy and not much left for lunch the next day.

This dish was awesome!!!!!!! But I added garlic and green bell peppers in the pan when you put the carrots and onions in. I also put about 1/3 cup of chicken stock on when I  put in the cauliflower and potatoes in the pan.

very quick and easy, i used this recipe as a starter and then added my own touches. i used a commercial curry mix found in any good indian grocery store, plus some chickpea flour (besan) and coconut milk. i didn't have cauliflower so i used red peppers. fry they taters and carrots first then add the onions and peppers, etc. mix in the flour paste and coconut milk last. the possiblities are endless!

Excellent recipe to add to my curry collection. I took the advice of some of the reviewers and added a cup of chicken broth, as well as using all canola oil instead of the butter/olive oil combo. Although I usually use all fresh ingredients, I like canned potatoes for a dish like this to maintain a good texture, as well as decrease the cooking time a little. Thanks for this recipe.

Yep, you definitely need to keep an eye on this while it's cooking, and add liquid when it gets dries out (I used chicken broth). I cut back on the pepper flakes since I was making it to go with the already-spicy Yogurt-Marinated Salmon Fillets (Dahi Machhali Masaledar) from this site. I also omitted the tumeric as mine has been in the cupboard too long and has got kinda sour. Next time I'll use peas insetad of carrots (we didnt really care for the taste). Not bad though. Thanks!

Even when I took others' advice and added two cups of water and peas and yogurt this still ended up as a fairly bland curry. Perhaps that's because of a lack of decent curry powder but even so, not the greatest curry recipe. My search continues!

Yum.  I did boil the cauliflower and potatoes while I sauteed the onion and carrot.  I also added frozen peas as suggested.  I enjoyed this dish more the second day after the flavors had time to sit over night.

I added peas, because someone else suggested it and it did need something green.  I also added some water to keep it from drying out and a couple boullion cubes so it wouldn't get watered down.

This is a great recipe to tinker with! I don't think the estimated prep/cook time is accurate though...it's more like an hour at least by the time you prepare all the vegetables and let them steam to perfection. Not a quick fix meal by any means, but well worth the effort! Make a big batch so you can freeze it and enjoy for a quick lunch/dinner.

Three stars because I added coconut milk and chicken broth with it.  I used a whole soup can size for coconut milk.  I left out carrots and added chick peas.  Made homemade cornbread to go with it.  Also used lots more of the spice..  Just kept seasoning to taste.  And I like mine with extra sauce like you see here.

We'll definitely make this again!   Fortunately we read the tips prior to making this - so we added half again as much curry and tumeric.     And yes, you definitely need chicken broth - for a serving for 4, we used 1/2 can and it worked out great.    Another thing we'll do differently is to cut down on the amount of potatoes - we used 2 good sized potatoes for a serving for 4 and would use smaller potatoes (or maybe just one) for the next time.  We didn't serve over rice but that would be an option to make the dish go farther.   If serving over rice, I think you'd want to add more chicken broth.

I doubled the spices, used my own vegetable combos (several different iterations - all good), and simmered 15 minutes with 1.75c of vegetable stock. It turned out great and I'll be incorporating this regularly.

Forgot I didn't have potatoes left so substituted turnip last minute.  They had the same texture and taste, just a bit of radishy aftertaste.  Recommended substitution.

I made this for my husband and he said it was really good!! Iused different vegis as to what I had on hand and I don't have turmeric. Let me tell you- whatever i threw in there smelled really good and I never had to add liquid> That surprised me tremendously!! I used some really OLD potatoes and my hubby said the pots. did not taste good with this. Fresh ones could have made a difference. I will make this again for hubby!!

I eliminated the butter, salt, and black pepper.  I didn't have carrots or turmeric, but would have used them otherwise.  As other reviewers suggested, I added some chicken stock while simmering and peas at the end.  Curry is always great with plain lowfat yogurt to tame the spiciness!

I too cooked the vegetables in advance, and added some chicken broth, but it was still very dry. Tasty, but dry. Next time, I'll try adding a) more liquid, and b) some tomato sauce perhaps.

very tasty, but yes, water is needed pour a little at a time, as it will cook into the veggies quickly  served over quinoa, which is a little healthier  recommended

This dish seems like it is missing some sort of key ingredient but I can't figure out what it is.  I also think that it would taste a little better with fewer potatoes in it.  I followed the advice of an earlier reviewer and added frozen peas to the dish which I thought were very yummy, and I also ended up adding about a cup of water while I was cooking the veggies in order to keep them from getting too dry, and to make a bit of a sauce for the dish.

Cauliflower was still quite hard after 20 minutes (I was out of potatoes, so can't comment on them).  Use a BIG skillet. I may try making this in the Instant Pot.

This dish was great! I served with brown rice and salad. I like my food more on the sour side so I added some lime juice. Also, for the digestive reason, I added some dried mint to it. It came out great. My husband is not vegetarian and that is all he eat last night. Will make it again.

Firstly you really do need to add at least 2 cups of some kind of liquid otherwise it turns into a big thick type of stew 
I added 2 cups of stock plus a can of coconut cream and it was delicious 
I also added a sweet potato and a cup of frozen peas 
A big hit for the entire family

I prepared this exactly as written, but doubled.  It was easy since I had the ingredients already and didn't need to run to the store.  I cut the potatoes  into small cubes and they cooked up well.    It was delicious and my husband and house guests liked it and went back for more.  (It's difficult to find meatless meals they enjoy.)

I like this recipe and have made it several times. I roast the potatoes ( red and white), cauliflower, adding green bells and omitting the carrots. I saute the onions in the butter and olive oil and add the spices when the onions are opaque. I add the roasted vegetables to the onions and spices and add chick peas. My boys who are not adventurous eaters love it.

It's not bad, I was worried with the amount of spices that it would be too spice flavored. I'm curious to try different Curries. Just be careful with the utensils you use, I stained one of my brushes that I use to clean dishes with and a spoon and I'm hoping my skillet isn't ruined after this. Just be careful and promptly wash everything to hopefully avoid it.

loved this recipe, followed it exactly and it was perfect. I did keep a lid on it so it would stay moist, half way through add a very small amount of water. Perfect

I had to add water for the cooking process, but this is absolutely the recipe I've been trying to get from my Indian co-workers who come to work with delicious smelling dishes daily.  Now my curry can stand up to theirs at the Dept. pot-luck.  Great recipe!

I followed many suggestions (thanks!) and also added my own: I agree that there should be way more curry powder than called for, and I added spinach and chickpeas at the very end for some fibre and more vegies. Everyone thought it was "ok" but not amazing. I'm going to play around a bit more with the spices and seasonings next time and maybe it'll move up to 4 stars!

I love this dish all by itself and have made it repeadetly. I use frozen cauliflower and carrots and always keep them on hand so i can make this dish at the drop of a hat.
