I was a little more excited about the thought of this recipe than its result.  Still - it's solid, but with a few cautions.  First - add the lime juice carefully and taste.  You'll need more or less depending on how sweet your pineapple is.  My pineapple was pretty tart, and the addition of lime juice (in that quantity) made the salsa a little too sour.  Also, a little seasoning is in order.  Salt and pepper the filets before pressing in the seeds.  Otherwise, it's a solid recipe and very light.

love this recipe. very simple and easy to  make. I only changed it a bit, using crushed pineapple versus chunks. I increased the red onions to 3 tablespoons. since Mahi can be a bit bland, I sprinkle a lemon garlic seasoning mix on it before cooking. I serve it with the cilantro lime rice recipe from this site as well.

The flavors don't really do anything to enhance the flavor of the Mahi Mahi.  It's a delicious topping just addded to a bland fish.

Very simple, easy, quick to make meal. I served with a side of sesame jasmine rice. There was nothing bad about this recipe it just didn't have any "WOW" factor; according to my family of food critics. I would make this again on a night with limited prep/cook time but it probably won't make the regular rotation list.

I liked it but I'd cut down on the cilantro a bit.
