I had never made jam before, and this turned out beautifully. I was greatly aided by an electric mixer in mashing the mango. Also, it helps if you cook the jam in a tall pot, as it bubbles and spatters as it boils, and can make quite a mess. I doubled the recipe and reduced the sugar without a problem, and now I have something I can do with all those mangoes we get in the backyard every summer.

Mangolicious Jam. I cut back the sugar by 1/2, as I used a ratio of equal parts mango to sugar. I also used 2 teaspoons lemon juice and 3/4 of a lemon zested for it to thicken.

OH MY GOODNESS! I am VERY happy with this recipe.  I tweeked it a little because I only had one mango so I divided it by half and only used 1/2 cup of Sugar in the Raw (the only sugar I have).  This is the first Jam I have every made and I cannot wait to put it on toast or a PB&J!

This was excessively sweet, although it could have been because I used really ripe mangoes. It also took a lot more than five minutes for the jam to thicken. Besides the sweetness, the taste was great. I added some lime juice to make it a little fruitier, and it's really subtle but brings out the brightness of the mango flavor. 

I'd make it again, but I'd probably cut the sugar by half a cup and use less water.

Very Yummy but, since Mango's are naturally sweet, I cut the sugar by half and then added as needed by taste.  I also left on stove longer to make thicker, like a butter.  Very big hit!

This was really tasty and full of mango flavor.  I only used 1/2 cup sugar and a 3 TBL Low or no-sugar RealFruit Pectin (= 1 box). Very spreadable and really good.  I just cut up the mango and put into a pot and used my immersion blender (hand held kind) to get a really smooth consistency. Left out the saffron.

Made this and my family absolutely loved it. They were all iffy at first but warmed up after tasting! The only thing I do differently is I fully mash one mango but the others I dice really small so there are some chunks but it's still relatively spreadable.

So delicious! I pureed the mangos in the blender to make them smooth. I don't care for the chunky jams. I will definitely make this again!

Well, this was a first time making Jam.  My Mango were getting ready for the garbage and needed a new home.  I followed the directions as stated and ended up with some great Mango Jam!  I am so excited I want to send my wife to work with some to give to her associates so I can get my daily feedback of a new cook!

I made this recipe as is, as I hate rating the recipes cutting back on sugar and such. I used exactly 2 lbs of ripe mango, the all yellow ones, and it was not too sweet. I think your taste will depend on the type of mango you use. If you use the smaller all yellow mango, they are much blander then other and will need all the sugar this recipe calls for. The taste and texture of this jam is awesome!

Great way to use that case of mango's from Sam's Club. I also added the 2 tsp lemon juice and zest from the lemon and cut the sugar in half.  Turned out great.

Clear, unintimidating jam recipe. Reading some of the reviews, I cut back on the sugar a bit: I used 4 cups chopped mango (2 large mangos, 1 ripe and 1 not so ripe), 3 cups sugar and 1/4 cup lime juice (I was out of lemon). When the fruit softened a bit I used immersion blender to puree it. I had 4 perfect half-pints of jam, bright in color and yummy tasting, in less than an hour. Christmas presents for neighbors~

I made this jam last night and even though I looked away for a half second and the temp went to 280, it still turned out lovely. I did double the recipe exactly and it still worked out great! The only modification I made was I pur√©ed some mint and lemon juice, drained it, and added the finely minced mint leaves after the mango pur√©e. It is DIVINE!! Thank you for a great basic recipe that can be customized easily!

Mine turned out more like mango butter than jam (not sure I cooked it long enough) but tastes WONDERFUL! And what a beautiful color!

The final result was delicious, but I followed the recipe exactly, and my first batch of sugar totally crystallized.  According to my thermometer, the "thread" stage is 220, not 270.  When I cooked it to that temp, it turned out wonderfully.  For those of us who don't live in the tropics, it works very well with frozen mangos also.

Well, just got done making my mango jam. Its the first time for this recipe and never had such a hard time fighting with peeling warm mango's; to hot on the inside and hard time getting the skins off!! I did use only 1 cup of sugar & added 2 tsp of lemon juice. Great consistency. Wow..Now that its done I can say it came out GREAT...Yea!!!

Made this tonight - was quick and easy. Next time I might reduce sugar.  Was on stove to thicken for about 15 minutes.  I also added 1/2 tsp ground ginger to the mashed mangoes. I 'quality-control tasted' a little and cant wait to try it tomorrow.

I made the recipe as is, minus the saffron as my mangoes were ripe and needed no help in color. I‚Äôm giving the recipe a 2 Star due to the jam not setting up at all even though the sugar mix set perfectly. I‚Äôm not sure if I had too much mango pulp or not enough pulp because I had no clue as to weight. Most kitchens don‚Äôt have a scale to measure 2 lbs of mangoes so I had to guess. Cups of mango chunks, pur√©e would have been helpful vs. as written. I‚Äôm passing on using in the future but it was fun trying and it is delicious but will use it more as a topping for desserts than a jam.

I did add the zest of 2 navel oranges and the juice to the the water to make 1 cup of liquid. I blended it until almost smooth with a few lumps of fruit. It is a lovely color and flavor. Sunshine in a jar. My mangoes were very ripe. I used about 6 cups blended to 1 cup of sugar, the juice and zest of 2 oranges. I got 5 pints of jam. So good and easy. I like that it doesn't use pectin and it seems to be setting up nicely.

I made this using 9 ripe medium to large size mangos off a co-worker's tree, 2 cups of sugar, juice of one large lemon and a box of low sugar pectin.  It came out amazing.  These make great holiday gifts when Mangos are out of season in the Winter.

This recipe is simple but still tasty. I have made it several times and have discovered that the best taste and consistency were achieved with a combination of very ripe mangoes and one semi-ripe one. My family loves this more than any other type of jam now and get upset when I run out!

If you love mango you will love this.  It sets up nicely and the saffron adds color and unique flavor.  I would made this again.

Simple and yummy. My 10 year old made this. We did not have saffron, so next time we def have to try adding it. We used super ripe mangos and it turned out great.

I used frozen mango slices for this and half the sugar as many reviewers did. I also added 1 or 2 T. lime juice and 1 tsp vanilla. I wanted it to taste like the Mango Mango preserves that were featured on Shark Tank recently!

Fantastic way to use up extra mango. 
I cut the sugar in half; still found this incredibly sweet. 
Squeezed a lime and a lemon into the mix and that made it a 4 star spread.

I followed the recipe exactly, substituting 1 Tblsp of ground ginger for the saffron. So good! I'm going to use some of it as a filling in a sweet bread braid I'm making. I can't wait to see how the bread turns out!

This turned out pretty great! I was unsure about the texture and consistency at first because it seemed a little loose. But it tasted great! I did not use the saffron, but added cinnamon and nutmeg instead. It is going to be a great gift for the holidays!!!

very simple and tasty, I found that microwaving the whole fruit made is very easy to get the good stuff off of that stubborn seed.  In addition, I changed it up by adding some very hot peppers to the mix. It is delicious

I really liked the ease of this recipe. Nuking the mangos was the easiest way to get to the pulp for me and the 2nd time I made this jam I refrigerated overnight then peeled. I also put the pulp in a food processor for a couple of pulses. Worked great. I guess I'm not cooking the sugar mixture long enough before putting the mango in because it definitely is taking longer than 5 minutes to gel but it gives me plenty of time to get my jars hot. I used 2 mangos which netted 3 half pints. The 2nd time I used 6 mangos which netted 9 3/4 half pints.

This was awesome. The first time I tried to make it, I burnt the sugar because I never saw the syrup make thin threads. The second time, I still never saw the threads but went ahead and put in the mango pulp just before I thought the sugar would burn. It turned out excellent. I didn't realize it was this easy to make jam. Thanks for sharing the recipe. :-)

Made this in two stages.  First time exactly as written.  A little sweet for my taste but others really liked it.  (My mangoes were very ripe which may have contributed to the sweetness).  Next time I added pineapple (About a 3 to 2 ratio of mango to pineapple) some habenero peppers, lemon juice and liquid pectin (Since I cut way back on the sugar).  Again great results.  Will be making this again in the future both with the original post and with my modifications.  Thanks for a great way to use up mangoes.

Great texture and taste! I halved the recipe and added 2 roughly ground cardamoms in it to enhance the flavour. 

Confused wrt to storage as no preservatives were added.

I love this recipe. I agree with cutting back the sugar with really ripe mangos. I have made it twice in smaller batches and both tines it was so simple and absolutely delicious. I am trying it this weekend with other fruit combos. Blueberry, blackberry, and starwberry ruhbarb. Im hopingcit works well with other fuit options :-)
