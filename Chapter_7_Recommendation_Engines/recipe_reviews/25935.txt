READ THIS FIRST:  I haven't made this receipe but I DO have a suggestion.  For the best dumplings ever I always use the Original Bisquick (not the reduced fat, it's terrible) and the receipe on the box.  Everyone loves them and will be excited to hear the next time you are going to serve "dumplings".  I've even made dumplings when serving canned soup.  Happy New Year!

It was very easy I boiled my chicken instead of following the recipe and I thickened the broth before I put the dumplings on top, This is a very good dumpling recipe and I would recommend trying it

I don't know what I did wrong.  This was my first attempt at dumplings and I'm no chef but based on the recipe, there didn't seem like enough liquid to poach the dumplings.  It smelled wonderful and was overall pretty easy to prepare but my dumplings would have made better landfill.  They were rubbery and just overall nasty.  I don't blame this on the recipe but my inexperience - but I still think that there should be more liquid some how.  I'll give this another try, I just don't think I'll use this particular recipe again.

Take the time to place the dough on a floured surface and roll it out to no more than 1/2" thickness. Cut into 1" wide strips (don't worry about the length of the strips). Bring the broth to a boil and drop the dough strips in one by one. Don't worry about covering the pot. The dumplings are done when the strips float to the top.Dress the bowl of chicken and dumplings with a few drops of green Tobasco sauce--So good it makes ya wanna holler!

Seriously, all the boys in our house loved this. My husband had seconds.  I have NEVER made dumplings before and this was easy.  I do think it could have more broth added to make more sauce.  Tasty!

I absolutely LOVED the dumplings!  They were so light and the buttermilk and parsley made them taste awesome.  I think the key is to not use too much liquid.  I used 2/3 c. of buttermilk + 2T.  I used more broth and thickened it with some cornstarch.  I also used chicken breast instead of boneless thighs.  I would definitely make this again.

This recipe is great, but if you are sreving more than one or two people you are going to increase the ingredients quite a bit. I fed 6 hungry men and 2 two year olds with the recipe adjusted for 15.

Not quite what I expected.  The mixture seemed a bit "brothy" and the dumplings didn't quite work.  At first, there wasn't enough liquid to hold them together, so I put in more buttermilk and they ended up being weird doughballs.  Still in search of a good recipe for this...

This had a very good flavor and was very easy to make. My family enjoyed this a lot. My only suggestion is to increase the sauce. It doesn't make enough. The dumplings were very good, but took a little longer than recipe stated. Very easy alternative to chicken pot pie. Thanks!

I used Trader Joe's multigrain baking mix for the dumplings, and it was a very tasty and nutritious meal for our family.

This was sooo good. I cook from scratch quite a bit, but had never made chicken and dumplings. My husband is the dumpling fan...not me. The only changes I made was using poultry seasoning, subbed fresh cut carrots and I more than doubled the broth. I still felt like I could have tripled it and this was for three people and a toddler. My dumplings turned out quite gummy, but maybe I didn't let them simmer long enough for their size. Another recipe says by adding some cornmeal to the dumpling dough solves this issue. Might have to try that some time. I also browned my chicken and used on the bone in chicken breasts. Then removed the meat and shredded it. I was a little unsure if this was going to be good. It looked like dirty chicken soup until I added the dumplings. All of a sudden it looked thick and tasty. Everyone liked it and I have to be super careful with my teen and husband. Definitely adding this in my regular rotation.

Just average. Not great. Not horrible though. It was a good recipe to use my leftover roast chicken for though.

This was a delicious dish of chicken and dumplings.  Mine came out a tad dry and next time I'll add a bit more chicken boullion.  Otherwise, it was perfect and easy!

My boyfriend loved this recipe,(myself not so much but I think its just more a matter of taste.) It looked and smelled delicious. I had to change the recipe just a little because I didn't have any sage so I substituted savory. I added a half can of water to make sure there was enough sauce to cook the dumplings in. Also always be careful with how much milk you use when making pastry-type dishes because you should be able to roll the dough out and knead it to make it tender and fluffy and I definitely didn't have to use as much buttermilk as the recipe called for. For those of you who don't have buttermilk the standard substution is for every cup regular milk one Tablespoon lemon juice and let stand for a few minutes before using. Very good recipe but I won't be making it again simple on a matter of preference (I hate not liking what I cook no matter who else does like it.)

I added 3 cups more broth to cook dumplings and added garlic since we love garlic. My family loved it. Easy with no leftovers.Definitely a keeper.

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I agree with others that it needs more broth.  I added a can of broth plus one cup, but will add more next time I make it.  I think the dumplings were great.  You will probably have some dough leftover.  I have to disagree with Claudia who suggested using Bisquick, nothing beats dumplings made from scratch!  The flavor was excellent.  Thanks for sharing, Jenny.

I pretty much did my own thing on the chicken/soup part of the recipe so I won't even comment on that part, but the dumplings were a disaster. I doubled the recipe to feed 8, and should have kept the same amount of dumpling batter for the original recipe for 4. I had to throw a big lump of it out. They were gummy, pratically runny, even after the recommended cooking time with the lid securely in place the whole time. They pretty much tasted like cooked flour. Sorry, not my idea of a good dumpling.

This recipe was very good.  I used Bisquick dumplings, they are easier and sooo good!  Make sure that you let the soup cool a little before serving.

I used dried parsley in the dumplings and used a rolling pin to roll them into thin strips. My grandson said he loved the dumplings.

I like it best when I cut and add the veggies myself.  The meal tastes so much better that way!  However, the dumplings are GREAT with this recipie.

This was very good, but as others have said, it does seem to need more liquid.  I used two cups of broth and it was not enough.  It also seems like too many dumplings.  Along with the onion and garlic I also sauteed celery and carrots.  I added some frozen peas and green beans instead of mixed vegetables.  The broth thickened a bit with the addition of the dumplings, and since there wasn't enough it was pretty much absorbed.  I will make this again using more broth.  The dumplings are delicious.

I have to go middle of the road on this one. I did have to add much more seasoning than is called for as we are a family that craves spice. I normally make the drop dumplings like in the recipe, but this time I followed other reviewers' suggestions and took the time to roll out the dough.  It got mixed reviews from the family.  The oldest, who is usually the most picky, liked it "a little more" than my usual fluffy dumplings.  The middle child, who will eat ANYTHING, didn't even make it half way through the bowl and asked for a PB&J instead. The youngest shrugged and said "they're okay".  Hubby liked them better than my regular drop dumplings so I guess it will be a trade off for dumplings in our house.  I'll just say to the family...STOP!...DROP OR ROLL????

THis was a HIT with all my little ones - they gobbled it up!  Changes I made were fresh veggies and 2 quarts of broth so it would truly be a soup and feel good on these sore little throats. Success!

It was really good, but I used breasts, cubed, instead of thighs.
Thank you.

I used fresh vegetables, carrots, celery, parsley etc, used Rosemary instead of thyme. Thank you thank you for not having 'can of condensed chicken soup or celery soup' as an ingredient. It is important for people like me to have real ingredient recipes to make food without msg. Yes, I had to find the lowest 'msg' stock available. Most times I just make my own stock, it's lengthy. Nice to see actual flour dumpling recipie that's not.... 'biscuit mix'. Yay! Might add heavy whipping cream and make this a creamy soup, we'll see.

This was different from what I usually consider to be typical chicken and dumplings. The flavor was good and it smelled great when it was cooking. I also liked the fresh parsley in the dumpling dough. However there was very little liquid in the pot to cook the dumplings in and the dumpling texture was very firm instead of the soft texture I grew up with. This is a very easy recipe and would be good for a single person to make. I don't think I'll keep this in my meal rotation.

My husband says this one if the very best chicken and dumpling recipes he has ever had! We made as it said to, but didn't have sage. I used poultry seasoning (as it is loaded with sage) and it smelled fantastic! Just the aroma alone while it cooked was worth it! Will be making this a permanent part of our favorites menu!

buttermilk substitute- 1 tbs white vinegar or lemon juice to 1 cup milk.  Dumplings are very good.  Broth is OK.

Used it as a base and made it my own. There was not near enough broth. We increased that a lot. I also used chicken pulled from the bones of a roasted chicken and we used fresh sliced carrots and celery. After the dumplings were done I added some cornstarch to thicken. It turned out delish and my daughter asked for it to be made for Thanksgiving. The dumplings were very simple and very good! We used bread flour and homemade buttermilk (from making butter) Best dumplings I've had in a while. I made small balls out of the dough and then squished them kinda flat. They turned out beautifully!

My family really enjoyed this dish and i enjoyed how simple it was to make.  I did not follow the recipe exactly since I used my own chicken stock.  My chicken stock is well seasoned already so I did not add the seasonings.  For the dumpling I did use a more traditional biscuit dough (with parsley) as I do not keep items such as self-rising flour in the house.  I really enjoyed this and I will definitely be making it again soon.  I would not suggest using bisquick or canned soups, but I suppose that it is my preference not to use foods I do not process myself.

The soup was a little bland for me.  I added just a little salt and that made it so much better. I needed to add more broth to bring it up to the top of the chicken and veggies so I could poach the dumplings. As for the dumplings, I didn't care for them.  I usually love dumplings but these came out really doughy and gummy. Next time I will add a little salt to the recipe and use my mom's old standby for dumplings, (pillsbury biscuits)

Hubby loved the dumplings, just wanted me to make more and make them bigger.  I made my own personal version of the chicken and broth and added a few things, but the main thing is that the dumplings were a hit!!!!   Thanks!!!!!!
