I like the complexity of the flavors in this dish and the fact that it's full of healthy vegetables. It was quite a production to make however (dirtied lots of dishes took a long time) so it's not something I would take on very often. And I think I prefer the final flavor of my favorite jambalaya recipe over this one. But this recipe was fun to try - thanks for sharing. I followed the recipe almost exactly except for a few things. I cut up the andouille before cooking it which browned it all over and generated grease which I then used with just a little oil to cook the chicken. I only used one onion because 2 seemed like too much (although when all was said and done 2 probably would have worked fine.) I had to cook the rice a lot longer than the recipe calls for: about 5-7 extra minutes to absorb the liquid and 10 minutes or so extra for it to get tender. I also added about 1/2-3/4 cup of chicken broth for the last 10 minutes of cooking the rice because it seemed that there wasn't enough liquid to tenderize it. Finally I omitted the poblano chile because I didn't have one.

This was very good. I changed the method a bit because I misread the recipe and I used the optional hot pepper (serrano) instead of banana. I had everything prepped and the only variation planned was that my meat was pre-cooked. I totally missed that the rice is cooked IN this dish and thought my precooked rice was called for. So I added the meat seasoning and a teaspoon of chicken base to the sauteed vegetables and heated through. I then added the peppers corn tomatoes/sauce and beer and simmered to reduce some of the liquid (no broth-just the aforementioned base since the rice was cooked). I added the rice for the last couple of minutes to heat through. Fortunately I had enough to add the appropriate amount even with my mistake. With much of the prep already done this was a one pot dish and a little less involved so I would make it this way again. It's pretty spicy to the point that I would not make it for company but it was perfect for us.

I am really happy I tried this recipe. I needed a good way to use banana peppers and this really hit the spot. I didn't use any Cajun seasoning and think the spice of the peppers is perfect. I broiled 5 banana and 1 red pepper and removed the char as suggested. At the same time I sliced and sauted sausage links. Took it out of the pot and sauted 1 onion garlic and celery added salt and pepper and then added sliced boneless chicken thighs and let them cook. Then I added the rice a large can of crushed tomatoes 2 cans of broth extra water the peppers the sausage and a bottle of beer and it turned out great. I might do less rice next time- it is a lot.
