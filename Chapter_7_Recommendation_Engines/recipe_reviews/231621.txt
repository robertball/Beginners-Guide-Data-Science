This is great.  I am kind of a spice wimp, so I was afraid of the cayenne but gave it a whirl as written and I'm surprised at how mild it ended up being.  It has just the right amount of seasoning for me.  The coating stayed on well when I fried it, and the chicken browned nicely.  I topped it with fresh whole milk mozzarella for a little extra richness - I'll definitely make this one again.

This recipe was the best chicken parm I've ever made. The chicken was ridiculously tender! Only thing I didn't do was put the pasta in the oven, I just put the chicken in the oven and then put it on top of the pasta later. Definitely recommend!!

Only change I made was to replace the half & half with whole milk because that's what I had on hand. Plus I doubt it would have made a difference.  Good, simple recipe that produces very tender chicken.  Add extra sauce for dipping crusty bread in!

I didn't follow this recipe exactly, but I stole some really great ideas from it! I like seasoning the flour with garlic powder and cayenne. It gives it a nice but subtle kick. I also love the mixing of parmesan, breadcrumbs, and panko. I like panko better than breadcrumbs, but it never seems to stick to the meat as well as breadcrumbs do. The only big difference between this recipe and mine is that I use homemade tomato sauce, and it just doesn't get better than that!

I made this following the exact method although I did substitute what I had on hand and my preferences (don't like angel hair pasta and had some home made sauce and another jarred sauce).  The chicken crisped up beautifully and I thought it would get soggy after putting it on top of the sauced pasta and with the cheese but it didn't and was delicious!  I will definitely make this again!  Would be great for an easy but elegant company dinner!

Yummy! I instead used 3 chicken breast and beat them with a meat pounder and cut each in half. I did not use the cayenne pepper and used more black pepper instead because my husband does not like anything beyond black pepper.

I'm basing my review on just the chicken.  I halved the recipe, but I floured it as written, crumbed it as written, and then just melted a little fontina cheese on the chicken in the pan.  I thought the chicken needed a little more moisture than just the tablespoon of oil that it called for, so I did add a little Italian salad dressing to the chicken before adding the cheese.  We had this with a good dinner salad, and it was perfect for us tonight.  Thank you so very much, Janice Tofuri!  The chicken was superb!

We enjoyed this! Absolutely delicious! I used wheat spaghetti, and I baked for 25 minutes. That was the only difference, Oh so good!

I used Gluten Free Panko Style Bread Crumbs (Kinnikinnick); and Gluten Free Seasoned Flour (Kentucky Kernel), corn flakes crumbs (Kellogg's) and Zesty Italian Salad Dressing Mix (Good Seasons) in lieu of seasoned bread crumbs.

It's the first time I've made it and I let the chicken get a little dark brown when frying (black in some areas) but the flavor was great, there was a crunch in the crust and the chicken was cooked and juicy.  It was really good, if not perfect.

I have my own way I prefer to make chicken parm as I'm sure most people do. I used this recipe mainly to try out the breading for the chicken, and it was amazing! so tasty and full of flavor! I have faith the rest of the recipe is amazing as well! highly recommend.

I went by the directions with the exception of my homemade marinara which probably is thinner than commercial pasta sauce. I added cilantro as a garnish. This recipe gives you lots of room to tweek it ??   Serve it with your favorite bread topped with garlic, parmesan infused butter. YUM

This is a recipe we turn to often. This recipe doesn't have too much sauce, as I feel a lot of recipes do. The chicken is always moist and flavorful.

We loved it!!! Instead of breading and frying the chicken tenders, I grilled them. I eliminated the flour, eggs, half and half, and bread crumbs but used the seasoning. My 7 year old finished his plate!!

I made this the other day for me and my boyfriend's anniversary. I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out amazing! Better than any parmesan chicken I've ever had in a restaurant. And it was pretty easy to make. He even took some of the leftovers to work and in the three years we've lived together he's never once eaten leftovers. This recipe really helped make the night special and I will definitely be making it again! Thanks so much for sharing it!

Very good recipe. I didn't add the panko crumbs  in the chicken breading. I also didn't use angel hair. I was short on time so I used penne pasta, but didn't bake.

Really good but time consuming. Also when I ate this I ended up in the hospital a few hours later, apparently it triggered a "gall bladder attack". And that's how I found out I had gallstones.
