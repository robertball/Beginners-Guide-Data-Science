I loved the ease in making these wontons and all without frying.  I sprayed them with olive oil and they browned up nicely and with a crisp texture.  It will be easy to modify this recipe with additional ingredients for your personal preferences.  Thanks for sharing!

It's so delicious and easy to make as a snack or a party appetizer. The hardest part was finding the wonton wrappers in the store.

I like adding green onions (half to a whole bunch per container cream cheese) and sriracha sauce (1 Tbs per cream cheese container. I also like dipping them in sweet chili sauce. YUM

Very easy to make! I made a variation with sausage, bacon, Colby jack cheese, and ranch dressing for the filling. Yummy addition to this year's super bowl party!

Very easy to make, but I need to work on what to add to them. Tried crab, (not enough crab flavor) chives,(same)and chopped bacon,(some people loved them, some not). But will def make them again. And btw, wonton wrappers are in the produce section. Duh, who knew? Best right out of the oven, but warmed up last night for a Christmas eve gathering I had to turn them over to crisp up the bottom.

We loved these-chewier than at a restaurant, but tasty just same!  Will definitely make these again-I ended up using 1/2 a block of cream cheese for 12 wontons, but that's how we roll!  Next time, I try placing the cream cheese into a ziplock & trim the corner off to make things a little easier.  Thx for sharing!

Husband loves these but can't have fried food. This recipe is perfect. Brushed with a little olive oil. Easy and delicious.

I like this recipe since it's very easy to make. I was having trouble because I bought cream cheese too much and this recipe pretty much save my day :) The only thing I suggest to make this wonton more delicious is to add another filling other than cream cheese(I'm using diced sausage), I'll be experimenting with another fillings :D

Just what we were craving! Followed the recipe and doubled it. Flavor was right on. We baked around 9 minutes, then low-broiled for two or three minutes to crisp the tops. Addictive!

These were a big hit around the table! I added some chives to the cream cheese for a little twist.

These were great! I added a little dried dill and garlic powder.
They were easy and quick as a new side dish. We all enjoyed
them! Thank you!

I've made theses a couple of times using Boursin cheese (herbed cheese) and they were a hit. We had them for the Super Bowl Party and I could have made twice as many, they disappeared very quickly. I made them ahead of time and covered the baking trays with damp towels to keep them from drying out. They bake very quickly. I think I'll try some variations for fillings next.

These turned out pretty good as directed. They don't have the"crunch" of a traditional cheese puff but they are still really good.

They'll do. Especially if you don't want the grease and fat from deep frying. Not hard to do.

These are tasty and so easy to make! I made them with just plain cream cheese and am looking forward to trying with some add-ins. This is a great way to use up leftover wonton wrappers! My kids loved them.
