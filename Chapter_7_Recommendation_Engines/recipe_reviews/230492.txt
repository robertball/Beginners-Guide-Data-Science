This didn’t tighten up as much as I would have liked so I recommend beating the egg whites & cream to stiff peaks. Other than that, the flavor was wonderful.  I put the chocolate whipped cream on the side and topped with regular whipped cream only because I thought it was prettier with the fruit I was serving.    If you find that your dessert is too loose, just place it in the freezer and tell your guests it’s a “frozen mousse pie”.  They’ll never know and it'll be fabulous.
