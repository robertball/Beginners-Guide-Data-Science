I made this sauce for party and used it on Ribs, Wings, and Pulled Pork.   It was great on all 3.   Only modification I made is using 2/3 cup regular French's mustard and a 1/3rd Bartmen Ball Ballpark mustard a Cleveland staple,   Don't know if it did to much with the flavor but as a Clevelander I use Ballpark Mustard in all of my BBQ's .   Great recipe!

Granted, the sauce was a little thin, but its just my family's preference to have a thicker sauce.  Had this with pulled pork sandwiches, and cannot wait to try it as a wing sauce!  I am so glad I made extra - I would definitely recommend this!

Delicious. I have heard about the BBQ sauce wars for years and always had wanted to try a Carolina style sauce. This was wonderful.  tangy and very nice. Will I give up tomato based ones? No.. sorry I like both styles but will make this style just as often as tomato ones now

Very easy to make.  Tried it on pork ribs and chicken, turned out awesome on both. I will definitely keep some of this sauce handy for other occasions

I love mustard and vinegar so this is right up my alley.  Very tangy, have put it on burgers, pork, and chicken.  Awesome stuff!

My husband has IBS so I was looking for a good traditional BBQ recipe that didn't use garlic, onion, etc. This has worked out so well for us. The only change I make is I  don't use the cayenne and not so much chili powder. It is really yummy and is one of the few replacement recipes I found that doesn't leave us feel like we are missing out. Thanks!!

Used this on pork spare ribs, I thought I would have to make another batch for my super picky 9yr old who likes a certain "sweet BBQ" store bought sauce. We ALL loved it, and the picky one said we need to make these again tomorrow. Made as written, except for liquid  smoke as we made the ribs on the charcoal grill.
