Okay, I just made these to top the Halloween cupcakes and here are my recommendations: 1)  After you shape the balls, put a toothpick in them and then place them in the freezer for about 30 minutes or so. 2) Don't bother adding the shortening to the white chocolate. I zapped a bag of white choc. chips in the microwave for 30 seconds...stirred...30 more seconds...really stirred and it melted beautifully (do have to stir for a while to completely melt the choc). 3) Dip the frozen PB balls in the white chocolate and gently push it off of the toothpick (push it up off the toothpick), after you set it down the choc will still "ooze" over where your fingers were. 4) I didn't bother with the red squiggles as it looked too time consuming. All in all it looks great!!  The boys really like them!

Very good recipe. I didn't change much, but I'll share what I did since I tried to address some of the other reviewers' concerns: First, I used natural peanut butter - I got a brand new jar, poured off the oil from the top, and used the whole jar (about 1.5c anyway). This results in a drier filling which is really easy to work with. When I blended it up with the sugar it resembled gravel, actually. I then added 2 cups of Rice Krispies cereal - I DEFINITELY recommend doing this, everyone loved the crunch in the middle! I also needed a whole 24 oz of white chocolate, I guess because I added to the volume of the recipe because of the cereal. I put toothpicks in them to dip them in chocolate. Took an hour to make the pb center and cover them in chocolate, then I refrigerated to set the chocolate and took another 15min to finish decorating.

These were so fun!  ONE complaint... they don't have any texture.  The peanut butter is really good, but is very rich, and the creaminess combined with the sweetness makes it hard to eat an entire one (which might be a good thing for me ha!)  They are much more "eatable" when you add something like rice krispie cereal to the peanut butter mix to add some crunch, or perhaps crushed peanuts (though I didn't try that... it just sounds good as I'm typing this!)

I LOVED this recipe! I pieced together quite a few helpful tips from other reviewers and I thank them for the success of these, I can see how making them as written would be very frustrating! Firstly, I recommend making the "dough", refrigerating it over night and rolling into balls the next day. They form easily this way and you don't have to worry about them being too greasy or mushy. Poke toothpicks in each ball and stick in the freezer for at least a half an hour. I didn't use any shortening in my white choc mixture and it turned out fine, although I found I ran out of white choc with about 5 eyeballs left, so you may need a bit more. Dips into the white choc while holding the tooth pick, allow to dry a few seconds before pushing the ball off of the end. You may leave a fingerprint or a blemish, but you can cover it up when you create the pupil. I used decorating icing for the pupils as well as the veins. They looked great, tasted exactly like a Reeses peanut butter cup. Will definitely make these again! =) Thank you for posting!

There are several shortcuts I took from other sources.  Stick the balls on plastic forks, easier to work with, stand them in coffee mugs and refrigerate.   I have trouble with chocolate melting so I used a can of ready made frosting in the can and melted it in the microwave for 25 seconds, took the fork and dipped it into the frosting can.  Eyballs were gummy lifesavers with a dark chocolate chip stuck in with frosting.  Red veins were made with red readymade frosting in the tube.  For the kids I used donut holes instead.  fast and easy. they made and ate them at the same time.

These are SO fun to make. And really great for a project to do with your school aged kid. Any "ball" candy will work in this recipe, even Oreo Truffles or Cake Balls. If you plan on making these to take to school and cannot bring anything with peanut butter, you can also do this with Oreo cookies!

First and foremost- DON'T SKIMP ON THE SUGAR!!! Gahh the peanut butter was a nightmare. I kept having to take it in and out and in and out of the freezer. About 2/3 way done I kinda gave up and switched to semi-sweet chocolate, didn't have to worry 'bout the pb showing through or staying behind. I ended up storing them overnight in the fridge and the next morning I realized, hey, I need more white choc. for the iris. Super. Good thing I didn't use all my squares yesterday!! I found that the bigger the iris, the better. The small just looked sad. The red veins really completed the look, although I wish I'd had used a mini brush rather than a toothpick. Overall though, they looked so cool!!! I really wish I could have taken a pic..makes me sad. This was quite the time-consuming project and I don't know if I have it in me to make again. I do give it 5 stars though because the idea is so novel I hope others will give it a go and hopefully like 'em. I especially recommend it for those experienced with melting chocolate an ddecoration. ~not me, clearly. Thanks for putting up the recipe though!! p.s. upon arrival at the party where they were intended for, some had cracked their chocolate, pb sticking out. Same with the buckeyes [[choc.]]. I think it's cause the mixture was too soft..

These were delicious.  I made them with natural peanut butter - it is thicker, so I did not have issues with them being too soft.  Also left out the shortening, wasn't necessary for the chocolate glaze.       I shaped them into little ghosts instead of eyes.  Mini chips for eyes.

These were a hoot to make.  I found the peanut butter mixture quite soft to work with, and instead of refrigerating the eyeballs for 30 minutes before dipping, I put them in the freezer.  It helped, but they softened fast.  Broke toothpick in half to have a bigger "drawing" surface for the red food color.  Oh, and they taste great--very creamy.

I was not so pleased with the outcome of this however, taste is still great. This is time consuming project so I did it in steps: I made the peanut butter mixture 1st night, rolled the balls the next night and the 3rd night I dipped them. I was doing pretty good till I got to the decorating part. Blood shot look:  Tried toothpick didn't work (hardly saw the red), then I tried the food coloring pen (waste of money) and then I tried an tiny brush and loved the results. Next night I went to put the blue centers on with the chip and guess what? The red food coloring didn't dry I had to pat the eyeball to remove some of the coloring. Now I'm concerned because if they sweat the red food coloring is going to come off on peoples finger....UGH!!!! So if any one can help let me know.

Just a warning...don't put regular food coloring in melted chocolate or candy coating, it will seize/clump up.  Use gel or an oil based coloring.  Have fun!

My family has made chocolates for years and a trick to get the chocolate to set up easier is to add a small amount of wax (like you would use for canning) to the chocolate when you melt it.  If you cut a piece around a 1/8 inch thick off the short side of the block of wax it would be about the right amount.  Also freeze the centers before dipping, and refrigerate but never freeze after the chocolate goes on.

I followed some advices from other users: I added some rice krispies to peanut butter and I didn't use shortening to melt chocolate. In addition I didn't deep the balls into melted chocolate but I put each ball on a fork and keeping it over the bowl I pour the chocolate with a spoon and then I pushed the ball off the fork on wax paper, certainly this method takes more time but is a cleaner way to cover the "eyes" with the chocolate.

This should solve the problem with the texture of the peanut butter: add crushed graham crackers to the PB mixture.  The graham cracker crumbs add firmness and also cut the sweetness of the sugar and chocolate coating.  Start with about 3/4 cup and add more if needed.

I HATE STICKY. I really hate sticky. and these are nothing but sticky...and cumbersome and difficult. They taste great. If you can get them to cooperate, they would probably look great, too. I could not make them look great. The toothpick idea mentioned by many is a great idea, but by the time I rolled the peanut butter eyeball in the melted chocolate, the eyeball began to melt as well. So - work fast! I did learn something - I don't think I like working with melted chocolate. We'll see if i have the same problem at Christmas when I make the thin mints (Mint Chocolate covered Ritz). So 3 stars for the good taste, but that's where it ends. I will never make these things again. Not unless I can figure out how to stabilize the shape of them so that they don't melt upon being dunked in hot melted chocolate.

This is the same recipe my mom used to use at Christmas. They are even better than real Reece's Cups!  She used semi-sweet/milk chocolate (don't remember) but they are just divine, especially right out of the freezer.  Think I'll do these for the Halloweeen party at work.

These were OK.  I loved the peanut butter filling, but I did not like the white chocolate on them. I will make these again but with dark chocolate.

We made these for Halloween. Careful melting the chocolate and do not add any liquid at all for any reason. Mistakes I made....my chocolate got too hot and I thought I would add milk to smooth it out. BIG mistake. I learned later that chocolate will seize if you add a drop of liquid. Melt it slow!! Once it is overheated you can not save it. I ended up using milk chocolate after ruining the white. We made chocolate monster eyes, dipping the PB balls partially into the chocolate leaving a peanut butter circle. Then we put a chocolate chip in the center of the peanut butter "eye" for the pupil. Was a good save for an already great recipe.

Great tasting eyeballs!  Unfortunately they are very time consuming (which was a given) and a bit of a pain, but in the end when all was said and done the family enjoyed them.  Thanks for sharing!

I am making these right now and thought I would take a break to write my review. First of all, I didn't have a problem rolling my peanut butter mixture into balls that others had. I did leave in the fridge for about 4 hours though. Secondly, this is NOT enough white chocolate. I have 5 balls that didn't get any. I melted my chocoate over a double boiler instead of the microwave. I'm not sure it helped any, but I didn't have any problems with burning. Also, I found it is essential to put toothpicks into the balls, freeze for about 45 min. and then dip. You can leave a little bit uncovered by the toothpick, as this is where the iris will go. I took toothpicks out before I did the iris and just did with my finger.  I put the choc chips upside down after I placed the iris on. I then drug a wooden toothpick dipped in red food coloring, for the bloodshot effect. OVERALL, this was a very tedious undertaking. I was exremely frustrated at first, but after doing the above, it got better. I would possibly make these again but only to share with VERY special people on VERY special occasions. * I am updating my review because I had not tasted these. I just thought they were super sweet and I could hardly eat one (I am a sugar addict!). SO, I just took away a star because not only were these a pain to make, but I didn't find myself wanting to eat them. Neither did anyone else in my house and a lot of these got thrown away. :-( But they are super cute!

I was not impressed with this recipe.  Even after freezing for over an hour, the peanut butter dough was consistently sticky and nearly impossible to form into round eyeballs by hand.  Perhaps a small dough scooper would be better or freezing overnight to solidify the mix.  Ultimately, I got very frustrated and had to throw out the entire batch.

Awesome looking and tasting!  I added red frosting to the bottom to conceal the pooling effect the chocolate had when it dried.  I lined my tray with crumbled oreos, lined the edges with gummy worms, and filled the tray with these eyes and the spooky witches fingers from this site.  I drizzled some thin red frosting over the whole tray to add to the bloody spookiness of it all.  It got a lot of compliments for looks and taste!  I will be doing that again next year for sure!

First candy I ever made and the grandkids loved it. (so did I). Its easy and has a wonderful melt in your mouth kind of texture. Its now an annual family "thing". I was a little worried when I started but the directions were clear and if you follow them, you'll end up making a hit!

Great recipe!!! Made for my halloween party and everyone loved them. A few notes: I kept putting them in the freezer in between the steps to keep them hard. When i rolled them into a ball I used the batch in sections while the rest was in the freezer.  Easier to work with. I also used toothpicks in the peanut butter balls to dip in the chocolate.  It made them easier to manuver. I just pulled it out before i did the iris and pupil. Couldn't even tell. I did not use any shortening in the white chocolate - just meltedi n microwave.

These are yummy! My boys really love them. I added rice crispies as someone else had commented on, and like they said I needed more white chocolate to coat them but it was worth it because they were so tasty! They're tough to handle (tried making some into ghosts too, that was challenging!) but do-able and worth the efforts!

Added rice crispies. A great addition to our Halloween buffet! I'm not a fan of dipping in the white choc, but maybe that's just me :)

These turned out really good. Very sweet though. Tip, make the cookies small. My eyeball decoration wasn't perfect but they turned out fantastic taste wise. A lil hard to decorate because the pupil was dripping and I couldn't get perfect circles but otherwise great and fun to make!!

These were great.  I made them for my son's class.  I didn't change a thing and they came out wonderful.  It's a little time consuming to do the red bloodshot look, but well worth it.  I would probably use melted chocolate for the pupil instead of a chocolate chip next time.  The chocolate chip didnt' sit like I had hoped it would.

These are wonderful!  I made this for Halloween and they were a big hit.  I did use a half cup less powdered sugar because I didn't want them to be over-the-top sweet.  They were perfect!

I just made these for an office Halloween party - words of advice.  The peanut butter mixture is REALLY soft - be generous with the powdered sugar.  Refrigerate overnight; I refrigerated for between 4-5 hours and had a sticky mess.  When making the balls, use more powdered sugar to keep the stickyness down.  I melted the almond bark on the stove (after killing two batches in the microwave - stirred every 30 seconds and still burnt it).  Let the melted mess cool a little - otherwise you will start to melt the peanut butter mixture.  I got tired of dipping and just spooned the mixture over the peanut butter mix, we actually liked how chocolate 'spread out' at the bottom making them look gooey.  Making the iris and the food coloring on the toothpick was the easiest part of these and everyone LOVED them.  I have to make another batch for a kids party this weekend.

For a simple version......mini powdered doughnuts do the trick ;) place a green m&m in the center and use a tube of black gel icing for the pupil in the center of the m&m. use red gel tube icing for the squiggly "bloodshot" effect.

OMGosh!!! These were the best!!! SO much fun. I can say, that these will be repeat offenders every year now for Halloween. My kids laughed so hard and found them way cool. And got told, I was the best! Shining the apple on my shoulder ;-) I did skip direction #3 because I had already purchased Wilton Spooky Eyes Candy and made a great stand-out impression on the treat and with my family. TY so much.....great recipe.

Labor intensive, but very tasty and fun. Made them for my 22 year old daughter's Halloween party with her college friends. Added 2 cups crisp rice cereal to the peanut butter mixture. Everyone said that made them perfect. I found that making tem smaller, using approximately 1 tablespoon of mix, worked better for dunking int he white chocolate. Oh yeah, I used vanilla almond bark and liked the way it got harder to hold the eyeballs together. Thanks for a great recipe!

It was the hit of the party. The kids loved the way it looked and tasted. It wasn't difficult to make. I did use white candy coating instead of white chocolate the recipe called for.

these turned out pretty good! They were fun to make, fun to eat and tasted pretty good too. I used colored marzipan for the iris and pupils and a toothpick to make the red veins.

Tasted good, but had a hard time with the white chocolate coating on evenly.  I used imitation-that was probably my problem?  Ended up with fingerprints on it.  Tried toothpicks and had holes.......still tasted good!!!

These are fun to make and delicious. I followed the original recipe and am satisfied with the turn out. I would have liked to have had a round candy mold to speed up the process and have a smoother eye ball.

This recipe was VERY time consuming! I had added rice crispy cereal to the peanut butter mixture and I was happy I did. It gave it some texture. I also learned that it was best to dip the balls in small batches because the peanut butter balls would soften and then wouldn't dip well. Letting them sit over night in the fridge also really helped when dipping. Everyone LOVED the taste, my only complaint is it took a LONG time to make! Allow more than 3 hours to make this treat!

these were so fun to make and give to the kids. i ground up 5 digestive biscuits and put them in the peanut butter to make it a little dryer and to cut the richness of the peanut butter. these are time consuming but something seasonal so definitely will do these every year.

LOVED the filling ~ tasted like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups' pb filling!! I happened to have blue fondant for the iris , red fondant for the arteries, & black gel (store-bought tube) for the pupil. Instead of white chocolate, I used the Wilton's Candy Melts, but it did not go on smoothly. Maybe the recipe's white chocolate with veg. shortening will??So I only dipped & decorated 6 of the 44-48 1 Tablespoon-sized balls. The rest I served as PB Balls & they were happily eaten at a party!

These came out soooooo cute. My daughter had a half day of school today, so I made all of the peanut butter balls and just put them in the fridge for a couple of hours, then we did the fun stuff. Be sure to place your mini-chips in as soon as you do the retinas, the white chocolate seemed to set up pretty fast. They do, indeed, taste like peanut butter cups. I already have plans for Christmas, just subbing semi-sweet for white chocolate, and sprinkling with festive decorator sprinkles. Thanks for a great tasting, fun recipe!

The peanut butter balls were mush. Mellting chocolate in  the microwave did not work out. I did not add shortening to chocolate, as chocolatiers tell you not to mix anything in chocolate when you melt it.

I made these for a Halloween party, and they were a BIG hit. We have several friends who have trouble with gluten, so I used crushed Rice Chex instead of Rice Crispies, which have malt in them. Time consuming? Yes. Worth the trouble? Also yes. Someone suggested leaving a "tail" of white chocolate, as if the eyeball had been plucked out, but I used red, so it resembled veins.

Just started making this recipe with my son. We've got the filling done so far and already can see it's going to go over well. (we had a small sample) Very easy and few ingredients. Perfect for me being practically kitchen illiterate. Greatfull for the recipe! Going to make ghosts tho instead of eyeballs...

I made these for my fiance's Halloween work poutluck. These were so easy to make and form into eyeballs. They weren't sticky at all and I recommend putting them in the freezer before working with them. The only issue I had was working with the white chocolate- I will not blame the recipe for that! I overheated it and it wasn't liquidy-velvety smooth. I was, however, able to save it and the final product looked impressive and tasted delicious. My fiance brought home an empty container- that speaks for itself!

I thought this recipe was good....however I have a few recommendations (some are similar to what others have said). 1.) I added almost an entire 3/4c. of graham cracker crumbs to give it some more texture--this will also help the peanut butter to stick together and not be overly gloopy. 2.) The eyes are VERY rich so keep them small. 3.) Use gel for the iris of the eye and black gel for the pupil if you want them to be more realistic. 4.) You'll need double the amount of white chocolate, no way does 12oz cover this. 5.) I kept stirring in 1tsp. vegetable oil into the white chocolate until I got it to be nice and runny. HINT: if you want the chocolate to be thin on the outside (which I recommend because they are quite sweet) the runnier you can get the white chocolate, the better! 5.) I just used red gel for the veins and scribbled it on...it wasn't perfect but looked fine. 6.) Use a strong toothpick to dip the peanut butter balls into the chocolate. OVERALL: Good recipe. Would use again, but make sure you leave enough time as they definitely are time consuming. Great for Halloween though!

Great recipe!  This was my first time working with melted chocolate, so had a burning mishap with most of the white chocolate that I bought.  I ended up making a few white chocolate ghosts, then a bunch of peanut butter balls covered with semi-sweet chocolate instead of the white chocolate.  I used the balls as a base in a serving bowl and put the ghosts on top.  They were all a hit!  I found that freezing the peanut butter balls really helps to keep everything from melting together as you work.  Also, be generous with the chocolate coating for easy handling.  Enjoy!

I made these according to the recipe. They turned out great and were a big hit for Halloween. I have tasted better an I have seen the balls rounder than I was able to get them. But, overall great recipe.

These were really good!  Everyone ate them up at my son's Halloween party.  I used a toothpick dipped in red food coloring to draw the veins on the eyes and it worked really well.  But the peanut butter was runny for me and I had to freeze it in order to dip them in the white chocolate. Next time I will make sure I've added enough sugar.  Very good and fun for Halloween!

I never have any luck melting white chocolate and trying this recipe wasn't any different.   However my inability to cook shouldn't  reflect poorly on this recipe.  First after I made the peanut butter mix I put them into balls with a toothpick in each ball and then froze them overnight.   I melted regular chocolate chips and then rolled the peanut butter balls in small batches.   After letting the chocolate harden then it was time for tasting.   Taste was very good and these things are addicting.   Will make again.

These were awesome.  I loved how they taste though you cant eat too many, lol.  I made them more terrifying by making a trail of white chocolate behind the eye ball, to make it look like the eye had been ripped out.  I know its gruesome but they were great for halloween!

This recipe was perfect for my big pumpkin carving party at work!  Yes, they were hard to make.  Forming the balls was a little easier if I kept 1/2 the mix in the freezer and swapped when the mix I had out got too gloppy.  I kept the trays of balls in the freezer once formed.  Used a toothpick for dipping in the white choclate, eventually covering that hole with the "iris".   I did them over a few evenings.  They came out adorable!  And WOW - the complements on how yummy they were!  It was totally worth the effort.

I am giving this recipe a lower rating because of the work it takes to make them! They taste pretty good, although I think the peanut butter filling is a little too sweet. I spent around 4 hours from start to finish on these. In my opinion, not worth the hassle, although they were a cute treat for a Halloween party.

These look great but are a true pain to make. The peanut butter mixture is so soft that it is difficult. There is a recipe in here for Peanut Butter Easter Eggs that calls for 1 cup Peanut Butter, 1 16oz pkg XXX sugar, 1/4 cup butter and 1 tbsp milk that was really easy to work with. I will use that next time for my insides. I also could not figure out how to make the iris. I think it wanted me to dip my eye in the white chocolate with the food coloring in it, but that didn't turn out very good. So I ended up painting the eye on. I used melted chocolate as the pupil and food coloring as my paint. I have three small paint brushes that were perfect. They turned out really cute. They were a HUGE hit.

Time-consuming but fabulous taste and look. My finished product is in the fridge for the last of the setting before I take it down to my son and his friends on Halloween eve. Definitely do use natural peanut butter - I had no issue with stickiness and the balls shaped perfectly. I used a toothpick to dip the eyeballs into the chocolate and then slipped it off before starting the next. I used a small paintbrush to paint irises and bloodshot veins. I melted chocolate in a dish over a pot over boiling water and did not need the shortening. I had no problems with this recipe - thanks so much for posting!

These are so much fun to make. We make Buckeyes for X-mas, but these are the best for Halloween!!  I used white almond bark to dip them in and it set up nice and firm. I also added 1 cup of rice krispies just to give them that extra something. I bet this will be a family tradition from now on. Thanx for this one!

Very cool addition to my party food, everyone got a big kick out of these! I used vegetable oil instead of shortening, but just because I didn't have any shortening on hand, and that worked out fine. Also, instead of waiting for them to harden and adding a mini choc. chip, I pressed a regular size choc. chip into the tops of the 'eyballs' as the white choc. was drying. (Pointy tip down so just the flat bottom showed) They stayed in place and came out great!

I made these for a Halloween bake sale and they were the 'stars' of the event!  They sold out immediately!  I was actually surprised at how gooooood they were!  A little time consuming but the end product is worth it and maybe the next time I'll be quicker putting on those veins with a toothpick!

These are so fun! The kids love them. I only gave them four stars becuase they were a bit difficult to make. I took several suggestions from different reviewers. I used natural peanutbutter, froze the truffles before coating them with chocolate and used toothpicks in each truffle before freezing to use as a little handle to dip with. It was still rather tricky. But, they turned out super creepy and look terrific. I will probably go through the trouble again next year and get more practice!

First off, I love this idea. Very creative. I did not make eyeballs though - I made mini pb cups. The only reason I tried this recipe is because I saw some reviews say they taste exactly like the store bought PB cups and boy, they were right! I almost couldn't believe it. Since I ran out of chocolate along the way I just stuck the rest in a lined pan and stuck it in the freezer to cut into squares later on. Delicious, but the mixture sure does soften quickly after it exits a cold environment. Either way, I enjoyed these. Made the cups to make some cookies and they turned out fabulous. Thanks for sharing.

This was a disappointing recipe for me. It all went well until I started dipping. I used the microwave to get the chips to melt but found that it was cooling to fast. I don't have a double boiler (try to find on now days!) so I got out a pan and glass bowl that was going OK but then it hardened up again. All said and done I got 50 quarter sized balls out of the mix (17-18 grams each) but only got about 2/3 dipped and none got decorated with the iris. I didn't take them to the party I went too but took them to our monthly potluck at the beach yesterday. They did taste gook and a lot of them got eaten. I can see making them again ONLY if I can ever find a double boiler. Guess I'll have to start going to the thrift shops once in a while. It is hard to give this a fare rating as most of the problem is from a cook that is  inexperienced with making candy. I'm giving it 4 starts for taste and originality but they were a pain to work with.

These remind me so much of my favorite peanut butter ball recipe, which is the same except that it calls for semi-sweet chocolate instead of white chocolate.  The recipe is time consuming, but worth every minute!  I took these to a halloween party, and received rave reviews, not only for the presentation, but for how delicious they are!

Just finished making these with my kids they are very tasty but way to hard to make .  We  ran out of white chocolate 12 ounces not enough. We got them all covered just didn't have enough left to make the iris.  The toothpick dipped in red coloring was very time consuming.  I don't know if I would go to the trouble of making these again.

Made these for a halloween dessert contest at work and I won!  They are not hard to make but take a lot of time from start to finish. I agree with other posters to putting them in the freezer prior to dipping them in the chocolate.  Thanks for the winning idea!

Very rich and peanut buttery.  I work at an optometry office, so these were a hit today!  A little time consuming in making, but definitely worth the final product.

maybe this should be re-written with all of the other adivce in the reviews (that I should have read). As published I think this is only worth two stars because: 1) the shortening taste terrible in the chocolate 2) the peanut butter balls are too difficult to work with and form because they are too soft 3) the chocolate only covered about half of the balls.

Again, after reading the other reviews that removed the shortening,  froze the peanut butter, added graham crackers, etc... I can see 5 stars, but really that is a completely different recipe and should be posted!

What a mess!  I took the advice about adding rice crispies, and that was a great suggestion. It was cloyingly sweet!  So I doubled the recipe WITHOUT adding more sugar, and that helped a lot.  Trying to coat the eyeballs with white chocolate, even after the eyeballs were refrigerated, was an enormous challenge and a mess.  But that was nothing compared to trying to put "irises" on the eyes with blue chocolate.  I ended up finishing about 14 eyeballs.  It doesn't matter if they taste okay, they are a holy mess NOT WORTH THE TIME!!!  And I was persistent!

Thank goodness for user tips. However, I wish I had used the shortening. The chocolate was thick and it took forever to set up even in the fridge. I also wish I had used the Rice Krispies because they were very sweet. They look good and I will make them again.

Was very good, i didn't do the decorating part because of time. Everyone loved them. I did actually add in a little extra vannila and i'm glad i did. I think next time i will use a couple more oz of white chocolate because i pretty much had a just enough maybe a little less.

Love, love, LOVE this recipe!  Made this for Halloween 2010.  Eyeballs were cute.  Also made little ghosts (used idea from photos of this recipe).  Friends called the ghosts "tweakers" because of the sugar rush - Ha!  Made this recipe twice...the second time I added some crispy rice cereal - nice.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I made these for our high school girls volleyball end of season party. Originally I was afraid that the high school kids would find them too juvenile but I need not have worried.  They were the hit of the dinner. As always I tried the recipe as originally written first and had no problems.  The peanut butter truffle set up well and after awhile in the fridge was easy to work with.  I did melt my chocolate in a double boiler.  It adhered easily to the cool truffle and I only had to dip each ball once. Decorating is time consuming but well worth it.  my only regret is that I didn't double the batch because they ran out so soon.

I found that the dough was too soft for shaping.  In order to make them easier to handle, I added 1-2 cups finely ground graham cracker crumbs to the mixture.  Not only did this improve the texture but it also more closely tracked the taste of store-bought peanut butter cup filling.

I probably won't do this again.  You need more than 12 oz of chocolate.  I agree with the previous reviews that said to add rice krispies.  The texture is too soft and too sweet.  Tedious & time consuming for a not that spectacular product.

These looked so cool, we had to make them. We have a non-peanut butter fan here, so we made rice crispy treat balls, (easier to mold when cooled a bit), and used a blue candy wafer, and a dot of black gel for the centers. We swirled in red food coloring to the leftover white chips and it was easily applied with a toothpick, they are a delicious hit we will be making for our Halloween party!

These are so cute.  They do take a long time to make but I found for the iris and blood shot veins it worked really well to put some colored white chocolate in a ziplock bag and cut just the very tip off.  This made making the iris/veins simple and quick.  Just a hint for anyone who wants to save time because I agree with others that you NEED to have the blood shot veins to make them look right.  Thanks for the great recipe for my Halloween party

I love the look of these however the texture inside was missing something.  I should have read the reviews prior because seeing that this was a common issue I would have added crushed graham crackers.

This was a really fun recipe. I had no white chocolate so I used regular chocolate  bark with Halloween sprinkles. Easy to make, I already had the ingredients, though time consuming. However, nobody really loved them. The Peanut Butter batter was much to sugary. It needs to be diluted with Rice Krispies or something else.

This was a fun recipe. I substituted the food coloring for a tube of blue gel frosting and applied it around the "pupil." Kids LOVED it and my husband loved it even more! Kinda' messy with the white chocolate covering the PB.

I dipped them in dark chocolate and they were good, but the chocolate was kind of thick...maybe the crisco thins it a little?  I left it out.

if you are extremely short on time, you can put peanut butter between vanilla wafers and dip in the white chocolate, then decorate the same, even less time? just one wafer plain in the white!  have had no complaints on either of those!

These really do take forever to make, but they are really fun. I thought the peanut butter dough was kind of soft and sticky, while I was making the balls it was sticking to my hands. I am not sure why but I ran out of white chocolate for all of the balls and the white chocolate started hardening very quickly. I don't usually bake or make stuff like this because I am not that great at it and I hate measuring my ing. out, and I know that's key in baking, but I would make this again. Oh the toothpick in red food coloring wasn't working for me so I used a tube of red decorating frosting. Took this to work and everyone thought they were cute but very sweet!

I used a lot of red food coloring in the peanut butter mixture to make them red inside. (You know, more realistic.) I used upside down full sized chocolate chips instead of mini chocolate chips for the pupils. I thought they looked better. I also made blue and green eyes. When you apply the red for the veins use a tiny bit on a toothpick and lightly drag it through the white chocolate before it has hardened all the way. Don't over do it or it will look really cheesy!
