Two ingredients are all that's necessary when one of them is a good, buttery avocado.  Well, maybe three...I added a few drops of lime juice.  Another tip for keeping the guacamole brightly colored if making ahead of time - press Saran Wrap directly against the avocado mixture to keep air from reaching the surface.

A true guacamole connoisseur knows the less you add to guacamole, the better it is.  If I have it, I'll add a good sweet onion and some finely chopped tomatoes.  Avocado, salt and garlic, that's all you need.

Definitely easy and very tasty! My husband isn't a huge fan of cilantro so I thought I'd give this a try. I didn't have garlic salt, so I used sea salt and added some minced garlic. I also added a bit of fresh lime juice. To me guacamole needs a bit of cumin so I added a little over a 1/4 tsp. as a personal preference. This was very simple and very tasty - great served with warm tortilla chips!

This was so good and was gone in about 5 minutes. The only addition I made was a squirt of lime juice and some diced tomatoes. Served with chips and made it along with the pico de gallo from "pico de gallo chicken quesadillas" by Tony Cortez from this site.

This is how I always make my guacamole and I didn't even know there was a recipe out there for it!  I know this may sound gross to some people but every now and then I'll add a little bit of cream cheese to make it even creamier.  But that's just me, I'm weird anyway.  :)

I was a little skeptical b/c it was so simple, but it was so, so good! I used a bit of minced garlic and coarse kosher salt. Yummy!

Perfect. I didn't change anything about the recipe and was delighted with the outcome. I served this with a side of pico, and thick tortilla chips and washed it down with a good tequilla. Excellent!

The idea of rating a recipe is to rate it as is. If you make changes, create a recipe of your own and rate that recipe.

I'm a little sheepish that this is all it takes. A little lime adds flavor; minced tomato, color; minced onion, crunch. Guacamole solved!

This is good...not my absolute favorite, but for the few ingredients it's great! My favorite tip is to leave the avocado pit in the guac until serving. THANKS! My friends thought I was crazy. ;0)

There are better guacamole recipes out there, but with many more ingredients.  This one was really good for only having 2 ingredients and was really quick and easy.  I'll probably make again when I am short on ingredients and/or time.  Thanks for sharing!

Not bad for what's in it . . .2 ingredients--what could be easier or cheaper?  I wanted a quick snack just for myself and I had an avocado in the fridge that I had sliced for yesterday's lunch of turkey avocado sandwiches.  Because I'd already prepared it for sandwiches, I had added lemon juice to it yesterday.  I didn't want another sandwich so I thought I'd make guacamole, and this recipe fit the bill.  I don't have garlic salt, coarse or otherwise, but I do have Kosher salt and garlic powder, so I added to taste.  I like very smooth dips so I used the food processor and it worked perfectly.  I think I prefer guacamole with a little more kick & color to it (I love the visual and flavor contrast tomatoes or salsa adds), but with lime tortilla chips it's great--makes me like those tortilla chips, which I haven't been excited about until now.  Thanks for the recipe.

really great and just as easy as it says!  the only reason i gave it 4 stars was bc i usually like my guacamole to contain some pico de gallo so that is exactly what i did.  i had a container of store bought "fresh salsa" (pico de gallo) and i mixed some in.  very delicious!

A very easy and basic guacamole.  I added a little lime juice just to give it some oompf.  I prefer a guacamole with a little more complexity, but for ease and speed this is very good.

Hey, I like a simple mashed up avocado, too. It can be very good but it's not guacamole. Guacamole is simple enough to make it if you want it. Call this a seasoned mashed avocado and you have something.

Okay, I'm sold. This is the easiest guacamole ever. And I was skeptical, but it was actually good too. I didn't have coarse garlic salt, just plain. Mmmmm yes, we will make this again. Thanks for sharing this keeper!

All recipes strikes again! Thank you, thank you! Thank you for this basic recipe and all the comments. I have always wanted to make my own guacamole but thought I would have to invest in ingredients that I would have no other use for. So I would buy the packaged powder guacomole mixes and add the avocados or would buy it already prepared in the store. I had no idea it could be this simple. I used avocados, lime juice, fresh garlic, salt and onion powder. It was perfect! And I loved the "pit" tip. Happy Cinqo de Mayo!

This is very good. It definetely makes a difference when you start out with a delicious avacado. I did end up adding lime. I think I still prefer it with my homemade salsa mixed in, but it was very good!

Quite good, and worked very well in taco salad.  For eating with chips, however, I added a tiny bit of minced onion.  Admittedly, I used salt and granulated garlic instead of garlic salt.

5 stars for east and fast! I can't believe how good this taste for how easy it was to put together. Recipes was great the way it was but I added a little lime juice to make it even better

I followed the recipe and it was amazing as is. I only used 1 alvocado though, and wanted it to go a bit further, so I added some diced roma tomatoes. Also, some lemon juice so that it didn't brown.

This is so good. I tried it for an avacado taco recipe on here. Warm up a tortilla, spread this mixture on it, and then top with cilantro and a little red onion to taste. It makes a very quick and filling lunch. I would just sprinkle on the garlic salt to taste though. 1/4 tsp. seems to be a bit much.

I used 1 ripe avocado, 1/4 tsp lime juice and 1/8 tsp garlic salt.  It was gone in record time.  Will make again for sure.

Eh. Good, but not "Amazing". Are they kidding? People are too easily 'amazed' nowadays, and I think this is just another of those times. I tasted nothing unusual or out-of-this-world here, and it would take *at least* that to get me to 5 stars, much less the "6" I would have to want to give something to get close to labelling it "amazing'. Sorry, this misses that by a mile.

Easiest, yes, but not amazing. It just wasn't guacamole to me; it was mashed, salty avocado. I had to add lime, onion, cilantro and salsa- like so many others did that rated this 5 stars. But then, that's not this recipe.

Good! I added a little more garlic salt as we were using this in Mexican Wraps, and I like the guac to stand out a bit on the tongue.

I always add garlic salt to any version of guac that I make (I thought everyone did) but a really simple idea is mixing in salsa.  It has all the elements, i.e. tomato, onion, etc.

This was pretty tasty. It is not a guacamole I would want with chips, I like peppers and onion and tomato in that, but this is a very nice guacamole for sandwiches! Put some on my turkey bacon sub and it was quite yummy!

This is the first recipe I've rated. I like to take recipes and break them down to their simplest components and then add my own extras. This is as simple as can be. I usually add chopped tomato and a bit of minced onion and it's always awesome.

I have been making my guacamole similar to this for years and agree that guacamole should be simple with the focus on the taste of the avocado.  I use garlic powder and a coarse natural trace mineral salt (like  Himalayan salt) and absolutely have to have a bit of cumin. I was shocked when my sister, who is such a great cook, said she uses a packet mix.  Great tip on the avocado pit.

My husband and I love this recipe! I actually doubled the amount of garlic salt because we had two big avocados. I added a few drops of lemon juice and some minced garlic. At first after mixing, I wasn't sold on the taste. I put it in the fridge for 15-20 minutes and then it was amazing! My husband doesn't really like guacamole, especially when it's chunky or has a lot of add-ons. He LOVED this! We will definitely be making this a lot! :)

This recipe is great for those of us on a budget.  I added a bit of lemon juice and cayenne for a kick.  It was gone in 5 minutes.
