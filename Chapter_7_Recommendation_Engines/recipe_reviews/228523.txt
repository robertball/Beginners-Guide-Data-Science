*Incomplete review submitted. Here is the full review. I give this 5 stars because it is an excellent “go by” recipe. I used what I had on hand. I rehydrated dried figs and crystallized ginger in some water and port, and then made the preserves from there. It is excellent with sharp cheddar cheese. Next time, I might add some jalapeño.

I read the other comments regarding the preserve to be bland. Accordingly, I left the skin/peel on and chopped the figs a bit finer. I did find it to be a bit bland so added 1/4 tsp. of ground cloves. Very nice. I used only 1/2 cup of sugar as well. It turned out beautifully.  Love the recipe and will make it again!

This was bland for us.  I missed the flavor that comes from the peel.  Texture wise it was perfect!

Smells and tastes good, but turned out very thin and watery. I cooked it over 20 minutes and it reached the 100 Celsius but I should have let it simmered longer.  Hope to use it as a sauce.

I used green figs from my tree...and left the peel. So technically I changed it. But the flavor was wonderful. I love the small batch concept.

I used 1/2 less sugar in this recipe and it came out perfect.
