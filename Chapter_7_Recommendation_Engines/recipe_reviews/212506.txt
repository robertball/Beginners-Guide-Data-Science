I loved this recipe but I had to make couples thinks different I used 2 pounds chicken breast , regular cream cheese (stick) ,3 tablespoons tandoori paste ,2 tablespoons plan yogurt ,1 teaspoon garlic powder ,1 teaspoon onion powder ,1 lemon juice ,cumin ,black pepper to taste. I used plan yogurt because it will help the cream cheese dissolve much easier .I refrigerate for about half day and was delicious.

Simple recipe that yields a very delicious tasting treat. This is an excellent appetizer for cook outs.   I do like to brush mine with Sriacha sauce about a minute before they come off to add some kick.
