I took the easy way out and made this in two 9" layers. Doing it this way made the filling very thick in between and made for a stunning presentation, especially topped with "Satiny Chocolate Glaze," also from this site, and chocolate curls. The filling is creamy, fluffy, not overly sweet, and subtley flavored but MUST be beaten a good long time to completely dissolve the sugar - 10 minutes would not be too long. I also would recommend refrigerating the cake before covering with the top layer to firm it up, ensuring that the filling won't squish out. Very reminiscent of a Hostess chocolate cupcake only far better!

The creme filling was good. I was pleasantly surprised. The sugar was very quick and easy to dissolve, and it wasn't runny at all.  I used yellow cake mix with banana pudding mix instead. Was very good. They are a bit messy though. Next time, I think i will make cupcakes and fill them with the creme filling using a pastry bag.

I made these for my daughters teenage friends for movie night. They loved them and said they tasted just like ho-ho's! I did add some powdered suga to the filling to make it a little sweeter and drizzled warmed chocolate icing on top just before serving. These reminde me of a choc Sundae Cake we used to enjoy at Shoney's back in my teen years.

halved the recipe and made 12 cupcakes, used left over cream center to make frosting, added cocoa and icing sugar to it, made chocolate curls on top, really good!

These were really good!  The only thing I would add is to pour chocolate ganache over the top.  You would then have a "Little Debbie" snack for a whole lot less cost.  I got 15 cakes out of a 9 x 13 pan and they were perfect size.  Very easy to prepare.

I followed this recipe to the T, with one exception, peanut butter. I added about half to three quarters cup of creamy peanut butter to the filling. IT WAS AWESOME. I thought the filling was going to be too runny but turned out perfect after it was chilled. Thanks for posting.

These were good, but nothing special. It just has the icing in the middle instead of on top.

I made these exactly as written, and my family loved them! They are not overly sweet, and taste better than the supermarket treats that are similar. The only problem I had was that the milk and flour combination began to thicken before it came to a boil. I didn't notice this right away, so the mixture was a bit lumpy at first. I managed to whisk away most of the lumps, but a few teeny solid bits were left. Once the creme was between the layers of cake, however, the bits weren't noticeable. A fun treat, although it was a bit time consuming. I also partially froze the cake layers prior to spreading the creme. This helped the creme go on smoothly, and also made it easier to top the treat without breaking the top layer of cake. Thanks for a fun recipe! My family will certainly demand this again!

This wasn't as good as Giant Ding Dong Cake from this website. Using Devil's food cake & more water than oil is better than this recipes Chocolate cake & same amounts of oil & water. The idea of making into bars was good compared to just a cake that you hollow out the center for the cream filling. I'll stick to the Giant Ding Dong Cake.
