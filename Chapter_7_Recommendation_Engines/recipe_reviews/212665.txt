Great way to use leftover turkey or roasted chicken.  To lower calorie count I used equal parts fat free half and half, and 1% milk. To make it creamier I increased the fluid to equal 1/2 cup.  Also used light Alfredo sauce.  I used 6 cloves of crushed garlic to heighten the flavor.  With the extra fluid it can be made ahead of time, refrigerated, and cooked later without drying out.  Next time I will try spinach tortellini for a different flavor.  This will definitely be a recipe called upon when leftovers are abundant.

Great recipe! I didn't have tortellini but I did have a box of bow tie pasta. I also added a bag of frozen peas and carrots. We all loved it, including my 3 year old grand daughter! This one is a keeper!

Everyone in the house loved this recipe.  It's quick and easy. The packaging of the tortellini I bought was bigger than the recipe called for but the sauce mixture covered it just fine.  I used Parmesan cheese only on top and skipped the mozzarella and it tasted great! I followed the recipe otherwise and it turned out fantastic.  I'm sure I will use chicken and other pasta in the future if the need arises.  I'm kind of looking forward to that!

Very rich and we generally liked it, but felt it was a little bland. Will try if again, but will season it up a bit. As a couple other reviewers mentioned, I think it would taste great with veggies added. We think broccoli, mushrooms, spinach, or even brussel sprouts would work well in this recipe.

Kids loved it! I used cooked chicken. Made my own white sauce with butter, garlic, flour, milk, salt and Parmesan. Topped with grated mozza, Havarti and more Parmesan petals.

Love this recipe!  I typically double the recipe and have used either leftover turkey or chicken.  I also add an onion, cooked prior in butter.

We really enjoyed.  No changes made.  I think I would like to sneak some mushrooms and diced red pepper into the dish.
Great as is though.

I used the spinach tortellini and my husband loved it!  I did not use the extra butter and milk.  I added fresh parsley to the top after cooking as well. If I do again, Iâ€™ll add fresh spinach - thought about it too late for this batch.

I made this per recipe. There was way to much butter. I also had to add more pasta because a 9 oz package would not have been enough to feed my family. The sauce was a tad to bland for me so i increase the herbs and spices to our liking I didn't add anything extra just increased the amounts. I also thought there should have been more sauce but only bought what the recipe called for. In the end my family loved it and said to keep it on the favorite list. I gave it three stars because of the butter and because the pasta and pasta sauce portion should have been higher as well as more spices.

I wanted to make this but had no leftover meat. I chopped the chicken and cooked it with the garlic and followed the rest of the recipe. It was wonderful and creamy! Will definitely make again!

Great meal.  I subbed chicken since turkey is more expensive outside of the holiday season.  Would definitely make again.  The kids loved it too.

This recipe is a must keep. My family is easy to please, but get tired of eating the same thing over and over. Made this for dinner and must admit we all loved it.

Loved everything about this. This is my second time making it.  I can't eat a lot of dairy so I cut the cheese down to half the amount and used almond milk this time around. I also had 2 packages of tortellini and used them before they went bad and used ground turkey. This is Fantastic as is and just as great with the tweeks I made.
