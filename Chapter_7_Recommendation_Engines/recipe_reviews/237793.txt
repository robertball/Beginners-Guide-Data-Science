Given the few ingredients and how quick they are to make these deserve 4 stars. The flavor was slightly bland though but this was easily fixed by sprinkling some salt on the cooked "muffins". I'd recommend adding in 1/2 tsp of salt to the mix. I also added in about a tsp of garlic to make these more flavorful. Mine took 20 mins to cook and they weren't very brown. Next time I'll cook them at a higher temp so they brown more (375-400 F) for a shorter time. These are definitely a good base for experimenting with different ingredients. They are rather small though so plan on at least 2 per person.

These had a good flavor but they need egg because they fall apart.

I really liked this recipe! I think I used too much basil but the were still good. I didn't have any Worcestershire so just used apple cider vinegar. Mine did not fall apart at all but maybe that was because I used about a tsp of flax. Next time I will put a little more feta. YUM!

I made no changes turned out well even though I cooked them too long. The reduction of the balsamic took longer than I expected. Also added salt and pepper before cooking. Perfect size for those of us monitoring out portion sizes.
