Delicious! I cut the recipe in half as well as the amount of sesame oil and used low sodium soy sauce. I toasted my sesame seeds as well and added them at the end - they give a nice presentation. I would have never thought of adding balsamic vinegar! It was a really nice addition. And, this is great warm or cold - but I prefer it cold as it really does get better the next day!

I bought a bottle of hot chili oil at the Asian market a couple of weeks ago, and had no idea what to do with it...then I stumbled upon this recipe and thought I'd give it a try. I'm glad I did! This was very good! I have to admit, though I LOVE sesame oil, 1/2 cup seemed a bit much, so I started off with 1/4 cup and thought I would just add more if I needed to. I didn't. I thought that that was the perfect amount for us. Also, I used thin spaghetti because hubby doesn't like angel hair and I added more green onions than called for. I served this warm, but can't wait to try the leftovers cold tomorrow. We really enjoyed the spiciness from the chili oil as well. I will be using this recipe again, for sure! Thanks for sharing. :)

People raved about this at a party I went to this weekend. I substituted julienned carrots and peapods for the green onion, added 2 additional Tbs of sugar (per another reviewer) and toasted 1 Tb of sesame seeds. Inexpensive, easy & very tasty...

Love the flavors in the salad! I scaled this recipe back a bit since I am only serving two people. I left out the hot chili oil because family members don't tolerate spiciness well. I used the angel hair pasta, boiled for 4 minutes then drained it and set it aside. I added 3T sesame oil, 4T soysauce, 2T balsamic vinegar but keeping almost the 1/4 cup of the white sugar called for in the recipe. I tased the sauce until it was the right balance with sweetness. I added the warm noodles into the sauce along with the chopped green onions and red bell peppers. I added more chopped green onions and a little yellow and orange bell peppers for color, texture and nutrition. At first the sauce will seem like a lot, however the warm noodles will soak it all up. I highly suggest chilling the noodles to allow the flavors to meld and come alive. Right before serving I sprinkled sesame seeds over the noodles for added presentation (see my picture in the photo gallery). A very colorful dish with peppers, green onions and sesame seeds. This salad is simply easy to prepare and flavorful. The balsamic vinegar is an interesting twist but it was not strong with all other ingredients. I always like the combination of the sesame oil with soy sauce and sugar. The sauce can easily be adjusted to fit your tastes. I served these noodles along with, "Hoisin-Ginger Beef Skewers," from this website and another tasty dish! The sesame noodle is best served chilled especially on a hot, humid day!

I have made this recipe several times now for potlucks and BBQs and it is always a huge hit! People continually ask me for the recipe! The fundamental revision I make to the recipe is to sub 1/2 of the sesame oil with vegetable or canola oil - so 1/4 cup each sesame and vegetable oil - otherwise the sesame flavor is too overpowering for my taste.  From there I like to add crushed peanuts, shredded carrots, lots of fresh cilantro and a little fresh lime juice to make it more Thai inspired....it's all up to you and your tastes!  I've even added ground chicken and pork to make this a main dish and it's delicious.

I have been searching for a good sesame noodle recipe, and I think I have found it. I was skeptical about the balsamic vinegar, as most Asian pasta recipes call for rice vinegar. I'm going to try this recipe with rice vinegar next time I make it solely for comparison purposes, but just know that it is delicious as is. The hot chili oil gives it just the right amount of kick. I usually order a spiciness of "3" out of a range of 1-5 in Thai restaurants. So if you like mild or extra spicy, you might want to adjust the hot chili oil accordingly. Also, I used linguine noodles, just because that is our preference. Finally, make sure you read the label when purchasing sesame oil. I grabbed a sesame oil "blend," only to discover after reading the label that it had other oils mixed in with it. I put it back on the shelf and grabbed the bottle labeled "pure" sesame oil, and reading the label confirmed for me that the oil was indeed 100% sesame oil, and not a blend. This is very good!

This is a great pasta salad for a picnic or cookout.  I used whole grain pasta and doubled the recipe for a large party.  I followed the sauce recipe exactly as written with no substitutions. It is very good cold so it can be made a day ahead, this lets the flavors blend as well.  I'd recommend adding the sesame seeds just before serving, it adds a little crunch to the texture. We also increased the amount of sesame seeds after we tasted it. One tip - buy the toasted sesame seeds in an Asian market or the Asian section of the grocery store.  Much cheaper than in the spice section. The response? - Three people at the party requested the recipe - so go for it!

Outrageously delicious!   A new go-to for pot lucks and picnics.  My gourmet grocery store sells this exact salad for $8.99/lb, forget that!  By the way, they use black sesame seeds.  I prepared this very closely as written with just a couple of tweaks:  I used a little less (about 1/3 cup) sesame oil,  a little more sugar (about 1/4 cup + 2-3 tablespoons, just kept tasting), added more green onions, a yellow pepper, thinly sliced peapods, and shredded carrot to the mix.  Served cold.  My hubby raved.  Definitely make this the night before if you can and toss every so often while it refridgerates.  Thanks, jkmom, this is a sure-fire winner!

I brought this dish to a family barbecue and it went over really well.  I followed the recipe except I reduced the sesame oil to 1/4 cup, and that was still too much.  When I make this again, which I will, I intend to only use 2-3 tablespoons of sesame oil.  Otherwise, it was fantastic!

I made this recipe as written and felt it was too sweet and that you did not need so much sauce. I also missed the flavors of ginger and garlic which some other sesame noodle recipes I like have in them. Sure you can play with the recipe and try to improve it but as it is written I found it too sweet.

This recipe has quickly become a summer favorite!  I also like to toss in broccoli/carrot slaw for an added veggie boost. Quick and easy to throw together on a hot day.

I made this last night with Miso Marinated Flank Steak & my family loved it! I added juice of one lime to the dressing to brighten it up and a teaspoon of grated ginger, because I never make anything Asian without it. Also, I used local honey in place of the brown sugar. To bump up the vegetables I grated in two carrots and added sliced snow peas. The great thing about this recipe is that you can add whatever vegetables you have on hand, and with your protein, you have a complete meal. Next time I'm going to add a tablespoon of peanut butter or tahini to the dressing and use less sesame oil.

I used soba noodles instead of the angel hair and left out the hot chili oil (didn't have any) and the green onion since I was serving this to a friend allergic to onions. I also added broccoli. This was incredible. The flavor combination in the dressing was not something I would have thought of but it was great.

this was delicious. I used rice vinegar (instead of balsamic) and added a little vegetable oil to make it stick to the noodles.  I also toasted the sesame seeds.

I scaled this recipe down to two servings for Hubs and me.  I used thin spaghetti and I cut way back on the sesame oil, using only 1 t.  I didn’t have hot chili oil so I used some chili garlic paste, to taste.  I toasted my sesame seeds at 350 degrees for about 6 minutes, until golden, which enhances their flavor.  I used a mix of red, yellow and orange peppers and just eyeballed the amount.  This was very good and we enjoyed it with Asian Glazed Chicken Thighs, also from this site.

I have always made the sesame noodles from the Silver Palate cookbook and everybody loves them.  These are just as good and a nice change.  I would highly recommend making them at least 6 hours before and preferably 24 hours.  The noodles absorb the "sauce" and the flavors meld.

I add more chili oil to the dressing and actually add more vegetables to the dish. It's VERY good. I never serve it warm. I always serve it ice cold and its perfect to take to work as I don't have to fight for a microwave.

Very, very good.  I halved the recipe, and when I first made it most of the dressing was pooling in the bottom of the bowl after I mixed the warm noodles into it.  Put it in the fridge to serve cold with dinner, and by that time all the yummy goodness had soaked into the noodles, and we had a perfect, delicious side to our orange chicken.  I'm keepin' this one!!

This is a tasty pasta that never fails to brings at least one request for the recipe.  It is super easy to make ahead of time and is just as good, in fact better, the next day, or the next, if I am lucky enough to have any left.

I used Udon noodles instead of angel hair, toasted sesame oil and omitted the sesame seeds, 8 green onions, 2 TBS. minced ginger and less than 1/2 the sugar. Also added pre-cooked shrimp as the last step. Very tasty warm or cold.

Fantastic!  It tasted just like Larry's sesame noodle salad.  We'll make this again.  The recipe was perfect the way it was; normally I tinker with recipes but this did not require any adjustment at all.  Thanks for posting it!

My husband and I LOVED this! I substituted the green onions for some purple onion because I didn't have any green onions and substituted the sugar with honey (just to be a little healthier). We added chicken too. We ate it warm, but I could see it tasting really good cold too as many other reviewers have said.

Love this recipe. Couldn't find chili oil so just used chili sauce. Perfect amount of spice and nice and cheap recipe! Can switch it up with different ingredients. Have made it a few times already!

I very much enjoyed this salad, along with everyone else at the family gathering! My parents and nephews loved every bite. It's also a great salad to make ahead of time and refrigerate. The only thing i added was an extra red pepper and more sesame seeds. Thanks for this delicious recipe

Lively flavor! Very much enjoyed this simple but flavorful salad. Easy to dress up or down, depending on whether you want it for a main, side, or light lunch. I could see adding sliced cooked chicken to this, or something along those lines. Add in some snap peas or broccoli - I can think of many possibilities!

This dish was a great side with our korean beef.  I left out the red peppers and added julienned carrots and peas, also used whole wheat spaghetti.  When I first made it there was a lot of liquid in the bottom of the bowl, after an hour in the fridge and a couple tosses the liquid was all absorbed by the noodles.  Just reheated for dinner.  highly suggest doing that.

This is really good, made recipe as written. I did add some match stick cut carrots for extra crunch. It does have a very mild taste, not too spicy.

A very yummy dish.  I only had a 1/4 cup of sesame oil on hand and it turned out great.  Also because of dietary concerns, I omitted the soy sauce (even though I really like it) and used a tsp of salt.  I left out the chili oil too and it was so delicious.  I added very thinly sliced small carrot slices, and some chopped red onion both briefly cooked.  This recipe is a keeper!  enjoy and share at your next potluck!

Really nice, easy, and inexpensive to make!  Like others, I reduced the oil to 1/4 cup and added more vegetables - asparagus, red bell peppers, sugar-snap peas.  Made with whole grain spaghetti, but will try it again with soba noodles and/or rice noodles.

Delicious!  As previous reviews have stated, I was asked for the recipe by a few people at the potluck I took this to.  I made this gluten-free by using brown rice spaghetti pasta.  I used matchstick carrots rather than red peppers... I think peppers would be better, but I didn't have any on hand.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I would replace angel hair pasta with Soba (buckwheat) noodles instead since they are far more healthier for you.  What's lacking in this recipe is more vegetables.  Add lightly boiled edamame (soybeans), water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, julienned carrots, Chinese snow peas as well as some chopped up parsley or cilantro to add some tang and crunch.  I agree about cutting back on the sesame oil.  Don't need that much.  Likewise I would not use Balsamic vinegar, but rice-wine vinegar instead.  This recipe has potential to be a refreshing summer side dish or meatless main course.

Very good recipe.  We like more veggies in our diet, so next time I make it, I will add more.  Great dish that has flexibility to be vegetarian, or add meat, and either way be a people pleaser.  My daughter came in the door from volleyball practice and exclaimed how delicious our house smelled.  I think we have a winner!

My 2 year old son loves these!  I have made them a couple of times now and tried gluten free noodles once--not bad for gluten free but the dressing doesn't absorb as well.  I also prefer the recipe with shredded carrot instead of red pepper AND I like 1/3 cup of sugar instead of 1/4.  Next time I think I'll add some chicken and make it a meal!

Excellent recipe - I used whole wheat spaghetti noodles.  I did not have hot chili oil, so I left it out, and let my husband, who like hot spice add red pepper flakes to his.  There is too much sauce, although some is absorbed, I used the remainder as a marinade for steak, which I pan-fried to medium rare.  I sliced it against the grain and served it over the noodle salad.  The possibilities are endless with this as a base.  Definitely a 'keeper.'

Like some others, this will be my goto picnic salad! I made it for a get together and everyone loved it. I initially made it as per the recipe but did add about a tablespoon more of sugar. I will be reducing the sesame oil next time although it was yummy, it's so versatile, next time I am going to throw in different veggies. Letting it in the fridge for a few hours before serving really let the flavors soak into the noodles. Very good!

I did not care for this recipe. 

I followed the recipe directly. The sesame taste overpowered all else and the texture of the oil gave the meal an unappealing texture.

2.22.17   Sesame oil is powerful and although many reviewers cut back on it, I felt it needed the full amount as well as some chili oil.  Thought the flavor was just a tad weak and I was looking for a noodle salad with a little kick, so I also added some red pepper flakes.  Flavor improves with refrigeration, so plan accordingly.  Garnished with some black sesame seeds as well serving with marinated grilled shrimp and an Asian cucumber salad.

Simple and delicious just as written, the only slight change I made was to cut back to 1/4 cup of oil based on previous reviews but aside from that I followed the recipe.  It can certainly be adapted with the addition of more or other veggies as well, carrots, mushrooms,  brocolli...I'll definitely be making this again, thanks for the recipe.

my whole picky family loved it....I kept it really simple.  Used sesame seed oil and soy sauce and a little sugar. I used small peppers, red , yellow and orange which made it very colorful.  Didn't have the other ingredients and it was delicious.  I also added small cucumber pieces just before serving.  And some peanuts! Gone in a flash.

I have made this several times and it is always a hit. Served either hot or cold, it is delicious. I added sliced chicken breasts to it once to make it a meal, but usually offer as a side or vegan dish for some of my friends who eat plant-based foods. If you use the right noodles, you can make it gluten-free as well. It is good in all cases and very versatile.

I added some green peas.  It was okay.  I would like to see a bit more zip.  Next time I will add some garlic and ginger.  I use 1 tsp of Sirracha instead of Hot Chili Oil and could have maybe added 1 tbsp as it wasn't spicy enough for my taste.

This was delicious!  My first time using Chili oil so I was a bit skeptical but all n all very tasty.  Took the advice of other reviews and used low-sodium soy.  I used a little less pasta and added in some fresh pea pods, broc. And pepper.  Will definitely be making again!!

This was delicious, easy and healthy - love it! Made mine with whole wheat noodles and used olive oil instead of chili oil (only because I was out) then threw in some Sriracha to taste & yum, yum, yum!  A week's worth of dinners for one person in 15 min. Love!

This is a good base and the dressing is a really nice flavor but its far too one-dimensional. There is virtually nothing to it but noodles. We added shrimp, raw bokchoy, some shredded carrots and more peppers and it made it great!

Absolutely fabulous recipe! My entire picky family LOVES it! I cut the sesame oil in half, added shredded carrots, some minced ginger, and substituted brown sugar for white. It goes perfectly as a side for our weekly home-made sushi roll night! :)

As written, I gave this recipe a 3 out of 5. The sesame is just way too much! As others suggest, the sesame needs to be at least halved. A little goes a long way! That having been said, the recipe has the potential to be very good. I'll try again with a few adjustments. By the way, it's much better cold, after sitting in the fridge overnight.

I make a similar one, given to me by a friend, but I use rice wine vinegar, add mandarin oranges or pineapple. Use rice noodles or buckwheat noodles and greens.

Great recipe! Used red bell pepper and julienned carrots for the color and crunch and left the onions and chili oil out (just because we were taking it to a gathering). I also used barilla plus thin spaghetti because it's a little more dense and substituted rice vinegar for the balsamic. After all those changes it was still delicious!  I can't wait to try it with the chili oil and onion!

I've done plenty of experimenting with this recipe, and I have to say that it is incredibly versatile.  There isn't much that you can do to it to screw it up and you just may find something that will improve it.  The one thing that I've found really works is using about 1/2 tbsp of grated orange peel.  It gives it a nice little citrus zing.

Made this several times already.  It is so much tastier than a recipe that requires peanut butter.  I used low sodium soy sauce and added 1/4 cup of sesame oil instead. Half a cup of sesame oil is a bit much.  This recipe tastes better the next day.

I LOVE this salad!  I thinly slice red pepper, green pepper and carrots.  I might try scaling down the dressing just a bit next time.  Even after it was all gone, there was a puddle in the bottom of the bowl.  Better more than not enough tho'.  Just delicious!

I made two batches of this for my son's teacher luncheon. I stuck to the recipe for the noodles, but I added grilled chicken to the noodles (after it marinated in ginger, soy sauce, garlic,brown sugar and dry sherry). I added the grilled chicken to the noodles and let it chill overnight. Noodles tasted better next day warmed up.  I was told that for the luncheon, one bowl of noodles was warmed and the other batch served cold. The warm batch was finished and cold one had some leftovers.

I reduced the balsamic and soy sauce (I’m on a low sodium diet, and I didn’t want my gourmet vinegar to overpower the sesame flavor) by half and didn’t add peas.

Delicious, but it made enough for 30 people (there were 7 of us). Next time I'll halve the recipe. I also added 1/4 cup of natural peanut butter and sugar snap peas since they're in season. A couple guests requested the recipe.

It was...almost good. Unfortunately, all I could taste was the vinegar. If I were to make it again, I would take out the vinegar and add more of the pepper and green onion.

Made just as directed, only adding grilled chicken breast.
What a great summer meal.
Made it the day before, and served it cold out of the fridge and we all thought it was fantastic.
Easy to make or, alter to suit your own tastes.
I'm keeping this one.

simple to make.  I baked some chicken breast, used some of the dressing (added minced ginger instead of chili oil) to season it.  Diced it, some snow peas, green onion  and shredded carrot.  Chilled, it made a great summer meal

It's lacking something. I am not sure what. When I make a bowl I put a little chili pepper powder and extra sesame. I use to order this where we lived at one time. It was a great summer dish cold. I guess I was expecting the same thing.

Made the sesame noodle salad for a potluck event and it was very popular.  I added shredded carrots, cooked shiitake mushrooms, and lightly cooked red onions.  I toasted black sesame seeds to add at serving time.  Received compliments on the dish and it was finished.  I did not change the dressing ingredients.  I think it is important to use a good quality sesame oil and balsamic vinegar.  I would make this again and change up the vegetable ingredients.

this sounded so good.  I made it as directed, but unfortunately, no one in my family liked it.  I was hoping it would be similar to the noodles we get at our local Japanese restaurant - not even close!  It may have been the balsamic vinegar that ruined it.

Cut the recipe in half, subbed thin spaghetti for Angel Hair pasta, and used all ingredients (including sesame oil) at the same ratios as written in the recipe.  Let it sit overnight in the fridge, then warmed before serving (we preferred this warm versus cold), sprinkling sesame seeds on top.  Very tasty (slightly dry, but in a healthy, flavorful way that we didn’t mind)...I would definitely make this again!

We loved this salad.  Since there are only two of us, it keeps well.  I followed the recipe but used less sesame oil (to taste) and minced garlic.  Definitely a keeper.

It really doesn't work for me as much as I anticipated at least as a cold salad. More flavor is needed.

I and my three adult sons and their families, loved this salad, though my husband did not.  He just has a thing against any form of pasta.  I mad the recipe as written, however I added some finely sliced carrot sticks the first time, and carrots plus some broccoli the second time.   Great additions.  I will continue with this recipe whenever I need to take a salad for a pot luck.  Thanks.

Made this salad for a cooking demonstration at my store.  It was a big hit!  Just enough spice for those who love hot but not too hot for those who prefer it milder.  Made it the day before to allow flavors to blend.  Would definitely make again.

I brought this dish to a small party and everyone was going in for seconds!  I prepared the day before, using thin spaghetti, broken in pieces.  Only used half of the sesame oil called for, everything else was spot on in flavor.  As others suggested, I added a good handful of matchstick carrots and broccolini mix.  Excellent flavors and will definitely make again.

MY family loved this dish and so did I. The prep was easy and the cook time was quick. I deleted the sugar, sesame seeds, and used Linguine instead of Angel Hair pasta; this was an oops, however it still worked. I added some fresh tomato's and used three green onions instead of one. I cut the liquid mixture in half and everything turned out perfect...if I keep this up my wife will get spoiled.

Way too sweet but it is easy to cut back on the sugar.  Otherwise, delicious.  Someone recommended soba noodles  (buckwheat) because they said they are healthier.  Well,  I don't know if that is true but if you are going gluten free, buckwheat (soba) noodles are the way to go. Buckwheat (just a name) has nothing to do with wheat and is gluten free.  They are delicious and often eaten cold in Japan.

I used vermicelli pasta and the veggies I had on hand. Julienne carrots,green beans,yellow squash,. I also added garlic chopped to my dressing. I used rice vinegar,sesame oil, tamari soy sauce. and red chili pepper. I let it marinate all day in the fridge before dinner. I couldn't wait to eat it. Yum.Also added toasted cashews and sesame seeds too top . So good.

Took this to an office party and it's gone! Great vegetarian Asian pasta salad. I got raves from my coworkers. Definitely a keeper! I didn't have chili oil so like another reviewer, I substituted 1/4 tsp red chili flakes. I was also short a little less than 1/4 cup sesame oil so I substituted with veg oil to make up the difference and a little dab of tahini. I also toasted the sesame seeds as another reviewer recommended. Came out great! Next time, I'll serve hot with chicken or shrimp as a meal. I'm wondering if I add a little peanut butter to the sauce, chopped peanuts and cilantro if I can make this go a little Thai?

I made this for Food Club at my work.  I followed recipe exactly.  It was amazing. You definitely need to let is sit overnight. In fact,  the left overs the day after were even better!  I added snow peas and carrots after watching the video and that made it perfect.  I used toasted sesame seeds and left them out for everyone to top their salad with.

It was perfect! Threw it together really quick for a weeknight dinner and not only was it a hit that evening, but reheated the next day, it was STILL moist and delicious. The oil kept it from drying out like many pasta dishes/salads tend to do, and the flavors were simple yet distinct. I’d definitely make it again in a heartbeat - no changes necessary.

This was fantastic!!
I didn't have chili oil, so used 1/4 tsp. crushed red chili flakes.
That is the only change I made.
Will make this again, and again.

SO delicious!! The flavor was out of this world, good. It was a hit at a birthday party I made it for. I will make it again, but I will be doing a few things differently. First I'll use a little less chili oil, or none at all. The one tablespoon was a bit on the spicy side for me, but I am also a wimp. Medium salsa is my max when it comes to heat level. Second, I will decrease minimally the amount of other liquid ingredients, as I felt it was a bit too drenched. I'm looking forward to tweaking and making again, to see how ti turns out.

The recipe is tasty but it’s just a big pot of pasta with some red peppers and green onions. Next time I’ll add peas and maybe some crushed peanuts or cashews.

I will make this again, we can't stop eating it. Could not find hot chili oil in 3 markets so that's my only change. Will order on Amazon and add it next time along with a few more green onions.  Better to make in morning then eat it later so the extra sauce is absorbed and the flavors blend. So good!

I have made this a couple of times.   I think this salad is Devine hot or cold and serve with the Asian chicken posted by another user..  I purchase the Blue Dragon Egg Noodles from Whole Foods and make entire package..  I run under cold water after cooking to stop the cooking process.  I also cut the sesame and soy down to 1/4 cup for each for my own eating preferences.   This is great to eat cold.  When having with chicken, I will warm up the noodles and they are equally as fabulous.  The addition of the balsamic is really a surprise and adds a nice tang.

MADE it HEALTHIER: Subbed Spiralled zucchini & carrots for the noodles. Blanced them for 1 minute to soften. Only used 2 tablespoons of white sugar instead of 1/4 cup! Thank you!!! Love it!

This was a great recipe! Instead of balsamic vinegar, I used rice vinegar. I added green beans and white onion to the mix! Any veggies would be yummy in this dish! I also added a few extra tablespoons of chili sauce to make it extra spicy! I didn't have any thin noodles but thick noodles worked just as great!

I give this recipe three stars as-is. It has a good flavor but was pretty darn sweet. Luckily, I was tasting as I was mixing and noticed before adding the noodles. To improve it, I added 1 tsp Chili Garlic Sauce (very spicy for those unfamiliar) about 1 tsp grated ginger and some garlic. (The soy sauce I used was also low-sodium.) That really "deepened" the flavor, some. However, I think next time I'll further improve upon this recipe by adding more veggies. I felt that was a little slim. I think some sugar snap peas, and chopped bok choy might take this recipe to the next level for me. As I altered it this time, I'd give it 4 stars. I think after I make it once more with more veggies, it'll be a 5 star keeper.

Delicious!  I used rice noodles to make it gluten free and added cooked shredded chicken along with red bell pepper and snap peas.  I served it warm on a bed of lettuce.  This is an easy to make recipe that was a great hit.

I used half the oil as people suggested, but found that I needed to add a little bit more sugar for my family's taste.  I added carrot matchsticks and left out the peppers (personal preference). I also used gluten free pasta. Really good!

I just finished making this... OMG!!! I could eat the whole bowl right now! I followed a few suggestions on here: 1/2 sesame oil, 1/2 veg oil (1/4 cup of each). I used spaghettini, as I couldn't find angel hair; I like the extra body to the pasta. I added a grated carrot and didn't add the chili oil (we're not fans of heat!) I've made it for dinner tomorrow night, but I may not be able to wait that long!  Will definitely make it again!

After carefully obtaining all  the specific ingredients, I was disappointed that it didn't taste more interesting. Furthermore,
 it was so slippery  that the peppers and sesame seeds stayed in the bowl instead of integrating with the noodles. Even adding chicken didn't make it better. Sorry, not a hit.

We tried it hot and cold.  It had a very good flavor.  I served it cold with basil marinated grilled shrimp from AR.  I thought it was a little oily.  It smells heavenly.  I will make it again.

Delicious. I have to make this for all office events. I add grsted carrots and bean sprouts for extra crunch. I do reduce the sugar about 25%. I also use high quality sesame oil.

It is very good as is, but I tweaked the recipe the second time by using others suggestions. I added more peppers, onions, sesame seeds, and added julienne carrots. I also cut back on the sesame oil just a little. Yum, yum!

Very yummy! I bring this as a side dish to cookouts and potlucks. People love it! The changes I make is cutting the sesame oil in half and I use siracha instead of hot chili oil.

This was pretty disappointing...I halved the sesame oil, per other reviewers advice and I don't think it was a good idea.  It came out pretty dry.  I will try again because I need some good lunch ideas, but next time I will keep the recipe as is.  I will update my review when I do.

Added onions to red peppers and sautéed both, topped with marinated grilled pork tenderloin. Will absolutely become one of those dishes with major rotation potential. Loved it!

This is a regular recipe  in my kitchen. It is very good. But I find the sugar to be too much. So I add a couple of teaspoons only.  Also the dressing amount is too much, which is fine cause i just leave the extra in a jar and use it again the following week if needed.

I made this for my son in law's college graduation party.  I double the recipe.  It was a big hit.  The only changes I made were to add about 1/2 cup of chunky peanut butter and a little minced ginger.  I will definitely make this again.

I thought this recipe was very good, I didn't have any chili oil so I just added some hot pepper flakes to give it some spice. Would def make again and maybe add some additional veggies.

This is one of my favorite recipes to make. I usually add a few sauted veggies (broccoli,  shredded carrot, zucchini ). What ever you like. I doubled the sauce, but use only half of the sesame oil. It  feels too oily if I follow the directions.

Absolutely delicious and so flavorful! It tastes great hot or cold! I did half the sesame oil as per other reviews. At first it  seems to have a lot of sauce but it does get absorbed.  I made it with Asian Glazed Chicken Thighs from this site. Very delicious meal, can't wait to make it again! Thank you for sharing, jkmom!

Just tried this recipe, and it is SO good and easy to make (and I don't cook often)!  I used buckwheat soba noodles instead, so if you try those then just make sure to rinse them a few times after cooking to get rid of the sticky starch.  I also used only 1/4 cup of sesame oil because I also fried up garlic and broccoli in a little sesame oil, and I also used a little less soy sauce (like 1/3 of a cup).  The balsamic vinegar is AWESOME, and the sugar takes out a little of the bite without dulling the flavour.  Next time I'm going to try more spicy ingredients...  Another great thing about this recipe is that you can adapt a lot of it to your tastes.

Such a great recipe! I made it ahead of time with gluten free pasta and added chicken to make it a little more substantial. Added about half a tablespoon of fresh ginger in the pan with the chicken at the end of cooking while it cooled and also added fresh chilli instead of chilli oil as I did not have any on hand and prefer the taste.  Will make the recipe again for sure me and the boyfriend loved it!

Loved it!  Used a box and a third of thin spaghetti and reduced sesame oil to 1/4 cup.  Definitely let this sit overnight so pasta absorbs what at first seems like a lot of dressing but is the perfect amount once it has time to sit.

This dish is one of our favorite sides. My daughter-in-law  is Indonesian and she raves about it. She always grabs any left overs because she loves them cold the next day.

I hosted a small lunch and came across this recipe. I used multi-grain spaghettini for the pasta, omitted the chilli oil (didn't know others tastes preferences), substituted honey for the sugar, and added julienned carrots. When making the sauce, I halved the original measurements, and then slowly added in a little of each, tasting after each addition until it tasted best. I am sorry that I didn't make more of this salad, because it was the most popular dish at the lunch. Will definitely be making this again very soon.

My husband and all four children loved it! I had to use black bean noodles which looked terrific against the red bell pepper. I did lessen the sesame oil and vinegar as suggested by other reviewers.

Huge hit at the BBQ we went to today.  I had 0 leftovers, and I forgot to take the picture for the site. My husband very sarcastically says.. Oh no! I guess you will just have to make it again.  Yeah, it was that good.

Delicious, but way too much oil, and I changed some things. I used veggie pasta, all of the ingredients except for chili oil (hard to find). When I added the cooked pasta it was drowning in the mixture, so I dumped out about half of it. For extra veggies I pan fried some broccoli and snow peas in evoo and garlic. Tasty, and today I have leftovers

Delicious!  I've made this recipe numerous times.  I've tried different variations with ingredient additions but I always add fresh minced garlic  and fresh minced ginger for the best blend of flavors.  I also toss in chopped green onions too. This recipe is a great springboard to add your own flavors and additions to.

This is my second time making this recipe, so thankfully this time I knew to cut it in half. There's still plenty! I had a half a head of cabbage left from another recipe so I tossed that in as well. It adds some nice color and crunch!

This is a good recipe,perhaps better if I had followed it to the letter. I used rice vinegar instead of balsamic and brown sugar instead of white, seemed more appropriate. It still needed something so I added a tablespoon of peanut butter to the sauce. Tossed it in gluten free spaghetti noodles. Served it cold at a picnic, everybody loved it. Definitely go with the toasted sesame seeds

My entire family loved this recipe!  I had mixed the dressing a day in advance, and had the veggies diced and ready to go, so when it came time to serve, it was quick to throw together.  Next time I make this, I will make it completely a day ahead.  Our left overs were just as good, or better than the first time.

I love making this! The only thing I change is only adding a splash of the vinegar and 1 tablespoon of sugar. I make it the day before I plan on eating it so that all the flavors have a chance to meld together.

This was really good.  Could have used 1 1/2 pounds of pasta and would have had enough sauce.  Added shredded carrot.

Loved it, but modified it in a few ways. Replaced angel hair with rice noodles. Replaced balsamic vinegar with rice vinegar (because it's more Asian). Didn't have chili oil so used hot sauce. Reduced sugar by half. Topped with cucumber, but didn't mix it in since the cucumber would get soggy overnight. It was perfect!

I have tried various recipes from the TV Chef's including Ina Garten whom I adore... unfortunately, none of them compare to this recipe.  I'm giddy!  I sub'd brown sugar in place of white, and added some honey for a creamier sauce.  Add the sauce SLOWLY allowing the pasta to absorb it - rather than just puddle at the bottom.  I added julienned carrots as another poster advised and tada!!  Wow; the BEST EVER Sesame Noodle dish!!!  Thanks jkmom - don't know where you got this one but it's a definite keeper!

My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this salad.  Found there was too much oil and soy sauce so will use less next time.  Also, will add more green onions as we really like them. Maybe add something green, just for color and a little crunch. Certainly went together quickly and look forward to making this again!

This salad is always a big hit. I served it at our NYE party and the entire bowl was gone! It's sooo good cold. I have not tried it warm. If you plan to serve it cold, let it marinate in the fridge for an hour or so before serving.

I accidentally used Worcestershire Sauce instead of soy sauce, but I used soba noodles, doubled the veges, and halved the noodles. I'm sure the soy sauce would have saved it. Don't try it with the Worcestershire sauce!

I made this because I was craving something Asian.  It was quick and easy but the sauce wasn't exactly my taste.  It was good though, but not excellent.
