BIG hit with the kids and frankly, a lot easier than the usual s'mores...not to mention, it's stinkin' hot here in Texas (July) and this as a "cooler" treat for the summer. Win-win. We are entertaining our great-nephews and they requested these again the next night and declared them their favorite dessert. One preferred chocolate graham crackers/choc mint ice cream and the other used regular graham crackers and cookies and cream ice cream. The 2nd time, they didn't even want me to melt the chocolate. 5 stars from Aunt Mary for an easy dessert and 5 stars from the kids because it was fun and yummy.

So easy and so good!!! The grill gives the cookie and chocolate a nice flavor. Difficult just to eat one sandwich.I used the original Hershey's chocolate bar and vanilla ice-cream. Delicious!!!

This was a yummy twist on regular s'mores.  I used vanilla coconut ice cream.  Very messy but good!

We made this at a family get together.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe and everyone loved it. Using the grill  gave the graham cracker a really good flavor, that would be lost using  a toaster oven or oven.  Highly recommend this recipe.

This is a great summer treat! The toasted graham cracker with the chocolate was fantastic. We used pistachio ice cream and it was divine! My sister is asking that we make this again tonight.

The flavor of the toasted graham cracker was something I had never experienced and it's GREAT! It's nothing like a s'more or ice cream sandwich. It a yummy mess!! Great for kids and adults with no mess on the grill or making of a fire.

Loved this and super easy!  We used vanilla graham crackers, Ghiradelli salted caramel chocolates, and homemade vanilla ice cream. These were so yummy and a nice twist for a dessert off the grill.
