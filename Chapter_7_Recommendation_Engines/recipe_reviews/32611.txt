Good starter recipe. I used frozen yogurt and increased the coffee and cocoa powder. Next time, I will increase the ingredients (as one serving here is like....really small--I like my coffee beefy and I'll tell you, I added the frozen yogurt and the small amount of coffee called for and my blender actually laughed at me. Could be because I have a wimpy blender, I really don't know) and I might use my pre-made bulk dry cocoa mix. This was quick to throw together with on hand ingredients when I want a blended coffee but don't want to drive to Starbucks and it's easily bendable to make your own, however you want. I appreciated it, that's for sure. Noone wants to see me in my jammies at Starbucks. ;)

Wow - smooth and creamy!  I made these last night and they are so good, but I made 4 times the recipe for two people.  Now way you could get away with only one scoop of vanilla ice cream for one serving - not with my husband anyway!  I topped these with some whipped cream and shaved chocolate.

Yum. This is a good recipe - though a bit stingy on the serving. Andrea must be thin. ;) I made about 8x the recipe for the 3 guys (and then I sneaked sipped off theirs - ha!), added whipped cream and sprinkles for fun. Thanks for the recipe!

I LOOOOOVE COFFEE! That's one of the reasons why I love this recipe. I added a bit more ice cream, and it turned out great! I love my drinks nice and thick. Thanks.

This recipe does taste good. I served it in a Frappuccino bottle and my boyfriend thought it was one. I noticed, though, that "1 serving" only makes a little less than half a cup, so you may want to double or even tripple the recipe. Other than that, great!

No way was this going to make a single serving for me, so ended up using about 1/4 or 1/3 cup of coffee and ice cream and cocoa to taste and texture. It really does taste pretty good though, somewhat similar to a jamocha shake from Arby's.

after reading other reviews, i made 6 servings for 2 people (probably should have gone with 8 servings for 2) I used vanilla flavored coffee and it was to die for :)  i think next time i make it, i'll try using fat free frozen yogurt and drink the entire 8 servings by myself, haha!

This was way too watery and would need too many modifications to rate it higher than a one. I would not make it again.

I had one scoop of ice cream left and some leftover coffee so I made the recipe as written and was pleased with the delicious flavor and creamy consistency. Took no time to make, so even though it made the tiniest amount, I was glad I tried it. From now on, I'll at least double the recipe to make one serving.

Absolutely love this, just the way it is! But I think 5-6 servings is the right amount for one person!

Excellent! But I had to double the recipe and still got a small serving, about 4-5 ounces. I added one packet of Truvia and topped it off with whipped cream.

I didn't much care for this one. I used a pretty strong coffee and the only change I made was using 1/2 the fat chocolate ice cream. I figured it would give it more of a mocha taste. It kind of tasted like melted ice cream with strong coffee poured in. It didn't really transform itself into anything more than the ingredients. I did finish it all, it just needed ice or something else to make it thicker I think.

I tripled the recipe for one serving-- yum! With whipped cream and a sprinkling of cocoa on top, my husband asked if he were at a coffee house! (I think I might double the cocoa powder next time.)

I agree with the reviewer that said it tastes kind of like an Arby's Jamoca, which I love!  My husband said it's actually better!  Thanks!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I doubled the amount per serving.  
I'm drinking it right now, as I am typing!

This is similar to another recipe that I use. Pour that leftover coffee in your old ice cube trays. Using frozen coffee will help thicken the drink instead of adding a lot more ice cream or yogurt.
