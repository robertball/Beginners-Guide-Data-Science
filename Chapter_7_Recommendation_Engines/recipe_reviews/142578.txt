This was very good and easy.  I don't know if the 2 cups of water is for the rice. I didn't think so since it said cool rice according to package directions. I made it as stated except I had my own sweet and sour sauce.  I also had fresh pineapple waiting to be used.  A nice recipe.  Should be good with chicken, too.
