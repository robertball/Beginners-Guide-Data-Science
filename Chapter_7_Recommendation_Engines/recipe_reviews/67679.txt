I chose the combination of cantaloupe and strawberries. At first, it tasted a little bit odd with the cantaloupe but definately got better after it sat for a few minutes. Just eyeballed the lime juice and honey.

This is the best fruit salad I've had......and it's just great that it's so easy to prepare and has such a delicious taste....(I make it with honeydew and blueberries)...
