I really liked this. I also used fresh turmeric, about 1/2" since I only made half the recipe. I did add 1 packet of Splenda and both my banana and mangoes were frozen.

Delicious. I used fresh turmeric, using a one-inch piece. Thank you for the recipe.

Nice simple smoothie. I added a bit of cinnamon to it as well.
