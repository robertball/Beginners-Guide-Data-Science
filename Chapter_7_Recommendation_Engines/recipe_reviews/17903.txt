This is a wonderful quick and versatile recipe! I had fun building it with the ingredients I had on hand. I used cabbage on the bottom (yummy cooked in the meat juices) spinach red onion potato and baby bellas on top. I used olive oil on the bottom and poured a little more on top. Salt and black pepper and a little hot sauce completed the picture. An hour at 425f in the oven was perfect! I'll be making this again with different ingredients and spices. Thanks for a great idea!

Love this recipe. Easy to personalize to individual taste. I add dots of butter and a few sprinkles of French Onion Soup mix. You can even do these in the oven at 350 degrees for about an hour.

These were okay. They'd be very appropriate on a camping trip cook-out. I do think they need a little extra seasoning though. They're pretty bland as-is. They could use some garlic. A couple slices of jalapeno would spice them up nicely too.

I'm giving this 4 stars simply because my husband liked this dish even though I'd had to doctor it a lot to give it flavor. S & P on its own isn't enough. Added Garlic Pepper. Also spread 2 tbsp honey mustard over the top of each pkg and cooked for an additional 10 minutes.

Changed the ingredients but it's a quick and easy meal in a pouch. I used summer sausage potato peppers onions and onion.

For the first time EVER my entire family LOVED this! Even my husband who is VERY picky:-) We just added some shredded cheese right before we ate it. My 2 year old cleaned her plate first! Next time may have to try some portebello mushrooms.

This is a really versatile 'hobo' dinner that can be tweaked to your own tastes.  Loved the cabbage and the color it adds to the dish.  We followed the recipe with a few minor changes.  First, instead of just using a leaf of cabbage, we cut 1/4" slices and 'sandwiched' the other ingredients between them.  We also sliced the potatoes into rounds instead of dicing and used shredded carrots and peas so that everything layered together easily.  Plus a little pad of butter and extra seasonings along with some fresh chopped parsley.  Turned out great!  This is our new way of building tinfoil dinners.  Thanks!  PS - 20 mins on each side was perfect.
