Made for a party and everyone loved it. Even the picky eaters!

 I also made a few changes, adding 2 cloves of garlic, a spiralized onion, substituting bacon for pancetta, using Parmesan cheese only (to whisk with eggs & to finish), and only used 2 whole eggs.

The egg mixture wouldnâ€™t cook through after you remove it from the heat.  Also, the pancetta made it much too salty to eat.

it was horrible. Sorry, that's the only thing I can think to say. No one in my house liked it. I have used Zoodles in lots of recipes, so it wasn't that. This dish just isn't Carbonara. We added Shrimp to the dish also, but the taste and texture was just off.

This is an excellent recipe and so good. I did add a few ingredients, I used bacon and cooked the zoodles in the bacon fat, I also added a couple tablespoons of neufchatel cheese and peas at the end. I've made this several times and everyone has loved it.

I have been looking for a new way to use zoodles and this was delicious and easy! I followed the recipe as is but added some minced garlic. I used two small zucchinis for myself and boyfriend, however, I think next time I will use 3-4. Thanks for sharing!

First, I will say that I have never had carbonara before, so when I made this recipe, I had to seriously think about eating it because of the eggs. After letting the egg cook a little bit as the pan cooled, I felt a little better. My husband tried it first and we'll, he liked it. Then I took a taste and it wasn't bad.

When I made it, I didn't have pancetta, so I used bacon instead. I also didn't have the recommended cheese on hand and used some local cheese with the egg mixture. I didn't add the parmesan at the end, but instead added salt. I saw another reviewer added onions to the dish which was a great idea (since we love squash with onions anyways), but forgot to add the garlic. It turned out great. The one thing that I didn't like about it was that I had to drain the water from the squash after it's cooked (pre-salting the squash didn't work for me either), but other than that it turned out well.

This didn't turn out for me, but my Zoodles didn't Zoodle so I had to use my food processor for the zucchini.  Even so, it wasn't very good:(

I used more than the recommended pancetta and it become way too salty. Will definitely try again!
