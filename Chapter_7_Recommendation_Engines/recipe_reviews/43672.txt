These were very good, but milder than I expected.   The crab flavor was really what came through.  This was just about the best crab cake recipe I've found, but if I make it again, I'll probably add a little more ginger (I like enough fresh ginger to give my food heat) and maybe a touch of fresh crushed garlic.

Hands down the best I've ever ever ever tasted (and I lived in the Northeast where there are a LOT of crabcakes eaten, hehe).  This is THE kind of food we like...traditional dishes with a slight twist not so overpowerful that it obscures the original flavor intended.  In this case, the crab flavor mixes wonderfully with the slighty more than subtle taste of ginger..and the aftertaste of the ginger lingers in your mouth.   If you do not like ginger, you will not like this recipe.  If you like adventurous recipes, you will like this.  Be certain to use fresh ginger, NOT ginger spice.  The only other hint is to cut down on mayo just a bit.  Otherwise, the same old advice about not handling the cakes too much applies, as they easily break apart.  (I held the patty in one hand and used the other to cover it with egg, then breading.  Gets to be a mess, but would rather have a mess than broken patties).  Thanks, Dakota, for this WONDERFUL keeper!

Ginger is critical to this recipe.  It was a complete hit, but since my family likes spice, I added extra ginger.  Take care in turning tthe cakes as they are very fragile until turned at least once.

I had a recipe like this, so was glad to find this but changed it a bit to be more as I remembered. You CAN cut the mayo in 1/2. It CAN handle a bit more cilantro. I used canned crabmeat. For me - that's fine. I used 3 cans once and 2 another time. They were slightly smaller and made only a few less. I got about a dozen hamburger sized cakes with 3 cans. GRATE The Ginger to maximize the flavor and omit chunks!! The big change is that I beat the eggs and added panko bread crumbs right into the mix. You can add even more bread crumbs to stretch the recipe a bit more without losing flavor. This keeps it together well and I think allows for the canned crabmeat better. Certainly easier to cook up. I don't usually leave feedback when I change up a recipe so much, but I was hoping it might be found helpful. Now to find the sweet cream sauce that went with the original recipe I had!!

This was great!  All the reviews were accurate.   I made it with 16oz of fresh crab meat and a little less mayo. I chopped up some pickeled ginger instead of the grated.   I added a little cracked red pepper and hot sauce for a little more kick.   I made them in my hands as one reviewer suggested...worked perfectly.  I made about 8 patties that were small hamberger size. I shared these with a good friend who loved them and I will definitely cook this again to impress guests.  The leftovers were gold.

Pretty good.  I will definately try this again.  Although I will cut down on the mayo a little bit.  They do also need "something else"...I'm not sure what yet.  Maybe more hot sauce.  I will play around with it.  I also regret frying them instead of broiling.  They soaked up a lot of oil.

Pretty darn good, but I made some changes.  I cut down on the crumbs and mayo, because I am from Maryland and we don't like too much filler in our crab cakes.  I also used only one egg, and that seemed to work fine.  The only addition I made was to add a clove of garlic.  Overall, I would say this is pretty good and easy.  Next time I will either use pre-crushed ginger to avoid biting into bits of it, or just leave the ginger out altogether.  I love ginger, but I don't think it was quite what I wanted in a crab cake.  Also, I will add extra sauce next time (I used Pickapeppa sauce) to give it more flavor and kick.

Wow these are definitely the best I have ever made! Also they are Fancy restaurant quality! I made a yogurt sauce with lime and more cilantro as my husband likes sauces. Also as I was dipping the cakes in the egg/bread crumb mixture I patted an ever so slight amount into the cake thus holding it together better. I also used french bagette for the crumbs and served the leftover cakes (it was just the two of us) on toasted bagette the next day for lunch. Fantastic recipe!!

These crab cakes were delicious!  Fresh tasting with all of the ginger, cilantro and lime.  The green onions make it perfect.  I served these for New Years Day Dinner and they were a hit.  I used about a 1/4 cup of chopped fresh cilantro because we like the herb but otherwise everthing else was perfect.

Love the lime and ginger, but too much mayonnaise.  Next time, I will only use 1-2 Tbsp of mayo, 1 egg and add fresh garlic.

These were fantastic. I didn't have mayonnaise, so I used 2 tbsp of tartar sauce (1/2 cup seemed way overboard). I also included breadcrumbs in the mix as I used canned crab, and found it too moist, even after draining. Make sure you have the heat med-high to ensure a nice crust. Will absolutely make again!

This is shockingly tasty.  Next time I will add a bit less mayo, since mine were a bit hard to handle from too much moisture.  No complaints on the flavor though.  The ginger went with the crab beautifully.  I kept experiencing new flavors in each bite.  I served these on hard rolls with lettuce and a sauce I made from low fat mayo, sriracha (thai hot pepper sauch), lime, ginger, and a dash of sugar.  Will definitely make this again.

I really liked the extra kick the ginger gave, these were probably some of the best that I've ever made by myself.  I also broiled them, came out great.

5 stars for the base recipe...however, I used, 1 - 6oz pkg lump crab & 1 - 6 oz can white crab meat (squeezed dry). If you don't have fresh ginger to grate, I use a pre-jarred fresh ginger paste sold in a small glass jar. I didn't have cilantro but wish I had. I also added a tsp finely grated lime peel w/the lime juice. Subbed bread crumbs with crushed up Panko. Instead of eggs, used 1/2 C of flour mixed w/1 tsp baking powder to initially coat . Used only 1/4 C mayo (mixed with other ingredients) before adding to the crab. Allowed crab mixture to sit in the fridge for an hour. I gently shaped into small (palm sized) patties and lightly coated w/flour mix.  Set cakes on waxed paper lined baking sheet; let rest in fridge another 20 minutes. I then pressed them onto crushed up Panko crumbs and let rest again for Panko to adhere well. Fried in 1/2" of veg oil until golden brown on both sides (use 2 spatulas to flip -1 on top, 1 on bottom). Drained on paper towels. Tasted great - crispy outside, moist inside. Great with a squeeze of fresh lemon! Thanks for the idea and a recipe you can alter a bit.

These were delicious. I did double the fresh ginger, and I used 18 oz. crabmeat instead of 14. I also added about half a minced jalapeno for a little extra kick. I made these into baby crab cakes and served them with a mustard and poblano aioli as a Thanksgiving appetizer. They disappeared in less than 5 minutes with "mmm"s and "oohhh"s coming from stuffed mouths. This is a good base recipe that can be easily altered to your tastes. Thanks!

These turned out fantastic!  I made the following changes: I added more ginger than it suggests and we couldn't taste it, I suggest doubling the suggested amount. I didn't add any hot sauce. I used basil instead of cilantro. It was too liquid to dip into egg so I added the egg to the mix. When made into patties (very liquid patties) I added breadcrumbs to only one side then flipped that side onto skillet with breadcrumb side down.  I then added breadcrumbs to other side while it cooked

I live in Maryland, where everyone "knows" crabcakes.  This is a wonderful recipe!!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used panko bread crumbs.  The result was lovely- light and perfect for summer fare.  Added an asian-style cole slaw, corn on the cobb, and pinot grigio!  Thanks for sharing this.

These were good, but if you aren't a fan of of fresh ginger, you won't like them.  I followed the recipe exactly except substituted cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs because that's what I had on hand.  Very messy to make but browned nicely and looked beautiful when done.  They went well with a tangy coleslaw with pineapple.  They had a nice fresh taste and if I make them again, I think I'll use less ginger (and I love ginger!)

Made these with canned crab.  Absolutely fantastic.  Probably could have added another can of crab.  Very small portions so we were fighting over it.  Didn't change a thing except not to add the hot pepper sauce.

Well... even if my husband thought these were "the best he's ever eaten," I am the Queen so it's my opinion that really counts!!  Not only was this the messiest, pain-in-the butt stuff to make, but also they were not as tasty as I was expecting them to be.  Perhaps my opinion on their taste was swayed by the mess I had to clean up... but I still thought they were "missing something."  I won't make these again unless hubby absolutely insists!!

Wonderful!  As a  Canadian, I only got to eat 'real' crab cakes when I visited the US.  These are not only real but the best ever!  The only change I made was to the final breading when I rolled balls of crab cake mixture and placed then on a plate of bread crumbs, brushed egg on with a pastry brush and turned them over to repeat. instead of oil, I used vegetable spray in a non-stick pan.  I will double the recipe the next time.

Ok now, seriously the best cakes ever! I actually added the breadcrumbs in with the rest of the ingredients but otherwise followed the recipe exactly as written. I'm sure I also used more ginger then required because I love that stuff. You should definitely make them thick, about 1.5-2 inches and fry them. I didn't find that they soaked up too much oil at all. Doing it this way leaves them cooked in the middle but moist and delicious. So delicious we didn't need or want to use the sauce I made to go along with them. I'm a lucky girl because my other half is a dungeness crab fishermen so that's what we used. If you can get your hands on some fresh crab all the better. I also found that not flaking the crab too much adds a lot to the texture and goodness to what I devoured last night. I've tried this recipe a couple other ways and it worked well but does not compare to how I just made them. Yum yum!!

Great overall flavor! Could stand a little less mayonnaise. Adding a little more crab than called for would really make for a great crab cake. I was only able to make 8 patties using these measurments. Would definitely make again with these changes.

Excellent, easy, and delicious. Crab cakes can be eaten cold on day two as well.  I actually use them in a sandwich. 

One innovation: I broil them on a baking sheet. Avoids the messing around with the hot oil, and they're every bit as tasty, and even crunchier on the outside.

Loved this! I used about 1/3 cup regular mayo which was probably still a little too much. Put in extra fresh, minced ginger and added some garlic powder. I also decided to broil them and they were delish. Because of this, I added bread crumbs into the  mix. Great recipe and definitely a keeper!

I found a jar of ginger pepper jam in the fridge and it was amazing atop the cakes.  Also, I recalled a previous crab cake recipe in which you make them into patties and then refrigerate them for an hour or two (I used a muffin tin).  It keeps them from breaking up while frying.  Great recipe!  Thanks!

Another recipe to convert a non-fish lover! Tweaked by omitting the pepper sauce, added dry mustard powder instead. Used fresh ginger which I tripled (love ginger!) used Panko bread crumbs (all others are too heavy). Perfect! Shared with co-workers who immediately asked for the recipe. Definitely a hit!

Delicious! Ginger was not overpowering, but really added to the crab.

I will have to say this was my first ever attempt at making crab cakes. They were a huge hit! Everyone loved them even my mother-in-law who is not a crab cake person loved them. Thank for sharing this recipe,
