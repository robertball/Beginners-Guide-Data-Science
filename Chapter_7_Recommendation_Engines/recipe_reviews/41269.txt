I made this recipe and then had my kids help to form fun shapes. They had a blast making and eating the finished results.

More like a cheesy baking powder biscuit in the shape of a pretzel, but tasty all the same.

They turned out absolutely delicious! They don't really taste like the ones from the wall, they're a little more like biscuits, but really good!

Very good. Tastes like actual pretzels. Even though I had trouble shaping them into pretzels I made them as biscuits. lol. And I would add more cheese because I love cheese! But definately 5 stars!!! Will make this again!!

Very tasty, just not very pretzel-like.  We quietly shoved them into our slavering faceholes after dipping them in American mustard which gave them a needed edge.  Next time I intend to make these as breadsticks using an excruciatingly sharp cheddar and a couple of cloves of garlic.

I would give them a four, they tasted more like biscuits but very good, I tried them without cheese also and they were delicious, I had them with jam. Just add more cheese if you want them as cheese pretzels I didnt find them cheesy enough

These are a tasty and quick snack.  I used 1 c. white and 1/2 c. whole wheat flour, which tasted great.  Just a note:  It is unnecessary to roll out the dough and cut into strips. After kneading briefly, just pinch off a chunk of dough, roll it between your palms to form a 6-7 inch rope, and then shape into a pretzel twist.  Much quicker!!!

I really don't see how these are supposed to taste like pretzels. They were still good though. My 2 year old enjoyed them. But I only give it a 3 star rating. They taste more like cheesy breadsticks, shaped like pretzels. Unfortunately these won't be on the top of my list to make again right away

These were ok. After reading the others reviews I was prepared that they would not taste like real pretzels. They were the best right out of the oven, then they got a bit dry

i thought these were excellent!  very easy to make and delicious.  i added a cup of cheese based on other people's reviews and i think that was a great idea.  i somehow managed to only make about 10 of them rather than 18 but maybe i made them too large.  anyway i definetely recommend them!

I didn't really care for this recipe too much.  The dough just didn't have enough zing for me.
