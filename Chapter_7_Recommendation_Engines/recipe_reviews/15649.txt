This recipe is absolutely fabulous!!  The only thing that was wrong, is that the instructions did not tell when to add the peanut butter, not that it was hard to figure out but I did all the wet ingredients and I was like, what about the peanut butter??!!  But so delicious, great consistency, loved using the muffin tin, they look like little mini tarts!

Delicious!  I used 1 tsp. vanilla, 3/4 tsp. baking soda and no salt.  Adding more vanilla offsets some of the peanut flavor.  Definitely need a mini muffin baking pan for this one.  With a regular sized muffin baking pan, the cookies are too big for the miniature peanut butter cups.  Of course,  you could always buy the regular size peanut butter cups instead!  This recipe makes about 24 cookies in the mini muffin pans.  I fill each muffin space to the top.  They are slightly dry so next time I might use a little less flour.

i love these cookies!! the peanut butter and chocolate together is just perfect! i only made half, 8 cookies, and they turned out really good. the hardest part was waiting for them to cool, so we could eat them!! i highly recomend this. it would be fun for to make too. i was looking at other peanut butter cup cookie recipes and they all called for a mini muffin tin, and i don't have one. so i just used a noemal sized one and they aren't too big, and they cooked just fine. you should definatly try these if you like peanut butter and chocolate, you won't regret it!! :)

I make these all the the time but I use a box of chocolate brownie mix. I follow the directions on the box. Fill mini muffin tins 1/2 to 3/4 full and bake 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven and press peanut butter cup into the brownies right away... let cool for a few minutes and remove from pan. They are very rich but everyone loves them.

Absolutely my favourite cookie recipe out there! When I make these, I make sure to make an absolute TON of them because they go fast! Every time I bring them to any event or gathering people always want the recipe, so if you plan on sharing these with people, make sure to have a few copies of the recipe on hand because people will be asking!

Bet you can't eat just one of these!  I increased the vanilla to 1 tsp. and added 2 Tbsp. of milk, but otherwise kept the recipe the same.  I used a mini muffin scoop to measure out the dough and cooked it in mini muffin tins.  I pressed one frozen mini P.B. cup down into the top of each one, before cooking, and that left an imprint that was easy to fill with the candy cups once they came out of the oven.  The bake time for my oven was closer to 10 mins, and they required quite a bit of cooling in the fridge before they would come out without breaking.  Make these- you won't be disappointed!

Perfect!  Followed recipe exactly, but used mini muffin pan (yielded nearly 48).  Greased pan before each batch.  Baked one batch with PB cup already inside, but recommend following the recipe directions to wait until dough is baked then pressing PB cup into dough - beautiful result!  Also, the Pampered chef small scoop is the exact amount of dough needed to fill each mini cup.  Thanks!  This is a keeper!!!

My hubby- who HATES peanut butter cookies loved these!  I will be making over and over again.  I highly recommend you use the mini muffin pan- they came out great and were so easy to do.  To save time I had the kids unwrap the peanut butter cups for me!

My family love these cookies I make them all the time. I found if you freeze the peanut butter cups before you place in cookies the chocolate won't melt.  I also don't add the salt, for some reason they turn out to salty if I do. I guess the peanut butter has enough salt itself. Definitely would recommend using mini muffin pan they tun out so much better.

I made this for an event at our apt complex, and everyone LOVED them!  We did put them in the fridge right after we added the peanut butter cups.  And I had to cook them a little longer but they tasted awesome!

I made these for an event and had to make far more than anticipated, mychildren, and then their friends, and then surprise visitors kept eating them. I did find that they would not bake well in a muffin pan, so I switched to cupcake pan. THESE cooked properly.

I absolutely love this recipe.  As one other person had suggested, I left the salt out.  I used regular muffin tins, and they were the perfect size.  Not too big at all.  Thank's for the great recipe.

They were prefect as is, but I did add a little extra vanilla. If you read carefully is says to only fill the pan 1/4 of the way, this will make the cookie just the right size for the peanut butter cup and you won't have to use a mini muffin pan.

Great recipe. You could also add a hersheys kiss or a rolo candy to change up the center treat. I tripled the batch and used  mini muffin pans. Very simple but very impressive. I can't stop eating them...YUMM!!

We liked these. I think they would have been better as regular cookies, though. The muffin pan gave them a soft brownie-like consistency, and I was hoping for something a little crunchier to offset the softness of the peanut butter cup. Great flavor though!

These cookies are always a hit and if you want to add some variety, make a batter with chocolate caramel cups instead.

These are very good.  I made them in the mini muffin pan which makes them just the right size.  I found the recipe made a lot more than stated.  I ran out of mini pbutter cups so I started topping them with a mix of chocolate chips and pbuter chips.  Not as great as the pbutter cups, but not a bad substitute.  The cookies froze quite well too.  I will make these again.

Very good.  I made in a regular muffin tin and only made 15 per the recipe and they turned out very thick, like a peanut butter brownie.  Very rich!  Next time I will try a mini muffin pan, so I can eat more than 1!

Absolutely delicious and easy too.  I doubled the recipe and using a mini muffin pan, ended up with 35 little peanut butter cups.  They are a perfect Halloween treat!

Like everyone else we LOVE them!! My kids always ask me to make them for school stuff. If I am in a hurry I buy peanut butter cookie mix in the bag. Also if you buy the Walmart brand peanut butter cups (Great Value or Sams choice?) they are not wrapped and that saves more time. They are just as good if not better to and don't cost as much.

Excellent cookie. I love the way they feel in my mouth, they melt and then a rush of melted chocolate and peanut butter. A blissful piece of heaven for the mouth.

I love this recipe. I have used Rolos, Kisses, and Peanut Butter Cups and they have all turned out great. I used a mini muffin pan and filled them a little over 75% full. These are a huge hit at home and the office.

These do take quite awhile to cool enough to remove from the muffin tin.  Works well with a regular muffin tin, as well.  No need to run out and search for a mini muffin tin if you don't have one.  Thankfully, most of my cookie recipes call for 350 degree baking, so I can do a batch of these, and while they're cooling in the fridge, make a couple batches of the other 15,000 doughs I've made tonight :P  Will take a long time to complete a double batch though.  Could someone send me some muffin pans for Xmas?!

Happy baking, everyone!

This recipe went down wonderfully in my family -- they all love peanut butter cups and peanut butter cookies so the combination was a treat. The only thing I changed -- and I highly recommend this -- is after the cookies cooled, I dipped them in chocolate. The chocolate hardened well and balanced out the peanut butter.

This is my all time FAVORITE recipe. I usually double it and add Heath Bar Toffee Pieces and I bake it in a regular muffin tin. The cookies come out very rich so they last a long time and are great for bake sales.

Easy to follow recipe with absolutely no problems! I managed to make 18 out of the batch while using a regular muffin pan, so there is ample batter. My family loved them!

Best cookies EVER!!  I took them to a party and they were literally inhaled.  My family was upset that they didn't get any.  I used a mini-muffin pan and for some reason, these taste much better than the traditional peanut butter blossom cookies!

These turned out great.  I have been looking for this recipe for years now.  I bought these at the local mall for some time, but couldn't replicate the recipe at home.  I'm so happy I found this recipe it's exactly like the cookie cups from the mall.  Perfect!

I clicked on this thinking it was the usual one I make but realized too late that this is a different version.  It has half a cup less flour than the previous one which makes these cookies extremely dough-y!  I had to let them cool on the pan before attempting to remove them.  I'm sure my husband will happily gobble them up though:)  I didn't have any PB cups so I put a Hershey kiss on top instead.

I made these for an office going away party.  A co-worker called them addictive.  I used a generously over-filled, one-teaspoon cookie scoop to measure out dough to make balls. These weren't large enough to wrap over the edges of the mini peanut butter cup and hide the fluting.  When I make them again, I'll use two teaspoons of dough to form the dough balls. I rolled half the dough balls in a mixture of granulated sugar mixed with light brown sugar before baking.  I think this move helped bring out the peanut butter flavor of the cookie.  Definitely put the unwrapped candy in the freezer while you're working on the dough.  Finally, the cookies will be very soft when they come out of the mini muffin tins. I cooled them on a rack for about an hour, then put them on plates and placed them in the refrigerator to firm up before packing in a container.

Delicious and easy! Followed the recipe exactly, but made them in mini muffin tins with the unwrapped mini peanut butter cups. Also used muffin papers to make it easy to remove these from the tins and transport to work. Now I just have to hide them until I take them in! Yummy!

I made this recipe as written. I used the mini muffin tins but I messed up by not making them into balls. My cookies fell in the middle and the mini reeses weren't big enough to cover the dent. They tasted very good though. I then thought maybe I can put some jam in the middle so they would look good. Surprise, it worked. They were a little sweet but it looked like I spent much more time on them then I did. The Christmas party is this weekend so I am hoping for the best.

Great recipe! Wish I had another mini muffin pan, because they are hard to get out when warm without messing them up.
