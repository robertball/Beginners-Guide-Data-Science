Excellent recipe. Loved the coconut flavor! I used boneless chicken thighs instead of breast and reduced to 1 tsp (actually 1 cube) of chicken bouillion to reduce sodium. Also used more butternut squash (about 2 cups) to increase the healthy vegetables.

All of my family LOVED this, I did let it simmer for a little longer than the recipe stated because the squash hadn't quite cooked through. It was nice cooking for the extra time because the chicken kind of fell apart in the sauce and the kids liked that. Very tasty served with buttered rice and greens. I'll DEFINITELY make this again.

This was absolutely wonderful.  My husband is from the Caribbean, so I was picturing a totally different result.  In actuality it is more like a Thai dish.  Didn't make any changes other than leaving out the mushrooms because I didn't have them on hand and simmering the chicken a little longer.  Will definitely make again.

Amazing recipe! Would have been worth 5 stars if followed exactly as written, but felt like a few minor mods made it above and beyond delicious! Would use about half the suggested butternut amount next time. Before serving, I added the juice of one lime (really brightened all the flavors), 1 tsp salt (also really brought out the flavors) and 1/4 teaspoon of Cayenne pepper, which gave it just a little bit of a kick (the carribean seasoning we found wasn't spicy, so taste before adding this in case yours is). Some reviewers mentioned that the flavors needed a bit more time to really meld, so I opted to cook everything (except the chicken) in the crockpot on low all day. Then an hour before dinner, I added the cubed chicken. The flavors and consistency were perfect!

Dish was okay, if a little too tomato-based. I added fresh toasted coconut.

This dish is flavor-rich, but not overwhelming. Not too much of any one spick. We loved, and the kids loved it. With brown rice and naan. So good. We doubled the chicken and squash...

This has the potential of being great. I subbed Gardein for the chicken (pan-fried it and tossed it in at the end) and used faux chicken granules. I added a little fresh, grated coconut for texture and cut the coconut milk in half. I think the only thing missing was the development of flavors (I think I'll let it simmer longer next time) and it definitely needed some acid (maybe a little lemon juice next time).

This was awesome!  So much flavour. Next time I might increase the jerk spice for a little extra kick. Had to add some corn starch to thicken the sauce a bit.

This recipie was good, but i think as written, it needs a little more sugar/salt to bring out the flavors. I actually altered the recipie a little bit for 1 lb of chicken, but used the same quantities for 2 lbs. except for the chicken bouillon. I did not have chicken bouillon and substituted with 1 cup of chicken broth. Unless you are cooking in a very large wok or skillet, I would not use more than 1 cup of chicken stock in the absence of bouillon, even if using 2 lbs of chicken. I also recommend cooking the chicken first with the spices before adding the chicken stock. I did not have squash or mushrooms, so i substituted with peas. I ended up adding more sugar, salt, and curry and jamaican seasoning as the chicken simmered for 40 minutes. In the process I lost a little of the coconut flavor. I didn't see much point to the tomato juice but added it anyway. In the end, I mixed up about 2-3 table spoons of corn starch in cold chicken broth to help thicken the curry and served over rice. I think the flavors are good, but it needs some minor adjustments.

AMAZING!!! The only thing I do different is use honey instead of the sugar, because I don't eat sugar. This recipe is delicious! A definite staple.

I was SO excited to make this dish, but ended up being disappointed with the result.  It ended up more like a "stew/soup".  If I do make it again, I would probably skip adding the cup of tomato juice.  This would make it thicker (less watery).

I enjoyed, and my husband loved. I made my own jerk seasoning using a recipe on this site (but substituted fresh thyme b/c I had in my garden). I used fresh tomatoes, green onions and chives from my garden too. (Chives b/c this recipe finished off the remainder of my green onions for the year...) Used chives for garnish.

I made this exactly as recipe indicated, it was delicious. Surprising flavor- blending sweet with a spicy after kick, chicken was very tender. Couldn't wait to take leftovers to work to show it off.

This is a great recipe that allows for modifications depending on what's in the fridge.  I substituted carrots for the squash and tomato sauce for diced tomatoes.  I also doubled the jerk seasoning.  It was a hit with my 3 year old and husband!  Yum!

I tripped the amount of seasonings plus added cayenne pepper and garlic powder. I also listened to the reviews that said to use V8 for the juice and pre-seasoned canned tomatoes. I subbed carrots and green peppers for the veggies and added the zest of one lime along with its juice. I used cornstarch mixed with more coconut milk to turn it into a thick stew. I was surprised by how much this recipe makes

This was amazing! I was looking for a recipe to use up some frozen chicken breasts that were tough and stringy. This recipe made the chicken tender and tasty. My substitutions: carrots instead of squash, coconut oil instead of olive oil, V-8 instead of tomato juice, italian style canned tomato, jerk seasoning using a recipe I found at allrecipes.com. Also, had no brown rice so I used quinoa instead. This will be a standard recipe in my kitchen from now on!

I hate bland food and this definitely had a lot of flavor! The butternut squash is so good, and I loved how much this recipe makes. I definitely think it could be improved though. Upon making it a second time, I made the following changes: I upped the curry/jerk seasonings as suggested, added cornstarch to thicken (it really is way too watery), added a 1/2 tsp of minced green pepper, and added the juice of 1 lime at the end. I also replaced the mushrooms with 1/2 cup of diced, peeled potatoes (I thought the mushrooms clashed with the existing flavors and were  rather off-putting), and the green onions with chives (I also thought the green onions didn't fit well). Next time I think I'll sear the chicken separately and then add it in the last 10 minutes of cooking, because I found the chicken very dry when cooked the entire time.

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could! I didn't read the recipe very well and so mine came out quite soupy, but I ended up liking it that way.  I didn't reserve the tomato juice; instead I just dumped the whole can of tomatoes in.  It was little messy going in afterwards trying to cut up the tomatoes with scissors. In the end, I just put it over brown rice and it was perfect.

This was SOOOO GOOD!!!  I didn't want to cook my chicken as long as the recipe, so after the chicken was nicely browned I took it out.  Continued on with the recipe and added the chicken back in the last 5 minutes.  Also used a 12.5 oz can of diced tomatoes instead of the 28 oz. can of whole tomatoes.  Tasted the dish at the end and added a touch more curry and jerk seasoning.  We loved it, great flavor!  Thanks!

My husband gave it a 3 and I would give it a 2.
I did not have jerk so I used Caribbean seasoning.

We found this very enjoyable and loved the butternut and mushrooms.  Leftover were better than the first night.  Good but overall lacked the WOW factor of us.

I took people's advice and seared the chicken and added it back in for the last 10 minutes of cooking. I also added 2 cups of spinach at that time. Very good recipe! Will definitely make it again!

I substituted a small can of tomato sauce for the canned tomatoes and juice. I also used homemade jerk seasoning that is not dry.  It came out amazing! This is one of our new favorite dishes for sure.  JUST the right amount of spice and big flavor.

Couldn't find the Carribean jerk dry seasoning and didn't have the chicken bouillon granules so I substituted Chef Merito's Chicken seasoning [3 tsp] and added 1/2 tsp of chili pepper.  Was delicious.  I nice mild seasoning that let me savor all the flavors

Turned out great. It's not a quick dinner to make, but very yummy. Definitely need to simmer a bit longer so everything has the chance to meld together! Husband LOVED it. Just back from Afghanistan, and couldn't get enough!

This was not as spicy as I thought it would be. It was quite watery so I thickened it a tad with corn starch. Perhaps I should have drained the tomatoes--I used a can of diced and did not drain off and reserve the juice, which was probably more than the 1/2 cup they wished you to use.

Delicious! Even better than I thought it would be. Didn't have the mushrooms or green onions & it still turned out great.

Very tasty indeed.  Next time, I'm thinking of adding more butternut squash, curry powder and jerk seasoning as we like things spicy.
But this was delicious as is.  Thank you!
