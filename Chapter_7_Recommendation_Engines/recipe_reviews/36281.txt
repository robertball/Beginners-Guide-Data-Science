My whole family loves this recipe, i also use the key west seasoning on veggies, such as green beans.  My 4 year old does not eat green beans  anymore without the key west seasoning on them.

I really liked the flavor...and there is a lot of flavor.  I think I will add lemon zest next time to give it that fresh taste. Our chicken was very very juicy, but that is dependent on how you cooked it. We used an indoor grill and look foward to trying it on the outdoor.

Good, but my chicken was dry.
