This was a pretty good dish.  I really liked the idea of all the flavors together.  Some things to note- you should stir the rice once or twice while it's cooking so it absorbs all the coconut milk, or else it will burn around the edges.  Don't cook the chicken until it "browns", it will be overdone.  The dish is very colorless... I would recommend adding some red pepper flakes, cashews, a lime twist, and/or even cilantro.  I really liked the coconut rice.  YUM!  Also, I would recommend marinating the chicken longer than 20 min for it to soak up that good flavor.  I will try this again with those changes.

This was a great dinner, and very easy!! The coconut rice (which I made with brown rice) was excellent. In the future I'll make it with one lime instead or marinate it for just 15 minutes, it was a little too acidic for me.

Overall it was great! I agree with others that the ingredients are best when eaten in the same bite.

This is an absolutely amazing blend of flavors...I ate WAY too much!  I'm not a big coconut fan, so did not sprinkle flaked coconut on top, but thought the mild flavor in the rice was just right.  I also sauteed some sweet red bell pepper with the chicken for added color and garnished with cilantro.

This was a fun meal!  I really enjoyed all of the flavors together- I think it's important to have the rice and chicken together in the same bite.  If you eat the rice alone, it's a little bland (hence the 4 stars instead of 5).  I used brown rice, as usual, and just cooked twice as long.  Thanks to the reviewer who suggested stirring the rice a few times during cooking.  I think mine would have burned otherwise.  The amount of lime was perfect- I would have been good with even more.  I added a sprinkle of salt to the chicken as it was marinating.  My kids loved the chicken- they both asked for seconds!  They didn't like the rice though.  We had this with plain broccoli.

Delicious! So much flavor!  I made the coconut rice a little differently.  I used 1/2 tsp. of tumeric to give it a beautiful golden brown color.  Otherwise did everything this same.  I've made many chicken recipes off this site and my husband said this is his favorite so far.

The lime was definitely too strong. I would go wtih 1 lime. Also, there is a photo with red or orange peppers (I think) and some kind of herb, and I tried to copy that because it definitely needs something more than what the recipe calls for. As is the lime is overwhelming and it's really quite plain.

This was pretty good, though a little heavy on the lime.  If I make this again I will use the juice from only 1 lime.  Also, I only had 1 Tbls of ginger, but it seemed like a good amount.

Very good! I like the "lime-est" of the dish. Visually, not very appealing so we thought that next time we would add some chopped mango and a little bit of cilantro to give the beige dish some color! 
Yum!

This is a great 'idea' for a recipe. It definitely needed something for color as other reviewers stated so I added cilantro, and red & green peppers. This recipe also goes great with curry so I added a little at the end. I used 1 cup of coconut milk and 3/4 cup water as to cut down on fat and b/c another reviewer said her rice was too gooey from all the milk. I used brown rice so I had to keep adding more liquid until my rice reached the desired tenderness. I also used only one lime and at the end mixed the rice with the chicken since the rice alone is very bland. I also added salt and pepper to my own before I ate it. Very unique and I like the end result!

Pretty decent, overall.  I did notice that the chicken wasn't about to brown with all the juices and the marinade, so I had to drain it several times as I cooked it.  Also, the ginger seemed to give it a slightly powdery texture, which I wasn't too fond of.    I browned the coconut in a little butter before I sprinkled it on at the end.  I think it was a great touch.    Pretty tasty, and a good dish overall.  I'll make it again, and try tweaking it a little.

Four stars as is, five with the following changes: as others have noted, the dish is colorless, so I added one red and one yellow pepper cut into matchsticks; 2 carrots, grated; 8 oz fresh spinach; 2 oz chopped cashews, toasted; and a few shakes of red pepper flakes. I just sauteed the vegetables in a little olive oil and then added the sesame oil, chicken and marinade. Also, the chicken never browned because of the marinade - another reason to add some color to the dish. I also toasted the coconut in a teaspoon of butter for more flavor. I used brown rice and lite coconut milk, just to make it healthier. The brown rice needed more liquid, so I watched it carefully and added water as needed, stirring every 10 minutes so it didn't burn at the edges. When the rice was done I added salt to taste. What's great about the recipe as is, is the wonderful ginger and lime flavors and the decadent stickiness of the rice. I know with all these changes that the premise of a quick meal with few ingredients is lost, but I think this would be worth the effort.

So bland! I added garlic, salt and cilantro. It helped a little, but it still wasn't great. I had to add water to the rice to get it to cook. The chicken doesn't brown because there's too much lime juice in the marinade. Don't bother with this one.

Delicious dinner.  I sweetened it a bit more for my kids.  I read the reviews and used them to tweak the recipe also.  I used 1 cup coconut milk and 3/4c. water and a full tsp of sugar.  It was still sticky, but flavorful.  I also added peppers and  cooked them along with the chicken and added a little more honey to taste.   I garnished with cilantro and unsalted dry roasted peanuts.

Kabob'd it!  Was looking for something for the grill, so added the honey right to the marinade (a little cilantro, too), threaded the chicken on bamboo skewers and grilled them.  The tartness of the lime in the chicken went nicely with the sweetness of the coconut rice. Also, grilled some veggies separately (without the marinade) to complete the meal.

I ADDED: 

- Extra lime juice & ginger to the marinade along w/ raw honey. 
- Used couscous instead of rice & added a 1/3 c. water & 2 Tbsp. sugar & 1/2 tsp of Sea Salt w/ the coconut milk. 
- Used vegetable oil instead of sesame (because I was out) & added quite a bit more raw honey, a pinch of cayenne pepper, garlic powder, sea salt & a splash of soy sauce & rice wine vinegar. 
- Also thinly sliced a red, orange & yellow bell pepper & sauteed them separately w/ just garlic salt and a little more oil & sprinkled chopped cilantro on top of everything. 
**Reviews were great!! :)**

But with the advice from others (replace 3/4 water for 3/4 coconut milk and add tumeric for the rice and add diced red bell peppers and cilantro to the chicken) along with adding a couple fresh garlic cloves to the marinade, I give this 5 stars.  Family gobbled it up!

I had to defrost the chicken so it may have head more liquid in the marinade. When it cane too saute of the chicken I couldn't seen to get rid of the marinade liquid. I think using one lime instead of two would help flavors blend. I did add a half onion and some broccoli. Red peppers would have been a nice color and flavor added. I added a half teaspoon each of curry, chili powder, and a teaspoon of basil. It could use some salt and pepper to bring out flavors. I'll be trying the recipe again.

This recipe really needed a lot of alterations before it tasted right.  Without any of these the chicken is extremely limey and the rice is bland.  
I added chopped onion with the chicken to saute.  
We combined the chicken and rice and added 2 canned pineapple rings chopped up, dried cilantro (fresh would have been even better), salt and pepper.  Without some alterations I'm not sure that we would have enjoyed the recipe very much.

This was a really yummy dish. The rice took a bit longer to cook than the recipe indicated, and I would suggest doubling the rice so you have plenty - it's fantastic.

This meal was delicious! I really like the suggestions from the other members. First time I made this I followed directions exactly. Second time I added the tumeric to the rice and added diced red pepper to the chicken for color (as suggested). It definitely made for a more visually appealing meal. (broccoli cooked with garlic the side dish) A really good dessert to follow this meal is simple greek yogurt with some berries and a light drizzle off honey. Yum!

Absolutely delicious.  I added another tbsp of honey and used another tbsp of sesame seed oil when I made this.  I had leftover chicken so made from cooked chicken and turned out well.  Will use again.

It was quick and easy!  To give it more sustenance and eat less of the rice I added two stalks of broccoli.  After stir frying the chicken I removed from the pan and added another tablespoon of sesame oil, heated for about 30 seconds and added the broccoli stir frying for about 1 1/2 minutes.  Then I added 1/4 cup of water and covered with a lid to steam the broccoli for about 4 minutes.  Then I added two tablespoons of honey (to account that I added the broccoli).  I finished it up as instructed.  I'm diabetic and have to be conscious of the amount of carbs I eat.  Everything has carbs but if I reduce those foods with the highest then I can manage it with my daily meds.  Not sure how much sugar is altogether with the coconut milk (I substituted a packet of Splenda too for the 1/2 teaspoon of sugar).  But healthy eating, reduction in carbs, daily meds AND daily exercise helps me manage my glucose levels.  Anyway, it was good! I'll be making this again soon!

I should have read the other reviews first about stirring the rice because some of it stuck to the bottom of the pan and burned. Also, 100% coconut milk is just a bit much - I'd do half water next time I think.   The chicken was pretty good. Taste reminds me of a Caribbean-style marinade I used to buy at Whole Foods, but this one is a lot cheaper!

As a point of reference, I love coconut as a snack and with dessert, however I've never tasted it incorporated with any taste other then sweet.  That being said, I ended up picking up a can of coconut milk with the intention of using it at some point. Sure enough the same day I picked it up I stumbled across this recipe. I didn't stay religious to the marinade, as I wanted to bring a bit more flavor to the table. I didn't have any limes (which is a shame because it goes better with ginger IMO), so I used a lemon instead. To the marinade I added a sweet Malaysian soy sauce (its sweetened with palm sugar and is about as thick as honey and tastes delicious), 2 cloves of garlic (minced), and some fresh ground star anise. Everything else I followed in the recipe. The chicken came out great, and I'm certainly going to give it another go with lime juice. The rice was slightly overwhelming. I may end up cutting it down to a 3:1 ratio with water or chicken stock. I had extra coconut milk so I created a dipping sauce for the chicken just to further submerge my daughter and myself into the world of the coconut. She cleaned her plate completely, and I certainly didn't leave leftovers. Do yourself a favor and shred your own coconut, and make your own coconut milk (mine smelt like preservatives but tasted fine). Can't wait to try this recipe out again!

I didn't follow the coconut recipe exactly, so my rating does not include it. As for the chicken, absolutely delicious!! I love the ginger-lime flavor and the honey gives it the right amount of sweetness. I've made it several times now- yum, yum, yum!

This dinner was not a success for me.  I made the rice in my rice cooker.  I had to keep adding water because the rice wasn't cooking enough in just the coconut milk.   The chicken was a little too "limey" I think if I added more honey it would have been better.

This dish was fantastic. I love the coconut rice, although next time I will add a little more sugar. I had it with cilantro on top and extra coconut. I think the amount of lime was perfect. I served it with a side of snow peas in garlic and a bit of red pepper.

We loved all the flavors together.  I used only about 1T ground ginger, a dash of chili powder (hoping for some color), 2 limes zested and juice.  I had packaged coconut rice mix, so I can't comment on the coconut rice.  Will definitely make this again.

I did what others suggested and cut down on lime and lime zest.  I also added a little soy sauce and rice vinegar.  The photo shows red bell pepper but it’s not mentioned in the recipe.  That’s why I gave it four stars. So, I added some red and yellow pepper and some cashews. I cooked the peppers with the chicken. It was yummy!

This is a fantastic recipe for a college student or someone who has never really cooked anything remotely Asian before. I can see why it would appeal to some folks, however it truly is a recipe from someone who made it up from scratch with no in depth knowledge of cooking at all (I was wondering when I did not see any seasoning). I have also made up recipes like this. It is like having a blank canvas and a lot of paints and just putting together your favourite colours without any talent or training for art.  Somewhat edible, however not really repeatable. Sometimes you win, and sometimes you lose. I took a gamble on this one because it has with some of my favourite flavours and lost...however I also learned a couple of things in the process. Thanks for an interesting recipe...but nothing I will cook again.

Will have to make it again, this is real comfort food and excellent flavors!  Fried some fresh eggplant with organic unrefined coconut oil and then added to the chicken for some vegetables in it.  Leftovers had a stronger coconut flavor, wonderful.  Added a little salt and pepper also.

Was so tasty, I wish I had made more! The only thing I would change is how I made the coconut rice as it turned out too rich. I would make it the way I usually make it with 1 cup of rice, 1 cup of water and 1 cup of coconut milk and a pinch of salt. I also added some frozen oriental vegetables and some chili into the chicken. Will definitely make this again!!

This was delicious. A bit bland visually, so I added a chopped tomato at the last minute for color and extra veggie power. I had made a huge batch of coconut rice for a party and was looking for something to go with it for dinner. This worked out great.  thanks.

I loved this but my family didn't. I was one of the few things my husband said "don't ever make this again". The kids all ate it but complained. I especially loved the coconut rice. I may make this for myself for lunch but not for my family. I thought the flavors blended wonderfully and wished they had liked it as much as I did.

This was just a little strong on the lime, but overal very good.  On the advice of some other other reviewers, I added some bell pepper for color, and a pinch of turmeric to the coconut rice for color as well.

My husband had 3rds, lol. It was a wonderful combination of flavors and I will make it many times. In the picture it contained what I assumed to be red bell peppers, so I thought that that may go nicely. I only changed a few things. First I marinated the chicken with your listed ingrediaents but added salt and pepper and garlic powder. After the meat marinated I added cornstarch and added it to the oil so it would be moist and tender on the inside but a little crisp on the outside. Then I added sliced green and red peppers and red onions in the middle of the pan and cooked til barely tender. I then added more lime juice, honey, and a bit of the coconut milk I had reserved from the rice. Thanks for the great recipe.

This is such a flavorful meal! I didn't have enough fresh ginger around so I substituted about half the fresh ginger for ginger powder without any trouble. It really was very easy and I'd definitely make it again!!

I found it to be too sour and tart. But then I may have screwed something up. On the bright side, I use the directions for coconut rice from the recipie for all of my coconut rice needs.

Loved it! Even though I decided not to add the coconut flakes at the end it tasted awesome. The best part is that it is not expensive to create and does not have to many ingredients. Very easy to pull off.

The chicken was AMAZING!!! So yummy! The rice brought the rating down though. It was too...nutty? I don't know but it was a little bland. My husband loved the rice though. He said it tasted like his grandmother's rice pudding.
