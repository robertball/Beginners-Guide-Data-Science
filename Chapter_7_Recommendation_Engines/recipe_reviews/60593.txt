I made this (with "tweaking") for a July 4th pot luck and it was a major hit. (I'm certain that the novelty of the juices added to it's "mob appeal".) This made a lot, but I came home with an empty bowl. :) Tweakings: 1. I began by using 10 avocados (because of the anticipated crowd) and adjusted the other ingredients accordingly. 2. To stretch it, I blended the avocado with 2 8 oz. pkgs. cream cheese. 3. I used bottled lime juice concentrate, fresh squeezed orange juice and the syrup from a can of pineapple chunks. 4. I substituted a sprinkling of chili powder and some cayenne flakes for the cumin (personal preference). 5. Lastly, I added 2 Tbls. Worcestershire sauce. My intention was that my offering be used as a topping for the burgers, but some of the "guests" topped their hot dogs with it, too.

When I first tasted this, I was a bit disappointed. I think it needs time to sit and let the flavors mix.  I also added more lime juice, which improved it (to my taste--i love fresh lime).

I usually make my guacamole "fully loaded" -- with onions, tomatoes, lots of garlic, assorted colors of bell peppers, plenty of jalapenos, maybe olives, sometimes mango, Carolina blue crab, etc, etc. -- so I was pretty skeptical about this "bland" recipe; however, the juice infusion kept calling me back to look at it again.  So I tried it: first I made it exactly like the recipe and it was quite good (although, yes, a little bland). Then I tweaked it my way a little, adding grapefruit juice (yum), tangerine juice (!) and crushed pineapple, and replacing the hot pepper sauce with a heavy sprinkling of wasabi powder. I refrigerated it overnight and then used it as a sandwich spread. This was SO DELICIOUS! It won't replace my Super Bowl dip, but it turned a simple sandwich into a gourmet meal. My luncheon guests loved it and I've got a new favorite in my recipe box!

We used chili powder instead of cumin, which turned the guac to a kind of a brownish color, but it tasted sooo good! Also, we didn't have pineapple juice so we just left it out.
