Oh my goodness is this recipe YUMMY!  I was making it for a tropical-themed party, and no sooner did I finish making it (and tasting it!) when I realized that it was gonna go WAY too fast, so I quickly whipped up a second batch.  Some changes you might find helpful:  1)  I increased the butter to 2 Tbsp., just to enhance the buttery taste; and 2)  I substituted the 1 tsp. vanilla extract for 1/2 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp. coconut extracts.  Another experiment I tried:  I cut back on the macadamia nuts a little bit, and added some chopped toasted coconut covered cashews for my second batch.  The toasted coconut flavor permeated the entire brittle!  Thanks for such an awesome recipe!

It took me four attempts to make this recipe work without burning it black in my microwave. The reason is that the recipe fails to mention that you need to take it out and STIR IT THOROUGHLY halfway through the cooking time after the nuts are added. Also, in my microwave, it can really only take 3-and-a-half minutes of cooking - NOT four - without getting overdone, and I have a small microwave, so be aware that every microwave is different and will require different timing and you may have to experiment the first time you make this.  But once you get the timing right for your microwave oven, it really is delicious.

Yummy.....I used extra butter in the pan.....I mean you only live once :) ...and instead of the macadamias, I used cashews...how yummy!  I am going to try this recipe again but use almonds next time.  You never know...Quick and simple!

This stuff is wonderful!  Easy to make and SOOO good.  It is the latest addition to the 20+ Christmas baskets I give out every year.  Other items I include: about 10 different kinds of cookies, homemade freezer jams, my famous lemon-cornmeal bread, candied pecans, and some kind of homemade ornament.  Anyway, I made the brittle just as the recipe directs and put about 7 good sized pieces in each clear small gift bag and tied it with pretty ribbon.  It was a big hit!  Thanks...an update 12/23/10: This year I used coarsely chopped cashews and cut back from 4 minutes in the microwave to 3 after adding the nuts.  Perfection.  I made 4 batches and all turned out well.  BTW, I use heavy duty foil and butter that.  Makes for easy cleanup.

Tasted great! First I used a micowave safe plastic dish which the bottom melted right off, that was a bit of a mess in my microwave. Then I used a glass dish and everything was great!

Very simple, very quick, very tasty. This is similar to other microwave brittle recipes, but the macadamia nuts add a buttery flavor sometimes lacking in others.

I tried to make this, following the directions, but 2 minutes into the cook time with the nuts in the mixture, I smelled that something was burning.  I stopped it and pulled the mixture out.  Smoke was billowing out of my microwave.  I read all the reviews, ran to the store, and tried again.  This is what I learned:  do not use Dry Roasted Macadamias, use RAW macadamias; when you add the nuts, cook it a minute at a time, stirring and checking after each minute, mine only took two minutes for that part of the recipe.  It was difficult to spread.  I was thinking that next time I might stick the baking sheet with the coconut under the broiler for the last minute of the microwaving process.  Hopefully the hot pan and hot coconut will allow me to spread the brittle mixture better.  However, the bottom line is that everyone loved it and it was gone by the end of the party.

Five stars for ease and taste! I have never made candy before and I am so glad this is the first thing that I tried. I used to big of a baking pan though and I had to scoop it together in the middle and flatten it out. By the way don't use anything plastic when preparing this recipe. I ruined a scraper when flattening the candy. I will make this again.  Thanks

Oh, just yummy!  And easy. It made a small batch that didn't quite cover the bottom of an 8x8 inch pan -- but I wouldn't try to microwave any larger quantity at a time because of the danger of spilling.  I recommend a heavy pyrex cup with a handle, and make sure you can grab it with a gloved hand BEFORE you heat it.  Very good recipe.

Quite easy but my microwave must be in the 1200w range and the cook time should have been less than stated for that kind of power. I had a bit of a hard time spreading it out over the coconut because it had already cooked a bit too much. Taste was nice, I used pecans and walnuts, I think the macadamia nuts would have been much better. I would like to try pistachios one day, too.

Yes, this was easy and yes, it seems to be tasty but it's obvious that my microwave does not have the same wattage as the successful reviews mentioned here. I followed the directions exactly and I guess my brittle did not reach a high enough temperature while cooking because it's about the texture of a really soft caramel. A little thicker than caramel syrup but not as solid as a soft caramel candy. I am bummed.  I had made a double recipe because I thought it sounded like a sure thing.  That's a lot of expensive ingredients down the drain.  It would have been nice to know the correct temperature needed of the syrup while cooking. Sigh.

Love the flavor, but my brittle came out soft. I don't think my microwave got the sugar hot enough. The nuts also burned a bit. Yum!

This was good, and very easy, but it didn't taste very coconutty.  Maybe if I ever make this again I would add coconut extract instead of vanilla, I don't know.   The candy itself with the nuts was good, but did not taste like coconut.

Different tasting. I burnt them the first time I tried. I had to reduce the time 2 + 2 + 1. I would not make this if there was ANY kids around. And maybe wear some hot pad gloves to protect yourself. Be careful it is a very easy way to burn yourself.

This is so easy and delicious! I toasted my coconut beforehand to add to the flavor. I also used sliced almonds, but they cook faster than macadamias, so I burnt my first batch. I watched it much more carefully on the second batch to make sure they didn't burn. Yum!

I'm not usually a fan of microwave candy recipes & this one was no different. The flavor was phenomenal (hence the four stars) but the texture wasn't what you'd call "brittle"....it would snap into pieces but was still slightly chewy. Microwave ovens vary so much atht it's hard to get the consistency perfect using one. Next time I think I will use the recipe for Aloha Brittle (from this site) which has almost exactly the same ingredients but gives a specific temperature to cook the candy to, which will ensure better success. Thansk for  an easy & tasty recipe though, Sara!

This is my Father's favorite candy for the holiday.  I use a 2-qt. pyrex measuring bowl to cook the brittle in and I use raw virginia peanuts.  No hot pan/bowl & I use a wooden spoon to stir.  Add peanuts last 2 min. of cooking time.  works every time!!  Thanks for the recipe post.

This recipe relies entirely on the type of microwave you have.  In my case, the time was too much and it didn't become brittle, it was more caramel like. Use a 1/4 less of coconut for better results.

I've made this brittle several times now and had the same microwave issues as others. The cooking time is half of what the recipe states. Stirring each minute is a great tip. The last time I made this I was out of corn syrup so I substituted maple syrup instead. It turned out awesome. The maple flavor with the coconut really zinged! Next time I make it I going to use the maple syrup again and add crumbled cooked bacon instead of coconut and macadamia nuts.

Made this last night - everything seemed easy but when I went to "pour" the mix over the coconut....it was super sticky and not very pourable.  It did pour out but then it was impossible to spread out because it hardened so quickly.  I just cooled the part that did spread and broke that up so it wasn't a total bust but there was definitely wasted coconut that never got the mixture on top.  My mother in law was here helping me and she couldnt believe how quickly it hardened as we were pouring and trying to spread.

Overall - it tasted good once cooled but I think it was hard to handle.

Fantastic Recipe! My family opted for almonds, but other than that - we followed amounts and times exactly.  This brittle is light and crisp. It doesn't stick to your teeth and has a wonderful flavor. I'm making another batch for a Christmas party. Thanks!

I make this brittle every year for friends and family at christmastime and they love it! I never tell anyone how easy it is to make (they don't need to know!) I do like to toast the coconut in the oven, but it tastes great either way. Thank you for a simple and delicious recipe!

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, this is the only time i have enjoyed making brittle. Very easy and very tasty, i substituted with pecans, came out little darker and very good. Would definitly recommend this recipe to friends, very fast and excellent taste. Thanks again. Now the man of the house is even helping me make my christmas candy. Its so very easy, but becareful the glass dish gets very hot. Thanks again, making brittle isnt that bad after all....

When I made this, it didn't harden correctly and was very sticky/wet. Not a fan personally

This recipe is great! Everyone RAVED, even the non-coconut lovers. Used only 1/2 c coconut as 1 cup wasn't nearly covered by the mixture. This is a keeper!

Delicious but I also burnt the first batch even though my microwave is not strong. Tempted to try it in Saladmaster pot on top off stove.

Awesome recipe, I burned myself too, be very careful.  I did mine on the stove top as I don't like cooking with the microwave

I LOVE this recipe and it is quick, easy, and everyone else loves it too!!  No way can you mess this one up, I have lived in 2 completely different climates and made this and it turned out perfect both times! Yes be very careful you can burn yourself pretty severely with any hot ingredients!

Absolutely fabulous!Here in HI it is hard to make candy, this recipe was perfect as it went into microwave!!  I got so many compliments, I ended up making and selling it!! To make it more "brittle" and less chewy, I pulled it with two forks to the edges, it made it much crunchier and "brittle".
