I didn't actually follow this recipe because we have been making our own scrambled eggs with feta cheese in it for years. Heres how we make ours: Scramble plain eggs with milk like you normally would for scrambled eggs, then once its almost through cooking, add a hearty chunk of feta cheese (Vigo is the best kind). Dont be afraid to use a lot. Be sure to crumble it small so it melts and all the eggs have some feta, not just some with huge chunks. Once you stir that in and the eggs are finished cooking, sprinkle some finely crumbled oregano over the eggs and stir that in. YUMMY

Wow - feta cheese and scrambled eggs together!Who knew it would make for such a tasty combination! I cut the recipe in half and added just a bit of milk to the eggs to get them nice and fluffy. I used cherry tomatoes cut in half and upped the feta a bit because I love the stuff. This only needed just a bit of fresh cracked black pepper for seasoning. Perfect with a side of whole grain toast!

Good. But the tomatoes made mine kind of soggy (seeing as tomatoes secrete juices when they are heated). I suggest you use a tomato that has been at room tempurature and add it near the end, as opposed letting it melt in with everything. In other words, don't actually cook the tomatoes! Gives everything a more "fresh" taste anyway.

For such an easy twist on eggs, it turned out so great!  I'm ashamed I never thought of feta and tomatoes with egg before.  I'm definitely keeping this one on hand to mix it up and to show  it off to Mom!  :D

I made this for breakfast this morning and I think it is very deserving of 5 stars.  I used egg beaters (30 calories per "egg" versus 70) but then added a bit more feta (the basil & sun dried tomato variety).  Delicious!  I think it would be good with some red bell peppers & mushrooms too.

Wow! Had my doubts about this but was pleasantly surprised. Reduced the recipe using only two eggs but kept everything else the same. Great flavor. Went well with Canadian bacon.

A yummy way to spruce up eggs, but more feta is needed to bring out the other flavors.  We added garlic, which was a nice addition, but the overall product was a little bland.

I'm not usually a big scrambled egg fan but every so often I get the urge to have some and I figured I'd try this recipe out.  All I had on hand was shallots and some seasoned feta so that's what I used.  Turned out great and tasted terrific.  I used a lot more feta than called for though.  Just kind of sprinkled a couple of handfuls into my eggs.  Delicious idea!

My favorite way to cook eggs. Doesn't need any added salt, the feta does it for you.

These were really good and so easy to make.  A nice change from the usual old scrambled eggs (makes me wonder why I didn't think of it myself.)  I do agree with Markaree's review that the feta isn't all that noticeable and the recipe could use another tablespoon or two.  Great recipe, though!

This is delicious! I cut the recipe in half, and used a red onion, diced small, sauteed in a Tblsp. of whipped butter. I also added a spoon of ice cold water to the eggs before cooking them, which tends to make them more fluffy. For the tomatoes I just used one roma tomato, which was actually closer to 1/2 cup. This was quick to make, which I loved, and very tasty. Thanks

This is a very TASTY way to add zip to boring scrambled eggs. I used chopped roma tomatoes, very little chopped, red onions, and freshly ground black pepper. I left out the salt. To my eggs I always add a tad bit of skim milk to help make them fluffy. I whipped up the eggs and added it to the hot skillet. Boy, I was pleasantly surprised how this combination turned out. this was very tasty. I loved the added bite from the feta cheese and they balanced out nicely with the chopped up sweet tomatoes. flavors were great, nothing overpowering. served with whole wheat toast and sliced portuguese sausage. YUMMO! This is a definite repeat for me.

This was lovely, but I couldn't really taste the feta. I think I'll just add the onions and tomatoes to my eggs from now on. Another yummy vegetable with scrambled eggs is spinach.

Delicious combination - I mixed up the ratios a bit (for one serving: 2 eggs, no tomatoes, extra feta and seasoned with oregano instead of salt/pepper) and it was fantastic. I'm not usually a big fan of eggs but this recipe was irresistible; will definitely be putting it on our regular rotation.

I cook for only myself in the morning, so I make little adjustments.  I use a tad of butter, add a small handful of fresh spinach leaves, and let them wilt.  I scramble 2 eggs, add organic black pepper and sea salt, crumble in a few chunks of feta, and fold over until light and fluffy.  I eat this every day!

What a great recipe--simple yet delicious, and easy to adapt.  It really doesn't need the salt & pepper at all.  Next time I'm going to sub egg whites and add chopped spinach.

Great recipe, I loosely followed ingredient amounts and it still turned out great as I had expected.  Lots could be added to this such as ham or asparagus.  Really versatile and tasty recipe.

Really good! I doubled the feta, and next time I think I'll throw in some basil near the end too.

this recipe is SUCH a keeper. I don't know that I'll make scrambled eggs any other way now. only change was to omit salt (the feta's got it covered!) and add some dried herbs de provence. YUM.

I love this recipe. I use only one whole egg and two whites. Also I add spinach and finish it off with a little lemon juice. Very tangy and light. Yummy!

Love feta with eggs!  To "veggie it up" a little more,  toss about 1 1/2 cups finely sliced fresh spinach leaves to the pan for a few minutes before you add the eggs.

didn't have time to chop so just used canned diced tomato's w/ green chilis (1/3c) in place of the tomato & onion.  Very delicious to me, the g/f was just OK w/ them

I shop at Grocery Outlet quite a bit, so I can usually buy feta there without too much damage to my food budget. I did cut this to two servings and used one egg white, one whole egg and I added some chopped red pepper and fresh mushrooms. I also used EVOO. Very filling and a tasty change from your usual scrambled eggs.

These were good eggs. They looked really pretty too. I used onion powder instead of real onion and sprinkled the top with chives too. This would be great rolled up in a warm flour tortilla. Thanks, I enjoyed this dish quite a bit.

I had this for breakfast everyday this week!  I sauteed the onions until translucent then added the tomates (grape tomatoes cut in half) and sauteed until the tomatoes were nice and done.  The feta added a great taste.

I've used this recipe in the past and what I've found that makes it even better is to add a little bit of whole milk or cream as you scramble the eggs. The milk and the feta mixed together makes it taste creamy and delicious. I also used cage free local eggs which I think always taste better. Also, taking out the seeds of the tomatoes before adding them to the eggs reduces the sogginess, which I sometimes found to be a problem.

the fresh ingredients in this recipe gave a nice twist to my morning eggs!  for personal preferences,i omitted the butter and onion and just sprayed the pan with cooking spray.  i also added the tomatoes at the end so they didn't get mushy, and i used only egg whites instead of whole eggs.  but i stayed with the basic idea of tomatoes and feta, and it was great! thanks!

I followed this recipe pretty closely except for a few things - once the butter had melted, I poured some of it out. I also omitted the onion as I did not have it on hand. Overall, this is a good recipe and a great way to use up tomato and feta cheese. I suppose you could experiment with other cheeses as well. Next time, I may use more cheese - but this recipe is pretty spot on as is. :)

These are delicious!  As many others have said, I don't know why I never thought of adding feta to my scrambles!  I've ordered scrambles with it, but have never done it at home for some reason!  It's SO perfect with the egg...the saltiness with the blandness of the egg.  Mmmm.  I used red pepper in place of tomatoes (what I had on hand/prefer), onion powder in place of onion, added some chopped spinach, and doubled the feta (would add even more next time as the flavor is still faint).  Very good though.  Definitely a keeper.

What a great combination of ingredients. Very tasty. Go light on salt. The feta is plenty salty enough.

The "idea" sounded good but at the same time not right.  I was wrong, even my picky 7 year old liked them.  It said to salt and pepper to taste, well we like garlic on almost everything so we used garlic salt.  To avoid soggy eggs, when you do the tomato make sure you get the seeds out.  This one is a recipe keeper thanks so much for taking boring scrambled eggs and zesting them up in a new way.

I listen to reviews and used EVOO and sauted my onions.  Trying to make it low-cal...I used 1/2 cup of southwestern egg beaters and scrambled them.  (only  60 cal.) When almost done I added the feta cheese.  Once on my plate I topped it with Garden Fresh Gourmet "Sweet Onion" Salsa! Delicious!

I used olive oil for the fat, skipped the tomatoes (they're out of season).  I used 1 T feta per egg, and sprinkled on dried oregano.  The olive oil and oregano go really well w/this dish.

I added basil and skipped the pepper and salt!

Great recipe - I loved it!  I added some basil as previous reviews had and almost doubled the feta and it was great.  I will definitely make this again.

Quick and easy... and very tasty! The flavor of the eggs and feta go well together. I used green onions, omitted the tomatoes (didn’t have any) and added almost double the feta. I just love feta! Since I thought it would be salty enough with all that feta, I only seasoned with freshly ground pepper. Yum! Thanks, Kerry, for a great recipe!

I used extra feta but still could not taste them.  Also added some garlic.  I think it needed pepper and a bit more salt.  I don't know if I will make it again.

We substituted green onions for the regular onions. We added fresh thyme, fresh garlic, cheddar cheese & swiss cheese, both grated. Very good! Will make it again.

Yum!    To make fluffier eggs, use a little water,  works better than milk.   and since tomatoes should never be refrigerated before cooking why heat them at all?   Toss in at the last minute  so they don't weep.

This recipe looked good on paper, but as usual, before putting on the menu in my restaurant, I made it for the family, their reactions varied from "not good" to disgusting.

I want to make a different scrambled eggs. So i found this and it was scrumptious. But instead of onions (because I don't like them that much)I used leeks. Also I was out of tomatoes, so I used salsa instead. I included mushrooms because I love them in my eggs. The recipe was awesome!

Very good!!! We added fresh bacon in with the eggs and mixed fresh parsley in before serving and both additions made it more hearty and beautiful to look at. Very easy to make and delicious. Definitely will make again... Excellent use of leftover feta!

It's quite good, but I think it needs a bit more flavor than salt and pepper. Maybe some tobacco or sirancho.

I thought this recipe was delicious.  Tomatoes and feta cheese go so well together.  I think that three eggs are enough if you're only making one serving.

I have been making scrambled eggs like this for years.  I also make omelets using the same ingredients.  One thing that I do add to the scrambled eggs is shredded sharp cheddar cheese along with the feta. It gives it a flavorful combination of cheese.  I go easy with the tomato as it can make eggs or omelet watery and I add chopped fresh spinach.

I made these this morning. The feta seemed to give it a bitter taste to the eggs. I served to my 15 year old son and his best friend for breakfast and neither of them cared for it either. We wanted to like it, but between the tomatoes and the feta, it just wasn't good for us.  It just might be us though.

the traditional recipe calls for one tablespoon of plain yogurt sour cream or Greek yogurt per egg being feta it's clearly a Mediterranean recipe try the greek yogurt trust me not milk. you've never had eggs till youve made it real cream

Loved this recipe. I always scramble my eggs with a splash of milk. In addition to the onion,  extra feta & tomato I added 6 sliced kalimata olives & used a pinch of oregano.  Perfect!

These are super yummy and simple!  If you haven't tried feta and eggs together, you must!  They go great together :)

Had this for quick dinner the other night and it was pretty good! Instead of butter I've used olive oil and added mushrooms to the mix.

Delicious - used 2 eggs and 2 egg whites + milk to reduce the egginess and make it smoother. Whipped the eggs in the blender for extra foaminess. Added dry basil and oregano with the feta and tomatoes. Topped it off with avocados after the eggs were done. Yummy!

Is a surprise for your mouth. Feta is not overwhelming like I feared may be. It's not. It's good. My modified version of recipe was to use green onions and skipped the tomatoes, probably would have been okay but could have made the eggs too wet. If I were to use tomatoes though it would have been the smaller than cherry tomatoes. Must use pepper though. Pepper to taste. Very good. Will make again sometime. Yummy.

I like to make this into an omelette rather than mushing it all together. It's more appealing to the eye and it's easier to make sure the feta is evenly distributed throughout. A very delicious alternative to just plain ole eggs! I make this stuff all the time :)

Loved this! Of course I love anything with Feta! I don't eat eggs very often but being Sunday morning, I sometimes make them for brunch. Hubby's doesn't normally like feta and was going to make his separately. He said he would try it and really liked it! Yeah! I salt & peppered the chopped tomatoes and let them set while doing everything else. I pressed them with a paper towel before adding to eggs to get rid of a lot of the moisture so it wouldn't come out in the eggs. I would add fresh spinach to this next time... And I certainly will make them again! Thank you!

This was great! I halved the recipe for my breakfast. I upped the feta, 3 tablespoons to 2 eggs & used cherry tomatoes! Sprinkled some fresh basil on top! Hubby ended up trying it & finishing it for me! Definitely a keeper!

Great! I used red onion and grape seed oil instead, added 1/2 bell pepper, a clove of garlic, and sprinkled feta and green onion after all was cooked. Made for a beautiful presentation :)

I did try this recipe, but eggs are so adaptable, and I was missing the tomato, so I changed it up. I grated a bit of zucchini, sliced one mushroom, chopped a green onion and added a wee bit of dried chili pepper flakes and sauteed the veggies in olive oil. Then added the eggs. Then the feta. Basically it turned into a scrambled omelet. It was divine!

I love it. I sometimes add chopped red bell peppers with the onions in the beginning in place of tomatoes. Feta is a nice change of flavor.

I am not a fan of cooked tomatoes unless it is pasta/pizza sauce. I added Mrs. Dash tomato basil season instead. I think sundried tomatoes could also be a good substitute.

I have also been making my own version of this for years. I put butter, minced garlic and fresh cherry tomatoes (halved) from my garden in the pan. Cook for a few minutes until the tomatoes start to soften, and then add the eggs. When the eggs are almost done, I add fresh basil from my garden and feta cheese. I usually eat it with english muffins or biscuits. It's my favorite summer breakfast. A great combination of flavors!!!

This is a very delicious variation of scrambled eggs.  The feta and tomato add a lot of flavor and bring the dish from boring to addictive.

Good, quick, and simple eggs.  I don't have any onions so I just eliminated them, but I more or less followed the remainder of the recipe.  I served with just toast and it was a nice breakfast for just myself this morning.  Thanks!

This was good.   I didn't use the tomatoes, because my boyfriend thinks they're disgusting.  Someday I'll try it when he's not around.  I had to make him a second batch.  Oink oink.

This recipe is great. I did make a few changes. I used olive oil instead of butter  and added mushrooms while sauteing onions. Also instead of adding the tomatoes to the eggs while cooking, I added them on top after placing the eggs on the plate. Very good and with so much flavor!

This was yummy! Very easy and good. I didnt make any changes and it was perfect. I think some olives would be good in it too, like another reviewer said.

Omitted the salt and tomatoes.  I used kalamata olives (recommended by another reviewer) and increased the feta.  I also added a little milk to the egg mixture before I added the eggs to the pan.  Great base recipe that's easy and has unlimited possibilites.  Next time I will add either garlic or oregano like others recommended or herbed feta.  Also want to try it with green or red peppers.  Again, great base recipe that allows the cook to adapt to their personal preferences.  Will make again!

Made it for 1 (me) for a quick and healthful lunch. With a glass of skim milk and a piece of toast it really hit the spot. Lots of cheese/vegetable variations come to mind, so I can use up those little bits of things in the fridge and still have a great luch. Thanks.

I'm really not a big fan of scrambled eggs... but i must say, adding the feta cheese really did make a huge difference. I had it with some bacon slices and a croissant. good. i don't think i'll be settling for plain scrambled eggs any time soon.

Tasty...I sauteed the onion in the butter, added a little milk and mayo to the egg with s/p. I though it was much better than just plain. Good for a dinner even.

This was a good, easy Sunday breakfast. I added spinach, and, like other reviewers, I topped the eggs with the tomatoes (I used grape for extra flavor). Next time, I'll add fresh oregano and mushrooms--yum!

These are yummy... a nice change of pace. I don't think the eggs needed more feta than what is called for. 2 Tbsp is just fine.

I decided to try this recipe being a huge feta fan. I used basil and sun-dried tomato feta to add more flavor. I didn't need to add any salt or pepper. (but then I did use mayo instead of milk). I sprinkled the tomatos on top AFTER cooking. It turned out great.

Very very tasty! This has the same ingredients as a feta omelet I make, but is easier to throw together than omelets for 2 people. Anyway, thanks! I'll definitely be making this again!
