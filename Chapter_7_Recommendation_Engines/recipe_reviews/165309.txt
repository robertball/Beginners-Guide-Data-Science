Oh my.  I love this!  Very strong flavors, so be sure you like olives and capers, but if you do, this is delicious!  I mixed everything together and put it in the fridge (the parts to my food processor were in the dishwasher), then processed it.  Love it so much I was eating it from the food processor without any bread.  Guess it's  a good thing I am the only one who eats olives in this house!  I didn't use just kalamata; I have a jar of assorted greek olives, so I used a few of each in the jar.  The hardest part was pitting the olives; I experimented with a few methods and settled on using my large knife by putting it on top of the olive and leaning on it with my body weight.  Squished out the pits perfectly.  Thanks for the recipe!  I'll make it again.  :o)

A good tapenade.  I used a Mediterranean olive mix, which worked fine.  If you're dumb like me and but olives with pits in them, just use a meat mallet to whack the olive and the pit comes right out!

I made this recipe exactly as it is listed and have enjoyed it again and again; I simply spread some on slices of french bread and sprinkle with a small amount of freshly shredded parmesan. Ymm ymm good. Note: When I first made this, I thought it was a bit too much (too salty and too much of the caper flavor), but after I stored it in my frig for a day and allowed it to set up, it was perfect!

It was very good but I would omit adding anymore salt since the olives and the capers are salty enough. I will make it again for sure.

I didn't have kalamata olives so I used a tin of green olives that I had on hand.  It turned out to be really tasty. My husband ate it all in one sitting.

Great recipe. Even better than the restaurant version that I'm used to! The flavor may be strong for some so what I do is add about 1 part black pearl olives and 3 parts kalamata olives.  The black olives are also cheaper so that also saves on the cost. Toast some bread and serve. YUM!

I have to echo another reviewers comment about the appearance.  I should have known better than to do this in a blender.  It looked like something from the bottom of a canal.  Yecch, grey muck.  I tossed it.  I'll retry but finely hand-chopped instead.

This was excellent!.. Just like the one I bought from a deli...  I left half of it chopped and pureed the other half for a chunkier look.  Served on crackers with cream cheese!..  I would say "don't" add any salt to this recipe because the kalamata olives  and capers are in a salty brine; I didn't add any salt and it was still quite salty!  Next time I make it I plan on adding some roasted red pepper.

Delicious and easy! I just used the spanish and large black olives you get in the jar for my first try because I was too lazy to go to the store. It was still great albeit a bit salty.  Can't wait to try with Kalamatas now!

This recipe is fantastic just as written.  It was a huge hit at Thanksgiving.  The next time I made it, I added 1/2c unpeeled chopped saut√©ed eggplant to make it stretch.

Great tapenade - I used as a spread on gourmet sandwiches - hummus on one side of the bread, tapenade on the other, fill with your favourite deli meats, top with some baby romaine -delish!  Even some of my friends who claim to be non-olive lovers actually loved it!  Highly recommend.

Tapenade has so many possible variations! In this recipe less is more, it is absolutely  Perfect as is. Just chiffonade some basil, cover a big fat tomato slice with buffalo mozzerela, and slather on the tapenade..... YUMMY !!!!

Pungent but good flavor, albeit a little on the "sharp" side.  I think it could benefit from reducing the amount of both the lemon juice and garlic.  Not its best on its own - this is best served, I think, with something to "mellow" it out some; perhaps sliced mozzarella or a creamy dip or spread.

This was fabulous! and even better, it was fabulously easy!  I made this for a NewYears party where the host had gluten/soy/dairy allergies.  This was a safe dish and it was a huge hit!  Everyone raved about it and couldn't believe it was homemade.  Thank you!

I make this exactly as written and it's delicious. I often bring it to parties and it's always a hit. Great with whole grain bread, hummus, roasted red peppers and mozzarella, feta or goat cheese. 
I buy the kalamata olives at the warehouse store with pits in them because they are much cheaper.  I whack them a couple times with the Slap Chop & the pits come out easily.

This was so easy and very good.  I didn't have any fresh parsley so I omitted it and dish was still gobbled up by guests.  I will definitley make this again.  I may try it on crostini with goat cheese sprinkled on top and then baked in the oven as a variation next time.

A big hit with family and friends.  I took the advice of rinsing the olives first and that really helped calm down the saltiness.

Great, simple recipe. I soaked the kalamata in water for about 15 min to remove some saltiness.  (Let dry afterwards).  Cut garlic in half 'cause we don't like heavy garlic. Served over a spread of white bean dip on thin slices of baquette. YUM.

My friend made this for me a long while back and I was craving it again and came across this recipe. This is just as good as hers! The flavors are very strong, but they don't fight each other, they work together. I warmed up the olives in the oven for about 10 mins at 300F before blending them. It was really nice to have it warm. Didn't change anything else. I also did not use any salt, you won't need it. I will definitely make this again since it's so easy and everyone loves it.

Made this and the Sundried Tomato Tapenade (also from here) for a party. The general comment was "This is good - if you really like olives." It's quite rich, and nobody had more than one or two servings. So... this is good, but I'd only recommend it for olive lovers.

Try adding a can of black olives to tone down the flavor.  I also substituted lime juice for lemon with no ill effects.

I serve this over a brick of cream cheese. It cuts the saltiness slightly and the flavors meld well.

YUM! I left out the capers, but it's so yummy! It has a very strong flavor- I think I may have put in too much garlic. But I love it :)

I am making a recipe for dinner that called for olive tapenade as an ingredient.  I thought I had a jar in the fridge but I guess I used it all.  Rather than drive to the store, I figured I could make something instead.  And sure enough, I found this recipe and I had all the ingredients.  DO NOT add additional salt as the olives and capers are salty enough.  I went a little overboard on the lemon juice too, so be careful of that.  (I just drained it before letting the flavors meld in the fridge before dinner.)  Thanks for an easy yet delicious recipe, Teresita79!

This is super easy!  Made it as written but used only one Tbsp. of capers (was not sure if I would like them).   Very pungent flavors, have to of course like olives, but would definitely make again.

My husband made this and it was certainly yummy.  We didn't add the salt as it was very salty already.  We added a few scoops of feta cheese and a fig, and it helped to tone down the saltiness.

I made this as one of my Thanksgiving appetizers and everyone liked it; I don't like parsley so I made it without. This is very strong, both in garlic as well as olive flavor, but that's what makes it so good! I toasted french bread and cut it into chunks for dipping. Will definitely make again!

Wonderful!  I skipped the capers (none in the house) and used a mix of olives. Next time I'm doubling the recipe. Yum.

I really enjoyed this recipe and would only suggest that the need for salt is non-existent.  A light touch with the parsley and lemon juice is needed as too much of either might ruin the tapenade.

Tried this after reading Wheat Belly, where the author recommends tapenade as a good topping for a variety of foods. Had never heard of it, but I know I love kalamatas in Greek salads. Didn't have parsley, so that was omitted, as well as the salt. YUM! I hada large scoop on my scrambled eggs, then wanted more, so I spread it on sliced cucumbers. This will definitely be a staple. Love the strong flavors. I picked up my pitted olives at Costco pretty reasonably. 1.7 lb. drained weight for $8.

Omitted the salt because the kalamatas and capers have plenty in the brine. I had italian parsley on hand and don't know if that makes a difference with flavor vs. the regular curly parsley but this was incredibly delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe and so easy to make. I followed the recipe but used jalepeno stuffed olives, cilantro (instead of parsley), no capers, salt or pepper, and two big cloves of garlic - turned out so good. Making watermelon canapes tonight - slice of watermelon, topped with olive tapenade, and a slice of goat brie on top. Yum!!

Made this to take to a cocktail party the other night...was not happy with my results.  I followed the recipe exactly and thought the taste was way too sharp...the lemon juice overpowered and (I can't believe I'm saying this) there was too much garlic.  In an effort to save the recipe, I added an extra dash of olive oil, then kalamata olives and finally a small can of plain chopped black olives to try to tone it down a bit.  Was sad that it did not turn out after all the great reviews.  :(

This is so delicious. I love kalamata tampenade, and this is perfect...... Some said it was salty -  it is essential to rinse the capers.

This was a great recipe!  Made it up two days a head of time so the flavors of all the ingredients would marry. Put it out for my guests at the Xmas party served with breadsticks, ritz, crackers and triskets. It was gobbled up fast! They loved it. Do not skip the fresh lemon juice or the capers. I cut the little tips off the garlic and put th in my mini processor and pulsed til minced. I DRAINED my capers and olives but reserved the juices in case tapenade was too dry. The key to getting a rough to small chop is pulsing the processor until desired texture is acheived. Don't just turn on and let it run or you will get a puree.  Trying it with canned black olives this next time around.

This is an awesome recipe. My guests and I loved it. Tastes just as good as any store bought tapenade I've purchased but was very easy to make at home!

I had some leftover olives from a recipe and did a search and found this. I didn't have kalamata just the regular canned version to use. I liked the recipe. I didn't have fresh parsley but added a scant Tblsp. of dried. I am sure the fresh would have been much better. I blended it all in my blender and added a pinch of Kosher salt. I realized, after I made it, that it listed capers. I don't like capers anyhow so it worked fine for me. I liked the fact that it only made one cup. That is rare with many recipes. The downside is the color. It is almost a grayish color, which isn't very appetizing looking, but the flavor is still good anyhow. I ate it with crackers, but it would be good on some thin toasted bread to.

Delicious, easy, inexpensive, impressive, and relatively healthy - it can't get much better than that!  My partner even liked it, the man who earlier in the day said he didn't like tapenade.  

I made very minor changes: (1) Didn't add any salt, (2) Added the capers after I'd pulled the mixture from the blender so they remained whole, and (3) We didn't have quite enough kalamata olives so I used about 3/4 kalamata and 1/4 black Spanish olives.  Oh, and I pulled some roasted garlic from the freezer rather than using raw.  Does this make it a whole new recipe?  Heh.

I'll be making this again with various olive combinations to see what happens.

Loved it! I am a big olive tapenade fan...when the local warehouse store ran out I decided to make my own...I followed this recipe but used pimento stuffed manzanilla and black olives because that's what I had on hand...I love the color from this combination and I also added a couple of anchovies...this turned out just as good or maybe even better than the store bought brand and because I made it from scratch I was able to control the amount of oil used because I think the store bought band is way too oily!! great recipe thanks for sharing and because this turned out so well I will not be buying tapenade again since this was soooooo easy to make from scratch!!

I didn't add ANY salt at all and it still was too salty.  Maybe less capers or a blend of different olives can make this less salty.

This is the best tapenade EVER!  I have made this several times and everyone loves it and asks for the recipe.  Those who aren't familiar with tapenade love it, and those who love tapenade think mine tastes like the upscale restaurant's version!  Thanks so much for sharing!

Very tasty.  Thanks for the tip of pitting olives w/ a meat mallat.  Saved me a few $s and worked great!  Don't skip the lemon juice.  Adds a lot.  I used Vinta crackers, which stood up very well to this topping.  It's great spread w/ goat cheese and the tapenade on top.

I followed the directions exactly, and was very happy with the results! I don't think it was too strong, in fact my 4-year-old could hardly stay away from it. The tapenade was wonderful paired with hummus and pita bread.

My mom gave me a huge Costco size jar of Kalamatas and I wondered what I would do with them all.  I have now made this twice and it is fantastic.  I serve it with butter crackers or baguette and herbed goat cheese.  People kept saying, "So you made this?"  I like that it is so easy but tastes so special.

Okay - I admit I made an ingredient change - but this recipe is soooo good!  I don't like capers, and I like anchovies, so I subbed the anchovies for the capers.  Other than that, I chose this recipe because the mix of ingredients appealed to me.  I am so glad I did!  We couldn't get enough of it!

Very easy to make and is oh so nummy.  I didn't add salt as I figured the olives & capers were enough.  I forgot to add pepper but will next time. And next time I might try adding some fresh basil or another of the herbs I'm currently growing.

I made this as an appetizer for a group of people. Everyone really enjoyed this. I followed the recipe as is, it had a strong flavor but had lots of positive comments.

This is delicious! Thank you for the wonderful recipe. I made no modifications; however, I also did not add any additional salt. My suggestion is to pair this recipe with the "Authentic Kicked-Up Syrian Hummus" recipe also found on this site - putting the two on a platter is an impressive and fantastic appetizer plate. Both recipes are excellent, fast and easy. I received rave reviews and took a clean plate home!

Very strong flavors, but definitely delicious. Mix with cream cheese for a lighter flavor. I made this for a family Christmas gathering, and it was gone before I even arrived there!

This is GLORIOUS. I minced it all down by hand and included 2 anchovies for good measure. I did not have any fresh parsley on hand so I just added a touch of the dried stuff. After an overnight marinade the flavor was incredible. This is definitely a keeper, I will be making this over and over again. Thank you for your recipe.

This recipe is incredible! Usually, I follow tips and suggestions from the reviewers, but for this recipe, I didn't need to change a thing. Some people are complaining about how the recipe does not look appealing; it's olive tapenade, for heavens sake! If you want it to look "pretty," add some fresh parsley leaves with halved kalamata olives on top. We baked a hot baguette to spread it on, and my boyfriend loved the tapenade so much he ate it by itself!

This was my first experience with kalamata olives, and I wasn't thrilled. The flavor was so much stronger than I expected but that doesn't make it a bad recipe. If I make this again, I will rinse the olives first - I've been told this is a must???

Tried this with kalamata, green and black olives. I thought it was way too lemony. Seems like it was missing something. Still edible though. Good for mixing into other dishes.

Great recipe!  I added 1/2 of a roasted red pepper and reduced the lemon juice in 1/2 since the pepper has that tang to it.  I also only used 2 instead of 3 garlic cloves.  Tastes just as good as the tapenade I get at a local restaurant :)

I'm not 100% on this recipe. Maybe the flavors are too strong, but I found this tasted very tart and acidic -- perhaps from the capers and lemon juice. It seems to need something to balance it out. Perhaps it's the quality of the kalamata olives I used. Perhaps it just doesn't suit my taste buds.

I made this recently, as I was having a few guests over. The only change I made was to use dried parsley as I had no fresh.  One lady who proclaimed to have an avid dislike for olives loved this!!  She was eating it off a spoon!!  Everyone else raved about it.  There were no leftovers. I will definitely make this again. I already bought more kalamata olives!!

Great flavor!  I used a mini food processor and used the pulse function so it was more choppy in appearance.  Serving it with toasted pita bread and crusty toasted french bread also with bruchetta.

This was very good.  I omitted the salt as olives and capers are already salty.  I did half kalamata olives and have green olives with pimento.  Great on top of black bean hummus!!

Delicious dip. Based on suggestions from other reviews, I chopped half the Olives by hand and put half in the blender with the other ingredients. It made for a prettier dip.  I doubled the recipe. I only used 5 vs. 6 garlic cloves and still felt the garlic was too strong and overpowered the olives. I didn‚Äôt have capers so I added about 4-5 large  green olives. Still delicious and will make this again.

Soooo good! We added roasted red peppers and substituted about 1/4 of the Kalamata olives with green olives and added no salt. We spread cream cheese on Italian bread and topped with the tapenade. Loved this recipe.

Super EASY!!  I use my immersion blender, then freeze 1 Tbsp dollops on wax paper, store in a ziplock, then just use one at a time to season Greek feta burgers.  So delish!  It makes 9 Tbsp.

I have a super tiny food processor, and this was the perfect size! I used half kalamata and half green olives for variety. Garlic was a little much - make sure the 3 cloves are three little cloves, or just use 2!

Very good. I had a recipe for olive tapendade, but lost it. I really like this! One thing I didn't have was the capers, but I thought it was really good without them. Next time, I will try it with them!

I love this recipe! I have made it twice and am making a double batch now. I am not adding salt this time as the second time it was too salty. I always add extra garlic but I usually do that no matter what the recipe says. This time I used extra virgin olive oil. This recipe is delicious the way it is though.  I just like to experiment.

No processor??? No worries!! I've made this a few times now and I don't have a processor - I just finely chop everything; I like the somewhat chunky texture and besides - it doesn't look as disgusting! I have done all kalamata and an olive mix - both are good. Press the garlic. Make it a day ahead so it can mellow in the fridge overnight. Husband and guests LOVE this tapenade!

Soo good! I may cut the garlic down a little as it was a little strong and I omitted the salt since the capers and olives are full of it! It was super easy to make and has so much flavor, definatley recommend if you like olives!

This is my first tapenade. I've always bought it, but since moving to rural Idaho, I've found a lack of options at the grocer. I can't knock the recipe too much, because I only loosely followed it. But I did want to offer my experiences. Like other reviewers, I did not blend it, bc i prefer a chunkier tapenade. I also added black olives and pimento stuffed green olives to add color. I did not add any additional salt and I found mine came out too salty. For reference, the kalamata and pimento stuffed olives I put in had between 210 and 240 mg sodium per 4-5 olives. The black olives had less, so I added more.  Next time I will look for lower sodium content in the olives I use. Hope this helps!

Mmmm, really good!  You definitely need to like olives and capers because it's a strong tasting dish. But oh so good!  Pretty salty on it's own, do not add salt, just pepper.  Our vegan and gluten intolerant friends loved it!  I served it on sliced baguette, but like other reviewers suggestions to add goat or cream cheese while serving it to cut down the saltiness a bit. That would complement it well. Thanks for sharing!

I made this as part of a trio with homemade roasted red pepper hummus and tzatziki. I also made homemade pita chips, carrots, and celery. It was a huge hit. Absolutely no salt was needed and maybe next time i might quick rinse the olives and capers.

I made this to use as a spread to jazz up plain chicken sandwiches for a cold meal on a hot summer night, and eh...I made it exactly per the recipe (except for halving it for my small family), and it was very sharply garlicky. I love garlic, but it was a bit much for both myself and the hubs. Also, I agree with others that it needed no extra salt, cause I was very glad after tasting it that I had chosen not to add any more. The capers and the lemon are dominant flavors, but the garlic should definitely be finely minced or put in as a paste via a microplane before you make it in the food processor, cause the garlic overpowers the spread. I may try this again with my ideas of modifications, but I doubt it, given the cost of kalamata olives in my area. Sorry, this one isn't going into my faves.

really intense delicious flavor. I didn't bother adding salt as capers are already extremely salty. Just a few shakes of pepper. I've used different olives with this and it works out great. Thanks for sharing!

Not bad. I used fresh cilantro as I didn't have parsley, omitted the salt, and added some green greek olives with roasted red peppers. As others said, it was very salty but I figured the bf wouldn't mind, as he loves salt. I mixed the tapenade with some pasta sauce and served over rotini. It was good but I don't think I'd make it again, as the bf didn't care for it and there's no way I could eat an entire batch by myself.

As written, this tapenade is very good but *very* acidic, so I deducted a star.  The second time, I reduced the lemon juice to less than 1/2 teaspoon and it was still more than tangy enough for me.  I do not think salt or pepper are needed, but did not deduct any stars as that is written "to taste."

I served it on crostini, with a slice of tomato and some feta, and it was delicious.  Next time, I may try a bit of cream cheese on the crostini before I spread on the tapenade, or I may just do half kalamata, half black olives.  

I definitely recommend it, although I would suggest reducing the lemon juice unless you are using a mix of kalamata and black olives.

Amazing!  I do mine in a mini food processor and it‚Äôs perfect.  This is the best kalamata tapenade recipe I have used!  Quite often, I add some fresh jalape√±o, nice touch.  I just use enough to flavor it without making it hot.  This is

My husband and I make this all the time. A slight variation is to add mayo to make more of a dressing or dip. We use it on a baguette or a side with roasted potatoes. Jan

Almost spot-on (YMWV, this is according to my tastes, of course!)  I added a clove of garlic because I'm a garlic addict, substituted basil for parsley because that's what I had, backed off the olive oil and lemon to 1 tbsp each (it was still plenty moist.)  Finally, added a pinch - perhaps 1/8 tsp - smoked paprika.  I used this variation as a relish with grilled chicken breast.  This recipe's a keeper, will keep tinkering, as it has endless potential.

I‚Äôve made this but put a great twist to it. I blended it in my mixer with 16oz of creamy goat cheese to made a great spreadable treat. The goat cheese cuts thru the over saltness that comes from the olives, and since a cheese spread you minus the lemon juice in that it will my the cheese spoil. It may sound off the wall but I work in a cheese shop and all my customer rave about it and when I don‚Äôt have it are like ‚Äúdarn that was good‚Äù. Try it and let me know what y‚Äôall think.

It was extremely salty so I added extra parsley and some almonds that I had on hand.  I also added a bit more lemon juice to try to cut the salt.  It was ok after I did that.

So delicious! I only made minor changes- half the lemon juice, finely chopped the ingredients rather than blending,  and rinsed the olives and capers well. Oh, I also felt it was salty enough so I did not add any additional. Very good appetizer!

Other reviewer suggestions were helpful.  To achieve nicely chopped olives & avoid the "canal bottom" sludge appearance (thanks 4 the laugh, Charlie B!), I put rinsed pitted olives - one can at a time - in the Ninja container with enough plain water to 2/3rds full so the olives could move freely, then pulsed the power button just until the olives were rough-chopped, drained  them in a sieve, dumped them in a large mixing bowl and repeated the process using 3 cans of green olives & 2 cans of black olives, roasted red peppers, capers, garlic, thyme, oregano, Dijon mustard, S&P, lime juice, a small squirt of Sriracha and oil to nearly cover it.  (1/3 EVOO to 2/3 canola since EVOO solidifies under refrigeration and I wanted to avoid that.)  Refrigerated several hours to let the flavors marry.  Liking it as a topper on broiled salmon as well as zucchini 'noodles.'

I made it and I used mixed pitted olives. I would add that the olive brine and vinager from the capers were strong and would suggest rising both the olives and capers to avoid a overly salty and vinagery flavor.  You can always add more of both later.

Toasted sourdough slices over the grill as meat cooked, rubbed toasts w garlic and drizzled with good Greek olive oil, thin-ish layer of tapenade--oh my--heaven on toast! Don't add salt until you've tasted it. Olives and capers may be enough.

I may have used "He-Man" garlic, but WOW. I kept having to add blander black olives to try to overcome the overpowering garlic and caper  favors. Next time I'll start with less and add as needed. I love tapenade, so once toned down it was very good.

This was pretty good.  I used basil instead of parsley and cut back the capers to 1 tablespoon just based on personal taste.  A lot of reviewers said this was too salty, but it wasn't for us.  I had to add salt as the recipe states. The lemon juice cuts the saltiness of the olives and capers.  It's a nice quick, easy recipe.

Delicious!  I have just put this together, and as I couldn't resist, I tasted it immediately - so good!  I think it will be even better after it has sat in the fridge for a bit to "meld".  Following the suggestions of other users, I made the following modifications: I did not put in the blender, but rather finely chopped everything by hand, I subbed in a handful of black olives to mellow out the flavor (plus, as we are olive lovers and always have lots, I tossed in a few green olives too!) and I didn't add any additional salt.  Also, as I did not have fresh parsley I added 1 tbsp of dried - seems fine!  Really good, thanks for posting!

This was a very good recipe.  But, I have to agree with a previous reviewer that the lemon makes it a bit "sharp."  Next time, I would put in 1/2 to 3/4 of the lemon juice and see if that mellows it enough.  I also omitted the salt.  Another small change was that I blended all of the ingredients together into a puree, except for the olives.  I hand chopped them and recommend others do as well.  I will be making this one again.  I love how I can make a big batch and don't have to rely on the little jar at Trader Joe's anymore!

Beautiful! In my opinion, there is no need to add salt - though I did add some black pepper, and I doubled the lemon juice.  Then I pulsed it in my food processor - beautifully dark and chunky.  I'm serving it with crumbled feta on top and a sprig of fresh parsley.  Thanks for this gem of a recipe.

Made this for a wine tasting party.  Everyone loved it!  Because the olives and capers are already kind of salty, I did not add any additional salt.  Perfect!

Out of this world!!  My new favorite appetizer and snack.  If you are in love with olives and garlic as much as I am, then look no further, this it it!  Thank you so much for an outstanding recipe!  I think this would also be a nice spread for panini's or any other kind of pita sandwiches.  You could add some to pasta, chicken or fish for a nice strong flavor.  For blending, I used my little ninja processor and it turned out to be a perfect consistency.

Definitely agree.  I used this to stuff a chicken breast with some goat cheese.  Definitely don't add salt.  Based on other reviews, I subbed half a can of black olives with the pitted kalamatas.  I rinsed these with water and drained, also rinsed the capers as suggested.  I don't have fresh parsley, so used 3 tsp of dried.  EXCELLENT.  Will be showing this off at my next dinner party!

I also added chopped anchovies, but you can also use a 1/2 T of anchovy paste.

I used fresh basil instead of parsley and it turned out really good. I also added a table spoon of plain greek yogurt, to make it a little richer. Had some friends over and they didn't leave much of it left in the dish, so it seems they liked it!

This is a very strong and unique dish!  I‚Äôm not a big olive fan but now and again I enjoy the taste and this dip fits the bill perfectly when these strong food cravings hit. This is great served with an old cheddar and red wine!  If you like olives you have to give this a try.

So easy and delicious!  I've made this tapenade every year for New Years parties 3 years running, and I always get people asking if I'm bringing it this year and rave reviews. If you have any leftovers, it's also really delicious mixed in with tomato sauce to top your pasta.  I usually double the recipe, and use green olives for the 2nd cup of olives.  I also nix the salt as I find the olives and capers to be salty enough, and use slightly less garlic than is called for, as it can turn out (can't believe I'm saying this) too garlicky.  I serve with a sliced up French baguette.

Excellent! Halved the capers, and only 2 cloves of garlic, was perfect.  Today I added 3 tablespoons of the tapenade to my breadmaker and made a gorgeous olive bread with it! Thank you!  A keeper!

This was excellent and super easy. The texture turned out perfect for me, not runny or soupy. I added the olive/caper/garlic ingredients to mini processor and pulsed a few times. Oh- I also added some jarred roasted red pepper for added color. Anyway, I poured the lemon juice and olive oil over the chopped ingredients and stirred. I think adding those beforehand would have made it like an applesauce texture. I will definitely make this again!

This is amazing!  Didn't add the parsley because I didn't have any on hand but we did add in feta cheese!!!  It was so amazing served on warm bagel slices!
