The recipe is almost authentic - i say almost because Indians use garam masala and not curry powder. I don't add yogurt to my baingan bharta, but adding it isn't a sin, i wouldn't heat the dish after adding yogurt. Also, the eggplant is usually fire roasted and the smokey flavor is just outstanding. Also a small teaspoon of lemon juice in the end brings all the flavors out.

great recipe. I am second generation Indian and this is one of my favorite dishes. I made the eggplant the day before just to save time; I cut it in half lengthwise, sprayed the cut side with Pam, and then baked it on a foil lined cookie sheet, cut side down. I baked it for 20 minutes or so and it was so tender that I just scraped it out of the skin with a spoon. I used a can of plum tomatoes instead of a tomato, and cut the tomatoes into a small dice. I saved the liquid and added it to the dish right before I started to simmer it. I also added about a cup of frozen baby peas at the same time as the eggplant. Used ginger paste and minced garlic. Great recipe.

This recipe is terrific- I'd give it 6 stars if I could!  This is my new favorite way to use eggplant- I love the combination of veggies. I made it as a side with chicken curry and spinach paneer (frozen entree)and rice- the eggplant stole the show!  I used a medium eggplant- didn't bother peeling, just scooped out the cooked inards and chopped them up with a spoon.  I added 3/4 jalapeno in with the onion, thinking otherwise it would be too spicy, but it was not.  Thought yogurt might separate when cooked so aggressively, but it did not!  I didn't have ginger-garlic paste, just added a little fresh of each.  Easy and healthy!  Serve to all of your vegetarian friends!

This is a recipe that made a great authentic (so it seemed to me) dish!  I used 1/2 tbsp. minced ginger and 1/2 tbsp. minced garlic instead of garlic paste.

Easy recipe. The eggplant was very mushy after being baked for 20 minutes. The actual dish was very tasty. I added the yogurt to the curry after it was cooked and slightly cooled. I would make it again only I would do it with two eggplants to add more "meat" to the final dish.

Not having much experience with cooking Indian food I was wary of trying this recipe but it turned out GREAT. My husband and I loved it. The only thing I couldn't find was garlic ginger paste, so i made my own in the food processor (just blended together 1 tbs garlic and same amount ginger).

I just tried out this recipe and it was pretty tasty. I modified it a bit because I forgot to print out the recipe. I chopped the eggplant in small pieces and simmered them in chopped onions, garlic, olive oil, chopped tomatoes, cumin, coriander and ginger. Then I more or less pureed it with a hand blender and then added the plain yogurt. I then served it over steamed vegetables and brown rice. 

Your recipe came out great nonetheless.

This was amazing! There used to be a restaurant in Westwood that I would trek up to for this dish, but alas, they closed down thanks to this bum economy.. =(  This recipe saved the day though!  I made a couple changes after the dry run after following some other reviews.  I bake the eggplant until it's tender, and just scrape it out of the skin with a spoon.  Also, I add petite frozen peas at the same time as the eggplant because that's the way it was made at the restaurant I used to go to. As for the curry powder, I used garam masala instead, which is an Indian spice blend that really makes it authentic.  And if you find the flavors are too strong, mix in some yogurt after you're done cooking or let it stand overnight.  (Mine was much more mild the next day, but tasted more cohesive - if that makes any sense to anyone other than me...)

Very yummy - probably not something most kids will like, as it's spicy and has that yogurt tang.  Made it for a party and it was well received.

Very Good! Next time I will bake the eggplant a liitle longer or slice it in half first. I would have liked it to cook up so much you can't really distinguish the pieces. In our area you can get canned diced tomatoes with jalapenos so I drained about half a can and used this as a short cut. Will make this again.

Very nice. I cut the oil back to 1 Tbsp, and next time I'll do the same---but use a non-stick pan. I didn't have jalapenos or cilantro---turned out fantastic nonetheless. I followed another reviewer's suggestion to use minced garlic and fresh ginger in place of the ginger/garlic paste. Very pleased with the results.

The dish was delicious, no doubt, but there are some problems: 1 eggplant adds almost nothing at all - certainly not enough for 4-6 servings. I had to use 3 eggplants and even though I only doubled (not tripled) the rest of the ingredients, the spice and taste of garlic and ginger overwhelmed the meal. However, the end product still shows enough promise to try some alterations next time.

Love Love Love this!  I made some slight changes which I think brought this recipe to the next level.  First, I peeled, sliced and salted the eggplant and let it sit on some paper towels for about an hour to get some of the moisture out.  I then sauteed the eggplant in some olive oil for about 5 minutes and set aside.  Next I got going with steps 3 & 4.  I upped the spices by a lot, I never measure spices so I'm not really sure by how much, but at least triple.  I used a full 28 oz can of whole peeled tomatoes (I cut the tomatoes up first).  Next I added the eggplant back in along with some Seitan I had sitting in the fridge that I needed to use up.  Let is cook for probably 20-25 minutes.  Served over rice.  My hubby said it was one of the best meals I have ever cooked.  Can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch today!!

This was a very bland meal, and I followed the recipe exactly. I love Indian food and seem to be trying all of the local Indian restaurants around as well. I'm a very experienced cook, so it isn't like a rookie was giving this a go. It could have to do with the cooking on high heat for 10 minutes, because it left a nice burned bottom on my pan. Anyway, won't be cooking this again, sorry Yakuta.

Really nice recipe.  I was hesitant to try this as we are not vegetarians but my partner and I found this to be a very satisfying dinner.  Made the recipe as written with the exception of using one 14.5 oz can of tomatoes in place of the diced tomatoe and substituting chopped parsley for the cilantro.  Teamed this up with the Carrot Rice recipe from this site.  Excellent low calorie healthy dinner.

I thought this was DELICIOUS!!! I really honestly cant stand eggplant but I've been getting a lot with my CSA and have no other choice but to eat it or waste it. This is so good. I made a few changes because I always do.  I used two small eggplant instead of one large. I also cut up (and baked in the oven along with the eggplant) some white potatoes. If I didnt have the potatoes it wouldnt have been very much food.  I didn't have any chiles so I used some curry paste I had around to give it a little spice as well as some chile powder.  I did not add curry powder and I used Ginger powder instead of ginger since I didnt have any!  I love the way the yogurt gives the eggplant a nice sweet taste and I would eat this again and again. We actually fought over the leftovers :)   We served it over rice!

Excellent! I added mushrooms and substituted pressed garlic and minced ginger (in equal proportions) for the ginger garlic paste. My boyfriend who spent quite a bit of time in India loved it and told me it was the most authentic dish I had made yet. I will be making this again both as a vegetarian and meat based dish.

This is the dish I always order at Indian restaurants and I honestly didn't think this was going to compare. But it did.  I followed all the directions, but substituted garam masala spice (there's a recipe on this site) for the curry and added Cardamom seed, which I often taste in restaurant dishes.  It was out of this world!  Will be making repeatedly.

Good base recipe. I baked my eggplant as stated, used a can of tomatoes, and used two jalepenos and one small red pepper and one can of chickpeas. I omitted the yogurt and cilantro because I didn't have any. (Next time I'll definitely add the cilantro.) Made a tasty substantial dish with the right amount of heat. Brought to a potluck and served it over white rice. Received good reviews. Will make again using what curry appropriate veggies are on hand.

Great base recipe. I am always looking for a way to use up eggplant from the garden and this combined one of my favorite veggies with one of my favorite cuisines!   I diced up the eggplant (skin intact), salted it, let it drain, and baked on a cookie sheet for 15 minutes. In retrospect, I would forgo draining as the extra liquid was needed.   I added a tablespoon of garam masala paste, extra minced garlic, and a teaspoon of fresh grated ginger to the base recipe. I did not use salt other than what I used when I baked the eggplant. I also added the yogurt at the end of cook time, based on recommendations.   Really, really delicious! Color, flavor, aroma... this recipe has it all! Thank you!

Wow! For all of the eggplant haters in my family that ate this last night and had seconds--kudos to you Yakuta! I simmered this delicious combination for 2 hours and the flavor was fabulous. I added a bit more broth and an additional teaspoon of cumin powder for a punch more of flavor. Great recipe, one that will be added to my recipe file.

WOW! First off, thank you for the recipe. Secondly, thank you to all who have made this recipe before for your tips and suggestions!

I made a half batch of this recipe. Baked the eggplant for 26 minutes, came easily from the peel with a spoon. I used Olive Oil and I also did the fresh ginger/garlic minced up together (instead of the paste). I stuck to the rest of the recipe as 'laid out'.

My only 'complaint' is the 10 minutes at high heat. I was using my large burner with a stainless steel pot. I had the heat at 8 (of 10), and wondered if that was high enough. Well, the mix burned to the bottom of the pot! I lowered to 7 for the remainder of cook time.

Even with that 1 'glitch', the end result was fabulous!! I did the yogurt in the mix per the original instruction, and it turned out great! I have leftovers for tomorrow... which I was tempted to eat tonight after 1 serving vanished from my plate.

Will make again, thank you so, so much again for this recipe!! Delicious and fulfilling!

Used coconut flavoured yogurt and it tasted just fine - but indian family members said it had a flavour they couldn't put their finger on - and that traditionally they don't use yogurt or sour cream at all.

I first made this in a kitchen that wasn't mine and I had limited resources. I am still not sure what ginger garlic paste is- so i just combined pressed garlic and ginger. I didn't have yogurt so I added a splash of sour cream and had only jarred peppers. and added parsley instead.  I know that this changes a lot of initial flavors, but I'm convinced that the recipe as written is amazing.  Maybe could have used an addition of a protein like chickpeas

I used 1 tbsp minced garlic  and 1.5 tsp dried ginger in place of the garlic paste, and I left out the yogurt (because I forgot) and the jalepeno (didn't have one). I also left the skin on the eggplant after roasting it at 450 for 30 minutes. It turned out fantastic!

I'm giving this recipe a five because of the way I made it. It was a three until we added curry paste and it made ALL the difference in the world!   First the changes: We followed the recipe almost exactly except for that I couldn't find any ginger garlic paste, so I finely minced ginger and garlic and essentially made the paste myself. The only other change was that I've used curry powder in the past, and it never has enough flavor/kick so I substituted garam masala. I also ended up baking the eggplant for 20 minutes, which seemed to be perfect. Lastly, we added spicy curry paste.  Now the complaints: Be careful when cooking it on high for 10 minutes because it began to burn a tiny bit on the bottom. It's a good idea to mix it up halfway through. It smelled delicious when we were making it, but when we tried it something seemed wrong. It was just so bland and had this odd yogurt taste that dominated the dish. We had some curry paste laying around and added that and the dish became fantastic! I'm not sure if we would have gotten the same results by just leaving out the yogurt, but it worked out nicely and is a dish I will absolutely be making again!  Next time I will also add some peas into the mix! (And possibly cut the salt in half)

It was okay. Was a bit disappointed that it wasn't as flavorful as I thought it was going to be based on the reviews. It needed to create some sort of sauce to help complete the meal.

Not bad. Will cook it again some time but I don't think it will blow away my Indian in-laws who are used to the real stuff.
I used garam masala instead of curry powder and added some coconut and brown sugar as our tomatos are pretty tasteless.

I love this recipe and it's one of my meat loving husband's favourites!  I do make quite a few modifications, as we like lots of flavour!  I usually use 2 eggplants (diced then roasted in olive oil and salt) plus what ever other vege i have handy like cauliflower, beans or potato  (also roasted).  I double cumin, ginger, garlic and curry powder, use a tin of tomatoes instead of fresh, and add the yogurt as a side on the plate rather than cook it.    All these changes probably make it far from authentic, but after making this dish regularly this is how we like it best.  Thanks for sharing Yakuta!

Excellent with some turmeric and mustard seeds fried up w/ the ginger/garlic. Added some zucchini and squash to bulk it up. Did a simmer/fry version rather than bake, smelled incredible, tasted the same. Served over green lentils.

This is a great recipe for a traditional Indian dish, but you can also get great results with fewer ingredients.  My roots are from Fiji; we don't always put masala (curry powder) in veggie dishes.   I often omit cumin seeds, ginger, masala and yogurt.  Follow the procedure as described, but sprinkle a little lemon juice and ground cumin at the end.  Sometimes I cook it down to a smooth consistency and use it as a dip like baba ghanoush (sp?).  This is the only way to get my DH to eat eggplant.

A bit more time than estimated was expended in the preparation (more like 1.75 hrs). Also, not as tasty/spicy as other versions I have tasted in the past. But nice recipe overall.

Due to the lack of ingredients on hand, I used cumin powder in place of cumin seeds; garlic powder in place of ginger garlic paste; omitted the tomato,  jalapeno chile pepper and cilantro....and it still turned out great!

Good recipe overall. Doesn't specify garlic:ginger ratio for garlic ginger paste, but I did 1:1. Didn't have whole cumin seeds; used ground cumin. Didn't have yogurt; used sour cream thinned with a little water.  Only used 1 heaping tsp of curry powder, but was waaay to spicy for my toddler & spouse, but we tamed it with more sour cream on their plates. Might depend on your particular curry powder, though, so I'd suggest adding sparingly to begin with and adding more as needed.

This recipe was absolutely delicious!  Never made curry before and it came out great.  Love eggplant so I'm always looking for recipes that feature eggplant as the main ingredient.  Have to say, I did a little switch...didn't have plain yoghurt so I used 1/2 cup of lowfat cream cheese instead....made the curry lip-smacking good.  I'm still smiling from the blending of flavors!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Everyone, including my 1.5 year old liked this.  She loves eggplant but has been very picky a bout foods with a lot of flavor lately.  I decided to make this anyway, my husband and I love Indian cuisine.  Because it was such a hot day instead of baking the eggplant I added olive oil to a frying pan and placed the Japanese eggplant, that I had cut into large chunks, into the hot oil and cooked until tender flipping as not to burn it.   I had to make the garlic ginger paste using 3 cloves of garlic, ground ginger and salt.  I used a cubanelle paper in place of the jalapeno and added chili powder for spice.

this is an amazing recipe!!! I am eating it right now :).. I took one star off for a few reasons.  I think there should be 2 eggplant in this.  Also, I think coconut milk is more traditional than yogurt, so that's what I used.  Like other reviewers, my pan burnt on the bottom during the 10 minutes of high heat.   I will definitely be making this again!!   I used a 14oz can of tomatoes, but next time would double it :)  yum!!!

Came out a little yogurt-y and blander than I'd hoped. Next time I'll use less yogurt, more jalapeno, and try using japanese eggplants (smaller and sweeter) than the large kind. Still pretty tasty.

Very nice. Used garam masala, which did feel like a better fit. Didn't use lemon juice at the end, which in retrospect would probably have made even better.

I liked this very much, but would change a few things when I make it again. It was fairly mushy, probably because my eggplant wasn't big enough. In the future, I will stir fry the eggplant, remove, and then follow the recipe. In the picture, it appears that the skin of the eggplant was left, altho' the recipe calls for removing it. Skin stays on next time I make it (I like eggplant that way). And I like the suggestion about garam masala. Maybe both. Really a keeper recipe!

I messed up this recipe cuz I didn't have ginger garlic paste.  However, I loved the way it tasted without it, so next time I will have the ginger garlic paste and I have the feeling I will like it even better!  Served it to myself over rice (boyfriend doesn't like curry--too bad for him!).

Pretty close to the flavor of my favorite version that I had at a restaurant in Berkeley, CA.  It's great to be able to make this at home, and it's a hearty vegetarian dish to flesh out my weeknight rotation.

This recipe was just ok. I think it would have been better if the eggplant was more finely chopped or even pureed. I will try this again.

I found this recipe on a different website and they had a link to this recipe. Never having eaten Indian food, I have nothing to compare this to. I thought it was good, but extremely spic'y! I don't know if thats the curry, but if you don't do spicy food, this isnt for you.

I made this exactly as is, except that I had to create my own ginger-garlic paste (I minced 1/2 tablespoon each to make it).  I found it incredibly salty.  Perfect level of heat to it, but it was so, so salty!  I can hardly eat it.  I'll leave out the salt next time, and possibly put more yogurt in to combat it...I double-checked all the measurements, too.  :(

Awesome.  Made according to recipe except I simmered on low for the last 15 minutes instead of 10 min on high.  Thought that would result in some burning sensations.

Oh man, this one was SOOO delicious! Just like restaurant food, like other reviewers say. I added some red bell pepper strips because I had them, and it added nice colour. I also used ginger cloves and minced ginger because I didn't have the paste. And lastly, like other reviewers, I found that adding 1/2 or 3/4 cup water near the end made it a bit more "saucy". 

But wow, I'm sending this recipe to all my friends. YUM! Thanks!

Yum!  Very easy & tasty with some rice.  Will add peas next time.  Changes: 1) cut the eggplant in half, brushed it w/ olive oil, & broiled it at 450 (as called for in recipe) for 30 minutes.  2) Couldn't find ginger garlic paste, so I minced 2 cloves of garlic and sprinkled ground ginger.  3) Used 1 + 1/2 tomatoes.  4) Mixed up this recipe w/ another & added a cup of chicken broth w/ yogurt.  Did not add salt because of the salt content of the broth.  Still tasted good.  Like some that I had at an Indian restaurant.

This was delicious.  Try piercing the eggplant w/ a fork before baking to prevent it from exploding.  Also, I added very thinly sliced chicken and it was great.

Delicious and easy!  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I left the peel on the eggplant, and unless the "bunch" of cilantro is a lot smaller than the bunches I buy, I used a lot less cilantro.  The eggplant I used weighed 27 ounces before cooking it, and it produced 4 moderately sized portions.  Tasted great, but quite spicy and our bellies were burning a while after eating this, so if spices might bother you, reduce the spice:eggplant ratio.  The size of the tomato was also non-specific, so could affect the outcome.  Measurements in ounces or cups, for any ingredient, in any recipe, are specific and are more helpful than non-specific amounts like "bunch" or "large"....  just something for members to consider when submitting recipes.  Update: Made this again when I was in a hurry so instead of roasting the eggplant, I cut it into 1" cubes and put them under the broiler at the same time I was sautéing the onions/cumin seeds. This saved 30 minutes of cooking time and was actually an improvement.  The eggplant was slightly charred (on purpose) and not as slimy.

Very good.  I cut down on the jalapeno and curry because I was worried that it would be too spicy but I wish the end product would have been spicier.  Next time will make as written and maybe even add some spice.  Hubby liked it even though there was no meat.  I used fresh ginger and garlic in place of the paste and less oil, probably closer to 1 tablespoon.

This was a very good version of this dish. If you like bharta, I think you'll really like it. Good testure, good flavors. I did substitute 1/2 tbsp grated ginger and 1/2 tbsp minced garlic for the garlic/ginger paste. I did not use the garam masala substitution. This recipe may be a 5, but since my personal preferences rated it a 3 (I would rather have mushroom curry), I couldn't give it the 5 star rating.

I felt like this had a bit of a strange consistency. The flavor was very good. I used Greek yogurt, but maybe a yogurt with a more liquidy consistency would have worked better. We served it over rice.

I love this recipe. However, to make it more like what I order at the restaurant, I add more oil, and puree it with a hand mixer. I also never have cumin seeds, but regular cumin works just fine, as does pressed garlic and chopped ginger.

I'm Indian and have never liked bhaigan until I tried this recipe! The use of curry powder and yogurt, although not traditional ingredients for this dish, really brings out the taste of the eggplant. This has become my go to eggplant recipe.

I tripled this recipe so it will be enough for 12 servings. My friends really liked it and thinks it is really authentic! I left out the tomato since one of my friends don't eat tomatoes. It still tastes really good without the tomato. Get some naan from the store! It tastes really delicious with naan.

For me, this was a wonderful basic recipe.  I tweaked the ingredients a bit to make my final dish more similar to that of my fav Indian restaurant.  I used an entire small can of tomatoes, and to counter the acidity, I added almost a tablespoon of honey.  I upped all the aromatics -- onion, garlic, ginger, garam masala, and cumin -- because I prefer a very strong flavor.   Though I know that other users aren't fans of yogurt, I love it, and I think it's an important addition.  I had no problem with curdling (even with the addition of extra tomatoes).

Delicious! I was looking for an easy eggplant recipe and this one really hit the spot! I didn't have all the ingredients on hand so I did a bit of substituting: I used fresh ginger and garlic instead of the paste, half a can of tomato sauce instead of a tomato and some sour cream with milk to make up for the plain yogurt. I'm sure these modifications changed the taste a bit, so it's no longer authentic Indian, but it turned out great (boyfriend gave it two thumbs up!) I served it hot with brown rice - makes a fabulous, meatless dinner. Thanks so much for sharing!

I'm not Indian, so I can't attest to authenticity, but it was delicious. However, as a time-saver, I baked the eggplant already cut into cubes, and left skin on. It was just as good, and much much less time and labor.

Absolutely delicious!  We didn't need to make any changes.  Just served it over some rice.

This was good! I did not give it five stars because I found it slightly bland. Next time I'll add more salt and hot pepper.

This recipe changes its flavor over the days and turns from decent to great! I added half a pound of ground Turkey and used Turmeric Powder instead of Garam Masala. When I cooked it me and my roommates gave it 4 stars, because the spices had not gone through the eggplant and it didn't taste that exciting. Than I had leftovers after 2 days and it was amazing! All the spices and flavors hat blended together and it was fantastic! Knowing this I will definitely make it again, since it's a dish that you can easily prepare ahead and by the time you eat it, it's a delight! Also, I found that the turkey gave it a rounder taste.

Served with a side of brown rice and marinated chicken.  Omitted jalapeno peppers.  Used 14 oz. drained diced tomatos. Overall a tasty, easy dish.  I easily cooked the eggplant by cutting it length-wise and placing it cut side down in a glass dish wtih about 1 tbl of water.  Microwaved for 5 minutes and done!

Fantastic. I like the eggplant skin, both for color and texture, so I didn't peel it. I used Greek yogurt, which I prefer, and it gave my curry a slightly thicker consistency and since it doesn't have that chalky taste I feel most store yogurts have, the spices were very lively.

This was pretty good.  I think I would give it a 3.5 star if I could.  I cut the eggplant in half and baked it at 400F for 25 minutes and it was easier to deal with than a whole eggplant.  I didn't have ginger garlic paste, so I used 1 tsp fresh ginger + 2 cloves of garlic.  I think if I make this again, I will add some red pepper flakes to spice it up.  It tasted very healthy and was very low in sodium (if you were not heavy handed on the salt).

Oh, wow. This is VERY close to the eggplant we used to get at our favorite Indian restaurant, in New Jersey. So much flavor for such simple ingredients! I used coconut milk instead of yogurt, and fresh ginger and garlic mashed together with salt. I simmered it on medium-high for eight minutes, and it started to burn, but the flavor was still perfect. This is an absolute keeper.

Most curries taste best when they've been allowed to sit or simmer for several hours.  I put this together very quickly and then transferred to a small crockpot for about 2 hours.  It was very good, but next time I'd make a few changes: reduce the amount of jalepeno to either a small pepper or 1/2 med. pepper.  When using crockpot, don't add yogurt until just before serving. I also only cooked the eggplant for about 15 minutes--soft, but not mushy. Overall, this delicious.

Yummy! This is such an awesome recipe. I did alter this a bit though. I diced up the eggplant and cooked it on the stove top. I did not add the jalepeno pepper because I like my Indian food mild. I also added half a can of coconut cream and some lemon juice. The yogurt I did not cook (to keep the good bacteria) but just added some ontop of everyones dish. This is a restaurant quality dish!

I liked this recipe since it has a homemade taste as that cooked in my vegetarian Indian's friends home.  It taste different and more healthy in that it is less greasy than versions in the restaurant.  I did add some ground nutmeg to taste and a splash of lemon juice for the flavors to marinate.  I also added a tsp of sugar for more flavor since the tomatoes I used were tart.  In addition to the  eggplant I also added a roasted pepper.   I cooked it at a high temperature and served it over Basmati rice.

Awesome!  I found this a bit spicy for my taste, so I might use a little less curry powder next time, but my boyfriend thought it was perfect.  Instead of roasting the eggplant I cut it into small pieces and simmered it in a wok in some olive oil while cooking the other veggies, and then mixed it all together with the spices and yogurt.  I also used diced garlic and ginger instead of the paste, and dried cilantro instead of fresh (that's what I had on hand).  Thanks for yummy recipe!

I only baked the eggplant for about 15 minutes.  Since it really didn't want to peel very easily I just left the peel on.  The eggplant shrinks quite a bit so I used 2 medium eggplants for this.  Used equal parts minced fresh garlic and ginger for ginger garlic paste.  Served this with Chicken Makhani from this site.  Great dinner.

eggplant needs to cook for at least an hour in the oven to get the right texture for bharata! The initial sauce also need to be cooked a little longer before adding yogurt and eggplant. that is how it is made in India.

I used a suggestion and made my own garam masala, and also used cardamon which I bloomed in a pan (cooked it on low with no oil just until fragrant) before I put it into my spice grinder with my ginger and garlic. 

I also am used to it being prepared pureed so I used an immersion  blender to puree it while it was still in the pan. After that I added about a cup of frozen peas to the mix as they thaw quickly and are a nice sweet counterpart to the heat of the spices. 

Thank You Yakuta for sharing this recipe :-)

I used low fat greek yogurt and it did particulate a bit. Adding roasted red peppers to this really enhanced the smoky flavor. Husband loved it. Will make again and try with plain yogurt instead.

I wouldn't make this again. I used non-fat yogurt, which kind of clumped up and while it tasted ok, it certainly didn't look very appetizing. For my taste it could have also been spicier.

I threw 4 cloves of garlic and an inch of diced ginger in a food processor to make garlic ginger paste. The only other change I made was to add the yogurt when it was finished cooking and remove from heat. Really good!

Wonderful and easy recipe.  I used garam masala per another reviewers recommendation and the flavor of the dish was great.  One concern for next time, I baked the eggplant as directed for 25 minutes and it burst in the oven and the meat of the eggplant was very soft (almost mushy).  I will cut down on the time next attempt, or find a firmer eggplant at the market.

This was fantastic.  I used it as a topping for Indian pizza: naan + mozz + eggplant curry on top.  Scrumptious!  I used grated ginger and minced garlic instead of the paste.  With Penzeys hot curry powder & the jalapeno it was nice and spicy!

Very good.  I used garam masala because that's what I had.  I also ended up adding about 2 T of butter and 1/2c of milk to the recipe because it was missing something...but that made it delightful!

This was quite good!  I too, used grated ginger and garlic since I didn't want to work too hard trying to find the paste.  I put in Greek yogurt, and...don't hate me..a teensy bit of worcestershire sauce..Parsley because forgot to buy cilantro.  I will make this again.

I too just used minced fresh ginger and fresh garlic. I also used greek yogurt because it was all I had--and it still turned out excellent!

I have made this several times now, most recently using an overgrown zucchini instead of eggplant. Great flavor! I too use ginger and garlic separately since I don't have the paste, and I usually add some garam masala. Put the yogurt in at the end.

I only had half a egg plant but i still made it somewhat like the recipe. Only difference is, I used 1/3 cup of yogurt. I also squeezed half a lemon and added some black pepper. It turned out excellent!.  Was finished in one sitting:)!

This was very tasty.  The only change I made was using a can of diced tomatoes (with liquid) instead of the tomato.  It made the dish extra saucey, which is my preference.  Will def. make it again.

Great flavor!  I didn't have ginger garlic paste, so I just used a 50/50 mix of the two and it turned out wonderful, just spicy enough!

I think the acidity of the tomato made the yogurt turn into little white solids, so I´m not too happy with the appearance. The flavor, however, is very good.

Great dish!  Turned out wonderfully!  I probably could have cooked the eggplant for 15 minutes in the oven and been fine - it would've been less mushy.  I also added about 1 T of sugar at the end.  And I took someone else's advice and squeezed half a lemon over the top.  Served on a brown rice/lentil combo bed with naan on the side.  Delicious!  And now my apartment smells amazing! :)

This was good enough, but not great. It had far more onion than eggplant, and came out dry instead of saucy. If I was going to make it again, I would increase the eggplant, and leave the eggplant peel on. I would also reduce the time on high heat at the end, maybe adding some liquid.

I just made this, and it was excellent! I was able to find the ginger garlic paste in the Asian foods section of the grocery store. I served it over steamed rice. Delicious! I would recommend using a non-stick saucepan to cook this in. I didn't, and I've got a bunch of food stuck to my pan now. Also, I may add another jalapeno pepper next time to increase the heat.

This is excellent! Prior to this I'd thought the only way I liked eggplant was in Eggplant Parmesan. Will definitely make it again in the future. Love it!

This was good.  I cut my eggplant in half and cooked for 15 minutes.  Next time I will start checking at 10 minutes b/c I'd like it to be a bit firmer.  The cilantro is really key because it brightens up the flavors and adds another layer.  If you don't have or don't care for cilantro try subbing flat leaf parsley or a squeeze of lemon juice.  I served this as a main dish with brown rice and naan.  2 servings of the curry plus one serving of riche and half a peice of store bought naan added up to 620 calories.  Was a filling meal that I will definitely make again.   Next time I will serve with a grilled chicken breast or maybe shrimp.

This was a simple enough recipe and I enjoy the flavors (especially the next day once they've had a chance to fuse).  I may have overcooked the eggplant however, because I found the dish a bit lacking in texture. Making sure you don't overcook the eggplant is key for this recipe.

This was so delicious!! My husband, who hates eggplant, even admitted it was tastey.  I used canned chopped jalapeno instead of fresh, and that added some great kick.  I am adding this to my weekly rotation.

This is wonderful. I was looking for a main dish alternative to baba ganooj, and this is so much better. Very forgiving recipe: I forgot the garlic-ginger business and served yogurt on the side. I am going back for seconds now, and not waiting for my family to come home!

Pretty good but could have had a fuller flavor - maybe because I used curry powder that had been sitting in the cupboard for a long time?  I will try again with fresher curry powder or garam masala as other reviewers have suggested.    Also I stupidly forgot to poke holes in the eggplant before sticking it in the oven and it exploded!  hee hee, rookie mistake...

This was great.  Cooked eggplant for 20 minutes.  Did not peel.  Scored it like a mango and push the flesh out...then cut the chunks off like you would a mango.

Loved it, I peeled the eggplant and cubed it before baking to shave off some time but over all easy recipe and turned out really good. I eyed the spices vs. measured thought because I didnt feel like it was going to be spicy enough but it was very spicy :) I think next time I will measure and adjust based on our desire for hotness as a prefect this one.

This recipe was easy and didn't take long.  My boyfriend and I liked it and would make it again, but thought it could have been more flavourful.  The heat from the spices and pepper was good but aside from that it was a bit bland.  I think I would make it again but maybe add some other Indian spices.

I've made quite a few curries from this site, most with mediocre results.  This is the BEST one I've tried.  I also used garam masala and ground cumin, and canned tomatoes as that was all that I had.  Meat-eating boyfriend didn't mind that this was eggplant!

Amazing!  I didn't peel the eggplant, but just cut into small chunks after roasting, with skin still on.  Added just a bit more of yogurt and then some sour cream and water to make slightly saucier.  But otherwise amazing!

I tried another recipe for Baingan Bharta at another site, but this one is much, much better. Served over rice and some chapatti bread (also from this site). Note on the spiciness level: I only used half of a jalapeno pepper because I wanted my husband to try it too. The result was that I found it could use more spice, but he found it VERY hot.

I tried making this for my family.  Maybe I didn't do something right, but it really only came out "ok".  I could tell my dad didn't like it.  I was pretty disheartened.  I think part of the problem was, instead of making it creamy, the yogurt got all grainy and gave the sauce a nasty appearance.  Once again, probably something I did wrong, but I was bummed out just the same.

Very good and authentic-tasting recipe (and healthy too!). Went great with tandoori chicken and jasmine rice. I added chicken stock and a pinch of garam masala since I felt it was missing something. Will probably make again!

Delicious.  I sautéed the eggplant in olive oil rather than baking it to save time.  Also added 1 sliced zucchini and used cumin powder instead of seeds.  Served over brown rice.  Will make again.

Fantastic! I made some adjustments because of ingredients on hand. I substituted 2 tsp ginger and 2 cloves of garlic for the ginger garlic paste, and I can of diced tomatos instead of fresh tomato. Also, substituted 1/2 cup of fat-free half and half for the  yogurt. Delicious over basmati rice. Yum!

This recipe is fantastic - it just just like what you'd find at a nice Indian restaurant.  I only altered it slightly: I used 2 medium sized eggplants and used 1.5 times the spices called for. I also used milk and water instead of yogurt.  Be aware that you will need to add a bit of water at the end to keep it from drying out.  This was enough to feed four people as a side dish and I will definitely be making this again.

Yummy! I had to find a recipe for all my eggplant and this recipe seemed easy plus I found out how to make ginger garlic paste (easy also!) which I had never made. I served it first night as a snack with oven toasted pita pieces. Made a larger batch the next day and served over bulgar (all I had in pantry) which I always season the water it cooks in.  I'm very proud of myself for trying this authentic tasting recipe and it's now in my recipe book to make whenever I have eggplant in season and need to make something memorable!

Made this exactly as steed but was a bit bland for my taste. My husband and friend are Indian and recommended the following....add garam masalla and coriander powder at the end. That gives it the little extra kick that was missing!

Absolutely delicious! I used a can of petite diced tomatoes as  I didn't have any fresh on hand and I probably doubled the spices, because I love Indian  cuisine. A great recipe for low carbers as long as you don't serve it with rice or naan. I had the leftovers for lunch the next day and added a few frozen green peas. Thank you so much Yakuta for this lovely recipe.

I thought the cumin seeds were quite overpowering.. Followed the recipe exactly, except for using stewed tomatoes instead of fresh. I didn't care for the taste (and I usually love curry,) Just seemed a little plain to me.

I moved out to a town with no good restaurants, so if you are craving indian food, this will totally hit the spot! I did use garam masala in place of the curry powder and I also used ginger powder and garlic powder (also 3 cloves of real garlic) in place of the paste. I also did not add the yogurt, not saying it would make it bad, my personal preference is without it though. I also forgot to cook naan or rice so I just toasted some toast real quick and it with lovely together.  Anyways,  I recommend trying it! Anything eggplant is good :)

Tried this recipe last night and it was great.  I used one tbsp oil, two small eggplants in place of one large one, two tomatoes, and used 1/2 tbsp fresh ginger and 1/2 tbsp fresh garlic as did not have the ginger paste.  Instead of salt, I added a veggie bouillon cube, and a little water when it tried to get too dry.  I also reduced the heat to medium as so many reviewers said it stuck when they tried to cook it on high.  The only other thing I  would change on this one is to try using 1/2 jalapeno next time.  It was just a little hot for us but we will definitely be making this over and over again!

Surprised at the delightful depth of flavor. We added diced tofu for protein avoiding the carbohydrate rich rice or naan as suggested.

I've made this a few times now, and it's popular with friends and family. It gets 5 stars even in the original version.

I still like some modifications:
 [*] I add 1 lb of ground pork
 [*] Instead of 1 tbsp. curry powder, I use 1/2 curry powder and 1/2 garam masala.
 [*] I add the yogurt at the end, after the dish cools a bit.
 [*] I stir frequently throughout (even during the "covered" cooking phase), to keep the dish from burning. Cook on medium heat, not high.
 [*] I add 1/4 teaspoon lemon juice at the very end.

First thank you very much to the reviewer that suggested grated garlic and ginger.  I really enjoy the bursts of heat from those.  With that being said the dish was really tasty.  I added chopped okra for color which was really good.  I used coconut oil as my vegetable oil and am considering using coconut milk or a fat free sour cream instead of yogurt.  Those substitutions would be strictly for presentation.  The yogurt does grain up during cooking as one reviewer said but the flavor is good.

6.9.14 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/47564/baingan-bharta-eggplant-curry/ ... Wow.  I liked it.  I really didn't think I would, but I did.  I even followed the recipe - pretty much - well, the ingredients anyway.  :/  I cooked everything stovetop, subbed 1/4t each granulated garlic & ground ginger for the ginger garlic paste.  I used 1t ground cumin for the seeds.  'Added 1t curry powder by mistake - instead of 1T.  Gee, can I honestly say I followed the recipe?  Maybe not.  I liked it though.  'Didn't add any yogurt, btw.  Oh, tomato was soft so that didn't make it in either.  Hmmm ... maybe I should "rephrase the beginning of this review.  :?  :D  Sum up: This is the first Indian dish I've liked.  Authentic or not, I'm glad I went for it!  :)  Note:  There is a recipe for ginger garlic paste on AR = equal parts ginger & garlic.

Delicious! Like others have said, it isn't authentic using curry powder instead of mixing the individual spices yourself, but it is delicious nonetheless (and it made for an excellent shortcut in a time crunch!) This was so delicious not only did my entire family devour it, but my 4 year old who has been going through a picky-spell ate one bite and said "yum!" and then ate it all!! The only thing I did differently was puree the onion with the garlic/ginger so it was all mushy with  no chunks. It was so good I'm going to have to double it next time!

I like this recipe.  I've tweaked it a bit over the few times I've done it.  1) Bake the eggplant longer until really close to mush.  2) Up the amounts of tomatoes.  3) Up the amount of cumin and add garam masala in addition to curry powder.  4) Wait until done cooking to stir in the yogurt.

I used 2 14 oz cans diced tomatoes and 2 large eggplant, several dashes Chipotle tabasco sauce (didn't have any jalapenos). Steamed eggplant in microwave till soft. Instead of yogurt, used 1/4 cup lactaid whole milk. Just cooked several garlic cloves in microwave for 1 min and  used ginger, curry, cardamon, and cumin powder. Came out kinda bland. As some people commented, tasted like something was missing. All the spices were there, but realized it needed to cook longer. Let it simmer overnight and it tasted better, still kinda tart from tomatoes. Added 1 tlb splenda and 1 tsp salt, much better, but still eggplant was a little bland.
Next time: I'll cook it all together without cooking eggplant first and see if it tastes richer. Will re-submit upon next trial and let you know how it went.
I just signed up here and was trying to add a photo of myself and it said something like it had to be 900x900 megapixels on 1 side. Does anyone know what that means? Thx

This has become one of my favorite dishes of all time. I highly recommend it! 

We did omit the chiles, and instead of ginger paste, we use ginger spice and garlic from a jar. It tastes so good. 

I also like to make this with Japanese eggplant because they are less bitter and produce fewer stomach issues than regular eggplant.

Really good, but doesn't make very much - barely two servings. Also, I wish there were a more precise measurement for the eggplant; it's hard to know exactly how large a "large eggplant" should be, and mine -- the biggest my store had -- only yielded about a cup of eggplant once roasted. When I make it again, I'll double everything except the yogurt (which, in fact, I did add last, since yogurt tends to separate and curdle when heated). Still, really good, and not elaborate or time-consuming once the eggplant is roasted! We'll make this again, thank you!

I love spicy food, but the jalapeño ruined this dish. It overpowered the other flavors and left our mouths on fire.  I would make this again without the jalapeño.

I omitted the ginger because my husband does not like ginger and added only minced garlic.  It was still very good a flavorful. Will make it again.

I really liked the flavor of this dish. I removed the skin and pureed the eggplant in the blender with a tiny bit of water after baking. I also had some Indian spices on hand so I doubled the curry powder (2T) and added 1t garam masala, 1t tumeric, and about 1/4t cayenne pepper. I also had a tiny bit of shredded chicken in the freezer so I put that in too. I cooked the jalapeno with the onion at the beginning and put in the yogurt at the very end. I didn't have any problem with it burning, but I also didn't cook it on very high heat as directed. I added about three small tomatoes and they helped to hydrate the dish. The result was great, though I might leave out the chicken next time!

This made a welcome addition to a cold wet day.  The only change I made was to use 1 tbs minced garlic and 1 tbs minced ginger since I had no garlic ginger paste I'll be making this again and again.  Thanks for sharing!

Fabulous recipe!!! Thanks for sharing! I didn't have any cumin seeds unfortunately so I had to substitute coriander and chili powder, but it still turned out fantastic.

Pretty good.  I made it as a main dish, and it wasn't really enough to fill all of us (served with rice).    I cooked exactly as directed, and would make some changes if I make it again.  Cooking it on high for 10 minutes caused the yogurt to burn on the pan.  Overall, it was pretty good, but I would make some changes next time.

Excellent!  Just like going to a restaurant.  I did a few modifications: I cut the eggplant in half and placed it cut side down on greased aluminum foil to bake.  Instead of Garlic ginger paste I did 3 cloves of garlic and 1 tablespoon of ginger.  I used 1 tsp of powdered cumin instead of seeds.  I used the whole 6 oz of plain nonfat yougurt (this is a little more than 1/2 cup).  I increased to two tomatoes (because many reviewers said it was burning to the pan and not juicy enough.  I used 1/2 a jalepano pepper instead of the whole pepper and is was plenty spicy. Wonderful recipe!

this was super yummy! And fun to make! I added a squirt of lemon juice at the end as someone suggested - not sure that that really added anything - I think it's just fine without that. I used fresh garlic (two really big cloves) and ginger (about 2 tbsp) and 2 jalepeno peppers (I like it spicey) and it was just right! I'm making this again this weekend for vegan sis and friend visiting :O)

Awesome!  Of course, I failed to follow the instructions as written, but loved the result.  I sliced the eggplant and cooked it in a dry non-stick skillet until it was thoroughly browned, almost burned in spots.  I followed the rest of the recipe as written, and added the cooked onion and spice mixture to the eggplant, and left it on low for a few more minutes.  Can't wait to make this again.

I could taste the potential in this dish, but alas, it was waaaaaaay too spicy!  1 whole jalapeno pepper was way too much for me, in spite of the many years I have spent acclimatizing to spicy cooking.  Next time I will use only 1/4 of a jalapeno.

excellent! i usually always prepare eggplant in an Italian style, so this was a great change. i cubed the eggplant and soaked it in water for about 20 minutes, and added powdered ginger because i didnt have the ginger garlic paste, and coriander. my friends loved it!

I was excited to dry this, but was disappointed with the result.  Contrary to what others have said, I thought the flavor was great, though I would turn up the heat a little bit with another jalapeno pepper.  The problem was that the sauce was waaaay too thin, practically non-existent.  This was bad enough, but it also meant that when I turned the heat on high, I had a difficult time keeping it from burning.  After I made it, I checked other recipes for the same dish online.  Most of those call for at least TWO, usually FOUR tomatoes, not ONE.  This would have made a huge difference.

I needed to adjust this recipe due to some ingredients that I did not have (I substituted coconut juice for yogurt, and added extra curry) and also personal taste (I wanted it spicier), but overall, I absolutely loved it.  My room-mate, who hates eggplant, loved this dish, and I look forward to making it a big part of my menu planning!

Loved this recipe.  I pureed the jalapeño to avoid hot spots.  My kids ate it too (especially the baby) I just removed their portion before I added the pureed jalapeño.

I accidentally put in too much yogurt and it was still good - the flavors really come together deliciously! Didn't have cumin seeds so I used ground cumin. I would add more spices in the future, especially more curry powder. I threw in a pinch of cinnamon too.

Used garam masala instead of curry powder and used chili powder instead of peppers. Came out wonderful. My desi boyfriend loved it. Next time I'll mash the eggplant instead of chopping it.

This dish is very tasty, but i made a couple changes: I used olive oil and instead of plain yogurt, i used sour cream (because i did not get the yogurt.
Anyway it turned out great.  I served with brown rice.   It was like a nice Indian dinner.

As vegetarians, this meal was very good.  The only changes I made was cubing the eggplant in small pieces and with a little olive oil in a saucepan steam instead of baking and I did not add the yogurt and I used hot peppers because we like spicy curry. For me this is a must keep even the kids enjoyed it.

I haven't made Baingan Bharta (or Vangyacha Bharit in my mother tongue :D), and I used this recipe... Excellent results were obtained. Very Very satisfying.

I didn't have curry powder, so I used red chili powder + turmeric powder + coriander powder: came out great all the same.

Also, my mom does not add yogurt to the recipe, so I omitted that and added it as a side while having lunch: the whole combo tastes just superb with parathas.

Kudos!

Awesome recipe. I added an extra clove or two of garlic, and a teaspoon of garam masala powder. I also used a spicier pepper than jalepeno and added a bit of extra curry powder, so it had a real solid kick to it. (The yogurt is great to help calibrate hotness level). Delicious.

the curry paste itself was a 5 star for me... but i didn't care for it once i tasted the eggplant... and i love eggplant but i don't think it went well with this curry paste - too much salt perhaps... i think i will try this blend of spices, etc again and mix it with tofu or Quorn. Thanks.

i thought this was excellent. i was kinda nervous for my first attempt at indian food, but bharta is different every where you go that i thought this was a nice place to start.  it came out great. i would have liked a little more spice, but i thought it was awesome.  i would suggest simmering it on low for as long as you can (it just helps the flavors meld)  i cooked it for almost 2 hours.  delicious.

Good and very healthy! Also cheap and easy to make. I am making this again tonight. The hardest part was waiting for the eggplant to roast in the oven, but I already did it last night while I was making another meal, so tonight should be easy. This dish came out drier than I expected - I thought the yogurt would create more sauce - but still good.

What a delicious meal!  I made almost as directed but I substituted rice sour cream since I am lactose intolerant.  I also deveined the pepper and took out most of the seeds so the meal wasn't too overly spicy.  This was a fantastic meal.  Not very pretty but don't let that turn you off.  I wish I had doubled the recipe.  I would definitely add more tomatoes next time.  Another benefit, the house smells great after the meal has been cooked.  What a wonderful aroma.

Excellent! I made it this weekend, only I used curry paste and minced 4 gloves of fresh garlic. It's very easy to make and it makes the best left overs.

First review (8/4/2005): Pretty good, and so easy to make and healthy!  Be warned about the servings:  I doubled the recipe and served it over rice as the (only) main course, and it only fed four people.  Also, in doubling the recipe, I
tripled the tomatoes upon suggestion of other reviewers; that worked out
fairly well -- there certainly wasn't too many tomatoes and maybe more
would've been better.
---
For a new review (10/11/2008), having forgotten I previously cooked an altered version of this years ago, I wrote: this wasn't what I expected.  I'm used to baingan bharta either involving eggplant in a sauce or mashed to relative smoothness.  This was dry and more like a ratatouille in texture.  I needed to add more yogurt as I ate it.  (I can see why increasing the tomatoes is a good idea.)  As for cooking, the dish is easy to make.  I used ground ginger and garlic instead of fresh paste.  I also used garam masala, cumin, and chili powder instead of curry powder (since I had no generic "curry powder").  I think the garam masala worked.  (Yes, I know it's not a substitute for curry powder.  The cilantro also worked--it's not just a garnish.

Remember to check the eggplants because they will explode! Other than that tidbit, this is a great recipe.

Added creme fraiche rather than yoghurt plus crushed it in a blender when cooked. Was like I was back again in my favourite Indian restaurant in Paris :)
Think about adding lentils or mung beans next time I make it.

Baingan Bharta is my favorite dish at our local Indian restaurant so I was excited about making this at home.  However, this didn't taste anything like the restaurant dish.  One taste and it went down our garbage disposal.  Biggest problem was that the yogurt made it really sour... Maybe if you use the authentic Indian yogurt and curry it may work out better.

It's not Shalimar, but YUM!  I omitted the yogurt and added a touch of milk to keep it from burning.  Excellent!

Excellent flavors!  I made it exactly per the recipe. I will be making it again and what I’ll be changing is not heating the yogurt. It made a weird texture but still tasted excellent!  Thank you

This was really delicious! I didn't have any jalapenos so I used green chile. I didn't have any ginger garlic paste so I used 1 teas garlic, 1 teas  ginger paste and 1 teas garlic chile paste. I used 1 teas curry, 2 teas garam masala. Instead of a diced tomato I put in a can of diced tomatoes. I used 2 pretty large Japanese eggplant.  All in all I followed the recipe pretty closely, I added extra chile because we like it hot and it was! This was so good! We had it over rice. I gotta get more eggplant so I can make this again!

Very good. Did not have garlic ginger paste but had garlic paste and I grated some fresh garlic with it. I will not add the yogurt until ready to eat. Seeded the jalapeño. Used curry powder as opposed to garam masala as some others suggested. Did not peel the eggplant. Will make again. Could easily add some peas or maybe sweet potato or regular potato

Excellent dish. The only change I made was to add a tad of garam masala and cooked peas. This is the first time I made it with yogurt.  I only had Greek yogurt that was really thick so I did add a little water for consistency.  I served over brown rice cooked in vegetable broth and saffron.  My husband liked it with a sweet and spicy mango chutney over top.  Thanks for the recipe!

It was good! Very similar to the flavor in restaurants. I did make a couple of changes: omitted the yogurt, used tomato sauce instead of fresh tomatoes (which I didn't have), and grilled (then removed the peel of) the eggplant for an extra-smoky flavor. The cilantro makes the flavor extra-fresh.

Just like we get from the restaurant and so easy! The eggplant gets a wonderful sweetness and the spices are spot on. I did add peas as what we get from our local restaurant has peas in it for a bright sweet flavor. Next time I will remove the seeds from the jalapeno as it was just a tad too spicy for me. I served this with Indian-spiced meatballs and naan. Will make again.

This was a great dish!  Instead of the paste, I roasted whole garlic and ginger in the oven with the eggplant and just mashed it up with a fork to add to the pan.  I also added a little smoked paprika right at the end for a tiny bit more kick. Definitely don’t leave out the lemon juice suggested by SUSHANK  It really does bring it all together.

Delicious. Left the skin on the eggplant for added texture and replaced cumin powder with garam masala. Also since it’s winter I subbed the fresh tomato with 14 oz can of diced tomatoes.

Out of all of the vegetarian Indian dishes I tried on Allrecipes, this has been by far my favourite! I love the texture of the eggplant mixed with the curry and tomato. It's delicious and I can't wait to try it again!

I haven't had Indian food in probably a decade; so I can't really compare it.  However, it was tasty and I'd probably make it again.  We didn't have curry powder, but since the two main ingredients in curry powder are cumin and tumeric and there was already cumin in the dish, we just substituted tumeric for the curry powder.  It sadly only made about 2 servings as written and would probably need to be mixed with rice or something to feed more without doubling.

WOW definitely going on our meal rotation! This recipe blew me away!! We like to leave the eggplant skins on because it's healthier (and tastier in our opinion) so we just had to cook them a little longer to soften them up. YUM

I made a few changes recommended by others -- used 2 eggplants, cut in half lengthwise, baked 20min.  Also used fresh minced ginger & garlic instead of paste, ground cumin instead of cumin seeds, and garam masala instead of curry.  Only used 1 jalapeño, and the dish was very spicy.  Yogurt (stirred in at end) helped cut the heat.  Hate to rate after making so many changes, but we still really enjoyed it!

Delicious! Mine looks totally different  than everyone elses photos.  I think it's due to me over mixing it.  I didn't add the yogurt until the very end. I tried it before I did and after. It definitely made it yummier but is not mandatory if you are vegan.

I made it as described with following changes  1) used minced  garlic  and ginger as I didnt have paste. 2)  used diced tomatoes as that's what I had on hand 3) added 1/2 chopped poblano pepper in with the tomatoes (didn't have jalapeno).   Served with roasted cauliflower instead of rice to cut carbs.  My husband and I loved this dish!

After having this at a local restaurant I was determined to make it at home.  This recipe was easy and the dish was very flavorful served over basmati rice.  As others have noted, one eggplant isn't sufficient.  I also recommend using garam masala instead of curry.  Charring the eggplant on a gas burner for 10 minutes before putting it in the oven lent a smokey flavor to the eggplant.  I also cracked the cumin seeds and toasted them in the pan before adding the onion.  I like it just with eggplant; I subsequently made it with some diced chicken and that was also good.

At first I was concerned when this looked like a gelatinous mush of TWO roasted aubergine, -- I roasted them whole at 425 for 25 minutes, turned off heat and let them rest in hot oven for another 10-15, the meat peeled away nicely --  but after the high cooking, it reduced perfectly (my pan burned slightly but that added to the flavor).  Made my own ginger garlic paste and also added just a touch of rice vinegar; and only had a small poblano pepper versus a jalapeno. Really yummy.

The quality of the eggplant plays a huge part in whether this recipe is a hit or a dismal miss.

Tried this recipe this evening, it was delicious.  I stepped out of my comfort zone for this one.  I didn't have Jalapeno so used spicy curry seasoning and some red pepper flakes, grated my own garlic and ginger for the paste and used coconut and palm oil for the sauteing. I also threw in some extra Tumeric just to up the health benefits. I have to cook for my elderly mom so mostly have to stay away from spicy dishes but I made this for myself and cooked some red quinoa to eat with it instead of rice, it was really good with it.

I made this as a side dish to an Indian food themed birthday dinner. I did like it, and will probably make it again for a similar such special occasion, but I don't think it will become a regular in our house. I took the advice of a couple of other reviewers and I upped the amount of eggplant - I think this is really necessary. I used three medium sized eggplants instead of one large. The other change I made was to combine yogurt and cream (I used about a 50-50 ratio) to prevent the recipe from being too tangy. I thought it was an ideal amount of tanginess this way, although probably healthier not to do this :-).

It just needed a teaspoon or so of sugar and a little bit of lemon juice to make it "taste right" by my standards.
I did change a few things as well- fresh ginger & garlic, substituted green curry paste for the chili pepper (about a tbsp), I used kefir instead of yogurt (what I had), more salt than was recommended, fresh dill instead of cilantro (again what I had), 1 tsp of sugar and half a squeezed lemon, everything else I followed.
It was better than it is at my favorite Indian restaurant.
Thanks for the recipe. :)

This was pretty good, but a little too salty. Maybe because I used lowfat yogurt. Next time I'll try less salt and whole milk yogurt. I also felt the recipe lacked a certain brightness but I'm not sure what! Maybe a bit of garam masala would help.

I loved this dish! Very flavorful and tasty. Here are a few modifications:
1. Keep the eggplant peel. The texture comes out amazing after baking
2. Instead of plain youghurt use greek youghurt thinned with curry+water mix
3. Add zucchini squash cut into quarters lengthwise to the baking dish with eggplant. Cut into both zall the vegetable quarters diagonally across the entire length and sprits with olive oil before baking.

This was absolutely delicious!  I followed most of the directions as written, but had to make one substitution.  I couldn't find ginger-garlic paste, so I used a half tablespoon and half teaspoon of minced garlic and a tablespoon of minced ginger in its place.  It seemed to work great.  The only other suggestion would be to not cook it on high for the ten minutes it's covered.  I only cooked it on med-high, and it still burnt to the bottom of the pan.  Otherwise, it's a great recipe.

This was so good! I made it just as the recipe instructs but did substitute actual garlic and ginger for the ginger garlic paste. This is what I will do with eggplants whenever we have them from now on!

I found this to be a little bland. I used Greek yogurt and it curdled at such high temps. I probably won't make this again.

This recipe was absolutely delicious the 1st time I made it and my husband also loved it. He stated that it was so good that could easily cause one to overeat! I'm now sharing it with my best friend so she can use it with the eggplant I gave her from my garden. I'm sure she and her husband will love it as well.

Really good! Per other reviews, used garam masala instead of curry, & used a can of Ro-tel for the tomatoes/chiles. I might actually use more egg plant next time. One roasted to mush (lol) & one cubed & sautéed. Plain 2% Greek yogurt worked fine for me. I find ginger/garlic paste at the Indian grocery.

I found this recipe online when trying to figure out what to do with the eggplant we received from a local farmer's market. My husband doesn't like vegetables, but he really liked this dish. I loved the recipe as is, but he thought he might want to add chicken the next time we make it.

Very tasty and very spicy. I used a jalapeño fresh from our garden and probably should have removed a few seeds, since our plant seems to produce particularly hot peppers. I followed the advice of several other reviewers and reduced the cook time and temp after adding the yogurt. I also added 1/2 tsp of garam masala at the end. It was very flavorful, and I look forward to making this again!

This was good.  I used three Japanese eggplant since that's all I can get here in Japan.  Since they are so small I sliced in half lengthwise and used the indoor grill for about 20 minutes until they became soft.  The skin easily pealed off.  I didn't have cumin seeds so I replaced it with cumin.  I also can't get jalepenos here so I used several teaspoons of chopped green chilis which added plenty of warm to the dish.  Glad to find a good dish for eggplant, it's abundant and cheap here.

Used low fat sour cream instead of yogurt and canned petite diced tomatoes instead of fresh. Made with the chicken makhani from this site--it was a huge hit!

I think all the ingredients are good, but it seems to me that the baingan bharta that is served at Indian restaurants uses pureed eggplant.  So, I would puree, rather than chop, the eggplant.  I would also dice the onions far more finely than the recipe seems to infer.  And, I would cook the jalapenos with the onions and seeds, as they are usually cooked at the beginning in the recipes I've seen. Otherwise, very tasty!

This was delicious.  I didn't have any ginger garlic paste or cumin seeds, so I 2 cloves of minced garlic, and ginger and cumin powders to taste.  It was fine. I had a few mozzarella sticks banging around in my fridge.  Cut 4 into cubes and added that.  Served when they just started to soften.  Delicious, and they added some oomph. I think it would have not been filling enough without.

The ingredients are pretty authentic, but some of the directions are incorrect. The 10 minutes on high heat will burn your food. I even cooked this at a lower temp than required, yet all I was left with was a dry, blackened mess after the 10 minutes.  My stove does not "run hot," because every other recipe on this site has worked like a charm for me. If you want to make this, please reduce either your heat or cook time.

I didn't follow the recipe completely but used it as a guide...For starters, I peeled my eggplant first and then put it in the oven for about 27 min. I also added ground pork, since my fiance will complain about being hungry without meat. I cooked mixed in 1.5 tbs of cornstarch, garlic salt, garam masala, and sugar into the meat, and cooked it during step two (cooking the onions with cumin). I also added some boiled new potatoes (cut in half). I tasted the dish several times and added salt, sugar, and garam masala until it tasted right. I also had to add some water because the mixture was a bit dry, I didn't have any yogurt. This ended up not looking too pretty, but tasted good. I would make again...and I don't like eggplant.

very good! my husband had told me to give up on eggplant and this was my last attempt at making somethin good -- and it worked!  im second generation indian and have more indian spices in my cubboard, so i ommitted the curry powder and used ground cumin, coriander, red pepper and tumeric instead.  i also fried the onions with mustard seeds too (not realizing i was using them instead of cumin seeds!).  it was really easy to peel the eggplant right out of the oven.

Awesome.  I'm dieting and thought I had to give up Indian food, this is pretty close to what we get at our fav Indian spot.  I  used fat free sour cream (that's what I had on hand).  Enjoyed with brown rice.

Oh WOW! Indian Dish attempt #2 and MAN I"M HAPPY!  SO SO SO GOOD!  I added peas, and I used about a cup of little plum tomatoes (halved) I ommitted the yogurt (dairy free diet) and come to think of it...forgot the cilantro.  But I LOVE IT...there is a different flavor, that maybe I put a little too much of some seasoning in (since i'm new to the seasonings) but I'm making it again!!! FOR SURE!  Went great with brown basmati rice and Aloo Phujia from this site! AWESOME!

I loved this. I cooked two curries the same night and this was by far the better dish. I didn't have cumin seeds. I used a tsp of cumin powder instead and 1/4 tsp of coriander seeds - as well as all the other suggested spices. I took note of some of the other suggestions: cutting the eggplant in half, placing on aluminum foil in the oven (I didn't use any oil or Pam), and scooping it with a spoon. Came out fantastic!

DELICIOUS! I added zucchini when the onions were cooked, and the eggplant a little later. Almost doubled some of the spices (cumin,garlic,ginger). This was REALLY a wonderful and super easy recipe,took me about 40 minutes from when i started cutting the onions to finishing!

Yummy! I added garam masala powder and chilli powder instead of curry powder. Omitted the jalapeno. Covered and simmered on low for 10 mins and I heated it on high for the last 5mins with continuous stirring. Everyone in the family loved it!

OH MY GOD WAS THIS EVER GOOD!    I followed some of the previous reviews and added an extra eggplant.  Didn't have a fresh tomato on hand, so I just used some tomato puree and blended it up with the cooked eggplant.  This was really delicious and a totally new twist for eggplant!  Will definitely be making it again!

This recipe was unbelievably good.  I made it for dinner and was shocked at how well it turned out.  I cut out all of the oil and used pam, used low fat yogurt, and minced garlic and ginger together instead of a paste.

This turned out pretty good. I'd never cooked or eaten eggplant so I really didn't know what to expect and after reading the reviews I don't think I cooked the eggplant long enough. I added more spice than was recommended and added peas instead of tomatoes (not a fan). It tasted great! My husband LOVED it!

This is really good.  Very flavorful!  I'm new to indian dishes and this is the first curry recipe I've had that I like.  Its very easy to control the heat by just adding a tsp. or 2 of jalapeno instead of the whole thing.  This will be even more flavorful the next day as the flavors have a chance to meld together.  I didn't use commercial curry powder (nasty), I made my own using ground coriander, fenugreek, cayenne, and turmeric and I think that probably helped with the flavor.

This is so delicious.  An excellent way to use up eggplant.  To save time, I sauteed my eggplant beforehand.  I also added a cinnamon stick and turmeric to the mix.  I doubled the spices and amount of yogurt used in the recipe and used about half a can of chicken stock to achieve a preferable consistency.  I also added a tablespoon of tomato paste to substitute for the tomatoes.  So good!!!

My husband LOVED it. For me, the taste of cumin was a bit too much. Perhaps I will try to add less cumin next time and a little more spice.

I followed the recipe exactly and didn't really care much for this dish. Maybe I am too accustomed to Butter Chicken and Chicken Marsala and so a dish with only Eggplant was just not for me? Not sure - but either way, I doubt I will make this meal again. 

However, for a quick and simple version of Naan, I just put pieces of pita bread on a pan, some butter and minced garlic on top and placed in the oven at 350 for 10 min. or so. Not quite the same as the real thing, but a great and fast substitute!

This turned out really good, though I didn't realize until I had started cooking that I didn't have any plain yogurt so I had to use peach yogurt instead, it added a very nice sweet flavor to the curry.

This is a great recipe- my husband really likes it.  If it starts to dry out while cooking, I simply stir in some water to give it nice creamy texture.  I serve it with handmade rotis.

This was very good for the time it took me to make it.  I partly fried/partly microwaved the eggplant, and making the sauce was super easy.  I used cumin powder instead of seeds, fresh ginger and garlic, omitted the tomato & chili, and used dry cilantro instead of fresh.  I also probably used more curry than the recipe asked for, and a pinch of cayenne to add some kick (instead of the chili).  A bit less than a teaspoon of salt was just fine, and I added some sugar since there was definitely something missing.  Without the sugar I just wouldn't have liked it...  It added a sweet roundness.  Next time I'll double the recipe and I'll definitely experiment way more!

Delicious! This was my first attempt at Indian and it turned out wonderfully. Like many other viewers I used fresh ginger & garlic in place of the paste. Also used canned tomatoes and saved the liquid for the simmering. Loved it!

Edible, but not my idea of a typical yummy Indian dish.  I doubled the spices and still thought it was a little bland.  Probably won't make again.

I'm always looking for a way to make eggplant not taste like eggplant, and this was excellent for that.  Pretty easy, too.  In the future I may experiment with adding more spices.

This was much better than I was expecting (seems that eggplant curries are almost always too mushy for my taste)! I didn't have garlic ginger paste so I used garlic salt and ginger powder instead. I added a cup of peas with the eggplant. I also added more jalapeno pepper slices (minced) and a lot more spices since it seemed too bland per the recipe for an Indian curry. It turned out good, although something is still missing from traditional Indian foods. Very tasty, and I'll definitely make again. Thanks for the recipe!

my husband really enjoys curry dishes, but i had to improvise quite a bit to suit what i had on hand; i used minced garlic and ground ginger in place of the ginger garlic paste. i used low-fat sour cream in place of yogurt. i used crushed red pepper flakes in place of the jalapeno, and had to used dried cilantro, which i incorporated right at the end, rather than using as a garnish. even with the unfortunate substitutions, this was so good. we ate it over rice. will try again - hopefully the "right" way!

This was awesome!  We love Indian food here, and this hit the spot tonight.  I made it as directed, except that I ran out of cumin seeds and subbed in some cumin to make up the difference. I also didn't have one large eggplant, so I used three small ones (and almost wish I had used four).  Used a whole jalapeño and it was still somewhat mild (even for a rather spicy pepper). My boyfriend ate it with a co-op sausage and said it was awesome together.

This was delicious! I love Indian food, but this was only my second time actually making anything Indian. I did substitute sour cream for the yogurt, but only because there was no plain yogurt at the grocery store. Also no jalapenos, so I used a red chili pepper. I left the skin on my eggplant because I happen to like it that way. And since I had no ginger-garlic paste, I just used a few cloves of fresh garlic, pressed, and some ginger powder. The smell as it was all cooking was SO wonderful. The taste was great, very flavorful. It did seem like something was missing though...I just couldn't put my finger on it. Either way, I'll be making this again ^_^

I use this recipe quite a bit, the only problem is that I feel it reduces down too thick.  I recommend thinning it out a bit with some stock.  Other than that, the flavor is delicious!  Adding some sweet potato is a great option, too!

Delicious!  I had never tried eggplant this way but wanted to try something besides italian with the eggplant I had.  I thought it was wonderful and will make again.

I modified this a bit. First, based on several other reviews, I added a can of crushed tomatoes. Then I found this made it taste TOO much like tomatoes so I added some extra yogurt. I also simmer this for 1 hour. I thought it was okay, but my boyfriend loved it. Will probably make again, but for me, it's missing that "WOW!" factor.

Great recipe!  I followed the recipe step by step and found it so easy to make that I will make it again (the only time I spent was waiting for the eggplants to get roasted) I served it with basmati rice and a salad made of yogurt and cucumbers (raita) and it was fantastic since the salad counters the spice flavor of the baingan bharta. Thank you for the recipe!

Good side dish. Needs a bit more garlic, imo.

I really enjoyed this; husband did not care for the texture of the eggplant. It was a bit chewy. I will chop the eggplant into much smaller pieces next time.

This is a decent curry, and the best use for eggplant I've found so far. I thought it was too spicy, so I'd cut back on the jalapeno next time. Also, I roasted the eggplant on the grill rather than baking since it cooks much faster that way.

I thought this was a little dry.  I think I'll try it again with a larger tomato, maybe that will make a difference...

Delicious!!  For a hotter version, try using half a serrano chile instead of a whole jalapeno - either way is yummy!

WOW! This was really good. I used one jalapeno, but I think I will use at least two next time because it wasn't spicey at all. We made the Baingan Bharta along with the Curried Coconut Chicken for dinner and they both were delicious. Forgot to make some basmati rice to go with it, but we did have some naan. Thanks.

This was good, but not quite great. I may have done something wrong, who knows...it was spicy but not terribly flavorful. I would probably make it again if I had an eggplant around and nothing else to do with it.

I loved this. Cooking the eggplant with the skin on gives it so much more flavor. I served it with a whole wheat naan bread.

Good.  Really good.  I made a few changes.  Cut the oil by more than half, added chicken, chicken stock and more vegs -this made it a meal all on its own.  I simmered a really long time (close to 2 hrs) and it just kept getting better.  Also added extra coriander, but just cuz I like it.  Served with (brown) cumin rice.  Delish!

Fairly good recipe. Like others suggested, I used minced garlic & minced ginger.  I recommend using less cumin.  The yoghurt is a nice touch, takes the edge off the spice.

I'm not a big eggplant fan, could only think of 2 dishes with eggplant in them that I like ... until I tried this. Thanks for sharing! My wife and neighbors love it also.

the calories per serving made this dish taste even better than its already satisfying flavor.  Being new to both Eggplant, and Curry I couldn't have been happier.

Very good!  I didn't have enough time to bake the eggplant in the oven so cooked on top of the stove in oil till soft and then as instructed.  I left the peel on the eggplant and it was just fine.  I will be making this again.

Although I may make this recipe again, I will definately alter it next time.  It was good, not fabulous, and needs a few more tweeks!  It definately won't feed four people, and next time I think I will make it with a chicken tikki, or kabobs, something to add a little more.  I served it with rice seasoned with cumin, cilantro, and raisans...it was good.  I also served garlic nan, but that said it was only enough to feed my boyfriend and I, and we're fit.  The yogurt looked as if it were going to be too much after adding half the amount and then tasting, I added water because the dish was too thick and let it cook down, next time I'll use chicken stock, but didn't have any on hand.  Like I said I will use it again, but not without some major modifications.

This recipe was not particularly to my liking, not because it was bad, but just because i think i dont particularly like Indian curry- maybe i like Thai or Trinidadian curry better. Anyway, it was edible and did not taste bad, just not very good. Although my mom loved it, i wont be making this again. O, and i used the yogurt and found it didnt add any undesirable flavor or texture.

Yum! I also left out the yogurt as another reader suggested (and added a little water) so the dish would be more like the consistency of one I love at Indian restaurants. It was TASTY, and pretty simple to make.
