Amazing recipe! Family loved it and was super easy. Wouldn't change a thing. Made the perfect amount for four people.

Very good & easy to make with ingredients on hand. Added cinnamon to 1 batch & dried cranberries to another. I didn’t get the ‘clumps’ of granola usually seen in store bought-more of a cereal like consistency. Yummy, nonetheless!

This is a simple delicious recipe. Some granola recipes call for multiple ingredients and aren’t worth the extra cost or effort. This is great!  I doubled the batch and added dried fruit after it cooled. It’s a keeper recipe.
