The taste with my changes makes this a 10 star recipe but as is, only 4.  I slice my carrots and simmer for about 8 minutes to slightly soften.  I boiled the vinegar with the sugar and took it off the stove and added the white onion & jalepeno (I used jarred, not fresh).   When the carrots were to my liking I scooped them into the vinegar mixture and let that set for 1 hour.  I then put into 2 1-pint jars and will refrigerate.  I did also add some salt as I think it needs that.  YUMMMO!!

We had some jalapenos that were starting to get a little old, so I found and tried this recipe. It is fantastic. I had only had the pickled peppers in restaurants, and these are so much better. To the vinegar and sugar, I added several shakes of ground pepper, around 1/4 tsp of Italian seasoning, and a few shakes of salt. I boiled my carrots for around five minutes before adding the peppers (quartered lengthwise into strips, with the membrane and seeds removed). I also added three cloves of garlic, quartered, and maybe 1/4 cup of sliced white onion. I only boiled everything together for a couple minutes, and then I let it all cool in the pot. When at room temperature, into a glass jar! So good, next time I want to add some cauliflower! Don't be scared of making pickled anything. The reward is worth the effort! Thanks for sharing, JC!

Whole family loves these.  I always add about a tsp of oregano to the pickling liquid as that's how I remember them on the table at our favorite Mexican restaurant in San Diego.  They keep in the fridge for about 2 weeks if they're around that long.

Since I wanted to use these hot peppers to decorate a meat dish I left them whole and added various other hot peppers. They are beautiful and very tasty!

Easy! Made this just for my husband and he enjoyed them. I didn't have jalapeño so I used the left over yellow peppers. Also added salt and oregano.

This was quite a bit more vinegar-y than I am used to having at the restaurants, so after serving them when they were first made, I jarred the remainder with a little more water added to the liquid... I'll come back and add how they turned out after a couple days pickling :)

My husband discovered pickled jalapenos and carrots when he was stationed in San Diego in the Navy.  There wasn't as much liquid as I expected.I've also noticed the consistent additions of oregano and garlic, which I may need to incorporate.  I'm still in the  hour waiting period, so I'll have to update with how he likes them.

I always pickle my own and never add this much sugar, if any at all. You can soften up the carrots by microwaving for a couple minutes. Since I make my own salsa and use this for my heat (that's when you add the sugar to counteract the vinegar) I run it through the food processor so I can just spoon it in without having to do any chopping but also add a few whole ones just in case I want slices or chunky pieces. I also add garlic cloves and peppercorns. Sometimes a Serrano or two. Ever had pickled garlic? Oh, my...
If I grind it I don't even micro the carrots, but I do cook until I see that particular 'color' that you like in pickled jalapenos.

This tastes just like the carrots and jalapeños you can get in Mexican restaurants. A little spicy and delicious! I didn't change a thing and I will definitely make again.

Glad I found this recipe! We eat these at Roberto ' s taco shop all the time. It's a little sweeter, but still good. I added cauliflower because I had it, and it goes with carrots. 

P.S. had these again after they were chilled and they were better tasting! Possibly better than Roberto's! Thanks for the recipe!

There were WAY too many jalapenos in this. As the carrots sit and marinate, they get VERY spicy, and I normally like spicy. I would have partially cooked the carrots as well, so they are only a little crunchy.

I'm giving it 5 stars because it's exactly what I was looking for,  a basic recipe I could make mine.  I'm one of those who can't stand it when reviews have so many changes but I'm doing it any way. Based on other reviews I added some oregano. I also wanted some cauliflower. Of course that meant not enough liquid so I added equal amounts of water and vinegar until there was enough. I followed the other ingredients exactly. For the carrots I bought a bag of carrot chips so they would be perfect.
Follow up: I will agree with other reviewers that it is too sweet but still tastes great! I will definitely be making another batch as soon as this one is gone.

Wow!  I was pleasantly surprised. I left the pepper seeds and membranes in the mix and this has a kick.  My GF loves them. I think this will be a permanent addition to the fridge pickle collection!

To the spice mix I added mexican oregano, whole peppercorns and some celery seed. I included pearl onions and garlic to the jalapenos and carrots. It tasted good after 24 hours in the refrigerator, but I think the mix needs 2 weeks to fully come to life, so I will bring them out at Thanksgving.

I had 20  large jalapenos and I like to use the hot vinegar on my greens (collards, turnip, etc) so I tripled the recipe. I did precook the carrots for about 4 minutes then drained them. Like others, I added a bit (1 TBS) of kosher/canning salt and a bit (1 tsp) of oregano. I used a one gallon pickle jar. I preheated the jar with hot tap water, put the carrots, onions and sliced peppers in it and poured the boiling vinegar solution into the jar. I lightly laid the lid on it and let the heat do its work. They are GREAT!

Reminds me of being in central Mexico. I added a few spices (coriander, cumin, cinnamon and oregano) to the pickling mixture and used a few different types of peppers. It's a hit with the spice lovers here.

I give this recipe 5 star for it's adaptability. You can do anything you want to this recipe and make it your own. I added Bay leaves and peppercorns. These carrots are more addicting than chips.

Good. I used canned jalapeños -- I don't know if it changed how hot it  was, but it was a great combination of sweet and spicy and sour. I added sliced cucumbers, which were also good.

I looked for a recipe like this cause it’s similar to what’s served at a taco truck near my home.
This recipe is the same as Guy Fierri posted at food network, so I figured I should stay with the stock recipe.

I only used 4 jalapeños and 2 or 3 carrots for equal quantities along with near half a yellow onion.
I added veg after sugar had melted in vinegar, but liquid wasn’t enough to cover veg. So I added a bit more vinegar and water and brought it back to simmer.
Then pulled it from heat.

End result is fantastic!
I may try other suggested additions, but can’t say they're necessary.

I didn't slice the Jalapenos. The men loved it and that's what matters.

I love jalapeño and love to learn new recipes so I gave this a try and it is AWESOME. My husband says that it's taste exactly like the restaurant. I added the 4 garlic cloves, 1 tablespoon of peppercorns and 1 tablespoon of oregano that I read in another review on this recipe , I added a cup of water and 1/2 cup of more  vinegar and cooked everything together for a few minutes and we LOVE it!! My husband grew up in Cali eating a lot of Mexican food, I grew up in NY where we really different have much choices so he introduced me to a lot of Mexican food, one being this and was very excited that I found out how to make this.
