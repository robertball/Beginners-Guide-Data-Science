This is an excellent apetizer for the grill also.  I baste with Itallian dressing and put on the grill.  Instead of the toothpick, I use a dry spaghetti noodle.  It melts when done and you don't have to worry about biting into the toothpick.  Great for tailgating parties.

Well, I looked in the freezer, and was pretty much down to the dreaded roast.  Not my husband's favorite.  So I was looking for something different to do with it.  I was kinda skeptical, but this was a real hit.  After his first bite, I got, "WOW, this is great!"  A real compliment considering that I get the eye-roll when I tell him its a new recipe.  I don't like onions, but put them in there anyway.  You don't need to eat them, but it gave it a really good flavor. The meat was done perfect and very tasty.  I put a little bit of garlic in there (mainly habit).  I served with a little bit of horseradish.  Definately a keeper...Thanks!

These were only ok - I had high hopes from the good reviews, but for me they were actually too fatty.  I must prefer bacon on the crisp side, because to have it that soft and tender was unappealing. People seemed to like them, but there were a lot leftover, so they may have just been being nice. Very tender and flavorful, but skip these if you dont like the texture of the white fatty part of meat.

I pounded my steak first, froze it for half an hour & then cut bacon-sized strips out of it. I also clarified my butter because of the long cook time. Allrecipes gives instructions here  http://allrecipes.com/HowTo/Clarifying-Butter/Detail.aspx but it's easier to do in the microwave using a glass container, so that you can see the milky layer. These were incredibly tender & loaded w/ flavor, particularly since I served them w/ Mouthwatering Whiskey Grill Glaze (an allrecipes recipe). Great recipe. Thanks, Kelly Scraper!

Good idea, but bad technique. The rolls were really greasy and the bacon was soft. After cooking as described in the recipe, I would use only 1 Tablespoon of butter, you would need to put these rolls under a broiler to crisp or brown up.

These are great!  I thought for sure the 1 1/3 cup of butter was a mistake, but they turned out perfect and were delicious.  Can't wait to try them with fresh from the butcher shop steak!!

These were quite good.  I clarified the butter as suggested by another reviewer. I also only used a/b 1/3 cup.  After I cooked them, I removed them & added 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar to the sauce in the pan and 3 tbs. brown sugar, and reduced it to a nice glaze, then ladled it over the beef rolls.  Everyone enjoyed it and my husband said it's a "make again".

This recipe was easy and delicious.  I added mushrooms to the onions and butter and it worked out great.  I recommend that everyone try this recipe; I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

These are sooooooooo good! I made for Bunco and many people were a little "scared" to try them (the look a little different), but those who did raved so much that everyone had to have one! The meat gets done PERFECTLY. Deliciously tender. Will definitely make again, I know the men in my house will love it too!!

On a whim, I made these appetizers to take to a friend's house.  I thought they were good, but the men at the party literally ate ALL of them...within a few minutes!  They couldn't stop raving about them.  I thought they were easy to make also - the only downside is having my house smell like onions for the next few days.

Maybe I didn't do this right somehow, but when this was simmering, after 30min the butter was starting to brown but the rolls weren't cooked yet, so I discarded the burning butter and added some fresh butter back to the pan.  After another 30mins the rolls were burnt, and well over done.  I couldn't save anything and had to throw it away.  What a waste.

Great recipe. I used mustard on the beef and than a little pepper. No salt but a medium salted bacon.
It is a recipe i will use again. My family liked it too.

Glorified pigs in a blanket!

These tasted pretty good, although it took a LONG time.  Just because of time restraints, this definitely won't be an "after-work" weeknight recipe... but I might make them again sometime in the future.  My husband enjoyed them more than I did, so maybe it's just a guy thing.  Beef and bacon!  LOL

I had a little bit of a hard time keeping the temperature low enough to just simmer.  The butter kept boiling no matter how low I put it.  I finally had to remove it from the burner completely for around 10 minutes to let it cool down and then return it to lowest heat setting for the duration.

I added some chopped garlic to the butter and onions.  About halfway through the simmering, I added a little chopped piece of garlic to the top of each roll.  This gave it a little bit of extra flavor.  (I also salt and peppered to taste)

We are divided on this one.  My husband loved it.  I hated it.  The beef tasted a lot like pot roast, which is ok, but not what I had expected.  The bacon was awful.  It was soft, but not chewy.  I can't describe it, but I thought the texture of the bacon was disgusting.  I did like the onions.  I put them in the food processor when done and they made a nice gravy.  I will not eat this again, but I know my husband will be asking me to make it.  I give it 2 stars, he gives it 5.

These were very easy to prepare even though the cooking time is long. The meat becomes tender and it has a nice flavor. They could be done as appetizers or as a main course. I will definitely make these again. 

They are great on their own but I think for variation they could be served with a red wine sauce, a blue cheese sauce or some other kind of sauce. I am going to try that next time.

These are awesome! Top sirloin was too expensive, so I changed a letter and went with tip sirloin :)  And I used various seasonings before rolling.  The broth makes good gravy, too.

LOVE IT!! I will admit, I didn't think I would like it as much. 
The 2 hours of simmer is well worth the wait. I added a little garlic but I add garlic to everything.
Overall: A++  I will make it again.

great recipe I added a little brown sugar to the liquid.when it comes to the simmering I think two hours is too long and if the temp is too low it gels and if it is too high it overcooks.a taste extravaganza.

Beef and bacon is almost a no-brainer that it's good together, but I'm not sure I really expected it to be this good. The bacon is nice and soft, and keeps the meat tender as can be (esp. if you use Sirloin as recommended).   I have to say, if you're doing these in a pan you probably don't need much butter at all except to keep the pan from searing and smoking. The bacon grease will do most of your work. However, I actually preferred doing these on the grill - no butter, just great grill flavor! Sprinkle some salt/pepper on them for even more kick.

This was a big hit, and welcome suprise. made a double batch and they were all gone by the end of the night. The only down side was the cost, but well worth it for the right occasion.

even though the final result came out tasting good, this was WAY too much of a hassle. the cook time was way too long for the results i got. and there were soggy problems so i braised them quickly at the end. just cooking them was unappealing, as it cooked in the butter. people liked them, but i wouldn't make them again.

won't make again.  The beef was overdone and I didn't like the wet bacon.

Have some meat in the freezer that's needing used up so thought I'd give this a shot.  The good points:  They were good. :-)  They also cooked well -- I many times have trouble with things that are rolled up getting burnt on the outside while not getting done on the inside.  These started getting overdone in wee little spots, which annoyed me, but I seem to be more picky about that than most people.  So I was overall happy with the results.  They also are kind of interesting looking and I'd love to make mini ones for appetizers.  The bad points: they were a hassle.  I cut the meat as frozen as I could to make that easier, and once cut they were easy to roll.  But still a bit of hassle for an everyday meal.  (I used them for a main dish.)  They are also quite fattening so not something I'd want to make too often.  Maybe cutting meat into 1/8" strips helped burn off some fat. LOL.  I sometimes wish we could do half points (4.5)... but I chose to knock it down to 4 just because of the hassle and fat factors.  Just as a note, I too do not like onions cooked like this, but took the advise of another reviewer and made it with the onions for the added flavor and then just scraped them aside.

They don't cook up very easily.  I didn't go the 2hrs.  It would have been overkill.  Perhaps I'm just spiked with the peppers included.

The meat became very dry, and needed more seasoning, garlic or hot sauce and the bacon was still fatty.

Great recipe but I changed a few things- I didn't have sirloin so I used the cube steak. I cooked the bacon until almost done and I used only 4 tablespoons of butter on the lowest setting of our gas stove. It all turned out really well.
