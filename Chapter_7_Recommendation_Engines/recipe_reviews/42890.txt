Good basic recipe for turkey and I have also used chicken.  I cut out the mushrooms (which I love, hubby don't like) and added 1/2 cup of diced carrots and 1 tablespoon of pimento or to your taste.  It comes jarred at the grocery store.  Have also used this with half and half or milk if you don't have the cream on hand.  Still turns out great.  If it turns out to thin, take a little cold water and corn starch whisk together and add to pan for desired thickness.  Thanks for the post.

I used the package puffed pastry shells and made the recipe for 6. I also added 1 small chopped onion, 1 small jar of pimento for color and a can of cream of chicken soup to thicken it up. My family LOVED this.

This was good, but it needed to be "prettied up" a little. Turkey or chicken, it doesn't matter, and in my case I used rotisserie chicken--and much more than the recipe called for. I also sauteed diced red pepper and onion with the mushrooms, found I needed to double the flour, and added about 1-1/2 T. of dry sherry. I served this in puff pastry shells and garnished the plate with minced fresh parsley. Three stars as written, five stars after some embellishing.

I make this recipe at least once a month.  It is great for left over turkey or chicken.  I use a bag of frozen peas and carrots and add a can of cream of mushroom soup.  Also I never use cream,  I just use milk and add a few Tbsp of flour.

This is a great recipe - reminded me of home, as a kid.  For those who want to cut the fat content and also reduce the need to thicken - use low fat mushroom soup instead of cream and non-hydrogenated margarine instead of butter.  Thanks for this - I will use it again

I doubled the recipe as other reviewers suggested.  I also added 1 chopped red pepper which added more color.  Something I added which I would not add again was a cup of pearl onions.  I did not like the texture and their flavor was overpowering.  If you like onions I would suggest adding some onion powder.  I served this dish over white rice.  I may or may not make it again.  It is however a great way to use up leftover turkey.

This was fantastic for such a simple recipe.  I used Land O Lakes fat free Half and Half and also added one Tablespoon of cooking Sherry.

This was a nice comfort dish that provided a great way to use up the last of the turkey.  I subbed light sour cream in place of the heavy cream and then added a couple tablespoons of chopped onions and some garlic powder after tasting it and finding it needed something more.  I liked it...and it was good with biscuits.

Fantastic and simple recipe.  Needs a good bit of salt and pepper but other than that I wouldn't change a thing.  I serve mine in toast cups.  Simply crumple a piece of bread into a muffin tin.  Bake for about 8 minutes on 350...spoon in the the a la king and voila!

The presentation in the biscuits got me to try this recipe (so adorable). I didn't follow exact due to ingredients on hand, but it was still a great way to use left over turkey. Like a pot pie in a biscuit. I used milk in place of heavy cream and 3 tablespoons of flour. That thickened it nicely. Oh, and I added mixed frozen veggies (green beans, carrots, peas, corn). It was a complete easy meal. Thank you!

Followed recipe and added a few extras: I added about 1/4 c chopped onion and two cloves minced garlic to the butter. Saute that for a bit then added mushrooms (can work well also). Use full can of broth. Added a pea and carrot mixture. Also added about half can of corn. Used half and half. Added a small amt of white wine. And used about 1 tsp flour mixed with water to thicken! We like it over rice. Best leftover turkey recipe I have ever made :)

wow!  Presentation, Taste, Kid Friendly, and Ease of Making all get 5 stars on this one.  I used the pre-cooked chicken, heavy cream (I did have to add a lot more flour to thicken it to the level I liked) Made it for 6 puff pastries.  Added a little garlic and cut the butter in half.  Did add a little poultry seasoning with the salt and pepper.  Used the frozen mixed vegetables that you steam right in the bag, and everyone loved it.  Great!  Will definitely make again!

Great flavor - only changes I made were to replace the mushrooms with a small amount of thinly sliced celery and thinly juliened carrots.  I also seasoned it with 2 tsp. of Tastefully Simple's Smoked Paprika & Garlic seasoning - Yum!  Nice was to use up leftover turkey or chicken!

We doubled the recipe and followed it as written.  Turned out great.  I served it over mashed potatoes and biscuits - their choice.  Great way to use up some leftover turkey (and potatoes).

So tasty! Better than chicken pot pie. I made this for dinner tonight. I served it over flaky buttermilk biscuits. I used a full bag of frozen veggies, a whole bag of pre-cooked frozen cubed chicken, 2 cups of water, 1 cup of heavy cream, 3-4 teaspoons of granulated chicken bouillon, lots of onion and garlic powder and black pepper. No salt needed, the bouillon did the trick! I did not have flour to thicken it up. I just had to cook it on low for about 45 minutes and it was thick enough!

This is a good basic recipe.  I always triple or quadruple the ingredients to make enough for family of 5 and to have leftovers.  I use a bag of frozen mixed vegetables to make it more tasty.  Also if you want the sauce to be thick at all add 1 T flour for every 1 T butter in the white sauce.

This recipe tasted very good.  The kids did not like the looks of it. There was no color and I think that turned them off.  But the taste was very good.

This is an excellent recipe for a post turkey day dinner . It reminded me of my mother's chicken of the same name My daughter and I followed the exact recipe but doubled the quantity which was necessary for our hungry family.  We did have to add more flour and in retrospect could have substited a can of mushroom soup for the cream.  We will definitely make this again.

Family devoured this over toast.  I think I would prefer in a pastry shell, but anything the whole family will eat is a keeper in my book.  I omitted the mushrooms as half the kids won't eat, but added matchstick carrots.  Very good!

Very good and easy too.  I did use canned mushrooms in place of fresh.  I also subbed 1% milk for the heavy cream, and it was plenty thick. In fact, I had to ad more chicken broth to thin it out to my taste.

I used my Thanksgiving turkey leftovers.  I took the advice of others and did not use heavy cream, but 2% milk instead.  Also, in the place of actual flour I used Wondra.  For more flavor, I added garlic powder.  Pepperidge Farm sells puff pastry shells which were amazing with this.  Thanks for a nice recipe

We liked this very much.  I added a very small pinch of poultry seasoning and think the next time (for there WILL be a next time), I will add just a small amount of curry (if only for the heavenly smell).  Thanks for posting.

I'm sure the original recipe is fine all put together, but what's an "a la king" without green peppers & pimentos?  I used a ton of fresh mushrooms, onions, and green peppers cooked in 2T of butter.  I then added 1 can of fat free condensed cream of chicken soup instead of the flour & cream.  (My boyfriend can't do milk products.)  That made a great meal.  Served over the mashed potatoes I had left from Thanksgiving.  Made a delicious meal!

Great base recipe!  I added carrots and onions, and used a half pound of mushrooms (we love mushrooms in our family!!).  I thought it needed a bunch of salt and pepper.  Maybe next time I'll add a little celery and just a touch of garlic....  It was very tasty over egg noodes, would be good over biscuits too!

This sounded so good.  Because we are diabetics that need to loose weight we subsituted milk for the heavy cream and Smart Balance for the butter.  I've had very good results in the past using these subsitutions.  Not in this case.  This was so bland I couldn't eat it.  Would not make again.

After cooking Thanksgiving dinner, I want leftovers to be easy & tasty.  This recipe is exactly that!!!  Only changes I made- I added in a bit of white wine before the broth and added a dollop of leftover homemade Thanksgiving gravy for flavor.  So good and effortless.  Thank you!!!

How do you make the puff pastry boat that is in the photo?  That part of the recipe should be included since that is what is in the picture.

I added some thyme, rosemary, and sage for added flavor.

Pretty good as is, but I like to saute my mushrooms with some chopped onions and a couple minced cloves of garlic in a little bit of olive oil, then add to my sauce. I skip the heavy cream using 2% milk instead. It still comes out nice and flavorful without unnecessary fat and calories. I also always add a jar of chopped pimiento when I add the turkey and peas. It really makes the dish not only prettier, but kicks it up a notch flavor-wise. I always triple (at least!)  the recipe because it is such a hit at our house, everyone wants more the next day! This is also great served over egg noodles, but I most often serve it over buttermilk biscuits - yum!!!

Great recipe for leftover turkey! Instead of the pastry boats, I too doubled this recipe and also used my left over STUFFING, used carrots in place of the peas and transferred mixture to a greased 9x13 baking dish. Next, I spread my leftover stuffing over the top of the turkey mixture. Baked 30-40 mins (depending on how crunchy you like your top) Was a great dish! Will make this again, even if it's not Thanksgiving. I would love to try this recipe in the pastry boats!

I wanted a good recipe for an impromptu lunch with my dad, and this fit the bill. I followed this recipe pretty closely, given what I had on hand. The only substitutions I made were canned mushrooms for fresh, canned green beans for frozen peas and half-and-half for the heavy cream. I omitted the S & P and added a little cooking sherry per a previous reviewer's alteration. We served it over mashed cauliflower and topped our portions with grated Parmesan. Not bad for a quick lunch on the spur of the moment!

Gosh I'm sorry but I didn't like this.  I made it exactly as written except substituted chicken for the turkey.  It reminded me of something from our school cafeteria when i was a kid.  Texture and consistency was fine but seasoning was too bland for all that cream.

This was very good.   Used Low fat plain yogurt instead of cream and thickened using a little cornstarch whisked into turkey stock. I will definitely make this again!

i really enjoyed this although i made a few small alterations.  first i doubled it and got about 4 servings out of the recipe (should have gotten 8 - maybe we just have big appetites!) we served this over egg noodles.  i used fat free half and half instead of cream, a wonderful trick to cut way back on fat and calories without altering the flavor at all.  i didn't use mushrooms, but i diced up a small amount of onion and garlic to saute in the butter before i made the roux.  my 2 year old gave it her stamp of approval and lately that is haaarrrrrddd to get!

This was one of those recipes I had to wrestle with before it gave me the flavor I hoped for. Thanks to previous reviews, I knew the dish would need some "boosting" so I sauteed a diced carrot, 2 diced celery ribs, 1 small diced onion, and one red pepper for about 10 minutes, then added 8 oz. sliced mushrooms. Then I sprinkled about 3 tblsp. of flour over the mix and poured in a can of low-fat evaporated milk (stirring quickly to avoid lumps). After tasting what I had (which was disappointingly bland), I added about 1 c. leftover mashed potatoes and 1/2 c. low-fat sour cream. Then I added about 2 oz. of dry sherry, a tsp. of dried thyme, and some salt and pepper. Better, but not there yet. 

I had an appointment, so I added about 1 c. of turkey, turned off the burner and left the dish in the pan on the stove (covered) for about an hour, hoping for a miracle. Miracle didn't happen, although letting it sit really did help. After reheating it, I added 1 tsp. of chicken bouillon... and that finally brought it up to a dish I feel okay about. It seems unlikely I'll be making this again, but it was fun trying.

Tasty, quick and easy.  Served over egg noodles, and I used the suggested Cream of Mushroom Soup substitute which worked perfectly.  The dish definitely needs a liberal dose of spices (we used lots of black pepper, thyme, basil, and even a little chili powder).

I took the advice of other reviews and added onion and garlic. To bulk it up I added a cup of frozen Thai stir fry vegies and a teaspoon of sugar. I also used 2 tbs of sour cream and half a tsp of dried tarragon. This was fantastic and will be used on a regular basis. Thanks to karin and all the helpful reviews.

This was soooo good and easy.  I made with my son's favorite rice and e-z drop biscuits (from this site).  It was a hit.  The only bad thing about this recipe was that there were no left-overs.

This turned out very tasty. I cooked down a leftover turkey breast carcass to obtain the turkey and broth. Served with fresh (frozen) egg noodles. Yum.

Very good!  I did make a couple of small changes; instead of heavy cream I used half and half and instead of salt I used a sprinkling of instant chicken bouillon.  I also added about a half of a small onion, chopped when browning the butter. Yummy!

This meal was easy to make, very inexpensive (I used leftover turkey). The entire family enjoyed it. My neighbor even popped by and the smell of it cooking was enticing, he begged for leftovers-- and there weren't any!!! Thanks!

this is so good. I have made it a couple of times now and it has turned out perfectly each time. Tonight, it will be over biscuits because I bought the wrong kind of puff pastry. But, it is still amazing! I made exactly as the recipe states as my motto is to always make things according to the recipe the first time. Then the next time you can modify it if need be, but we like this as it is.

Great recipe!  Made some changes per other reviews. Used half and half.  Used 1/4 cup of finely chopped onions and  1/4 cup red peppers. I used land of lakes lite canola butter.  Also used peas and carrots. I whisked together the flour and broth in a separate bowl ( afraid of lumps).  Simmered a little longer to thicken up. My husband loved it!  Will definately make again!

Incredible recipe ! Before I started, I peeled and cut four carrots into coins, steamed them, and then added them with the peas, turkey,  cream and a tad of nutmeg and bouquet garni.  I wanted the dish to be subtle and so I used only cubes of turkey breast. The recipe doubled very well.  Thank you KARIN

Great way to use up leftover turkey from Thanksgiving.  I did sauté some chopped onion, yellow bell pepper and carrot along with the mushrooms to give it a little bit of color.  Thought it was a tad bland, so I added a bit of poultry seasoning.  I did have to thicken it a bit, since the consistency was too thin, but that was not a big deal.  Served over puff pastry shells for a nice presentation.  As written, 4 stars, but with the minor changes I made, it's a 5-star recipe (and that comment is from my husband).  Definitely will be making this whenever I have leftover chicken or turkey.

Whenever we have a family function I ask for some leftover turkey so I can make this.  Very quick and tasty.  The recipe as shown doesn't make a terribly large portion, so I'd recommend doubling or tripling if you have a large family or just a hearty appetite.  

I normally add a red bell pepper to sneak in some extra veggies and serve over Grands biscuits.

Cream kinda ruined it, and I will leave out the mushrooms next time in favor of more turkey. I made the mistake of tasting it before the cream went in and it was SO much better and thicker.

That said, I am grateful for the jumping off point.

This was excellent!  Just what I was looking for!  Didn't change a thing.  It's so simple that it's done in about 5 or 10 minutes!  I will use with Chicken too.  Thank you soooo much!  (I used Imagine Organic chicken broth and it was so good also!  I think it is the best broth I have tasted.)   We put it over spiral macaroni.

Great easy meal.  I have never been successful with a white sauce - but this came out perfectly.  I left out the mushrooms and used half/half and chicken boulion.  Also put it over Bisquick biscutes instead of puff pastry.  Will definitely add this to my recipes.  Double sauce for extra creaminess

This is so reminiscent of my Mom's recipe.  She "dressed it up" with pimientos--so pretty and the taste is not overwhelming.  Thanks for sharing this.  She passed away 10 years ago today and this was a "go to" recipe for after Thanksgiving!

Cook recipe. I did follow the directions explicitly but when I did my taste test and it was a bit bland for my tastes so I did add some onion powder and a can of cream of mushroom soup. This was the kick I was looking for. The basic recipe is a solid one..I just required more flavor.

Very flavorful.  I cooked it and let it sit for about an hour, no one else was home yet.  After letting it sit the flavors really came out.  Served it over mashed potatoes instead of the pastry boat.

Tastes good.  A simple, easy dish.  Served over pastry puffs.  Ours ended up very thin.  Next time we'll add the corn starch like another reviewer recommended.  Still good though.

I agree with a lot of these reviews that it is a little bland and missing something. My issue is following the instructions I could never get this recipe to thicken so we wound up adding some corn starch to lessen the liquid. I also added garlic salt to help it out with flavor but I'd suggest experimenting with some other herbs you know and love in this.   I'd suggest carrots like someone else did - I really wish I noticed someone added it before I finished because it would have been an enjoyable addition. Corn wouldn't hurt as well. With some experimenting this dish would rate higher, as it was it wasn't the best. Good, but room to improve.   I added this to crescent rolls. It seemed to work nicely. Definitely used some of our leftover turkey which helped.

I added sherry (lots!) and chopped onion, and extra mushrooms. It was delicious. If you like extra sauce, just add extra chicken broth and heavy cream to your liking. Served over egg noodles.

Great! I don't know why I used to use Campbell's Mushroom soup for Turkey a la King. This is so easy and so good and probably less sodium than the canned soup. Great going Karin! Mahalo!

Wonderful recipe - I too doubled it and Sauteed the mushroom first with a little butter, minced garlic and red wine and then added fresh carrot slices before adding the chicken broth.  Put it over biscuits and the whole family devoured it.  Very good recipes and not too bad on the fat/calories

This is a delicious way to use leftover Thanksgiving turkey! I used Land o Lakes Light Butter, whole wheat flour, reduced sodium chicken broth, Land o Lakes fat free half & half, and paired it with whole wheat rotini for a healthier version of this quick & easy recipe!

Wonderful recipe.  I ended up serving it over toast which was quite messy but I think next time I will serve it over egg noodles.  Very tasty.  Thanks for sharing!

Great feedback from previous users. My mama used to do the chic a la king using pimentoes.  I've used fresh red pepper for crunch and small diced celery for a bit more texture.  Served over coloured pasta.  Sprinkle of glazed almonds.  Delicious.  Thanks.

This is awesome! I used canned mushrooms cuz I didn't have any fresh & did end up adding some cornstarch to make it a little thicker but the flavor was great. We all loved it. It's not the normal creamed turkey/chicken that I'm used to--it was way better! Thanks so much for this recipe-it's a keeper!!

This was a perfect recipe for leftover thanksgiving turkey.  I doubled the recipe and ended up adding some cornstarch and milk to thicken it a bit.  I made bisquick cheddar biscuits and poured it over the top....TOTAL comfort food right there!  This recipe's definitely a keeper!

My boyfriend and I both loved this recipe though I did modify it a bit.  I added peppers (green and orange), extra mushrooms, an onion and half a bag of frozen vegetables.  I also doubled the sauce b/c of all the extra vegis.  After adding the flour to the frying pan I poured everything into a large soup pan and added the remaining ingredients.  Before adding the diced turkey I rubbed it with spices.  My BF and I like spicy food so once the ingredients were simmering I added some crushed red pepper, chicken seasoning, garlic salt and cayenne pepper.  I served it over basmati rice.  It reheats really well.  I will make this again!

I have made this twice and both times it has been a hit! I just add some extra spices to add more flavor. A sprinkle of garlic, and cayenne pepper. I serve it over rice and it is great.

I doubled this recipe and it was a real hit with the family.  I served it in Pepperidge Farm Puff Pastry Shells that are ready to bake from the freezer.  They make it look extra special.  Served with a tossed salad.

This was very good. Made one change (which is why only 4 stars), used celery, carrot and onion in place of mushrooms and omitted peas. Would absolutely make again.

I was looking for a good turkey à la King recipe like my mother used to make. However this is better! If my mother was alive I'm sure she would agree. I made it according directions minus the mushrooms. I have probably made it 10 times and my family including the picky eater grandchildren all say it's a winner.

Made with a few changes - added 1/2 small onion, I tsp garlic and one can of cream of mushroom soup. I added a bit more turkey than called for. I also added frozen carrots and peas. I had to simmer on low at the end for about 30 minutes until peas/carrots were soft. Served with warm cornbread. Very easy and good.

Great base recipe and you can add what you want to suit your taste. I did use 1/2 and 1/2 because I was out if cream. Still tasted great! This was a great use for the sometimes left over wings after baking a turkey.

This is an awesome recipe for my family and the gravy is outstanding.
I did a couple of tweaks to accomodate my family's tastes and the leftovers in the fridge.  
I didn't have fresh mushrooms, so ground up shitake dried mushrooms - and used 4 tsps worth.
Used green beans chopped small (to the size of peas) instead of peas.
Used leftover Yorkshire puddings instead of biscuit...
so DELICIOUS - however, not sure it serves 4 - more like 2 - will absolutely double recipe next time, this is a fam favourite.

Quick easy dish. I would probably double it next time so that I can have more for leftovers. Will be using it again. Also use 1.5 tablespoons of flour as recommended in the "most helpful reviews".

Halved recipe for self and husband, but still made enough for a second meal. Added additional amount of frozen peas and carrots, half a jar of sliced mushrooms, and several shakes of herbs de Provence and a little white pepper. Served over brown rice. Yummy.

Love this! Reminded me of being a kid :) Like many others I embellished it a bit (so easy to do if you want to), but this recipe is a great start!

I doubled the recipe and added carrots and a diced red pepper. I also added some Sherry in with the broth. Very good adaptable recipe. I did add a little cornstarch at the end to thicken it up a bit. I served this over buttered egg noodles.

I didn't have enough cream, so i filled in with some whole milk. That was the only change I made and it was delicious! I served it over rice and quinoa. My husband said it was a keeper!

Delicious and so easy! I used cream of chicken soup (2/3 can of water only) instead of the cream, broth, flour and water the recipe calls for. I also sauteed chopped onions with the mushrooms. Will make it again!

This was delicious! There were 2 adults and 1 child eating it and we doubled the turkey, mushrooms and peas. There wasn't a drop left. Next time I'd just double the whole thing so there is more gravy. We served it over instant mashed potatoes and I couldn't believe how good it was! So much flavor!

Really easy and delicious.  I doubled the recipe and added a bit more flour.  Since I used seasoned flour (Kentucky Colonel Seasoned Flour), I didn't need to add salt or pepper, and it turned out great!  Served it over biscuits.

easy, delicious way to use some of that leftover turkey.  Simple enough that the kids liked it.  Used some puff pastry and scored the centers so that I could pop them out and fill after baking.  Perfect and homey.

Wonderful basic recipe to start with for my leftover turkey.   Cooked cut up onions and green peppers in butter before adding the flour.  Also added parsley, chives, garlic, and pepper for additional taste.  My family loved it.  As I said, this is a very nice basic recipe in which you can make minor changes and add whatever seasonings that you like.  Thanks.

All 5 in our household gobbled this up.  The only change I made was a splash of sherry.  The batch is very small, though.  I doubled it and had no leftovers and don't feel like anyone had huge servings.  Of course, it was made with leftovers, so maybe that is good.

Had frozen peas and carrots, not peas. Had baking powder biscuits not puff pastry. Point is, basic roux-plus-poultry-plus-cream can adapt to anything, tastes great, and you're a star.

This is pretty good for what it is.  I doubled the recipe and then upped the flour to 4 tablespoons, the chicken to 3 cups and the peas to 1 cup.  I sauteed a small onion and 1/2 cup of matchstick carrots  and 1/4 teaspoon of salt with the mushrooms.  I added 1 1/2 tablespoons of sherry before adding the flour to deglaze the pan a little bit.   I seasoned the final dish with another 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1/4 teaspoon of pepper and 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder.  I served over biscuits.  It was tasty but not all that exciting...kinda like an inside out pot pie.  Great for leftover chicken or turkey.

I've been eating the cream soup version of this since childhood - and I'm 66. My mother always served it in the Pepperidge Farm puff pastry shells which we loved - we lived near the original Pepperidge Farm in Connecticut. I make it now using this recipe, rather than the soup version. I often add a touch of curry powder, to jazz up the taste ambit, and always garnish it with toasted slivered almonds. It's a family favorite - always with the crisp puff pastry to contrast with the creamy filling.

This recipe is great, but I prefer to call it Chicken Pot Pie Puffs since I rarely use turkey and it has the flavor of pot pie. My son (3 years old) and I love it and it's an easy recipe to make. Grab a roasted chicken from the deli at the store and its super easy! I also like to use frozen carrot/peas. It adds some color and tastes delish.

Easy, fast and was a hit. I added onions and used half and half instead of heavy cream. I just let it cook down a little more to thicken it up.

This was great!  I liked it because it didn't use the same old milk with flour option. The cream definitely made the difference.  Instead of chicken stock I used homemade turkey stock from our Thanksgiving turkey, mmmmmm.  My son is allergic to peas so I used frozen carrots and corn that I boiled in water first.

I also liked this and modified it a bit. I omitted the mushrooms because we didn't have any and I added a can of cream of chicken soup and instead of the heavy cream I used 1/2 soup can of half and half. I also added 1 tb. sage and 1/4 tsp. of savoury, a seasoning that was in my spice rack that you can use in turkey stuffing. And instead of flour, I used 1 tb. cornstarch.

I made this for my elderly father and my husband and it was well recieved but we all agreed that "something" was missing.  I added garlic to the butter and sauteed it with the mushrooms and instead of peas I added 2 cups of frozen vegetables and served it with plain white rice.  Quite good as it was but I think I will saute some green or white onions with some celery to fill that missing area.  I was unable to find "heavy" cream, so I used whipping cream, it was smooth and very tasty!

I thought this recipe made the way it says really has no flavor. After I added some onions, garlic and more seasonings I thought it was better. I will have to keep tweeking this to get it right.

Doubled the recipe.  Substituted Mediterranean frozen mixed vegies for mushrooms & Tofutti imitation sour cream for heavy cream (due to milk allergy).  Very good.

Very good recipe, and easy too! The only thing I substituted was fat-free half and half for the heavy cream. I served it over whole grain spaghetti noodles. The kids loved it.

this was really good. I added diced onion and chopped Roma tomato for color(and it is really good for you) I added 1/2 cup more broth and a tablespoon more of flour because of the extra veggies.oh and chopped garlic. I LOVE GARLIC!! served on mashed taters. I would do this one again.easy and inexpensive.

This was really great.  I served it over toast with a few changes. I used canned mushrooms and canned peas, being what I had on hand.  Instead of heavy cream I used non-fat soy milk.  The dish turned out wonderfully with our substitutions.  We will make this again, Thank you.

This was alright.  It seemed a little bland and I had to add more flour to get it to thicken.  Probably won't make again, but it was a quick way to use up leftover turkey anyway.

Delicious AND easy.  What a great way to get rid of the Thanksgiving turkey.  And even when doubled, my family of five finishes it with no leftovers!  A keeper!

Excellent!  We used celery instead of peas, and it adds a soft crunch to the mixture.  Thanks for the recipe.  It is a great help when you have slightly dry Thanksgiving turkey leftovers.

I made a few modifications, as my husband is a picky eater.  I substituted about 1/4 of a small onion, chopped, for the mushrooms.  I also used canned peas and carrots instead of frozen peas, putting them in about 5 minutes before we ate.  It was really good!  I served it over biscuits.  It was more pot pie than a la king, but delicious none the less!

This is a pretty good meal. Good compliments from my husband. One of my kids ate it up, the picky one ate a little without complaining but wasn't excited about it, he did eat some though. And my 15 month old ate it pretty good. Not the kind of recipe that I could say can't wait to have it again, but will probably have it after Thanksgiving.

This was an excellent use for leftover Thanksgiving turkey.  I followed the recipe exactly but served with a basic crepe (no sugar) and sprinkled with fresh grated parmesan cheese.

Loved it! Problem was, I liked it so much that it became 2 servings instead of four. Oops. Doubled the carbs, but was still under my limit of 10 for the meal.

This was a wonderful alternative to the canned Swanson Chicken Ala King.  It was easy to make and delicious.  I also recommend doubling the recipe and serving over Pepperidge Farm pastry puffs. Yummmy!
