This was simply fantastic.  Followed the recipe ingredients and preparation exactly- just changed to all green peppers- and used whole baby carrots.  One tip that really helped with the presentation:  Marinate in the delicious sauce for 24 hrs- then drain them before serving.  They will retain the yummy flavoring but won't be swimming in the sauce. Looks more like a carrot salad.  Ideal for a picnic or buffet table.  Even my picky kids loved this!!  I have added this to my favorites!!  Thanks for the recipe!

This also is a family favorite of mine. This is the dish I bring every Christmas for family gatherings.The only thing I do different is put the soup 1/2c oil,1/4c vin.3/4c.sugar no cayenne,(1 tsp. worcestershire) into a pot on stove and heat on med.until well blended, and sugar melts.I also prefer my veggies just lightly sauted,and I also add mushrooms.

This was very tasty and simple to make.  I didn't have tomato soup, so I substituted French dressing and omitted the oil.  Turned out great!

I love this dish!!  Rich, robust flavor, and the longer it lasts, the better it tastes!  I prefer not to blend the dressing, though, but to just whisk the ingredients. When blended the dressing is a pale orange, like bottled french dressing.  I prefer to have the deeper red hue to my dressing.  No difference in taste, just appearance.  Love this recipe!

Since just for me, I cut the recipe in half.  Instead o soup, I used 2 T. tomato paste and pinch of clove. Used 1/4 c. sugar (and still maybe a little too sweet), 1/4 c. oil (plenty or me). YUMMMM!

This was very good.  I followed the recipe exactly - EXCEPT - I forgot to pre-cook the carrots and didn't remember until it was all assembled except for the peppers.  So I put it in a covered pot, brought it to the boil, turned off the stove and let it cool, then I added the peppers and onions and refrigerated it all. For serving, I drained the excess liquid off the salad.  Everyone enjoyed it although they were certainly surprised at the flavor. Could easily serve at least 12 people.

This was not a big hit in our home. I tried it because I had a two pound bag of Carrots and the Tomato Soup on hand. The five star rating and many excellent reviews prompted me to give it a whirl. It may be better in the summer along with a picnic or cookout but it didn't entice us in the middle of the Winter. I did use whole baby carrots which I do agree make a better presentation. I marinated it overnight and it did blend all the flavors but had a bit too much vinegar for my taste. I like the idea of a Tomato flavor on the Carrots but I just do not like using canned soup in almost any recipe.

This is a great colorful salad for potlucks, and it's nice because it can be made ahead of time and stays nice and crispy.  I made one change due to personal taste, and I just wanted to see how it would be.  I omitted the onion and added chopped fennel bulb.  It was very good.

I wasn't sure about this recipe, but thought I'd give it a try because it was so healthy. Lo and behold, I was eating my heart out at about 1 a.m. when I finished it. It was GREAT! Note:I actually liked it better right after I finished it, not after the wait until the next day. I liked the flavors being a little more separate.

this is really good, i think it would have been better shredded instead of sliced. all the onions and peppers get left behind because the slide off the carrot rounds. make a day ahead. awesome!

I love this recipe in fact in South Africa, where I live, it is called "copper penny salad" and has been around for generations, a great standby during our long hot summers. I try to reduce the oil as most of my family are weight concious.

This went over very well at a pot luck luncheon.  It is so colorfull, which is something I like.  It was still enjoyed a week later.  I used baby carrots and steamed them.

I put diced celery in mine. I also used thinly sliced scallions instead of a chopped onion .  It gives it a more subtile onion flavor that way.  A very pretty and delish salad.  Will keep 3 weeks in the fridge.

I got a recipe like this back in the 70's and we loved it.  It only called for one type of pepper (green) but that's before the others were more widely available.  Ours was a little different because we used prepared mustard and Worcestershire instead of cayenne.  A friend used frozen cut carrots, cooked to save time.  Haven't done that yet.  Seems like we used less oil too.  Thanks for reminding me to use this again.

Delicious My families favorite recipe.  This is exactly like my Mom's recipe.  I have a copy written in her own handwriting.  The really funny part is her name was Dorothy, Aunt Dorothy by my many cousins.  Will make it again next week
