Yum! I'm a coconut fanatic and was pleasantly surprised with this recipe. I didn't have coconut milk, but did have coconut cream. Used just under 1/3 cup and added a little milk to thin it out. The amount of mixture for 3 slices was perfect. Will definitely make this again.

This was very good. I pretty much always make French Toast this way except for using heavy cream rather than coconut milk.  I usually top with our great local strawberries, so the mangoes were a nice change of pace.

Good, although my day-old french bread did not absorb nearly enough of the batter. Make sure your bread is at least a few days stale. Soaking overnight might also help.
