It has been asked, is this a soup? You can certainly make it one, but it is a Greens dish like Spinach.   The volume of liquid is used for boiling, as the greens can be a little tough if not boiled sufficiently, the left over “Broth” makes a great Soup base or you can add vegetables and make it a soup, as the first reviewer has.   Either way this is a good dish!

First time cooking collard greens, I picked this one because it has the simplest ingredients. But I'm not sure WHAT is it suppose to be (a soup?). I measured out the 3Qts of water, boiled down a little bit. I'm going to add cooked sliced carrots to it and make it a soup. (Tastes a bit like spinach, but not as strong flavor).

I was really surprised at how good the flavors were together -- a great alternative to the neverending pork-flavored collard greens. I used a 1-lb bag of prewashed and chopped collards, and a single can of chicken broth instead of all of the water and bouillon, stuffed into a 4-qt pot and stirred after about 5 minutes when it had time to wilt some. Twenty minutes was plenty of cooking time, leaving the collards a beautiful green and still intact, but not at all tough. Using less liquid made the flavors more intense, and I'm sure a whole lot less salty than 6 bouillon cubes! My teenager actually scraped his plate.

Not greasy! Great ginger kick. Don't be afraid to double the garlic and ginger. And definitely add fresh grated ginger...at least as much as the minced garlic.

Pulling together other reviewers' thoughts and suggestions, I used a total of 2 cups of chicken broth in place of the quarts of water and bouillon.  Also, after adding the greens, I let them cook for about 20 minutes rather than an hour.  Other than that, made as directed and it was absolutely delishe!

Hello, I tried this recipe today. I changed a couple ingredients I a used one  vegetable bouillon cube instead of broth and a tablespoon of sugar and olive oil. There's no need for all that liquid, collards have lots of water in them, you only need about a half cup water to 1 pound of collards. If greens are tough add a little baking soda, it will make them tender. This dish was delicious! It's different from the typical southern style but good

Great alternative to using lots of pork or bacon fat. Healthy and very delicious. I used tender collards from my garden and only cooked them 30 minutes. The collards were melt in your mouth tender.
