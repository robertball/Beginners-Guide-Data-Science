Incredible.  My husband recently confessed he was not enjoying all of the yellow squash I had been serving him.  We are eating Paleo and low carb.  Tried this recipe and he thought they were sweet potato fries.  My hubby loves ketchup with his fries, said these were so good they did not need any!  After he cleaned his plate and looked for more, I told him what they were made from.  He still doesn't believe it!  The long baking brings out a real sweetness to the squash.  My garlic burned some before the fries were done so will try garlic powder next time.  Otherwise, this recipe rocks!  Thank you for the new healthy addiction!

We have a bumper crop of butternut squash this year to fix all different ways. 
Seasoned with garlic salt and paprika. Sprayed the cookie sheet with PAM and put them in the oven for 35 minutes
Grilled the other half of this squash outside with the same seasoning for 15 minutes. 
Personally I prefer the oven baked squash fries.

This is my new favorite squash recipe!  My VERY picky two year old even loved it when I told him they were french fries.  I didn't have fresh thyme, and though I'm sure it would be even better, dried was good too.  We will be making this again.

The worst recipe I've gotten from Allrecipes in 15 years! I was doing Butternut Squash for "Three Sisters Soup" which I love, saw this and decided to try it. I used 1/2 of the neck of a big squash to get consistent fries, about 1/2" square, 4" long, shook them in a bag of the ingredients and placed them on a mesh baking rack in my convection oven, figuring both of these would help crispness. Cut time down to 30 min as some reviewers complained about overdone-ness. And I got mush, Bad tasting mush, most of them came apart when I turned them off of the rack. I wasn't expecting McDonald's fries, but these were a huge disappointment, almost inedible---and I like squash! How do you ruin squash??? Well, you can depend on this recipe. Never again.

This is great because our squash is coming in almost daily.
I should have flipped the fries over halfway through cooking because they got a little burned.

But the seasoning mix is 5 stars!

should have made the chips a bit bigger wasn't aware they'd shrink so much in the oven but so easy and yummy.

I think I cut the pieces too large because some of them were overdone but most of it just didn't get crisp at all.  They were really tasty though and my 1 year old twins loved them!

This recipe is wonderful. My husband, who doesn't like vegetables went back for thirds. Next time I'll keep the garlic in larger pieces and slice the squash smaller.

Just brought it out of the oven!  WOW, who knew this squash was so easy to cook and its scrumptious!  The hardest part is peeling it.   I used smoked paprika for a little sniffers the flair.  I grew up with sugary butternut, I am so glad you made this Charlotte!

The seasoning on these was perfect, and the aioli suggestion was great too. I would have liked them a bit crispier, but that can be adjusted based on cooking time and thickness. Thanks for the recipe!
