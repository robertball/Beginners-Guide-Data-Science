It's not the very best to make, but the flavor is great.  They are way to crunchy that at the end they become very tough to eat.

I thought these looked good on the plate, and everyone ate them. They just arent' the cookie that gets requested.  It makes a lot so it's a good "plate filler" when making cookies to give away to neighbors and friends.  There good, but no one raved.

Pretty plain without the chocolate, but I really didn't want to dip them in chocolate.  I tried dipping in caramel but I didn't like that either, so I left them as is.  They turned out okay, but I really wanted more coconut flavor.  Perhaps I'll try them again with chocolate.  Making the button part was kind of annoying; you have to press the shape in before baking but then press again after baking.  I also didn't bake that long; instead, I baked for less time at 350.  thanks for the recipe.
