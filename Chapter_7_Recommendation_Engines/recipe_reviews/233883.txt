We enjoyed this recipe! The technique for the Arborio rice is a little off (make sure you add liquid slowly and stir often only adding more liquid when it's soaked up).

I used the Arborio rice.  The method used in the recipe is not the general method used when preparing risotto, and long grain rice is not typically used either.  I did add broth slowly to the rice mixture and it came out well.

This was so good!!  We followed the recipe as written with the Arborio rice and it came out great even though it is a different way to prepare risotto.  Will definitely make this again

This is the most delicious risotto recipe! I went to Italy last year and this definitely compares! The first time I used turkey bacon to be healthier, but there was no fat leftover to brown the onions in. It came out real good and tasty but later I used the regular bacon, had the leftover fat to brown onions and garlic, and it was admittedly MUCH tastier! But you can do it the healthy way and still have great flavor!

Yum! This makes a large amount, so use a larger pot.

We couldn't find bison bacon, so we used regular bacon. Still delish!
