This is the recipe I have been looking for!  When others have prepared this dip my husband and son have scarfed down the entire thing by themselves so I wanted to make it for them too.  Here is my twist on it:  1.  Canned non-marinated artichokes chopped fine in a food chopper.  2.  Combo cheese blend of asagio, romano and parmasean.  3.  One can each of diced green chili's and jalepeno peppers (a must if you like some kick). 4.  Used light mayo and cream cheese.  5.  Top the dish with more of the parmasean cheese blend and broil for the last few minutes of cooking process.  

My cream cheese had not been set out to room temperature so I chopped it up, put it on top of the other ingredients and microwaved a few minutes to warm it up.  VERY easy to blend that way.  This dish will re-heat well in the oven or mikey the next day (if you have left-overs that is).  This will easily fill a pie plate and we serve with Wheat Thins.  Rave reviews from family and friends.  Give this one a try.

This recipe contains the MAIN ingredient that all other similar artichoke dip recipes fail to include - CREAM CHEESE!  This is the secret key ingredient for the creamy taste and texture.  The only thing I would add to this recipe is a few jalapenos in addition to the green chilies to spice it up a bit.  And, I would suggest topping off the dip with about 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese and broiling it for 5 minutes to give it a nice golden top.  Everyone always begs me for this recipe so enjoy!!!

just thought i would add a personal note after all these years......  after making this time and time again i have made some changes as well.  yes i now add 2 cans of unmarinated artichoke hearts.  i chop them up quite well now.  i cook it for 45 minutes and then broil for about the last 5.  and we love the scoops too.  thanks for all the nice reviews.  cindy

Really, reeeally good! Tastes very similar to the artichoke dip at a local brewery here in Nashville.

I added a bit of garlic and cayenne pepper to mine. I was pretty generous with the cheeses, also. Rave reviews amongst my friends.

This is really good and easy.  I used low-fat mayo and didn't notice any difference in taste.  I'm thinking I might used plain artichokes next time instead of marinated.  I also might add some minced garlic.  Just some ideas, but it's great as is.  I sprinkled paprika on top for some needed color.

Sorry- I didn't think this was so great. It was too greasy. Maybe it's because I used Hellman's - it is not as creamy as Kraft mayo. People did eat it, I'm just used to the more creamy artichoke dips.

Easy to make and incredibly good, even though I felt so guilty now that I know how much cream cheese and mayo goes into this stuff! I'll be making this again. The only problem was that the artichoke pieces were too big to scoop up with the corn chips. (My life is just horrible.)

This was a perfect recipe and very, very easy.  The cream cheese is the secret, which made is very creamy.  I did not use marinated artichokes and used low fat mayo, which I prefer and so did my guests.  I have tried variations with 2 cans of artichoke and adding taco seasoning, but I like this version the best.

VERY delicious. Best home made recipe I've ever found for artichoke dip. Instead of a cup of mayonnaise, I only did 1/2 a cup and added a 1/2 cup of sour cream. I doubled the artichokes and used jalapeno's instead of chiles. Also, I used an italian cheese blend of asiago, parmesan, and a few other cheeses instead of straight parmesan. I took this dish to my class at school with some french bread and crackers and it was all the rave!! I was so pleased!

Absolutely yummy!  Made one change: add one jalapeno pepper, diced... to give it the extra kick.  Served with blue corn tortilla chips.  Brought it to a potluck, and it was literally gone in 10 minutes!

As one reviewer said, this is a great base recipe.  I doubled the recipe.  I used a combination of marinated and canned artichokes and chopped rather than just quartering them. Besides the green chiles I added a can of Rotele tomatoes.  I also used both mayonnaise and light sour cream.  I know I added additional cheese and used a combination of parmesan, asiago and romano.  My guests were scraping the bowl for the last bits--a definite hit.

This was really good... I cut the recipe in half because it was just two of us. I still probably used a good 7oz of artichokes anyway - chopped up in the food processor. I used a little less than 1/2 cup of mayo because I don't like a lot of mayo flavor. I used shredded Parmesan cheese instead of grated and no chile peppers. I did throw some chili powder in tho. It was really, really good!!

This is one of my favorite recipes to make on this site! I never use green chiles; I substitute chopped green pepper or a trinity of vegetables. This recipe is delicious and so easy to make in no time at all.

I got a very similar recipe back in 2005 from a guy I worked with. He left soon after and by default, I inherited the tradition of making this for work gatherings. The version I have is called "Artichoke Chile Dip" and calls for 1 (14 oz) can of artichoke hearts, 3/4 c mayo, 3/4 c sour cream and no cream cheese. When I came across this recipe, I just knew I had to add the cream cheese! I adjusted the mayo and sour cream amounts so I could add some cream cheese as well. Yummy! I generally use more cheese than called for, and use a parmesan blend. My husband likes to add Tabasco. My favorite dipping vessel is a nice hunk of french bread. Broil the top for the last few minutes to get a nice, golden top. Enjoy!

Absolutely delicious.  Followed the recipe exactly.  I included the juice in the chili can since it didn't say anything about that.  I wish I would have warmed the cream cheese before attempting to mix it in...it was a bit rough stirring it.
The reason that I took off one star is because it simply didn't have enough artichoke.  The dip was delicious and cheesy, but I do wish the artichoke was a bit more potent.  

I baked for 30 minutes since it took awhile to brown.

This is the best artichoke dip I've ever had! Before I tried this, I disliked marinated artichokes but I had some in the pantry and wanted an artichoke dip so I gave this a try; it completely changed my view on the marinade. This dip is extremely quick to put together -great for parties- and I always have the ingredients around. I made this first for a holiday and everyone loved it. Really, really good!

I decided at the last minute to make an artichoke dip for a potluck at my home, only to discover that my girlfriend had my favorite recipe.  I found this one, and since I love the combination of cream cheese and green chilies, gave it a try.  I used a 14 oz tin of artichokes, and chopped them quite fine with a food chopper.  I also thought it unnecessary to add more parmesan on top of the dip, so i didn't.  It was a huge hit with everyone, and this recipe will now be the first one I make, instead of the stand-by!

I made this recipe for some good friends and we all loved it. I added a couple of dashes of worcestershire sauce, a 1/2 cup powder parma cheese and a pinch of red pepper flakes instead of the chiles and it was outstanding....

Thanks Cindy! This was a really great recipe. My family
and I enjoy our food a little on the spicy side, so 
along with the diced green chilis, I added some diced
jalapeno's too. WOW what a great recipe. Family and
friends LOVE this one!

Wow. Amazing. The green chiles add a nice zing but it's not too much. The flavors were amazing. Made it for a Christmas app and everyone loved it. Because oven space was at a premium, I nuked it to get it hot and then broiled it to make it crispy and it took less than half the time! Just don't eat too much of it...it's very rich!

Great recipe I opted to use the non marinated artichokes and added an extra can, yes we love artichoke dips! But I do think that next time I will use half the amount of parmesan cheese, was a little on the salty side due to the cheese.

This is DELICIOUS!  Everyone LOVED it.  I chopped the artichokes so there wouldn't be big/uneven pieces and I added chopped jalapenos (the pickled kind in a jar).  I used a real good quality parm cheese that I shredded myself and served with pita chips.  FANTASTIC!  I will be making this again very soon and trying some fresh bread to dip.  YUMM!  Thanks for the recipe!

The first time I made this it was for a brunch so I used thinly sliced bagels from Panera rather than crackers. Everyone not only loved the dip but thought the bagels were a great dipper. I do add a dash of cayenne pepper for a bit of a kick.

Good, I didn't use any mayonaise, and added some little red marinated pepper, that you get from the service deli, and it was good and not as fattening.

Delicious!
I was making this at the last minute for a party, so I had to alter things a bit. I didn't have green chilies, but I sprinkled cayenne pepper on top for color and flavor. I also added a bit of garlic.

I think it's humorous that this is a 32-serving recipe.  Four of us ate the entire thing during the last Packer game.... oops.  That just goes to show how tasty this recipe is!  We add minced garlic, and serve it with French bread.

SOOO addicting! Because I've made it SOOO many times now, I now have a very custom version: use half of the mayo and add fat-free sour cream instead, use neufchatel cheese (lower fat), add lemon zest, green chilies, blanched spinach, a dash of hot sauce, and extra artichoke hearts. I love it with crusty bread. Mmm!

Delicious! I made this for a family dinner and people couldn't keep out of it. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used 2 jars of artichoke hearts. I also made it healthier by using light miracle whip and light chive and onion cream cheese. I just stirred in all the parmesan together and didn't use any for topping. I also made it hotter by using a 7 oz. jar of chile peppers. This recipe is a keeper!

Very well received by my guests.  Have made it with marinated artichokes and canned hearts, does not matter which you use.  Love the flavor of the chilis in it.

Honestly, you cannot go wrong with this recipe.  I omit the green chile peppers (they seem a bit random and unnecessary) and I got a bit heavier on the artichokes.  People die for this dip.  Really.

"Yummy" is sooooo right! I was looking for an artichoke dip without spinach, and this one fits perfectly. Rich, creamy, without too much heat from the peppers. Just the right blend of flavors. We couldn't stop eating it! I added a layer of fresh grated parmesan to the top after mixing/before baking. Served with toasted French bread and Melba toast to better taste the dip. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

This is one of my favorite recipes and I am always being asked to make it for parties.  I have modified it a bit.  I use light mayo and cream cheese you can not tell the difference!!   and I use a large can of NON-marinated hearts and I do chop them up.  I also chop a few cloves of garlic and two to three green onions.   I will only use freshly grated parm.  cheese too.  it really makes a difference.  this is so yummy.  I serve it with crackers,  and fingers finish the bowl!

Fantastic! My guests cleaned the dish! The only thing I changed was to add 1 minced garlic clove. As others suggested, use a top-brand mayo and freshly grated parmesan for the best flavor.

So easy and delicious! I accidentally put the whole 1 1/2 cups of parmeson cheese in which was fine, then sprinkled some ceyanne pepper on top to give some color before baking. Doubled the artichokes and chopped fine. Served with Pita chips. Everyone loved it!

The one recommendation I would make is to kind of chop the artichokes a bit more than quarters.  I bought the marinated, quartered artichokes and made the dip to serve on tortilla scoops, but the artichoke quarters were large.  Others who tried it really liked it, but agreed that the artichokes needed to be kind of chopped more because some bites were just the cheese and mayonaise.

very good - but thought it would be a bit spicer than it was.  Next time will add some red pepper flakes.  Also broil for 1-2 minutes to get a nice crust on top.

Wow!  I have been looking for an artichoke dip recipe like this one ever since I had it at a party a while ago.  The only ingredient I ommitted was the chile peppers because I didn't have any.  Even without them, it had a nice robust flavour.  I added all the ingredients into the food processor and briefly pulsed.  The texture was nice and it saved on time.

I made this recipe today for the first time today. I see I may have to tweak it a bit. I felt like there was more mayo and cream cheese than anything else. This is a good base and the green chile peppers gives it a nice kick. I also added spinach. Next time, I think I'll increase the amount of artichoke and add some more spinach. Pretty good base.

This is a great recipe. The only thing I recommend is to double the amount of artichokes. Meaning at least 2 jars rough chopped so you get artichoke in every bite.

Did not change a thing besides using low-fat Kraft mayo and light cream cheese. I brought this to a party where the host told the guest to just bring an appetizer. Apparently everyone had the same idea as there were 4 artichoke dips! And which one was gone by the end of the evening? This one :) This taste test proves that this is a winner over even store bought. Enjoy!

this is a great recipe...everyone loves it! I do add chopped jalapenos in addition to the green chiles. I make it all in the food processor so there are no jalapeno chunks just the flavor. I use more artichoke hearts than it calls for too but the cream cheese makes it special and thicker. I use low fat cream cheese.

I rated this five stars because I made it for an appetizer for Thanksgiving 2011 and it was a big hit for a family of 50+ people. I thought it was very easy to make, as well as easy to customize for the next time I make it.

This is a really great recipe - I do think that the cream cheese is critical.  I used 2 cans of unmarinated artichoke hearts; 1 1/2 packages of light cream cheese; 1 cup light mayo; 2 cloves of garlic; 1 can of diced green chiles and 1 can of diced jalapenos.  I mix these all in a food processor; adding in a cup of the grated parmesan cheese.  Transfered all to a baking dish and added the remaining 1/2 cup of parmesan to the top.  After baking, I quickly broiled to brown the top of the dip.  Delicious - the jalapenos make a nice addition for a little kick!

This tasted bad.  It was likely my fault because I used two jars of artichoke hearts thinking that would make it better.  I don't recommend using 2 jars unless you are completely doubling the recipe.  Others seemed to like it well enough, but I sure didn't.

This is really yummy artichoke dip. We have made some adjustments to suite our tastes. Added a can of non-marinated artichoke hearts, added a whole bag of Italian cheese and we cook ours in a small crockpot as well.

I have never tried cream cheese in artichoke dip before. Even though I always get asked for my recipe, I'm going to try this cause it sounds to good to pass up. As for the people who are experiencing to oily or greasy of a dip, try omitting the mayo with sour cream by 1/4 cup. That should help. Can't wait to try this recipe. Sounds fantastic. I just know it's going to be a hit! Thanks for posting.:)

Oh Wow...this was so delish!  Made almost as directed.  I did use 2 cans of artichokes (not marinated), low fat mayo and low fat cream cheese.... only because I was trying to cut down cals and fat.
Other than that.... the green chilis added a nice touch! Loved it!

I lalalalooove this recipe. I make it anytime I have company and even though I double it, I never have left overs. I add a little shredded cheese to the top. I just recently figured out this makes an awesome stuffed mushroom! Just use spinach instead of artichoke, minus the parmesean, and add crab, garlic, or whatever you can think of. These are to die for! I have stuffed mushrooms once a week now. Hope you enjoy!

This was alright, but too bland for me.  I even added double the green chile. My guests said they liked it, but it was the only dish left unfinished.

This was really good.  It reminded me of a jalapeno dip I made once.  I put in an 8oz jar of artichokes but I think it needs more.  I didn't taste the artichokes.

Awesome recipe.  But of course changes to suit your tastebuds are always in order.  I used both Jalapenos and green chiles and substituted Pepper jack and spicey habanero/jalapeno cheddar cheese for extra kick.  This was a hit, and wasn't too spicey because of the cream cheese.  Lots of recipe requests after the party and requests to bring it to the next one :)

I puree the artichokes and chile peppers in a food processor before adding to the mixture.  Otherwise, no changes are needed! Perfect recipe!

5 star recipe -- IF -- you don't use the marinated artichokes. Using 1 can of hearts packed in water -- Add some garlic powder and don't skimp on the cheese -- parm, romano, jack...whatever -- just make sure it's grated -- NOT that powdered stuff.  Then OH YEAH!!  SOOOO good!  (btw - light mayo & cream cheese work just fine - save the calories for a nice adult beverage.)  ( :

Was an easy recipe and quick to make. I had everything on hand to make so that made it nice when I needed a quick dish for a pot luck.  Next time I won't use the marinated artichokes though, I didn't like the flavor but everyone at the party loved it.

I liked this.  The green chili peppers added a nice touch, a little something different.  I liked added some parika, as others recommended, for some extra color.  I served this dip with pita chips.  It's a keeper!

I didn't change anything (except added extra artichoke which I can never get enough of!).  AWESOME - I call this "crack dip" because when I start on it I cannot STOP!

I have never made an artichoke dip that called for cream cheese so I thought I would give this recipe a try. It was good but not the best. Even though I doubled the amount of artichokes, I still found the cream cheese to overpower the flavor of them. A couple of other changes I made: ommited the peppers since I didn't have any on hand, but doubled the amount of artichokes. Added a few dashes of Worchestershire, and in addition to the parm, sprinkled the top with paprika. This is a good recipe, but probably better without the cream cheese.

Good recipe, do not use marinated artichoke hearts will get oily, also too much mayo.  I used brined artichokes and only about 2 tbsp mayo, added sour cream instead of all the mayo, this recipe is good to get ideas from, thanks, we ate it right up.

Now, this is a recipe that lives up to its name! I received so many compliments on this. A couple of people who didn't normally like artichokes were surprised to find out how much they enjoyed this dip (they didn't even know it had artichoke in it until I told them). I have made another type of artichoke dip in the past which used mozzarella cheese, and it was greasy and not as tasty. This dip is so easy to make and is so addictingly yummy, that it is now my go-to artichoke dip recipe, and potluck staple. I agree with others to chop the artichokes into smaller pieces (TIP: use kitchen scissors! It's very slippery, so it's hard to cut with a knife safely). Also, I have used both regular and reduced-fat cream cheese and I cannot tell the difference in flavor. (original review: 11/29/2008; edited on 1/25/2019)

I would give this a 10 STARS!It's DELICIOUS and Easy too!
A very IMPOTANT NOTE: BETTER CHOP the artichoke hearts into extremely fine pieces-even better in a food chopping machine- so that the bite would easily fit the tacos or mini french toasted bread(MY favorite!)..And it would taste the same so don't worry!
I found in the market hot pepper cream cheese so i omitted the chopped green chile and turned out to be a very good idea!
I added 1 tsp of garlic powder.
The next time i do it,will definitely add chopped soft onions!!
This Yummy Artichoke Dip is better than any other artichoke dip i've ever tasted and it's mostly because of the Cream cheese!!!I've tried many others where Whipped cream is used instead, or another kind of cheese..but nothing compares to Cream Cheese!!!THis recipe is the ONE.It's definitely a hit for me!Thank you Cindy!

I've taken this to a few parties and it is always enjoyed.  I cut the mayo down to 1/2 cup, it ends up to greasy on the top and it is too much fat if you do a whole cup.

This was outstanding. I had family in from out of town as well as my mother-in-law over for dinner and it was a big hit. My husband's family is from Italy and they are fabulous cooks, so when they ask for a recipe from me I know it was a hit. The only thing I did different was omit the peppers (because I didn't have any and didn't have time to get some).

Def. yummy! Though next time I might try a lowfat mayonnaise cause myself I eat lowfat and only did a couple of scoops because I knew the amount of mayonnaise in it. I added a half of can of jalopeno peppers which everyone loved and chopped the artichoke really small.  The dip was gone in 1 hr.

This was very good. Not oily at all like other's I've had.  Although I did make the following modifications:
--I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese as well as low fat mayonnaise. I also used shredded parmesan and not grated.
--I added one heaping tablespoon of minced garlic to the mix. 
--I didn't have green chiles so I added cayenne pepper. Probably about 3/4 of a teaspoon (maybe a little less). 
--Added dried parsley in the mix as well as on top. 
--Added a dash of breadcrumbs to help the top "crust" a little bit. Also sprinkled a little extra garlic powder as well as paprika on the top. 

It had a nice kick and was a hit a the superbowl party.  Had many request the recipe. This is a keeper.

I added some jalapeños and sun-dried tomatoes to the dip and also cut down the mayo amt per previous reviews.  Tasty but looked unappetizing when it cooled- I kept reheating it.  Will make again- could use things that I had on hand at the house.

Great dip! Took it to Hanukkah party, and got many compliments. Only change was used 1/2 cup light mayo, otherwise no different. Since I made the dip the night before and had to refrigerate it, it took 35 minutes to bake. FYI

This was a very good recipe to start with.  I did like many on here and added fresh jalapeño peppers.  I also added a touch of red pepper, minced garlic, salt, and asigo/parmesan cheese blend.  it came out great.

Made this recipe yesterday for a party. Didn't have Parmesan so substituted Asiago instead. It was a big hit!  Had many people ask for the recipe. Will definitely make this again.

Not Yummy. This should be named parmesan dip with a hint of artichoke. This calls for WAY too much parmesan cheese, it was all i could taste. Try cutting the amount of parmesan in half and dont sprinkle it on top. I would suggest some garlic. One positive was the green chilies, nice touch.

DELICIOUS! 

Extremely unhealthy, but great to take to potlucks. Just make sure other people do most of the eating...

I made this today for a tasty football game munchie, I used what I had so I substituted 1/4 cup jalepeno's minced and a little juice from the jar instead of the can of chilies.  I only have lite mayonaise and I used a 2/3 cup instead of a full cup, the jalepeno juice helped to make it creamy too, I also used 1 cup parmasagne instead of 1 1/2.  It was excellent and even when it got cold we still enjoyed it.  I always think it's unfair to review if you didn't follow the recipe, which I would have if I had planned ahead but this came out great.

Love this.  I've made it several times.  I add a box of spinach sometimes.  I did notice one time we used fat free cream cheese by accident...the oil separated and it looked bad...tasted fine tho.  This is always a hit wherever I bring it.

It's ok to taste this before heating up to make sure you have the right balance. Add sliced jalapenos for a spicy kick.

Easy and great tasting recipe! I doubled the artichokes, but still the flavor was overpowered by the green chilies :o( I added minced garlic, but did everything else as per the recipe. This was a creamy and delicious dip; however, understand that the artichoke flavor is not the most prominent flavor of this dish! Most people at my party actually had no idea this was an artichoke dip! That didn't stop them from scraping the dish clean though ;o) I served this with ritz crackers, tortilla chips and fritos. I think the fritos were the best!

i used to make this all the time at work potlucks.  i've since turned it over to my sister as her 'signature dip'.  she addes a box of frozen spinach to it...defrosted and squeezed dry.  serve w/tortillas.  very popular.  if you're not lactose intolerant.

This is by far my favorite artichoke dip recipe!  The cream cheese and green chiles are a must.  I also added garlic which gives this a nice flavor.

I made this with the chopped jalapenos because I like spicy foods.  I thought in this dish the jalepenos completely took away from the artichoke flavor.  I couldn't taste the artichokes at all.  I would make this again without the peppers and I would double the artichokes.

This recipe is delicious! I doubled it for a larger crowd and added 1 can of green chiles and 1 jalapeno. The tiny bit of heat was fantastic.  I also broiled the dish at the very end and the crust on the top was perfect!  Will make this again and again!

Very good. I made it, reduced the mayonnaise to 3/4 cup, used light cream cheese, omitted the chile peppers, added some red pepper flakes and Tabasco instead and put some shredded cheese on top. Nice little kick!!

This recipe is a perfect dip to take to parties, very easy and everyone loves it.  Based upon the reviews, I did add a jalapeno for a bit more kick/flavor and transferred to a mini-crock pot to keep warm.

This recipe was so good!  The chile peppers really hit the spot. I added some frozen spinach and I will never make a different dip.  Thank you so much!

This was SOOO good.  I wasn't sure about the chili's but they were definitely great!  It makes a huge recipe.  If it's not a huge party and/or you are serving a lot of other things I would recommend splitting the recipe and freezing half for a later time.

This is a hit every time - a sure thing.  I've tried Triscuits, wheat thins and corn tortilla chips and the tortilla chips seem to go over best.  This is one people ask for!

I just made this for a New Years party and got so many compliments.  I was asked to make it again for another party I am going to today.  I added jalapenos for a little more spice.  This was such an easy, yummy appetizer.

very good. I did make some changes so I rated it 4 stars as is. I used my home bottled hot peppers which are generally much hotter than canned peppers, I used about 6 oz. of them. I also substituted montery jack cheese for 1/2 cup of the cheese and only used about 1/2 cup mayo (that just sounded like way too much mayo to me. I don't think there is any way this is 32 servings, I'm pretty sure I could eat most of it myself!

This has become the most requested appetizer at my parties. I changed a couple of things: I use the whole can of artichokes and instead of green chilis, add 1 whole diced red pepper. It is fantastic and the cream cheese makes it thick and not greasy like traditional artichoke dip.

Loved the green peppers added to this!  I think to spicen it up I may ad jalapeno's as well!  I also added a little fresh garlic and this was a favorite at Christmas dinner!  We rand out of crackers and started using tortilla chips and we actually liked the chips better!!  - that's when I got the jalapeno idea! -  Thanks for adding this recipe, I will use again and again!

Tasty and rich--not a five-star recipe because it's a little too heavy on the mayo flavor for my taste.  However, it admittedly is a crowd-pleaser. Tip: bake ahead of time and keep in a crockpot on warm to serve (just stir about every 10-15 minutes to mix).

A BIG crowd-pleaser!  I used canned artichoke hearts in water instead of the marinated ones that tend to make the dish overly oily.  I added a diced jalapeno, a couple shakes of cayenne and red pepper flakes, as well as a dash of salt to kick the flavor up a bit.  I wanted to keep this warm for a party that lasted several hours, so rather than bake this in the oven I combined the ingredients in a crock pot two hours before the event and kept it at a low heat.  My guests went crazy for this!  I doubled the recipe, but with how popular it was I probably should have at least tripled it for my 20-person event.  Excellent dish!

OK! I prepared this recipe for Thanksgiving dinner appetizers and it was a huge hit!  So easy and so pretty when it comes out of the oven!  I hated to have to put it in my serving bowl, but couldn't use a pie dish on the table. :)

The only changes I made were using the 3 cheese mix (for convenience) and 3/4 cup mayo. I am taking this to the Civil War party this Saturday (GO BEAVS). Served with vegtables, chips or bread this dip is a winner!  Thanks for sharing!

Fabulous!  This dip disappeared at our Christmas party and several guests went home with the recipe.  I didn't have the green chilis,so I omitted them, but it certainly didn't hurt the flavor!  I've tried dozen of other artichoke dip recipes and will only use this one from now on.

I agree that cream cheese really makes this recipe. I hate all of these ingredients on their own, but when mixed together it's fantastic! The key also is to use REAL Mayo (Kraft) and not Miracle Whip. I also added a tablespoon of garlic powder and left out the peppers because I don't like them. Fantastic recipe. Best with Club Crackers :)

Yup! This is my NEW artichoke dip recipe. I've been using the same one for years- which was good, but this is GREAT. I love the green chiles, and will probably substitute some jalepenos at another time for a spicier dip. Loved the texture, and got a ton of rave reviews at a bridal shower.

This is the best artichoke dip recipe! I double it for my husband's large family- a cold weather favorite. I used 1 large can of hearts in water instead of marinated and chopped instead of quartered. Perfect served with sourdough. Simple and truly Yummy!!

I made this for a baby shower, and wish that I would have doubled or even tripled the recipe.  It didn't last 5 minutes.  I used half lemonaise, half mayonaise and added chopped black olives.  Also, I used marinated red peppers and a generous amount of fresh grated parm.  Will def put in my recipe box.

Really, really good, and I even use low-fat mayo!  I used 3 garlic cloves instead of the chiles, because I didn't have any.  I mixed it up in my food processor so it was a little bit smoother, but not totally smooth.  Served with a fresh-baked baguette, and crackers.  Happy New Year!

I didn't have Parmesean on hand so I used Pecorino Romano.  I was afraid it might be too salty but I STILL added a couple dashes of Wocestershire-heck, I love salt.  This was made on a stay in, casual, sunday night football night for just my husband and me.  We gobbled it up!  Well, not quite all of it but only because we felt guilty eating it all between only 2 of us.  A definite keeper, and honestly I don't think it needs any revision.

Great recipe.  My only adjustment was that I used a can of un-marinated artichoke hearts(chopped them smaller than quarters) and added a little garlic salt.  I took it to a family party and can't believe how fast it disappeared!

This is delicious and my family loves it.  Even my sister who is very picky eater tried this and loved it. I serve with those Frito Lay Corn Chips - called "Scoops"  they are bigger and go well with this dip.  Quick, easy and great tasting.

I made this recipe and thought I would pass on the results to others....Yummy is the word!  It was a big hit and I will definately make it again.  I did put more parmesan and romano cheese in as I love cheese.  Thumbs up for this one..

I followed this recipe to the letter and it turned out perfect. (I did chop the artichokes into very small pieces though.) I served it with the Tostitos Scoops for chips and it was a big hit. Very easy to do and extremely tasty. Thanks Cindy!

So good. I did not use marinated and made sure I chopped the artichokes real small. I also added extra chili’s and spices to make it a bit spicy ( bonus to that.... kids won’t eat it) so more for you! This will definitely be my main go to hot dip now!

The recipe itself was “eh” I would make it again but it def needs something to break all the salt in the parm cheese and just needs something in general- I guess I would add cayenne- my husband liked it and said it was great but it needed some more herbs and spices and maybe even a meat- great base and texture though..

Great appetizer!  I use regular artichokes, not marinated.   And I chop them up into tiny pieces rather than leave them quartered.  It’s always a hit and I’m left with an empty pie plate at the end of the night :)

For Thanksgiving this year we decided to try this recipe.  We added half a cup of Colby jack grated cheese.  This dip is fantastic.  Warm dip on a cold Thanksgiving kept us cooking all afternoon.

I used 1/2 cup mayo & 1/2 cup sour cream, 1 block cream cheese, 2 jars of artichokes, 1 1/2 cups parmesan cheese, garlic powder, mozzarella cheese.  Mix first four, add 1 cup parmesan cheese, sprinkled garlic powder and about 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese in. Added the last 1/2 cup parmesan cheese to the top. Bake and that's it. Amazing!

It's great! I do make changes though... I add dill weed, minced garlic and two cans of marinated artichoke (I like the flavor).  My family gets so excited when I bring it.

This was the biggest hit at a Presidents day BBQ.  I lightly food processed  the artichoke hearts.  I also added some garlic salt to the mixture and put paprika on top. I added just about 3-4 tablespoons of chopped canned jalapeños.  People wanted it spicier but I think for a mixed crowd of people who love spicer to those who are on the milder side.  It was perfect.  I am making it again.  Easy and delicious!

Really tasty dip! 

The changes I made are: I used the Italian cheese blend instead of just parmesan, I doubled the amount of Artichokes and chopped them up smaller, I also added all the cheese is the dip and did not put any on top.

This dip tastes very creamy is the perfect consistency for nacho chips or pita chips.

I really do not like artichokes so on a whim I made it with shrimp.  Followed the recipe otherwise and added a heaping teaspoon of Old Bay.  Toast some english mufffins and wedge them out and enjoy.

I made this to take to a cocktail party, with "bring a  hors d'oeuver". It was a huge hit. Cooking time was spot on. Bought  2 boxes of Large Wheat Thins to spread this on.  So easy, and I  will make again.

I made this but substituted the green chiles for spinach so my kids would eat it. Great recipe & versatile. Easy to make and easy to change up for different tastes. I may add some chopped red pepper for color next time.

I will make this for every party in the future! I made it for appetizer Christmas Day. It was a HUGE hit and quickly devoured. I only changed a few small things: 1. A few of my cousins hate mayo, so I subbed mayo for sour cream. 2.  I used about double the amount of artichokes (family loves them) and cut them much smaller than the quarters it calls for. 3. Added a bit of cayenne pepper and garlic powder. Otherwise, kept to recipe. Served with crackers and crusty bread. It is decadent but completely delicious and that's what holidays are for, right? This is a keeper that I'll make for years to come!

Great, easy, a crowd pleaser! Doubled the artichokes, added green Pimento-stuffed olives, a finely diced red pepper.  Next time will halve the mayo, as it was pretty prominent.  Served with fresh baguette.

I have made this dip numerous times over the past 3 years. It is wonderful! I must admit that I add a little chopped garlic and minced onion. Then I sprinkle paprika on top. I make it every Holiday season until my Costco size jar or marinated artichokes is empty.

The first time I made this it completely separated when I baked it, there was this disgusting oil slick on top of it and I had to throw it away.  I had enough ingredients to try again, and I was desperate for a dish to take to a party, so I mixed it up again and let it sit in the fridge over night, then once I got to the party I warmed it in the microwave, and it was delicious!  I got rave reviews!

This was awsome. The recipes for adding mozzerella instead of cream cheese are good hot but not good cold. With cream cheese you have the option to serve it cold and it turns out awsome! I didn't have any green chilis available so I used chopped olives, which added some color and some great flavor! Love this recipe you can serve it hot or cold!!

Yum!! I made this last night for a Superbowl party and everyone loved it! I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and a small amount of diced jalepeno's instead of chili's. Baked for about 40 minutes, and boiled for the last 4 or 5 minutes. I served it with the scoops. It was perfect!

This was pretty good.  Liked the green chili addition, but the cream cheese was over the top.  Made it almost too rich.  I'll stick with soupier versions of artichoke dip.

Always reliable and last minute hit for quick get togethers. i have made this several times and have got it to where I can make it my sleep.  I chop the artichokes in a food processor along with a pickled jalapeno and beat all ingredients together with a mixer.

I LOVED this recipe!  I omitted the green chiles and added a 6oz. of white lump crab (refrigerated in the seafood dept of the grocery store) I served it with cut up  Ciabatta bread.  Everyone raved about it.

I didn't have the green chiles. Hopefully this is why I didn't care for it! It was way too much parmesan-really a hard tatse- too salty! Do't think of leaving those chiles out. They must make ALL the difference.

Fantastic. I have made a couple versions of this dip, but this one is the best. The cream cheese really gives the dip a nice consistency. I add a couple of tablespoons of jalepenos for a little kick.

Today is Christmas Day and I have this dip bubbling away in my oven as I type! I made this at Thanksgiving too and everyone loved it. I have tried a few artichoke dip recipes and this one is by far the best. I made a couple changes just to suit our tastes. 3 small jars marinated artichoke hearts drained, 2 small cans chopped green chillies, and I sprinkle the top with garlic powder and paprika. Yummma! Thanks for the great recipe for holiday time or just because! :)

Absolutely delicious!!! I chopped the artichokes into smaller pieces and added a handful of mozzerella cheese & a dash of garlic powder.  So good.  Gone so fast!!
