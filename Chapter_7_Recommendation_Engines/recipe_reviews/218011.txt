Quick and yummy dessert. I substituted stevia for sugar, using half as much as called for. Add 1/4 cup water +/- since stevia doesn't draw out the berry juice like sugar does. Will definitely make again.

If you have someone in your life who's not a dessert-eater (why do such people exist?), this should be your go-to recipe. Find out what kind of fruit they like -- I've made this with everything from mixed berries to peaches to apples -- buy (or make) some good vanilla ice cream, and get out of the way. The syrup that's formed by the cooked fruit & thickened with the tapioca (don't worry - if you don't tell them there's tapioca in it they'll never know), mixed with melting vanilla ice cream is to die for.
