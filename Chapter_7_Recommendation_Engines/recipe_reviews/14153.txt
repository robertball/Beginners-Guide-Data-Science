I have made this dish over 3 dozen times (for catered events, family, parties, etc.)  It always gets raves--no leftovers!!  As recommended by others, I blanch the broccoli florets for about 30 seconds, plunge into ice water until cooled, then drain and dry.  The broccoli stays a  gorgeous green and is easier to eat.  I usually omit the raisins, but have them on the side for sprinkling.  Also, I usually make 1 1/2 times the dressing.  Typically, I mix the salad together with about 1/3 of the dressing and leave covered tightly in the fridge overnight or for several hours-the pasta soaks up the dressing. About 30-60 minutes before serving, I add the rest of the dressing.  This salad is always a hit!

I love this salad, but I find the the dry tortellini (found on the shelf in the pasta aisle) holds up so much better than the refrigerated (and it is a much better bang for your buck).  I used Barilla cheese tortellini, and it was absolutely superb!

Delish!  Make sure to do these few things, and your salad will be Fabulous.  1.) Blanch brocolli peices in almost boiling water for about 1 minute, scoop out and put in ice water to shock and produce a beautiful green 2.) toast sunflower seeds 3.) if you use frozen tortelinni, cook for only 2-3 minutes in not-quite-boiling water- they will be done enough, any longer and they will be mushy and fall apart 4.) make 4 times the dressing called for, use a combo of miricle whip and mayo and only 1/2 cup sugar.  Lastly, mix pasta, broccoli, craisins and 2/3 of the dressing the day before and let it marinate!  Top with the rest of the dressing, seeds and bacon (i didn't use onion) right before serving.  Your family will love this!

Loved this!  Be careful with the tortellini.  I hadn't cooked with it before and it tended to fall apart with too much stirring.  (I may have overcooked it)  I used tri-colored tortellini and craisins for a more festive look, used just less than 1/4 cup sugar and doubled the rest of the dressing ingredients.  I blanched the broccoli for 30 seconds.  I also followed the suggestion to mix salad with 1/3 of dressing and leave covered in fridge overnight.  I added the rest of the dressing an hour before serving.  Oh - and I do wish I would have chopped the onions more finely.  Resulting taste was a bit more "oniony" than intended.  Overall, it turned out wonderfully!  I was concerned that the flavors wouldn't blend well, but this was great together!

Perfection!...I made this for a group of fifty people. Everyone gorged themselves on it and asked for the recipie! Their was nothing left! Three catering trays were devoured!!! The only adjustments I made were as follows...I reduced the sugar, and sugared 'to taste'. I omitted the raisins, as most people do not like them, and replaced them with cashews(WOW!). I was able to find tri-colored frozen tortellini at a wholesale club and it really added to the presentation. I steamed my broccoli as well. Also, ***VERY IMPORTANT TO DO...DOUBLE THE DRESSING*** I added half the night before and the rest before serving. My advice is not to skip this very important step, it makes all the difference in the world. Folks, it doesn't get much better than this!!!!!!!

I bring this to every picnic, super bowl party, baby shower, etc.  It is so so good.  I always make 1.5 times the dressing as recommended by other reviewers.  I like it sweet, so I leave in the sugar.  Also, I blanch the broccoli and onions for a minute before adding them (just throw them into the pasta pot the last minute that the tortellini is cooking) â€“ this makes the broccoli easier to chew and the onions less sharp.

Great recipe which was well received at a recent pot luck dinner. Per other reviews, I did make a few adjustments. For the dressing I used 1 1/2 cups mayo, 6 T sugar and 1 T Cider Vinegar. I reserved some of the dressing to toss just before serving, since pastas absorb a lot of dressing as they sit in the frig. I also save some bacon to sprinkle on top just before serving. Like many others, I did blanch the broccoli. Very tasty recipe!!

Very tasty!  Nice change from the traditional (boring) pasta salad.  Recipe has been requested everytime I've served it.  Just a few suggested changes -  double the dressing, blanche the broccoli, DECREASE THE ONION to about a 1/4, add lightly toasted cashews and use a combination of raisins and craisins.  A little time-consuming but well worth it.  I expect to be making this regularly in the future.

At a large family gathering we were raiding the sweets for an evening snack and my cousin opted for another portion of this salad instead!  Lazy cook that I am, I use barely thawed frozen broccoli florets.  This went directly into my all time favorites file.

I don't understand all the raves on this dish...it's like any other broccoli salad smothered with sweet mayonaise. I made this for a potluck, but I didn't eat this (I tested it though and wasn't impressed) I thought others will like it...which most did. As for me, I wasn't fond of it.  If you are worried about your weight, skip this one...it's too fattening and isn't all that tasty -- UNLESS you like sweet mayonaise on your broccoli and bacon.

The ingredients sound strange in this salad, but they dance on your tongue when you eat it.  Very good.  I've made it for years, and always gets great reviews.  Make ahead and let those noodles soak up the juices of the dressing.  However if you keep overnight, make sure you have extra dressing, as the noodles DO soak up the dressing and it will then seem dry.

I made this recipe for a 4th of July picnic and it was a huge hit. Everyone wanted the recipe. It was a nice change from boring potato & macaroni salads. I made the dressing first which gave the sugar time to dissolve into the mayonaise. I kept mixing it so there wasnt a grainy texture from the sugar in the dressing.What a great recipe, thanks for sharing!

Wow,  loved this salad.  I usually am a nut for changing recipes and modifying them but not with this one.  I did double the cider vinegar,  but thats it.  It was a hit,  my husband loved it,  and can't wait to bring this rocking salad to cook outs this summer.  I used a frozen cheese tortilleni as that was what was on sale.  They held up perfectly for me.  When using fresh or frozen tortellini,  keep in mind they cook very fast,  around 3 minutes or so.  When adding to salads,  keep it on the al dente side,  they will soften up as they sit.  Stir gently when boiling,  and gently toss them with the other ingredients with a soft sided spoon,  such as wood or plastic.  Overall,  excellent recipe!

This is FANTASTIC! I found it a bit too sweet, so I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup, added approx 1 Tbs of the bacon fat to the dressing, and used crannies instead of raisins.  PERFECTION!  I made it twice within a week's time!  Thanks Judy!

The recipe was great!  But I did make some adjustments to the ingredients.  I left out the sugar, and used honey roasted sunflower seeds, used white raisins, and also used sour cream with the mayonaise.  It was sweet enough with out the sugar.  I also steamed the broccoli until tender, and used rice wine vinegar and cider vinegar.

I love this! I've had it before at summer BBQ's, but they never included the tortellini. I love what it adds to this dish! Looking forward to enjoying it as a light lunch tomorrow! --I happened to have some shaved fennel from pizza-making, and added it to this...nice addition :)

I love broccoli salads Judy and tossing tortellini around in there is a great idea.  I'm not too crazy about the cheese and I like to use crasins instead of raisins.  The mayonnaise dressing is a great blend of sweet and tart and is a must for this recipe.  Can't wait to try this out on friends.  Thanks for the submission.

Made this for my brother-in-law who loves the original broccoli salad recipe.  Everybody loved it!  They told me to always use this recipe again.  It looks very impressive if served in a glass bowl and extremely colorful if you use red onion, Craisins and tri-color tortellini.  DEFINITELY A KEEPER!!!

I made this salad for a BBQ this weekend and everyone really enjoyed it. But I will be experimenting with the dressing a bit. I had added some extra broccili to the salad to stretch it a little farther so I also increased the dressing by another half serving but I did not prepare it exactly as directed. I used 3/4 mayo, 4 and 1/2 tablespoons sugar and 2 and 1/2 tablespoons vinegar. I added that much vinegar trying to give it a kick and it was good but I also didn't give the salad much time to sit in the fridge which might have given the flavors more of chance to develop. But aside from the dressing I loved the combo of ingredients. I blanched the broccoli and onions for a minute or 2 per other reviewers suggestions and that turned out really well. And I used toasted sunflower seeds and golden raisins and added 1 extra slice of bacon. Yum! I will be making this again. I especially liked the addition of the tortellini to make it a little different than the type of broccoli salads I have had in the past.

Well, well, everybody rated this recipe with five stars but I wasn't really convinced. I liked the basic idea of sweet and sour but I think there is way too much sugar in this recipe. The raisins alone would have done the job. If you want this to be a bit more on the healthier side reduce sugar and replace half of the mayonnaise with non-fat plain yoghurt. Sorry, I just didn't like it at all.

This is a wonderful "end of summer" salad...I changed a couple of things however...namely, I blanched the broccoli, I soaked the raisins in hot water until they were plump, and I toasted raw seeds, lightly salting them as I baked them in a 400 degree oven.  I prepared the salad, without the dressing, the night before, letting the flavors meld, and on the next morning, before serving it, I lightly seasoned it with granulated garlic and black pepper.  I added the dressing about an hour before serving.  

This salad got rave reviews by all 30 people who tried it, and was one even by a 13 year old boy, whose staple is PB&J!

This dish is a staple during the summer for cookouts. I usually triple the recipe for our family (I only double the broccoli, triple everything else) because people love this stuff so much. The only thing I change is to omit the raisins and sunflower seeds and add in sliced almonds. I do not blanch the broccoli as others have, I love the crisp crunch against the soft tortellini. I also follow the tortellini cooking instructions since I use frozen and only cook about 3-5 minutes. I have even made this and added in some sliced up grilled chicken and made this a main dish. Simply love this recipe!

This was a great recipe.  I blanched the broccoli for 30 seconds exactly.  Any longer and it would have been too soft.  The blanching really brought out the beautiful green in the broccoli.  After blanching, I soaked the florets in ice water. Per another suggestion, I made 1.5 times the dressing, added 1/3 of it right after I made the salad.  Placed everything in a Ziploc in the fridge for a few hours and before I served it, I added the remaining dressing.  I didn't 1.5 times the sugar in the dressing but kept it at 1/2 a cup sine I don't like things super sweet.  I also needed to add some salt to the salad after I made it and it could be because I didn't salt the water enough when I cooked the tortellini.  I also only used 1/4 of a purple onion.  it seems like a whole one would have been too much and it could be because the onion I had was on the larger size.  Everyone complimented me and it was all gone!  This is going to be my new go-to potluck dish!

I followed another reviewer's suggestion and blanched the broccoli for 30 seconds and plunged in ice water--excellent suggestion.  It resulted in a lovely green color and was easier to eat than raw.  The salad generally was too sweet for us, even though I cut back on the sugar.  I also used less onion since I made the salad the evening before and didn't want the onion to overwhelm the other flavors.  I mixed in a portion of the dressing and refrigerated the salad overnight.  Mixed in the remainder of the dressing just before serving. Texture was great, but sweetness seemed not compatible with the pasta.

Great recipe! Followed suggestions made by other reviewers. Cut back to 1/2 onion (and was still strong), cut back to 1/4 c sugar (was plenty), used 3 tsp vinegar, cut back to 1/4 c sunflower seeds, added 1/4 c pecans, omitted raisins and lastly topped w/ some shredded cheddar cheese.  My husband preferred the changes and agreed, recipe could cut back even more on onion. Didn't need to blanche broccoli (prefer more nutrition eating raw veggies). Used frozen tortellini. Had made bacon and eggs for breakfast this morning and was able to prepare bacon for this recipe for dinner saving time. Quick and delicious! Even w/ slight alterations.... still 5 stars!

Good recipe, but Im guessing the sunflower seeds should have been hulled. whoops.  
Oh yeah, and it definitely needed twice the dressing and half the sugar.

Per some other reviews, I decided to  blanch the broccoli and 1/4 c red onion. I used a combination of golden raisins along with regular, and I doubled the recipe for the dressing, putting the first half in immediately after the salad was made- I put it in the fridge overnight, then had individuals add extra dressing to their tastes the following day. Almost everyone used more dressing, as most of it was absorbed overnight.  Taste was good, but a bit dry for some people.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for a large party (double recipe) and everyone loved it!  I did make a few changes based on what other reviewers said and my personal tastes.  I used one third the amount of sugar suggested and I added some fresh ground pepper to the dressing.  I also used all natural reduced fat mayo.  I did not use  a whole red onion (I had very large red onions) so I used approx. one cup finely chopped onion for the double recipe. Lastly, I tripled the dressing amount (only using 1/2 cup sugar total) which seemed perfect for the double recipe that I made. Leftovers are just as tasty the next day although it did seem to be a touch sweeter after sitting in the fridge for 24 hours.  The combination of all the flavors was just so good!  This is not your typical boring pasta salad and that's why it's so yummy. I will definitely make this again!

Update: I don't know why I didn't give this a 5 star originally, but I'm changing it now.  We love this salad and I make it regularly in the summer.  I double the dressing and am glad for the extra.  It is a little sweet, so I use less sugar.  I also only use 2 heads of broccoli.  Usually use an entire pound of bacon.  It's excellent!

Delightful! I made this recipe twice in one week! The first time I made it I followed the recipe to the "T". The second time I used 1/2 Tortellini and 1/2 Garden Rotini mixing the dressing in about 1 hour before serving I preferred the second time I made it but would not hesitate to give the original recipe to a friend. This recipe will make a great "Pot-Luck'er".

One of the best salads I have had!  I followed the recipe except added craisins instead.  I also reduced the red onion slightly and diced very small.  I followed the others' advice and added 1/2 the dressing before serving.  Very easy and delicious!

This recipe was EXCELLENT.  I took the advice of others and doubles the dressing but I used about 3/4 of it the night that I made the salad and the last 1/4 before I brought the dish to a picnic.  Also, I used dried cranberries because I think they are tangier than the raisins and the color is more vibrant.  Beautiful dish - but mostly, tasty Tasty TASTY!

I love this recipe, but I need to cut back on calories. In order to reduce calories, I use turkey bacon and substitute no fat mayonnaise and use bow tie pasta in place of the cheese tortellini. I also prefer dried cranberries to raisins. Both of my daughter-in-laws have requested the recipe. There are no leftovers.

Lovely recipe that I modified slightly. Used 20oz of the dry tortellini and blanched the broccoli in the pasta water at the end of cooking for 2mins.  Used 3/4 cup mayo with 1/4 cup sugar and 3TBLS of cider vinegar. Mixed a the dressing, veggies,pasta and craisins together and chilled over night. Mixed in the bacon and seeds right before serving to my co-workers that loved it. What little that was left tasted even better the next day!! Thank you AMFC

Great recipe and a little more elegant than traditional pasta salad.  I've made it twice--once for a baby shower and another time for a jewelry party.  I also added crasins instead of raisins and omitted the onion.  The boxed/bagged tortellini is just as good as the fresh version.

Had a package of tortellini I wanted to use up along with some broccoli.  This was a very good combination.  I added the broccoli to the last 2 minutes of the boiling tortellini water to make the green "pop" in color.  I would do this again.  Make your dressing up ahead of time so that the sugar has time to melt into the mayonnaise, stirring often.  I used all the ingredients, but changed the order a little bit.  After the dressing was well blended, about an hour I added it to the salad, withholding the sunflower seeds and bacon.  I added those right before serving because I wanted them to still have some crunch.  Good salad and would make it again.

Loved, loved, loved this.  Had it again for lunch today. I used tricolored tortellini for appearance but any cheese tortellini no matter what color would not take away from this salad.  My wife says we have a winner...  which means NO MORE macaroni and Miracle Whip salads in the summer... Can I hear an AMEN!

I was looking for a different recipe to take to a Labor Day cookout, I was tired of potato salad and Macaroni salad. Then I came across this one. It was incredible!! I doubled the dressing like the other users suggested, made a HUGE difference. We bought Barilla's cheese filled tortillini in the bag, and it was delicious. Only thing I omitted were the raisins. A HUGE hit, loved it!

I've been making this recipe for a yr now. It is by far the most requested salad, everyone loves, loves, loves it! The changes that I do is steam the fresh broccoli florets for about 8 to 10 mins tops, remove broccoli from steamer and shock it under cold water. I then pat dry (w/ paper towel) the broccoli for any excess water. Mix salad and put in fridge over night. Simply delicious the next day! I do not add seeds or raisins.

I made some changes to simplify the recipe.  It was a huge hit.  I used 12 oz. of dry tortellini and a 1-pound bag of frozen broccoli (defrosted).  I also increased the mayonnaise to a full cup and the cider vinegar to 2 tablespoons (to balance the sugar).  I cut the red onion to 1/4-1/2 cup.  I highly recommend mixing half the dressing into the salad so the flavors blend.  At serving time add the remaining dressing, bacon and seeds to ensure that they stay crisp.

As I expected, having tried the version with no pasta, this was great! The tortellini was a perfect compliment for the salad. I used Borrela's off the shelf and it was wonderful. I also tripled the dressing and used almost all of it after letting the initial half soak in ahead of time.I also used half the amount of sugar and once used fat free mayo....do NOT do this! It is worth the calories using regular mayo!!Also, used thawed frozen broccoli and was just as good as fresh if not better.

I read all of the reviews and decided to blanch broccoli and 1/4 c red onion. I used crasins instead of rasins. Then I doubled the dressing and increased the cider vinegar using 6 teaspoons. Wow it was great. My family loved it and I told them where I got it. They will all be members one this site soon.  Thx for the great salad idea!

I made this for a family cookout this weekend and everyone thought it was fabulous.  I found I had to make extra dressing to get it as moist as I wanted and then had to add more the next day (after it sat in the fridge all night).  I also used craisins (cherry flavored) instead of raisins.  Great recipe, will definitely make again.

Very good.  I doubled the dressing and it turned out perfect.  I might try almonds instead of sunflower seeds next time.

This was good, but way too sweet for us.  I used 1/4 sugar to 3/4 mayo and a good 2 Tbs. of vinegar.  With the sweetness of the raisens, it was still just too much sweetness.  I would probably try it again, but with even a bit less sugar and a bit more vinegar.  It is a very cool combination of ingredients.  It's got it all -- protein, veggie, starch....

Use less red onion, I used 1/4 cup. Substitute craisins for raisins, add more sauce, using lemon juice in place of the vinegar.  I also shredded cheddar cheese in the salad.  I took this to a potluck and everyone wanted the recipe!

This is the best cold pasta salad ever!!  I have made this salad 3 times and each time people have raved about it, not to mention asked for the recipe.  I added two grilled chx breasts (diced) and doubled the dressing (put half on when I prepared it and half when I served it)  Great recipe, thanks for posting!!

Excellent recipe. I dipped my broccoli heads in the boiling pasta water for a bright green color. Also did 3/4 cup mayo and 3 tsp. vinegar. Was a very pretty looking salad that tastes great! Thanks.

I am giving this 5 stars, because it was very good BUT if you are of the traditional nature like myself, you might prefer Alyson's Broccoli Salad as I do.  Something about the tortellini just wasn't right since i am used to the same salad without the tortellini...  Thank you for sharing.

Wonderful salad!  I didn't blanch the broccoli, only because I had so much else to cook, it would have meant doing one more thing.  I took the advice of the others, and doubled the dressing.  I put the first half on the salad the night before, and the rest about half an hour before serving.  I also omitted the raisins, because no one really likes them.  I used tri coloured tortellini, so it was a very pretty salad, as well as delicious.

I love this salad.  I leave out the pasta and just do it all veggie (with sunflwer seeds of course)  I also use finely chopped dates they are less sweet than raisins.

My suggestion to those who disliked it the first time, use MAYONNAISE  not  MIRACLE WHIP or salad dressing.  This makes a HUGE difference in most salads that call for Mayo.  There IS no substitute for mayo.

did it for lunch tomorrow. I didn't do the mayo, but just spooned over the chicken flavor better-than-boulion instead of sweet mayo. In fact, I sprinkled hemp seeds instead of cheese. and used green onions instead of red. It is really tasty and I'm glad I found this recipe. Otherwise the bag of broccoli and cauliflower would have gone to waste.

This broccoli salad is fantastic.   I followed the advice of many reviewers before more me and I thank them all for their tips.   1) Only cooked the refrigerated tortellini for 2-3 mins.   2) Blanched the broccoli in super hot water for 1 minute.   3) Double the amount of salad dressing!!!     This last bullet is imperative.   I put half the dressing on the night before and the other half just before serving it.     Also, add sugar to the dressing in baby steps (1 T. at a time) and then taste test it.   I personally didn't add nearly the amount of sugar the recipe called for but that is just personal taste.     I waited to add the sunflower seeds and the crumbled bacon to the salad until the last minute as well.   I was worried that they would get soggy overnight and the crunchy texture is part of the salad's uniqueness in my opinion.     This recipe went immediately into my favorite folder!!   Thanks AMFC for sharing it!

I made this to bring to a Memorial Day cookout along with the blueberry and apple pecan pie from this site .  I made the brocolli salad per directions except I bought sunflower seeds in the shell instead of the seeds so I substituted with chopped pecans. I would advise to use only 1/2 of the dressing made the night before and toss with the other half in the morning. Add bacon and nuts just before serving. I received raves and wanted the recipe. Will make many times more

Potluck favorite everytime! People always ask for the recipe. I play with the additions of things like dried cherries or glazed walnuts, etc. and the end result is always an empty bowl on the table and people asking for more.

Awesome salad. I follow the recipe expect use frozen brocolli I let thaw out for a little while, then blanch them. Makes it just a little quicker. A little extra dressing is great too!! Love this recipe.

A huge hit! I did use less than 1/4c sugar, 3/4c mayo and 2Tbsp. cider vinegar, we mixed everything but the pasta and bacon and left sitting for a few hours; then added the last two before serving. It was perfect for my family; the girls devoured the broccoli "trees".

What an excellent salad.  I eliminated the bacon (because some of the people we were serving can't eat pork) and sunflower seeds, and substituted dried cranberries for the raisins (personal preference). With many reviewers saying the dressing was too sweet, I added the sugar gradually, tasting as I went - I believe I ended up using half the required amount.
I did as others suggested about not adding all the dressing right away.  I mixed in about 1/3 when I made it, then added the rest the next day about an hour before serving.  2 days later what little is left is still good.
Got raves about the salad, people taking seconds and requests for the recipe.  I'll be making this again for sure.  Delicious!

I only made half this recipe and it was dinner for 2 and then leftovers for lunch the next day.  Blanced the broccoli as suggested.  Used 1.5x the amount of mayo suggested but used olive oil based mayo to lighten.  Also used turkey bacon for same reason.  Only used 1 tbs raw sugar.  This recipe is sweet enough with the raisins in each bit that the dressing does not need to be that sweet.  Also used mix of sunflower/pumpkin seeds with peanuts since that is what I had in the house.  Only half of recommended onion.  Used tri-color three cheese tortellini for a bit more color.  Wish I had done as recommended by some and held back a bit of the dressing for serving at the table.  A good recipe.  Will make again.

i am going to try to make this weekend.  read the reviews and have a suggestion that works for me which is to use sour cream or yogurt in place of the mayo(or a combo of each) as it does not seem to soak in like all mayo.  perhaps not as much oil?  also use a combo of mayo and sour cream or plain yogurt on potato salad for the same results.

YUMMMMMMMMY!!!!!  I did take the advice of one person and blanch the broccoli.  I actually blanched it in the same water I boiled for the tortellini but I blanched it before I put the tortellini in.  This is so differnet and I LOVE it.

I have made this pasta salad sooooooo many times and it never fails to delight any/all eaters!  I've never used the dried Barilla type tortellini but am willing to try it.  The fresh Buitoni is killer-diller.
It really DOES need more dressing.  The pasta seems to soak it up.  I start with 1 full cup of mayonnaise and adjust the sugar and vinegar to taste.

Really good and tasty. I too blanched the broccoli by throwing it in with the pasta for the last minute of cooking. I probably only used half an onion too because I didn't want it to overpower the dish. I added a little black pepper for my taste and used craisins instead of raisins.

I work at a health food store and made this salad.  I didn't use real bacon and didn't have red onion so I didn't put any in.  It was a big hit.

I followed the recipe but I must have done something wrong since there are so many good reviews. The mayonaise and tortellini tasted awful together.

This is delicious!  I skipped the raisins and used a bottle of Marie's Coleslaw dressing instead of this dressing recipe.   I brought this to a bbq and it disappeared quickly!

This  recipe is very yummy and a balanced meal if you use torellini filled with cheese. I did not have any red onions, and used rice wine vinegar for a touch of sweet but NO SUGAR.  I also used organic canadian bacon.  Next time I won't use quite so many raisins. I'd give this 4 1/2 but only because it has too much sugar.

This salad is beyond fabulous.  I have never reviewed a recipe before but this called for one.  I took a few of the different suggestions..........used half mayo and half miracle whip 'cause I had it and wanted to use it up.  Doubled the amount of dressing as suggested, and used roasted slivered almonds that I had on hand in place of sunflower seeds and raisins.  Rave reviews all around.  I think you can add whatever you prefer to this recipe.  Kudos and many thanks for sharing this.  It's a keeper for sure

Delicious! Used this while camping. Changes I made: used cut up dried strawberries instead of raisins; used Hormel's bacon 1/2-1 c instead of cooking bacon; added chopped carrots; added diced colored peppers; added 1 T vinegar and a shot of chili peppers to the dressing. DELICIOUS!

My grocery deli makes a tortellini salad that is to die for so wanted to find something similar and this is pretty close.  Only difference is no raisins, bacon or sunflower seeds and they have tomatoes in theirs....so I added some halved cherry tomatoes and left out the raisins.  Raisins and tortellini just did not sound appetizing to me.  The dressing is sweet so the raisins would only increase the sweetness level as would any dried fruit.  Other than those changes I made it according to the recipe. I did not double the dressing and found it to be sufficient and did back off on the sugar till I tasted the dressing and I'm glad I did - less sugar was good for us. I liked the addition of the sunflower seeds and the bacon.  I have also made this with tortellini, broccoli, tomato, red onion, paremsan cheese and just a bit of mayo.  A very good salad that allows a lot of flexibllity to suit your tastes.

Very good.  I cut the sugar to only 1/4 cup - I thought 1/2 cup sounded like a bit too much.  It was very good with the 1/4 cup of sugar  - the dressing was plenty sweet.

This salad is always a big hit when I take it to parties. I usually make it the day ahead, then make another half batch of the dressing which I put on about half and hour before serving. That way you get better flavor but don't risk the pasta being hard when you serve it.

made this a couple times, and it just got better.  you can use just white vin for the dressing if you don't have cider vin.  also, I think it's important not to over cook the tortilini because it will fall apart when you toss the salad together.  The final thing that really made this so good was that I blanched then shocked the broccoli.  So bright and it took the dressing better this way.  We loved the salad so much that one time we added cooked, diced chix.

Excellent!! I, too, doubled the dressing and decreased the amount of sugar to 1/4 cup.  I also blanched the broccoli for ~30 seconds.  My kids loved this!  Will be making this frequently.  Thank you!!

I made a few changes..instead of raisins, I used fresh red grapes. I blanched the broccoli and onion for a few minutes,  and doubled the dressing ingredients, except for the sugar, I kept that the same. I didn't have any bacon, so I warmed up some smoked sausage in a skillet and used that instead. It came out delicious...it is a full meal this way. Extra good if you serve it warm...thank you!

This was great! On the advice of others I reduced the sugar to taste, reduced the red onion to 1/4 cup, and made a 2nd batch of the dressing to mix in right before serving. I didn't have sunflower seeds so I used pine nuts (lightly toasted) and omitted the raisins since some people don't like them. I used the pre-cooked bacon since I'm lazy and just put the slices on some tin foil under the broiler to crisp them up. I received many compliments on this salad.

This salad (without the tortellini) is a favorite of my husband's. The addition of the pasta just shows how versatile the recipe is! The proportions on the dressing don't have to be rigid, typically I use 1 cup of mayonnaise (light mayo works fine), 2 tb sugar and 3 tb cider vinegar. This makes a generous amount of dressing to coat the ingredients.

This was a great twist to a tortellini salad. I really enjoyed the sweet and salty taste. I did change one thing. I only added about a 1/4 of the onion. That was enough. And the next time I make it I will add more bacon.

This was very good. You could even add some grilled chicken for a twist. I made it the day before for a party, but I think it would be better if made only a few hours before you eat it.

Easy and Fast for any potluck...many compliments and requests for this recipe.  After reading all the alterations to the original recipe, I tried a fellow reviewer's advice (Mary Domaz on 4/23/03)and it came out perfect.  I will make again when someone asks me to "bring a dish" to a party.

Great with a simple grilled steak or chicken breast, this salad is a myriad of tastes. Make sure you are a fan of all things sweet, tart, and tangy if you plan to make this. If you don't like Miracle Whip, for example, this salad is not for you. Otherwise it's a fun and original alternative to the classic cold pasta salad.

This is a really nice change of pace from the standard broccoli salad I usually make (which I'll be making no longer) The combination of the different ingredients definitely makes this salad. I doubled the dressing; used less sugar & more vinegar to taste. Result was awesome. I got numerous compliments & requests for the recipe. A real keeper!

Very tasty.  Glad I read the other reviews as I also cut down on the sugar and it was still great!

My family loves this recipe.  I made it for a wedding shower and another party.  I was asked for the recipe several times at both events.  A wide variety of people have said they love it. Update: My cousins and I exchanged "favorite recipes" at christmas- one cousin brought this recipe- I had given it to her a few years ago.  So it came full circle.  You can not miss with this.  Make it exactly as it is written and it's a sure winner.

This recipe was well received at our family gathering - I had lots of requests for the recipe.  Very easy to make and a real crowd pleaser.  I did make 1 1/2 times the amount of dressing so it would not be dry and it turned out perfect.

I've made it both with and without the bacon.  I took the broccoli florets and sunflower seeds off the salad bar, and use the Hormel already cooked bacon.  I have had raves about it both with and without the bacon.  I found that it needs more dressing than the recipe calls for.

This is a wonderful recipe and it is always a hit at any function I take it to.  Although, I use dried cranberries instead of raisins.  Yes I make extra dressing and cut back on the sugar. Sometimes I will add grape tomatoes cut into.   For me I can eat this for a meal and nothing else..  Excellent.

This is an amazing recipe! it disappears whenever I make it! I do make a few minor changes though. I don't put in bacon (I'm a vegetarian) and I use craisins instead of raisins and slivered almonds instead of sunflower seeds. The color and flavor is simply perfect!

This was just okay...I kept adding cider vinegar until the taste and consistency was just right, but the rest of the family didn't care for it. I enjoyed it, but being the lone saveur, I saved the dressing in a ziploc and the broccoli in a gladware, with the bacon in a snack size ziploc, so I can enjoy the rest at my leisure. Keeper for me, but not for my family.

HUGE hit as a side dish on Easter. I followed the directions exactly. One thing I would have done differently is follow another's suggestion to blanche the broccoli a bit for a softer texture so that it could absorb the dressing a little.

Good recipe- I followed this recipe without reading any of the comments making a few health conscientious changes. I used light mayo, splenda instead of sugar, 50% less sugar dried cranberries instead of raisins and 5 heads of broccoli. I used the same amount of dressing. Turned out very well and not nearly as heavy as the original recipe. Next time I think I will blanch the broccoli as recommended by others!

Way too much sugar.  All that sugar turns this into a dessert and it loses all its nutrients from the broccoli.  Cut that sugar down and you'll be good to go.

I ordered a version of this salad from a local deli and loved it.  So, I came on allrecipes to try to find a similar recipe.  Thank goodness I did...I could eat this salad for breakfast, lunch and dinner!  For the dressing I mixed 1/2 cup of miracle whip, 1/2 cup regular mayo, and 1/4 cup sugar (which is plenty of sugar--you could easily get away with using even less than 1/4 cup).  I prefer to use golden raisins.  Also, I think it is best if you cut up the broccoli into small bite size pieces (only using the florets and omitting the stem/stalk).  Absolutely my favorite!  Thanks for the recipe!

I love broccoli salad, and this one with the pasta is so good!  I can make it as a complete dinner, and my husband (who is not crazy about veggies) always goes back for seconds.  If I am short on time, I use Lite Italian dressing instead of the sugar and vinegar; that tastes almost the same.  We do leave the raisins out, as neither of us like them.  Very good!

If you chop the broccoli fine enough, that will be sufficient and gives a little crunch to the salad.  Use toasted sunflower seeds.  I also use red seedless grapes cut in half, when available, in place of raisens--such a nice summer salad.

Loved this stuff!  Made as directed except doubled dressing (tho only a little more than 1/2 c sugar - that was plenty sweet). Also saved about 1/4 of the dressing to be added when serving. Next time would do only 1/2 of a red onion; even tho I really like onion, this much was too dominate. Added bacon and seeds when I added the final bit of dressing about 6 hrs later.

I tried this because I like the classic broccoli salad - and this is it pretty much but with tortellini - and thought this would be more like a main dish.  I didn't care for the addition of the tortellini but I'm sure that's just a personal preference.  I think it was because 'sweet' is good with all of the other ingredients but I didn't care for sweet tortellini.

I was not a fan of this salad, although I love the classic broccoli salad without pasta.  There is twice as much sugar in this recipe and it did not make a very good dressing. The pasta picked up no flavor. It's edible, but I gave away what was left, which was most of it.

This was really good!  It's like the salad with ramen noodles, but it's even better with the cheese tortellini.  I took it to a family get-together and there was none left over to bring home, much to my husband's unhappinesss.  I will definitely make this again!

I just made this for my party this weekend.... YUM!! I fried up a whole pound of bacon (not just 6 slices), omitted the raisins, used mostly mayonnaise and a little bit of cole-slaw dressing (I don't like salads like this too sweet)... used boxed dried Barilla-brand tortellini, added about two cups of freshly grated sharp cheddar and definitely blanched the broccoli. Outstanding!!!

loved the recipes.  I did make the following changes to it like others recommended.
-blanched the broccoli
-use about a Â½ cup or so of dried and sweetened cranberries instead of raisins
-use frozen tortellini since they are more sturdy than the fresh ones
-use about Â½ cup or so of sunflower seeds instead of a full cup
-use about 1/3rd of a onion instead of a full onion

At the end, toss the salad with about Â¾ of the dressing and refrigerate.  Right before serving toss the rest of the salad with the remainder of the dressing.

Some people recommended doubling the dressing.  I've made it twice now, once with double the dressing and another time with with slightly less.  Both times I still had too much dressing left over.  I would stick with the original amount of dressing on the recipe.

Brought this to a party yesterday. Big hit! So easy to make and perfect for a pot luck bbq. I added the dressing right before serving so it would dry out. I can't wait to make it again.

This salad is a superb mix of flavors and textures.  The sweet dressing paired with the salty bacon and cheese tortellini is summer salad perfection!  I followed other reviewers suggestions - used dried tortellini and blanched the broccoli - and will make it the same way from now on.  I made a quadruple batch of this salad for a college graduation party and it was completely devoured in 30 minutes!

I've made with white vinegar in a pinch, still turns out good.  Also prefer using Craisins.  Tastes best made the night before (add sunflower seeds just before serving though), or at least given a couple hours for flavors to meld.  Yum!!!

This was absolutely fantastic!  It was a huge hit and I was asked by everyone at the party for the receipe.  I made a couple changes which included doubling the sauce ingredients (mayo, sugar, and cider vinegar) the original amounts did not seem to be quite enough.  I also chose not to add the raisins.

good but pretty sweet...for that reason would probably pair really well as a side w/ something spicy like BBQ ribs w/ a kick.  i used canola mayo too - which tends to taste sweeter to me.  i added about a T of poppy seeds to the dressing and made 1.5x's the dressing recipe in case i had too much broccoli which is hard to judge.  i also used 1/2 c. raisins and 1/2 c. dried currants (chk by the raisins...sunkist product).  next time, i will use the currents only.  they are nice and small and a little less sweet. will def. make again.

I have made this numerous times for various family and friends and it's always devoured and I'm always asked for the recipe!  The only changes I make are doubling all sauce ingredients except the sugar (I keep that at a little less than 1/2 cup) and I blanch both the onions and the broccoli for 30 seconds - 1 minute and I do leave 1/2 of the sauce off until right before serving.  I'm still giving this five stars because those are minor changes.  The true spirit of this awesome recipe is there.  THANK YOU.  I would never have come up with this myself.

An absolute perfect, fresh salad to take to a picnic or any get together. My only suggestion would be to DOUBLE the amount of mayo, sugar and vinegar.

I would actually probably give this 3 and a half stars but I think it could be better with some tweeking. The tortellini was very good (I used a prosciutto and cheese refrigerated kind) and I really liked the idea of blanching the broccoli. I replaced the raisins with unsweetened dried cranberries and the sunflower seeds with pumpkin seeds. I didn't have cider vinegar so I used red wine vinegar. I also sauteed the onions in the bacon grease (I know, I can't help but be a health nut!).  I think that the dressing was way too sweet, even thought I cut back on the sugar (1/4c sugar to 1c mayo). Maybe I'd add more vinegar next time. I also thought it could use more bacon. I enjoyed the first few bites of this, but after half a bowl, it just got too sweet.

EVERY TIME I make this salad there is always somebody that wants the recipe.  I use the frozen bags of tortellini that cook in 5 minutes and it still tastes great. I love bacon but am trying to eat healthier so instead of buying a whole lb of bacon get the real bacon pieces from the salad dressing aisle. 6 Tbsps = 6 slices. Use 1/2 cup of light miracle whip to cut the fat and only 1/2 a red onion is enough in my opinion.

My son loves this salad.  We leave out the raisins and the onion.  It still is the best!!!.  Many people are unsure when they see a salad with tortellini's, but once they try it they are hooked

Good, but only after changes and a night in the fridge to let flavors meld.  I made 1.5 times the dressing, but used only 1/2 the amount of sugar.  I didn't have raisins, so I used craisins which gave it a nice tang.  The sunflower seeds I bought were not salted.  So I definitely had to add a fair amount of salt - in the 1/2 to 1 t. range.  Also, I had used the food processor to shred the onion, which may have released more of the onion juices than desired.  Next time I'll chop by hand.  Lastly, I bought refrigerated tortellini, but only boiled it for 4 minutes - a touch too chewy at that point - to make sure the pasta didn't fall apart during the mixing and to account for the pasta softening while marinating in the sauce overnight.  In the end, it was pretty tasty.

this was a great salad! The tortellini I get comes in a pkg of 12 oz. I made that with 1 triple bunch of broccoli. It served 4. The dressing seems a bit too sweet at first. But if you mix it into the salad about 2 hours before it's really good. I also put craisins instead of raisins, and I put bacos instead of bacon. Will definitely make again!

This is a great recipe for anytime.  The tortellini is a nice touch above the usual broccoli salads I've made.  I did double the amount of dressing, and used 1/2 regular light mayo, 1/2 light miracle whip, but did not double the sugar.  I waited until serving before adding any additional dressing to taste.

Really good, but too sweet as written!  I use 1/4 cup sugar instead of the 1/2 cup called for.  Also blanch the broccoli first to make it more tender. Great for potlucks and large gatherings!

I L-O-V-E this recipe.  I never would have thought these ingredients would taste so good when put together but YUMMY.  I love it as-is, no changes necessary (I like sweet and salty flavors together).  I usually bring this as a dish for potlucks and always get asked for the recipe.

Man, this was good!  I used vegetarian bacon and, per other reviews, cut down on the sugar by half.  It was still pretty sweet and I might use less next time, but it was still amazingly tasty and pretty easy to make.  I'm having guests for the holidays and plan to make this for them.

I have made this recipe several times and everyone LOVES it! I did double the dressing recipe but used only 1/2 cup sugar. I mixed 1/2 dressing with the pasta and mixed the remainder prior to serving. I do omit the onions just because I don't really like the flavor of raw onions. I blanched the broccoli and toasted the sunflower seeds. I also add the bacon a couple of hours prior  to serving. DELICIOUS!!

Delicious!  I've made a several times and have been asked for the recipe each time.  I did make a few changes: 1. Used Miracle Whip instead of Mayo 2. No raisins 3. Only used 1/2 red onion 4. I add all the dressing a few hours before and refrigerate.  Did this by accident first time I made and works just fine.

Eek.  Not good.  I have had this without the tortelli and with coleslaw dressing and it was good. This, however...not good.  The dressing was much too sweet, and the tortelli added a weird flavor.  I'll go back to the old recipe.

This is now my standby for any potluck or party.  I always take copies of the recipe with me because I am always asked for it.  I use dry pasta instead of fresh because it holds up better.  My mom make this ALL the time now.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This recipe was so easy and so tasty! I followed other people's advice and reduced the sugar in the dressing to a 1/4 of a cup and I thought it was perfect. I think it would've been too sweet otherwise. I also only added half a red onion instead of a whole one--but that's just because I thought too much raw red onion would be overpowering. And I also blanched the broccoli for 30 seconds with the pasta, which made it a nice bright green while still keeping the crunch. Yummy!

I definitely will make this again, but next time I'll double the sauce.  Very good!  I used craisins instead of raisins.

Definately not your typical pasta salad.  You'll definately like this if you like brocolli salad.

I actually discovered this recipe on this site a couple of years ago, and have made it several times.  I decided I'd add my 2c.  My hubby & I love this salad!  It's such a delicious combo of flavors, and it's kinda healthy, too (especially if you use low fat mayo & bacon).  I keep it pretty much the same as written, except I cut down the onion amount a little.  I liked one reviewer's advice to briefly blanch the broccoli and onions before stirring it all together.  I think I'll try that next time.  All in all, a great pasta/veggie salad--one that we eat for a meal in itself!

This was a great salad that I served at my son's graduation open house.  There was no leftovers and many requests for the recipe.  I used one cup of mayonaise and 3 teaspoons of vinegar.  I left sugar at 1/2 cup and put no raisins in it per my son's request.  Everybody raved about it.

Made this for a BBQ dinner.  It was great.  I did change it a bit. Made the Tortellini in the morning, used regular vinegar, Reduced onion to 1/2  changed sugar to 1/4 cup Splenda and I left out the raisins.   Everyone enjoyed it and we will definitely make it again.

Excellent recipe!  I made this on a whim for a 4th of July picnic and it got rave reviews.  I used the tri-color tortellini and let me tell you, this is a very beautiful looking salad!  So many colors and flavors.  And very easy to make!

This was very tasty.  I messed up and bought meat-filled ravioli.  I highly recommend you DON'T do that! I'll be redoing it with the cheese kind, and I'm sure it will be an improvement.  Other than my mistake, everything was excellent and delicious.

I served this for a family luncheon and it was not a big hit.  The sweet taste combined with the broccoli was a little too different for my family's taste.  It was a pretty salad however.

This is the best pasta salad recipe I've ever made.  With the suggestions given, I increased the dressing so as to have reserve to add just before serving.  For a different twist, I used cherry flavored craisins, and Maui sweet onion in place of the red onion. 
A friend made this salad the following weekend using Knott's Berry Farm Red Raspberry Vinegairette Dressing in place of the mayo dressing and the result was tasty.  This is a great salad to make your own family tradition with.  Thanks, Judy for a fabulous recipe!

This is an excellent recipe! I followed others' advice and -- blanched the broccoli, used Craisins instead of raisins, omitted the onion and doubled the dressing. I chilled it for about an hour before serving. It was a huge hit at our picnic and several people asked for the recipe.

This was delicious!  Can I give this more stars?  I also followed the review of Mary Domaz and it was perfect.  I didn't have raisins, so I substituted dried cranberries.  I took it to a friend that has a restaurant and she said that it was going on her salad bar immediately.  Some do not like sweet dressing on their vegetables, but it is perfect for us!  Thanks!

yum!  i am not a fan of broccoli, but i love this salad.  i was looking for something a little bit different for memorial day, and this fit the bill nicely.  i followed the other reviews and doubled the dressing, reserving half and adding just before serving.  a hit!

The taste of this salad is DEFINATELY 5 STARS. The only reason I held back one star was because the dressing is very thin and sinks to the bottom of the bowl, I would suggest a way to thicken it but... Betty Crocker I am not. This is still an excellent salad that you MUST try!  (Even kids like it!)

This was okay, but I was disappointed after reading all the raving reviews. The dressing needed something...maybe more vinegar. I think I will try the salad ingredients with a broccoli/caulflower salad dressing I have.

I tried this because of all the good reviews, but I can't say that it lived up to them.  It was good, but I have a recipe that I like better so I  probably won't try this again.

We really liked this recipe.  I would probably cut down on the sugar next time though, but other than that it is a definite keeper.  Thanks for another great recipe.

Perfect combination of textures.  I used chopped walnuts rather than sunflower seeds and would cut down on sugar in dressing next time.  Served it to Mom on Mother's Day.  She loved it!

Recipe has possibilities, but I wasn't totally happy with the dressing.  Thinking I might try ranch dressing in the future.  I can't eat sunflower seeds, so I omitted them.  Steamed the broccoli for 10 minutes before adding.  Also added some grape tomatoes.

I have tried this recipe again and again.  Absolutely love it.  I definitely know MIRACLE WHIP will NOT work with this (so gross).  I've made it with broccoli in and out. Even substituted cashews for a different nutty taste.  Any way you go this is a great recipe and makes plenty for pot luck events...

AWESOME!! Tweeked it a bit. Used 2 cups of the dry tortellini and I left out the sunflower seeds. Per the other reviews I blanched the broccoli. I used 3/4 cup mayo, 1/3 cup sugar and 3 teaspoons cider vinegar. A definite keeper and will be making it again for Memorial Day weekend!!

I make this every time we have a potluck at work and there are never any leftovers! I took an earlier suggestion of making 1 1/2 times the sauce and adding the remaining half right before serving. I always have copies of the recipe with me whenever I bring this dish because I am always being asked for it!

I made this salad for a large group.  Everyone loved it.  Only complaint was not enough dressing.  For me the dressing was to sweet.  i added less sugar and more red wine vinegar.

I cannot get enough of this dish. Not only is it a great way to use up all of your leftover ingredients, but it's easy too! Tasty to eat both hot and cold. My husband and I have this as an entree, however it would be perfect as a side dish for those summer picnics.

I brought this to a potluck and it was a huge hit!  I followed other reviewers tips and blanched the broccoli and onion for 2 minutes, divided the raisins into half raisins and craisins, toasted the sunflower seeds and cut the sugar in half. I also added a head of broccoli, cut the cider vinegar in half and doubled the amount of dressing. I couldn't find dry tortellini in the store so I used fresh and it worked out perfectely. Thank you for this recipe I will definitely be making this again!

Delicious! Make sure to cook the tortellini al dente and blanch the broccoli in the boiling tortellini water to save on time.  I omitted the onions and raisins but kept everything else the same.  Yummy!

Fabulous, but I substituted dried cranberries for the raisins, doubled the dressing as noted before and let this "meld" in the refrigerator overnight.  I added a few chopped cashews as well, just for good measure.  Very excellent salad!

Fantastic salad! It's a hit everytime I make it. I did have to adjust the ingredients a bit as follows: I used 24 oz. tortellini, doubled the bacon, tripled the mayo, reduced sugar to 1/4 cup, used 1/2 cup of craisins instead of raisins, and only used 1/2 cup of sunflower seeds. Sooo yummy. Thanks for posting :)

Very yummy.  I typically do not like broccoli, but I thought I would try this for something different.  Mmm, glad I did!  I tried this with a dried tortellini (in pasta aisle) and another time with frozen tortellini.  Both times turned out great.

I too thought...after the fact, that the broccoli should have been blanched at least. I have a vegetarian boyfriend so couldn't add the bacon and didn't have any vegetarain version of it on hand either! The red onion was way too strong and the ingredients didn't blend well together; because it wasn't cohesive, we were left with the mix of seeds, onions and raisins at the bottom of our bowls. I also did not care for the dressing! I've had a similar broccoli salad with onions, raisins, seeds and cheddar cheese with the same type of dressing - minus the pasta, so I was really hoping for something good and a little more substantial. I won't be making this again!

Fantastic! Great for potlucks or company. I made this for my family and it was a hit! 1 out of 4 (3 teenage boys and husband) said maybe he could do without the raisins next time, just because he's not much for them in general and it did not stop him from eating more!

This is a really good salad.  I've made a similar version of this in the past that didn't call for the tortellini and I actually think I prefer it without the tortellini (personal preference only).  This makes alot (ie leftovers tomorrow).  I'm thinking it's going to taste even better tomorrow.  Thank you for sharing this interesting and delicious recipe!

This recipe is fantastic! Made it exactly as described (sans sunflower seeds, which I didn't have) and there were no leftovers. My grandkids (ages 11, 9 and 4) loved it and asked me to make it again soon. This one's a keeper!

Fantastic recipe.  Made it for a church dinner and it was gone in a flash!  Loved it so well made it at home for dinner.  I added a TBL of red wine vinegar and kosher salt.  This is definately a keeper!

Loved this salad!! I didn't have cider vinegar so I used rice vinegar.  I added chicken which I fried in about a TBSP of the bacon grease. I left out the raisins.  Sprinkled the bacon and the sunflower seeds on top of the salad before serving.  Will definately make again.

This is outstanding! I like the addition of the tortellini to the standard brocolli salad. Very nice. I could have sworn I had sunflower seeds and maybe I do but couldn't find them so I toasted pinenuts and used them. They worked nicely. I made a bit more of the dressing but only used 1/4 cup sugar - that's the way I make my cole slaw dressing. This salad is a bit of work to make but worth the effort. Thank you!

I took the advice to blanche the broccoli first and definitely agree it makes it more colorful and easier to eat. The changes I made: I substituted dried cranberries for raisins and substituted roasted pine nuts for sunflower seeds. I also added a little lemon juice and fresh dill to the dressing. Fabulous recipe!

Delicious, crunchy, can add chicken/shrimp to make a main dish.  Quickly disappeared from buffet table.  Did slightly undercook pasta as recommended and it held together well.  Thank you for a new "favorite"

This salad was great! I loved the cheese tortellini!  I used craisins which gave it some color and tasted great. I did blanch the broccoli as others suggested. I would recommend blanching the red onion as well, because it had an overpowering onion flavor. Otherwise, just cut down on the onion by about half. I did double the dressing as others had suggested, but I really don't think I needed to, even after sitting overnight I had more than enough dressing to coat. Maybe just make sure you have enough dressing ingredients on hand, in case you need to whip up a little more. Overall, very tasty.

Very good pasta salad.  I added shredded cheddar cheese to it (can't have too much cheese) I made it for Thanksgiving so I also substituted craisins instead of raisins.  I also made it the night before to get the flavors to blend, but it got a little dried out, so I ended up adding an addtional 1/4 cup of mayo.  Very flavorful and nice crunch to it.

Excellent!!Everyone at the BBQ had second, even third helpings!  I took the advice from other reviews to blanch the broccoli.  My only complaint is that the recipe calls for WAY too much onion.  Next time I will cut the amount in half and it will be a perfect salad.

I didn't have any apple cider/vinegar left to make this so I subbed with tarragon vinegar. Oh my! This was the best salad ever! It was ready and waiting for the BBQ to start and when I went in in to pull it out of the fridge, half, no, more than half was gone! Seems the guests found it and began munching away! It is a little sweet so next time I will decrease the sugar a bit but other than that it's a keeper!

I did double the dressing as others suggested and marinated overnight using half and reserving the other half.  In the morning, I found that I didn't need the other reserved half. If you want to add nuts to this, do toast them first, but don't add them until you are about to serve.  They stay nice and crunchy that way. I found that the recipe was a little too sweet for my taste, so cutting down on the sugar would be the only way to improve this recipe.  You can always sprinkle a little bit more after it's marinated for a while.  I also substituted dried cranberries for half the raisins.  Everyone wanted this recipe, so it's a keeper!  Caution: This makes a HUGE bowlful. Good for a crowd, or bring half and save some for yourself!

I have made this recipe several times, and the best way is to double the dressing, but keep the sugar the same.  I add whatever veggies I have on hand.

Great salad with a few modifications....I doubled the dressing and could have triped it....I also only used half the amount of sugar.  I made this salad the day before serving it and I think that was totally the way to go!  Flavour was awesome and even the kids at my party loved it!

I made this once and it was a huge hit. Now every party I'm invited to I'm asked to make it again.  Delicous and Almonds instead of sunflower works just as well or even better.

This definately needs to soak in the refrigerator overnight. It gets sooo much better. Next time I would use Miracle Whip instead of Mayo. I used 1# of bacon, and dried cranberries instead of raisins. Also used dried totellini (cooked) and didn't care for the cheese filling, so next time I will buy a better brand and see if that helps. This recipe is good, but not the one I would choose to really, really impress special guests. UPDATE: I finally perfected it and LOVE it. I will leave my 4 star rating although I think, as written, it should be rated maybe 2 stars. The dressing MUST be doubled and since it is too sweet, do not double the sugar!! I always use Miracle Whip now and golden raisins, and lots more bacon. I use only 1-2 heads of broccoli and in my opinion, it must be blanched. The textures go together so much better. This time I also used frozen tortellini which is better than the dried I used previously. It still is a thousand times better after being refrigerated overnight. I will make this often now that I have it to our liking.

I was a bit hesitant to try this recipe because I couldn't picture how all the flavors would fit with each other. But I thought it was great, really light and yummy sweet + salty combo. The only thing I changed about it was I doubled the dressing (but used half the sugar, else it would have been too sweet). I also blanched the broccoli to make it easier to eat. Next time I think I'll use dry tortellini's because they did get a little too soft after sitting in the fridge for a couple hours but in my opinion it didn't hurt the taste/texture of the salad. I kept the raisins on the side to sprinkle on after serving as my husband wouldn't eat them, but they went really well :) Will have this again.

I wish there were 10 stars for this! I LOVE IT!!! I made it with 10 strips of bacon, and cut the suger to 1/4c. I thought it was plenty sweet at that point. I also took others advice and used the dry bage tortellini and blanched the broccoli. This is a keeper!

Wonderful salad - a real crowd pleaser.  Wish I had read the other reviews before I made this, though, because I will use much less sugar next time.  Also, couldn't find sunflower seeds for some reason, and put Wasabi coated p-nuts - wonderful!  I also didn't use raisins - if grapes were meant to look like raisins, they'd grow that way - hate them!

Great recipe - I used less than half the sugar, which is all you really need.  I made it with frozen broccoli, but will try it fresh next time as I'm sure it's much better that way.  I was a little unsure about this recipe when I ate it (a little warm) right after it was made.. but when I ate it cold the next day it was soooo good!

I have used this recipe several times, first time for my daughters wedding, it was a great hit. It has become one of my favorites. This past weekend I made it with the frozen brocolli as suggested by others; I did not like it as well. It changes the texture of the salad. I will not make it that way again. This salad is great as it is, no changes necessary.

Very nice.  A sweeter dressing than I had expected (though, I should have known with the sugar).    I omitted the raisins (didn't have any) and used frozen tortellini (cheaper) and frozen broccoli florets, which I blanched for a minute and plunged into ice water.  I like the texture contrast, though the texture declines after a few hours.  The flavor is still good, though.  If you want the crunch of the broccoli and sunflower seeds, serve it right away.  Otherwise, it's still good later.

This is wonderful! I used crazins and salted sliced almonds instead of rasins and sunflower seeds (already on hand) and it came out great.  I took an extra trip to Costco to buy the tortellini beacuse it was more than half the price less than my local grocery store.  I've made it twice now and getting lots of requests for the recipe.

This is a very good salad that was well-received at a recent dinner I hosted.  Like many reviewers I cut the sugar by half and used less onion.  I also didn't have raisins on hand so I used craisins, but I think golden raisins would've been even better.  I wish I'd made a little more dressing or saved some to add right before serving.

Excellent recipe!  I did modify it a bit.  I used 3/4 cup mayo and only 1/2 cup raisins and 1/2 cup sunflower seeds.  Hubby loves it and asks for it all the time.  Thanks for sharing!

Everybody love this salad! I have my own version of it where I use craisins instead of raisins, leave out the onions, and used pre-cooked bacon to save time. Either way its always a hit!!! Yummy...

This is an absolutely great recipe but I would like to suggest for those who are watching carbs, omit the tortellini and substitute grapes for the raisins.  There are never any leftovers when I serve this.

I made this for my New Years Eve party. I took Nurse Ellens advice and blanched the broccoli for 30 seconds. I also reduced the sugar slightly. As a couple of guests and my daughter are vegetarian. I crumbled the bacon and put it in a seperate bowl to be added by those that wanted it, which worked quite well. A definite make again. Thanks.

One of my all time favorite recipes.  I love this salad and make it anytime someone asks me to bring something to a potluck.  The tortellini brings something special to a traditional broccoli salad.

I was expecting to have leftovers when I made this since there was so much other food, but nope--GONE. This turned out very well and I'll make it again.  I blanched the broccoli, doubled the dressing and used golden rasins.  I almost added more bacon but I'm glad I didn't--it was perfect the way it was.

This salad was absolutely delicous.  I took it to a church potluck last night.  I brought home a small amount intending to eat it.  My husband beat me to it!!!! I used craisins and cashews instead of the raisins and sunflower seeds.  I also used low fat mayo and only 2 tablespoons of sugar.  I made it the day before and didn't add the bacon and cashews until just before we left for the potluck.  That way they stayed crisp.  I also followed others suggestion of half of the dressing when making and half of the dressing just before serving.  Received lots of compliments.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was good! I made it to serve at a BBQ. I substituted regular mayo with FF Miracle Whip and it tasted great. No need for full fat mayo... I would recommend to use the light or fat free version. I reduced the onion to half the amount as recommended. I also followed others' recommendations and steamed the broccoli a few minutes to make it not so hard. I also used tri color tortellini and I think it spruces it up a bit.

wow!  I have made this at least 15 times and every I get asked for the recipe! The only thing I vary is to add sweet onion sometimes in place of red onion.  Beware of onion breath after eating this!  but oh soo good.

Good salad - an interesting blend of flavors - I like the sweetness of the raisins mixed with the savory onions.  I did blanch the broccoli for a few minutes, and doubled the dressing to moisten before serving.  I would also reduce the amount of sunflower seeds as many of them were clumped up on the bottom of the salad no matter how much you mixed it.

I made this recipe at the last minute for a weekend BBQ. It received rave reviews. I took MBUENZLI's advice and increased the dressing by using 1 cup of mayonnaise, 2 tb sugar and 3 tb cider vinegar. I also cut red onions to about Â¼ cup. This is definitely a keeper. My family has me make it at least once a month.

Loved it!  Just needs extra dressing if you are not going to eat it all that day.  I believe the tortellini absorbed quite a bit of the dressing.

This recipe rec'd great reviews at an evening BBQ I hosted for a tough NYC crowd.   I steamed the broccili first, and didn't use so much red onion.  The dressing was a bit sweet, so just added more mayo, and it was delicious.   I'll make this one again.

I made this for a cook-out and everyone loved it.  It's a nice twist to the traditional broccoli salad.

I made this for my son's confirmation and it was a huge hit!  I gave out the recipe 4 times!  Like in other reviews, I doubled the sauce, used 32 oz of tri-color tortellini instead of 20 oz, and also used Crainins instead of the raisins.  The salad is beautiful to look at and tastes great!  This is a keeper!

This was good, but there wasn't enough dressing, and next time I would add less sugar to the dressing.

This was the most excellent salad I have made.  The tortellini hardens in the salad so prepare shortly before serving.  Left out the bacon as not all my guests like it.  I couldn't stop eating it from the time I prepared it until I put it away after the party.  Great recipe!!!!

This is outstanding!  I could eat this for days...and I did!  I used dried cranberries instead of raisins, and bi-color tortellini which made it very pretty (couldn't find tri-color).  I also used pre-cut fresh broccoli, a great time-saver.  Highly recommended!!

This salad is a meal in itself. Loved it. I only used a 1/4 cup of sugar and 2 heads of broccoli and I threw in 2 cups of trail mix instead of just the raisins and sunflower seeds. Next time I will add more bacon and cut back a wee bit on the red onion, which was a bit strong. Very good.

Great recipe. Everytime I take it somewhere I end up sharing the recipe. Great mixture of sweet and salty.  I did end up making a little more sauce as the tortellini absorbs it.

This is a familiar recipe I have tried before with the only change being the tortellini.  I thought the dressing needs less sugar for a smoother consistency.  I added another 1/2 cup of mayo.  Also, the proportions were huge.  I cut down the tortellini to 8oz. and sunflower seeds to a small package.

I made this for a baby shower and it was a huge hit. I doubled the dressing and for 1 batch I put half on and half an hour before serving. For the other batch I doubled the dressing and put it all on right away and it came out great. Everyone raved about this and I had to hand out the recipe to everyone.

This was just wonderful. Everyone loved it. I doubled the sauce part and put half on right away and the other half on about a half hour before I served it. I used 3/4 cup of sugar. I didn't use the raisins as no one really likes them. I will be making this one alot. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I made this tonight for my daughters 2nd birthday party tomorrow.  I blanched the broccoli like others had suggested and made 1 1/2 the dressing.  1/3 of the dressing on tonight, the rest tomorrow. I can't wait to serve it tomorrow! Thanks!  (Turned out to be a pretty good hit at the party, seemed TOO sweet the next day, but still very good, I'll cut the sugar next time)

I made this salad over the weekend for something new to put with the old favorites at our family potluck.  It was delicious.  I've never had tortellini cold and was pleasantly surprised.  This dish makes enough that we enjoyed it the next day too.

Fabulous recipe! Followed it exactly except I reduced the sugar by one tablespoon (I reduced the recipe to four servings). This was pretty darn tasty and we loved it. Cannot wait to try the leftovers for lunch.

Everyone loves this salad since it combines many different flavors!  I usually use tri-color cheese tortellini to give it a little color.  I also use 2 packages of tortellini.

Great flavor and very nice appearance!  I usually don't add the sunflower seeds to the salad but let people sprinkle on their own.  This prevents "soggy" sunflower seeds in the event you would have leftovers, which you probably won't!!

What a great salad!  This was very delicious, high above my expectations.  We followed the recipe, except using less sugar.  Next time, as suggested by others, I would double the dressing because the pasta soaks it up and it gets less if refrigerated. Definitely will make again!

This is a great salad.  On the recommendations of others, I blanched the broccoli which was great advice.  I think I would cut back on the sugar next time.  I also added some salt and pepper.

My family and friends love this salad.  We have made some revisions in the recipe.  We do not add the sunflower seeds or the raisins.  It is wonderful and very kid friendly.

Very good, almost addicting to eat!  I ended up using dried tortellini because I had a bunch on hand, and that worked quite well, although you have to take great care that your tortellini do not fall apart when cooking and mixing the salad!

Made this recipe for a family dinner and everybody loved it.  I had to make more dressing than was called for.  I also used less sugar and it was still quite sweet.  I think that I will try it with a more savory dressing, like a peppercorn ranch.

This was a great recipe. I also added Craisins and thought the taste of the salad was really complex and satisfying. I will definitely bring this to the next get-together to see how it goes over.

This was extremely yummy!  I'm a vegetarian so I subsituted some bacon bits (fake) for the bacon. I doubled the dressing.
I can't wait to make it again!!

"DELICIOUS" is the best way to describe this salad!  My family loved it.  Next time, I will cut down on the amount of sugar called for as well as the sunflower seeds.  I added "craisins" instead of raisins, and the salad had a lovely color!  Thanks for sharing this one.

This was a great change for a holiday cookout meal.  I think preparing it a few hours ahead really made a big difference in the taste and stress on cook.  Didn't have quite enough raisins but that didn't seem to make much difference.  Thanks Judy!

THIS RECIPE WAS MORE THAN WHAT I HAD EXPECTED.  I'M NOT A FAN OF BROCCOLI BUT MUST SAY THIS WAS EXCEPTIONAL.  I MADE IT FOR A SHOWER I WENT TO AND EVERYONE JUST RAVED ABOUT IT.  I DID MAKE A COUPLE OF ADJUSTMENTS AFTER READING THE REVIEWS.  ONE BEING INCREASING THE DRESSING, THE OTHER WAS SUBSTITUTING DRIED CRANBERRIES FOR THE RAISINS....DELICIOUS.

I really enjoyed this dish with all of the different flavors and textures. I used low fat mayonaise to lower the fat content a little. I wonder how it would be using a low fat or no fat ranch dressing and maybe decreasing the sugar a little.

This is an excellent salad recipe.  I blanched the broccoli in boiling water for 3 minutes because it brings out the green color and makes it easier to chew.

Very good! I used 9 pieces of bacon instead of 6 and cut the sugar amount requested by half. I used plain and spinach, garlic, and tomato flavored cheese-stuffed tortellini to add flavor and color to the salad.

I tried this for our July 4th Family  Reunion and it was a hit!  I substituted cashews for the sunflower seeds, since my family likes them better.  The tortellini really adds to this recipe, too.  It keeps it from being just another broccoli salad!---Steff

Our family loves this salad, because it's a great summertime dish.  It's  a meal in itself, but is also great to take to Potlucks and Cook-outs.  It's nutritious, appealing to the eye and delicious!

I had made salads like this without the added pasta, but this is really terrific. It will be a standard at my dinner parties.

Had this one at a potluck over memorial weekend while camping.  Easy to prepare and they licked the bowl clean.  I added 1/4 cup of milk to the dressing it seemed to coat better.  Thumbs up to this one!

This one is really good!  The taste is wonderful and the texture is very nice. A pleasant change from the "usual" pasta salad.  Because I don't like this kind of salad to be overly sweet, I reduce sugar to 1/4 cup. This recipe got rave reviews from my picky family.

This recipe is excellent. This was easy to make. I read all of the reviews and reduced the sugar by three quarters because I donâ€™t really like sweet foods. Next time I will make double the sauce. I would like extra. It was still really good even though I only marinated it for an hour.

I usually donâ€™t review when i donâ€™t follow the recipe. I donâ€™t like raisins and donâ€™t have sunflower seeds but it wasnâ€™t necessary as this salad was awesome without them. I will try to remember sunflower seeds next time i make it.

Used fresh red grapes vs raisins
Dressing was too sweet so I added Miracle whip to the original amount - it was not enough dressing anyway.

Really love this salad.  I strain out the tortellini into the colander  and rinse, then dump my chopped broccoli into the already boiling water, count to 30 and drain and rinse quickly. Beautiful bright green and easy peasy! This really is delicious!

Soooo tasty! I made it with spinach tortellini and craisins and skipped the onion. I used a raspberry vinaigrette.  I used fresh baby broccoli which was lovely too.

WAY too much sugar. I halved it initially and it was still way way too sweet. We really liked the mixture though so I'll probably make it again and only put 1/8 cup of sugar in...
Will definitely follow the suggestions of others and blanch the broccoli next time. Also omitted the onion.

This was very good! I eliminated the sugar entirely and it was perfectly good without. Out of personal preference I sautÃ©ed the red onion in olive oil and used craisins instead of raisins. My family and I will make this again!

I prep my salads into mason jars. I layered the salads in this order: coleslaw dressing, grape tomatoes, broccoli, tortellini, bacon, green onions, dried cranberries, raisins, and pumpkin seeds. I was hoping to add a spinach mix on top, but ran out of room. This pasta salad is the perfect mix of salty and sweet.

I've made this recipe at least 6 or 7 times in several variations.  The original recipe is good but I found that using southern style coleslaw dressing instead of the mayo/sugar/vinegar dressing is better (and even easier).  Sometimes I use peas instead of broccoli but when I do use broccoli I found that blanching it is best.

I have made this wonderful dish more than a dozen times, and probably closer to 2 dozen times. Always a big favorite! I always send them to AllRecipes.com and this recipe. I have wanted to say thank you for posting this for a long time! My tip if you make this often, is to bake the whole package of bacon on  a cookie sheet(s), then drain, set strips on paper towels. Separate strips into 4 batches with paper towels and fold up each into a container for freezing.

I adjusted the serving size and made this for 300 people at my church. People request it often and we make it for our volunteers every 5 weeks as it's a favorite. I didn't change a thing. Everyone loved the sweetness of it. It was perfect with out any changes at all.

It's good, but unless you just want to rot your teeth and get extra calories without any added nutrition it doesn't need all that sugar.  I put in half the amount in the recipe and it was still a little too sweet for me.  Next time I will make it with 1/4 the amount of sugar.

Doubled the recipe for large party. Instead of using 2 pkgs of Tortellini I substituted one of the pkg with that colorful macaroni. Everyone loved it!!

This is an excellent salad, could also be a good side dish.  Make sure not to overcook the tortellini.

Ann really likes this, so I upped the rating to a '5'.  Don't serve this cold - let it warm to room temperature, she suggests.

Good idea, but the dressing is too sweet for the cheese-filled tortellini in my opinion.  I did follow others' suggestions and mixed with about half of the dressing, decided the sweet dressing didn't work, so finished with ranch dressing instead. Family gathering enjoyed it.

Made this up for a family gathering, and it went over pretty well.  I cut back on the sugar and thought it was still slightly too sweet.  I'm not sure if I would make it again, it just didn't "do it" for me.

This was ok.  I made it because I had both tortellini and broccoli in the fridge for different recipes and needed to use them up.  I didn't add bacon and used plain yogurt instead of mayo to keep the fat content of this salad in check.  Worked as a good way to use up ingredients in the fridge

This was delicious and a nice substitute for traditional macaroni or potato salad.  I omitted the red onion.  I also added the sugar to my liking as it can get too sweet. If you are planning on having leftovers, I suggest you make an extra serving of the dressing and keep it aside. When you are ready to serve this mix in some more dressing.  The pasta soaks the dressing right up, so you want to have extra dressing.

Other than using craisins instead of raisins, merely because that's what I had on hand, I made this as written, and it was a HUGE hit. It's the perfect blend of flavors and textures!

This is a wonderful recipe for pot luck, can be made in advance and serves more than 12. I doubled the amount of dressing but cut the sugar in half, used red wine vinegar instead of cider because I cut back on the sugar. It was great.

My Husband and I both loved this recipe.  I tweeked it just a bit.  I only used 1/4 cup sugar and I added 1tsp worchestire sauce to the dressing.  It added a nice flavor to it.  And yes make sure you atleast double the dressing otherwise it is too dry.

Terrific! This has been a go to recipe ever since for pot lucks and holiday gatherings ever since I was luky enough to find it on this sight. I usually substitute dried cranberries for the raisins and I think it tastes even better! It such a beautiful and unique dish. One of my all time favorites!

This is a great recipe that everyone raved about.  I did not add the raisens, and used only half the amount of sugar.  It was definitely sweet enough.  I used frozen cheese tortellini and I will cook it less next time.  It kind of fell apart a little when I stirred the salad.

I'm giving this *** because I did not care for this, at all.  No one loved it, but some of the fam said it was "good."  The only thing I did different was omit the onion, but I do that all the time in our favorite broccoli salad, which is amazing and still taste great without the onion.  I'll definitely be going back to that recipe.

All the ingredients really compliment each other in this recipe. Will make many more times. Hubby would have like the broccoli cooked but not sure how that would taste. I think the crunch in this salad is what is needed.

Excellent recipe.  I followed recipe except reduced red onion to only 1/4 of an onion.  Next time I will reduce the raisens and sunflower seeds.  But the flavors are perfect together and the dressing is just right!

I felt that this was too oniony. I brought it to a potluck and it barely got touched. Also, don't freak out if the dressing seems too sweet when you first whip it up -- it'll mellow out as the savouriness of the bacon permeates through. This is why I feel that it's essential to let the salad sit overnight before serving!

Good tasting salad.  I didn't like all the sunflower seeds, I would cut that in half, as well as the raisins.  Found it needed a bit more dressing then the recipe called for. So I used a 1/4cup more mayo and a little more viniger.

I made this today for lunch...I love the concept, but not the combination.  The dressing was too sweet for my taste.  I would have gone with something a little more herb taste.  I'll make it again, but with an Italian dressing.

This one was just okay.  I thought that it turned out a little too sweet and it was missing the 'UMPH' I like.  If someone asked for me to make it again I would but this isn't my go-to recipe.

Made this for a picnic, rave reviews. Let's just say i never get rave reviews, because i'm always the one trying to bring something "healthy"! Was good for all and tasty, too. Will make again and again - this one goes in the recipe box.

I've made this before, so it's a good thing that I tripled it this time. I barely have enough leftovers to have for lunch today.  Great combo of sweet, salty, savory, cheesy, veggie goodness.

4 stars, because I modified it. And I think cutting the sugar in half counts as significant. But the flavors were good!  I halved it, since I didn't need to eat it for a whole week. And I accidentally bought ravioli instead of tortellini (just wasn't thinking).  I only used about 1/2 the sugar that the "halved" recipe called for.  But it was very good. Husband said the raisins really made the salad! I agree!

I cut the recipe in half, and didn't use bacon or raisins because I had neither on hand.  I cut the recipe in half but not the dressing, put it all together and put it in the fridge for about 45 minutes before dinner. Even with a short marinating time, the flavors blended well, but I can see how it could taste even better the longer it sits.  I didn't miss the bacon, and I am a bacon lover!  I'll make it again for sure because it was so simple to throw together.

This was just alright for us.  I thought the dressing was too sweet with not enough tang, even though I added more vinegar.

Very tasty, very easy recipe.  I made this for a potluck at work, and it was almost all gone.  I didn't use bacon because of some vegetarian co-workers, but otherwise, I followed the recipe pretty closely.  I used frozen tortellini and blanched the broccoli in the pot with the tortellini for about 30 seconds before pulling it off the stove.  Worked very well.  My only complaint would be that this was a little on the sweet side for my tastes.  I might add a touch more vinegar next time.

An incredible recipe. I recently had to make a cold dish for a large affair. I made this dish for 60 servings. At least 10 people sought me out to rave about this recipe. I did make a few changes. I omitted the raisins. I only used 2 red onions. The recipe called for 5. I made about 25% more dressing. It was the perfect amount. Anymore and the disk would have been a little soupy.

This was by far the most enjoyable recipe I have found. Fun and easy to make, beautiful to serve, delicious to eat. I doubled the dressing and added half the next day. Take salad out of fridge one hour prior to serving. I also used dried cherries and cashews as a personal preference and it rocked my holiday party goers big time. This is my new favorite dish to make!!!!!

So Easy, and so loved! Its a must at all our family gatherings since I discovered it. No matter what time of year it is this salad will fit in nicely. In the summer we make a big batch and serve it as a main dish!
 For our salad, we tend to leave out both the onions and bacon. The bacon just never tasted right. It, to us anyways, throws the taste off. Kids in our family our very anti onion. So, onions go into a small side dish. This encourages the kids to dive right it as well as the adults. Its a win win!
  I've tried making more dressing as others suggested, and mixing in just a small amount the night before. However, for me instead of sticking to the pasta, it all just sneaks down to the bottom and stays there. I end up mixing it all the next day to serve anyways. Might depend on the pasta I guess. We also only use Craisons! Oh these are the best! 
 Hope others will learn to love this salad as much as our Family. Thank you so much for getting my kids to eat Broccoli!

great recipe! i blanched the broccoli, skipped the bacon, used 1/2 an onion chopped very small (almost minced), and substituted golden raisins for regular. this added sweetness so you can cut back some on the sugar. overall a keeper!

I really like this recipe. I've made it many different ways, mostly just like the recipe (but no bacon). I use less red onion than called for and double the dressing.

I have also used dried cherries and added diced chicken and that was good too. I've used almonds instead of sunflower seeds. There are so many variations. I have been asked for the recipe many times.

This recipe was a big hit.  So far I made it once for events at work and twice for a parties.  Everyone raved and asked for the recipe.  I add one more strip of bacon than called for and I used Buttoni three cheese tortellini (20 oz.) found in the refrigerated section of a local supermarket. Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good with a few changes. I thought that two heads of broccoli was enough with the amount of pasta. Also, there was not enough dressing, in my opinion. I increased the mayonnaise to 1 1/2 cups, the cider vinegar to 3 tablespoons and left the amount of sugar the same. This allowed for an even coating. Other than that - I left it as written and it was a tasty side dish, for sure!

The greatest thing about this recipe is that you can make it your own.  I doubled it for a pool party, and it was a huge hit.  I also cut the amount of sugar and onion in half and added craisins instead of raisins.  Forgot the sesame seeds though.  
Like fine wine and women, this salad gets better with age!!!

I, like many, have made this several times. 
Here's what I can share - blanche the broccoli in the same pan you're going to cook the pasta in - UNCUT, and quench in the large bowl you'll be mixing in. This will save the water to cook the tortellini in, and makes it easier to blanche and remove the broccoli from the water. I place a towel in the drainer and set the broccoli in it and then start the tortellini. As the tort's are cooking, I move the broccoli heads to a towel to finish draining. Easier to cut this way too! After I quench, and as the broccoli heads are drying, I clean out the large bowl. (This is all while the bacon is cooking on low/medium heat and I am mixing the dressing ingredients.)
For the dressing, I take the mayo to 1C, and also use 1/2C Miracle Whip style dressing. Sugar is 1/2C. Apple cider vinegar is at 6 teaspoons - RAW apple cider vinegar. 
I mix all but 1/2C of dressing with everything but the tortellini (and the bacon has been cut into small pieces with kitchen shears). I then gently toss the frozen tri-color torts and place in the fridge, covered. 
Just before serving, mix in the rest of the dressing and have some copies of this recipe to hand out. 
It is that good.

Made this for Easter, hoping for leftovers but no luck.  Took the advise and doubled the dressing, half the sugar.  Turned out great.  Thanks.

Fantastic!! I made this for 50 people and we completely ran out! I'm not a fan of mayo, and you really didn't knw it was there. The only change I made was to toast the sunflower seeds and add half of the dressing right before serving. The BEST pasta salad Ive made. Excellent!!

Absolutely delicious! My dad is still raving about it. I definitely played with the recipe, though. 1/2 cup mayonnaise is not nearly enough, instead I used 1 1/4 cups. I used 1/2 cup raisons (though I will probably use more next time) and omitted the sunflower seeds for a 1/2 cup sliced almonds. I didn't use all of the onion, either. This is a must-make recipe!

I love this salad, and it stays fresh for a few days! I thought the combination of ingredients would be weird, but it's not. and, if you leave something out; you can tell it's missing- everything tastes great together.

I thought this was great!  I changed the sunflower seeds to cashews and used real bacon bits instead of frying the bacon - just makes it quicker and easier.

I made this salad for a potluck at work and everyone was asking for the recipe!  By far one of the best salads I've had!  One tip is to use Spinblend brand mayo it's nice and tangy so it makes a great dressing.

Fabulous!  I cut sugar in half and used approx. 3/4 c. mayo and approx. 1/4 cup cider vinegar and half the onion.  A must for a summer BBQ or a potluck!

This salad is excellent.  I blanched the raisins for 1 minute which softened them.  I also used frozen tortellini which came out great.I cut the sugar in half and it was perfect. I served this at a BBQ, and everyone loved it.

AWESOME, there is nothing better. I was so excited when I was passed this recipe from a coworker. Made it for my boyfriend, and now I have to have it on hand at all times.

I like to replace the sunflower seeds with Almonds, Pine nuts, Soy nuts, almost anything.

Also I HATE onions, so using little green onions works very well.

This was so tasty!  I doubled the dressing amount, but only used 1/2 c. sugar for the doubled amount.  I also cut back to 1/4 c. onion, sliced thinly.

I kept everything else the same.  This was better the 2nd day, after sitting in the refrigerator overnight.

I enjoyed this salad, for the most part.  The dressing was toooo sweeeet!.  I will be cutting to 1/3 c sugar and upping vinegar to 1T next time.  I was concerned it wouldn't be enough dressing, but it was.  Also, I used 1 c minced red onion - and it STILL overpowered the salad.  Maybe it was a strong onion, but I will be cutting this back as well.  I blanched the brocc as my kids love cooked but hate raw (this was a compromise!).  I also added some cashews - about 1/2 c cashews, and cut back the sunflower seeds to 1/2 c.  An excellent meal that will be in our summer rotation!

I've had this salad a couple of times and loved it. I like the idea of reducing the sugar and also using craisins, so I will try that next time I make it. Another idea is using miracle whip instead of mayo for the dressing.

This is always really popular when I make it for get-togethers. I blanch the broccoli and boil the raisins, which makes them plumper and juicier. I, too, reduce the sugar and I like sweet stuff, but it only needs to be sweet to taste. I have received numerous requests for the recipe and it is very easy to make. I always let it sit overnight before I serve it since I think most salads improve in flavor as they sit.

Delicious!  Blanched brocolli and onions last minute of pasta cooking.  Reduced sugar to 2 tbs., increased mayo to 3/4 c. and added pepper, garlic powder and seasoned salt.  Also had baby canned peas and sliced olives on hand...terrific salad with endless "pasta"bilities ;)  Thanks!

With all the positive reviews, how could I go wrong making this?  I blanched the onion and broccoli like other's suggested. I skipped the raisins and doubled the dressing.  I thought it was okay....my whole family disagreed. They didn't care for it at all. Must be something wrong with my family!  I was very disappointed.

I LOVE this salad and it's always a hit where ever I bring it.  Everyone always asks for the recipe but I keep it as a secret. :). I'm not sure why this recipe doesn't have over a 1000 5 star reviews.  The Ingredients might not sound great and  I'm not a big fan of raisins but everything together is delicious.  Thank you for sharing!!!  This recipe has been added to my recipe book to pass down to my kids!!!

This was delicious! My husband absolutely loved it. I doubled the dressing, and used about 2/3s the amount of sugar called for. I also doubled the bacon and blanched the brocolli as others have suggested. The flavors really complemented eachother. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this for a food day at work and it was gone so fast!  I had many people ask for the recipe.  I made some changes as suggested by others (decreased the sugar, used craisins)and it was delicious!

I made this yesterday for my grandparent's 55th wedding anniversary, everyone loved this pasta dish, I did use 1/2 cup of splenda instead of sugar and used green onions. I was asked for the recipe by several people.
I will definately make this pasta dish throughout the summer!!!!

This recipe was delicious.  I made it this Easter Sunday and the family loved it.  The only thing I would change is to not add a whole onion.  I added half the onion and I thought that was too much.  No one complained about it but the onion smell was so overpowering to me and I think next time I will only add half of a half chopped onion.

Great salad.  Everyone at the potluck loved it.  For my own personal taste, I used one cup of mayo, 1/2 cup of sugar and 1 tbls of vineger for the dressing.

This pasta salad was SO good, I used about half as much sugar,omitted the onions and added some grated carrot.  My three year old ate and ate - we also used macaroni instead of tortellini - I will make this recipe alot. Very Good!!

I thought this was excellent.  I put more bacon in, cashews and craisins plus the sunflower seeds.  I also added cheddar cheese.  I will make it again!

I've tried this salad before, however, it didn't have the tortellini.  I think it makes a big difference and really enjoy it.  My boyfriend ate almost the whole salad himself!!!

Wow!  This dish was a really big hit!  I followed it exactly, and although I had my reservations about the sunflower seeds and the strange sauce, everyone ate it up!  Three people asked for the recipe (which is really impressive because I can't cook!!)  It was a huge success.

I brought this dish to a baby shower and everybody loved it.  I read the other reviews beforehand and made the dressing with less sugar and it tasted great.  I also made it without bacon and it still tasted great.  Several people asked me for the recipe.

This salad was a real crowdpleaser at a potluck.  I am going to substitute Craisins for the called for raisins.  Thought it would be more colorful for the holidays.
