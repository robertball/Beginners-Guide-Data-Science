As usual, I slightly messed up the recipe by using a dish that was too small.  As a result, I used less philo dough than called for.  Due to sheer stupidity, I then proceeded to add more nuts, coconut and raisins than called for.  Despite that...it turned out yummy!  So long as you and yours enjoy nuts and raisins, you'll really like this dish.  I'm not a huge raisin fan, but I enjoy them in an Indian versian of bread pudding, so I worked with them--and they were really great.  

And it's such a fun and unusual dish to prepare! :) SUPER easy.  Seriously.  SUPER quick.  I am prone to all sorts of culinary disasters, yet it all worked out--I heated the milk mixture, added it, and cooked it while my guests were enjoying wine after dinner.  THAT quick.

Eh.  This was just OK. Considering the MANY wonderful desserts coming out of the Middle East, I should have known that this was too easy to give me the results I wanted.  I'll stick to the all day, time consuming recipes my grandmothers taught me.
The puff pastry doesn't absorb the milk at all, and even if you fill the dish with it, and then it gets crispy on top.  The nuts suck in moisture and taste odd after they bake.

I may be to blame for the pastiness and blah flavor of my attempt at Umm Ali. First of all I left it on the counter almost 30 minutes before bakingand then, because I wanted to keep it warm until we were ready for dessert, I left it in the oven for 20 extra minutes at 200. It was pasty and lacked the moistness of a good bread pudding-type of dessert. I'd like to try again with out the extended warming.

I have checked out many ‘Im Ali’ recipes but never liked them & I have to say this was one of the best – easy & light (I use low fat puff pastry & skimmed milk).  However, I prefer to sprinkle the nuts over the top so they remain “crunchy” & the dish looks better & more appetising.    Thank you for this easy & delicious recipe :)

I've never made bread pudding before, and this version was incredibly easy to make!  Before baking the puff pastry, I split it into 3 inch squares.  After baking, I split those squares in half or in quarters, and the varying sizes all worked well as the final product.  This is best eaten right after it's cooled.  I made the Umm Ali for Father's Day, and now every time my dad talks to me he demands that I make it again ASAP!  It was absolutely delicious, and everyone who tried it loved it.  I recommend serving this right after it cools from the oven.  It doesn't even need ice cream added, it's so delicious.  Also, I tried some leftovers a couple days later, and it wasn't nearly as good because the bread had absorbed all the milk.  Still had the flavor though.
Thanks so much for sharing!

For even better Om Ali add whipped cream (2 cups) spread on the top just before baking.  It is incredible!!

I just came back from a trip to Middle East and was dying to make this myself. The recipe was super easy and it tasted great but it turned out less moist than I remembered it to be - I think the dish I used was too big for the volume of milk in the recipe. Also next time I think I'll put it under the broiler just before eating since it doesn't take long at all. It's best eaten warm and fresh from the oven.

Needs a little less milk...not quite sure about that. May reduce it a bit or thicken the milk with some gelatin or cornstarch or use cream instead. As for the flavor, it's good. But the kind I've eaten before had rosewater in it and that does make a huge difference.  A small dash adds a bit of unique flavor.

I use only 1 of the rolled pastries that come in one box is enough. Otherwise you'll end up with a very dry and crusty Umm Ali, and that is NOT what it should be. Umm Ali is a moist dessert, unlike the traditional American style bread pudding.

I used walnuts instead of pine nuts. And 1/2 cup of sugar is more than enough!
