It was good but I made a lot of changes. I used cooked shrimp instead of raw. I used corn tortillas instead of flour. I added black beans and corn to the filling. I used enchilada sauce instead of salsa on top.

Very good recipe. I Sprinkled 1 cup of Cheddar cheese on top and used 1 pkg of the pre-cooked, small shrimp which made this very easy. This was very good and hope to make it again, soon! Thanks for the recipe! Made this a 2nd time and didn't care for it at all.

Way Yummy!  I fixed this for family that came into town and heard several times that these were the best enchiladas they'd ever eaten.  These enchiladas rock!!!  Thanks for the recipe.

Turned out really good! We used taco sauce along with the salsa, and added cheese on the top to melt before serving! It needs some thing else in the middle, like peppers or onions. But over all definatly a repeat dish!

Very good. I only made 2 modifications to the recipe: 1) used pre-cooked shrimp diced up in the food processor 2) topped with slices of cream cheese before baking, then broiled at the end (yum!). I thought because I was using pre-cooked shrimp I wouldn't have to bake as long, but in 15 minutes the middle of the enchiladas were barely warm. I put them back in and I think they were in the oven for a total of 25-30 minutes and they were done perfect.

boring and flavorless. i just wanted to throw something together and wanted it to be something new. so i found this and thought what the heck? although, i knew the olive oil in the same pan cooking the tortillas was a bad idea, so i didn't do that ... but i was mostly interested in the marinade, which in the end lended no flavor at all to the shrimp. i will stick with what i know. sorry.

I only marinated the shrimp for 30 minutes and they turned out really tasty. If you buy the shrimp that are already deveined, peeled and that already tails off, this recipe can be very quick to prepare! Fiance loved this recipe as well! Great for busy people who want something different for dinner.

I can walk in after working all day and throw this together in no time at all.  It is fabulous!  If you get in the habit of buying shrimp when it is on sale and keeping it in the freezer with tortillas, etc. you will readily have what you need to make this.  Open a can of refried beans and serve with corn and you have a meal that is not only different, but very pleasing.

My boyfriend told me this is the best meal I've made to date!  It truly was delicious.  As with most other reviewers, we added some shredded cheese on top of the enchiladas right before they came out of the oven.  I also made my own salsa, which seemed to be key to the tastiness of this recipe. 

This was also a very easy recipe to put together.  I hate a lot of complicated steps, but this was a breeze! =-)

Very good!  Quick and easy!  If the salsa is watery then the tortillas get a little soggy.

This was amazing! I literally tell you the flavors exploded in my mouth...amazing. HOWEVER I did make a few changes to my dish that more than likely enhanced the flavor over those who had issues with taste. 1.) while I sprinkled a little ground ginger in the marinade; I used fresh ginger as well( this really gave the dish another layer of complexity)and I added salt and pepper. I also popped a fe diff. fresh veggies in the marinade so they could be flavorful as well.2.)I used actual enchilada sauce instead of salsa. The dish needs to cook longer than 20mins to reach perfection.

It basically tasted like shrimp and tortilla. I used the exact recipe and everything just seemed bland. I was excited when I made the marinade, with the garlic and everything. I love me some garlic-tasting shrimp. I was just let down. Oh well, c'est la vie!

Made this for company who love Mexican. It was outstanding ! I did add more cheese on top of the enchiladas with the salsa ( few minutes before done) so cheese would not burn.

This recipe is wonderful.  I love enchiladas and this was so nice and light it doesn't sit in your stomach like a bunch of bricks.  Plus another great thing is that my husband loves this.

Maybe I did something wrong, but the tortillas turned out gummy.  I guess I was looking for more of an enchilada taste than what I got.  Instead of the large shrimp, we used the smaller shrimp.  It took a LONG time to cook!  By the time they were done, we just mixed it all together and put it over rice.  Maybe next time I'd try it with an enchilada sauce.

This dish is delicious.  However, I made some minor changes.  I used homemade tomato sauce instead of regular salsa, cooked shrimp ahead of time, used herb and garlic tortillas.  Added some cheese to top of tortillas.  Absolutely divine!  Thank you!

We loved these!  We did make a few changes though.  We the marinade we added some cayenne red pepper, chili powder, ground cumin, and season salt!  It added more flavor!  We also added the cheese on top!  It is delish though!

This was a big hit with my boyfriend and I.  I added garlic powder, brown sugar and a little honey to the marinade.  I also chopped a green onion and included that with the tortilla stuffing.  All in all an excellent dish!

This was good but took closer to 40 minutes for the shrimp to cook through.  Also I poured enchilada sauce over the top before cooking which gave it an authentic Mexican flavor.

This turned out very watery for me.  The flour tortillas were soggy/doughy.  If I were to try this again I would use corn tortillas and increase the baking time or use cooked shrimp.  Shrimp near the middle did not cook all the way.
