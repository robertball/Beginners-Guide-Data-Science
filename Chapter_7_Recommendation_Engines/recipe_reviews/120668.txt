I changed this recipe only because I am dieting, this is definately a keeper!! I used italian turkey sausage and Schwans cheese tortellini (low fat), and used celery in place of green pepper (because that's what I had on hand), also used Splenda instead of sugar. OMG! This was out of this world good (and for those of you on Weight Watchers - ONLY 2 POINTS per serving!!) My family had no idea it was low-fat & low cal, even my 8 year old asked for seconds. It does make a huge batch and wouldn't fit in my crock pot - that's my only complaint!! Will definately make again and again.

Good idea for a soup. I cut all the veggies the night before and put them into a gallon-size Ziploc bag with all the spices and minced garlic, then shook it up to coat everything, and left it in the fridge over night. The next morning, I just dumped everything into the crock pot very quickly and let it cook on low while at work all day. Next time I will leave out the stewed tomatoes though because they made the soup taste too much like a stew. Otherwise, this is a great idea! I made a huge batch for hubby and me and had enough to fill up 4 large tupperware containers! Two are in the freezer for a later dinner, and the other two we're taking to work for lunches (we can each get 2 lunches out of them!) Thanks!

My husband and I are huge soup fans and have tried numerous recipes.  Hubby gave this a 4.5 stars, as he is leaving room for a "perfect" soup, which has yet to be found.  I give it a 5, hands down one of the best soups I've ever tasted.  I did substitute 10 oz chopped frozen spinach for the zucchini, as we are not fans of zucchini, and it was great!  I like hearty soups, but hubby would prefer a bit more broth, next time I might consider adding some additional broth...  but then again, I don't think it needs it.

Trusting a fellow Minnesota cook, I was eager to try this soup.  Delicious!  I substituted Penzey's Italian Seasonings (2 tsp.) for the basil and oregano, but otherwise, I didn't change a thing.  I did end up cooking this in a large pot on the stove due to the volume it makes.  I served it for dinner last night with fresh baked bread, and it sure warmed us up.

I have made this soup three times and have gotten excellent reviews from everryone who tried.    The first time I made it for my family my daughter said it needed more broth.  I added an additional two cups that last two times I made it.  The additional broth was a good suggestion.  However if you want it "hearty" then follow the recipe exactly as written.  I didn't bother adding the cheese.

Hearty Pasta Tomato Soup Haiku: "Heaven in a bowl! Made a ton, I'm glad I halved. Sad, no leftovers!" Phew, good thing that I knocked the recipe in half, b/c it's unlikely that it would've all fit in my crockpot. I started it in the morning, on low, adding only an additional cup of broth, which I'm happy that I did, b/c otherwise, it would've been a bit stew-ish - came home from work to a mouth-watering aroma. I left it on low, tossing in the tortellini w/ about 45 min. to go, and it came out amazing.  I didn't feel guilty about the richness of the sausage or tortellini, b/c while there wasn't much of either in the soup, the taste was perfect, and balanced beautifully by all the wonderful veggies. Not the most attractive color soup, but my belly didn't care - tasted SHAZAM!

This soup is DELICIOUS!  A hearty main course soup served with garlic toast was all we needed for our bellies.  We used regular Italian sausage links instead of ground sausage.

Very tasty and I love that it has so many veggies!  I used turkey sausage.  I used 1 can tomato sauce and 1 1/2 can tomato paste because that's all I had.  This overflowed my crockpot so I had to take some of the liquid out!

I just love this soup, especially the fact its made in the slow cooker.  I used the Jimmy Dean sausage crumbles, so I did not have to waste time cooking sausage.  I used 8 cups of beef broth and for the tomatoes used 1 large can of crushed tomatoes, I small can of chopped italian tomatoes and the 15 ounce can of tomato sauce.  I did not use zucchini but used a mix of carrots, green pepper, mushrooms onions and celery.  Followed the directions as instructed, this really did produce a good hearty soup. I will certainly be making this recipe again.

This is a great soup!  It is even better the next day.  I used Boca soy Italian sausage for a low fat alternative.

Great recipe....we enjoyed it....used Italian chicken sausage instead of pork, and used low sodium fat free chicken broth instead of beef broth. Nice and hearty soup. Topped with grated pecorino romano cheese and thick salt and cracked pepper croutons. Also added some red hot pepper flakes to mine. Thanks!

Delicious!  The husband (who claims not to like soup) requests this.  I used fire roasted tomatoes for a little more flavor, not that it needs it!

I kept all the ingredients the same.  I decided I wanted it for dinner right away, rather than waiting to cook it tomorrow, so I cooked it on the stove.  Cooked everything except the zucchini and tortillini for about 20 minutes at a simmer, then added the zucchini and cooked another 10 minutes, then added the pasta and cooked another 2 minutes (according to pasta directions).  It was amazing, and both my two year old son and my husband liked it a lot (and he does not like zucchini or mushrooms but didn't seem to notice them over the amazing overall taste of the soup).

Delicious & Hearty, as advertised!  I substituted fresh chopped tomatoes (seasonal) & tomato soup (on hand) for the canned tomatoes & tomato sauce. Skipped mushrooms (by choice). Surprised the tortellini held up in slow cooker ('warm' setting), even firm microwaved the next day.  My 16YOA son kept saying I could leave the zucchini out next time, but cleaned up ALL the leftovers!!!

This soup was pretty awesome!  I cooked this soup on the stove top.  The changes I made were the following: 
 
1. I did not use onion (personal preference.)
2. I cut the sausage in slices before sautéing it in EVOO.
3. I added on can of hand held Creamy Tomato Soup (to thicken it up-and to add flavor)

Without the creamy tomato soup, the soup had a slight watery consistency.  I prefer it a little thicker.  Enjoy!

This was great! I ended up using 6 cans of beef broth and a can of tomato paste (forgot the tomato sauce). The only thing I would change would use 1.5 or 2 pounds of sausage. My 2 year old even loved this recipe!! Thanks for sharing.

5 stars!  this made such a huge batch i invited my sister and her kids over for dinner.  They all like it and they are picky.  I didn't make any major changes really.  I added celery because i had some to be used up and i doubled the pasta.  I was worried about the zucchini because we don't eat it, but it disappeared into nothing in the crockpot.(i chunked it into small pieces). I'm definately going to make this again when the menfolk are home.  I think they would enjoy it also.  Thanks alot for a yummy meal last night!

I really like this recipe and my husband did too.  I followed the comments from others and halved the recipe and in place of Zucchini I used 2 stalks of celery.  I also added the tortellini to the soup to cook.  No need to dirty up another pan.

This soup was fairly good.  I think it could be great with a few modifications.  The 2 lbs of tortellini seems to be wayyyy too much, I would maybe put in one lb at the most.  Also, if you're planning on having this for several meals and keeping in the the fridge, the noodles start to fall apart by day 2, I would suggest that you add pasta before you reheat.  I also added red pepper flakes and it gave a nice heat to it!

This recipe was a surprise hit with Mr. MVP. He loved it. I cut the recipe in half and used ground turkey (seasoned with garlic, basil and rosemary) rolled into small meatballs that I simply tossed into the broth after I browned them in a pan. We used organic pasta filled with ricotta cheese to cut down on the sodium and eliminate the preservatives. I used fresh tomatoes and homemade broth, but I followed the recipe exactly for the amounts. We'll be eating this again and again!

Fantastic tasting and easy to prepare with plenty of left overs. With the intention of finding a happy medium of others weekend chefs, no offense intended, I incorporated the following mods: add two extra cups of broth to allow for plenty of extra bread dipping, used four cheese ravioli for a extra mealy heartiness, and slow cooked on high for 4-5 hours.  Suggest being a heavy on the Parmesan when serving for a soothing winter comfort-food dining experience.  Next time around plan on using a bay leaf for a little more added seasoning and home made bread would be nice.

Everyone raved about this dish! It did, however, inspire me to buy a larger crock pot. I will definitely make this again.

Delicious!  We cooked it on low for 6 hours and used Hot Italian Sausage.  Definitely will be making this recipe again! Thank you Lydia!

Made this last night exactly as called for and it came out superb.  All 6 of us enjoyed it thoroughly.  Served fresh buttered italian bread on the side, and OMG, to die for!  I was skeptical about the sausage but all the flavors worked perfectly together. I will definitely be making this again!!!

LOVE IT! I left out the pepper, used a whole jar of sauce, and used mini ravioli. Wonderful taste and so very easy! Delish with crusty bread.

This is a delicious soup and the recipe is easily adaptable to fit the ingredients you have on hand.  I made a vegetarian version with a sausage substitute and vegetable broth, and it was excellent.  I will certainly be making this one again.

Yum!! I didn't add tortellini, but used 2 cans of great northern beans instead. It turned out like an italian chili. Absolutely delicious. When I make it again in the fall or winter, I'd use the beans and tortellini, for a very hearty stew/soup.  Definitely get a nice loaf of italian bread to soak up the wonderful broth!!

I made this yesterday - the only thing I omitted was the peppers because I can't eat them. It was really good. I used sweet sausage and that along with the sugar made it a sweet soup - a little unexpected on the first bite, but not unwelcome. There is no added salt in the recipe. I didn't think it needed any; my husband added a little at the table to his own taste.

The only thing I will do differently next time I make this soup is to saute the onions in the pan after I do the sausage until they are soft. They were still crunchy after the soup had cooked completely, and I would prefer them softer.

Not bad but not as great as I expected it to be. As recommended by other reviewers I doubled the broth but I also added probably double the tortellini as well.  My kids were outraged that I expected them to actually it something with that many veggies but I really didn't expect a glowing review out of them anyway.  Hubby said it was ok, too. I probably won't end up making it again because there are so many other recipes to try on this website.

All in all, a great recipe.  Even the kids liked it.  I made this on the stove because my crockpot wasn't big enough.  I used turkey Italian sausage.  If you're expecting traditional tomato soup, you will be surprised!  This thick and hearty soup is tasty and filling.  With the turkey sausage, it was low in Weight Watchers points, too.  I will definitely make this one again.  I have a bigger slow cooker now, so I'll try using it the next time around.

Outstanding!  I'd suggest a couple changes, but nothing huge.  First I'd suggest using sausage links cut up.  The ground sausage got a bit dried out for my taste.  And I'd saute the onions w/ the sausage.  I didn't have any tomato sauce so I used leftover pasta sauce (vodka sauce) and it was FANTASTIC.  Also, I used fresh pasta, which allowed me to toss it straight into the crockpot 30 minutes before serviing time.  saved doing more dishes.  This is a great recipe, I'll be making MANY times.

This soup was delicious. I didn't have zucchini and I don't like mushroom so instead I added a stalk of diced celery and a few handfuls of fresh baby spinach at the end. I followed the rest of the recipe as written and it is delicious! You won't be disappointed!

This is one of my favorite soups and I've tired quite a few.  I omit the mushrooms b/c I don't like them but otherwise, I follow the recipe exactly.  It's very hearty and makes a lot.  I have a huge crock pot and it fills it up to the top.  So, lots of leftovers.  Easily adaptable for different vegetables.  Great with some crusty bread.  Everyone who has tried it loves it.  I think I'll try turkey sausage next time.  And I use Italian sausage without the casings b/c I like it that way for the soup.

Fantastic! Very flavorful. My crock pot is just an average size, so I half the recipe. I also add the peppers during the last hour or so to avoid them getting bitter. Sometimes I substitute diced tomatoes for the stewed as well.

We really liked this recipe - it's really hearty and perfect for a cold, rainy day. We didn't want to wait 3-4 hours for the slow cooker, so we put the liquid ingredients in a large soup pot and got it boiling on the stove while we sauteed sliced Italian sausage with the onions and other veggies in a saute pan. Once the sausage and veggies were cooked, we tossed them into the soup pot along with the tortellini and let it boil for a few minutes. Really easy and good! We'd make this one again.
