I really like micheladas, they are so refreshing on hot Texas days! My friend likes Clamato in hers, however I am not a fan of its fishy taste. You can substitute with Spicy V8 juice or Bloody Mary mix or leave it out completely. If Maggi sauce is available where you live, try adding a dash or two to your drink. Cheers!

These were by far the most tasty micheladas I've 
EVER had. I'm not a great fan of a lot of tomato in my drinks, and this one has the right combination of orange, lime, tomato, and spice. Loved it!

This is one of my favorite drinks!! I keep a pitcher of the mixer in the fridge! If you like Bloody Marys, you will love this!

I tried to make this for 1 beer & I used 1 1/2 tbsp of the Orange juice concentrate. I thought it was Too sweet & took away from the other flavors.  whenever I have a party large enough to serve 24 beers, I'll review again.
