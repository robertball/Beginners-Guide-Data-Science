WE HAVE MADE THIS RECIPE SINCE THE EARLY 80'S.  IT IS ALWAYS A BIG HIT.  FOR A DIFFERENT TASTE YOU CAN ADD COCONUT AND/OR CHOPPED PECANS TO THE "CRUST" MIXTURE.  THIS CAKE IS MUCH BETTER IF ALLOWED TO SIT FOR 24 HOURS BEFORE CUTTING.  THE FLAVOR SEEMS TO INTENSIFY OVER TIME. DON'T EXPECT ANY LEFTOVERS!

Delicious!   Helpful tip:  others complained about the difficulty of getting the dough into the pan - just mix it all in the pan and it spreads easily.

Oh Yeah! I know I have died and gone to heaven with this Cake. Absolutely the best cake and I know that my co-workers will simply rave about this cake. You simply cannot appreciate how good this cake is if you skimp on the recipe. Yes, it is very rich but oooooooooohhhhh sssssoooooooo good! At 350 Degrees Baked for 35 minutes. The crust around the edges is just right. I just love this recipe and plan on making this cake again and again. This is absolutely a KEEPER! I  will certainly be adding a photo of this masterpiece of a RECIPE!

The search has stopped here. This is the best butter cake. I made it the first time according to the original recipe and found the base too dry and the cheese topping too sweet. The second time, I increased the butter to 1 cup and reduced the sugar by half...the result was an awesomely some, buttery cake with a moist and delicious cheese topping...lovely! This one is a keeper and dh even asked me to make another to give to the neighbours! I made it for mom and she has not stopped raving since...everyone who has tried it asked for the recipe. With these 2 alterations, this one is a winner! Thanks Barbara!

Beware if you don't like really sweet things!  I thought it was an awful lot of sugar when I was making them, and I was right.
I brought them to work, and after eating them, we re-named them "sugar bars".
If I make them again, I will use a lemon cake mix to help cut the sweetness and use half the
amount of sugar.

We call it ooey gooey butter cake and we love it.  I have found that the cake bottom can be too dry.  What I do is after the cream cheese mixture is poured into the pan I take my butter knife and make small holes in the crust so that the topping can sink into it. This makes a huge difference.  I do not think you will be disappointed if you do this.

This is by far the best version!  ANd, it is better to use golden yellow cake mix than a butter yellow cake mix!!!!

Excellent! It brought back memories of growing up in St. Louis and having Gooey Butter cake on weekend mornings. I served it at a gathering for some of my east coast friends who had never heard of it, and I think they are now hooked!
I did cut back on the powedered sugar since the recipe is already quite sweet.

Oh. My. Goodness. This was UNBELIEVABLE. I did change a couple of things, do them and you will not have a dry cake: 1. I used organic vanilla cake mix. I am not typically a box cake baker, so I am not sure if yellow cake mix is close to the same thing, but I think using vanilla cake mix gave it an amazing flavor.  2. Use only 2 cups of confectioner's sugar. There is absolutely NO need for 4 cups - not for consistency, and definitely not for sweetness. 2 cups cuts those horrid calories in half and is plenty sweet. Trust me. 3. Bake for only 30-35 minutes, NOT 40+! I pulled mine out and I could tell it was still soft in the center, but a toothpick inserted in the middle came out clean so I took the chance. Best move ever.  The middle was soft and moist and buttery and heavenly! Everyone was Mmmm-ing and Ohhh-ing as they ate it. A few said they'd love it with chocolate or caramel drizzled lightly on top (or both!).  I'm making this again soon for a dear friend and her hubby and I can't wait to Mmmm over it again!

I have looked for this recipe for ages!  WONDERFUL!  My husband took one taste and almost died of happiness!  It's like a cross between cheesecake and moist cake.  If you want to cut the sweet a bit, do what I do - five minutes before it's done, gently place some pecan halves on top of the cake and finish baking.  The pecans get toasty and crunchy, and it's a nice addition.  If you want it super-sweet, then dust with additional powdered sugar.  THANKS FOR THE RECIPE!

It was very Gooey, But perfect.  I did like Cookies suggested and turned the oven down to 325 since i was using a non stick pan and it is wonderful.

I have tried other recipes for this same "cake" on this website, and this is by FAR the best one!  Make sure to put them in the fridge before you eat them . . . they're even better cold!

This is as close to real gooey butter cake as you're going to get.

I would, however, suggest a few changes.
1. Take out the vanilla extract in the cake mixture, but not the cream cheese mixture.
2. Reduce baking time to 35 minutes.
3. Definitely spray your pan with cooking spray before patting the cake mixture in.

I found the baking time, esp. to be way too long. the middle was ok, but the bottoms and edges were burnt. I should've checked it at 35, but I let it go until 40 minutes, per this recipe. And my oven doesn't run hot.

This was an EXCELLENT recipe! It's very sweet and rich, though (almost makes your tummy hurt!). I was happy that it didn't taste overly cheesecake-ish. Yum!

Oh so delicious...a St. Louis classic.  I only give it 4 stars because it could stand to cut back on the sugar a bit...may try 3 cups next time.  Even so, this is the kind of food that will make me die fat and happy.  For more amazing St. Louis cuisine, try making some toasted ravioli.

I LOVE THIS! I couldn't find my family recipe for this so I tried this recipe. It's still very good but when I finally found my recipe I realized it only calls for 3 cups of confectioners’ sugar. I also like it better with 1 (20 ounce) can drained crushed pineapple mixed into the cream cheese and sugar mixture. Delicious!

OMG, I'm in love! This is absolutely decadant. I followed the recipe exactly. I might try cutting back a little on the powdered sugar next time, just for a trial. This is so delicious. How the heck can you go wrong with cream cheese and butter? Thanks for the recipe. Kaye

4 cups of powdered sugar?  I couldn't make myself do it, so only added 2 1/2.  There seemed to be something missing in the topping as I remember from Paula Deen the 1/2 cup of butter to the cream cheese mixture.   Well thats why they call it a butter cake you would think so I added it. Very good with those changes, and plenty sweet.

This is just sin in a dish. It's so good and so comforting. It's definite a family favorite. My younger stepson even asked me to make this for his birthday - he would rather have it than a traditional cake.

This recipe varies only slightly from my grandmother's. I grew up in St. Louis, also, and this is by far my favorite cake. My uncle is a gourmet chef, and his popular variation is to sprinkle sweetened coconut and/or chopped pecans on top. No matter how you embellish, gooey butter cake is spectacular!

Everyone loved this!  I did make a little bit of a change though- I added about 16 oz of pumpkin (not pumpkin pie filling), a tsp of cinnamon, and a tsp of nutmeg in with the cream cheese...was delicious!

I made this cake to take to a family BBQ and it was gobbled up in a flash. Everyone asked me to make it again next time we get together. I made one change, and that was to add a teaspoon of almond extract to the crust. I baked it in a glass pan and found that the bottom browned a bit more than I would like, not burnt, but definitely quite well-browned, so next time I make this I think I'll use a metal pan or lower the temp to 325 for glass, and that should be enough to keep the bottom from over-browning. This cake was extraordinarily easy to make, simple ingredients available at any grocery. I'll make this one often! So easy and sooooooo good!

I made this cake for my step kids, a 5yr and 11yr old.  They didn't like it to much. They said it was to sweet, but the thing is I only used 2 cups of confectioners' sugar. Their dad said it was too rich. Other than the amount of sugar I also used 1 egg in the cake batter and 1 egg in the cream cheese mixture. Personally I like this recipe, however it is really too sweet, but I will make it again with the following changes: 1.5 cups confectioner's sugar and 2tbsp lemon juice in the cream cheese mixture. I may even consider halving the recipe, cutting the pieces into very small pieces so I won't have alot leftover on my hands.

The cake layer is very thick and a bit dry. But the flavors are good. I might double the topping next time. *Update* After this sat for 36 hours the cake layer became moist and was super delicious so I bumped the recipe up to 5 stars!

I have made the base gooey butter cake on several occasions all with rave reviews! Last night I made it for a Serbian Christmas Party and I folded in 1 cup of chocolate toffee bits to the cream cheese mixture. WOW! It was THE hit of the party and I was asked to take a photo with two guests who LOVED it. I realized as I was sharing the recipe via email to the folks who had requested it, that I had added only half of the butter and it still turned out amazing! Yes, it is sweet, yes it is gooey and YES it is delicious!

This is one of my very favorite cakes!  I got this recipe in the 80's from a family friend.  This never goes to waste.  On a recent episode of Paula Deen, she made it and added some chocolate toffee bits to the cream cheese mix before baking...looked yummy!  I will give that a try next time.

I would have given this 5 stars, but I did need to tweak the recipe a bit.  The bottom cake crust is amazing, but I felt the top needed more flavor as it was too sweet.  I used a yellow butter cake mix and lowfat cream cheese.  I added 2 tsp. of imitation butter flavor and an extra two teaspoons of vanilla to the top layer while mixing it.  It came outlooking exactly like the photo and cut very nicely after cooling.  I brought it to a Christmas gathering and it was the biggest hit (which was amazing considering there were about 15 types of homemade cookies, candies and bars). It is gooey and really sensational.  I will definitely make it again and again!!

This recipe is great for the perfect Chess Cake/Gooey Cake; however, PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHAT GOOEY CAKE is before making this recipe in that not everyone is going to like Gooey Cake.  It's basically not so much gooey as it is like eating pure sugar - your kids will be jumping off the walls - best served for grown-ups with a strong cup of black coffee!

This was easy and yummy...also addicting.  My husband isnt keen on sweets, but he loved this.  I took the advice of others and cut back on the sugar in the cream cheese mixture. Will be making again for sure!

I baked it in my nonstick pan at 325. I wasn't sure how to tell if it was ready, so I baked it for about 55 minutes. It is very sweet, and normally I don't drink milk, but I needed a glass with this cake. Really good, though!!

OK, this is the best cake ever. I'm not sure if I can ever eat another cake. I've always wanted this flavor/texture combo, but never knew it existed until perusing the site. I love cream cheese, sugar, and butter...always loved cheese danishes and such. If you're taste buds are like mine, you have to make this cake. My modifications included white cake mix b/c I didn't have yellow, 3.5 cups of the sugar, a splash more of vanilla. I baked at 350 for 35 minutes. The flavor isn't as good as the texture, and contrary to some of the reviews, I don't like it as much cold. I definitely see why you need to use butter yellow cake; the white cake flavor is a bit strong in mine. Next time I'll do that, or add more butter and less non-yellow/butter cake mix. I may also add some cinnamon or nutmeg to the topping. I meant to add a splash of lemon juice to the topping, for a little balance, but I forgot---definitely a to-do for next time. I can't wait to bake this for Thanksgiving!

This was a decent recipe, though even after reducing the sugar by half (to 2 cups), I still find it too sweet.  Next time I'd use 1 cup of sugar or less.

This is definitely St. Louis Gooey Butter Cake.  I reduced the powdered sugar by half, and will double the butter next time.  I sprinkled the top liberally with powdered sugar, but it tends to disappear into the cake after a few hours.  If you are taking this to an event, just check it before you leave and add more powdered sugar if needed.

This is the BEST recipe for my favorite dessert. Warning: do not overcook. My oven runs hotter than some. I remove this when its just starting to lightly brown on top. Otherwise it tends to dry out and lose that awesome gooeyness.

This is the perfect recipe for the St. Louis classic! I used this recipe my first time making Gooey Butter Cake and it was exactly what I hoped it would be. Very easy and the cake lasts longer than most cakes (without spoiling/going stale).

My family loves this one - just the sight of the ingredients on the counter and they go crazy.  My only mistake this time was taking it to a bake sale and not leaving a piece for my husband.  Yikes.  I use all 4 cups of sugar, bake for just 35 minutes, use vanilla only with the cream cheese part.  It's extra yummy if you let it rest 24 hours before serving.

Very good after you take the crunchy top off of it.I have lived in the St. Louis area my whole life and has NEVER seen a gooey butter cake look like this (and it is not traditional at all)  It made a toasted marshmallow look crust on the top and almost impossible to pull the cake away from the pan.  Next time I will add a small amount of PAM and like the others had said bake at 325 or 350 for 35 minutes.

This is it!  I grew up in Philadelphia and butter cake was a favorite in my house.  I moved to Atlanta 3 years ago and I couldn't find it anywhere.  I tried this recipe yesterday for a bunch of relatives that have also moved from Philly and they agreed that it was just like home.  So if you've been searching for a gooey butter cake recipe this is great.

These were so good. Knew they would be because I have made the cookie version before. Even better 2nd day. Trick to get dough spread out in a 9x13 pan. Put wax paper over top of sticky dough and press outward with your hands. Doesn't stick to the paper so it's easy to get a nice even spread in the pan. Otherwise the dough will stick to the spoon and/or your hands.

I had seen some reviews of this cake before, but either didn't have all the different ingredients, or wasn't in the mood to bake.  Today I baked. This is a really sweet cake, but it's really delicious! I made it just as it is in the recipe above and I will keep this one.  I think it would be really good with some strawberries, peaches, or blueberries on the side.  I'm impressed! Thanks for the recipe!

I used a strawberry flavored cake and put a small portion of the cake batter into the cream cheese part of the cake to make it slightly pink.  And like several others didn't use the full four cups of powdered sugar. It really turned out good. Next time I'm going to try a dark chocolate cake and put mini chocolate chips in the cream cheese portion.

Had a great flavor but was way too sticky and sweet.  Would have liked it to have a little more cake and less goo.  Ended up throwing 3/4 of it away.

I liked this recipe more than I thought I was going to, and I"m glad I decided to make it!  I used a golden butter cake mix because that is what I had in the pantry. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  It was gooey, very sweet, very decadent. My husband said he liked this even better than cream cheese brownies which surpirsed me!  Very good!

We loved it! I only used 3 cups of the sugar and it came out perfect for our tastes, (trying to watch the sugar intake a bit). Still sweet but not overly so. Thx!

I made this cake today and it is super good. I did use only 2 cups confectioners' sugar and that was enough. I made top a bit crispy and also looks great.

I was in a hurry and grabbed this recipe because it was the first on the search list.  I wish I had taken my time and looked harder.  This was horrible.  There's a key ingredient missing in the listing.  The cream cheese filling layer is also supposed to have a 1/2 cup of melted butter mixed into it.  When I finally found the paula deen recipe I was looking for, I compared them side by side and saw that this was the problem.    However, if you CAN get a gooey butter cake recipe right, sprinkle the top with chocolate chips prior to baking and it REALLY adds something to it!

I made two of these for my friend's birthday - one with chocolate cake mix and one with yellow.  This is NOT the same as the Gooey Butter Cake I used to get at the bakery so I will try the other on this site another time (was in a hurry).  Must say that I've had this recipe for years, although mine is just a tad bit different, using a jelly roll pan so you don't have to make two for a large party.
That being said, people liked it, but I think the yellow cake mix had kind of a strange taste - not just after taste - but during taste.  The chocolate was better with a little addition of mini chocolate chips.  Next time I'll try the Pumpkin variety by Paula Dean.

A BIG hit! I made one with lemon cake mix and one with chocolate cake mix. They LOVED the one with lemon and the chocolate one was great too! UPDATE: I also made this with a spice cake mix- the best so far, I'm not a big fan of cinnamon an pie spices, but this was YUM!

As written, it's extremely sweet.  Real bakery butter cake is sweet, but not in the same way.  This is nothing like bakery butter cake. Fresh out of the oven, it's ok, but it has to be refrigerated because of the cream cheese.  It gets hard and is inedible once it's in the fridge.

To help spread the cake layer, use the wrapper from the butter.  The buttery side won't stick and you can pat the batter down easier

I don't use all the powdered sugar b/c I think in general we consume too much sugar. I cut it all the way down to 2 3/4 or 3 cups. Also, I put 1/2 teas. of almond flavoring in the cake and the filling w/ 1/2 teas. vanilla in each. It truly is a fab Oooey Gooey Butter Cake.

Made this for the first time and it was a hit with my family.  Think I'll either cut back to one egg in the cake mix crust, decrease the temperature or baking time since the crust came out pretty dry.  Also decreased the powdered sugar to 2 - 2 1/2 cups.  Might try to experiment with different flavors in the batter now that I've tried it once.

We call this "Neiman Marcus Bars" at our house...but whatever you call it it is absolutely to DIE for!! I use duncan hines butter golden cake mix and it's buttery and smooth.  Wonderfully delicious and the hit of every holiday gathering. It's simple to prepare and is usually gone before any other desserts are gone from the sweets table! My mother-in-law says it's not christmas without this dessert. 5 stars aren't enough for this one! Be prepared to share the recipe if you show up with this dessert.

These were more like bars than cake - good but really sweet.  I love sweet desserts but this had a really strong powdered sugar aftertaste.  I think there is a version floating around that adds the juice of a lemon, I think that would cut down on the sweetness and add a new flavor dimension with the lemon.  I'm still rating this 4 stars since it went over well at a recent gathering.  thanks!

I've tried a few variations of this cake, this recipe is closest to what I've found to be my favorite, with a couple changes.
1) I add one cup toffee chips to the cream cheese mixture (try it you'll be happy you did!)

2) Altitudes vary but in the midwest, the PERFECT baking time in the midwest at 350 I found to be 33 minutes. I've tried 30 (goo runs all over the place) and 35 (cornbread like).

Everyone I serve this too.. "Best cake I've ever had"

One of my husbands favorite cakes (mine too). Only thing I changed was using almond extract in the crust instead of vanilla. Thank you for sharing this incredibly delicious recipe.

This is another one of those desserts that's hard for me to rate. I made it for a group, and everyone but me and my husband RAVED about it (using 3 cups powdered sugar, not 4, but if you like sweet desserts do it as written, it's not as much as it sounds like because it equals out to 2 cups white sugar). I thought it was too sweet / just ok at best, my husband thought it was "pretty good" and the other 4 people RAVED. They are people who are a lot more fond of boxed mixes than I and my husband, so if you're not already too spoiled to like boxed mixes (like me, lol), then I think you'll really like this a lot. Thank you for sharing your recipe, I may try this again with scratch cake sometime, just to see if I love it as much as I love the idea of it! (P.S. I tried the tip of just mixing it in the pan and I hate that tip. I would never do that again. Just my take on it, but it was a stickier gobbledygook that was harder to pat down from from mixing it in the pan because it was so hard to get ALL the moisture mixed in.)

Gooey butter cake is a wonderful, decadent thing.  I used this recipe to introduce this awesome St. Louis tradition to my friends in my now-home of California.  It was an absolute hit, though most could not believe St. Louisans actually eat this for breakfast - not dessert.  I did two slight alterations.  First, I cut the sugar to three and a half cups.  And, when I cut it into small slices, I added a small slice of strawberry and kiwi on top - added California flair to a Midwestern delight.  It was simply wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe!

I really like sweet but this is by far too sweet.  I think if I make this again I will add another package of cream cheese and cut the sugar in half.

Thanks for sharing this recipe, I tried it as written and I just don't think the resulting cake is for me or my family. I know others have said this, but seriously if you don't think you will like something that calls for 4 cups of sugar, then just pass on by this one! It was intense, and quickly disposed of.

Delicious and easy to make!  I used a Lemon cake mix instead, used fat free cream cheese, and halved the powdered sugar. This reminded me of the Lemon Cooler Girl Scout cookies from a few years ago.  Will make again!!!

This is probably my favorite dessert ever, and I'm a chocolate lover.  I switched from my mother in-law's recipe to this one, just something even better about it.  However, I've only had this with cinnamon sprinkled over the entire cake before baking.  I can't imagine having it any other way, so others might like to try that!

I wish I could give these a higher rating then 5!  They are fantastic!  I just made 6 dozen of these for a potluck and they were the FIRST to go.  I did have to bake them a bit longer then what the recipe called for but that's no big deal.  I prefer to keep them in the fridge.  I think they taste better cold.

This was good but I found the baking time to be a bit long.  Next time I will only bake 35-38 min.  The "goo" ws a bit over cooked.

I lost my original recipe years ago.  But for a twist use lemon cake mix and lemon extract in place of the vanilla extract.  Also these really need to be eaten after they cool.  The flavor is much more intense.  Enjoy

I made this at a request from a coworker and took it in to work.  I found it too sweet for my taste, but other's seemed to enjoy it.  If you have a serious sweet tooth, it's delicious. It was a bit much for me!

So good and so simple.  This is my second time baking this dessert.  My daughter said that this is her new favorite cake! I served it with a generous scoop of Dulce Du Leche Ice Cream, it goes perfectly together.  My only revisions were that I added a teaspoon of salt (to cut the sweetness) and reduced the sugar to 2 cups instead of 4 cups.  The first time I made it, I followed the recipe to the letter, but I decided that it was just too sweet to be enjoyable.  It works just fine with 2 cups of sugar.  This is a wonderful cake recipe.  Thanks!

Wow, this a sweet one!  This is the first time I've ever had Gooey Butter Cake so I'm wondering why mine looks a little different than other pics that are posted?  It seems people sprinkle extra sugar on theirs?  I thought it was pretty without.

This recipe was pretty good.  A little much yellow cake for me though.. but it was still good.  I'm from St Louis, and the gooey butter cakes you buy in the store have a lot less yellow cake in them.  Gooey butter cake is usually a little bit under cooked, which makes it gooey, but even if you over cook it a little it's still good.  But don't under cook it too much or you are just eating batter.  I've seen other recipes where you put some of the yellow cake mix into the gooey part, so I might try that next time, but this recipe is pretty good.  My Dad kept saying "it's addictive", and I do agree.

This cake is great. The first two times I made it i was using margine and it made my cake come out very cakey and not very gooey still great but more like cake. This last time I used real butter and it came out perfect plus I only used 2 cups of sugar. tryingto watch my weight. LOL! This recipe is worth keeping.

I used three cups of confectioners sugar in the mix which made this very sweet.  Next time I will only add two cups.  I also added about a 1/2 cup of sour cream to the "crust" due to other complaining about the crust being too dry.  I still think it was a little dry even with the sour cream.  Next time I may add a little water just to make it more moist.  Overall, this is a good recipe, not great.

I am making this for the second time in two weeks. Incredible, my family ate it in 2 days. The only thing I did differently was take the advice of other reviewers and cut the powdered sugar to 2 cups. It's a keeper!

I thought it was pretty good.  I cut out a cup of sugar as well and still thought it was too sweet, I was hoping the top would taste more like cream cheese.  But it is still pretty good.

This recipe was so easy to prepare and delicious! It was an overwhelming hit with my coworkers and every last piece disappeared quickly.  My only additive was a sprinkling of confectioner's sugar over the top after the cake cooled.

It's good...but a little too sweet for my taste.  I even cut it down by a cup.  I may try again and cut the sugar in half.  To think I have a sweet tooth and this was a bit too much on the sweet side.

Legend says that the original "Gooey Butter Cake" recipe originated from my home state of Missouri. Having said that, I have obviously tried various versions of this cake both store bought and homemade. This cake however is sweeter than any I have tasted! Easy to make! You will enjoy it!

I had never made a cake like this before and wasn't sure what to expect. It was just SO rich it was almost too much.  I may as well just slice it up and stick it to my hips since that's where it's going to stay anyhow!   Too much guilt to make again since I ate most of it.  Thanks for the indulgence.

Not as good as the best St. Louis butter cakes I have had, but the best non-professional representation I’ve ever tried. Definitely is Butter CAKE and not Butter BARS. Made this for a group and it did not last long at all.

I grew up in St . Louis. I remembered the topping being a little thicker...and not quite as sweet. I have adjusted the amount of powdered sugar...added butter and nothing quite compared to the bakeries!!!! Finally.....I decided that the amount of powdered sugar was on point! Reducing it just didn't give it the same taste. It was the texture of the topping!!!! When using a whole cake mix for the base it seemed too much. I used half of the cake mixture for the base and mixed the other half with the topping to thicken it!!! TRY THIS IF YOU WANT A TRUE ST LOUIS  OOEY GOOEY BUTTER CAKE!

Problem that now(2019) cake mixes are only 15.25 oz not 18+ oz as states in this recipe. How does this really effect the “crust” layer ?? Should I reduce the butter & egg to compensate??

I haven’t logged into this website for years but had to because I made this. It’s inedible. I threw it out. The powdered sugar taste is so overwhelming it’s like eating a spoonful of sweetened cornstarch. It’s extremely eggy. I don’t think it needs 4 eggs. The cake stunk of baked egg when I opened the oven and tasted like powdered sugar baked flan or something between two eggs in the topping and two in the cake. Taste, smell, sight, and texture-wise it is nothing like the previous times I’ve had this cake. I have very little energy and bake maybe once a year so I’m pissed I have to throw this out. I wouldn’t share this with anyone. I can’t believe so many people like this recipe. I followed the directions exactly so I have no feedback for what would improve this other than maybe use only one egg in the cream cheese and used like half of the sugar. Ugh.

I used pineapple cake mix and for the topping I mixed one can drained crushed pineapple and a cup of sweetened coconut in to the cream cheese mixture.  Delicious!  I have had people ask me to make this cake for them!

I have made this recipe for 40 years, but it no longer turns out right because cake mixes at about 15 ounces now.  Any idea where I can find an 18.25 oz cake mix?    I didn't want to give it a star rating but it wouldn't let me post without it.  Thanks for any advice.  I'll change the rating if you can help me.

This did not turn out well for me. Only changes were I cut back on sugar and only cooked for 35 minutes. The gooey layer was absorbed into the cake and the cake was overdone and dry. Tasted like dry yellow cake. I think the problem was the 2nd egg in the cake and the cooking time. Way too long.

Even as a beginner I was able to make this with marvelous results! The cake is rich and flavorful! 

One tip - if you are a stoneware user - this sometimes doesn't firm up in my stone pan, so I prefer to make it in aluminim pans.

This is incredible! I loved every bite of it. I fell in love and am floating on cloud 9! ok in all seriousness,  I didn't put 4 cups of sugar, I put 2 and it was ample sweet. I did however use a whole cup of butter in the crust to make sure that it was moist, and I only cooked it for 35 minutes. it was perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made this cake/bar recipe with slight change as per reviews. Changed sugar to 2.5 cups in the cheesecake part of recipe. Added to this part; grated rind of 1 lemon & the juice of the lemon. Baked it less time than required & will try it 5 min less the next time. By adding lemon juice it cut down the sweetness. All were gone in less than an hour by my coffee gang.

I actually found this recipe years ago on the back of a cake mix box. My family loves it! Here's the twist we started adding. Fresh blueberries or raspberries or any berry of your choice. Some have said this cake is too sweet, okay, everyone has different taste but the fresh berries really help cut that. Especially the blueberries or raspberries. My grown children fight over this cake. They always have. Now try the berries. They can't fight and chew at the same time!

This is perfect and a five-star recipe with NO changes necessary to the ingredients.  Oven time may need to be reduced slightly.  We will make this again and again!  Perfect dessert for the holidays.

After reading many of the reviews on this and given that I Love Love Love the gooey butter cookies, I had high expectations and was kind of disappointed! I made a couple of changes that other reviewers had suggested. I took the sugar down to just a little over 2 cups and in the cake mix part I did 1/2 tsp almond extract. Just my personal taste that was way too much for me. I don't like how strong I can taste it. And I don't like the consistency of the cream cheese mix part. But it's ok, my daughter ate it up quick!

I varied the recipe three ways: first, I spread a generous tablespoon of coconut oil on top of the cake layer; next, I sprinkled about 3/4 cup semi-sweet mini chocolate chips onto the cake layer (before I poured the gooey); and finally, for the gooey, I reduced the powdered sugar by a half cup. I also added about 10 minutes of bake time (till the top was slightly browned to my liking). I also let the pan cool completely, refrigerated it overnight, and then served it at room temp the next day. I brought it to an event, and it was literally gone in 5 minutes. Note that this recipe calls for 1 more egg in the gooey than I'm used to, and I thought it might make it too cakey, but the texture was fine. It had about an inch and a half of thickness. Next time I will add pic.

I was craving our Mexico vacation and wanted to make a gooey butter pina colada cake.  I used pineapple cake instead of yellow, and I added shredded coconut to the cake crust mix, and sprinkled some atop the crust before adding the top cream cheese layer.  This was so good that our neighbors tried it and made it the next day to take to work, then it spread like wildfire!

Used a bit less powdered sugar as advised by other reviewers, but I think it would be just as good with the full amount. This is an amazing dessert and I'll definitely make it again.

We used this recipe for our Marquette HS Band Camp.  We adjusted the recipe for 90 servings.  It turned out perfectly!  As the kitchen coordinator for the Band I have begun to receive e-mails from parents for the recipe.  It is a hit and perfect as is.

I didn't have yellow cake mix, so i used strawberry cake mix. I also didn't have vanilla extract, so i used 1/2 the amount with almond extract. The cake was amazing! It was a hit! My family finished it in less than 2 days. The thing is, if you don't like sweets, and you're on a diet, this is not the cake for you ;)
But it tastes fabulous.

Awesome! Couldn't be easier.  I made this for the first time and used lemon cake mix, omitting the vanilla from the crust.  I also only used one egg in the crust.  It was a wonderful dessert-- reminiscent of soft lemon bars.  Delicious hot out of the oven and still great after sitting in the fridge for a couple of days.  Thanks for the recipe!

Ok.  I tweaked it just a little bit.  I added 1 teaspoon of almond extract to the cream cheese mixture and only used 3 1/2 cups of powdered sugar.  I don't care for it to be quite that sweet.  I bake it in a cookie sheet instead of a cake pan also.  I like the texture of the thinner bars.  It also seems to go a little further when you are taking is somehwere.

I love this and it's so easy.  I do agree with other reviewers that using less sugar is better.  2½ to 3 cups of confectioner's sugar is plenty.

Had bought a Paula Dean Gooey Butter cake a few months ago and really enjoyed, so I wanted to recreate it...and this recipe came pretty darn CLOSE!!!! Was tasty, and had the perfect, light crunch and creamy texture. Added some pre-melted chocolate to the cake batter and put the cakes into two 8x8 pans. Made one kinda black and white and one was simply the original. Both were great!!!

I have made this several times. I find that if you add a little milk to the crust it makes it more tender. I also add nuts to the crust and cut the sugar to 3 cups.  You can also spice it up a bit by adding cinnamon and nutmeg. Excellent recipe.

This is a total WOW! Everyone loved it.  I always refused to use box cakes but it seems that all the gooey butter cake recipes called for them.  This one had great reviews so I went with it.  I used a Butter Recipe Golden Duncan Hines mix and otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Mine was perfect at 45 minutes.

EXCELLENT! i have only had gooey butter cake once before i made this recipe. this recipe was a big hit at my moms mary kay party. the texture and looks of it were just as i remembered, however it was a little too sweet for my taste. next time i may just use 3 cups of sugar instead of four. and it IS better if you cut it up and let in sit in a tupperware overnight. it makes it softer rather than crunchy around the edges. i think it also helps with the sweetness. thanks for the recipe!

The taste of this cake was out of this world.  I added about a cup of chocolate chips to the batter and sprinkled a little coconut on top.  I probably should have cooked it a tad longer because of the extras I included because it turned out a little more gooey than it should have.  My husband just raved about the taste.  Will definately make again.

This is a close version to the original one I've used.  My family always uses the butter cake mix, not the yellow and I think that makes a difference.  We also just use a box of powdered sugar since that's super easy - no measuring!  I also divide the dough and topping between two square aluminum pans.  I think it cooks a little easier more evenly.  Plus, you can give one away and keep one!  I've tried it with chocolate chips and it's pretty good (some people liked that better) but I think using the chocolate cake mix is never as good as the original.  I love chocolate too but I think it just tastes much better as the original.  Save the chocolate for gooey brownies instead!

I halfed the recipe (used small box of j!ffy) and put it in a pie plate. Beautiful! I also added a small squeeze of lemon and some zest to the crust and a half lemon of juice to the topping. Kind of cut the uber sweet and made the dessert more "adult" people went NUTS for the lemon butter cake. I may add it on here as a separate recipe.

1. To spread the cake layer easier wet your finger tips. 2.  I created a very light layer of brown sugar mixed with cinnamon in the middle.  3.  The cheese layer would be much better if it was created with just using the philly cream cheese  - cheese cake recipe on the box instead of just mixing powdered sugar with cream cheese.  It was way too sweet and I even put lemon juice in the cheese mixture.  I wont make this again, Sorry

I had to give this 5 stars because of it's taste as well as ease of making.  I opted to go with one less cup of sugar, cooked it at 350 for 40 minutes, and added chopped pecans to the cake mix portion.  It came out delicious!!

I moved to St. Louis 4 years ago, and never understood Gooey Butter Cake. I'd always had the premade kind you can get at the store, though. I thought I would give it another try, so I found this recipe and made it for my family in Oklahoma. It was AMAZING! I used vanilla extract instead of almond, and I couldn't stop eating it. So good!

Wow.... this is like a krispy kreme donut times 100. They are super sweet but really good. 35-40 mins and they were golden brown on top... Let it rest for most of the day and it was easy to cut into little squares... and I mean LITTLE squares. Although there is a wonderful gooey and crispy combination, I found it hard to eat more than one at a time. I will take the advice of others and reduce the sugar and possibly try a different cake flavor next time.

I followed someone else's advice and used almond extract in the crust instead of vanilla. Very yummy! It definitely tasted better on the second and third day. My husband took some in to his coworkers and they all loved it, too.

VERY easy to make, and I have made this for years, but also very easy to mess up!  If you dont use the right size pan (13X9) it will not turn out right. This is a yummy cake though!

This recipe is awesome as is. I had never heard of this, but my big Texan husband told me he wanted some and I'm glad he told me about it. It is VERY sweet but oh-so-addicting and everyone that tried it loved it. I had a problem with the middle being very wet and gooey and the outside edges being a little more done, so I'm going to try making mini-cupcake size ones and see if it turns out better. Overall, GREAT recipe for home or potluck.

Birthday tradition in our house - but this version is incorrect - use just 2c Confectioners Sugar, not 4c if you have any hope at all of "pouring" the cream cheese layer. Add 4c and you are left with a solid mass. Be careful not to overbake.

This cake was YUMMY!! The only cream cheese I had on hand was the cinnamon swirl, and it had even been used, so it wasn't full. I added a little extra cinnamon to the cake mixture and threw in a half bag of chocolate chips. I'm sure the recipe as-is is still delicious, but using what I had on hand, it still turned out amazing!

Very good, is a little too sweet so I followed some of the reviews and added chopped pecans which helped balance out the flavors. I only used 2 cups of sugar and added 1/4 cup of melted butter to the filling as per the Paula Dean recipe (her recipe called for 1/2 cup of butter)

I have made this recipe for several years. It has been called a Chess Cake or a Neiman Marcus Cake. I just call it a family favorite. Although I use 2 cups of powdered sugar instead of 4. This is a never fail recipe. Give it a try!

This was great.  I used only one box of powdered sugar.  Cooked it for 30 min in a glass pyrex.  I also buttered and floured the  pyrex dish. Very good.

This is SOOO good!  My husband called this "excellent" and "EVIL!"  which it is, very rich.  Everyone ate the first one soon after it was made, I had to make another one because my family demanded it!  Didn't use the yellow cake mix, I like Betty Crocker's Moist French Vanilla.  A keeper!  Thanks!

I have been making this cake for several years and I add a can of crushed pineapple to the filling along with coconut extract- you can also sub out all the confectioners sugar for Splenda and it is just as good, then just add a little of the powdered sugar on top. Also a tip for cutting it into nice neat little squares is to line the pan with parch/wax paper, once cooled lift out of the pan and cut with a pizza cutter.

I'm at odds with this cake. I'm not quite sure if I like it. I was so excited about making it too, I ran out to the store to buy a cake mix and block of cream cheese. It gets four stars though since the kids are eating it up (duh, there's loads of sugar). I might make it again, but not for me.

This recipe is very rich, but it's oh-so good!  Might be a little too rich for some, but insanely good for those who love that kind of thing.  And it travels well.  Every time I take it to a work potluck, people go nuts for it.

This recipe was awesome!  I had tried this cake several times before at various parties and gatherings, and never knew what it was called.  And then, finally, at a recent St. Patty's Day party I overheard someone call it Gooey-sticky cake, so I thought I would give this recipe a try.  And it was perfect!  It was exactly what I was looking for!  BTW, you should DEFINITELY let it set overnight before serving.  It is so much better the next day!

This cake is just crazy! It's a gooey delicious mess- just as it says. I made it for my sis, after she had her wisdom teeth out b/c she couldn't chew. She loved it. First I made it w/ yellow cake- but then, we tried it w/ Strawberry Cake. Both ways are delicious. The second time I did bake it on 325 for the first 30 minutes, then upped it to 350 for the last 10 minutes or so. That helped the browning on top be more even. It's not the prettiest cake, but it sure is tasty!

Super easy and tasty. I think 3 cups powdered sugar is plenty - 4 would have been too much even for me and I have a sweet tooth. I used a lowfat cream cheese because that is all I had and it still turned out. Take a look at it after 30 minutes then add bake time as needed. My oven took about 40. This might be good with almond flavoring (maybe a little less than 1 tsp since it is a strong extract - maybe 1/2) with maybe some coconut and nuts in the crust. Cool to play with.

I've never rated a recipe until now! This is one that will be passed down and around. My new fav dessert and I am a chocolate lover. This is soo not chocolate, but so rich and gooey! I love allrecipes for hooking me up with it. Followed the recipe exactly...wouldn't change a thing. My husband who hates my "cooking experiments" as he calls them, loved this! He even commented that we should serve it at our dinner parties from now on. Amazing!
Thanks for a new favorite!

Scrumptious! Not dry at all! I was out of vanilla extract and the cake still turned out excellent. Three cups of confectioners' sugar is plenty! We had this with Blue Bell Homemade Vanilla Ice Cream and it was too good. Will make again!!!

Not impressed with this at all.  The crust is dry, the filling is very sweet although I followed others suggestions and only used 2 cups of powdered sugar.  I also waited until the next day to taste per others.  Won't make this again.

Nothing short of brillant and yummy.  I made these for family and everyone loved them. My dad even though they came from some fancy bakery!  These bars are VERY rich, so faint of heart need not apply!

The only downside I have about making this cake is the pan comes back with the outer edge still in it! Leave some of the gooey middle for the cook!

I made this for Christmas and was very dissappointed (as was my family). It was too sweet and too gooey, you could barely get it out of the pan. Little to say this will be one for the not to keep list.

I think it's all my fault that this cake didn't work for me.  I modified the recipe on my first attempt by decreasing the sugar to 2 and 3/4 cups and then adding lemon juice and zest to the cream cheese topping.  Big mistake - it didn't set properly so I had to overbake the entire cake.  The taste was lovely though.  My cake turned out to be more of a chewy slice, I topped it with icing sugar and am serving it at a morning tea today.

I do want to make this cake again but I will follow the recipe properly and instead of vanilla essence for the cream cheese topping, I will use lemon essence but no lemon juice, the extra liquid spoiled my first attempt.

Thanks for an easy recipe, Barbara.  I will post again when I have made the cake properly.

EDIT: had to give this 4 stars at least because everyone at work loved the cake!!  Thanks Barbara!!

Easy to make and delicious.  I also used only 3 cups of powdered sugar and it was enough.  I think 4 cups would make it too sweet.

These were the hit of the afternoon! The husband loved them and asked for me to bake them again. These were a definite hit among not only him but also the guests at the tea party.

Anyone who has been to Philly ;and gone to The Mayfair Bakery, and Haegele's at Erdrick and Barnett St know this is not a real butter cake.  Neither of them use cream cheese in their recipes. They are two of my favorites,and I wouldn't eat them if they did.

Read reviews and took this advice: Baked for 35 minutes and only used 3 cups of powdered sugar. Also used a lemon cake mix. So delicious.

I made this tonight.  Followed the recipe...no changes made.  it was very dry and the bottom of the cake was overcooked at 40 minutes.  Maybe 350 degrees is too high.  If I make this again, I will try baking at 325 degrees and maybe 35 minutes.  Not sure what I did wrong, but it was not "Ooey Gooey"....

This is just like Paula Deen's gooey butter cake. The cake isn't hard, but crispy. the gooey layer is delicious. 

Variations include white cake mix, with lemon and a little lemon zest in the gooey part for a lemon gooey butter cake.

Or brownie mix (or chocolate cake mix) for the crust, and add 1/2 cup cocoa to the gooey layer and an extra egg. Serve warm with ice cream because this is SUPER rich.

Baking times for both remain the same.

I used a lemon cake and it was SOOOO good! It was a bit dry, but I'm sure it'll be fabulous tomorrow, as other people said. I was going to wait to try it, but I couldn't! I probably would have cut the sugar in half had I read the reviews first, but I made it as is, and took it out at 35 minutes, and it was more than ready. The only thing I changed was using a lemon cake as well as adding a little bit of extra cake mix from a recipe I found online, because the box was 15.25 Oz, and the recipe called for 18.25. If you Google 18.25 cake mix but only 15.25, you'll see the recipe at the top of the search. It was perfect!

A couple things about this recipe- ADD A CUP (or more)OF CHOCOLATE  CHIPS in between the cake and gooey layer. Bake it for less than it says too 40 min dries out the cake layer. Also this dessert is even better the next day when it’ has time to set up more as long as you keep it covered!!! Our family and close friends have been making Paula Deen’s version of this dessert for years, which has chocolate chips in the middle and it’s one of my favorite desserts of all time! Not for the faint of heart however, very rich and sweet!

If you’ve ever made cheesecake, there is one step I recommend. Cream and fluff the cream cheese a bit with the mixer before adding the eggs and vanilla. Will make a much smoother batter. I haven’t tasted it yet but I do also recommend that this is a make ahead dish. Make it the day before, cool, cover tightly with foil/saran and refrigerate.

I think this recipe would have been a lot better if you doubled the amount of cream cheese, using  2 -8oz packages and cut in half, using only 2 cups of the powdered sugar.  I'm going to try this cake once more to see if my way is less sweet. I'd say if your a buttercream junkie then you'd probably love this recipe because it's extremely sweet!!

First time making it and it's very simple! I agree that you need to make it the day before, not only does it taste better, but it comes out of the pan easier too!! I added diced peaches and whipped cream to the top after it baked and it was similar to a peach cobbler!

Really good recipe, and tastes just right. My yellow cake mix was just a little smaller than what the author called for, so I used a smaller pan. That was a rookie mistake; the cake ended up a little too thick and was a bit too soft. Still tasted perfect. Going to try again soon!

Read through dozens of reviews and then made a few changes....Used 2 1/2 cups of the sugar, doubled the cream cheese and added a dash of lemon juice in addition to the vanilla.  Let cool overnight, then cut into bars and refrigerated.  Tastes like a high end cheese cake.  This is second time making and will definitely make again and again. Great for potluck or group get togethers, so rich you can downsize the portion and serve a good size crowd...... can always have seconds, thirds etc.... so yummy!!! Wished I could give 10 stars!!

I baked it at 325 for 50 minutes. Cut the sugar to 2 cups. I used Vanilla Butter Nut extract in the cake mix. I added 1/2 cup of softened butter to the cream cheese mixture. I topped it with lightly sweetened homemade whipped cream. I found that the homemade whipped cream added a lightness to this decadent dessert. I have never made this cake or even heard of it before, but I guess me using the recipe for a guideline and tweaking it worked out because everyone loves it.

As with so many recipes, the quantity of sugar in this recipe is ridiculous. Reduce the sugar by at least 50% and it is delicious. I used only 1 cup i/o 4 cups and it was a HUGE hit! There is already sugar in the cake mix so why race toward diabetes with excess sugar?

I thought I was making the same recipe as Paula Deen butter cake when I baked this, boy was I wrong!  I thought 4 cups of sugar was to much but I didn’t stop and check it until I took it out of the oven. It looked different and one bite in I realized I made a mistake. If you aren’t diabetic and eat this, you will be. HUGE FAIL had to throw the dish away.

I made this  exact to the recipe. My husband loved it and gave it full 5 stars, but I found this ridiculously sweet, as expected with all that powdered sugar. I will probably make this again as he will request it, but I would probably not make this again for myself. If you love sweet sweet sweet, go for it.

A Betty Crocker vanilla cake mix, 15.25 oz, and 4 tablespoons lemon juice. Made and served the about an hour after cool down. It was fabulous! Maybe it could have sat longer, but it still tasted awesome!

This is so good! My boyfriend tried a store-bought piece and kept dropping not-so-subtle hints that it would be better homemade. So, I go onto allrecipes as usual and I found this recipe I just tried this and I feel like I want to eat the whole cake! It’s a very nice, sweet cake with great yet simple flavor! Would 100% recommend making for a family gathering.

Loved it. Will definitely be made again. Didn't make any changes. But will use a bigger pan. It's very thick and I prefer it a little thinner.

I prefer the recipe with butter in both layers. It is goeyer! The “crust” layer was dryer in this version. I followed the baking instructions, but perhaps right at the 40 Minute make or a little less would have been better. I will make the Paula Deen or one with butter in. Both layers next time as it’s one of my favorites.

I made this recipe and it was delicious! The only thing I will change for next time is the bake time. The recipe calls for 40-45 min. I went with 42 and felt it was a bit over done. Once the cake cooled it became pretty tough. Again, the taste was great. I also didn't use the full amount of sugar, only because I ran out. I only ended up adding about a cup and 1/2. I think the full 4 cups would have been sickeningly sweet.

Sorry but as a St. Louis native I have to correct this! If you use two eggs for the crust it will come out more like cake and a bit dry.  The crust should really be  cake mix, 1 stick butter, and ONE egg.  The crust mixture should not be too wet; it should be almost like a pie dough.   This will allow the gooey topping to soak in a bit and create a dense, moist lower layer.

I made this recipe a couple of weeks ago to bring to my daughter's house for dessert and was disappointed.  This recipe has a cake like crust which is not what I have made or eaten in the past: we prefer a more shortbread cookie type crust.  Being pressed for time and unable to find my recipe from the past, I settled for this one.  I'm sorry to say that this recipe was not a hit with us St. Louisans.  I definitely plan to look more thoroughly through my recipes for my family's favorite Gooey Butter cake recipe.

Followed directions to a T as I always do in new recipes, 40 mins in the oven burnt the bottom. My sweet addict of a daughter didn’t even like it.  This is not at all authentic gooey butter cake btw (which is not made with either cake mix or cream cheese) but I thought it may be nice to try a quick fast version....  will stick to putting in the work for the real thing from now on.

I followed the recipe exactly as it was written and 45 minutes after it was supposed to be done the top half was liquified and the bottom half was starting to burn. Wish the direction were more explicit so I didn’t waste my money getting these ingredients.

One time I failed to follow directions properly and added ALL ingredients together, rather than in two steps!  It turned out different, a much creamier, denser gooey butter cake (like cheesecake) and was divine.  Plus it was not as dry as the regular recipe!!  Call it another version of Gooey ("Nutter" in this case) Butter Cake!

The cake is very sweet. Next time I may reduce the amount of powdered sugar used. I also could only find 15 oz cake mix and could not get it spread in a 9 x 13 pan well at all. I ended up putting it in an 8 x 8 which made the cake and topping very thick. The cake was a little bit dry this way too.

I made it as directed for the first time and it’s great!! VERY rich and sturdy!! The crust is the best part!! 45 minutes was perfect!! You will find some goo on the toothpick even after 45 min, not a ton, but it likely won’t come completely clean. It’s really a very interesting dessert, definitely worth a try!!

This cake was quick and easy to make and, though with good flavor, I found it too sweet for my palate. I shared the cake with friends who described it as "good." I will make it again, but with less sugar.

I've always enjoyed "All Recipes" as recipes source, and I studied a lot of recipes for ooey-gooey before I settled on this particular cake.  WOW - I know most said it was a very sweet cake, and I expected to eat smaller portions to remedy that.  Ouch, this cake is entirely too sweet for my tastebuds.  Perhaps the recipes that require butter in both the bottom and the cream are tempered by the butter;  but unfortunately, although it is most definitely gooey as promised, I won't be making this one again.  If you do, I suggest getting some heavy cream to pour over when you serve it.

I followed another users suggestion and cut the sugar in half and doubled the butter. It is so sweet now I can't imagine what it would be like with twice the sugar!  My husband grew up an hour from St Louis so he is much more familiar with this cake than I am, and he said it turned out perfect!  Planning to freeze most of it to serve at our family Christmas party.

I was introduced to Gooey Butter Cake a few months ago out in the mid west and fell in love with it! No one in Virginia ever heard of it so I found this recipe and made it. I followed the recipe exactly and WOW is it good! The top is a little crunchy, the bottom is gooey and sweet. It's a party in my mouth! Love it love it love it!!

This was an excellent addition to my favorite recipes.  I did bake longer than recipe suggested, due to the fact toothpick did not come out clean.  Five minute increments, checked often with toothpick till clean.

I followed the recipe exactly as written ... made this in a bundt pan ... baked for about 45 minutes at 350 degrees.  It turned out awful ... the cake portion rose but  was totally hollow inside --- the cream cheese filling did not change in consistency except to get a bit more runny.  the taste was way too sweet .. never thought  i would say something was too sweet.  Couldn't eat it... had to throw the whole thing out.

I made it for my husband's birthday - he's from St. Louis, gooey butter cake big deal there - and it was a hit, I already have been asked for the recipe. Prepared exactly as instructed - it was so easy and quick to get ready! I didn't have problems getting the crust mix spread, just used clean hands to pat evenly into the pan and that did the trick for me.

Followed exactly.  It's a rich cake by nature---I would not advise cutting out substantial amounts of sugar. Was a popular Father's Day dessert.

I just made this with German chocolate cake for the base cause that's what I had on hand, and with less sugar after reading so many reviews. I cooked it for 35 minutes at 325 in my glass pan, and it was okay, not dry or anything, but not mind blowing. I live two hours from St. Louis, so I'm going to be on the lookout for gooey butter cake when we travel, so we can try it and see what it's supposed to taste like. I'm glad I only made a half pan; the rest will be headed to my hubby's office tomorrow morning. It's good, but frankly not worth the calorie bomb as I made it. Maybe after it's cooled completely and with some powdered sugar on top it will improve.

I rarely give 5 stars but the response t this cake did not disappoint!
I added some cookie butter and it elevated both the flavors and the gooey part.
I love this recipe because I have the ingredients in the pantry and because it is so different.
I also put it i the freezer to set and its yummy cold.

I have made this at least 10 times!  I add a little almond extract to the cake layer instead of vanilla and only use 3 cups of powdered sugar.  I made it with 4 cups a couple of times but it's just too sweet for me.  Tastes like heaven if it is a little chilled!

Simple and easy recipe. I had to tweak it a bit because I was out of vanilla extract. I used the coffee extract I had on hand and it gave it a very tasty butterscotch-y flavor to it. Give that a try to see if you like it that way.

A verrrrry sweet rich cake.  My husband loved it!  I'll cook less time next time.  The crust was too dark on the bottom at 40 mins.  Keep checking.  Also used 3 cups sugar.  Was more than enough.

I have made this multiple times.  It is very close to the gooey butter cakes they made at a bakery I worked at when I was a teen.  Since I have moved from St. Louis, this is the only way I could introduce my kids to this cake.  Yes it is very sweet and a little goes a long way, but it is perfect with a cup of coffee!

Decadent perfection.  Used an entire stick of butter with cake mix...because, why not? And sifted powdered sugar but only used 3 cups.  My family loves it.

Yes, I've made this same recipe for years, but always use a "Golden" yellow cake mix. It makes all the difference. Be sure it's "golden", not just a plain yellow cake mix. ~ Patricia Voelkel

Gooey Butter Cake originated here in St. Louis & it is indeed supposed to be super sweet. Should be cut in small pieces & do not serve with a sweet drink. This version of the recipe is the easiest & most popular. ENJOY :-)

Seriously the BEST and easiest recipe I've tried by far! I live in California and I can make this for parties and be confident that no one has had this treat before and will never know how easy it truly is. I follow the recipe to a T and it comes out great every time! Once I had to use a larger pan and though it was harder to spread, the result was still magical.

This is a really sweet cake, but the yellow cake mix as the bottom layer makes it so buttery and decadent, I love this cake and everyone that eats it raves about it, especially my son, he's requested this cake as his Birthday cake for the past few years.

This was pretty good, but a little dry on bottom. I added extra butter and it was still dry...maybe some water next time :S Also, I cut some of the sugar from the topping.

Yes.. It turned out great!! But for all you new -bs, make sure you whip your cream cheese by itself, and add your other ingredients one at a time.. Otherwise your topping will turn out lumpy.. Enjoy

Gooey butter cake is a St. Louis tradition & my daughter's favorite cake. It is super easy to make & is a delicious slice of super fattening heaven. This will also stay fresh for several days - if it lasts that long.

This is an amazing, rich and delicious recipe!  Did I say easy?  So it kind of reminds me of a chess pie, which is one of my all time favorites.  I used fresh peaches that I pre-cooked with sugar before adding the fruit layer.  It was amazing, and just as good hot from the oven as chilled!

These are wonderful if you throw some blueberries in.  I've also made them in mini muffin tins. It's more work but it makes a nice dessert for a special occasion and every piece has crust.

I made this yesterday for my family. I took the advice of another reviewer and added double the butter and half the sugar. I think if I make this cake again Ill follow the recipe to a T. It turned out really dense and not ooey-gooey at all. Maybe that's the normal consistency of it, not sure since this is my first time making or having it, but I was a bit disappointed. Also, I hadn't noticed if other reviewers mentioned this, but if you bake this cake it needs to be refrigerated or it just crumbles and falls apart. I may make again just to see if I should've followed the recipe and not a reviewers advice.

Fell in love with gooey butter cake when we moved to St. Louis a few years back.  I always assumed there were magical little old ladies down on ‘The Hill’ baking up yummy goodness.  First tried this recipe last fall and it turned out awesome.  Made it several times since, each with a slight tweak as other users suggested and it is always excellent.  This recipe is the real deal!

This was fine. Not great. I cut the sugar in half and it was still plenty sweet. Will search for some other recipes rather than making this again.

I used only 1/2 cup of sugar & spread my homemade lemon curd before putting the cream cheese mix.  It's perfect.

I tried the recipe, made it years ago and had been looking for the recipe!
It seems a bit sweeter, however, if I were to top it with fruit, I would not advise
serving it drenched in syrup!

I had a go at making this cake yesterday....I think it should be renamed as a Pudding.....there was no way to slice this cake up and serve... just had to scoop it out and plonk it on the plate. You have to like really sweet things to enjoy it.  One piece was quite enough, and no going back for a second "slice".   I don't think I will try again any time soon

I wasn't overly impressed with this. It came out of the oven beautifully cooked, it smelled divine and I was thinking wow this is going to be so good! I made it according to the recipe except that I cut the sugar back to 2 cups, but when I tried it, it just seemed too plain. I finally made a tart blueberry sauce to drizzle over it to cut the overwhelming sugar taste and that seemed to make it more appealing. I think maybe its just too sweet for me. Still, it is easy to make and if you like really sweet things, this is a good recipe to have.

This is the first time I ever made this, and I must say that I agree that it is way too sweet. Also, I am not sure what I did wrong, but it turned out a bit on the runny side.

Does the job.  The bottom layer dough is really sticky, but if you're patient, it is spreadable.  Incredibly rich.

I like the texture of this cake, but it is waaaaay to sweet for my liking! I am going to try to make it one more time and add lemon extract to see if it will cut the sweetness. It got eaten at my house, but not nearly as quickly as the other goodies I've made.

This was good but very very sweet. Even with only 3 cups of confectioner's sugar (which was one full box). I liked it so I will definitely make again but I'll reduce the amount of sugar for sure. Oh and I used a lemon flavored cake mix

This is the base of my go-to desert.  I usually use either a 9x13 springform or an 11.5" Tart pan for easier removal from the pan.  I can get way more than 18 servings from the cake tho.  People complain they're small until they eat one, then they understand.   Very flexible recipe, I probably have 2 dozen custom variations.

Simply the most delicious thing I've ever made. I grew up in the Philly area, so butter cake was an occasional treat.  My Kitchen Aid stand mixer made it sooo easy, too.  I followed the recipe exactly, but used a butter yellow mix.  I also baked it at 325 in my convection oven for 26 minutes.  Wish I could give it more than 5 stars!

I decided to make this recipe after tasting it at a party, it was sooo yummy..but for some reason, mine was a complete disaster!  I'm usually a great baker, but I ended up throwing the whole thing away.  I'm not sure what went wrong, but I know this cake is amazing if it is made correctly.  Truly a five star recipe, but my mishap warrants a 4 - star caution.

I love this recipe!  I hate store bought gooey butter cakes but this is AWESOME!  I goofed up the last time I made it and put an 8 oz pkg of cream cheese in the cake/crust layer also and it was SO good!  Made it even more rich and moist!  I've found that a butter yellow cake mix is the best (I think it was from Betty Crocker or Duncan Heins).

Oh my goodness...did I get rave reviews on this cake. Everyone at work LOVED it and asked me to make again for the next bday celebration. I thought it was really sweet but apprently, most people don;t mind that. Very easy to make so I guess I'll be making this one again.

This turns out a little different each time I make it but always WONDERFUL! Aftre the cake cools completely I sift more powdered sugar to cover the top.   I've even tried using a marble cake mix which is great and adds a little twist.  Gooey butter cake is a big thing in our area and everyone loves this much more than any store bought version they've ever had!

This recipe was delicious. My husband wants me to make another one this weekend. I listened to the advice of several reviewers and cut back on the sugar (only used 2 1/2 cups) it was still very sweet but excellent non-the less.

All I can say about this is it is utterly sickeningly sweet. We love desserts but this is way too sugary. My daughter had heard about this from friends and wanted to make something delicious for our family but thought it way too sweet and rich even for her.

This cake is rich and delicious. I used this recipe as a Sunday Dinner dessert, it was a big hit. I decided to make it for Christmas, this time used a can of crushed pineapples that I had blended and added it to the cake mixture. After baking/cooling. I used a cream cheese frosting to top it off. (Because of the added ingredients, I used 21/2 c instead of 4c of pwdrd sugar.) It was even more scrumptious. mmmmmmm good! My sis-in-law called me the next day wanting the recipe.

My mom made this all the time when I was growing up.  We called it Chess Cake.  I just made this last night for the holidays.  I added a 15oz can of pumpkin and some pumpkin pie spice to the filling.  Requires a little longer baking time with the pumpkin mixed in!  So yummy!

I have made a version of this cake but with pumpkin, cinnamon and nutmeg. It is great for thanksgiving instead of pumpkin pie. Everyone is right it does not last very long. :)

Delicious! It's very sweet but yummy. I followed the recipe exactly. I bet if you used 2-3 cups of sugar instead of 4 it would be just fine.

I really didn't care for this as it was just too rich.  My boyfriend on the other hand ate the whole pan up and would give it a 4 star rating. Personal preference...

This cake is awesome. Yes, it is sweet, and it is supposed to be.  Do not cut back on any of the ingredients.  It is a nice and easy cake to make when you are asked to bring a dessert.  It is plain, yet different, and tastes great.

Yum!  My Mom used to make this when I was younger!  This wasn't exactly as hers was, this was a lot more gooey on top with a bit different taste but was just as tasty!  Very sweet!  Perfect!  Thank you!

I brought this cake to a bbq and it was a hit. I followed the recipe exactly, although I did cut back on the sugar. I used 2 1/2 cups and sprinkled a little of it on the top when it was done. It was still very sweet, but pretty good and very rich. I also baked it for 30 minutes instead of the 40 as stated in the recipe. I should probably have took it out at 35 minutes so it would have firmed up a little in the middle. Still a hit though. Would be great with some vanilla ice cream on top!

I make this cake for my teen girls and their friends and everyone loves it.  I made one for a party, that went away and made a second and it was being sampled before the top had set, a really cute memory for me.

Pretty good over all, but the bottom layer was pretty dry. You almost didn't notice, though, because the top layer was so gooey. The top layer, however, was way too sweet for my taste. Very rich and sweet.

This is so good! The recipe I have for this is called Neiman Marcus Cake. The only difference is no vanilla in the cake mix part and add a little cinnamon in the cream cheese mixture. I also only baked it 35 minutes. Yummy!!!!!

I used pound cake mix instead and I guess thats why it came out dry. And I used only 2 cups of conf. sugar like others said so it wasn't to sweet. It was alright but I will not make it again.

This is OK, very rich. I only used 3 cups of sugar, which is plenty. Probably won't make again...lots of other choices for future recipe trying.

This cake wasn't that great. Definitely not something I would rave about. The bottom was way too brown. Won't make again.
