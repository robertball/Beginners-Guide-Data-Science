I made these with oatmeal infant cereal and they turned out great. I spread the batter on the cookie sheet to make bar cookies instead of individual cookies and they are moist and very flavorful. I have lots of cereal to use up since my 10.5 month old refuses to eat it anymore so I will be making quite a few bathces of these!

Good job! I made this one with my kids today and we all loved it. A few alterations turned out to make a delicious and healthy (relatively speaking) cookie. I doubled the recipe (I have 4 kids and a vacuum for a husband). I substituted half whole wheat flour with the all purp and reduced the butter to 1c. I also reduced the brown sugar by 1/2 and they were still pretty sweet. Next time I'll probably reduce the white sugar too. Oh it really helped to chill this dough before baking too! I definitly recommend this one.

This recipe is GREAT! My 12 month old loves them and they have some nutritional value that is lacking in so many other snacks! I'm tempted to buy more baby cereal so I can make some more!

I'm giving it 4 stars but only because I made changes...the end result was definately worth a 5. I used 1 cup whole old-fashioned oats instead of baby cereal I used 2 bananas instead of applesauce added only 1 stick of organic butter and I added an extra 1/4 cup flour. It still seemed to thin so I placed the dough in my mini-muffin cups. PERFECT!! My kids gobbled them up - begged for more. I think this is as "healthy" as a great tasting cookie can get.

These were so moist that they were hard to get off of the cookies sheet. I even added more flour to the recipe. I like the ingredients and the taste is fine. But if stacked they stick together and I had to throw out the first batch because they would not come off the pan without becoming a lump of mooshed cookie.

I made these but used acontainer of sugar free blueberry applesauce. Since I didn't have the cereal I used about 4-5 packages of blueberry instant oatmeal. They turned out delicious... Great and hearty but also sweet and blueberry! One note if you make the switch to oatmeal make sure you use enough or they will turn out pancakey. (look for a normal "dough" consistency). Yum

I didn't change a thing and they turned out wonderful - soft not overly sweet vanilla-nutty flavor. Thank you Jennifer.

I really liked these. I made them for my daughter (18 mos) and she didn't really like them (she doesn't eat much though). But I did. They were soft and cake-like and when they come straight out of the oven they are slightly crispy on the outside yum.

I had plenty of leftover infant cereal to use up and these cookies were very good. They do come out a bit moist but when they're cooled they taste just fine. Even got the toddlers to eat them great. Not too sweet for me but if you like sweet cookies add a bit more sugar or applesauce to sweeten 'em.

I made these for my toddlers but I like them a lot too! I have a lot of baby cereal that the kids will not eat anymore so I was happy to find a good recipe to use it up. These are soft and have a light sweet taste.

Excellent recipe! I didn't change a thing except I spread the batter in an 8x8 glass baking dish and baked it for about 30 minutes. It turned out to be 16 very moist bars. I am looking forward to getting rid of excess baby cereal by making these several more times. Thank you for the recipe! My husband toddler and I all love it.

These are pretty awesome. I melted the butter and just mixed the wet and dry ingredients and combined the two. Then I spread the batter on a cookie sheet and cut into bars with a pizza cutter when cooled. I reduced the sugar to just 3/4 cup and only used brown. They freeze really well so I just leave out six bars at a time and when those are gone I pull six more bars from the freezer till it is all used up.
