I made half a recipe in an 8"x8" pan, and these bars turned out wonderful.  First time I've ever prepared a recipe with refrigerated cookie dough (used NestlesÂ® chocolate chip), and I have to say this dough lived up to my expectation of a really good, homemade chocolate chip cookie.  I used a hand mixer for the filling, and blended for about a minute. It just doesn't get much easier than this...ooey, gooey, chewy, and delicious!

Followed directions, added 1tsp vanilla to the cream cheese mixture. I used cookie dough I had made the day before. Really delicious.

This is amazing and very rich! I made my own cookie dough instead of using pre-packaged. It took about 40 minutes to bake and a took it out when the cookies on top were brown, almost looked overcooked but it wasn't. The layer in the middle is pretty thick so next time I make it I may make a recipe and a half of chocolate chip cookies for a thicker cookie layer. Thank you for the recipe!
