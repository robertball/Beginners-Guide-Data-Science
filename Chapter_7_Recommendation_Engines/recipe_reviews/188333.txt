Hi Folks, I want to thank you for your nice reviews.  Glad you enjoy the salad as much as my friends and family do.  Just wanted to mention, if there is any left over it is great mixed with a little Italian flavored bread crumbs and stuffed in mushrooms then baked for 1/2 hour at 325 for an appetizer.  You might even add some grated Parmesan to the top just before removing from the oven.   A friend has made this salad with left over roast pork and it is also very tasty.  I grind almost everything left over and give it a try.  I had two left over Chicken Cordon Blue's the other day, ground them up and made chicken salad and it was awesome.  The combination of the cheese and the ham made it delicious.   Thanks again for the reviews.  Happy days and happy grinding. :o]  Winter Blossom

Very good! I did just what the description below the recipe dictated and marched right up to my deli counter and asked for the ham ends, along with enough ham to make 1 1/2 lbs. I did use light mayo and fresh onion, as I didn't have any dry minced onion on hand. I don't know about serving twelve...my three boys asked for second sandwiches and I spread some on Toppers crackers. Aside from a little leftover, it's gone gone gone. I'll make this again!

Wow.  I had never tried ham salad before.  It always sounded like something my very southern grandmother used to make (mashed vienna sausage sandwiches anyone?)  But I made a glazed ham the other night and needed something different to try with the leftovers.  I'm eating this right now and it's just glorious.  I didn't have any relish so I threw in pickle slices in my processor after chopping the ham and it worked out just great.  Excellent recipe!

I agree with a previous review that, until recently, I wasn't a big fan of ham salad.  But I made this two weeks ago, and it's excellent.  As the submitter said, it's a good idea to add a little more mayo to the mixture right before you eat it to get the texture just right.  I made more of this than I meant to last time, so I've been a little creative in adding ingredients along with the extra mayo: I substituted Miracle Whip once, have added some hot sauce a few times, and some chopped jalapenos, also, all were very good and gave the salad some nice variations.   I purchased a "ham end" at the deli today (last time I made it with ham steaks), so I'll give that a try. :)  Thank you for the great recipe.

I must confess that I do not often measure when cooking, but since I had leftover ham and some doubts about this recipe, I did measure. Very good, but a little bland for my New Orleans taste buds. So, loving all things garlic, I added a sprinkle (1/2 tsp) of garlic salt and white pepper. It brought the flavors together beautifully!
I also have to say that I used light sour cream instead of mayo. A caterer friend taught me that trick years ago...anytime you want it to last longer and not taste like mayo, use sour cream.
Thanks for the recipe!!

We had leftover Christmas Cook's ham, so I was looking for a good ham salad recipe.  I was looking forward to this one because I love dill pickles and thought it would be good due to the good reviews... but I have to say that nobody in my house cared for it.  Luckily I hedged my bets and made another batch with sweet relish and added some chopped eggs.  I feel bad writing this bad review, but the flavor just didn't work for me.

Ham salad has always been a favorite of mine as a sandwich or cracker spread.  But I've never added brown mustard and that makes it especially tasty.

This is  a great recipe for ham salad. I have made it twice now, both times with leftover Costco Kirkland brand applewood smoked ham. The first time I didn't have enough dill pickle relish so I added enough Wickle's brand relish to make the 1/3 cup called for in the recipe. (Wickle's is a sweet spicy bread and butter type pickle). The second time I used all dill pickle relish. I think I preferred the one with a bit of Wickle's in it to the one with all dill pickle relish. Both times I used dijon mustard instead of brown mustard, just a personal preference. Without a doubt this is the BEST ham salad I have ever had. I had ham for Christmas this year just so I would have leftover ham to make this recipe... it is that good!!!

I have to admit that I had never even tried ham salad prior to making this recipe.  I had to serve a large crowd and didn't have enough chicken for chicken salad, but had leftover ham.  I stumbled across this recipe and decided to give it a shot.  It is surprisingly good!  I ended up just chopping up pickles since I didn't have relish.  The consistency was fine, but the juice made it a little salty.  I would recommend drying them in a paper towel if you go this route.  Thanks, Winter Blossom!

Outstanding!  This recipe is the closest I've come to duplicating how Mom made ham salad when I was a kid.  The taste, the texture...yumminess AND a happy memory, served up together on a sandwich.

Very good!  Only "change" would be to add some pepper!  I put everything in the food processor at once - and it wasn't "pasty" at all! :)  I also used a dark dijon mustard and sweet relish as that's what I had at home - plus Hellman's Olive Oil mayo.

Even good with sweet relish, light mayo, and fresh onion.  Makes a perfect quantity for sandwiches.

At first the salt was overpowering, so I added a half teaspoon of sugar.  Not sure if that tempered it, or if it just got better with age, but three days later I can't stop eating this.
I loved ham salad as a kid, and I hadn't found a great recipe - until now!  Thanks!!!

Very good recipe... although I added a little too much relish.  Great recipe as is, no need to change anything.

This is a great recipe for using left-over ham.  It was so easy to put together.  I chopped the ham but then decided I should have used the food processor so I grabbed my "smart stick" and gave a couple pulses to make it just the consistency I desired.  I only had 1/2 lb. of ham so I changed the servings to 4 and left the recipe recalculate itself.  (I love that feature!)  With Easter coming, this recipe will definitely be used again.  Thank you Blonddee for sharing!

Wow! This is really delicious. You need to wait for it to sit for a while in the fridge first for the flavors to meld together. My daughter tried it when I first made it and hated it... the dried onions were crunchy and, well, you get the picture. She tried it again this morning and WOW, we all love it. I will use the author's suggestion and take any leftovers and toss with breadcrumbs before stuffing into mushroom caps and baking. Will make again for sure.

Growing up, ham salad always was made from the Holiday ham leftovers.  I processed the ham in the food processor, and sub'd sweet pickle relish and freshly-chopped onions.  This recipe is very similar to the way my Dad made his, and we enjoyed some yummy sandwiches today.

This is pretty good.  I used leftover "honeybaked"-style ham and some of the sweetness of that is taking over the relish, onion, and mustard flavoring.  I will probably try to make this another time using smoked or boiled ham.  REVISION:  I increased this from 4 to 5 stars because after a couple of days in the frig, this tasted fantastic (even using the honey-baked)!

I made this last night with MY leftover $8 huge ham. I used regular yellow mustard as I did not realize brown mustard was called for. I really liked it, but will be try this with the brown mustard next time. My husband and small son loved it on crackers, as did I, but I really liked it as a sandwich for my lunch today. 
The flavors were much stronger the next day, I may ease back on the onion & relish just a tad unless I am making to use that day or night.

Excellent!  I had a left over smoked ham with bone which I sliced as much meat as I could off.  It was only about 1/3 lb so I adjusted the other ingredients accordingly.  Used Penzey's toasted, dried onion which made this fabulous!  If you have never used Penzey's spices you should try them!  Anyway, I didn't have brown mustard so I used Dijon and I used Spenda sweetened relish as that is all I had.  Honestly, I don't think I would change anything when I make this again.  I have no doubt it is good exactly as written, but I it sure is good with my necessary substitutions.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a HUGE hit with the kiddo and he usually doesn't like anything new.  The only thing I did different was scale down the recipe and chopped the ham small rather than put it in the food processor.  We served it on croissants.  It's a definate keeper.

Made it exactly as instructed except I didn't have enough ham, so I added corned beef since I had a corner of one left.  Really, really good!  I'm certain this recipe would be just as yummy with chicken or tuna.

I subbed sweet relish because that's what I had on hand. I thought it was pretty plain as written, so I added 1 tsp dill, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 1/2 tsp paprika, 1/4 tsp cumin, and 1 tsp sriracha. I didn't like it plain, it was ok on a sandwich, but wow...swerved on celery sticks it was absolutely amazing!! Next time I will definitely use fresh minced onion. UPDATE:  This is now my go-to recipe, and it's perfect with the changes that I make.  My husband begs me to make it!

This is excellent! I bought a huge 14lb ham on sale for $8.00 and have been trying to find different and interesting ways to use it, and this fit the bill! Only change was instead of dried onions, I had 1/4 of a fresh red onion and threw that in instead. HIGHLY recommend using red onion, really made it I thought.

Just a delicious way to use leftover ham. I followed the recipe exactly, using all the suggested ingredients. The only addition was a shake or two of black pepper. Thanks for the recipe; it is truly a winner. Make this the day before you need it as the flavors improve and "marry" as it sits over night.

I used yellow mustard b/c I don't like brown. I also used 1/2 fresh minced onion and 1/2 dried b/c I ran out of dried. I used honey baked ham leftovers and dill relish. I also used vegan mayo b/c my baby has allergies. It was AWESOME!!! I loved it! Thank you so much!

Not my mother's ham salad!  I was hesitant because of the dll relish, but my famlly always chooses dill pickles over sweet.  I didn't have minced onion or brown mustard so used some honey dijon and plain frenchs mustard, and fresh white onions finely chopped.  I think real mayonaise is the key.  No Miracle Whip.

Made it almost exactly as written. I'm not a huge fan of raw onion taste & have never used dried onion so I cut back on the amount used. Made it around noon for dinner that night. I found it to be a bit salty but served it on Hawaiian bread and it helped to balance it out.

Delicious! I made this just for myself, and thus fudged it a lot (I only used one big, thick piece of ham) but it turned out great! I added some salt and pepper, paprika, and honey because I like my ham salad sweet. I did use sweet relish and lite mayo. Thanks!

I thought it was great!  I did add fresh onion and spicy mustard along with some salt and pepper. Usually I process the ham and then add the mayo etc. to the food processor.  This time I ground the ham in the processor and then completed the recipe in a bowl.  Love the chunkier texture better than my spread type ham salad.

I made this exactly as written. Delicious served on toast, lettuce bed or used in mushroom stuffing. I did add a tiny pat of butter and some olive oil to each cap before roasting. I also added the finely chopped mushroom stems to the stuffing.

Pretty good. I had to deviate from the recipe a little since I didn't have some of the items on hand. I used Dijon mustard instead of brown, and sweet pickle relish instead of dill. Also, I didn't have any minced onion, so I crushed up some French fried onions leftover from Thanksgiving's green bean casserole! That's a trick I'm going to remember for future recipes!

I love ham salad and used this recipe as a base - it is so tasty! I sub light mayo and use sweet relish instead of dill. I also add a dash of celery salt and sometimes a tiny dash of garlic powder. LOVE it with mixed greens on toasted rye bread. Thanks Winter- you have a winner here :)

This is wonderful!!!  I was looking for a good ham salad recipe to use with the leftovers from a spiral ham.  Didn't have the dried minced onion in the house, so used onion powder and eyeballed the mayo to make sure it was the right consistancy.  I was concerned about adding the dill pickle relish, but it added just the right zing.  Thanks for sharing.

We own a small deli and I love checking all recipes for ideas. Laughed when I saw this. We have been making and selling this for over 25 years, but have not used mustard, so will try in small batch. Yes we use ham end to make it( can add bologna and other lunchmeats too..but ham is best) Only caution on ham ends is it has a hard outer surface that gives wierd texture so we are carefull to cut that off and do not add into our salad. Great for leftovers. Also we sometimes grind it in food processor and sell it sandwich spread..also good

I followed the recipe and did indeed need to add more mayo to get the proper texture.  I added a touch more onion too but that is just 'cause we like onions.  It definitely tasted much better on the second day!  Thanks so for the great recipe.

This was delicious and what a great way to use up leftover Easter ham! I used fresh onion instead of the dried and just because I've got two dozen hard boiled eggs, I chopped up a few and added them to the salad as well. Yum! Thank you Winter Blossom!

Delicious! Followed EXACTLY and it was perfect. Served at a baby shower on small rolls. I didn't think I would like this because I don't like dill relish, but you don't even taste it when it is mixed in. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this exactly as the recipe stated.  It was good, but I prefer sweet pickle relish types of ham salads over the dill.  My guests enjoyed it, but no one really raved over it like I had hoped they would.  I do recommend making it in advance to give the minced onions time to soak up some of the moisture. My only negative comment is that the minced onion taste lingered for a day no matter how much I brushed my teeth...

Actually I have made this in the past and because I thought it should contain hard boiled eggs and celery, I added them and was disappointed in the result.  I even tried adding fresh chopped onion.  Last night I made it EXACTLY as the recipe and I had rave reviews.  Stick to the recipe , that's the lesson I learned.  The use of dried minced onion adds a special flavor that is almost addictive.  I couldn't stop "taste testing".

Very good...made it exactly as recipe says except I used sweet relish instead of dill. Added a few grinds of black pepper and it needs to sit overnight for onions to soften and flavors to marry. So good as sandwiches on freshly baked croissants  or thick slices of toasted, buttered bread. Give a good stir after it sits and add a little mayo if it seems dry. I always save some leftover ham to make it or if I get a craving for it and haven't baked a ham,  will buy a thick slice at deli to use instead. Thanks for the great recipe...it is the only one I use.

Very, very good!   I had some leftover ham, made this ham salad as written (in smaller amounts) and pleased my husband with a special lunch.   So glad I found this recipe.  I've searched many books for a ham salad recipe I would make again, and have finally found it!  That Brown mustard gives it the special touch, I think.  Thanks for passing this one on...

This ham salad recipe is outstanding. Everyone who tries it says it's the best ham salad they have ever had! I make it exactly as directed. Once in a while I add a 1/4 c hot cherry peppers chopped up for the men in my family who like it spicy. Letting it sit in fridge for a few hours is a must!

Needed more "oomph".  As is, the recipe was good but not great.  I ended up adding sweet relish (in addition to the dill pickle relish), ground black pepper, onion powder (in addition to the dried minced onion) and increasing the brown mustard to get to the point of tastiness.

I made it exactly as described, and it was fantastic. The flavors are in perfect balance with each other, and even my small children like it.  Thanks for the recipe!

JUST made this for my family! Literally....the food processor is still drying! It's AMAZING! I did not have pickle relish, but I put a few dill pickles in the processor along with the onion (fresh). It's the best tasting ham salad in the world! I used the cooked ham ends and misc pieces that were left over from a smoked ham we had a week ago! I was wanting and needing something to do with leftover ham and this was the GRAND FINALE! Thanks for this! It's WONDERFUL -  I can see this on saltine crackers or nice white bread for sandwiches!

Halved the recipe, and tweaked slightly. I had leftover baked ham, but had already cut away (and snacked on) the skin since my boys don't care for it. It would have been great in this! I never have any dried minced onion on hand, so I chopped up a small yellow onion in the food processor. I also recommend doing the same with your ham, makes the prep work easy. I used a little grainy Dijon mustard along with regular yellow mustard instead of the brown (haven't seen that kind before) and a little more sweet pickle relish than called for (never have the dill kind on hand- and have only seen it at the store a few times). Added some ground black pepper and hot sauce (would probably use some cayenne or chili powder instead next time). Tasty.

To be completely fair to the submitter of this reciped, I probably used the wrong kind of ham. I just used a prepackaged ham steak that I already had. It was too salty even for me to eat, and I LOVE salt! I'm sure if I had used fresh ham leftovers or even from the deli it would have been exactly what I was looking for. My great grandmother used to make the most delicious ham salad ever and I was looking for that taste. I will try this once again with some different ham and I'm sure it will be 5 star worthy!

My husband and I made this recipe from  leftover Thanksgiving ham - he on the food processor and me as the mastermind. It's excellent! My only change was to add a co uple squirts of lemon juice at the end. We both called this "monkey meat" from our respective childhoods. Thanks.

this was great, it was simple,  what you want in a spread like this. i halved it, made exactly as directed, had spicy brown mustard on hand which gave it a little more bite than i wanted at first but after an hour everything mellowed and was great. cucumbers are great to add if you’re putting this in a sandwich. i could see fresh minced onions being good in this but the dried onions added a texture and smokiness that was terrific. definitely best if it sits for an hour or so after preparing.

This has been my go to recipe for a decade or more.  I usually start with this recipe but it is so forgiving that I sometimes stray.  I usually need more crunch so I add some celery to the food processor with the ham.  Thanks so much for this go-to recipe :)

Made it just as directed except I used fresh onion, and I doubled the recipe for a large get together.
Everyone enjoyed it, as did I. Couldn't be easier to make, which I did a day ahead of time. I garnished it with celery and pepper slices. All used for dipping. I will keep this recipe.
Thank you!

Not a big fan of ham salad, but with heaps of leftover Easter ham, gave this recipe a try & it was addictively delicious!  As others have done, used minced onions and spicy brown mustard b/c that's what I had on hand.

I've made this ham a couple of times once with dill relish and once with sweet relish. I loved it with either relish. The last time I used fresh onion, still good.

I did alter the recipe: I had sriracha brown mustard, which I thought would make the salad too spicy, so I used Dijon mustard instead, and I also used sweet relish instead of dill. It came out fine - and yes, a little on the dry side once it had chilled, so I added more mayo.

I could also see where some hard-cooked eggs might be a welcome addition.

And if you live in a place where you can find a store that sells it, try Duke's mayonnaise instead. I guarantee you'll love the difference.

Awesome recipe..  I found a beautiful 4lb baked smoked ham (skin on), on sale at our grocery store, 1/2 off..couldn’t resist that.  Good ham salad is one of my very favorites, but always seems way overpriced pre-prepared, so I gave this recipe a shot.  Other than upping the ingredients amounts (your 1.5lb vs my 4lb ham), was made precisely as indicated, and it’s perfect...I wouldn’t change a thing.Now I have tons of ham salad:)

I loved this recipe, I had a lot of ham left over from Easter and decided to give this recipe a go.  I usually made ham salad with hard boiled eggs added.  I liked the ease of making it using the food processor and didn't miss the eggs.  I didn't have pickle relish so I chopped gherkins.  I will keep this recipe as a go to recipe for Ham Salad.  Thanks for Sharing

Followed all the notes,  did not like it.    The dried onions were very overpowering,.   Not sure I liked the brown mustard add, either.   Will not be making this again.

made it as is and had it on crackers... while it was good, it was such an odd dish -  like something out of the 50s. I will likely make it again.

I used hot Brown Mustard which gave it a sweet but spicy flavor.

This was a great recipe. With one batch I made some modified changes as recommended by another reviewer (1 tsp black pepper, 1/2 tsp paprika, 1/4 tsp cumin, and 1 tbs sriracha) -- and it was even more addicting!!

Just made this with sweet relish and leftover lunch meat. So easy to make with items that you already have in your pantry. Will make again!

Very good. The only change I will make the next time will be to cut down on the pickle relish. Just personal taste.

This is my 'go to' favorite.  My bridge group always requests these sandwiches .  I usually make them ahead of time on petite croissants, adding a bit of finely chopped celery for extra crunch, and serve them along with some nice fresh fruit (in season) and a beverage.
Try this...you'll love it!

I made it exactly as written, but had to omit the onions.  My husband does not care for onions.  It was awesome!  Thank you for a great way to use up left over ham.

I'm not sure if I liked ham salad or not. I've only had it once or twice and was not that impressed. However I had a huge leftover ham from Christmas, so I thought I'd give it a try again. So glad I came across this recipe! This recipe is awesome! I added a little celery to mine and it was perfect.  I love the zip that the brown mustard adds.  I will definitely make it again.

I used my mini-processor to chop the ham and also some fresh onion, and it worked great. I sweet pickle relish and a combo of Dijon and brown mustard, as well as a few shakes of garlic powder, onion powder and black pepper. Will surely make again; thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipe for a quick delicious snack at parties. I add both sweet and dill relish (more sweet than dill) and I use dejon mustard for extra flavor. Everyone loves it.

I make this all the time. The whole family enjoys it. I will sometimes vary the recipe and use different types of ham, i.e. honey or maple. Honestly, my wife and i enjoy spicy, so we make half exactly like the recipe, and the other half with a thicker hot sauce, like Sirracha. Thanks!

Turned out pretty good. I made a few adjustments that gave it the extra kick I was looking for:

• Replaced brown mustard with Boar's head delicatessen style mustard.
• Added 3/4 TBSP lemon juice
• Added 1 1/2 TBSP minced garlic (wet)
• Added 1/2 TBSP course ground pepper
• Replaced minced onions with 3/4 of a red onion (about 1/2 cup to make up for the moisture difference)
• Used cubed dill relish for extra chrunchiness (recommend Vlassic as it's cold packed and thus much more crisp)

Thought about using 1 boiled egg chopped.  Might work. Seen it in ham salad before but I didn't really want to waste gas on just one egg.

This will come out with a bolder flavor. For those who like an extra kick try my modifications and let me know what you think.

Awesome, the only thing I changed was I used regular onion as I did not have dried onions, the brown mustard added a great flavor, and I think I will have to try it out in the mushrooms like you suggested as I love stuffed mushrooms

This was really easy! I used cubes of ham and processed all the ingredient together and the texture is the same as the picture it saved steps and was one less bowl to clean up on a busy day of cooking. I only gave it four stars because it is extra oniony (and I love onions), plus it's very salty which could be the ham I used.
