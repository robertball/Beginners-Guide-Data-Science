With the addition of chopped green onion and cocktail sauce I was able to bring this dip from bland to zippy! I also used real crab since my family doesn't care for imitation. Thanks April.

This is a very quick and easy spread, but I found that it was a little bland so I added a little cocktail sauce and wow! - what a difference!  I will be using this again over the holidays.

I was so bummed because this recipe was totally bland.  I even double-checked to make sure I made it correctly.  I used real crab instead of imitation and ended up wasting it...everyone tried one dip and that was it...

Bland and boring, I had to spruce it up with other ingredients.  It gave me a good "base", though.

I first made this appetizer at Thanksgiving and boy did it make a big hit.  I also made it for our Holiday luncheon at work and I can't keep up with printing out the recipe for all the people asking for it.  Thank you April.  Happy Holidays!!

Hubby loves crab, I don't.  We both loved the recipe AFTER adding 1/2 of squeezed lemon, 1 minced garlic clove, and various spices.

Easy to make...however, I did add some dill weed, a bit of celery seed and also some Old Bay Seasoning. These extra ingredients really added some nice flavor!  Will be making again!

This recipe is a good base, but it needed more zip....I added tangy cocktail sauce and Old Bay Seasoning, as well as chopped green onion.

Good dip! Great with potato chips or crackers. (Good base for making clam dip or smoked salmon dip too!)

My little ones won't eat the stuff because they don't like crab, but everyone else gobbled it up! My boyfriend urges me to make this all the time now. Thanks for the nice, easy recipe. :)

I also added the cocktail sauce as others suggested with some chopped onion and a cup of shredded sharp cheese. Easy and delicious.

I did not really care for this. It did'nt have much taste. I added cocktail sauce and some shredded chedder cheese. That seemed to help. The added cheese was an nice touch. All in all I won't be making this again.

it's a little bland, but worth a taste for yourself. I used sea salt black pepper crackers for it

After reading the reviews and tasting as I made this, I added Old Bay seasoning to taste and Scallions! This helped with the bland taste so many reviewed. Will make again thanks for the recipe!
