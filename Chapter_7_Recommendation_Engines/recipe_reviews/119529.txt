The flavor of this cornbread is great, but like another reviewer noted, it came out really soggy, more like a corn casserole.  I baked it for about 20 minutes longer than the recipe suggested, but it never got a true cornbread consistency.  The flavor, however, was excellent.  I will probably try again and see if I can cut back a little on the wet ingredients.

I made a pan of regular corn bread and this Mexican corn bread for a party recently.  Everyone raved about the Mexican version.  I didn't change a thing, and thought the outcome was great.  I'll definitely make again to serve alongside chili and soups.

Thought this was a quite easy recipe, with the perfect amount of zing in it.  I think I realized right after I had mixed the two bowls together what I may have done wrong...Are people not following the directions to a tee?  The recipe says add the liquid mixture to the corn/onion mix 'until moistened'.  Not, just throw it all in.  I made the mistake already, so I cooked mine an extra 10 minutes.  And I also didn't cut it for at least another 30-40 minutes after taking it out.  It was still slightly mushy inside, but edible.  Next time I will try following directions more closely.  But everyone loved it nevertheless!

This was very good.  I couldn't stop eating it.  I don't make it that much because I would weight about 500 pounds!  The kids love it too!  Thanks for the recipe!

I don't know why someone would just give this 2 stars, I made it and it was great. I think the sourcream in the recipe really makes a difference.

I made this recipe the other night with chicken tortilla soup.  It was wonderful.  The only change I made was instead of creamed corn, I used a can of mexicorn.  It was wonderful.

Killer good cornbread.  I will say that I slightly under-baked mine; not by choice, but by mistake, and it was still outrageously good. Next time I will bake it a little longer and let it cool slightly before trying to get it out of the pan.  PS...theres enuf to share with the neighbors!

Yum!  I made these as muffins, and they turned out well.  They had a nice, savory flavor, even without the jalapeno (I didn't have one).  They were a little bit dry, but that might be because I cooked them a little too long.

Great recipe!  I used 3 boxes of corn muffin mix - followed the rest of the recipe exactly, and it came out perfect!  This is a keeper!  Thanks.

This is wonderful!  I made it in muffin form and minus the canned green chilies because I didn't have any.  I can only imagine how much more flavorful it would have been.  I cooked the muffins for 35 minutes but will cook them a little longer next time.  This needs just a sprinkle of salt, but other than that, they are perfect!  I cut the recipe in half and filled each muffin tin full.  It made 12.

directions don't say, but use 2 bowls - one for the cornbread packaged mix and onions, and another for the 'wet' ingredients which you add slowly till right consistency. i used 3 each 6 oz pouches of the cornkit brand mix (i don't like sweet cornbread) and the ratio of wet/dry was perfect - Only change i'd make next time is to ADD SALT and PEPPER. it was moist and delish and went perfect with my homemade chili but it begged for a little salt and pepper! i will definitely make this again!

This was very good. I used plain corn instead of creamed. I also added a spoon full of sugar. I didnt have canned jalapenos so I only added the fresh. With the canned it would have been much better! Also I would even put more cheese next time but thats just because I really like cheese.

This was great! We ate it with King Ranch Chicken Casserole, & it paired nicely! I left the jalepeno pepper out of the recipe, however b/c I am not a fan of spicey. Other than that it was great!

This cornbread is not great. The flavor is good, but the texture isn't. I'm wondering if the recipe should call for 3 packages of mix? There's an awful lot of wet going on for 2. Thanks anyway! :)

Unlike other reviewers I did not find this recipe to come out soggy at all.  It came out very dense for me.  However I did find it to be very bland.  It seems to be missing something in the flavor department.  Sugar maybe.  I cant seem to put my finger on it

The best jalepno cornbread I've ever made. I leave out the onion and green chilies to make it a little more family friendly even my 6yr old granddaughter loves this recipe. I made this once for an office potluck luncheon and I'm not allowed to bring anything else anymore.

halved this recipe and made this with on hand ingredients. used jarred jalapenos and increased them since they seem less hot and i eyeballed the oil.. made it in a cast iron skillet and heated the greased skillet prior to pouring the batter in so it would get a nice crispy brown crust. ill make this again.

A favorite around the house and with guests.  We have this anytime we have BBQ, Mexican, or chili! I feel ripped off whenever I have plain cornbread now.

Sorry to all out there who love this.  I didnt care for it.  I changed a thing or two but not by much and it did not come out very well.  Most likely my fault but I have dabbled with other recipies and they still turn out amazing.

I didn't care too much for this corn bread nor did my family.  I have made other types of mexican style corn bread that have been much better.  But, having said this - - Because I didn't want to throw it away, I decided to use the cornbread as a base for mexican style taco lasagna.  Ya know sort of like using polenta in an Italian lasagna in place of the noodles.  I cooked some ground beef and seasoned it up with onions, peppers, taco seasoning, etc.  I spread this over the cornbread which I halved horizontally, dotted with sour cream that I flavored with cilantro, covered with shredded cheese, enchilada sauce and continued the layers.  It's fantastic.   I've made this a few times already for my home and for potlucks with rave reviews each time. So even though I gave this cornbread 3 stars on its own, when I've used it as I've stated above, it's a keeper.

FABULOUS!! Modified it for some pick-y eaters, no onions and no chilies.  It was still great great. Also used a bunt pan, made it a little fancier for a party. My whole family loved it!

Phenomenal. I just made this to go with a caldo de res recipe that I found on this site. I halved the recipe (I'm only cooking for my fiance and I) and used an 8 inch by 8 inch pan, and it came out amazing!!! I saw that it said "until just moistened" and then was worried because at that stage I had over a cup of wet ingredients left over. I wish I would have known how much left over I was going to have, I would have gotten another corn bread mix... Oh well, I'm happy and can't wait for him to come home for dinner! I also can't stop eating this. It has held together nicely and is very moist without being mushy. YUM!!!

AWESOME corn bread! Everytime there is a potluck at work, I am requested to make this. A co-worker even asked me to make it for her for an event that she was going too. :)

Very good and easy recipe. Comes out perfect everytime. I have always had a problem with recipes in that the bread would take forever to get done in the middle. This one was not like that. Hurrah!! Thank you Sandy Gaulitz !

Very good recipe! Served under Chicken Tortilla Soup. Even better the next day. Was worried about it being to soggy when out of the oven, but after sitting for about 30 to an hour, it was perfect after everything settled. Serve this all the time!

great recipe!!  I made it for dinner and my family loved it.  I thought it was very moist and tasty and definately very rich.  I added a lot more jalapenos than recipe called for, we love spicy food. I will be making it for sure many more times. Thank you!!!!

So very good!  I made the recipe exactly as indicated other than leaving out the jalepenos.  It had plenty good flavor without them.  I will make this again...it would be especially good with chili, spicy soup, etc.  Thanks for sharing!

I halved this recipe to make for my family dinner. It was delicious!   I left out the jalapenos just so my little one would eat it and added pimentos instead.  Everybody loved it - quite moist and dense.

This is my favorite base for cornbread.  The "mushy" problem some people are having is due to the ounces of cornbread mix. This mix calls for 8.5 oz, which is hard to find.  Most packages in Texas are 6 oz each, so I use 3 of those.  I also add a can of drained sweet corn (sometimes Mexi-corn) and an extra 1/2 cup of sour cream.  If you double the recipe for potluck, it fills up 2 disposable lasagna pans.

Very tasty and very popular at the Christmas party I brought it to.  A little dry, hence the four stars, but worth playing around with.

Absolutely delicious! Served tonight with Salsa Chicken Rice Casserole from this website and it was awesome! Yes, you definately need to increase the cook time since mine came out a little soggy in the middle. Next time I will add more peppers and chilies to make it spicier!

This is the tastiest corn bread ever. Tomorrow, we are providing lunch for our employees and I had to make corn bread. Several other managers are making corn bread too. We will have this with chili. I am anticipating the reaction of our associates. Awesome!!!

Can I say..Yummmo!!!..This was so moist and delicious! Since the main dish was a savory one, I wanted this cornbread to be on the sweeter side so I opted out the  green chili and jalapenos.  When I took the cornbread out, I then drizzled some honey butter - I highly recommend that!!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  It's going into my "tried and true" recipe box :)
