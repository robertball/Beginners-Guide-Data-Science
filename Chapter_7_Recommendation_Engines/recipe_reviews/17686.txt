I grated my carrots and substituted coconut for the raisins and added almonds. Very Yummy! A tropical feel...
It was gone quickly.

These were pretty dry and tasleless. I ended up throwing them away ( I made muffins instead of bread). These was no pineapple taste at all. I wonder if the flour measurement is right, seemed like a lot.

Absolutely delicious but even tough I let it cool completely it crumbled when I sliced it. Iâ€™m now left with a bag full of crumbles that may be yummy with ice cream!
