This is really good. I has a nice sweet flavor but not over powering.  I served it with noodles but it really needs to be served mashed potatoes to catch the juices.  Will fix this again.

Delicious and Very Easy to do! Has a great sweet flavor to the sauce. I didn't know if I should peel the apples so I did half with skin and half without. The apple pieces just disintegrated in the sauce and I found the leftover apple skin pieces amongst the shredded pork. I'd skin them when I make this again. And I WILL make this again!

I have made this a couple times now and loved it. I made it with already shredded pork so cooked the apples and onions in olive oil, then added the cooked pork and sauce, warmed them together and served over rice.

I made it in my pressure cooker because I was short on time.  Didnt shred just served chops whole with sauce on both it and rice.  Amazingly good!

Really good. I made it for company and it was a hit. I used three apples. Went great with mashed potatoes. Definitely make again.

I have a stovetop recipe that is similar except called for rosemary which I also added to this. I know it would have been delicious as well without this addition; I just have a thing for rosemary and it complements the pork and apple flavors in my opinion. Otherwise followed this recipe to a T. So good; a real comfort meal! And this pork was more tender than my stovetop rendition.

Easy to make. Delicious. I loved it, my husband liked it, and my son didn't.  My son Doesn't generally like cooked apples, though.  The pork didn't shred, so I just cut it up into small pieces towards the end and we ate it just like that over mashed potatoes.

I followed the recipe exactly this time. The only thing I will change next time is the mustard I use. I will use simple yellow mustard since the Dijon was too strong for our taste.

I wasn't sure what kind of reviews this would get with my family but they all loved it, so 5 stars. Husband said this was the best kind of shredded pork I've made. A very different taste than your typical BBQ, green chile, standard pork. We served it over mashed potatoes and I made brown gravy to go with. Also, I had frozen shredded pork loin so I just made the sauce, added apples & onion and heated up on the stove. Ready in minutes with pre made pork.

I didn't have Apple butter on hand. I improvised with apple sauce, brown sugar,cinnamon and a little clove warmed and thickened with a little corn starch. My Husband really liked it!

I don't care for BBQ sauce  so gave this a try. Was just how I like it, sweet but with sour notes, did add more salt to taste; and used a pork  loin, served as sandwiches on French rolls.
