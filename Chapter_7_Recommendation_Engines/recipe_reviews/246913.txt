I'm sorry but I can't believe a recipe was actually included for something I was making when I was 6 or 7 years old without any recipe.  J put a small amount of sugar in a small bowl and add cinnamon to taste.  I love cinnamon so equal amounts seems about right.  If you really like cinnamon toast make a larger batch of the cinnamon sugar mix and keep it in a shaker.

I've made "Cinny Toast" for 50 years. Never used a recipe for it. Toast, butter up, sprinkle cinnamon, sugar on top until it looks right- good to go! 

Honey instead of white sugar is a taste treat all its own.

I have made a variation of this for years. First, and most importantly, only butter should be spread on the bread that has been lightly toasted. Then sprinkle the cinnamon sugar (1/2 t. Cinnamon mixed with 2 tablespoons of sugar) over the buttered toast. Finally, put the toast on a cookie sheet lined with tin foil and place in a 375 degree oven until the butter melts and the sugar becomes crispy. When made this way, it is definitely a 5 star treat!

I have an old salt shaker filled with cinn and Sgr mixture. Then everyone can put the amount they want on their buttered toast. An easy go to when your in a hurry.

I agree even though I do love cinnamon, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon is too much for just one slice of bread. I wound up making two slices of toast and cutting them into hearts. More than enough cinnamon and sugar for the two slices.

I used a tablespoon of real butter. I really love cinnamon, but 1 teaspoon for just one slice of toast is too excessive for me. I tried it on just a small section, and ended up just mixing in more sugar and then finished sprinkling it on the toast. *Update 2/14/17- I changed my rating from a 3 to a 4. I have heard more about the health benefits of cinnamon, so I have tried to get used to using more. I used about 3/4 tsp on my toast, and I liked it.

An easy, quick, romantic way to make cinnamon toast. The cinnamon to sugar ratio is higher than most, but I love cinnamon. So it works for me.
