These were absolutely fantastic!  My husband and his friend were well on their way to eating every single drumstick, but I managed to snag one for myself, and I'm glad I did!
I am truly a beginning cook, just graduated from boxed macaroni and cheese, and they were so easy to make!  The only problem I had was that a lot of the bread crumb coating came off when I tried turning them over in the oil.  Any suggestions?

This. Was. Incredible. If I could give this more than five stars, I totally would.

I made sure my drumsticks were dry before coating and I made sure to shake the excess coating off before dropping in the oil. I added some pepper for taste and I mixed some chili sauce and honey mustard to go on the side of the drumsticks. These went so fast I had no time to take pictures. Even my kids inhaled their portion and asked for more!

This was really good!  I used thighs instead of drumsticks, but followed the recipe exactly other than that.  Thanks for a unique new way to make fried chicken!

I didn't fry these.  I sprayed them with Pam and baked in the oven for a healthier version.

These were really good. I did expect them to be a little bit spicier and a little less sweet but we still enjoyed them. I did have a hard time getting the breading to stay on the chicken, it kept falling off. I think next time I make this I will use a little less honey mustard and add a little bit of extra spice to it so we get the sweet and spicy. Thanks.

I have made this recipe twice. Was even told by my dh that was great the next day for his lunch. My only problem is that the coating always explodes off the chicken. I think I need to make sure to dry the chicken before putting it in the marinade. Will definitely make again.

Oh no, this one did not work for me.  I followed the instructions exactly with the exception of leaving the chicken in the marinade longer than instructed.  There was no flavor to the chicken at all.  I will not make this again.

I didn't understand how this recipe got such good reviews. I thought it was "okay" but nothing to write home about. I followed the directions to a T.

This was good, but next time I would marinate alot longer. Didn't seem to absorb much of the flavor. Served with a dipping sauce from other posts.

This recipe was a hit! I only had time to marinade it for four hours but I'm sure overnight would have brought more flavor.  The only change I made was dredging the chicken in some flour then back in the marinade then in the panko.   Thanks for sharing!

I was really excited about this, but it was a disappointment.  I really didn't think this was anything to write home about.  It was kind of flavorless.  We didn't even finish the leftovers, which is kind of a rarity around here.

Jackie (and others) you MUST marinate the chicken to give it the flavor - you cannot omit that important step and then complain that it doesn't have flavor! Marinating is HOW the flavors get into your meat and it helps to tenderize.
I thought it was absolutely Fabulous! I used just plain breadcrumbs and it was superb - definitely a family favorite, now.

I left it marinating overnight but the flavor was still a bit off. It was a nice sweet taste though when you could taste it.

Made exactly as in recipes and marinated overnight. Extremely disappointed with the result. Won't be making again.

Very good.  I initially wasn't going to fry the chicken, then decided to go ahead and do it.  I did have a bit of trouble with breading coming off of one breast, but it was fine.  I deglazed the pan with some wine then let it all cook together.  Delicious and easy, but next time I think I'll de-skin the chicken (I used thighs) and bake completely.  Otherwise, absolutely no complaints, but those aren't really complaints--just my preference.  Thanks for the recipe!
