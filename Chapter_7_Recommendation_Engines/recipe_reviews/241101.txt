The recipe was great. I made it paleo friendly to fit within my lifestyle, so I did not add sugar, I used coconut oil for cooking, and I wrapped in lettuce leaves rather than the tortilla. Thanks for sharing, my family loved it!

My husband and I loved these! I began marinating them at lunch time and then cooked them up for dinner. It was very flavorful but quick and easy at the same time. An instant weeknight dinner favorite!

My husband raved about the marinade's flavors.  The only change I will make next time is to marinate overnight. The skirt steak was still kind of chewy.  Excellent!

Great marinade! I had a sirloin steak & didn't know what we wanted to do with it & came across this recipe. I used regular flour tortillas & dried cilantro (bad, I know) because it's what I had on hand. Hubby, who isn't much of a fajita fan, went on and on about how delicious these were. Thanks, Tara, for a definite keeper recipe!

I followed this recipe exactly and it came out amazing! We made steak fajitas, but I can see this being our new marinade for when we grill steaks from now on.

10.21.18 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/241101/sizzlin-fajitas/ ... I used this seasoning on 28oz vegetables.  Yes, I weighed 'em.  'Liked, but not enough of it  - meaning, to clarify, more quantity-wise not more as in it was lacking.  I'd double everything but the cayenne.  'Not incredibly spicy, but if you're feeding anyone sensitive or adding jalapenos or other heat, ya may wanna back off the cayenne.   I cheated n used 1t each of dried cilantro & chili powder; 1/2t each of garlic powder, salt, sugar, paprika; 1/4t cayenne.  I added the lime juice after sauteeing, but it didn't do much.  Per serving would've been better.    I was tempted to used smoked paprika & think I will next time.

This is my go to fajita recipe now, I've used it several times. I use eye fillet and marinade from the morning onward. Last night's meal was a bit salty for some unknown reason, I've made it the same way each time. But I think next time I'll do a half of tablespoon on cooking salt. Still my go to recipe. I usual use Chef John's tortilla recipe to accompany this dish. Just love it!

Loved the recipe. I was not sure at first about the marinade but it worked awesome on the meat. I followed the recipe. A real extra treat was the guacamole with fresh squeezed lime juice topped with sour cream on the Fajita! Will definitely be using this recipe again. Thanks

It was easy but I would recommend using flank steak because the skirt steak was chewy and I marinated it overnight. Marinade was excellent!

No changes.  I might try grilling instead of using iron skillet next time,  not sure how that would work with the marinade.

Was very good.  I used chicken and steak and made it last minute so I only marinated for about 15 minutes. To compensate for no long marination, I used a piercing meat tenderizer on the meat before slicing so the tiny holes could soak up some flavor. Worked very well!

It’s actually 4-1/2 stars because, as others have noted, it’s too salty. I made the marinade exactly as written; it was delicious but could probably have used half the salt. I cooked everything in a wok on my grill (too hot to cook inside) so I can’t evaluate the cooking method. It was very tasty with homemade guacamole and chopped tomatoes on the side.

Great recipe that the whole family enjoyed!  I left out the chili pepper as some don't like it as spicy, and they can add their own heat later.  I also skipped the grinding garlic and kosher salt into paste as I wanted to simplify prep time.  Personal preference, I added a yellow and green pepper to the mix to add color and lots of veggies.  Turned out very flavorful and tender meat.  Will make again!

Delicious Fajitas!  I took the advice of the other reviewers and cut the salt back to only 1 tsp.   I put all the ingredients directly into a 1 gallon ziploc and marinated the beef strips all day in the fridge.  Made a great week night, family pleasing meal.

This is an excellent fajita recipe.  I followed it almost exactly and did add some cumin, onion power and garlic power with a dash of beef bouillon.  We like a lot of kick to our Mexican food and so I added a bit more cayenne pepper as well.  The overall flavor is fantastic and I'll definitely make it again.

This was delicious! I marinated a skirt steak for about 6-8 hours. Instead of cooking on the stove, we grilled it. I cooked onion and green, red and orange pepper on the stove. I do agree with some of the other viewers that it was too salty. I'll cut that in half next time. I only had dried cilantro, would like to try with fresh next time as well.

Followed the recipe -- it was a hit w/ my husband and daughter. I did use 2# of steak (it was packaged that way), and there was just enough marinade with none left over to dispose of.

Very good! We did not have 2 hours so I did 45 minutes at room temp as suggested by another reviewer and I bought "fajita steak" from the butcher instead of skirt steak but  otherwise made the recipe as written.

ETA: apparently I missed adding salt at the end and that was fine.

We loved it! My first time making fajitas at home and it was a hit. I don't cook with much salt so I didn't add any at the end and I would reduce the amount in the marinade. It was delicious, just a personal preference. I added some portobello mushrooms since I had them and they were delicious mixed in.

Way too much salt! Start with 1/4 you can always add more when cooking. 
Out of lime? Try substituting 1/3 the amount with apple cider vinager or other sweet vinager.

Made it  per the recipe, and it was just okay- too bland and not sure it was worth the effort.  I marinated it for 2+ hours, but if I try it again I will marinate it overnight and see if it comes out better.

I've made these many times now. Very delicious!! Even if you just marinate for the 2 hours, the are very delicious. I don't get rid of the extra marinade, I put it all in the pan! My favorite dinner recipe!!

I'm not a huge Mexican fan, but my wife and friends who are loved this recipe.  I used sirloin instead of skirt steak and added a little bit of cumin to the marinade.  This is one of our go-to camping recipes since I can do all the prep ahead of time.

The seasoning was pretty mild but tasty.  I will be using this recipe over and over.
