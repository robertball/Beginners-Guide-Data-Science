We followed Chef John's video with his "sexy cold voice" to make a version of this amazing no knead bread!  It is so good!  Super easy to make.  Put it together at 9:00PM and let it set until 3:00PM following day, after shaping and resting for 2 hours it went into the Oven and then the dinner table by 6:30!

I baked these today and they turned so good, however I used a little less time for spong and dough fermentation that could be the reason the loaf does not have much open crumb. I have sponge going on again and this time instead of 3 hours I am leaving it overnight.

Recipe worked great.  I was concerned about the outcome of  adding the whole grains - sort of seemed like mixing the metaphor- but this makes a lovely hearty loaf with an excellent chewy crust.  Will make this again!

I made the “sponge” starter with 1/4 cup amaranth flour instead of rye and it gave the bread a very earthy, pleasing taste. I also let the sponge sit for a full 24 hours instead of 12 (due to a busy schedule) and I noticed no change in taste or texture.
Instead of a loaf, I made them into sandwich sized loafs. I would reduce the baking time down to maybe 20 mins at the most as the crust for these loafs were too crunchy for my liking. I didn’t spray the tops with water. Not sure if that would have changed anything other than that way it’s looks. 
Good recipe for crunchy bread.

Great recipe, easy to follow, and very little work (no kneading). I was able to speed up the rise time by having a (very) slightly previously warmed oven ready. I placed the dough inside the oven (with the door closed). The tiny amount of extra heat in the closed space made the dough rise significantly faster. Altogether a tasty ciabatta, recommended!

Thanks Chef John for this wonderful recipe my family loves how it turned out my beautiful ciabatta bread. It is so flat cause I exceeded the proofing time  so next time I will make it oval shape.

I made something wrong, looks more like central European bread :) more round and higher. But still tasty. Thanks John!

This was so incredibly easy and delicious!  Loved listening to the video, and so well explained, it was a no-brainer.  Husband said it was the best bread I've made so far :)  Thanks!
