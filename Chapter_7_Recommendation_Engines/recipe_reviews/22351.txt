This recipe was very quick to whip up and the chops had an excellent flavor. Since soy sauce goes a long way, I cut it down by half.  By reducing the amount of soy sauce, the dish was not salty at all.  Very easy and very good.  I will make these again.

We loved this recipe, I will definitely make it again!  I tasted the soy sauce/marmalade mixture before putting it over the chops and it seemed like it needed something more, so I added about a teaspoon of fresh minced garlic--it was delicious!  The pork chops came out very tender, and that is a must for my family to eat them.  Thanks!

Very good, and especially easy.  I love reading other reviewer's hints, so I too added some minced garlic, used less soy sauce and more orange marmalade.  My fiance loved the orange marmalade taste.  Baked for 50 mintues and they were so moist.  Very good recipe.

I normally don't review a recipe unless I've followed it to a T, which I didn't here. But I just had to share the changes I made to this already awesome recipe! I can't stop cooking this, it's so yummy and easy!

What I did:

Used Robertson's Ginger Marmalade, light soy (reduced sodium), added garlic powder, a splash of wine (whatever's handy) and a touch of brown sugar. Before combining in the baking dish I coated the chops in flour and seared them in a pan for 1-2 minutes per side.

OMG sooo good!

Very easy, but I probably won't try it again. Too much soy sauce and not enough taste.

I thought it was great. I used a previous raters advice and used 1/4 of soy instead since everyone said 1/2 cup was too much. My husband liked it....MY 2 1/2 year old liked it** and I thought it was too good to be true because it was so easy to make. Highly recommended*

This was incredibly easy to make. I added more soy sauce and more marmalade and also stuffing on the bottom layer, then the boneless pork chops and then the glaze. My husband went wild over this dish and said it was his favorite yet!! Thanks, this will certainly be a regular and favorite in our house!!

Not overly fancy - but then again - what do you expect with basically only five minutes prep time?  By far, one of the EASIEST dishes I have ever cooked.  I followed the suggestions of others (slightly) and included maybe 2 or 3 tablespoons more orange than is suggested.  I also cooked it in a casserole dish - so that the sauce would cover the entire thickness of the porkchop.  Tender meat, and still juicy - and that was with the cheap cut of meat!!  Definately one I plan to do again in the relatively near future.  All the ingredients cost me $6.

This also works in the frying pan. Brown the chops, then pour the sauce over, cover and simmer for 6-10 minutes. Another really good addition is a little sesame oil and rice vinegar. Thanks for the recipe it was so simple and tasty!

This was OK. I would have given it a higher rating, but I cooked it 60 mins as  it says in the recipe and they came out dry. I wish I would have cooked for 50 mins as another reviewer suggested. I just got busy and didn't check them. Also I didn't expect the sauce to be as thin as water. Will not make again.

Good, easy recipe.  I also used more marmalade than it called for.  I will try the sauce with chicken next time.

I used sugar free orange marmalade, and low sodium soy sauce, added a 1/2 teaspoon of ginger, a little pepper, dried minced orange peel, garlic powder, and onion flakes. It was wonderful and had a more Asian flavor.

I didn't have a lot of time so I did this on the stove.  I browned boneless pork chops on both sides.  Then I added 1/4 cup soy sauce, 1/2 cup marmalade and garlic.  I simmered until the chops were done and served with rice.  They were very good.  No leftovers.  I will make this again.

I have to give this 4 stars only because my husband didn't care for it as much as the rest of us. But I loved it...as well as all 4 children that were here to scarf it down. I followed others advice about using a bit more marmalade and adding some minced garlic. I also decreased the soy a bit so it wouldn't be too salty. My husband said it reminded him of the Orange Chicken from the Chinese place...and THAT is what he didn't like! LOL...odd person. But I think that I will DEFINITELY use this recipe again!! THANKS!!

Just tried this tonight! Used low sodium soy sauce and no sugar added orange marmalade. Had long grain wild rice and corn as side dishes. Super dinner the whole family loved!

Loved the the taste of orange zest from the marmalade. The marmalade does render down to liquid along with the pork juices making the pork on the dryer side. But this does have a good orange flavor. I did as suggested and used 1/4 cup of soy. Just right. With the liquid left in the roasting pan, put it in a pot and make gravy out of it for spooning over the pork chops and mashed potatoes.

there was way too much soy.  Cook time way too long and too hot.  Chops were over done and tough!

Good,people in my family got seconds and even thirds! Added 1 teaspoon of brown sugar as 1/2 cup of marmalade wasn't enough (but didn't have more) & used only 1/3 cup soy sauce. So I would suggest 3/4 or 1 cup marmalade.

I used a heaping half cup of marmalade, and just short of a half cup of reduced-sodium soy sauce, and one large clove of garlic, for 4 chops w/bone. Cooked covered at 350' for 60 minutes and they came out tender and delicious! The sauce is mild, but good, and there was a LOT of leftover sauce. It might have helped having so much though in the tender/moist department, because the chops were practically swimming in sauce in the oven. Thanks for sharing this quick & easy recipe!!

I was hesitant to try this recipe because I am not a big fan of Marmalade, but I needed something quick. What a pleasant suprise! These were not only easy to prepare, but they also tasted great! I did use low sodium soy sauce and an extra spoonful of Marmalade. Thanks for a great recipe Dene', I will use this one again!

These were great, like others, I cut back on the soy sauce. I also added some ground cloves that really brought a great taste to it. Served it with a barley "stuffing", made with barley cooked in chicken broth with craisens and sage added. They went really well together, almost a Thanksgiving dinner.

This has become an extremely easy go-to in my weekly meal rotation. My boyfriend is gluten intolerant, so we use Braggs Liquid Aminos instead of the soy sauce. I have used this successfully on chicken as well as pork, and with different jams and marmelades, but orange and peach work best. I pour all the marinade over the meat as it cooks, then, as the meat rests, the cooked marinade and meat juices go into a small pot. I heat it up, then add a tablespoon of corn starch mixed into cold water, and it thickens up into a lovely sauce to pour over the rice we eat with it. I don't think an hour is necessary to cook it, I do 30 minutes with the foil on, and 15 minutes off.

I really liked this recipe.  I only used 2 tbsp soy sauce, added 2 tbsp dijon mustard, and a good tbsp of ground ginger.  Baked at 375 for 35 minutes, perfect.  Pork chops were not thick cut, just the average size.

Way too much soya sauce. Orangey marmelade is barely noticeable. Soya sauce was salty and strong.

I made this recipe for a Saturday night gaming group.  Everyone thought that it was very good.  I really enjoyed it myself.  Next time I would use more marmalade.

My family was really looking foward to this. I should have know it was to easy to be good. It was lacking in flavor and the so called glaze was more like flavored water. We will nevere do this recipe again.

Didn't have soy sauce or orange marmalade, so I used a ginger sesame marinade and apricot jelly. The chops were a bit dry. Next time I would reduce the juices and pour over chops and perhaps serve them with mashed potatoes.

Followed recipe exactly and found it too dry, even though there was lots of sauce to dip.(I used boneless pork chops)

This is very bad to do to a pork chop, although fast to prepare, it will seem like you gave very little effort!

I used boneless loin of pork chops.  The salt in the soy sause drew all the natural moisture out of the meat- the marmalade/soy sauce topping ended up watery and the meat was so dry it was hard to swallow it.

Really good. Marinate it for some nice flavor. I did it with a pork tenderloin, and cooked it for 60 minutes, and it came out very nice.  For the sauce, throw it over some cornstarch (2 tbsp) and whisk it over heat to thicken it up.

Surprisingly Tasty!  I decided to try this recipe because it only called for two ingredients that I happened to have on hand and I wanted something simple, but different.  Being cautious, I didn't use quite a whole 1/2 cup of soy because I know how strong it is and I didn't have orange, so I used apricot marmalade.  It worked just fine.  I admit, the smell of baking soy was a bit unusual, so the whole time I expected the recipe to be a failure.  It was absolutely delicious!!  Quick, Simple, and Tasty...I am recommending this recipe to everyone.

Very easy to make!
I made the sauce and let the pork chops marinate for a couple days. I read from the Korean BBQ post to add a tiny bit of kiwi to soften meat.  It worked. My husband comments that they were the most tender pork chops he ever had!!!

made as per the recipe - needs a little more marmalade to balance the soy - the addition of the garlic would be good.

So easy!  I used a little more marmalade than soy sauce, to avoid excessive saltiness.  They turned out perfect.  Such an interesting flavor.  Will make again.

I felt the soy sauce called for in this recipe made it too salty for my taste. Instead of using the soy sauce, I used worcestershire sauce.  I liked the flavor better. Try the worcestershire sauce instead and see what you think.  The recipe was good, but now made great with one simple substitution!

These were good.  I used a little extra marmalade, half the soy sauce and added some minced garlic, based on others' reviews.  Next time I think I will marinate the chops for a bit to let the flavor sink in.

I decided to follow some of the advice from other reviewers so I added 1/4 cup marmalade to the recipe since I tend to like things on the sweet side.  I also added 1 teaspoon of minced garlic as well.  When I was mixing the ingredients together I did not think that I would like it since I did not like the smell, but I must say that I was pleasantly surprised.  The pork chops were very tasty and both me and my husband enjoyed them.  I will definitely be making this again.

This certainly was easy, but It didn't taste that great. It is missing something. It doesn't have enough flavor. I was thinking brown sugar or something. I won't be making this again.

Before making this tonight I read some reviews. I love garlic so of course I added some. A little less soy sauce extra marmalade and it was fast & easy to prep. Cooked it for 50 min. Tender, juicy and we all loved it. No left overs so definitely gonna be one of our favorites to make. Love it

I've used this recipe for years and finally decided to give it a long-overdue positive review. I love how simple and tasty this recipe is! Like many other reviewers, I cut down the soy sauce by half. Otherwise this recipe would have been easily a 5-star.

Excellent, came out very tender.  Turned chops over after 30 minutes.  Turned again 10 minutes before end and left top off to brown.  An excellent way to use that overly sweet marmalade that comes with the Christmas orange shipments.

No stars!  Meat was overdone, sauce turned to water and there was too much of it...no flavor, either.  I read a lot of reviews about this recipe before I made it, I am surprised by all of the positive reviews!  Don't say I didn't warn you!

I simmer these chops in a covered skillet on the stove top rather than bake.  They are very good served over rice and a nice change of pace from the grilled chops I usually do.

This was an easy dinner to put in the oven.  We had it with egg noodles.  Next time I might try to thicken the sauce a bit.  It was a bit watery, but the pork was tender and flavorful.

I followed the advice on the reviews to add a tablespoon of coursly chopped garlic, to use worchester sauce instead of soy sauce and to only cook for 50 minutes.

The flavor was great but I should have only cooked them for only 45 minutes because they were a bit tough.

Disappointed, 4 out of 4 in my house took 2 bites & wouldn't eat any more. (my boys love pork chops ??)  Used 1/4 soy & 1/2 marmalade & garlic & no one liked it.  Cooked for 50 min, not dry like other people said, but will not try it again!  Sorry was hopping for a new dish thats easy as this one was.

We love this -- so easy -- with stuff you have on hand.  Wonderful dinner.  Hubby and kids LOVE it!  

I did use half the soy sauce to the marmalade.

I don't like meat and fruit, but Husband does - unfortunately, he didn't care for this at all. Way too sweet. Thanks anyway!

I didn't have orange marmalade so I used apricot instead and used 1/4 c soy sauce & 1 tps minced garlic (as suggested by others). After baking, I thicken the sauce with a little cornstarch and served it with rice. Really liked it. Thanks.

Turned out great.  I too reduced the soy sauce to 1/4 cup.  I also added minced garlic and some fresh mushrooms and only cooked them for 45 minutes.  Will definately make again!

This was okay...I too reduced the amount of soy sauce, but the taste was not as great as I was expecting.

I too read the reviews and decided to reduce the amout of soy sauce to 1/4 cup. I also added 1 clove of coarsly chopped garlic. The recipe was very simple and turned out quite good. I will be keeping this recipe in book. Thx.

This was surprisingly good! My husband hates marmalade and asked if he could have a casedia instead, but when he tried it he liked it and even had seconds. We also had am unexpected guest which I warned we were having an experimental dinner--she liked it, too! I sprinkled some Crazy Mixed-Up Pepper in there just to make the presentation better, but that was all I added. I held back from the 5 stars because it did not give me a huge WOW,  but it is definately a 4 star recipe!

I use chicken breast instead of pork chops. I added some garlic.  I think there's too much soy sauce in this recipe.

I thought the amount of soy sauce and marmalade were balanced.
For someone who never cooks but is trying to learn, this recipe was a good
starter in dealing with pork.  I will definitely try this recipe again because it is 
quick and easy.

This was really good. I had mushrooms that I had planned on sauteing, but I thought I'd just throw them in with the chops since they only had about 15 minutes left to bake. They were great. We had this over rice. My kids liked it too.Oh, I didn't put foil over it, I used a covered casserole.
