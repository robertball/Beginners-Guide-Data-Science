My family enjoys this casserole.  I add a can of mushroom soup to the meat, as well as garlic. I then put all of the mashed potatoes on top of the meat and cover everything with grated cheddar cheese. It is yummy.

This is a great basic recipe. My hubby is a meat and potatoes guy so by changing this a little he loved it. I added a small can of chopped mushrooms, and a 1/2 can of cream of muchroom soup. You can use more of the soup if you like but it may make the consistency thinner. I also used a box(2packages)of the herb and butter flavored instant potatoes instead of boiling the 6 large. I also added the pretty hefty layer of Velveeta after the first layering of the meat and potatoes, and finished the dish with shredded cheddar cheese then baked until the cheese was golden brown. Will definitely make again.

Great recipe!  I also know this one as Shepherd's Pie.  One in our family can't have cheese, so I made a nice serving of gravy from the drippings and spooned plenty over the meat layers.  I used 1 lb. each hamburger and sausage, and added a few cloves garlic, 1 T. sage and a couple shakes of Tony's (creole seasoning) while browning meat.  With these additions, I had no problems with flavor!  There are so many variations you could make of this (adding veggies, soups, sour cream?) - I'll definitely make it again!

Very good and simple recipe.  Hubby loved it!  I did as others suggested and cut back a bit.  I used only 1 1/4 lb. of ground beef and 4 large baked potatoes (peeled and chopped), and it fit perfectly in a 9x13 casserole dish.  I also spiced up the meat, onion, bell pepper mixture with about 1 tsp. of worchestershire sauce and some steak seasoning, as well as sliced baby portabella mushrooms.  I also made garlic mashed potatoes instead of just regular mashed potatoes.  And I also did as other suggested and added cheese.  I made two layers each of beef mixture, mashed potato mixture and then shredded cheddar cheese.

Thanks for the recipe!  Will certainly make again.

This is the second time I have tried this recipe.  The first time didn't turn out to well because I didn't use enough ground beef and cheese, but had too many potatos. ::chuckling::  The second time I used 2 1/2 pounds of ground beef and alot more cheese.  (Like it was suggested, I put a layer of cheese after the first layer of meat and potatos.)  The two layers of cheese is amazing.  Be careful with the green pepper.  The more it is cooked, the more "water" it will produce.  I would suggest using 1/2 the green pepper and dicing it up.  Then again, I'm not the best cook, so I'm sure there are others that know of different thickening agents to use.  

Overall....it's incredibly tasty and will be used many times in the Bachelor's life. :-)

Great recipe, Pat!.....Quick and Easy.  I did add 1 teaspoon chopped garlic to the meat while browning.  I also added 2 eggs to the meat and the potato mixtures...it seemed to make it hold together a little better.
This recipe is supposed to serve 8, but my husband ate 1/2 of it himself!

I really liked this recipe.  I took the advice of some other reviewers and instead of using homemade mashed potatoes, I used 2 pkgs of instant herb & butter potatoes.  They added a little more flavor.  I also added one can of condensed cream of mushroom soup and a little garlic powder to the ground beef, onion, & green bell pepper mixture.  I did not alternate layers either.  I just put the beef mixture on the bottom and spooned all of the potatoes on the top.  I serve this with corn & blueberry muffins.  Very good recipe!

Pretty good, although I added quite a bit of seasoning to the beef because I felt it needed it.  I added garlic powder, basil, paprika, cajun seasoning, lots of pepper and salt.  Good comfort meal though.  I also used cheddar cheese instead of American and added cheese to both layers of potatoes that I used.

Well, you guys should know that it was my first time to make mashed potatos, so I am that beginner who can only boil an egg n' stuff. However, it turned out to be really easy, really tasty, that it made me real proud of myself. This dish tastes so good n' you can't get it wrong!! If anyone knows similar easy recipes, please let me know, thx all!

This was good.  I didn't layer it. I just put the mixture in the pan and then smothered it with the mashed potatoes and topped with cheese.  I also threw in some mushrooms and red bell pepper (didn't have a green one).  Came out pretty good.  Me and my roommate loved it.

We thought that this was an easy and delicious casserole.  I did make a few changes.  I added mushrooms to the hamburger, along with steak sauce and worchestershire to add flavoring.  To the potatoes I added garlic and italian seasoning.  My husband and I both loved the recipe.  This will definitely become a staple in our house.

Very good, easy casserole.  I took the advice of others and added a can of mushrooms and a clove of garlic to the meat mixture.  I also used cheddar cheese (not processed) on top and it added a nice flavor. I used 8 potatoes instead of 6 - my family of 4 had it for dinner 2 nights in a row.

This was a very good recipe.  I have a picky husband, so I had to leave out the onion and pepper.  But I added a layer of corn and it still turned out good.

I make double or triple the amount when I make it.  It freezes wonderfully!  Then I cut it into lunch/dinner size pieces and freeze it.  That way it is a quick dinner for a busy day - or a great lunch that I can just grab out of the freezer on my way to work!  My kids love it too

Great basic recipe.  I did add mixed veggies (to make it feed more) and cream of mushroom soup.  Also added garlic to ground beef while cooking, and sprinkled a spicy seasoning salt on top of the potatoes before baking.  Just for fun I used my cake decorator to make large stars of potatoes on top.  Thanks for sharing!

My family loved this, four picky boys and a husband, they at it all!  I made it for 8 servings and it filled them up, but there were no leftovers, and my kids wanted to take some in a thermos for lunch the next day!  I will probably double the recipe next time, at least double the potatoes or perhaps add frozen peas, corn, etc.

Also, I had read previous reviews saying it didn't have much taste, so I added Shoups Country seasoning to the ground beef while it was browning.

Anything that turns out as well as this did the first time making it deserves at least 4 stars. Very Good! I'd give it 4+ if I could. I didn't have bell pepper so I used a whole poblano and two roasted green chili peppers, diced. Also, next time I make the potatoes for layering, I would add additional butter, salt and pepper to give them a little richness and depth to go with the savory meat mixture. I've added this to my meal rotation and look forward to making it again.

Darn Good!

I made this recipe last night and it was really tasty, great for lunch today too!  I added some veggies but would strongly advise against skimping on the cheese.

My whole family loved this dish!  We will definitely be adding it to our list of favorite easy dinners.  I changed a few things though.  I only used 1 lb of ground beef, and I added a package of beef gravy mix (with water) and 1 can of cream of chicken soup to the beef.  Delicious!

Well, I wasn't too impressed but my boyfriend (a die-hard meat and potatoes fan) loved this! I took DTNYC's advice and added some minced garlic and a can of cream of mushroom to the meat. Also, instead of layering, I just placed the potatoes over the meat and sprinkled cheese overall. It is a very economical meal and it is very hearty and easy to make - I'd make it again for my boyfriend while making myself a salad. Thanks Pat.

This is very similar to Shepherd's Pie, expect that the meat is too dry.  I would add a package of gravy mix next time or the mushroom soup as other reviewers suggested.  I used carrots instead of the green pepper and real cheese instead of processed.  I will try it again, adding gravy next time.

This recipe was good.  I have a very fussy 8 yr old and he really liked it. It did made a lot of food. Next time I might scale it down to serve less. I added some brown gravy to the meat and I used shredded cheese that I mixed in with the potatoes.  I also added a can of creamed corn which made it a little soupy.  Next time I will use regular corn.  I also will leave out the green peppers.  But this is something I will definately make again.

This is a good recipe, but being a cajun i always season meat before I cook it. But, if you drain it you may want to add some more. Add seasoning after draining. I do season before I cook some meats, but you may need to add more. Just a thought.

this was very good, but I added a can of niblets corn to it, came out like a quicky version of what folks around here call shepherd's pie, I had some left over gravy left from pot roast the day before I heated it up and spooned a little over each serving, and with a crusty bread this was a satisfying meal....

I followed the recipe and my family enjoyed it. It was simple to make and we just headed it up for dinner after a long day at the office. 

I will add some spices to give it more flavor but overall its a good recipe.

My kids loved it! A little bland, but my 2 and 4 yr. did not argue. Modified it by using 1pd. hamburger seasoned with chopped onion and garlic powder.Mixed in 1/2 a can mushroom soup and added 1/2c. peas and 1/2c. corn instead of green pepper. Placed meat mixture in casserole and covered top with mashed potatoes and shredded sharp cheese. Big Hit!

This was a good dish, the only thing I changed is I seasoned the beef a bit more by adding garlic salt. In the mashed potatoes I added sauteed leeks in butter and it added a bit more flavor. I might consider adding a little brown gravy to the beef mixture next time to make it a bit more juicy.  It was good though, my kids gobbled it up and the hubby loved it. Thanks.

This was wonderful.  What a great cold weather dish this will be!!!  Comfort food....I took another reviewer's advice and changed the following:  I only used 1 lb of ground beef, and I added a package of brown gravy mix, the water called for on the gravy packet,  and 1 can of cream of 98% fat free chicken soup to the beef. I saved time by making a huge amount of mashed potatoes on another night, and used the leftovers here.  Might use cream of mushroom next time instead of chicken, and I might substitute a little red cooking wine for some of the water.  Another favorite at our house!!! [Made this again 10/13/05--used 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup, HOMESTYLE gravy mix, 1/4 cup red wine, 3/4 cup water.  Liked it even more!!!!!!!]

This is surprisingly good!  Although, I replaced the beef with turkey, the green peppers with fresh mushrooms, and I put Ranch dressing in the mashed potatoes.  I had to bring it in for "goodie" day at the office.  I've never attempted something like this before and I am very pleased with how it turned out and everyone at the office loves it!!  Thank you Pat!

I made this adding some of our favorite spices. I added garlic to the meat and the mashed potatoes. I added a layer of peas, also. You can get very creative with this recipe. Next time I am going to make a thick gravy with the meat - my family can hardly wait to eat this one again!

My husband said this was the bomb! I followed the recipe, except for also adding some crushed garlic, julian carrots, and one can of green beans w/out the juice to the meat mixture. I also added some smashed whole garlic to the potatoes wile they where boiling so I could mash it into them when done. Layered it just like she said and,  topped it all off with shredded mozzarella cheese(it was all I had), and baked. I will make this again, thank you for this dish!

This is great. I have made shepherds pie before, but this version is way better! I made changes also. I used about 1 1/4 lb hamburger, part of it leftover taco meat, and about 6 medium potatoes.I just added about 1/2 can cream of mushroom soup, no vegetables to the hamburger. With the soup and taco meat, that was all that was needed. I also made two layers as others suggested, and that makes a difference. There was more potaoes and cheese than the meat, but delicious! This is great, filling comfort food. Next time I'll add more meat, and cut back a little on the potatoes. Thanks!!

We enjoyed this recipe cooked "as is", but made some modifications and loved it.  We added more onion, about 1/3 cup worstershire sauce and some garlic.  Pepped it up a bit.  I also made instant potatoes using canned milk and layered in a blend of shredded casserole cheese.  It was a hit at work.

This was good,  but I'm not sure it will be one of our favorites. Will probably make again sometime, since it is so easy, and can be made with things kept on hand. I took the advice of other reviewers, and added a can of cream of mushroom soup to the beef, as well as some garlic powder. I used a prepackaged mixture of cheddar and mozzarella instead of the cheese slices. Also ommitted the onions, as my husband doesn't like them.

My kids and I really liked this dish. I did use fresh mashed potatoes but found them a little hard to spread evenly across the meat mixture evenly. Maybe I wasn't using the right untensils. I used shredded cheddar instead of American cheese. I may try a different twist next time by adding cream of mushroom soup or something similar. Overall, I was very pleased...very close to Sheperds Pie

Great little twist on Sheperd's Pie!!  I went greek with mine.  I put two eggs with the potatoes to hold them together; and added Greek Yogurt (or sour cream) and Garlic to the beef.  I also used Mozzerella Cheese.  We love cheese, so I put an extra layer in the middle.  Very Good!!

Good flavor but needed a beef gravy or something to make it interesting.  I'll work with it and we'll definitely have it again.  Thanks!

Tasted good and very simple to make. I was in a bit of a hurry when I made this recipe, so I used instant potatoes. It turned out very well. Next time I think I'll try adding some gravy like some others suggested.

My husband said it tastes better than it looks!  My daughter loved the cheese.  I put cheese on top of the hamburg layers inside too.  It would be good with corn mixed in too.

I actually made this for supper earlier this evening. I used beef stock to make a gravy with to add to the meat. I also added garlic & peas also. I put the meat mixture in the bottom of the dish, layered the cheese on top, then mashed potatoes to cover it all. It came out beautifully. It looked nice, smelled, & tasted great. I had 1 serving, & my husband ate the rest of the entire dish!!! That is a huge compliment to this recipe because he is a very, very picky eater!! Thanks for sharing. I will most definitely make this one again.

This was delicious! I made a few changes (some healthy, some not): 1 - added about 1/2 cup of light cream cheese to my potatoes,  2 - sauteed the onions, green peppers and about a cup of mushrooms in 1 1/2 tsp of coconut oil, 3 - added my sauteed veggies to beef mixture with a can of cream of mushroom soup, 4 - included shredded cheese tomy layers (beef, potatoes, cheese, beef, potatoes, cheese). This was so good, I went back for seconds.Not a great dinner to eat the day after sstarting a diet, but there's always tomorrow!  Thanks for the great recipe.  Will be adding this in to my usual rotation. :)

Wow! This is easy and so tasty my husband  loved it, he likes stuff spicy  so I added habanero and garlic salsa to the meat, I agree with others here, you need to spice up the meat . I also put a layer of cheddar cheese between the meat mixture and the potatoes . I will be making it with chicken and broccoli next time for something different. ?Ohh the possibilities --- Marie

Very filling casserole and open to additions. I made it just as written and it was a nice change from the same type of recipe (shepherds pie) that I add vegetables to.

My family and I loved this dish! I will definitely be making this again. I had no problems with the beef mixture being too dry but I found I had too much of it and ended up freezing the spare as I couldn't fit it all in the dish! Next time I'm going to use less beef but this is definitely a favourite, thanks!

This recipe was very bland and was not very filling. I would consider possibly making it as a side dish with something else, but will use quite a bit more seasoning if I choose to try this one again.

I have made this several times; without reading the reviews, and I have mostly stuck to the orginal recipe. I did use fat free cheese slices (my boyfriend and I are trying to watch our weight). After the first time I did add some salt, pepper, and seasoning to the ground beef mixture. I agree that it is lacking something. Next time I think I will add fat free cream of mushroom soup or fat free sour cream. All in all this is a quick and  easy recipe that can easily be made using instant mashed patatoes, I also may try the garlic mashed patatoes suggested by the other reviewers.

This was "ok", it really needed more spices and it was like something I had made on quite a few occasions-only more bland. If I make this again, I'll use more "zip".

Sorry but I thought this was a bad meal!  We had too many leftovers that saw the trash.  No one liked it.  It was bland (and I did add salt and garlic), borning and not that fast to cook.  Sorry.

My fiance said "excellent" after his first bite.  After that, he said, "It's missing something, though."  We really like spicey food, so we had to add some spice to it, and next time we'll probably add some Creole seasoning in the meat.  I also took some other raters' advice and added mushroom soup to the ground beef...I can see how it would have been dry otherwise.  This was an easy meal to make (as I am NOT a great cook), and I will definately make it again.

My family really enjoyed this recipe, the only negative comment was that my husband thought it was a little dry, might try adding a creamed soup to the mixture next time or tomato sauce.  Very good though.

This was a little more preparation than I wanted, with the chopping of the onion, pepper and potatoes. I used ground turkey instead of beef, and I used also used garlic to season the meat. I added sour cream to the mashed potatoes. Didn't have process cheese so I used grated colby and monterey jack. It turned out pretty good. I will make this again, adding even more seasonings for more flavor, and I will make it ahead of time when my babies are napping so I can just pop it in the oven at dinnertime.

This recipe tasted like a midwest meal, to feed the farm hands. My husband and I both really liked it. I used a thickened brown gravy with the ground beef, added a down home flavor.

If your looking for a low budget, low excitement, low taste meal you have found the mother load. If your looking for something cheap with hamburger just get Hamburger Helper..I recommend the pizza version. (review by Chris Rathje/Certified Working Chef)

This is a great recipe for my meat and potato man!  I added a spoonful of sour cream to the top of each serving that made it perfect for us.  We're keeping this one!

This recipe is awesome. Requires a little time to prepare and to cook, so I wouldn't recommend doing it on a night that you're in a big hurry. I did the prep for it and cooked the meat and potatoes in the morning before work. Then I combined it all into the casserole dish and tossed it in the fridge for when I got home. I added in some minced garlic and salt when I cooked the burger. I also used turkey burger instead of ground beef. Super tasty dish. I might try it with turkey gravy next time like someone else here did.

This was a wonderful recipe!  I used Betty Crocker garlic mashed potatoes on top to save time and added garlic powder and half a can of 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup to the meat.  Will definitely make again.

My family loved this recipe, and it was pretty simple. I tried it with venison instead of beef, added seasoning salt and garlic salt and it turned out beautifully!

This was really good but needed more of a taste so I would add a layer of cheese in the middle of the dish, everyone liked in my family.
Thanks for the recipe

When I made this, I made a larger pan of it, so I added another package of potatoes, I also took other peoples advice and used garlic mashed potatoes. Also When I browned the meat, I put some steak seasoning for more flavor. Overall, My family loved it! Would make again!

I used leftover taco meat, and added a layer of cheese on top of the first layer of potatoes.  My 17-year old picky eater loved it.

I agree with the others that this recipe needs a little something to spice it up... I used garlic mashed potatoes that had been left over and was thrilled with the result.  The HUGE plus for us is that the kids ate it with gusto!

I added worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture.  It still seemed to be missing something.  I used sliced/sandwich cheese and it worked well.

This was a pretty good recipe.  I was making it for my husband's Pakistani family, so I added hot peppers to the beef and garlic to the potatoes.  And I didn't use any milk in the potatoes; they were already pretty liquidy.

I took this to a pot luck dinner and it traveled very well.  I do believe it would have been a little better (for my taste) if I had added a jalapeno pepper or some chilies to it.  Thanks for the recipe.
