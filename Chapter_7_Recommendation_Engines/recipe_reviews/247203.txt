I found letting my dough sit for 30-60 mins made these better. My whole family absolutely loves this simple and easy recipe. Thank you for sharing. - Sioux native approved

I make fry bread all the time. The only thing I do different, is that I use a packet of active yeast, and let the bread rise a few times before I tear it into pieces to fry. It goes good with any meal or holiday feast. We also make thicker pieces, and slice them in half to use for hamburger buns or hotdog buns. You can also stuff them before frying to make fruit pockets, pizza pockets, or just about anything you want. Also, fry bread is great for strawberry shortcake, or you can use the pieces in place of waffles or pancakes, with your favorite fruit and whipped cream or syrup on top. They turn out phenomenal! One of my family's favorite things for fry bread, is a dip that consists of  half honey and half peanut or hazelnut butter, with a little cinnamon mixed in......they're AWESOME!!! And the kids gobble em up!

This recipe is simple and quick, I usually let my fry bread sit cover up for about 2 minutes while I get the oil hot. So it rises a little. It makes the best fry bread, you can add powdered sugar, or add all your taco trimmings on it. My husband is Native American and he loves my fry bread. He says it's not like grandma, but it will do... lol

I really like them ...but I had no idea how flat to roll them ....FYI ...thin as you can get them and put multiple fork holes to avoid bubbles. I added salt after as well.   I think they would be good with herbs for a burger bun or add some sugar for a dessert bread ??

I was a little nervous to try this, but it’s my new favorite food!!! Easiest thing ever to make and so delicious. Not only does it use the minimum ingredients, but didn’t soak up the oil, the dough wasn’t super sticky and the frying process was super easy! The flavor was delicious as a taco shell (tasted like a taco bell chalupa, but better) and would be so versatile as the flavor is good alone but could be used for anything. Will definitely be making these all the time!!!

Made according to recipe just made them smaller since we rolled them in cinnamon sugar for our dessert after Tikka Misala and jasmine rice.  They were very sticky to work with.  Maybe more flour then let them rise a bit as some suggested.  Kinda dense.  Otherwise they were good, very tasty and the plate empty by the end of the evening.  Recipe was easy enough also.

Great recipe! I made this with my sister (ok, she made it and I read the instructions). This is the same bread that Taco Bell uses for their chalupas. This was a very messy endeavor but well worth the effort. If you have leftovers, throw them in the oven for a couple mins because it is much better warm. This recipe is definitely a keeper!! Thanks for providing us with the recipe!!

Omg so good! Brush them with melted garlic butter while still hot and watch everyone go wild.  I usually have to make a double batch if I want to have more than one.

They tasted great, but the taco shells were not crispy.  Maybe I undercooked or overcooked them.

We loved this. I made 3 batches and they were gone in a flash. To speed things up I used a tortilla press to start the fry bread circle. YUM!!
