This was very good. I made it as written, except for doubling the clams. Next time I may useless cream cheese - it overpowered the other flavors and clams are mild. Consider adding more Old Bay. I served it on potato chips and Ritz.

Very good dip. I made it to take to an NFC championship party with friends and they really liked it.  I followed the recipe exactly and thought the clam flavor was perfect.

I made this for the Super Bowl as we always do foods of the cities of the teams but New England is getting real old these days.  We have covered EVERYTHING!!  This was a big hit and a nice surprise since no one ever had it before.

Great recipe, always a hit at parties. I like to use 3 cans of clams, instead of 2.
