The drink is excellent.  Going to use it for a pre-teen New Year's Eve party.  But, I think, the Harry Potter dragon is the Chinese Fireball.  The Firebolt is a brand of Broomstick.

Sounds good. Think I'll make soon. However the name of the dragon Harry faced in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is called the Hungarian Horntail. The Chinese Fireball is the one Viktor Krum faced, and the Firebolt is the broomstick Sirius sent Harry in Prisinor of Azkaban.

Will be making at dinner today; the name is a little messed up. The dragon Harry faced was the Hungarian Horntail. Krum faced the Chinese Fireball. Firebolt is the brand of Harry's broomstick. If you meant to mess up the name like that, very good job! Very creative.
