Hmmmm....veeeeery interesting recipe...My favorite parts of this were the bites with brocolli (reminded me of a broccoli cheddar casserole). Way too many "random" ingredients. We ate it as a pasta dish and not as a casserole  (no crushed Ritz crust). Next time we'd omit the ranch-Hubby felt too creamy and I felt it an unnecessary ingredient. We prinkled shredded cheddar on top. Both of us had 2 helpings. This was pretty much chicken Alfredo with bacon and broccoli. Would give 3 1/2 stars if possible.

I used a different type of noodle since I didn't have shells. This was an easy recipe to follow and I love the flavor. My husband really liked it so I will be making this again for my family

I really enjoyed this it was also great left over. The only thing I won't do next time is the crackers, I didn't find them necessary.

This is a great recipe, I substituted deli chicken for real home- cooked chicken.  My entire family thoroughly enjoyed it.
