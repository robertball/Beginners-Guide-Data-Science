Tastes great!!! had a little problem on the grill though.  Maybe try cooking on the George Foreman Grill.  The shrimp cooked faster than the bacon too so, maybe try microwaving the bacon a little first before wrapping.  otherwise very delicious

I did not have any peppers so they were ommited.  I had some John Boy and Billy's Grillin' Sauce and used it.  This is a wonderful recipe.  My 6 year old loved it.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I made this recipe for the first time last night. It was great! My only recommendation is to either precook the bacon or be sure to cook it on a grill- otherwise the bacon doesn't come out crisp.

This was my fist time cooking with my father-in-law. We made this recipe, along with a tossed salad (with avocadoes), mashed potatoes, and rolls. The shrimp tasted great!

This was ok...I guess I'm more of a health nut and the bacon really didn't add as much as I thought it would.  Just added more fat and calories.  I tried making it with pre-cooked bacon and it really was just ok.  Sorry.

I made this just as the recipe states. To me the bacon overpowered the rest of the dish. I love me some bacon, don't get me wrong. But I wanted a good shrimp taste along with the Chile and it was pretty much all bacon. I barbecued in the dark so it was hard to tell when they were done but in the end they were very moist and meaty. 
I wouldn't make this again without changing up the recipe.

I have made this several times and it is one of the best shrimp recipes I have ever had, that said I also live by the gulf and we eat a lot of shrimp. When you don't have green chilies I use salsa, which I feel taste better. The trick to wrapping you shrimp with bacon is how thin you can get the bacon(buy the cheap thin brands) to be. Take you slice of bacon and lay it on a cutting board. Now take the back of your knife and with a 45 degree angle, use your knife to press and move left to right, and you will notice your bacon becoming longer and thinner. When it is as thin as you can get it, then you can wrap your shrimp from top to bottom to back to the top, then toothpick it through the shrimp and the cheese. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. I use this recipe to show off how awesome bbq shrimp can taste!!!!

Real easy to create and has a great presentation.  I omitted the BBQ sauce as a matter of personal taste.  *HINT* Get the absolute biggest shrimp you can find.  I used jumbo and they still should have been larger!

YUM! If the bacon flavor is too strong-use half of the amount that the recipe calls for and pre-cook and crumble it-then add it to the "Stuffing" Then put them on skewers to keep together- like a shishkabob!

The recipe was good.  However, I found it very difficult to get the cheese in the butterflied slit.  It may be because the shrimp were not big enough (16-20 count).  Very frustrating!  I omitted the diced chili.
