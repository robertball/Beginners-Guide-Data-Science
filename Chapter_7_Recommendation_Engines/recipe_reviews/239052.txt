Made this for dinner tonight and it received rave reviews. I added a few bits of bacon for added texture ( and who doesn't love bacon). My husband even noticed that it was plated like a restaurant dish. The corn cream was delicious! This recipe is a definite keeper!

SUPERB! Watch the video before making because it definitely helps in the preparation. Made it exactly as written! Didn't have the radish sprouts though...not really missed though...I did sprinkle on chopped chives for color and minor flavor. This recipe is stated for 4 servings....sorry, hubby and I ate the whole thing! DELICIOUS! Served with baby spinach salad using pomegranate arils and chipotle cheese cubes....YUMMY:)

PS...because your are using a super hot skillet to sear the scallops...a lot of smoke is generated and at least for me...my smoke detector was going off multiple times!

Thank you! I finally learned from this recipe how to properly sear scallops. Adding the oil to the scallops and heating the pan did the trick!

This was delicious and looked so elegant on the plate.I
I used unsalted butter and recommend being very sparing on the salt used.  I had to substitute baby red peppers and would use less broth in the Corn Cream, can be thickened with a little cornstarch if necessary. I recommend 4 large scallops per person.

My husband and I have a “date night” every Friday night after we put the kids down. We cook something special. I’ve made this 5 times. It’s definitely our favorite dish in our date night rotation. It’s easy to make, beautiful to look at, and gourmet quality. Seriously better than any scallops I’ve had at fancy restaurants.

Love this recipe, I've made it twice now and I feel like a culinary rock star each time...chef John has made me a way better cook than I have any business being. I made this with a bag of frozen corn because fresh is out of season and it was delicious.

Made this ....and it was fabulous.  
I used an olive wood smoked olive oil rather than canola, to add a little smoke flavor,  and doubled the recipe.   Also, couldn’t find Fresno Chile’s, so used Serrano, which worked fine.
The corn cream was SO good, and simple to make. 
My family said it’s a definite repeat recipe.

This is a simple yet beautiful dish. I used a bag of frozen sweet yellow corn as that’s what I had on hand. I also used beef bone broth (the korean style that’s milky white) instead of chicken broth because again that’s what I had on hand with the oil from the soup so I didn’t use butter. I wasn’t sure of measurements so I put enough liquid to cover the corn with about 1/4” above it then followed the instructions. I had a lot of scallops and needed to cook them in batches. I still finished with red bell peppers (because that’s the only ones I had on hand) and made the glaze for them. I didn’t add butter to them since we have a dairy allergy in the family. I don’t feel like it needed it, though I’m sure it would’ve been just a hair more luxurious. This will definitely be in the rotation! Easy main dish or even an appetizer in a small dinner party with 1 scallop per person.

I sweated shallots in the butter and added sherry cooking wine. The reduced, then followed the method and the ingredients. I used tobasco for heat. I thickened it with a slurry plus I roasted corn in the oven added it to the final product. Let it sit “ hot hold”. Then I served. It turned out great.

Felt like a pro!  this was relatively easy to make, happened to have all of the ingredients (other than the radish roots-no biggie) and with corn fresh from the farm and fresh scallops, it was a HUGE hit!  I didn't even strain the corn cream, just used the whole lot and it was delicious.

Absolutely outstanding recipe' worthy of fancy restaurant meal! Simple to make following directions in video, especially omitting the straining of the corn and using an immersion blender, making a bit easier and just as tasty.

As always with Chef John recipes, they  always over deliver! The corn cream is truly "luxurious". The scallops come out perfectly. I substituted red bell pepper for color and presentation and it works well.

Absolutely fantastic. Only one substitution - used thinly sliced red bell instead of red Fresno pepper (all I had on hand). What an amazingly satisfying dish, particularly for a light summer dinner or appetizer. Thanks Chef John!

This was delicious, next time I might reduce the amount of broth in the corn as it was fairly runny even after reducing it and pureeing the lot, but the scallops themselves were perfect and it all tasted very good. The addition of the pepper was very nice, and it added a splash of color.  I'll double that the next time, as I wished I didn't have to share the peppers with my dinner companion.
I heated my cast iron pan in a 350 degree oven while I walked the dogs and prepped the other ingredients, so it was nice and sizzling hot when I put the scallops in.

This has become one of our "go to" entertaining dishes with fresh local scallops and peppers from the garden. One variation we enjoy is to add a base of polenta under the corn cream for a one dish meal.
