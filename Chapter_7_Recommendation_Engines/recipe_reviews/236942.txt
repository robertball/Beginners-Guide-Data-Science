Delicious! I halved the recipe and omitted the chicken b/c it was part of our Friday Lenten dinner (no meat), but followed the recipe otherwise. This was so simple to make and had so much flavor that we really didn't even miss the chicken, but I will add it to try next time. My mac and cheese hating son gobbled this up, but I knew he would b/c he LOVES anything 'buffalo'. This is a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Great if you love anything buffalo. The only thing I changed was the chicken. 3 boneless skinless chicken breast rubbed with a chicken season rub. Cooked until almost done. Then pulled the chicken and added it to the sauce mixture.

Haven't tried this yet, but it sounds good. You did fail to mention what to do with the macaroni. Do you mix it with the cheese mixture or put it in the pan and pour the cheese mixture over it before you bake it?

This recipe is amazing.  Made it per recipe the first time.  The next time I made it I was eating gluten free so used rice macaroni and also made my own hot sauce  (1/2 c tapatio, 1/2 c butter , 1/2 c olive oil).  I also added some celery.  The gluten free version is just as good as the original.  Thank you so much for this awesome recipe!!

This recipe was good! My daughter has been asking for Macaroni and cheese so I figured why not try this recipe it has her two favorite foods buffalo chicken and mac an cheese lol So it was a nice surprise for her for dinner this evening on her first day back to school! She liked it Alot! I thought it was ok I have zero complaints. My only changes were I did omit the breadcrumbs on top and I cubed up chicken breast. I will Probably make this again for my daughter if she requests it again!

I used canned chicken breast instead and it was still really good.  I will use "real" chicken next time.  I did not add the bread crumbs so I used about 1/2 the butter.  I suggest to follow directions and use a 9x13 pan (I used a casserole) because the more of that lightly browned cheese, the better.  My husband sprinkled bleu cheese crumbs on his portion and loved it, with our without.  This would be a good addition to a Super Bowl Sunday buffet.  I would include the traditional celery sticks too because this is so rich. DELICIOUS!

I used a package of ground turkey, low fat condensed milk, low fat sour cream and no butter on the crumbs. Other than that, I kept the recipe the same and it was AWESOME!! it was easy to put together and it was delicious!

I found out that Frank's makes a ranch dip packet. I used it and left out the sauce. you can then adjust omit the sauce or add for a stronger taste. another can or half can of milk would make it creamier and make up for the loss of the sauce. personally leaving it put did wonderfully.

This recipe was great and easy to make! The only thing I changed was the chicken. I used chicken breast instead of rotisserie chicken. I cut the chicken breast up into cubes and sautéed it in a skillet with my own spices. Everything else in the recipe I followed exactly.

Made it per the recipe. It has a medium heat that I liked. My sons kicked in more heat to their liking!. My wife thought a little to spicy.  It is great comfort food for Buffalo sauce lovers.  Be sure to not overcook chicken, maybe just undercooked best so is not dry after baking. Try to pair with a nice cool salad like Blue Cheese wedge and fresh tomatoes.

This was DELICIOUS! First, it makes a VERY large amount of food. I wish I had split it into two servings and frozen the other half for later. I stuck to the recipe pretty closely. Second, I think a key is to use Frank’s Red Hot WING sauce, not the original Frank’s Red Hot. Original would be too vinegary. You need the “wing sauce” to tame the flavor a bit. The only addition I made was to add crumbled blue cheese in the mix as well as on top and omitted the panko bread crumbs.

Made for the first time today, and OMG! Yummy!! I did halve the buffalo sauce, but I kind of wished I hadn't - it could have used more heat. But, of course, this is going to be a matter of personal taste. I do wonder if the people who thought it was too hot were using Frank's Red Hot and not the buffalo sauce, because the buffalo sauce is quite a bit milder. I like ranch with my wings rather than blue cheese, so that was perfect for me. Next time I think I will also use some salt and pepper, just for flavor. But it's definitely rich and creamy and once you get the heat the way you like it, you will love it!!

It was amazing!!!  Ended up using a onion soup mix instead of ranch because I didn’t know I was out. Lol!  Broiled it for a bit at the end to crisp up the breadcrumbs.  So easy and delicious!!!  Kids devoured it and will definitely be on my menu again!

I followed the recipe exactly & didn't care for it. Super buffalo-y, but with the sour cream & cream cheese it was too rich. Good idea, just didn't come out right. An hoping it heats up better since there's SO much left. We definitely will not make this again :-(

It was very good and my husband and company liked it,  Thank goodness everyone likes spicy food... I thought it was really spicy and next time will tone down the buffalo sauce.  I think it needs a little more "wet" ingredients too, may try using actual ranch dressing instead of the powder.  I warmed it up for dinner a couple nights later and added ranch dressing mixed in before I microwaved it, was a great second night fast dinner!

Easy Peasy. My son dislikes traditional  macaroni and cheese but loves this dish because of the wing sauce addition. Next time will use a less intense buffalo wing sauce. ......Tum Ta Tum Tum Tums

Came out great- just used a rotisserie chicken and added a little mozzarella cheese to the mix, only changes.

family loved it.  I am not a spicy person and enjoyed it in small quantities.  Makes a hefty 9x13 casserole.  Served with hotdogs and salad.  Would make this again

Be very careful what kind of buffalo sauce you use!!! The one I used made this far too salty and basically inedible.

I made a gluten free version and used reduced fat cream cheese, light sour cream, and only half the hot sauce.    It was really good and my family  said the recipe is a keeper.  It fills much more than a 9 x 13 dish.

Substituted cheese tortellini for elbow macaroni and added bacon. It tastes exactly like the dish at one of our favorite restaurants! Excellent!

Great recipe but its very filling, so I would recommend pairing it with a lighter dish like salad.

I made this for my 19-year old son, who is a HUGE fan of buffalo chicken wings. He LOVED it! It was a bit too spicy for me, but I did enjoy it.  I followed the recipe exactly. The mac has a sharp taste from the cream cheese, but I didn't mind that too much. I would have loved to put in some blue cheese crumbles, but my son hates blue cheese with a passion, so I refrained.

This is a really good creamy dish that is just like the dip, if you've ever made that, taste-wise. I didn't add all of the hot sauce which is a good thing because that would have been way too hot for us. I really liked the topping too. It makes up a nice big batch. I used canned chicken which is what we use when we make the dip.

This was very good. Made exactly as written, with the exception of adding 1/2 onion, a few stalks of celery, and a little garlic...sauteed. We LOVE spicy stuff and this was no exception, but I do wonder if it would be too spicy for some. Oh well, that just means more for us. ;)

We didn't like it.  It was not creamy it was dry and there wasn't much flavor.  We will search for a better recipe.

This recipe is a staple at our house now - I make it at least once a month!


However, I have never used a full bottle of buffalo sauce - I use anywhere from 1/2 to 3/4 (depending on who my guests are and what level of spicy they like). I also cook chicken breasts (2-3 depending on size) instead of using a rotisserie chicken. Also - and this is likely personal preference - I much prefer rotini to elbow macaroni. More nooks and crannies for chicken shreds and sauce to cling to!


For those making this recipe: Be extra sure your cream cheese is softened before mixing it in! I was pretty careless the first couple of times I made this, and it resulted in a not-very-smooth sauce with random blobs of cream cheese.

I omitted the noodles and bread crumbs and used a few cups of broccoli and asparagus instead, with thin sliced chicken breasts I already had grilled with garlic salt.  I definitely needed to adjust the sauce measurements down.  Without noodles and bread crumbs it's better to half everything for the sauce recipe and omit the milk. It's really delicious and I couldn't stop eating it straight out of the oven!  I'll play around with the recipe again, but this was a good start for me for using up some cooked chicken.

It was good but just a bit rich for us. Perhaps less of the cream cheese and sour cream mixture next time.

Made this for my husband and son. I didn't eat it because I am on a low carb diet. The sauce tasted good but my son who loves anything "buffalo" said it wasn't hot enough. Not enough flavor for him.  He said it was just ok. My husband didn't care for it at all. We won't be making this again. Oh and my son wasn't fond of the bread crumbs. Maybe a little less and he would have liked it more.
