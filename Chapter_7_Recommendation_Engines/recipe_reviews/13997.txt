These are a godsend for a vegetarian! I used canned - would certainly NOT recommend all the bread. Used breadcrumbs and ran out at 1-1/4 cups. Thank god, next time I'll use less than that. Very good, just too "stuffingish". Otherwise I great idea. Also, 1/8 tsp thyme was more than enough for me. thanks

I used canned garbanzo beans, added fresh parsley, and used a food processor instead of a blender.

These patties would be very good without so much thyme. If you don't like the taste of thyme, please don't put a tablespoon in the recipe.  I won't add more than a tsp. next time.

An excellent addition-and maybe staple-to my anti-inflammatory diet. Legumes are king and this is certainly a great base recipe for me. The first time I used 1 1/4 cups of panko bread crumbs and that was perfect. This time I used the same amount but of fine bread crumbs-don't do it! Definitely stick with bread cubes or the coarser panko bread crumbs. They're awful with fine bread crumbs. I wonder if adding some cayenne or turmeric would be good for some added spice? I think garlic might be good as well. Thanks!

Very good! I make bean patties all the time. They are good fast food.  I slip 2 of 'em in a baggie and pop 'em in my purse. They are great right after the gym. 
I used 1 tsp fresh thyme, 1 1/4 cups plain bread crumbs, 1 Tbsp pepper , 1/2 Tbsp salt,  1/2 tsp garlic powder, & 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese. Bake on oiled cookie sheet at 350F for 20 min, flip and bake 20 minutes more. To me the consistency was correct. The mixture was rather wet and stuck to my hands while making the patties. Also, they did not "over-dry" out when baked.
When I make my own, I'll use 1 can beans, and some shredded (food processor) vegetable like zucchini, beets, mushrooms, onions. Add seasonings, 1 egg, and 1 cup or so of bread crumbs, then bake 350F, 20 minutes each side. 
It's the seasonings that have been messin' me up. 
This recipe is good like it is but it's also a good base for me to tweak and mess with. 
Also try Carrot Burger by Phyllis Moody on this site.

Wow!   These taste delicious!  They tastle like meatloaf to me and I love meatloaf!  I put ketchup with mine.  I think if you want to add the same types of ingredients that meatloaf has you can have a great creation- maybe add green peppers or sharp chedder cheese!

These were very easy to prepare and tasted great.  I used italian seasoning instead of just thyme.  I also froze the majority of the recipe and that has been very nice to have on hand.  I wwould definitely recommend this recipe.

Disappointing recipe give the amount of effort I put in.  It was a bit pasty.  Serve like burger patties with your favorit burger toppings.  I used red pepper walnut past.  I froze uncooked patties for a rainy day.

These were very good.  I did not have bread cubes and used uncooked rolled oats, which works fine for me in meatloaf.  The mixture was too dry, though, so I added two more eggs, but maybe another liquid would have worked as well.  The patties were soft but held together well.  I agree with others that the thyme taste is overwhelming; I will greatly reduce it next time.  I will definitely make these again.  Thank you!

This is a great recipe which I modified a bit.  Another reviewer suggested using 1 1/4 cup panko bread crumbs, which i did.  i am not a fan of regular bread crumbs as i find they have a strange stuffing-like flavor.  I also used canned garbanzo beans.  I did not have thyme, so added a mix of garlic, oregano and chili powder instead.  I was unsure if the vegetable oil was supposed to be used in the mix, so i threw it in also.  I think this made it a bit easier to form into patties.  I used my vitamix blender, which was a bit hard to use, as the mix was rather dry.  I ended up hand mixing it a little more afterwards.  I recommend using maybe a smaller food processor.  The patties cooked pretty quickly.  My husband loved it so much, he said it tasted like chicken!  I served the patties on a bed of lettuce, with some tomato slices and topped with relish and ketchup.  Loved this and plan on making some again soon!

These were pretty good I'll attempt them again sometime. I had to use oregano instead of thyme and they'd probably taste better with the real ingredients. They fried up and resembled a tuna patty to me. Next time I might try some rice or oat meal in place of some of the bread crums though.

These were delicious. I used a can of garbonzo beans and sauteed onion and garlic in butter and added them to the mix. I left out the thyme and  used 1 1/4 cups  italian seasoned bread crumbs. My picky kids even loved them!

Pretty good, though I modified the recipe. I used canned garbanzo beans and 1/2 cup of bread crumbs. The patty was still bland-tasting, despite all the thyme, so I added a tablespoon of cumin. That made all the difference.

very good. I followed the recipe exactly except, I used Italian seasoning in place of thyme, since tyhme is not a favorite flavor, of my families. I did find it a bit dry, but tastey. I will make again and cut back a little on the bread crumbs. now if I could just find a low cal sauce this would be heaven. thank you.

I left a slight visible "grit" while processing. I doubled the recipe, and having only enough fine dry crumbs for the original, I processed a wide piece of whole wheat bread to make up the difference. I finely processed one celery stalk and stirred it in. Four adults and four children ages 4-11 liked these. I will be cooking up dried garbanzos to make these again and stock my freezer. Be sure to rinse canned garbanzos in all recipes, if using, to avoid an off taste. I would like to do these as sticks to dip in marinara sauce!

I made this in my blender as stated, and had to add water because my blender would not make the garbanzo beans into a paste.  However, the flavors were spot on & my "Garbanzo Bean Mounds" were delicious.  I even used some of it on the nopal tacos I made earlier today.

I will try this recipe again after I go out & purchase a food processor!

HELP!!!!  I really wanted to try this, but I must have done something wrong.  The patties turned out extremely dry and would not stay together when frying them.  The receipe says the garbanzo beans should make a paste in the blender, but mine only turned into dry crumbs.

I don't think mine came out quite like it was supposed to - not like what people have been saying is similar to a veggie burger - but was still very good.  My attempt seemed to make an absolute ton (I made 8 patties and still had over half a bowl left), but I cut back on the thyme as others said it was too much.  My husband said it was a little bland, so I'm planning to spice up the remaining half bowl to have with dinner tomorrow.  For us it's a nice side dish.

A bit dry. Perhaps adding some more flavor would be helpful. Healthy alternative to burgers.

I made this with 3 eggs rather than 2. I  followed other reviewers recommendations and used 1 1/4 C panko bread crumbs. I skipped all the oil and  sprayed the patties with cooking spray and baked them at 375F for about 15 minutes, flipped them and baked them for another 10 minutes.  I will definitely make this again.

These are really good. I typically half the recipe using Italian bread crumbs and 1 can garbanzo beans, reserving liquid to use if needed for consistency. My husband really likes these and will break them up to add with his vegetables.

These are quick, easy, and tasty. I added about 1/2 cup grated carrots and some fresh parsley for a nutritional boost. Also, I just used about 2 scant cups bread crumbs rather than cubes. This is a handy, flexible recipe - definitely a keeper!

These were very good.  However, when I read over the recipe the first time I thought that a whole tablespoon of thyme was a lot.  I put 1 1/4 tsp of thyme and that was plenty!  I also added a little garlic.  Very tasty!
