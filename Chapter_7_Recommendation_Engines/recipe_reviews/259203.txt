Other than adding an additional cup of sliced apples I made this as written. If I make this again I would bake it in a casserole dish that is taller and not as wide, I like mine a little thicker.  Thanks for sharing.
This was made for the Allstar challenge: #Facelessnomore

I tossed apples in lemon juice and some Cinnamon, nutmeg. I used nutty peanut butter. I really liked it so did my friends. I want to experiment with more spices like ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon. So tasty and without all that butter and flour, just tasty and comforting, no guilt to indulge. Thanks!
