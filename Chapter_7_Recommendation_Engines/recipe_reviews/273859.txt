1.25.20 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/273859/lemon-cheesecake-mousse/ ... Okay, Friends, I kinda made this. I pretty much did. Keep reading, I expect this to be helpful.  ;)  I had old sweetened condensed milk to use. It had darkened a bit & lost its smooth, thick texture & gotten like melted mozzarella. 'Didn't let that stop me.  :D  I made a different recipe for pie - with two blocks of cream cheese, without heavy cream. It still had ribbons when cutting; didn't firm up. 'Scooped it from the pie crust & folded in 8oz, 3c, Cool Whip; then, folded in the crust. Good, but - here's the lesson - 3c Cool Whip was too much - too much as in too light & too much for the amount of crust - so I'm pretty sure 2c heavy cream, 4c whipped, would be too much. I'm thinking ingredient should read "2 cups whipped cream".  As I did, 3 cups, whipped, I had two pies' worth of filling & one crust.  Does that make sense to anyone?  Anyone?!  :o  :)  ... 1c heavy = 2c whipped.

I wish I had just whipped the cream and folded it into the mixture.  I think it would have had more volume.  I like a prominent lemon flavor so I added the lemon zest so it had good lemon flavor.

I had a prepared crumb crust so I used it as a cheese cake pie filling.  I needed only half the recipe for an 8" pie.  It was delicious!

I did not make the graham cracker crust, but served as a mousse.  It was delicious!

I made only  a 1/2 batch, and still wound up with 8 servings.  Next time I will add lemon zest to the mousse, but everyone liked this one.
