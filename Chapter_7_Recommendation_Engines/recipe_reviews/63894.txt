I made this recipe last night for dinner, and simply cannot say enough about it!  My husband and I absolutely LOVED it and cannot wait to have it again!!  Just a tip for anyone else who is clueless in the kitchen like me: this recipe doesn't work so well with Minute Rice.  If you are going to use Minute Rice, my suggestion is to substitute water with coconut milk and cook as directed on the box from there.  That's what I ended up doing since I didn't have "regular" rice in the house.  Turned out perfect!!!

WOW, this was excellent!  I tried using the suggestion of another review and cooked the rice in coconut milk only (no water).  That was a flop!  The coconut milk apparently doesn't have enough liquid to absorb into the rice properly.  I ended up adding water later, and it still turned out good.  I think the rice could have used a little chopped green onion in it too.  I will definitely do that next time (and there will be a next time soon!).  The chicken was excellent too.  I ended up adding more Jerk seasoning to it and it turned out perfect!  I cooked it on a slotted non-stick pan on the stove, rather than messing with the grill.  Same results and so much easier on the cook!  :)

My husband and I loved this! My husband is from the Caribbean and was a little skeptical, but both the chicken and rice were delicious.  And hubby requested that from now on, I always cook rice in coconut milk!  Thanks!

The chicken was SO freakin good! I had people come over (cause I can't cook for anything) and they loved it too. The rice was different. Not bad, just different. But the chicken was AWESOME! Since we're all in college, this is the type of stuff we're looking for. CHEAP AND GOOD!

I have tried many recipes from this website and each one has been wonderful, except this one. The rice is the reason I tried this recipe, but it ended up being nothing special. The chicken bouillon over powers the coconut taste, and the orange rind adds nothing to the flavor.

This dish is DELICIOUS and easy! It quickly became a favorite at my house. As a side note, I generally add a bit more of the carribean seasonings than is called for, so don't be afraid to season to taste.
Also, the most recent time that I prepared this I also prepared a sort of fruit salsa to add to the chicken. I used pineapple, a bit of mango, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a few other items until I liked the way it tasted. I highly recommend creating your own fruit salsa to add to this meal!

this is awesome, I make it exactly except, I could not find jerk seasiong blend but I found  jerk sauce, so I just marinated the bullion cube and sauce at room temp for about 15 minutes. the rice is terrific a real keeper.
