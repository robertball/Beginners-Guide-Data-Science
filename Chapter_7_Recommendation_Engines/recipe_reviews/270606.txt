"This family friendly shepherd's pie uses ground beef (instead of the traditional lamb)", so it's actually a Cottage Pie and NOT a Shepherd's Pie. Shepherd's Pie can only be made with Lamb.

This was very easy to prepare, and was so lovely you'd think it involved a lot more effort than it actually did. I used ground lamb instead of beef and drained the fat after browning. Next time I may use a little less broth, or maybe serve it with crusty bread for dipping!

I followed the instructions with the exception of using sweet potatoes because that's what I had in the house.  While the potatoes turned out lovely, I think this might not be the best way to make a shepherd's pie. The broth diluted all those delicious flavors and seasonings in the meat and veggies. Also, even though I drained it, it was far too watery at the end.

I used beef broth concentrated soup (1 c) and instant potatoes on top. The wife liked it so it must have been good.

It was delicious, I wanted to stick it under the broiler for a few minutes to set the potatoes more but it was very tasty.

This was eh. Not a ton of flavor and WAY TOO MUCH LIQUID even after I strained most of the liquid out before I topped it with the mashed potatoes and put it in to broil....donâ€™t bother with this.
