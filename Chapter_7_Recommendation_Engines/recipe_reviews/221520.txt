This recipe had a nice mild flavor and the sauce was good over the chicken and the rice that I served with it.  I followed the recipe, except used half and half instead of the heavy whipping cream.  Next time (and there will be a next time) I will probably add some seasoned salt, extra pepper, and minced garlic.  Thanks Stephanie for a really good recipe.

Wow, this was fantastic, and a huge hit with my family!  I used 14 ounces of chicken tenders, and 8 ounces of slice mushrooms (cooked them in step 3 with the marsala and broth).  I also subbed 1/2 and 1/2 for the cream, and dijon for the ground mustard, since that's what I had on hand.  It was similar to chicken dishes with cream of mushroom soup, but probably much healthier/natural, and just as easy to make.  Thank you!

I admit I started with the basics of this recipe but based on the previous reviews made a few changes.  First, I was making this dish for two so some adjustments were due to that.  My approach: Used 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I pounded them to about 1/4" thickness. Before I dredged them in flour, I seasoned the flour with salt, black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder and paprika. I didn't measure but seasoned until the flour had a good flavor.  I fried the chicken in 1T olive oil and 1T unsalted butter.  As another reviewer did, I removed the chicken and then I added 1/2 medium diced onion, 2 cloves minced garlic to the remaining oil and butter - I added a 1tsp of olive oil.  Cook onion and garlic for 2-3 minutes then added 5 oz sliced mushrooms. Cook for another 2-3 minutes and then added 2/3 cup of marsala and 2/3 cup chicken stock.  Let it simmer for about 5 minutes then I added back the chicken and let it simmer another 10 minutes, then I slowly added 1/2 cup of cream with 1/2 tsp ground mustard.  After a few minutes, taste the sauce - I added about 1/4 tsp salt and a 1T marsala.  Let the sauce reduce by 1/3 or so.  I served over whole wheat penne.   This approach came out very well.

I love Chicken Marsala when I go out to eat, but have never made it myself.  I'm a pretty decent cook.  I followed these directions to the T (with the only exception, I only had 1/2 and 1/2 on hand- no heavy cream).  It didn't meet my expectations.  It was ok, my family didn't complain, but didn't finish their plate either.  I can't put my finger on what is missing, I will probably try other recipes and "play" with it, until I find that restuarant taste!

I made this tonight because we just wanted something different. I made a few changes based on what we had available in the house - Pino grigio rather than Marsala wine and crushed garlic in place of ground mustard. I added mushrooms and served with fettuccine and it was delicious, just the change of pace we were looking for. I think maybe those reviewers who said they used half and half and didn't love the sauce might want to try again with heavy cream. The wine and stock in the recipe are so light that you really won't be able to get a rich sauce consistency or flavor with half and half. Just a thought! Thank-you for the yummy dinner!

1 lb of white mushrooms was a nice addition.  As soon as sauce is done, add the al dente cooked pasta so it can soak up as much sauce as possible for just a minute.  I served it with steamed broccoli.

This recipe was very delicious and somewhat easy to make. I followed the recipe up until it was time to add the wine. I cook the chicken as directed, did that in batches. Then I put all the cooked chicken on a plate and followed the wine, broth, cream mix in the order listed on the recipe. Once the sauce was mix and creamy, I put the chicken back into the skillet. Very rich, but so worth it.

We loved it. I followed the recipe exactly. If I had mushrooms on hand they would've went in. I served it with egg noodles. Though there were leftovers, they were gone the next day. Nice, easy, delicious meal.

Love it although I didn't flour the chicken which I used boneless skinless thighs pounded. I also added mushrooms after the Marsala and stock were added. Sauteed them and when ready I added the cream/ ground 
mustard and the chicken back to simmer as directed. Thickened the sauce with flour mixed with Marsala.  Salted a little more to taste after finish. Wow! And I am picky. Don't water down. Use the stated ingredients. You can go to the gym later!!! YUM!!!

It was ok.  Not quite as "marsala-y" as I would have liked, but it was easy and tasty.  I did add mushrooms at the wine/broth stage.  I used the heavy cream.  The sauce would not thicken, though, so I had to add cornstarch at the end, and it thickened quickly and nice after that.

I made this for dinner tonight—served it with thin spaghetti. It was a little sweet, but was really good and very easy to make.  I took the suggestion of another reviewer and briefly added the chicken back to the skillet after adding the wine and cream. Next time, I will also add the spaghetti to it just before the sauce finishes cooking. I’m also going to add a little more black pepper.

This is my teenage daughter's favorite now. I have made it at least 3 times. FOR CORN'S SAKE PEOPLE: do not substitute half and half (or anything else) for the Heavy Cream! The cream gives it the dreamy, rich texture. 5 stars all the way for this household. I usually double the sauce ingredients so we have plenty left over to drizzle over rice.

I’ve made this twice now and both times were great. I followed the recipe and did not add or take away anything. My husband and kids all loved it. I served it with yellow rice and fresh green beans and there were no leftovers.

Made it exactly as printed, something most of the reviews here miss for some reason... it's very good and creamy. Next time I'd double the rue for a little extra creamy goodness other then that tasty!

This has to be one of the best chicken Marsala dishes I have ever made! 
The only thing I did different was use 2 cups of Marsala instead of half a cup and doubled the chicken broth. I did this because my family likes extra sauce over rice and to sop up their bread with. 
Soooooo delish! You will make it over and over.

All 6 of us here loved it, not a common occurrence.  Very easy to make, great flavor.  I used half and half instead of heavy cream and it was fine.
