I followed the recipe exactly except for cutting it in half. The mixture wouldn't roll into a ball at all. The best I could hope for were globs to roll in the coconut. I also had to put more coconut in a bowl for rolling because there wasn't enough. Since this is a "healthy" recipe, I used unsweetened coconut. The final product wasn't sweet enough either.
