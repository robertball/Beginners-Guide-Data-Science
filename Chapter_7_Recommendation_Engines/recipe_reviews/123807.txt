I really liked this cookie.  It was really, really easy to make, and the dough was perfect to work with.  Like other reviewers, I used almond extract for the lemon, but I think lemon would have worked well also.  They were very tasty and buttery, and the dough never fell apart.  

One trick I used was to roll out the dough on parchment paper, then cut out the cookie shapes, and then peel away the remaining dough rather than try to lift the shapes, and transfer the whole sheet of parchment to a cookie sheet.  I read that tip from a reviewer on another recipe, and it worked GREAT.  So easy!  I reused the same two pieces of parchment paper for each batch baked.  Instead of the glaze, I added 1/2 teaspoon of water to an egg yolk, divided the mixture into 3 small bowls, and tinted them yellow, orange and red.  I then painted this mixture on my cookies BEFORE baking.  I made brightly colored autumn leaves, and my kids were thrilled!  Next time I might use the glaze, though.  I think I made the egg yolk mixture too thin, and it looked a little patchy on the cookies.  Happy baking, everyone!  UPDATE, 12/18: I made these with the lemon extract, and it's a perfect, gentle lemon flavor.  Excellent.

Great recipe!!  I ended up using almond extract instead of lemon (I didn't have lemon), and they were great!  Easy to roll out (make sure you do use enough flour, or your shapes will bend as you pick them up to put on the sheet).  They're very tender, even the "extra bits" that I re-rolled.  I also didn't use the glaze, but instead my 3 1/2 YO son and I decorated them for Christmas.  My husband said, "Honey, you have absolutely made my grandmother's Christmas cookies."  So, I guess I'll make these every year from now on!  Thanks so much!

I have bad memories of making roll-out cookies but thought I would give this one a whirl after reading the reviews.  I used almond instead of lemon which was yummy.  The dough couldn't have been easier to work with, and I like the fact that you don't have to chill it.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I've been looking for a recipe that I can use with cutters for my children - this is the one I will use forever!  Rolling was a breeze - dough was perfect.  I made it in my food processor and continued adding flour beyond the 3 cups until the dough pulled away from the bowl - it worked out great!

I love that you don't have to take time to refrigerate this dough.....big time saver! I did find the dough to be quite sticky though so I had to keep adding flour until it was in a workable form. I did not care for the lemon extract. I prefer almond which I will be sure to use next time. The glaze works great and gives a shiny finish. Next time I will eliminate some water and replace it with almond extract in that too. Otherwise they baked up nicely and my kids really had fun!

Good cookie but I found the lemon flavor a bit too overpowering for my taste. I will definitely try this recipe again, skipping the lemon and maybe replacing it with orange flavor... Otherwise, the dough was easy to work with, it was easy to cut and held its shape nicely.

These came out unbelievably good - I'm not really a cookie person, but I couldn't get enough of them, I made 3 flavors, vanilla, lemon and almond.

I just sat down from making these.  I forgot to add the egg initially, so the first batch was without it.  They tasted fine anyway...hubby said he actually preferred those!  He did say he'd like more sugar in the dough either way.  Maybe I'll add 1/4c. to 1/2c. more sugar next time.  I'll also cut back on the lemon extract by half, using only 1/4tsp.

I rolled these extra thick, about 1/4inch, so they'd be soft & chewy.  I cooked them for about 10 minutes and then let them sit on the hot tray for a while.  It made about 32 cookies.

I guess I don't like the hassle of painting on the icing.  I ended up dumping the cookies in the bowl of icing face down & then giving them a shake.  I think I'll stick with the colored granulated sugar, especially for Christmas.

These are by far the best rolled sugar cookies I've ever had. They have lots of flavor and are just sweet enough to taste good without frosting, but not so sweet that it's overwhelming if you do choose to frost them. You really in truly don't have to chill the dough and it is easy to work with. This is just an awesome recipe.

These are great! The dough is so easy to work with, and the flavor and consistency is fabulous. I made it with the lemon juice and the flavor was great. The frosting is also great to work with. I was a bit sceptical, but it was the perfect frosting for the cookie, and was also really easy to work with.

GREAT TASTE!  I had a difficult time rolling this dough.  After an hour of trying and only completing a half dozen cookies, I gave up and rolled the dough into little balls, flattened, and dipped them in cinnamon/sugar as I knew I wouldn't be making the frosting.  I must say that after baking these were very tasty and worthy of five stars!  Thank you Bonnie Price for sharing your recipe!

This recipe is terrific!  The dough handles really well & was easy enough for my 5 & 3 year olds to help me.  It also translates nicely to a dairy/egg free recipe with dairy free margerine & a baker's egg substitute as I have a nephew who has egg & dairy allergies.  The egg/dairy free dough is a bit lighter & stickier, & needs a bit more flour on the rolling surface & rolling pin, but otherwise just as easy!

Easiest roll out cookie recipe ever! As long as you flour your surface well and use a floured cookie spatula you will have a wonderful and stress free cookie making experience! :) I omitted the Lemon extract and used Almond extract instead. They are delicious! :)

it was so dry at the end I couldn't even use it. It completely fell apart. I threw it away. I am trying the sugar cookie recipe "best rolled sugar cookies." I hope i have better luck.

Whew, a cookie recipe that is easy and creates great memories with the kids and w/ Mom.  :)  I used 1 cup whole wheat and 2 cups white flour and it turned out great.  Love the lemon flavor.

What a fun recipe!  I hate to wait for dough in the fridge once I make it.  This dough was ready to go once it was mixed.  I really enjoyed rolling these cookies out and the taste was phenomenal! Light, crisp and buttery = YUMMY! I will be keeping this recipe as my #1 roll out recipe.  Thanks so much for sharing!

I would have given this recipe more stars if I could.  I have tried 5 different sugar cookie recipes in the past 3 days trying desperately to find the perfect one, just about ready to lose my sanity.  This is by far the best recipe!!!  My daughter is allergic to eggs, so I used Ener-G egg replacer instead of the egg & you wouldn't even know it.  The dough is so easy to work with, the cookies turn out tasty AND still in their original cutout shape.  I will only use this recipe from now on.  I need to go get some more cookie cutters, just so I have an excuse to make these again.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe!!!

I used this recipe as my first attempt to make cut-out cookies. It is so easy - even my first batch turned out  wonderfully! I have made them several times since. In my opinion, they taste better than other cut-out cookies I have eaten!

These are pretty good. They have a very subtle flavor. My mother thought they had no taste, but the rest of the family liked them. They're also pretty easy to make and don't stick. I'd use this recipe again.

Excellent dough for using cookie cutters!  The only thing I omitted was the lemon extract.  I opted for real butter (not margarine) as I do in all my baked goods.  They are very tasty and I'll bet you can't eat just one!  :o)

Yummy cookies, but the winner in this recipe is the glaze.  My kids had a great time applying it with paint brushes...much nicer/easier than trying to help little hands spread icing with a knife.

The dough was easy to work with and kept its shape while baking, so the cut-outs stayed true.  I think the glaze my be improved w/a bit of lemon extract to compliment the flavor of the cookie.

Wow, these came out perfect! We made them exactly per recipe. Love the light lemon flavor.  My almost 4 yr old rolled them out and used the cutters, and even after her repeated rolling they came out just right.

Just made these cookies!  I am surprised at how many had NO problem rolling the dough.  My dough was crumbly. I tried adding more flour, but did not want to add too much they would taste like flour. Still crumbly.  I followed directions. Used butter. The few I got baked tasted ok. Will try once more. Any hints to make rolling easier???? I will try the parchment paper trick too!

I was SO disappointed with this recipe.  The dough was way too dry and crumbly.  The cookies fell apart, and the lemon was too overpowering.  So, I continue my quest for the perfect cookie-cutter cookie recipe : (

This cookie recipe is outstanding.  Easy to make and handle, I love that the dough does not need to be refrigerated!  I did not find the lemon extract too much, it was really subtle, and everyone at work loved the Christmas cookies I brought in.  I also really like that the cookie does not expand too much when baking.  Perfect recipe for decorating. Thanks!

These cookies were easy and delicious, better tasting than other cut out cookies I've tried. I would definitely hand mix the flour mixture in for the best outcome. The glaze was super easy too and very easy for kids to use.

This recipe is AWESOME.  I have made it twice now and both times came out perfectly.  The dough is the perfect consistency and I love that you don't have to chill it! The cookies are delicious - the lemon extract is what really makes it - and I love that they are easy to slide off the pan and don't burn around the edges.  Thanks!

I have tried several roll-out recipes and this one is fantastic!  I brought these in to work and several co-workers told me they were the best cookies they have ever had.  Like many others I did have to had quite a bit of extra flour but the other ingredients are spot on! Love that it doesn't have to be refrigerated!

I substituted the lemon extract for almond extract.  I was worried the almond flavor might be overwhelming, but they turned out perfectly.

I have made many different recipes for cut-out cookies.  I chose this one, this time, because I was in a hurry and did not have time to refrigerate the dough.  I really liked how easy it was to roll out the dough; I liked the taste of the cookies; and I liked the texture of the finished cookies.  I will definitely make these again.  I did find that I needed to lower the temperature of my oven as I came close to burning the first ones.  I also tried the glaze with sprinkles and that worked out well and dried fast. Excellent recipe. Thank you.

Awesome cookie recipe.  Did use the lemon like them a lot next time will try with almond extract instead.  Used what others had suggested and rolled out and baked on parchment paper that was the easiest time I have ever had making cut out cookies, dough is awesome to work with and no refrigeration.  Will make these from now on for cut out cookies!

Just made these with my 2.5 year old daughter for a rainy day activity. They worked really well - she loved rolling out the dough and cutting the shapes then "painting" them.  We def needed more flour than called for as it was too sticky and I think we added more vanilla than stated - I turned around and she was free pouring it in! Still they taste nice - added lemon juice instead of extract. I think almond or orange essence would work better tho.

Yummy!  I made these cookies today with my four-year-old niece.  I didn't have lemon extract, so I just used vanilla in it's place.  I also just used canned frosting.  We were able to make and bake an entire batch in less than an hour.  Easy, easy, easy and good.  I'll make these again for sure and I'm not really a roll out/frost/decorate sort of baker.  Perfect to do with children!

The dough came together very quickly and it rolled out easily. It cracked a lot when I re-rolled the scraps. But it wasn't terrible.    This is a really great recipe for beginning bakers.

Very nice basic cookie.  It was a bit too dry though and crumbly so I had to sprinkle water over the dough to make it hold together.  My butter was half softened and half from the fridge so that might have been part of it.  I will definitely try again though and probably try with different spices and extracts to mix it up a bit.

These turned out wonderful for me and the children.  It was my first attempt at cut-out decorated sugar cookies. I used templates of my children's hands to make turkey's :-).  I made them directly per the recipe and the flavor was very nice.

Tasted great.  I did have to add 1-3 tablespoons of milk to get the dough to the right consistency.  Cookies kept their shape nicely.  I will try glaze next time.  I just sprinkled colored sugar before putting the cookies in the oven.

Thank you Bonnie. I had two cookie cutters that I was never able to use due to difficulty. I figured if you had 5000 cookie cutters you would know what it was like to have an interesting shape but not able to make it from roll out to baking pan. They were gone before the meeting was over.

The icing must be sensational because I made the cookies without it and was left underwhelmed. These were fairly labor intensive for lackluster results. (Original rating 2 stars) Update: To salvage these, I made mini heart cookie sandwiches using store bought cream cheese frosting which really intensified the flavor of the cookies, making them much more enjoyable.

This was a nice cookie recipe, but not as good as a really good roll-out sugar cookie.  I liked the lemony smell of the dough, but after the cookies were baked the lemon smell and flavor were barely discernible.  However, the cookies tasted fabulous paired with the lemon cream cheese frosting from this site, and were gobbled down in a flash.

This dough was the perfect playdough texture to work with, and it didn't have to be chilled!  The cookies baked beautifully and were so much fun to decorate.  They were an excellent, flaky texture, not too hard and tasted excellent.  I didn't have lemon extract, so I used almond extract as suggested by others, and they came out great.

SUPER easy recipe. Very quick too. After reading some other reviews I added about 1/4 teas. cinnamon, 1/8 teas. nutmeg and a few pinches of salt for flavor. I also rolled mine a little thicker and the cookies were soft and yummy!

Not bad, but definitely not the best-tasting roll-out sugar cookies.  5 stars for easy rolling, but they were too crisp and not very flavorful.  If you're looking for a softer and more moist roll-out sugar cookie, look elsewhere.

I have been making these cookies for about 6 years now. I use the almond extract in place of the lemon. I have tried lemon, but prefer the almond. These have been my go-to cookies for all the baseball, softball, soccer, 4H, Cub Scouts, holiday events and more. I  love how they hold their shapes and that I don't need to refrigerate them. The glaze is perfect and the cookies are stack-able, without transferring glaze and smearing. Perfect recipe.

This recipe makes a great tasting cookie. It's quick and easy!  Just make sure to keep flouring the rolling surface and the dough itself.  I did not use this particular glaze recipe, I made my own frosting/icing.

The dough is so easy to work with!  I use a Silpat, so it only needs a barely-dusting of flour.  My kids had a great time making them with me.  The scraps that are re-rolled taste nearly as good as the first batch.  The cookies hold their shape well, even with very fine/detailed cookie cutters.  We rolled ours 1/4" thick, used almond extract instead of lemon, and threw in about 1 tsp of lemon zest.  A new family favorite!

The recipe was perfect, but based on other reviews I rolled the dough on wax paper and just transferred cut out shapes w/ the paper to the oven. Made it much easier then trying to peel the cookies away. Otherwise this recipe is perfect. My kids sure enjoyed the decorating part!

Great cookie. I don't usually make roll out cookies because they take a lot of time but I wanted some holiday cookies to decorate so I tried this one. The dough came out more like a shortbread dough, very dry and hard to roll, but the cookies baked up very tasty.  I might try 1/4 cup less flour next time.

I hate making cut-out cookies. At least I did before I came across this recipe! It's unbelievable how well these come together. Thought the dough was a bit soft to be rolled out but it worked like a charm and the cookies held their shape as they were transferred to the baking sheet. Normally, for me, they get all mangled when I try to get them off the spatula. I see more of these in my future!!

Good, quick, simple, recipe. Might try adding different flavours/spices but a great basic recipe. Easy to do with my 2 year old. Just what I was looking for.

Thanks for the easy recipe.  Roll out cookies are well worth the extra effort.  Bake some with kids and make some memories.  This is a nice quick recipe because you don't have to chill the dough, etc.

Incredibly easy, tastes just as good as the one I used to make that took over 2 hours in the fridge. Have found a holiday cookie recipe for life. 

I too switched the lemon extract for more vanilla. I used my own glaze, so don't know how that one turns out.

Definitely try it!

These were very easy and good.  I didn't use the glaze and also substituted almond extract. I don't usually like to make cutouts because rolling them can be a pain but these were easy to roll.  I will be making these again and again.

I haven't had a lot of luck in the past making cut out cookies, but these cookies were truly so easy and turned out so well.  My 31/2 yr daughter had so much fun rolling and cutting. Decorating was a blast with Mom's cream cheese frosting.  I am still cleaning up sprinkles! Note: The dough seemed a bit crumbly, but still worked out.  Room temp. makes a huge difference over trying to soften butter or shortening in the microwave.

Felt as if the cookie was missing something... Not a fan.

However, the glaze was pretty good.

This cookie tastes good - but it was more trouble than it's worth in my opinion.  Granted, this was the first "from scratch" cookie I have ever made so maybe therein lies the problem.  I had to add at least 1 cup more flour than the recipe calls for.  I wasn't sure what the consisency should be at first but soon realized 3 cups was definitely not enough.  They also took a little longer to bake than listed, more like 9 minutes for me.  Again, for such a "ho-hum" cookie, wouldn't go thru the trouble again.

These were fantastic!  I saw a lot of people didn't use the lemon extract though...seriously, use it!  That made them so good!  I also did the glaze.  It was so much fun and it was really good.  I just used a regular children's paintbrush.  I love the fact that this doesn't have to be chilled.  This is a great recipe to use with kids because you're not on a time crunch to cut them out.  This is a new family favorite!  Thanks!

These were the easiest cut out cookies I have made yet.  They didn't need to be refrigerated (yeah) and they came together quickly.  The most difficult part was getting the last of the flour mixed in, but I just dumped the mixture onto a well cleaned counter top and used my hands to mix it together (sort of like kneading bread) and it came together really well.  I also used Almond Extract rather than lemon and they are very good.  If you roll them out thin they are really crisp (a great texture for a sugar cookie) OR you can roll them thicker and they hold together better but were NOT tough.  VERY NICE.  This will be our Christmas Cookie Recipe from here forward.  Thanks so much!
