I loved this but I made so many changes that I had to give it 4 stars.  I only used the zucchini and sweet potato (omitted broccoli which didn't sound good and russet potatoes which I was out of).  I doubled the cumin and shedded one of the sweet potatoes.  I also used organic begetable broth instead of chicken.  I used celery salt and a pinch of tumeric and coriander. I only added 1/2 cup milk and some fillini soup pasta.  It was a hit and was very much like many of the soups we had in Jamaica and the Caribbean.

This is a wonderful soup. The best veggie soup I have ever made. Healthy and filling. Will definitely make again. It involves some chopping but once it's in the cooker you are home free. You will love this soup!

this soup really lacked flavor. toss in some hot chili peppers, a tablespoon of salt, a tablespoon of sugar, a dash of cumin and it should be good to go. great selection of veggies, although didn't leave much room in my crockpot. goes well with garlic bread.

This soup was awful, it needed something to add flavor what a disappointment.  I'm making soups freezing a serving for the winter months when we are most busy at work and this soup by far was low on flavor.

I made some adjustments and it turned out fine for us.  I didn't use the white potatoes.  Shredded one sweet potato and diced the other 2.  I used 2t cumin, the recc amt of celery seed (would up it next time), used some coriander, and some curry.  IMO, it still needed a lot of flavor.  I cooked it at 3hrs on High and then an additional 30 minutes more after the addition to the milk.  I think that the 8-10 hours on Low is WAY too long, especially for the broccoli, which was most likely the contributing factor to the bitterness that people were complaining about.  I think that 3 hrs MAX on High should be plenty.  I'll try it one more time because it was easy enough to make (prep took 20 minutes from start to finish) and nutritious with the variety of vegetables, but it wasn't one of DH's favorites.  Picky 3yo DD ate it all, though, which warrants 4 stars for me.

I cubed the potato instead of shredding it. I also added other veggies to the soup and when I pureed it, I left some veggies whole. I found this soup tasted better the second day. Overall, very good.

This recipe tasted terrible!  Drowning it in salt didn't help the taste one bit!  I don't know if it's that I left the zucchini skin on or what but it was very bitter.

First of all, let me say that this was a DELICIOUS soup -- the spices were perfect and yummy. But since people had issues with the broccoli & zucchini, I decided to add them only at the last hour of cooking. This worked well for the zucchini, but not the broccoli, which turned a sickly color. So I think next time (and there will be a next time!) I will just eliminate the broccoli and add another zucchini. Thanks for this recipe, Corwynn!

This was pretty bland. We had to add salt and pepper at the table, and will try adding some shredded cheddar to the leftovers.

I followed the directions exactly. It smelled amazing all day and I was excited to eat it, but then I added the milk. The milk and zucchini just don’t taste right together, even the two smells didn’t mix right.
