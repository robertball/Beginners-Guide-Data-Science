This was very bland when made as the recipe called for. Added some seasoning, and a little smoky hot sauce that brought more flavor into it, but even then, I wouldnâ€™t make it again. Everyone tried it, but no one had anymore than the taste.

Mashed potatoes give it a different texture and more spread like than dippish.  Easy peasy.
