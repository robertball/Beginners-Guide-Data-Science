After trying Chantal's New York Cheesecake recipe, I'm changing my rating on this one -- the apple filling is still amazing but it needs to be doubled, and use with the other cheesecake recipe.  You'll have people swooning over this dessert.

Took this to a wine tasting and made a great hit.  I used cinnamon graham crackers in the crust and also added cinnamon to the apples when cooking.  We paired with an Orange Muscato dessert wine.  It was devine.

This cheesecake was very sublime, very down-home flavor with a little bit of something extra.  Very nice!

This cheesecake needs caramel drizzled over the top to make it excellent.  The caramel adds a lot of flavor that the cheesecake alone is missing.

WOW!  This is AWESOME!  I did change the Cheescake portion to the Chantal's New York Cheesecake recipe found here and also baked the cheescake at 350 F in a water bath for 1 hr 20 mins.  Let it set in the oven with the door closed for 4 hours.  No cracks or anything! This is FANTASTIC!!

a smashing success! i have made this cheesecake for my family and it has always gotten rave reviews. i recently made it for my boyfriend's father's birthday party and it was an instant hit! it was gone in record time and left people begging me for the recipe and begging me to make it for their birthdays! make sure the apples remain some firmness so that they aren't super-soggy when the cheesecake is done cooking.
