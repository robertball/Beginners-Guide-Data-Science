The first time I made this recipe, I used  the caramels and evaporated milk as directed. I used a standard brownie mix made according to package directions, baking it in a 10" spring form pan well coated with Pam. I baked the brownie layer for 15 to 20 minutes then sprinkled the edges with some chopped pecans to prevent the caramel layer from leaking out. I sprinkled white chocolate chips over the baked brownie crust before I spread the caramel layer on. I took the advice of others and used 3 pkg.  of cream cheese, 3/4 c sugar and  3 eggs. I baked the cheesecake layer for 50 minutes. I had no problems getting it out of the pan and it was not hard to cut. It was marvelous. I decorated the top with carmel and fudge drizzles put through a pastry bag..
I just made it for the second time and used the La Lechera Caramel flavor, although it is easier,  I do not think it tastes  as good as caramels w/ evaporated milk. I followed all the above steps and it baked nicely. We will "taste" the second creation  results on  Mother's Day.
This is definately a 5 Star recipe.  I come from a family of professional chefs and have done the baking for our restaurant for many years.

I have made this cheesecake many times. Some things I have adjusted. First do not cook the brownie crust as long as it says. If you do you will not be able to cut the cake! 10 minutes works fine for me. Also because this is a bit overpowering sweet, I have made the cheesecake portion 50% bigger. 3 creamcheese, 3 eggs, 3/4 cup sugar,1 1/2 vanilla. 60 minutes in the oven (check at 50 min). Everyone I have made this for, loves it!! I even made it for a bake sale, the price was $10 BUT alot of the people there have had it before and started Bidding on it. Last bid was $38, and the money went to a great cause. Enjoy!!

I am having issues with the brownie crust. I have made this twice and the brownie part comes out hard. According to the recipe the brownie is being cooked for 65 minutes. I think that is too long and is causing the brownie to be hard. Can some one provide me with how long the this recipe is suppose to be baked for?

Taking the suggestions from other reviews, I used a 10-1/2 ounce package of brownie mix and followed the package directions.  Most important, again following the advice of others, I baked the brownie layer for only 12 minutes--and it was not long enough!  I wish I would have followed the recipe.  Other than that, it was a delicious cheesecake, and very pretty too.  I garnished it with pecan halves and used homemade hot fudge sauce. It's very rich, so small pieces are suggested!

The good thing about waiting to make a recipe is that you can wait until it's been tested by others and learn from their mistakes and take their suggestions.  So that's what I did!  Make this recipe using a large size (for 13x9) brownie mix, use La Lechera (thanks to whomever offered that suggestion.  I'd never even heard of that before.), and increase the cheesecake layer by half.  Bake brownie layer for 20 minutes before proceeding.  This turned out wonderful!  We had it for a dinner party and it was the only dessert that totally disappeared! To all of the folks who tried this recipe as written with disasterous results - try it again with these alterations and you'll be pleasantly surprised.

This was a HUGE hit at Easter!  I followed previous reviewers' advice and used the Jiffy brownie mix and baked the brownies for 10 minutes.  I then made the caramel and the cream cheese filling; I wrapped the bottom of the pan in tin foil and submerged it in a pan with warm water to bake-it was fabulous!  There wasn't a bite left and I had many requests for the recipe-thanks!

INSTEAD OF A 9" PAN I USED A 7". THEN USED THE SAME AMOUNT OF INGREDIENTS. I USED A PRODUCT CALLED LaLechera by Nestle (mexican food section-looks like a sweet condensed pan--Dulce de Leche) BASICALLY IT'S CARMEL SWEETENED CONDENSED MILK. SO YOU ELIMINATE THE WHOLE CARMEL PROCESS. SLIGHTLY WARM IT TO SOFTEN IT...THEN ONLY COOK THE BROWNIE 15 MIN. SPREAD THE LaLechera ONLY TO 1/2 " FROM THE EDGE. FOLLOW THE REST OF THE DIRECTIONS.  THE END RESULT IS ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS. AND NO HARD BROWNIE STORY HERE!  YUMMY!!!

Well, there's so many reviews about this recipe that if anybody actually falls upon reading this, I'll be so happy!   I'm giving this recipe a one star, and ONLY because I think that it hasn't been tested properly.  IMO there' a MAJOR MISTAKE in this recipe.  Nearly everyone's complained about the caramel running out of the cake.  Here's why.  5 OUNCES OF EVAPORATED MILK IS WAY TOO MUCH.  That's roughly 2/3 of a cup!   No wonder it oozes out! Use 1/4 cup of evaporated milk with 14 ounces of caramels.  And if adding chopped pecans, add 1-1/4 cups, that will also help the caramel stay put.  Also I think that this recipe should just say "9 ounces of packaged brownie mix, prepare as directed on package".... no wonder so many people have messed it up.. lol... I bet they're adding an extra egg and water to the mix!

I read several reviews and decided to make this along with the help of a few suggestions. First I used turtle brownie mix, and baked it about 15-20 minutes, just so it looked almost done but not quite. I followed the suggestion of another by using 3 cream cheese, 3/4C sugar,1 1/2 t. vanilla & 3 eggs. I skipped making the caramel sauce completely because the brownie mix had it included. So I purchased a jar of milky way ice cream topping/sauce to drizzle on the top of each slice as it was served. Everyone was soooo impressed!! This turned out awsome!!

I have made this recipe 2 times now, and the first time was not as good as the second, I followed some tips like adding 2 tbs veg oil and that didn't help much, I also baked it for only 15 mins, it turned out burnt on the edges and to chewy to chew in the middle... the second time I made it, I followed the advice of the old standby.. Mom... Add an extra egg she says and put a pan of water in the oven with it.. So I did that along with the veg oil... and voila!!! a masterpiece... I'm a pretty good cheesecake maker ... but this one was a toughy to figure out.. definitely not for the novice...

This cheesecake is so good, it's insane! I did change a lot of things but overall I couldn't have done it without the recipe itself and without reading every review before attempting it. As for the caramel, I didn't change a thing...followed the recipe exactly. For the crust, I used a 21 oz. brownie mix and made it according to the package (for chewy brownies). I used a 10" spring form pan (which I greased) because of the larger brownie package...baked for 25 minutes as instructed. I let that and the caramel sauce cool for 15 minutes before pouring the caramel over the brownie, kept the caramel 1/2" away from edge of pan. For the cheesecake part, I followed the reviewer's recommendations as far as the 3 packages of cream cheese and 3 eggs, I used 1 cup of sugar, 1 tablespoon of cornstarch, 1 tablespoon of vanilla and 1/2 cup of sour cream. Baked it for 45 minutes with a pan of water on lower rack. Left it in the oven (door closed) for 2 hours, on the counter for 2 more, in the fridge overnight. Honestly, it is the best thing that I have ever baked and I love to bake!! Thank you Jackie for sharing this decadent dessert.

Big hit with my family! I reserved 2/3 cup of the caramel mixture instead of the 1/3 cup suggested because it would have been too rich - I'd do it again.  I couldn't find an 8 oz. pkg brownie mix, so I used "Betty Crocker Smart Size" 10.25 oz, and it was just fine. I don't eat cream cheese so I didn't try this cheesecake, but everyone loved it!  Thanks for the recipe!

I was TERRIFIED to make this after reading reviews.  It was either you bombed it, or it was amazing. I took into account suggestions from MANY reviews, it was AWESOME!! Here are the changes I used:  Used the 10.25oz brownine pckg (made as directed per pkg as far as oil, egg and 2 tbsp water) added about 1/2 cup choc chips to help maintain mositure. Baked the brownie for only 10 mins and pulled it out, letting it cool pretty much completely.  I added the caramel, which I just bought the Smuckers Caramel topping, used only about 1/2 the jar.  I did add a ring of chopped pecans along the edge of the brownie, trying to keep the caramel in, some of it still spilled out.  I did the 1.5 batch of cheesecake filling everyone has mentioned (2 blocks low fat, 1 block reg cheese, 3 eggs, etc).  Made sure all ingredients were at room temp before I started too. Once this layer was on, baked at 350 degrees for 45 mins.  I did put a 9x13 pan underneath in the oven filled with water.  After the 45 mins were up I left in the oven, door closed, for another 2 hours.  Then took out and let sit on counter another hour before I put in fridge.  No cracks at all and was perfectly cooked (center needs to wobble at 45 mins). After cooled completely I topped with the fudge and caramel.  It was AMAZING, the brownie part was very fudgey and was perfect, as was the cheesecake.  The dinner guests, as well as the hubby, raved about this.  Its a keeper for sure!

EXCELLENT! I took the advice of other reviewers & made a couple of changes: Used Betty Crocker 10.25 oz brownie mix-prepared as directed on pkg & baked for 10 min.Used 1/3 less fat cream cheese & increased ingredients to 3 cream cheese, 3/4C sugar,1 1/2 t. vanilla & 3 eggs. Reserved 2/3 C of caramel mixture for top of cake. Baked cheesecake in a bath (SEE CHEESECAKE TIPS)for 50 minutes.  Family & friends of all ages really enjoyed it!  Thank you for the recipe.

This cheesecake is very good, but it does need to be adjusted.  I bought a regular box of brownies and made it according to the box but only used 2/3rds of the batter, & baked it in a 10-inch springform pan for 10 minutes.  Then with the caramels, I took another subscribers ideal and only mixed the caramels with 1/4 cup of evap. milk.  Then as suggested, used 3 8-oz cream cheese, 3/4 cup sugar, three eggs, and 1 1/2 tbsp vanilla, poured that on top and baked it for 40 minutes with a water-filled pan in the oven.  When it was done baking, I left it in the over for one hour with the door open.

this is really awesome! I had baked it last night as a gift for gradutaion ceremony of my colleague. At first I was pretty worried since the brownie layer seemed to be too thin (I used 10'springform and 10.25 oz brownie mix)and did not look like what the I see in photo. I followed the suggestions by baking it as box direction for 12 minutes, and after that I sprinkled the brownie with loads of macadamia nuts and then gooey caramel filled another layer (I took the advice to fill only until 1' apart from the side of pan to avoid sticking and making it burnt). After beating 3 cream cheeses with 3/4 c sugar and 3 eggs until glossy I baked the cake for 35 - 40 minutes without bathing and let it stand in the closed oven for hour. No crack and the top got beautifully browned! After taking it out I ran the knife around the edge and chilled for overnight. And just before serving I drizzled with chocolate topping. You have to see faces of my co-workers as they walked to the cake tray as soon as I put it down. Some of them have already asked me to bake this fabulous cake for her birthdays and some asked me why I dont quit the job and go for my own bakery shop!! Next time I may use large size of brownie mix, increased baking time for brownie crust (since this time it's still a bit undercooked) and reduce caramel a bit, but overall I have to say that I'm glad I chose this recipe!!

BEWARE!  Use the 5 oz can of evaporated milk not the 12 oz. I made a gooey mess! Afte reading other reviews I don't think I'm the first person to make this mistake.  It tasted good and I will try it again.

I've made several cheesecakes and this one got rave reviews from my family.    The tricks I learned with this one:  Make a Duncan Hines Chewy Brownie mix box (I think it was 20 something ounces) according to the cake-like brownie recipe with 3 eggs.   Then measure out 12 fl ounces (yes fluid, I used a measure cup with the pour spout) into the spring form pan.   I baked it for 18 minutes. You HAVE to watch the baking of the crust minute to minute.  Pull it out as soon as the center is just done.    Then you HAVE to bake it in a waterbath.  If you do it keeps the crust soft and moist, the top won't crack, and it will come out beautifully.     Definately do 1.5 for the cheesecake filling. I debated about this and was glad I did afterwards.  This is a really pretty cheesecake and it tastes awesome.  Ignore the back and forth reviews and just do common sense baking with it.   Brownies get hard if overbaked=its a brownie crust= don't overbake it and it will be fabulous:)

This is a pretty good recipe. I have been wanting to make it for quite a while. I used a 10 oz. package of brownie mix. Keep in mind when you make this that the brownie is as thick, if not more than the cheesecake layer. My brownie rose more in the middle than the sides so I let my caramel thicken before pouring it on so it wouldn't all run to the sides. The tricky part is putting the cheesecake mixture on top of the caramel. What caramel I did have in the middle was pushed to the sides when I carefully spread the mixture over the top. I baked following the directions and my brownie was not chewy as many described. I had a nice fluffy brownie on the bottom. My caramel hardened a bit because it was mostly pressed against the sides of the springform pan but this was still a good cheesecake. I would recommend this recipe, but just keep in mind it can be tricky and may not come as exactly like the main photo.....at least your first time around unless you are really, really good. I am not sure how they maintained that stick perfect layer of caramel.

So good it bro't tears to my eyes!  I will admit, however, that I'd probably eat an old shoe with Kraft caramel sauce on it!  I would NEVER substitute anything for that Kraft/evaporated milk mixture!  I used a full 19.5 box brownie recipe following the "chewy" version.  I only had a 10-inch springform, so I used a little more than half of the brownie mix to spread on the bottom of the pan.  (I put the rest in a mini muffin pan for brownie bites!)  I cooked (the mini muffins and) the brownie layer for 15 minutes at 350. The top had crinkled a little and the edges were just dry. After I pulled the brownie layer out, I turned the oven down to 315, and let the caramel mixture cool just a bit to thicken.  I used the idea of putting chopped pecans around the edge to hold in the caramel.  It worked VERY well and made a nice "crust" around the finished product.  Using room temperature cream cheese and eggs, I followed recipe procedures but also increased cream cheese to 3 packages, eggs to 3, and vanilla to 1-1/2 tsp.  While cooking the cheesecake part, I put a pan of water on the rack underneath.  (Is that for good luck?)  I didn't trust myself with a real water bath!  I cooked this at the 315 for 50 minutes.  Then I turned off the oven, and let the cake sit in the closed oven for 30 minutes.  I cracked opened the oven door for the next 30.  (I'd read somewhere that a gradual cooling process was important?)  I took the cheesecake out of the oven, and put on a rack with an inverted p

WARNING: Highly addictive!  The presentation on this was awesome.  I am a fairly new cook and realized I had to go buy a springform pan (a pan where the sides can be removed from the bottom base) before I could make this but it was totally worth all of the time to make.  Can't wait to make it for company.  Changes: made half a brownie mix as package instructed and baked 12 minutes, used hersey's choc syrup (easy to make good presentation), reserved 2/3 cup of caramel and thus did not have any problems with a mess.  MAKE THIS RECIPE!

Soo many different reviews to read through on this one! Of the ten-plus different boxes of brownie mix at my grocery store, none were the 9 oz. called for. So I used a 15 oz box, prepared per box instructions and poured about 2/3 of the batter in my prepared springform pan. The rest of the brownie batter went into a mini muffin pan for my little guy's lunches. I baked the crust 10 minutes instead of the given time. The other reviews that say their crust turned out hard as a rock scared me. My crust turned out just a tad gooey but I'm glad I went with the 10 minutes. The rest of the directions I followed as per instructed. Very rich, very good :)

This is a long variation but WELL worth it if you have the patience, and amazing rich: My favorite cake in the world is called Vesuvius cake, it's basically a brownie crust, a chocolate ganache layer, a cheesecake layer topped with another thin ganache layer, then topped with chocolate mousse and a dark chocolate fudge "ball" at the end.  It sounds complicated but it really isn't.  I used this recipe as a base to recreate it.  I start with the brownie "crust" and then add the first ganache layer.  For the ganache I bring 2 cups heavy cream to a boil and added 18 oz semi-sweet chocolate chips, stir together till smooth.  Let it melt and bring to room temp then spread about 1/3 of it (I like ganche) on the brownie.  You can add the caramel mix from this recipe or not.  Top with cheesecake mix as instructed in recipe and bake in waterbath.  While the cake is baking, whip up a chocolate mousse (boxed ones are fine I feel) and refrigerate.  One cheesecake is cooled, top with another layer of ganache, you can heat it over a double-boiler to liquify again, but don't heat too much.  Cool ganache and top with a thick mousse layer.  I then whip up remaining ganache into a frosting and pipe in large dollops around the cheesecake.  Topped off with melted white and dark chocolate drizzle and butterscotch chips and it's amazing!

Absolutely delicious.  I cooked mine in a 9x11 glass pan sprayed with Pam.  I cooked the brownie for 15 minutes. Added remaining ingredients and bake for the additional 40 minutes. Did not sick!!
Everyone at work thought they had went to Heaven!
Thanks!

I think I must have done something really wrong, I was REALLY excited about making this dessert - only baked the brownie layer for 10 minutes at first but after it's baked with the cheesecake it came out really hard - and the caramel layer came out kind of slimey.  I don't know if it's possible to bake brownies and cheesecake together - b/c the baking times are so different.  I might try making it again but I enjoy both desserts separately :) Or perhaps I'll make the two separately and put then together after :) And plus I like my brownies to be warmed a little in the microwave and you can't do that with the cheesecake layer on top of it :)

I made this yesterday for my husband's  birthday and the family's Father's Day get-together.  Everyone liked it a lot!  BTW, I used the Jiffy 8 oz brownie mix and baked the brownie part for 12 minutes and it turned out perfectly.  I also added raspberries to the top just before serving.  Thanks for a great recipe Jackie!

I took the advice of other posters and tweaked the bake time on the brownie crust. I also bought the new Caramel Bits instead of wrapped caramels which is a HUGE time saver. Great recipe!!

This recipe was so delicious!  I followed the recipe as printed, and even though everyone loved it at work and it looked beautiful, the next time I make it, I'll make the adjustments other reviewers suggested.  The brownie layer turned out moist, and I would've liked a bigger cheesecake layer, so I'll use three blocks of cream cheese instead of two, as others suggested.  I'll also used melted chocolate as a drizzle instead of Hershey's chocolate syrup (what I had on hand) which was too thin and runny.  To make a "lighter" version, I used Egg Beaters in the brownie and cheesecake layers, fat-free evaporated milk in the caramel sauce, and lower-fat cream cheese. With these changes, it tasted just as rich and decadent (and without all the guilt)!  I will definitely make it again!  I made three of these for a wedding reception, and they were a huge hit!

I used 2/3 of the batter from an 18oz brownie mix, baked for 15 in before adding the dulce de leche topping.  For the cheesecake, i also took the advice of using 3 eggs, 1.5 tsp vanilla, and 3 pkgs of cream cheese.  I think my oven may be off a little and so 45 min was a few min longer than necessary.  I don't think anybody else noticed though--- I brought it to work and had the pan handed back to me, cleaned and dried, in under 5 minutes. I really should have brought a stopwatch with me!

This recipe sounded wonderful but did not live up to expectations. I'm wondering if there was a step left out of the recipe. After pouring the caramel over the brownie crust I think you need to chill before adding the cheesecake mixture. I did not and the caramel was pushed up the sides of the cheesecake mixture resulting in a burnt caramel ring around the cheesecake. When sliced there was not much of a caramel layer left except for around the outer edge of the brownie. I would recommend letting the caramel completely cool and set before adding the cheesecake layer.

Wow! The perfect end to a girls' potluck binge! I dusted the top with cocoa, then drizzled caramel and garnished with whipped cream and chocolate kisses.  We probably all gained 10 pounds, but it was worth it!! Thanks Jackie!

I don't get the high ratings for this cheesecake.  The brownie portion is so hard I had to use a chef's knife just to cut thru it.  The caramel layer leaked out during baking all around the sides of the cheesecake making it near impossble to remove from the pan.  I've noticed from the reviews that almost everyone makes some sort of modification to get it to turn out.  Therefore, I don't understand why everyone gives it such good reviews if they're changing it.  This recipe is just too expensive to waste your time on it.

AMAZING! This was my first attempt at cheesecake and it was so so good. I used peanut butter brownie mix and baked it for 18 min. rather than 25. Rather than melting carmels and milk, i just used Smuckers carmel syrup, keeping it about a 1/2 inch from the edge. When I baked the cheescake I put a pan of water in the rack below to prevent cracking. When it was done baking I turned the oven off and let the cake cool in there with the door slightly ajar for about 1 hour. After that i placed it in the fridge until it was completely cool. It turned out so well and everyone loved it, I am defintely making it again!

I used a 18 ounce box of brownie mix and mixed it according to the directions on the box.  I poured a little over a half of the batter into a 9 inch springform pan.  The rest of the batter I put in mini mini muffin tins and made brownie bites.  I followed previous reviewers suggestions and used 3 pkgs of cream cheese (2 regular & 1 low fat), 3 eggs and 3/4 cups of white sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla.  I baked the brownie crust for about 20 mins. Put on the caramel and used the trick of adding pecans around the sides so that the caramel wouldn't ooze out. Added the cream cheese mixture and baked in the oven for over an hour. I did use the pan with water method.  The water pan was on a rack under my cheesecake.   I have to say this cheesecake is better the next day.  Very good and absolutely beautiful.  Would make a nice gift.  I had NO problems slicing the cheesecake. It was not rock hard like others have reported. Thanks for sharing !

yum, this recipe was simply FANTASTIC. I'm not sure I have ever made something that tasted this good!!
I followed the other reviewers' advice and I baked 1/2 to 3/4 a box of brownie mix on the bottom of a 9 inch springform pan for about 10-15 minutes. I used 3 packages of cream cheese, 3/4 cups of sugar and 3 eggs.  Instead of melting carmel candy I simply used Smuckers Carmel syrup- I was a little nervous about using this-thought it might be a too runny- but it was perfect! It held its form under the cheesecake layer.  I also put chocolate chips under the carmel syrup. mmmmmmmmmm   and it tasted    like heaven. I baked it at 300 degrees in a small water bath. It took about an hour and a half to bake!  but it didn't crack. Seriously good. And it was easy to make! Gonna make it again for a family barbeque this weekend.  I defintly recommend this recipe. And try using the Smuckers Carmel syrup. Way easier than melting candy- or using evaporated milk and it tasted oh-so-good!

I used a 10.25 oz. brownie mix and followed the directions on it using 1 egg, 1/4 cup vegetable oil and 2 T. water. I followed the suggestion in earlier reviews and baked the brownie crust for 12 minutes. It turned out wonderful. I took it to a Memorial Day party and everyone raved about it and wanted the recipe. I plan on making this again and again!

This is fabulous.  I have now started getting constant requests for this!  I use an 18oz. brownie mix with chocolate chips in it, and I have used almond extract rather than vanilla (a hit both ways).  I also make mine in a 10" springform pan (mostly due to the larger brownie mix.)  I drizzle the caramel and fudge sauces over the top in a squiggly design and a little onto the plate for a pretty presentation.

You simply can not go wrong with this cheesecake.  It is outstanding.

This was a great cheesecake - I covered the top of the cheesecake with caramel sauce, then poured a smaller diameter of chocolate sauce, then another smaller circle of caramel sauce and pulled a knife from the center of the cake outward several times to create a starburst-type design.  Everybody was first impressed with the appearance and when we finally cut into it, they thought the cheesecake was fantastic.

This sucked.  The intention and flavor of the combo was awesome.  However.  I followed the recipe exactly and the brownie crust was HARD and STUCK.  I made this for my birthday and took it to a restaurant for dessert.  I had a big new knife.  It took me five minutes to get ONE piece cut and actually off the pan and I was exhausted.  I had to set it in the middle and we all took our forks to it and ate the cheesecake and caramel off the top.  That was excellent in flavor, but overall if the crust won't come off the pan and you can't even cut it in slices, it is a failure !!

If you go by the directions brownie layer will be hard and over cooked, the caramel will be too runny so when you layer the cheesecake mixture the caramel oozes up the sides and disappears into the cheesecake.  Will NOT make this again.

This cheese cake was good, however, compared to my usual cheesecake which is plain, this could not hold a candle.  I found that there was too much brownie for the bottom of the cakeand not enough cheesecake.    There was no fooling hubby when I used a boxed brownie.  Hubby said it would taste much better if I used my own brownie recipe (not boxed) and put my cream cheese cake on top of it with ganache.  I'll try that next:)

This cheesecake is not as easy as it sounds. I tried some of the suggestions but non were a success. I had a 18 pkg of brownie mix and measured half out with my food scale. The mix was like cement. So I added a little more. I put it in the oven for 14 min. and the edges wer burned and the middle wasn't touched. The carmel turned out fine! The cheesecake mix was about 2 cream cheese short. It didn't even fill my 9in pan and sunk in the brownie/carmel mix. I've been making cheesecake for years so I know how to make them. I hope I can get to the store and make another one before our Thanksgiving dinner! Maybe I'll try again on another day!!

I used a high quality brownie mix that ended up being 20 oz, definitely too much. Even though I baked it only 15 minutes, it was way too hard after the whole thing was baked and made it very hard to cut. Ended up doubling the cheesecake part as other reviewers suggested which was a good thing. I made the caramel mixture as recipe described, it was very tedious and time comsuming but tasted good, may try the alternative that reviewers have been suggesting. It was definitely a very rich but tastey cheesecake. Will try it again with the amount of brownie mix that recipe called for and only bake 10 minutes tops. Thanks for the recipe, a very yummy and elegant dessert!

First of all, I'm not a cheesecake fan at all...the hubby is.  What interested me was the brownie base.  So, I thought I'd give this a try.  I now have a favorite cheesecake!!!  This recipes rocks!  I usually like to follow a recipe as it is written the first time...if I like the recipe, I'll find ways to tweak it.  I made this recipe as written except that I followed two pieces of advice from reviews:  I didn't bake the brownie as long and I used the La Lachera instead of unwrapping caramels.  It was a total time saver!  I'll make this cheesecake again, and I think next time, I'll increase the cream cheese mixture as some others have suggested.  Also, not sure which size springform pan I used (there were 3 nested and I used the middle pan).  It seemed like the perfect size...not to small and not too large.  Thanks, Jackie, for a really great recipe!!!

I made the mistake of not reading the reviews and followed this recipe word for word. My cake looked NOTHING like the one featured. Mine was very thin. 65 total minutes baking time for that poor brownie? Seriously? This is the only cake I've needed a knife to cut thru the crust. This is a very misleading 4.5 star average recipe because those that gave it high scores altered the recipe significantly.

This would have been fabulous if I had followed the directions.  I wanted to make this, but did not have any caramels.  I did; however, have a jar of caramel sauce, and figured that would be a good enough substitute.  It was not.  After baking the brownie crust, I poured on the sauce and noticed it coming out of the bottom of the pan.  I poured the filling on and placed it on a baking sheet, hoping that some of the caramel would remain in the middle.  Considering how much was burned on the baking sheet, I don't think much remained in the cheesecake.  I did let it cool and then drizzled with extra caramel and chocolate.  It still tastes great - just not enough caramel flavor.  My fault - and I will do it right next time.  For now, we will enjoy this one and just pour the caramel on the top.

I used Ghirardelli brownie mix and I made it according to the package instruction.  I baked it for 10-15 minutes and it turned out great, not difficult to cut.  I followed the suggestion of another by using 3 cream cheese, 3/4C sugar,1 1/2 t. vanilla & 3 eggs.  I wasn't able to find the caramel candy to melt, so I substituted the cream caramels and it turned out well.  I will make this many more times; it was a big hit at Easter!

With my own alterations this was an awesome cheesecake that got rave reviews. I just followed the recipe that was on the box of the brownies.  I also used one cup of sugar verse 1/2 and 2 tsp of vanilla verse only one. It is very important to cook the brownie for only ten minutes or depending on your oven up to 15.  After taking it out of the oven be sure to let it cool. You can do this when the Carmel is cooling. Then put the caramel about 1/2 in away from the edges of the brownie so the caramel doesn't pour over onto the side of the brownie. Lastly place the cheese mixture on top of the caramel that is on top of the brownie and cook it for about 40-45 minutes. When it looks firm and is not bulling it is done. I recommend doing it this way verse the way the directions state. I have made this several times and this way works the best. Be prepared to get great compliments. There will be no left overs!!!!!!!!!!!!

This was excellent with some changes.  I made all of the batter according to the directions for brownies with a cake-like consistency from a 19 oz box of Duncan Hines Family Style Chewy Brownie Mix.  I then used only 9 oz of the made up batter.  Probably will up that slightly to 12 oz or so next time.  Cooked it for 12 minutes. Let it sit briefly.  Poured on the caramel.  Used 3 bars of cream cheese, 3/4 cup sugar, and 1 1/2 tsps vanilla extract.  Cooked 40 minutes in a water bath.  Came out perfectly!  I served it at a 4th of July party and had 3 requests (out of 4 couples) for the recipe!  Everyone raved. Thanks!

Really yummy. Main change I made was instead of using a springform pan I found it easier to use cupcake cups.It cuts the cooking time quite a bit about 10-15 minutes for the brownie 15-20 for the cheesecake. then I use a spoon or shot glass to make a small indention in the brownie which I fill with caramel. Makes it easier when you make it for family get togethers and stuff like that.

This was excellent.  I used a jar of Hershey's Caramel topping instead of making my own to make it quicker and easier.  I also only cooked the brownie for 20 minutes during the first baking time.  Everything came out great.  The brownie was chewy but soft and made an excellent crust.  The cheese part was wonderful also.  My daughter said, "Mom, you gotta keep this recipe."  Great recipe and definitely a keeper.

I Love this brownie caramel cheesecake one of my favourite cheesecakes to make. Rather then making mine in a sprin form pan I did it in a cilacone one. I made my brownies from scratch there is a wonderful recipe called all in one bowl brownies on this website that I used. Rather then cooking the cheesecake ontop of the brownie I cooked the brownie covered it with the caramel and let it cool. Then I took the bottom out and made the cheesecake separt and then placed it on the top of the brownie, this provented the brownie geting too hard, this way it stayed nice and soft.

This was the first cheesecake recipe I've ever made, and I loved it!  I did follow the suggestions of other reviewers and the final product was excellent.  My changes were as follows:  I used an 18.3 oz. Betty Crocker brownie mix (I had nothing smaller on hand), and prepared the batter according to the box directions (I think it was 1/4 C water, 3/4 C vegetable oil, and 2 eggs).  I poured HALF of the prepared brownie batter into the greased springform pan and baked for 12 minutes.  The brownies were no where near done yet of course, but I let them rest on the stove while I prepared the caramel sauce.  I made the sauce according to the recipe with no changes, and it was very tasty.  It did seem a little thin, but it got thicker as it cooled.  I only used about 1/3 of the sauce for the cheesecake.  I poured over the brownies, only in the center of the pan, and then spread it around leaving about a one inch border around the edge.  I let that sit for about ten minutes which gave the caramel time to firm up a bit.  This definitely helped when I poured the cheesecake batter over top, because the caramel didn't run everywhere.  There were some spots where the caramel touched the sides, but I didn't have the problem some other reviewers did with the outer caramel hardening.  Regardless, next time I'll try pouring the cheesecake batter around the edges first and then in the middle to keep the caramel where I want it.  For the actual cheesecake, I followed other people's suggestions a

OMG...So good it's almost ridiculous! I admit I had reservations. Cook the brownie layer for over an hour total? I held out little hope that the brownie would be anything but a rock hard mess, boy was I wrong. What I ended up with was a yummy, gooey, roll your eyes back in your head, delicious dessert that my guests raved about. I had to promise two people I'd make it for their birthdays.

10 Stars!!!!! Wow I was so nervous to make this cheesecake with all the troubles in alot of the reviews. I actually read them all!!! I did cook the brownie for 12 minutes and added oil and a bit more water to the batter. I think next time I will let the brownie sit for a bit to cool before putting the caramel on top of it seeing it did cave into the brownie a bit. I couldnt find the wrapped caramels in the grocery store so I just used caramel sauce. I didnt have a problem with the brownie being over cooked or stuck to the pan. I should have made 2 of these seeing there wasnt a bite left in the pan!! Easy to make.

I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and decreased the cook time of the brownie portion to 10 minutes, which was a mistake as it was defintely not cooked!  So next time I will follow the original recipe and cook the brownie portion for 25 minutes.  I did though increase the cr. cheese to 3 bars, used 3 eggs with 3/4 C. of sugar and 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla and cooked it for 60 minutes in a water bath, which cooked the cheese cake perfectly.  I used a caramel grenache instead of caramel squares  and carnation milk which worked well.

I wish I had read further back in the reviews before making this.  I used a regular brownie box that was 19.5 ounces and it was way too much.  Next time I will use one box of brownie mix for two cheesecakes.  I'll also increase the amount of filling.  This was amazing.  The best cheesecake I've ever had.  For those that are having a problem with a rock hard crust, don't cook it all the way at the beginning.  It'll become overcooked and be crunchy.

I am now a kitchen goddess!  THANK YOU!  Never before have I tried a cheesecake recipe and it turned out wonderful!  Everyone thinks I'm wonderful!  I ended up using 3 packages of cream cheese, and smuckers caramel topping instead of melting the caramels.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe, this is for sure a keeper!

This was very good.  I made it twice once with the hard chocolate on top and the second time with a carmel sauce on top.  I did make the brownies from scratch because I don't make boxed cakes. My customers did seem to like the one with the chocolate better.

Well, delicious. My boyfriend loves cheesecake...me not really much of a fan. However now caramel...I could eat on string beans. This is a wonderful recipe. I did take the advice of others and used the following:
3 pkg-8 oz of cream cheese
3 eggs
3/4 cup white sugar
1 1/2 tsp vanilla
Turn your heat down! 350 is far too high for this...it will crack..not that cracks are not a good place to stach caramel.
One other change next time I would add double the caramel so it looks like the picture. 
My caramel trick for the perfect caramel is to add 4 Tblps of blend to melt the caramels that way they are not hard and they are not to runny when baked with the cheesecake. 
I used the entire 550g box of Betty Crocker Brownies it was perfect just cooked them around 15 minutes first.
Thank you this recipe I will make again.

This recipe was awesome, the cheesecake turned out perfect.  I used some of the suggestions made and am glad I did.  I used 3 8 oz packages of the cream cheese, 3/4 cup sugar, 3 eggs and 1.5 tsp vanilla.  I also used a whole 19.5 ounce brownie mix and baked it for about 17 minutes.  I also put chopped pecans around the edges on top of the brownie layer to keep any caramel from leaking out, which some people said had happened to them.  I will definitely make this again!

This was THE BEST cheesecake I've ever had, by far....advice--follow the brownie directions from the recipe, not from the box.  Only bake the brownie layer 10 minutes....it came out right for me and was absolutely amazing, I probably gained 5 lbs but it was worth it...

This one is a keeper.  My husband and I really liked this and I thought it was so easy to make.  I added 1T of water and 1T or so of vegtable oil to the brownies to avoid the super hard crust that other reviewers complained about.  I also used a store bought carmel sauce and it worked perfect.  I spread the carmel on the brownie but not all the way to the edge of the pan b/c I thought it would stay together better and it did.

This is an AWESOME recipe!  Wonderfully rich and creamy.  Just a little piece of advice...I've been making cheesecake for years and  you NEVER grease a springform pan.  If you gently run a butter knife around the edges of the pan as soon as it comes out of the oven, let it sit and come to room temp, run the knife gently around it again and refridgerate overnight you will have a cheesecake with a perfect look around the edges.

I thought this was an excellent recipe. It was delicious and quick and easy to make. I saw in some other reviews that people had trouble getting the brownie off the bottom of the pan. I accidentally bought a 19 oz. box of brownie mix instead of 9 oz. and made it per the instructions on the box (minus the oil) and I sprayed my springform pan (bottom and sides) liberally with non-stick cooking spray. The brownie part was soft and chewy and came right off the pan with no problem when I flipped the entire cake over onto a plate to transfer to a cake circle. The extra brownie made it even more rich, but I think it was worth it since it was so soft. Definitely a recipe that requires milk!! It was a big hit at my office party.

This tasted fabulous and not too difficult to make.  But presentation was terrible!  The chocolate fudge/caramel topping was very runny and the design didn't stay - it just swirled all together.  The brownie crust was stuck so hard to the pan that most people taking a slice got only the cheesecake top and the brownie was left on the pan!  I used everyone else's suggestions for the crust (10min baking time/300 degree oven/well greased pan) and it still turned out stuck.  Co-workers asked for the recipe but I hesitate in giving it out unless someone has a tip so the brownie layer cuts more easily.  Please help!

This recipe was absolutely fantastic! One of the best I have ever tried. After cooking the brownie portion, I sprayed non-stick spray onto a paper towel and wiped around my spring-form pan, and then coated with chopped pecans. then poured the caramel. This kept the pan from sticking and added a nice nutty edge around the entire cheesecake. Thanks so much!!!

Jackie's right, you will get a lot of compliments on this one. Someone even said it looks and tastes store-bought. I did make some modifications based on other reviewers. I used Jiffy 8oz. mix and only cooked for 10 mins. (next time, I'll cook for 12, it was still a little undone, but not very noticeable). Used 3 pkgs. cream cheese, 3/4 cup sugar, 1 1/2 t. vanilla extract, and 3 eggs. I drizzled the caramel and fudge topping on top, then ran the knife through to make webby designs, looked great! This is definitely one I'll keep making.

I used a turtle brownie mix for the crust (baked it for 12 minutes and used the brownie box instructions for ingredients) Also, I omitted the caramel layer and it turned out great.  Tastes wonderful!  I drizzled chocolate and caramel syrup on top after it cooled and it looked incredible as well.  Also, no cracks in sight.  I think I might follow others' advice and add more cream cheese filling next time, though.

it really was good, didn't look a beauty though...the brownie crust sure needs less cooking, it was hard and stuck to the pan.
I'll do it again anyway, because my hubby and guests said it is heavenly...

I followed the original recipe, except I couldn't find a 9 oz. package of brownie mix; the smallest I could find was 10.5 oz., so I used that instead.  Overall it turned out quite well.  The one problem was that the brownie crust turned out hard or tough in places, especially the edges.  It was difficult to cut the cheesecake, and I broke a plastic spoon while trying to eat it.  I think if I make this again I'll try what other reviewers have suggested -- making the brownie crust as directed on the package.  I think that as is there is not enough moisture in the brownie batter.  That combined with the long baking times makes it tough.  Other than that, it was a pretty good dessert.

made this for a bridal shower-- and it was a knockout! Only one person ventured to have a slice of the bakery ordered cake. Extremely delicious!!

Thank You Heather_0617 - I followed your adjustments as I had three packages of cream cheese plus I didnt want it to be too sweet. Your adjustments made all flavours work perfectly together.

yum!  the brownie layer was a little tough because of the caramel.  I would suggest using a smaller Springform pan so that the brownie is thicker and can absorb the caramel but maintain brownie-ness.

This was good BUT next time I will be making some changes. I used a 10.25 ounce package of brownie mix and I made it per the package directions for cakelike brownies baking it for 15 minutes which next time I'll only bake for 10 and instead just use an extra egg as others suggested. Second, there was too much caramel so next time I'll just use Smuckers caramel and increase the cheesecake by half (3 pkgs cream cheese, 3 eggs, 3/4 cups sugat and 1-1/2 tsp vanilla). Oh and I used chopped pecans on the outside of the caramel layer to prevent the caramel from seeping and used the remainder for topping which next time I'll just use as topping and a technique that others suggested that I used was placing a pan of water under the cheesecake as it baked, it did keep it moist but I'm going to try submerging the pan wrapped with foil next time. Good with a few tweaks. Hope this helps.

WOW! Amazing! I used an 18 ounce Duncan Hines brownie mix and followed the directions on the package rather than on the recipe. I baked it for 12 minutes. The melted caramels were definitely the way to go. I melted them with the evaporated milk in a double broiler. I also used a 10 inch springform pan. I followed other reviews and used 3 - 8 oz cream cheese packs along with 3 eggs, 1 1/2 tsp vanilla, and 3/4 cups sugar. So glad I did that. I spread the remaining caramel on the top and spread the fudge topping on top of that. The brownie crust was a bit difficult to cut and I used a very sharp knife. It tasted fine though. This was a very rich dessert and well worth it!

Very disspointing!  Didn't have a disaster like others did (thanks to everyone who shared their experience, expertise and wisdom) but it simply wasn't good.  Don't get me wrong, it was edible and that's why I gave it three stars.  I did not like the thick, dense consistency of either the brownie nor the cheesecake (reminded me of peanutbutter).  Flavorwise was ok.  I only used half of the caramel called for and it was still too sweet (and by the way, when you pour the caramel, leave one inch clear and free around and then spoon the batter by starting at the edge)  I will not try again, and if I do, I will bake them separately and paste them together with the caramel.

Absolutely delicious! the brownie on the bottom makes a huge difference, although there was a little too much caramel, so I'll remember to add less next time. The brownie should be baked less, according to other suggestions. However, there was too much caramel in between the two layers, and next time, i'll remember to use less. Also the brownies were a little too chewy ( and i normally love chewy brownies! but it just doesn't work as well with cheesecake). It's hard to neatly cut this and serve it, but delicious nonetheless

YUM!   This was a delicious dessert!   Although, I didn't read the 9 oz brownie mix until I had mixed up 19 oz! (standard box).  SO, I doubled te liquid ingredients and went with it.  It turned out great, just a really thick chocolate crust, but how bad could that be!  Thanks for sharing!

I just made this, and it was good but WAY too sweet and rich.  Of course I expect cheesecake to be rich, but this was so sweet it hurt my teeth, and everyone had trouble finishing their pieces (which were not really that big).  It would have been much better if I had used about half the amount of caramel, or even less. Instead of brownie mix, I made the brownie portion from scratch using a separate recipe for brownies.  I cooked it the entire prescribed amount of time, and did not have any problem with it being too hard to cut, as did so many of the other reviewers. That being said, I chilled it overnight, so maybe that helped to put some moisture in it so that it was softer ?  Although not hard, the brownie did have a sort of almost burnt taste to it (though it didn't appear burnt). So I would probably want reduce the cooking time somewhat. I still really like the idea of this recipe, and I really enjoyed making it, so I do think I will make it again but with some changes to make it not so terribly sweet.  I would probably skip the caramel layer in the middle altogether, and just drizzle some caramel on top.  The brownie also may have been a factor in the super-sweetness, so I might look for another brownie recipe that does not use as much sugar.

This was OUTSTANDING!!!  Very rich, good with a tall glass of milk!  This is the first "real" cheesecake I have ever made & I was very worried about the turnout with all the reviews.  I made this for my mother-in-laws surprise party & it was a huge hit!  I followed Kathy's suggestions b/c I couldn't find a 9 or 10oz brownie pkg so I used one I had on hand, 22oz I think.  I used a 10in springform, made my brownie according to pkg directions, baked about 15 minutes (next time I will do a little less).  I used 3 pkgs of cream cheese, 3/4 cups sugar and 3 eggs.  I didn't put any nuts around the edge or anything like that & the caramel didn't leak out.  I was just careful to keep it away from the edge.  I baked the cheesecake for 40ish minutes & it was perfect.  The very bottom edge of the brownies got hard but I think reducing my initial cook time will fix that.  I will definitely be making this again...and again...and again!  :)  Thanks for the recipe!  I've been hanging on to it for nearly a year.  I'm glad I finally got the courage up to give it a try!

Very good. I did up the cheesecake layer to 3 cups of cream cheese 3 eggs 3/4 cup sugar and 1 1/2 t vanilla. I'm glad I did because I think it would have been to thin. I cooked the brownie layer for 15 minutes and when I pulled it out before filling with caramel sauce I pressed down the brownie in the middle making  a well so it didn't over flow. This freezes very well I was unsure because of the caramel layer but when defrosted its still gooey!

Simply amazing.  I made this for our weekly dinner party and everyone raved.  I made the brownie crust using the brownie in a jar recipe from this site.  I used a little more than half for the crust.  I bought dulce de leche instead of melting the caramels. I baked the leftover brownie and while still warm I made shapes with a cookie cutter.  I used these shapes to decorate the cheesecake.  It was not only pretty but a tasty decoration. Thanks for this great recipe.

This recipe did not turn out well for me.  My main problem was the brownie layer.  The finished product was just too gooey.  I followed suggestions from others.... used a 10.5 oz brownie mix, cooked for 15 minutes and cooled slightly before adding the caramel layer and cream cheese layers.  I cooked the cheesecake layer (in a water bath) for 45 mins and it turned out perfect but the brownie layer was a disaster.  It was just too runny.  I was embarassed to serve this to my guests.  Will not make again.

Kathy A was right on with her review.  I followed her additions and it worked out really well.  Only thing to add was she said "regular brownie mix," I bought a 22.5 oz. one and it was great.  Used the nuts around the edge to keep the caramel from sticking, which worked great.  Next time I would sprinkle them over the entire cooked brownie, b/c I did think it could use a little more pizazz.  Next time I'm going jazz up the brownie a little more.  But great recipe!!

This was okay. The center of the brownie was gooey and the caramel layer oozed out. I may try this again using nuts around the edge as someone suggested and maybe using a larger pan so the brownie layer isn't so thick.

I LOVED this cheesecake!!! I made it three times in the past week. I recommend letting the caramel cool before adding the cheesecake. also it works better if you add the toppings to each individual piece instead of putting them on the whole thing

I screwed up the brownie part...I read too many reviews that said not to bake the brownie part for very long.  The middle of the brownie layer was total mush, but still soooooo good.  I think it all depends on the brownie mix you use.  Then again, this stuff could be served w/a cardboard crust and it would still be PHENOMENAL!

Pretty good. We all really liked the brownie crust, but the cheesecake part was just average. Next time I might try the brownie crust with a different cheesecake recipe.

I read many of the reviews, employed several of the recommendations, and still this doesn't work. The brownie bottom never got fully done and the consistency of the cheescake is simply unappetizing- and I've made many cheesecakes so it wasn't from lack of experience. I'd stay away from this one.

This was good, only change I made was to add walnuts to the brownie mixture and I also used the Smuckers Carmel Sauce.  Everyone enjoyed it, but no rave reviews.

I made this for a birthday party and wanted to love it.  The cheesecake portion and caramel came out good but the brownie part came out rock hard. I would love to try this again.  I bought the right size brownie mix, but perhaps I should have bought the bigger mix in the box?

AWESOMELY DELICIOUS!! I am a off-the-wall cheesecake lover and I was looking for a cheesecake I had never made before for a family who also LOVES cheesecake and it was a hit with the whole party. I made 3 thinking I could freeze one for another time but it never mad it to the icebox. I have been requested by a friend to make one for her wedding shower.

This cheesecake is amazing! You only need a very small piece because it is very rich. I used the brownie recipe from the Brownie Bottom Cheesecake from this site because i didn't have a boxed brownie mix. It was very good. I added some pecans to the brownie bottom before baking. I baked it at 300 F for 18 min. I used a 10-inch pan. I followed another reviewers suggestion and baked the cheesecake in a water bath. I baked it for another 40 min. at 300 F. I added chopped pecans to the top of cake before adding the toppings. I used only about a 1/3 cup chocolate topping. I will definately make this again!

Love this recipe!  We used caramels that we can get in Japan and about 4 oz. evaporated milk- they worked great.  Also took others' advice and used 3 packs cream cheese; 3 eggs; 3/4 c sugar; 1 t. vanilla.  Cooked it for 40 minutes at 325 and left it in the oven with the door unopened for an hour.  No cracks- beautiful.  When I pulled it out and ran a knife around it, it released from the sides perfectly.  A great recipe!

Tasted oh so good. Did make alot of changes, I used a pillsbury dough brownie mix that had chucks of chocolate in it (it was good brownie mix!!!) I baked it for about 15 minutes. I let things cool before layering so they wouldn't all mix together. I lined the outside of pan with foil and put in a "bath". But I honestly can't remember how long I cooked it for I think I followed the cheesecake tips. It got ate, fast. The only reason I'm not giving it a 5 star is cuz all the changes.

Too dense and heavy for my taste, but DD LOVED IT!  If I make again, I will bake brownie a bit longer and maybe use a 9" square pan instead of a round with 2 x cheesecake filling for more balance.

I have tried this recipe twice. The first time as I had just come back from Canada I had caramels in the house, I did as recipe stated, only changes I made was the brownie bottom and only cooked it 10 mins. Now when you "reserve" some of the caramel mix DO NOT PUT IN A CONTAINER THAT MELTS..I made the mistake and left it in the measuring cup, it went hard when I left it sitting..had terrible time re-softening it. After I did manage to remelt more caramels, and put it on, after refrideration the caramel was very runny after removing cake from pan. I also used a bath and unfortunatly a bit of the water must have leaked in cos bottom was a bit soggy on one side. so the first attemp was about a 3 out of 5, but husband LOVED IT...I did it again the other night, as we can not get caramels here in UK, I used caramel condensed milk..WHAT A DIFFERENCE...again I cooked the base for only 10 mins adding a bit of oil to brownie mix, I also used 300g packages of cream cheese (about 10.5 oz each) so only used 2 as recipe stated but was 20oz not 16. It did crack this time but obviously I left it too long, BUT it did not leak caramel all over like last time, much easier to make, and cut and was served without falling to bits...so I will not use caramels any more( not like I have choice anyway) I actually enjoyed eating  it the 2nd time around, and husband says recipe is a keeper.

This is a very good recipe HOWEVER the dilemma that I have is I cannot get the 9oz. package of brownie mix in my area.  Is there a way to adapt or adjust the browie recipe/mix? If so, your hints would be welcomed! Otherwise, love it, and everyone who has it loves it!

I have made this recipe well over 20 times and have recieved marriage proposals everytime.  I have used both dark and light springform pan and it works better with the light. I also use chocolate squeeze ice cream topping for decorating the top instead of the fudge. It is great! I highly recommend this recipe.

This was my first time making cheesecake and it turned out lovely! I did read the comments prior and cut down on the baking of the brownie to 10 minutes. i also let it refrigerate overnight. otherwise i followed the recipe exactly.  next time i will make less caramel because the cheesecake is so rich that i don't need to drizzle any on the top.

This was the hit of Thanksgiving dinner and has been requested again for Christmas.  Simple to make and tastes great.  I had to adjust the cooking time for the brownie bottom because when you cook it by itself for the suggested time and then again once you add the cheesecake, the brownie becomes hard and burnt around the edges.  The second time I made it I reduced the cooking time for the brownie to 10 minutes and it came out close to perfect.

This recipe is really good, but it is also very time comsuming. I never had problems with the hard brownie as others mentioned, but if you undercook the brownie, its very runny. On my second attempt it turned out much better. Worth the work, but might not be ideal if you have never made cheesecake before.

The top of it was yummy and everyone seemed to like it but the bottom brownie part was VERY hard and I was shaking trying to cut through it.

Second time I made - awesome.
I used a 8 inch spring form pan instead of the 9 inch.  When I used the 9 in originally caramel seeped through the cream cheese batter and gave it un ugly appearance.  (I did have to cook the the cheesecake a little longer in the second cooking step) Also, I cooked the brownie for shorter time and I put some chocolate chips in the brownie for extra chocolate.  I sprinkled chopped pecans on top of the caramel layer and then again on top of the cake.  Delicious and beautiful!  No problem using 1 fat free and 1 low fat cream cheese.

GREAT!  Super rich and sweet, just what I love.  Next time I will cook browine about 10-15 min.  It was good, but alittle less would be best.  I may try caramel syrup to make prep easier unwrapping and cooking caramel is a pain along with the clean up.  DON'T miss out, try this.  Mine came out of the pan and looked perfect!

OH MY GOSH! I thought this was SO YUMMY but my husband said it was a bit too many flavors and too rich for his taste, but his taste is VERY SIMPLE. It did seem to be "less rich" the next day after sitting in the fridge over night. If you are into several layered RICH desserts, this is for you! I did only cook the brownie crust for 10 minutes as many others have done and it was soft and chewy. I made one for a friend and she LOVED it. She said it was the best dessert she has ever had and her husband thought the same! Another friend was over and had a taste and LOVED it so I sent him home with a piece and his wife called asking for the recipe saying it was THE BEST cheesecake she has ever had! She said her sister is a cheesecake fanatic and she wanted to make one for her birthday. This was a huge hit with everyone except for my husband but his tastes are SO simple.

This was definitely not my favorite cheesecake.  The brownie crust was too chewy and it was a mess to cut.  It looked beautiful, though!

I've made this twice and both times I've burnt the brownies on bottom. The cheesecake part is great and I think it will be great as soon as I can figure out how to not burn it.  :)

I followed some suggestions from others, baked the brownie for 12 minutes, used LaLachera caramel spread, 3 packages of cream cheese, 3 eggs, 3/4 cup sugar and 2 tsp vanilla.  Baked for 40 minutes then left in oven for 1 hour. Family raved over it.

Based on the other reviews, I was afraid to over bake the brownie, so I baked it for 15 min. I actually used a jar of caramel instead of making it and had no running out or sticking problems. I increased the cheesecake layer ingredients by 1/3. Baked it all for about 55 minutes - it turned out great! Only thing I would change is to bake it a little longer - again, I was afraid the brownie would get hard! It maybe needed another 5-10 minutes? DELICIOUS!!

I was so excited to make this....
DISASTROUS is an understatement. 
Brownie was undercooked...took advice of others and never fully cooked...even after 60 min, brownie was still raw, cheese cake, brownie and caramel ended up all combining together....it looked so unappetizing...leather looking.

After reading the reviews I was nervous but gave it a try. Glad I did! Used the 10oz  brownie mix and made according to package instructions,  but only cooked 17 of the 25 minutes.  I may try even less next time as the edges were too tough to eat, but the middle was perfect.  I increased the cheesecake layer per other reviews. Baked with pan of water. Left in the oven after shutting heat of for an hour then on the counter for 2 hours,  then the fridge.  No cracks!  Will definitely make again. .. and may try 13x9 brownie mix for thicker layer.

made as directed. The only suggestion I would make is to not spread the caramel all the way to the edges of the brownie before dumping the cheesecake mixture on it - maybe even making a moat. I found that the outside edges were quite hard and chewy due to the caramel baking to the sides of the pan. Most certainly did not see the caramel layer once cut but it was still a winner

Excellent recipe! I took the suggestions of most reviewers by adding an extra cream cheese package, cut out some sugar also. I refrigerated the cake overnight and it set perfectly. No oozing caramel. One of the most crowd pleasing cakes I have ever made. Very decadent. I would definitely make again.

I made a brownie mix(Ghirardelli Caramel Turtle) for 9 x9 pan and baked for 15 min. Also, did the 3 cream cheese with 3 eggs and 3/4 cup sugar and vanilla.I made the 9" springform pan. 
It was awesome!

Time consuming but worth it.  Used a 10.5 brownie mix and used 2 eggs (called for 1).  Baked for 15 minutes as it wasn't cooked through earlier.  Placed pecans on top of the brownie mix before pouring on the caramel, which stopped any seepage.  Followed the 3 packs cream cheese etc. recipe from a previous reviewer and the filling turned out great.  Baked for an hour and left in the closed oven for over 2.  Chilled for 4-5 hours.  Got great reviews from guests but make sure you have plenty of time to make, it takes a while!

Because a friend saw this recipe and was set on me making this, I went ahead with it even though the reviews called for a lot of revisions and others were just negative reviews. I made the brownies as the package directed and reduced the time to about 8 minutes as to try to prevent burning. Unfortunately, the brownie still turned out burnt to a crisp. Also following reviews, I tweaked the cheesecake recipe part, which did turn out good. But really, I can't honestly say that this recipe as written works out.

OMGosh!!! This was AMAZING!!! Made the brownies per the package directions. Baked @ 350 for 12 minutes. I made the caramel with Kraft Caramel bits (too lazy to unwrap the caramels!) and approx 4  oz of evaporated milk. Cheesecake as directed. Baked in a water bath for 45 minutes (cheesecake temp should be 160-165 degrees), turned oven off and left it in the oven for 30 minutes. Placed in freezer to chill about one hour. I will be making this again!!!

this was a very easy cheesecake to make. The only thing that I changed was to use the jiffy brownie mix. The crust turned out perfect. This is a very tasty cheesecake and have had several requests to make again. I did not use all the caramel mixture as directed.. so I cut up apples and used as an apple dip. Very yummy.

Everyone loved this recipe. I added mini chocolate chips to the layer of caramel between the brownie and cheesecake. I also used 3 packages of cream cheese and increased the sugar and vanilla. It was amazing!! I also sprinkled pecans and mini chocolate chips to the top to give it extra umph. Definately a huge hit with the family. They are all asking for it again!

i agree with all of the reviewers who suggested preparing the brownie mix according to package directions.  i also used president's choice dulce de leche spread instead of caramels and evaporated milk; simple and delicious.  i baked the cake for forty five minutes and then left it in the oven for two hours.  perfection.  and no cracks!

I really wanted to like this one.  It looked and sounded so delicious.  I followed the directions exactly and it didn't turn out at all.  The cheesecake layer didn't stick to the brownie layer at all.  For all the time and effort I put into making it was just not worth it.

Oh, my gosh this was good and mine turned out as pretty as a picture!  I made a 10 oz brownie mix and mixed as the package directions.  I think my secret was using an 8" springform pan.  I baked the brownie bottom for about 20 min.  I followed the rest of the recipe as written.  My caramel did not run and the chessecake part was perfect.  I will be baking this as my new dessert to impress!

This was the most amazing thing I think I have ever eaten! I did use sugar free brownies and as others suggested I only cooked the brownies by themselves for 10 min., otherwise I think the crust would have been too hard.

The concept of this cheesecake is great, it did taste pretty good, but the cheesecake layer left something to be desired. I used Bombshell brownies from this site (scaled to 6 servings), and the carmel sauce was great, but the cheesecake, not so good. I'll probably try this recipe again, but using a different cheesecake recipe for the top.

I followed most of the suggestions by baking the crust for only 15 minutes. Instead of making the carmel mixture, I bought some carmel topping and used that instead. The layer of cream cheese right above the carmel came out a lil funny. Wish I would've followed that part of the recipe or omitted the carmel.

I made this cheesecake for my co-workers and they love it.  The only thing I did different is put the brownie cheesecake in the springpan then submerge it in boiing water while it cooked.  It kept the brownie moist.

This cake is delious! Even if your not a  chocolate person like me, but it's worth the try. Next time I'll make the bottom be a blondie instead of a brownie because I found the brownie bottom to be very overpowering. I added nuts and they made this even better, more caramel sauce is a must!

this recipe was amazing! i made the bottom brownie base with my own homemade brownie recipe as opposed to the box because i figured it would come out hard after being baked and then baked again.  everyone loved and i will definitely be making this again!  thank you for the recipe jackie :]

Excellent Cheesecake eventhough I just knew that the brownie crust was going to be hard and gummy but I was totally surprised. It was perfect. The only thing that I was not crazy about was the thiness of the caramel in between the crust and cheesecake. Next time I will double that. I will also double the amount of cheesecake I thought that layer was a little slim. Other than that it was a happy ending to a great meal. Thanks!

I really wanted to love this but it was a total disaster.  I'm not a master cheesecaker but I've made many successful cheesecakes in the past, so it isn't like I'm completely clueless or anything.  I followed a lot of recommendations (and I'm glad I did): added half to the cheesecake part, cooked the crust longer, used a little less caramel.  The crust was great--not too hard at all.  The biggest problem was that the caramel crept up the side of the pan, making the top of the cake look hideous.  But even worse, once the cake cooled, that caramel was like super glue!  I couldn't even get my springform pan to open.  Once I did, it just tore the cake apart.  I love the idea of this cheesecake and the taste was great.  Next time, I'll skip the inside caramel layer and just add caramel to the top.

I only gave this recipe 3 stars because i found it a little hard to cut and get out of the pan.  And although it was very tasty it was very sweet and i could not finish even a small piece.

family really enjoyed this recipe.  i personally didnt think it was that great and the reason is that the crust was mushy and i havent figured out how to prevent that with cheesecakes.  also, the caramel layer sticks to the sides of the pan making it difficult to get out.  easy recipe though.

Followed the recipe as written but reduced the time the brownie crust initially was cooked.  It took us 10 minutes to cut pieces and we tried 3 different knives.  It was so embarrassing.  The taste was good.  Will not be making this again.

Loved this recipe!! Only problem was the middle caramel layer made the cheesecake a little over the top and too rich. Maybe just having all the caramel mixture on top along with the hot fudge topping would be a little better. Overall, great for an aching sweet tooth!!

Can you say Yumm? I'm not a huge plain cheescake person (I don't love cream cheese) but I liked this alot. It's the first cheesecake I've ever made and it came out perfect. I ate it when it was still warm, and I think ti will be alot better today because it will be set all the way. Great Recipie. Next time I might try flavoring the cheesecake itself, maybe with chocolate swirls, etc.

I used 3 cups of cream cheese, 3 eggs, 3/4 cup sugar and 1 1/2 t vanilla and that made a perfect cheese layer.  I cooked the brownie layer for 15 minutes.  Next time I will use a bit less caramel because it was slightly rich when you add the drizzle on top.

Outrageously, ridiculously rich and delicious! I wasn't quite sure what to expect from the layer of caramel, but it was wonderful - just kind of melded with the brownie layer. My Peruvian amorcito - who is not a lover of caramel - suggested that next time I substitute dulce de leche, which sounds good and would be easier than melting all those caramels. But again, as it stands, it's amazing!

I think I read too many reviews! I followed a few tips , 3 packs of cream cheese , pecans around the edge to keep the caramel from spilling out. It looked amazing , no one believed I made it . My only complaint is that after 20 minutes of cooking the brownie and then another 55 minutes of cooking the cream cheese the brownie was still totally raw , which made it hard to cut , but it was yummy!

I have made this cheesecake a couple times, and my family absolutely loves it.  Being somewhat health conscious, though, I try to make it as low fat as possible using 1 pkg  Betty Crocker low-fat brownie mix combined with 1/2 cup water (instead of egg and Tbsp water), fat-free evaporated milk, 2 pkgs of light cream cheese (Neufchatel), and 2 egg equivalent of egg replacer.  I have yet to make it with fat free cream cheese or Splenda, but I think I may try it next time.  My husband, who loves caramel desserts, goes crazy for this cheesecake and cannot believe it is made with the low-fat version of the ingredients.

We loved this cheesecake! I only have a 10 inch springform pan, so I used that. I made my own brownie for the 'crust', (Quick and Easy Brownie, scaled to 15 servings, baked for 25 mins).  I used a bag of Kraft Caramel Bits so I didn't have to unwrap caramels.  I increased the cheesecake portion as recommended by other reviewers, especially since I was using an even bigger pan. I decided to make it a day ahead to make sure it had time to chill sufficiently.  Awesome dessert that I will make again!

This did NOT work out well for me! The brownie was hard and would not cut, along with the caramel, which was super sticky and equally difficult to cut. I followed the top reviewers and still wound up with a heavy, hard, mess of a cheesecake. Maybe I did something wrong? I'm not sure.

This recipe sounded and looked so delicious, but I should have listened to other reviewer's advice that it was not was I was looking for. The brownie crust was too thick, and the cheesecake layer was not thick enough.  I have definitely had better cheesecake bases as well.  Next time, I will stick with the Turtle Cheesecake recipe on this site with oreo crust.

Excellent!  Take extra care to run a knife around the edge between the cake and the pan as the carmel and brownie turn a little candied.  Tastes great and comes with compliments.

This is the best cheesecake ever!! My whole family loved it. Instead of carmels i used resees peanut butter chips and left out the fudge topping and used the left over peanut butter mixture. Delicious :)

This is a delicious cheesecake with the recommended changes made.  I followed other people's advice and used 3 8 oz packages of cream cheese, 3/4 cup of sugar, and followed the brownie box recipe.  This is a great cake, but it is a little hard to cut.  The caramel hardens and makes it hard to cut, but the taste makes up for that difficulty.  I loved this!  I am selling it at a fund raiser per slice.  I can't wait to hear the feedback!

I'm crazy about cheesecake, this one is so good and rich!!! I used a 10.5 oz brownie mix (was all I could find) and made it to package directions. I topped it with Smucker's hot caramel topping and added the cheesecake topping (used the 3 pkgs of cream cheese etc.) After baking a left the cheesecake in the oven as suggested. It turned out great. Thanks for posting this recipe!

Wonderful recipe! Delish! This cheesecake was wonderful,everyone thought that I purchased it for Easter dessert, but I didn't.  The only problem I had was that the cheesecake stuck to the pan after it cooled, but otherwise this recipe is a keeper.

WOW! I make cheesecake several times a year...I am not allowed to attend a family gathering without bringing one...but I think this is the best I've made! I kept an eye on the brownie crust after reading all the reviews. I couldn't find a small pack so I think I used about 10-11 ounce. I ended up letting it bake about 15-20 minutes. I think we could have used about 1/2 of the caramels because we had a good bit left over after drizzling. I will definitely make this one again! Delicious!!

This is a fantastic recipe and super easy to make. My only problem (every time I make it), is that I cant quite figure out how to keep the carmel from hardening around the sides of the pan when baking. I cant quite get the crust to go up around the sides of the pan, so the carmel gets a bit hard on the edges. BUT everywhere you take this, people will ask for the recipe!

OK, I decided this review needs to be broken down by layers.  The brownie layer-too chewy and hard- and I only baked 15 minutes.  I think a chocolate cookie crust would be better here because most reviewers seem to complain about the brownie's toughness.  The carmel layer adds to the chewiness of the brownie which makes it almost impossible to cut, I think a light carmel sundae syrup would work better here.  The cheesecake layer - perfect; although I did increase it to 3 pkgs cream cheese,3 eggs,3/4 sugar and 1.5 t. vanilla, used a 10" springform and baked for 55 minutes in a water bath (no cracks-yeah). Although all the layers were really tasty, I felt like I needed a chain saw to cut through the bottom.  This recipe as written is definately off.  I will make again because the taste is really good, but it will need some tweaking.

I loved this recipe!! I used a larger brownie mix, I think it was 20.5 oz and only cooked for 17 min.  I let it cool for about 20 minutes before putting the caramel on top.  Then I added a layer of pecans.  I doubled the cheesecake recipe and cooked that for about 50 minutes.  I did get a big crack in my cheesecake which I wasn't thrilled about but after I swirled it with hot fudge and more pecans it was hidden.  Everything was cooked perfectly, the cheesecake texture was wonderful and the brownie was not too hard. Next time I will try the water bath trick.  This was good though!! I got a ton of compliments!!

Love this one and will make time and time again. The important thing is to really make sure you use only 9 oz of brownie mix. I skipped out on the caramel/evap milk and used a can of Dulce de Leche (or you can use Lecheria). It's an old trick I picked up here years ago and highly suggest it. I also swirled the top with some German bakers chocolate that I just happened to have.

Delicious!

This is the best dessert I have ever made! I made it twice in one week (one for family; one for work) and both groups raved about it. One coworker even said it was better than the special order cheesecake his catering company used to order when he worked there.  He was very impressed.  The brownie bottom was very nice with the cheesecake.  The best advice I can give is, the more time you let the caramel harden, the better.  The first time I made it the caramel sat longer and the cheesecake was easy to spread on top.  The second time the caramel didn't sit as long and it was hard to spread the cheesecake.  The caramel oozed up the sides, but I covered it up with cheesecake and it was still fabulous.  I used the advice of another person and made more cheesecake (3 cream cheese, 3 eggs, 3/4 suger, 1 tsp vanilla).  Based on the amount of cheesecake I had to work with using three, I can't imagine the original recipe makes enough.

I have made this recipe many times, and people are always impressed.  In fact, most people think that i bought it insead of made it!  I agree with increasing the cream cheese, i always want more of the cheesecake layer.

cooked the brownie layer as stated, but it became really hard...i could see just using caramel topped in a squeeze-bottle rather than going through the trouble of baby-sitting melting caramels...overall, not a great cheesecake.

I made this for my daughter's birthday at her request, I took one bite and I thought that it was amazing, I used Duncan Hines family style brownie mix following the directions on back of box for the chewy brownies, Then I followed the recipe as written. It turned out great! Definately a keeper! (I saw somewhere that if you dip your knife in warm water and wipe dry, it will make cutting your cheesecake much easier to cut.)Thanks for a great recipe!!

Delicious!! I found the boxed Jiffy brownies at the grocery store and that worked great. I took the advice of others and didn't use as much caramel as the recipe called for, and I'm glad I did. It was super rich and super delicious!

Pretty good.  I made this for a Thanksgiving dessert this year.  The only problem I had with it was that the brownie crust was a bit overcooked and hard to cut through, since it has to go into the oven twice.  It was still a hit, and I will try it again!

I used a brownie recipe from this site and not a box mix. I baked it for 10 minutes like other users.
The ONLY problem I found with this recipe is the application of the caramel mixture. When the heck is one supposed to put it over the brownies and when is one supposed to pour cheesecake part over it? Do I wait until the caramel is completely cool? I ended up with a layer of brownie floating on a layer of caramel instead of a caramel center. Bah. It was still tasty though. the caramel sauce is awesome.

Thanks to others' suggestions, this cheesecake came out perfectly, and this was my first attempt at a cheesecake and using a springform pan!!! I greased the pan well, used an approx. 10 oz brownie mix, prepared as directed on the package, and cooked that for 15 minutes. Melting the caramels with 5 oz evaporated milk creates a good consistency. Fearing that the caramel would scorch if it seeped out from between the layers, I only poured enough so that it didn't reach the edge of the brownie layer and the pan (and this did prevent any problems that may have arised). I let the caramel cool for a bit before putting the cream cheese mixture on top of it. I then cooked the entire thing about 50-60 minutes on a lower heat (partly b/c my oven is hot); I did not use a water bath, but put a pan of water on the rack below. Although it cracked a bit around the edges, it was not noticeable w/ the caramel and chocolate on top and this did not affect the taste. Taste and presentation were phenomenal!!!

This is better than The Cheesecake Factory's cheesecake!!! My husband made this for a dessert competition and won!! The only thing he changed was the brownie baking time. He baked the brownie for 17 mins. Everyone thought he bought this cheesecake. This is a keeper!! He did not have any problems with his caramel center. Thanks for a great recipe!!

This was excellent, but it stuck to the bottom of my pan very badly. So this time I will try to put a small piece of "renyolds wrap release" on the bottom of the pan. But it is worth making!

This recipe turned out amazing! The best cheesecake I've ever had! One thing I would do differently is not make as much caramel... it doesn't need it. You can make this! It may seem hard but if I can, you can.

Delicious!  I've made this cake three times in the past two months, and it was amazing every time.  I did make a few adjustment, though, similar to the ones other people have mentioned.  I used a 10.5 oz brownie mix, and instead of adding 1 egg and 1 tbsp water I just followed the recipe on the brownie mix.  I also added chocolate chips to the brownies, which helped keep the brownie crust moist.  Like everyone else, I only cooked the brownie for 10 minutes.  Also, I didn't use all of the caramel mixture because it was a bit too much.  I definitely recommend this!

This was my first ever cheesecake attempt and it turned out ok. Not very attractive because I messed up the topping a bit, but it tasted great. 
I know how to do it a bit better next time and I think it will be even better then. My husband especially loved it. Was fun to make too. Love the caramel layer!
Oh and I did the suggested 10 mins for brownie and extra creamcheese adjustments. Base and caramel were nice and soft.
Thanks for the recipe!

This is awesome.  I'm a cheesecake connoisseur - the cheesecake was very good with a nice consistency.  I made the suggested changes to the recipe: 3 8 oz. packs cream cheese, 3/4 c. sugar and 1.5 tsp. vanilla.  I also used about 2/3 of a regular Duncan Hines 19 oz. brownie mix and baked it for 12 minutes.  The cake was hard to get out of the pan only because it's so gooey (chocolatey and caramel).  It wasn't the least bit hard or overcooked.  Once I added the caramel and cheesecake, I baked it for another 50 minutes.  Next time, I'll use the entire brownie box and bake a little longer - maybe 20 minutes, and add more caramel, and try a water bath.  I only used about 1/2 of the melted caramel.  It was so good - I couldn't help myself from having a (small) piece with my coffee this morning!

This is a rockin cheesecake and I definately give it 5 stars. I do recommend baking the brownie for like 10-12 minutes instead of the recommended or what is on the box. Mine came out a little hard on the bottom and it's because I baked it too long. But everything else was right on the money! ENJOY!

I was sooo excited to try this recipe.  My friend and I were on a cheesecake making frenzy, and baked several in an afternoon.  This one was probably the most tedious, and came out the worst.  I followed others suggestions and used less cond milk so it would not come out runny, but instead the caramel layer was rock hard, especially after going into frig.  If I were to make again, I think I would just use the caramel sause that comes in a jar, or at very least I would use all the condensed milk that recipe calls for.

Very good.  Warning it doesn't seem as if the recipe will work because the layers seem to get mixed up as you pour the caramel and the cream cheese, but it magically separated in the oven.  Also the caramel layer seemed a bit runny- I will be reducing the amount of condensed milk the next time I make this.

I'm giving this only 3 stars.  It was alot of work and the taste was just "ok".
 Also, all the brownie mixes are 19-24 ounces (not 9 ounces as the recipe states) Maybe that's why some other reviewers said the brownie was very hard. I used 19 oz. mix, added two eggs and two tbsp.water. and the brownie stayed moist.
Would not make again.

This was OK. To me, it was good, but was A LOT of work! I have made other equally as good desserts that are WAY easier. If you don't mind the time and effort....it was great...go for it!

I used a large brownie mix (Ghiradelli), baked for only 10 minutes-- perfect texture.  The caramel layer was a mess.  It oozed everywhere when I poured the cheesecake on top of it. I swirled the caramel into the cheesecake so it would look as if I had planned it that way! The cheesecake tasted great but the two layers fell apart when sliced so it was as if we had two desserts on our plate-- a brownie and a cheesecake.  Not necessarily a bad thing but not like regular cheesecake.  If I make this again, I would probably leave the caramel out altogether, and maybe put some chocolate chips into the cheesecake mix.  Also I was concerned about it sticking to the pan, but I sprayed the pan really well and had no problem getting it out.

I was a little disappointed with this recipe as I was kind've hoping for a cake layer on the bottom and than the cheesecake mixture on top.  All in all, it was a big hit at the Birthday party it was taken to.  Will definetly make again, but maybe with a few of my own modifications for my own taste!  It definetly doesn't hurt to experiment with a recipe

This is the best recipe! I made it for my family and then braught the rest in my work. EVERYONE Loved it!!! All I did differently was used a smaller, but deeper springform pan. And taking the creamcheese out of the fridge before cooking makes it so much easier.

Thank you CHERI63MI!  I used a twix brownie mix and omitted the cookies that came with it.  I followed the directions on the box and baked it for 20 minutes.  I took your advice, along with others, and used 3 cream cheeses, 3/4 c. sugar, 1.5 tsp. vanilla and 3 eggs.  This came out perfect!!  My final baking time was 40 minutes on the dot!!  Great recipe!!!  Thanks all!!!

I was disappointed in this recipe.  The caramel left a very sticky mess in my springform pan, and there was not enough cheesecake on top from the two packages used.  The resulting cheesecake did taste good.  The main problem was the cake was not very pretty, but rather a sticky mess.

The entire family loved it!  I am, however, going to try some of the other suggestions, as I had a difficult time getting it out of the springform pan.  Maybe too much caramel?  Anyway, LOVED the recipie and if jackie has any more of these up her sleeve, let me know!!!  Thanks!

This was a big hit!  Changes I made, as some other suggested:  used 10.25 Betty Crocker Smart Size brownie, baked 15 minutes. (this was thick, like a paste and I had a hard time spreading it in the pan!  But it was worth the hassle...), and I also reserved 2/3 cup of the caramel.  Tasted wonderful, looked elegant!  A definate keeper!!

This was excellent!  I used 2 Neufchatel cheese to cut the fat a bit, and only used a little chocolate syrup on top of the cake instead of the additional caramel.  I added some chocolate chips to my "jiffy" brownie mix to make it even more chocolatey.  Yummy recipe!

For the most part, this cheesecake was very good.  However, the caramel filling flowed over the edge of the brownie crust, and subsequently scorched.  I had to cut off about an inch of the outer layer from each slice in order for it to be remotely edible.  And it made a huge mess in my springform pan.

what a good combination.  It was a little hard to take the cheesecake out of the pan, though.  The caramel got stuck to the sides.  I used caramel apple flavored caramels for a little twist.

Well i coudn't find a 9 oz.pk,i went ahead and bought a bigger box of brownie mix.I read "some" reviews before i started the recipe and was a bit nervous about the part of the crust turning out hard or being under cooked.I did take the advice of baking the brownie batter for 10 or 15 minutes before adding the other mixture.But the brownie was still runny,so i figured that once i added the cream cheese mixture and baked it for 30 minutes more it would finish baking but it didn't!The top was cooked but the brownie layer was still very undercooked in the middle and the crust was hard.I gotta say i'm not giving up ,maybe i missed a better tip since i didn't get to read all the reviews.I will try this recipe again,until i figure it out.Besides the problem i had with this recipe,I gotta say it was still delicious!I can imagine how much better it can taste if the brownie didn't come out runny.Yum!So don't get me wrong I still enjoyed it,before you do this recipe keep reading  more reviews maybe you will find something I missed.

I was really hoping to like this recipe because it combined my three favorite things. Unfortunately, I had the hardest time with this recipe.  The caramel bubbled up and out of the pan.  The caramel made the brownie crust soggy.  The cheesecake bit was good though!

I only cooked the brownie mix for 10 minutes as several people suggested and although I knew it wasn't completely cooked I went ahead and finished the recipe and baked it in a warm water bath as suggested figuring it would finish cooking.  It didn't.  The brownie layer was gooey.  I will try this recipe again, but will make sure the brownie layer is fully cooked the next time.  Also, I had such a hard time finding caramels.

Adding 1  Tbs. of water there wasn't enough liquid so I could spread it in the bottom of the pan, consequently I used the regular brownie mix ingredients.  Also, I went to five different markets trying to find the carmels, no one had them so I substituted Caramel/Butterscotch topping and fudge topping which worked out great and much easier.  The taste was great, but mine had too much brownie at the bottom, maybe I used the wrong size mix.  Bettie R.

I didnt have any problem with the brownie bottom. I went ahead and used a 8x8 pan size box of brownie mix, following the directions on the back of the box, and only cooked it for 10 minutes before adding the cream cheese mixture. It turned out great!

This cheesecake was a snap to prepare, although I did follow the directions 
exactly, and the brownie part was pretty tough to cut through. I'd suggest that 
you follow the recipe of the brownie mix (since the package I used called for 
adding oil, which I omitted since it wasn't in the directions.) Also, I'd bake the
 brownie layer for about 10 minutes (which someone else suggested) instead
 of the full time. Tasted fantastic, though!

This recipe was pretty easy to make I would suggest omitting the center layer of Carmel it is a little to sweet if you put it in.  My fiance has a huge sweet tooth and made as it says to was too much for the man who can eat chocolate for all three meals plus snacks.

I thought this cheesecake was wonderful.  My family loved it.  The combination of browine crust with the carmel,then the plain cheesecake on top. If you love cheesecake this recipe is for you.

This was OUTSTANDING! I forgot to get the fudge topping so instead I sprinkled chocolate chips on top of the cheesecake part before putting it in the oven. I also couldn't find a 9 oz. brownie mix so I just used a Betty Crocker one (made the brownie part according to the box's directions) and split it between two pans. All of my guests wanted this recipe and I will definitely make this in the future. I don't have kids so I don't know if they would like it because it was so rich. But my oh my was this divine!

OK, I've been baking this for some time. Everyone loves it. Made some modifications. Didn't use any brownie mixes but made a real brownie out of eggs, flour and chocolate. Since it is already very rich, I omit the caramel layer to give everyone a breather. Still a very powerful cheesecake to contend with. Will tame any rabid cheesecake eater.

This cheesecake was easy to make although with the time recommended for cooking it, it developed a large crack.  I would suggest cooking it less.  It tasted great and everyone loved it.

This was a tasty cheesecake.  The carmel held up well, but be careful not to put too much carmel over the base.  If it overflows, the edge becomes carmelized and difficult to cut.  The brownie base was a little hard and crunchy.

I love this recipe. I make it for my restaurant  as a special. It sells out fast and people ask for it all the time. I make it in a spring form pan and cook the brownie layer for about 8 minutes. If you want a easy delicious and elegant dessert, this is it!!!

I just made these for the first time and was quite pleased.   They look like they were professionally made - so pretty.  I followed the instructions pretty closely.  I did add a tsp of All Spice as someone suggested to the pumpkin mixture, and I did try freezing my cream cheese mixture.   That didn't go as well as planned.   I think I'll try the sandwich bag tip next time.  I love pecans so next time I plan to double the amount of pecans.   But seriously - what a great recipe.   A little bit of work, but well worth it!  I brought them to work and they were a hit!  Even my picky teenager approved.

Very good.  I added another 1/4 c of sugar and I found that letting it sit for 2 days before eating is best.  It gives a chance for the flavors to marry and is delicious.

I made mine in a 10" spring form. 
Kraft Caramels come in 11oz pkg. Plenty of sauce even for those who added a lot to their plate. 
Definitely make 1 1/2 recipe. 24 oz cream cheese, 3/4 C sugar, 1 1/2 tsp vanilla and 3 eggs.
That being said I would definitely make my Brownies cake like with the 3 eggs and bake 20 minutes. fudge recipe is a mess once caramel is poured on.

You would need to let the caramel set  a little before you pour in the cheese cake mix. Otherwise you get a small thin area of
caramel where you pour. Also I reduced the  amount of  sugar 
by half. The brownie mix and caramel are sweet enough .
My family loved it. Great recipe.

I wish I would have read the comments as well and cooked the brownie crust for half the time. Despite that this is a delicious recipe and the first cheesecake I have ever made. It did not last long.
Is there a way the recipe can be changed to reflect that so others do not have the same problem?

Flavors are amazing.  I tried baking the crust for only 10 minutes after reading reviews.  It was still pretty hard around the edges.  Maybe next time I will use a little less of the brownie mixture to keep the crust slightly thinner.

I made this as mini cheese cakes for a work Christmas Party. it turned out excellent! I used Ghirardelli Salted Carmel Brownie mix, only about half the mix as it's a 16oz package and the recipe is for a 9oz. I went ahead and made the caramel sauce but I thin you could probably use the sauce that is included with the brownies as a short cut. I cut cooking times in half for the mini cheesecakes as well.

First I didn’t notice I picked up a brownie mix over the 9ounces. I decided to try and half the dry mix and add one tablespoon of water. It was super dry so I just kept adding water till the consistency was better. Next time I will make the mix as directed on the box and just use some for the base and then bake the remainder in some  molds. I then baked the base for ten minutes. Unwrapping, melting and cooking the Carmel’s took a long time. Next time I will use a can of dulce de leche. I poured on the Carmel sauce hoping it wouldn’t leak out. It did so I put a pan under the cheesecake to catch the drippings and save cleaning my oven. I am hoping the dulce de leche is thicker and won’t leak out next time. The cheesecake layer was also thin. I would also recommend to double the cream cheese, eggs and sugar. The baking time of 40 minutes was a little too long. It wasn’t burnt but fully set and brown on the edges. Should have pulled it out sooner. The end product was supper yummy. Everyone raved over it. I would definitely make again. Just with the few alterations mentioned.

I had no trouble making this cheesecake. I followed suggestions in other reviews and used the 10.5 oz. brownie mix, baked it 19 minutes, which worked fine. I also cut the evaporated milk to 1/4 cup and the caramel mixture was just right. I also increased the cream cheese to three 8-oz packages. The cheesecake turned out fine except for the taste. It simply doesn't appeal to me. I ate part of one piece and trashed the rest. I won't eat any more.

Everyone loved it.  I made the brownie layer according to the brownie package directions using one egg, vegetable oil, and water.  It included walnuts in the mix.  I baked it for 15 minutes.  I made the caramel layer and the cheesecake layer as directed in the original recipe.   Ending with chocolate and caramel drizzled on each piece.  It turned out great.  I'll definitely make it again.

It was good. The only thing I will do different next time is add more cream cheese. All the other stuff seems to overpower the actual cheesecake part. I'm sure a little more cream cheese would make it perfect.

I decided that I wanted an extra dessert for Thanksgiving this year.  We always have our traditional pies and such, but many in my family enjoy something with chocolate in it and a good cup of coffee after dinner.  I don't like cake myself but adore cheesecake.

I wasn't too impressed with this recipe. Way too sweet and the brownie crust too hard from being kept in fridge. I even reduced cooking time for brownie. I'll stick to regular cheesecakes.

This recipe needs a few edits, but an overall a good starting point. My tips for how I got mine to turn out perfectly are:

1. Use the Nestle La Lechera Dulce de Leche for the caramel. It's already made and a lot less trouble than attempting to make your own caramel
2. Ignore the instructions about making the brownie crust. Simply make the brownies according to the instructions on the box. Use about 2/3 of the batter and cook for the time suggested on the box (trust me)
3. Make sure the brownie is completely cool. Maybe even make it the night before
4. Spread the caramel over the brownie, but not all the way to the edge. Spread it to about an inch away from the edge
5. Make sure you bake the cheesecake in a water bath. This will make sure the brownie stops cooking and stays moist. 
6. Use foil around the bottom and sides of the springform pan before you put it in the water bath so the water doesn't get inside
7. Let the cheesecake bake for 2 hours, then let it sit in the warm oven 

Yes, this is 7 extra steps, but it's worth it. This is an extremely rich dessert and a family favorite.

I'm giving this a 5-star because even though it came out of my oven looking like quite a mess, it still tasted unbelievably amazing! I will most definitely be making this again!
The only changes I made to the recipe were an increase in ingredients which meant it had to cook longer and I made the brownie as directed on the box, using about 12 oz. of the mixture instead of 9. I ended up having to cook it for roughly 70 minutes because the caramel was slowing the cheesecake's baking speed (see warning); the original time should've been 50 to 60 minutes. For the brownie, which through all that still managed to be deliciously moist and chewy, I used Pillsbury's Family Size Chocolate Fudge. Though you don't need the family size one, I recommend it because you'll have some leftover mixture to bake by itself which could be used as a crumbled topping or even a brownie bottom for some cupcakes (both of which I'm doing).   
A WARNING: Be wary of how much caramel you put in! I guess I accidentally put WAY too much because 20 minutes into it baking in the oven, it started to bubble UP around the edges (hence the messy-looking, slow-cooking cake). This isn't really a cause for alarm though as long as you thoroughly keep an eye on your cake. Mine ended up with some spots at the top where it would've started to actually burn if I hadn't have taken it out soon. Ironically though, with all the random spots of caramel and forming crust, my cheesecake actually didn't crack! Hmm!

This cheesecake was a big hit with the family! very simple to make. I used the three packages of cream cheese and kept the eggs and sugar the same, I also just used caramel topping because I was feeling lazy. The brownie bottom was definitely too hard cooking it for how long it is suggested but next time I will definitely cool the brownie less and make the caramel with the milk. I used a Ziploc bag to drizzle the chocolate and a spoon for the caramel.

Crust is SO hard!! I even followed the advice of a post and only baked it for 10 minutes. My husband can't even cut thru it! Maybe it needs more than one tiny tablespoon of water, or maybe some oil?

Was really easy. I didnt have an electric mixer, and was fine mixing with a whisk, turned out super creamy. But i regret not baking the brownie layer completely like the box said. This was the one suggestion I took that didn't work out. The brownie crust, is more like a moist chocolate cake. If you try this recipe, take everyone's suggestions. BUT PLEASE, BAKE THE BROWNIE LAYER UNTIL IT'S DONE!!!! Also, if you want to save money, instead of buying condensed milk, and caramels, buy premade caramel sundae topping or syrup, and heat on the stove with a tiny bit of milk.

Thanks to all who reviewed before me. I made this recipe into individual cheesecakes using jumbo foil muffin cups. Use a brownie mix for a 13x9 pan, follow package directions. Divide batter equally between 18 muffin cups, bake 12 minutes. Put a tablespoon of melted caramel on top of baked brownie. I used 3 pkgs of 8 oz cream cheese, 3 eggs, 2 tsps vanilla and 1/2 cup sugar. I divided the cream cheese mixture between the 18 cups and baked for 15 minutes. I let cheesecakes cool 15 minutes in pan and topped with remaining caramel. I did not use chocolate fudge sauce. It worked really well and was easy to serve being individuals. Perfect to transport if taking to a party or gathering.

I followed suggestions of others with both brownie layer (not cooking it fully through) and the cheesecake layer (adding extra). It baked beautifully.  This was the cake my daughter picked for her 13th birthday.  The kids all loved it.  They would give it 10 stars.  However, the reason for 3 stars for me is because it is sweet.  Wow.  I have a major sweet tooth and love cakes and cheesecakes.  This cake for me was just too sweet.  I do not know if I will make it again because I cannot think of anything that will cut back.  The layers were great separate, but together it was just too much.

This was my first time making cheesecake and this one turned out really well. I would suggest reducing the amount of time for the brownie crust to cook as many other people have suggested. I added a couple splashes of milk to the reheated caramel sauce just to make it creamier to finish the top of the cake.

My Mom and son loves cheesecake so I decided to make last night.  Used Duncan Hines Chewy Brownie mix and prepared as directed on package.  Baked for 18 minutes.  Next time I will only use 1/2 of the batter (use all the batter if you prefer a thicker crust).  Let brownie and caramel mixture cool before adding. Used all of the caramel mixture and had no problem with it running over or burning, but next time will add pecans around the edge becuase I love them.  Placed a large pan of water on the rack under the cheesecake and baked for 50 minutes.  Chilled 4 hours in the refrigerator, ran a butter knife around the pan released spring and rim came up perfectly.  Will top next time with fresh strawberries to cut some of the richness

Made this for my teen daughter for her birthday.  It was gone in seconds. I used a 9 inch pan and for the brownies I made the bakers chocolate one bowl brownies I always make (much better than a box).  I also only pre-baked the brownies for 15 minutes and of course placed a pan of water under the cake while baking.  PERFECT!!!! Thanks for the recipe

I've been baking complicated desserts for years, but recently have delved into the world of cheesecakes. This cheesecake was the second one I've ever made, and it turned out fabulously. I used a lot of the tips in the comments, such as increasing the cream cheese and eggs to three each to minimize the sweetness. I used a 10" pan, so it wasn't a very tall cake. The brownie crust turned out perfectly. I also added pecans to the middle layer and the top. I would caution you to contain the caramel within 1 inch of the edge of the crust. If it leaks out, it will get super sticky and make your cake difficult to cut and remove from the springform.

The caramel was easy to make, and it made a delicious sauce. My cheesecake was beautiful and delicious. It received rave reviews from my coworkers. I will definitely be making this recipe again, with the above modifications.

First off -  I live in Germany and a few of the required ingredients were pretty hard to get. But once I had them, I made this cheesecake for a friend's birthday party. This was the first ckae to disappear from the buffet. Everyone raved about it! A very decadent treat!

I'm not a big fan of the cheesecake part of this recipe.  It turned out way too eggy for me.  I'll try one less egg next time.

Bake brownie 25 minutes.

Mini cheesecakes: mix regular sized box of ghiradelli brownies as directed by package for at least 5 minutes. melt caramels as directed. May not need to add to recipe, just keep it as is. Extra cream cheese too much. bake at least 15 minutes.

I have never made a cheesecake before until now.  I am not exactly sure if I did it correctly...The brownie crust was kind of hard, and I could not get the cheesecake out of the pan, even though I put it in the fridge overnight, and had greased the pan really really well.  Other than that this recipe has a really good, rich cheesecake flavor.  It is really sweet, so if you do not have a sweet tooth...then stay away.  Cheesecake is my favorite dessert, and this one was easy and yummy...I just wish I could have gotten it out of the pan!!  Will definitely make this recipe again!!

Very delicious!  The only thing that was a downfall in the recipe was when the second layer, that's caramel, is baking, it must of ran to the sides, and when slicing, it was hard to slice a nice piece.  The brownie too would be a little hard, like others said, but not when bitten into.  Very delicious, simple, and definitely going to make many times again. :-)

While I was making this I realized what I like best about cheesecake is the graham cracker crust. So why was I making one with a brownie crust.  If this is the case with you, don't bother making, you won't like it.  With that being said, I added 1/3C oil to the brownie mix and baked for 20 minutes.  I let it cook before adding the carmel and just poured that in the middle leaving a inch long edge.  I 1 1/2 the cheesecake part and everything came out beautiful and everyone thought it was delicious!

This was very good. I did take some others suggestions and use 3 pkgs of cream cheese, 3 eggs, 3/4c sugar, 1.5 tsp of vanilla. I couldn't find the right brownie package so I used a 10.75 I only cooked the brownie for 15 min. then added the caramel and the cheese cake part. This was very good the carmel didn't bubble out and make it hard to eat the brownies didnt get all crusty and hard very moist. Will diff. have to make it again everyone loved it.

This recipe was amazing.  It's definitely better if you increase the cream cheese layer by 50% (3 packages of cream cheese, etc.).  I did make a big mistake with my first try - I used sweetened condensed milk instead of evaporated milk with the caramels.  Don't do this!  The caramel inside was fine but it made the caramel on top too hard when cooled.  Also, I recommend cooking any cheesecake in a water bath to make it come out perfect!  Great, yummy recipe!!!

I followed the directions given, although I did use a 10oz. brownie mix  and baked the brownie crust for only half the time, as suggested by other reviewers.  I am sorry to say that the cake was a disaster... the caramel bubbled up around the cheesecake mixture and burned, and the brownie part was hard as rock.  An unfortunate disappointment, but the cheesecake part did taste good.

Brownie bottom came out a big chewier than I would've liked. I only cooked for 15 min as per some of the suggestions.  Would like to try graham cracker crust or oreo crumb crust next time. Will also up the packages of cream cheese to 3 as per suggestions.

This was just okay.  Like others, I cooked the brownie for only 10 minutes, however it was still hard.  Also, the caramel burnt up the sides of the pan so I had to cut off all edges.  It was not as good as expected.

Hmm...well, this turned out good but not as well as I would have liked. My brownie layer ended up being gooey and my cheesecake layer was not as smooth in texture as I would have liked. The basic concept is good, but I think I'll have to experiment with it to get it right for me. Two things that I changed that I did like: I used Smucker's caramel topping and I added toasted, chopped pecans between the brownie and cheesecake layers. I also reduced the sugar in the cheesecake layer because the brownie and caramel are very sweet. Even though it didn't turn out as well as I would have like, my friends loved it. I'll definitely try it again!

Incredibly sweet and in the words of my father-in-law, "sinful".  My brownie layer was a little gooey but that didn't seem to bother anyone but me since I had to try and serve it.  I did increase the cheesecake layer and used sweetened condensed milk instead of evaporated.

Is probably a great recipe with some extra instruction or some adjustments. I did not read the other reviews before making this recipe, so I cooked the crust as stated in the recipe. It is hard as a rock. I just took the cheesecake out of the spring form to put on a plate and the carmel is still not set. It has been in the fridge for 6 hours and the carmel just ran out from the center. I cooked the carmels per the recipe...I cooked until they were melted and it had a "Smooth" consistancy. Maybe the recipe should state until it has thinkened. I may try it again...not sure...

I made this according to the directions listed so that I could decide where to adjust from there for next time if needed. It definitely needs some tweaking. The brownie layer was thin and got very hard - almost impossible to cut. The cheesecake layer was kind of soft and mushy, not the kind of cheesecake consistency I'm used to. And the caramel layer was a little too runny. Next time I'll double the brownie layer, use less evap milk in the caramel sauce, and adjust the cooking time (less on the brownie, more on the cheesecake). But overall it's a good starter recipe if you do some adjustments. Thanks!

This was a fantastic cheesecake!  I even used a gluten-free brownie mix!  (The Gluten Free Pantry mix - got it at Walmart Supercenter for much cheaper than the health food stores).  I followed the directions on the box, and baked it only 15 min (as my oven bakes slower.  10 min would probably be more accurate otherwise).  I used about 2/3 of the mix as it was a larger box.  Just baked up the rest in a very small cakepan.  As per the advise of the others, I used 3 blocks of cream cheese, 3 eggs, and 3/4 c. sugar.  I also waited to pour the cream cheese mixture onto the carmel layer until it had a chance to cool a while and was of a stiffer consistancy.  I also let the cheesecake stand in the oven after I shut it off for 3 hours after the 40 min cook time.  This really helps it to firm up with no browning or cracking.  It was perfect!  The one thing that I would have done differenty, is to wait until the cheesecake is totally chilled before removing the springform ring.  I did not have this option, as I was needing to bring it with me sooner than expected.  Over all a real keeper!  Thanks and 
GOD Bless! :-)

Yum!!!  I even made some changes to make the calorie count a bit lower and still it was so good!  I used a whole 13x9 brownie mix and only added the eggs and water that it called for, I baked it for 15 min. removed and squirted on a little caramel ice cream topping.  I used one fat free cream cheese and one 1/3 less fat cream cheese and then drizzled a bit of caramel sauce and chocolate syrup on top-so tasty!  I also used a 10" pan-thats all I have!  Only a few cracks on top!  My husband proclaimed this to be the best cheesecake I've made (okay, so I have only made a couple) but I will make this again!

This was excellent! The only problem I had was that the caramel filling was not very thick and it oozed down under the brownie part then stuck to the pan. Next time I think I will make the caramel filling thicker. Overall very good. They thought I bought it!

This was a disaster for me. I followed others' suggestions and baked Betty Crocker brownie mix brownies for 10 mins, and when I took the sides off the springform pan, the brownie just glooped out--didn't cook for long enough at all! Next time (if there is one) I will definitely be baking the brownie for the full 25 minutes!

This tasted delicious but I ended up with a major crack in my cheesecake.  I was able to cover it up nicely with the hot fudge and caramel! :)  Considering this was my first cheesecake, I was quite proud of myself.  I followed the recipe exactly but next time I will add chocolate chips to the brownie mix and cook it for less than the time stated in the recipe.  I will also use a water bath.  It stuck a bit while trying to take off the springform so next time I won't spread the caramel to the edges.

I loved this recipe... I am a cheesecake fanatic... i struggle to find a new recipe since i bake cheesecake on a weekly basis... had a tiny issue with the caramel sticking to the pan... just needed to cool for and extra hour or so... i bought way to much hot fudge... only necessary for decoration on top... but great recipe.. even the hubby helped out in the process...!

This was my first time making cheesecake, and it turned out well. I first cooked  half a regular size box of betty crocker brownie mix (the one the icing pouch included), I used a 1/3 cup of oil, 2 tbsp of water, and 2 eggs. Cooked for 12 mins, the brownie layer was perfection it was sooooo moist not dry at all! I let it cool a bit outside while making a the caramel mixture. I used about 600 grams of caramel squares, with the evaporated milk, poured over the brownie and kept 1/3 of the cup to the side. I made no mods to the cheese cake mixture, I poured that over and put it to cook in the oven. Maybe I have a super powerful oven but I checked on it once at 15 mins then at 30 mins and at the 30 it was over cooked! It had split in the middle, not a big split  more like a surface crack =P I was mad because this was going to be the finale to my Christmas dinner! Anyways after cooling it for 7-8 hrs, I iced the whole top with a gourmet dark chocolate fudge (this stuff tastes awesome, I eat spoonfuls all the time)to conceal my cheesecakes's wound and it worked. Then with an icing bag, I made thin swirls of caramel on the top. It was a really pretty cheesecake (looked pro), I didnt have batteries in my dig cam otherwise I would have posted! Anyhoo, everyone really enjoyed this. But Im not that big of a fan of cheesecake, I only had a bite or two but it was really good, the brownie part was my fave.

This was excellent!  Served this for Thanksgiving and it was gone by the end of the night.  I did not have a 9 oz. brownie mix, just the basic brownie mix box, which is 21 oz.  I chose to bake the brownie as directed on the box and used the leftover batter for an extra pan.  I baked it in the springform pan about 10-15 minutes.  The caramel layer is so yummy! It turned out picture perfect and I had many requests for the recipe!  Will make again!

I followed the modifications that other reviewers suggested and still had some issues.  The caramel layer leaked out and saturated the brownie layer so it was very moist and there wasn't a visible caramel layer.  Aesthetically it wasn't the best but my friends raved over how delicious it was.

This cheesecake was amazing! My husband loved it! I added about 1/3 cup water to the brownie mix along with a little vegetable oil. I also used the caramel ice cream topping instead of the caramels and milk. I highly recommend this recipe. I would certainly make this again!

Turned out GREAT. I took it to a party and it was inhaled so fast I didn't even get but one bite! Make sure you spread out the brownie and the caramel as evenly as possible or the sides turn out looking pretty gnarly. : )

This is a company worthy recipe. I baked the brownie 'crust' for 10 minutes. I took the advice of other reviewers and added more cream cheese mixture - so for this part used 3 - 8 oz. packages of cream cheese (two light cream cheese, 1 regular), 3 eggs. 3/4 cup white sugar and 1 1/2 tsp. of vanilla. I baked the cheesecake at 350 degrees F. for 60 minutes (but would suggest checking at 50 - the cooking time will depend on your oven). Thanks for the recipe, Jackie.

Just made this for a co-workers birhtday last week. It was awesome! Everyone loved it. I made it exactly as the recipe was written, and it came out fine.  The brownie layer was a little hard when it was cold, but softened up nicely after it sat out awhile.  I will try it again with some of the changes I've read here, including caramel sauce from the jar or the La Lechera. Don't like unwrapping the candy!

Pretty good!!!! I changed the recipe a little... followed the normal brownie recipe and cooked it at 350 until it was pretty much cooked.  When I put it back in with the cheesecake I put a pan of water on the rack below.  For the top (after cooking) I just spread the caramel and then a small layer of ganache-heated heavy cream then poured it over some chocolate chips and stirred them until it was melted.  I got pretty good reviews, my mom told me to keep the recipe.

This is the best cheesecake I've tasted in a loooong time!  The end result was so good, I could have sworn it came from the "Cheesecake Factory" restaurant!  I used only part of a brownie mix recipe to avoid the crust being to thick.  Then, to simplify things, I used already liquid caramel topping atop the semi-cooled brownie.  I had no problems with the layers staying intact.  To finish it off, sprinkle chocolate and peanut butter chips ontop of the cheesecake, along with some caramel and chocolate drizzled atop.  Great!

Not the best ad-hoc cook..couldn't figure out everyone's variations.  Just made a batch of brownies, put filling in.  Came out as a brownie bowl with cheesecake and caramel in the middle.  Served for Christmas desert and everyone absolutely loved it!

Very good Recipe! I made the brownies off of the Nestle cocoa box, spread almost 2/3 of it in the springform pan and baked the rest in another pan. Then I followed the rest of the recipe as directed- excellent! Thank You very much!

I took the advise of other reviewers and only cooked the brownie for 10 minutes.  Was a little concerned when I added the other layers and everything seemed to blend together, but it did separate as it cooked (just not as pretty as the picture).  Didn't add the additional chocolate on top and my family didn't seem to miss it.

I was really excited to make this because it sounded so good.  It wasn't as good as I had hoped for.  I did what other users said and only baked the brownie portion for half the time, but the end result didn't even taste like a brownie.  I couldn't taste the caramel layer at all, and the brownie layer was flat and chewy.  The only way I would make this again would to play with it a bit to make the brownie layer work.

I made this for Easter and everyone loved it.  I couldn't rate it a 5 because there are a few things that you have to change in the recipe and it is pretty messy.  But don't let that stop you from making this wonderful cheesecake.  I made the brownie mix as directed on the package, I buttered and floured the bottom of the bundt pan, and I only cooked the brownie for about 15-20 minutes.  It turned out excellent.  It wasn't hard like others said in there reviews.  I also ran a knife around the edge of the cheesecake when it came out and after I refridgerated it overnight.

This was the first time I'd ever made a cheesecake and it was wonderful! Everyone enjoyed it - even those that aren't big fans of cheesecake. I followed others' ideas and only cooked the brownie for 12 minutes and I increased the cheesecake portion by 50%. I'd recommend this to anyone. Thanks!

I was disappointed in the brownie layer. I would cut the baking time down and add a little oil so it's not so hard. The caramel layer didn't hold up, it really needs to be much thicker. Condensed milk would be a better match. I will probably make this again, but definitely make adjustments.

The cheesecake sounded wonderful, but the brownie was very flat and stuck to the pan, even though I'd greased it. The cheesecake part was okay but not delicious. I'll have to keep trying, because it sounds like a wonderful recipe.

This recipe is great.  My husband is a cheesecake freak and loves when I make this dessert.  I think it works out better when you bake the brownie for half the time of what the recipe calls for.  Then the brownie is softer and melts in your mouth.

I went by some of the reviwers changes, the larger brownie mix, addeed another cream cheese, more sugar, another egg and more vanilla to it and also went with the LaLechera canned stuff.  First off, the brownie thing turned out well, nice and chewy and not dry at all BUT apparently that LaLechera stuff is the BRAND and there are different kinds of it...like caramel flavor and sweetened condensed milk flavor because I grabbed the sweetened condensed milk kind and it does nothing for the recipe. :)  So I will be making this again and trying caramel for the center like you're supposed to do.  Overall the flavor is good but I didn't get an overly sweet flavor in this like others have suggested.  I will review it again when I make it according to the recipe.  Thanks for the recipe though.

I thought this was okay, but I did not think it deserves such incredible marks. I did not care for the baked cheesecake and the brownie was very hard. For all of the time and effort, I will not make this recipe again.

This did not turn out very well.  The brownie bottom was too hard, the caramel overflowed and burned and it made a mess of the pan.  I had one slice and ended up throwing the rest in the trash.  I was really counting on this dish to take to a party, but it did not work too well.  I will try it one more time, becuase it did have a good flavor.  It just was not very presentable by the time i got it out of the pan and the brownie was a little too tough.  Thanks the same!

This is a wonderful recipe. It is a wonderful variation of original cheesecake. I used the reviewer suggestion to use la lechera instead of the caramel and I only baked the brownie mix for 15 minutes at 300 degrees before adding the caramel and cheesecake. I had no problems getting it off the pan. Will make this recipe again. I loved it!

I didn't find this too hard to make or that time comsuming.  It was a little difficult to cut and get off the pan.  But it tasted fabulous!!!!  I brought it to a dessert party, and it was the only thing that was completely gone by the end of the night.  I will certainly make it again, however i might add walnut or pecans to it as well to give it a bit of a crunch!

I took this recipe to a church gathering.  Everyone loved it!  It has a wonderful flavor.  You can subsitute fat free cream cheese if you're worried about the fat and calories, and it still tastes great.

This was wonderful and did not last long!  A bit messy because of the caramel but definetly worth it.  My 4 year old, "picky eater", son gobbled it up and kept asking for more.  Thank you!

This was fabulous.  It looked like a gourmet cheesecake when it was done and tasted just as good.  I followed the advice and cooked the brownie for less time and it turned out perfectly.

DELICIOUS!  I couldn't find the 9 oz. brownie mix either so I used the 10.4 oz by Betty Crocker and followed the directions on the package and it turned out FANTASTIC!  I cooked the brownies about 15 minutes and that was plenty.  After the cheesecake portion was made and put on top of the caramel I put double tin foil around the bottom of the pan and set it in a pan of warm water to cook in (an allrecipes.com hint).  It looked like I bought it from a gourmet shop.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks!!

This was fantastic. I make cheese cakes often and this received more compliments than any one I have ever made.  Every piece was eaten.  The only suggestion I would make is to not cook the brownie portion as long as the receipe suggests.  Take it out before it gets done because the bottom was very hard to get out of the pan.  I have been requested to make this again and have given out the receipe a bunch.  This is a keeper.

This was taken to a holiday gathering and I will say it did not last long.  I did not even get to taste it.  I am making another this week for my family.  It has been requested by everyone at the gathering.

I love this! I reviewed this 5 years ago...it was the first cheesecake I ever made (adventerous!).  I used to be able to find the 9oz brownie mix (jiffy brand) but no more.  The probably discontinued it, considering the brownie mix was not that good - outside of this recipe!  Anyway...I had to use the large size brownie this time...and am mid-way through baking it.  Nervous that I've over baked the brownie part, ugh. 

The last time I made this - I just used caramel topping...it was too thin!  While transportin the entire cheesecake layer almost slid off the brownie part!

Use real caramels with the condensed milk - it's worth it!

I am so happy everyone seems to like this recipe. I should have mentioned that the brownie mix that I use in it is the "Jiffy" brand, that comes in the smaller light blue and white box.
I must admit that I don't eat cheesecake and just go by what everyone else tells me about them...so I appreciate the tip on baking the brownie bottom a bit less....however I have never had a problem with the top cracking. Happy eating!!  Jackie

Hey KIMFLEMING,
About the edges burning and overhardening.  Have you tried putting it in a hotwater bath while baking.  I don't know for sure if this will help, but it's worth a try.

This was a big hit at my work.  I made a box of Pillsbury brownie mix, and used about 1/2 to 2/3 of it for the bottom.  Baked that for 10-15 minutes, and reserved 2/3 cups of the carmel for the top.  It turned out great!  It was pretty rich tasting, but using less carmel in the middle seemed to help.

This was delicious!!!  I make it with half of the fat by using low fat cream cheese, fat free condensed milk, hershey's syrup, and low fat brownies (1/2 batch).  Everyone loved it and I'll make it again.

I MADE THIS RECIPE EXACTLY AS IT SAID AND I DIDN'T HAVE VERY MUCH SUCCESS.  THE ACTUAL CHEESE PART TURNED OUT GREAT, BUT THE SIDES WERE VERY HARD AND UNEDIBLE.  IF ANYONE HAS ANY SUGGESTIONS I WOULD LOVE TO HERE HOW I CAN PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN.

I liked the taste of the cheesecake, but I think the brownie layer was too hard.  I would bake for the first time around for maybe only 10 minutes instead of the 25.  It got great reviews at my work though! Very rich and sweet.  :-)
