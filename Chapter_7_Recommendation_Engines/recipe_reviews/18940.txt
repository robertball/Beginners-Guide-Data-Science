This was a huge hit at my Halloween party, but it was a little too sweet for me.  I'd cut the sugar by at least half.

I fixed this punch last night at a Halloween party.  It was a HIT!!  I made ice in a bundt pan and threw some plastic spiders in the ice.  As the ice melted the spiders started floating in the punch.  Then I sat the punch bowl in a smaller bowl and put glow sticks in the small bowl.  It lit up so cute.  It was gone before I knew it!!  Not even one complaint.  I will definatly fix this one again and again!!  For a little kick, I added fifth plus a little of Ron Rico Rum.

I have made this punch 3 times:
at a Bridal Shower on St. Patricks Day
March Baby Shower
and Easter Dinner

It can get a little thick towards the bottom, you may want to run the pineapple juice through a sieve to keep the pulp out.  And definately use pulp free OJ.

We loved this and had it at an open house for our building.  We added Limeaid which is more cost effective then orange juice and it was wonderful and Green!

I served this punch for a preschool Halloween party out of a witch's cauldron.  This "witch's brew" was liked by all and really was very yummy.  The ginger ale kind of makes it frothy and spooky on top.
Note** I only used 1 oj concentrate and it was great.  Using 2 I thought might make it more yellow than the green color it turned out to be.

This had a great taste, and was a beautiful color for Christmas. I garnished with some sliced lime and marchino cheeries to make it even more festive. All the adults loved it, but the kids weren't that crazy about it.

Very spooky Halloween color!  I didn't have enough room in my punch bowl to put the ginger ale in, so everybody just added a little to their cup with some ice, which worked great.  
I only put in half the sugar called for and it was still very sweet.

I made this for my sisters birthday party.  Her birthday is on halloween.  If you would like to put some of your ginger ale into ice cube trays and put in some gummy worms so you will have frozen gummy worms.  Then before serving pop in the ice cubes with gummy worms inside and it will not dilute the punch.

This is a great punch ***IF*** you cut back on, or cut out the sugar. I made this for two different parties this last weekend. First one I made as written but used only one cup sugar per some of the review. It was way too sweet and I couldn't fathom ever using two cups! People liked it and none was left but again, not for me. For the second party I made per the recipe and left out all the sugar and it was fantastic!  I would have given this recipe 5 stars if it didn't call for the sugar. In each batch I used about 1 and 1/2 bottles of rum.

Good fresh lime flavor, not too overpowering.  Used diet sprite instead of ginger ale and floated lime sherbert on top.

There was absolutly no need for the 2 cups of sugar-- that was only extra- un-needed calories! it was perfect without the sugar. the color was not real green green, it was kinda like a light neon yelowish green, to help this just put a a couple drops of blue food coloring in to bring it back to a darker green--. This punch was a hit at our st.paddys day bash!

This punch was very delicious & a beautiful shade of green too (a mixture of sage & dark lime). Perfect for special occasions.

Very tasty!  Perfect for the office Halloween party.  As a bonus it gets kind of frothy on top, really adding to the whole effect.

Pretty good, though too much sugar for my tastes.  I added more ginger ale until the sugar seemed just right.  After that, it was yummy.

My sister just made this for Christmas and added frozen marachino cherries to it.  The punch was delicious and a huge hit among adults and kids!  The only disconcerting thing was the color - everyone called it bug juice, but it sure tasted good.  Six adults and two kids went through two batches of this stuff, even with wine, etc. and all the food.  Would definitely make for other occasions!

I thought that one batch would be plenty.  I served soda, coffee, and hot spiced cider along with the punch because it was cold outside.  I still ran out!  No complaints about the punch except there wasn't enough!

I substituted limeade concentrate for the orange juice concentrate.  It was a huge hit and disappeared quickly!  I thought it could use  slightly more pineapple juice or ginger ale as the punch seemed a little thick, but otherwise it was great.

I held the Jello mix overnight at room temperature, but it gelled a bit. Because of this it was heavier than the juice and sunk to the bottom of the container. I kept stirring so it would stay mixed. People loved it, but I would make this just before using it next time.

I freeze the main mixture, omit sugar, and serve next day with Ginger Ale.  This really makes 2 full punch bowls.  So I freeze in 2 gallon freezer bags.  I have made this several times and people LOVE it!  I ran out of it the first party I made it for

I went to a friends house for a hallween party. They happened to have used this recipe although they used limeade instead of orange juice so that it would look much greener.Everyone loved it and it was gone in no time.

Made this for my kids haloween party with the dry ice.. OMG!! They LOVED it.. I put it in a black cauldron, and added gummy worms. It makes more than it states on the recipe. I made a double batch, and 1 was enough.. I also used sugar free jello and diet soda, cut the sugar in half... Could not even tell! Will use every year!

OH gosh this is good.  I mixed the juices up tonight, will add the ale tomorrow, but I mixed me up one glass and it was soooo good.  I think they only thing I did different, I used 1.5 cups of sugar and mixed it in with the gelatin while it was still hot so it would disolve.  I also hit it with 10 drops of green food coloring.  This was soooo good.   I think everyone will love it for our St Pat's themed lunch tomorrow.  Thanks for sharing!

I always make this for Halloween and everyone thinks it's delicious.I do only use about half the sugar and it's still plenty sweet.I like to put gummy worms around the sides of the bowl for a fun effect.

I made this one for a Pampered Chef party and it was a great hit = the kids loved it esp.
It was a quick and easy one to do.  If you have the ingreadants, it is a no brainer to put together.
Be prepaired for the amount it will make though, I had a lot left over. It is one that I will do again when I have another party.

I made this for a baby shower and it was a hit.  It's very sweet and could probably be "cut" with more ginger ale.

I made this for wedding shower and omitted extra sugar, water, and only used one liter of ginger ale (due to size of punch bowl) and it came out wonderful!!!  Crowd pleaser!

I made this for our St. Patrick's Day Potluck at work. I made some changes - I used limeade instead of o.j. and did not add any sugar - it certainly did not need to be any sweeter. People seemed to really enjoy it.

I agree - leave out the extra sugar!  I substituted frozen limeade instead of OJ, and added 1/4 cup lime juice and used lemon-lime club soda.  I floated thin slices of peeled kiwi fruit in it along with ice cubes in halloween shapes and called it poliwog swamp punch for my black/green themed adult halloween party.  Rum added as optional.

This recipe was easy and very tasty. Instead of using the the frozen orange juice I used Dole pineapple and orange juice and added 1/4 of a cup of lemon juice to make it more citrus.

The kids loved this one and the grown ups did too.  Bright green (think Shrek) punch that tastes good and is easy to make. This was perfect at my Halloween party with floating ice hands.
I left out ALL of the added sugar and it was still very sweet. I hardly ever drink juice, but I can't imagine this being any sweeter and being drinkable.  Leave it out!  Several parents asked for the recipie and I told them that I had left sugar out and they all agreed that any more sugar would ruin it.
I had about 16 kids (most were in the 5-7 age range) and at least one parent per kid and this made enough for all and I have about 1 1/2 quarts left.  Good punch!

Very yummy!  Kids and parents finished it in no time at a St. Patrick's Day party.  Between the pineapple juice and the oj concentrate, 2 cups of sugar sounded way too sweet.  I decided to omit the sugar altogether and add it if necessary and there was no need.  Without sugar, it was refreshing and fizzy!  Will def make again.

Its turns out to be a perfect green color if you use limeade instead of OJ.  I served this at my work's Halloween potluck with dry ice.  It looked awesome with the dry ice.  It tasted pretty good too.  I didn't add the sugar and it was still sweet enough.

The original recipe would have been way too sweet! I didn't add the 2 cups of sugar it called for and it was perfect.
To make it a little more punch like, add some lime sherbet. Just be careful that you don't make it too sweet.

I will say that this recipe was a great jumping off point for a wicked witch's brew at our halloween party.  Of course, after the third person, unbeknownst to me, added yet another mystery alcoholic ingredient, I don't know how much I can attribute to the recipe...  But the jello base is a great idea!  I actually used a melon jello and pear nectar, but I that's what's cool about this recipe - you can tweak and make it a little different just by altering the jello type and juice type.  Thanks!!!

Liked this recipe, but  I didn't use any sugar and I would recomend straining out the pulp. FYI I used dry ice and it didn't make the punch taste funny at all just nice and cold and it was a great affect too! I was afraid to put down my garbage disposial so I let it sit in my punch bowl over night till it melted plus I was afraid to touch it. Hope that helps some :)

This punch was good and green enough for our 4 year old's bday party but the additional sugar was definitely not neccessary. I didn't add any at all and it was plenty sweet!

This was a huge success with all ages at our New Year's Day football party. Per suggestions from previous reviews, I completely omitted the sugar and used one can of frozen OJ and one can of frozen limeade.  Every drop of the punch was gone by halftime -- we will certainly be making this one again!

Nice green color for Halloween.  Tasted pretty good too.  Froze an ice ring with gummy eyeballs in it so there were eyeballs floating in the punch bowl.  The kids loved that.  Will definitely make this again.

I made this for a St. Patty's Day luncheon at work and I was not disappointed! This was very well received by my coworkers and very refreshing. I did not use the 2 cups of sugar and cannot imagine the recipe with it. It would be too much! In fact, if I made again, I would use sugar free jello and diet ginger ale to save some sugar. Overall, great recipe. Thanks!

I made this for halloween and it turned out great! it was quite tasty! I did replace the ginger ale with sprite and i made a frozen monster hand out of cranberry juice and gelitine and let it float around in the punch which added a cool effect. It was an adult costume party so of course by the end of the night the boys has spiked it with vodka and it tasted great then too!

I made this for my Halloween Party on Saturday (adults only), I left out the sugar, and used suger free jello and diet ginger-ale. I also added vodka (please use judgement on the amount) to it before I added the ginger-ale and it was a HIT! I also added the floating hand ice cubes to this punch that I found from another recipe for the halloween theme.

This punch really didn't need the extra sugar.  It was very sweet.  I also molded 2 cups of the green guck with a 20 oz can of crushed pineapples and I let it float in the punch.  It made it look pretty and it was nice to get the fruit.

I made this recipe for a Kids Halloween party.  It looked great!  A little frothy on top and definately the right color. I didn't get a chance to taste this recipe, but I heard it was very good.  I put in less sugar and used the pulp free OJ... I'll use this recipe again for another similar occasion.

I've made this punch for everything from my daughter's birthday party to a friend's bridal shower with an option to add some Malibu (coconut rum) to it. I do not add any sugar as I think it's sweet enough the way it is and I never have any left over. I'm not a big fan of traditional punch but even I can't say no to this stuff!

This was very good! I made it for a safari theme baby shower. I only had one can of the OJ concentrate and did not add any sugar and  that punch bowl was empty. It was very good. I put some big gummy gator candies in it and it made it extra cute.

Thanks!!

Perfect for a halloween party!  I served it in a plastic black "cauldron" from the local party supply shop and floated black plastic spiders in the punch. Definitely no need to add the extra sugar, it tasted great and was plenty sweet without it.  The kids loved and so did grownups.

I loved the neon green color of this punch.  I used it for my daughter's Halloween party, and used a suggestion from another recipe to fill a latex glove with water and freeze it.  Then, you can float the frozen hand in the punch.  The changes I made to the punch were: I used 1 can concentrate orange juice, and one carton regular orange juice.  I also added only 1/2 cup sugar, and no extra water.  It was good, but the color really made the recipe.  It looked like a witch's brew!

Excellent! I made it for a Christmas gathering. Everyone loved it. I agree with some other review - sugar could probably be cut down. Most thought is was fine but a couple people commented on sweetness. Excellent recipe and I will definitely be using again.

I made this for my son's dinosaur party.  It turned out kind of spooky looking, like a swamp!  But it fit the theme perfectly.  Once they overcame the green color, everyone loved it.  Delicious.

I didn't think I was going to like this put it ended up being tasty.  We also added white rum since it was an adult party.  Added the hand from Witches Brew (another recipe from allrecipes) made for a ghoulish hit on Halloween. The color is great for Halloween but I don't think I'd make this for other holidays.

Excellent! I cut out the sugar all together, and it was still very sweet. I also used sugar free jello. I loved this recipe and there was not a drop left after the party. Thanks for the recipe!!

I just hosted a Halloween party and this was such a hit!! It will be made for many parties to come!   I altered the recipe a bit because we don't like sweet drinks, and doubled the recipe to make 40 cups (and added a handle of adult beverage). We used 4 packages of lime flavored gelatin, 2 cans of pineapple juice, 2 cans of frozen orange juice concentrate, 2 liters of ginger ale, water as suggested, and no sugar. Awesome!

I made this last year for my son's "Under the Sea" themed birthday party, everyone loved it! I made an ice ring with gummy turtles that added a special touch to it. This year I am making it again for his Dinosaur themed party and we are calling it "Swamp Water". I know it will be a hit again this year!

I absolutelty loved this punch!!  I made it for St. Pat's and was such a big hit, no one touched the soda I had displayed next to it!  I did follow the advise from alot of the other reviews to not add the sugar though, which is why I'm giving it a 4.  It really doesn't need any extra sweetness!! I also used Sprite instead of the gingerale. Can't what to make it again for Halloween!  Thanks.

I made this for Halloween and called it "Green Slime". I think the kids were a little turned off by the name, but eventually got over and and drank some. The tweens said it was a little good, but I think they are just being fussy. I liked it a lot and will make this again, maybe experiment with different jello flavors for different occasions.

Super yummy!  I used one can of orange juice concentrate since a couple of reviewers suggested this.  Everyone loved it!  It was neat watching the ginger ale fizz!
Next time I will start with no sugar since it was way too sweet for me and then see how much sugar it needs if any.

Nice color...kind of a  light neon green.  However, the taste in my opinion was just OK.  I don't think I cared for the jello in the recipe...especially with the OJ.

As a side note, I had a problem because I prepared the jello part the night before  and left it on the counter (hoping it wouldn't congeal, but it did) I fixed it it by pureeing it in the blender with the OJ. 

I appreciate the idea but am still searching for a good green punch...

Made this for Halloween and it disappeared. Everyone loved it. Only used 1/4 cup of sugar. Added about 1.5 cups of malibu rum for the adult version. Also used ice instead of water to keep it cold.

I make this every year for Halloween. I use Sierra Mist instead of ginger ale because of the high fructose corn syrup in ginger ale. I omit the sugar. It's plenty sweet enough.  I got a "brain mold" from a party store and fill it with softened orange sherbet, then freeze . Plop it in the green punch and it is awesome! BRAIN PUNCH!

I made this for a club meeting and some people thought it was good. One person remarked on how sweet it was and thankfully I had read other reviewers comments that said to leave out the sugar. I also found it too sweet and sort of artificial tasting.  One other note of caution: don't try to make it ahead of time!  I thought I would assemble it the night before so I didn't have to take so many separate things to the site of our club meeting. I am so glad I thought to check it early!  I had made Jello!  I had to go  buy new Jello and a new can of pineapple juice...good thing I had not added the oj.  Guess I should have known, but now you are warned!  Wish I had used limeade instead of OJ. The color would have been prettier.

THIS WAS EXCELLENT. I ALSO ADDED A CAN OF LEMONDADE AND THEN 3 MORE CANS OF WATER BESIDES WHAT IT CALLED BECAUSE OF THE ADDED LEMONADE. I TOO CUT THE SUGAR IN HALF AS ONE OTHER PERSON SAID AND I LIKED THAT ALOT. I ADDED THE SUGAR THE SAME TIME AS THE JELLO IN THE HOT WATER TO TOTALLY GET IT DISSOLVED.  I PUT DRIED ICE IN IT FOR HALLOWEEN AND IT WAS A HIT!!!!

Way too sugary!  I must admit i modified the recipe quite a bit, but i still found this to be too sweet.  I used a whole can of pineapple juice, 1 can of frozen OJ, 2 packets of lime jello as advised, and 2 liters of lime flavored seltzer water (no sugar) instead of gingerale in order to give it some fizz.  For someone not used to eating/drinking a lot of sugary items, it was just completely overwhelming.  Three stars though because it was a *great* color for halloween and a lot of fun :)

I told our guests that this was Melted Witch!  I halved the recipe and used a full 12 ounce can of pineapple juice concentrate instead of the prepared pineapple juice.  Because of the extra pineapple concentrate, I left out the sugar and ended up adding about 2 cups extra ginger ale.  We all really liked this punch and I plan to make it again, but will probably make it with the amount of pineapple juice in the recipe, still leaving out the sugar.  And like some others said, straining the pineapple juice through a fine mesh strainer and using pulp free OJ is important if you want a smooth texture.

We made this for St. Patty's Day and everyone loved it! Yummy lime carbonated punch! Will make again for an adult Halloween party with a little bit of adult spirits thrown in! ;-)

This was AWESOME - I made it for a St. Patrick's day party, and ended up having to e-mail the recipe to everyone.  I only used a 1/2 cup of sugar and it was perfectly sweet.  The green color was great!!!

This was very tasty. I used only 1 cup of sugar and am glad I did. Even using diet soda it was still right on the verge of being too sweet!

I made this for my son's birthday/Halloween party in Oct.  It was a huge hit, the color was fun and it tasted wonderful.  

At first the kids didn't want to drink anything so bright green, but after the first one tried it and loved it, they all did, LOL.

I think the only change I made was not as much sugar and I strained the pineapple juice. I also made bloody ice hands out of cranberry juick and plastic gloves.  They loved that, LOL.

Made this for my son's 1st birthday party that as bug themed.  Being green turned some people off, but the flavor was very good.  I have it in my file to use again should I ever need green punch, but seems like it would be good to try other gelatin flavors, too.

I made this for my son’s superhero themed birthday party and labeled it “Hulk Punch”. It was good but very sweet.

Everyone loved this punch!  I did not add sugar or the cold water after reading some reviews and I'm glad I didn't. It was perfect without it.

Made this for Saint Patrick's day, omitted all sugar and it was still a tad sweet. But was a huge hit so there's that! Made it and adults where using it as a mixer while kids where (obviously) drinking it virgin. Everyone liked it!

This was a big hit at my Halloween party. I didn't add any sugar and it was plenty sweet. I also added a 750ml bottle of Tito's vodka.
