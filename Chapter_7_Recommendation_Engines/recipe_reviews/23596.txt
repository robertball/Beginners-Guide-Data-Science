This was a MESS!  I consulted with someone I know that works in an Itailan restaurant, and this is NOT the way you make them!  All you need is a few beaten eggs, and some itailan flavored bread crumbs with a little garlic powder mixed in. First dip the mozz. sticks in the egg mixture then the italian bread crumbs, then back in the egg mixture then back in the bread crumb mixture. Make sure they are completely coated. The oil shouldn't be any hotter then 350 degrees, then put the sticks in the oil for just about a minute, just until they float up to the top of the surface, and they're done! You can also use the same procedure with a block of mozz. Just don't cut the block any thicker then 1/4 inch. I hope this helps.

One small tip. If you freeze the mozzarella sticks before coating and frying they will not melt in the hot fat.

These were delicious and not hard to make. My minor improvisations included: cutting the cheese sticks in half (so my 8 became 16) and using plain bread crumbs with about 2 tsps mixed Italian seasoning. I also followed the advice of several reviewers: First, I combined the flour/starch mixture with the breadcrumbs. It was a huge time-saver and didn't seem to impact the end result. I also tried both double & triple coating and found that a double coat was sufficient for my taste. When the batter got a little clumpy, I simply moulded the clumps around the cheese for a slightly thicker coat. This part was a little messy, but other than that, it wasn't too bad. I coated all of the sticks before frying and set them aside on a plate. This turned out to be great advice because the frying really only takes about 30 seconds, and if you turn your back for too long, the sticks will burn. I did not have any problem with cheese leaking out, and the end result was truly restaurant quality. I will definitely make this recipe again!

Ok, I was a sceptic if this could be done at home! THANK YOU! I am a Happy Believer!!! I just finished making a batch of these and I am still smiling...WOW! This was SUPER! First to make it easy and to make sure they "looked" like cheese sticks-shape-wise, I used Sargento Mozarella sticks, I unwrapped each and cut in half. I had 3 separate bowls setup w/ mixtures as described. I dipped each moz stick in egg mix, then flour mix, then egg mix, then bread crumb mix-making sure they were coated well. Then I put in oil. NOT ONE leaked!! I had to watch these little suckers cause they brown really fast! I let them cool a few minutes and served with little cups of pizza sauce for dipping. My 4 kids and hubby ADORED them and can't get enough. Considering these cost alot on dinners out--they are a KEEPER! WORD OF ADVICE: Use latex gloves to keep hands clean, this can get messy, and if making more than a dozen the mixes get goopy, so for large batches have extra mixes ready! otherwise..would give 10 stars if I could! THANKS SO MUCH!

Great recipe! I have tried many and failed. Since Mozzarella is a soft cheese, it works better to freeze the cheese first before frying and it thaws perfectly without leaking. Let them sit before serving and it's own heat will continue to make the cheese soft. Will make again and again!

This recipe was very tasty and worked out fairly well. However, you have to be sure to coat each mozzerella stick very well otherwise the cheese will melt and seep out into the oil. I breaded each stick twice (once in the liquid, then breadcrumbs then again) for better coverage.

This recipe is great on its own so I will give 5 stars. But the techniques used are all wrong. Here is what I do: Cut the cheese sticks in half this makes them easier to work with. Mix the flour with the bread crumbs and nix the cornstarch, dip the cheese in plain flour first to help the egg stick, then dip in crumbs, eggs again, then again in breadcrumbs/flour mix you will have a nice thick coating on them. Place them on a baking sheet covered in wax paper as you assemble them, then when you finish place the the tray in the freezer for about 30 minutes! (This is KEY! This keeps the cheese from melting the second it hits the oil and allows the coating to get crisp first) The recipe is pretty good as is, but if you make them as stated they will turn out a big mess!

Terrific! I used not only mozarella, but also cheddar and pepper jack cheeses. I made these in the morning and then froze them. We used our Fry Daddy and they came out perfect. No leakage, just a good little appetizer! Thanks Nanci!

I luv these!!!  I used a block of mozzerella cheese and cut it into sticks and I also double dipped them.  As long as you don't over cook and make sure they are fully coated with the batter they will not leak.  My family ate this up in no time.

OK, I tried them as stated and they work without fail. Working in the food industry I have come across many different versions of this recipe. This is how the big name restaurants make theirs honestly! Freezing the cheese works well about the time it is cooked on the outside it is warmed through. Also the method is flour first, then egg, then crumbs. and get creative! For gods sake use any type of cheese that make you happy, and as far as crumbs use any type of (stale) bread you like and toss it in the processor! Add spices you like, and serve it with any sauce you think will work. It is food not plutonium! It don't bite and you get to eat the mistakes! How much better can it get?

I followed the prep for this recipe, but baked my cheese sticks for about 8 minutes at 400.  They were really good.  My husband and I both thought that they tasted better than ones from a restaurant (or the ones from the frozen food section) because they have so much more flavor.  Cooking for 8 minutes they did not get super gooey, so when I make these again I might cook them another minute or two.

great snack...here's a tip that my local italian grocer shared with me: prepare your cheese sticks for frying but place in the freezer for an hour before cooking...it helps them not run out so quickly.

These came out excellent! I used large FRESH mozzarella balls..I DOUBLE dipped them in egg, breadcrumbs, & egg, breadcrumbs, again. Be sure to really let the egg absorb the breadcrumbs!! Place them in the freezer for a good 20 minutes and then toss them into a deep fryer. FABULOUS! Serve'em up with home made marinara and a good sprinkling of grated Parmesano Reggiano!

PERFECT!  I made this according to the recipe and it was perfect.  I used "light" mozzarella sticks and had no mess.  I followed the instructions and only fried 30 seconds.  The bread coating was so delicious that I went back and double coated the remainder.  I froze some of the sticks to be used at a later date.  This recipe is a "keeper"!  Thank you Nanci Renn for sharing.

Yummy! I mostly just eyeballed the ingredients. Also, I just cut a block of mozzarella into sticks instead of using string cheese. One thing I discovered...if you make more than one batch, it's very important to give the oil a minute or two between batches to come back up to temperature. The cheese was oozing out before they browned on the 2nd batch, but the 1st and 3rd were perfect. Thanks for the recipe.

These cheese sticks are fabulous, especially served with buffalo wings!  My husband and I love them!  The only thing I do differently is I use cut-up pieces of mozarella from a block of cheese rather than the string cheese...it's a great way to use leftover cheese from making pizza or lasagna, etc.

I used this recipe New Year's day for a yummy snack for the family!  Our 10 yr old is a mozza stick afficianado and he proclaimed them to be the BEST! He asked me to make more the next day!  I didn't have brick mozzarella on hand, but instead had shredded mozzarella. I preformed the mozza into about 30 balls. I then coated all the balls (about 4 at a time) in the flour mixture in a medium sized mixing bowl. In the same manner I then coated them in the egg mixture, using a fork,then directly into another medium sized bowl into PANKO bread crumbs, then placed them on a platter. (in the meantime I was preheating my frying oil) These steps save on mess! The key is to fry only about 5 or 6 at a time, because as soon as they begin to brown slightly, you turn them and then quickly remove them to a plate. The cheese really doesn't take long to melt! If you leave them in too long that's when you end up with a gooey mess!

Just like the fried mozzarella that I so enjoy when eating out. Next time i may try freezing the cheese a bit before i deep fry because i found that some of the sticks had a tendency to melt and explode little cheese bits while in the oil.

Truly Excellent! I followed this recipe exact, except I coated these 3 times, because we prefer a thicker coating. I let them set up (dry) about 20 minutes between coatings. I left the sticks whole, I didn't cut them in half. I was told these are the best mozzarella sticks anyone has ever had from any restaurant. I was asked to make several batches so they could be frozen for later use. Triple breading these is time consuming, but so worth it. I didn't have any problem with cheese leakage either. I served these with marinara sauce for dipping. I can't wait to make these again very soon. Thank you :)

I didn't freeze the cheese beforehand, but having it chilled in the fridge worked fine. I mixed in my garlic powder, Italian seasoning, a little salt and some black pepper in the Italian bread crumbs.  I double battered my chilled cheese and then put in my deep fryer at 350 degrees for about 45 seconds or so. Also, I cooked about 4 at a time to keep them from sticking to each other. When I first attempt to remove a cheese stick from the basket, it started to fall a bit limp, so before i gathered the others, I just let it sit for a few minutes before transferring them to our serving dish. Doing this allowed the cheese to cool just right and let it keep its form when handling, yet still be melty in the middle. I may try freezing cheese for about 30 minutes before i cook them next time to see what happens. Also, next time i will combine all dry ingredients to save a step. overall, nice and easy recipe and will definitely make this again.

Just a week ago I was in the mood for cheesesticks, found this recipe, and thought I'd give it a try. NEVER did I imagine they would taste this good!!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  I did double dip as suggested by other reviewers, and all I used was flour, egg, breadcrumbs, then egg, and breadcrumbs again.  Set the cheesesticks in the fridge while the fryer heated up. Dropped them in the fryer, stood over the fryer and counted down 30 seconds. Not a second longer.  Pulled up the basket to see absolute PERFECTION.  My 18yr old niece's first words: "Wow, they look like REAL cheesesticks!" and she loved them and wanted more!  We've made them twice in just a week. :)

These were easy and tasted great! I mistakingly combined the bread crumbs with the flour mixture, but it still turned out perfectly fine and ended up being a step saver. I also triple dipped the cheese (egg, breading, egg, breading, egg, breading) and got a nice thick coat and no melted cheese running out. My 3 boys gobbled them up in a matter of seconds!

Darn what a mess. Darn good though. Make a lot, and freeze them, and forget paying the absurd prices for cheese sticks at restaraunts or the store. These were excellent.

Great as a party snack or starter.  I found that if you put them all in at once they tend to stick together in one big fried-cheese clump. So if you want them to keep their "log" shape you have to cook only one or two at a time and make sure they don't touch while cooking.

I made a huge batch for a group of teens and they were gone in 2 minutes.  Made this recipe as shown and only alteration was using mozorella cheese instead of string cheese (which I believe is the same thing just not paying for the cute little shapes and prepackaged).

This turned out awesome! They tasted better than restuant quality. I will make these again without a doubt. I did skip the flour and cornstarch step and just doubled dipped with the bread crumbs...... Really tasty!

Of course breading and deep frying makes a mess, but these were worth it!  I ended up cutting the cheese in half to (really more to make more of them than because it needed to be) and they were all devoured minutes after leaving the fryer.  Thanks!

Great recipe! Everything works out fine! Yeah, it's a little messy, but you're cooking. The only reason people might have some with the cheese coming out while cooking is because they have the cooking oil too low! When you put the mozz. sticks it needs to be really hot! The cooking time takes literally 10 seconds or less! My husband and I did this recipe twice, and we learned what we did wrong  the first time! So, with that advice enjoy!

These were good, but need a bit more seasoning.  Also, I double breaded and they still leaked cheese a bit, so next time I will triple bread and then refrigerate for 15 minutes before frying.  There will definitely be a next time!

Very good cheese sticks especially if you cut each stick in half to make it shorter and again in half to make it thinner.  Serve it with creamy ranch and tangy seafood sauce.  You won't regret it!

Things turned out alright. I had problems with the cheese leaking out though. I made a couple batches: one single coated and one double coated. The double coated batch performed better, but still had problems. With as much fat as these possess I don't think I'll make these too often.

These were really good. My daughter's favorite so I've made them a few times and they are MUCH easier to work with if the cheese sticks are room temperature instead of cold when you egg and bread them. GREAT RECIPE! Thanks!!!

I liked these a lot, they were easy and browned well, but didn't have quite enough flavor for me.  I had the best luck with a batch that I put back into the egg and back into the breadcrumbs a second time before frying, but I would recommend more garlic or Italian seasoning to give a little more kick to them.

This is a wonderful recipe I have been using it for years.  I always use block mozzarella cheese, always double bread the cheese, and freeze them after breading for rougly 20 minutes or more before frying. They always get rave reviews!!

I made these last week and everyone in my family loved them!  I did double coat and think it was a necessary step to keep the cheese from melting out, however towards the end of my batch, it became more difficult to get them coated. You also have to really keep an eye on them...as soon as they start to float, get them out.  The flavor was great, but I think I'm going to try the recipe for homemade cheese sticks that is also on this site.  It's pretty much the same, but you use egg roll wrappers instead of the flour coating to keep the cheese from melting out.

These were awesome!!!  However, I used Parmegiano Reggiano grated cheese with the italian bread crumbs and after they were done I sprinkled some parmesan cheese and fresh parsley on top.  I also sprinkled a tiny bit of garlic salt.......Yummy!

Very yummy!!! So much better than the ones you buy in the freezer Isle at the grocery store. My family loved them. Although messy I found it necessary to dip them in egg then flour re-dip in the egg and coat with breadcrumbs. I tried them without the flour and the cheese ran out. I used Italian seasoned  Panko bread crumbs because I like the outside crispy and they were perfect. I found that 1/2 to 1 hour in the freezer or refrigerator was enough, the longer the cheese was in the cold the longer it took for it to melt when fried, and it didn't take long for them to brown in the hot oil. Thank you for this awesome recipe!

These were fun to make. I didn't have a deep fryer and had a hard time getting the temperature right on the stove; medium-high was too hot and medium was too low. Also the breading was a bit thin and they didn't have that stringy texture of the mozzarella sticks you get at a restaurant. I had a ton of extra breading so I covered and fried some dill pickle slices too, they were even better than the mozz. sticks.

NON MESSY ALERT!!  Keep your hands as dry as possible, have a towel nearby.  Put the bread crumbs, garlic, flour, corn starch in a large tupperware bowl that you have the lid for.  After dipping in the eggs, take about 4 at a time to the tupperware bowl, put on the lid and shake lightly.  With dry hands, find them and put them onto a plate.  Do this at least 3 TIMES PER STICK

i combined the bread crumbs, garlic, flour and cornstarch together in a tupperware bowl.   Just used eggs in the other bowl.  Had the mozz stix frozen.  I ended up dipping them 3 times in each.  Had the deep fryer set to 350 and cooked for about 2 minutes and 15 seconds.  turned out amazing!!!  one of the best recipes on here!

I didn't use cornstarch.  I just added salt and pepper to flour and a little water to the beaten egg.  I kept a "dry hand" and a "wet hand".  I cut string cheese in half and 1) rolled it in the flour (with the dry hand); 2) dipped it in the egg (with the wet hand); 3) shook it in the bread crumbs; and 4) fried them until golden.  Cheese did leak out of a few.  Will try double coating them next time.  YUM!

I just got a fry daddy and was itching to try a deep fried recipe out!  This recipe is great; everything a mozzarella stick should be.  One warning, however, 30 seconds means 30 seconds.  I was multi tasking during one batch and I had a gooey mess.  Just follow the recipe and you should be fine.  Great recipe!

I tried this recipe using a deep fryer. Worked Great. I found that wetting the cheese (I used Mozzarella) helped the flour and starch mixture to adhere to the cheese. I also coated the cheese twice with the egg & bread crumb mixtures. Using tongs during this helps alleviate the amount of bread crumbs wasted on my fingers.Taking the temp. down to 350 kept them from browning to quick. All in all a simple and tasty recipe.

I made these exaclty as instucted, and they didn't quite taste right. I feel that was the missing ingredent.  I worked in a restraunt, and that is how we breaded most stuff. First in the egg mix, then the flour/starch, then the egg mix, then the crumbs... I can't wait to make these again, but try making them the way we did in the restraunt.  The bread crumbs tasted great. The bread was just to thin...

These were good; I made them for a bunch of hungry men and they seemed to really like them. I did double dip in the egg and breadcrumb mixture, and the cheese mostly stayed inside. I also cut the string cheese in half.

I had another recipe on hand for cheese sticks and personally, I liked them better. I used one 8 oz block of mozz, 2 eggs, and equal parts Parmesan cheese and breadcrumbs (plus, a little salt for flavoring) for the coating. I liked the presentation better, and I thought the block cheese melted better than the string cheese. Both went over well though and I will definitely make both again. 

Thank you!!

After reading other reviews, I thought I'd try this a little differently. I decided to use a block of mozzarella cheese. I also put them in the freezer after i covered them with the egg, bread crumbs and flour mixture for about an hour then I dipped them into the oil and coated them again the the mixture and fried them again. These turned out so awesome. My friends are always begging for me to make these whenever they come over.

I am not sure what happened with this recipie, i followed to the key but when i would get the cheese sticks out of the frier, the coating was off the cheese and it wasn't even brown. It ended up a big lump of melted cheese, but it did taste good just not visually appealing!

My daughter and I found this to be a very easy and fun recipe to make fried cheese sticks. I did find the bread crumbs got clumpy after awhile.  Instead of measuring the amount of bread crumbs, I just added what was needed and it worked better.

I just tried this recipe and the mozzarella sticks are great! I made it according to the directions, but I did add two steps. After dipping the cheese into the flour,egg and bread crumbs,the coating didn't seem thick enough to hold the melted cheese; so I added two steps. After the first coating I let them dry for 10 minutes and then coated them a second time and let them dry for another 10 minutes. They are perfect and I know that my guests will love them tonight!

Not crunchy enough for us. For crunch, dip in Panko crumbs then fry. You'll find Panko in Asian stores and some big supermarkets. They are super-large crumbs used for frying and will add a thick and crunchy crust that is unforgettable.

For a lower fat version I breaded them according to the recipe and then into the freezer for 2 hours.  It helped them stay together more.  I'm going to try spraying them with non-fat cooking spray and baking them too.  I can't wait!!!

Great recipe Nanci...one of my favorite appetizers.  I doubled dipped the cheese in egg and breadcrumbs to ensure a more thick coating and left out the cornstarch...I didn't see any need for it.  Dipped these in pizza sauce and loved every bite.  Thankx for sharing.

tastes bad
oil statistics need to be like low heat - not 375 degrees.  Otherwise oil gets so hot everything burns off the cheese stick.

I loved this recipe! But the cheese sticks aren't very good quality cheese. So I bought a chunk of mozzarella cheese that was very good quality. I cut them in small, long square sticks. SO GOOD!! And take less time to cook. About 10 seconds! Hope I helped!

These are absolutely delicious!! You have to really keep an eye on them once you place them in the oil because they can go from ready to mushy in a few seconds flat.

It taste great but it was a mess to make. After every time rolling the cheese in the egg then the bread crumbs. Your fingures were coated in bread crumb. So every two or three cheese sticks you had to quickly clean your fingures. A helpful tip for who ever plans on making them role all the cheese sticks first before frying them. Its to much work trying to roll them in the flour and egg and bread crumbs while trying to pay focusing on frying. But they do taste great.

Made them according to directions and wasn't pleased. The second time I made them, I replaced the Italian seasoned bread crumbs with panko plus 2 teaspoons of Italian spice. The panko was the key to a marvelous cheese stick.

These were delicious. The only change I made was triple-coating and freezing the mozzarella sticks before use. First I froze the original sticks, then I coated them, then froze them again during the time the oil heated up. They tasted just as good as any restaurant's.

These are wonderful! I fried these in just enough olive oil to cover the bottom of my little sauce pot and continued to cook and turn them. I froze them for just a few minutes to make sure the cheese was cool and wouldn't prematurely melt! I also added a splash of buttermilk to the egg for half the water as well as a healthy shake of garlic powder into the breading mix. Very tasty & a fun side for my grilled pizza tonight! Thanks!

These were great, and much cheaper than buying them at a restaurant.  I double, sometimes tripled dipped these to get more breading.  I thought the breading was too thin otherwise.

Excellent!!! I double dipped these in the bread crumb/panko mix so as to avoid any cheese leaking out. Turned out great

Very yummy! I did like another user suggested and froze night before worked great. You just have to cook them a little longer because they were just a tad cold. I added 1 tsp salt and 1 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese to the bread mixture. Now I just have to find a good marinara sauce 8)

I followed the advice of the last review and skipped the flour and cornstarch. (I didn't have cornstarch on hand anyway) I just used the 2 beat eggs, italian breadcrumbs and garlic salt.. going back and forth between the egg and crumbs as suggested until completely coated. Worked well, and tasted like restaurant quality. DO NOT OVER HEAT OIL! It will start to burn the breadding and your cheese wont have time to soften. I messed up on the first one, turned down the heat and completed my batch no problems! =)

These were great and so easy. You do not need to freeze the mozzarella first. Dip in the egg mixture, then the flour mixture, egg mixture, and then bread crumbs. Make sure there is a good coating of breadcrumbs and then when you fry them, they won't leak. These were awesome. Taste just like ones from my fab restaurant. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

These really turned out awesome! But be WARNED, it makes a LOT... so cut down the amounts, or only make this for big parties... since it's a LOT of cheese/fried calories.

Wonderful recipe! These were so easy to make and taste great! Few changes: I used a 1/2 lb block of pepper jack cut into 12 pieces (all I had), plain flour, and due to the flavored cheese, I didn't season the breadcrumbs (just the sauce). I also double dipped them as other people here suggested. Overall, great recipe, really cheesy and hardly any mess! I'll never waste money on restaurant cheese sticks again.

these were good, but the flavor will largely depend on the italian bread crumb flavor, so use a great one that you really like. i also double breaded (flour, egg, crumb, egg, crumb). no leakage.

I didn't have a complete success with this recipe, but I cooked them a bit too long.  The recipe itself was wonderful, and even though they kind of fell apart the were delicious!  My husband and I were eating them with a fork.  I know it was my error though because the first one that came out was perfect and the others I just left a few seconds too long.  30 seconds seems to be the appropriate cook time.  Will make again.  Thanks!!

absolutely delicious. Just need to be careful to watch it not burn while frying. Instead of dipping it and then immediately frying it, it might work if you prepare them by diping them be4 the frying all at once and then frying them. overall a great delicious recipe just like the ones in resturants. =P

A little messy, but had a good flavor.  I used string cheese and found that letting them firm up in the fridge for a few minutes before frying really seemed to help.  I made them on a hot day, so the first batch didn't come out so great.  After the fridge trick, they were pretty good.  Thanks for the recipe!

While these a little bit of a hassel to make, just make a big batch and throw the extras in the freezer so you cook them in a hurry next time.  I bake mine in a 450 degree oven for 12-15 mins to cut out all the oil.  If you can find them, use smoked mozzarella for a nice change of flavor.

It’s really hard to prepare and takes a long time. Overall 10/10 would definitely feed to my cows again. However, they exploded in my oven and in my mouth. Luckily I have cleaning rats.

For all fried mozzarella cheese lovers.  This receipe is an excellent recipe for the fried cheese goodness we treat ourselves to from time to time.   I noticed quite a few of the pics that the cheese is globbing  out of a lot of the time.   The 2 huge things I change from this receipe is as follows:  Cut  your sticks from one large chunk of mozzarella chesse.  I use whole-milk mozzi cheese found in a 1 lb. brick in every grocery store in America.  It is 2 inches thick and in approximately 5 x 5 inch square.  Cut the Mozzi cheese into 1/2 inch slices. ( a little thicker cut will not make a difference)  You should end up with a 1/2 inch thick and 5 inch long and 2 inches wide pieces.  Bread cheese slices as directed in this recipe.  MOST important!  Put the breaded cheese sticks in the freezer for 1 hour.  When your oil is heated to proper temperature just drop them in and watch them get beautiful brown and crispy (approx. 1 - 2 minutes)   WITHOUT the cheese gobbing out of the sticks.  I promise they are hot and gooey all the way through. YUMMO!

In order to get better adhesion, I soaked the fresh cut mozzarella sticks in water for a couple minutes before covering with the flour mixture. This helps ensure the egg mixture sticks properly. Then the sticks are individually placed in the egg mixture with one hand and rubbed down to ensure full coverage. This hand places them into the bread crumb mixture and the other hand coats them with crumbs preventing the crumbs and eggs from mixing which causes clumping and waste. 

Instead of Italian Seasoning, you can also try mixing your bread crumbs with Herbes de Provence for a slight twist.

These were AMAZING! My 12 year old accidentally mixed the breadcrumb mixture with the flour mixture but it turned out well! I recommend double coating the cheese sticks and cutting them in half...

best cheese sticks ever.  I bought a block of mozzarella and cut it into thick sticks.  I only used egg yolks instead because I find it that they coat the cheese better.  I double coated the cheese in eggs yolks and Italian bread crumb and garlic salt mixture.  Froze them for about an hour and deep fried them. they were amazing I am not going to buy store bought again or go out and buy any.  Restaurant price $6.00 for 5 cheese sticks, at home $6.00 for 32 cheese sticks. best taste and better price.

Loved this recipe! Double dipped in the bread crumbs, too. However, I did not use garlic salt. We used garlic flavored cheese curds that I had put in the freezer for 20 minutes (I would have preferred they had been in for an hour, lol). Thanks for this recipe!!!

Had a difficult time getting the flour to stick to the cheese.  Definitely had to double dip in order to get the crumbs(homemade) to adhere.  Next batch we will dip in buttermilk then flour (as with the fried ravioli recipe on this site) for a better result. Kids enjoyed them though, will make again with changes.

The flavor of these were okay but the minute they cooled the slightest bit they no longer had a good flavor. I also found that double dipping in the breadcrumbs kept them together better.

Turned out perfect! Best thing about this recipe is you can used cheddar sticks or mozza cheddar twisty sticks. Yes it is messy but that is because of the egg mixture but the taste is worth it!

Awesome! I followed other reviews and combined the flour mixture with the bread crumbs and dipped it in egg and the breadcrumbs twice. I also used half panko and froze the mozzarella before frying.

The flavor was good and my 3 year old liked them, but I'm not sure I'll be up for the mess and effort again. Might be easier to buy frozen ones and just heat up.  But we did make some with jalapeno cheese sticks and these turned out very tasty.

Terrific!  I will never, ever, buy pre-made mozza sticks again!  I did not use pre-packaged cheese sticks, instead I just cut up a large brick of mozzarella cheese and it worked just fine.  The important thing is to coat them really well to avoid "leaking" and remove them from the oil very quickly.
Thanks for this recipe!

Great recipe! I used homemade breadcrumbs and it just turned out great. However, I needed more salt, but that's the only "complaint". I also did these on a pan in oil and had no problems. Enjoy!

Not only is this a mess they turn out way too salty. I was disappointed. I thought with so many good reviews this was sure to taste as good if not better than store bought. Not at all! They are like licking a salt block. Also, as it ends up it is cheaper to buy store bought with the cost of cheese right now. MIGHT turn out okay if you use plain bread crumbs with just a TOUCH of Italian seasoning.

These were great. I didn't have cornstarch on hand, so I left it out and I didn't miss it. I battered mine in this order-egg, flour, egg, bread crumbs, egg, flour, egg, bread crumbs. They turned out nice and crispy and no cheese spilled out. They are very messy to make, but its worth it.

Super easy and yummy recipe!! The only change I made was I doubed the cheese sticks. I will make this again! Hope my boyfriend likes it as much as I did. I'm making it for him tomorrow as an appetizer for manicotti.  

5 stars!!

Very tasty and the cheese stayed in the fried portion.  I froze the cheese and then cooked for 45 seconds in a deep fryer.  This was my 4th attempt with our deep fryer and the first dish that has come out the way I wanted it to.

The recipe was great! Mozzarella sticks came out nice and golden. The trick is to make sure your stove (if you are using the stove) is not to hot or sticks will burn and nobody wants burn sticks. Overall I really enjoyed them.

Soggy, bland, greasy.  No real flavor.  We might try again, but I was not impressed.  Like others have said, it is easier to just buy some from the store.

These were so good!  I cut all the sticks in half and put most of them in the freezer.  I had a few sticks left over that I refrigerated.  The frozen sticks were not melted after frying and the refrigerated sticks leaked out of the batter after frying.  I preferred the refrigerated sticks since they melted inside.

Well, after a few personal mistakes, these ended up turning out very well! Just a little tip to others who may be short a few brain cells as I seem to be: Be sure to leave a good 2 inches of oil from the top of the pan! B/c if it spills over, it WILL cause a stove fire! But I'm sure most ppl will know that. Now, with that aside, after my outrageous mistake, the next night I tried making these again, and they turned out wonderful! I have a huge weakness for mozzarella sticks! So it was probably very dangerous for me to find this recipe! (In more ways than one!) :-) But they were very good, and not messy to make! Oh, and I ended up coating them 3 times, after only 2 coats, the cheese ran out. Thank you so much!

These were simply amazing.... i did use panko bread crumbs (plain) and seasoned it with some dried basil and parsley... My husband is not a big fan of cheese sticks but he liked them and said that they tasted  like they were ordered from a restaurant !! THAT'S A COMPLIMENT !!

A trick to making the best cheese sticks is placing them in the freezer as you make them - then fry them.  The cheese doesn't brake through the bread crumbs, but it is still very hot after frying.  My 15 year old son had so many compliments after making these for our party.

This recipe is soooooo good! I combined the flour/cornstarch mixture and the breadcrumb mixture and it did not affect the final product. I used Polly-O part skim mozzarella string cheese (9 sticks) and cut them in half to make 18 mozzarella sticks. I dipped them into the egg wash, then the breadcrumbs, the egg wash, and then the breadcrumbs again. Then I froze them for 20 minutes. Instead of deep-frying them, I put a few tablespoons of olive oil into a pan and pan-fried them. None of the cheese oozed out and the ending result was DEFINITELY restaurant-quality. Thanks!

We thought these were excellent!  I had about 1/2 block of mozzarella I had to use so I cut that up instead of cheese sticks & used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  I also double dipped mine & set the temp on my fryer at 350 (they wouldn't have been browned enough otherwise). Overall, good recipe.  Beats store bought.

How can you go wrong with fried cheese?! Be sure to throw the cheese in the freeze for a half hour or so before you start, it keeps them from melting and oozing all over the place.

I was excited to make these because I LOVE cheese sticks.  I had everything lined up like a conveyor line, and I used tongs to do the dipping in all of the batters.  There really was not a big mess.  I let them cook for about 40 seconds in the deep fryer, and fried them in peanut oil.  I used a second set of tongs to lay them on the paper towel to cool.  In the end I thought they were ok.  My husband didn't like them much, but my 7 yr old ate 6 of them.  I used string cheese, maybe next time I will use a block of mozzerella and the taste will be a little better.  I will probably make again!!  Thanks for sharing!!

I double coated these like recommended and they came out great. They don't sell these by me so it was great to be able to recreate them at home.

These were pretty good.  I don't have a deep fryer, so I used a nonstick pan with oil going up about 3/4.  Only way I was able to get these not to leak was by triple dipping, and putting them into the hot oil and immediatly flipping them over.  Like other users, I combined all the dry ingredients and have to say that cut down on the time a lot.

Thank you for this recipe. Yes, it can get messy... but so worth it!  I will never buy the frozen store bought cheese sticks again! These came out so yummy, crispy and not greasy at all. So yum in fact that I totally forgot to snap a pic before we all gobbled them down. I did read the reviews on this site and "double dipped" for a thicker coating. They tasted just like the ones that you get when you eat out cept not frozen!

This is going in the to make again box.

These were pretty good, I made a few modifications. I added garlic powder to the breadcrumb mixture. I omitted the flour/cornstarch mixture and double dipped the sticks in the egg wash and the breadcrumbs, then froze them for about 15 minutes. After frying the cheesesticks, I popped them in a 400 degree oven for about 7 minutes, to make sure the cheese was melted.

For an extra special treat, use fresh whole milk mozzarella.

Awsome!! I used regular crumbs & just added italian seasoning. I also double coated them. After coating I re-dipped in the egg & then in the crumbs as 1 coating doesn't look like enough. So quick, easy & delicious.

My family devoured these!  We couldn't eat dinner because we ate most of these and there are only 3 of us!  After coating the 1st time, I let set for 10 min, then double-dipped in egg & bread crumbs.  I baked them in 400 oven for 12 minutes. Next time I will freeze for 30 min. then cook longer to get the crust crispy.  Dipped in marinara sauce.  Definitely a keeper!

When I saw this recipe I was over the moon because these are a real favourite. I didn't have Italian seasoned breadcrumbs, so I added Italian seasoning to regular breadcrumbs. Same for the garlic salt, I added garlic powder to salt. The outcome was excellent, and I used tomato puree seasoned with black pepper and salt as a dip. Yummmm!

The cheese sticks come out beautifully and the coating looks just like restaurant quality! We like a bit more kick and will experiment with adding spices to the mix. Otherwise, a great recipe!

made for the boys as game food. they ate everyone. not sure they were any different than store bought, but they were still delicious and very easy to make. next time I will only use the egg yolk as the whites seemed to get goopy and made a mess.

This turned out great! I didn't have cornstarch and I dipped the cheese in the egg and breadcrumbs twice, but besides that the recipe was really good. The picky husband loved them. Thanks!

This recipe really hit the spot when we were in the mood for cheese sticks.  I ended up double coating my cheese (I had extra) and did these in 3 batches.  The first batch I did for 3 minutes, and it was too long, with most of the cheese cooking out resulting in empty tubes.  The second batch I cooked for about 2 minutes and these turned out much better.  The third batch I froze overnight and cooked the next day for a snack, and these turned out the best of all.  The frozen batch cooked for the 3-3.5 minutes called for in this recipe.  Thanks for the recipe, we'll be doing this again!

For this recipe I used a block of mozzarella instead of the string cheese and cut it into 1/2 inch strips. They cook fast so you have to keep a careful eye on them! Mine melted a bit but they were still delicious and were a hit with my guests.

These turned out so good- I'm amazed at how easy they really are to make. First of all, I completely forgot to add the cornstarch, so you actually don't even need it, and mine turned out great.  Second, these are very, very messy to make, but half way through I figured out an easy way to do it.  I used a toothpick to pierce each cheese stick, and used it to dip the stick in the egg mixture, bread crumbs, back to egg mixture, then again to the crumb mixture. After dipping, I just removed the toothpick and moved on to the next one.  Try it that way from the beginning and it will save you a lot of mess.  After coating all of the cheese sticks, I let them rest for about 15 minutes so the breading had a chance to adhere.  I served with my own recipe for marinara sauce- they were a huge hit with my family. I will never buy storebought cheese sticks again!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I made these for company last week.  I didn't have any bread crumbs on hand, so I put ritz crackers in my food processor and seasoned with garlic salt and oregano.   I also let them rest for 20 minutes before deep frying.  My company loved them! I sent the recipe home with them.

WOW..these turned out much better than I was expecting!  I had no problems with the cheese seeping out at all.  I used all cornstarch and mixed it with the bread crumbs.  I coated each piece twice--egg then bread crumbs, then egg then bread crumbs again.  Make sure to coat each inch of the cheese well!!!!!

So Good! I used a large block of mozzerella and cut into 1/4" slices, then cut them in half to make triangles. I followed the rest of the directions and they were delicious with jarred marinara simmered with fresh basil and sprinkled with parmasean cheese. Tasted better than most restuarants fried mozzerella!

When I made these, I left out the flour, but after I dipped them, I put them on a baking sheet and slipped them in the freezer for half a hour.  They fried up so easily that way!  I wasnt losing any of the breading to the foul oily depths of my wok!  lol

Great taste, minimal effort.  Perfect!

Just like they make at the roadhouse restaurants! However, I did tweak this a bit...we made our own cheese sticks by melting the mozzarella and making the sticks after it cooled, otherwise followed the recipe perfectly. Delicious!! Best served with Marinara Sauce, also found on this site. ;)

YUM!  This was sooo yummy, however - I took the advice of others on this site and double dipped some, but found I actually liked the ones only dipped once more!  Only a small amount of cheese seeped out of the crust it was fine.  Also, next time I'll leave out the garlic... it was a bit too much for me.

Made exactly as the recipe stated and they came out fantastic!  Personally, I've noticed a major taste difference depending on the cheese sticks used so I go for a higher quality, low moisture kind that seems to work better.  Even my mom ate this (she's picky!) Now I just need to find a homemade marinara sauce...

This was amazing! I followed some of the suggestions from past posters, and they came out perfect (i.e. dip the sticks in egg, then bread crumbs, then egg again, then bread crumbs again). I would suggest adding 1/2 again as much egg mixture and bread crumb mixture, as we ran out in the  middle of the recipe.

A couple of them oozed a lot, but the rest were really good. The recipe calls for way too much egg mix, and flour mix though - half would easily be enough. Thanks, Nanci!

Not sure if I did this  one properly, seemed easy but no matter how bread crumbs stuck to it the cheese went everywhere. Ended up in a gooey mess. May try again though.

I was amazed at this recipe.  I was betting on the fact that the cheese would ooze out everywhere.  Never happened?  These tasted like restaurant style.  So good I am planning to recommend it to my ex-husband!!   Can't keep this one to myself.  Made exactly as stated.

These sticks are better when breaded in a different order. First dip the mozzarella into the flour mixture, then the egg mixture, and then the bread crumbs. This will make a better coating so the cheese stays inside. Otherwise - delicious!

this recipes failed me.  the cheese melted outside of the breading on half and the other half the breading wasn't crispy.  i know something went wrong, maybe it was me, i used the deep fryer on the right temp, so it wasnt that.  but  i wont be making these.  if i want them i will eat them at a restaurant or buy frozen ones.

My daughter and I added more garlic salt to taste and completely breaded the sticks before freezing them for a few hours and they came out divine! Excellent taste and texture! Our new go to cheese stick recipe for sure!

These tasted delicious this is the second recipe I tried. I did change a few things and they turned out perfect and didn’t leak mozzarella everywhere. I did the flour, egg bread crumb then I repeated the egg and breadcrumb a second time. It makes the outside thicker and prevented them from losing the mozzarella, also make sure that the mozzarella is coated completely. I also did freeze them for about an hour,  that helps a lot too. I made them with the whole milk Galbani mozzarella and served them with the Newman’s Own marinara SOOO good Yummy!!!! Everyone loved them.

Like any recipe that requires battering, the prep for these mozzarella sticks was pretty messy, but the end result is amazing. After reading some reviews I made a few changes: 

- I dipped once in flour, and twice in the egg and breadcrumb mixture. This gave the breadcrumb crust a nice texture and thickness and may have prevented the cheese from oozing out of gaps in the coating, but if you're planning on freezing the battered cheese sticks before frying I think only one coat is necessary.
- I froze my cheese sticks for about an hour before frying. This stopped the cheese from oozing in the fryer, but after 30 seconds of frying, the cheese was still cold in the center. I would recommend frying a bit longer or microwaving before serving in order to get that stringy effect when you pull the cheese sticks apart.

They were awesome! One small tip : double dip the egg and breading stage - Do that stage twice. Must be fully coated so cheese won't leak out. Cook no more than 30 seconds.

I liked these alot. I had no problems with any kind of mess. I followed the recipe exactly (except I cut them in half) and they came out prefect. I used a deep fryer set at 365 and they were not over done or messy. They came out perfect.

I thought it was really simple and a great recipe.  I cut them in half before dipping but I went by the recipe and it turned out great.  I would urge you to watch carefully.  30 seconds is sufficient and if you cook any longer the oil will get dark and the cheese stick will fall apart. We loved it.

Just tried this and it was okay. But you don't need to add garlic salt, they were very garlic-y. Something tells me that regular bread crumbs with garlic powder would be just as good.

This recipe is delicious! I have fried regular mozzarella cheese sticks, jalapeno, and Colby. Our favorite by far is the jalapeno - even for a wimpy, NON fire eater like me! I followed a couple of suggestions and mixed the cornstarch and bread crumbs together. I battered them twice though, and I put the cheese in the freezer before battering. (I'd hate to see what would have happened if I didn't, some of the cheese still leaked a bit anyway, but nothing major.) Please. Do. Try!

I liked this recipe a lot after a couple changes. I froze the mozzarella beforehand. I also did not deep fry them. Deep frying without a deep fryer is tricky! So, after a couple slightly burnt, very smokey, deep-fried sticks, we switched to pan frying them. It worked great! They were a delicious addition to our homemade bar food night.

It worked for me. I used fresh mozzarella and sliced into half moon shapes. They were about 1/4 inch thick. I froze them first. The trick is to make sure the oil is hot, and you have to work quickly. Only drop a few at a time so you can manage turning them over and scooping out quickly.

This recipe is tasty and very simple! I used a block of mozzarella cheese (not a very large one, and I got 16 pieces out of it) instead of the cheese sticks. I didn't have the corn starch, but it was fine without it. I just mixed the dry ingredients together, did a double dip with the egg mixture and dry ingredients, and put them in the freezer for about an hour. Once I took them out, it only took a few minutes to cook them all (I used a skillet on the stove). Tasty and very economical!

Truly great.  I did not combine flour & bread crumbs & thought the extra step was worth it.  I did cut the cheese sticks in half.  Made it easier to handle.  This is without a doubt a new family favorite.

Fantastic! I used 2% milk instead of the egg wash and I cut my mozzarella sticks in half and froze them for an hour and a half before coating. I fried them in my deep fryer at 375 for about 45 seconds. Turned out perfect!

I cut sticks in half as others suggested. Double dipped in egg, four and breadcrumbs.  I seasoned the breadcrumbs with garlic powder, season salt and ground ginger. Froze on wax paper lined pan for 20 minutes then fried 4 at a time, they turned perfect!!!! Crispy on the outside, gooey on the inside!  Dipped in homemade honey mustard, equal parts honey, mustard and mayo, yum!!!

Made these a couple times already and had to review after my kids tried them tonight for the first time.  They asked me to put this on a regular rotation of meals!  They loved it!  I followed everything, except substituted plain bread crumbs with a couple tablespoons of italian seasoning since i did not already have flavored bread crumbs.  Little messy to make but very, very worth it!  Thank you NANCI RENN!

These were delish.. I took the advice of other reviewers and froze the cheese for about 20 mins before coating. I would've froze longer but hungry children were rushing me :) i also didn't add water to the eggs bc I just didn't see a reason to. They turned out great. I did have to dip a few of them twice in the egg and bread crumbs to make sure they were totally coated. Ate them with a side of marinara for dipping. Super easy and tasty. Thanks for the recipe!

These were really good, I did cut mine in half. I also added the powder ranch dressing to the bread crumbs instead of itilian seasoning..

This recipe did not work for me because the coating does not adequately seal and protect the mozzarella sticks from melting and escaping into the frying oil.  For starters, the eggs are excessively thinned and lose their ability to effectively hold the bread crumbs. Only a teaspoon or so of water should be added to the beaten eggs.  Even with less thinned eggs it is still necessary to coat the cheese sticks three or four times; once with flour and two or three times with bread crumbs (egg wash between each dry coating). Oil can be as hot as 375F.  The shorter time the cheese sticks are in the oil the less chance there is of the coating breaking and the cheese melting into the oil or oil into cheese stick. The need for cornstarch in the flour is questionable. Do not use toasted bread crumbs or panko.  Adding a teaspoon of onion powder improved the flavor of the breading.

Made this with my high school cooking class....they were a huge hit! These kids order cheese sticks for lunch at a local resturant twice a week and they said these are way better! They liked them so much we are making them for the second time today! Thanks for the recipe.

Fantastic recipe, came out just like my favorite bar/restaurant cheese sticks. I did follow other recommendations and froze the cheese first. Make sure if your making these your not doing anything else, it really does cook fast and even with the cheese frozen takes no time for the cheese to start oozing out if your not paying enough attention.

I modified this recipe after trying making it the way listed above. It didn't have the flavor I was looking for so I started playing with it and came up with this and my family LOVED them. I mixed 3 eggs in a bowl, poured Italian flavored bread crumbs on a plate mixed with garlic powder not garlic salt, I'm not a huge salt person, then on another plate I put flour on it. I cut up the mozzarella to desired size, dipped it in the egg mixture, then the bread crumb mixture, back in the egg mixture, then into the flour, back into the egg mixture, and finally back into the bred crumb mixture. Seems like a lot, but it gave it great flavor and a good breading on it (we liked it with a little bit of a thicker breading) 

side note: I used my hands and had to wash them after making a few mozzarella sticks because the mixture would stick to my hands, so if you don't like getting your hands dirty I don't suggest this for you. =)

Followed some of the suggestions in the other reviews and they turned out great!  I think it is really important to double dip the mozzarella sticks into the mixture to get that thick coating on each the cheese stick.  My family loved these cheese sticks and we will definitely have them again.

These are great!  Super easy to do and man, what a hit!  I followed some other ideas of double coating and cutting the cheese sticks in half before doing the dipping.  I didn't have enough oil to fully dip the sticks into, it ened up covering half of the stick so i turned with a fork so both sides were golden.  Will be making again!

These were so amazingly awesome that I could have sworn I was eating at a restaurant that serves these! If you want to avoid the mess of the mozzarella leaking out while frying, the solution is so simple it almost hurts . . . make sure it's coated evenly and well with the egg so that the bread crumbs have the whole surface to stick to. Sure, you may still get some melty cheese leaking here or there, but really, you're frying cheese, and if you expect that not to be messy then you've really never cooked before. I've made these 3 or 4 times now, and my fiancee and mom are always begging for more. They even microwave pretty well for mozzarella sticks (it helps them stay crispy if they're on a paper towel in the micro, just be careful that they don't start leaking, because they don't take long at all to reheat! 20-30 seconds or so). Oh, and add seasoned salt, garlic salt, and pepper to the breadcrumbs if you want a little extra oomph (or are lacking in dipping sauces! LOL My mistake the 2nd time around), otherwise a good bbq, ranch, or marinara goes great with these, with or without the added spices.

This was my first time every deep frying and it went very well. The only thing I would do differently next time is let the string cheese get to room temperature first. Can't wait to make these again!

I give this 5 stars for taste and texture and about 4 1/2 stars for technique. The only thing that I changed in this was dipping it in egg first then flour and bread crumbs. By the time the cheese stick gets to the bread crumbs it didnt want to stick so i dipped it in egg then flour then egg again and then finally bread crumbs and it coated it well and came out perfectly crispy and melty. If you like gooey cheese sticks then let them cool for a few minutes before eating. I deep fried them for about 1 minute instead of 30 seconds because i wanted a good color to them. Great recipe!

Surprisingly good - I've been looking for a mozarella cheese stick recipe and found it!  The only problem I had was figuring out when they were done - the next time I make these I will coat the cheese first (through bread crumbs) and then cook several at once (I cooked one at a time - which probably led to the inconsistency).  I used regular bread crumbs and added 1 1/2 teaspoons of Italian Seasoning.

These were amazing!!  I did dip them in the batter twice though to make the coating a little thicker.  I also don't have a deep fryer so I heated vegetable oil on the stove over med-high heat.  Fairly easy to make & DELICIOUS!

These were really good and surprisingly easy to make. I took other reviewers advice and froze my mozzarella sticks before hand and I doubled dipped them. Will make again. May not freeze next time though because they were not as gooey as I would have liked.

I was amazed how easy and fun these were to make. The breading stayed on well and double dipping worked out well.  Of course it was messy but that's the fun part, luckily the batter washes off pretty easily. Next time I am going to try a variety of block cheeses.

I am a mozzarella sticks freak so this recipe was like a godsend. Although, the breading made it a little dry on the outside. Not sure what I did wrong =[

Took another reviewer's advice. Used no flour, no cornstarch. Cut in half. Put in freezer for an hour and a half. Tasted just like a restaurant's appetizer. Delicious!

Left out the corn starch because I didn't have any and just mixed the flour/bread crumbs/garlic salt together and dipped the cheese sticks in the egg, the the flour mixture, patted gently and once more in the egg and then flour mixture. A little messy but fun to make and they are yummy.Definite hit with the teenager in the house.

These were amazing! I follow the advice to get them all ready before frying.  Everyone loved them and I thought they were easy to make.  I used fresh mozzarella cheese and seasoned the  flour with Italian seasoning,salt,pepper, red peppers,basil.  THIS IS A KEEPER

Great basic recipe, but more seasoning is always a plus, in my book!  I also had a hard time at the end of the batch because my dry mix got too wet, and I actually had to "pat" it on-- and the sticks with all that thick batter weren't as tasty as the ones from the beginning of the batch.  Next time, I'll split my dry ingredients into two or three bowls so when one portion gets too moist, I can just move on to the next fresh (dry!) portion and get consistent results all the way through.  (But, really, you just can't go wrong with breaded, fried CHEESE at any rate!)

These were great. My boys like to order these when we eat out so they were amazed that I could make them at home. I took the advice of others and mixed the bread crumbs and flour mixtures and dipped twice. During the breading process be sure to keep one hand dry and the other wet. This is time consuming but my 14 year old helped with the frying while I finished the coating. Well worth it!

I made these, but the flour mixture would not stick to the cheese, so i just dipped the cheese in the egg, then the bread crumbs, then repeated those steps 2 or 3 times...the end result was decent...i loved how gooey they were, but with the garlic salt, they were way too salty for my taste...next time I will not use the garlic salt.  Other than that, they were wonderful!  The cheese was just the way i like it...gooey.  Most that I get from restaurants are just kinda like eating a string cheese stick.

This was an excellent recipe! I love bread sticks and these were some of the best I've ever had.  Halfway thru, I combined the "flour" part to the "crumb" part, this was easier, and just as good.  I liked mine double breaded.  I didn't have a bunch of bread crumbs, so I used some crumbled Ritz + breadcrumbs.

These were delish! I took advice from other reviewers and just mixed the flour and cornstarch in with the breadcrumbs and did a double coating. I will try freezing the cheese before using next time as others suggested to keep the cheese from oozing, which mine did but was still a hit! Thanks for this fab recipe!

This was a pretty good recipe.  I tried one batch using the information as is, and the mozzarella sticks did not hold their shape too well as there was leaking.  The second batch I double coated and they came out so much better.  I didn't have garlic salt, so I used 1/2 garlic powder and 1/2 salt, although I think I will just use garlic powder next time because they didn't need the salt in my opinion.  I also didn't have a mess, I picked up the sticks and dipped them in all the ingredients carefully using tongs and none of the coating was removed...easier to take care of my 4 month old when I don't have to constantly wash my hands!  All in all, good recipe, fun to make and the best part...a great way to use up leftover mozzarella!

This recipe was great! But After dipping the cheese into the bread crumbs I redipped it in the egg and back into the bread crumbs to make a thicker layer of breading. I also fried it for 35 seconds instead of 30 seconds.  It turned out great! The breading is thicker and holds the cheese in better and 35 seconds melts the cheese a little better.

Pretty good. Fun and easy to make. My cheese was not stringy though, it was very firm. Next time I'll let the cheese thaw before making these.

My rating scale (cause number of stars is subjective): 1-Didn't like it, 2-It's okay, 3-Liked it, 4-Loved it, 5-Can't get enough of it. Very messy to make but when a craving hits, it sure beats the frozen variety!

It was delicious! We all loved it! I froze the cheese sticks ahead of time, and coated them twice, and they didn't leak! I used regular bread crumbs, but added parsley and garlic powder to them. Will definitely be making again!!

Very good!  Better than any restaurant - because I was in control the salt!  I just used garlic salt and italian seasoning and made my own bread crumbs.  WARNING...I tried baking, but I didn't have any luck.  The cheese expanded out of the coating, but we just let them cool and they tasted great (presentation no so great) If anyone has any luck at baking, please let me know.

These sticks were mediocre at best.  I didn't care for them as much as I thought I would.  Maybe it was the Italian breading that didn't taste right, not sure.  However, my husband liked them quite well.

The first time I have ever had sticks turn out right! I followed other suggestions and combined the flour, cornstarch, and breadcrumbs.  I double coated some and triple coated others and had no problem with leaking.  It was so easy and delicious!

These are delicious!  I tried a few reviewers' suggestions: I put the cheese (string chesse cut in half) in the freezer for a few minutes while I mixed the other stuff and heated the oil.  I mixed all the dry stuff together, using parmesan bread crumbs, 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1/2 tsp. salt, and about 2 tbsp. italian seasonings.  I did the dry/wet hand method suggested by another reviewer.  There was plenty of dry stuff that I could push over the wet cheese so that my dry hand stayed dry.  I did double dip for two layers of breading.  I put all the breaded cheeses on a cookie sheet when they were done and then fried them in a deep fryer, 8 at a time.  I counted to about 40 and then pulled them out.  The breading had wonderful flavor!  I will probably use less flour/cornstarch next time as I had a lot of dry mix left at the end.  A few of them oozed a little and some were still a bit firm in the middle, so I'm not sure if I'd do the freezing thing first again.  I don't mind a little oozing and I'd rather have them all melty inside.  We dipped them in some leftover sauce from the World's Best Lasagna recipe here on AllRecipes.  I'll definitely be making these again as everyone in my family loves them!

These were good, but a heck of a lot of work and a quite messy. I would suggest the a double coating of the cheese with the bread crumbs to really have a good breading. I've made them a few times and always hesitate to because how tedious it is. If you want to put in the work, they're yummy!

Seasoning was a little bland for my taste but with some extra garlic and onion powder, everybody loved it!
Make sure you get the oil hot enough or your cheese will leak out of the crust like my first batch, but it tasted good anyway.
Thanks for the recipe

I love this recipe!  I omitted the cornstarch and added just a bit more flour.  I froze the mozzarella for about 30 minutes, double battered, and froze the battered sticks again for about 30 minutes.  I served them with chicken parmesan (submitted by Mollie Hall on this site), and it was the best dinner we've had in a while!

It was a great recipe, like the other readers, I double coated the mozz. sticks. The only suggestion I have is two things 1. add some spice to the bread mix (as I thought it was a bit bland) 2. add some Panko to the bread mixture. It's an Japanese breading and it should make it more crispy. Other than that it was delicious!!

i guess i'm just too used to restaurant quality mozzarella sticks...because these were just okay.  and frankly, they were too much work to make it worth it.  deep frying just isn't my thing.  but my husband really liked them, so i suppose it's just a matter of personal opinion!

I tried to follow the recipe along with other's advice, but mine still leaked everywhere and it was a big mess. It did taste good and I'm not picky enough not to eat some fried cheese, even if it is in a glob..But I won't try making this again.

These cheese sticks tasted good but it was alot of work to prepare them.  I double coated the cheese and I used pepper jack cheese as well as mozzarella.  It was fun to try these but I won't make them again because they are so labor intensive and there are very good frozen alternatives.

These were pretty good. I used a 1 lb block of mozzarella cheese and cut them into little rectangles. I did have to batter the cheese twice, which meant I had to double the egg and flour mixture. I froze the cheese for 20 mins before frying them and a few still leaked. I did make more than what we could eat in one sitting, so I froze the rest. When I cooked them, they didn't leak so maybe that's the secret. I wanted to mention that using the block cheese made the sticks very stringy just like the restaurants (I read some reviewers complain that their sticks did not pull strings when eaten). Anyhow, I don't think it was worth the mess/ trouble because they tasted just like the frozen kind.

These were simple to make and tasted exactly like you would find in a Chili's-style restaurant.  Like many of the other reviewers, I cut in half first to make a smaller sized cheese stick, and also double-coated.  Serve with marinara sauce as the perfect accompaniment.

Very good, restaurant quality.  Make sure to keep the temperature of the oil at 365; if it dips, the cheese sticks are liable to leak.

These were the messiest things I've ever made. I had goop all over my hands, all over the counters and all over the entire kitchen. And the end result wasn't worth it at all. You could buy cheese sticks like those in the frozen section at Wal-Mart. I've been looking for a recipie for fried cheese balls for a long time now. I was hoping this would be similiar but it wasn't. I won't try this again. Sorry!

My husband hated these. I didn't think they were so bad, but its more work than I wanted to put into something that is so unappreciated. He likes his Farm Rich cheese stick out of the freezer section, I think I will stick with those. Thanks for letting me try! PS These are done really fast, I kept turning them until they were brown. But if you wait too long (even a second), the coating will pop off the cheese.

These are wonderful.  I dipped once into the flour mixture and twice into the breadcrumb mixture.  My 10 yr old son devoured them, and they got the tumbs up from my boyfriend.  These are way better then store bought, and at a fraction of the price ! mmmmmm goood

These are so easy to make.  I dipped in egg, flour, egg, and then bread crumbs per other reviews.  Make sure you don't forget to cover the ends with the mixtures otherwise the cheese will escape from there.  I heated oil in the skillet on the stove.  Be sure to watch them closely because they brown fast.  I also didn't check the temperature before frying...I just adjusted based on the time they took to cook without burning them.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These were the best! I double dipped as suggested in other reviews. I didn't have italian bread crumbs only plain so I added basil, parsley and thyme to the plain crumbs. My 6 and 8 yo and 2 yo twins gobbled them up. I cut my cheese in half before dipping, that made them easier to handle. They fry up really quickly so don't walk away from your fryer. Thanks for the great recipe.

this turned out just like the restaurants. i skipped on the flour. i added garlic powder, instead of garlic salt. also i added onion powder and italian seasoning to my garlic and herb bread crumbs. i did both single dip and double dip. single was just too thin a crust, probably because i didnt use flour. the double dipped sticks turned out perfect! no cheese leakage on the double dipped ones. my husband loved this!

This recipe is AMAZING!! I just finished making a batch and my guests are complaining about burnt tongues--they're eating them almost as soon as I scoop the sticks out of the fryer! I usually make my sticks at home with bread flour, wrapping the cheese with ham and securing with a toothpick. It makes like little fried ham & cheese sandwich sticks. But I adore the "fast food" kind(but they're so expensive!!), so I gave these a try. Am I ever glad I did!

My family LOVED them!! They were gone in a flash. I double dipped some and triple dipped some. None of them leaked until towards the end when my breadcrumb mixture was just a big crumbly mess and was hard to keep on. I took other reviewers' advice and added quite a bit of extra italian seasoning. I will have to say that I found them bland even with the extra italian seasoning. I will have to come up with something to add more flavor. It was messy, but when isn't it messy when you have to not only batter something once, but two or three times? My husband says I'm in trouble because now he's going to request them!

These were not at all restaurant quality following the directions as written and had no flavor. Will try again but will follow some of the other suggestions listed by other reviewers or just keep getting the frozen variety and deep frying those.

This was an excellent recipe. I tried it out with sliced marble cheese. Added a little more Italian seasoning and garlic powder. Skipped the flour/starch and double dipped the sticks. The key to the cheese not leaking is a very quick hot fry. 
Thanks for the recipe. I will be a hit at my party this weekend!

Made this because hubby is a HUGE cheese fan and my son loves any cheese he can get his hands on.  Seriously is there anything better than fried cheese.  I used cheddar and mozzarella.  I also used the advice of other reviewers and double coated the breading so that I wouldn't have the oozing problem when fried.  Thanks for the post.  Delicious.

These turned out great, like other reviewers I fried then let them rest on parchment paper for about five minutes then fried again, they turned out perfect.  Thanks for the post.

These were terrific!  Definitely use a deep fryer instead of a pan.  Lower them into the fryer for about 45 seconds for a perfect turnout.

These were pretty good, but I think next time I make them I will use about 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder then add some seasoned salt and a little cayenne pepper.  Thank you very much for this recipe!

These were a little messy when dipping and coating, but they were tastey.  I used block mozzarella and sliced into 1/4" thick x 3/4" wide x 2-1/2" long pieces.  Instead of Italian bread crumbs, I used a blender and chopped white toast into a fairly fine consistency.  I added about 1/4 teaspoon of Italian seasoning to the bread crumbs.  Don't deep fry too long or the coating will get too dark and the cheese will start to ooz.  We dipped these in pizza sauce from a jar.

I LOVED this recipe. I didn't have any cornstarch and it still worked out great. I did have to double dip in the eggs and bread crumbs. I didn't have any trouble with the cheese leaking out. I think the key is to have the oil hot enough so that they don't have to stay in very long to get browned.

These were very good.  I used string cheese and it was very soft and mushy, although the breading was nice & crispy! Next time I think I will cut up a block of mozz, will probably work better.

These are really good.  I make them in the deep fryer.  I use frozen string cheese and double dip in the egg and bread crumbs as others have suggested.  Barilla Marinara makes great dipping sauce. TFS.

These were great!  I also double-dipped in the egg and then the bread crumbs again.  I had no problems with the cheese coming out, maybe check the temp?  There was barely any mess.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These turned out great. They were a little messy & I started getting some clumps in the breadings after a while, but that's to be expected. I added plain salt to the bread crumbs, too. I also double dipped these: some in only the bread crumbs, some in the flour mixture, too & they all turned out the same. The extra dip made a difference! They were awesome though and my hubby loved them.

I made this for my son and he really enjoyed it.  I left a couple in the fryer (by accident)longer than thirty seconds and they started to ooze.  After learning from that mistake...I kept them in at the suggested time and the remaining cheese sticks were really good.

This batter needed salt.  After making that one change, it tasted great.  I would definitely make this again.  Thanks!

Looks fun and easy to make! But if I don’t have any all-purpose flour, can I substitute it with something else? :)

Best EVER!  My 11 yr old and her friend made them,  I fried, and  they are delicious!   Can't stop eating them!!!

Notes:  the girls cut the stick in 1/2,, double dipped as suggested and then froze for a hour. Fried 1 to 2 mins each batch of 4 to 5 sticks

YES we WILL make these again and again.  Yum!!

Turned out amazing! So easy but everyone is so impressed! I added red pepper flakes when I made my own breadcrumbs and Italian seasoning for this. Added just a little red pepper flakes for I hint of heat at the end.

My son was here when I made them and he said he loved them.  He wants me to make them again this weekend. lol

Only thing I changed was I bought a block of pollyo mozzarella cheese, and cooked in a fry daddy.  Was sick of going to restaurants and being served obviously frozen fried moz.  This recipe with the fresh cheese was AMAZING.

Super easy, just a little messy. I dipped them into the egg wash and bread crumbs 2 or 3 times before frying. Awesome! Also use garlic herb flavored bread crumbs.

I didn't have time freezing it on my first batch. Fortunately I haven't cooked everything. I'll be creating another batch then .

I can't deep fry because it's a waste of good oil. I only did a shallow fry. Had I frozen it, it may have not leaked. I'm still satisfied of the outcome.

I didn't however made measurements on how many breadcrumbs to italian seasoning to garlic ratio.

These turned out great!  We put in freezer for 20 min or so before dropping in hot grease based on another recipe.  There didn't appear to be enough breading but it worked out just right once fried up.

I make this all the time but..I flour, egg, bread crumb and freeze.  Then I egg, bread crumb and freeze again before frying.  Another thing if you want them crunchy, mix panko with flavored crumbs.  I add extra seasonings too.

I followed the recipe and they turned out great!! Best recipe for mozz sticks I've found so far. Cheese didn't leak, came out nice and cheeseyyyy! Other reviewers said to double batter, I did that to a couple. In my opinion double batter was not as good as how the recipe states. Everyone says it helps the cheese not tun but the cheese didn't run anyways so I wouldn't bother! Great recipe!!

I dont know how so many people couldnt do this. It was extremely easy and quick to do. One recommendation though, id add more garlic salt, could use more flavor.

First dip in the egg, then breadcrumb flour mixture, then egg again then breadcrumb flour mixture and fully coat each stick! I did NOT need to freeze the sticks first!  It was amazing! I am giving this 4 stars because the recipe is spot on, but I changed the way I coated the sticks for optimal turn out. I did not use italian breadcrumbs nor did I use garlic salt.Also I think it may matter that I used corn oil and waited until the oil was very hot. I did not use too much oil but just enough to fry them, not immerse them.

Tips: 
Crushed Stove Top stuffing for my breadcrumbs instead.  VERY GOOD choice.
Used mozzarella cheese balls instead of sticks-- too much flour/breadcrumbs leftover.   As they cooled, they shrunk/like curds

This recipe works but yes like other reviews said with some changes it's better.   I suggest only 2 dips per mix then fry....I tried 3 dips per and the coating was too thick but thankful it actually worked.  Freeze cheese before coating and when frying 350 degrees is high enough and cook only one to two mins max or you lose the cheese and batter super dark crispy.   I also don't see the point in using cornstarch.  But thanks for sharing.

I have to cook gluten-free, and I made this recipe using gluten-free bread crumbs and gluten-free flour.  It turned out really well; this is our go-to recipe for when we're craving mozzarella cheese sticks.  ( Another reviewer said to make sure the mozzarella sticks are super-cold before frying them, and I agree (I tried one time using sticks that had been sitting out for about 30 minutes, and it created a gooey mess.)

Tasty! I skipped the cornstarch and flour using bread crumbs and eggs only. I took the advice of another reviewer by freezing the cheese first, which worked like a charm. I do think this recipe works better pan fried instead of deep fried.

We had to make mozzarella sticks for 30 people! They turned out amazing once we figured out how to Coat them properly. They taste amazing and you don't need to freeze the cheese.

Great recipe, very easy to make and turn out delicious. First time I made it was in a whim and I didn't have the ingredients so had to substitute a bit, like italian bread crumbs, I nuked a hot dog bun til it was dried out then powdered it and added italian seasoning, instead of cheese sticks I had shredded so nuked it til it melted then formed it into sticks and refrigerated, second time I had everything in hand, both times they turned out delicious.. I added a bit of salt and pepper to the flour mix. Great recipe for a hot delicious snack in minutes

DEFINITELY freeze stick before hand. We rushed the first batch and they melted into a puddle and sunk to the bottom. Don't just season the bread crumbs, season the flour and eggs too. After 3 steps of breading, do another layer of egg and crumbs to get a better seal and thicker crust (and therefore more flavor).

My daughter helped me make these and we loved them!  I think they came out better than the ones at restaurants.   It's important to make sure the cheese gets covered in egg then covered completely with the bread crumbs. We had a few that had patches with no crumbs. Although they were still tasty, they weren't picture perfect. Most of them were though!

These were really yummy, but I quickly found out I couldn't follow the recipe exactly. First, I used egg whites (that's all I had.) Second, I ended up having to double coat the cheese sticks. The first couple I made ended up breaking and oozing all over. So I dipiped them in the flour/corn starch, then the egg whites, then the bread crumb mixture, then flour/corn starch, egg whites, and bread crumbs again. Those ones turned out much better. My kids loved them--even my daughter who isn't a fan of cheese sticks usually.

Combine the cornstarch, garlic salt, 1 c. seasoned breadcrumbs, and 1/2 c. plain panic in a bowl.  Plain flour in another bowl. 2 beaten eggs in another bowl.  Dip the half-sticks in flour, then egg, then crumb mixture and put on foil-lined cookie sheet. Keep going. Now some of the wet egg is showing thru the coating. SOTHEN go back and roll them one more time in the bread-crumb-panko mixture. Onto the foil pan and into the freezer for at least 30 minutes.  PERFECT every time ;-)

It is messy but I expect that with frying anything. I suggest not using the cornstarch. I also put the flour in with the bread crumbs and dipped 2 times in each. The cheese still ended up leaking out, but they were good. I will still be looking for the trick to hold in the cheese.

Take heed on the advice to freeze the cheese before putting it in the fryer. If I was to give this a rating it would be 5 stars for the flavor and 2 stars for presentation. I would definitely make this again but the cheese would have to be frozen it made such a mess in my basket and took me forever to clean. It is hard to rate this because the recipe itself was excellent but leaving out the fact that the cheese is going to melt through kind of negates the goodness about this recipe. will rate this a 2 in hope that you read my review and save yourself some time cleaning later.

These were super easy & very good! I followed the recipe as is & had no problems what-so-ever! Next time I will double dip them to get a thicker crust, which is why I rated a 4 instead of 5.

I substituted cracker crumbs for bread crumbs.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as written until I cooked the first batch.  They didn't hold up well with a single dip.  I ran the remaining sticks through the breading process a second time and they came out better.  I will follow that same procedure with future batches.  Over all they came out great.

So easy and soooo good. I read the reviews and put the breaded sticks in the freezer for a couple of hours before frying. Worked great. My last few started to leak, so put them back in the freezer for a bit. I used a combination of Cheddar and Mozzarella sticks.

This recipe came out tasting very good. The breading did not hold up very well unless you cook them longer but then you risk leaking out your cheese. Possibly freezing them for a few minutes would have been a good idea first.

Overall they were very tasty! It was just a bit difficult to coat the sticks in the bread crumbs especially after I had already done a few of them. I wouldn't recommend buying the cheapest Italian bread crumbs. They probably should've been a little bit finer. They were still fun and easy to make though :)

I double dipped like most users recommended. I had a big bag  of string cheese from Costco we took 8 sticks, cut in half and used 1 cup instead of 1 1/2 cups bread crumbs.  They were delicious.  I was very happy with the outcome.  Last time I bought frozen ones I was disappointed in the lack of melty, gooey heaven.  This recipe gave exactly what I wanted.

You definitely have to double dip these.  Coat in either flour or cornstarch (but it's not necessary for both), then egg, crumbs, egg, and crumbs again.  I make these in large batches and freeze them after breading, that way I can store them in a baggie in the freezer and cook as many or as few as I want at the time.  Oil no hotter than 350, and when you see the first bit of cheese seeping out of the crust on any sticks, they're done.

They weren't bad.  Very easy to make.  Just prefer battered cheese sticks.

This was the first time I've made cheese sticks but since my 16 year old son requested them for his birthday, I decided to give them a try.  I used progresso Italian Panko bread crumbs, froze the cheese sticks beforehand and used a deep fryer.  I cut the cheese sticks in half and dipped them in the egg mixture, then the flour mixture, them egg again, and then the bread crumbs.  They were a huge hit!! Everyone liked them.

I got a new deep fryer for xmas so I'm rummaging through the fridge for stuff to deep fry and came across the kids remaining mozzarella string cheese. I knew the temp in this recipe was too high so stuck with 340-350 degrees for an even cook. I also double dipped and rolled the cheese sticks for a thicker crust. 1 min or so in the fryer ( get a nice medium dark brown on them) and perfect. Nice recipe, we all liked it. Our daughter took her first bite and pulled the gooey cheese the length of her arm.

Cut the cheese sticks in half this makes them easier to work with. Mix the flour with the bread crumbs and nix the cornstarch, dip the cheese in plain flour first to help the egg stick, then dip in crumbs, eggs again, then again in breadcrumbs/flour mix you will have a nice thick coating on them. Place them on a baking sheet covered in wax paper as you assemble them, then when you finish place the the tray in the freezer for about 30 minutes! This keeps the cheese from melting the second it hits the oil and allows the coating to get crisp first

When I forze them, I literally counted to 30 and took them out. Any longer and the cheese will come out. Very yummy! Low prep and cooktime, PLUS a lot cheaper than ordering it! (Not to mention I like knowing what goes into my sons food) Definitely a keeper for the recipe book :-)

I really enjoyed these. I froze my mozzarella sticks and cut them in half as others suggested and there was no mess. I'm not really sure what the need is for adding water to the eggs. This didn't help the batter stick very well, so I had to re-dip and batter again. Next time I'll be eliminating the water.

I cut the mozzarella sticks in half to decrease the cooking time, Heated the oil to 350 degrees and combined the bread crumbs and flour mixtures and used Panko bread crumbs  instead. rule of thumb always freeze what your going to fry beforehand. try with cocktail sauce too

It seems to be a pretty good recipe but I found it very hard to keep the cheese coating on the mozzarella stick. I dipped it twice as stated in egg and bread crump mix. However it became very clumpy and then even hard to stick. It does have a good taste and seems healthier than buying the frozen kind. I hope to find out other ways to keep bread crumbs on the cheese.

These were awesome!  I also made up my sticks with the coating, and then put them in the freezer for a bit.  350 oil and done in about 30 to 40 seconds and YUMMY!!!!  I never buy those frozen ones again in the store.  I also mixed the dry ingredients together for less work.  Fantastic!

I loved this recipe!! The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because the first time I made it just as the recipe calls and it was good but the next time I didn't have the cornstarch and I used Italian panko instead of breadcrumbs and it was to die for! Thanks so much!!

Turned out good I made a few changes. Didn't add milk or water I just used Italian bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese and garlic, dipped cheese sticks in  eggs and then in bread crumbs and dipped them in eggs and then the crumbs again and then fried it for about 45 seconds

For those that dont like the starch egg crumbs combo, the starch is there to keep the breadcrumbs from adhering to the cheese directly. Makes them way easier to reheat later as well as provide a flavor barrier. Its a great way to do it and I'm glad to see it.

These were delicious! My husband loves Mozzarella Sticks and said these were definitely keepers. :) I must have had my oil hotter than 365, because mine were done in well under 30 seconds. I only dipped them once, but may try a double dip in the future for more coating.

when i first thought about making mozzarella sticks, i discarded the idea due to thinking that it would be too much work. when the cravings proved to much, i caved in and decided too make them; and boy, was I wrong! this recipe is really easy, although i do have two tips. 1, make a double/triple/quadruple/etc. recipe. otherwise, the clean up makes it rather not-worth-it. 2, double coat. otherwise, a) the cheese leaks out, and b), it's not quite crispy enough.

This recipe is FANTASTIC if it is coated well with the flour mix and egg
Make sure not to burn it while frying.

Quite simple to make after viewing the video and following the instructions of freezing cheese sticks first.  However, I will need to work on cutting my cheese sticks just a bit thicker.  I would rather make these any time than buy the over priced frozen brands.  The only thing is you can really find yourself over indulging and very stopped up!

Delicious! Made a huge batch and froze half to pop in the oven for later! Everyone loved these- the cheese was extra creamy and the breading was nice and light and crispy! This is a keeper!

So good! I made a slightly healthier version and used a lower fat cheese stick and used unbleached whole wheat white flour. Froze it before cooking - woooowwwzzzaaah!

Perfect. Thanks for the delicious recipe. We double breaded them by redipping in the egg and then in the bread again. We also put them in the freezer for at least 30 mins before frying. We don't have a fryer, so we used an electric skillet to ensure the temperature was correct. This made it very easy. They are great!

I made these last  night. This is a wonderful and easy recipe. Turned out wonderful! I cut the cheese sticks in half and I froze them for about 3 hours after I breaded them. Those who have said that it is messy, this is no more messy than breading any other food item.

I loved the batter. It is definitely better than 98% of the fried cheese sticks I've ever had. The only change I would make is to freeze the battered stIcks before frying like someone else recommended because the cheese oozed out all over the place. Don't get me wrong-I love my cheese gooey and oozy but it's just harder to work with like that. Will definitely make again exactly as written... Just adding in a little freezer time.

for the people who sticks didn't come out right or melted, it's common sense to coat the sticks than freeze them for a least 30 minutes to an hour. Also the best sauce for these is pizza sauce. I usually take tomato sauce, tomato paste, garlic powder, italian seasoning, and parsley and mix them together. It's rather delicious.

This was my first time making mozza sticks and they turned out fantastic!  I followed the recipe to a tee for the most part.  I did stick a toothpick in one end of each bare stick, froze them for 30 minutes, then proceeded, using the toothpick as my "handle" to keep my fingers out of the entire operation.  30-40 seconds in the oil is all you need so be on the ball!  They tasted excellent and were of restaurant quality!

I made a few batches of these. One was as per the recipe (except I used a block of mozzarella cut into sticks). It was a bit of a mess and some cheese did melt out of the sticks (not very much), but they are still amazing definitely worth four stars (if it hadn’t been so messy maybe five). The second batch was just bread crumbs and eggs but double coated. These turned out about the same as the first, which in my opinion is awesome. Batch number three I left out the flour and cornstarch. I did however add crushed up spicy potato chips to the bread crumbs. This turned out great as well but did allow for more cheese to melt out of the sticks (still not a lot).

Yum!  Although I just used string cheese, beaten eggs and Italian breadcrumbs.  I cut the string cheese into 4 bite size pieces, dipped in egg then bread crumbs.  Then I repeated by dipping the cheese back into the egg and then bread crumbs.  I also fried them in olive oil since I didn't have anything else on hand.  They are yummy!!  Even without sauce!  I might eat them all before my kids get them for an after school snack :)

Absolutely Delicious! My roommate and I followed the advice of the other reviewers and they turned out great. Froze the cheese sticks ahead of time and then double coated them with the breading. We'll definitely make them again, although probably with three coats of breading next time instead of two.

These were really good. The only reason I am giving a 4 instead of a 5 is that I did a couple as written and found what some of the previous reviewers said to be true. They really need that second coat for the breading to stick. I thought I had Italian bread crumbs but I only had the regular. I can't wait to try these again with the Italian.

I loved these and so did my kids! Not as time consuming as you would expect.  I coated each twice and then fried all together instead of one at a time.  They were easy and restaraunt quality.  I also used the two color cheese sticks.

LOVE this recipe!! Anything that I can make at home that tastes as good if not better than what you can get at a store or restaurant is a winner in my book.

I tried it first just with egg and breadcrumbs, but I liked it better as the recipe is written. Very good - and easy. My 3-yr-old even helped me dip the cheese in each of the three bowls (like an assemblly line) and thought it was lots of fun.

I made these today as a snake i feel that they need a little more spice in the crumbs (I used store brand crumbs maybe that's the problem) also you have to be careful that the oil isn't to hot or they get way to brown. I will try these again using name brand crumbs and a few more spices. thanks for sharing the recipe.

I have to say these were very good, but i didnt follow the recipe exactly. I used more seasonings like cayenne pepper and paprika to make it a bit spicy. And I used peanut oil, which I think has more flavor than olive oil, but not as healthy, I know.  But all in all, great recipe to use. My husband absolutely LOVED them (he's kinda a picky eater so this is GOOD :) Will def make these regularly!

These were tasty, but they did not hold their form.  Perhaps I should have coated them twice, like some other reviewers suggest.  I just followed the recipe and they were melted and stuck to each other.

Regardless of the controversy among some reviewers about how to make mozzi sticks. I followed this recipe exactly and achieved a great result. These were delicious. My wife is a mozzi stick fan, and she raved about these. One hint, do pull these out quickly. 30 seconds were just right, more made them darker and not as great.

These were good. I had a hard time keeping the cheese in the breading while frying it. You definitely want to double coat the cheese and make sure the oil is cool enough to have the cheese in it for 1-2 minutes, any shorter and the cheese stick is not good.

I love this recipe.  Thank you for submitting a great quick fix for my cheese stick craving.  I dont think I will ever buy the store bought ones again. The only thing I did different was mixed all the dry ingredients together.  I then cut the cheese sticks in half diped in the egg/water mix then the dry mix twice.  My super picky kids and husband loved them.

These were very good.  Only I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and omitted the salt altogether and they still tasted great.

Excellent.  Will make again.  I made some as the directions explained and some I dipped again in the egg and then the breadcrumbs.  It didn't make too much difference in the end.  I will probably not double dip them next time.  I will use way less flour and cornstarch next time (probably 1/4 cup and 1/8 cup respectively) because I had a ton that went unused.  I also used panko breadcrumbs which I highly recommend.

This was really great, they turned out perfectly!  Based on other reviews, I put the mozzarella in the freezer for a bit before breading and frying but I won't do that in the future . . . some of them just didn't get all melty and soft in the middle.  They were still great but just a bit firm in the middle.  I will also add some extra salt to the breadcrumbs for extra flavor.  Otherwise, these were fantastic and I loved them!!!

I loved these. I think next time I might add more spices to the bread crumbs. I also doubled the coating as others have suggested. The only problem I had with them was that the cheese was not as soft as I would have liked it to be. I will definitely be using this recipe often.

I cut my cheese sticks in half to make them two short sticks instead of long ones.  double dipped too!  Next time I'll turn my oil down as they browned a bit fast and the cheese didn't get as gooey as I wanted.  I'm new to frying things on the stove in a pan so it's my fault, not the recipe's.  Will make again!

AMAZING. These turned out way better than I thought they would. First I dropped the carton of eggs then my daughter dropped the canister of bread crumbs, so I really thought these weren't going to turn out. I cut my cheese sticks in half. I let my daughter put them in the flour mixture then I dipped them in the eggs then the breadcrumbs and eggs again and breadcrumbs again. I let them rest on a plate for about 5 min. while the oil was heating all the way up. They really do only take about 30 seconds to fry. Can't wait to make these again.                ** update 12/17/2009**  made these again tonight using pepperjack cheese sticks, didn't turn out as good as the first time I made them. for some reason i didn't have the technique down like i did the first time. i guess i waited to long to make them again lol. they were still very good just not amazing like the first time.

Hubby and I really enjoyed these. The only big issue we had was that the cheese wasn't melty inside the breading. Not sure if we need to try a different brand of cheese stick, or lower the temp and fry a bit longer. The flavor the the breading was great though!

Very good recipe - I used Italian bread crumbs which I all ready had so omitted salt and seasonings, did the double dip method as recommended by others, cut fresh mozzarella into finger sized pieces,deep-fried them in sauce pan - They were crispy on the outside and melty on the inside - delicious!

Awesome "bar" snack! My fiance made these for me and I loved them!  1. We didn't use nearly the amount of flour/cornstarch so I would cut that in half. 2. We also cut our cheese sticks in half which was the perfect size for our small saucepan. 3. Plain breadcrumbs + 2 tsp Italian seasoning. 4. Followed the dipping order. 5. Did NOT use a quart of oil . . . we just fried them in our medium saucepan, a few at a time. Just be careful not to overfill the pan with oil or add too many cheese sticks at a time!

I don't have a fryer anymore, but pan fried these in olive oil instead.  I completely coated the pan, and they came out nice and brown.  I didn't need to freeze the cheese beforehand, since the pan allowed me to keep a close eye on them.  They also keep their nice rectangular shape in the pan, whether they are too cooked or not.

As suggested by another member the sticks were frozen before dipping.  Also the dipping process was performed twice.  Duplicating the dipping process fully covers the cheese.  Also, you can use a skewer to hold the chesse while dipping.  Make sure to use deep bowls and/or tilt the bowls while dipping with the skewer this will give them a full coat.

Yep, just make sure they are coated twice!! Also, we think the sticks should be cut in half previous to coating/cooking.  Better finger sized.

This was a great recipe.  I agree with Trying2cook. I had to re dip into egg and bread crumbs for a thicker layer and they didnt fall apart. My Boyfriend is in love with them.

These are great. A little messy to make but so worth it. I double coated mine and only fried for about 1 minute. I dipped these little things in Exquiste Pizza Sauce from this site.

I agree with others, it is veeery messy to make, but well worth the mess. I used regular breadcrumbs, instead of Italian because they tasted better plain.

These came out so good!  I did follow other suggestions and double dipped. No problem with leaking, maybe the others did not have the oil at the right temp.  I did not have mozzerella so I used some Pepper Jack cheese and it was Very good.

Very easy.  Very good.  Big hit.  I've made these a few times, and the only thing I do differently is to coat the cheese twice.  Mine have never leaked.

I made these just the other night for my brother who is a mozzarella fanatic, they were great!! Almost as good as getting them at a resturant. They were quick & soo easy too!!! I didn't find them too messy or hard to do at all!! And I always have everything on hand...just need to grab the cheese!!!! Great appetizer :)

I just made these, the only change I made was I wrapped them in a wonton  wrapper. Then I mixed the flour, cornstarch and bread crumbs together and dipped in egg and mixture then fried. They turned out completely awesome...couldn't cook them fast enough!!! Definetely a keeper!

Very easy if you set everything up prior to start.   I used a cooking thermometer and a cast iron frying pan.  Cut the mozzarella sticks in half and put them in the freezer.  I did not have Italian b.c's.  Just added seasonings to the regular b.c.'s I had to taste.  I did the double dip, using the one wet/one dry method and used a fork to turn and move sticks.  The prepared sticks were placed on a cookie sheet and then put 6-8 in the oil for 30-40 seconds.  Placed on cake rake with paper towel.  This is basically what most reviewers said and they turned out wonderful with rave reviews.

I love them!  I am so happy to be able to make these at home and control my portion size and the ingredients.  The third time I made them they were a little messy and oozed a bit but I'm pretty sure it was my fault because first two times they were perfect.  The third time they still tasted great, no complaints! Great recipe!!!

I just made this, but we didn't quite have all that was needed. I was out of corn starch as well as garlic salt. so I just left out the starch and put in garlic powder and salt seperately. in addition I found that adding cayenne pepper as well as crushed red pepper and habanero flakes gave the breading added spice and flavor which really made them delicious.

These really didn't turn out that great. I couldn't get the breading to stick. I might try them again at some point just to make sure last time wasn't a fluke. But, I'm not thinking it will be anytime soon.

As other reviewers have mentioned, I combined the starches into a single bowl. To prepare the sticks for frying, I double-dipped them to coat them sufficiently (egg, then starches, then egg, then starches). These turned out wonderfully and are a favorite of the family.

One thing that I noted is that these are great when eaten with marinara sauce but when eaten plain are a little bland. If you like them plain, I definitely recommend spicing up the batter a bit. Excellent recipie!

The cheese oozed out a bit.  Next time I would double dip in the breadcrumbs.  I'm in the UK and can't buy already seasoned breadcumbs, made my own with Italian spices.  Loved it.

Just do egg and water and bread crumbs and garlic salt. dip back and forth between egg and bread crumbs twice and then right into oil for 30 seconds. prepped a bit before hand and dumped a bunch in at a time. might need to wait for oil to heat back up before frying second bath.

These came out great!

I have a feeling that those with bad reviews, simply didn't follow the instructions. You have to use a deep fryer at the correct temp, and only 30 seconds! If you're using the stove, nit's harder to regulate the temp - your oil has to be HOT, and fry only 30 seconds. 

I will definitely be making this again.

Thanks!

CHECK THIS OUT..:::..I find that this recipe works better if you use slightly frozen/refrigerated cheese sticks. Also, dip the the cheese stick twice in the bread crumbs; so, after the 1st dip in the bread crumbs>>> dip the c.sticks in the egg mix>>> then dip in the bread crumbs. Also the bread mix taste better with more Italian season and garlic salt (but don't overdo it). Again, freezing the c.sticks before coating or after coating helps too! Keep a close eye on sticks is a must; I walked away from the sticks for almost a min, when i came back the cheese was seeping into the oil. However, they still were okay.

This is a great recipe.  Taste just like the restaurants.  I follow the other suggests and double deep the cheese sticks in the flour, eggs and bread seasoning mixture.  I will definitely make over and over again!

WOW!!  I had no idea that these would taste soooo much better than restaurants!!  I used 2 8 oz blocks, cut them in half and made 1/4s of each half, making a total of 16.  I doubled dipped, ran out of the egg mixture, and also had a few leakers but that doesn't even matter because the taste more than makes up for it.  Can't wait to make them again.
Oh, almost forgot..... I used plain breadcrumbs and just eye-balled the italian seasoning that I added.

Excellent!  I used the marinated mozzarella medallions from Trader Joes, and garlic and herb seasoned bread crumbs.  They made bite-sized mozzarella balls (that cook fast... careful), and my husband has never loved me more!

This is a pretty straight forward recipe. I froze my cheese sticks (which I cut in half) before double coating them with this bread crumbs. If you coat them really well, and pat on bread crumbs, the cheese sticks will not leak.

This recipe was awesome.  Now my first attempt wasn't so hot, they burned very quickly.  I think my oil was too hot!  I put the remaining batch away in the freezer because I was upset with the results but did not want to waste!  When I took the next batch out of the freezer over a week later and fried them, they were PERFECT!!!   WOW!  My honey couldn't believe they weren't store bought!  A definate winner!

Excellent recipe!  I didn't change a thing, except that I sliced 1/2" thick slices off of a block of fresh mozzarella and made more of a cheese patty so to speak.  They were awesome!

I found that if you put the mozzarella in the freezer for approx. 1 hour the cheese doesn't get cooked before the breading is golden brown and starts to ooze out

This was the first time i had ever tried to make something like this homemade. I found it alot easier to use a deep fryer. It had the temp. gadge on the side of it for me and a basket to pull them out at the same time. I was able to cook five at a time. My family really enjoyed these but i think it is cheeper to buy the frozen ones. I may try them again sometime but it is alot of work and money for something i can buy for 1.00 for 6 @ walmart :(

it was a great recipe.  i followed others' advice in halving the sticks, combining flour/starch mixture, and dipping in the egg wash & breadcrumbs twice for a thicker coating.  i did find that it was a bit too salty for my taste; perhaps it was the breadcrumb brand, progresso which already had salt in the mixture.  next time, i will omit the salt.  i don't have a thermometer, so using a non-stick pot, i set my electric range to med. high, then med. after a few minutes of cooking so the following sticks wouldn't burn due to the increased heat.  this worked just fine for me!

These are tasty and gone in a flash. I didn't have italian bread crumbs, but just added some italian seasons to them. I also used another suggestion and mixed the flour with the bread crumbs. I highly recommend getting all the sticks ready before starting the frying process.

I had to follow the advice of other reviews in which they dropped the mozzarella in the batter twice in order to cover it all.
One word to describe this: YUM.

These were so delicious.  I made them a few weeks ago.  I also double dipped the string cheese to make sure there was enought coating.  Only thing i did not like, it wasnt very stringy.  Next time i will try baking them.

I didn't use cornstarch, so I can't say I made the recipe exactly, but this was so delicious!  My boyfriend (who considers himself a mozz. stick connoiseur) absolutely loved these.  I used Sargento Light String cheese cut in half, and these worked perfectly!  However, I've made this twice with string cheese and both times it lacked that stringy, melted quality that makes mozzarella sticks fun.  Next time, I will chop mozzarella from a block for this recipe.

I double-coated in this order: flour, egg, crumbs, egg, crumbs. Make sure to dust off extra all extra flour before sticking it into the egg mixture, then letting excess egg drip off before putting it into the bread crumb mixture.  This coats those suckers more easily and its less messy overall.  I had absolutely no leaking when the sticks went in the oil.  (But keep an eye on them, because these things brown super fast!)

If you're a fan of garlic flavor, I would go ahead and double the amount of garlic salt in the recipe.  My roommate preferred it when i made that adjustment to suit her own tastes.

These are delicious.  The first time I tried using block mozzarella, but the cheese was too gooey.  The second time I used string cheese sticks and the texture was much better.  I don't have a thermometer for how hot the oil was, and needed it not quite so hot.  The insides were quite as melted as I'd liked.  Might be an investment I need to make. And whoever gave the recipe of putting a toothpick in the bottom for all the coatings (I did twice of egg and crumbs) was a smart one!

They are very good.  Next time I will use just garlic powder inplace of the garlic salt.  Too salty for my taste, but still very good.

These were awesome!!  Taste so much better than what you get at a restaurant.  I have been searching for a good cheese stick recipe and I have found.  They are a tad bit messy to make, but oh so worth the effort.

I decide to make these because of a dieting plan I'm on. It actually just said to eat the "part skim" cheese sticks, but I decided to go ahead and make them fried. They turned out GREAT!!!! My fiance' loved them! I'll definitely save this recipe!!! :)

Absolutely delicious!  Furthermore, making them is neither difficult nor time-consuming.  I made them about two hours prior to needing them, placed them in the freezer for a spell (in plastic containers), and pulled them out as needed.  I will keep some in the freezer for later use.  I only had one batch leak on me, and it wasn't a horrible mess at all.  I used another reviewer's suggestion and counted down from between thirty to forty seconds.

Very good.  The first time around, the cheese was leaking through the batter terribly, even after double-dipping.  The second time I took the water out of the recipe, and it worked splendidly.  I also just mixed all the dry ingredients together, it was much faster.  I will definitely be keeping this recipe!

I love cheese sticks and I was looking for an easy at home recipe. This was not it.
   I ate these with Way Easy Pizza Sauce/Bread Stick Dip, also on allrecipes.com. And they were very tastey, but for all the mess, I don't know that I would make these again.

These were great! I didnt have any cornstarch so i just left it out and they still turned out wonderful.  Just like the ones at restaurants and even better than most frozen ones.  I double coated them like some suggested and the coating was perfect.  Thank you for a SUPER SUPER easy and great recipe!

Wow, these are good! I cut my sticks in half so they were more bite sized. I also used a combination of mozzarella, colby jack, and pepper jack cheese sticks. Delicious!

Yup, that's a cheese stick...  Mine came out just a bit salty for my taste, but that's easily adjusted.  I made this to go with them.  Perfect.

So easy & so yummy!  Only took about 5 minutes to prep.  I used Kraft 2% string cheese and Adobo seasoning in the bread crumbs.  My very picky little boy gave me two thumbs up.

These tasted really good, but I had a bit of the cheese seeping out during the frying process. I left out the garlic salt though. I will make these again. Maybe I'll try to do a double coating of breadcrumbs next time. Very good!

These are such a good idea especially because I LOVE Cheese sticks, but I can never find them at the store, only one in a great while. So whenever I want them & can't find them, I can just make them myself.

Wonderful -- I also double-breaded and cut my sticks in half as suggested in other reviews.  Some cheese leaked through at the ends, but it didn't bother me.

My husband and I made this a few days ago. It was pretty good but was lacking something but don't know what. I will be making these again but will add something else for more flavor.

This recipe was excellent! The batter was excellent, and double dipping definitely prevents cheese "oozage". I'll be making these for the family quite often!

Good flavor.....but had a tough time cooking without the cheese oozing out! Tried to freeze for a short time like another reviewer suggested.....still didnt work. I didnt use the cornstarch and flour....maybe thats the trick. Will try again!

These are great, but I made a few changes. I added parmesan cheese to the breadcrumb mixture and double dipped in the eggs and breadcrumbs. I also popped the sticks in the freezer for a few minutes before frying. This prevents the cheese from oozing out while frying.

Wife loves Fried Mozzarella Cheese Sticks, We would try different restaurants in search of Mozzarella Stick as good as Bennigan's use to be. THE SEARCH IS OVER. Pretty easy to make.

I tried this recipe and was blown away at how easy it was and how good they turned out.  I used regular bread crumbs and added italian seasoning and garlic salt and I dipped each piece of mozzarella in the egg and bread crumbs twice!  Everyone loved them...thank you!

Very good. The only thing I did differently was to use chunk mozzarella and sliced the cheese into wider pieces. Looks like ones that come from fancy Italian restaurants. Needed to fry a bit longer.

A great start for me, as I just got my first deep fryer.. but too much for such a simple recipe -- I took DIANE73162's advice and mixed some garlic powder with some italian bread crumbs, double dipped in some eggs, and fried away.  When balls start forming in the bread crumbs from the eggs, take handfulls and roll between your hands to make it more managable.

Instead of mozzarella sticks, I used a block of Asagio cheese cut up.  It worked out wonderfully!

These were pretty good, just not worth the mess or the time it takes. I would just as soon cook pre-made ones in the oven and save 20 minutes.

This was pretty good. Kind of messy, but they turned out ok. To get the coating to stay on I dipped the cheese sticks into egg, then the breading, then the flour, back into the egg and then the breading again. It stayed on fine. Cheese did bubble out into the oil, but they stayed together.
It seems that the breading on the cheese stix in restaraunts is thicker or something.
These passed the craving test though so I'm not complaining.
Thanks Nanci.

I didn't get mine fully coated, so they started to leak - but the messy pile of fried cheese goo on my plate was my own fault - the recipe was fabulous!
