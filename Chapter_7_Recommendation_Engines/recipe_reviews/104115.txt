Used regular salt; came together very quickly. Nice presentation of color as well as taste.

I used the sundried tomatos without oil, used EVOO oil instead, used a combination of regular salt and garlic powder and cheese tortellini.  Turned out pretty good.  Thanks for the post.

Amazing dish!  Made it for husband and mother, and they said it had restaurant quality.  Flavorful without a lot of bad fat, but it has a lot of nutrients.  Used refrigerated spinach tortellini wit ricotta filling.
