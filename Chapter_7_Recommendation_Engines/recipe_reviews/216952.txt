Well, I followed the general concept of this but added more "stuff", and it was DELICIOUS!  I only used 1/4 cup Kahlua mixed with 1/4 cup of coffee to keep the alcohol to a bare minimum, and instead of cool whip I made home-made sweetened whipped cream, and I used chocolate fudge flavored pudding mix.  I also chopped up a giant Hershey Symphony milk chocolate bar with toffee and almond pieces, and added some in each layer along with some caramel and chocolate sauce drizzled around.  This will NOT be the last time I make this, oh it was wonderful!

I make this with Chocolate Cake instead of brownie mix (however next time I make it I will try the brownie mix) it is so good, I get great reviews every time I make it.   Blanche

Really loved this.  Next time I won't use quite so much Kahlua, it was a little over powering.

This has been a staple in our family for years, but we usually use a chocolate cake instead of brownies...I will be trying it w/ the brownies though. This is so good...rich and delicious! :)

Excellent and easy! I used vanilla pudding instead of chocolate to prevent full onset diabetes to my dinner guests.
