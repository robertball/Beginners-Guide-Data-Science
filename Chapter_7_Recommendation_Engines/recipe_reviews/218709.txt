wow, I wanted something different than the same old worcestershire sauce chex mix and this was definately it!  I kicked up the cayenne a tad, because we like it that way and it was fantastic.  Slightly sweet with a hint of heat mmm mm good

Would probably give this 4.5 stars if I could refine my rating to that degree.  Added 3/4 teaspoon cayenne paper & subbed peanuts for the pistachios.  Nice mild seasoned flavor with a little kick...would recommend to anyone bored with the routine Chex mix recipes & wanting to try something new!

agree that this is a nice alternative to traditional chex mix.  I, too, added approximately 1 tsp cayenne.

I made this for a Halloween party and it was great!  I used garam masala instead of cardamom.  The garam masala I used is a mixture of black pepper, cardamom, cinnamon, cumin, coriander and other indian spices.  I think this gave it a more complex flavor than straight cardamom.  Also, I used 1/2 tsp of cayenne and there was plenty of heat.

Loved this recipe! I did switch to Garam Masala (one of my favorite spice mixes from Penzey's) and I may have added a bit more cayenne-it was hard to see when I was giving a shake. I took it to a potluck, and brought home enough to take to work today, but enough was gone that I know people tried it-potlucks always have so much food! Such a nice switch from the salty Chex mix that I grew up hating.

This was a nice change from the regular chex mix. I didn't add as much cayenne but added a little more salt. It was very tasty.

Love this mix!  So different: with ingredients listed almost a hint of citrus flavor (I am not good with descriptors).  It finishes off with a slight warmth of cayenne after eating.  Not too hot.  Love this adult tasting chex mix!  My fav, although my kids love the chex mix with cherry recipe.  Still... easy and will make again!  PS-I have made a chinese 5 spice chex mix before & I really love this one better.

Just made thIs for the first time based on the reviews. Tastes great and like the light coating. Also added pretzels, walnuts and almonds instead of the pistachios.

This is delicious, however the next time I think I would leave out the Rice Chex or maybe substitute Goldfish crackers or something. I feel like the seasoning mixture was barely enough to coat everything, it could use just a bit more. I also wish I knew how they get official Chex Mix to not be so sticky. I used garam masala instead of cardamom, and 1 tsp of cayenne pepper.

Didn't have the cardamon so did a combo of cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, clove.  It was a wonderful twist on an old favorite.

This is a really unique version of the traditional Chex Mix! My family ate it up like it was candy! I will definitely be using this for future parties and maybe even wrapped up as a creative gift.
