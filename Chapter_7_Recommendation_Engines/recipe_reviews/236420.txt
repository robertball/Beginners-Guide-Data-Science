I doubled the recipe because we have a big family. I followed the recipe closely except I only added about 30 drops of red food coloring the batter was a nice mahogany color but looked more brown redish brown after baking. DEspite the vinegar /milk (old fashioned buttermilk and all the leavening the pancakes didnt rise incredibly which surprised me. They did rise just not a terrific amount. However the taste and the lightness of the pancake was perfect when eaten. They were delicios and the cream cheese frosting was just the right addition! I would highly recommend these pancakes. They taste very chocolaty and look mouthwatering delicious. We recently had Red Velvet pancakes at a restaurant in our area and these were every bit as good. If you prefer them really red then follow the directions for the food coloring.

these were so good. i didn't actually put in any red food dye so it was more of a chocolate pancake, but it was simply delightful. the glaze was delicious.

We all thought this was pretty tasty, made it this morning for a valentines day breakfast treat! The cream cheese frosting sauce is really good. I will say that mixing the batter well then letting it sit for 10-15 would be ideal, I made a mistake and didn't mix well enough and had to mix it again. Which of course made them a little flatter than they would have been originally. Overall, these had a great flavour! Thanks for a great recipe! Oh, and it makes quite a few pancakes, normally we double pancake recipes..no need for this one!

This was dinner for Valentines Day!  My hubby wasnâ€™t sure, but really liked them.  Both teenage boys loved them.  One difference we did was, powdered sugar/milk/vanilla drizzle.  Lactose intolerance in the family.

I personally didn't care too much for it. It wasn't horrible, just sort of okay. I didn't make any adjustments and followed the recipe...even sifted the dry ingredients. I did save some of the batter and froze it.
