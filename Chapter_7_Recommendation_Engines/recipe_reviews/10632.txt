Simple and delicious! Not as flat as I imagined but who cares. I took suggestions and lowered the temp to 400F and placed the rack on the 2nd from top position. 7.5 minutes was perfect, they were just about to burn at 8 minutes. Used a small cookie scoop. Rolled them into balls and dipped the whole thing in sugar. I skipped the water step. I flattened them slightly before baking. Next time I'll try rolling in cinnamon sugar. This recipe is a keeper!  P.S. Use a parchment lined sheet. I wouldn't never bake anything on an unlined sheet unless you like scrubbing.

These are very much like what my husband's grandmother used to make.  To keep the bottoms from browning too much we bake them on the third from the bottom rack instead of the middle one.

I cannot believe that more people have not tried and/or rated this recipe. I would give it ten stars if I could...it is so good!!!! I think I make them about every other week and every time I bring them somewhere I have SEVERAL people ask for the recipe. These will definitely be a favorite for anyone who tries, in my opinion. Thanks for the recipe:-)

I'm so glad I found this recipe.  It's like a sugar cookie.  But it sooo soft and good!  I had more than one person ask for the recipe.

I love these cookies, however, I made a couple of changes.  I used 2.5 tsp. of baking powder in place of the cream of tartar and baking soda.  I also decreased the oven temperature to 350 degrees and baked the cookies for 12-15 mins.  The result was a cookie that tasted a lot like a spritz cookie...YUM!!!!!

These were very tastey and fluffy!  I would read comments before making them.  I put them in at 400 degrees for 8 minutes for an electric stove.  gas ranges I would increase the temp and keep an eye on them.  they do leave a small after taste but it doesn't take away from how delicious they are when eating them, just drink something after :D

These are indeed a great sugar cookie. My family raved. I baked these at 400 for appox 8 min. I also simply pressed them lightly and placed a little sugar atop each. Will certainly make again.

I have been searching for years for a recipe for a light butter cookie my farmor used to make. This is the closest I've been able to find. Even if it's not exactly the same they are fantastic! Will be making these many more times. Thanks so much for posting.

These have a light delicate texture and a really great flavor.  A couple words of caution though -- Don't flatten them too much.  A couple fingers pushed lightly into the top to get them out of round is all you need.  The first pan I made were paper thin when they came out.  Also, I would strongly recommend using parchment paper for these.  They're very delicate and thin, so they're easy to tear as you're pulling them off the pan.  I tried a few not dipped in water and they came out as well without the mess.  Also, I think these would be amazing with cinnamon sugar.  My first batch came out torn and one ran off the edge of the pan, but now that I know how to adjust for it I know I'll make these again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent!  They taste like snickerdoodles without the cinnamon.  Very tasty.  My daughter loved decorating them with pastilles and sprinkles.

I bake a lot of cookies and this one is a winner.  Very good and easy. I baked them at 400 degrees instead of 425.

A good tasting sugar cookie...my only beef with it is that it is a little too crumbly and doesn't do well in the cookie jar.

These were great!  I used butter flavored shortening instead of butter and dipped them in colored sugar for Christmas cookies.  I baked at 350 for about 10 mins.

These are delicious!  Made exactly as recipe, but used some decorative green sugar that I dipped them in.  Only needed about 1 T.  My husband complimented me on the zucchini garnish. I have been using a lot of zucchini lately, but not in these!
