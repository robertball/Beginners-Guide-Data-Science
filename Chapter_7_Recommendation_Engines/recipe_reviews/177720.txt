Since I already had the roasted garlic on hand I thought this recipe would be an interesting thing to try in that it called for no fat or dairy.  Until now that was something I've never tried.  No butter, sour cream or cream cheese?  Didn't sound right to me but maybe Campbell's was on to something.  I tried, but it failed. Mashed potatoes (and my tastebuds) need the richness, creaminess and smooth, satisfying flavor that dairy fat of some kind provides. I'm sure this recipe would be ideal, however, for those with special dietary needs.

Very good, but I thought waiting a hour to cook the garlic was a bit much.  I think it would have been just as good with some pre-chopped garlic.  Also, I thought it needed some more flavoring... I added salt, butter and some seasoned salt and it was still bland.

Good for dairy-free needs. A little rosemary made it even better.

Roasting the garlic was fun, but we didn't really like the flavor of the potatoes.  It could be due to the fact I used homemade chicken broth instead of storebought.  All in all, I've had and made better.

Pretty good.  I kind of missed the buttery-ness of normal mashed potatoes though.

Great as a dairy free option - my 3 little girls even like it. We added a bit of margarine to make it "creamier".

Once I realized there's no milk or butter after doubling the recipe, boiling the potatoes in the chicken stock and mashing them I just added 1/2 a cup of softened butter and 1/2 a cup of butter milk and the roasted garlic (which I roasted in a tablespoon of butter instead of oil for an hour, came out amazing btw) and then once every thing was incorporated I added about 2 tablespoons of melted butter just to make it a little more creamier and just a dash of salt and pepper. All in all it came out awesome for Thanksgiving!!
