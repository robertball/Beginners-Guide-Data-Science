Great recipe, I cooked for about 20 minutes, but could be that I had more gooey egg filling in mine or a bigger muffin tin.  I crumbled the sausage instead of processing and subbed Mexican shredded cheese. I also sprinkled cayenne pepper instead instead of red peppers. Made about 18 muffins for me. Added sautéed garlic and onions instead of scallions, sautéed red and green peppers.  Loved the edges of the tomatoes that I added in combination with the sausage- no soggy middle. I am experimenting with adding cheese to the tops now. Can't go wrong with this recipe! Thanks to the cook!

Good- we used up Italian sausage and I sliced and diced it vs. the blender. Had asiago cheese so used that up. Next time I won't add the crushed red pepper- couldn't taste the scallions good. Baked in my Pampered Chef brownie pan. They puffed up and made exactly 12. Did everything else the same. Thanks for the idea!

We love these and make them at least once a week.  We use shredded parmesan instead of the fontina cheese and we add in some chopped cherry tomatoes from our garden.  Perfection!  Also if you don't have all of the individual dried herbs you can replace them with Italian seasoning. Perfect for a Keto diet with only 1 gram of carbs per muffin.

I absolutely love these and they're so flavorful!  I follow the directions exactly and then add in some grape tomatoes.  They usually take about 25-30 mins to cook but it's probably because of the juice of the tomatoes.  They also store well in an airtight container in the fridge. Then when you're ready for one just pop it in the microwave to heat up.

Thank you, Cindy, for this recipe. I make these all the time now for our breakfasts so I make a double batch. I do not have a food processor so chop the sausage up finely. I have also substituted ham or bacon. I add no salt since any of these processed meats is salty enough. I use the other herbs as stated in recipe. Perfect. For 24 I use 12 eggs and 1 pt egg whites. I never have Fontina cheese so use sharp cheddar. Sometime I will get Fontina to try it. I also add ribbons of fresh spinach to add to nutrients. I always put the meat, cheese, spinach and onions in the bottom of the greased cups before pouring the egg and herb mixture in. I give each cup a little stir before its 15 min bake. They are a nice breakfast with no carbs!

This is an easy to make recipe. My husband is my taste tester and gave it 5 stars. He says that the more you eat these the more delicious they become. Oh and I forgot to add the scallions and used 4 blend grated Mexican cheese instead of the optional kind in the recipe.

Really good! I subbed cheddar cheese and omitted the red pepper flakes. Whole family liked these. Next time I'll add some diced bell pepper and maybe some mushrooms

I didn’t have all the ingrients on hand,however, the end result was very good. Our brunch guests asked for the recipe. I make variations of this recipe often as its a convenient and healthy snack or ideal for a quickie breakfast.

Very good! I used turkey bacon instead of sausage and I also added some tabasco for a little kick. Then I sprinkled some shredded cheese instead of the Fontina. Overall very good recipe!

Delicious! To the original recipe, I added 6 thin-sliced deli slices of chopped sweet ham, 3/4 C. grated Sharp Cheddar, only 1/2 tsp. salt, and 1/2 cup thawed chopped spinach. Baked for 18 minutes at 350. They puffed up beautifully and were just perfect. I think 1 tsp. salt would’ve been overkill.
