This turned out wonderful! I added a few cloves of garlic with the leeks. I didn't have crème fraîche therefore substituted with 5% sour cream, make sure the soup doesn't boil after its added otherwise it could curdle. Thanks for the great recipe! !

This soup is absolutely delicious! We kept the potato skins on and substituted half and half for the heavy cream...and it was still velvety smooth and so luxurious. Company-worth, but also lovely for any day of the week.

If I could give this 6 stars, I totally would. It surpassed my expectations in every way. It's winter here, so I ate it hot. I knew it would be rich, and I was serving it as a starter, so I kept the portions small, but I would have gladly gone back for seconds if there were any. I'll be making this again, and I won't be sharing!

Freaking awesome! My whole family loved it. I cut the leeks longitudinally to wash them out--I'm impatient like that.

Wonderful! Couldn't find creme fraiche, so substituted more half and half and some sour cream. Must add the cayenne. Chives on top added some additional zip. Great way to use leeks.

You can use 2% or whole milk instead of heavy cream for a lighter version.  Super tasty!  Great recipe and quite a humorous video.

Time consuming but worth the effort.  Substituting the heavy cream and creme fraiche will reduce the caloric value by almost half  while retaining the velvety texture and decadent flavor.   I blended in my Vitamix and it took just seconds.

Delicious! The boys up a Winterfeld would be quite satisfied with this rich, tasty soup. I have some decent 1/2 stale rye bread I paired with this and it was perfect. Kudos!

I made it and it was great. Since my chicken stock was going to be a source of salt, I reduced the initial salt addition to 1 1/2 teaspoons Instead of the 2 teaspoons suggested. Wished I had cut it back even further to Perhaps 1 teaspoon. Also, although I had heavy cream I decided to go with half-and-half instead and I feel it was plenty rich without the extra fat. Did not have to creme  fraiche so I had to go with sour cream. Lastly I did not have fresh chives so I used dried. It’s definitely a keeper.

Have Mercy!!!  This soup is the most amazingly tasteful soup.  I made it hot and doubled the recipe.  Now my go-to soup for cold nights and dinner guests.  I plan to make this and freeze it.  It really is quite easy.  This was the first time I have ever tried leeks and I'm hooked.

Followed the recipe exactly. Came out great. 
I used an Immersion blender . Blend until it’s smooth then blend another minute or two. Comes out really creamy.

, a rich version of the original that works well in mugs. The first time I set this out on the patio, I overheard the kids deciding not to tell me that I'd served it cold.

Really good! I think it’s too salty, so I cut kosher salt to 1/2 tsp, especially since there’s already salt in the broth.  Did not need to simmer leeks longer than 15 mins.  Also, 1/2 cup heavy cream + 1/2 cup sour cream (or creme fraiche) is adequate.  I added fresh lemon juice, homemade bacon crumbles, sliced green onions, and more cayenne pepper when serving.

I don't know why this recipe calls for heavy cream AND creme fraiche? I think that just ONE would be sufficient so pick just one to add in. It was good. This soup is very simple but very tasty and I like the fact that you can eat it hot or cold.

I watched the video & followed the instructions carefully. How easy this was to make & absolutely delicious! I creamed the soup in two batches in my blender & used half & half & sour cream instead as that's what I had on hand. This is going to be our new favorite!

Absolutely wonderful!  I ended up buying more leaks however to avoid using anything but the white flesh, didn't want the end result to be green, but wanted it as white as possible.

I added a dash of white pepper, nutmeg and dried tarragon. 
I was surprised I needed all the whipping cream. As the soup chills it does get thicker.
Heading off to my French Picnic now...

Very savory and just a "feel good" soup. I could eat this hot or cold any day. Will certainly keep this recipe and make it again and again!

Actually I have made this several times and have tried making it with bacon and bacon grease instead of butter and it was okay (husband liked it best) but did not want to try that again. Then I have made it using more of the green parts as long as they are fresh and crisp. I like using more of the green parts. This time I used a few of the extra mini potato's (cut into half, micro 4 min in a little water & 1 tsp Better Than Broth granules), added at the end, to the original recipe, as my husband likes something to bite into. This worked out well and is delicious no matter what little changes you make. I love making soups of all kinds and always experimenting. Thanks for reading this review.

first time cooking with leeks  and I will be more because this is probably one of the best soups I've had if not the best. Very good flavor and filling.

This was my first Chef John Recipe.  IT TURNED OUT AMAZING!  The soup is so flavorful for such minimal ingredients.  I can't wait to make this again for my friends.

This soup is awesome. I took it to our lodge for a potluck and got rave review. Have made it several times since and hubby keeps requesting it. I made no changes to the recipe.

So good!!! I didnt have creme fraiche so used sour cream and dropped the measurement a bit, like others did. I also added a little more cayenne as like it with some kick.  I used salted butter so I only added a little salt to taste at the very end. This soup is delicious, very rich, and perfect for a cold winter day. I'm the only one in my house that eats soup so I'm going to freeze the leftovers.  Hope the reheated portions are as good as the original

This is perfect as is. My son is lactose intolerant and his girlfriend is vegetarian and it was just as good using vegetable stock and coconut milk as substitutes.

This is a simple recipe that is very easy to make and the outcome is wonderful. I made it to almost exact specifications except I did not have any crème fraîche.

Simple, flavorful, and delicious. Enjoy with a fresh crusty roll and on a snowy night this is all you need. Another Chef John winner. Thanks.

Added three cloves of garlic (very lightly sautéed and added as the potatoes were boiling) and a little ground pepper, and honestly, this was The Best Soup Ever!

This is a very rich, hardy, delicious soup. Very simple and straightforward recipe. Highly recommend making it even if your not sure about leeks. I, as another reviewer had, used sour cream instead of creme fraise, used less of it. Delightful recipe! Thanks

Chef John is my hero. Every recipe is so good. I loved this. I just used a potato masher to smash the potatoes instead of pureeing it. I used sour cream because that’s what I could get. This was so delicious. I will make this soup again and again!

Fantastic, delicious, made the lower fat version with substitutions suggested in an earlier review.
