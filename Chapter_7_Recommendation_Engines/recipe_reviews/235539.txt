Looking for a sweet treat, I decided to try this mug cake to change things up from the other recipe I normally use. This was very good and quick! The only changes I made were to use coconut oil instead of olive oil (I find the olive oil flavor too strong for cakes) and I used vanilla extract instead of coffee extract.  This rose beautifully and I enjoyed the light texture.  Also, unlike the other mug cake I make, this one pulled away from the sides nicely and could have easily been turned onto a plate. No sticking!  And no time for a pic either! Thanks for sharing your recipe DenaMarie!

I made this the first time substituting coconut oil for olive oil.  I used extra dark chips so it wasn't sweet at all, but gave a wonderful cake mouth feel  that I was craving on my LCHF diet.    Made this a second time, this time subbing applesauce for the oil, adding 1tsp vanilla extract and 1tsp agave syrup to sweeten.  Cake rose higher, and was fluffier in texture.  Just as satisfying as first attempt, and less calories too.  Both cakes pulled away from the sides and easily turned out of mug.

I used coconut oil instead of olive and 1/4 t. vanilla instead of the coffee flavoring since it was what I had in the house. It's pretty darn good. I'd recommend not melting the chocolate chips completely so you still get those little hits of chocolate in the cake. The 1 1/2 min. cooking time was spot on. You'll likely want whipped cream on it if you have it, but it's very nice on its own, and the texture was surprisingly light. Will definitely make again.

I used coconut oil and vanilla extract because that's what I had on hand. It was just ok, tasted a lot better once I topped it with whipped cream. I don't think I will make it again.

What a fabulous idea! My daughter has dietary limitations so she is always on the hunt for flourless, dairy-less desserts. This was so delicious I can't wait to share it with her. I made two minor tweaks: I used coconut oil instead of olive oil; and I poured a few chocolate chips on top before baking (I only had a few left in the bag and didn't want to waste them). I think next time I may try it with a little dollop of coconut cream. Mmmmmm! Thanks so much for the recipe.

What a sinful treat! I added vanilla, instead of coffee extract, and unsweetened dark chocolate. Granulated palm sugar to sweeten and WOW a totally guilt-free lil cake. I put some coconut milk ice cream on the top and let it melt into the cake...

I will definately make this again.  I was amazed at how moist this turned out.  It was just the right size and it hit the sweet spot!  Did not change anything, followed the recipe as is.  Didn't know the microwave could do this!

I used espresso instead of water as I did not have coffee "extract" and I used Mexican chocolate that we use to put in our coffee.... liquid egg substitute.  We made it again cause it was so tasty!    Can taste coconut and chocolate. Second time I used the extra strong espresso and I felt it was richer in flavor..... very nice thank you.!

My girlfriend and I started paleo recently, and the number 1 issue we had right off the bat was the lack of sweets. So we decided to come here and try out some recipes. The mug cake is labeled as "the best paleo mug cake" and you know what, that's a load of  cake. My girlfriend is sad now. I don't like it when she's sad. She's like a cute little sloth. She can't move all that well, but she doesn't get how cute that is. Imagine if your girlfriend was that adorable, and you know what made her upset. That's why I'm here. Don't lie to my girlfriend like that again. One star to you, paleo mug cake.

I added a teaspoon of honey to make it a little more moist, but it tastes really good either way.  It's great to get that chocolate fix in a healthy way.  Thanks!

Great recipe, even better with Almond flour instead of coconut flour. I omitted the water when using almond flour.

This is my go to quick sweet treat in the evening.  I can make it in around five minutes.  No  sugar!  Awesome!  The coconut flour and the chocolate chips add plenty of sweetness to the cake.  I've used egg substitute rather than a real egg and it has also turned out well.  Add whipped cream, ice cream, or throw caution to the wind.  I'm thinking of adding chopped maraschino cherries or a variety of white, butterscotch and or chocolate chips to add a bit of chunkiness to the cake.  My family really likes this recipe.  I  served this to company because they were diabetic..

Turned out amazing!  Texture was pleasant and had a nice flavor. Ghirardelli chips helped, but I will probably put this recipe on regular rotation.

It's has a great consistency, but the taste leaves a lot to be desired. It's bland and just not very sweet at all. You would definitely need to top it with something if you want it to satisfy a sweet craving.

I have made this many times now, following the recipe exactly except using Brown Rice Flour rather than Coconut Flour. One thing I suggest is to mix the egg with the water and beat well before adding it to the mix. Also, sometimes I want it to be a little sweeter so I have added 1 Tablespoon of honey. I like to top it with vanilla yogurt and a sprinkle of cocoa powder. It's wonderful and gluten free!

Made it exactly as the recipe said. Turned out great. During commercials I got up, went to the kitchen and came back with warm cake and cold milk. My husband was pleasantly surprised.

This was moist, light in texture and rose like a dream. It pulled away from the wall of the mug and turned onto a plate with ease. I switched up dark chocolate chips for the less healthy semi-sweet chips and avocado oil for the olive oil. Very tasty and only 20 carbs, perfect for the Diabetic in the house, and simple enough for him to make himself.

Wow! I am amazed at how real this cake is! I feel like I’m eating real chocolate cake. If I were to add my favorite frosting (which I didn’t for a quick Tuesday morning breakfast) it would be outrageously good. I’m eating this (with a pinch of salt added) and my coffee and completely happy

Wow pretty good. Tried making my own once, disaster. Glad I found this recipe, the texture was pretty good. Used coconut oil too since I had it,  and  vanilla extract, cocoa powder as I didn't have choc chips. Also used Almond milk instead of water. Next time I'd like to make some coffee ahead of time. Great recipe!

Perfect and easy! Texture is nice and airy instead of dense. Highly recommended.

Way better than I expected. I used a combo of coconut oil & butter, 1/4 tsp instant coffee and baker's chocolate because that's what I had. I also whipped some fresh cream from heavy whipping cream, added an ounce of warmed cream cheese and a tsp of maple syrup and put on top. It reminded me of a warm, fresh ho-ho. So of course I had to make another one :-)

Used part coconut oil & butter, coconut flour instead of almond flour, 1/2tsp of vanilla, 1T coconut flakes, 1T pecan pieces (for crunch), using the exact cooking directions (no whipped cream on hand) it seemed a little dry. Loved the flavor!!!! Next time will have a creamy topping for this delightful cake!! Thank YOU!

this was not good. i didn't have coconut flour so i used all purpose flour and i used coconut extract and instant coffee mix it was very giggly and and looked very unappealing! i put my fork in it and it came up in one gross piece.

This recipe came out amazing! I used coconut oil instead of olive oil,  and left out the coffee extract,  but added 1/2 tsp peppermint extract and a dash of salt. Fantastic! ^_^ I hope to sub out the egg and bake in the oven for my little girl soon.

This was very good and the taste and texture was better than most Paleo recipes.  I also used coconut oil and strong coffee instead of water.  Make sure you use a large mug.

I have a severe gluten allergy and this little cake just made my year! I absolutely loved it! However, I did substitute olive oil for a coconut butter/honey blend. I will be making this little gem over and over.

Did  use 1/8 tsp  instant coffee and 2TBS ground flax seeds instead of flour.  Also  subed coconut oil for olive oil, so I can't say I made exact recipe.  It was tasty and no guilt tho,  even after the Ready Whip topping with a cherry on top.

Seriously - chocolate CAKE on paleo? Yum. Took other reviewer's advice to use coconut oil and vanilla. And it didn't stick to sides. Sprinkled a few chips on top for an icing effect.

Awesome recipe for a quick chocolate fix! Followed other users' suggestions and switched out olive oil for coconut oil and coconut flour for almond flour. Tossed left over chocolate chips on top to melt as the cake cooled for a nice "frosting". Delicious!!!

I didn't read the recipe thoroughly, so instead of melting the chocolate chips, I added them at the end.  I also added 1 TBSP of coconut sugar and swapped olive oil for cold pressed  coconut oil.   It reminded me of a healthier chocolate chip cookie cake.  It's pretty good for a healthy version. It fixed my sweet tooth.

This was a quick and amazing little dessert. Now to top it off with a little cream cheese frosting next time I bake it. Yumm!
