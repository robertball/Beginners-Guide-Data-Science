This is SO good, especially with homemade dulce de leche . Do not just use ice cream topping type caramel sauce; it's not creamy enough. I used the recipe from this site: Caramel In A Can (Dolce de Leche). It was fabulous--just creamy and sweet enough for me. I cut this down to 4 cups of coffee and used 4 tablespoons of dulce de leche.

Nice, caramel flavored coffee. I added a touch of cream, and it was very good. I can see using this when I'm out of my favorite flavored creamer and am in need of a coffee fix.
