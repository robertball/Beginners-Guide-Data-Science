Quick, easy, and tasty. I needed a last minute pot luck dish, and these are items we all usually have on hand. The only thing I added was some sliced olives.

Suggestion:  Needs a little color, so add red/green/yellow peppers OR broccoli florets OR peas.  I doubled the dressing. I'm keeping this recipe around because it looks like a more sophisticated salad (because of the artichoke hearts and chick peas), but it's actually quick-from-the-pantry and easy as can be!

Excellent! It's really beyond me why this recipe has only 3.5 stars because it is really wonderful. The lemon zest and basil give it a wonderful fresh, vibrant flavor and I don't recommend omitting either one. I used farfalle instead of penne and added black olives. I'll definitely make this again; my husband and I really enjoyed it. Give it a try! Thanks :)

If you buy marinated artichoke hearts you dont need to worry about the lemon zest or basil. I used cherry tomatoes cut in half. I love chick peas so I was excited to try this pasta. I thought it was very good.

It was okay, but missing something. I added sliced black olives and some red wine vinegar to the dressing.  Was better the 2nd day.

I really enjoyed this salad. Brought it to Easter dinner, and everyone seemed to like it, but there was another pasta salad that was enjoyed more, so I had lots left over. I used wagon wheel pasta for fun, and having read a lot of the comments here before I made it, I did add red pepper and black olives. I like the fresh flavour of the salad, and as I am eating leftovers for lunch today I am considering  adjusting the ratio of pasta to other ingredients, so that I have more of a "salad with pasta" instead of a "pasta salad" for lunches for work. Otherwise, I really like it.

This was a really good way to get my family to eat something vegetarian and a bit healthier.  We used garden pasta and added more veggies (roasted red peppers, steamed spinach, sauteed mushrooms).  We also used a tuscan season blend with olive oil in place of the dressing.  We added some feta the second day, which worked well too.
