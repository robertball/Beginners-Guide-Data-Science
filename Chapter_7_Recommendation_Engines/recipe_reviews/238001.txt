I was in such a hurry, I didn't see the 'root'.  Then when I DID see it,  I had already poured about 1/2 the bottle, so I stirred the pot, threw in the pork and  drank the rest of the the bottle.
The pulled pork was fine.

I don't know why there aren't anymore reviews for this recipe. It's been my go-to recipe for years. I use pork loin - usually 2 - and then add bbq sauce later to taste. I think a chopped onion added would also be nice. I serve on Hawaiian roll/sliders, with pickles and coleslaw. Always a fav for football gatherings.

I made this recipe last night for my mother and we both loved it. So simple to make. The few changes I made were I threw in a large chopped onion and three diced garlic cloves. Then added the barbeque after the pork and onions/garlic was pressure cooked and shredded. Served with home made Cole slaw. Delicious!

This was very good!  I used an electric pressure cooker on high pressure for 55 minutes.  It might have been done in less, but I wanted to make sure it was done before releasing pressure.  I mixed in a teeny bit of sauce after shredding & I served it on yeast rolls with a little mayo and bbq sauce on the side.  Not everyone in my family likes BBQ sauce, so we liked that everyone could regulate their own amount of sauce.

This was my first experiment with a pressure cooker, and it turned out great! Cooked our 5.5 lbs of pork shoulder with Dr Pepper on high pressure for 50 minutes. For sauce, I added a bottle of Stubb's Sweet Heat after releasing pressure and draining. After stirring that in, hardly any pulling was needed... so tender! Also, cutting up five and half pounds of pork shoulder takes longer than I expected, but it was worth it. Thanks!

I'm biased because I don't really care for pulled pork. However, I made it for my son's wedding reception and it was a hit! I did season the pork as well.

I threw 7lbs of pork shoulder, 3 minced garlic, a chopped onion, and 18 fluid ounces  Dr. Pepper into the pressure cooker for a Father's Day potluck.  Easy peasy.  Self-served on slider rolls with Stubbs bbq sauce to taste.  It was well-received by all, even my little picky eater.

Came out great! I cooked the pork for 45 minutes, and it shredded very easily. I doubled the amount of BBQ sauce to 2 bottles. My family loved it!

Doesn't get much easier than this. Quick and easy for those lazy days. I served on toasted sourdough bread.
