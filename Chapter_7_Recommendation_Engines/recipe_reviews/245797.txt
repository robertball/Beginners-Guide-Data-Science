This was exactly what I was looking for.  I had chicken, tortellini and homemade pesto.  It came out great but I did make a few changes.  I used a box of frozen broccoli because I didn't have spinach or kale.  Instead of tomato, I used sliced red pepper.  It was yummy and I would definitely make it again.  It works well with whatever you have on hand besides the chicken, tortellini and pesto...

So yummy! I used 1/2 the pesto and added a splash of wine as suggested and it was delicious. My whole family loved it!

I loved this.  The chicken alone is great and when added to the veggies and pesto is even better.  My tortellini came out a bit soft and lacked flavor so next time I will cook it less and mix it in with the chicken/pesto mix  in the bowl rather than place the chicken/pesto on top of the tortellini.  Also, there are plenty of homemade pesto recipes in here and so simple - so try these rather than the pesto in a jar.  This was great and easy!

I made this tonight and substituted sliced Italian sausage for the chicken. I also added a little dash of red wine with the lemon juice. The whole family loved it!

I will definitely make this again! I didn't have kale so omitted it, and also only had half of a jar of pesto. This came out beautifully seasoned and very flavorful! Super quick to make, but tastes like you spent a lot of time.

I forgot to buy a tomato, but other than that I made this recipe as directed.  I think I actually would prefer this dish without the pesto, or at least with half the amount.   It's not that I don't like pesto, but its flavor can be rather overpowering.  I will try this next time without it, as I think this is a pretty good dish.   With salad and bread this makes 6 servings.
