I am so happy with this recipe, I don't know where to start! These rolls are absolutely perfect in every way. I followed the recipe and the "Cook's Note" and will never change a thing. We have been on a cinnamon roll kick lately and I have been searching for the perfect dough. THIS is it! So tender, they almost melt in your mouth. The orange flavor in the dough, filling and frosting is spot on. The cream cheese frosting...addictive. This recipe is also very easy and quick. They doubled in 1 hour on the first rise. I was serving these as dessert, so no overnight refrigeration. The dough is so easy to work with, that the rolling and filling took approx. 5 minutes to complete and they were in the pan for the second rise. They doubled in 25 minutes and into the oven they went. Exactly 25 minutes later they were perfectly baked and the wonderful orange aroma was filling the kitchen. We couldn't wait. My aunt and I stole a corner roll and ate it straight from the oven. I knew right there that there is no reason to search any further for the perfect recipe. rae, Thank You for sharing your outstanding High Five Orange Roll recipe. We will enjoy it often.

MAKE THIS ONE!!!  Oh my gosh.  I have tried a LOT of recipes ... I'm a food blogger and a stay-at-home mom with just 1 kid so far.  And after our first bites, my husband and I both declared that it might be THE best recipe I have EVER made.  I mean I this will definitely be THE Christmas morning recipe for my family, and I think I may even refuse to make it any month other than December just to keep a special Christmastime feeling in the taste.  It is PERFECTION!

I followed the directions exactly other than using 4 cups of bread flour and 2-3 cups of regular flour.  Bread flour actually makes for a tougher, heartier dough and I like a little of the softer, stretchier aspects of regular flour in breakfast pastries.  Yes, it took me about 6+ cups of flour, not 5.  I added maybe another cup in the mixer and probably another cup kneading.  I only kneaded 7 minutes because I kept having to add more flour.  I was worried they'd be too dry... but they were perfect! 

I was also worried because the dough didn't taste amazing on its own, but it's ALL about the filling and frosting.  The filling ends up caramelized at the bottom of the pan... SO GOOD.  I also followed another reviewer who used one 9x12 glass baking/casserole pan and another smaller square one, greased bottom and sides, saving the smaller pan for another day.

Basically these rolls are soft, moist, stretchy, sweet-but-citrusy perfection with a hint of savory (salt) in the cream cheese.  You CANNOT go wrong.

A MUST! Wonderful! I saw this recipe and had to try it. It makes plenty so I knew I would have enough to give to a friend and enough for my family. I made the dough but erred several times. I didn't realize it only called for 1/4 cup of the pudding mix until AFTER I had already added the whole package. Also, while writing this review and re-reading the recipe...I discovered that I inadvertantly left out the salt. It made no difference. These stilled turned out wonderful. I divided the dough in two uneven portions just to make it easier for me to work with. The smaller portion I made into 9 rolls which I placed in a 9x9 inch pan. The larger portion I cut into 12 rolls and placed in a 9x13 inch pan. (I used a long piece of dental floss slid under the roll, criss-crossed on top and pulled to "cut" each roll. Works very nicely and keeps the rolls nice and round.) I placed the larger pan in the fridge to save and bake the next day. The smaller pan I let rise to bake the same day. We keep the house cool so I let them rise in a slightly warm oven (that had been turned on for just a minute then turned off) with a bowl of hot water on the rack underneath. After I baked and frosted them, hubby delivered them to my friend who raved. I couldn't wait to bake the second pan the next day for us. Well worth the wait! Makes more than enough frosting so I froze some for the next time. Do not leave out the zest as that adds a deeper orange flavor. I will also add zest to the frosting next time.

I made these rolls before they were famous!!! This is my original review ~ These really are wonderful breakfast rolls, perfect light taste for summer Breakfastâ€™s.  I halved the recipe and made these in my bread machine, placing all the wet ingredients in first, followed with the dry.  Once the dough cycle had finished I rolled out the dough, I did change the filling slightly to the one in the recipe.   I melted the butter and added the orange extract to it (did not use the zest as I am not a fan) brushed this mixture on to the rolled dough, I then sprinkled with Brown sugar and cinnamon, topped with a handful of raisins.  Rolled the dough and cut using a sharp bread knife (the halved recipe made 12 standard size rolls).  I placed in the greased dish and covered with film, I let these rise for a further 30 minutes in my cold oven with the light on, removed and stored in the fridge covered overnight.  The following morning I removed the rolls from the fridge and let sit on the counter for about 45 minutes to bring them to room temperature before baking.  Once baking I started to make the glaze, I used 2 tablespoons of freshly squeezed orange juice in place of the milk and orange extract.  Thank you for sharing this recipe, I know I will be baking them again and again!

A terrific recipe!  Absolutely perfect in every way. They were so delicious, I baked these rolls 3 times in less than a week. Once, I substituted white sugar with a generous sprinkling of brown sugar, ground cinammon, about 1/8 cup of orange juice and raisins in addition to what the recipe called for before rolling the dough.  My husband begged me to put it away because he couldn't stop eating the rolls after they were baked.  The rolls were soooo soft and the flavor was awesome!  Thank you very much for sharing such a wonderful recipe.

WOW, that pretty much sums up these rolls. If heaven smells like anything it is these rolls, my apartment smelled so good while baking them and I absolutely could not wait for them to be done. If you are looking at this recipe and are a first time bread baker do no be put off by kneading the dough. The dough was VERY easy to work with and the 8-10 minute guideline was perfect. My rolls were not dense or mushy at all. I also followed another reviewer and added 5 minutes to the bake time since I was using a glass dish and the rolls came out perfect! I will upload a picture next time I make these because there are none left this morning =) This should be called double high five orange rolls because I will never use another sweat roll recipe again! One more thing, these rolls raised a lot when I baked them so make sure you don't cut them too thick or you might be in trouble! Next time I will just divide the rolls into two pans

I spent A LOT of $ to try this recipe. Bought orange extract, pudding mix, bread flour, used 3 sticks of butter... Groceries aren't cheap these days! I had read all of the positive reviews and figured they would be great. In my opinion they weren't. They had no flavor. I understand I'm in the minority here but I followed the recipe and instructions exactly and they didn't turn out for me. But Rae - I do LOVE your profile pic :-), the rolls just weren't for me.

I've never made sweet rolls before and I decided to take the plunge with these! I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfect! I think I baked them for 30 minutes instead of 25 since I used a glass dish. Super yummy, this is a must try recipe!

My first orange rolls I've ever made.  These are absolutely wonderful and my husband even likes them.   If you have extra orange zest, use them for more  flavor.  I used about 3 T for the filling and added about 1 T to the frosting.  I also used my bread machine, following the instructions to add the yeast and sugar to the warm milk/water mixture first and let stand about 5 minutes before adding to pan.  I used a 9x13 pan and baked for 25 minutes.  They filled the pan and turned out a little doughy in the center so next time I might reduce the yeast to 2 1/2 tsp - or use a bigger pan and make 18 instead of 12 rolls.   I didn't use milk in the frosting because I forgot, but it didn't affect the quality.    I'm anxious to share these with friends.   Hope you enjoy them as much as we do!

These were awesome. More than awesome. I didn't have any orange extract, so I used two oranges, zested them and juiced them into a saucepan, and let it reduce over super low heat. I then used it in place of the extract. I don't think the orange flavor was as intense as it would have been with the extract, but it was amazing, none the less. I wasn't sure how to bake them, since it looked like everyone baked them in a 9 by 13, but the instructions said to bake them on a baking sheet. I ended up using a jelly roll pan and baking them as directed, and they came out perfect. I used a different cream cheese frosting...1 pkg cream cheese, 3/4 cup powdered sugar, 1/2 cup whipping cream, and 1/2 tsp vanilla. Whip the cream cheese, powdered sugar, and vanilla in one bowl, and the whipping cream in another. Fold together. Awesome. I should have used some orange in there as suggested, because it would have really amped up the flavor, but oh well. Next time!

Well, my review is rather mixed. I took these to a baby shower brunch and everyone raved over them so that would be 5 stars. But, though my husband and myself would give the rolls themselves 5 stars, the frosting we both thought was only 2-3 stars. I usually love cream cheese frosting, but I think it was too much competition (flavor-wise) with the orange extract. I will make these again, but will make up a different frosting, maybe more like the frosting on the orange rolls they make at the resort in my hometown.

This was good but I felt like there was too much orange extract and too much butter.  The recipe was very tasty when they came out of the oven but the left over rolls dried out very quickly.  I loved the fact that I could make these ahead, I just wish they used less of the unhealthy ingredients.  While this is very good for a rare treat, I will try other variations so that I can enjoy it more than once a year.   Also, i'm not really sure what the vanilla pudding adds to the bread?

I love these rolls.....they are light, flavorful and a hit with family and friends. I have one good friend who doesn't compliment easily and she said these are definitely a thumbs up!  I knew then they had to be special. Thanks for the recipe. Only con I have is trying to find room in my fridge for the baking trays so I will try the alternate method of letting rise longer.

The dough is fabulous soft fluffy easy to work with, everything you could want in a roll.  The icing was very sweet.  I would not make this again, it was a fair amount of work and nobody is eating them,  but I will use the dough recipe in cinnamon rolls.

I loved these....but you have to have a liking for orange! My husband wasn't too keen on them, but when you make something like a cinnamon roll, they expect it to taste like a cinnamon roll, and these do not (I think they are better!) I omitted the pudding, but added King Arthurs dough enhancer. I mixed them in my bread machine and refrigerated the dough for two days, then made the rolls, they were AWESOME!

So great. I did use about 6.5 cups of flour total.  I also didn't have bread flour, so I used regular flour and about 8 tsps of vital wheat gluten.  I also used about 4 cups of confectioner's sugar in the frosting.  It tasted too much like butter and not sweet enough.  I didn't have enough orange zest and I could definitely tell it was missing.  They were good, but I think with the stated amount of zest, they would be perfect.  I had to bake mine for more like 33 min.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Rolls were wonderful, but too large.  Will make smaller and make just confection sugar frosting with orange extract and milk.

Possibly because I live at 5500 feet above sea level but my dough didn't rise AT ALL.  I used plenty of flour, and kneaded the dough with my bread hook as well as by hand.  Maybe keep this in mind if you live at high altitude. disappointed!

This recipe is High Five Star Awesome! The only difference I did not do the overnight method, I just allowed them to raise and bake the same day. So delicious,and they rose beautifully, the dough was pliable and easy to work with too! Everyone wanted this recipe after eating them, true testament for an exceptional recipe! We loved these rolls!Thank You for sharing!

These are amazing! They are so soft and just melt in your mouth. They rose beautifully in the refrigerator overnight and I haven't been able to find any other breakfast (or cinnamon) roll recipe that rises so well that way.

I have had this one in my recipe box FOREVER!!!  I finally made it and boy  have I been missing out!  That frosting is amazing and the rolls are super soft, I'm guessing from the pudding.  Yummy Rae, thanks!

OMG!  Made these for my husband and now I'm in love with orange rolls.  I was going to refrigerate overnight, but was so anxious to try that I went ahead and baked them the same day.  They are everything a sweet roll should be:  Soft, flavorful, gooey, and they do not skimp on the frosting.   I didnâ€™t even use all of the frosting and that never happens.   The only thing that tripped me up was the pan size and number of rolls.  The numbers didnâ€™t quite add up, but I managed to cut 18 rolls and awkwardly placed them into an 11 x 15 pan.  I canâ€™t imagine using a smaller pan because they took up every square inch once they rose.   Next time,  I will cut into 20 rolls for easier pan placement.

Oh my. These rolls are absolutely heavenly! What a treat on a cold winter morning! I also subsituted fresh orange juice (from the zested orange) in the frosting for the extract.

I did try these orange rolls. Despite not following directions they turned out GREAT. i PUT THE DOUGH IN THE FRIG OVERNIGHT BEFORE ROLLING THEM OUT. Forgot the orange juice in the dough so put itin the frosting. Also made some of the dough into cinnamon rolls  with caramel frosting. UMMM

I used this as a base recipe for cinnamon buns I substituted the orange juice with eggnog and the orange extract with vanilla I filled it with pecans cinnamon butter and brown sugar and made a cream cheese icing and I only had all purpose flour. I bake a lot to release stress but I don't eat the sweets. My family was saying they were the best cinnamon buns they ever ate so I had to taste them! OMG they were amazing! And very easy to make seeing as it was my first time making cinnamon buns. I'm going to make the orange ones next weekend thank you for this recipe.

This is the best breakfast rolls ever! They work great at high altitudes (have made them in Quito at 10,000 feet), but you must make sure you don't use water too hot on your yeast and you must make sure your yeast isn't expired (2 common problems for unexperienced cooks).  The icing is absolutely the best! This is a great treat for the whole family and I wouldn't change a thing.

this recipe is remarkably similar to Mennonite Paska bread that I make every year for easter!  We also ice our bread.  Many use both lemon and orange flavouring/ zest.

These were amazing.  I bake at least 3 times a week and my children said these were as good as my cinnamon rolls. The dough is light and fluffy.  I wouldn't change anything!

Wowza!  These are amazing.  I love the Rhodes frozen orange rolls, and these are WAY better. I followed the recipe as written, except I baked them the same day. The dough is very easy to work with and they come together quickly (except the waiting for the rising of dough but I was just eager to try them!).  Thank you for sharing this super recipe! I will definately be making these again.

These were very very good. However if you are looking to imitate the orange rolls you can buy at the store I am not sure these would do it. I added cinnamon and if the recipe had called for it they would have been five stars for sure.

Just made these for Christmas morning.  I gave this recipe 5 stars because the directions were perefect and they came out exactly as they were supposed to.  For my family, there was to much orange flavor.  Maybe if I didnt add the orange extract to the icing it would have been ok.  Also the amount of butter was also to much.  When they came out of the oven, the rolls were swimming in butter and as they cooled the butter was absorbed back into the rolls.  Then there was another stick of butter in the icing.  Again, maybe if I didnt add the butter to the icing, it would have been better.  It was to rich and sweet for us, plus I am not a baker and it was a lot of work to make these.  If you are a fan of orange, then these are for you.

I found this recipe to be confusing. First, the ingredients say 2 tbsp milk, but then in the directions it says warm milk. I don't know why the ingredients say to warm the water, but not the milk, but no big deal. I warmed the milk. The first ingredient is 3/4 cup sugar, but the directions first only call for 1 tbsp of sugar. Where am I using the rest of the sugar because further down the ingredients call for another 3/4 cup sugar? I started getting worried about the leftover sugar and couldn't find anywhere else I was going to use it. Did the writer have a mistake on the ingredients or directions? So I googled the recipe and of course found different measurements for both the milk and the sugar. Great. Just great. My dough is already made with only 2 tbsp milk and not 1 cup milk. I guess we shall see how this actually turns out.....and they tasted fine, just seemed to be more of a biscuit.

I tried this today and they were really good but I made some changes.  First I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup (next time I may cut it down some more) I may also cut on the butter when I roll them up cause they did caramelize on the bottom when baked.  I didn't add any butter to the frosting either. Just a little more milk and it was turned out real well.  Trying to eat a little more healthy and still not give up the good stuff completely.  They did make 18 rolls but I put them in 2- 9X13 pans & were still BIG rolls. Thank you for the good change from caramel rolls & I will be making them again.  Glenda

Turned out really well, even though I did a lot to screw it up. I forgot to add the melted butter while mixing the dough, so I ended up kneading it in at the end.  This actually made it really easy to knead and I didn't need to use as much extra flour many other reviewers did. Kind of messy though.  There is a lot of orange flavor, so if you want to taste the cream cheese in the frosting, leave out the extract there. We really liked it though. 

One problem we did run into was when I left them in the fridge over night a lot of moisture came out from the sugar/butter filling. They baked ok, but I ended up burning them a little on the bottom. Next time I think I'll try baking the same day and see if it helps.

First of all I want to say, "Thank you so very much, Rae, for creating such a wonderful recipe. Orange rolls are my favorite of all sweet rolls and I am absolutely thrilled to finally have a recipe that I can make at home from scratch. You rock!"

I want so very much to give these rolls a 5-star rating but I can't because of the frosting! The cream cheese overpowers the orange flavor that I crave in these rolls. The next time I make these, I will try using only 4oz. of cream cheese in the frosting.

The dough is soooo yummy! It is light and fluffy and has just the right amount of sweetness when baked with the sugar, butter, orange zest, and orange extract mixture rolled up inside. In fact, I could eat these rolls all day long without any frosting on them even though I usually choose sweet rolls that have lots of frosting.

Without the frosting they definitely get 5 stars from me.

My final decision as the recipe is written: 4.5 stars.

These were delicious! And a hit! So soft and buttery. I added orange peel and triple sec to the icing, and didn't add milk. I also ended up adding ICBINB spead to the icing because I ran out of butter. Can't wait to make again and add some scrambled eggs, sausage, home fries, and mimosas to the mix.

These came out really great! I made them for a potluck, so I cut the dough with a pizza cutter before rolling into 48 rolls (one cut in half longways and 24 cuts in the other direction). Then I rolled them up and placed them into 2 large rectangular dishes. They were very well received.

We loved these rolls!  I did make a 2 changes--mainly to use up ingredients I already had on hand.  I substituted buttermilk for the milk, and loved the added tang it gave the dough!  I suspect it also added a bit of leavening power, making for a lighter roll.  I didn't have enough butter for the full recipe, so I used half vegetable shortening, half butter in the dough.  The rest of the recipe I followed exactly.  My family demolished them all in a day.  The only off note was, I could taste the alcohol in the frosting from the orange extract.  I don't know if all extracts do this, or it was just the brand in my kitchen (Central Market), but next time I make these (and there will definitely be a next time!) I'll use 1 tsp extract and a tsp of orange zest instead.

Heavenly! I used OJ instead of extract, including in the frosting.  In addition, I used a tad less of butter in the filling and frosting. I baked half the rolls the same day.  Regardless of keeping overnight, they all  came out soft and not too greasy. A little labor intensive, but the texture of rolls and flavor made it well worth it. Will make again

Umm..amazing! Just, wow! Everyone loved these! They baked so evenly, there were no doughy centers. They baked up huge and soft. I added a little extra yeast in the dough.  I added a 1/4 cup fresh squeezed orange juice to the butter filling and frosting and a little extra orange extract. Best breakfast rolls I've ever made and I bake ALOT! Will be making these again and again!

These rolls are marvelous! I love orange rolls and have been looking for a recipe, and this is it! They were moist, soft, and delicious. The only thing that I changed was that I put some of the orange juice in the frosting instead of the extract. I will make these again.

These were very good - moist and flavorful.  I put cinnamon and brown sugar in the filling instead (I love cinnamon) and loved the combination of orange and cinnamon.  Even my husband, who is picky about sweets, loved them.  For fun, I also used the recipe to make cinnamon bread (cutting out the orange juice and extract and exchanging it for extra water (and/or milk) and vanilla extract.  I liked the bread too!

I've been making this recipe for 5 years nows and they are to die for. I follow it exactly, very careful not to skimp on the orange zest. It is now our family's recipe for Christmas morning, Easter and visiting new moms. They freeze well before baking, but don't cook evenly in those disposable pans. I recommend separating them on a cookie sheet for baking if I'm giving them frozen as a gift.

Great orange flavor, but way too much butter in the dough, if I were to do it over I would have just stuck with my own cinnamon roll recipe and added the orange to it. Perhaps mine was just didn't turn out well, but it looked like the rolls couldn't keep there shape while rising because the butter made the dough too soft, also I could taste the butter in the finished product just as much as I could taste the orange and the bottoms of the rolls were crunch as a result of all the butter melting and hardening with the sugar. Cut butter in half and substitute oil or something.

As with many sweet bread recipes, this one is not sweet. The texture is good and makes a savory roll as there is only 1 tablespoon sugar. The measly amount of vanilla pudding is a waste, as it does nothing to enhance the flavor. It calls for no sugar, (like most rolls of this sort do) after rolling out and spreading the butter. I think it would be better to add 1/2 cup sugar to the dough, and sprinkling at least a 1/2 cup sugar to the dough before rolling up. The frosting was yummy. I got a dozen, and not the 18 as the original recipe stated. They were 4 inches in diameter, and about 2 1/2 inches high. Perfect size. They looked prettier than they tasted.

Made it again. Flop! The liquid was way too much . I almost had to add another 500g of flour  which ruined the recipe. The orange juice gives no flavour and I think shd be avoided. Just add the milk and add extra water only if necessary. I did not add yeast to the liquid as my previous notes said not to but I think u shd as adding it to the flour I think ruined the recipe. DONT FORGET TO PUT IT ONLY ON PARCHMENT PAPER OTHERWISE IT STICKS BADLY TO THE TRAY.

These were fantastic!  It's the first time in awhile that I haven't tweaked a recipe and I'm glad I didn't.  I did have to add almost an extra cup of flour because the dough was too sticky to work with.  Other than that, made exactly as written and it put those canned orange rolls to shame.  Oh, just note that you have to roll the dough into a 27 x 12 inch rectangle, not 24 inches as the recipe states if you want 18 rolls.  And you will want lots of these rolls!
