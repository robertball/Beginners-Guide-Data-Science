I liked this, My advice:  use rice or udon noodles instead of spaghetti noodles, use coconut milk instead of coconut extract and evaporated milk (that will also make it vegan btw).  I didn't have zucchini so I subbed some other veggies (like green pepper and mushrooms), and I also ended up cooking it for a little longer.  I also did water and vegan chicken bouillon for the noodles.  I did ginger powder because I had it, but I think fresh ginger would be great...maybe cut the amount of spices (I did 3/4).

instead of using spaghetti, definately use your choice of thick asian noodles and an asian-inspired kick!

I  LOVE spicy foods, but the combination of curry and other spices was overwhelming.

This recipe was amazing, and I don't say that lightly. However, I used only 2 tsp. each coriander and cumin, and 2 tsp. turmeric and ginger. I also cut the curry powder down a little, though not by much. The only other change I made was using 6 oz. coconut milk instead of evaporated milk and coconut extract. My family loved this, and I'll definitely be making it again. Tastes even better served with a pot of coconut rice!

So fast and easy and yummy. I used thin slices of chicken and substituted coconut milk for evaporated milk and coconut extract only Based on what I had on hand. I added a little extra (tbsp) of coconut oil. And omg yummy!!

Use less turmeric. One teaspoon max. Could be a really tasty dish, but became overrun by the turmeric.
