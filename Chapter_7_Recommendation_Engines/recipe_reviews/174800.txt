I made it and it is beautiful. However as I was building the tower it didn't want to stay on, trying to slide off. It was getting top heavy. I took 4 long coffee stirrers and inserted them through the tower into the layers to give it some stability. I didn't risk putting a cone on top but added a little sugary treat to top it off.
