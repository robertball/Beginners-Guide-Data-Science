Interesting combination of ingredients.  I know that often curry can overpower flavor, so I started with 1/2 tsp, but after tasting, added the other 1/2.  Tastes very light, is loaded with protein and fiber, has a hint of curry, but no single ingredient dominates.   Used albacore tuna in water, fresh parsley, and served over some salad greens with sliced hard boiled egg and crackers for a nice lunch.  Thoroughly enjoyed.

Itâ€™s a great salad. Just needs a splash of lemon juice to make all the flavors pop.

I was looking for a yummy salad that's a good source of protein - and this is it! I used a little less olive oil, and little more fresh parsley.
