This was very good and everybody liked it.  One thing I would do differently next time is to toss the apples and cranberries together with the sugar etc.  I usually pile my apples really high because they shrink when cooking - I couldn't do that and put the cranberries on top because the cranberries would roll off.  So my pie ended up very thin.  Delicious but more the thickness of a tart.  With that one change this would be 5+ stars.  I do believe this will be making an appearance at the Thanksgiving dessert table.

My DH and I loved this pie, and I don't even like apple pie!  The combination of the sweet and tart was spot on for us.  I did make a change in the mixing of the ingredients.  I folded the apples, cranberries, sugar, cornstarch and cinnamon together before adding it to the crust.  I also zested the peel from an orange that I had in the mix.  Dotted the filling and added the top crust.  I had Honey Crisp and Granny Smith apples, so I used a mixture of both kinds.  Wonderful served with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream.  SaraSunshine, you have a winner on your hands - thanks for sharing.

This pie has a refreshing tartness that is usually absent from the Thanksgiving table. It's not fussy and very versatile. Last night, instead of apples, I thawed some peaches that we froze last August. I also added 1/4 tsp. of cloves. Like another reviewer, I mixed the fruit, sugar, cornstarch and spices before adding to the pie. On a scale of 1 to 5, my husband gave it a 10.

Delicious! I added about 1/4 cup of coarsely chopped walnuts and about 1/2 tsp of orange zest.  Even my picky mother liked it.

Started with this basic recipe and after reading comments about tartness I decided to combine the cranberries with 1/2 cup of sweetener (I used Splenda for baking) and 1/2 cup  liquid, I used cranberry diet juice but I believe water would be fine. let this cook about 10-15 min. Berries will pop  and will have a consistency of  soft jam as they cool . I added   the cinnamon to the cooling cranberries,  and also used 1/2 cup  brown sugar, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, apples were then mixed in.  I also added  1/4 cup of finely chopped pecans.  I substituted 2 tbsp minute tapioca for the cornstarch. I used Gala apples.   great flavors, tangy without  bitterness or overwhelming  sweetness and most important these changes worked for my family.

Great recipe, however, my cranberries were super tart so I ended up picking around most of them while eating this. Don't know if this is normal for cranberries. I know they're relatively tart anyways, but mine just seemed way too sour. Some of them unbearably so. That said...
I, like the other reviewers mixed the apples, sugar, cornstarch and cranberries together. Just makes more sense to do it that way. Next time I make this, I'll be changing the amount of cranberries to only a cup or maybe even just half a cup. Overall, really good and everyone that tried it liked it. A nice variation on apple pie. And for those curiousâ€¦I used gala apples.

I was worried about the cranberries but they baked just fine and their tartness combined with the sugar and apples in a delightful way.  There were no leftovers!

Made a variation of this pie recipe based on some of the suggestions in the posted reviews.  The result was a delicious pie with the perfect balance of tartness and sweetness.   I used granny smith apples and increased the number of apples to eight.   Decreased the amount of fresh cranberries to 1  1/4 cups.   Used 1/2 cup granulated sugar and a 1/4 cup dark brown sugar.  Added 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg and 1/4 teaspoon salt.  Substituted two tablespoons of all purpose flour for the cornstarch.   Cooked the flour in the two tablespoons of melted butter  over low heat for about 30 seconds.   Removed from the heat and stirred in the sugar, salt and spices  Tossed the apples and cranberries with the sugar-spice mixture in  large bowl before adding the filling into the  prepared pie pan.  Baked for 50 minutes.   It was a hit at this year's Thanksgiving feast.  Will definitely be making this one again.

The cranberries were WAY too tart. They were completely inedible. I don't know if adding more sugar would help? I took the advice of one of the reviewers and mixed the apples and cranberries with the sugar mixture in a bowl first, before putting it into the pie. So maybe that was where I went wrong. Maybe if you place the apples, then cranberries, then the sugar mixture on top, the cranberries get most of the sugar? I don't know. But I probably will not make this again.

As someone else suggested, I tossed the berries and apples with the sugar, spice, and cornstarch. I also added some extra cinnamon, a bit of nutmeg and a dash of clove to jazz it up. I also used only 2 medium Granny Smiths, which would be about half the apples called for, but the sugar was just right. I don't like my sweets as sweet as some people do, and cranberries should be tart! Fabulous! Definitely a keeper!

I used granny smith apples and frozen cranberries. I increased the cornstarch to 1 1/2 TBSP.   I was concerned that the pie might be a bit too tart based on other reviews, so I increased the sugar to 1 cup. I followed other's suggestions and tossed everything except the butter together in a bowl and then added it to the pie shell.  The pie turned out perfect. The consistency was spot on with the increased cornstarch. The pie had a nice balance of sweet and tart, with just the right amount of tartness. I will  make this  pie again

I make this every year for both Thanksgiving and Christmas (it's in the oven as we speak). My sister who HATES pie devours this. I've made it in the summer as well, substituting frozen raspberries for the cranberries, and my husband loves that version. The only things I do differently from the recipe is I double the butter, and then I do an egg wash on the top crust, and add sugar sprinkles (the latter so my dad would stop insisting on buying an apple pie from Costco because he wanted the sugar crystal crunch on top).

I followed recipe exactly as it was written. I only read the comments after putting the pie in oven and thought I should have mixed the sugar etc.. into the apples but it still came out amazing! No leftover pie! Very fast and simple to make. Definitely a keeper!

Everyone loved this Christmas dinner pie.
My modifications involved pre-cooking the sugar, apples and cranberries in a saucepan for a few minutes until the apples are softened before placing them in the pie shell.

YUM! (I made a double batch for two pies.)  It's strong point is that it's not pure sugar, we loved the tartness, too. I pulsed the fresh cranberries (10 oz bag) twice in our FP, and tossed them with the apples (4 Grannies, 2 Fuji's, 1 Pink Lady and 1 Honey Crisp) in the sugar mix and let them sit there while I made crusts. It was the perfect amount for a 10" and a smaller 8". Definitely line your oven or place on foiled cookie sheets.

I made it per the directions, with the cranberries layered on top of the apples - turned out wonderful, and guests asked for the recipe.  I think it adds interest, as each bite has a slightly different mix of apples and cranberries.  My apples were more sweet than tart, so I reduced the sugar just a little, and added a tiny sprinkle of amaretto on the berries.  It was a great pie, and looked beautiful- will make again!

The only thing I changed was mixing the apples and cranberries with the sugar mixture first before putting it in the crust. I also cut up the cranberries. The pie wasn't too wet, it came out good but there were not enough apples for my liking. I used a 9.5" glass pie plate and store bought crust but the pie top was flat instead of rounded and the apple flavor was completely lost, it just tasted like cranberry sauce pie. I think it needs 3-4 more apples.

Very good.  I left the top crust off and sprinkled with raw sugar about half way through the cooking time. Then drizzled a little balsamic vinegar glaze over the top. Will make this one again!

Added 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg inside
Generously sprinkled cinnamon/ sugar on top before placing in the oven
I made two pies one for the family gathering of 25 and one for myself. I left the party early to take the seniors (90 and up) home and the pie was half gone but those who ate a piece were suggesting others should try it.  My personal pie was gone in 2 days.

It was just too tart. The apples tasted great but the addition of the cranberries was too much. I might try again but with less cranberries and more apples.

instead of cutting slits in the top crust I used a pie vent and to brown the top crust I brushed it with melted butter

Followed the advice of others and mixed the apples and cranberries in the sugar mixture. I put half the cranberries at the bottom and then mixed in the rest with the apples.  I also added about an eight of a cup of brown sugar. It was excellent. I will definitely make this again.

This is a good standard pie recipe, that I think could be replicated with a lot of different fruits and turn out great.  However, I do think that if you're using the cranberries and apples, that you should put the cranberries at the bottom rather than the top.  They're so sour, and because they were at the top they didn't absorb most of the sugar which generally sinks towards the bottom.  This was the only unpleasant part of eating it.  If you put the cranberries at the bottom, they absorb the sweet filling more, and there is more of a balance with the overall pie.

I made a couple of tweaks to make it vegan and I used a streusel topping and a ready made shortbread crust.

I cut the cranberries and added 1/3+ of the sugar before adding to the pie.  It was delicious & beautiful!

A really nice balance of tart and sweet.  Cranberries  give new zip to a traditional apple pie recipe.  Everyone here liked it and we'll make it again --- andf again.

The pie was tasty but varied from one forkful to the next. One bite being sweet while the next was very tart. If I was to make this recipe again I would separate the sugar mixture and use half to coat the cranberries then use the remainder to sprinkle over the top.

I didn't follow my instincts and put the apples and cranberries in the dry sugar mix, but added the liquid as the recipe said.  Don't do this!  You can't mix it up well enough to get the pie to set after it is cooked.  It was a runny mess until what was left of it, spent a night in the fridge.  Flavor is great.  I will make it again, but doing it the way I stated above.

I have made this many times.  since I have a huge family I adapt it and use a 13 x 17 casserole dish and put Cinnamon Sugar on top.  When it comes out of the oven it literally disappears!  Goes well for Thanksgiving or Christmas....usually my family wants it for both.  All I can say is that when I show up to the gatherings I hear them saying: " did she make it?"

This pie was very watery, but tasty. If I make this type of pie again, I will cook the cranberries first, then add the apples and nuts ( used hazelnuts).

Five starts for a great basic recipe. I emptied my freezer of frozen fruits (1/2 cup mango, 1 cup strawberry, and only 1 cup of cranberry). I thawed them in microwave with one sliced Granny Smith apple. I folded in corn starch/sugar/cinnamon mixture before adding to pie crust.  Followed rest of directions. YUM! My other fruits must have tamed the cranberry tartness because it tasted perfectly balanced!
