The first time I made this, I made it as written.  It was good, but you couldn't taste the chocolate - they just tasted like pralines.

The next time I used 1/3 cup of cocoa, instead of 1 T.
OMG - they were AMAZING, and so chocolatey!!!

Wanted to make pralines for my mother-in-law. Have been trying a lot of praline recipes, this was the 3rd try--home run! My husband doesn't like pralines but thought these were great. It helps to have more complete directions too. I did add 1t. cinnamon since they were Mexican and I love cinnamon in my chocolate-and doubled the cocoa since I like darker chocolate!

I took this to work for a Mexican theme luncheon and everyone loved it! I have requests for it frequently and everyone wants the recipe! Made it as written. Thanks!

So yummy, fast and easy! i added 1 teaspoon cinnamon (everything sweet is better with cinn). takes 20 mins to make + 10 min to set up = ready to eat in 30 mins! Ingredients are basic staple items! Made them for son's Mardi Gras party at school, and was thankful to find this recipe, as he of course forgot to tell me he needed a treat for school party the next morning. :)

This is pretty tasty. As per some other reviewers, I added cinnamon. I think the 10 min stirring at the end might be a little long. I didn't do it that long, and it was already setting as I was getting them onto the cookie sheet. It didn't spread at all.

I added just a pinch of chipotle chili pepper along with the initial ingredients and once placed on parchment paper, dusted with a pinch of coarse sea salt.... both of those combined gave it just a hint of heat and the salt cut the sweetness at just the right amount.  Delish!
