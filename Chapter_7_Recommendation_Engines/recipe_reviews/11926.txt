I think its SooOoO important that everyone follows the recipe. If you substitute the main ingredient in this recipe which is the SOBA noodles with reg. Spaghetti noodles, you are making a totally diff. dish. I think people should follow the recipe the 1st time around and tweak if they wish the second time around. Its not fair to the person submitting the recipe to get low ranks if you dont follow their recipe.Specially like using a completly different noodles. Soba is a gray buckwheat noodle that has a very different taste then rice noodles or reg spagehtti noodles.

In a word: yum! This is an excellent recipe. I love soba noodles, and here their wonderful flavor and texture is enhanced by the delicious marinade. Carrots and red bell peppers add crunch, and the green onions are the perfect finishing touch. I made a batch of this salad last Sunday and took it to school with me for lunch four days in a row, and as the week went on, the flavors melded further and became even richer and tastier. Not only is this delicious, it's quite healthy, too. An all-around winner... I will definitely make this again.

I went to Trader Joe's and purchased Soba noodles and did not know what to do with them. So, I went to this web site and typed in soba noodles and this showed up. Well, I made it for my lunch  the next day and really enjoyed it. I will make this again.

The soba noodles definitely make the recipe. I followed the recipe almost exactly, with a few tweakings of my own. Omitted the tamari, added in a couple tablespoons of Vietnamese fish sauce and a bag of frozen Asian vegetables -subbed for the red pepper- with some chunks of chicken - it was delicious! Will definitely be making this again.

This was fabulous Juanita! Didn't have any soba noodles so I subbed with Ramen. Due to allergies, I had to omit the carrots but used matchstick size cucs instead, along with some savoy cabbage. To make it a complete meal, I surrounded the platter with thinly sliced leftover london broil and grilled chicken. I made extra sauce to marinade my chicken in and it came out wonderfully. Absolutely delicious recipe and my family thanks you!

This is delicious!!!!  I made the sauce exactly as presented here.  The only changes I made to the recipe are that I marinated some finely diced chicken in a little of the sauce and then sauted it and added to the salad and I couldn't find soba noodles so I used fresh shanghai noodles.  Great flavours worth finding all the ingredients for.  Thank you.

Did not care for this and will probably throw most of it away.  I made it for my husband and I last night, followed the recipe exactly with all of the correct ingredients.  I was also looking for a tasty cold Chinese noodle salad, this wasn't it for us.  Didn't care for the sauce.

I have made this recipe for potlucks, for company, for the family, and for friends. It always gets rave reviews.  Many times, I do add a few more sweet pepper (red and yellow) than the recipe calls for, but I follow the rest of the directions to the letter. It really does need to marinate at least six hours or overnight.

This is good as it is, but the fresh carrots came out too raw. Next time I will blanch them. I didn't have red bellpepper so instead added a cucumber cut into matchstick size just before serving. Fresh cucumber seems to balance out the saltiness of soy sauce. It makes great color contrast too!

Not what I expected....I was looking for a really fabulous cold noodle recipe and this wasnt it...I think the potential is there but I threw a huge bowl of this out. I think it was my own fault...I used 1 lb. of extra thin rice noodles instead of the soba noodles. It was my first time making and tasting rice noodles...and I hated the taste of them. My thought is that the recipe would have been better with thin spaghetti. Noone liked it or ate it..into the trash. Sorry.

I enjoyed these noodles - a nice change from the usual. If you don't have Tamari (which is a type of thicker, less salty soy sauce), either go buy some (you'll thank me!) or use soy sauce, keeping in mind the saltiness. Worcestershire sauce, molasses, and fish sauce are not close substitutes at all, and you will end up with something completely different.  I highly recommend you don't sub out the soba noodles for spaghetti. Soba noodles have a unique flavor and texture. A small amount of dry noodles will make a huge bowl of noodles once cooked, so no need to worry there won't be enough!  Also, if you don't like the sharp, pungent flavor of sesame oil, either use LIGHT sesame oil, or use half dark sesame oil and half peanut oil.  I didn't bother with the extra steps of marinating the noodles first, then adding the veggies. I just tossed everything together and set it in the fridge for a few hours. The flavors really do get better the longer it sits.

I have made this twice now, I think it is a perfect dinner dish for a really hot day.  The dressing complements the earthiness of the soba noodles.

Soba noodles are great, but my wife is on a low carb kick and I made this using soy noodles. Wasn't the same but good none the less.
Since I love green onion, I served extra at the table to sprinkle. A squirt of lime juice and a few sprigs of cilantro and you cross the border to Viet Nam

This is delicious.  We up the veggies by using a cup of julliened cucumber as well--just make 1/3 as much dressing.  My daughter takes this for lunch often with a side of salmon or sliced chicken.

GREAT!  Very refreshing, quick and tasty.  I used green tea flavoured soba noodles.  I only decreased the sesame oil and increased the rice wine vinegar due to personal preference.  I will make again, thanks!

I enjoyed the flavor of this recipe, but it was a little too oily for me.  Next time I will reduce the oil and increase the tamari to add more flavor.  Be warned... a pound of soba cooks up to a *lot* of noodles.  If you're not sure about this, I suggest trying a half recipe first.

Awesome recipe! It has a subtle, fresh taste and just the right amount of veggies. I'll be making this one again, I'm sure! The only thing I didn't have was chili oil--I put in a few shakes of red pepper flakes, but maybe next time I'll try a scant squirt of sriracha?

I made this last night for my boyfriend and me - we thought it was ok. I made the recipe to the T - We both thought it was maybe the after taste of the wheat in the noodles we didnt like? Not sure? maybe didnt let it marinate long enough?

Yummy! Very good recipe. I didn't have tamari sauce, so I used a dark mushroom soya sauce instead. Still turned out very well - loved the sesame seed oil! The flavours definitely taste better after sitting for a while - but I didn't bother dividing up the sauce.  I just put the whole thing together at the beginning and let it sit.

Excellent recipe.  I didn't have the tamari and couldn't find it in local grocery stores....so I used 'sweetened soy sauce' and didnt' add the sugar.  Worked well.  Hubby loved it, and asked I make it up again two days after the first try :-)  Thanks so much for a great recipe.

Tastes good and looks pretty!..  It's a nice light dish for a hot summer day!   I made some changes due to what I had in my pantry:   First of all my pkg of soba noodles was 12oz. and it worked perfectly.   I added some shredded zucchini along with the red pepper and carrot.  Used canola oil in place of the sesame and chili oil.  Sliced red onions in place of the green.  I sprinkled sesame seeds in the dish and added a t fresh grated ginger.  I added about 1T of Sriyachi sauce for heat. In place of tamari sauce I used 2T soy and 1T molasses and it worked!   Didn't follow all the steps/hours but after the initial marinating time just threw the rest in before serving; thanks! :)

i really enjoyed this recipe except i made a couple of changes. first off, i wouldn't use as much sesame oil next time. i didn't have tamari sauce so based on another review, i used soy sauce mixed with worcestshire sauce. after mixing it with the noodles, i left some sauce aside because i wanted to cook the carrots a bit. i also added organic fried tofu (it had a bit of sezchuan sauce on it). i fried it up using the remainder of the sauce along with some garlic and ginger and the carrots. when it was ready to serve, i just added it to the dish on top rather than mixing the vegetables together (because of the different temperatures). i'll definitely make this again!

I had run out of tamari so I used worchestershire and cut way back on the 1/4 C... same with the sesame oil, I'm on a diet! But this is a good quick lunch, and something you can be creative with.

I thought this was good, but my husband did not like the sesame oil flavor. I think it is an acquired taste. If you like sesame oil, you will probably like this dish.

This was good. I wasn't able to find soba noodles, but I'll pick some up next time I go to the asian market across town.  I added some extra vegetables to the leftovers. This would also be good with some cold sliced chicken.

i would recommend adding more flavour/seasoning because on its own it tasted like rubber:/

I will make it again. I didn't have any chili oil so I just add sriracha sauce to each dish when I eat.
