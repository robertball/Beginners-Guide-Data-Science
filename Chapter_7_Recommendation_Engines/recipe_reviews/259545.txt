Wow!  This recipe was a huge hit at the party.  All what I kept hearing was 'who made these?'.  These were gone  so quickly.  Because I didn't have time to prep and cut puff pastry, I bought frozen mini phyllo cups.  These were actually perfect and made for bite-sized appetizers.  I would do this again every time!   I also did not cut off the rind of my brie.  It's not necessary and it's totally edible.  Save yourself some time :)

I put the phyllo cups on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper then prepped my cups.

I used probably about 1/4 teaspoon of cranberry sauce  in each.  My brie pieces were about 1/4 to 1/2 inch and I finely crumbled my walnuts and sprinkled them over, since chopped pieces would be too big for the cups.  Topped it off with the coarse sea salt.

I baked these according to the directions on the phyllo cups which was 350 degrees F for about 18-22 minutes until they were golden brown.  The bites were crispy, the flavor was amazing and the clean up was a breeze!   

Great recipe!!  Wish I would have taken a photo.

Love these!  They are now the most requested appetizer I make for parties.  I used seeded raspberry jam, not cranberry, but everything else is the same.  

It's SO IMPORTANT to spray the hell out of that mini muffin pan with Pam or the jam will stick to the pan.

One thing I learned is that I need to put a larger cookie sheet underneath the mini muffin pan because sometimes the jam bubbles up and spills over on the edges.

I made this according to recipe the first time and got raving reviews. I made it again, used filo cups, used 3 berry jam (homemade by my sister in law), candied chopped pecans (found in the salad section where the croutons are) and a little dash of salt & pepper to balance the sweetness of the jam. These went so fast you wouldn’t believe it! This is the BEST recipe.

AMAZING recipes. I made these for Thanksgiving as an app. My family thought they were super fancy and delicious. Used raspberry preserves instead of cranberry sauce. Also tried bacon and egg.

I would cook them a bit longer and roll the dough a bit thinner.  The pastry tastes better and the texture is better if a bit crispy.

Very good! Fifteen minutes probably would have been enough in the oven for presentation’s sake. (They were smoking by 18 minutes, with melted cheese bubbling over the sides, leaving a crater in the center, but still really tasty.) Be sure to grease the muffin tins well!

Great recipe, relatively easy.  Wish I had used bigger piece of cheese.   Also used premade walnut/cranberry sauce especially prepared for using it with Brie.   Turned out beautifully.  Made one day ahead and popped in the oven right before serving.   Would make again.

These were a hit at Thanksgiving. Instead of cranberry sauce, I used a cranberry-jalapeño jelly that I found at Whole Foods.

As suggested in a prior review, I used frozen pastry mini cups.  It was a quick assembly of ingredients and my company enjoyed the hors d’oeuvres.  I will be making these again.

I used the puff pastry shells and because I had no Brie, I used squares of black pepper cheese in half of the shells and smoked Gouda squares in the other half. Topped it with the a small spoonful of Hickory Farms Hot Pepper Bacon Jam and topped with candied pecans. They were to die for! Variations to this recipe are endless.

I made these last thanksgiving as a quick and easy appetizer. I used Pillsbury croissant dough and they came out great. They were a big hit. Will probably make them again for Christmas.

Overall, a great recipe. The first pan seemed like it had no Brie in the cups so we changed to three cubes in each. Much better!

This was simple and quick to make and very tasty! The flavors sounded a little redundant to me for Thanksgiving, but the combination of each element with that sprinkle of sea salt was anything but! Everyone loved them. I followed the directions exactly. I bet it would be good with raspberry jam and almonds as well. I followed the recommendation of another review that the listed baking time was a bit long, and sure enough! They baked for 15 minutes and were perfectly done. 18 would have been MUCH to dark.., so I too recommend keeping an eye on them a bit sooner. Will definitely make again!

I followed another review and instead of the frozen pastry I used  frozen phyllo cups on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper . Added  1/4 teaspoon of cranberry sauce  and then a teaspoon of Brie. Didn’t top with salt but may try coarse sea salt next time per another review. I baked per the package at  350 degrees F for about 18-22 until crispy and bubbly. They were all gone in minutes! Delicious

These were very easy to make and very tasty. I used sliced almonds rather than walnuts because I like almonds more, and that's what I had in my pantry.  You do need to be careful that the pastry comes up fully on all sides or the jelly will get under the pastry and burn on the bottom. I had a few random ones that had to be thrown out because of a burnt bottom. I used jellied cranberry sauce, but any flavor jam or jelly would be good. I'll definitely make these again.

Really tasty, but I used too much cranberry. Kind of overpowered the Brie. And the tops of the pastry will get too brown before the bottoms get cooked crispy. So next time I’ll lay a sheet of foil over the pan once the tops are nicely brown. And the salt is definitely needed. Will make again. They look nice on the platter.

These were excellent as an appetizer before Thanksgiving.  Just watch out for the cranberry ( or whatever you use) in regards to heat.  It stays really hot a lot longer than the outside.

If you’re looking for a festive holiday appetizer, this is perfect.  I followed recipe except for puffed pastry.  I thought I had that ingredient and didn’t. I used crescent roll sheets instead. Turned out great!  I’m sure it’s just as yummy with puffed pastry.  
This is definitely a keeper.  Holidays or just an easy to pull together appetizer!

These were great, first appetizer to go! Made as written except I used chopped pecans because that’s what I had. Only baked for 15 min or even slightly less. Will make again, super easy and very popular.

These were so easy and so delicious!  I made them for a bubbly party and they not only paired well with the sparkling wines but received rave reviews from everyone.  The hardest part of the was getting the rind off the brie-but that is why you put it in the freezer for a bit first.  I would highly recommend.

I would definitely make again. They were so tasty. Salt flakes really enhanced flavor. My tip would be to try to make the pastry pieces as close to a square as  possible.

I made this for a Christmas party and it was a hit!  I did do like one reviewer said and bought phyllo cups ( pre baked ) and made my homemade cranberry sauce. I did everything else according to the recipe. I do not like the Brie coating so I did cut it off.  I made 30 and they were all gone and people asking for the recipe. Try it!

I have tried these a few ways now. Although the pre-made phyllo cups do save time, everyone liked it better with the pastry puff that I bought from Trader Joe’s. I used leftover cranberry Sauce that was made with a tinge of orange. You could use jam like others suggested but then it is more of a dessert. I liked the savory aspect with the cranberry sauce. It was nice and tart. Delicious.

Made these for Thanksgiving and they were a huge hit!!!! Guests loved them!! HOWEVER I used mini PHYLLO SHELLS instead of using the pastry sheets and they worked perfectly!!!!   I also substituted sliced almonds for the walnuts. This recipe will definitely be part of my go-to appetizer collection!!!!!

I made the Cranberry Brie Bites for Easter.  Everyone absolutely loved them.  The plate was empty in no time.  
I was pleasantly surprised at how easy and quick process this was.  They looked and tasted fabulous.

I've made these to take to a couple of parties now, and they always get rave reviews. Simple and quick to make, but so much great flavor, and they look festive.  I garnished with a bit of fresh rosemary which added to the festive look. I think I'll use a little less cranberry sauce next time, but otherwise than that, these are perfect little bites and people seem to love.

12/22/18 - I skipped the walnuts but otherwise followed the recipe.  I guess I cut my Brie a little small, as I used about half the round on a full sheet of puff pastry.  These got good reviews and tasted good, were a little messy to display (some of the jam melted out of the cup).

I made this appetizer for a Christmas Party.  They were delicious and everyone loved them.  The only difference was that I used standard sized muffin tins instead of mini muffin tins.  Additionally, since I'm not a big walnut fan I used finely chopped pecans.  They were easy to make and very  popular with my guests!

They were excellent. Due to my need to keep the sodium down I made an easy puff pastry and my own cranberry sauce which worked out nicely.

One of the easiest recipes - my husband did most of it --and he does not cook!  Make more than one batch - they disappear quickly!

I like these small bites so much better than a traditional gooey mess of a large baked brie in puff pastry. They are perfect for Thanksgiving or a fall party. I added a few dried cranberries to each one, although I doubt that it made much of a difference.
