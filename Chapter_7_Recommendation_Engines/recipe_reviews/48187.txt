WOW! 
What a great dish ... Would NEVER have thought to mix these various flavors.
Only thing I did different was transfer the chicken and raisins to a dish and thicken the sauce with a bit of corn starch. Also, added 1 peeled, cored and chopped apple to the sauce just as it was beginning to thicken. 
Certainly a keeper in my book...
Thanks for posting this DEE Licious recipe.

I made this since I had two children visiting. They did not like it at all nor did the adults. I would not suggest this recipe.

Wonderful "Fall" dish. I made it as my father carved pumkins with my kids. The smell in my home was awesome. I added cut up apples and sprinkled feta cheese over the top. I also thickened the sauce with cornstarch.Gorgonzala cheese would be even better but I didn't have any in the house. It reminded me of spice cake! My kids like spice cake. If you are not a fan of spice you may not like this dish. My 4 year old ate it all gone!

This is a fantastic recipe!!!!  It is very easy to make and tastes gourmet.  The chicken takes on the flavor of the spices and apple and the raisins soak up the sweetness of the juice.  If you don't like things too sweet don't eat the raisins. This one is definitely a keeper.

I think this one may be more suited for children than adults.  It was just too sweet for my taste.

The sauce is excellent, but I will agree with the other reviewers who thought that the chicken itself lacked flavor.  Not sure if I should cook it slower next time or marinade it in the sauce before hand.  That being said, the sauce is delicious it's just that the chicken needs to absorb more of the flavor.  Also, I might try this over some jasmine rice or couscous next time to bind everything together.

Not very flavorful, but has some potential.  Going to try to bake this dish instead to get the flavors more firmly rooted.

Great recipe. Loved how the spices made a coating on the chicken pieces.  We tossed the remaining sauce with pasta - a repeater for sure!

I didn't much care for this. I found it very bland as it was and we had to season it up in order to enjoy. It smelled very good while cooking though.

I also tweaked a little.  Sauted onions with the apple and then added the juice and seasonings.  Also added a bit of red pepper flakes to spice it up for my hubby.  It was great and will definetly be making this again! ps my little boy liked it too!

The kids ate it, which is really saying something. I found it to be very mild, and lacking a little flavor. I still found it to be very good. Unlike other reviewers, I did not find this recipe overly sweet. Stay away if you don't like curry. It's mild, but the flavor is definately there. five stars for the fact that it's a quick, easy, healthy meal that both kids an adults will eat.

I thought it was delicious!  I added some sugar snap peas and served it over rice.  I simmered it for a little while to let the sauce thicken and absorb more of the flavor.  Might use a little less apple juice next time as it was still a little thin.

My apple flavor came from actual apples instead of the apple juice, and I used chicken stock instead. Still the spices were great. Added corn starch to thicken the juice and served on top. Thanks!

This was fantastic!!! Like another reader, I added fresh peeled apples for more texture. I also added walnuts for a bit of crunch. I found it a little heavy on the cinnamon, so I'll use a little less next time. Definitely a "make again"!

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe very much.  The curry was a great touch.  We experimented and found that one can also make it with pork for a nice change, especially in Autumn.  (In fact, we prefer it that way.)

Wow it looks like you either loved it or hated it, I loved it! I added some chopped up apples and applesauce to thicken it. If you're not a big fan of curry and spice then obviously steer clear, but if you are, it's great!

My first review. This is my favorite web site for finding recipes.I have found a lot of delicious recipes on this website, however this is not one of them.Sorry!Too strong a flavor for chicken. After I cooked it and did not like the chicken I put the raisin, apple topping on oatmeal, which was very good.

Left out the cloves and curry powder and cooked whole chicken breast instead of cutting it up. Used dried cranberries instead of raisins. Hubby who doesn't like chicken LOVED this recipe especially with the extra cinnamon I threw in. Too bad this recipe won't work on the grill.

My husband and I loved this, our 2 and 5 year old loved the chicken but not the sauce.  I did a few things differently to help with the flavour of the chicken.  I cooked the chicken for a little while without the apple juice.  I sprinkled the chicken with salt and pepper and the other spices and after it was about half cooked, I added the apple juice.  Also, I left out the raisins.  As  recommended, at the end I removed most of the juice and put it in a sauce pan with some flour to thicken it up.  We served it over rice and it was great.

Took the good advice of others and marinated the cubed chicken for 1/2 an hour.  Also added apple slices halfway through the cooking time.  Served it over a brown rice/quinoa mix and my husband and son loved it!

What a great idea - apples, raisins, cinnamon and CHICKEN! Who knew? Husband LOVED it. I made changes - simplified it (no curry/spices) and marinated chicken in apple juice for 1/2 hour before cooking. THANKS!
