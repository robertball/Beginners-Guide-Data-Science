I was looking for something to use up my tomatoes from my garden and this was a yummy way to do it.  I've used it as a dip, and I LOVE it on hamburgers as a relish.  I've even chopped up and added zucchini to it.  Thank you for a great recipe!

This was great - it tasted so fresh. I didn't have an onion, so I just used some onion powder. I also added some basil, parsley, and rosemary from my yard.

Very simple and a great way to use up leftover veggies from the garden.  I added about 1/2 tea of sugar to cut some of the acidity and some Italian Seasonings.  We served this with some crackers and cheese and it made a great appetizer.

I found myself looking for a way to use up a bunch of tomatoes I had on my counter and stumbled across this recipe. It has a nice, fresh flavor. I added in 1/2tsp of sugar as suggested by another reviewer, and I found it to be necessary.  I also added in fresh basil, which definitely kicked this sauce up to the next level. I served it over whole wheat spaghetti. For my tastes, I had to cook the sauce about 35 minutes, the last 15 mins with a lid, because the onions weren't quite done.  Next time I will try this served over bread as suggested. Very simple!

I used this as a base for all my end of season tomatoes and sweet peppers of several varieties. Easy to do. Makes a tasty basic sauce that can be adapted with spices to many uses.

Nice ingredients. I added mushrooms, fresh oregano, fresh basil, fresh rosemary. Might throw the boiled tomatoes into a food processor or blender next time to smooth out the consistency. Upped the garlic first, saut√©ed it first for added flavor. Will definitely use this recipe again.
