I made this for a Thanksgiving potluck. The macadamias and coconut on top did burn. If I made this again I would add both ingredients to the top at the end of the cooking time.

this is one of my FAVORITES!  I've been making this for years and wanted to make sure it was posted!!  I use mixed nut.  I've not had them burn.  I have not tried coconut, but I'm excited to try! This is so easy and tastes GREAT, if your reading this recipe, you must try it!!

I read all the reviews prior to making. So basically use 2 cans of pineapple, and half the amount of butter is all that is necessary. I used butter cake mix because it was all I could find in a hurry at the store - honestly I am betting it made this stuff even better! Delicious! And this whole thing literally took 3 minutes to put together. I will make again but next time with less coconut, I could barely tell there was cake underneath all that coconut (I used a whole package). Will update when I try again.

I made this today for work and it turned out amazing!  I didn't have any nuts or coconut, so it was mostly just pineapple, cherry pie filling (*lite* and 2 cans, not 1), cake mix and butter, but it was *amazing*!!  Hope you enjoy it as much as we did!

A dear family friend of ours used to make this, and it was a favorite of ours for a long time. We prepared it somewhat differently though. Instead of melting the butter, we sliced thin pieces of butter and distributed them all over the top of the cake mix, then we topped with crushed walnuts and coconut. It's such a simple and quick (and delicious) dessert to make!

The taste was very good, and you can't beat the ease of preparation.  But 50 minutes in the oven was way too long and mine was burnt around the edges.  Next time I'll bake it for much less.

Good starter recipe. I had no trouble with the coconut burning. Baked on the medium rack for 50 mins. And kept checking to see the coconut browning and the filling bubbling.  Also sprinkled the dry cake mix with cinnamon and a little brown sugar before I added the coconut. Added a small bag of thawed, drained sweet pitted cherries with the pie filling. Everyone liked it.

I've made this recipe many times (minus the nuts and coconut), 1/2 the butter - sliced thin, rather than melted. I use 2 cans of cherry pie filling rather than 1. And I serve it with a scoop of french vanilla ice cream on top. Quite sweet but very yummy. Kids love it! Next time I make it I am going to try topping it with the coconut and chopped pecans.

use to make this with the kids when they were pre-teens. Now being a grandmother, I use the French vanilla cake mix with 1/2 c of melted butter, making it a crumbled topping for the top. I use 1 can of crushed pineapple with juice & 2 cans of the cherry pie filling.  I bake mine for 50 min. & put pieces of dark chocolate squares on top of the crumbled cake mix at the last 5 min of baking. Over the years we have used different taste variations such as pineapple/apple pie filling with caramel flavor cake mix for a caramel apple taste...

This was good but not stellar.  I think there is too much coconut (which is surprising).  Tasty and super easy but not award-winning.

This might have been good but I saw the same recipe cooked in a crockpot on low for 3 hrs. It was moist and great that way. This was ok but dry compared to the crockpot method.

I had previously gave a not so savory review because when it came out of the oven and cooled for 30 minutes it was still mushy. But man when I woke up this morning and everything set, it was delicious. I couldn't stop eating it!  What a difference a day makes!

I keep going back in the pan for another spoonful!  I used chopped pecans and only used a handful of coconut.  So good and easy!  Will be making this again.

I will make it again. I did cut the butter in thin slices rather than try to get even spread with melted butter. I line coconut but I might use half as much next time to see how that is

Made this on Christmas 2017. It was good while warm, except everyone thought there were too many nuts (along with the coconut, made it quite crumbly). If I make it again I will only use 1/2 the amount of macadamia nuts.Also feel that  the coconut would have been better between pineapple and cake layers OR before melted butter. Lastly, I used 1 can of Lucky Leaf Tart Red Cherries. I think the Pie Filling would have been better although a whole lot sweeter. As made, it had just the right amount of sweetness, but cherries turned unappealing color and texture was off when dessert cooled.

Excellent!  Substituted chopped pecans form macadamia nuts cup for cup. Baked about 45 minutes based on other reviews. Thanks !
