Cream butter and sugar for only 30 seconds or so to avoid whipping in too much air. This will keep the cookies from going flat.

This recipe will be a remake & a tweaked. Easy recipe to follow, quick to put together. However, after I mixed everything, the blueberries looked like there wasn't enough in the recipe. So I added 1/4th cup more. Then when I baked them, the oatmeal looked like it was swallowed up by the cookie. The flavor was very nice, slightly chewy on the bottom but still tasted like a blueberry muffin, in a form of a cake-like cookie. This is something I will make again, with some adjustments to make it more...chunky.

I thought these were a good cookie. I found it upon a search looking for something to do with a little bit of dried blueberries I had left. I thought they were a nice looking cookie. For some reason, which I didn't expect, they were quite a bit sweet. I loved the smell of the blueberries and oatmeal baking. My only suggestion is to use quick oats instead of old fashioned rolled oats in cookies, as they leave a bit of a chew. I made 1/2 recipe and got 15 cookies.

Always get many people asking for this recipe.  These are special treats for my Grandchildren and always bring big smiles. I like to use fresh berries whenever possible., but when not possible you have to make sure berries are not too moist.

3.2.16 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/231981/blueberry-oatmeal-cookies/ ... 'Doubled the recipe.  These seemed too creamy so I added an extra half cup oats.  Instead of individual cookies, I put them in a rimmed baking sheet.  Baked about 25 mins.  'Pretty sure this is a snack cake that should be in a 9x9.  They're fine.  Just not what I'd consider a cookie.  I subbed with fresh berries, same amount.  'Think adding dried cranberries & nuts with the fresh berries would improve it.  'Still a cake, but more healthy.  Son, 18, said they taste like a cereal bar.  'Guess they do.  :)  'Could bar cookie then & sandwich pb between for a good summer snack.

These cookies were yummy! I was looking for a recipes to use up some fresh blueberries, so I substituted a cup of fresh blueberries for the dried. My daughter helped me make them and was apprehensive about blueberries in her cookies, but turned out that she loved them!

With a few tweaks this recipe comes out really well.
1. Add an extra 3/4 cup of oats (almost double).
2. Substitute a couple tablespoons of maple syrup for the white sugar or just leave out the white sugar entirely.
3. Add dry cranberries to taste
4. Use frozen blueberries instead of dried.
