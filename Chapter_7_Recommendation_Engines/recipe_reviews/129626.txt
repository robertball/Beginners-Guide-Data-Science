This was a fun dessert for my son and I to make together. I didn't have double strength coffee, so I added a tbsp. of instant coffee granules to my usual drip coffee. Very simple, my oldest did the majority of this by himself. We didn't have a pretty trifle dish so we layered the ingredients in a see-thru glass baking dish. Good stuff.
