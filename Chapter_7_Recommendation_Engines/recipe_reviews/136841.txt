It was great, but heavy.  I used asparagus - big, chunky asparagus.  They held up well.  I also covered it with tin foil for the first 1/2 hour to keep it moist and help it to puff up.

I can't imagine eating this or breakfast, but it makes a great brunch dish.  I used sweet onion, finely diced in place of the green onions because that is what I had on hand.  The dish looked a bit bland to me so I sprinkled a bit of sweet paprika over the top before baking.  In the future I will add celery seed,  cayenne, or possibly Old Bay because it is rather tame although rich.  Thanks for a new way to use crabmeat.  5/19/13 Update:  After refrigerating leftovers for 24 hrs after baking and finding them far more flavorful than yesterday I believe this should be assembled and refrigerated the day before it is to be used.  I do wish I had done so.

Used leftover fresh crab (didn't know that was possible) and it was Indescribably Delicious!  I would make this dish for a very special brunch.  Very elegant, scrumptious and easy to make.  10 Stars!  I'd add a photo, but it was gone before I could take a picture!

This was really good, I substituted the Sherry for Apple Juice and added another can of crab. Next time I will increase it 4 cans.
