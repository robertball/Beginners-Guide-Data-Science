This is very good lasagna. Its quick to put together,and my family devoured it. I used no cook lasagna noodles,and added egg to the ricotta cheese to hold it together a little more,and it turned out well. Also,I added some seasonings to the ricotta cheese mixture. Its not restaurant quality lasagna,but for a week night supper,it suits me fine :)

This is very similar to the Lasagna I regularly make. I do add an egg to the cheese mixture to hold it together, I make 3 layers and I use a 45 oz jar of sauce or it tends to be rather dry. I always precook the noodles as I've had random crunchy bits and corners in the past. Precooking them also allows me to add salt to the water which I'm a firm believer in the flavor boost from that.

I have never cooked a lasagna noodle in my life ~ as long as you make sure you have plenty of sauce your lasagna will come out perfect. The key is to start with sauce on the bottom. As far as this recipe goes ~~~ I have had much better

I love lasagna, but hate the length of time it takes to prepare. This recipe totally fixes that! I enjoyed the flavor, and when paired with a salad, and garlic bread this becomes a really good meal. I found I didn't have to do anything to my noodles in order to get them to behave and not be crispy, they absorbed the extra juice while cooking so it wasnt sloppy to serve. Ive also made this at least 5 times since I saved it a few months ago, so its gotta be good!!!

Followed other's suggestions (soaking noodles in hot water, adding extra sauce & italian seasoning) & I thought it turned out great!!  Husband said it had too much "not sauce" which I think means too much ricotta etc, so next time I make it I will not use the whole carton of ricotta, & I might add some beef. I loved it, so easy

I will give this a five, though the flavor isn't outstanding - its good, but not great.  What it earned a five for was ease!  I will never again say that lasagna is too hard to make.  This was really easy - thank you from a busy mom!!

Followed this recipe as stated except I used gluten free noodles.  Was excited to see that there was an egg-free lasagna recipe that was pretty straight forward for a busy night's supper.

BEST EVER--However, I added mild italian turkey sausage (3 links) to the lasagna, frying it up first in olive oil until just about cooked.  Also, soaked the lasagna noodles about 10 minutes in hot water before using.  Sprinkled just a touch of italian seasoning to the top, although I don't think it needed it or made a difference.  I cooked this in a 5th wheel oven, so not sure if that makes a difference (it's small!) and cooked at 350 for about half an hour.  Ate some after about 10 minutes of cooling in oven and was PERFECT!!!  I put it back in on 350 to keep it warm and it burned the top and now it's not perfect.  :(

This is excellent! I used 2 whole jars of sauce, but other than that I didn't change a thing- my family devoured it with some garlic bread! This was only my second lasagna- the first time I made lasagna it came out crunchy, this one though- PERFECT! I will make it again :)

This is a good recipe with fast preparation time. I had a lot of fresh tomatoes on hand so I spent the 10 minutes needed to make fresh tomato sauce. I also used 9 lasagna noodles and doubled the other ingredients. My version of this recipe had 3 layers.

I only had a 13 by 9 in pan, so of course I needed a lot more sauce and noodles. Other than that I discovered that tomato paste can be used if you run out of prego and a little fresh parmesan goes great with the mozzarella on top. Prehaps add a little basil to the ricotta cheese, it was a little bland. I will make this again.

I've been making this recipe as is for at least 9 years.  My pan is the perfect size (11 x 7), I've always used regular lasagna noodles, and they always turn our perfect to the edges without pre-cooking.  The only thing I changed is to use Hunts Meat Sauce instead of the Prego.  Its delicious!

Wow, was this easy!!!  I did some alterations that others suggested, like pre-soaking the noodles, adding an egg and some spiced to the ricotta mixture, some ground beef and spinach.  Super fast to put together, not a big mess and very good!!

I love this recipe.  It is quick and easy.  I use wheat noodles which takes a little longer to cook, but I think it is a healthy choice.  I also added mushrooms and parsley because I love them both.

Five stars for the ease.  I used an Italian sausage meat sauce to add a bit of meat.  Also, I used an 8"x8" pan and stacked 3 layers instead of two.  The baking time was the same.

This is a good start but I had to make an adjustment and add some meat and season the meat with Garlic powder, Italian seasoning, basil and brown some onions in with it.

This recipe shaved hours off my usual lasagna recipe and now there is no going back! I did soak my noodles about 15 minutes but simply making sure they are covered in sauce should do it! I did add a few things to the sauce.. A small can of beef crumbles (how did I live without that??), a tsp minced prepared garlic from the fridge and some fresh chopped basil from the herb garden. Yum! Even my picky eaters loved it as much as my original. A keeper!

Tried the recipe exactly as given first. Turned out very good. noodles were very tender. You just have to make sure they'er completely covered in sauce. Every time since and I have made it several times. I used 40 oz's of sauce, n added 14 oz vegetarian meat, and I sprinkled sliced black olives, fresh tomato, n green onion on the top layer of mozzarella cheese, and my family loves it.

Great recipe. I made a few changes as I read through though:

I added garlic salt and Italian seasoning along with egg to the cheese mixture.

I seasoned 1lb meat with salt, pepper, and garlic salt to the pasta sauce.

I used 9 lasagna noodles instead of six.
These were my layers:

Layer 1: pasta mixture
Layer 2: lasagna noodle 
Layer 3: cheese mixture topped with mozzarella and sprinkled with parm cheese.
Layer 4: lasagna noodle 
Layer 5: pasta mixture
Layer 6: lasagna noodle
Topped with light pasta sauce and cheese!!!

You have to make sure that all the pasta is covered by the sauce or you will have dry lasagna.

This is my basic lasagna recipe... sometimes made with my own meat sauce, if I have it on hand, so I get plenty of Italian sausage into it. Sometimes, I use a pouch of pre-shredded cheese for convenience. Often, I add spinach as per the very similar http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Extra-Easy-Spinach-Lasagna/Detail.aspx. A layer of sun-dried tomatoes is a special treat. I don't know anyone(!) who parboils lasagna noodles anymore; it's messy and altogether un-necessary.

Nothing to rave about. I think i will use my homemade marinara next time and bulk it up with carrots and peas and meat.

It was a good start but defintely needs a little tweaking. Soak or pre boil noodles, add some meat to it. Less ricotta, more mozz. But overall, good taste and was easy.

I chose this recipe more for the method than the ingredients.  I soaked the noodles for 15 minutes as suggested and they weren't done enough IMHO.  Also not much flavor but I think this can be pumped up easily.  I plan to try it again with some small Italian meatballs and and boiling the noodles before hand.  Otherwise it was sure easy and smelled good while it was cooking.
