I thought this was pretty good but I doctored it up quite a bit. Instead of just peas I added mixed veggies that included carrots, green beans, corn and peas. I also added a few more spices including onion powder, extra garlic powder and some crushed red pepper. Then on top of the potatoes I whipped up a mini batch of the egg mixture not including the veggies and put it on top of the potatoes to make it a thicker casserole. It turned out pretty good! I learned that I'm not a huge Thyme person, but that's just personal preference.

Neither of us cared much for this. Very bland. Thanks, though.

I made it to the recipe, except that I used regular cheddar cheese, and used a bit more than in the recipe. I cooked it in little individual baking dishes and served it as a side dish, then sprinkled with green onion before serving. The kids loved it.
