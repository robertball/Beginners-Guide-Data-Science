Well - this was a pretty no frills recipe but it's a perfectly good base to start with.

I sauteed 2 cloves of garlic and 2 medium sized shallots in some butter to start. Then I added the kraut (I used uncooked "Bubbies" brand), brown sugar, diced apples (I only used 1 large apple to 1lb Kielbasa -- I'm not nuts over apples), a half cup of raisins, and half bottle of amber beer. Let it simmer for about 10 mins with the lid off so the liquid would reduce. I sliced and browned the Kielbasa separately and then tossed it in with the kraut along with a teaspoon of caraway seeds and a half teaspoon of nutmeg. Let it cook for about 5-7 mins more and serve with some honey mustard on the side.

Deee-lish.

This dish is delicious!  I followed other’s recommendations and used only 4 apples and it tasted great!  The sauerkraut is tart and the apples sweet – so it is almost similar to a sweet-n-sour flavor.  I thought it would be good – because I like all the ingredients – but it was really delicious.  Great blends of flavor!

Hubby loves kraut and kielbasa as long as the meat is from the German butcher and not the grocery store. I used applesauce instead of the apples and added some caraway seeds and sauteed onions. Thanks Lori!

I cut this recipe in half and only used one package of kielbasa. However I first sauteed a sliced onion and only one apple. Then I added a 10oz can of sauerkraut the kielbasa and an 1/8 cup of brown sugar. This is a pretty good recipe and I would definitely make it again but next time I would cut the kielbasa to fit into a bun and added the sauerkraut mixture to it. Thanks!

I just made this for my German wife on Valentine's day and it was really good! I used Empire apples. The apples seemed to take the tartness away from the sourkraut. Easy to make.

Keilbasa is one of my favorite foods, but sadly I found this recipe to be only "so-so"...this may be because I added too much brown sugar? A visiting friend who doesn't care for keilbasa absolutely LOVED it however. 
It was very sweet, but didn't have much going on besides that. I feel like it needed some kind of bite, maybe a diced onion or pepper? I think I'm going to play with the recipe and try again.

After reading all the reviews and suggestions I too reduced the apples from six to three.  I also used slightly less than 1/4 cup brown sugar.  I took the juice from the kraut and microwaved it enough so to dissolve the sugar.  Then I wrapped all the ingred. in alum. foil and cooked it in my Big Green Egg (smoker) for approx 45 minutes, maintaining a temp. of 325-350 degrees.   It was FABULOUS !!!!   Will make this again and again!!

Tastes just like my mom's! I used our homemade applesauce instead of apples. It was wonderful! Even the kids loved it! We served it over noodles, like my mom always did. Thank you!

I made a few changes... sauteed an onion and two stalks of celery with two large apples, and added two cloves of garlic and a handful of raisins. Cooked all until they were soft.  Added the sauerkraut and sausage, three TBL of brown sugar, and a dash of nutmeg.  Two thumbs up!

I used bratwurst instead of kielbasa, and it turned out great!  The ratio of work put into preparing this versus the end product is amazing.  So little work, so much reward.  I think I'll use a bit less sugar next time, and drain the kraut a bit.  Just a bit too watery and a bit too sweet, but those are very simple mistakes to correct.  Will definitely make this again!

This was delicious with a little tweaking. Like others I added one onion, two large cloves garlic and generous amount of caraway seed. I also only used 4 apples. Yummy!

SO AMAZING! Im actually making this for the second time right now. I use just 1 lb of sausage, either one or 2 cans of kraut and about 3 or 4 apples depending on what I have on hand. My whole family loves it. Makes the kraut sweet.
I take the sausage and sautee' it with a big onion and a tablespoon of butter, then take it and set it aside while I do the apples/kraut. add all together and simmer till my fried potatoes are done :)

I agree with the other reviewers that this is a wonderful base recipe. I followed the other reviewers advice and sauted up one diced vidalia onion and five garlic cloves in butter. I then added them to the sauerkraut along with some raisins, fennel seeds (I didn't have carraway on hand), ground nutmeg, pepper, diced apples (I only used three) and white wine instead of beer.    I fried up both sides of the sliced kielbasa before adding it to the sauerkraut mixture. I also seared chunks of pork in the extra sauerkraut juices and added them. I served it with grainy Djion mustard and it was definitely a hit with my husband and baby daughter.

Made it last night, along with several other authentic German dishes, and it was very good. Super easy to maintain while multi-cooking. The apples set it off! The ONLY thing I may change is cooking the Kielbasa separately just for a few minutes to ensure they are fully cooked, then adding them to the goodness to soak in all that flavor. Very nice.

I'm not a big german food fan to start with so perhapes that is why I didn't like this. But I alloweed my son to eat apples and peanut butter instead and my hubby who will eat anything didn't eat much at all. In short it had a weird sharp taste that was completely not good to me. I like saurkrat and turkey sausage just fine but I did not like the apples or the sugar in it at all. Sorry.

This was very good.  After 4 apples I quit peeling. I thought that was more than enough and it was. This is a very easy meal. The apples help alot in cutting down the sourness of sauerkraut if you're not a fan of it. Will do this again.

i like kraut but sometimes the flavor by itself is overpowering. so when i tried it this was i actually went back for extra kraut. the sweetness actually cut out some of the sour. thanks! i also added a little bit of onion and poppyseeds.

....my husband LOVES it and so did my 15 year old daughter and her friends which was shocking cause she is VERY picky....

will be making this again soon for them....will also be including it in our "oktoberfest" dinner...

it was easy and very flavorful...I am personally not a huge sauerkraut fan so mixed mine with Kaes-Spaetzle and i think that the flavors worked well for me...

thanks!

I was looking for something like a comfort food for the winter and couldn't find exactly what I was looking for.  After reading some of the other reviews, I improvised and put in a lot of additional stuff but the kitchen sink, including ground mustard, celery seed, caraway seeds, some cut up carrots, potatoes, apple cider vinegar & homemade raspberry vinegar.  I didn't have any apples so I used homemade applesauce.  Seasoned to taste with seasoned salt & pepper, and turned out to be what I wanted.

Pretty Darn Good. I have never liked Kielbasa and kraut has never even been eatable until this recipe.  The apples and brown suger really perked it up.  My (German food loving) hubby loved this but said he couldnt consider it without new potatoes. Even the picky kids ate it.  I also only used 3 apples (slided finely) and added some diced new potatoes (2 cans of new potatoes) I also drained the sauer kraut juice and replaced the juice with about a half a can of chicken broth which I think brought the potatoes and the rest of the ingredients together nicely. Very good.

Very easy and simple recipe to make.  I made this for an Oktoberfest gathering and people really liked it.  No leftovers!  I used 4 apples instead of the 6 and I would recommend that 2 1/2 - 3lbs of sausage is used instead of the 2 lbs that the recipe calls for.

I just served this with some rolls but it was hard for me to eat sauerkraut outside of a sandwich.  I would suggest serving it open face on a slice of rye with some melted swiss would be fantastic.

Nice simple recipe.  Made two modifications.  Reduced the amount of brown sugar and added a can of northern beans.

Mmm Mmm Good!  What a great treat on a cold day.  I was a little hesitant at first but it turned out to be fantastic.  My very picky family devoured it within minutes.  Thanks for a great meal!

I really enjoyed this one, and so did my family. I usually buy the 'turkey' version of Kielbasa to save on fat but it was not available so I substituted quality brand 'Chicken & Apple sausage' and I think it may have been even better this way! Very German tasting, yes it was sweet, but that is the style of this dish. My family HATES sauerkraut and they liked this dish. They even said they would like to try it again, and I am happy because I have been wanting to serve some traditional German dishes and sauerkraut was out for all of them, until this recipe!
I did saute an onion with a dab of butter first before adding the sauerkraut & sausage and added dashes of crushed red pepper for a kick, and please use the quality kraut that comes in the bag, not the canned or jar stuff. I served it over Klusky noodles for us & hubby put it over red potatoes. YUMMY!

Surprisingly good mix of flavors.  A little on the sweet side so next time I might reduce the sugar but I will probably make this again! My fiance also really liked it and he doesn't usually like sweeter dishes.

Pretty good but I'm not sure about adding the 6 apples, I think three would be fine.  We liked it but it is a little bland for me, my boyfriend thought it was too sweet.  The good news is that it's a really inexpensive meal, that's what I really like.

Liked it a lot. I too sautéed 2shallots and 2 cloves of garlic In a separate pan in a 1/4 cup of moscato. In another pan I browned all of the sausage. I Drained 1/2 of the sauerkraut liquid before I cooked it. Added all of the sausage, shallots , apples (4) and garlic, and brown sugar in the large pan with the kraut, sautéed for another 10 min. Boiled fettuccine noodles, drained them, then pan seared them in OVOO and butter. Served mixture over noodles, sprinkled celery salt over meal, very good.

This is a really good one-pan recipe that I grew up on. In our family, we add cubes of potato and onion as well (sometimes skipping the apple), and a splash of apple cider vinegar, and the sauerkraut is always the "Bavarian-style" with caraway seeds.

I like sauerkraut and kielbasa and the sourness , but when I make it next time I will not put the brown sugar in or less and I used 3 apples maybe 2 instead. Family ate but no rave reviews and but not bad for a quick meal.

Good and very adaptable.  I followed the recipe and then put it in the crockpot for a party we were having later.   It was  great, and reheated in a frying pan very well too!

This is a great base recipe. I'm not a huge fan of apples, so I only used one (even after I halved the recipe, as it was only me eating this). The brown sugar is a great way to sweeten up the kraut, and adds a great flavor to the dish. I'd make this again because it's extremely simple and fast. Thanks!

Wow, what a wonderful and easy surprise.  Perfect CHEAP working late and need to whip up dinner meal.  The longest thing is the  peeling/chopping of the apples.  The flavor is so sweet and tart (we used 3 granny smith and 1 honeycrisp apple).  My kids (age 9 and 4) ate it w/o complaints, and my husband and I loved it.  Great success.  Did the 4 apples, added some garlic (not necessary) and added caraway seeds.  I was cautious with the caraway (maybe 1/2 tsp) but will definitely add more next time.  Kudos to the chef!

Not a favorite. Just not my thing. Didn't care for the sweet flavor in the sauerkraut. Wasn't sure what to eat it with (sandwich?, potatoes?). Thanks anyway.

I have been making kielbasa with sauteed apples and onions for years so when i saw this recipe, i was excited to try it. I'm sure it's just personal taste but i found the combination of sauerkraut and apples to taste a little weird. My husband liked it more than i did but i will go back to making our kielbasa with apples and onions.

I took the recommendations of many others here and made significant changes - I sauteed a sliced yellow onion and 2 cloves of garlic in butter first, I substituted 2 cups of unsweetened applesauce instead of the apples, I added 1/2 cup raisins, and I threw in some caraway seeds and nutmeg during the final heat-through.  Served the finish dish over noodles with a glass of beer.  It was actually VERY tasty and I found it just a bit on the sweet side, but my partner said it was more sour than he would like, so go figure.  I guess this is one of those were tastes will vary greatly due to the sourness of the kraut.  We did find you could stir some applesauce in to an individual bowl to vary the sourness after preparation.

I made a half recipe which was plenty for my family.  I used 1 Granny Smith & 1 Honey crisp apple.  I cooked it longer, too, probably 25 minutes.  We really enjoyed this recipe and expect to make it again.  I was surprised to discover that sauerkraut is not fermented.

Halved the recipe because I had a 14 oz sausage link.
Made the following adjustments to suit our individual tastes.
Sauteed 2 garlic cloves & 1/4 onion before cooking 1 apple. 
 Emptied the skillet and sliced, browned and drained fat from sausages by blotting between paper towels. 
Put everything in sauce pan along with the undrained  kraut,  1 1/2 teaspoon of brown sugar and 1/8 of a cup of apple juice.

Will definitely make again.

I used the quantities and ingredients for a half-batch.  The end flavor very much depends on the quality of your sauerkraut.  We liked it, but not as much as our recipe that sits all day in the slow cooker doused with 12 ounces of dry hard cider.  But for a meal that's on the table half an hour from walking into the kitchen, it's pretty good.
If you like it tart, make sure to start with a very tart sauerkraut.  
Oh, and I browned the sliced kielbasa in a cast-iron skillet before adding it to this dish, we always like the half-carmelized version of sausage.
Served it over mashed potatoes.

My husband and I loved this dish.  Great comfort food.  Food I grew up on!  I loved the apples in it.  I didn't add the brown sugar.  But I did add about a teaspoon of granulated sugar just to cut the sourness a tad.  Thanks for a great recipe.

My husband and I are not huge sauerkraut fans, however we celebrate German Christmas in Canada and thought I would add this to our menu to try a new variation. Well, no matter how well you disguise it, sauerkraut still has a pungent taste if you're not a huge fan of it. Gave it four stars because although we didn't like the taste, it turned out really well.

Were traditional Hungarian folk, and this was great!  Will cook again!
