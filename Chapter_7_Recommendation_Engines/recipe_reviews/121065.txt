While I prepared this with the ingredients as listed, using olive oil, it is the WAY I cooked it, I believe, that made this a 5-star dish. Rather than enclosing it in foil, which surely would have "stewed" the vegetables, I put them in a shallow baking dish and roasted them at 425 degrees, for about 20 minutes, until crisp tender. The olives were a tasty addition, the seasoning was right on, and my roasting method gave this dish a beautiful color and texture.

Great combination of flavors! I used cherry tomatoes and olive oil. I also used minced garlic and a bit of salt vs. garlic salt. Instead of making a foil packet, I used a foil pan sprayed with a bit of Pam to prevent sticking and roasted this on the grill. Simple and delicious!

Very tasty, great combination of flavors. Instead of using a foil pouch, I put these on the grill in a disposable foil pan. I spread the veggies out in a single layer in the pan and they cooked very nicely, without the "stewing" that others mentioned. Only other change I made was to add some garlic. Very good, thank you. :)

This recipe was refreshing.  I have been cooking and collecting recipes for over 50years and also have cookbooks dating back over 125 years. I also love ethnic cooking as I am half Italain and half Polish and raised Greek!! I truly love authentic Greek  & Italian recipes My Greek step-dad was a wonderful cook . What I have learned is to basically read  thru a recipe if it sounds good and always adjust things to your taste. You get what you put into it ...

This sounded really good, but I didn't have some of the ingredients on hand so I improvised. Per prior suggestions, I chunky cut the zucchini and did not enclose it in foil on the grill. I used olive oil instead of canola, didn't have as many olives as the recipe called for and used red onion instead of green. Everything else was as directed. VERY good!! We put the finished product over a bit of cooked pasta and it was a wonderful side dish. I bet feta cheese would be a good substitute for the parm cheese. Will make again!

After reading reviews, roasted it on rimmed cookie sheet to prevent stewing the veggies.  The flavor was great but, in in waiting for the veggies to brown up, they did get a bit too soft for my taste.  I'd recommend a chunky cut on the zucchini to keep some of the firmness.

I'm sure this recipe is pleasantly mild in flavor as promised, but I aimed to make it bursting with flavor. I upped the olive oil and lemon juice slightly, and went with a half sprig of fresh rosemary and 2 tsp of greek herb seasoning medley along with the oregano called for, but leaving out the garlic salt and using 3 cloves of fresh garlic instead. Followed the grilling instructions which were perfect and the sprinkle of fresh parmesan was a nice finishing touch. Fantastic.

This was very, very good! I used 1/4 Vidalia onion and two cloves of garlic, minced. This was easy to make, took very little prep time and tasted delicious! I will be coming back to this one again and again. Thank you, Betty Washburn for this submission.

This was awesome and I'm not a big zucchini fan. I did as suggested and cut my zucchini into chunks and thick slices. I added additional seasonings including Italian and Greek seasoning, fesh garlic, butter and kosher salt.  I placed in aluminum foil but kept the foil open during the cooking. I placed the foil in a vegetable steamer and then placed the steamer on the grill. The zucchini remained crunchy!!  Will add this to the regular rotation.

This turned out bland and boring for me.  I purposely added lots of fresh crushed garlic, fresh oregano and parsley so it wouldn't.  With all the other ingredients (I didn't leave anything out) I was sure it would be full of flavors as reviewed by many.  I also spread it out on a large baking sheet to prevent "stewing".  It was edible but nothing I would try again.  My search for a zucchini/squash side dish that wows me continues...

This is delicious! I baked, but had a ditzy moment and used a smaller pan so the zucchini did not get crisp since everything was piled up. Still, in my opinion it came out like the perfect veggie saute that i have never been able to perfect! I followed other suggestions and used 1 minced garlic clove plus salt instead of garlic salt. I used kalamata olives and grape tomatoes, seeds and all. As I write this I am enjoying leftovers at work, it held up well! I love recipes like this because they are so easily tweaked to personal taste. Next time I am going to toss some feta on for the last few mins, just enough to warm it, and hopefully that will be tasty too!

this was OK - but I admittedly did not add the olives - would that have changed my rating? maybe.  That said, I would add more spices as it was too bland for me.

Yummy! I added chopped fresh basil before serving.  I think this would be great with feta cheese, too!  I used kalamata olives instead of just the plain ripe olives.  Simple but delicious!

10-3-11:  This has a very pleasant blend of tastes.  Made it under a broiler, cooked it a little longer than indicated in the recipe.

We really enjoyed this recipe a lot. A great way to use zucchini that has a little Italian flavor. Very easy to do and pretty quick. Great paired with some pasta and garlic bread. Thank you for this recipe, Betty!

I have made a similar grill many times but the seasonings in this grill were superb.  I used zucchini along with pepper and summer squash.  The use of tomato was good, you could also use red pepper both give a wonder color to the grill.

My zucchini hating kids give this 5 stars. Our whole family loved it. I did use olive oil and I may have added a bit of extra parmesan, but it was a big hit. Will make again - often!

This was really good. We ended up with allot of veggies so we put it in a foil pan and put it on the grill. We ran out of room on the grill (found out the back wasn't working) so we finished it up in the oven. Everyone loved it. Even the boys that do not usually eat veggies. I will Definitely make this again.

This was a big hit at my Labor day weekend BBQ.  Instead of cooking it on the grill, I just layed out the veggies on a cookie sheet and put it in the broiler.  That was just because the grill was too full of other things.  But fantastic taste and it looked beautiful and everyone commented on it.  BTW I served it with Feta cheese on the side instead of Parmesan.

This was great!!! It was just a little too bland... maybe add more lemon juice or something else to spice it up a bit.

I sliced my zucchinis horizontally. I omitted the olives and used tomato from a can.  I had it in the oven 9x13 metal pan at 350 for 30 minutes.  It was a yummy way to serve this vegetable.  addition 8/11 I've added Italian spice and garlic. Also tried grilling at 425 for 15 minutes. It doesn't take long to brown, but note it is on the underside slice. Time carefully before it gets too soft!

I only had two zucchinis, but I didn't half any of the other ingredients.  It still lacked flavor.  I will try it again, but will probably add more spices.  I also didn't put in the olives because I don't like them, or the onions because I didn't have any.
