The idea of the recipe was great, but the result wasn't so much.  The sauce was very liquidy and lacked a substantial flavor; peaches and pork aren't the greatest partners.  With all of the ingredients, it tasted in the end just like a simple meal of pork chops and peachsauce (like applesauce)!  Plus, the temperature wasn't high enough for my pork roast and it took 2x the time to cook.  Thanks for the recipe, but I won't use it again.

This had almost TOO MUCH flavor!!  The rub and the glaze did not "meld" very well together AT ALL, although they WERE tasty by themselves--so I would recommend doing one or the other (just the rub or just the glaze, but not both).  It was OK, but I'll try a different recipe next time . . .

I have made this recipe 3 times--twice with pork chops and once with a pork loin. Each time it has been excellent! The last time I made it with the pork loin for several friends and they raved about it! Very Simple!!

This was a very simple recipe. I used a five pound roast and extended the cooking time. The result was a very tender, very flavorful roast. I presented it with spiced peaches as an accompaniment, and everyone loved it. I will use this one again soon!
