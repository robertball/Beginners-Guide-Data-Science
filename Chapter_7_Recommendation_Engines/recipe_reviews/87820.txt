WOW!!!!! you would never know you were eating tofu.....I used silken tofu and rice milk. I baked it for 15 min. @ 325 just to bake off some moisture and it was great.I was worried that the spinach would be bitter so I added a pinch of stevia and that was the ticket ! It was perfect. I work in a Wellness clinic and I can't wait to take it to my vegetarian friends...Thank you so much.!!!!! 
UPDATE....NEWS FLASH,,,, Just wanted you to know...Now I use this as a pizza base instead of a red sauce..Oh my! topped with fresh vege's it's the best vegetarian pizza( add meat if ya want)I'll keep ya up to date if I have any more brain storms....

Some reviewers commented on the bitterness of this dish. The way to reduce bitterness is to include the stem of the spinach in your dish (many people cut it out). The variety is also important, for mixes, I like the Bloomsdale Long-Standing variety of spinach. As you saute, add a tsp. of sugar and a scant tablespoon of lemon juice. Make sure you are cooking it long enough- the recipe says until just wilted, but you want to cook it much longer - 15 to 20 minutes, and keep adding liquid as it dries out.

Great flavor, good texture, and very healthy. I halved it and used 1 bunch fresh spinach, 1/2 onion, 1 clove garlic, 1/3 c milk, 1/2 pkg soft tofu, 1/3 nutritional yeast (rather than cheese), generous amount of onion and garlic powder to taste, and pinch of pepper (left out the butter and only used canola). Cheesy taste, creamy texture, very flavorful. Very good for vegetarians and vegans (substitute soy milk).

What a creative recipe! This was excellent. My husband and I (and EVERYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD) love creamed spinach, but I always feel so guilty stirring in all that butter and cream!!  I was looking for something to make with our leftover spinach and tofu, and this recipe was the golden ticket.  I used only olive oil (no butter), fresh spinach, fresh crimini mushrooms, firm tofu, onion, 1% milk, a grated parmesan and  mexican cheese mix (b/c I ran out of parmesan), lots of minced garlic (6 cloves), 1/2 tsp salt, 1/8 tsp black pepper, 1/8 tsp grated nutmeg (b/c I think that's a classic ingredient in traditional creamed spinach).  A tip is to drain the spinach mixture before combining with the tofu mixture.  There's a lot of water that gets cooked out of mushrooms and spinach, and it could make your creamed spinach too liquidy.  This is a fantastic recipe.  Beautifully creamy and flavorful.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!!

Very yummy.  A great way to get your protein and veggies in one delicious dish.  I substituted 3 - 10oz packages of spinach for the fresh because I'm lazy!  I only put 1/3 cup of cheese and added a little nutmeg to taste.

Great recipe! It's a filling, delish dinner when tossed with pasta, and would probably be a great filling for a lasagna. Next time I'll probably add tomatoes or mushrooms too

This didn't come close to being "creamed".  I mean, it wasn't creamy at all.  'Kind of turned out like - uh - um- I don't know what, but there was no creaminess to it.  No sauce.  Easily eaten with a fork.  Also, I couldn't get mine to blend/puree.  I kept stirring it "up," but it really didn't work.  At first, I thought I'd made a mistake.  Wrong amount of milk or type of tofu, but that wasn't it.  Btw, firm tofu really isn't the type to use for sauces.  Go for soft.  Firm keeps it shape for stirfrys or casseroles, even soups.  Tastewise:  Didn't taste bad, but too much mess for one only okay side dish.

Very good.  I used asiago cheese, and I really appreciate the silky texture from the tofu.  Soooooo healthy!  I used frozen spinach because that's what I had on hand, and I blended the garlic along with the tofu, milk, and cheese.  This took no time to finish!

I will definitely make this recipe again. It was so creamy that my brother asked me how much butter or cream was in it. I used the advice of others and put it on top of pizza, but it is also delicious with pita chips.

Very good. I really had to improvise. I used a pkg of chopped frozen spinach, blue cheese, along with the parmesan and took the suggestion of another rating and served it over spaghetti. Very good. That's what I like about this site; you can check out the other reviews and get ideas to add or delete ingredients.

I just made this for dinner and cannot believe how flavorful it was. I made it vegan by using soy milk, using double the olive oil instead of butter and substituting nutritional yeast instead of the cheese. It wasn't incredibly appetizing to look at (especially the mix in the blender) but don't let the appearance fool you. I am lactose intolerant and this is a perfect alternative to the traditional creamed spinach.

This was a wonderful healthy recipe.  I did use 3 packages of frozen spinach and a large onion instead of a small one.  I used firm tofu.  Hope it's as good leftover!  This would definitely be good in a lasagna or some spinach enchiladas.  After I eat part of the leftovers for lunch I will try it in one of those.

This was really good. It has almost the same texture as a ricotta/spinach mixture in the inside of a lasagna or other stuffed pasta. I plan on using it inside a lasagna someday. Thanks for the recipe!!!

I used spring garlic and a green onion.  I bought a bag of cheese that was mixed Parmesan and Asiago.  I didn't have a blender available, so I mashed the tofu mixture with a fork and hand mixer.  This was extremely easy and quick to make and tastes wonderful.  This would be a good introduction to tofu  (or good for those who may not like tofu)

This is really really good, as well as being a snap to make. Nobody else in my house really likes cooked spinach, but my husband  ate a little and said it was good, for spinach. The tofu adds s healthy hit of protein for vegetarians like me, making this  dish even better. The easiest way to add the massive volume of spinach is to do it a couple of handfuls at a time. Once what is in the pan has wilted a bit, then add the next batch until it is all inthe pan. That way you avoid trying to keep it off the top of your stove because it is overflowing the pan. The tofu mixture can be made ahead of time and kept in the blender container, making  this even easier to put together. Had leftovers the next day with a poached egg on top - also delicious! Thanks!

I'm giving this 4 stars but has the potential for 5 stars with a couple of changes.  I made this with the soft, silken tofu rather than firm.  NO ONE knew or cared.  Really good.  If my husband had been paying attention about the Tofu, he wouldn't have even tried it.  It makes a LOT of sauce.  Next time I'll use 4 packages of frozen spinach.  Be sure to drain well.  I used fresh (not worth it), and didn't drain well, so it was too soupy.  A dash of nutmeg.  Very good and healthy.  Just don't let anyone see you with the tofu.  :)

Great alternative to creamed spinach with a lot of cheese.  At first my son was very skeptical to eat this.  But now that he's had it a few dozen times he loves it.

We have creamed spinach very often, using most of the same ingredients, as a quick pasta sauce. This one has about half the calories, fat, and cholesterol of our normal one by using tofu in place of more cheese and cream. My husband couldn't tell that it was tofu. I added some more onion, garlic, and pepper to suit our tastes, but it's a keeper! I think will also experiment with different kinds of cheeses. Thanks for the healthy recipe.

Sooo gooooood.  I served it to my husband and in-laws who probably don't even know what tofu is. :) I ate the rest for lunch today and already have the ingredients back on my shopping list for tomorrow.  I'm going to try it with with the mushrooms next time.  My sister is a vegan and she can easily modify this for her diet.  Thanks!

Excellent way to lower the fat in creamed spinach.   We love creamed spinach but do not make it too much because of the fat.  Now we can can.  And this is waaaaay eaier to make than the high fat version.

This was good. I could still detect the chalkiness of tofu, but what are you going to expect? It's low fat! It was a wonderful use of silken tofu. I used some hot sauce and chili pepper flakes to give it some depth and tossed it with some pasta. Great!

Amazing! Tasty and simple. A great way to use up leftover tofu. I tend to make a quarter of the recipe, which makes just enough for two adults. I took other's suggestions and cook the spinach longer, adding just a touch of sugar and lemon juice. I also add the pinch of nutmeg with the tofu/cheese mixture, and I just blend it together with my hands. I'd like to try it with silken tofu--might be easier to get the creamy texture, rather than lumpy.

I made this last night and I have to say that I am impressed.  I followed what another reviewer suggested and cooked up some fettucini with it (and chicken).  I eat meat and dairy but I like the idea of cutting out some fat by substituting tofu.  This was a winner for me.  Two pounds of spinach is probably too much as a sauce.  Next time I will make it with mushrooms.

Nice flavor but was a little bland until adding the red pepper flakes as the submitter suggested.  We ended up using pita chips whcih really made the spinach come alive with the texture change and the added saltiness.

I was a little scared of this dish because I had never had tofu before. This dish was incredible. I will definitely make it again. I think this tasted better than Boston Market's creamed spinach! Thank you for a great recipe! I can also see this used on pizza or lasagna like some of the other comments had said. Yummy!

I "REALLY" had my doubts about this tasting good but after trying to eat healthier I gave it a try.  OMG, after the first bite I was hooked.  It was amazingly good. Have made it several times now and have added it to my list of regulars. Hint, follow the directions about pureeing the tofu. I just finely chopped it and expected it to melt when heated and I soon learned that tofu doesn't melt.

This is pretty good. I measured everything by eye and by taste. I think I'll use soft tofu time as it's easier to incorporate. Used regular milk, frozen spinach, a large onion and at least 4 cloves of garlic. Going to tweak it a bit so it tastes like mom's, but healthier.

I didn't have enough fresh spinach (I didn't buy spinach in a bag like the recipe called for) so I added Kale and more garlic than the recipe called for (4 or 5, I love garlic), also I didn't have any parmesan cheese so I used Havarti cheese and it was delicious, definitely a recipe I will keep.  Next time I will try to have more of what the recipe calls to be able to enjoy it as it states in the recipe but since I found this recipe after I went grocery shopping so I improvised with what I had on hand. It was still very YUMMY and TASTY.

I wanted to love it, but not the fault of the recipe.  I was probably dreaming when I hoped that combining two foods that I'm not crazy about (spinach and tofu) would result in a love connection.  Good recipe, though.

We weren't sure what to expect with this dish but we had tofu on hand and decided to give it a try. It turned out great and our kids loved it. It is a great lower fat creamed spinach.

A little bland but a great healthful alternative to creamed spinach. I will use a parm/romano mix next time. There is a spinach topped Parmesan chicken recipe on this site that looked good but instead of their creamed spinach, I used this recipe. I also topped it with crushed saltine crackers and baked. The baking took out the extra liquid left after cooking the spinach and the saltines provided a satisfying but low-cal crunch.

The concept of this dish was interesting. I found it a little bit bland.  I added some tamari on top at the end.  Maybe I need to play with this recipe a bit more.

This turned out much more delicious and filling than I anticipated. I used a bit more tofu and a lot less cheese. Coupled with the milk, the tofu+cheese+soy milk mixture produces a thick substance that takes a lot like cream and goes superbly with the spinach.  Next time I'll try adding more milk and possibly some other vegetables to move the dish into the thick soup territory.

This was fantastic! It's hard to tell the difference from the real thing, and it's much healthier! This is a great example of making a healthier version of a comfort food, and it was so simple to make.

This recipe is awesome!  I cut the ingredients in half bc I was cooking for just me, and I didn't have enough fresh spinach on hand.  I didn't use as much cheese as the recipe called for.  It was still absolutely delicious.  I think you'd be able to adjust seasonings, tofu and milk as your like also, and it would still be great.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thank you for posting it!

This is a great recipe IF you like tofu.  I tried it and am not a fan of tofu.  So I will stick to the more fattening type.

I can't believe how good this is and I usually don't like spinach. I only used 1 pound of spinach instead of , because that's all I had. I used silken tofu and just stirred everything together - no need for the blender.  Thanks so much for the recipe.  Kate

This has a lot of potential. I only gave it 4 stars because I had to add a lot more garlic powder and garlic salt for it to have some flavor. As the recipe is, it's bland. I was also having one of those days and forgot to chop my spinach and didn't have enough on hand. So, it came out too saucy and not enough spinach. My husband liked it as is and started eating it with chips, which started me thinking..I ended up adding chopped canned artichokes and putting in a casserole dish. Topped with bread crumbs and more parmesan cheese and baked. It came out really tasty! Sort of like spinach/artichoke dip. I will try it again as creamed spinach and this time chop my spinach and have enough!

A quick, nutritious, and delicious recipe!  I used this as a companion recipe for Eggless Tofu Spinach Quiche (look it up on allrecipes). I had a 19 oz package of tofu, so I used 8 oz for the quiche one night and then the next day use the rest of the tofu for the creamed spinach.  I added a couple mushrooms, and used 20 oz of frozen spinach, but otherwise pretty much followed the recipe.  We ate it on top of baked potatoes done in the microwave for a quick meal.

The importance of following this recipe to the tee is really important - I made the error of not creaming the spinach enough and lumps of tofu is a NO NO!  also - make sure that you use enough garlic/spices because that's what makes this dish.  I'd have to make it again before rating it better.

This was very good. I used frozen spinach and pressed the extra liquid out. I also used green onions and added nutmeg, cayenne, and adobo seasoning. This is going into regular rotation at my house.

My husband and I were on a low calorie diet and this was on of the recipes he picked out. I've never been a fan of Tofu but this was really good! 

Not sure if I would make a lot but every once in a while it's not bad!

I thought this was really bland and just not delicious.  I added olive oil, walnuts and a pinch of nutmeg to try to give it more flavor, but even that didn't save it.

I really enjoyed this recipe and didn't find the spinach to be at all bitter (even the next day)!  I added just a little nutmeg as suggested by a previous reviewer.  Next time I think I will try silken tofu instead of firm--I would have liked it to be just slightly creamier.  All in all, a great recipe that even my non-tofu eating family seemed to enjoy!

This recipe was easy and pretty tasty, I liked that it cut out a lot of the fat. What's nice too is using it for leftovers, I put it on a pizza crust with sliced tomato, basil leaves, and some mozzarella for like 20 minutes at 400 in the oven, and had a nice relatively healthy spinach pizza.

Great spinach recipe. Not heavy like most creamed spinach recipes. I added a little grated cheese on the top, and made it a little spicy with chile powder. Loved it. The leftovers will go in my egg white omelet tomorrow morning!!

This tasted good hot.  However, the bitterness of the fresh spinach really comes out as the dish cools down.  I ate some hot, but when it cooled down to room temp I gagged.  Tip: Eat Hot!

This makes a very credible creamed spinach. Gotta love the nutritional benefits too: excellent protein, lowfat and a friendly calorie count. The difference between it tasting "okay" and "delicious" is in adjusting the seasonings in the sauce after the initial blending. Because I had forgotten to saute fresh garlic with the onions, I ended up rehydrating 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder and then adding this as I warmed the spinach. I also added about the same amount of reconstituted garlic powder to adjust the sauce, before adding it into the spinach.

For the spinach, I used two 10 oz. packages of frozen spinach that I cooked in the microwave and drained well by pressing it in a strainer before adding it to the cooked onions. 

For the cheese, I grated fresh parmesan in our food processor. To avoid getting out the blender too, I used the same food processor workbowl to process the sauce with the S-shaped blade and it pureed just fine.

I reviewed this before for a higher rating, but I think I'm going to have to change it down.  The taste right away was really good.  However, the aftertaste and reheated... not as good. I used low-fat swiss cheese, because that is what I had.  I also added nutmeg.  I love creamed spinach and this gets close to satisfying the craving.

This dish is a staple in our family weekday meals and on our holiday tables. I add extra garlic and onion and have discovered warming in the oven at 325 for fifteen minutes  or on a hot tray for group meals does intensify the flavors and make for a firmer texture. Adults and young people are all shocked to learn that they are enjoying tofu and eating such a healthy dish.  My adult daughter, who struggles with eating vegetables ,loves this dish!

"I can't believe it's not creamed spinach!"
This came out great.  I baked it in a ramekin for a few minutes which made it better, in my opinion, but still good on its own.  Also pairs well with pasta or as a pizza topping.  Use  alternate milk and nutritional yeast for cheese to make this vegan.

I made this last night for the first time. I think that I didn't have enough spinach, because we had WAY too much tofu mixture. Thankfully we really enjoyed the dish so we saved the tofu mixture and will make it again this week! The tofu part tastes very tofu-like, but when mixed with the spinach you can fool yourself into thinking you are eating something more like cream cheese - a great healthy alternative.

Wow! Really yummy spinach dish. The parmesan  cheese gave a nice flavor. I added a jalapeno, cilantro, and a few small sweet peppers. I like my spinach smooth, so used the hand mixer on the spinach and onions to be extra creamy. Planning on serving over jasmine rice tonight. Great, healthy recipe that sneaks in bland tofu... don't even know it's there, but still get the protein, yeah!

OMG, I wish this had 10 stars!!! I love it!!!!! - I edited a little bit the 2nd time around. I put 3 spoonfuls of soy cream cheese (can't have casein). It came out well with that. Might reduce it to 2 spoonfuls though.

This was amazing.  I made it according to the recipe and put it over angel hair with diced tomato.  Such a healthy, filling dinner!

Very good and healthy.  A little watery, but I didn't have enough chesse.  I think maybe I could have cooked it a bit longer, but I liked it.

A little bland for my tastes, even with the extra garlic I tossed in.  Looking at the pictures and judging by many other reviews I thought it would come out a bit creamier.  Mine was a little drippy.  Maybe because I subsituted frozen spinach for fresh?  Still, it made an awesome toping for my healthy mini pizzas!

I followed the recipe closely until the end. I didn't like the consistency after cooking it on the stove top so I baked it. A little too much moisture, and nothing special.

Very very good can't even taste the tofu at all.  Very creamy and yummmmy. Added a bit more garlic and mushrooms. Can't wait to try it on pasta!!!!!

Absolutely delicious.  While I didn't follow the recipe to a T (used about 1.5 times as much collard greens, threw in some mushrooms, added more garlic, halved the cheese, and doubled the silken tofu I was using), the idea was fantastic, and made my dish delicious and different from my typical stir fry.  I think it would make a tasty pasta sauce as well.

I absolutely loved this dish! I had some tofu on hand and was looking for ways to incorporate it into dinner when I stumbled upon this recipe. I didn't have onions, so I left that out. I also threw in some broccoli. Other than that, I followed the recipe and was pleasantly surprised! It turned out great and I will definitely be making this again.

This is really my first attempt at trying to cook with and eat tofu.  I am trying to do this to be healthier, so I appreciate that this recipe is healthy.  The tofu was well hidden.  I agree with some other reviewers that adjusting the seasonings to your taste is key.  I love garlic and onion, so I think next time I will use more of it.  Two cloves of garlic and one small onion wasn't enough for me.  I added one can of small artichoke hearts at the end, and added a little of the juice for some added flavor.  As far as I'm concerned, this makes a really convincing substitute for spinach artichoke dip.  I loved it.  Thanks Libby!

Oh My! This is wonderful!!!

My husband's favorite veggie is spinach. In an effort to reduce meat intake and eat healthier, I tried this recipe. You can't tell there is tofu in this recipe. The only changes I made was to substituted milk with Soy Milk and added 2 tablespoons of Benefiber to increase the fiber. I plan to serve this with angel hair pasta as suggested by other reviewers, but quite frankly, I can eat it as it is right off the spoon!!!!

This was really good...at first I wasn't sure if tofu would mix well with spinach, but was pleasantly surprised.

I made this recipe as instructed, only I doubled the recipe.  It is very, very good but there was way too much sauce compared to the spinach.  Next time I'll try using 3/4 to 1/2 of the tofu mixture and see how it turns out.

Honestly, I  do not get how this recipe could get some such poor reviews. They probably do not know how to cook and improvise! It is sooo delicious! Such a great idea to use tofu, instead of cream. I used fresh mushrooms, half fresh and half frozen spinach, added a splash of red wine... MMM Served as a main vegetarian dish with a side of some rustic multi-grain bread to dip and dunk... Thums way up!
