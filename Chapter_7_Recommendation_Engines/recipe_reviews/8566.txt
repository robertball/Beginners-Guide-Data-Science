We really liked this, although took the advice from the previous reviewer and cut back
on the juice and lemon pepper a bit.  We also boiled the potato slices for about 4 minutes
before we put them in the pan, and they turned out perfectly.  The chicken comes out
very tender, and with a good flavor.  If you want some color on the chicken, you'd better
brush it with a bit of butter after you uncover it, and then bake it for the 10 uncovered minutes.

Ohh I really wanted this to work. I love cilantro and lemon chicken but this was just to much. To much cilantro, to much lemon.  Funny thing is I even halfed everything and still to much.  I soaked the potatoes and they still didn't cook right. I did not care for this recipe.

Took the advice of two reviewers and 1) prepared this on the stovetop and 2) sprinkled Old Bay seasoning on the whole chicken breast prior to browning in a combo of butter and olive oil.  I boiled new red potatoes and added them to the skillet to absorb the flavors of the lemon juice and cilantro.

OMG...This was an absolutely delish recipe....yes we cut the lemon juice down and I added extra cilantro.  I also sprinkled Old Bay over it all instead of using lemon-pepper, and it was so yum...even the kiddos loved it...I recommend this to anyone who loves chicken.

I've tried several recipes before with meat and potatoes in the same dish, and the potatoes are always undercooked unless I cook them prior to putting in the pan with the rest of the ingredients. So that's what I did--I cubed the potatoes instead of slicing, and cooked in microwave about six minutes until they were practically cooked. I then just added to the chicken, coated with the mixture and baked as directed. I like the flavors in this recipe, but they are strong. So if you aren't a big fan of lemon or lemon pepper, I wouldn't try this. To be fair, though, I did marinate my chicken overnight bc it was frozen, so I defrosted it in the lemon cilantro marinade. Also, I think this makes a lot. I scaled down to one serving but only used one chicken breast bc bf is gone this week, and I have enough for leftovers.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this with basmati rice instead of potatoes. I baked the chicken and put some of the lemon juice and half of the cilantro in the rice.  I should have used the entire bunch of cilantro (I halved it due to other comments)and I'll use lime in the future. I really could have used an entire bunch of cilantro in the rice alone, and then another 1/2 a bunch in the marinade. My family eats a LOT of cilantro (3-6 bunches a week), so we can go pretty heavy on the cilantro.

NOT RECOMMENDED!  I was excited to find this dish as I always have Chicken breast in the fridge and had a bunch of cilantro left over from a previous recipie.

I could forgive the potatoes coming out underdone, but the lemon and cilantro did not play well together and combined for an overpowering flavor that none of us were fond of.

I do not recommend this recipe! I prepared it exactly as it was written and the lemon overpowered everything else.  The potatoes were undercooked and the whole thing looked peaked! My family refused to eat and I don't blame them!  Maybe if you brown the chicken first and cut the lemon and cilantro in half ( or more) it might be OK.

We really enjoyed this dish but I gave it only 4 stars as I needed to fiddle with the ingredient amounts.  This last time I used 2 frozen chicken breasts (they were fairly large), 2 potatoes, a generous 1/4 cup of chopped fresh  cilantro, 1/2 cup lemon & lime juice & 1 tsp lemon pepper.  I may make adjustments the next time I make this dish.

I read all of the reviews and cut down on the lemon and cilantro as a result, and I also didn't use the lemon powder. As a result, it actually didn't turn out as flavorful as I wanted it to be. My boyfriend liked it nonetheless, but I wasn't entirely satisfied. I'd like to try this recipe again, but with the original measurements. I also want to try one reviewer's advice of brushing butter on the chicken.

This recipe was waaay to sour for my taste, and the cilantro is a little over powering and I love citrus and cilantro flavors.  Also, the potatoes weren't cooked all the way through.  Chicken was a little dry too.  Not a fan.

I would give this recipe 0 stars if I could.  Maybe I put in too much lemon juice, but it was horrible.  To me, not even edible.  Plus, the other review was right, for some reason, even though I sliced the potatoes less than 1/4 inch thick, they did not cook.  I would look for another dish.

Should've listened to the reviews......
I really like lemony, cilantro recipes but thought this was way to strong, and the flavours did not blend together at all. Also the potatoes took way linger to cook than indicated in the recipe! One star here, sorry.

This is a very "South American" type dish. You either love and crave it or you hate it. Many are thrown off by the cilantro I believe. Myself, I think it is great as is. I love the strong lemon and cilantro taste. If you have a shy palate , I wouldn't recommend. But if you love bold flavorful food, this is for you! Also, I used lime, instead of lemon, and it was also great. Or use both!

Overall it was delicious. I cut down on the lemon juice because of personal preference and cubed the potatoes so they would cook correctly. Overall, it was a good, quick recipe that I’ll be using in the future.

I'm sorry this was too tart for my taste. The lemon was too overbearing. My kids ate it with some veggies on the side but I was praying they didn't get acid reflux.... Thanks for the recipe but I wont be trying it again.

I used the marinade/sauce here for the chicken only since I am trying to cut back on carbs, so I left out the potatoes.  I followed the flavor guidelines exactly, and only changed the cooking method, cooking it in a pan on the stove.  It turned out delicious and my boyfriend who loves cilantro and lemon was very impressed.

I picked this recipe because I had some cilantro that I wanted to use before it went bad.  This recipe also seemed quick and easy. But, I thought it was too much lemon juice and I halved the lemon juice!  Water comes out when you bake chicken. So, it added to the liquid.  The cilantro was fine.  It was okay (My husband liked it).  I added more spices and salt.  I skipped the potatoes.  I would have preferred the chicken skin a bit more crusty.  I might try lime juice (some one else mentioned that) but a very little next time>
