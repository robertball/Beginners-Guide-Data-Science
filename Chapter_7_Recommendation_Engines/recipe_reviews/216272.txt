These were absolutely delish!  A big hit at my dinner party.  I used Fuji apples instead because they are so sweet and juicy.  The best part was they were incredibly easy to make and the presentation is impressive!  I had several requests for the recipe.  Thanks!

This just did not turnout for me. I followed the recipe except I only made 2 instead of 4.  The pastry was done, but the apples were still way too undercooked and the inside portion of the pastry next to the apple was very soggy.  The pastry slipped off and was kind of a mess really.  I really really wanted to like them, but was overall disappointed.
