I made a few easy changes.  I used balsamic vinegar instead of white, omitted the teriyaki sauce, and added garlic.  Was awesome, even my kids loved it and they hate everything.  

A very nice base recipe to work with.

50 / 50 on the vinegar and balsamic vinegar. Good thick sweet sauce. It would be a good base sauce if you wanted to add too it.

The original recipe left out the balsamic vinegar! Sorry...I suggest adding a 1/4 cup of a good quality balsamic (adjust to taste). This is my recipe and I used it on a pork roast. My family and I loved it and hope you do too!

I made this glaze to drizzle over a goat cheese chicken recipe. It was good. I halved the recipe because a little balsamic goes a long way. I am glad I read reviews first or I wouldn't have seen the note about the omitted balsamic.

I wasn t sure if it was supposed to be packed brown sugar or not. A bit sweet for me (used packed) but I really loved it on salmon. Fantastic. Will try again. Thanks
