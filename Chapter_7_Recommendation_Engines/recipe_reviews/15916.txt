THIS WAS GREAT!  I had this for a New Year's Brunch and it was a huge hit!  I "constructed it" two nights before in a crock pot and kept it refrigerated until New Year's morning.  I had the recipe scaled for 12, and omited one of the cans of tomato so it would fit into the crock pot.  It was WONDERFUL!!!  I will be making this again!!!  (Just finished the leftovers tonight!)

THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL AND GREAT TASTING DISH.  I USED 1 BAG OF FROZEN BLACK EYED PEAS.  I ALSO USED LEAN, THICK CUT BACON AND ONCE THE CHOWDER WAS COMPLETED ADDED THE COOKED BACON BACK IN.  A DISH THAT CAN NOT BE FULLY APPRECIATED UNLESS YOU COOK IT A COUPLE OF DAYS AHEAD OF TIME. VERY EASY TO PREPARE.

Pretty good.  I used Chicken broth instead of beef broth and added some pepper to spice it up a bit.  Also, may be better with 2 cans of black-eyed peas instead of 1  because the tomatoes were numerous.

This recipe was wonderful.  Everyone loved it.  I don't normally like black eyed peas but this soup is out of this world.  Thank You!! It also "saved me"-I didn't know what to fix that included black eyed peas!!!

Very tasty soup. I used lean 'weight watchers' bacon, added another cup of celery and then liquidised 3/4 of the soup. Delicious, very filling, non fattening and so healthy!

Not bad. As written, it's a little bit bland, so I added some red pepper flakes, cayenne, and garlic powder. I like the versatility of this recipe - you can have it over rice or noodles, with potatoes, or on its own with some nice crusty bread. Oh, don't make the mistake I did: I made this New Year's Eve, and threw the bacon in with the other ingredients. When we came to eat it New Year's Day, the bacon had lost its lovely crispiness, and was really soggy. Anyway, thanks, Brenda! And Happy New Year all!

I use "Sizzle-Lean" instead of bacon and also puree my tomatoes and add a can of whole kernal corn. Makes an excellent winter soup.

This was good, not great.  It could have used more black eyed peas and bacon in it.

I first made this recipe the day after New Year's in 1999 when I had a bowl full of peas left.  My variation on this recipe is to use one can of Rotel tomatoes and a 14 ounce can of regular diced tomatoes or stewed tomatoes.  Of course being soup, you can anything you desire.  If you don't have Rotel tomatoes, add a small can of green chiles or jalepenos to taste.  Enjoy!

This chowder needed a little help to make it a more subtancial meal for our family.  So I added about 1 pound of peeled shrimp (you can also use grilled shrimp) for added flavor and it made all the difference!   I also doubled the recipe and froze some for later -- it was even better the second time around.

Very tasty.  I was going to make exactly as recipe states but decided to add another can of black eyed peas as stated in other reviews and I am glad I did.

I double this recipe, and it's gobbled up in a hurry.  The first time I made this it was great, but I've added a few things that have people begging for the recipe every time.  It goes as follows:

3 (15.5 oz) cans black eyed peas with liquid
2 (14.5 ounce) cans beef broth + 3 cubes beef bouillon
2 (29 ounce) cans PETITE diced seasoned tomatoes
1 1/2 cup chopped onion
12 oz Pkg Morning Star Crumbles
1 (4 ounce) can diced green chilies
3 TBS Kitchen Bouquet or Gravy Master
1 TBS Chili Powder
1/2 tsp Cayenne Pepper
1/2 tsp Celery Seed

Garlic Croutons
Provolone Cheese
1 to 2 pounds of CRISP crumbled bacon (I use pre-cooked packaged bacon)

1.  In a large pot, combine all ingredients.  Bring to a rolling boil.  Boil 5 minutes stirring frequently.  Reduce heat to low.  Simmer for a half hour or so.
2.  Store in refrigerator over night.
3.  Prior to serving, bring soup to a boil, stirring frequently and reduce heat to low.
4.  Meanwhile, fry bacon and crumble to serve atop soup.
5.  Spoon soup into serving bowls, cover with croutons, top with 1 slice of Provolone, sprinkle with crumbled bacon and microwave just until cheese is melted.

Great basic recipe.  I added an extra can of peas, some garlic powder and black pepper to give a little more flavor.  I also topped with shredded cheese when serving.  Great dish to ring in the New Year!

I thought this dish was very good. I didn't think I would ever be able to make a black eyed pea dish that my picky boyfriend would try.  We both loved  it and keep all the ingredients handy for when we crave this dish!!

This was really good! Due to the severe lack of spices in this recipe I improvised with salt, pepper, Mrs. Dash and a little cayenne. Turned out great. Served it with cornbread.

Amazingly good and simple to fix! We made this to have our lucky blacked eyed peas on new year's day and it's so good we've decided to add it to our regular winter rotation. It's THAT good. Brenda - thanks for a great recipe!

I made this today and it was awesome! The only change I made was added a little more "spice", but would have been wonderful without it. Just personal preference. I did use diced tomatos,because didn't have stewed on hand. Will make this again, even if it's not "New Years".

This is absolutely delicious.  Similar to others, I used chicken broth instead of the beef consomme, two cans of Blackeye Peas and one can of spicy chipotle tomatoes.

I had never eaten black eyed peas before trying this recipe.  I use dried peas and alter the tomatoes to our favored ratio. I also use real bacon bits so that it is EASY and I always have the needed ingredients on hand.   My husband and I make this soup frequently during the winter. Very satisfying!

This is a good simple recipe that does not need much work. As somebody else said, I think two cans of black eyed peas would be better than one. I also seasoned it up a bit with cayenne pepper, chili powder, garlic powder and cooked it with two bay leaves. Usually, I am not the can open/mix everything together person, I was impressed with this recipe.

Excellent recipe. Quick and tasty!! I used red and green peppers, and onions all sliced, not chopped. It makes a colorful and appetizing presentation. Using canned peas, I can have this easy soup/chowder anytime!

5 stars for a good idea.    I cooked a pot of blackeyed peas and hog jowl for New Years Day.  I let the time get away from me, my 5 yr. old granddaughter slept over and I was busy eairlier than usual on the holiday.  I got a late start, They had to be done around noon for the family gathering and the peas and jowl were not, to say the least, very good...The guests were polite and ate some ( the jowl was fried a bit then cooked in the pot a little more.  My bad.)  The bell peppers, diced tomatoes and a bit of fresh fried bacon will give me an opportunity to save the left overs from the compost pile.

More of a soup than a chowder.  Add more beans to make it chunkier and more chowder-like.

This is very good. I made it as written only adding a second can of peas, some cooked rice at the end and 1 tsp of Creole seasoning.  Going to let it sit overnight and then have it for tomorrow's lunch topped with the bacon and maybe even some sliced green onions on top and some corn muffins.

Really easy and really  good!  I didn't need to make any modifications.  This recipe is great to have on hand for new years or even a cold and rainy day.

I used a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes & thought that was plenty. I added some crushed red pepper flakes, crushed bay leaves & I added additional broth. When the soup was done, I added about a 1/2 cup of instant rice & took it off the heat w/ the lid on, until the rice was done. This made it thick & hearty...it was a new year's day gumbo! LOL I used thick-sliced peppery bacon leftover from breakfast & served it w/ split, buttered, toasted biscuits, also leftover from breakfast. It was delicious & very easy ...I couldn't help but be glad that I didn't spend much time in the kitchen on New Year's day. Thansk for the recipe Brenda!

This is a regular in the winter time in our house.  We like using the black-eyed peas w/jalepenos for that little zip and serve with hot corn bread.  The nice thing is that you can use any kind of bean....try black beans...mmmmmmm

I really enjoyed this one.  To make it lower in fat, I used cubed smoked turkey instead of the bacon; as such I used chicken broth in lieu of the beef consomme.  I'm not especially fond of tomatoes so I left them out, yet it still came out yummy.  I served it with rice - not a drop was left over. I'll definitely make this again.

This recipe was a big hit!  I made it for New Year's Eve and served it with cabbage.  Everyone was asking for the recipe.  I used frozen peas, so it took longer to cook, and I had to add more liquid.  It was delicious.  I'll be making this often.

Two things

1.   Great texture...don’t cook vegetables too far...leave tender but stlll a bit of a bite left.     Chowder is a good name.

2,  Those  who don’t like black eyed peas might even like this. The overpowering earthy taste of the peas is diminished somewhat.

Love this! I did do a couple of things different to give it more flavor.  I used diced tomatoes that had a mix of chilies in it. Also to make if fit more for New Years I added can collard greens already seasoned.  Placed all in crockpot the night before on keep it warm while gone. For 6-7 hours. Cut off when got home got up next morning and cooked on high for 3-4 hours. I didn't add bacon til in my bowl!!

I have made this super-easy and delicious soup every New Years Day for many years, sharing it with family and friends.  The first time I ever made it brought the realization that I just don't care for bacon after after it simmers in soup (i.e.,limp and slimey).

So...for the meat, I substitute a 1/2-inch thick ham steak, well-rinsed*, trimmed, and cut into 1-inch cubes.  I still saute the vegetables in bacon drippings, and simmer everything until the ham is done.  
*Cut out the center bone, then rinse the whole steak two or three times with water to remove as much salt as possible.

This is my favorite winter soup, and I have yet to encounter anyone who, once they tasted it, didn't like it--even people who say they don't like blackeyed peas! Oh, and I absolutely agree--can't beat cornbread as an accompaniment.

This recipe gets salt from the canned vegetables, consomme and the bacon or ham, so be sure to taste it before adding any more!

Pretty good.  The only change I made was I added a little garlic when I sauteed the onion and green pepper.  Best after it sits in fridge a day or two...cornbread is a must have with this soup.

I could just about live on this soup. I used left over ham instead of bacon and was out of fresh celery. So I used can Tomatoes with celery, onion in them.  This was very flavorful and hearty.

If I still had my food processor it would have been very easy. The people in my family think they don't like green pepper, onion and even celery so I had to chop them in a very small dice. Took a while. I used uncured bacon, 12 oz., instead of a pound. The flavor is really good and that is before I put the bacon bits on to serve. All in all, an easy recipe for good luck in the new year.

I always make my husband eat black eyed peas on New Years Day for good luck. He hates them, so this year I decided to stop torturing him and find a recipe including black eyed peas that he would enjoy.  This was great!  In addition to the black eyed peas I added a can of kidney beans because I thought it needed some more texture.  I also added garlic and some other spices.  I served this with Waikiki Cornbread - fabulous!

Very good.  I'd give it five stars, but it's my first review, and I want to reserve the 5 star rating.  Following the suggestion of others, I used what I'm sure would be double the amount of peas (I used 1 lb of fresh, which I cooked before adding to the soup).  I called dh in to taste it for me and possibly add seasonings, as the recipe hadn't called for additional salt.  He added some salt and some thyme.  Having tasted it, I think bay leaf would also work, and will try that next time.  Dh and both enjoyed it a great deal, and 2 of the kids did as well.

This was OK.  It had a good basic flavor but I thought could've used something more.  I cut back on the bacon to cut some fat, but I think cutting it out altogether wouldn't hurt.  Though not a favorite, I would probably make again if I had some black-eyed peas or tomatoes to use up.
