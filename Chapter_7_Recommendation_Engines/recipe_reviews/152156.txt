OMG Don't let the name fool you, these are really good.  I followed step 1 and 2 then after taking the meat out of the oven I set the meat aside and took all the left over drippings in a saucepan added 2 cloves of garlic let it cook for about minute added 1/4 cup of balsamic then 3/4 cup of chicken broth let that simmer for about 2 minutes stirred in about 2 tablespoons of cornstarch to thicken the sauce then added the meat to the gravy simmering and turning meat over once.  My side dish was garlic mashed potatoes and stemmed veggies.....I have to cook more next time these were gone so fast....Thanks for this receipe Nelson...wow what a keeper

This recipe is outstanding!  I wanted something different for lamb and this was it.  Very flavorful and very good.  I only wish that I had remembered to take a picture of it.  Also, when I set these to marinade I didn't get a chance to cook it the next day so they marinated for 2 days and were so flavorful but the flavor still didn't overpower the lamb.  It complimented it very well.  Also, if you're cooking the 15 as the recipe calls for, I would increase the amount of marinade so that there is plenty to go over all of it.  I used the recipe as stated for 4 chops and there wasn't much left over.  Thanks for this recipe!

I was leery of using loin chops because I’ve had iffy results with this meat cut, but the lamb turned out very tender and flavorful. Marinating overnight is best, but I’ve also had good results with five hours. We serve it with a robust salad, but if you’re really hungry you’ll want another side. It’s also a great dish for company. I would just note, however, that the cilantro and lime are what really make this recipe Vietnamese. Leaving off those items gives you a great piece of lamb; changing the toppings could easily adapt the dish to another cuisine.

This is one of the best recipes I've ever used for lamb. I think next time I'll leave off the sugar, however. As-is, though, it's still delicious.

Oh. My. Goodness. This was out of this world, and I would agree the best lamb I've ever had. I didn't have lamb chops--only lamb stew meat--so I was worried that it wouldn't work as well. The marinade tenderized it perfectly, and then carmelized it in a beautiful manner. Absolutely delicious! Thank you!

I used this with pork loin chops and LOVED it. I recommend The Q's suggestion with regard to simmering down some chicken broth with the drippings (I didn't bother with the balsamic and cornstarch).  Marinated it over night, roasted, then thinly sliced the pork and simmered in the sauce. I served it over rice noodles, Vietnamese cucumbers, carrots, and a thin bed of lettuce. Very similar to traditional "Bun" or noodle bowl.

This is an amazing recipe. We used pork chops instead of lamb and it turned out really good. We were out of garlic powder and we just used extra cloves of garlic. We cooked it on the stop top instead of grilling it, but used very little oil. We thickened the left over juices and it made a very tasty sauce. We served it with white rice on the side and it was a very good meal

This is one of the best recipes I've found on this site! I love lamb and Vietnamese food so this was a perfect combination. They smell great while they are cooking and taste just as good as they smell. My boyfriend and I add fresh sliced jalapenos to the marinade and roast them on top of the lamb. We cook the chops rare and they come out tender and juicy every time. We have also used this recipe for rack of lamb and it is perfect for that as well.

I marinated the chops for about 8 hours because I didn't want the lamb flavor to be overwhelmed. I roasted them for 30 minutes but 20 would have been ample. They turned out a little dry, but the flavor was amazing. Thanks!

This Vietnames Aromatic Lamb Chops is excellent!! Thanks. I did not have lamb chops, so I used Lamb Scrag which I cut into 1 inch thick chunks. I also did not have time to marinate it as I only discovered this recipe in the same afternoon that I wanted to cook this piece of lamb, so, I only marinated for just about an hour but it still turned out excellent. One of the best lamb dish I have had and will certainly try it again with a longer marinate time.

********
I tried it again today with pork chops and it is also excellent. I pan fried mine for about 7 minutes instead of roasting. Some parts did burnt a little.

While looking for a recipe for Swedish meatball sauce, I came across this recipe again. I should mention that I searched Allrecipes for a lamb chop recipe few weeks back and found this one. My family and I love lamb. I made it then. My very picky family loved it. I made two adjustment. I crushed the garlic and  omitted the sugar. It was still very good. This dish will be made often at our house.

Fantastic!  My husband LOVES lamb... but I do not... so I seldom make it.  But this recipe was really, really good, and even I liked it.  I left the cilantro off my husband's because he doesn't like cilantro at all, but I included the cilantro on mine, and it was very good.  Maybe I will be making lamb a little more often now!

Great recipe! It's simple to prepare and the flavor is outstanding! I didn't have fresh cilantro around so I just sprinkled about 1/4 teaspoon of dried cilantro over the meat before serving and it was delicious. I will definitely be making this again!

It was a good recipe.  That being said, the flavor simply did not appeal to me as much as I had hoped.  However, it is very simple and easy to do.

Family loved it. I ended up mixing the ingredients for the marinade instead of just seasoning the lamb with each individual ingredient; just made more sense to do it that way. And I accidentally ended up doing twice the marinade but with no ill effects. This would probably be good for pork. Only downside is having to marinade overnight, which for us, because we usually only decide on supper that morning/afternoon, is a little problematic.

I tried adapting this recipe for "Vietnamese Aromatic Lamb Chops" for shoulder chops in my slow cooker (brown lamb in frying pan, deglaze pan with other ingredients (omit oil, save lime wedges and cilantro), pour deglaze over lamb in slow cooker, cook on high for 2.5 hours). My experiment failed. My slow cooker results for this recipe tasted nothing like Vietnamese food. I added some "Asian Family" brand "Vietnamese Chili Sauce" (my addition) and the additional lime juice (lime wedges) and cilantro called for in the recipe to "correct" the flavors in what was in fact a very tasty base sauce since my husband was expecting Vietnamese flavors for supper. The end result was excellent. Thank you Nelson_Huynh for sharing your recipe.

These came out so flavorful! I was a bit skeptical about the simple marinade but it was delicious despite only marinating them for 1 hr. I didn't have limes onhand so I omitted that but I had frozen minced lemongrass and I imagine that may have been an even better substitute. My husband who thinks lamb is gamey said he didn't taste it at all with this recipe!

Outstanding good! The lamb chops are so tender and flavorful.  Yes, there is a sweetness to it, but it's balanced very nicely by the spices, garlic, and lime juice.  As with Asian cooking in general, it's that balance of opposites that lends the most delightful results.  I have made it as written, and it's awesome, but I have also tried slight variations; eg. I didn't have fresh cilantro, but I did have fresh parsley and some Thai basil -- that was terrific, too.  Also have tried a dash of Sriracha sauce, which amped it up a notch.   Just love this recipe. Thanks so much for sharing it!

Great with The Q's review:  "Set the meat aside and took all the left over drippings in a saucepan added 2 cloves of garlic let it cook for about minute added 1/4 cup of balsamic then 3/4 cup of chicken broth let that simmer for about 2 minutes stirred in about 2 tablespoons of cornstarch to thicken the sauce then added the meat to the gravy simmering and turning meat over once"

I found that the meat was nice and tender (after marinating overnight) with lots of flavour throughout. Was nice for a change.

Just OK, probably won't make again. The taste was OK, but I guess I'm not a big fan of lamb, especially since it's so expensive.

The overnight marinating is the trick to really successful lamb chops.  Best I've ever had.  I'm allergic to cilantro, so I didn't use that, and I subbed the chili powder for chipotle chili powder.  Absolutely divine.

This recipe was just OK for us.  Guess we are just "purists" about our lamb chops and just prefer the taste of lamb chops on the grill with mint jelly on the side.

[UPDATED] It's very difficult to get lamb chops where  we live, so I used pork chops, using the same ingredients as for the lamb.  I did not change any of the ingredients or add to them as I wanted to know if I'd need to change anything next time.  My husband said, "OMG!  These are fantastic!"  So, needless to say, I use this recipe quite often and have not "tweaked" the ingredients at  all except to make more of the marinade to use as a sauce over rice.  :-)

I used whole spices which I sweat in a dry cast iron pan and then into my cast iron pestle  to grind then to desired size.  I used extra spices as well.  Star Coriandre, Glangal, Va Cap, Vietnamese peppar  corns for added taste.  

My 6 guests raved about the meal !

Delicious!  I reduced the sugar and oil, but kept everything else the same and marinated 4 chops.  The sprinkling of lime juice and cilantro at the end is a must.

Put this together last minute. It came out well and my guests enjoyed it. The marinade could use a little bit more chili powder and should taste better if it was marinated the night before

This dish was yummy! I forgot to prep the night before so I only marinaded them for 4 hours. That was plenty of time! These chops were succulent and flavorful. My hubby LOVES lamb and these held up to his standards! Added to my recipe box so I remember to make these again!

Made rack of lamb for our Gourmet Club and this was a huge success.  The addition I made was adding oyster sauce and a little rosemary.  Definitely marinated overnight.  Yumalicious!

My family and extended family loved this dish.  There wasn't a bit left.  I used pork chops instead of lamb, but it was delicious!

This was delicious and easy.  20 minutes at 400 degrees was the perfect cooking time for pink, juicy lamb.

These lamb chops are delicious. I'm so glad that I found this recipe. Even my roommate, who normally isn't a fan of lamb, loved them. I also followed The Q's suggestion for the gravy and it was an amazing addition to these chops.

I made this for our lunch today and it was a nice change of flavor for our lamb chops.  I added Thai Sweet Chili Sauce to give it a little "pop" of flavor and it was a good choice.  I will use this sauce as one of my fav's from now on.  I served it with Mashed red potatoes and fresh broc.

This was a wonderful marinade that flavoured the lamb nicely but did not overpower the meat. My husband and I enjoyed this with some peas, carrots and parsnips on the side for an easy weeknight dinner.

I would make this again.  It was easy to prepare and would be great for a party, though on the expensive side because of the lamb.  I cooked mine 20 mins and they were on the welldone side, so watch your cooking time depending on your oven.

Prepared according to directions and both my husband and I thought it was very good.  Although I probably had about 1/2 the meat, so that possibly resulted in more marinade.  This does not make a lot of marinade, though I turned them over  at some point to make sure it got on both sides.

I made this dish two times …....the first and the last!    If you want to hide the taste of the delicious lamp chops this is the recipe for you. I marinated the chops overnight …. this was a big mistake  as the flavors totally overpowered the lamb.

Lamb was tender and moist. A little too sweet for me. My wife really enjoyed it. Maybe I'll cut back the sugar next time.  Also like many said the marinade works for about 5 lamb chops. I can't imagine it being enough for 15.

The only thing I changed was I omitted the garlic,but then I omitted it  from every recipe that calls for it.
It really was delicious,if only Lamb was easier to obtain in Ecuador.

This was a great success in my house. Husband and son said that I "knocked it out of the park!" Followed the exact recipe except only had time to marinate around six hours. Also I had a rack of lamb, not chops, so I roasted at 400 for 15 minutes and then turned for 15 more for medium. Served it with mashed potatoes (not very Asian I know - mashed cauliflower would have worked great also) and steamed green beans. I expect to be making this again soon!

Nice recipe, but just what makes this Vietnamese? Cilantro, olive oil, & chili powder (presumably w/ cumin)? Not really - perhaps name it "Borrego Mexicano." Where's the nuoc mam, lemon grass, or any other  Vietnamese ingredient besides garlic, citrus, & black pepper?

Lamb chops were delicious. Was out of regular soy sauce and used a sweet soy from the aisian aisle at the local farmers market which made it that much better. Will make this again and serve with Jasmine rice with a lime zest.

This is a great recipe for people that are not big fans of lamb.  My family is that, and the flavours of the recipe were fantastic.  The gravy idea by the reviewer The Q's also went over well.  I didn't stick to the measures very well (I like to improvise, not measure) and the end result was juicy, succulent and perfect... but it didn't taste like lamb anymore.  That was my problem with it.  I love lamb in all its unique flavours, and this recipe took that away and replaced it with a totally different set of amazing flavours.

This was good, but not exceptional - I did reduce the sugar to 1T, but there was not much zing, as I expected, and the flavors weren't very well melded.

Absolutely wonderful recipe! I only had 4 chops but still made the full amount of marinade, and it was barely enough! Definitely increase the amount of marinade because there is no way it would've been enough for the 15 chops the recipe called for. Doubled the garlic, and reduced the sugar to 1/2 a tablespoon only, and did use brown sugar instead. We only put them in the oven for 15 minutes, then finished under the broiler for 3 minutes. They came out medium, and were great. Definitely reduce the cooking time! The cilantro and lemon before serving is a MUST! Will make again and again.

I've made this recipe several times, only substituted goat chops for the lamb (I think the goat has a milder taste).  I added some crushed red pepper to give it a bit more kick.  While the marinade works fine overnight, a few hours is almost as good in my opinion.  I cook them on my Primo ceramic grill on very high heat.  Delicious!

Absolutely divine....loved it and the smell when cooking made the whole house aromatic, marinated for only 20 minutes but still yummy, imagine doing it overnight.  Will definitely do that next time.

These were absolutely delicious! The smell as they cooked  even brought my teen out of his lair asking "what that enticing delicious aroma"was.  Juicy, flavor packed, did not disappoint! I did add more lime and garlic, and marinated overnight.  This recipe will be making a regular appearance on our dinner table .

Top notch!  The key was marinading overnight (IMO) giving the lamb a nice subtle flavor.  Used lemon juice instead of lime juice; worked fine.  Great recipe!

Very  good. Definitely marinate overnight for a great flavor.  I added more than a pinch of chili pepper.

I made this exactly as is, I assume.  I didn't actually measure, but simply drizzled and approximated.  But I'm sure I got it close.  I was really delicious, my kids loved it and I wouldn't change a thing.

I was disappointed with this because after reading the reviews, I thought it would be great....but it wasnt as tender and yummy as I was expecting.   I will not make again.

This is the best lamb recipe ever. I left out the sugar and used the cheaper loin chop. They are tender and flavorful.

Although I've made many lamb loin chops, I love this new twist and made this for the first time tonight... I think this is my new favorite recipe for the chops. I never would have thought to put chili powder, but WOW, so yummy!

The dish was delicious, even though I did not have the time to marinate. I believe that had I marinated, the dish would be five star. Other than not marinating, I did not have garlic powder so I used garlic salt. But more importantly, I believe the recipe erred in calling for two tablespoons of sugar. I used two teaspns. Also, I mixed the wet ingredients and chopped garlic and spooned over the chops. I then mixed and spooned the dry ingredients over the chops and baked accordingly. Easy and tasty!

I wasn't thrilled with the flavor combination, not sure but I think you can do without the soy.  This is the first time I've tried anything but a little garlic salt and a garnish of mint jelly, and I'll stick with that next time.

I made this recipe for my boyfriend tonight. It was too late to wait til it marinated over night so I just popped it in the oven and he loved it, said it was the best lamb chop he ever had. He loved how the citrus went very well with the lamb and it didn't need the mint jelly that you usually served with lamb so it don't taste so gamy. I had made something else only because I don't like the gamy flavor or mint jelly. The longer you marinate the better flavor it gives. Next time I make this, I'm going to marinate it overnight and make myself a plate. Thanks for sharing.

Total yum! Just grilled these during Super Bowl halftime... the chops had that gorgeous glazed look, sticky on the outside and so tender and juicy and great throughout! Added some sea salt as the chops cooled and they rule! Easy to prepare, I just kept the meat out late this afternoon so it marinated for about 3 hours. Good that we were pretty full cos we'd be fighting over the three left. Top rate, Huynh, thanks for the recipe!

I've never made lamb chops before, nor have I ever served it to my family. These were SO GOOD! Even my eight-year-old son gobbled them up!

I HIGHLY recommend this recipe and to Nelson, thanks for posting it!
