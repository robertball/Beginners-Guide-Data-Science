excellent - with changes. I made it the way it was written the first time but thought there was way too much cream.  The second time I sauteed the onion & garlic in butter, precooked & drained the spinach and added it to the pot and added about 1/4 cup 1/2 & 1/2, a heaping tablespoon of reduced fat cream cheese and about 1/4 cup parmesan and a pinch of freshly grated nutmeg and it was to die for. Rich and creamy...yum!

Excellent! I thought the measurement of '6 slices provolone cheese, shredded' was a little funky so I diced my 6 slices and measured it. Its about 1 1/4 cups, equivalent to shredded, so about the same amount of provolone as cream, in case you are puzzled like me. I made this recipe as written. Yummy, garlicky-cheesy good. Thanks!

All my favorite ingredients - cheese, butter, garlic, cream and on!  This had lots of flavor and was excellent.  I was looking for something to mix with pasta, so it didn't matter that it was a bit thin due to using 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream.  It made quite a nice dish and thickened as it cooled.  I'll do it again... thanks!

Absolutely delicious. A few problems with the recipe though.  #1 problem- 3 bags of spinach is not going to fit even in the biggest skillet. I used a giant pot until it wilted down then I finished the recipe in a deept skillet.  #2 problem --For the beginner in the kitchen (not me) the measurement "6 slices of shredded provolone cheese" was not exactly accurate. How much is a slice? 1oz? Less? Not sure. You can't shred a slice of cheese either. LOL. Cups or ounces would be better or else it gets intimidating for someone to not know how much to actually use or doesn't know how to eyeball yet. If you've made creamed spinach before, not so scary since you know what it looks like while cooking. Otherwise more accurate measurements are better. I used about 9oz cheddar and parm combined.  #3 problem--1  1 and 1/4c of liquid is too much. I used 1c heavy cream 1/4c half n half. The spinach is literally floating (albeit in a yummy cheesy garlicky sauce). I had to add a TBSP of flour to thicken the sauce. I would cut it down to 3/4c or add little by little to see as I go. I tried to squeeze as much water from the spinach but maybe that's why its too liquidy. I should have squeezed harder!  This is a great base recipe to experiment with different cheeses and lower fat liquids and great for low carb dieters.  YUMMM.  Sorry about the critique on the actually recipe but I feel like no one should be afraid to cook and inaccurate recipes can easily scare a beginner.

This was awesome but I just used things I had at home. I used whole milk to make this and only used about a cup. I never have cream so I wanted to make sure it was okay to use just milk. I used 2 cloves of fresh garlic, just a little minced onion,  and salt and pepper to taste in a saucepan on the stove in the milk. I wilted the fresh spinach in the microwave for like 2 1/2 minutes in a steamer. I chopped it up and added it to the milk mixture. I just kept cooking more spinach until it looked like enough. I had a huge bag though so that is why I could just keep doing that. I sprinkled parmesan cheese on the top and it was perfect. Thanks for the starter recipe.

I normally don't like spinach but this was amazing.  The did substitue the cheese.  I found a shredded blend of mozzarella and parmeasen cheese and that work out great.  I also added less onions.  Diffently will make this again.

Great recipe! I should post my own - I made this again, but it was much easier.  Jsut had one bag of spinach, so I sauted some onions and garlic, with the salt & pepper. Tossed in the spinach, let it cook down then added 4 tbl of cream cheese and a splash of heavy whipping cream. Stirred, added in 2 tbl parmesan...let it cook down a few minutes and yum!

Of course I had high hopes for this and thought it would be delicious or I wouldn't have tried it...but I was let down.  I didn't have provolone on hand (Hubs detests it with a passion) but I did have a good Italian Fontina.  Unfortunately it was, "rich, heavy, and creamy."

Love this! This is definitely better than any restaurant brand. With the exception of extra garlic, I followed the recipe exactly.

Great and easy recipe using FRESH spinach. Frozen spinach is not a good substitute for fresh in this type of recipe.

I loved this, but only used 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic, used 2 10 oz frozen spinach and adjusted the cream according.  The cheese gave it even more of a rich taste.

Heck yeah....we loved this.  I even used non fat half-n-half and it still rose to lofty levels of awesomeness.  So much flavor.  Will definitely make this again.  Thank you Bren3205!

Here's how to really simplify and make this recipe lower fat without sacrificing the flavor.  1)Reduce butter to 2 tbsp, max, and can even substitute favorite oil 2)Replace heavy cream with equal amount of milk (any fat content) mixed with 1 tsp cornstarch 3)If using frozen spinach, defrost in microwave in original package(s) instead of in another skillet (seriously, who wants to wash an additional dish?) 4)Consider adding just a tiny dash of nutmeg :)  5)Consider squeezing an additional clove or two of garlic directly into the skillet right before turning off the heat, for a more robust garlicky flavor

This was delicious and comparable to steakhouse spinach.  Used baby spinach, half and half instead of heavy cream.  Did not find it necessary to go through the extra step of shredding the sliced provolone since it melts anyway; just tore it into chunks.  For convenience, made this about 2 hours before dinner; left it on counter and rewarmed in covered casserole in oven for about 20 minutes.  Got many raving reviews.  Many had seconds or third servings!

Oh my, this is DELICIOUS!! I have been a big fan of Boston Market's creamed spinach, but as I have gotten older, it just has not pleased my taste buds as it did before.  I have tried at least 20 different recipes, including my own concoctions, and this is the only one that I LOVE.  It is cheesy, creamy, and oh so perfect.  I did, however, ROUGHLY follow the directions.  I needed to alter the recipe to serve only myself and my daughter (hubby was at work).  I used a 12oz bag of frozen spinach that I cooked and drained COMPLETELY (this makes all the difference for those who said it was too watery).  Then I sauteed the onions and garlic and added the cream.  I also added a heaping spoonful of cream cheese and a pinch of nutmeg before adding the other cheeses.  I did not have provolone so I used Montery Jack and Parmesan and a bit of super sharp aged cheddar; I did not measure but it was probably about what the recipe called for.  This was SO GOOD! Thank you so much for finally satisfying my desires for an awesome creamed spinach.  If it were not for the lack of nutmeg, cream cheese, and sharp cheddar (which it needed) in the recipe, then I would have rated it a five star.

Mmm Mmm good! The only thing I did different was to use only 1 cup cream (which was enough), added 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg, & only used 4 slices of cheese. Turned out GREAT & I would not recommend using anything other than FRESH ingredients. Served 8 people.

Excellent!  Instead of provolone I had a shredded 3 cheese blend of asiago, Parmesan & romano.  Very flavourful - much better than provolone.

So good! My husband said it was his new favorite side dish. If you don't have heavy cream available, I would just suggest adding an equal amount of flour to the butter to make a roux, then add milk or half and half instead of the cream. Turns out just as delicious!

Make sure you squeeze out all the water from the spinach before adding it otherwise this dish will be quite watery.   In addition, I put sprinkled cheese on top of my creamed spinach and bake it in the oven for 10 minutes.

This is soo good..and I am a harsh critic. The only things I changed are, I added more garlic and used a hand grater on fresh garlic and the onion so it melts into the butter and you dont bite into any chunks and I used a shredded blend of cheeses, parm-provolone-asiago and fontina. I brought this to a dinner party and everyone was asking for the recipe. Delish!

Halved the recipe. Used frozen spinach- do make sure to drain it really well with cheesecloth as any excess moisture takes away from this dish. I used shallot instead of onion, and added mushrooms as well as nutmeg. Tasty.

OH-MY-GOSH! The best creamed spinach I have ever made, and I am so NOT a fan of spinach, but I went back for seconds. The recipe seemed to have alot of garlic, but glad I followed to the "T", the end result was perfect-o!

Became a permanent Christmas Eve menu item last year after rave reviews from family and friends.  Adjusted the recipe as necessary per the prior reviews recommendations with excellent results.  Thank you to the original writer and all the other reviewers.  (Crazy me made 6 recipes from gourmet magazine to Martha Stewart and decided this was the winner.)

I made this last nite and it was wonderful!! My 17 yr old even ate it and he doesn't do "healthy". I made it with fat free sour cream and 1% milk instead of heavy cream and turned out great...also added bacon bits :-)

I really liked this! I just used it as a base recipe, since I didn't have all of the correct ingredients on hand. Used many substitutes, and didnt measure anything and it still came out great. Looking forward to making it again when I'm more prepared and I can follow the recipe exactly.

Yummy!  I was hungry for fresh spinach and had the ingredients for this recipe except I had only one bag (6 oz) of spinach.  I scaled down the recipe and had to make it in my electric skillet as my stovetop is out of order.  It turned out wonderfully.  I will be making this again.

Really simple and tasty recipe.  I added more garlic and onion than called for.  I didn't have provolone cheese, so I tossed in a handful of grated Mexican cheese (cheddar, jack, asadero and queso quesadilla) which tasted great.  I would try harder to squeeze out more moisture from the spinach next time so it isn't so runny, otherwise my family was very happy with this dish.

This was great.  I eyeballed everything b/c I only did one bag in case it didn't turn out well but next time I will definitely triple and add a grilled chicken breast and eat for a meal!!

This was delicious. I made with the following changes: I didn't have cream, so I used skim milk with a little cream cheese instead. Also substituted smoked gouda for the provolone.

Yum!  I didn't have provolone so I used mozzarella instead, sauteed the spinach in a dab of olive oil, increased the onion, and used ground white pepper since it is lighter in color and flavor.  Will make this again!

Delicious!  Made it for Thanksgiving and NYE and everyone loved it!  The first time, I did the recipe exactly.  The second time, I subbed half-and-half for the heavy whipping cream since that's what I had.  Not wure what the difference was, btu I think it tasted better the second time.  I got fresh spinach at Costco since it is so much cheaper.  It's a 40oz bag instead of 30 but I used the whole thing just fine.  I might try frozen chopped spinach next time to save time/hassle of cooking and drainign fresh spinach...see if it tastes just as good.  Also, not sure how one goes about grating sliced provolone--I just cut it into thin strips :-)

SO delicious. Reminds me of what you get at boston market. I used mozzarella cheese in place of provolone and only used about 2/3 the cream (acutally used 1/2 and 1/2) that it called for. I was a bit generous with the onion and garlic too. Didn't need any extra seasoning. We'll DEFINITELY make this one again.

Amazing!! My family loves this! I made it twice already. It was very tasty and creamy. I followed the recipe exactly as stated and it turned out great!! The only thing I did differently was used baby spinach and added more garlic to the creamed spinach. We has this with our Prime Rib and it was mouth watering! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Flavor was good, but the texture seemed more like a spinach dip than creamed spinach. Prefer creamed spinach with less cream/cheese, more spinach.

OMG!!!  This was amazing!  I used this as a new recipe for Thanksgiving and it was a huge success.  I used 4 packages of frozen spinach and drained them very well insted of fresh.  I could not make myself buy heavy cream, so I used light cream insted which worked fine.  Also, I used the Kraft 5 italian cheese mixture insted of just provolone which has provolone, asiago, parm, romano, and motz in it.  Lastly I made this the day before and put it in a casserole dish and used a ritz cracker and butter topping on it to make it more of a casserole which worked very well - I baked it at 350 for 20-30 minuntes - basically till I saw it start bubbling.  So not exactly the same, but all of the other ingredients were.  Everyone loved it...even the spinach haters.

This was very good! It was creamy, cheesy and garlicky! What more could you want? I only made half a recipe since I did not want leftovers, and now I wish I had made the full amount. I did add a little nutmeg, which is customary in cream sauces and some fresh ground salt and pepper to taste. I will definitely make this again!

I give this a 3.5 only because I had to do some substitutions, but I also learned a lot about cooking spinach!!! I only used 3/4 cups of Heavy Cream, I added a hefty tablespoon of Philidelphia Cream Cheese, and I only used a HANDFUL of Parmessan and Romano Cheese mixed. It was EXCELLENT, lite and not TOO CHEESEY (For those of you who are trying to watch your intake).  Also, I saw a lot of folks stating on their reviews that the spinach was a bit watery. I put on some gloves, and after straining and mashing the spinach, i also smashed it with my hand against the colander, soooo much more water came out!!! I had no watery issues, just lite, creamy, cheesy, spinach with a bare minimum of water. Other than that, it was a great recipe to go by. Thnaks a lot!!! We love it!!!

I have to admit I didn't exactly follow the recipe but I stuck to all the same ingredients other than switching mozzarella for Parmesan cheese. I used 3 1lb bags of frozen spinach and did probably add some extra seasoning too (onion powder, paprika) but It was a very yummy base recipe and one I'll def be making again. One important thing I want to mention is that I felt no need to drain the spinach (one less step!)... Just let the water cook away in the pot! Thanks for the recipe!

This was AWESOME!  Boyfriend looked questioningly at me when I said we were having creamed spinach with our beer-can chicken.  "Do you even know if I like creamed spinach?!?  Well, I don't!!"  Well, he DID.  He raved that it was better than the dish at the fancy steak house.  I accidentally forgot to add the parmesan cheese, but it was still fantastic.  Thanks for the recipe.

Mmmmm :) I wish I made more of this! It was SOOOO good. I didn't exactly measure my parmesan, and just threw in a 6 oz package of provolone (8 slices). I like a little nutmeg in my Creamed Spinach so I put a little touch of that. Yum yum. I could eat this stuff all day. Serve with some bread to soak up all of that cream.

I love this recipe. Its easy- you can just use what you have on hand. Once you make it once- no need to measure because its very forgiving-and just use whats in the fridge :)  I subbed sour cream and milk for cream sometimes.  We also added bacon. Bacon makes everything better. We were getting tired of our same old side's- we are not spinach lovers... but after this! WE ARE!  My Husband asked for this weekly.

very good spinach.  I made a healthier version with 1 T of heavy cream per each 10 ounce bag of spinach, and 1 slice of cheese.  It was still very good!

Delicious and very, very rich & filling. I did not believe that I really needed all of that spinach until it started to wilt down in the pan.  One other note: most of the bags of spinach in my produce section were not the size called for in the recipe.

I used less cream (probably half the amount called for). I thought with the amount of cheese used it was rich enough. It was delicious!

I made steak with steakhouse sides (this creamed spinach, sautéed mushrooms, twice-baked potatoes) for New Years Eve. It was a heavy meal but Oh-So-Sinfully Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and give this 5 stars. You won’t be disappointed!

Quick, easy, and very tasty!  I made it with homegrown spinach and can't wait until I can get more out of my garden!

Will definitely make again!  Carb-watching hubby was thrilled with this dish, the flavors were wonderful. I made a much smaller batch than this, as I only had 1/2 bag spinach,  but it adjusted easily.  Added extra nutmeg and used Romano cheese as I didn't have provolone. Delish!!!

This was SO good!!! However, I took the EASY road because I didn't leave myself a lot of time for a side dish, nor did I have all the ingredients. Here's how lazy I was...I used onion powder instead of onions, garlic powder instead of actual garlic, Half and half instead of cream, and cream cheese instead of the provolone. It was STILL so good, I can only imagine what it would taste like if I actually used the real ingredients! :)

I always try to follow each recipe to the letter when I first try it.  As I'm handicapped, I can't jump in my car and run to the grocery for an impulse recipe I have to try NOW!!  Very simple - I used frozen spinach, mild cheddar instead of provolone AND a tad of fresh grated nutmeg (I use it in all my greens).  It is SO good!  I ate half of it for my lunch just now, with some wheat crackers.  YUM-M!!

I make this for my daughter all the time but make it a little healthier.  It still ends up being very rich tasting and nobody notices the missing calories.  I use milk, not cream, and throw in a tablespoon of flour to thicken it up a little.  I use a dash of cayenne pepper for a little kick.  Instead of butter, I use Earth Balance or Smart Balance and I ALWAYS use organic baby spinach. Conventional spinach is absolutely loaded with pesticides, more so than other veggies.  It's much better for you with those little tweaks and still sooooo good.

Bren is absolutely correct. This is so much better than any pre-made or store bought.Just served this to my gorgeous husband who doesn't like green stuff. He ate about half of the entire recipe!!  Served with garlic bread and some oven fried chicken. Of course I had no heavy cream but googled the substitute(2/3 c whole milk and 1/3 cup melted butter) REALLY good and easy. Will make this as long as our spinach lasts. thanks for a great dish

This was great! Big hit at Thanksgiving dinner.  As always, I made substitutions....Didn't have fresh so used 2 bags (total 32 oz) of frozen chopped spinach, microwaved and drained.  After adding cream it was still a bit thin so I thickened it by adding 1T butter and sprinkling some flour over it, stirring it and letting it cook to get rid of the raw flour taste.  Also used Jarlsberg (didn't have provolone)and added nutmeg.  Next time (not Thanksgiving) I will use skim milk to be a bit healthier.

This is really delicious, but I would consider adding less cheese because it was just too heavy for me.  It was almost too heavy and felt kind of greasy to me.  I added less cheese and it was perfect.  Instead of adding 6 slices, I would just add them one by one and stopping at your own desired consistency.

Excellent!  I didn't use heavy cream (who needs THAT kind of fat?! lol) but replaced it with evaporated 2% milk and it worked just fine.  Delicious, especially with a nice filet mignon! :)

This is a difficult one to rate. It is a 5 star dip. A 2 star creamed spinach. Served it with prime rib for Christmas. Too,too rich for a side dish. Will make this again and add artichokes and a little red pepper. Might put it on baguette slices and warm in oven a bit.

I followed the recipe, except I used frozen spinach.  I personally thought it was delicious.  I served it for Thanksgiving.  Unfortunately, it was passed over because everyone thought it was a dip, but of course it's not.  It's a side dish.

I did a 3 serving yield with one 10 oz box of frozen spinach, thawed and drained.  I used a milk/butter mixture to make my own heavy cream.  This was awesome and easy to make....thanks!

Delicious taste. I made it using the 5 servings conversion. Only complaint was the amount of heavy cream, which called for 1/2 cup and 2 Tblspn. After making the recipe this way, it turned out to be too much. This may not be the fault of the recipe author, as it was an allrecipes.com conversion.

This was yummy.  I made half the recipe (which still made a lot).  I used fat free half and half (rather than heavy cream) and used a lot less than the recipe called for.  I used a Italian shredded cheese mix (tastes great).  I definitely put too much cheese in (I am a cheese lover, but there is definitely a thing as too much cheese for this recipe).  I added a pinch of nutmeg as well.

I was excited about this recipe because of the high ratings, however I did not care for the texture of this creamed spinach. The flavor was good, but not great. This is one of those recipes that are not worth the fat and calories.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a huge hit.  Very rich and delicious.  Easy to make with the exception of draining the spinach.  You really need to hand squeeze it.

Awesome recipe! I followed it to a tee - except that I felt a little lazy and pre-cooked the spinach in the microwave instead of a skillet. It was delicious!

This is so very good! It made a convert of a friend who didn't like creamed spinach. She couldn't stop eating it. So easy to make it.

This was so easy and quick. The first time I made this, I started with just one cup of cream thinking to let the cheese melt a bit more before adding the rest. However, I didn't feel like it needed it so I left it at the one cup. Even then, after everything was combined there was way too much liquid. Next time I made it I only used 3/4 cup of cream and it came out much better. Both times though, I added two triangles of the Laughing Cow Swiss cheese to make it creamier. Delish! Thanks

I have loved this recipe since the first time I tried it, so much so that I have made some additions that I believe improve on a wonderful recipe. I use 50% more garlic and an entire small white onion. I also add pancetta or thick cut bacon slices and sliced then chopped mushrooms when cooking the onions and garlic. It's so delicious and rich. Fantastic!

I used Mozzarella instead of provolone, but I did think that the heavy cream was way too much.  Mine turned out soupier than I'd liked.  Next time I'll try the provolone and less heavy cream.

Excellent!! I love spinach, but the rest of the bunch usually won't eat it (even creamed that I've made before). I halved the recipe for 4, but wish I wouldn't have. They ate every bite and were looking for more! I did sub good quality sharp cheddar for the provalone (didn't have any). Also added about 2 tblsp. cream cheese and a few dashes of nutmeg following another reviewer's suggestion.

This was delicious!  The dish cooked well, and came out fabulous looking.  So far I've made it three times as a side dish.  The only change I made was to decrease the amount of heavy cream (as I found the amount listed doesn't thicken well, and drowns the dish). Other than that, it's perfect!

I think this will be awesome with tweaks. I agree w/another reviewer 3, 10 ounce bags are pretty intimidating so I only used 2. A stock pot is better suited at least until wilted; but I'll personally use frozen chopped spinach the next time. And even though I cut back the heavy cream there was still this surplus that never absorbed. That being said it was better than another recipe I've tried, and closer to the taste I love at a major restaurant chain. Will try to make again to get the texture down. Husband loved it.

This is very quick and easy, especially good for a change in the weeknight vegetable rotation. I used fresh spinach because I hate frozen and added some freshly-grated nutmeg.

5 stars!  I did modify this by using 6 cheese Italan cheeses already shredded instead of the provolone.  It was delicious!  I brought the dish to a friend's house at Christmas dinner and everyone loved it!

This recipe is exceptional. I'm not typically fond of spinach, but someone in my family is. I thought this sounded interesting, so we tried it with a nice roast and mashed potatoes. This was hands down a huge hit, and I LOVED IT. (The rest of the family raved about it, so I'll be making this again, for sure!)

I followed the recipe except didn't have prov/parm cheese, so I used a Mexican cheese blend, and it was to. die. for. Creamy and rich with a lovely texture from the fresh spinach. I'll definitely be making this many times -- hubs and toddler both scarfed it down.

This is absolutely delicious.  I followed the recipe to the letter in every way except cut back a bit on the garlic.  I didn't want it to overpower the spinach or the essences of the cheese.  Didn't have provolone, so I used shredded Italian blend cheese that you get at the grocery store.  It was perfect!  It reminds me of a spinach dish in Rome.. funny how that memory came flooding back in this dish.  Bellisimo!

Pretty tasty! Made a variation: sauteed onions and garlic while wilting fresh spinach in separate pan. Combined both, added touch of 2% milk, dash of feta cheese, and handful of shredded mozzarella. Creamy, yummy, and probably fewer calories than the original!

Fabulous! Made as directed and it was a big hit. Great flavor! I will probably add less cream next time, as there was a bit too much liquid. Regardless - still a very yummy dish!

I really loved this. I used frozen spinach, half and half, and mozorella instead of provolone because it's what I had on hand. Also, I misread the recipe and mixed it all in a cassarole dish thinking it was supposed to go in the oven. Doh! I just baked at 350 until it got melty and brown on top. This is one of my toddler's favorite ways to eat veggies.

BIG flavor ! Gave the spinach a couple of whirls in the salad spinner to make it drier...worked like a charm.

This was very yummy!  I omitted the onion and povolone and put mozzarella instead.  I also only used 1 cup of cream.  This was awesome.  I served with mashed potatoes and pot roast.  A big winner!

Excellent. Only had 2 slices of Provolone cheese and 1 T Parmesan, so I added 2 ounces of sharp cheddar. I cut the butter back to 1 T and sauted 1/2 onion in the butter before adding the cheese.

This spinach dish was fantastic.  My hubby who will not eat spinach without vinegar on it stated it was delicious and did not need the vinegar.  This is a PLUS for me.  I will definitely make this again and again....

This was outstanding!  I was looking for a recipe close to the Boston Market creamed spinach, this recipe beats it!  My teenage daughter had seconds!  This was wonderful considering she was leary to try it because of the "creamed" part.  I will definitely make this again!!

Delicious. I used half skim milk and half heavy cream and it wasn't as thick as the other reviewers implied. The cheese was actually a wonderful compliment to the spinach.

FINALLY!  A DELICIOUS CREAMED SPINACH RECEIPE!!!  Very flavorful.. not at all bitter---- flavors mingled nicely... not overpowered by one flavor... kids LOVED this!  I really wrung the heck out of the cooked spinach... very important!  Also... I am watching my fat and only added a 1/4 cup of heavy cream... FAB-U-LOUS!

I had leftover frozen (thawed) bagged spinach from another recipe, approximately 9 oz., I used 3 oz. heavy cream, 1 T. Butter, 1 3/4 tsp. Garlic, 1 3/4 tsp. Onion, 6 T. Provolone cheese, 2 T. (heaping) mozzarella cheese. Sauteed the spinach, removed from pan, melted the butter, then sauteed the onions. Following the recipe as written just decreased the portions and bagged, frozen spinach works perfectly. Loved the flavors and the cheese. A definite keeper!

Very simple recipe, but very delicious. I substituted shallots for the onion and added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg. There is a nice, subtle sweetness with the shallots, cream, and butter in this dish.

Made for family Christmas, now its asked for at all holiday get-togethers. Wonderful, flavorful and easy recipe. I make it and put it in a Crock-pot for traveling and serving.  Also, to make it creamier I add 2T. or 1 oz. of cream cheese, it melts in and makes it creamier, not runny.

Thick, creamy, cheesy deliciousness. So easy to make and so delicious.  I’ll def be making this again.  Maybe a double batch to freeze some for later.  I sprinkled a little park on top and broiled it for a few min.  So yummy!

Delicious!  So good and a simple side dish!  I did add a smidgen of nutmeg to the cream sauce.  Mozzarella or Swiss cheeses are good replacements for the provolone if you don't have it.  Thanks for the delicious recipe!

I made this just now, did a little tweaking. Instead of heavy cream I used evaporated milk fat free. Also change the cheese cos I don't have provolone nor parmesan. So I used mozzarella and sharp cheddar. It was bomb! I also added some pepper flakes for a little kick. :P

I make this without the provolone (because I don’t usually have that on hand) & it’s great every time !

This was delicious, but I only gave 4 stars because I felt the amount of cream recommended here was far too much. Like others who made this, I added only about 3/4 cup. That seemed like the right amount to me so the end result wouldn't turn out soupy.  I also cooked my onions and garlic until the garlic started to brown. It added a nice nutty taste to the creamed spinach.  I didn't have the recommended cheese on hand, so I added about 3/4 to 1 cup of grated Mozzarella (I didn't measure this, but rather just tossed in a handful of what seemed like a good amount).  My husband and picky 21 month old daughter loved it, and I agree it turned out wonderfully.  Definitely will make again!

I did not have fresh spinach, so I used frozen, chopped, and it worked just as well.  I thawed it in the microwave, then squeezed out the water.   I liked the parmesan .

This was my first attempt at creamed spinach. I made it exactly as written and it’s a keeper! Very delicious. I did need to add quite a bit of salt to taste at the end, but it’s got great flavor and easy to make.

Good ratings at Thanksgiving.  I used a chopped shallot in place of onion and garlic and sprinkled in some garlic powder. I also did a combo of 1/2 and 1/2 and heavy  cream  and slightly less. Didn't have enough fresh spinach, ugh, just used thawed squeezed frozen spinach. worked out fine. I also used less provolone and more parm.  obviously I never follow the rules.

Great recipe! I used a shredded cheese mixture of Romano and asiago cheese instead of the provolone.   Then I baked it for about 15 minutes.   It was a hit!

Yummy!  Used frozen spinach instead of fresh ones, low fat milk for cream, and mozzarella cheese for provolone since that's all I had in hand.   Still tasted so good!

Yummy!! I would make the “sauce” for this to put over pasta it is that delicious, and I could even put all of it (including the spinach) in a pasta dish. I had to make changes for what I had on hand, sliced Swiss cheese instead of provolone, no onion, sautéed with butter & o.o., and I added a tiny pinch of nutmeg. Since I didn’t have enough fresh garlic, I compensated by shaking in some garlic powder.

This is a great recipe. After draining and squeezing the moisture from spinach I transfer to cutting board for fine chopping. I also substituted 1 block of Boursin garlic and herb cheese for the provolone cheese, it comes out very creamy.

Delicious and quick! I did have to cut the recipe down in size since I only had one 6oz bag of spinach, but it was great!
I will make sure that I will have more fresh spinach on hand in the future.
I didn't have any provolone; I grated sharp white cheddar instead.

Delicious. I made it with a few changes. I read a couple of people say there was too much HWC. I took it down to 1 cup instead of 1-1/4 and then I added 4 oz. of cream cheese. I also had another half bag of spinach in the fridge so I added that in to increase the serving size. The consistency is perfect so I would do that again. I'm bringing it for a side to Thanksgiving. Based on my taste test I expect it to be gobbled up if not by anyone else but ME!

YUMMY!!  I cut back on the cream by 1/4 cup because of the reviews (of it being watery) and I also squeezed the heck out of the spinach to get the water out. Otherwise I followed the recipe.  I don't think the recipe instructions address the size of pan to put it in. I used an oblong 12x9 casserole dish and it fills it to 1/2 the depth.  A 9x13 would be to big.  Anyway... serving for Thanksgiving and I'm sure it will be a hit! Watch the video...Very helpful...

Be sure to drain, drain and drain your spinach a third time because if you don't drain the spinach well, your dish will be too thin.

The recipe called for a little too much onion and garlic for my tastes (though I found other uses for the excess), and I substituted mozzarella for the provolone.  This is better than any fancy steak house.

Good easy recipe. Made only one third of recipe as I only had one bag of spinach. Subbed half and half for heavy cream. Still very good and creamy. Will be making again.

Made at the request of my husband for more creative/ interesting sides, he loved this.  Some of the ingredient amounts seemed off, which is why only 4 of 5.  Too much cream, not enough onion.  

This is one that really needs to be served hot, even while cooling on the plate, the provolone solidified, so had to cut with a knife to eat.  

We'll probably do this one again because it was delicious and easy.

Never cooked or ate spinach before.  Cooked exactly as recipe stated (oops, I used half and half and I think it called for heavy cream?  confusing at times as I read most suggestions) except I had to guestimate reducing the recipe amounts using a 6 ounce bag of spinach.  I was sure my more adventurous son would like it, but not as confidant for myself.  SURPRISE, I really enjoyed it and he requested more the next day.  Next time will cook full amount!

I used feta instead of parmesan cheese and half and half instead of heavy cream both times I made it, and my family loves it.  Even the non-spinach eaters have a small portion.   I cut the recipe in half because that's all the spinach I had on hand and it worked fine.  I'm sure I used more garlic and onions then called for.  I did not strain the cooked spinach. It was a bit runny but still tasted amazing.  I'm so excited to have a spinach recipe my family likes!

Yummy!!  Though I personally prefer a more subtle flavor-- can't really taste the spinach in here at all-- I think it's great for people who don't love to get their veggies in!  ;)    I used a huge pot to wilt the spinach, because I'm too impatient to add it little by little in a skillet.  Also, it was soupier than I expected.  Next time, I'll add just 1/2 cup of cream, and maybe thicken it up with a tbsp flour.

This is definitely a repeat recipe! The only adjustments I made to the recipe was added more cream, onion, and garlic. I add extra garlic and onion in most everything though!

Awesome-tastes SO good & Easy to Make!!  you put that much butter and cheese with anything and it's bound to be great!  The whole family from 1yr/3yr and both adults enjoyed this recipe.  I ate with some bruschetta the next day in addition to topping an 'egg benedict' with it also.  Versatile and delicious!

Made this recipe for my husband's birthday. He loved it. It made a good size portion, and since it is only the two of us now, we have a lot of left overs and these are my ideas on how to use the leftovers, that I would like to share. In the morning we will have Eggs Florentine. I placed two heaping spoons fulls into 2  ramekin, crack a egg in each ramekin, and top with a white cheese. Bake in a 425F for 25-30 minutes . Next later in the week I will use boneless and skinless chicken thighs. First i flatten the thighs a little, pat dry, and spread mixture on top. Then I will roll them up, and tie off with string (or you could a tooth pick equally as well) bake them at 350F for 30 minutes or until done. Hope someone finds theses ideas helpful and delicious.

Loved the flavor! I halved the recipe, it was more cheesy than creamy though.  Still good mind you, but the texture was closer to spindip than creamed spinach.

I added thin slice provolone to the hot spinach and stirred it in until the provolone melted, than added the Parmesan. Heaven to my stomach.

So simple, so delicious. I used two bags of spinach, cut down on the cream (two big spoonfuls) and used only minced garlic as my family is not keen on onions. I did not have provolone, but used 6 Italian cheese with parmesan. It was wonderful. Will definitely make it again. Thank you for sharing!

This is amazing!  Reduced the amount of cream and provolone because I used fresh spinach and wound up with a lot less than I thought I'd have left over after trimming.  It's easy to forget how much it shrinks after cooking.  I bought two bundles which was not enough for four people, with other sides.  This isn't a recipe I would normally make during the week because it's heavy, but it's great to make for guests.

It was really good!  I had to substitute some things as well because I didn't have everything on hand but it was still terrific.  My husband was very complimentary.  I had to use whole milk rather than cream and mozzarella cheese.  I will definitely make this again.

I live alone so make this recipe regularly to use up bunches of Spinach I otherwise use for salad. Using 1/3 of all the ingredients and a slightly depleted bunch of spinach works fine. As other commenters have noted, it is VERY rich, but I quite like that.

This is a great recipe but way too much cream.  I would cut it back by about 1/2 cup.  Tasted great, just used a slotted spoon to drain it a bit before serving.  Will make it again.

Awesome recipe! Instead of Provolone cheese, I used shredded jalapeno cheese... it added a nice little kick.

This is a great recipe. I love creamed spinach. I cooked the spinach first. Let it col and squeezed the liquid out. The dryer the better. 

Chopped the spinach. Chopped the garlic and onion together in a small food processor. Sauté the onion and garlic in a pan. I used half the butter this recipe called for. After 5 minutes turned off the heat and put the spinach back in to the pot. While it was off the heat I put 1 cup of heavy whipping cream. 6 Oz of gruyere cheese, 1/2 cup of fresh grated parmesan, ground black pepper, and 1/2 a tsp of red pepper flakes. 

Here is where I differed. I put everything into a lightly greased ceramic casserole dish and baked in the oven, covered for the first 30 minutes, at 350 degrees. Took it out, stirred and returned to the oven for 20 minutes at 325 uncovered until the top is brown and bubbly. Yum. It could be a dip rewarded the next day with crackers. This is a keeper!!!

This is really delicious. I made the following modifications to the recipe based on personal preference: adding some garlic powder (about 2 tbsp.) and about a tablespoon of cream chees.

We used a bag of spinach and a bag of spinach/ chard/ kale mix. For the cheese from a tub of mixed shredded asiago, fontina, parmesan, and provolone, maybe 1 - 1.5 cup and a little half & half. Used about 1/2 c onion and 3 cloves of garlic. The entire family loved it. Even the SUPER picky kids.  Yum.

I only had one 10oz bag of spinach and cut the recipe in half...so technically I needed another half bag. Maybe a little too saucy because of that but it sure tasted good. Stayed with the recipe except for not having any provolone in the house and used mozzarella instead.. I know, but it was what I had! Was generous with the garlic and the fresh ground pepper and it had an awesome flavor. Will confess my husband likes the green canned parmesan stuff.. you know what I'm talking about and he used some after dishing up his plate.He was in heaven. We had it with ribs and my own take on quinoa patties. Thanks!

I love this recipe. I've made it with kale and it's delicious! You just need to cook the kale a bit longer to make sure it's tender (I add some water and cover for a few minutes while sautéing, but I imagine blanching would work too). Rich and satisfying comfort food!

Made this for a side last night for my boyfriend and I. Only used 10 ounces....and after wilting it, it didn't look like enough. Add a few heaping handfuls of more spinach and followed the recipe exactly. This was sooooo good we didn't even talk to each and just ate!! LOL Will definitely be a staple in my home!!!!

Loved this! I made as written and agree with other reviewers that there is a tad too much cream. It does thicken up a little upon sitting though. I forgot the salt and pepper but feel it was loaded with flavor with the onion and garlicky cream sauce that it really doesn't need it - the salt in the butter must be all it needs. I'll be making this one again!

I cut this recipe by 1/3 which was still plenty for our family of 4 (with 2 small children). I used shredded Italian blend cheese for the provolone and 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream and it turned out great. Before I sauteed the onion, I fried up 3 slices of thinly-sliced bacon until crispy and added that after it was all finished. Delicious! My kids even loved it and asked for more!

This was awesome. I never made cream spinach before. I had about 3.5 lbs of spinach in the fridge that needed to be used. The only thing I didn't follow the recipe was I didn't have provolone but I did have several slices of muenster. That and I never measure when I cook!

I have never eaten cooked spinach. I decided to try this recipe, but didn't have the heavy cream or provolone on hand. Substituted alfredo sauce and it turned our great! My husband loves to let me experiment with food and he really enjoyed it.

Yeech! WAY to much cheese, and I mean WAY WAY too much. The next time I made this I used all the same ingredients and amounts EXCEPT for these changes: 2 Tbs butter, 1 slice provolone, and 1 Tbs parmesan. It turned out really good, and I'll be making it this way from now on.

Yummy.  Put a pinch of red pepper and used at least 1 teaspoon of garlic powder with salt and pepper. I didn't have any cream to I cut up 1/4 of cream cheese package and added it.  Didn't have any cheese but Asiago cheese so I just used what I had.  Next time I will try it with frozed spinach because I usually have that in my frig. Also, when
I can find creamed spinach I just doctor it up a little bit.  Also I sometimes use scissors to cut the spinach smaller.

This was wonderful! it is just different enough from spinach artichoke dip that you can get away with it for a side dish! I also used frozen spinach, added dried minced onions, and covered it in a pan while warming. I also used about a table spoon of Better than Bouillon chicken flavor. I used 3 slices of provolone, and a large handful of shredded mozzarella. Fantastic!

This was really good. I put two dashes of nutmeg in, used only about 3/4 cup of 2% milk and used a mix of cheddar, monterrey jack, parmsan for the cheese as well as boullion granules (about 1/2 tsp of) and the flavor was great.  Coarse black pepper ground over (a few twists) toward the end and it's nice that the spinach is not overcooked.  I used fresh spinach and cut in 1/2 inch strips with knife.

This was good, but a little overpowering with so much garlic and the types of cheeses called for (I suppose this could have been due to the brand I used: Boar's Head...). I even reduced the garlic to only one tablespoon and it was still too strong for us. I would make this again using less garlic and milder cheese, perhaps a bagged white cheese blend instead. I think it would be perfect.

This was delicious!  My kids didn't care for it, but my husband and I loved it!  I only changed the recipe slightly, as per other reviewers' suggestions - I only used 2 T. butter, 1 c. heavy cream, I added a dash of nutmeg, and I used a blend of mozzarella and Parmesan because I didn't have provolone.  I will definitely be making this again!

Simply for the reason of cutting back on calories I used less cream, otherwise followed recipe exactly. This was amazing, I am looking forward to making it again! I have added this to our Easter menu.

This was very easy and delicious.  I made it with 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream, because that's what I had on hand.  I also used havarti cheese, again, because that's what I had on hand.  My husband, who declared he didn't like spinach but would try it to be nice, LOVED it and asked me to make it again within a week.  My 2 year old daughter also loved it--a great way to get kids to eat their spinach!

If I could have given this more stars I would have!!! It was delicious. I made it for 4 servings and used Mozzarella because I didnt have provolone. My hubby loved it. It is going to be really hard for me to order Creamed Spinach at a restaurant again :) Thank you for sharing!

Oh my goodness, this was so darn good.  Super rich, though. My husband is eating it this minute and saying, "This is ridiculous, this is ridiculous".  I made it almost exactly the way the recipe states except I only added 1 cup of cream and left out the extra 1/4 cup.  It just seemed perfect without it.  I also used another reviewer's tip to wilt the spinach in a big pot instead of a skillet.  It was not going to fit in any of my skillets. The best creamed spinach we've ever had. Thank you for this recipe!  I'll be making it for the in-laws for the holidays.

Delicious. I made these for a St. Patrick's day dinner since non eof my guests are crazy about cabbage and this disappeared. My family used to ask me to make creamed corn as a side dish but now they've taken to requesting the spinach instead.

Tthis is the recipe I've spent the last 10 years looking for! Excellent recipe requiring no modifications to improve the flavor!  i might try half and half or just milk to reduce the fat content though.

Tastes awesome! Cut the cream though to 1/2 cup, used cream cheese instead of provolone and skipped the parmesan.

Used whole milk instead of heavy cream and mozzarella instead of provolone (what we had in the house) and it was excellent.   The kids loved it mixed into scrambled eggs for our green eggs & ham breakfast.

I had to fudge the recipe slightly using the ingredients I had on hand, but it still turned out well! I used Swiss and Parmesan cheeses, and subbed a couple of shallots for the onion. It needed a lot of salt and pepper to bring out the flavor, but it turned out really well!

My family loved this! I used Swiss cheese instead of provolone, because I like the mixture of spinach and Swiss cheese. I used about half the amount of liquid and used half-and-half instead of heavy cream. I think you have to gauge the amount of cream by how much spinach there is after it all wilts. Wonderful flavor!

My husband made steaks and wanted some creamed spinach, so I decided to try this recipe.  It was very good and we will be making it again. I used cheddar cheese since I did not have provolone, and it was quite tasty!  It is important to press out as much of the water as you can from the cooked spinach in order for this recipe to be creamier and not too watery.

Yummy, my husband and daughter even loved it and they can't stand spinach.  I used some mozerella and extra parmesan because I had some to get rid of.  Awesome will make again for sure.

This was very good. I made it with dinner last night, and my boyfriend and I both really liked it. I used frozen spinach and squeezed the water from it before cooking it and following the rest of the recipe. It was very cheesy, but I wasn't sure how much provolone to use since I had gotten mine from the deli.

Five stars for me gaining 5 pounds just from eating this!  I served this with a prime rib dinner for Christmas and didn't change a thing.  I just kept watching the yummy ingredients going into it, and thought there is no way this could not taste good.  I hope to try again and make it with healthier options, but what a treat!  I used fresh spinach.  It looked like so much when I was chopping it, but as soon as it goes in the pan and heats up, it shrinks a ton!  Wow, amazing recipe!

This sounded great, but I couldn't see myself eating something so heavy on a regular basis...I made a few substitutions for a healthier version of this and it was still great! I substituted plain soy milk for the heavy cream, veggie shreds (soy cheese) for the provelone.  I kept the parm and butter. Really a great recipe!

I found this to be a good recipe but a little bland. It was missing punch, so at the end I threw in some crumbled blue cheese. It added a little depth to the flavor.

I made this yesterday for Thanksgiving and I have to say it was my Favorite dish on the Table :)  I did make a few changes only because Holiday Budget was catching up with me. I used 3 boxes of frozen Spinach and I used a Italian mix shredded Cheese.  My 8 year old helped me make it since this is so easy. Thank You for the recipe

My 19 year old son wanted to find a spinach recipe similar to the one we had at Bahama Breeze.  This recipe was even better than that one. Since there was only 4 of us we cut the recipe in half but if there had been more we would have eaten it.

This was DELICIOUS! Per other reviewers suggesions, I also cut down on the amount of cream I added based on how much spinach I was using.  It would've been too runny if i added the entire amount.  Loved this recipe and will be making again and again.  I do have to say that this probably isn't the "healthiest" (because of all the cream and cheese) way that I've prepared the spinach, but it is the best tasting.

This is my first time eating or making creamed spinach.  My family adored it!  Actually, my eight year old son ate his before me or my husband finished making our plates.  LOL  They both wanted tortilla chips to use to eat with it.  Excellent recipe!  I would only use 3/4 cup of cream.  I only used a cup; and it still seemed to be a little runny.  Otherwise, perfect!

This was AWESOME! Loved every bite of it. The only thing I would change is to add a bit of nutmeg. Superb recipe. I tried Asiago cheese instead of Parmesan, but either works great.

Simple, easy & delicious.  Used shredded 4 white cheese blend instead of just provolone.  (Asiago, Mozarella, Provolone & Romano) Still used the Parmesean right before serving.  Also used a little extra garlic...in our house everything is better with just a little more garlic.  This dish was a huge hit.  There wasn't a scrap left over & every person took 2nds (if not 3rds).  This will definitely be added to the regularly prepared dishes in our home.

This recipe, exactly as is* (I tend to only use 1/2-3/4 cup cream, pouring in increments) has been one of my go-to recipes for the last seven years...btwn Oct-Feb it is a decadent side that family & friends love/expect me to serve.  I prep everything in advance, so when the rest of the dinner is just about ready I can easily make this dish in just a few minutes. Fresh spinach is definitely key!

Yummy! I love this with chicken. I used frozen spinach and half & half because that's what I had and it came out great. My sister and husband tried it but wouldn't eat it - but neither of them like spinach at all.

Wowee.........exceptional.  Will never understand people who do not fix recipe as stated and then rate it.  How can that you rate it if you don't fix it like the recipe calls for.  Any ways, this was unblievable, very rich but would be a hit at any dinner party.  I served with grilled lamb chops and it was a hit.  My hubby very seldom compliments anything, but he loved this.  Is now a recipe in "my" permanent cook book.  And, by the way, for those on low carb diets......this is great!!  Thx for the recipe.

I did not follow the recipe exactly because I forgot to print it out at work and I don't have internet at home. But queen of improv that I am, I made it work with what I remembered, what sounded good, and my favorite - what I had on hand.  I used frozen chopped spinach (the kind that comes in that hard little square box) 1/4 of an onion, (chopped), 2 large crushed garlic cloves, a dash each of nutmeg, crushed red pepper flakes, salt and black pepper, and an Italian blend of 4 cheeses - provolone, mozzarella, parmesan and romano.  I fried the onion in about 2 tablespoons of butter, and added the crushed garlic when the onions were soft (but before the butter burned!).  I free-handed the heavy cream and cheese until the consistency was to my liking, then added the drained cooked spinach.  It was so awesome.

This is the best creamed spinach I've ever eaten! I made a few small changes; added bacon and used 1/2 & 1/2 + 1tsp of corn starch. I mean bacon can only make it better right. I also sliced the onions. Use fresh spinach and drain well after wilting. I served this to someone who "hates veggies" and they had 3 helpings. I definatly will make this one over and over again.

I cut this recipe in half and used 1 (5oz) container fresh spinach and 1 (10oz) frozen spinach. I added the frozen after it was thawed in the microwave to the wilted fresh spinach. The end result came out with a little too much liquid but Im sure thats from not pressing all the water out of the frozen spinach after cooking. The flavor was great and I did add some fresh ground black pepper. Very good!

This was AWESOME.  I love any type of spinach already, but after eating dinner at Ruth's Chris, I was inspired to try to make my own creamed spinach.  I cut the butter in half because it seemed like a LOT.  I didn't measure out the cream or cheese, but I am almost positive I didn't use the full amount.  Also, I only had mozzarella, so that's what I used.  And all in all, this was FABULOUS.  I felt totally guilty eating so much (and even sticking my finger in the pan several times), but it was goooood.

I love this recipe because it's so simple, versatile and tasty!  I've tried it with different kinds of cheeses, used garlic powder instead of fresh when I was out, and also frozen chopped spinach.  It always comes out great.

This is decadent...for spinach that is.  I had to improvise a little cause I didn't have all the ingredients.  I used cream cheese in place of the heavy cream and a little bit of 2% milk.  I also used a mixture of munster, parmesan and swiss cheeses.

The best creamed spinach I've ever had. I usually don't like provolone cheese, but mixed with spinach, it brings a great flavor. Will definitely do again.
