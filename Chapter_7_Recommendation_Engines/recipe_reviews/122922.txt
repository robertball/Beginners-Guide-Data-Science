Wow. I'm sitting here eating this as we speak, and I have to tell you what my first impression of it is! For someone who is trying to watch what they eat and consume more vegetables, this was fabulous! I served it over white rice... and I was just thrilled. This is a method of making veggies that I will keep with me, whether dieting or not! The sauce that goes on this has the familiar taste of butter, somehow, without having used any butter. It's very healthy, very good for you, and pretty easy to make! Don't go stingy with the carrots, they were my favorite part of the meal!

This recipe was fabulous.  I had to improvise a little for lack of ingredients.  Flour works fine in substitution of corn starch.  I also used a whole can of chicken broth and left out the water.  I wasnt lacking water, I just didnt want to waste the rest of the can of broth.  I used this recipe for a dinner hosted for my friends and everyone loved it.  Im passing this recipe on to everyone that I know.  Enjoy!

We truly enjoyed this dish, and were pleasantly surprised at the depth of flavor based on the simple ingredients.  I used peanut oil with a splash of sesame oil for the stir-fry, and flash-fried thin slices of fresh ginger and garlic first before adding the vegetables.  I replaced 2/3's of the broccoli with sugar snap peas and added a handful of shitake mushrooms.  We will definately make this again with whatever assortment of vegetables we have on hand - it's a winner.

Nice recipe. I too used broth instead of water. I also used a bag of frozen stir fry vegetables in stead of fresh, as it was what I had on hand. It worked well and was what I was looking for.

I was a little apprehensive at first because of the Corn Starch. I should have went with my gut feeling and left it out. It ruined the whole idea of stir fry by having a sauce like quality to it.

Very good and very easy. I get home from work late and was just looking for an easy recipe and one for which I had most of the ingredients on hand or if not, I could substitute. I used sesame oil and since I had fresh ginger on hand, I threw that in with the gr. onions, along with some chopped jalapeno for a bit of heat. I didn't have broccoli so I just used some sliced mushrooms and bean sprouts, adding them after sauteing the carrots and peppers. I think I used more soy sauce than is called for (abt. double) and added a bit of garlic powder near the end but that is just my taste. This was so delicious and satisfying, I ate it without the accompaniment of rice or noodles. What an amazing, delicious, healthy and extremely versatile recipe! Thanks so much for posting it, Cindy! This will definitely be a staple!

This was fantastic!  Didn't have any red peppers so added celery & mushrooms & a clove of garlic instead.  Hoping for leftovers, but sadly there were none...

We loved this :)  My husband, my 1 year old and myself all ate this over brown rice for a nice lunch. It's easy- and I used red and yellow peppers instead of green peppers because I like them better.  Very good! My 3 year old didn't eat it, but she's picky.

I first tried this recipe with the cornstarch, but it turned out very badly.  I think the cornstarch spoiled the dish, so I tried it again today minus cornstarch and it was delicious.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Awesome with any kind of veggies. I've been boiling and then frying ramen noodles and pouring the stir fry on top of that. I've also added chicken marinated in teriyaki for some extra protein.

As a base recipe that can be adapted to fit individual tastes, this is very good.  I use just one green pepper and eliminate the carrots.  In their place I add one zucchini and one yellow squash diced.  I double the ginger and soy sauce, and even add a little extra soy sauce to the finished dish.  Instead of six green onions, I just cut up whatever is in the bunch---the more the better.  I replace the water with chicken broth.  I use peanut oil as it can be gotten really hot without burning.  And I usually add a pinch or two of red pepper flakes to the oil for extra spiciness.  I serve it over a pile of good (long-cooking) brown rice and it is absolutely delicious.  It's so good you might want the leftovers for breakfast!  Highly recommended!

They turned out very good. I served them over rice and kept going back. I'll be making them again.

Very good recipe, made it in a pinch after coming home from the gym and was starving! (better than eating chocolate!) I used cauliflower, broccoli, asparagus, portobella mushrooms and red/green/yellow/orange peppers - I cut back a wee bit on the ginger as am not a big fan of it, but overall, very good recipe!

This was surprisingly delicious. Most of the flavour seems to come from the chicken broth. I didn't really taste the soy sauce, so if you really want that flavour, I would add more.

I made some additions and we really liked this.  I added chicken breast that I prepared in garlic flavored olive oil.  Instead of powdered ginger, I used fresh grated. I did toss in some chinese five spice and red pepper flakes.  To the sauce, I added some teriyaki along with the soy and a big squirt or two of honey.  It thickened really well and made a nice  brown sauce just like the one at the chinese place.  Served with some brown rice that I stir-fried with garlic olive oil, corn, peas, eggs and salt and pepper with some soy sauce on the side.  Thanks for the recipe, I will be making this again!

Simple, easy. Half the time I simplify it even more by using frozen "stir fry veggies". It doesn't get much easier'n this!

Sauteed thinly sliced chicken, then onion, garlic, sweet pepper, carrot, celery, mushrooms, and broccoli florets.  Great looking stir-fry, but the 'mild sauce' is so mild it hardly has much flavor.  I think using a full-bodied soy sauce in place of lite may help a bit.  In hindsight, I should've added a few drops of sesame oil and perhaps a splash of rice vinegar.

Really nice flavor.  Used flour in place of cornstarch, and broth instead of water.  Was WAY better than using a bottle of stir-fry sauce like I usually do.

Easy and so tasty - served over white rice, it's always a massive hit.  As I have been trying to get DH to eat less meat, I am always searching for new veggie focused recipes.  This one fits my search perfectly!  Snow peas also taste great in it.

Tasty and good. The ingredients were easy, but the recipe was out of order and could have been clearer.  I think next time we'll try a different stir-fry recipe.

Great starter recipe!  I used many of the veggies I recd in my CSA box this week - broccoli, peppers, onions, carrots.  I added mushrooms and garlic.  You can use any combo of vegetables you like.  I didn't use any broth - water only - and it was still great.  I also used freshly grated ginger, a splash of sesame oil and bit of red pepper flake. Yum!!

I followed this recipe as stated but doubled it cause we added mushrooms, zucchini and one of each colour pepper (one green, one yellow, one red and one orange)...also added garlic. I am rating it 5 stars because of the sauce. Excellent. Will definitely make again.

Easy and delicious! I used fresh ginger and a few more garlic cloves and eliminated the water because I thought it had enough liquid in the beginning. Also, I added mushrooms:) Mushrooms add Umami (Japanese), meaning a tasty flavor!

Excellent starter recipe- I always add extra veggies, bean sprouts, bamboo, water chestnuts, etc. as available, but the sauce is right on and it's great with jasmine rice.

As a vegetarian, I stir fry veggies weekly. The chicken broth is not at all necessary in this recipe or any other. Vegetable broth or even water can be substituted very satisfactorily with great results.  Vegetarians have to be so careful about eating dishes that are seemingly vegetable dishes. So many have the unnecessary chicken broth. This is a great recipe otherwise!

It turned out way too chicken brothy for me. Not the recipe I was thinking it would be.

Very good. I had some left-over saffron rice which I added to the mix. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that I think it needs something a little heavier in it, like tufo, chicken or shrimp..maybe even beans?

so easy to make I expected it to be blah. But it is great. Just what I need to boost my esteem. I'm so proud to say I made it! My family liked it and didn't even complain that they had to eat vegetables they didn't even know the name of. I put in baby bok choy and snow peas instead of the broccoli florets. Defiantly will make again.

This was delicious!  I didn't have any broccoli so I used celery in it's place. The mix of ginger and soy sauce is perfect.  I wish I had taken a picture of it because it looked as good as it tasted.  Great way for everyone to get those vegetables in their diet.  SO GOOD!  I'll make it again and again!

It was good, the only thing is since i didnt have broth, i used 2 tbsp of chicken buillon instead and added a tbsp of brown sugar and an additional 1/2 cup of water. it was perfect with a slight sweet taste.

Chef Gregg,  Found this to be enjoyable, even my wife like it. She thought I bought it.  lol  I mixed up the peppers alittle with green, red and orange along with baby carrots juliened. Plus i addded 1 apple diced up for some sweetness. added two small chicken backs boneless cubed. If you find the ginger to be a little strong, tone it down a pit with extra soy sauce when eating. It will give you a nice balance of sweet and light saltly taste. O over brown rice too.

This is a very good basic recipe, but I would have liked just a bit more flavor in the sauce. I added a little more soy sauce and three cloves of minced garlic along with the ginger. Next time I may try even more garlic and maybe oyster sauce or teriyaki just to jazz it up a bit more.  (Maybe I am missing the monosodium glutamate from the Chinese Restaurant!!) Anyway, works very well with whatever variety of veggies you have on hand. It will stay in the recipe box!

This was great. I left out the carrots and just chopped up a bunch of different peppers, added one zucchini, regular white onion and had to use frozen broccoli and cauliflower. I used sesame oil instead of regular oil. I didn't use the chicken broth sauce instead i added about a tablespoon of chili garlic sauce and it made enough sauce just with that combined with the soy. It also gave it a nice zip. Really ncie way to use up bits and pices of veg that might be going bad. I should have added my spinach that is almost going that would have been good too. A definite keeper.

I wasn't crazy about it, but I think it's b/c I don't entirely care for ginger.  My husband, on the other day, loves it.  He says 5/5.  I don't want to bring down a good recipe b/c of my preferences.  So 5 stars it is.  I did add toasted peanuts and a little red chili pepper at the end.  And extra soy sauce.  Even better.

I have made at least 50 different recipes from this site, and I did not have high expectations due to the simplicity of this recipe. I was so wrong! This was delicious! My kids even loved it AND ate the green pepper! My only changes were:
Used zuchinni, mushrooms,carrots,green/red pepper because that is what I wanted to use up. I had no green onion and used red in place of. I also added 1 brick of tofu and nearly doubled the sauce ingredients and ginger. Added a small amnt of chili pepper flakes, not enought to make it spicy.
So Good!!

This was really good - a great side dish for the Baked Teriyaki chicken we had tonight (the recipe is on here somewhere).  I used 3 bell peppers, a head of broccoli, and a package of sliced mushrooms.  I cooked the veggies in an electric skillet set to 350 - next time I will do the peppers for a few minutes before adding the other veggies as they took a bit longer.  The sauce was tasty and just the right consistency...I'll be making this one again!  Thanks for the recipe!

I was not really a fan of this recipe... the sauce really never thickened and the vegetables ended up overcooked because i cooked them longer while trying to thicken the sauce. I felt like i was eating soup. Tried again with the leftovers as a side dish the following night, completely left out the broth and corn starch and it was delicious.

Very tasty, but you must like a gravy-type sauce with your stir-fry veggies to fully appreciate the flavor. I liked how it tasted but thought the gravy was too thick. The only substitution I made was flour as I had no corn starch. Maybe that's why?

This was just okay.  The sauce came out kind of slimy; not like the traditional stir-fry.  I ended up adding some extra soy sauce as the flavor was a bit too mellow.  It still came out decent, just not wonderful for me.  Next time I will skip the corn starch and use some teriyaki sauce.

The stir-fry had an excellent, unique Asian taste to it. The ginger was a very enjoyable touch. A LOT of chopping is involved, but definitely worth it the end. NOTE: adding extra soy sauce is a great alternative!

Made this for dinner tonight with vegetable broth in place of chicken broth and it was great.  My husband thinks it beats restaurant fare hands down.  Can't wait to try with other veggie combos.

Delicious! I used summer squash and green beans instead of the peppers but still pretty much the same amounts. Loved it!

Great recipe. Wanted to use what I had on hand rather than going to the store.  I used Costco's frozen stir fry vegetables (which I defrosted in a strainer to remove as much water/ice as possible)and it turned out fabulous.
Also, used all chicken broth and no water.  Added a little crushed red pepper for an added zing.  Let it sit in the chicken broth for awhile.  Was out of ground ginger, so grated some fresh ginger and it turned out fabulous.
