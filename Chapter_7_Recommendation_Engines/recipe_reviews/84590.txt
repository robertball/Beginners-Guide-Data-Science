This is what I don't understand about this site....tons of people raved about this, and I looked at the ingredients and thought, hmmmm.....doesn't sound that interesting, but it must be great with all those reviews. Well guess what...IT IS ULTRA BLAND!!! It tastes like chicken and canned artichoke with tomatoe sauce! I followed the recipe to the last detail and everyone was disappointed. The question is, why do so many people like this recipe? I really can't imagine! Just trust me....it is REALLY not good!!

Tweaked the recipe a little to give it bold, mouth-watering flavor and it turned out amazing!
Added 3 (or 4?) garlic cubes to oil before sauteeing bite size chicken pieces.  Added two cans of diced tomatoes with peppers and a pinch of oregano and simmered for about 5 min before adding MARINATED artichoke from a jar (makes a difference), regular pesto, and sun-dried tomato strips.  Added chicken to sauce and tossed with penne.  We absolutely loved it!

A very unique dish. The only change I made to the recipe was to add 5 or 6 chopped up sun-dried tomatoes. I think this dish would be better as a hot pasta dish instead of being a stand-alone dish. I hope to make this dish again and again but with a few changes: Dice up the chicken; add 1 cup chicken broth and boil it down to create a nice sauce; serve it over penne pasta and include the sun-dried tomatoes again. I look foward to trying it with the above changes.

This is a great and easy dinner to make. The first time I made it, we loved it, but I felt it needed some changes.  The second time I made it, I diced the chicken, cut the artichokes more, added some sliced black olives and chicken stock to the sauce to thin it out and served it over linguine.  Everyone loved the meal. The best part, is that this is so quick to make.

This was a great recipe for company. I sauteed onions and minced garlic first. I seasoned the thin chicken breasts with salt, pepper and garlic powder. Then I cut the chicken up into pieces and cooked them with the onions and garlic. I added in the sun dried tomato pesto, I used more than the recipe called for. I added in the diced tomatoes and served it with whole wheat couscous. Delicious!

we gave this recipe 4 stars because we felt it was lacking something. We made our dish over a wheat pasta to add substance. When preparing the dish we cubed the chicken, added sun-dried tomatoes, and asparagus spears. Along with the salt and pepper, we added Italian Herb seasoning to add a little more flavor. In all, excellent recipe and would recommend it with these changes! Enjoy!

My roommate and I made this for a dinner party, came out great! I recently made it again, but this time I dredged the chicken in some italian bread crumbs and then lightly browned it. WOW!!! Delicious! I doubled the tomato, onion, and peppers which made it more saucy and placed the chicken over penne pasta. This is so easy to make, I LOVE IT!

We love this recipe.  We have made it several times and every time it is wonderful, so easy and delicious.  The only thing we add is fresh parmesan on top. Great lunch left overs too.

This meal was delicious! I used marinated artichokes and slightly more than what the recipe called for (I put in the whole amount in the jar). I also bought the small jar of the sun-dried tomato pesto and put the entire thing in (8 oz.). This made it have a little more sauce, and was wonderful! I'd definitely make it again.

This dish was amazing!! I used coarse garlic pepper and salt to season the chicken, and threw in chopped garlic will searing the chicken. I think it added just a bit more flavor. Oh, and I also used marinated artichoke hearts.

Really good recipe.  I added a lot of garlic, garlic powder, and onion powder.  The ingredients are a little expensive, so this recipe probably won't be a too-often occurrence in my house, but it was still delicious.

If you like the individual components to this recipe you will love it! Serve over a bed of Orzo pasta! The choice of pesto makes a huge difference so be mindful of that.

I followed the advice of others.  First i sauteed garlic and onions in olive oil and then added diced up chicken that i had seasoned with garlic powder and pepper.  When the chicken had browned i added sun dried tomatoes and the artichoke hearts.  Finally i added the pesto sauce (i used artichoke pesto b/c i couldn't find sun dried tomato) and the can of diced tomatoes and let it all simmer for 10 minutes.  I served it with couscous and steamed green beans but i plan on serving the leftovers over egg noodles.

It was little salty for me, just not too much.  I think that comes with the artichokes though.  The chicken was very moist from the sauce.

Made this for friends from work and it was a big hit!!  I took the advice of previous raters and used marinated artichoke hearts and added garlic to the pan before the tomatoes.  Lots of flavor!!!  I thought I would have some leftovers, but there is none left!!  Will definitely make again.

Very good.  Next time I will use 1 large whole butterfly breast instead of 2.  I'm considering adding some goat cheese as well.  This time, I used the whole container of sun-dried tomato pesto and two cans of the tomatoes to make it extra saucy.  I used the leftovers the next day with some pasta that I cooked.  I added about a half jar of store bought sun-dried tomato pasta sauce and it was even better than the night before.  I served with some crispy bread.  Overall, very easy and tasty.

This is how I turned this bland dish FABULOUS! Ok, I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, garlic powder, then browned in olive oil, removed from pan, and added chopped onion, garlic, and sauteed. then added the REG diced tomatoes, with a tbs of italian seasonings, and salt pepper, crushed red pepper, and some sugar.  I added chopped artichokes, NOT the marinated, and the pesto, AND some chopped sundried tomatoes.  I added the chicken back to the pan and let simmer until cooked through on LOW. Meanwhile I cooked angel hair pasta to go along with it.  Served the chicken and sauce on top of a bed of pasta, with garlic bread YUMMY!!!!

I made this last night and it was a hit with my husband and myself.  However, I used the suggestion for marinated artichoke hearts.  I cut the chicken into bite-sized cubes so that it would cook faster.  I also had to make my own pesto (which turned out better than I thought it would).  Either way, I'll be keeping this one.  It's bursting with flavor.  Yummy!!

Great recipe, I made a few changes.  Cut the chicken in strips and thickened the sauce a bit,  served it over pasta.

Definitely not as good as I'd hoped.  The canned artichokes are not very good in the recipe - perhaps using marinated artichoke hearts would help it taste better.

Giving 4 stars instead of 5 b/c I made substitutions. Instead of artichokes, I used a green bell pepper. Instead of "sun-dried tomato pesto", I used about 8 sun-dried tomatoes and about a quarter-cup of regular basil pesto. The sun-dried tomatoes added sweet/tangy notes, and the pesto had plenty of garlic and basil flavor...not bland at all, and I imagine that using artichokes would be even more flavorful. A keeper.

I made this for my husband & I tonight. He loved it! I made it with a spinach salad and some french bread on the side. It's a great light summer meal. I will be making this again!

Easy and delicious!  Wouldn't hurt to increase the amount of sun-dried tomato pesto.

Good recipe. I used Basil pesto instead of sun-dried tomato. I also used marinated artichoke hearts for added spices. When I took the chicken out of the pan I put it on a plate and squeezed half a lemon over it -this helps balance the oily flavor of the pesto and makes it smell good. I seasoned the chicken before cooking as well.  This dish is simple as the description asserts but if you want more flavor and boldness do what I did and add zesty things in.

What a surprise!  This dish tasted even better than I'd hoped. As some reviewers recommended I added garlic (2 fresh cloves, finely chopped) and used marinated artichokes.  Just before serving, I added some chopped parsley and freshly ground black pepper. I have also made it in the slow cooker, using chicken legs(7 hrs on LOW; add artichokes after 5 hrs). It tasted even better!  (and I didn't even brown the chicken first).

delicious. If I were served this at a restaurant I would be thrilled. 
I didn't have sundried tomato pesto so I used regular pesto and shopped up 2-3 tablespoons of sundried tomatoes. WOW!

I made this, using marinated artichokes that were already quarterd, the plain diced tomatoes (a can and a half), added in my own chopped garlic (3 large cloves) and onions (1/2 large yellow), and 5 chicken breasts.......was one of THE best dishes i've ever had. Served it with spinach sauteed in garlic and olive oil, and whole wheat spaghetti. Wow amazing dinner!

I enjoyed this recipe more than I thought I would.  I followed the suggestions of several other reviewers and added chicken broth and garlic to the cubed chicken while browning it.  

I also used Italian Stewed tomato's rather than plain diced tomatoes.  We ate it over Angel Hair Pasta and it tasted pretty decent.  I also sprinkled some pecorino romano cheese over the top.

Will make it again with the modifications listed above.

What a pleasant surprise.  I wasn't sure what to expect with the sauce, but it turned out to be a fantastic spaghetti style pasta sauce. Will definitely serve with pasta next time.

I really liked this.  I cubed the chicken, quickly browned it in the pan and then added all of the other ingredients.  When it was done. I mixed it with some Israeli cous cous.  Really good! The best part is dinner was done in less than 20 minutes!

I followed other reviews and used double the sundried tomato pesto and marinated artichokes. I also added oregano, sauted onion and garlic. I cut the chicken into strips, floured and browned before adding it to the sauce to simmer. This was a delicious dish served with roasted pinenut couscous and kalamata olive bread. The only thing I noticed was that between the oil in the pesto and on the marinated artichokes, there was a little too much "oil" flavor for my taste. Next time I will try using artichokes in water and just adding more to make sure the flavor comes through.

I have been meaning to rate this recipe for months now.  I make it all the time, easy and delicious.  One change I make is to make my own sun-dried tomato pesto by blending a jar of sun dried tomatoes with a jar of pesto in a mini food processer.

I took some of the suggestions from earlier reviewers and thought the end product turned out quite well.  Specifically, I had a couple of huge chicken breasts so I cut them into large chunks before browning them in the oil along with a couple cloves of garlic, and I also used the marinated artichoke hearts.  After adding one can of Rotel tomatoes with chiles, I wanted something saucier so I added an 8 oz can of tomato sauce and also a couple minced sundried tomatoes to augment the sundried tomato pesto.  I then served it in bowls, like a stew, and I thought it had a very good flavor--a little kick from the chiles in the Rotel tomatoes and not bland at all.  Another bonus was that it was quick to prepare!  I would certainly make this again.

This was fantastic!  I added 1/2 onion, chopped and 3 cloves of garlic.  Instead of using the diced tomatoes with green peppers & onions, I used plain petite diced tomatoes.  I used 2 jars of marinated artichokes instead of the canned artichokes.  The whole family loved it.

My husband raved over this recipe, saying, "This is company's-comin', restaurant-quality good." and "You could make this every week and I'd be happy."  
I used chicken breast tenderloins instead of whole breasts and, being a Texan, thought the recipe called for Rotel (tomatoes with green chiles) instead of tomatoes with green peppers and onions.  No matter - it was still awesome, ~and~ it had a little kick.  

Thanks for an easy, delicious recipe that made me look like a really good cook!

AMAZING! I didn't have sundried tomatoes. I used one can of plain diced tomatoes, and substituted basil pesto (green) for the red pesto, as that's what I had. Served it over al-dente penne pasta with shredded parmesan on top and it was a hit.

I have to give this five stars mainly because I modified the recipe.  I only had a regular can of diced tomatoes on hand, so I felt I needed to spice it up a little.   Therefore, I added:  a tablespoon of garlic in the olive oil when I browned the chicken, a tablespoon of capers for some added saltiness, a can of sliced mushrooms, 1/3 cup of shredded parmesan/romano cheese, 1/2 cup of alfredo sauce and a little over 1 tablespoon of hot pepper & garlic sauce (comes in a jar at the grocery store).  The hot pepper added a nice kick and the alfredo sauce helped smooth the sauce from the diced tomatoes.  I served over a little spaghetti and it was delicious!!!!

Delicious! Only thing I did different was cut the chicken pieces smaller and add garlic powder. I served it over Rottini pasta and served a delicious dinner to the family which I will be making again.

Not bad , the only changes that I made were adding some sauteed onion and garlic.  I then put it all together and marinated it over night.  Might try the slow cooker next time.  Best part was it was super healthy!!

This recipe was super easy and the family loved it!! I did however tweak it a little bit. I did not add the pesto to it and When I was sauteing the tomatoes I added Garlic Salt and Chicken Bouillon. Other than that the recipe was awesome!!

Great recipe that takes very little time at all.  If you don't like artichoke hearts, sundried tomatoes, pesto or chicken, you have bigger problems than what to have for dinner.  Great served with pasta...

This was awesome!  Of course I did make some adjustments...I cubed the chicken and lightly dusted with breadcrumbs.  Added some garlic and onion to th oil while sauteing.  I Added some riesling and chicken broth while it simmered to make it more of a sauce.  Served it over penne with grated Locatelle Romano cheese.  Also warmed some bread and served some of the pesto with the bread.  Awesome meal.

This was very tasty.  I used regular pesto and cut up sun-dried tomotoes.  I added a little white wine to create more of a sauce.  Next time I might add another can of tomatoes

Very tasty recipe.  Next time I will fix it on a bed of Penne or Angel Hair.  There is so much flavor, it would be great spread out over pasta.  I made the Sun-dried tomato pesto from this site in the recipe.  Yum!

This recipe is a winner with both my husband and I. Very flavorful. I have made this recipe twice now and both times I have used pesto and sun dried tomatoes separately. I couldn't find a sun dried tomato pesto so I just used them as separates. It still came out perfectly delicious! I actually cooked the chicken in the skillet with the pesto,olive oil, and sun dried tomatoes. I never removed the chicken. I will definitely be making this one again!

I will definitely add garlic to this recipe because it lacked a little zing.  Added asparagus and zuchini to the veggies.

Wow,this dish really blew me away. I was looking for a good artichoke and chicken dish and decided to try this one, although the actual recipe and ingredients didn't seem especially enticing. I tried this recipe as is, although after reading reviews, I dipped thinly sliced chicken breasts in flour with some herbs salt and pepper to add some extra flavor before sauteing them in the olive oil. I also used Muir Glen fire-roasted diced tomatoes with green chili as the tomatoes and a dash of red pepper flakes. It added a bit of a nice kick. My husband loved it and I must agree. Definitely a keeper.

It was great because I followed another reviewers' suggestions. I also did not have the pesto so I used the dried basil, sun dried tomatoes in oil and the grated romano. I also served it over whole wheat pasta and it was really tasty.

This dish definitely deserves more than 5 stars...it was wonderful! I took some tips from other reviews and cut the chicken breasts into chunks, sauteed some garlic before cooking the chicken, and added some sundried tomatoes. I served it over whole wheat angelhair pasta, and it was a huge hit!

This was a fantastic recipe.
I didn't have pesto, so I added 2 tsp of basil, 1/4 cup Romano cheese and 1/2 small jar of sundried tomatoes, along with the suggested garlic. I also substituted onions for shallots. My husband LOVED it (and he's so picky). We served it over cheese tortillini, but I wouldn't recommend that. Will be eating it over penne for lunch. All in all a great recipe that has very little fat and calories. Thanks! UPDATE: I decided to try this recipe just as it is written with Sundried tomato pesto (trader joes) and marinated artichokes (trader joes) and it was terrible! The artichokes would literally get stuck in your mouth while you chewed them FOREVER. The taste was dreadful, and we ended up ordering take out instead of eatting it. Funny how a couple of ingredients can change the taste so much. The updated version is definitely 5 stars, but the original in my opinion is 2 (I consider 1 completely inedible). Guess I'll stick to the new and improved!!

recipe was good. I followed others advice and diced the chicken and added fresh garlic and italin seasoning. Served it as a sauce over penne pasta and it was very good. Easy enough recipe to make in a hurry and very tastey.

Yumm! I cut the chicken into bite-sized chunks, used Knorr pesto and added sun dried tomatoes while cooking. Fresh onions instead of tomato mixture. Served over couscous. Excellent!

I absolutely love this recipe. It has definitely become a favorite. The only thing that I do differently is I put in a couple spoonfulls of capers and garlic and I use marinated artichoke hearts. The leftovers are the best because the chicken has had more time to soak up the juices.

Delicious... made it for company, and the raves started the second they came in and smelled it cooking.
Didn't change anything, except cutting the chicken up because of aesthetic preference.

I made the mistake of using diced tomatoes with green chilis - which was way too much heat and over powered the flavor of the pesto and artichokes.  That said, I think you could have got the same results dumping all the ingredients into a slow cooker - I don't think browning the chicken was necessary and also dried it out.  Won't make this again.

Not bad.  The combination of ingredients in the sauce is kind of fun.  A little too tart, maybe, but I thought it was good.  You definitely taste the artichoke, so make sure you like them!  they aren't covered up by other ingredients at all.  I thought it went pretty well with the rest of the ingredients.  I did use already breaded chicken breasts, which state on the package to bake, so I just baked it separately then put the sauce on the chicken over rice.  I felt it was a pretty good dish that way.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was so tasty! I must admit, I did tweak the recipe a bit. I traded out the artichokes for fresh asparagus on the side. I added some spices to the canned tomatoes (thyme, basil, rosemary, etc...) and seasoned the chicken way in advance of cooking (and with some more seasoning than just salt and pepper) to let the flavors soak in. Then I did as the recipe said, and it turned out delicious.

I made this dish last night and it turned out fantastic! A few minor changes though: First I diced the chicken, then I browned it in olive oil with some salt, pepper, turmeric, onion powder, basil and paprika added for flavor. I also added 1-2 cloves of garlic to the chicken a couple of mins before taking it off the heat. For the tomatoes I added some basil as well as as half a diced yellow bell pepper as well (any other color pepper will do too), then served the whole thing over buttered angel hair pasta. These little changes made a big difference for flavor and everyone loved it! Will definitely make it again.

This recipe is absolutely amazing! My sister-in-law and I decided to have a girls night and cook some chicken because both our husbands hate chicken. The boys returned and it smelled so good that my hubby gave it a try and even he loved it! The only thing I really changed is that I added a little more olive oil and some fresh garlic to it. GREAT recipe!

Browned chicken in oil and garlic. Set aside. 1 can fire roasted tomatoes, 1 can artichoke hearts, cut smaller, 1 lg can olives-sliced, about 1/8+ c. oregano.  L, J, and I liked it alot.  next time tenderized chicken and have in smaller pieces so it doesnt get touch on outside and not done inside.  Sprinkled with feta was good. Next time double the canned goods for plenty of sauce.

YUM!  I couldn't find the tom's with green peppers and onions, so I cut up a small onion and used petite diced tomatos.  I also used the entire jar of sun-dried tomato pesto and then added all to penne.  It was wonderful!

To save time, I browned the chicken (seasoned w/ salt, pepper, garlic powder, Italian seasoning) and left in skillet - then added a can of Italian style stewed tomatoes (cut), the pesto called for and marinated artichoke hearts in oil (drained). Stir and simmer for about 8-10 minutes on low. A very flavorful and quick recipe!

Would definitely give this 5 stars if I were rating it the way I made it. I didn't have any sun-dried tomatoes, so I skipped them. I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes, one that had zesty green chilis in it, used basil pesto instead of sun-dried tomato, and chopped up the artichokes in quarters. I added fresh herbs from my herb garden: thyme, basil, oregano and parsley. Served it over whole grain pasta and topped with mozzarella. I know it's a lot different than the recipe, but I used what I had. DELICIOUS!

This is so good and so easy! I used Classico brand sun-dried tomato pesto and seasoned the chicken with Mrs. Dash instead of salt & pepper. Followed the recipe as written and it turned out great!

I diced my chicken instead of leaving it whole.  I also left the chicken in the skillet when I heated up the diced tomatoes--I saw no reason to remove it.  Because other reviewers said it was bland I added minced garlic and used marinated artichokes.  I added the liquid from the marinated artichokes to the chicken when I was browning it in the skillet.  Overall, this was a very easy meal to make and it only took about twenty minutes total to make it.  It tasted pretty good and I will make it again.

This was a really good recipe! I used the sun dried tomato pesto that is also on this site and followed the directions as is. Had a very nice flavor and I love the sauce even without the chicken. What I plan to do the next time is to cut the chicken up in 1" cubes so that the flavor can be absorbed. In my thicker pieces of chicken I found that the center of the chicken was sort of bland. I served this with brown rice for half the family and barilla plus for the other half of the family and both were yummy and healthy. We had left over sauce that I saved to eat for lunch because as is the sauce was delicious. I may add some more red wine to the recipe to sharpen the flavor and perhaps some fresh pesto and sauteed garlic when sauteing up the salt and pepper chicken for the initial browning. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is fabulous. For those watching carbs, this is great on its own without pasta - just add more artichokes. Even better the next day. Thanks!

This was great! I got lots of compliements on this by making it  one of the reviewers mentioned, making it a pasta chicken sun- dried tomato dish. I added pine nuts, a little bit of garlic to make it more italian. The only thing I'd change would be the sun-dried tomatoes. Here in Germany they came in  a plastic package already salted, and were too salty. So next time I'd probably rinse them with water and dry them with a paper towel. Other that that, perfect! Thnks  for the recipe and improvements!

I made this last night for dinner with just a few slight changes.  First I decided I wanted to serve this over pasta.  I cooked the breasts as the directions said and removed.  To the tomato, pesto and artichoke sauce I added chopped up sun dried tomatoes and also the juice from the artichoke.  I then cut up the chicken into bite sized pieces and added to the mix and simmered.  I added a bit of salt and pepper and a bit of oregeno.  Served over wheat penne...was very tastey.  My 3 yr old even ate it up.  My b/f had to find something to complain about and said he thought it was bland...but it definitely is not!

I loved this recipe. It was a hit with my boyfriend too. but instead of using chicken breast I used chicken tenders. The chicken soaked up the flavor better.

What a great dish!  I also used marinated artichoke hearts, and I also used an entire 7 oz. container of Buitoni sundried tomato pesto.  I didn't know whether or not to drain the canned tomatoes, so I didn't, and it turned out fine because the liquid cooked off.  The chicken was really tender and the entire dish was very flavorful and good over whole wheat penne :).  Thanks for the recipe!

I really liked this recipe.  I did as others had suggested by adding garlic and onion. I served with a boxed alfredo noodle side. I figured that at the time, the kids would eat the noodles if they didn't like the chicken but it went over big with everyone. I will keep this recipe for a long time.

This was really lacking something.  I think the dish relied too much on the pesto for flavor and that isn't a good idea.  I would add a clove of minced garlic to this while cooking the chicken, which I diced.  When the garlic starts to brown, take the chicken out and add in the tomatoes, artichokes and pesto with the garlic still in there.  Mix together and then add the chicken back in and simmer for 10 minutes.

I also highly suggest going with another reviewer's suggestions and using Italian seasoning.  If you like flavorful chicken dishes though, this is not for you.

This was really boring and I did a lot to try to improve it - I started with sauteed garlic and onion and then browned small pieces of chicken, added 1 1/2 cans of tomatoes and the pesto and used marinated artichoke hearts instead of regular, then served it over penne.  I didn't think this was a winner.  The tomatoes were too chunky, it would have been better with just plain tomato sauce or just the pesto.  My boyfriend makes a pesto/chicken/sun-dried tomato/parm/pine nuts pasta that I think is better than this.

It was delish! I used garlic in my recipe as well as oregano, basil and garlic canned tomatoes(Del Monte)Next time I think I will use a few onions and a little bit of red pepper flakes and mozzarella or goat cheese.

Good, but needed a little more kick for us. We also added garlic and Costco's marinated artichokes and pesto spread!  I'll make this again and add some crushed red peppers.  If you're looking to put over pasta, make sure to add more liquid because the recipe's called for measurements weren't enough for "sauce."  Thanks!

Very flavorful and easy to prepare. I served it with asparagus, spaghetti and garlic bread. I added italian seasoning and 3 cloves of garlic. My husband told me a few times that I made a really good dinner. It does have a bit of a spice if you are sensitive to spicy food.

I suggest using half the recommended amount of artichokes and diced tomatoes. The taste of the artichokes is a little overpowering. Also, I used alfredo sauce instead of pesto, which I really liked.

This was a good starting point for me...changed it up somewhat! Followed first step, but then used LOTS of fresh diced tomatoes, with    garlic, diced green pepper, and onions.   Also, didn't use artichoke and used pre-packaged pesto sauce. Then put chicken with sauce over top covered in oven for about an hour. Tossed with spaghetti, and VOILA! Fabulous!!

I added chopped sun dried tomatos.  Next time I'll add chopped black olives, pine nuts and cut the chicken into smaller pieces.

This is an easy and delicious chicken recipe. For the tomatoes I used Rotel's Mild Tomatoes and Green Chiles. This ingredient gave the dish a great zip.

It was good!  Made a couple changes based on others' reviews - used fresh green pepper and onions, garlic, used green pesto and sun dried tomatos, made w angel hair pasta, added some chicken broth - but I'm sure it would have been great as is.  
I used scallopini chicken (thin-sliced) and it got a little dry in the simmer process but it was still tasty.
My husband really enjoyed it.  I will definitely make it again.  Thanks for the recipe idea!

Very easy to make and very delicious! I couldn't find sun-dried pesto so I just used normal green pesto and added an extra tablespoon but didn't need it.  I served it with biscuits which was great. It would also be great over pasta. The only thing is that the ingredients are expensive. Otherwise it was perfect!

Excellent...we thought this was restaurant quality.  Instead of the canned tomatoes w/ peppers & onions, I cut up my own fresh peppers & onions.  Great recipe...have already made 3 times!

One of the best features of this meal is how quick and easy it is to make. It is a nice light chicken dish. I made some pasta on the side, but needed to add another fresh tomato to the sauce. I seasoned the chicken breast with garlic powder as well as salt and pepper. I didn't have green peppers but would consider adding mushrooms next time.

This was very good.  Comes together quickly  and still has that companies coming taste.  I added a pinch of red pepper flakes for additional flavor.  If you split your chicken breasts, keep an eye on them that you don't overcook them; simmer very low and slow at the end to keep them tender.  Thanks for a very good recipe.

i served this over orzo.  I used both sun-dried tomatoes and pesto paste.  Very good--would even be good without the chicken.

This is my 3rd day of having this for lunch. FANTASTIC!! Quick & easy meal with great flavours. However, I would add more pesto, or both - regular and sun dried pesto to amplify the intensity of this dish. Very yummy. Also, avoid over cooking those artichokes - otherwise you'll understand why they're called "chokes". Leftovers are that much more delicious over rice, noodles, or with crusty bread.

Wonderful!  I used regular pesto, and I used 3/4 cup instead of the called for 1/4.  Served over penne.  One caution:  I only had artichoke hearts marinated in oil.  Although I drained them, I should've washed them to get rid of some of the oil.  That, combined with the oil from the prepared pesto was a  little much!  A note for next time!

This was soooo good. You could make without the chicken -- put the tomato/artichoke sauce on pasta or rice. It was that good. I can't find the sun dried pesto - just used the normal green pesto and it was YUMMY!

Tried this for the first time last night, it was pretty yummy.  I used my own homemade pesto, and it was probably a bit more than 1/4 c.  It still seemed like there was something missing from the flavor.  I may try store-bought pesto next time.

I gave it 5 stars because it was so easy to make.  Probably 4 stars on taste.  I used tomatoes with just onions because the store didn't have the other ones.  Next time I will use 2 cans of tomatoes and drain at least one whole can.  I will also use more pesto (probably the entire 3 oz. jar).  I could take or leave the artichokes.

The chicken would be better marinated before cooking, I also incorporated a tsp of crushed garlic along with seasoning, the diced tomatoes benefited from the addition of some Mrs Dash seasoning...if I hadn't tweaked the various seasonings this would have been a very bland meal.

This was really great! We used basil, garlic, oregano tomatoes instead and then served it over bow tie noodles. It was a great dish paired with a colorful salad. Only thing it needed was some parmesan cheese sprinkled on top!

It wasn't bad but not a total favorite. I thought it was a bit to tangy for a chicken dish. Will try it again and see if it was my error. :)

My husband loved it.  He even said it would have been good without the chicken!  lol  The combination of flavors are very good.  I don't live near specialty stores, so I had to use ordinary tomato paste instead of the pesto and added my own onions and green peppers. It wasn't "bland" at all ... maybe the secret is the minute of stirring the tomatoes ... or letting it simmer covered.  But,yes, it is very good.  I rarely make the same dish twice, but this will be one of them.  Thanks for the recipe!

Following the many suggestions by other reviewers, this is excellent. I chunked the chicken, cooked a couple cloves of garlic, then cooked the chicken. Added 1/2 cup of pesto (instead of 1/4c), a 1/4c or so of sun dried tomatoes, and used marinated artichokes. I served this with garlic kale (another recipe on here). Delicious!

Extra star for ease. I am a terrible cook and manage to burn most things, but this was easy to make. I followed the recipe pretty much (but was generous with the sun dried tomato pesto and added 1/4 cup of halved sun dried tomatoes). Boyfriend loved it. So much so, that I didn't actually get any. He brought it to work everyday after, so I'll for sure be making this again (and hiding it from him for a while).

I didn't care for the canned artichokes. It was ok, but not something I will make again.

This is a solid recipe as is. The flavours work very well together. Next time I won't hesitate to use my ready on hand sun dried tomatoes rather than searching out the pesto. I would also cut the artichokes smaller only so they will be in every bite :).  We will make this again for sure.  Thanks for a good recipe.

This turned out great for me. I used fresh chopped tomatoes instead of canned. Also, didn't have tomato pesto, so used basil pesto instead. Also the artichokes I had in the cupboard were marinated in some sort of oil mixture. 
The final dish turned out to be delicious, and not at all bland like some other reviewers' experiences. I'm not sure if this had anything to do with the different ingredients I used or not.

Served it over rice.

Can't believe how easy this recipe is to make. I pounded the chicken breast level before cooking them. That way they cooked evenly. I also served rice on the side. A complete, delicious meal.

I mean the recipe here is more like a starter. In my opinion. After that you do what you want with it and make it delicious. I did. I had it with pasta. Yummy. It made me four bowls over the course of a few days. Certainly a delicious meal.

This was ok and good for a quick one skillet, pantry item meal. I added some onions and garlic to the skillet while cooking the chicken (cut up in pieces).  I also did not have sundried tomato pesto but I did have some sundried tomato paste (tube) and that was a perfect thinkener and added a deeper flavor.  Serveed over egg noodles.  Overall this was an OK dish, worth trying and tweeking to your taste for a easy weeknight meal.

Funny how people have such different tastes.  I thought it looked so so, but had the ingredients so I made it.  I rolled the breasts in seasoned flour because, for some reason I thought the recipe called for it.  I then followed the remaining directions and baked it in the oven.  Was very good.

I've read other people's critical reviews on the blandness of the recipe. Most of them mention that they add the "sundried tomatoes".  The key is to use PESTO.  Not just sundried tomatoes.  Sun-dried tomato pesto is extrememly flavorful.  I usually use the whole jar, which is about 2 oz. more than the recipe calls for. It has a LOT  of flavor if you use the correct ingredients.

Very good dish!  I made a few changes to the original recipe, according to the items that I had in the pantry.  I coated the chicken breasts in italian breadcrumbs which gave them a nice flavor and texture.  I only had plain diced tomatoes, so I sauteed some garlic and onion before adding the tomatoes to the pan.  I mixed some Knorr pesto mix with some sun-dried tomatoes in oil to make the tomato pesto.  Next time, I will focus more on creating a true tomato pesto, as there was not enough of that flavor in the dish, in my opinion (I love pesto!).  I only used about half the amount of artichokes called for in the recipe, and it was more than enough.  Will definitely be making this recipe again!

I absolutely loved this dish. I made one substitution (or two, but who's counting). For the life of me I could not find sun dried tomato pesto, and, instead of buying pesto and sun dried tomatoes. I purchased pesto and Sun Dried Tomato Tapenade (which, apparently is to olives what pesto is to basil). I didn't plan it, but it was absolutely wonderful.

Very good!  We cut up the chicken and cooked it in olive oil and fresh minced garlic first, then served it over penne pasta instead of making the chicken a main dish.  We also served it with parmesan cheese.

This recipe was just okay.  I love the artichokes, but the tomato pesto did not add a nice flavor and I thought the overall taste was nothing remarkable.  It kinda just tasted like chicken with some artichokes and tomato sauce, and of course there was the taste of the pesto but that just made it worse.

I'm surprised to rate such a simple dish with 5 stars, but it was excellent and everyone in my family liked it! I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I used Hunt's Fire-Roasted tomatoes and marinated artichoke hearts, and served it over spiral pasta.  Fast, simple, delicious-- just the kind of meal perfect for a week night!

This turned out great! I doubled the recipe for the sauce, and served it with goat cheese tortellini. My boyfriend liked it so much that he wanted to take the leftovers to his mother (who is quite the cook) to try. Will make again!

I didn't think this was bland at all, and really enjoyed it.  My husband, who hates artichokes, and my 5 year old who is somewhat picky, even liked it. Next time I will serve it over pasta.

I altered the recipe by adding olives instead of the atichokes, using a vegetable dip powder mix instead of the pesto, added about an 1/8 a c of parmesan cheese and about a Tblsp of Oregano the same time that I added the salt and pepper. I also sauted the onion and garlic prior to adding the chicken and took out the tomatoes. I really liked it will be making it again sometime and will try it with the Pesto and Artichoke as I love them both. I will see which one works out the best.

Followed suggestions by MSERNI (02-2007), plus added a couple of shakes of red pepper flakes, used regular pesto and unmarinated artichokes, but marinated sun-dried tomatoes.  Also, I really wanted to enjoy the "sauce", so I did thicken it a bit with a little cornstarch.  Served w/ couscous "fancied up" w/ lemon juice, chicken broth and sliced almonds.  Really good!

Awesome recipe; great base. I added diced onions, 4 cloves of garlic, italian seasoning, crushed red peppers and cremini mushrooms. I also sliced the chicken. It was an A+ and the final product was fantastic!

This recipe was made with several modifications, otherwise I don't think I would make it again.  I cut the chicken breast into cubes and tossed in 3 tsp salt, 1.5 tsp black pepper, 2 tsp garlic salt and 1/4 cup flour in a ziploc bag.  Added 4 diced cloves of garlic to the oil at the very start, then added the chicken.  I also added 1 tsp oregano and a pinch of chili pepper to the tomato mixture.  It wouldn't have been much of a dinner on its own -- we served it over couscous and it was nice and flavourful.  I think next time I would add sliced whole sundried tomatoes as well.  I just didn't have them on hand this time around.

Excellent flavor.  Incorporated some of the recommendations and coated the chicken with seasoned bread crumbs first.  Also used marinated artichoke hearts and doubled the sauce.  
Super good!

We have cooked this on a regular basis for about a year...I double when we have company and it is always a hit.  I sometimes add mushrooms or spinach to change it up a little.  Everyone always loves it, thanks!

This has become one of our favorites.  I did modify just a a bit.  When I take the browned chicken out, I add a 1/2 cup of water and saute some onions and use regular, undrained diced tomatoes and simmer about 20 minutes.  I add a 1/3 of a box of the mini farfalle pasta.  This is a great one dish meal.

This was good. But, it could use a little jazzing up. Perhaps a little Italian seasoning or something. I think next time I might try bone/skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts. Thanks for a quick dinner idea!

This recipe was neither good nor bad tasting.  It was just like eating plain chicken and dumping canned tomatoes and artichoke on it.  I'd eat it if I were really hungry, but wouldn't prepare it again.

This dish was so simple to make.  Based on some of the reviews, I cut up the chicken into bite sized pieces, added some minced garlic, sauteed chopped green bell peppers and onion.  I served it over angel hair and it was delicious.  A lot of flavors... maybe a mix between a jambalaya and a tomato-based pasta sauce.

Definitely will make this again.

Kept the recipe almost the same... added a can of sliced black olives, a jar of marinated artichoke hearts-- in addition to the can of artichoke hearts. I diced the chicken and threw it in the sauce to simmer with half a box of cooked penne and a splash of dry red wine. If I made it again I would make my own sun-dried tomato pesto, the jar stuff was high in sodium... hence the wine addition the offset that. And I must say this dish is more filling than it looks! YUMMY!

This recipe was simple and easy to make. I did not have pesto on hand, so I just chopped up some sun-dried tomato out the jar. I used Italian-seasoned diced tomatoes and marinated artichokes for extra flavor. I also on a whim decided that I wanted my chicken breasts lightly breaded, so I used Italian bread crumbs and egg to coat the chicken. My picky husband loved this dish. Will definitely make again.

All in all we thought this was a delicious recipe!  My husband and I are healthy eaters though so we had to change a few things.  When browning the chicken you are supposed to use oil, instead we got campbells 98% fat free condensed broccoli cheese soup.  We added 1/4 cup of water, mixed, and heated over med-high heat, than after seasoning the chicken (which we added italian seasoning to) we browned it.  A lot of people recommended it with pasta, but we were in the mood for spicy corn so what we did was put the whole chicken on the plate, and cooked the "sauce" a little thicker to top the chicken with.  It came out delicious!  We also recommend blending your own pesto, you can find a great recipe here and ditch the oil.

This was fantastic and easy!  I also sauteed the garlic in oil first, then instead of the pesto, I chopped up three artichoke hearts from the can, some fresh basil and sun-dried tomatoes from the jar packed in olive oil.  It was absolutely fabulous.  I served it over mashed potatoes!

I am on a weight loss program where I can eat extra virgin olive oil to cook.  TO modify this and make it not fattening i used two real tomatos and a fresh artichoke, browned the chicken in extra virgin olive oil, and didnt use any salt, just some ceyanne pepper because that speeds up your metabolism!  Great meal actually something with flavor that isnt fattening!

This was good with a few changes. Per other reviewers, I cut the chicken into small pieces and browned them with 4 cloves of garlic.  I used a plain can of diced tomatoes, 1/2 cup of sun-dried tomato pesto and marinated artichoke hearts that had been well drained.  This combination made a nice sauce and I served this over bow-tie pasta.  Great quick and healthy meal.

I enjoyed this recipe.  I could not find any diced tomatoes with green peppers and onions, so I used stewed tomatoes with onion and basil.  I also could not find artichoke hearts in water, so I had to use marinated artichoke hearts.  I also pounded the chicken and seasoned it with garlic powder and Italian seasoning before cooking. Thank you for sharing:)

The start of something good, but needs some improvement.  I think next time I will try a few of the suggested alterations (garlic and sun-dried tomatoes) and maybe some of my own.  Kalamata olives maybe?

This was so yummy! Had just the right amount of "kick" from the chiles in the tomato mixture, and the flavor was so great from the artichokes. I changed my mind from serving with pasta, to serving with herb roasted potatoes, and it was a HUGE hit with my boyfriend. Seemed very italian-ish. In fact, might even be good with a slice of mozerrela on top of each chicken breast at the end for melting. I'll be making this one again!

Fantastic and so easy! I used a can or plain diced tomatoes and added some diced jalapenos for kick. I also couldn't find sundried tomato pesto, so just pureed the ones from the jar. Will definitely make this again and again.

I typically would not choose this recipe because of the artichoke hearts but when it was done, it was amazingly tasty.  I loved it and will make it again.

Excellent!  I did plain artichokes and couldn't find sun dried tomato pesto, so I just added sun dried tomatoes to my pesto. I was worried it wouldn't be too flavorful, so I added some white wine.  It was excellent and would be without the wine!  Nice and healthy, too.  Will definitely make again.

Easy and tasty! What more could you ask?  I made minor changes based on others' reviews.  I added chopped, cooked bacon, a little chicken broth and garlic powder and served it over angel hair pasta.  We loved it and will definitely be adding it to our meal rotation.

Very good. I've never had artichoke hearts before. I got marinated ones and they reminded me alot of capers. Some of the viewers said they added capers. I don't think you'd need to with the marinated artichokes. If they were regular artichoke hearts, I agree that capers would be a really good addition.

I already rated this, but just tried something else and it was even better.   As I said before, I deglaze w/ wine.  (red or white).  I recently served over parmesan polenta (it was the instant polenta & I added 1/2 c parmesan.  It was delicious.  Rave reviews..again!

I love sundried tomatoes with artichokes so I tried out this dish with a few changes.  I breaded the chicken first with bread crumbs and fried it. I also did not use the canned tomatoes-fresh instead. Finally, instead of sundried tomato pesto, I just used cut up sundried tomatoes. Overall I was impressed, but I did need to add a lot of garlic powder to give it that kick it needed. Served with pasta too.

I couldn't find any sun-dried tomato pesto so I used about a tablespoon of pesto seasoning instead.  I also omitted the green peppers/onions from the diced tomatoes.  It was so easy to make and delicous!  I will use this recipe again.

Delish! I added a little chicken stock while simmering so the sauce wasn't so thick, it allows you to simmer the flavors together longer.  Also, my container of sundried tomato pesto was larger than called for so I made a little pasta and used the rest of the pesto on the pasta! Made a really nice side dish.  This one is really good.
(PS Try the no salt added tomatoes they taste the same with way less sodium)

Great recipe and so easy! I made it for my parents after a day of cleaning up after Hurricane Katrina, and it was perfect comfort food for us all. I served it over angel hair pasta (dad's favorite) and everyone loved it. The only thing I changed was, I couldn't find tomato pesto and substituted tapenade.

I have made this dish twice.  Actually, I agree it would be bland without the extras...I added minced garlic and sun dried tomatoes (fresh).  Also, I used about 1/2 cup of the sun dried pesto.  My college daughters fight over who gets the leftovers!!

Great taste, and so easy to make. My only change was to cube the chicken before browning. My husband loved it, and that makes me happy. I served it over rice, but would also be very good on pasta. Garlic bread and salad on the side. What could be easier?

This is a very easy meal and full of wonderful flavors. After browning the chicken, I cut it into pieces before adding it back in to the skillet. I served it with bowtie pasta and a spinach salad.  My husband loved it!

I made this for a friend so didn't actually get to taste it but it smelled delicious. I would definently make it again for my family! I used olive tapenade instead of the sun-dried tomato pesto as she is allergic to nuts.

Excellent - used about 1 tbsp of regular pesto then added some sun-dried tomatoes in to the mix when cooking.  Chopped up the artichokes pretty small b/c I wasn't sure if my family would like them - they loved this, great as leftovers, too!  Hubby highly recommended it!

I used bottled artichoke hearts instead of canned,  and the diced tomatoes had onion and garlic instead of peppers.  My family doesn't care for peppers.  We loved it!  Tasted like eating out! Easy to make too.

This was a nice change of pace chicken recipe.  In addition to the salt and pepper I added a bit of dried tarragon to the chicken.  Like other reviewers, I did use marinated artichoke hearts rather than those in water.  Also added a clove of minced garlic to the diced tomatoes.  Served with pasta and a salad, but I think couscous would be even better as the sauce doesn't really stick to the pasta.  Will definitely make again.

When I made this dish, I sliced the chicken and dusted it in seasoned flour, then browned and followed the recipe otherwise. We love the flavor. Also, I have made it as a vegetable to serve with the meal(omitting the chicken).

I made the recipe as stated and it was very good however i don't think this serves 4 at least not if you're eating it just on its own. It tastes exactly as the name states.

I used two 10 oz. cans of Rotel diced tomatoes  (w/green chiles), which gave the dish a nice amount of "kick".  I used more than 1/2 cup of a combination of basil pesto & sun dried tomato pesto.  I also included some garlic and used marinated artichoke hearts.  I mixed it with penne pasta (about 12 oz.) prior to serving.  It was very good!

Easy and excellent as is!  Even my picky 15-year-old son liked it.  One thing I did that's different is swapping in sun-dried tomatoes and onion garlic peso for sun-dried tomato peso.  Most likely it was more flavorful and added needed texture (beyond the artichokes).  Net/net, though, it's great!

This is a simple easy delicious recipe I have made often. It is hard to explain how fabulous the canned artichokes make this dish.  While the recipe is very good as is I use canned San Marzano tomatoes and sauteed peppers  more often than not. I also like to add fresh basil and garlic.

Awesome! I love that this is fairly quick to make. I had it on the dinner table in under 30 minutes and had everything cleaned up. I only made two changes. I had a bunch of garden tomatoes to use so I chopped up two tomatoes and a little red onion as opposed to the canned diced tomatoes. I also doubled the pesto that the recipe called for. Served with rice and it was great!

We loved it!  Extremely easy and just the right blend of acidity from the tomatoes and great texture with the artichokes.  The chicken was incredibly tender.  I had some leftover white rice that I served with it and it was delicious after soaking up some of the juices.  This is a keeper.

This was a great starting base =) I am always looking for recipes that have ingredients that I have in my kitchen. I thought this sounded bland as well so I also adjusting things. I had canned tomatos with pepper, onion & celery and I added the sun-dried pesto. Instead I used marinated artichoke hearts since I had it for another recipe which I am sure adds a difference.. before cooking the chicken I cooked some onion with parsley & Oregeno & powder garlic (I am allergic to garlic itself, powder is all I can have) then added my bite-sized chicken and followed the recipe the same. Since this makes a great sauce I added it ontop of linguini to finish AWESOME.

Like others have said...pretty boring, but easy to doctor up.  I cut up the chicken, added a red sauce and threw it in with some pumpkin ravioli.

Good as is but better with tweaks (as many have suggested).  Cube the chicken before you saute with garlic, onions, red pepper flakes and herbs.  I could only find crushed tomatos with green peppers, onions and celery but it worked out great.  Also, couldn't find sun-dried pesto so got sun-dried garlic (don't like pesto anyway).  I marinated frozen artichokes with my own recipe (this takes up more time so buy them pre-marinated if you can) and served over orzo (or pasta).  Yummy. 5+ stars with tweaks.

My honey loved this. I did add some fresh mushrooms and a small can of black olives. All the flavors melded together. This is one recipe I wont loose.

I found this to not have much flavor.  I think it is the foundation of a good recipe but needs some more spices.

Wonderful, I cooked mine longer and used bone in-thighs because thats what i had, used extra pesto, and added some yellow onions and garlic before browing the chicken. Very good.

This was very good. I only had plain diced tomatoes on hand so I chopped some onion and garlic and sauted it before adding the tomatoes. I also added a couple tablespoons of red wine and about a teaspoon of Italian seasoning.

Quick and easy meal. Iserved the chicken and sauce over penne, and I used a bit more pesto for more flavor.

This dish was absolutly wonderful.  I changed it a little due to what others said.  I cooked some onions and garlic in the pan and then added and cooked the chicken.  I also used 1/2c of the sun dried tomato pesto.  We absolutly loved this dish!!! Thanks so much!!!!

This recipe is really good, quick and easy.  It is nice served with linguine or fettucine.  I would not say it was spectacular, but quite tasty and a good choice when you need a fast last minute meal.

As long as you like artichoke hearts you'll enjoy this sumple recipe.  We've made this many times and always add extra hearts.  It's a yummy recipe I can always make if I have nothing else in mind.  Hope you enjoy it as much as we do.

This was sooooooo good!!! Instead of artichokes I added half an onion (sliced), zucchini for color, mushrooms and garlic. Before adding the can of diced chicken, I sauteed all the veggies and then poured the tomatoes in with the pesto mixture. Since I didn't have sun-dried tomatoe pesto...I chopped up sun-dried tomatoes from a jar and mixed it with pesto from a jar and it was perfect!!! I will definitely make this again!!

I followed the recipe as specified (except that I halved it for 3 breast halves) and found the sauce to be very watery and the chicken rather dry.  The flavor was good, and my husband liked it, but it definitely needs something more.  I served with pasta and zucchini.

I'm so disappointed in this recipe.  It just wasn't very good, especially based on the great reviews it has received.  I followed the directions closely and added a little garlic, but it was mushy, bland and didn't go over well at my house.

Fantastic!  Tasted restaurant quality.  One of my new favorites and will be making it again and again.  Only problem I had was some of the artichoke hearts had tough leaves.  Will check that more closely next time.  Served over angel hair pasta.  Next time I will double the sauce to have more of the yummy goodness to eat with the pasta.

Loved this!!  Definitely one to add to my collection of great recipes.  I used marinated artichoke hearts and Rotel tomatoes for a kick.  I cut the chicken into bite sized chunks and thinned out the sauce with chicken stock.  Served over angel hair pasta.  Can't wait for leftovers. :)

LOVED this recipe.  Perfect dish on summer nights.  The leftoveres were even fabulous.  I did make a few adjustments and used regular pesto and added sun-dried tomatoes.  We served it over spinach pasta and loved every bite!

Tasted good, but not for the money.  This is an expensive meal.  There are better chicken recipes out there that are more affordable.

This one of the best chicken dishes I have tried.  Very quick and easy to make.  I cut the chicken into bite sized pieces for a quicker cooking time and served with penne pasta.

A whole lot of flavour for very little effort.  This chicken dish was so easy to prepare and the aroma was wonderful! Since my family isn't overly fond of artichoke hearts, I may add some kalamata olives in their place next time.
