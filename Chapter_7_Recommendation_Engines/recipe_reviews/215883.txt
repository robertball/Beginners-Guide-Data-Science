I made this using ground turkey instead of sausage to cut down a little on fat. I also made my own tomato sauce, and added some parmesan and an egg to the ricotta, then layered the whole thing like you would lasagna. I really liked the ease of assembly, versus lasagna which takes forever. I froze part of it for later, and it froze wonderfully. Such a good, easy casserole that can be made ahead of time. I adjusted seasonings a lot to suit our tastes, and used fresh garlic and onion, but the idea was the same. Thanks!

YES! So yummy. Make it!
Few changes I made: Add chopped onion, garlic and green pepper to the (hot italian) sausage when browning. Also used fresh basil in the sauce instead of dried. That's it.
So freakin' good, I will definitely make this again - in place of boring old pasta and sauce.

Yum!  I'm lazy and left the casing on, sliced the sausage, cut down on the cheese (only because we were short - we LOVE cheese around here), and used fresh basil instead of dried, and it was awesome!  I think it would have been just as good if I had made it per the recipe.  Easy, filling crowd pleaser!

Great recipe, I love Classico sauces! I did add egg to ricotta mix with some Italian seasonings and used ground beef instead of sausage. I think next time I will mix a little ground beef and sausage together. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious, easy and just the right amount of seasoning.  My boyfriend and family loved it.  I was unsure about using the Classico sauce but it was as good as homemade.  I used fresh basil instead of dried.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

I made this dish for my Bunco group last night.
They all raved about it and I had to print off
copies for everyone!  The only thing I would do differently next time would be to lay a piece of foil on top of the pan next time I bake it.  My cheese got kind of dark.  Could have been my oven.

This was the first time I've ever cooked ziti and I'll say it was farely easy. This recipe was good, the only thing I changed was that I added half sausage half ground beef. Also while browing the meat, I added garlic, onion and green bell peppers. Tasty

This recipe was fantastic. Everyone gave it a five and wants me to make it again. I added some more spices and some parmesan cheese along with the mozzarella.

Used sliced sausage sauteed with diced onion because that is what we had on hand.  Next time, we would put some oregano, garlic, and red pepper flakes.

This was very good and much easier than lasagna.  I cooked the sausage (Jimmy Dean original0 with onion and garlic. I thought the 2 jars of sauce was a lot and my pan was almost overflowing.  However, the noodles soaked up the sauce.  Next time I would only cook 3/4 of the box of pasta so it was a little saucier.

Very good.  Next time I'll definitely up the amount of ricotta because some parts were a bit dry.  But other than that, perfect.

I found this recipe today and wanted to cook something different from the usual meals I make.  I must say this was a quick and easy meal and tasted great.  I did use italian chicken sausage instead of regular pork sausage and I used parmesan cheese instead of ricotta cheese and it turned out great.  Everyone loved it and I have plenty left for tomorrow.

I used penne instead of ziti because that's what I had. I added more than just a pinch of salt and pepper. I also added minced garlic and finely chopped onions. Very good. Will make again. Thanks for the recipe.

Very good and easy recipe!.  I used gluten free pasta, Low Fodmap spaghetti sauce and ground beef instead of sausage since I avoid onion and garlic seasoning and it really turned out fabulous!  Highly recommend!

Made this as directed but used 88% lean ground beef. Tastes a lot like a meat lasagna. Great for a large meal with a tasty salad.

I liked the recipe enough, but it lacks something to make it a 5 stars recipe.  I will make again and tweak it somehow to make it better.  I will let y'all know when I figure it out.   Also, I used hot Italian sausage, because it make everything better.  Make sure to use a big 9 x13 pan because it makes a lot.

I did not change much in the way of ingredients. My changes were in the way it was put together. I mixed the sour cream with the noodles. I mixed the meat in the sauce. I did not have provolone so used mozzarella and Parmesan. I will make this again and try it with the provolone. My family loved it.

This....was awesome. Tasted close to lasagna, and better than some lasagna's I've had lol. Pretty to make. I used cottage cheese because it was cheaper, and it still turned out great. Will be making it again. To try and make it a little healthier I used ground turkey and seasoned it heavily like a sausage is and it did the job great.

This was so good. I adjusted the servings to 6, so we would have leftovers. I got 4 meals out of it & Kraig got 3! 
I added died tomatoes, 1 can of mushrooms, and half a bag of frozen peas. I started doing the layering but then when i got to the end and realized i needed to open up that second jar of pasta sauce and poured it on top, i kind of stirred everything up. it doesn't stay in a layer anyways so that's kind of pointless. I also substituted cottage cheese for ricotta cheese - which we like better anyways, plus it's healthier!

Delish! Used hot sausage and fresh basil & parsley. Sent a big tray of this back to College with my son and his roommates raved about it! Great meal and can be doubled easily to feed a large crowd. Will be making this again and again!!

I make this with all the ingredients as listed, yes even the sauce in a jar. I do however add a little more than just a dash of salt and pepper to the ricotta mix. To keep this easy I mix the pasta and ricotta together and the sausage and sauce before assembly.

Used this site for years, but it's first time I'm rating. My kids loves it so much, they requested it for their bday dinners ! And I didn't have ricotta, used more mozzarella. Great and simple recipe.
