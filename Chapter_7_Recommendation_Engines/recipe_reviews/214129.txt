I use the same ingredents but different ratio.  To much water - With my changes its 5 stars -  I use the can of limeade; then add - half a can of tequila; half a can of T.S; and half a can of water.  Pour over ice in a salt rimmed glass then add a little Ameretto.  YUMMY

Limey, luscious, sweet but still tart and NOT FROZEN!  This is perfect--I didn't add salt or extra lime but some of my guests did (also scaled back the water.  Next time I will turbo charge the flavor--omit the water and use light beer.  To make it sweeter, substitute the water for lemon lime soda.

I cut back the water by one "can". I think it could have been cut back by another "can" and been perfect. I will try that next time and re-review. As is, my husband drank the whole pitcher in a couple hours. NOTE: Keep the pitcher in the fridge to keep the ice from melting as fast.

Made for a party and it was a hit . . .

1 (12 fluid ounce) can frozen limeade concentrate 
•  1 and 3/4 (12 fluid ounce) cans cold water.
•  3/4 (12 fluid ounce) can tequila 
• about 1/2 (12 fluid ounce) can Orange Triple Sec

Delicious!

Quick, easy, tastes great.  I have made this for years and love the author's choice of name for her recipe ?  I prefer this recipe when I add juice from 1 fresh squeezed lime and cut back water to 2 cans, but I have made it both ways and it's always a big hit.  Depends on my guests preferences, many people prefer the lighter version with more water as written.
