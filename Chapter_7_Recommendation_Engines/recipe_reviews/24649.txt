This is really fast, easy and it has a great flavor...I entertain a lot due to my line of work and this is usually the first thing that's gone....Great for parties or just a nite at home snacking.

I was disappointed in this recipe.  It seemed to have all of the components of a great dip, but was bland to the taste and was not much of a hit at our office get-together.  It makes me wonder if I did something wrong, as it seems that everyone else finds it to be wonderful...

I t ried this recipe for a post Thanksgiving party, and was very dissapointed>It seemed to sweet with the seafood sauce. I added some Old Bay and that helped a bit.My guests ate a bit to be polite, but I ended up with pretty much a full bowl of leftovers.Will not make this way again.Maybe I will leave out the seafood sauce altogether, and try again.A waste of ingredients in my opinion....

This is so good - used 1 lb lump crab meat, and followed the rest of the recipe accordingly.  Put dip in phyllo cups.

I made this for a football game party at our house. It was good and everyone liked it, including myself. The only thing I can say I needed, was extra cocktail sauce. It would have been nice to put more on after the initial layer was gone...lol

This is easy and good instead of two pkgs cream cheese I used 6 oz seafood sauce and then put the remaining 1/2 over top.

I tried this dip, because it sounded a lot like one I used to make that was very good. (spread a pkg. softened cr. cheese on serving plate, cover with cocktail sauce, sprinkle a can of crab meat or sm. shrimp over sauce, serve with crackers) I guess I don't like everything mixed together. Much prefer it layered.

This is a great recipe, I have been making one like it for years, to make even better, use Helmanns mayo add a squeeze of Lemon juice, add 1/2 cup diced scallions and 1/2 cup mall dices red or green peppers and 1/2 teaspoon of Worcester sauce, layer cheese mixture, on top of cheese add cocktail sauce and on top of that the fresh picked crab meat.  Let chill for several hours...best ever!!!

This is the best Crab Dip I have ever had.  Made it for my daughters baby shower and everyone wanted a copy of the recipe.  I'm making again tonight just to have on hand for the family to munch on....AWESOME!!!!
