Yum!  How can you go wrong with bacon, blue cheese and garlic?  I ended up with 5 slices of bacon after breakfast this morning so I used them and I don't think I had as much blue cheese as called for in the recipe.  I also did not return them to the oven to broil after the garlic butter was added.  These are very good and will be made again.  I think they would be good with chopped green onion mixed in too.
