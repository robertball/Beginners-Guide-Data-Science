5 stars! When I read the title of this recipe I said "oh, come on! What's the point?"  Then I tasted it and promise you that this will be my go to pumpkin pie for the holidays. No one noticed it was eggless or dairy free. It sets just like a regular pie. It tastes rich and creamy just like your mom's pumpkin pie.  I used firm, silken tofu and coconut sugar because I couldn't find vegan white sugar.  After turning down the temperature, it only needed 40 minutes in the oven. An easy, fool-proof, decadent, guilt-free pie. Excellent recipe. Thank you.

This is was a hit at my Friendsgiving party! Bunch of people had allergies so I had to find a gluten free dairy free way to enjoy pumpkin pie. Everyone loved it! I omitted the cloves and added a little extra vanilla extract. It required a little more baking time in my oven. Will make again!

I loved this pie! With food allergies and sensitivities, I often go for gluten-free vegan alternatives, but have been afraid to with my holiday favorite, pumpkin pie. But I haven't eaten it in years, and this recipe looked easy enough. Like another reviewer, I used firm silken tofu and coconut sugar. But instead of the spices recommended, I used a tablespoon of my homemade pumpkin spice. It took a little longer to bake after turning the temperature down, but my oven is often like that. And I used a crust from frozen, so it wasn't fully baked through. HOWEVER, this was delicious. I made it for Thanksgiving, and everyone had two slices. Can't wait to make this again
