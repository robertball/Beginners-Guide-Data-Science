This was delicious when fresh.  Very flavorful. Good as leftovers the second day, however bacon tends to get a little soggy.  Second time I made used roasted pine nuts, and sprinkled the bacon and nuts on each serving so bacon was not soggy as a leftover.  The pine nuts were an excellent substitute for the almonds.

I used 4 tablespoons of Bac-o s instead of the actual bacon because I am a vegetarian, but it's also healthier and makes the prep time shorter. But if going to use baco s instead of real bacon, only add it right before serving because otherwise they get mushy, and don't taste good. I also used light mayonnaise and added some raisins.  It came out great.

This recipe was recommended to me by a co-worker who makes it every year for Christmas.  I also made it for Christmas dinner.  Wow!  It is awesome.  I got many compliments.  I do agree with others who state that it is time consuming but it is well worth it.  I used 2 1/2 heads of broccoli and doubled everything but the sugar, bacon and nuts to lower the calories.  There is no need to use so much sugar as the grapes give the salad the sweetness needed.  This recipe will definitely join my favourites.

This is a fantastic salad. Definitely main dish material! The maple flavored bacon is a nice touch. The red grapes and almonds add a nice flavor, too. I think best if allowed to chill for 3-4 hours before serving. Gets kind of mushy if not used up within 48 hours, I think.

This is a great broccoli salad. I made it for poker night and the guys loved it. I only used one pound of bacon though and put them in right before serving to keep them from getting soggy.

I have been making this recipe for over almost a year and EVERYONE loves it.  Everyone time I make it someone asks for the recipe.  I usually use 2 heads of broccoli.

This was a very tasty salad that, as suggested, turned into a meal in itself!!  I ate it for supper last night, breakfast and lunch today - yummy!  There is just the right blend of crunchy with tangy and the tastes were very complementary.  I used maple bacon and green grapes and it was delicious.  My husband generally isn't a big broccoli fan and really, really like this one too.  It's a keeper.

Wow!   This was a huge hit at my husband's 40th Birthday Party/BBQ!    Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe before they would leave.   I came down to my computer and printed off 12 copies for guests to take home!

I have to admit, though, it was a bit time consuming.   However, the end definitely justified the means!

Excellent, yummy, love the stuff. The only changes I made were using 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream instead of a whole cup of mayo, since I don't like the mayo taste too much. I also only use one pound of bacon, and that is plenty of bacon flavor.

This was my submission to Allrecipes several years ago. A friend told me to look this up because the recipe is in error. Somewhere along the line, my 1 pound of bacon was changed to 2 pounds. My original submission was written as one pound. Two pounds is way too much. Sorry for any inconvenience.

I made this dish and took to a church gathering - everyone loved it, guys too. I prepared exactly per the recipe except I used 1-1/2 heads of broccoli and 1 lb of bacon and lowfat mayo. To shorten prep time, I washed and cut up all the veggies the night before which gave them time to dry out. I agree with other views, definitely a keeper.

Great salad! I added raisins for the chewy texture, and used sunflowers instead of almonds. I also kept the bacon and the sunflowers in separate containers to use as toppings each time I ate some. I got away with 1 pound bacon. I CRAVE this salad.

Absolutely delicious!  I substituted raisins for the grapes, and did half mayo and half wasabi mayo to add a little kick.  Oh, and I used apple cider vinegar instead of white.  YUMMY!

This is exactly the same salad I have always coveted at the local country club. Now I know how to make it. I'm a little bothered by the idea of adding sugar to a salad, but it tastes good, and it's a heaping serving of veggies, so I can live with it. The club sometimes uses raisins instead of grapes which is also really good. I used regular bacon and it was delicious.

This recipe is delicious.  Sometimes I change it up by using only 1 lb. of bacon crumbled, and adding 8 oz. bow tie pasta.  I also change the vinegar to 1/3 cup red wine vinegar.  Don't forget to add the nuts and bacon just before serving, this way it still has crunch.

Excellent, with the following changes: 4-5 strips of lean, cooked turkey bacon chopped (2 lbs of bacon is just too much, and you can save on the fat content), I substituted a mix (that I found already packaged together) of dried raisins and cranberries for the grapes, used both a little red and green onion (I eyeball everything, don't usually measure), used the new olive oil mayo that is on the market, (low fat and better for you), kept the dressing measures as is (but used cider vinegar to cut the tart), and substituted some cashew peices for the almonds (I bought a cheap tin of broken pieces and toasted them slighly in the oven). Everything else, I kept the same. This was so good! My husband raved and usually passses on raw broccoli. This is delish and good for you if you make a couple of variations! My version is very similar to that of Sweet Tomatoes restaraunt. Thanks for the great recipe!

Great recipe, but I made a few modifications to make it healthier.  First off, I used splenda instead of "white sugar" and halfed the amount called for.  Second I used fat free mayo, and i know fat free mayo is not all that great but you honestly cant taste the differance since it is mixed with the vinegar, and splenda.  I have tried this recipe both ways and my kids had no idea i was using fat free mayo.  And depending on your preference, I omit the celery and used shredded carrots.  LOVE IT!!

This was a hit today for 4th of July! I made it low carb by using splenda instead of white sugar. Used 3 packages of precleaned broccoli and needed more dressing. Made half batch more dressing. Served 12-15. Yum!Chose to leave out the celery and used honey roasted slivered almonds found in the salad fixin section! Quick and easy to prepare. Used only 1 lb bacon. Next time I'll try adding dried cranberries. A winner!

Excellent recipe and very easy to make, I did not have any almonds so I toasted some pecans instead and threw in some dried cranberries, I cut back on the sugar about half and half the mayo and thought it was excellent.  Recommend this one highly!

Yum!  I just made this and adjusted a few things for my cupboard family's taste like:  I used pecans (it's what I had on hand) and red delicious apples instead of grapes.  I also only used the green onion and left the red out.  It probably made the salad a little more sweet than the original recipe would, but it was delicious!  Thanks for sharing.  I'll definitely be making this again.  It seems like a great dish to take to a get together, too.

We serve this dish often. I would only use 1/2 pound bacon. Its plenty- don't substitute for bacon bits. It is not the same.

I have been looking for a broccoli salad recipe for awhile and stumbled across this one.  I have made this salad a few times and everyone has RAVED about it!! There is a lot of prep time involved but soo worth it! I haven't used maple bacon yet (hard to find) but regular bacon has worked just fine.

This salad was delicious. Next time I will add the bacon just before serving.  It did get a little soggy.  But other than that we loved it!  Thank you!

Easy to half the recipe for a family dinner.  I used apple cider vinegar.  I made the salad ahead of time (about 4 hours prior to dinner) but did not add bacon, almonds nor grapes til serving time. I toasted the almonds on the stove top by putting them in a pan over med high heat and stirring them frequently til browned up a bit

It tastes fresh and delicious. I sticked to the recipe except cut half of the sugar. The flavors of bacon, vegi, fruit and nut blended surprisingly well. Next time I will substitute yogurt for mayonnaise and cut off 3/4 sugar and 1/2 bacon, just to make it healthier. Thanks very much for the recipe!

Yummy, but I made some changes.  I didn't use nearly as much bacon as called for (I probably only used 1/2 lb.) and I used more red onion.  Instead of grapes and almonds I used craisins and toasted walnuts.  It was a huge hit with my Thanksgiving guests.

Very good recipe, especially for a large gathering.  I did not use bacon, because this was a side dish.  I also substituted the almonds for pine nuts and sunflower seeds.  A hit with everyone.  This is in my recipe box!

I used to make a salad similar to this one, but lost the recipe when I moved.  I leave out the celery and green onion and use sunflower kernels instead of the almonds.  I use half the bacon and add more broccoli.  It's delicious and I am always asked for the recipe.

This was delicious! I used Splenda, light mayo and turkey bacon, and it was still amazing. My husband and daughter both loved it. I'm going to make it for a party this weekend. Thank you!

This salad has an excellent combination of flavors.  I was surprised that I actually liked it.  I think the bacon is what made it so good.  I used turkey bacon and didn't use the red onion (too much onion).  I also used light mayo.  I think you can get away with using half the amount of sugar, since the grapes make it sweet enough.

Fabulous salad and I will make it again.  I brought it to a potluck and everyone asked for the recipe so thank you for sharing. I substituted bacon bits (instead of maple bacon) and sunflower seeds instead of almonds.  I also added raisins and cut down  on the mayonnaise mixture.  I used light mayo to save on the calories.

This is absolutely delicious!!!!  My entire family enjoyed it...even my young, picky daughters.  I have made a recipe similar to this but it will definitely be replaced.  I loved the addition of the grapes, and next time I may add some crumbled blue cheese or feta.  This is a keeper!

i've been making this recipe for years! countless people ask for the recipe.  to cook the bacon quicker/more efficiently, i cut it into 3/4 inch pieces first.  also, i've recently started substituting the sugar with "truvia" since it's a natural sugar substitute :)

What an AWESOME Salad. I made it for Christmas Eve, Christams day, and for the day after Christmas for three different get togethers. The first day I made it exactly as stated except for using roasted soy nuts instead of almonds as my son is allergic to peanuts and tree nuts. Excellent!  The second day I substituted a head of iceberg lettuce for the celery as I am not a big fan of the taste of celery but I liked the crunch it gave the salad. Also, all I had on hand this day was turkey bacon and it was delicious in the salad. This turned out excellent as well.  The third day I doubled the recipe and it came out great. I only used two packages of bacon when I doubled the recipe. And the first two days I used one package each. I don't believe one package is 2lbs of meat, but one package is more than enough in this rich salad!  Thank you so much for an awesome recipe Maggie!!!

This is a great dish.  It was easy to prepare, although frying 2 lbs of bacon can take a bit of time depending on your circumstances.  It was a great hit at the party I took it too.

This salad is the best!  The only thing I did differently was that I used honey in substitute for the sugar to improve the nutrition.  We also kept the bacon separate to add to each serving as per other reviewers recommendations.  Absolutely delectable!  TY so much for posting, we will be making this salad again and again!

My #1 potluck salad!   No celery...and use pre-cooked thin bacon, crisped in mike! so easy  Best advice is to add bacon nuts and graps or craisins before serving. Ages WELL!

I left out the almonds, didn't think they were necessary. Even the picky eating kids scoffed it down. Cooking and crumbling the bacon was the difficult part, I was wondering if store bought real bacon bits would make prep easier. Just a thought. Still, this is a great tasting recipe.

Excellent. lasts on a buffet table nicely. Got lots of compliments and requests for this recipe the times I've made it. Definitely give salad few hours or overnight so flavors develop. I also used light mayo and not quite as much bacon. Almonds are optional. At Christmas  open house I added Craisins instead of grapes. Try cooking bacon in oven for easier prep.

Whoops! didn't have bacon like I thought I did, but it was still a very good salad.  I only used about 2/3 cup mayo and adjusted  the sugar and vinegar accordingly.  My red onion was a bit strong, but that's not the recipe's fault.  Very yummy.

This salad is amazingly delicious! I felt that the original recipe sounded slightly too high calorie so I made the following changes: - I used plain yogurt instead of the mayonnaise - no sugar - no bacon - balsamic vinegar instead of the white vinegar (that's all I had)  With these changes the salad was not only delicious but also healthy!

WOW is this dish yummy!  If you love onions you will love this.  The prep work does take time especially if you do not use a food processor.  I will add a few less red onions next time and increase the amount of dressing just a tad.  I actually thought this was delicious right after I assembeled it!  It is a very hearty salad and as the other reviewers noted can be a meal in itself.  I might add some chopped tart apple next time since this combination could handle that taste very well.  I highly recommend this to everyone that loves all the ingredients independently.  This dish is a WINNER!

Wow, this salad is absolutely yummy.  Made it for a birthday party and absolutely EVERYONE raved about it. The dressing is so easy and so yummy. I will be making this lots over summer. Family have already asked me to make for Christmas day. I used Walnuts instead of the almonds.
Loved It, Loved It, Loved It....

This was fabulous! I only used half the amount of bacon this recipe called for, but, otherwise followed it to a "T". It was really great and enjoyed by all. I'll definately be making this again!Thanks!

I followed this recipe somewhat loosely (I didn't really measure the ingredients except the sugar and the vinegar).  I used about 3/4 lb of bacon and omitted the green onions (didn't have them on hand).  THIS WAS THE BOMB!!!  I loved it.  I will definately make it again.  I have enjoyed it for breakfast, lunch and dinner!

Yum Yum!  I put a little less grapes and added dried cranberries for that extra sweetness.  1 pd of bacon is just fine, and the red onion makes all the difference.

This is a very good recipe that you can make to suit your own taste.  I used dried cherries instead of grapes, and pecans(what I had on hand) instead of almonds. I thought one kind of onion(green) enough for us, and added shredded cheddar(love cheese!). Wow, couldn't stop eatin' it!

I have tried a lot of broccoli salads in my day and this one is by far the best tasting.  I am thinking of trading plain yogurt for the mayo next time to cut some fat. I think that would also taste great.

This is a great salad.  I used only 1 pound of bacon and it was great, but with the 2 pounds of bacon called for I think it would be even better.  I also used red wine vinegar instead of regular and it worked fine.  Amazing salad, love it!!!!!!!!!!!

Yep. It's that good. I omitted the grapes, as I don't like fruit in my salad.  Added some lettuce. Took this to a party and every single person loved it.  That mayo-vinegar-sugar dressing is addictive! Anyhow, you can't go wrong with this one.

Totally bastardized it based on fridge contents, and it still worked: 1) no green onions, just one red onion.  2) no celery.  3) smashed walnuts instead of almonds. 4) half the sugar.   delicious!

This salad is so good and is so variable, my mother gave me the basic recipe about 40 years ago (without the grapes).  Now I make it just like this but with 1 pound of bacon instead of two.  It's not a very healthy salad but is just fine as a side at a BBQ when you're only eating about 3/4 of a cup, a couple of times a year.  It's a dish to look forward to, definitely not a rotation dish unless you want a heart attack by the time you're 35!

i love this salad, but I have to "diabetic-up" every recipe I eat.  Found a really good no-sugar-added poppy seed dressing and added 1/3 cup to all these ingredients (only a pound of turkey bacon ... I know ... I don't have a choice)  and added a honey crisp apple to give it just a little more body.  Dee-licious and FAST!

I've tried a lot of broccoli salad recipes.  Each one has had their own "secret" ingredient.  We really enjoyed this one, with the grapes being the different ingredient for us.  It lended the sweet/sour flavoring with an extra sweet side with the grapes.  I'll definitely be making this one again!

One of my favourite salads to make and whenever I take it to a potluck there is never any leftover!  It's great just as the recipe states - a good mix of flavours with the bacon, the sweetness from grapes, and the tartness of the dressing plus the extra crunch from the almonds.  I've also made it using raisins instead of grapes and walnuts or pine nuts instead of almonds.  Red or yellow peppers are also a great addition if you want to make it a really colourful salad.

I tried this and it is very good.  It is very similar to another recipe I have.  It is a great recipe as it is, but I didn't have any almonds so I substituted sunflower seeds.  I was in a hurry and I also substituted Real Bacon bits for the bacon.  A great thing to do if your pressed for time, or just sometimes lazy like me.  Doesn't make the mess either!!  Oh and I added Golden raisins too, which is in my recipe that I normally use.  Just another little sweetness, that is great for you also!!  Great salad!!

Delicious! A family member made this for Thanksgiving and I had to request the recipe. Made it two days later to take to another get together.. Definitely a hit. I used 1.5lbs of bacon instead of 2, and I still thought it was a bit too much - next time I'll lower it to 1lb. Delicious either way, but might as well pull out a little bacon to health it up ;)

This was good but I feel it has to much sugar and to much bacon and I only used 1 pound. I don't know if I would make this again.

Very yummy salad, everyone liked it, I only used 1 lb. of bacon becuase it looked like so much and I think if I had used the 2 lbs. it would have been.

Only used 1 lb bacon and forgot to buy green onions so didn't include them, but this salad was terrific. What an interesting (and good)combination of textures and flavors.  Everyone wanted the recipe. Will definitely make again and again.

This was great!  I took it to our Ladies Salad Supper at church around Christmas, and I made the amount that the recipe made.  The lady in charge of it all got on the microphone after the dinner and said, "Whoever made the broccoli salad with the grapes and almonds - you will be bringing this again next year, and you will make about 3 times the amount!"  Everyone applauded!  It was gone before half of the people made it through the line!  Many of the people that did get to eat it were asking for the recipe!

I have made this salad twice and it is OUT OF THIS WORLD!  The ingredients sounded funny at first, but whatever...it works!  I served it with shrimp and it went rather well.  There was nothing left after my dinner party was through.

I loved this!  I followed the recipe exactly as stated.  It was so good to me.  My hubby didn't like it and a couple of others didn't love it like I did, but there were a couple who ooo-ed and aaaah-ed over it like I did.  I don't think it'll win everyone's hearts.

SOOO YUMMY!! My family has used a variation of this recipe for many years~in ours we add 1cup of sliced water chestnuts, 1.5 cups bean sprouts.  We omit the red onion and use only green onion (don't want too much onion taste).  Definitely try this recipe!  It's a great combination of ingredients :)

Really a refreshing salad - perfect mix of sweet and crunchy.  My sister-in-law has been making a similar recipe for a few years now, so I was excited to stumble across this one.  It absolutely lived up to my expectations.  I omit the almonds due to allergies, and substitute bacon for real bacon bits, purely for convenience.  Otherwise I follow the recipe, and it is always a hit!  Thanks Maggie!

This is a great recipe.  For me it is a little easier to bake the bacon.  The instructions were on the back of the package. Just check it frequently so it doesn't burn. I also decreased the bacon to one pound and for us it was still plenty. I also used a little less sugar. The only other changes based on availability  were to use green grapes and green onions.  Omitted the red onion. This recipe is so versitile I think it can be changed many ways and still be delicious.  Thanks Maaggie

I left out the bacon to save a few dollars since I was making it for a large family gathering and everyone loved. People keep asking me for the recipe. My family asks me to make it every time we get together.

Yum Yum Yum, This was a big hit.  I did use green grapes (they were on sale) and turkey bacon and no almonds (nut allergy).  I highly recommend.

Wonderful!!  I only use 1/4 - 1/2 of the dressing and add in the bacon only when it is time to eat the salad.  The bacon doesn't sit in the fridge well.  Bacon Bits are a good alternative.

This is a hit every time I take it to a function.  Everyone wants the recipe.  Must remember to bring copies with me next time I make it.  I don't use as many onions, I use half of what is called for in the recipe.  Other than that I wouldn't change anything.

WOW! better than I thought it would be. Not usually a fan of nuts in my food, the almonds added a wonderful crunch. I reduced the recipe to 5 servings and I would say it provided about 3 main mean portions. I used a whole pound of bacon for the 5 servings. I only let it sit for about 30 minutes before eating and it was just fine. I had some more a few hours later and I thought it tasted basically the same.

I used ham in place of bacon & LOVE IT! Also cut the sugar in half, the grapes make it sweet enough.

YUMMY.  I usually prefer my broccoli cooked but this salad is so awesome I can't quit making it. I followed the recipe exactly the 1st time & after that I made some minor changes based on personal preference.  I don't alter the dressing but I do omit the celery, grapes, almonds & onions. What I add to the broccoli is some halved cherry tomatoes, shredded extra sharp cheddar cheese & store bought real bacon bits then I refrigerate it a few hours or overnight to let flavors blend & oh my goodness it is so delicious. You can mix & match the ingredients & it still comes out great. I've even diced & added some leftover chicken to make it meal. Thanks for this recipe Maggie ... it's truly a winner  !!!

I seldom make anything by the recipe the first time simply cause I use what I have and don't make special trips to the store. So here I used red onion, broccoli (florets so no chopping) red grapes (whole) the dressing and bacon (added last to avoid softening). Skipped the celery and green onions and nuts cause I was out. Had only 1/2 c mayo so added 1/2 c coleslaw dressing only 1 tablespoon sugar and 1/4 c vinegar. Letting it sit in refridge for an hour to macerate/blend. Tasted a floret and it is yummy- Thanks for the inspiration!! Serving with Sausages and sliced tomato's

I only used one pound of bacon.  Took it to a party and it was a big hit.  There was very little left at the end of the evening.

We usually love broccoli salad. We changed a few things such as decreasing bacon to 1 lb., adding extra broccoli, and using 1/2 cup mayo & 1/2 cup Greek yogurt for making the dressing. Perhaps these changes influenced the outcome but 2 lbs. of bacon seems way over the top.

Used 1 package of bacon, 1 package of broccoli.  Added 4 to 6 tablespoons of milk to the dressing to thin it out, and maybe could have used a little more- only used around 1/2 of the total volume of dressing for the salad.  Mixed all together for several hours (3-4) but then stirred in the bacon and almonds just before serving.

I have been making something similar for years and years. The one I make has cauliflower in it along with the broccoli and it also calls for shredded cheddar cheese. A lot of times I don't even add the bacon and I don't put in grapes or nuts. Sometimes I'll add raisins.

Wow, was this ever a delicious salad!

Made a couple of changes: used green grapes instead of red (they were awesome), used a bit less sugar, and doubled it up. Everyone devoured it. 

Really nice flavors in this one!

08-06-16 ~ A nice change from regular broccoli salad. I made as written only using 1-pound of bacon rather than two. I took this to the lake to be served with BLT's. Everyone like it and the leftovers held up well for two days. Always a plus in my book.

Perfect!   The most amazing Broccoli Salad I've ever made!   The only thing I  left out was the nuts because the Hubs doesn’t like them in stuff....so I put them on the side.

Excellent salad!  Because I was entertaining a guest with dairy allergies, I substituted the mayonnaise with veginaise.  Will make again!  Maybe not so much :-)

Love this salad! Although I use veggie bacon instead of real bacon because pigs are just too darn cute to eat. I will also use sunflowers in place of almonds at times.

This is an even better option on the traditional broccoli salad. I loved the fresh grapes and the toasted almonds as did my family and we ate it for a few days as leftovers and it was just as good.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVED it!

I highly recommend this recipe, it's so good!  I make a similar recipe with a few variations of this one but this recipe is even better.  It's so crunchy and all of the flavors blend so well.  I followed one reviewers advice and used bacon bits instead of the bacon.  Try it, you'll like it!

This was a great recipe!  I made it as is except for leaving out the bacon (I am a vegetarian).  It honestly is delicious!!!  I tried it about two hours after making it, and I bet it will be even better tomorrow.  Definitely will use this again as it is pretty healthy and easy to make.  Thanks!

Great recipe! My kids will not eat regular broccoli but for some reason they will eat this(probably because there is bacon in it). I used a bag of already cut up broccoli so that made prep time alot quicker.
