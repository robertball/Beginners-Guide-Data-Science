I took the advice that my fellow chefs offered and did the following: I mixed about 3/4 chunked red potatoes and 1/4 baby carrots; I used garlic oil instead of olive oil; I roasted them on heavy duty foil sprayed with Pam on a cookie sheet; I added fresh garlic, salt and pepper to the marinade; I marinated the veggies for a while first in the refrigerator; I sprinkled the top with seasoned salt and fresh ground pepper before I put it in the oven; I baked it at 350 for an hour tossing halfway through.  I didn't even realize that I had pulled out and opened a savory garlic and herb mixture instead of onion soup until I dumped it into the bag, but it was really good this way and worked really well with the meat I was serving.  My only complaint that it was a little wet still after an hour.  I might cut down on the oil next time, but I'm definitely making this all the time and experimenting with my flavors.  Yum!  Quick, easy and mess-free with foil.  We loved this.  NOTE: From now on when I make this I cook it for the first half hour at 350 degrees and then for 20 more minutes at 400 degrees.  It helps to make the potatoes nice and crispy, sweetens up the carrots and helps me get dinner on the table a little bit faster.  I've made this with the onion soup mix too.  My husband prefers that oniony taste, but we both love any version of this.  I make it all the time now.  SO EASY!!!!

The recipe is good but I use oregano, parsley, garlic, salt, and pepper this sprinkled on the potatoes instead of the onion soup is much more flavorful.

These potatoes are sooo good!  Instead of using a baking dish, I spread them out on a cookie sheet.  They came out crispy on the outside, and cooked perfectly.  Try these!

I make this recipe frequently and love it.  But folks, its simple please stop rating a recipe that you have taken apart and changed to your liking.  You arent helping others that are trying to see if this recipe is good for them.  If you make changes.....create your own recipe on here and let that get rated.

Great dish!!!  I needed to make potatoes for a "potluck" type dinner at a friends house and came across this recipe.  After reading most of the reviews, I followed some previous tips and did some of my own.  I used about 4 pounds of potatoes, and cut them into large wedges instead of just halving them.  Instead of the baking dish, I lined cookie sheets with foil and sprayed them with Pam.  (It is an easy clean up!) I did use the onion mix, and I used the 1/3 cup oil, b/c I had doubled the potatoes. (Other reviewers found that the oil used for the amount of potatoes called for turned out too greasy) I also added a little salt and pepper, rosemary, and a dash of italian seasoning.  I roasted them at 350 for a half hour and stirred them around every 15 minutes, then turned the oven up to 400 and roasted them another half hour, stirring every 15 min.  They turned out perfect - crispy on the outside, a little soft on the inside, not greasy at all.  My husband called them "amazing".  I am going to try them again tonight using a ranch dressing packet.

I read a lot of the reviews and the summary was- Crunch the onions up into smaller pieces, marinade the potatoes for 1 hour +, before baking top them with seasoned salt and pepper, stir them once while cooking, bake at 350 for one hour (I cooked them for 1.5 hours they were fine)and most important cover the bottom of the pan with heavy duty foil before cooking. They turned out good, they were definatly stuck to the bottom of the pan but clean up was a snap with the foil. My husband asked me to cut them into smaller pieces so they were crispier (I cut them into 12ths), even smaller they were still not overcooked. I did not save the leftovers - others said they didn't reheat well so no leftovers. They had plenty of flavor, they were able to wait till we were ready to eat and everyone liked them, I will make them again they were very easy - great for entertaining.

I thought this recipe was great!  Contrary to the few negative reviews I read, the onion soup mix did not burn at all, it didn't take very long to bake (I covered it with foil though - perhaps that was the difference) and it tasted wonderful!  It was so easy and quick and tasted great!  I would definitely recommend it!

When I went to try this I didn't realize I was out of  dry onion soup mix and didn't feel like running to the store, so substituted one pkg. of "Hidden Valley Ranch" dry dressing mix and this was awesome! Everybody loved it. Will try it as directed next time. Thanks for sharing.

With some doctoring, this was excellent. We wanted a more proportionate seasoning-potato ratio so I cut mine in to eighths. Remember to adjust your cooking temp if you do this. I did 20 minutes at 450 and 20 at 350. I also lined a cookie sheet with foil, and laid a baking rack on top of that and laid the potatoes skin side down on that so that the excess oil could run off and be caught in the cookie sheet. I too thought the recipe called for too much oil. For added flavor I added garlic and fresh rosemary. I sprinkled salt, pepper and parsley flakes over them after they were laid out. I also let the potatoes marinate in the seasonings for a while before baking. The end result was very delicious and though I doctored the recipe, I still give the original 5 stars as thanks for the inspiration. We had a few left overs and I just heated them in a dry skillet the next morning for breakfast--very yummy!

This was the worst recipe for roast potatoes I have ever tried. I have roasted potatoes for years with great success and wondered how the onion soup would keep from burning. Now I know. It burns to a crisp. I would nor recommend these. Just using olive oil sure saves on cleaning the pan and tstes much better.

this is very good and easy.  i did not grease my dish enough, so i had a nice mess!  the potatoes are very flavorful and easy to make.  be sure to cut the potatoes thin and be consistent with the thickness so they will cook evenly.

Great Recipe! I also read some of the reviews and this is what I do, I cut up Red Potatoes, and some Carrots into bite size pieces. I then put them aside, and then I crush up the onion soup mix into smaller bits. Then I pour the onion mix, tablespoon of fresh, minced garlic, Olive oil (enough for a wet maranade but not to drown the potatoes), then I add herbs, like Oregano, Parsley, Chives, etc. You mix it all together, then you mix and coat all of the potatoes. Foil the bowl, and marinate in the fridge for half an hour. Then pour the potatoes onto a Foiled, cookie sheet (You may spray it with pam if you feel you did not put enough olive oil). Then you bake it for 30 minutes at 350 degrees. Then you toss it, and cook it for about 20 minutes at 400 degrees, and viola! Absolutely delicious! :)

I have been making this recipe for some time & my family loves it!  It is a recipe that was included on the soup packet for years.   If you are making this for the 1st time, please don't feel the need to change & over-complicate it based on the other reviews.  It is meant to be easy & if you love the flavor of roasted onions & potatoes, you will love this.  I use  this dish in place of french fries.

I crush up the onion soup mix almost to a powder so nothing burns as many reviewers have complained about and I also let the potatoes marinate in the fridge with the oil and soup mix for an hour or so before cooking. My big change to the recipe though is to cut the potatoes into bite size pieces rather than in half. It gives them a lot more surface area to crisp up while cooking. For cooking them I dropped the temp to 400 and cooked them for an hour instead of 40 minutes, stirring them once. They come out crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and all around flavorful everytime!

So many people have said "this is a great recipe if you do this". I wish people would rate recipes as they are so we don't have to read the reviews to really see if the recipe is good or not.  This recipe is not good. There is too much oil and is cooked at too high of a temp for too long.  The onions came out burned, the potatoes were greasy, and the onion soup mix was overpowering for the small amour of potatoes.  The recipe alone, sucks, sorry. If you read others reviews on changes they made it will greatly improve the quality of your potatoes. Otherwise use a different recipe.

Very tasty & simple to make.  I did cut potatoes into quarters because I was in a hurry.  I also covered the glass baking dish with foil - I mistakenly thought the recipe called for doing so.  I believe it helped keep them moist and cook even faster.  Bottom line: it worked.  I will be making them again.

LOVE this one!  Since I try to avoid adding pre-mixed things, I made my own spice mix to put with potatoes.  Used cookie sheet instead and season with: oregano, parsley, garlic, salt, and pepper and other spices.  Use less oil.  Add baby carrots.  - COMES OUT SO YUM as a perfect side dish to anything!

Hearty, flavorful, and easy. I added baby carrots into the mix. **My secret tip is: line your pan with foil that has been crumpled up and then flattened back out when baking. Why? your veggies will get more crisp and stick less to the foil.** Donna, I am so glad you posted this recipe!

I read the other reviews before making them and they turned out delicious!!!  I only used 1/4 C evoo and that was plenty, and I replaced the onion soup mix for Good Seasonings Italian dressing and cooked at 350F for 45 min.  Excellent and EASY side dish!

Super easy and delicious!  I did what other suggested since I didn't have onion soup mix, I just sprinkled Oregano, Salt/Pepper, Garlic Powder, & Onion Powder enough to coat as well as just enough Olive Oil to coat. GREAT!  I also just covered a cookie sheet with foil to save the cleanup. I put the oven at 375 for about 50min. since my potatoes were smaller and had less than the recipe called for.

Meh. These were allright. My hubs liked these much more than I did (but he loves burnt tasting food lol). As is, this was a near flop for me, but a couple much needed modifications would significantly improve the outcome. I wish I would have read a few reviews beforehand. Had I thought about it, I would have marinated my potatoes for an hour or so. This would certainly have enhanced the overall flavor as well as softened the onion bits in the soup mix (these are what burned and smelled up my kitchen - yuck!). I also would have reduced the amount of oil called for. NOTE: I learned a trick for making crisp roasted potatoes a while ago. Simply rinse your cut potatoes under cold water and dry them VERY well. This removes the excess starch clinging to them (it's the starch that prevents potatoes from crisping up). Also, be sure to roast your potatoes on a wide-rimmed baking sheet or similar dish (to allow ample room to stir) and consider moving your dish to the upper rack of your oven for at least half of the baking time (this will also help crisp your potatoes). My potatoes were not as crispy as I had hoped they'd be, but were mildly crisp after baking for 40 minutes as directed. All in all, these were OK, but nothing to write home about. Thanks anyways, Donna. :-)

I realized this is the recipe from the box of soup mix. The directions are just a bit different (bake at 425 for 35 minutes). I followed those and the result was perfect. Can't see how you can go wrong either way though!

My new favorite potatoes.  I used the baby red, white and peruvian purple potatoes, so it looked as awesome as it tasted.   I did give the pan a good coat with cooking spray, and had no problems with the spuds sticking.  I left them in a bit too long, and they burned a bit, but I think that made them even better than when I cooked them per the recipe.

OK - I read all the reviews and combined some tips to come up with the perfect recipe. First, I used 3 1/2 lbs. of red potatoes and cut them into small chunks (similar in size to the "oven roasters" as in the stores). In a glad freezer bag, I coated the chunks with 1/4 cup of oil and 1 1oz package of Good Seasons Italian Salad Dressing (dry). I baked these for 1 hour on 350 on a baking sheet, stirring around every 15 minutes. I took them out and they sat for a few hours (I made prior to company coming over). Directly before I wanted to serve these, I baked for another 25 minutes (stirring frequently). I seasoned with salt and served immediately. They roasted up beautifully and I received a lot of positive feedback. I think the basic recipe on this website will make them too oily, so if you like them greasy, don't follow my recipe. Good tips, everyone! Thanks!

These are pretty good, but like another reviewer, I prefer ranch seasoning instead of the dry onion soup mix. Rosemary, olive oil and a little seasoning salt is also tasty.

I used Lipton onion mix, and actually just coated the potatoes (approx 1 - 1 1/2 inch dices) with some PAM, dumped the dry onion mix on top, and mixed them around.  I also added a bit of garlic salt and pepper.  I thought 450 seemed to high and that they would burn so I listened to other reviewers and put them in at 350 for 30 min.  I took them out, drizzled a little extra virgin olive oil, and put them back in for another 20 min at 450 this time.  They were perfectly cooked with a nice crisp on the outside.

Excellent recipe!  I lined the pan with tin foil for an easy clean up.  I will definitely make these again!  (I also baked them at 350 for 1hr covered with foil)

After reading the other reviews, this recipe turned out much better than I expected.  I did make a few additions though.  I chopped the onions in the soup mix (since they're always at the top of package) and added some pepper, salt, and parsley.  My husband loved it.  I also let the potatoes sit in the bag for about 30 minutes before I cooked them.  I will make these again.

Wonderful recipe. I made it with a roast tonight. The only thing I am sorry about is that I didn't double the recipe. I added carrots to the potatoes and they too were wonderful.

Made it twice this week! Total hit! First time the onion soup burned on the bottom. Next time spayed the casserole dish with pam and lowered the tempature to 400.

I don't think I've ever made something so easy that tasted so good. I sliced my potatoes just a little thicker than potato chips and they got wonderfully crispy.

I thought this recipe was good and really easy! I cooked in 450 degree oven for about 30-35 minutes. I stirred them three times. I covered with foil as recommended by someone else and that kept them from burning. I also cut the potatoes into 4ths and 8ths instead of halves.

Awesome!!!! I used them as an alternative to french fries with hamburgers.  Instead of 2 pounds, one package of onion soup fixed 4 pounds of red potatoes.

These are very good potatoes! I cut mine into 1/8 pieces and baked them for 20 minutes at 450 then 20 minutes at 350. I put salt and pepper on them before I put them in the oven to cook. With the adjusted size and cooking time/temp these turned out perfectly. Thank you!

This was a simple and excellent way to cook potatoes.  I took a risk and tried this for the first time when guests were over.  I used about 1.5 lbs potatoes so I used half an onion soup packet and 3 Tbs. oil.  I put them in a baking dish lined with foil and, in accordance with the reviews I read, baked them at 350 for 30 min and 400 for another 30 min, stirring every 15 min.  I got rave reviews from my husband and my guest, who asked for the recipe.  S

Hubs and I thought these were tasty but could use more flavor. Will make again. I cut each half into thirds or quarters depending on potato size. Split cook time 30" @350 & 20" @400. All were tender. Def foil. Some onions burned. Would be easy and great for a crowd. Will make again.

These turned out very nice!  Not enough flavor for me though I would add a little garlic powder, salt, pepper and even a dash or too of some Dinasour BBQ Cajun seasoning. Easy dish to make for a quick dinner!

I used onion soup mix the first time and thought it was too salty. Now I use lemon-infused olive oil, fresh rosemary, and a pinch of salt. That's it! 40 minutes is about right.

I think the issue that some people had with the dehydrated onion burning is twofold. First....the temperature can be a bit lower (perhaps 375 rather than 450)... Second (which I have done)combine the potatoes with the onion soup and olive oil about a half hour ahead of time to allow the dehydrated onions to re-hydrate. Also...I covered the baking dish for about half of the cooking time and took the cover off for the second half. It turned out perfect.....I also added some finely chopped Parsley just before removing it from the oven...Definitely a "Do Again".

These were pretty good.  I added a little more oil and more onion soup mix than called for and marinated for a little less than an hour before baking.  I did take another reviewer's advice and line the baking dish with aluminum foil; I am glad that I did that, they definitely do stick to the bottom, ha.  I baked at 350 degrees for half an hour, then for twenty minutes at 400 degrees, while mixing them around every fifteen minutes or so.  Thank you for the recipe.

Pretty yummy. Alterations: sprinkled with garlic salt, onion powder, and parsley flakes once out of oven. As other reviewer suggested: baked for 30mins @ 350 and then 20mins @ 400. Perfect seasoning and crispiness! Great for breakfast or paired as a side for dinner. Will make again!

This recipe has always been a favorite. Simple and tasty. I think you can doctor this recipe up to fit your taste without a problem. We have even put in a foiled baking bag and threw on the BBQ or campfire. (remember to rotate!) Thanks for sharing! YUM!

These were great, although I made some changes based on other reviews.  I cubed the potatoes to absorb more flavor, and used a packet of Good Seasons Italian Dressing mix instead of the onion soup.  It took about 30 min. for them to roast up nicely.  Although, I think I added a bit too much oil, or else I didn't have quite 2 lbs. of potatoes, because I had to drain them on paper towels after being in the oven.  They were very tasty though, and my husbands first words after his first bite was, "Wow, these are perfect!  Can you make these every night?"  Thanks Donna and other reviewers for the suggestions.

I have been making a variation on this recipe for years. I quarter the potatoes use 1 and 1/2 packs of dry extra zesty italian dressing and a bit more olive oil. It is extremely flavorful that way.

These were soooo good! As per others' suggestions, I used only half an envelope of onion soup and 1t rosemary, quartered the potatoes, and sub'd garlic flavored olive oil for the plain olive oil. Baked at 375 degrees for 55 minutes. PERFECT! Thanks Donna. I can't wait to try the Good Seasons version others suggested.

These potatoes were good but did taste a little bland--probably something as simple as a little salt would have helped a lot.  Also, stirring the potatoes is a good idea.  Otherwise, the onions will start to burn and stick to the bottom of the pan.

I really like this recipe for red potatoes. I used the onion soup mix and olive oil and added salt, pepper, dried parsley, and garlic powder. The preparation for this recipe was easy and the potatoes came out delicious. I will make this again!

I made these for Christmas and I have been making & eating this recipe ever since!! My husband loves them and they're so quick, easy and very tasty!! Highly recommend trying just as the recipe states, unless you need to use more potatoes then simply add more oil - olive or any veggie type oil will do! Of course doubling means 2 soup mix pouches!

If this thing had a 10 star rating I'd do it! I LOVE LOVE LOVE this receipe! I've used a trillion times with a different twist each time. Mostly its just a different spice or two.. last time we put the potatoes in a tin foil pan on the grill for about 15 minutes and it was soooo delicious! I would recommend this reciepe to anyone because its perfect with just about any meal in any season.

Recipe was simple and wonderful.  If you use Reynold's Non-stick aluminum foil on a baking sheet, the potatoes will crisp up and not stick-also-easy clean-up!

Yummy!  These were really good.  I did smash the soup mix up before opening the package as the other reviews suggested.  Also instead of halving the potatoes I cut them into large bite size pieces.  I put them in the oven and set the timer for 10 minutes and then stirred.  I repeated this four times for a total cook time of 40 minutes.

I grew up with onion soup potatoes, but my mom always used russets. I have also made them with russets. But, I don't know why I didn't think of red potatoes before! Much less starchy and a better flavor.

I've made these before - only with the Shake 'n Bake spices for potatoes.  I thought the oil was way too much, so I cut ALOT.  I probably only put about 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil, and add abit of garlic powder.  I also line my cookie sheet with parchment paper, so you know it won't stick; also lowered oven temp to 375.

Super yummy!!! :)  I actually cut the potatoes into fourths and cooked them at a lower temperature to be sure they didn't burn.  They turned out great. :)

Oh my goodness......I will never make potatoes any other way again!!  I used golden Yukons instead and sprinkled a little Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb in with the onion soup mix.  I lined the pan with foil (really helped on the clean up).  My husband thought I was a genius!  Thanks!

Very tasty!  Same recipe that is on the Lipton Onion Soup mix!  Only complaint is that the pan was hard to clean afterwards, so I would suggest lining the pan with aluminum foil to make for an quick and easy clean up.

My hubby really liked this. I on the other hand thought it was way too greasy & the onion soup mix didn't leave the potatoes very appealing. I didn't want to decrease the oil, because of other reviews that said it burned! If your looking for something light & tasty, try   
Bella's Rosemary Red Potatoes recipe.  They are excellent!

I used Good Seasons Italian dressing mix instead of the onion soup mix. Next time I'll try it with Ranch dressing mix. It had a really good flavor but didn't crisp up like I wanted them to. I'll broil them for the last few minutes when I do this again.

I have found anytime I bake anything now on a cookie sheet to either use the Tupperware silcone mat or a silpat. These are silcone baking mats that can be used on most pans to allow whatever you cook to just SLIDE off the pan. This is a helpful hint and i LOVE these potatoes... you can also add garlic or fresh rosemary or use the herb-onion soup mix or the mushroom-onion soup... yummy and easy clean up

Worked like a charm! The onions in the soup mix did not burn and the taste was just right! Adjustments: I cut my potatoes in quarters or smaller, I sprinkled with salt, pepper, and paprika before putting them in the oven, I played with the oven temp and baking time until I got them the way I wanted--I think I did 375 for 40 min then 400 for 20 min then 325 for 10 min.

Made this tonight and loved it! I wanted something a little different to do with our baby red potatoes that would go well with our sandwiches and this was it. After reading other reviews I went ahead and quartered my potatoes and added sliced carrots. To the marinade I added garlic powder (yumm) and pepper. Baked in a foil lined cookie sheet (sprinkled lightly with kosher salt before popping in the over) @ 350 for a half hour, turned, finished baking @ 400 for another 15 minutes. So yummy! Will be making again.

Great idea to use Onion Soup mix to coat.  We made this, w/added onion, zuchinni,  & cauliflower--marinaded for a while with olive oil and onion soup mix.  Followed the above reviewers advice, and cut oven time to 350 for 30 mins, then removed the cauliflower and zuchinni.  Turned oven up to 400 for 20 more mins for the red potatoes, and BOY was it delish!!! Yum, yum, yum!!!  Will DEFINITELY make again.  Might even become a fav of the family!

Awesome! We got the wrong kind of soup so we ended up using ranch dip mix. It was amazing! I will make again.

I make these all the time with baby red potatoes along with brussel sprouts. I use olive oil and sprinkle with minced garlic along with salt but will use the onion soup mix next time. I put them on parchment paper and don't cover them and bake them at 400 degrees. Never takes more than 1/2 hour to bake. My mouth is watering already yet I had them both last night for dinner.

If you are looking for something fast and easy to prepare, then this recipe is just for you. I couldn't find dry onion soup mix, so I just mixed the red potatoes in some mrs. dash garlic and herb seasoning. I also quartered the potatoes like others suggested to cut down on baking time - 30 min was just enough time. The reason why I couldn't give it a perfect 5 out of 5 is because the seasoning wasn't enough - it might have been because the seasoning I used was salt free. If your mix doesn't have salt in it, then I would recommend adding some in before baking.

Wow. It can get any easier than this now can it? Totally delicious and simple. I roasted on a baking sheet in the oven for just about 40 min. I quartered the red potatos. They came out perfectly...will definitely make again.l

We changed the recipe, but the technique was fabulous.  We put 1/3 cup of EVOO in a gal zip-loc bag with the potatoes, then added some Italian seasoning, onion salt, kosher salt and black pepper and let that marinade for an hour or so.

Then cooked as per instructions, but we make sure the cut side of of the potatoes are face down on the pyrex dish.  After 40 minutes at 450, the potatoes have a nice crisp out with a fluffy light interior.  Absolutely fabulous!

Based on some of the reviews, I ommited the Lipton Onion Soup mix and seasoned my potatoes with Lawry's and some greek seasoning. I also used some dried parsley (didn't have fresh on hand). The potatoes came out great! I will definantely be making these again!

Good, basic roast potato recipe...  I mixed red and russet potatoes, as that's what I had, plus half an onion, and cut the recipe in half, but otherwise didn't change a thing.  Baked for about an hour at 375F, than broiled about 5 more for some extra crunch. Might use a bit less olive oil next time, as they came out a bit "un-crisp!!"  Still tasted great though...!!!

I thought I had a dry onion soup packed on hand but didn't & ended up using a ranch seasoning packet instead. But it came out great, loved the crunch and softness of the potatoes. Will definitely make again! Yummy.

Followed the recipe with the additions of ground black pepper, chili powder and garlic powder. The onion bits from the soup mix were burnt, the potatoes were dry and tasteless.

Delicious and easy.  This cooking method brought out the flavour of the potatoes.  I used small red potates so the cooking time was shorter.  Baked on a small baking sheet covered with foil.  Made for easy clean up.  Made these twice this week and will be a regular at our house.  Lots of compliments.

Ever-so-yummy!  I added baby carrots to the mix and they were excellent.  I doubled the recipe, thinking I'd have roasted potatoes for a potato salad the next day.  BUT, the refrigerator raiders got every single one before morning.  This speaks volumes for the recipe - a definite keeper.

These were very good!  I put the onion soup mix with a spoonful of minced garlic, 1/3 cup of olive oil and then put into a ziploc bag.  I then put the quartered potatoes in the bag with the seasoning and mixed it all around.  I marinated them in the fridge for about a half hour.  I then put heavy duty foil on a cookie sheet sprayed it with Pam, and then dumped the potates on it.  I then sprinkled with salt and pepper on top, but do it sparingly.  I baked at 375 for 30 minutes and then 400 for 20 minutes.  Superb!!!

I thought the onion soup mix made it too salty and the dehydrated onions in the mix burned to a crisp. I've made it twice, using different amounts of the soup mix each time and both times it turned out too salty with burnt pieces in it. Great method for roasting potatoes I will just use a different seasoning next time.

This is my family's favorite side dish and I've used it for company as well.  However, I only use 2 tbsp olive oil if I'm using 2 lbs of potatoes, and I also quarter them.  I pound the onion soup packet with a mallet to crush it a bit before I use it.  I do add a little pepper as well.  I never cook them on this high of heat though - 350 works just fine for us (have to cook a tad longer but they don't get burnt this way).  I've also done these on the BBQ (make sure you double wrap with foil or the olive oil leaks out and smokes up the BBQ).  I did try to add minced garlic once but that was a disaster.  Highly recommend this recipe - but make sure you use a good quality onion soup mix for the best results.

These potatoes were absolutely wonderful!  The only thing I had a problem with was the temperature at whick to cook them.  At 450 they were cooking very quickly and sticking to the bottom of the dish, I turned it down to 375 and this was better.  I would also spray the dish with a cooking spray before baking next time.

I didn't have onion soup, but used a mix that we have here in Australia that can be sprinkled into soups and onto vegetables. This was way too salty, but the next day I made some more by putting the potatoes into the bag of olive oil w/ just salt and pepper and they were so crispy on the ouside and soft and tender on the inside!!! YUM!!!
Tip: Boil potatoes slightly for a few minutes before baking. Cuts down on baking time.
Thanks for this idea! I finally have wonderful roast potatoes.

As per user suggestions, I sifted the onions out of the mix to avoid the burnt onion problem and added a few more potatoes instead of decreasing oil.  I also added 1/2 tsp. each of oregano and garlic powder, and a pinch of pepper and garlic & herb seasoning (salt substitute/salad seasoning.)  I quartered the potatoes instead of halved, and cooked them at 350 for 45 minutes and then broiled them (on the second to highest rack) at 450 for 15 minutes.  I also took them out halfway through and turned them.  They were excellent, but the oil was still too much, and really kept the seasonings from staying on the potatoes.  Next time, I will add half the amount of oil, but I will keep everything else the same.  Sounds complicated, but this was a really basic recipe that, when altered to your personal tastes, is easy and delicious.

WOW!! What a hit!!  So simple and fast.  I threw these in the oven while I barbaqued chicken on the grill and steamed some zucchini.  These were also great sliced and fryed the next day.  My boys loved them!  Thanks.

We enjoyed these very much, the only drawback was that for some reason they took substantially longer than 40 minutes to bake. I'm not sure why.

The soup imparts a nice flavor, add fresh ground pepper for some extra color and taste, but there's too much oil. 

Do not make the mistake I made and try to make your main dish in the same oven - my chicken was supposed to be at 350, the potatoes at 450. I compromised at 400 and wound up with soggy, oily potatoes even after adding to the cooking time to compensate.

I loved these potatoes!  They were full of flavor and tasted like they were fried.  When I mixed the ingredients in the bag, I added a little bit of the Good Seasons Italian Seasoning.  And when they were baking, I added a little seasoned salt.  They turned out wonderful!

Have made the same with Ranch (as suggested by many reviewers) and it was okay. However, we consistently make it with Good Seasons Italian dressing mix, and it is great.  Has a lot more flavor, and always get rave reviews.

We also used the dry ranch mix instead of the onion soup mix. I also cut the taters up a bit more then the recipe said too.  I used a glass baking dish with lid and it turned out nice. Hubby enjoyed these.

Super good and super easy--just make sure to mix well before serving or else the top half is okay and the bottom is very saucy--if you mix it its GREAT and soooo easy.

These were very good, the little onion bits were tasty.  Only three ingredients made this very fast and convenient.  They taste like they were more complicated than they were, by far.  I heeded the advice of other Allrecipes users and cooked for 60 minutes at 350 degrees.  They were just right.  These were not very salty, but it would depend on which brand of onion soup mix you use.  I used Great Value (super cheap) onion soup mix from Walmart and it was just great.  Thanks Donna!

I have made this recipe but it didn't turn out at all the way I thought it would.  The onion mixture burned on.  I don't know what I did wrong, because I followed the recipe exactly as told.  Maybe it just wasn't my day.

It was good, but I added 1 tablespoon italian seasoning. They were so good, my husband begged for more! I did let it marinate for an hour and cooked them on the cookie sheet (lined with cooking spray covered foil).

I didn't really like the onion soup flavor, personally.  I  like to add seasonings without such a heavy emphasis on the onion.  Will stick with rosemary and italian seasoning mix.  Might add a few others, too.  Just thought the soup mix was overpowering.

I used this recipe when first making roast potatoes.  The soup mix is extremely high on salt so I stopped adding that.  I now season it myself with a little garlic and oregano and cook with olive oil.  I find it much healthier.

I'm so happy I found this recipe! It was very easy to make, and the little dehydrated onions in the soup mix crisped up to little brown bits that had us picking at the pan. My husband loved them so much he helped with the dishes after dinner.

I thought this was great! My husband, who normally doesn't like potatoes, thought they tasted a lot like the oven fries I make, so that's a plus. The dehydrated onions in the soup mix did burn a little bit, but it wasn't bad enough for me to throw them out. I very rarely have 2 pounds of potatoes on hand, so I do eyeball the measurements. My hubby thought they needed a bit more salt, so this time I just sprinkled a tad bit over the potatoes before putting them in.

These potatoes were spectacular! I used the baby reds and cut in half.  Mushed up Knorr's soup mix with olive oil in a plastic bag until dissolved. Added 2 piches of crushed up Rosemary.  Put the potatoes in and rolled around until covered and let it sit about 30 minutes.  I pre-heated the oven at 400 with a large cast iron pan.  Put the potatoes and liquid in the pan, back in the oven for 20 minutes, flipped over and gave it another 25 until crispy.  My husband and guest raved about them!

This is the recipe from the Lipton onion soup mix box.  I make these all the time with any kind of potato I have on hand.  My husband and I love these potatoes, except they're a little too oily, so I am going to cut back on the oil the next time I make these.

This was good, my only issue was that I no matter how much salt I added, it was enough. I did substitute the olive oil with garlic basil dipping oil. But otherwise a healthy family treat that I will make again.

OMG, my new favorite side dish!!! Next time I'm doubling everything cause my sons not only ate all of the potatoes with some smoked pork, but they even took the bits of onion soup "crispies" from the bottom of the baking dish! I made it exactly as the instructions called except I added pepper and garlic salt to taste. I will be making this at a lot of parties and family gatherings in the very near future!

The "potato" man in the house, (my husband), thought these were outstanding.  He would have liked them crisper, however and he usually cooks his potatoes at the highest temp the oven will go.  I followed the recipe and thought they came out perfect.  I didn't cook them as long, though, because I used the smaller red potatoes and cut them into quarters.  They were great.  Thanks

This recipe sounded so good and I couldn't wait to try it.  It was OK, but would have been better without the bitterness from the burnt pieces of onion.  I may give it another try but try and hold out the onions until the last 15 minutes.

Simple.  Very crispy, roasted potatoes.  Mine were done in 25 minutes.  Will absolutely make again.

This recipe is pretty good on it's own, but with certain modifications, it's amazing! I followed the advice of several reviews and added salt, pepper, and fresh garlic to the marinade, before leaving it in the fridge for about an hour. It really made the flavor sink in. Then I used foil on the baking sheet, because no matter what you do, the potatoes will stick (even if you use non-stick cooking spray, which I did). I added seasoned salt and pepper to the potatoes before they went in the oven. 30 minutes at 350 and then 20 minutes at 400. They turned out crispy and delicious! The onion mix DID burn a little on the edges of the pan, but DID NOT burn on the potatoes. Absolutely amazing. I will be making this frequently!

Very good! I adjusted the bake time, just bc potatoes always take forever in my oven, and bc I had chicken I wanted to bake as well.  I baked for an hour at 350 then jacked up the oven to 400 for 30 mins (what my chicken dish called for).  it worked out perfectly--crispy on the outside, soft on the inside potatoes.  I'm already thinking that dry ranch dressing mix would be good on these as well.  Oh, and I didn't measure the oil, using only enough to coat as I didn't think I needed 1/3 cup of oil at all.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great flavor but the onions in the mix did burn so we had to scrape those off. I quartered the potatoes & they were done at the 30 min mark.

I made this tonight for dinner and all I can say is WOW!  How can something this easy taste so wonderful?  The only thing I did different is to quarter the potatoes and bake them for 30 minutes.  I also threw the cut up potatoes into the roasting pan and then poured the oil/onion soup mix on top.

I love this recipe! So easy and predictable. My only changes were I added either fresh, chopped garlic or a little garlic power. You can also serve with some sour creme for a little extra. Thanks for sharing! It's definitely a keeper.

Pretty simple dish. Pretty simple flavor. For a quick side, it might be good.

I served this with some blackened shark and I don't really think it complimented the shark meat well. Perhaps with a different type of fish?

I made these potatos for a BBQ I had for 35 people thinking they would be kind of a "filler side".  They were a total hit though and everyone kept asking me for the recipe.  I wish I had made more.  They are definitely going in my recipe box.

Does burn if you use a baking sheet, so a casserole dish might be better.

These were so delicious! I did what another review suggested and added baby carrots and I'm so happy I did. I crushed up the envelope of onion mix with my fingers before opening and pouring in the bag. I marinated the veggies in the refrigerator for an hour. I roasted them at 350 for the first 20 minutes and then at 400 for 25 minutes. They turned out perfect! I had them today as leftovers and they were just as delicious as last night.

Absolutely delicious. The only change I made was to make a Lipton soup mix recipe from the copycat restaurant website. We never buy onion soup mix anymore. Doubled the recipe, and am making them very soon. Thank you so much for this great recipe Donna.

I mixed SUGARSURPRISE & RATED PG 's way of doing the oven roasted red potatoes and I loved it! It turned out perfect. My family loved it! But I must confess I went a tad too much on the olive oil. Next time I need to actually measure with a cup and not with my eyes. hehe! Will toatally recommend this recipe!

I diced these potatoes since I have young children, but used the oil and onion soup as writen.  I followed some reviewers suggestions to put them on a wire rack over a cookie sheet and they were amazing!  I doubled the recipes and tried one batch with ranch dressing mix as someone suggested and although that was good too, all my kids (even my youngest) preferred the onion soup.  Thanks for such a good, easy recipe!  It will become one of our staples!

Super easy and really great!  I cut each potato into six wedges...Gary said they were good about 4 times during the meal! I used 6 fat red potatoes, an unknown amount of olive oil, and at least 3/4 of a package of golden onion soup mix. 450 for 30 mins uncovered. Sat out of oven with lid on for about 15 mins...Perfect!

I looked a couple reviews, felt 450 was too high so preheated oven to 425. Then I decided to cut them into chunks just for personal preference, and to mix all the ingredients in the pan to cut down on it sticking the pan. As i was grabbing the soup packet I realized the exact modification planned to do was on the back of the box.

These were definately good but you REALLY wanna make sure you stir them around a few times. The first time I made these I put em in the oven and got busy with other stuff and they, well.......they got burnt. Oops (: Oh well - joys of cooking, scratch that and try again-much better the second time around when I remembered to stir them!

I read a lot of reviews where people changed things, but I just did exactly as the recipe said (except for lining the pan with aluminum foil and spraying w/ Pam).  As long ans you stir 3 or 4 times, there is no sticking and they came out yummy!  Whole family approved!  Oops, one other thing.  I did quarter the potatoes instead of halving, but they were larger than average.

This was so good! I lined my metal 10x14 pan with foil and dripped the olive oil, 1/3 cup over all the potatoes. I seasoned them with the soup mix, garlic, paprika, pepper. They were delicious!

I love onions and these potatoes are tasty! Excellent taste for such an easy process! Make sure you use enough potatoes or use less of the packet or they will be too salty.

These were really good but I modified them a little.  I used 3 pounds of red potatoes and sliced them in half and then three times the other direction.  I used an envelope of zesty Italian dressing and added 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/4 teaspoon dried rosemary, and 1/4 teaspoon salt.  I decreased the oil to 1/4 cup and baked the potatoes on a silicone mat.  I didn’t have any trouble with burning or sticking to the mat.  YUM!

I cut the potatoes into eighths and allowed them to sit in the olive oil mixture for about an hour. Following others' advice, I spread the potatoes out on a cookie sheet and baked them at 350 degrees F for an hour, stirring occasionally, and at 450 degrees F for 20 minutes. I sprinkled some parsley for color. The potatoes were very flavorful and crispy. This recipe is so easy and produces great results!

First, I followed this recipe - didn't add anything special.  And I was quite disappointed to find that this is the same recipe from the back of the onion soup mix box!  Anyway, the potatoes came out "fine."  But the mixture didn't really do much for them.  Pretty boring.  Add your own seasonings or something.  And if you're reading those other reviews that gave this 4 or 5 stars, it's because they added all sorts of other things and basically made their own roasted potatoes.  I also had to individually take each piece off of the foil.  *sigh*

I have been using this recipe from the back of the Lipton Onion soup mix box for years.  I usually use more then 2 lbs. of potatoes (either red or white/all purpose, but when I use 2 lbs. or less I do not use all of the soup mix.  I also cut the potatoes into quarter size - they get tender faster this way.  My family loves this recipe.

Yum - these were great! I followed reviewers advice and cut the potatoes into small chunks, gave them a generous shake of seasoned salt and a not-so-generous shake of pepper and baked them at 400 for nearly an hour. They were terrific!

Yummy! I followed others' advice and cooked them on a cookie sheet covered in foil and cut the potatoes into smaller pieces. Once they were in the pan I sprinkled on salt, pepper, garlic powder and chili powder for a bit of kick. Before my daughter finished her plate she asked when I was going to make them again.

This is almost identical to a recipe my dad uses.  I'm a university student, and these potatoes are really easy to prep and cook, they make a great side dish.  Instead of using olive oil, I use zesty Italian dressing, it adds a little kick of flavour.

VERY good flavor!  I cut the potatoes into 8 pieces for more bite-size friendly chunks, added some minced garlic, and cooked them at a lower temp for slightly longer.  I do agree with another reviewer about it using too much olive oil and will cut down on it next time, but they turned out great te first time, so this is definitely a keeper!

Nothing but satisfaction!!!  I made these for my entire family during our recent vacation.  I used Dry Italian Dressing, in place of the Onion Soup.  They were perfectly golden and soft in the middle.  I had to double the recipe since we have 15 in our family.  I had some leftovers, so I warmed them up in the morning and served with eggs.  Just as good as the night before.  They were such a hit on vacation that the family asked for an encore at Christmas.  These will more than likely become a staple at family meals from this point forward.

Have been making these for years.  Recipe is also on the back of the Lipton Onion Soup package.  Another suggestion... use an envelope of Good Seasons Italian Dressing or a package of Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing.  I also cube potatoes for more flavor.

I cut the potatoes into bite-sized pieces, used italian salad dressing mix like another person suggested, sprinkled with white wine vinegar, and cooked at 400 until the last 10 minutesthen bumped it up to 425.  Unbelievably good!  My hubby said they were awesome.

These were good.  Based on other reviews I did spice mine up quite a bit.  I sifted my onion lipton soup packet and used basil, oregano, season salt, garlic pepper, as well as parmesan cheese. I cut my potatoes in 1/4s so that the pieces would be smaller.  They stuck to the pan a little but it was not too bad because I used Pam on the tinfoil etc. It was a nice accompaniment to grilled chicken and fresh veggies.

pretty good - I made them with the Italian seasoning mix.  They tended to burn a little in the end.  I would probably cook them at a lower temp. next time

This was the perfect potato side dish that I was looking for. Seasoned red potatoes with a little bit of crisp but still very tender. I used 1/4 cup of olive oil and strained my onion soup mix. I also added pepper and 1 chopped white onion - put it all together in a large Ziploc bag - mixed it up and marinaded it for 3 hours. I only baked it for 30 minutes on 450 and turned it to lo broil for the remaining 10. I added a sprinkle of salt and more pepper after taking it out of the oven. It was perfect.

Have made this for years. I use whatever potatoes, usually baking, I have on hand. I always cube the potatoes to bite size and always bake at 350 degrees for one hour.

These were okay, they tasted just like potatoes covered with onion soup mix.  The potatoes cooked up very nicely and browned well, though.  I will try again, but I will experiment w/ different seasoning mixtures.

I made a few minor changes.  I cubed the potatoes instead of halving them -- that way they didn't have to cook quite as long.  I also followed the advice of other reviewers and sprayed the dish with vegetable oil -- very important so they don't stick.  Also, I added a clove of minced garlic.  I will make these often.  We all enjoyed them.

I have found that this recipe is improved by sifting out the  dried onion bits that tend to burn, causing a bitter taste, and is replaced with large diced fresh onion.  The pieces cook along with the potatoes, become nicely carmelized and sweet. You may have to increase roasting time to allow for the addition of the onion's extra moisture.

An excellent side dish that has quickly become a family favorite. I cut the potatoes to quarter-dice to cook a bit faster with great results. You can also reduce the oil to a quarter cup.

These potatoes were well liked by everyone.  I cut them into wedges first and cooked them for a couple of minutes in the pressure cooker.  After letting them cool for a bit I added the oil (1/2 the amount indicated) and soup mix.  I also added some Italian Seasoning and fresh black pepper.  They crisped up really well in the oven and took a fraction of the time!!

This is a very tasty dish to make. I substitued garlic and onion powder for the dry soup mix, and added parsley for additional flavor.  I also needed the potatoes to cook faster than 1 hr, so I diced the potatoes and simply baked until tender (~20 min).   A highly recommended side dish!

Very good, quick, easy. Serves well beside an everyday dish or an elegant one. I make mine with melted margarine instead of olive oil (you only live once after all.) I also take them out and stir them at the halfway point of the cooking time, because the onion pieces can burn. After they're done, I sprinkle them lightly with garlic salt and fresh-ground pepper. Yum!

A ok!These are delicous! My husband liked them but he said i needed to add more onion soup mix to it for more flavor and I agreed, next time I will cut the potatoes in quarters, the halves were to big for us. Thank you and it was excellent.

Using the previously recommended variation of a Good Seasons packet in place of the called-for onion soup mix, this recipe was delicious and I will make it again.  Next time, I'll use the 350 degree for one hour baking suggestion and will spray a foil-lined cookie sheet with cooking spray to both prevent the occasional burnt potato bottom and make cleanup and stirring during baking a snap.  Thank you Donna!

The dried onion shreds in the onion soup mix dried into unattractive pellets.  Might have been better with the oil coating and using my own herbs and spices.  Definitely not a keeper.

In addition to the soup mix I sprinkled some chopped fresh dill and baked it all for an hour at 350, as suggested by the other reviews. It tasted good and it was VERY easy to make.  It is a nice extra side dish, made with little effort.

Psersonally I fins that adding garlic and onions make this receipe all the better.  They serve these in New Orleans and in London in the fancy restaurants.  Try the soup mix- and add in dill, onions, garlic, and chives or leaks.  and enjoy!!!  And put extra old cheddar on top to melt.

I've been making potatoes like this for years! It's a family hit!! You could also add more dried spices to the potatoes for more flavor and to change it up, or just make it as is.  Super good fried up with eggs the next morning.

Love the ease of making these roasted potatoes, but don't think this recipe was anything to gush over. It was good and I will likely make again.

I have used other white potatoes. Cut them into wedges, tossed them in olive oil and seasoned them with garlic salt, onion salt and black pepper. Cooked at 450° until golden brown. Turning at least once. I used a lined pan for easy clean up. Always been a favorite.

Great potatoes!  I made a few changes as noted by others plus one of my own.  I first poured the olive oil over the cut potatoes, just enough oil until they were adequately moistened, tossing well.  Then I sprinkled on the onion soup mix plus a few shakes of garlic powder. I stirred to adequately cover evenly,  then let them sit for about 30 minutes, placed the potatoes on a foil covered baking sheet, and sprinkled lightly with seasoning salt.  Baked for 30 minutes at 350 and then increased to 400 degrees for the final 30 minutes.  Crisp on the outside, perfectly moistened and hot and steamy inside.

The potatoes were dried out when pulled out of the oven. Suggestion would be to adjust the temperature or pull them out sooner. The taste was good...

Super easy to make and tastes very good.   Depending on how large your red potatoes are you may need to quarter them instead of halve.  Next time I'm going to go a touch longer, perhaps 45 mins instead of 40 to get a bit extra crispiness on them.  Regardless, these turned out very well.

I made this recipe exactly as it says and was impressed. Very simple to make and very tasty. It got rave reviews from my husband and the 10 yr old. The 7 yr old refused to try it - didn't like the way the onion mix pieces looked after being baked. But that just meant more for the rest of us! ;)

Great, easy recipe. Crush onion soup mix while still in packet with a rolling pin. Put all ingredients in a large plastic bag early in the day.  Make sure potatoes are coated with oil. Squeeze as much air as possible out of the bag before closing it and pop the bag into the fridge. Turn the bag over once or twice during the day and bake as directed.

Good basic recipe. I took the recommendations of a few others. I added 4 cloves minced garlic, made sure the soup mix was well crushed up as well as adding a few sprigs of fresh thyme. I didn't cook it the whole 40 minutes as they were done with 10 min left.

These were fantastic, I made them just as directed, use a glass dish though and not a foil lined pan as I did and almost burnt them. For sure I'll make again (I made with a roast in the crock pot.)

I didn't have the onion soup mix so I substituted ranch mix....it was not a suitable substitution, unfortunately.  I'm giving this a low rating because despite the difference in seasoning, the potatoes were heavy and soft.  I'm terribly sorry but I will not make this one again.

This was really easy to make! I let the potatoes marinate in the bag for a few hours in the fridge before spreading onto the baking sheet, after 40min, voilà! I did set it at 325F for 20 min then increased it to 375F for 15-20 min longer. I only cooked a pound so I had to split the packet in half too. My boyfriend loved it and complimented the dish three times during dinner!

Great Recipe!  Cut the potatoes in eighths, added a little more olive oil and about a 1/3 cup of Hormel Bacon bits. Topped with sour cream and fresh chives when serving and it was awesome!

OK, so I made a mistake by not reading other reviews before making this. I was in a hurry and popped it into the oven as written. BIG mistake, the onions burned to a crisp and they tasted terrible. It's a good thing that I tasted them prior to company coming. I was able to salvage them by spraying with olive oil and coating with a garlic/herb seasoning. Then covered with foil and put back in the oven for a while. The onion soup mix alone is pretty bad. The only thing in this recipe that is right is time & temperature.

I spread the seasoned potatoes on a lined (foil) cookie sheet to bake. I set the timer for only 30 min at 450 degrees. After 30 minutes they were done, but a bit dark on the underside. Next time I will use 400 degrees and flip the potatoes mid way. They were very easy and tasty none the less. JeanW

Prepped the potatoes w/sea salt, garlic pwr & Italian seasoning w/ the oil.  I also let them sit for 30 min before putting in the oven w/ my vertical roasted chicken tower.  A meal for kings!  I have been cooking vertical chicken and roasted potatoes for years but this potato recipe is the best we have tried.  Thanks!

I LOVED these potatoes!!! My mom said they could use some more salt but I thought they were great. I did not have a bag so I put all the ingredients in a bowl swirled them around and poured them onto a cookie sheet. Also I cut the potatoes into smaller pieces rather than just halved.

I used a cookie tray for baking these, which is very important if you like them crispy!  I cut each red potato in half for more crispy edges, but just tossed them In olive oil, salt and pepper this time, since my other dishes had a fruit flavor accent going; I wanted something more plain this time.  I am sure my family would enjoy these with all kinds of seasoning combos!

I tried this recipe as-is despite what many of the reviews say.  Ok, so some of the onion pieces did burn, the ones that were on the cookie sheet, not on the actual potatoes.  I did let the potatoes sit in the olive oil/onion packet for about 30 minutes before putting them in so maybe they were softened.  We thought they were good and would make them again!

40 minutes in a 450 oven is way too much.  Burned on the bottom, but potatoes were not done.  Probably my fault; should have quartered them.

Very good, but I recommend you extend the cooking time so the potatoes are softer.

These are good and easy potatoes.  Great to fix when you don't have a lot of prep time and need to throw something easy together.  Great for large gathering too.

I just added a little salt, pepper and accent to bring out the flavor at the end. Other than that the recipe was spot on! The family enjoyed it and I have picky eaters.

Loved these potatoes.  Now I am experimenting a little with the recipe. I add fresh garlic, salt, pepper and seasoned salt. Need to try with ranch dip mix next.

I usually take the time to read through previous reviews and incorporate hints from other cooks, but tonight I just needed a quick recipe and made it as written. I found the soup mix to be very over-powering for the potatoes (note I love the soup mix for roasts and mixed with sour cream for chip dip, so it's not as though this was my first encounter with it), and the potatoes were overcooked as well. Next time I'll just sprinkle them with kosher salt and a little garlic powder after the oil and call it a day.

I took the advice of another poster and baked at 350 for 30 minutes and then at 400 for 20 minutes. The potatoes were perfectly crisp! The onion mixure was a bit overpowering, but still pretty good. Make sure to grease your foil/pan though or else the potatoes will get stuck!

Wow, for a guy with basic cooking / culinary knowledge, this is a simple, cheap, easy recipe, that when done right, with a little TLC and the right garnish can look like a very expensive, sophisticated side to poultry, steak, pork, anything !  WOW !!  Cant get enough.

I'm giving this 3 1/2 stars.  It was good, but I thought it was a little bland.  I halved the recipe but that shouldn't have mattered.  I think it depends on the size of the potatoes.  I used bigger ones so I actually quartered mine and they just didn't seem to have enough coating to make them flavorful.  I am going to try the recipe again but use the really small ones and see if that makes a difference.

This is good, but I sprinkle Oregano, Salt, Blk Pepper, Curry Powder, Crushed Red Pepper, Garlic Powder, and Onion Powder instead of the dry onion soup. So flavorful this way!
DELISH!

This was pretty good.  I added some fresh garlic and next time I will add some fresh ground pepper & salt.  Took the leftovers and fried them in the morning for some breakfast potatoes, turned out pretty tasty.

I would add some onions and tons of salt and pepper. It didnt have as much flavor as I expected. They were a big hit though, just might change them up a bit next time.

Pretty good!  I followed the directions exactly (I'm so not a creative cook) and they turned out good but I burned them a little.  The recipe on the soup envelope said to stir them occasionally but I didn't - too much work hehehe - so maybe that's why they burned on the bottom.  Good with some sour cream!

I used this recipe as a base and added my own twist. Instead of dry onion soup mix, chopped up some onion and garlic to put in with the potatoes and for seasoning, I added salt, pepper, onion salt, garlic salt, italian seasoning, and dried parsley flakes. I then baked in the oven for half an hour. The flavor wasnt as much as I had hoped for so next time i'm going to use butter instead of olive oil and probably a bit more onion salt and garlic salt. Even with the mild flavor they, they were very good.

I was looking for something other than Mac n Cheese to prepare for a family cookout, and these were a HIT.  I had people picking the little stuck on pieces out of the dish after they were all gone.  EASY PEASY and super good.  I didnt' have red potatoes, so used russets - they were a little soft, but turned out just fine.

these are so good! We used a package of Garlic and Herb seasoning- and just tossed with a little olive oil- I did cut them into much smaller pieces. Just maybe 1" squares or so.  Cooked for 30min at 350 and 20min at 400. perfecto!  the BF said he LOVED them. our new fav. side dish!  =0) thanks for the recipe! XD

This is so YUMMY!!  I added carrots to it and used red and white new potatoes.  For the first 20 minutes I cooked it on 400 and then tossed it.  The second 20 minutes I changed the temperature to 350 because I had something else to put in the oven.  It turned out perfect and we will definately make this again.

My husband and I made this as a side dish for our 1st Valentine's day dinner and it turned out just okay.  We followed ALL of the suggestions regarding cooking time (30 mins at 350* & 30 mins at 400*) as well as cutting back a little on the oil and adding extra seasoning.  I also quartered the potatoes.  Most of the oil ended up on the foil and the potatoes were dry and hard because they were undercooked.  The onion mix burnt on the foil too.  I would allow yourself extra time for the potatoes even with only 2 lbs.  Our entire dinner was based around the time of the potatoes so we ended up taking them out of the oven after an hour because the rest of our meal was getting cold.  Honestly- Im not sure I even liked the onion soup mix. :(  Next time I will make up my own seasoning mixture and cut the potatoes into 1/8ths.

These were good but not as good as I expected them to be. I thought they would be full of onion flavor but it actually lacked much flavor. I didn't even use the 2 pounds of potatoes. I used 4 large red potatoes, a whole packet of french onion mix & even sprinkled some garlic powder on them. I think I like the way my hubby normally makes them for us which is olive oil, chopped onion & crushed garlic much more flavorful!

These were really good.  I've made a similar dish with sweet potatoes.  Onion soup mix is so versatile...does any one really make soup from it?  I don't.  Heated up the marinated chicken I made last night and this made a great football-Sunday dinner.

Very good!  And what I like about it is that it's so easy.  I had to cook mine a little longer, and I cut my potatoes in quarters instead of halves.  Will make again!

Great recipe! Although I also cut down the amount of olive oil used. Once potatoes were in the zip lock bag, I drizzled just enough to lightly coat. I didnt have any onion soup mix on hand so I substitued a baked potato seasoning instead.  Any of your favorite seasonings will work. Be creative! These were a nice change of pace from my typical mashed or fried potatoes!  Thank you for an easy recipe with such variety!

delicious and easy!  I marinated them all day and they came out just right.  I also took the advice of 350 degrees for a half of an hour and then 400 degrees for the last half hour.  Came out just right.

1/3 cup of olive oil sounded like a lot, so like others, I used a much smaller amount - about 2 tbsps for 5-6 medium sized potatoes.  I also used a McCormick steamers potato seasoning packet (Garlic & Rosemary) as a short-cut.  I placed the potatoes on a cookie sheet and put them in the oven for about 45min on 350 degrees (stirring occassionally), then baked them an additional 15-20 on 400 degrees to brown them a little.  The potatoes turned out wonderful!!  I made these for Christmas dinner and everybody loved them!

these were great!  They also were great as leftovers both cold and warmed up.  I marinated them overnight in olive oil and soup mix.  Baked on cookie sheet at 450 the entire time.  They did not crisp but tasted great!

My mom has been making these for years and they are always one of my favorite ways to have potatoes. The onions get nice and crispy... delicious! I add a few spiced to my own, sometimes fresh rosemary and they are simply delicious, a great side!

Very good recipe and super easy. The only things is, I cut my potatoes in fourths and I would probably cut them smaller next time to give the pieces more flavor.

I used the onion soup the first time around, which were alright, but I recommend using oregano, garlic, salt and pepper instead of onion soup mix. Much better the second time around.

These turned out great and were really easy.  I worried about the onions being too crunchy and burning so I just let them marinade in the oil for about 10 minutes to rehydrate them.

Great potato recipe, I only used half an envelope on onion soup mix and I crushed it up so there weren't any big onion chunks, I also added fresh black pepper and a bit on italian seasoning. These are great with breakfast or dinner.

Next time I will bake them on a foil lined sheet pan instead of a 9x13 inch baking dish so the potatoes are more spread out and brown more evenly.

This was a great recipe, I did make a few changes:  I baked the potatoes on a foil lined cookie sheet at 380 for 20 minutes and then at 450 for 20 additional minutes.  I flipped them after the first 20 minutes and sprinkled parmesan cheese on them.  Very tasty....will definetly make again!

Tastes yummy, but I loaded the seasonings on and added onion salt and a touch of greek seasoning. I did wedges so they were soft on the outside but a few were a little crisp on the edges (like fries).

I followed what another reviewer mentioned and added some sea salt and garlic. Excellent potatoes and will definitely have them again soon. Really easy to make and cleanup was a breeze.

This is by far the best roasted potato recipe I've tried.  I've used this with both red and russets and it's delicious either way.  This is always a hit with company and our family.  I hate that it comes from a package, but the other recipes using "all natural" spices just aren't that good.

I'm not sure how someone could burn these without cooking them WAY too high or way too long.  I usually cut mine into wedges instead of cubes and follow all other directions to a T... They DO stick if you don't liberally oil the pan, or use parchment.

I have made this several times before...we add shredded cheese to the last 15 minutes then have it melt.  The one thing I found so that the onion mix did not get quite so crispy is that I reduced the time a bit but covered them with foil for cooking....We serve ours with salsa and sour cream-especially when I dont have cheese...we have also crumbled bacon (uncooked) into the mix. then baked...you can also just add cooked bacon cut up....yummy.

These are outstanding and outstandingly easy to boot. I had a bottle of Mrs. Dash laying around and found it enhanced them quite a bit without adding any more sodium.

Been using this recipe for years...also works great in a large non-stick frying pan on top of the stove. I love leftovers (rarely have them though) and use them in omelets, frittatas or roast beef hash

I've been making this for about 10 years its identical to the recipe on the back of lipton onion soup mix. For a little variation I like to throw in a little garlic and rosemary or whatever suits me at the time. When pressed for time i will diced potatoes and throw them in the microwave to pre cook them then toss them in your mixture. They will finish in about 5 minutes @ 350 after that.

The cooking time/temp. is definately off. I cooked mine for 35 minutes and they were burnt = ( . I marinated them and went through all that trouble just for burnt potatoes! I might try again but DEFINATELY change the time/temp.

I liked these potatoes very much.  I cut my potatoes into wedges and then microwaved them first.  I then added baby carrots to them and mixed in the oil and onion mix with a little garlic powder, cooked them on a tin foil lined baking sheet 350 for 45 minutes.  Wow, delicious!!

AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME!  these were the best potatoes I've had in awhile!  I added some garlic, rosemary, thyme and oregano to the mix, baked at 425 for about an hour and they were delicious.  Crispy on the outside, mushy on the inside, just the way I love potatoes.

I used yellow Klondike potatoes in this recipe.  These roasted very well at an oven temperature of 375 rather than the 450 called for and  was still done in 40 minutes(no burning). I added black pepper and finished off with some grated parmesan cheese the last few minutes of baking time.  I will be making these again.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!

These were yummy! I did follow a few of the other reviewers suggestions such as crushing the soup mix, adding carrots, and letting the potatoes marinate in the mixture for about an hour then cooking at 375 for only 35 minutes and turing every 10 min to prevent sticking. I will be making these again for sure.

Fine, though a bit salty. I used beefy onion soup mix. I also used half the oil, but greased my foil pan well, and then discarded the pan after baking. There was zero burning and (hardly) any sticking. Easy.

It was good but I think I added too much onion soup mix because it came out too salty. As well the onion bits burnt which made them taste some what bitter. I'll give this recipe another go but I'll sift out the dried onion bits next time.

This was a quick and easy recipe for a side dish.  I followed some peoples suggestions and used aluminum foil, which I also sprayed with non-stick spray.  I had no issues with them sticking.  I also cooked them at 350F for 60 minutes.

I am such a novice when it comes to cooking! This recipe was great easy and tasty. Agree with other suggestions- if you like it crisp cut into small pieces, add some garlic salt or salt and pepper to taste and cook for longer depending on how many potatoes you are making.

Yummy! Be sure to cut the potatoes into bite-sized pieces instead of just cutting in half; you'll get more 'surface area' of taste. :) Also, I marinated the potatoes in the olive oil & soup mix for 1 hour before baking...perfect. Also - you need to line your cookie sheet with aluminum foil, because the potatoes even stuck to the foil a bit...maybe even spray the foil with oil. Great, simple recipe - will make again.

Very yummy... even got my picky husband to eat them.  I did as others had suggested and cut the temperature to 400 degrees.  It took them about 1 hour to cook.  I also cut down on the amount of onion soup mix and oil.  Will cook these again!

I've never had such a great reaction from my husband!  I quartered 3 lbs of baby reds, soaked for a little while and prepped the mix.  I used the full amount of oil called for but there was a TON left over, will reduce amt next time.  Spread on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and sprinkled with black pepper, salt, parsley and a little garlic. Cooked for 30 min at 375.  Took out after 30 min and rotated sheet, and flipped the taters.  Put back in the oven for 15 min and THEY WERE PERFECT!  Delicious recipe, thanks!

This was fantastic. I followed the directions, and they came out wonderfully. I followed the advice of other reviewers, and crunched up the soup mix before combining everything.

If you're after crunchy potatoes, I would suggest cutting back on the olive oil - but I liked it as they were. They were very moist and flavorful.

There wasn't much flavor. The temperature was too high and the onions burnt. From now on, I'll keep the onion soup mix in the meatloaf where it belongs.

Yikes, this is kind of salty! My bag of potatoes must have been smaller then 2 lbs... But I love the ease of the recipe and they are delicious! I definately recommend spreading them out on a sheet of foil. They will stick and it makes clean up a cinch!

My husband and I loved these potatoes.  They were a great switch-up to our normal mashed or fried potatoes.  I used russets because that's what I had on hand.  I cut the potatoes a little too small and they were almost over done.  I ended up taking them out ten minutes earlier.  I baked them on a foil lined and oiled cookie sheet  and sprinkled them with just a touch of cajun seasoning, for an added kick.  They smelled wonderful!  We had this with the slow cooker Keilbosa and sauerkraut (cooked in beer) from this site.  Nice mix of flavors.  At my husbands request, we'll be having these again soon.

Oh, these were so good. I cut the potatoes into eighths and stirred them twice during cooking. I also cooked them at 375 degrees and they only needed about 45 minutes. And you definitely don't need this much oil - I used 1/4 cup and there was some left in the bag. SO easy and tasty.

so easy, great taste definitely a keeper. I agree if you want to change the flavor--as some suggested garden mix and so, that's great, but the onion soup mix was great for the side to the meal. Kept the calories down too. Followed directions exact and but forgot to stir them during cooking, but it didn't change the flavor.Thanks for submitting this recipe.

Meh. I needed to add quite a bit of extra seasoning to bring out any flavor. A good starter recipe, but definitely needs some that something extra.

These were so easy and VERY good.  I plan to make these my default side dish.  I did make one change.  Instead of using the French Onion Soup mix, I used the Herb Mix (sits right next to the French Onion Soup Mix in the grocery aisle) and it really gave the potatoes a lot of flavor.  I also used the microwave method of cooking them for 15-20 minutes and stirring every 5 minutes. They were perfect.  My husband could't eat enough.

I cut the oil back a smidge and tested one.  Quite tasteless.  I sprinkled more oil, salt, pepper and garlic.  Bake another 10 minutes and served. These passed as ok with my husband and friend but are not making it to my recipe box. Apologies.

I made several adjustments to this recipe after reading the reviews & even though I didn't encounter many of their problems, this recipe was only average, at best. I used less than 1 lb. of potatoes (cut into 1/2" slices), used less than 1/4 cup of oil but used the full packet of onion soup mix, added rosemary, marinaded them in oil & soup mix for a couple of hours, cooked them in a foil lined baking pan that I sprayed w/ Pam. I covered them w/ foil & cooked them in a 400 degree oven for 30 minutes then I removed the foil & cooked for another 15. None were burnt nor stuck but all were pretty flavorless. I think I'd have had better success if I had just sliced potatoes, drizzled them w/ oil & sprinkled them w/ some salt & pepper. Will not make again....sorry.

These were delicious and I will definitely make them again.  They even reheat nicely.  One tip I have is that when you bake them, make sure the cut side is up so they're less likely to stick to the pan.

Very good--needed to be in the over longer, I don't like potatoes unless they are very soft. Also, needed to be cut smaller and maybe more spice.

Good recipe.  I cut my potatoes into four for a smaller cut and used 1/4 cup olive oil with a packet of good seasons as others suggested(thank goodness because to my suprise my cupboard was bare of onion mix) and I let the potatoes sit in that for a few hours before baking.  I did add salt/pepper and a sprinkle of garlic powder to enhance flavor a little.  Not bad!

These are pretty good.  They were a nice change, in any case.  I like to do this with the Good Seasons, as others have suggested.  Not too crazy about the ranch dressing coated ones.

What a great recipe!  Couldn't be easier and tasted great.  I used the red skinned, yellow fleshed potatoes - delicious! Whole family really liked them. This one's a keeper.

I cubed the potatoes into 1 inch cubes so that more of the surface area was coated.  Added dried minced garlic, salt and pepper to the soup mix.  Lined my baking pan with foil for easy cleanup.  Went very well with the roasted chicken and vegetables.

I halved this recipe using baby new potatoes.  They got burnt pretty badly which made them look nasty.  I will try this again on a lower temperature.

These are really pretty good. I did sift the onions from the soup mix(save them) but if you really would like to have them on your potatoes do like I did and sprinkle them on about half to 3/4 the way through the baking process. It really works!! They turn a little brown but don't burn. We dipped in ranch dressing or ketchup.

My family loved this recipe. However I did change a few things. I cut the potatoes in small pieces, about 1" in diameter, used 1/4 a cup of olive oil, and set the oven to 350 for 45 minutes. The onions did not burn and the potatoes were just right. We ate the entire batch. I did dash them with a little garlic salt as they were cooking but you couldn't taste it when they were finished cooking.

This was a very quick and easy recipe.  My only improvement might be to not use a whole envelope of onion soup mix because it was a little salty.  Great recipe, I love the easy ones.

I only used 1/4 cup oil...baked for 30 minutes at 350, stirring every 15 minutes...then baked for 30 more minutes at 400.  Cut potatoes into smaller chunks.  Very good and crispy, not too oily.

Unbelieveable! I have made them several times for dinner parties and everyone has loved them. People have even asked for the recipe. I did tweak after the first time. I used a package and a half of the onion soup and used 1/3 a cup of olive oil. I also sprayed the baking dish with cooking spray so the potatoes wouldn't stick. I would recommend to all! A crowd pleaser.

This recipe is the best red potatoes I've ever eaten. I added a teaspoon of honey to the mixture and really like them better. With or without the honey these are great. I think the honey helps hold the mixture to the potatoes and also give a hint of sweetness to them. It's a good idea to use pam or butter the dish to prvent sticking. These are so good with the honey that you will like them as finger food!!!

Thank you, Donna for this great recipe.  The only thing I did differently was to quarter the potatoes so that they would be done in the 40 min. time frame.  The first time, I went strictly by the recipe and it took about an hour.  So easy and great tasting!

These potatoes were easy and sooo yummy!!!! I did add a little more onion soup mix and put in some seasonings into the bag and let it sit in the fridge for 3-4 hours in a big ziplock bag. They are so yummy, i tried this with garlic and herb seasoning and it was sooo good too!!!

This was one of the most easiest recipes I have ever made.  It was one of the best tasting potato recipes I have ever used.  The only down side is it takes 40 minutes in the oven but if you plan ahead and are already roasting or cooking in the oven it is pefect and will finish at the same time.  I will be serving this again very soon.

These were very tasty. Much better than your usual plain old potatoes. I did think it called for a litle too much olive oil though.

This was alright, if you like the taste of onion soup only.  I think roasted potatoes with olive oil only is better.

I stumbled across this recipe while trying to find some way to roast red potatoes.  I didn't have onion soup mix, so opted for vegitable instead.  WOW!  

This recipe is so fast and easy and I don't know what the rest of the family thinks, but I think it is incredibly delicious!

Nice change for a side dish.  It is important to turn these potatoes regularly so they do not blacken in the oven.

Pretty good! But I would add some garlic salt and rosemary. You could even use the canned potatoes for this. They basically just have to heat up and suck up all the flavours.

They were okay but not amazing.  I think I was expecting them to be more crispy, so I was a little disappointed.  If I made them again I would definitely add more spices to give it a zip.  By the way, thanks to the reviewers who mentionned using foil on the baking sheet--it could have been a nasty mess to clean up!

These are great! I made these with "Carmel Apple Pork Chops" also found on this site.  A tasty combo!! And its so simple, you can't screw this one up!!  I think it would be fun to play around with the variety of dry soup mixes that are available, such as the lemon herb soup mix...Thanks Donna!

Good recipe. I used fat free butter and canola spray instead of olive oil (less fat). It tasted very good, but a little bland. The kids loved it. Next time I will add some more seasoning and "kick it up a notch!"

to avoid burning the onions, I set the oven to 350 for an hour.  Came out perfect.  Use a good quality olive oil too.

I made this the other night as a sidedish for bbq chicken.  It came out okay, but all the little dried onions burned!  If I can figure out how to make it w/out the burned onion flaver, maybe I'll try it again.

This recipe is sooooo easy!  I pat dry the potatoes (leave skin on), so that the onion mixture adheres a little better.  I serve it alot when I have unexpected company coming over for dinner.

I only need it for a family of 4 so I used 5 small potatoes as well as 2 tbsp of onion mix and 2 tbsp of onion.  My daughter never eats potatoes but she ate those and wanted more!

I love this recipe!  We made it for a family dinner and all loved it.  It doesn't taste like onion soup mix so you'd never guess that's the seasoning.  I'm making it again tomorrow!

Hands down, my favorite way to make roasted potatoes! I added a little fresh ground pepper and sea salt, they were easy to make and delicious.

I made these tonight and turned out wonderful. Only change was just a tad less olive oil and followed someone else's advice in lower oven temp for 30 min then raised to 400F for 22 more minutes.

I read reviews and thought it would be good and boy was it ever. I did  not make it exactly as stated in the recipe did a few of my own changes but the basic recipe is good even better with the additions I made.

I may try making it again with more seasoning thrown in, but as is, it was kind of mild and lackluster. I do like a solid, simple recipe though. The payoff for a recipe with such few ingredients and instructions is pretty good.  Good base recipe.

I know most people say if you alter it, it's not the recipe.  I disagree. Here you have a foundation recipe. I used hidden valley ranch seasoning and garlic powder. I also cute my potatoes smaller and went with 350 with the potatoes spread on a sprayed cookie sheet for 30 minutes. Stirred them around a bit, upped the temp to 400 and baked 20 more minutes. My 11 year old daughter was upset that she had to eat a few of them for dinner.  Turns out it was her favorite part of the meal and I had served a delicious flank stank to go along with it!  Seriously superb foundation recipe!

I always use the nonstick foil for easy cleanup. There’s no need to spray the foil with Pam and your food just slides off. I made the recipe as written but the next I will add some garlic as some have suggested. Everyone liked this side dish that I have beet making for years.

This was incredible! The potatoes are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Onion soup mix is always on hand and the bits of dried onion crisp up nicely. I would recommend using tinfoil if you don’t want to scrape your pan afterwards, but I used a glass 9x13 and it was an easy cleanup. Will definitely make again!!!

The abbreviated chatty cathy top review and it works: Bake 30 minutes at 350 degrees and then for roast for 20 minutes more at 400 until desired crispiness. Watch onions burning though.

These potatoes were excellent.  What made them even more delicious was the spring of rosemary I included with them.  I took a bite of the rosemary with the potatoe and OMG, the flavors just made my tastebuds go insane!  Thanks Donna Lasater.

Why does the recipe call for the potatoes to be 'halved' instead of 'quartered'?  Pretty good otherwise.

This is not anyone's personal recipe, it is the recipe on the Lipton Onion Soup box! I made according to instructions and I cut the potatoes up too small so they ended up being crunchy and not much flavor at all. I really wanted a lot more onion flavor. I'm not much of a cook so I really need advice on how to add spices and herbs and make these much more flavorful.

I made this last Sunday using small red potatoes so I didn't cut them in half and my family loved them.  5 star rating from everyone - I didn't change the recipe at all.  Will definitely make these again and have shared the recipe with my family.

These potatoes were delicious! I didn't have onion soup or ranch mix, but found a packet of Brandy and Herb steak marinade and used that instead. As they were baking I made sure to stir to help avoid sticking to the foil lined pan. Everyone loved these and I will be making again. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Very good, I will be making these often. The Onion Soup seasons the potatoes very nicely. 
I agree with another reviewer, do us all a favor and only review if you actually followed the recipe. So many of these reviews are pretentious and irrelevant. Reviews are not meant to showcase how clever you were to put your own spin on the recipe. Start you own blog and share your recipes there.

I really liked this! The onion soup added a ton of flavor with absolutely no effort at all. I don't know if I used a less chunky soup mix than other people or not, but the onion bits for me were very small, so they got crispy and delicious. Great side dish!

I seasoned the potatoes with salt, pepper and dry rosemary seeds.  I topped the potatoes with Italian hot sausage links and baked as directed.

Easy & yummy. You can speed it up a bit by microwaving the potatoes for a handful of minutes first. That way you don't have to have them in the oven as long.

1st Time Ever Making Roasted Potatoes! I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! It's quick & Easy! I personally added some minced garlic  with the oil/onion bag mix & sprinkled some salt as they came out the oven, then broiled (not pictured) for 3-5 minutes! I would so make it again! Paired it with Chicken Parmesan Casserole

The soup mix did get a bit burned. I ate it despite the slight burned flavor. It want so bad  that it was inedible.  I found the  onion flavor far too strong. Had to add cheese to tone down the onion. I won't ever make this again.

This was super easy.  I am just not a huge fan of the onion seasoning - too much.  Also, I thought 1/3 cup oil was too much - the potatoes were too greasy for my liking.

It was good, however I used yellow potatoes because it was all i had on hand and added carrots.  Next time I think I will add a little bit more of the mix to it and try it with the red potatoes.

I thought this would be a great idea. But the soup mix did burn. Thank goodness I had covered the sheet tray properly or the clean up would have been a mess. And for sure I have made better. Just some basic spices and parmesan would work. Even I would use just salt & pepper over this recipe, In addition soup mix is not gluten free, so you take a gluten free vegetable and make it inedible for those who can't eat wheat.

These potatoes are super delicious!!  I made them for my family and they loved them.  The red potatoes add the best sweet taste.  It was a quick and easy recipe.

I made these for a potluck and cooked for half an hour at 350 and then stored in the fridge until the morning and reheated at 400 for 30 mins. I did bring them out to room temp for an hour+ so they wouldn't dry out in the oven. Turned out great and will definitely make again.

Nice recipe for a side, and very easy to make.  One thing that is really nice about the potatoes you make is that you can throw any leftovers in a pan and fry 'em up for a breakfast side with eggs.  They're delicious that way too.

I made these just like the directions.  The 40 minutes was WAY to long,. They were slightly burnt. But because i love red potaotes I will try these again, but only cook them for 25-30 minutes.

These potatoes are awesome!   The only thing I did different was to parboil the potatoes for 10 minutes (or halfway cooked) then combined with the onion soup mix and olive oil.  
Baked on a cookie sheet at 425 degrees for 25 minutes.  
I would definitely make this again!

I made these twice. To everybody that wants to make these, cook for only 30 minutes and stir every 10 minutes. The first time I made these, I followed the recipe exactly and they were burnt. Enjoy!

It was just OK. It sounded and smelled really delicious but fell short for a higher rating.  One suggestion on easing cleanup for this dish and any other, PARCHMENT PAPER!  Get a jumbo roll and never have a sticky baked on mess ever again.

This turned out great! It was my first time making roasted potatoes. I didn't have the onion soup pack so I used Italian seasoning and mined garlic instead. My family loved it especially my picky kids.

I rated this a four due to the longer cooking time at such high heat.  I used the onion soup along with some additional spices but it was the onion soup that burned. Next time I will lower heat and check the time.

Made this for side dish with country pork ribs & baked beans. Went well with them. I added garlic salt, parsley, salt & pepper. Tasted great except I wasn't fond of the potatoes being burnt. So next time I'll be sure to cook less time lol. Hubby and teenage daughter love it. It's really hard to please picky teenagers.

I added a tad bit more olive oil after spraying the bottom of my pan with Pam to avoid the potatoes from sticking. This recipe is so easy and everyone has loved it the 2 times I made it. We're having it as part of our Christmas dinner this year.

I made the recipe as written.  I found that the potatoes were a little dry but the flavor was good and the family liked them.  I may make some adjustments for the dryness.  Will definitely make again.

Loved these potatoes, easy to prepare and make. I added garlic powder since I love garlic, so it certainly is optional. Also added a little water half way through the baking due to the fact that  the onion soup was burning. Covered the baking dish with foil after 20 minutes of baking.  Definitely going to make it  again and again.

My red potatoes were pretty big, so I diced them up inside of halving them.  I used slightly more than 2 pounds of potatoes; I basically used as much as would fit in the pan, which is your average jelly roll baking sheet. I followed the advice of others and added seasoned salt, which made it way too salty for me, so I'll omit next time, or maybe just use a light sprinkle on top.  I added about five cloves of crushed garlic (yum), and freshly ground black pepper.  I think 1/3 cup olive oil was a bit too much; will try 1/4 cup next time.  I used parchment paper on the pan instead of foil. I baked for 190C for half an hour, stirred potatoes, then 220C for 20 minutes- was perfect.  Nice and crisp on the outside, and soft and melty on the inside. They don't keep their lovely texture the next day, so I melted cheddar on top and a few dollops of sour cream: delicious.
Very easy recipe, both hubs and I enjoyed; will make again.

Calls for way to much oil.  My advice, take every seasoning you have available to you, toss them together with the potatoes, toss in a little bit of oil, JUST enough to get the seasonings to stick, spread the sheet with PAM and cook them to your liking [soft, crispy etc.].  Of all the recipes I have tried, I stand by the ‘any spice is a good spice."

Tasty but too salty. Better to use something with less sodium. Homemade onion soup mix on this site would do the trick.

I tweaked the recipe to my liking. 
I used 1 tsp vegetable oil  and a little bit of seasonal all for a kick, I used minced garlic, pepper, dash of salt, and garlic powder. I coated the potatoes, preheated my oven to 350 degrees. I put it in the oven for 20 ,minutes . I tossed it around then put it back in the oven for another 20 minutes. I had that with some baked chicken and spicy barbecue sauce.

I used slightly less olive oil for 2 pounds of red potatoes, and it was perfect. Like other reviewers, I tweaked the recipe by adding freshly minced garlic and basil to the marinade. The potatoes came out crispy and nicely seasoned! They tasted more like home-fried potatoes than for dinner, but they delicious nonetheless!

Quartered the 2 lb bag of petite baby reds I had. Also, used a packet of the beefy onion soup mix. I put it in my food processor and ground it to almost a powder. That kept it from burning in the oven. Mixed it w/the olive oil in a ziploc bag and then added the potatoes to coat. Let it sit for maybe 20 minutes and then poured out onto a foil lined cookie sheet &  poppped it into a 450 degree oven. (I also sprinkled some Garlic & herb seasoning over it as I thought it might taste good for my daughter who isn't fond of just the onion flavor.) 40 minutes would've been way too long. Checked it after 25 minutes and they were good to go. Nice & crispy yet still tender on the inside. Everyone loved them and had no leftovers.

I wanted something besides the typical potato salad for a family cook-out.  I used 1/2 pkg. of onion soup mix, & added some dried parsley and garlic powder to the olive oil mixture, allowing the prepared potatoes  to marinate for an hour before roasting.  I lined the  baking sheet with foil, baked them at 350º for 30 min., then flipped them and roasted for another 20 min. at 400º.   I simply wrapped them up in the foil & took them to the picnic.  EVERYONE (including my very skeptical husband) loved them!!!!  YUMMY!

the only reason I gave this two stars instead of one is because I love potatoes and that part was ok but the onions were burned beyond being edible and I had to scape off as much as I could. I won't make this again.

Followed directions just like it said but I feel like something was missing. I think next time I will double the olive oil and onion mix because it all seems to go to the bottom of the dish and not stick as well to the top part.

Being a more "cook-from-scratch" person, I have used this recipe for years for when I "just don't feel like it." It's excellent. Just remember to watch your cooking times in proportion to the size of potato you use/cut.

This is a great recipe. My nine year old shook all the ingredients in a large ziplock bag and I baked and stirred occasionally. These potatoes are pretty addictive. Thanks

I made exactly as instructed and it has good flavor but the onions in the dry onion soup just completely burned! I would maybe just use onion powder instead next time.

I've been making it for about 10 years exactly as written. This is super simple and delicious. It's best consumed fresh (doesn't reheat particularly well). I'm sure the many suggested alterations are great but they are not necessary; this is a great side dish as it is.

This recipe is great, I have made it several times as a side dish to pot roast, the only thing that I have changed is I lowered the heat to 375, otherwise the onion soup coating burns.  Will definitely make this again.

Flavor was good, a little bland for our liking. If you're going to make this I would definitely crush the onions like previous reviewers suggested because they did burn.

I made these as directed and they were delicious. There is no need to change the recipe unless you want to make a different dish. The onion soup mix did not burn and the flavor was good for such a simple recipe.

The flavor was there, but nothing else.  I wanted to like this recipe, but after trying this, the potatoes were bland at best and just a bit scorched.  Good effort, but not my cup of tea.

I made this with homemade onion soup mix from this website -"Dry Onion Soup Mix."  Wow, it was delicious! Just make sure to use low-sodium bouillon...I didn't, and will make that adjustment next time, because it was a little salty.  Either way, both recipes are excellent even though I didn't have the low-sodium.

These roasted red potatoes were delicious!!  They were crispy and flavorful.  I just added a little more salt, pepper and chives when they came out of the oven.  Honestly, I added parsley at the end (which I thought were chives) but they still came out very good. LOL  Thanks!

Sooo good, and simple. I added a little extra garlic powder and black pepper and the result was perfectly cooked and very flavorful potatoes. I used a pyrex baking dish, and despite stirring every 10 minutes, the onion pieces did stick to the sides and bottom of the dish and burn. Even so, it did not negatively effect the flavor of the potatoes.

Love this as an easy side.  I use the colored fingerling potatoes and cut then into thirds or quarters which reduces cooking time to about 25-30 minutes.

I don't use 1/3 cup of olive oil, only about 1 tablespoon of oil per pound of potatoes. I've grown up with recipe, so I would know, but this is my favorite way to roast vegetables and you chose a good type of potatoes to use, I find these crisp very nicely.

Very easy to prepare and flavorful.  I took the hint from other reviewers and marinated the potatoes for about an hour.  I didn't use as much olive oil as the recipe stated.  I just added until it looked very moist.

Could not have been easier.  I used Lipton onion soup mix.  It cooked faster than 40 min, I stirred them every 10-15 minutes.  They did not burn.

2 20 13 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/13849/oven-roasted-red-potatoes/ ... Mine always take longer to cook & I cut into somewhat bigger than bitesize chunks.  This is the recipe on the soup box, as someone else noted.  I use half an envelope, 2 pounds potatoes (white or red), 1/3c oil; OR 1 envelope, 6 pounds potatoes & 2/3c oil.  'Gonna try it with a roast so the temp'll be lower.  I'll give results about cooking time.  :)  It is just good, meaning not so spiced you don't know what you're eating.  Enjoy it for what it is.  Easy prep & easy cleanup if you use foil... Don't try the lower temp.  It takes forever & ever.

Delicious, quick and easy to put together. It took a little over an hour though for the potatoes to be done. Will make again.

I bought a store brand soup onion mix, with the little onion pieces, and they burned pretty badly and made the whole kitchen smoky! i had to pick them off the potatoes, which themselves  tastes pretty good! they were well done at 30 min for me. i might just try some olive oil, garlic salt and rosemary next time.

I tried this last night.  I went with most reviews and added water to coat the bottom of the pan.  I also used turkey breast cutlets instead of a whole turkey breast, and therefore adjusted the baking time to 1 hour.  It turned out EXCELLENT!

5 stars with a few changes - I add more olive oil, and probably 1/2 a bulb of Garlic (so roasted potatoes / garlic). Also, add rosemary and salt. Cook until crisp on outside - Fantastic

It was a good recipe and very easy. Just needs a little more flavor so I think next time I will add a little salt and pepper to the mix. Other then that it was very good.

These are great! I never had any onion soup so  just use olive oil (don't measure just from my bottle with a spout). Coat in oregano, sea salt, garlic powder and a small amount of onion powder.  No need or the soup mix at all. Cooked for the recommended time and temperature. Yummy!

I also do this in the microwave. I cut the potatoes,  and add chopped fresh onions, sprinkle oil oil on top, then add package of onion dry soup,  at times I also sprinkle dry chicken bouillon on top then cook about 10 minutes or so, then drain off the oil. Yum my favorite dish. At times sprinkle on top Parmesan Cheese. Not for those who are watching their sodium or salt intake!!!!

These potatoes were so easy and so good!  My husband who usually thinks potatoes are a waste of calories (would rather eat more meat) couldn't stop eating them!  Then the next morning i sauteed the leftovers and we ate them with eggs, yum!

this is great and easy!  I didn't have any onion soup mix on hand, so I minced 2 garlic cloves and mixed it with thyme leaves.  It gave it that extra flavor.

Made as directed. Doubled the recipe and only halved the potatoes (as directed). Baked in a 9x13 pan and we loved them. Today I'm trying the herb mix everyone recommends. Definitely preferred the original recipe but they were both good.

Have made this one twice now. I put the onion soup mix in a bag and go over it with a rolling pin to break up the pieces.  I also have taken the advice of others and covered a cookie sheet with foil for an easy clean up.  Love this one!

Just amazing in their simplicity, and it really makes people think you worked at it. LOL You should see the look on their faces when I give them the recipe, it's that priceless "there must be more to it than this" look.

These were just great! I would suggest to spray the inside of the dish with Pam as some of the potatoes become stuck.

These are awesome! I just got a bag of baby red potatoes from my CSA and tried this recipe. The only thing I changed was lining the pan with heavy-duty foil. They didn't stick & came out perfect and delicious. Hubby thought they were really tasty too! Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

I have been making this recipe for years.  I spray heavy duty foil with cooking spray.  I cut up (2-3) good size potatoes the same size as you would for potatoe salad.  Add some olive oil (2-3 tbls) and the dry onion soup mix to a plastic bag.  Mix it around, add your potatoes, add mixture to foil, then wrap tightly in the foil.  Cook on your BBQ grill 15-20 min, shake, then flip over for about 10 min. more. We like them best crispy. Donner

I actually used garlic and herb dressing mix instead of dry onion soup mix, but they were delicious and I think there are a lot variations of this simple recipe that could work

YUMMY!!  My husband couldn't get enough of these.  I put them on a cookie sheet to get them to crisp up a bit.  Next time i'll use slightly less olive oil as they were still a bit wet, but SO delicious!

This is almost identical to the one on the Lipton Onion Soup box.  I don't use the red potatoes even though that does sound good. I like to add two lipton onion packets for more flavor, and I increase the potatoes to about 12 med. to large ones.

Very simple recipe and yummy!  I did cut the potatoes a little smaller and baked it a little longer (to make it more crispy).  This is one dish I'll make more often :)

Very TASTY! Very EASY! I microwaved my potatoes for a few min then cut them into small chunks... I used less oil than the recipe asked, and I left the potatoes in the bag with the seasonings for about a half hour before baking... i lined a cookie sheet with tin foil and sprayed it with cooking spray... I thought they turned out great!

I doubled the recipe and used only 1/3 cup of olive oil.  I cut the potatoes into quarters and followed the recommendation of cooking them on cookie sheets lined with foil.  I cooked them for 30 min. at 350 degrees, then another 30 min. at 400 degrees.  I also added a couple TBSP. of minced garlic to the potatoes.  Very good!

I'm only giving these 3 stars. They stuck to the pan, despite the olive oil AND cooking spray. They didn't have a lot of flavor, and they never got crispy. I'll stick to "Easy Spicy Roasted Potatoes", also found on this site.

These are a huge hit at my house.  My 8 year old son asks for them all the time.  Very easy to make.  I find that they take a bit longer to cook though.  You won't be sorry if you try these.

The onion pieces definitely burnt but it was fine - they still tasted great. I marinated them for a couple hours and then put them on tin foil sprayed with pam. I think the temp or the heating time, maybe both, is off. Mine definitely didn't take 40 min and I stirred them after 15 min. I also added a touch of pepper, salt, & italian seasoning. Yum!

These potatoes were amazing.  The only thing I added was a sprinkle of salt, pepper and garlic powder.  I cooked at 450 for 40 minutes just like the recipe advised and stirred them twice.  Cooked perfectly.

These were easy enough to make, but, I find them tastier with olive oil, fresh garlic, dried basil, salt & pepper. Wrap them in foil and place on your grill for a wonderful side dish without the mess!  BMC

I really enjoyed these.  I followed the other reviews and chopped the onion mix.  The potatoes were in twelvths.  I used garlic oil and also put garlic in the bag for marinating, adding some salt to the finished product.  Will definitely make again!

My family loved these, and so easy to make.  I did use gold yukons potatoes instead but I imagine the recipe would be good no matter what type of potatoe you used!

Very easy and tasty! I would spray the pan with Pam before putting on the potatoes. I thought the oil would be enough but they stuck to the foil. This will be a regular side dish with meatloaf at our house.

I thought these were ok.  They could use more more salt as well as some pepper & garlic powder for flavor.   I put these on foil sprayed heavily with Pam and they did not stick at all.  I turned them every 15 minutes which probably helped.

I made these as a side dish to my New Year's Day lunch.  They turned out great.  I lined the pan with parchment paper like someone suggested and I would definitely recommend doing this for easy clean up.

Where is the garlic in this recipe!! What a great easy way to make roasted red potatoes. I used just about 2 bags of the little red potatoes with the rest of the ingredients listed but also added 3 cloves of garlic. I sprayed cooking spray on parchment paper and roasted in the oven and the broiled them for the last 10 minutes or so to get them nice and crisp. Just perfect!!

Anything this easy that tastes good gets 5 stars.  I made it with carrots and potatoes mixed together.  Only other change was that I cut back the oil a little bit.  Thanks for a great simple recipe!!

This has become my go-to-side-dish when I have company over. No fuss and easy. Everyone always loves it.  Just bake on parchment paper and spray with Pam ahead of time. Then the potatoes won't stick to the pan.

These were really tasty.  Certainly worth making again.  Used the leftover onion soup mix from "My Meatloaf" recipe to make these as a side along with leftover meat loaf sandwiches.  The combo made for a lovely weekend lunch.

These potatoes were really good. I used grapeseed oil because it's the only one I had. I also used baby red potatoes. Delicious.

Excellent tasting recipe. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 just because I had to make some adjustments to it.

I boiled my red potatoes first for about 15 minutes...just until they were starting to soften. I allowed them to cool for a few minutes, then quartered them, and mixed with oil/soup mix. I baked in the oven for 35-40 minutes on 400. Came out excellent.

If you go by this recipe your potatoes will burn to a crisp.  I should have gone by the tips from the other reviewers, because I ended up with black pebbles that had a burnt onion taste.  I will make this again, but I will use the directions from the other reviewers.

Anything with red potatoes gets my vote! I steam the potatoes halfway first. I usually cut up them steam, then bake, but I forgot to cut up... Oh well, cut 'em up, steam for mmmm.., 10 minutes, let them cool a bit, coat in oil, sprinkle the seasonings on, put in a metal pan, bake on 425 for 30-45 minutes, depending on your oven, whoohoo! Try to let them cool a little before popping in your mouth, I didn't let them cool enough first because they smelled so good cooking and burnt my mouth. Oh well, it was for a  good cause.

Fantastic! I made this for a party of 20. The only addition was some chopped, lightly sauteed yellow onion to the mix before baking. And I kept baking until the smaller pieces were crispy...about an hour.

I suppose if you change the recipe and add your own seasonings this could become a 5 star recipe. This recipe exactly as written is very average. I thought it was a bit bland. These are the type of potatoes that everyone puts salt, hot sauce or ketchup on right after they taste them. Not to mention I lowered the heat while cooking and stirred and yet the soup mix still burned to the bottom of the dish. On the plus side they had a nice texture and turned a nice toasty color.

Great Recipe...I sprayed the bottom of my baking dish with olive oil to prevent sticking.  I baked them in the over for 40 minutes with out stiring (fell asleep lol) and they came out fine.  I also seasoned them with a little Mrs Dash and season salt...Awesome with ketchup!

I love this recipe.  However, last time I went to make it, I realized I had NO onion soup mix.  But I did have a packet of Knorr dried pesto mix.  I used that instead, added some grated parmesan, and it turned out GREAT!

This recipe is AMAZING!!! I made this for a quick get together while grilling out... everyone loved these potatoes! Pre-heating the pot in the oven gives them a nice "crunch"!

Very nice dish, especially considering how easy it is to make.  We really enjoyed the flavor that the soup mix gave to the potatoes.  We ended up cooking it a bit longer than called for, but otherwise followed the recipe to a tee.

Used 1 1/2 lb. of baby red potatoes quartered.  Used less than 1/4 cup olive oil and a pkg of Good Season's Italian dressing.  Cooked at 350 for 35 mins. and broiled for 5 mins.  Very easy and tasty.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is SO easy and tastes great.  I will probably reduce the olive oil next time, they were a little too greasy.  I also sprinkled some parsley flakes over the potatoes before I baked them.  Yum!

I thought this would be great for my Mothers 70th B-Day party. Well all I can say was that everything else on the menu was eaten until gone, these were barely touched, I thought they were a little tasteless so I tried to doctor them up with garlic, but I guess it did'nt work. Also way too much oil, I should have added some fresh rosemary and or fresh thyme I had both on hand oh well!!. I think I will try a different roasted potatoe recipe next time. This one was just not good. Thanks anyway.

The only changes we made were to quarter the potatoes, add garlic powder and pepper and to reduce the oven temperature down to 375F and cook for approx. 1 hour.  They were delicious.

I also quartered the potatoes. My stuck a bit to the bottom, so instead next time I'll cook at a lower temp. Great recipes, I think I'll also try ranch dressing mix.

This recipe was pretty good. I cut the amount of oil in half and it was plenty. Overall the recipe was easy and the potatoes tasty. I liked them better the next day. Like another reviewer, I noticed almost the same exact recipe on the box of soup mix.

I didn't really care for the taste of this recipe, I think the soup mix flavor is just too strong.  My husband, however loved it, so I think it's just a matter of personal preference.

I am not a good cook so I look for easy recipes.  This was so easy I made it without messing it up!  My family loved the taste.  I did cut the potatoes in 4th because of their size.

This recipe is great but I did make some changes to it as well.  I added minced garlic to the top and parmesan cheese and baked at 425 for one hour.  I also put foil on it for the first 1/2 hour so it wouldn't get to brown and crispy and it turned out wonderful.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Very easy to make and fantastic!  I used a combination of several different recommendations.  I used onion soup mix, dry Hidden Valley ranch dressing, garlic powder and chili powder (to give it a kick).  Great!  Thanks Donna

Very good, simple potato dish. I actually used a mushroom-onion soup mix combo packet and it too was a perfect flavored potato side dish. Simplicity IS the way!

I cubed the potatoes instead of halving so cooking time was greatly reduced.  I marinated the potatoes in a ziploc with oil & strained french onion soup mix for about 3 hours.  When I placed the potatoes on a baking sheet, they didn't look very coated with the mix, nor did they smell very seasoned, so I added some seasoned salt.  I think without the seasoning they would have been pretty bland.  They did crisp nicely and I would try again with different seasonings.

I give 5 stars, my husband says 3 1/2. These were simple to make and delicious. I used small new red potatoes that I quartered and baked on the bottom rack for about 30 minutes. They had lots of flavor and were slightly crispy.

Really good recipe, however I really changed it up. I used white potatoes, added a couple of minced garlic cloves, some honey like someone had suggested and then some parmesan cheese. I then sprinkled more parmesan on top halfway through cooking time. I too cooked at 350 for a little more than an hour. The potatoes were still firm, but that's the way my husband likes it. So success!!! Tasty!

What can I say except these were great.  Also this is a great starter recipe.  Just change the onion soup mix for any of your favorite spices and cook the same way and these are just fabulous. I would also recommend cuttin the potatoes into little bite sized peices so they have more flavor.

Recipe was a great hit, we also added fresh Mushroom caps to the mixture, baked along with the potatoes, beautiful brown color, and a great touch and flavor to the roasted red potatoes.  we added this as a favorite side dish to our sunday dinners. Thank You

So good, so good!  I used a little too much soup mix with less potatoes....was a bit overboard.  So, don't do that.  Made it again with the right amount of potatoes, and it was AWESOME!  Thank you for such an easy recipe!  My savior!

My husband loved these potatoes. On the other hand, I thought they were just a little bland. Not bad, I have definitely had worse, but not 5 stars. I will try them again sometime though.

Tasted OK.  I might make them again because the recipe is so easy, but it didn't quite knock the socks off of my feet.  The onions burned, and next time I will sift them out.

I was pretty disappointed with these.  Most of the little onion pieces from the soup were burned and tasted like onion-flavored charcoal, and besides that the potatoes were just bland.  I even sprinkled some garlic salt on, but they still need something.  They may be good baked at a lower temp.?  Maybe with some cheese?

Simple to make and tastes great!  I didn't have french onion, so I used garlic and herb.  I also added a little parm. chz., garlic powder, and seasoned pepper.  Quartering the potatoes made them cook about ten minutes faster.  My husband loved these!

These turned out really well. As advised, I sifted the onion pieces out of the onion soup mix and I lined the baking sheet with foil. I also cut the potatoes into eighths instead of halves, and that reduced the cooking time. They were delicious.

These potatoes were good and easy but the oil was a bit much and the onion chunks did burn in mine also, so sifting those out is important.

Everyone really liked these tasty potatos.  Very easy.  Next time I would use a little less oil.  Also, I would make sure I used a baking sheet where the potatoes did not over lap.  I think they would come out more roasted.

Next time I will sift the onion soup mix to get rid of all the onion pieces that ended up burning on top of the potatoes.  The potatoes were full of onion flavour - without those onion pieces it would have been right up my alley.  Mmm...

We let it marinate for a couple of hours in the bag before cooking. It was a little greasy but we enjoyed it.

This is one of the best and fastest ways to fix red potatoes that I have ever used.  I fixed these as our potatoes with our Christmas dinner and everyone enjoyed them and I did also because they were easy to fix and put in the oven and forget for a while.  Thanks Barbara

I have made this several times, and depending on what else is cooking in the oven, I've adjusted the cooking time for this recipe so that everything comes out at the same time. It always comes out great ,and is so easy. I spray my casserole dish with Pam first- clean up is not hard.

These were super simple to make and had a good taste.  A good side dish to make when 
when you crave potatoes.  I didn't think it was extraordinary but it was tasty.  I have no complaints.
I give it a four simply because it lacks depth of flavor.  But simple is not by any means bad. 
Thanks for the idea.  I'll definitely make these again.

I wasn't impressed with this recipe.  It comes right off the Lipton onion soup box, but I found it bland--needed more seasoning and about 30 minutes additional cook time.  I guess I'm one of the few that just didn't care for this recipe.

I just loved this. For Mommy's Day, it was my turn to cook, and I chose this, along with the grilled chicken and herbs and some stirfry veges. 

Man, we loved these taters :) Definite keeper and a great crowd pleaser. Thanks :)

My husband loves roasted red skin potatoes and he says these are the best he's ever had!  Couldn't have been any easier.  Make sure you turn over on pan frequently so they don't brown too much on one side

I don't do onion soup so I simply used Kosher beef base and dried onion.  I also added Thyme and some garlic.  I roasted at a higher temp too.  Otherwise a simple and good basic recipe.

I used double the amount of potatoes, little less oil, 1 pkg onion soup mix. Be sure to use a jelly roll pan or they won't get crispy. Turn once too.

I thought these potatoes were tasty and easy to prepare!  Next time I might try the oven at 350 to avoid some of the burning.

This turned out very good. The house smelled wonderful as they were cooking. I cut them into smaller pieces and it worked out great. The pan gets messy but it is well worth it for the taste. Thanks for the recipe.

I didn't like these potatoes as much as other people in my family did.  I had to add a lot of salt when I was eating them.  I still wasn't satisfied, and ended up dropping on some sour cream.  They are simple to make, though, and a nice change to the baked potatoe standby.

I thought these were really good. My boyfriend didn't like them as much. He likes a lot of butter on potatoes and wasn't thrilled with the olive oil. But I liked it a lot.

This recipe is great!  I have been making it for years, but cooking it on a flat jelly roll type pan - spread out.  That way the potatoes get really crispy and my kids sometimes dip them in ketchup and eat them up!!!

I am pleased with this recipe.  It was delicious and easy to make.  Finally a recipe where the potatoe is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, PERFECT! Next time I will remember to protect my pan for easy clean up.

I love red potatoes and was looking for a new way to fix them. This is easy and excellent just like you said.   I quartered the potatoes and added some garlic.  I will be making these often.  We all loved these potatoes! Thanks!:-)

These potatoes were great and had a kick!  The onion soup gives them a great flavour.  Beware: it's pretty salty due to the soup mix.
