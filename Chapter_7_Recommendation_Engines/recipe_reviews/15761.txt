These cookies, do not look appetizing,and they certainley, don't have a great taste. Crispcookies, do not go well with pineapple chunks.

Thanks for sharing your recipe. These cookies remind me of some my grandmother used to make for Christmas every year. Hope you will submit more recipes in the future.

I added used 1 cup of sugar. The taste puts me in the mind of a Christmas cookie. It always seems that holiday sweets have a different unexplainable taste that puts you in the holiday spirit. This cookie is definitely one of them. Love it!!
