Holy cow, these are good!  Don't change a thing, just pay attention and you won't overcook or undercook them.  Easy and tasty!

You can also drop rounded spoonfuls of dough onto a cookie sheet and freeze them.  Then bag them up and you can have more hot fresh cookies when you want them.  Bake at 300 degrees for 15-20 minutes, check often.  Yum!  Thanks Tiffany!

These are the best cookies I've ever made.  I did everything almost exactly as the recipe called for, except I added 2 teaspoons of instant coffee powder along with the dry ingredients.  I made them smaller than the recipe called for - made 3 doz, so they were smaller than the original recipe.  Baked them for exactly 10 minutes, and they came out amazing.  A delicate crisp on the outside, and a soft chewy inside.  They remind me of the double chocolate cookies at Panera's.

These cookies were extremely tasty, soft and chewey too. Everyone loved them! I added raspberry chocolate chips instead of plain semi-sweet for a change. Yum, yum.

Great cookies, though they don't hold their shape well if you bake the dough right after you make it.  I would suggest freezing the dough for a few hours, or putting it in the fridge overnight before baking.  Then, roll into to tablespoon balls and flatten into patties after putting them on the cookie sheet.  Try using butterscotch chips too!  Great combo with the chocolate.  I also added marshmallows to the center of them.  Don't mix marshmallows into the batter though, as they make the cookies impossible to get off the cookie sheet.

Didn't have chocolate chips, but that didn't matter; I wanted to bake some chocolate cookies.

I will look for no others, here or anywhere!

I made my first batch using butter -- I never use margarine -- but goofed and used baking soda; slightly crunchy with slightly chewy centers. In other words, PERFECT!

Second batch -- three days later! -- I made a double batch using baking powder as called for; these came out more chewy and less crunchy. In other words, also PERFECT!

Wish I could give this recipe TEN stars!

Pretty good cookies but not a five in my book.  I got about four dozen out of the recipe so I'll be taking a lot to work.  Ten minutes was a perfect amt of time to bake them but I only let them cool for three minutes and that worked well.  They were firm & easily removed from the baking sheet. 

For the first dozen I had only put in one cup of the choc chips because I thought I wouldn't want anymore but once I tasted one I felt that it could use the two cups.
  
The recipe didn't indicate what size spoon to drop the rounded spoonfuls but I used a regular tablespoon and they came out a nice size, not too big nor too small.  

Another thing, I definitely needed a glass of milk with each cookie or atleast a half glass!

This recipe distroyed my Easter. The cookies turned out burned no matter how long they stayed in the oven. They have two modes: Raw and Burned.

I've been cooking for a while and I have never seen such a waste of ingredents.

I halved the recipe to make about 2 dozen, it was difficult cause I had to convert all the cups to grams (live in UK) I baked them longer than 10 min with fan assisted electric oven, at 10 they were still liquidy slops! I took them out about 3 minutes later though and although they were still kinda spongy, after letting them cool they were fine. Very yummy and chocolatey! I'm only 13 so if I, a seriously inexperienced cook, can do it anyone can. Not bad for my first ever cookies! :D

Fabulous!  My mother is diabetic and doesn't get much in the way of chocolate baked goods, so I traded the sugar for Splenda and the chips for sugar free (Hershey) and hoped for the best.  They came out so good that I had to guard them from my family so mom got some!

I was craving something really chocolaty, sweet and this definitely fulfilled my craving!! They're perfect with a glass of milk or you can use two cookies to make an ice cream sandwich. 

This was my first time making cookies from scratch and I was surprised at how simple it was.  I followed the recipe as written, except I used butter because I don't use margarine at home, and I didn't have 2 cups of white sugar so I used 1 2/3 cups of white sugar and 1/3 cup of brown sugar, they still came out somewhat crunchy on the bottom, yet really moist and chewy inside.  Since both of my cookie trays didn't fit on the same oven rack I put one on the top and the other on the bottom and at the exact 5 minute mark I switched them (so that the cookies from both sheets would be as equal tasting as possible). 

On 2 baking sheets I made 18 good-sized cookies.  I also had some cookie mix left over (because it didn't all fit), maybe enough to make 5 more cookies, so I refrigerated that and will be baking more cookies once I run out.

Excellent cookie recipe.  Even a batch that was slightly over-browned tasted great, just a little crunchy.  Otherwise, these cookies turned out WONDERFUL, soft, and chocolaty.  I'm definitely keeping this one!

Pretty good. 10 minutes didn't seem long enough for my cookies to cook all the way through. Also, I cut the butter in half and used applesauce for the other half. I also cut the sugar in half. Turned out way good!

I ran out of brown sugar but needed to make some chocolate chip cookies to send for a school function. These are the best chocolate cookies I've ever made. Double-chocolates usually fall apart but these held together so well! I had absolutely no problem telling when they were done. 10 minutes was perfect in my gas oven on an insulated cookie sheet.

Cookie insanity!!!  You have not lived until you've eaten this cookie.  It's very sweet and very rich.  If that's not your thing, then you need to reconsider what your thing is.   Definitely make sure to leave the cookies on the sheet for 5 minutes after baking.  You will think they are not cooked, but they are.  Don't touch them.  Don't try to wiggle them off.  They are a hot gooey mess and just need to firm up a bit - not cook longer.  If you put them back in the oven to get them to be immediately removable from the sheet, then you will end up with burnt cookies.  Party foul.  Mine were ready to be placed on a wire rack after 9 minutes of cooking and 5 minutes of hangin' out on the sheet.  Make sure you have a gallon of milk handy for these!

These turned out delicious! I had no chocolate chips (or powdered sugar, as another reviewer had suggested) but it didn't matter. They are sooo good. I also only had half a tsp of vanilla, which was apparently sufficiant because everybody loved them!!

Wow, very chocolate is an understatement!! These are amazing. The only thing I change was adding a 1/4 C more flour, other than that followed the recipe exactly. Mine came out tall and perfectly sized. They are a bit crispy on the outside and fluffy and soft like cake on the inside. I will definitely be making these again!

Cookies to die for!  They took quite a bit longer to bake than the recipe stated but we also made them slightly larger than they should have been,
Very rich and delicious, both crispy and chewy - a near perfect cookie.  The next time we make them, I'll probably reduce the amount of sugar slightly as they're a tiny bit too sweet.

These cookies really tasted great, however it makes a ton of cookies, not the 18 as stated. Also the cookies needed to be cooked 14 minutes in my oven. My oven may be slightly off, but the cookies were still raw at the 8 minutes the recipe called for. Also the directions call for margarine and then the instructions say cream the "butter" and sugar. I ended up using butter.

Best cookies ever! My mom, who usually doesn't like chocolate, loves them! They are very sweet though - drink lots of milk!

Awesome, best chocolate cookies ever.  I made these w/out chocolate chips and rolled them in white sugar before baking, they come out just like Archway Dutch Cocoa cookies. A+++++++++++

Absolutely LOVED this cookie! I substituted the flour with whole wheat flour and left the cookies in for 12 minutes. A big hit at the office. Will make again tonight! :)

Even the dough is soo good, I'm amazed they even made it into the oven! Once done, though, mine were a little flat and a bit too soft (falling apart soft). I think next time I'll try adding a bit more flour to get them to stand up better.

This recipe ROCKS!  I made it for some guests at my graduation party and it got eaten within an hour or two!  Most guests thought they were store bought.  I did add extra flour, though, because I do this for all my cookie recipes.  LOVED IT!

Place the cookies on foil so the bottom of the cookies aren't so soft and crumbly.  I used two cookie sheets, the one that had foil helped the cookies to not fall apart and they had perfect consistency.  These cookies were yummy!!!!

I cut the sugar by 1/2 cup and thought they were still too sweet. Next time I'll cut the sugar to 1 cup. The chocolate flavor is awesome. Very good cookie.

Delicious! I recommend using Hershey's dark cocoa or cocoa produced with alkali.
The batter is thick, they are rich and cure a chocolate craving. Yum!

I added 3/4 cup of crushed up candy cane for a festive twist and substituted dark chocolate for the semi sweet chocolate (just a personal preference).  Great!

Everything was super good and chocolatey.
The only thing I changed is the time. I went with 11 min, but keep in mind, I do have an older oven, so, yeah, but didn't change anything else!

I have made this recipe several times and the cookies are well loved by everyone I give them to.  I do decrease the sugar by about 1/2 cup (because of the chocolate chips) but the recipe is great  otherwise.  I also like nuts in my cookies so I add macadamia nuts and they are a wonderful addition.

First of all, I don't like chocolate so I was making this with no taste testing and my mixer got packed away when I moved so I had to hand mix---eek! I was going to a graduation party and the only request was chocolaty so I wanted something other than a cake that everyone could nibble on. I had a lot of trouble with baking time as mentioned before, some were raw (to the point where I put them back in after they started cooling) and some were burned even though they were the same size cookies in for the same time. I added 1 cup of milk chocolate chips as well as the 2 cups of semi-sweet for it to be triple chocolate. For me the perfect cookies took about 12-14 minutes, still being soft and fudgey in the middle but crispy on the edges. I got 3 dozen oversized cookies from this recipe. I got countless compliments on them but be sure to watch them in the oven...they go from being raw to being burned like a snap!!

These are easy and really yummy.  I followed suggestions from other reviewers and added just a bit more flour, but when I make them again I won't bother - they didn't really seem to need it.  Otherwise as per recipe.  Made a nice "care package" to send to my son.  He will love these!

I thought this was fantastic. My only issue is how flat they ended up. I was tempted to add baking powder because the pics all showed a flat cookie but I can't stand reading ratings about how the reviewer "improved" it. The taste was rich and chocolatey, crisp edges and soft centers. I will def keep this recipe and hopefully find a way to make them fluffy! Thank you!

I made a couple of changes to this recipe.
I used 1 cup of butter, 1 and a half cups of sugar, the grated zest of one orange and 1 cup raw chopped cacao nibs instead of chocolate chips. I used a heaping size tablespoon of dough for each cookie and baked for 12 minutes.  I would make these again! I will use hot chili pepper in the next batch, instead of orange zest. I like both combinations.  Good recipe

Yummy!  These taste great.  They were a little flatter then I usually would want them, but otherwise a great recipe.  I added a mint kiss to the middle after they had cooled a bit to make a special holiday treat.

Yum!  I've made these several times already and they taste great every time!  I've even made them without choc. chips.  These are more brownie like than cookie, and since this is what I was craving, it worked.

Epic! These are the absolute best cookies ever. You can make them just as listed, but here are some healthy alterations that won't detract from their flavor. Use whole wheat flour, cut 1/2 cup of sugar, use half brown and half white sugar, use dark chocolate unsweetened cocoa powder, sub applesauce for half of the margarine, and use olive oil or heart healthy margarine for the other half. I made all these alterations and everyone raved about them. No one knew any wiser that I had cut some of the sugars and fats! Definitely keeping this recipe forever.

I was craving something sweet so I looked for an easy recipe with everything I had in my pantry. I found this recipe and decided to try it. I DO NOT bake things well!! I'm more of a cooker than baker so I was weary to say the least. 

These were so easy to make! I did not change the recipe at all! I only omitted the chocolate chips because I had none. These were plenty sweet without them to cure my sugar tooth!!
I used a regular sized spoon and made about 35 cookies with this dough. 
I baked them for 9 minutes and they were perfect.  Will make them again!!

Perfect outside and  chewy inside!

I thought these were very good. I did alter the original recipe a tad. I used butter instead of margarine and decreased the amount of from (1 1/4 C to 1 C), added 1/2 tbs more of vanilla extract, added 1/4 C. more of sugar.

I made these with my 5 year old, very easy to make and lots of fun! We used butter instead of margarine, and a mix of peanut butter chips/milk chocolate chips which turned out to be really good! They taste best when they have completely cooled and sat in a container for a few hours.

A great recipe that I use all the time.  I go whole hog and add in nuts and raisins.  The first batch burned a bit, but I just lowered the temp and cooked them slightly longer and then cooled on the tray.  I tried them once with chocolate chunks and dark chocolate cocoa powder.  Dee-lish!

These are amazing! My whole family loved them! But i read some of the previous reviews about the cookies being to soft which is true. So I put the cookies in for 15 minutes and the came out perfect! So if you're having trouble with them falling apart then just keep them in the oven for 15 minutes and then they should come out great!

I usually make recipes as directed, but today I was specifically looking to find a chocolate cookie recipe to use some coconut I have had for a while.  I didn't find what I was looking for but thought this one might work well to sub coconut for the chocolate chips, and boy was it a success!!  If you love coconut, try substituting the 2 c chocolate chips for 3 c shredded coconut. Yummmmmmmmmmmmy.  I'll try them as directed too when I can get some chocolate chips. Great recipe!!

Great stuff if you like really sweet things. It was so easy - and no butter required!! I substituted one cup of chocolate chips for butterscotch chips and it turned out great. It also took about 12 minutes to cook in my oven.
But I will definitely, definitely make these again.

These cookies are EXCELLENT!  My whole family loved them.  The recipe made 36 cookies for me, so I thought the original recipe yield of 18 cookies was quite low, unless they are meant to make super huge cookies.

Great Cookie! but hard to know when they are under cooked or well cooked, cooked for 8 minutes but wasnt sure if they were not cooked yet i put them in for another minute and they got burnt so you have to be careful next time i will just leave them at 8 minutes. Thanks you very much for an awesome recipe!

I baked these for my family and they were a BIG HIT!!! Everyone loved them but they are not good for a diet.

Wonderful!!  These are some of my favorite cookies!!  2 cups of chips = 12 oz. package. If they break or are hard to scoop/keep together, bake a little longer.  Thanks for the recipe!
