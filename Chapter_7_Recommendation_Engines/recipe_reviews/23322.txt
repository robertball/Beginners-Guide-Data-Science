Wonderful taste, just like a true cinnabun. I previous reviewer stated their cookies were a mess and spreaded too much - well my test cookie did the same. So I did it plain on the cookie sheet, without the "dollup of filling on the cookie sheet" and it came out perfect, at 350 degrees F, 8 minutes (1/2 inch slices). And for the true cinnabun experience - a glaze! 1 tb melted butter, 2 tb hot milk, 1 t vanilla, dash of mace, dash of allspice, mix well, then add 1 c powered sugar (keep adding and mixing till desired glaze consistency). Mine received raved reviews!!

These cookies get 5 stars for taste, but the recipe gets a fail. This is a difficult, poorly written recipe. I would not recommend it for inexperienced bakers or people with little patience.  Suffice to say if you decide to attempt it, do the following: Plan to chill the dough for several hours before rolling, and even then, it will still be sticky and soft, so roll it out between two sheets of wax paper (which is not an easy task in itself so alternatively, use one sheet on the bottom and flour your rolling pin lightly and continuously as you roll). Remove the top sheet and simply divide the filling evenly between the two rectangles, leaving none leftover for the 'dollop' (there is not a sufficient amount otherwise). Using the bottom sheet of paper to help you along, roll the dough into a tube. Wrap and let chill in the freezer for about half to one hour. Take a length of dental floss and cut the rolls into sections. Put one roll back to chill in the fridge or freezer while the other is baking. Bake on an insulated cookie sheet for 12 to 15 minutes (they will still spread to about 3 times their original size). If using a non insulated sheet, line it with parchment and bake for the recommended amount of time, or until JUST starting to get light brown around the edges(watch them closely).  Leave to cool on the baking sheet for about 15 minutes and then carefully remove to a cooling rack. Good luck.

These cookies are not only incredibly delicious, but incredibly beautiful as well. Many people that I shared these with could not stop eating them...there were only a couple who didn't care for these. I made the dough exactly as written, except that I didn't have any butter-flavored shortening, and used plain instead. I rolled each half of the dough out, and poured half of the filling on each piece. After rolling it into a  log, I put it in the freezer for 10-15 minutes. I cut it into slices, totally skipped the dallops of filling on the cookie sheet, and they were perfect. It is very important to cool the cookies on the cookie sheet for about 7 minutes so that the filling can harden up again...if you take the cookies off too soon, the filling will fall out, and the cookies will not look as pretty. It is also important to keep putting the dough rolls in the freezer in between sheets of cookies. All together, this is an incredible recipe that I will make again! Thanks for sharing!

These are so tasty!  I used 1 cup of butter instead of the half butter half shortening blend.  I didn't do anything with dallops..all the sauce was used on the rolled out cookie dough!  And that seemed to work out wonderfully.  The cookie was a hit at a pot-luck!  These do taste like cinnamon rolls!  And they are very pretty, with the cinnamon swirl.  Try this!

This is a great cookie! First off, I did not do the dollop either. I chilled the dough for 1 hour before rolling. Then rolled the dough out onto wax paper for easier rolling,using the wax paper to help me roll it without cracking the dough. After I let the filling cool and thicken, I used all of the filling in the roll . I used a whisk to help incorporate the butter better. I chilled the dough again for about an hour. Then cut the cookies with a sharp knife and baked on wax paper according to directions. I left them on the sheet for a couple of minutes then moved them to a rack to cool. They were very pretty and OMG they melt in your mouth! They retained their shape and looked like a cinnamon roll. I thought I would ice them, but found after tasting them uniced, they did not need anything else. Great with coffee or a nice cold glass of milk!

These ROCK!!  I had to use my egg substitue (which is a banana mashed with 1 tsp. of baking powder) for the 2 eggs and they still turned out fabulous!  I suggest doubling the sugar spread.  Instead of going through all of the trouble of flipping the cookie sheet and all that, I just spread a dab on the top of each cookie and that worked great.  I also had no problem with the spreading as I took Linda McClean's advice and put the dough in the fridge after I rolled it.  Worked fine, and I will seek that topping next time.  YUM-YUM!  Thanks Amber!

These were truly delicious but the dollop of cinnamon mixture on the cookie sheet wasn't neccassary, as I couldn't tell a difference. I still did it with some though and they all were very good. These also get much flatter and double in size while baking, so if they look small and tall on your cookie sheet before you bake them, no worries!

These are wonderful cookies!  You need to have a glass of milk handy though because they are wonderfully sweet!!  I used a VERY small amount of filling on my cookie sheets and didn't have any problem with them spreading.  Also you may want to use a tip I learned a long time ago and use dental floss to actually cut the cookies into 1 inch sections.  Dental floss works wonderfully for this type job!  The glaze that another reviewer gave for the cookies was great too!  Thanks Amber for a really super good cookie........I say ONE because that's all that I got once my husband and son got hold of them!!  :)

My daughters and I just finished baking our 600 Christmas cookies and this amazing cookie was a first for us. Oh my gosh, the whole house took on the most wonderful smell and the taste was just as fantastic. I did put the dollop of the mixture on the pan and didn't have any problems with spreading. Maybe it was because I chilled my dough after rolling and filling. I like the idea of a sugar glaze, but after baking so many cookies, I'd had enough, but I'll certainly try that next time. Thanks so much Amber!

Mmm great cookies! The flavor is delicate; not too sweet. They remind me of a cinnamon roll. The cookies are cakey and light. In terms of the method, I had to chill my rolled logs for about an hour to make it easier to work with; I think that helped. I also tried some without rolling (filling) and they were just fine. I didn't put extra filling below or above the cookie. Next time I might just make them sugar cookies unfilled and make a cinnamon flavored icing. After baking a few fell apart, so a tip: if you do roll them, I found that a fatter, more tightly rolled log made a prettier swirl that most importantly held up while cooling. I cooled them some on the sheet, too, and I think that helped.

I am a first-time cookie baker and although these were a little labor intensive, the end result was so worth it.. and if I can do it, any beginning baker can do it as well. I read every review and followed the advice of others: chill them before rolling out and freeze them after. Made cutting them w/ a knife very easy. Rolled dough out b/t pieces of plastic wrap, then use the wrap to help you roll a tight roll and then just wrap em up and stick in the freezer. I cut my cookies somewhere between 1/4" and 1/2" -- too thin and you can have scorched bottoms. 350 for 8 mins; 7 min rest. Then I used the glaze on top which made them absolutely perfect. I halved the recipe but next time I think I'm going to keep the filling amount the same because I had just enough but barely. I am gifting cookies to my friends for the first time this year. This recipe is surely going to be a hit!!

these are unbeleivably yummy! i chilled the dough, but had problems rolling it as it kept cracking, so i just gathered it up and started handling it til it was a bit softer. made sure i had plenty of flour down on the counter before rolling. i brushed the excess flour off before laying down the filling. i rolled it nice and tight, and chilled again for about an hour. this made it easier to slice. i didn't dollop any of the filling. i used it all inside the cookie. these will definitely grace my sweet table at christmas!  Oh, i used all butter, i didn't have any shortening.

Delish and easy!  Of course, I made a few changes.  I don't like to bake with shortening, so I used a full cup of butter instead of 1/2 cup shortening.  The cookies still stayed soft.

I froze the dough for about 30 min prior to baking.  I'm not sure how thin everyone else is rolling the dough, but I had enough to make 4 12x6 rectangles that were about 3/8 thick.  Next time I will roll them thinner so they can be rolled tighter.  I think I will also double the amount of filling (it wasn't quite enough).  For my first sheet, I tried the dollop of the filling under the cookie, but I didn't think it was necessary so I didn't include it for the rest of the recipe.  I also iced them with a glaze made with about 1 cup powdered sugar and enough milk to thin to a good "drizzle" consistency.

These are wonderful! Pretty simple to make too. I followed recipe as written, had no issues. Made for a cookie exchange and mine were the only ones completely gone. Will be making again later this week for Christmas!

mmmm good and pretty!I followed the recipe pretty much the same except I did make extra filling and it was perfect. I used 1/2 cup of butter, 3/4 cup of brown sugar & 3 tsp of cinnamon.  I made sure to refrigerate the dough, then sliced it. I am definitely adding this to my cookie recipe box!

Just a note about cookies you need to roll out between two sheets of wax paper. Use masking tape to secure the bottom sheet on all 4 sided. The top one use it on three sides and then roll out your dough. Masking tape will come off easy and then refriderate your dough.

Very good. I think if I were to make it again I would double the filling as they were not flavorful enough. Otherwise good and soft.

Fantastic!! Thanks for the great recipe!  I followed instructions and ingredients as original recipe, as well as took the advice from a few reviewers to use waxed paper to flatten, and to put the rolled up dough in freezer before cutting.  I put the dollop on top of the cookies as other's suggested as well.  Terrific, all my guests loved them!!!!

These are amazing cookies!  The instructions are a little confusing, if you split the dough in half and cut 1 inch segments you would end up with 24 cookies, not 36.  I used an average amount of flour to roll out my dough and it didn't stick to the counter but do take the time to chill the dough before rolling it out and roll the logs in plastic wrap and freeze them for a half hour or so before cutting.  I just sliced mine with a knife, I don't think dental floss would have worked on it right out of the freezer.  I cut all of them and placed them on pans right away but if you don't have enough pans I would stick it back in the freezer because the dough gets soft very quickly and the sliced cookies might be tough to move.  My cookies spread a bit and kind of puffed up like a cinnamon roll.  I did use all butter instead of shortening because of tans fats and I used all the filling on the dough and it was just enough to spread around.  Usually I have to add 2-3 minutes to the bake time because I bake on stoneware (just the first batch on a cold stone) but it was close to 18 minutes before I pulled them out and they had hardly browned at all.  As for people complaining about them spreading, getting too brown, being dry... I could see how slicing the cookies too thin could cause all those problems, an inch looks pretty thick...get your ruler out!  While the instructions are not fool proof the cookie is beautiful and delicious, and certainly worth the time and effort!

The bottom line is:  these cookies are very tasty!  I did have some trouble with rolling them up, but managed.  They weren't the prettiest cookies I've ever made, but delicious all the same.  I would agree to double the cinnamon/brown sugar mixture.  I had the better luck with removal when I used a baking stone.  I will absolutely make them again!  So what if they don't look perfect?  =)

MMMMMM...these are absolutely delicious! I did not put the dollop of cinnamon mixture on the pan because of previous reviews, and they turned out beautifully! Just like cinnamon buns! I also added almond extract to the batter and made a confectioner's sugar glaze with butter extract in it! I chilled the dough a second time after rolling so they would maintain their shape better when cut. Don't make these if you are on a diet because you will NOT BE ABLE TO STOP EATING THEM!!!

This cookie was AMAZING!   I rolled it out on parchment paper (i didn't even need flour) and then rolled into the log shape.   I transferred it to a baking sheet and put it in the freezer for about 10 minutes and then sliced the dough.   Just make sure you take these off the pan AS SOON as they get out of the oven.   otherwise they'll try to stick.   I used the pre-made sqeeze cookie icing and they turned out perfect....  they really do taste like little cinnamon rolls!   mine took 10 minutes to bake.

SO delicious! Everyone in my family loved these cookies! I didnt have shortening so instead I used half a stick of butter and a 1/4 cup oil, Worked perfectly and keeps the cookies soft :)

I'm half way through making these, and while I won't/can't blame my issue on the recipe itself, I found it incredibly difficult rolling these up. I read the other reviews and kept it in the freezer for an hour before hand, was generous with flour, but when it came time to roll them up, they were sticky, saggy, and look more like poor burritos. The point is, I found the whole process a little annoying and would like to say that while they smell great and I'm sure they taste great, the annoyance of having to roll them up may be a bit too much for beginners/individuals not familiar with baked goods that require you to roll them in a similar fashion (like myself).   If there is/was a simpler way to get past the rolling part, I'd probably give this 4-5 stars.

5 Stars for taste...these are really really good! Just got the first batch out of the oven. I made the dough the night before and left it in the refrigerator as I have 2 little ones at home. I have to bake around their times but these held up in the fridge and probably made them easier in a sense to roll out. I did use the plastic wrap the second batch and it was easier to roll into a log. I put the logs in the freezer while I waited for the cookies to bake. Cut then baked the next batch. I wanted to try these before I added them to my Christmas cookie list...they are a deffinate keeper! I agree with another reviewer though that they are not for a first time baker just for the dough being so soft. Thanks for a great cookie!

Just like a cinnamon roll's taste with a cookie texture! Excellent Idea. I did make the icing like someone suggested (you can't have a cinnamon roll without icing) and I used regular shortening. No dollop on cookie sheet. After the dough being thoroughly refrigerated, I still needed more than a light flouring to prevent sticking, but maybe that's just me. I froze the rolls before baking to make cutting easier and to prevent spreading. I didn't "flip" the cookie sheet, just lifted each one with a spatula after cooking. One tip I could offer would be to only put filling on the first 2/3 of the rectangle since it gets squeezed out when rolling or let the warm mixture dry for a while first. Thanks! Definitely making again!

I just got done making these cookies for the first time and wow, they are good. I rolled the dough out into one rectangle and put all of the brown sugar mixture on it and skipped the "dollip" part. I also froze the dough for half an hour before rolling out and then froze the log for 1 hour before cutting into cookies and baking. I also made a powdered sugar glaze and they taste a lot like cinnamon rolls! I will definately be making these to give out for the holiday's this year.

Awesome cookie! It does take a long time but the end result is so worth it.  I froze half the dough while it was rolled up and it freezes well.  I made the suggested glaze too and it was GREAT!  I will make this again and again. Thank you!

Very yummy, and so easy to make! I didn't have shortening, so used a cup of margarine instead. Wonderful!
I really don't see how anyone could fail using this recipe, and the cookies speak for themselves! Will absolutely be making them again.

These cookies turned out perfectly! I just pulled my second batch out of the oven, and the smell is overwhelmingly delicious! I admit they were a little tricky to roll, but otherwise everything went great! I am taking them to our Thanksgiving dinner tonight, and cannot wait to see my family's response. :)

PS- the cookies stayed soft even after they cooled.

These cookies get 5 stars for taste, but 3 for ease - hence the 4 star rating. They were much fussier and more time-consuming than I thought they'd be!! Note - make double or quadruple the filling, and don't bother putting any on the pan beforehand. The dough is very delicate - I had to chill it to get it out of the bowl! I'd advise chilling it as a ball, split into two, and roll out one at a time, lengthwise along a sheet of wax paper (rectangle shape). Then chill the rectangles (this was easier for me as its winter and I have a freezing cold back room and side porch). Then spread the filling on, and use the wax paper to roll it lengthwise into a tight long log, wrapped in paper. Chill the log again so that it will be easy to cut with a sharp knife. I made mine only about 1/2 inch thick, because they look prettier that way. My cookies took about 15 minutes to cook, but they were chilled before-hand, and I have an elderly oven.  As far as taste goes...they're delicious!

These will not be the prettiest cookies on your plate but they have very good flavor.  One guest couldn't stop eating them and commented on the wonderful sweet and salty taste they had.  I definitely will make these again.  As others did, all the filling was rolled inside.

When reading the number of servings(36) compared to the number of cookies into which the logs were to be cut(24), I became leery. Fortunately, I read some very helpful reviews, and followed the revised version of preparing them (and equipped with many years of making pinwheel cookies) ...cool before rolling, roll out between wax paper sheets, spread soft butter over the dough instead of melting it with the br. sugar and cinnamon, then roll and freeze.  Let thaw somewhat before cutting to avoid breakage. Mine spread minimally...about twice the size of the roll. I baked them for 14 minutes. They are a new favorite at our house.

These cookies were pretty good. I followed the advice of other reviews and tightly wrapped the dough in plastic wrap and placed them in the freezer before cutting. I also cut the cookie dough in thinner slices which made them bake better and gave them a little crunch when finished. I also made double the filling or else it was too difficult to spread.

this recipe is pretty tasty, but seems to be written all wrong.  DO NOT cut these cookies into 1'' segments!  they will spread on the cookie sheet and end up looking very ugly and nothing like the picture.  Your best bet is to cut them about 1/4''.  Be very careful removing them from the sheet as they will be very brittle when they are hot.  the overall result was ok, but if I ever make another cinnamon roll cookie, I will definitely look for a different recipe.

These are delicious! I didn't have any trouble with them at all. I didn't put the glob under the cookie, so I don't know if that made a difference. I followed the rest of the recipe and thought these were really easy. I also put a glaze on the top, which was an added bonus. I would recommend doubling the filling because I could have used more. I really had to stretch what I had. Then again, maybe if I had doubled it, it would have poured out like it did for other reviewers.

Incredible! Just like a cinnamon bun, but much less work and no messing with yeast. I used all butter, replaced the egg with a flax egg (1 tbs of flax seed ground mixed with 3 tbs water) and used whole wheat pastry flour in place of the ap. The dough was a bit sticky so I added a little more flour, probably 1/3 cup or so. I put the filling on top of the cookies instead of the bottom because a lot of others said it caused them to spread. Mine were done after exactly 8 minutes. If you like cinnamon buns, I strongly suggest you try this recipe!

these taste good, but they were completely not worth the effort! the dough was terrible to work with, falling apart when rolled out and difficult to roll up. also, chilling the dough was necessary, but as soon as you pour the warm sugar sauce on chilled dough, it solidified. i ended up with globs of sugar in some places and very little others. the rolled dough flattened on the bottom so the cookies were not very pretty, and the first batch was close to burned at 8 minutes. overall, these were tasty but mine look nothing like the ones in the picture. i will not be making these again.

A fun and tasty treat! As my BF stated, more complex than just a chocolate chip cookie... which is nice! It was fun to experiment with something different. Followed recipe ingredients and amounts to a T, but I heeded the advice of most reviews to skip the dollop of filling (I, too, didn't even have enough) and froze the rolled dough for about 15 min before baking. Yum! And, true to any cinnabun, it needed a powdered sugar glaze so it got one... perhaps making it a tad too sweet, but I loved how it pulled the whole thing together. **Note, I had some cinnamon chips on hand so I rolled some up...no bueno. They tasted good, just didn't look so pretty and made the dough funny. **Overall, great cookie! Great taste, great looking, great fun!

these cookies are excellent!!! we made a mistake when baking them at someone else's home and used bisquick rather than flour... uh-oh!! But rather than starting over, we decided to just wing it from there, and see how they turned out. We didn't add the baking powder because of the consistency of the bisquick. To make sure they didn't crumble, we brushed butter on the top of each cookie and they turned out AMAZING. After making them before, I think I actually liked the bisquick recipe better than the original, with flour!!! Oh, and we added the glaze on the top... superb!! :)

These were terrific! The only thing I changed was substituting the shortening with just another 1/2cup of butter. Honestly, I think it takes more time and effort into MAKING the dough, and rolling it up. The dough after it comes out of the fridge, will be very flimsy and easily breakable. I think working quick will be best when it comes to rolling out the dough. My cookies were smaller, so I ended up with over 60 cookies! Parchment paper is useful for this, so it won't ever stick. :) And don't ever think about leaving it in there longer than 8-10 minutes. I left all my 3 batches of cookies for 8 minutes exactly and they all turned out PERFECT. If left in there too long, the bottom may burn or the cookie can get really hard so don't do that. :P

These are wonderful.  I read the reviews before starting and saw many reviewers say not to put the dollop of frosting on the cookie sheet.  I didn't get to find out if this worked or not because I didn't have enough of the frosting to try it.  It made just enough to spread on to my 2 rectangles so I opted to make a simple powdered sugar glaze to drizzle on the cookies as they cooled and I think the glaze makes them perfect.  I baked them on parchment paper.  WOW they are so good!!!  Thanks for this wonderful recipe Amber.

These were delicious! I spread the dough a little thicker (about a 10X6 rectangle)than the recipe called for, and had no trouble with the dough cracking, and ended up with about 20 cookies total. I recommend spraying the cookie sheet with cooking spray to prevent cookies from sticking and waiting a minute or 2 before removing them, and using the leftover filling on top. Came out very yummy!

These cookies are absolutely fabulous! I first tried them about 5 or 6 months ago and have made them several times since. I skip the dollop of cinnamon mixture on the pan, as it does cause too much spreading. Be sure to chill the dough a second time after rolling it all up, before slicing as Angie2602 recommends. It does make all the difference in maintaining shape. I also use a confectioners sugar glaze sometimes. My family loves these cookies. Thank you Amber!

As I was working with this dough, I was cursing and swearing I would never make these again... until I TASTED ONE!!! Oh my lawd, these are amazing. My guests wouldn't stop eating them! I used Earth Balance instead of butter and upped it to one cup instead of shortening. You need plenty of flour when rolling the dough out; you must chill the dough before attempting the roll out. You must freeze the rolls once rolled up. Forget the dollop of sauce - it just made my cookies spread and collapse. Leave some space around the edge of the dough when you spread the sauce - when you roll it up it will squirt out. If you can serve them warm, soooo good. These take time and patience, but they are truly worth it.

Many of the reviews complained about the dough being sticky because of too much moisture in the batter. Decided to decrease the shortening to 1/3 cup and use 1-1/2 egg (In a small cup, whisk one egg, mix into batter. Repeat with a second egg, but only add 1/2 of second egg to batter). Otherwise follow ingredients as stated in recipe. The batter was firm enough to ball and not sticky. Also, I think the brown sugar taste is a little too strong.  Next time I'll try equal portions 3/4 cup each brown and white sugar. Suggest refrigerating for at least 2 hrs., divide dough in half, return unused half to refrig.  Generously flour mat and quickly roll to a 12x6 rectangle. Spread half filling and roll tightly (using a pastry scraper is helpful) Wrap with Saran and put in FREEZER. Repeat process with 2nd half of dough. Cut dough into 1/2" segments, place on parchment covered cookie pan. NOW put cookie sheet with cut cookies back into freezer for 4 mins. before baking. You want the  cookie dough as cold and firm as possible when placed in oven. This will prevent spreading while baking. They will expand but not by much. I also increased the filling by 50%. It was just enough for both rolls. No dollop is necessary. Also used 1/2 cup of very fine chopped pecans and added them to the filling mixture. Each oven is diferent but my cookies took about 12-13 mins for each batch to bake. Came out looking just like Leema's photo. I used royal icing to drizzle each cookie. Hope this will help.

Very good but mine turned out quite big and I only cut them about 3/8 inch thick.  Would not add cinnamon to dough as filling has enough. These look really nice!

Just a tip: Parchment paper makes baking/cooling these SOOO much easier (not to mention cleaning up)! Make sure you chill the dough well and use a cool pan for baking each batch to prevent the cookies from spreading. Oh, and 1 inch is too thick for these cookies, try 1/2 inch for a much better serving size (and better yield).

Really REALLY yummy! Dough was too hard to roll-too sticky. Maybe because I subbed 1/2 c oil for the 1 c butter and shortening combined. More flour would probably help that tho

I just made these cookies today for my nieces wedding.  Oh my goodness!!!  They are wonderful.  They taste just like a cinnamon bun.  I read many of the reviews and based on their experiences, I did put the two rolls of dough in the freezer prior to slicing and baking.  It worked out perfectly!  Also, I eliminated the cinnamon and sugar mixture on the bottom of the cookie prior to baking.  This also worked out great!  I had no problems removing them from the pans.  I also drizzled them with a buttercream icing and they turned out wonderful!!!  Thanks for the great recipe :)

This recipe requires a bit of work and time, more so than a normal cookie recipe anyway, but it is WELL WORTH IT!   I like to ice it with my buttercream icing just thin it down to a drizzling consistency.  My family loves these and I do too!

It worked very well!  I skipped the part about putting the left overs on the tray... I didn't get it lol (Im a novice)  I also heeded to the other posters advice about putting the log in the freezer for 10-15 min.  I also made the glaze as suggested and added corn syrup. I do need to work on my rolling skills though :-)  These were Awesome tasting!

These were a great hit at the annual cookie exchange!  I would suggest keeping the dough frozen throughout the cooking process as the dough softens very quickly.  I also only put 8 cookies on the cookie sheet because they do spread out quite a bit.  These are also great for breakfast with a cup of coffee!

I thought these were just fantastic -- tasted just like a cinnamon roll in cookie form!  The only things I changed were that I cut the cookies thinner than an inch, and used half the filling on each rectangle instead of a third.  Great recipe!

It took me a couple of tries to "figure out" this recipe. My only change to the recipe was adding 1 TBsp of flour to the filling to prevent it from melting out of the cookies and spreading.
I rolled the dough out between two sheets of saran wrap, and after spreading the filling on each sheet I rolled them up using the saran wrap. 
I cut them a little thinner than half and inch because I wanted them to be more like cookies rather than actual cinnamon rolls. Baked them at 350 for 10-15 min. Once done baking, I left them on the sheet, otherwise they would've broken if I tried to transer them. Leaving them on the sheet helped the cookies set and become easier to transer off the baking sheet.
Once I figured out the right way to prepare them they turned out great and were a big hit! I'll always keep a roll of these in my freezer for when unexpected visitors come over (which happened a couple of times, lol). The dough also cuts easily when removed from the freezer.

These were really sweet and tasty although not quite as good as a real cinnabun.  They are not too hard to make if you don't care about presentation.  Mine spread a lot even though I didn't put the dollop per the other reviews and were not pretty at all.

Excellet! The dollop of cinn/sugar/butter made my cookies spread really bad.  I omitted the dollop and they turned out beautiful!  Thanks for an awesome new recipe!

Really good, although I rolled it out, spread softened butter on it, sprinkled brown sugar and cinnamon, rolled it up, cut 1 inches cookies, and baked for 12 minutes... Very yummy...

Great tasting.. done just as recipe indicated. I had a hard time when I sliced the cookies keeping them round.. maybe I needed to refrigerate them more. Other than that, awesome!!!

This recipe was very hard to work with. I bake professionally and as the recipe is written it is impossible. The dough was greasy even after chilling overnight, I rolled out the dough on Press n Seal for ease of rolling and even then it cracked every time and I had to pinch it together. I chilled the dough after rolling up for 1 hour in the freezer before cutting, I would not have been able to be cut it otherwise.

What a great cookie!!! I did what was recommended by others. I ued 1 cup of butter for the cookies because I did not have shortening. I refrigerated the dough overnight, and after I spread the filling and rolled the dough back up, I refrigerated it for another hour or so. I did not save any filling to put on the cookies, I used it all for the inside. I baked them at 350 for about 8 minutes.  Everybody loved them. They fill the house with the sweet scent of cinnamon and sugar. Great cookie!!

These cookies are fabulous - I get requests for them from my family a lot. I don't do the dollop on the pan; I use all the filling inside the cookies, then top them with a powdered sugar icing so they taste just like cinnamon buns. They're time consuming, but people will be able to tell how much work you put in!

I thought I could make these work but they were not a success.  The dough kept cracking when I rolled them and although I refrigerated the formed cookies before baking they didn't hold their shape well in the oven.  I salvaged the second pan somewhat by slicing the cookies much thinner,  like a typical pinwheel cookie.  Great tasting but I won't make them again.

If you're a fan of cinnamon buns, you'll love these cookies!  They taste exactly like little cinnamon buns in the form of a cookie! DIVINE!  Instead of putting the cinnamon, brown sugar, and butter mixture under the cookies, I put it on top, so you don't have to worry about burning, or the cookies sticking!

This is a great recipe!  Looks like you spent hours and it's not a fuss at all.  I made these cookies for Christmas gifts and they were well recieved and asked for again and again.  The only thing I did different was I doubled the cinnamon mixture and didn't put the dolup on the sheet pan.  Just smeared it all on the cookie dough and proceeded as directed.  Great for company also and stores very well.

These have a good flavor, but they didn't hold a shape very well.  I tried cutting them thin and thick and it didn't matter much.  With such great reviews, I was expecting FABULOUS cookies.  Too much work for the end result...sorry.

These were a big hit!  I cooked them on parchment paper so I had no problem with them sticking.  I was very surprised by how easy the dough is to work with.  And I drizzled a glaze as others had suggested. Thanks!

These cookies were hard to put down, when they came out of the oven.  However, while chilling the dough, it must be for at least an hour and a half.  Or cut the chilled dough with something thinner than a knife, like a wire, otherwise, the shape of the cinnabun effect is lost.

I would give this a five star if flavor was the only consideration.  I did not bother with the spread under the cookie and they were still delicious. 
However, it is a bit time consuming.  I couldn't serve them to friends like I wanted to because they spread out like lava from a volcano eruption.  This is the 2nd time I made them and it happened both times. *Make sure the dough is very firm before you roll them out or they will stick to the rolling pin. 
If you like the taste of Cinnabun you will enjoy the flavor of these cookies.

This is an excellent recipe, the taste is wonderful. Very easy to prepare. 

I do, however, recommend that you remove the cookies with a spatula, as our first tray turned into a complete mess when we flipped it and proceeded to dump the cookies off the tray. Also, roll the dough on plastic wrap for ease of rolling the dough into a log.  Works great!

Taste was great but did not bake well. Ended up a mess. I’ve been baking cookies for over 30 years and not sure why but this recipe was an epic fail. I have an electric stove so that may have contributed to the poor baking. I’ll try again cuz the flavor was excellent.

These cookies are delicious.  I did not have any trouble rolling the dough  but I did refrigerate it for awhile because that is what I think should be done with cookie dough.  I found it interesting that the recipe said to be sure to remove the cookies while hot and several of the reviews said to cool them on the sheet.  Cooling them on the sheet is definitely the better method.  The "dollop of filling" underneath the cookie does nothing but add a mess.  This is why I went with three stars.  

If the recipe advised refrigerating the dough, omitted the dollop, and suggested cooling them on the sheet for a few minutes, this would be a five star recipe for sure!

These cookies are a 4 star as written but 5 stars with Irene522's glaze.  I made these for Christmas this year.  Half the batch I baked as written with the dollop of cinnamon sugar and half I used the glaze.  The dollop makes an unattractive brown circle obstructing the beautiful spiral and it doesn't add anything to the flavor.  I strongly recommend Irene522's glaze and just drizzle a quick zigzag on top.  My son said these were the best Christmas cookies I have ever made.  Next time I will cut them thinner than the 1 inch thickness recommended for a slightly crisper cookie.

Fantastic!  My daughter and I made these for her classroom, they were an instant hit. They’ve become a mainstay cookie in our house. Taste just like Cinnamon Toast Crunch. ??

By far my favorite recipe to make! I make mine vegan by replacing the butter for a vegan butter substitute, like Earth Balance butter, and then I use 1/4 cup of unsweetened applesauce for each egg. Tastes the exact same! Also, I recommend refrigerating the cookies after cutting them into segments and before baking them, helps to hold shape.

I basically made the cinnabun cookies as is except for changing one thing. I added confectioner's sugar plain with just whipped milk. I put it on top of the cookies like icing. It was just that thick. My children, ages 11 and 12, absolutely love them. They are extremely hard to please. Thank you so much for these cookies. They are a big success!

Delicious cookies.  Did not put a dollop of filling on the bottom of the cookie.  Did not turn out particularly beautiful - will try to roll and cut more evenly next time.  A little time consuming, but worth it in the flavor department.

these tasted really good but I wasn't able to follow the recipe all the way so the did not look so great. I did not have butter flavored shortening so I just used regular and I only had time to let the dough to rest for about 10 min. Regardless I think I'll be making them again soon!

My mother, father,  brother and boyfriend raved about the cookies and ate several soon after they cooled just enough to touch. While I had no problems rolling the dough, or  them sticking to the pan, or them falling apart (unless it was my own fault) I personally felt like they got too hard after they cooled. However, an easy remedy was to put them in the microwave for ten seconds. I also made homemade cream cheese icing to smear on them. When they were hot (including the icing) they really did taste like Cinnabon. I don't think this will become one of my regulars but I am adding it to my once-in-awhile recipe box. Thanks for sharing!

So the first time I made these I did not to the dollop (I didn't want to do all that work). After rolling the dough and filling I wrapped in the wax paper that I happened to roll it out on and placed it in the freezer before cutting it up. Definitely allow the cookies to cool on the cookie sheet before placing the cookies on a cooling rack. 

I Also made a simple glaze out of Powdered Sugar, Milk, and a little butter. I was afraid it would not harden at first, but after about 10-15 minutes it did start to harden.

This was absolutely fantastic! I used a glaze with 1 tbsp. melted butter, 2 cups powdered sugar, 4 tbsp. milk, and 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla that I added on while they were still warm!

I swear my friends only care about these cookies, not my presence at events they host. You can see the disappointment in their faces if I don't bring them.

It's a messy recipe. Have lots of room to work before you start. It helps if the dough and filling are cold before you roll it out and slice it. I would recommend at least chilling the tube of dough before you slice the cookies. That way they won't smush and leak. They're well worth the time and mess!

These were addicting. I don't know how else to say it. Sweet, crumbly, melt in your mouth. Yum! I took other reviewers advice and rolled out onto plastic wrap dusted with flour then used the plastic wrap to roll tightly, placed in freezer for 10-15 minutes then sliced and baked without the extra dollop. After they cooled I drizzled with icing. They did not need the icing but it was great either way. Thanks for the keeper!

Wonderful idea for cookies! One suggestion I have is to measure the flour using the "scoop & sweep" method. When I do this I fluff the flour a bit, use the measuring cup to scoop it up, then sweep off the excess with the back of a knife. This time I sifted other flour into the meas during cup with a spoon, then swept it off. The cookies, while delicious, are very buttery and flat.

For taste these are a 5!  By far the most popular cookies at the cookie exchange every year.

For ease of preparation a 3.  It is not that they are hard to make, just a little time consuming.  I like to make these and freeze the dough for 30 minutes or so before rolling and then after rolling and before slicing to bake.  I would not ever use the dollop of filling on the pan.  Don't need it!  And I have never used the cream cheese topping, don't need it.  I have also made these substituting pumpkin for half of the butter in the dough and they turned out great.

This is a rather difficult recipe, I agree, but if you play around with it and are an experienced baker it will probably work.  I refrigerated the dough overnight, then floured the heck out of of my board to roll it out.  This cinnamon mixture is odd; I think I overheated it and it was too runny with my first batch but with the second it was hardening and was easier, so you'd almost want to heat it up, then let it sit and roll out the dough.  I kept the rolls in the freezer until I was ready to use them, and I'm glad I did.  They were rather soft even after being frozen for a few days.  I cut it all with a knife (I've never been good at the floss method although I think it's a great idea) and cut them rather thin the first time. That made for a very crisp cookie, so I made them thicker and although they were crisp on the outside, they were soft on the inside.  The thicker ones needed about 12 minutes in my oven.  I didn't do the dollop thing; one, I don't understand how it would work and two, that seems rather messy.  I'm a messy enough baker as it is.  I don't need more opportunities to make a mess.  If you like sugary treats, I'd add a glaze but these were sweet enough as is for me.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are awesome!  If I can make these...anyone can.  I followed the idea of not putting the dollop on the cookie sheet and just puting all the filling inside the two rolls.  Also I sliced one of them slightly thicker than the other and I liked the thinner ones better.

Like pp said, the dough is quite sticky and a bit challenging to handle.  I rolled the dough betweeen sheets of plastic wrap, and it worked quite well.  The cookies are really unique and really delicious.  I'll be making again.

The taste was excellent, but making them was a lot of work and they also flattened out quite a bit.  No way did mine look like the beautiful picture!  I love the idea of a cookie tasting like a cinnabun and having the striped glaze on top, so maybe another time I'll make the same dough but shape them differently.

5 stars for flavor, 2 stars for appearance.  I'm going to try these again because they are tasty, but they definitely didn't look like the ones in the pictures.  Next time, I'll try adding more flour and cutting them into 1/2 inch slices, instead of one inch slices.  
**update** I've made these many time because they taste GREAT, it works best to put these in the freezer for 30 minutes before baking and that helps reduce the spread.

This recipe was great! They stayed puffed up and tasted so good. I made up the dough and refrigerated it overnight. I put a little flour directly onto some plastic wrap and rolled it out on there. I then just put a smear of soft butter with brown sugar and cinnamon on top instead of melting it altogether. I then used the plastic wrap to help roll it into a log and then put it back in the fridge for another couple of hours. I had absolutely no problem with the dough falling apart doing it this way. I did not put a dollop of the cinnamon sugar mixture on my cookie sheet, and it did not need it at all. I think you just need to plan ahead to make these cookies. They were wonderful!!! My family loves them. Will definitely make again! They also looked really pretty!

Huge hit at the office!  After reading the reviews I eliminated the drops of cinnamon/butter/sugar mixture onto the cookie sheet. I made a glaze of confectioner sugar, milk and cinnamon and placed that on top of the cookies right after I took them out of the oven.  I made a mistake with the first batch and took them out to soon because I was afraid that they were getting too brown.  These cookies can handle being in the oven for 9-10 minutes (they will look dark brown but they are not burned). Fantastic recipe!

These cookies were okay.  Definitely not an easy, quick recipe.  Not sure if they're worth all the effort.  The flavor was good, but the texture was was too hard.

Delicious melty, cinnamony cookies!!  I could not get the cookie dough to roll even with flour and chilling it was to sticky and soft.  I ended up taking a tsp full of dough and rolled it into a ball then dipped a flat bottom glass into flour to push the cookies flat, then I put the filling into a pastry bag with a medium writing tip and swirled the filling on top of the cookie.  They turned out beautiful!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

These were okay, but they didn't taste anything like a cinnamon bun to me.  Maybe I sliced them too thinly and/or baked them too long but they were kind of dry and crunchy.  Also I think the brown sugar I used in the dough was too dark so the pretty swirl effect was totally lost, and that would probably have been the only redeeming feature in this otherwise unremarkable cookie.

Well, my dough was a bit hard to work with but manageable. I kind of rolled/worked it with my fingers to get the rectangle shape. I added all the filling and then cut the rectangles in half and then rolled them (made the logs easier to move to the freezer). Then I put the logs into the freezer for 10min before cutting. Made it very easy. Let them cool on the sheets for 7-8min after taking them out.

Very Good!  I didn't put the filling in on the cookie sheet before putting the cookie on.  I made 3/4 of the filling recipe and put it all in the center of the cookie.  I also placed the cookies in the freezer for a couple minutes before baking.  Make sure you do not add too much flour to the dough when rolling out and allow to slightly warm up to room temperature before you roll into a ball.   Hope that helps!

OMG! Just as good after they have cooled as they where from the oven. I didn't use the dollop but did use parchment paper and they turned out perfect; icing them as suggested. I thought I might want more fillingthe next time but the end result was just fantastic as written.

These didn't work for me.  the dough was very flavorful but the cookies just weren't.  They did spread a lot when I didn't use the dollop on the cookie sheet but when I did use the dollop they burned on the bottom.  I also found the dough very hard to work with, it was very stiff.

These were really good. They got rave reviews! I used larkspur's advice and froze the logs. I had some trouble rolling the dough out so I would generously flour the surface you are working with. Also, slather on the filling and make sure it really gets combined. I did not use a dollop on the cookie sheet. Yum!

Wonderful cookies! I divided the dough into four, because my counter tops are small, and wouldnt have had room to roll them out, so I was wishing I had a little more filling, other than that, they were great. So chewy right out of the oven. This recipe is a keeper.

The flavor & texture of these cookies are much more than 5 stars-these are incredible!! I did make changes to the baking method but I just can't bring myself to knock off a star because of it. I didn't do the dollop, just spread the entire mixture on the dough, rolled up & put in the fridge for 2 hrs before slicing. I baked on an ungreased sheet. Mine took 14 min per sheet. I need a little practice on the rolling, as I only got about 24 big cookies-I would've preferred them to be smaller. I'll keep practicing, tho! Thank you so much for this recipe LEEMA!!

I followed the directions exactly but did not have a good turn out.  Trying to get the dough to roll out flat and then roll up, and then slice was a complete disaster.  In the end my husband had to complete the job because I was getting so frustrated.  The cookies tasted decent, but not worth making again, even if I could have gotten them to look all pretty.

So this recipe is great.  It did make me laugh though.  I used to work for Borders (the bookstore) and they used to bake cinnamon scones in their cafes that tasted exactly like this cookie!  I would change two things with this recipe... I would add cinnamon chips in next time and not bother with the rolling, instead I would make them into small triangles.  They would make perfect cinnamon scones!

These were amazing! Like other reviewers, I didn't put any cinnamon mixture on the pan - rather I put it all inside and used a powdered sugar glaze someone suggested. I also chilled the dough after making, and after rolling them so they were easier to cut (a sharp knife worked just fine). I served these at my first house party last weekend, and they were a hit!

Incredibly good, tender and sweet! Deserves 10 stars! Thank you so much for this recipe.  It was also very easy to make.  I was worried when I saw how soft the dough was, but chilling for an hour as instructed did the trick.  I made icing for these cookies, but after tasting how sweet they are, decided icing was overkill.  My husband put icing on his own cookies only and the rest of us were happy with them plain.  Absolutely beautiful cookies with a lovely texture.  (I only had plain shortening & added all filling to inside of cookies,otherwise no changes to recipe.)

This recipe was good, but one change I made needed me to do lots of tweaking, and I'll have to re-do the recipe.  I didn't like the thought of using shortening, let alone butter-flavored shortening.  So, I used a half cup of applesauce instead.  Well, it added too much liquidity, and after leaving the dough in the fridge for an hour, the dough was WAY too doughy.  We had to add a lot more flour to it, and as a result, the dough didn't have as much flavor as it could have.  So, with some tweaking, this could be a great recipe.

Pretty good cookie, but there's a lot of effort put in for what comes out. Definitely be sure to chill the dough after putting on the melted butter/brown sugar, otherwise there will be a lot of mess. And I needed to make two servings of the melted concotion to fit all the dough. Barely enough of the dollops, which definitely makes the cookie better!  I might try with the frosting next time, but these cookies are surely not for those trying to keep down calories.

Wow! My husband and I made 15 different types of cookies, all recipes from this website.  This cookie was by far the BEST of all of them.  We didn't do the dollop of cinnamon sugar on the cookie sheet; just concentrated all of the mixture in the rolls.  They came out perfect!  Soft, chewy, delicious and a nice looking addition to the Christmas Cookie tray!

wow i totally invented these on my own too...

the only things i do differently:

*sometimes ill make a powdered sugar glaze
*if it's for me, ill use i can't believe its not butter spray instead of butter for the middle...less calories...hoo-rah
*if it's for my brother who is a teenage boy who enjoys a fast metabolism, i brown the butter for the inside...makes it caramelly.

These tasted ok, sweet and cinnamony. However, I don't know that they were worth all the effort required. My first tray into the oven came out huge and lumpy looking (they also took more than 10 minutes to cook). So, for my next batch of slices I cut them much smaller than 1-inch. The cookies came out better looking and more reasonable sized, but I misjudged the cooking time and they were hard. I threw out the hard ones and we'll eat the big ugly ones, but they won't be going onto my Christmas cookie plate.

These cookies are so good!!  But, it took a couple of trial batches to get them to turn out that way.  My first batch the cinnamon and sugar mixture oozed out of the dough while I was trying to roll it up.  To fix that the next time I just melted the butter and brushed it on the dough and then sprinkled the cinnamon and sugar on top.  I never bothered with the dollop underneath the cookies either. I also make a glaze with powdered sugar and milk and dip the tops of the cookies.  Overall, this recipe is great, it just needs a little tweaking.

This recipe was great! I did omit the "extra dollop" as a previous reviewer suggested. I when you take the cookies out of the oven though...let them sit for 2 minutes then remove gently with a spatula and let finish cooling on a cooling rack. Awesome taste...don't even need the icing if you don't want it. I'm in love with these cookies!

These cookies were great!  They spread a little too much, but the flavor and aroma was perfect!  Thanks Amber!

Sorry to be the "downer", but these did not knock my socks off like they did for everyone else, sorry. 
I'm not making them ever again.

Cookies are great. Instructions of the recipe strange. I don't put the filling on the bottom of the pan. I put them right on top of the cookie. This is both easier and prettier.

These cookies are absolutely delicious and so easy to prepare!  The taste is wonderful - they are actually dangerous around our house as they are so hard to resist!

These are really good.  When they come out of the oven they look like they should go back in, but once cooled they're actually done.  My husband to be gave these a 10!

I did not put the dollup on the bottom of the cookie due to the previews I had read.  I think these would be better with an icing or cream cheese frosting.  They are best when warm from the oven.

Tastes just as the name suggests.  Excellent texure.  Dough very easy to work with.  I did, however, find it easier to allow the cookie to set up a minute or two before removing from baking pan.
