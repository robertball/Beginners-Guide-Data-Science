Hello, I am the submitter of this recipe. I hope you enjoy these cookies! They are great for a Christmas or a holiday tray, a pot-luck, or just a nice treat with coffee any time of the year. Make sure to very finely chop the sweetened coconut, it only comes shredded. All of the ingredients are neccessary to hold the cookie together very well. I use parchment paper to avoid sticking and ease with clean-up. A cookie scoop, will also be neccessary to create the even mound shape and uniform baking. Feel free to double the recipe if neccessary, to get 3 dozen cookies. Thank you, for trying my cookie recipe.

Made for Recipe Group. Simply delightful! Even though there is no almond flavoring, you get a hint of that from the cherries I think. I used crunched Frosted Flakes instead of coconut, worked great. Wonderful flavor and texture and easy to make. I didn't use a mixer, just mixed them up by hand and cookie scooped them onto parchment. I think next time I will let them cool before rolling in sugar though. Thanks BW!

YUM! Super delicious cookies! I have made this several times now, and I think it's become a favorite with me and my son. This recipe makes exactly 18 cookies with my small 1 1/2 inch cookie scoop, and only took 15 minutes in my oven. I have made them with walnuts, pecans and almonds and they all taste great! I brought them to a neighborhood party and everyone raved about them. This is definitely going into my Christmas cookie exchange this year, thanks for the wonderful recipe!

My son and his girlfriend loved them. I thought they were just OK. The texture of the coconut was weird for me and the taste of the cherries was too much. Two against one, so 5 stars it is.

Great little 5 star cookie - followed ingredients list exactly.  I used my Silpat baking mat versus parchment paper.  I almost added some almond flavoring but glad now that I did not because I believe that would have hidden the cherry taste.  Thanks for sharing your recipe Blender Woman!

I made these for Recipe Group. Using my small cookie scoop I got 20 cookies.  I like small recipes, and this one is both good and unique. I still needed to roll the balls, as just dropping them would not have produced a round ball to roll in the powdered sugar. My teens said they are okay.  Tomorrow I will share these with some friends. I will likely make these again sometime.  Thank you for sharing Blender Woman. Add: My grownup friends liked these a lot.

Just made these.  Had a jar of maraschino cherries that I bought to make a Shirley Temples when she passed away.  Figured I'd make a powder sugar cookie and use them up with that.  These are very good and quick to make.  I made small bite size cookies so got ~ 24.

Recipe Group Selection:  07, December 2013 ~ I'm a month behind on getting this recipe made - but glad I still went ahead and made them.  I am not a huge maraschino cherry fan, but they are really good in this recipe.  They add a nice flavor and make the cookie a very pretty color when you bite in to them.  I did roll in powdered sugar twice, but, both times was after the cookie had cooled.  Thanks Blender Woman for sharing this recipe.  It is a very good one!

I'm very late rating these for Recipe Group. These are nice, tasty cookies. I made mine a little too big and only got 14. They are easy and great for holidays; when I make them again, I will make sure I get at least 20 cookies, as I think they are best small. I will also add a few more cherries. Thank you Blender Woman.

This is such an easy recipe. For me it made a lot of cookies. I followed the reicpe exactly except I used pecans. Only problem is they didn't last. I sent them to a friend's workplace in a carton as I doubled the recipe and they were eaten before the end of coffee break with requests for more. Next time I will try the walnuts. Thank you Sarah

Loved the flavor of these cookies, but I must have done something wrong while combining the ingredients.  I ended up adding some of the juice from the jar of cherries to make the dough stick together.  I would make these again.

I made a double recipe.  I used 18 maraschino cherries and 12 dark cherries.  The cookies were done after 15 minutes.  They didn't roll that well so I sprinkled the powdered sugar where needed.  They are very good. The only drawback is that it took longer than I thought it wood.

I really wanted to like these.  The batch was tiny - it made 17 cookies.  I followed the recipe to a T and they were bland and crumbly.  Not something that I will make again.

Yum. These were good. I thought they tasted best fresh out of the oven before I put the powdered sugar on.

I’m a little behind on the recipe group selection for December 7, 2013, but better late than never because these little cookies are delightful.  They have wonderful flavor and an unusual red center making them a beautiful addition to your holiday cookie platter.

This was so delicious and simple. I got 20 cookies with this recipe and we couldn't stop taking one each time we walked by. Thankyou!
