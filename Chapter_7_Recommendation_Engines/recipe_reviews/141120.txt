Excellent basic recipe!  Traditionally, the onion is sauteed in chicken fat, but being vegetarian, I use EVOO like the recipe called for.  Instead of chicken broth, I use a strong mushroom broth, and then toss a dozen sliced creminis in with the onions to sautee.  Don't be shy with your broth and fat in this dish - it's where most of the flavor comes from.  One note on the instructions:  The way I was taught, you dry-roast the kasha in a hot pan for a few minutes, then bring water/broth to a boil BEFORE adding the kasha.  This way it doesn't get mushy.

I wrote this recipe and please note it was edited slightly prior to submitting.  I don't know why they did that.   I toast the kasha with egg in the pan first, then add the liquid (usually chicken broth or water with bouillon), cover for around 5-9 minutes and it's done.  I NEVER DRAIN my kasha.   This recipe is just a matter of preparing everything separate and tossing together.   When in doubt, follow manufacture instructions.  (hint)

This was my first experience with Kasha and I loved it! A very hearty and healthy dish. I used just one onion and added a can of mushrooms. Added a splash of dry white wine to the cooking onions and mushrooms. Used veggie broth instead of chicken. Tossed in some parsley. I'll make this again!

In my Eastern European home this dish is tops; especially when served with a slow roasted chicken. I add a drained can of mushrooms to this recipe...perfection!

As a child of Ukrainian heritage, I grew up with kasha.  And hated it.  With a passion.  As an adult I figured I'd give it another go, as it is so good for you.  This recipe made me want to eat more.  :)  I substituted water for the chicken broth, as I'm vegetarian, and used blood orange olive oil.  What a yummy dinner!  I had two helpings!!

Yum! I didn't have a can of broth, so I used 1 3/4 c. broth from the box. 12 ounces of the pasta seemed like a bit too much; I cooked it all but probably only used 10 or 11 ounces.  Saved a dish by sauteeing the onion in the same pot as I cooked the kasha in then mixing it all in that pot.  Also added broccoli steamed in the microwave to make it a complete meal.

This is my first experience with Kasha and it was very tasty.  I sauteed the kasha in a hot pan for 2-3 minutes before cooking (based on another eview's remark to keep it from getting mushy) I also used Swanson's Vegetarian Vegetable broth and whole wheat fusilli instead of egg bow ties.  It was very good

This was my first attempt at this, and I have to say I was sad, I know I didn't cook the Kasha enough, it felt like we were eating noodles and sawdust and that CAN'T be what it was supposed to be!

A great recipe, very easy
if the family likes their kasha drier, like my DH does reduce the amount of broth by a smige or saute it longer
by the way my DH said it was 90%
like his grandmothers

The first time I tried this recipe, I made it as written and it didn't really work out...I figured it was user error. Then I read the reviews and the back of the kasha box for guidance...what a difference! It definitely helps to toss the kasha in a bit of egg, oil or butter; of course, chicken fat would make it more authentic to my Bubie's. So next time, I may try to make my own schmaltz (chicken fat) and see how it turns out. Thanks Lobbylady for posting this recipe!

I was raised on this and it has always been one of my favorite dishes. It is so tasty and healthy. I never keep canned broth in the house, so I use other forms of chicken broth.

Superb! I fry the kasha in a hot pan for a couple of minutes first, like my Bubie did and I really brown
my onions and add a small can of drained mushroom pieces. But this is true comfort food in my
family. Helps colds, tummy aches, and anything else that ails you. Love it. Thanks for printing
your recipe.

This was a quick and easy reccipe for kasha.  I didn't have any onions so I used s small amount of onion salt instead and it got rave reviews.  I will be making for my holiday gathering for sure.

Should be called bowties with kasha.  Not enough kasha for the amount of noodles.  Traditionally, the kasha is coated with egg to yield more separated fluffy grains. Good quality margarine tastes better than oil.

As the submitter states in her review.  I found it vital to first mix the uncooked Kasha with an egg and fry it in a pan until it is dry (like the directions on the Kasha box says).  The first time around I did not do this and the Kasha turned out to be a nasty goo.  I had to redo it, like the Kasha box said and it was divine.

I have made this dish many a time. As a Eastern European Immigrant from Russia, where I believe, the Buckweat groats-whole or cracked were eaten in abandance (unlike in US). They're also Not a part of the wheat family, which is a great for many people !   Also-it is not called "Kasha".   Kasha is a Russian word, meaning hot cereal, sweet with added butter and sugar. Such as oat kasha, millet (gluten-free) and etc.  Whole roasted buckweat should be cooked for about 20 minutes totally covered. And in our authentic recipes, no noodles were used. It was great on it's own, with roasted in hot dry skillet buckwheat groats  and then cooked in even simmering liquid with sauteed in butter or O.O. onion with salt and pepper . So terrific and healthy.  I just wanted to bring in some historic clarification and info to a great recipe.

This was my first try of buckwheat or kasha and I followed the recipe as is, only halved the quantity, and it turned out great. I only added some spices that I love such as ground cumin and dried thyme. This recipe is a keeper! Thank you for posting!

this recipe is about the same as to the one I use, except I use whole groats, and fry the onion to very brown, not burnt. Must add enough salt to taste.
