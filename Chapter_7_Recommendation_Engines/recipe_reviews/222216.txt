This pasta salad is very flavorful and I will definately make this again! I used sandwich meat because I did not have any cubed ham on hand. I followed the directions completely and think this should be made a day ahead as the pickle and red onion will marinate the mayo overnight. I also used Hellman's low-fat mayo to make it healthier.

I did add 2 stalks chopped celery, 1 can sweetened condensed milk, some relish because I didn't have pickles,and some mustard.  1/2 cup white vinegar. Delish!
