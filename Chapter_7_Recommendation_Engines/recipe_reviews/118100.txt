This was super easy to make and tasted great.  I love cottage cheese and was surprised about it's addition to this recipe but it really does taste fantastic.  I wouldn't recommend doubling this recipe as I did becuase the cooking time changes quite a bit and it didn't turn out as nice when I did double it.  Thanks for sharing, this will go into regular rotation on the family meal plan!

I changed the ingredients around, but what I really love here is the broiling technique.  It makes for great presentation!

I am on a low carb diet and wanted to make an egg dish! This was perfect. I did it a little different because I did not have all the ingredients on hand. I followed instructions but only used onion, bell pepper and I used crumbled Feta Cheese instead of Cottage. It was FABULOUS! I will make over and over and over again!

This is very good and so easy and quick to make. Great for a busy night when you don't have a lot of time. I really liked the tomatoes on top. Thought it added a nice touch. Also, I've always made my eggs with cottage cheese and it was good to see it in this recipe. My whole family liked this recipe and will definitely be making it often.

Loved this although I had to make some changes because of what I had on hand.  Didn't have cottage cheese so I used cream cheese as another reviewer had done.  Also sprinkled with some dried dill.  I love dill and thought it was a delicious addition. Also did not have tomatoes but will try it again with them.  I added red potatoes that I par boiled and added to the pepper/onion/ham mixture and let it cook up more in the skillet.  I did not have an oven safe skillet so I put a lid on it to help the egg cook better.  Next time I will make sure to have a skillet for the oven or will put in a casserole dish and bake in oven then broil.  I can only imagine how good it will be after going under the broiler for a minute.  Can't wait to make again!

After cooking vegetables, remove, re-oil pan, add egg mixture, then sprinkle veggies on top, so eggs don't stick terribly.

Perfect frittata recipe! Followed it exactly and it turned out great. I could definitely see mixing up the ingredients and adding different veggies meats, like spinach or bacon.

I used this recipe as a guide but omitted cottage cheese but used milk in the egg mixture and added in some cream cheese on top of the ham/onions, Then on top of the cheese and tomato I added a garnish of jalapeño. I served it with salsa and a side of refried beans. The combo of the salsa and jalapeño made the dish for my family! This was a hit with my kids and my husband!! Plus it was very filling!

I tried this last night as I was out of sour cream which I use in my normal frittata and had some cottage cheese that needed to be used.  I used turkey smoked sausage in place of the ham and did not add tomatoes.  I also used taco-seasoned cheese because that's what I had, and it was fine.  Pretty good, easy recipe, but I prefer my normal recipe which just involves cooking the veggies and sausage and then throwing it all in the oven to bake.  It stays together much better that way.

Definitely a keeper! Even my picky son ate seconds, and a good way to have veggies in the morning.  Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious, I used roasted red pepper instead of fresh bell peppers, the eggs took longer to cook than expected and longer to set under the broiler as well, but I really enjoyed the end result and will make again.

Easy to make and eggs were not dry.  I used a cast iron pan (all of my non-sticks cannot go into the oven).  It got a little crispy, brown on the bottom, so next time I will throw it into the broiler sooner and I think that will solve the problem. Otherwise, a great recipe.

This is exceptionally delicious! If you haven't tried Frittata before you most definitely have to. Don't be intimidated by trying to make something new. If you can make an omelet you can make this.

This frittata turned out beautifuly, it is the perfect cooking method!  That being said I'll switch up the ingredients and seasonings to suit our tastes, and what we have in the house, but will definitely follow this method of preparation.  Thanks!

Very good! My husband's friend came over and I needed something to feed two hard-working guys and had nothing in the house but the ingredients for this recipe! (Except for the green pepper.) So I whipped this up, LOVED the fact that I didn't have to turn on the oven in this over 100* heat, had never put the cottage cheese in a frittata before, loved that, and subbed fresh parsley for the pepper since I didn't have it, but could still have something green. It looked so pretty and whipped up so fast- it was great! The only downside to making it this way instead of oven was that it wasn't quite as fluffy- but still not a big deal at all. Plus- one skillet meal! Woo-hoo!

Easy, quick... great recipe!  I added some fresh broccoli to the red bell pepper and onions.  I also used apple wood smoked Canadian bacon instead of ham.

For some reason, my eggs stuck to the pan so I ended up just making this into a scramble. It was still sooo good. Hubs and daughter both loved it. Will definitely make again!

Made this without the ham and added more veggies for a bridal brunch. It was a hit.
