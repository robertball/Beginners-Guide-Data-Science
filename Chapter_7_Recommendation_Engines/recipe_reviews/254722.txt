i have been making various versions of Brazilian cheese bread for over a year. This is a wonderful receipe for bread lovers...chewy, crunchy top and full of flavour. Very easy to make. Note: Once you add the liquid to the tapioca, let it sit for 30 min so the tapioca absorbs the liquid. It absorbs a lot!

I make this into buns and freeze the buns. I have bread to pop in toaster any time. This bread is always quite chewy inside and this is normal. It is cooked through, but remains chewy. A must have for a GF home!

Excellent!! This method renders a soft, gooey bread roll. Just the right amount of flavor too. I made three different batches to try different types of flours. Regular tapioca was a bit bland compared to fermented flavor of cassava flour. I also made a small batch with sweet rice flour. The flavor was good. The texture was gummier but still pleasant.  Thank you for this recipe.

I would have said 5 stars but the ingredient ratios are a bit bizarre here - way too much flour.  Check out other web-based recipes for brazilian bread.  My experience tells me they've got better ratios.  The bread?  Awesome AND fun

I scaled down the recipe and tried making these exactly as written and they simply were not working out. I agree with Markadoc's review that there's simply too much flour. I cannot have regular milk, but can handle hard cheeses. So, I used unsweetened coconut milk (the canned full fat one) following the measurements  and there clearly was not enough liquid. So, I heated more milk+oil and probably added too much trying to fix it. Dough didn't puff up and were not holding form even before putting sheet pan in oven---flattening too much.  Second attempt I probably ended up using 2.5 - 3 cups  tapioca flour to 1 cup of the coconut milk + 1/2 cup oil. Thought the dough wouldn't be right, but after adding in the egg and cheese it did form into a better dough, but seemed way too oily. Well, they baked and puffed up nicely and greasiness disappeared (will try again using just a little less oil). Loved the cheesy inside and flavor of the bread. Texture was spot on compared to what other recipes state it should be. Unfortunately, the recipe ingredient amounts are off and requires tweaking, hence the 3 star rating, which could be a borderline 2 for me as written unless I'm crazy and really did something wrong in attempt #1.
