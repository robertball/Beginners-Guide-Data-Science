Pork was way more seasoned than it needed to be, but that's easy to fix.  Overall just wasn't a fan of the couscous.

Very nice - spicy! (Too spicy for our kids).  I left out the jalepeno in the chutney, and actually used bulgur instead of couscous, which was still very good.  The chutney was lovely!

Delicious. Don't forget to de-seed the jalapeno.  The jalapeno seeds is where all the heat comes from.  I read the reviews and my husband and I love spice, so I was really exited about the 'review warnings'. Next time I will not completely de-seed the pepper because we looove spice.  I would serve the couscous on the side, not under the pork.  Couscous was flying everywhere when we were digging into the meal. I would make smaller pieces of peaches so we can have a bit of peach with each bite of pork.

Waaaaaaaaaay too spicy even for a guy who likes some spice. Back off on the spice for the pork and less spice on the chutney. The couscous was boring (and I used some leftover chicken stock to add some flavor) but then that is couscous so it is to be expected to be boring. The cinnamon made it a little more lively than it normally is. I will make this recipe again but cut the spices in half or down to 1/3. If you don't like spicy food move on....nothing to see here. If you LOVE spicy then go all out with the recipe the way it is and rock-on witcha bad self. Otherwise, consider the reduction in spice to 1/3 or 1/2 to start with and if you like it crank it up on the next go-round.

Absolutely amazingly delicious!  I'm not a fan of the ridiculously spicy, so I left out the jalapeno from the chutney and just added a dash of cayenne instead, and it was actually perfect to balance the spice of the meat.

One of my favorites.  I have made it with tenderloin and thinner cut boneless pork chops.  I make the chutney the day ahead to allow the flavors to mingle.  Otherwise very quick and only the name sounds involved.  A tasty way to introduce coucous to someone.
