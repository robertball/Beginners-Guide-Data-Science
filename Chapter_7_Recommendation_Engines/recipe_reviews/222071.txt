I was excited to make this for my 6 year-old daughter, but sadly, she didn't like it. She thought it was too sour. I would cut back on or leave out the lime juice, and double the sorbet.

Amazingly good! Serve at all parties we have cause it's such a hit. I do ginger ale instead of seven up but still just as good !
