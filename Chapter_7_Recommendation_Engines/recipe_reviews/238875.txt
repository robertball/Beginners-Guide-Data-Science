Definitely add this to the family menu shuffle.  I had to adjust these for my dietary needs.  I made them gluten free, dairy free and oat free.  I used 2.2 cups of GF all purpose flour, subbed coconut milk for the light cream and buckwheat flakes for the oats.  Mine came out light and fluffy and I was able to get 16 muffins out of this recipe.  I use silicone muffin cups that hold 70ml per cup.  I filled these a third of the way to the top.  The puff up nicely too.  Thanks Cheerios for sharing.

Scrumptious! A small rectangular glass dish, greased with Crisco, worked out beautifully. Baked it a bit longer than muffins call for, approximately 7 to 10 minutes. Test with toothpick. Thank you so much, Cheerios!

Hubs tried these and gave me a thumbs up, then got pouty when I said I was taking them to work.  So I reworked my container and set aside for more for him.  I got 18 out of this recipe, but I guess I have smaller muffin pans because that is pretty typical for me.  I thought they were okay--too chocolate-y and not enough blueberry for me--but hubs liked them.  I made these a tad more scone-like because I was going to use milk in place of the cream but ran out of that, so I used plain Greek yogurt instead.  That worked perfectly well but made them more dense than the recipe submitter likely intended them to be.  All in all, decent muffins with chocolate and blueberry if you like that combo.  Thanks for the recipe!

10.1.19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/238875/chocolate-chip-and-blueberry-muffins/ ... I'd be likely to agree with reviewers that said a bit too much chocolate, if I hadn't added an extra half cup of frozen berries.  That's what I do; add more blues.  I decreased sugar to 3/4c because I do that, too.  :) Spraying the liners probably isn't a bad idea since they stick on the bottom, but not horrifically.  :D  With the batter being thin, it's surprising the chips & blues don't sink.  Nice.  This recipe made twelve very, very full, beautifully rounded muffins ... https://www.allrecipes.com/personal-recipe/64032481/chocolate-chip-and-blueberry-muffins/

The worst muffins ever. The texture is disgusting. First time I picked a nasty recipe from this app.

I can't stop eating them there so good! When I ate one right out of the oven, it was kinda crispy than the middle was all gooey and warm. But than the next day the whole thing got squishy. the top is sticky and those blueberries are still tasting fresh.
who would of thought blueberries and chocolate would make such great friends.

These whipped up very quickly to get breakfast out the door. I used half and half instead of cream. Very yummy.

Quick, easy and delicious. My kids can make them on their own. My family loves these muffins, I make them on a regular basis for lunchbox snacks.

I made these with 3/4 cup chocolate chips and 3/4 cup blueberries.  I used 3/4 cup heavy cream (that needed to be used up) and 1/4 cup whole milk instead of the light cream.  They came out wonderfully rich and moist.  Next time I may cut the sugar to 3/4 cup.  This recipe is a keeper!

These turned out DRY! My kids won't eat them. I wonder if it's because there isn't any oil in the recipe. Bummer because the flavor is good.

I made 2 batches, one with dark choc and one with milk choc, it would seem that the dark choc got the bigger thumbs up (although personally preferred milk!)
I was confused with light cream?  So in one batch used heavy whipping cream and in another mixed half whipping with milk, honestly the heavy whipping worked better, but it may be worth trying half/half?  
Overall a nice recipe
