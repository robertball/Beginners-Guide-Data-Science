We really enjoyed this rub. It was just what I was looking for! I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I just used equal parts of cinnamon & nutmeg.

This was enough for my 8.5 lb. fully cooked shank ham. Didn't have pie spice, so used 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. ginger, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, and 1/4 tsp. ground cloves. Only used 1/2 tsp. ground mustard. Scored it and rubbed it all over the ham, then put it in my Lisk roaster covered and forgot it for 2 hours. It came out moist and delishious.  The juice in the bottom of the pan was great on baked sweet potatoes.

Fantastic!  We smoked a precooked ham for 3 hrs @230 degrees. I first smothered the ham in regular yellow mustard.  Then I used this rub over the entire ham and massaged it in. At the 2 1/2 hr mark I mixed up honey & BBQ sauce and put it all over the ham.  It looked and tasted awesome!  The entire family loved it for Thanksgiving.

I'm so glad that everyone has enjoyed this rub! I just wanted to add a quick note. When I make my ham with this rub, I preheat the oven to 550. I cook the rubbed ham uncovered at 550 for about 20 minutes. I then turn it down to 300 or so (whatever the ham directions call for) and cook it for the length of time called for on the directions. This makes the rub crust nicely and helps seal in the juices. I've used this method with all types of hams and never had dryness issues :)

I don't want to "mess with" the ratings for this particular recipe as is, but I do have some feedback that I think may help others trying this recipe in the future.  I, like many users of allrecipes.com, read a recipe, read some (if not all) of the reviews to get ideas on how to tweak the recipe, and then just go for it!  In this case I was working with not having the pumpkin pie spice or all the ingredients to make my own.  So I took the advice of another reviewer and tried garam masala in place of the pie spice.  I also followed another reviewer's suggestion and basted the ham with a basic yellow mustard before putting the rub on (in other words "under" the rub).  I also followed the additional cooking recommendations that the recipe's author added under the reviews to kind of crisp the outside of the ham and seal in the juices before the low temperature cooking (cook on 550 degrees for first 20 minutes) instead of having to cover the ham.  The results: 1) DON'T ATTEMPT THIS IF YOU DO NOT HAVE AN OVERHEAD FAN FOR YOUR RANGE (LOL, we are in a rental cottage and quickly discovered how loud the smoke detector is!  I'm glad it works!)  2) With that adventure behind me and the ham finished cooking, I am happy to say that the flavor of the outer/encrusted pieces of ham were FANTASTIC!  We were fighting over who got those pieces!  Thanks for a fun and delicious cooking adventure and good luck to you other adventurers out there!

I will never cook ham another way again.  This was so good.  It was a good the Heavenly Ham that my Mother in Law buy every year at Christmas time.  I used a smoked ham and cooked it in my crock pot for about 6 hours.  It turned out soft an juicy.  I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I substituted 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ginger, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and 1/4 tsp ground cloves.

Very good!!!!! I will def do this again.  I did it with a spiral ham this time, but next time, I will do a whole (bone in) ham.  The spiral ham dries up without foil on top.

Ok, I admit up front- I didn't have any pumpkin pie spice, so i had to substitute. In this case, I used Garam Masala in place of it. I had a very large ham, 12lbs, so I made half-again the amount called for, using 1 1/2 cups brown sugar, 3 tsp. Garam Masala, 3/4 tsp mustard powder, and I skipped the onion powder, since I didn't have any of that either. The dry rub smelled and tasted wonderful, and the ham came out moist and super flavorful, with a crust from the rub. It was fantastic, and a huge hit with my family! Thank you!!

This is a very good rub!!!  I made this, then kept all the juice, sliced the ham, and then put it in the juice to keep it juicy and have all that rub in the juice get all over the meat.  It was great!

This recipe is absolutely THE BEST! We loved it! Used a spiral sliced ham. I coated it with the rub thickly then placed it face down on a rack in shallow roasting pan.  Never covered it and it was wonderful and not dry very much like the famous ham stores, only better!

It was good but I didn't experience the "crust" as others have, even following the 550, down to 325 as directed. I probably wouldn't make it again, as I prefer more of a fruity sweetness. I'm finding it hard to use this ham in leftovers because of the distinct brown sugar taste.

Wow-this was delicious!  I usually buy the sprial sliced ham but this year opted for the whole half ham because it was so much cheaper.  I used this rub and was amazed with the results. I covered my ham with foil and it came out just perfect.  All of my Easter guests loved the ham.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Sweet, crispy, perfection!  There was more than enough rub for my 10 pound half ham.  This is definitely going in my permanent recipe collection.

Awesome, awesome rub! I, too, was short of pumpkin pie spice so I combine cinnamon and nutmeg in equal parts and ground cloves and allspice in a dash. This coated my 10 lb ham heavily and, as it cooked, the rub and the juices of the ham combined to form a heavenly sauce that I skimmed the fat off of and served on the side with the ham and mashed potatoes. Will definitely use this rub the next time I do ham!!!

I used this rub and baked a full spiral cut ham in a cooking bag.  I was a little concerned that the bag would prevent it from forming a nice crust on the outside of the ham, but it didn't.  It was fabulous.  Definitely keeping this recipe for next time!  The ham was perfect!

I didn't have any dry mustard so I used about a tbs.(maybe more)of dijon mustard instead.  It made more of a paste that I rubbed on the ham.  Loved this, will be using this recipe from now on.  I'll be sure to pick up dry mustard to try next time.

This was my first time cooking a spiral ham, and instead of using the glaze that came with it, I used this rub.  It was enough to cover my 10lb ham, including putting some of the rub between all the slices.  I'd been told spiral sliced hams can dry out easily, but after 2 1/2hrs, the slices were so tender & delicious!  My whole family was impressed; fabulous (and SO easy) for Christmas dinner!

Used this rub on a 5kg sugar-cured smoked ham on the bone.  Scored the fat into diamonds, rubbed in the mix, then studded with whole cloves.  Baked at 180 degrees Celsius for 50 minutes, basting every 10 minutes with the juices from the ham.  I made my own pumpkin spice from a recipe from this site, but due to allergies I subbed pimento (allspice) for cinnamon and omitted onion.  Absolutely delicious - thanks very much for sharing!

Worked great as a dry rub for smoking a precooked ham. I used a 12lb bone in ham.  As a result I had to make about 3x the amount of rub as the recipie showed. I'm glad I did because I used it all!  The ham I chose was not spiral cut so I cut some scores in the meat to allow it so soak up the rub.  I then smoked the ham for about 5hrs at 220F on the center rack of my smoker.  I used a water pan to keep the ham moist and Hickory chips for smoke.  The family absolutely went crazy for it!  I'll definitely in charge of the ham from now on...be that a warning to ye!

My husband loved this rub, my kids also are fans of this recipe. My advice is to turn up the heat about 400-450, otherwise it is way to hot!!

I tried this on my Christmas ham and it was delicious!  I didn't have dry mustard so I simply omitted it and it was still really good. I purchased a sliced ham, but the rub in between each slice and on top.

This was easy and delicious on our spiral-cut half ham! I'll probably use this every time we do a ham. Thanks for the recipe!! :-)

I did not have onion powder and it came out delicious.  The ham was moist and I used a spiral ham.  I will definitely make this again!

Turned a usually bland "Smoky Sweet" ham taste great, like one well cured in brown sugar, with a hint of heat. Trying it on a pork loin roast next.

I doubled the recipe to accommodate a 12 lb. ham.  As it cooked, I basted the ham with the juices.  Everyone loved it and I'd definitely use this again!

I have used only this rub on every ham I've made for the last few years and it has never failed to make everyone rave about how delicious the ham and juices are. I have used yellow mustard and Dijon mustard when I was out of powdered and it came out just as delicious.

This recipe was easy to put together and it smelled great when it was cooking in the oven. I gave 4 instead of 5 stars because though the ham was very moist & juicy,  it lacked  flavor...except for the bites that had the glaze on them.

My husband is a picking eater and normally will not eat ham. However, when I use this spice rub, he can't eat enough of the ham

I have made this recipe for Easter every year for at least 5 years; we love it! I have done it with the "heat blast" at the beginning (500 degrees for 20min-- I've tried to do it at 550 but the sugar starts to burn), and other years, I've just thrown it in at 275 for the normal cooking time. Both ways are delicious, but I do like the carmelization with the heat blast. I always need to add some water to cover the base of my roasting pan though, otherwise the sugars start to burn on the pan. I doubled the recipe for a 12lb ham this year and it was barely enough; would probably do 2.5 times the recipe for this size ham next year. I also cover the ham in yellow mustard before putting on the rub, as others recommend. It is delicious!!

Doubled for a 9lb spiral cut ham, add a splash of Orange juice to the bottom of my crockpot and cooked for 4 hours on high .... Unbelievable flavor and tenderness!

Absolutely the best rub for a spiral ham I've ever tasted! This recipe was plenty for me to cover an 8.5 lb. ham. The pumpkin pie spice gave this great flavor! Thanks for sharing....
