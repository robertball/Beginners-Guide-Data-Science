I made this as written except I used fresh tarragon and fresh celery.  We thought it was pretty good and will make it again.  I  will use half the bacon next time.

Roasted vegetables add so much more flavor and depth to your dish. I never thought of sauteeing them in the fry pan first, then roasting in the oven! Fantastic soup. Worlds better than the canned cream corn variety, hands down.
