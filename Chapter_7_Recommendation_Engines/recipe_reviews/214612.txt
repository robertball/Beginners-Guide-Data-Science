This is really good with sour cream and onion chips. I don't usually use meat tenderizer because chicken tenders don't really need it. I make this a lot on the nights where I'm exhausted and want a really quick meal. To save on calories, these can be baked in the oven, too. 350* for about 25 minutes or so. GREAT with a lowfat ranch dipping sauce.

This sounded good and I followed the recipe exactly.  It was so salty, we couldn't eat it.  What was the purpose of the tenderizer?  Sorry!

This was a pretty good recipe.  Very easy to make.  I left out the meat tenderizer and I used Cajun Herb and Spice potato chips.  Leftovers weren't crunchy anymore, but still very moist and tasty.

I made this recipe with bread crumbs and panko instead of chips.  No need to tenderize, as I used chickent tenders.  I had never thought about using olive oil instead of eggs!  It came out crunchy and tender and best of all, no deep frying.

I used to cater weddings and parties. I would do a recipe simular this but I only used butter and potato chips crushed. You wipe off the chicken tenders after rinsing them, then you dip them in melted unsalted butter and then in the crumbs and bake in a 350* degree oven till done. About 20 minutes. This one sounds good. I have not tried yet.

This is a delicious change for the same old chicken. I didn't use the tenderizer, as I thought it might make it too salty. Also, it took longer than the 20min. to bake, even though the tenders I used weren't really that big.

I usually don't follow recipes to a T....I tend to modify to our taste. My husband of ten years said it was the second worst meal I ever prepared.

This was an easy recipe. I omitted the meat tenderizer, since I did not have any, and substituted in onion powder. I also used veggie chips instead of regular Lays and the flavor was great!

i believe the chicken would have come out terribly salty if made exactly as written.. but with the following changes it was totally a 5* dish.. i greased the baking dish with just veggie oil and also sprayed the chicken with the oil before adding it into the flour mixture (used regular flour, the garlic powder, 1/3 of the salt, and the pepper.. no meat tenderizer).. dipped in egg wash and then pressed into the crushed potato chips.. if anything this was a decent starting point

Thank you for this recipe!  It came through in a pinch, I was desperate for a dish for my husband, and even though I strayed from the original recipe, I used the concept.  We don't have tenderizer, so I used a garlic & herb rub and a three onion rub (both from Pampered Chef) in the flour (and I just used reg. flour), and he loves it!  We're going to try Sour Cream & Onion Pringles next time, to add another layer of flavor.  And super impressed with how moist the chicken was!

It was good, but way too salty.  Tried it again and just used HALF a tablespoon of salt, and used Ms. Vicki's Unsalted potato chips instead and it was a MILLION TIMES better!  Try using Seasoned Salt instead of regular, and if you want to add a little heat, just a pinch of chili flakes will do the trick!
