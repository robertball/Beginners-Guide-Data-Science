Loved this soup. I didn’t have red peppers, fresh pumpkin, ginger, or corn. I substituted 5 regular potatoes and 1 large sweet potato, a couple cans of pumpkin purée, ground ginger, and increased the broth to cover the potatoes. It turned out super yummy. I did have to add quite a bit more curry paste to be able to feel a little heat.
