This recipe was alright but I don't think there is much of a chance of me making it again.  I found it to be very sugary and simply didn't suit my taste.  This is my opinion so don't take my word for it.

This looks a lot like what we duch eat on newyearseve! They're called "rozijnen bollen" or. "oliebollen". In english that is raisins bolls or oil bolls. We only use powderd suger over it. Nothing more! For people who don't like raisins there are also without the raisins. All over our country they're eaten on new years eve. Everywhere, in every house are they. That's a very old tradition. I can remember that my grandmother told me she eat them as a child already. And she died 33 years ago on the age of 82! And i think it goes further back. Nice to see it here! Make it also your tradition with new years eve! That would be great, all over the world eating the same on this one day a year! Enjoy your balls! Bye. :-)

definitely a one day treat, but they can be warmed in a low oven the second day.  I will try this glaze.
