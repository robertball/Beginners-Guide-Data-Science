Made this for my halloween party. I added less sherbet than recommended (used 2 quarts)... 2 gallons seemed like too much. I cut the sprite and OJ in half, very glad that I did because I think it would've been too weak. I didn't mess with the grapes, but added gummy worms instead. My only complaint is that the flavor was a little boring (basically tasted like a screwdriver). Next time I plan to use other juices as well (maybe pineapple, mango, or peach).

I made this for my Halloween party and it was a big hit!! I followed the advice of bebutter because I also thought the amount of OJ, sherbert and Sprite was a little too much.   Since I had a crowd of people who like to drink at my party I added another liter of Vodka to the punch.  I also added a bottle of Pineapple (750ML) and a few dashes of Grenadine for extra taste.  It was PERFECT! Everyone raved about the delicious brew.  The only unfortunate thing is the gummy worms sank right to the bottom.  I used a clear punch bowl so it did look pretty cool at the bottom.  By the end of the party people were trying to fish them out of the bowl haha. I highly recommend this recipe and cutting some of the servings in half.  If you like a stronger punch add more vodka it's one of those punches where the juices mask the vodka so it WILL NOT taste bad!
