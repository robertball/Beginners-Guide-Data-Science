With a few changes, this was a 5 star pot pie!  I consider us to be "Pot Pie Connesours" as it is my husband's favorite food.  He jokes that we have never had the same recipe twice!  He will have this one again! My modifications were: One can of soup, one can of broth (made a roux with some of the butter and couple tsp flour and the broth) and cooked the veggies in that.  I then added the chicken and cream of soup.  After pressing the biscuits down on the bottom layer, I baked those for about 10 min at 450 degrees (but could have used 5 more min) so they wouldn't be soggy.  Then the filling, then the rest of the biscuits.  I forgot the butter until it came out of the oven, but I brushed it on then and looked, smelled, and tasted wonderful (check out my picture of the pot pie).  Great, fast pot pie!

Even with all these adjustments this recipe was still very fast and easy. Even though I used reduced fat soups and milk this still came out rich and creamy, but healthy!! Everyone in my family loved it, which is saying alot, they all have very diffent tastes. I will definitly be making this again. Here are the adjustments I made: I used 2 soft ready pie crusts instead of biscuits. I cooked the bottom crust in the heating oven while I prepared the filling. I used 98% fat free cream of chicken soup and 98% fat free cream of celery. I also used 1% milk. I used three bnlss/sknlss chiken breast halves broiled for 5min per side (I just couldn't bring myself to use canned meat, it has no taste, and the texture leaves much to be desired). like I said this is still very fast, add maybe an extra 10 min to broil the chicken. Still very rich with the lowfat ingredients.

Like most, I found this to be the perfect starter recipe. After reading the previous reviews, I made the following tweaks: For the chicken, I used two chicken breasts boiled with salt, pepper, and garlic powder (brought to boil, then turned off heat and allowed to cool in pan before cubing). I used one can Healthy Request Cream of Chicken and one of Cream of Potato. I used half the biscuits to line the bottom of my casserole dish and baked for 15 minutes before adding the filling. As a personal preference, I added two diced hard-boiled eggs to the filling just before pouring into the casserole dish, which makes the sauce rich, creamy and flavorful. When done, this cheater recipe beat the pants off my neighbor's "from scratch" recipe!

My husband's aunts had come down to visit our new home for the 1st time and I was looking for a simple recipe to use up the last refrigerator biscuit roll I had. I also happened to have leftover chicken from a supermarket rotisserie chicken I had picked up two nights before.  Well let me tell you - this hit the spot!  Everyone LOVED it!  I used 1 cream of chicken soup and 1 cream of celery.  I also separated the biscuits (Grands)and made a layer on the bottom and a thin layer on the top.  YUM!  The only thing I would change next time (and thus the 4 stars only) would be to use low sodium soups.  The flavor was fabulous, but salty.  Oh....and I also added savory, marjoram, and some onion powder for flavor.  Also just lightly used butter-flavored PAM instead of melted butter to spray the pan and top of the biscuits.  Definitely a welcome addition to my dinner menu!

Just fantastic, and so simple to make.  I did use a deep dish pie crust for the bottom, but used Grand biscuits for the top (separated in half so they weren't too thick on top - they were just right).  Used a rotissieri chicken, and put in chunky cooked fresh carrots, celery, onion, and peas (the peas were previously frozen). Used 2 cans healthy choice cream of chicken soup and skim milk.  Garlic and poultry seasoning, salt and pepper. My whole gang loved it.

I used real chicken, not canned.  Really yummy.  I also made individual pies in small pyrex dishes each with biscuit tops and bottoms -- the kids loved them, so did my hubby.

Very good flavor.  I left the middle open, no biscuit and found the other biscuits baked more evenly, with no doughy damp spots.  Added 2-3 stalks celery thinly sliced and used chicken fingers sauteed with a little oil and poultry seasoning instead of canned chicken.  Have also tried with a can of diced potatoes, frozen peas, pearl onions, and mushrooms to good effect.  Good family dish on a cold night!

This was very good.  I changed the recipe a bit by using fresh chicken breast and used one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of potato soup.  I would no recommend using the "gand" type of biscuit.  They cooked on the top but did not cook all the way through, even after baking a long time.

This was very yummy!  I also used chicken breasts that I cooked up myself.  I didn't have any refrigerator biscuits, so I used refrigerator crescent rolls.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder.  This really added to the flavor, and made this one to keep.  Thanks!

This recipe is great.  Very simple and fast.  I doctored it up a bit.  I had leftover turkey gravy and added it to the soup.  Also, my muffins browned on top but not on bottom so I turned them over half way through the baking.  Thanks for the recipe.

Some sixty years ago my Mother made a similar dish, "Hasty-Tasty".  It was always made the day after a roast beef dinner.  A can or two of vegetable soup was mixed with gravy from the roast & some of the leftover roast cubed & mixed in.  She then topped with her own home made biscuits & baked in the oven.  Was very "tasty" indeed.  Just a variation on the posted recipe.

This is a great dish that is very easy to make. I only cook for my husband, my one-year-old, and myself, so I basically halved the recipe, and made the following changes: I used three small to medium fresh chicken breasts (cut into bite-size pieces and seasoned with grill seasoning) instead of canned chicken. I cooked them fully prior to adding the veggies to the skillet. I used half a package of frozen mixed veggies and one can of soup. I left the milk at 1/2 cup.  Instead of using canned refrigerated biscuits, I prepared biscuit dough with 1 1/4 cups of baking mix and 1/3 cup milk. I rolled this out to cover the mixture in an 8x8 baking dish. I brushed about 1 tablespoon of melted margarine on top of this and poked a couple of holes in it (as you would a pie crust.) It was very tasty and was just the right amount for two grown-ups, one toddler, and my husband's lunch box the next day.

Good when you're short on time and don't want McDs or that stuff.  Got home at 610 and was eating by 7.  Halved the recipe so had too many rolls left over but we thought it was a keeper.  Will do again, maybe add some cheese or bacon or both.

Easy to make and my husband loved it.  I used fresh cooked chicken breasts and substituted cream of potato soup for one of the crm of ckicken soups and it was great.  Will definitely make again.

great quick "homemade" pot pie!  I use low sodium condensed cream of chicken soup, otherwise it is too salty for my taste.

This seems like it would be a great way to use up leftover Thanksgiving turkey! I'd probably leave out the condensed soups and make a roux with chicken/turkey broth and flours, due to a gluten allergy, but otherwise, I could see this being yummy. Careful about the salt content...

This is pretty good.  I shredded a cooked chicken breast instead of using the canned chicken.  Good, but it didn't satisfy my pot pie craving.

This recipe was an instant favorite with my entire family.  So quick and simple.
Unfortunatly, the biscuits tend not to cook all the way through so I started using
Hungry Jack, flacky biscuts because they're easy to pull apart to create a thin 
top layer.  I ecspecially liked the Hungry Jack honey butter biscuits with this 
recipe!

After reading several reviews I made several changes to the original recipe. I boiled 2.5ish chicken breasts w/salt, pepper, and onion powder. Greased a 9 inch pie crust, pressed some biscuits into the bottom, and cooked for 15 minutes once the oven preheated. I think 10 minutes would be better next time. I then combined 2 T butter, 1.25 cups chicken broth, and some onion on the stovetop. Mixed in 4 teaspoons of flour. Added 1 cup each of carrots, frozen corn, and frozen peas and 1 can of cream of chicken soup. Mixed it all together and let it cook...stirring frequently. I also added in some celery seed. After awhile I poured the mixture over the cooked biscuits. I took the rest of the biscuits (I used 2 7.5 ounce cans total) and flattened each one, placing each over the mixture. I had 2 biscuits left over, so I just ripped them into smaller pieces and placed them over the holes. Put in oven for 15 minutes (Pie dish started over flowing so I had to put it on my jellyroll pan, which doesn't fit in the oven...so last 8 minutes ish of cooking time the oven was ajar)...The verdict: Hubby and I both liked it. I think I will omit the biscuits on the bottom next time, though. And maybe I shouldn't flatten the biscuits...at least not so much. But, overall--YUM!

Delicious! I used boiled & cubed chicken breasts with potatoes, celery, corn because it was what I had on hand and everyone loved it, even my super picky 5 year old son. This one's a keeper.

This is a great pot pie recipe. My family loved it so much I'll need to double the recipe next time! I followed the advice of others and added some poultry seasoning, garlic powder, and additionally sprinkled some cheddar cheese on the mixture before placing the biscuits on top.

My biscuits didn't cook all the way through- even though they were browned on top.  So, this ended up being a bit disappointing.  I also think it needs another can of chicken.

The basic recipe was very good. I made it this week and my wife and I enjoyed it. Will definately use this recipe again, with some changes. I used canned turkey instead of chicken. Our only complaint was that there was not enough turkey. Next time I would diffenately use two cans of turkey or cook some chicken and chop up. Will probably try some different flavors of soups ie. cream of mushroom, celery, potato and so on.

My husband and I are addicted to this.  I make it almost once a week!  I use pillsbury crescent rolls spread flat on the bottom bake until light brown then add the mix ( I just use one can of crm of chicken soup and no milk needed, it was plenty creamy!) then top with the crescent rolls spread out flat again until its browned.  yum, yum yum!

I had a couple of cans of refrigerated biscuits that I needed to use and came here to search for ideas.   This is absolutely delicious!!  I did what a few other readers suggested and put biscuits on the bottom.  I also made it in a casserole dish instead of a pie plate.   My family loved it, too!  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

I made this last night, YUM! I used ground beef instead of chicken and cream of potato and mushroom soup. Added a bottom "crust" and the result was YYYYUUUUUMMMMMYYY! Kids loved it! And even helped make it! Very easy and quick (cheap too).This is a keeper!

Four stars as-is, Five stars with changes.  It was really tasty!  *I added oregano, thyme & rosemary.  *I used 4 fresh chicken breasts.  I wanted to feed 8 people, so I used a 9"x13" pan with extra veggies and it needed extra liquid.  *I made a roux and added ~1 c. broth.  Be sure to use low-sodium soups.  *The biscuits needed to be cooked separately for 6 minutes.  I then inverted them (cooked-side down) and finished on the dish as the recipe says.  It turned out great!  It might sound like a lot of changes, but they were all very easy and quick.  I'll certainly make again.  Thanks Melanie!

I've made this recipe as-is and it turned out very well. But tonight I tried something a little different. I try to make at least one meal with fish or seafood each week. So, I substituted fish for the chicken and condensed clam chowder for the cream of chicken. The fish was Mahi Mahi, and I cut it into piece and sauteed it quickly in the saucepan before adding the vegetables. Also, I found 1.5 tablespoons of melted butter to be quite sufficient. It turned out really well! So Cheater Pot Pie can easily become Fish Pot Pie.

This isn't THE BEST EVER pot pie but it's very good for how quick it is! I give it 5 stars for ease and taste combined, on taste alone I would give it about 3 1/2 or 4 stars. Seasoning is a must!

With my modifications I was able to make this recipe a 5 instead of a 3. I used oscar-meyer pre-cooked chicken chunks in a bag, not a can. Also, I used 1 can cream of potato soup and 1 can of cream of chicken. I added a lot of extra seasonings- onion salt, more pepper, and garlic powder. I bought green giant frozen mixed vegetables that you steam in the bag. I did that. I put some olive oil (no butter) in a saucepan and warmed the chicken up while the vegetables cooked in the microwave. When they finished cooking I put them in the pan, and started with the biscuits. I pushed 4 grands biscuits into the bottom of a 9 inch square pan. I should've greased it, b/c they stuck a bit when I got them out. I cooked the other 4 biscuits separately as directed. So I only preheated the oven to 350.  Then I added the soups to the vegetables and chicken. I used the 1/2 cup of milk, but I added it probably a 2tbsps at a time. I would stir it in, let it sit for about 30 seconds, and then add some more. I did this until there wasn't any milk left. It was not runny at all, and it really helped the flavor. I poured it overtop of the cooked biscuits in the pan. Then I halved the other 4 biscuits and put them on top of the mix. I didn't cook it any longer. It was really quite tasty. My husband is crazy about biscuits being doughy, so that's why I cooked it that way. He ate quite a bit, so it was a success!

It was quick and easy. I did alter it a bit. I used one can of chicken (12.5 oz), which was a little more than called for. I also made a bottom crust with flattened and stretched biscuits. I did the same for the top and cut butter slices over it. I think most of my ingredients were store brand (generic) and it still turned out great. I also added garlic powder. Next time I will use less or no salt and honey biscuits and rotisserie chicken, which were all mentioned above. Oh, I used canned vegetables instead of frozen. This is a hearty warm meal.

This is similar to the way I've been making it for years. I add crushed rosemary, dried sage and basil. I also use a mashed potato crust on the bottom. I simply mash cooked potatoes without milk or butter, press them evenly into a glass 9"  pie pan and bake 20 minutes at 400. There are many variations that can be used, I usually change it up a bit. It's a great winter dish that we have once per month when it gets cold out.

My little sis made this for me once and I loved it but I did the same thing she did.....I picked up a roasted chicken at the deli, that has more flavor than canned chicken and since you only need half the chicken then I have more for chicken salad sandwiches or any other recipe. This is a quick easy tasty meal.

Yummy! Only had one can of cream of chicken, so we replaced one with a can of cream of mushroom.  Liked it so much, we'll keep it that way.  Used pre-cooked chicken strips and threw in just a bit of garlic powder and some extra canned corn, to suit our taste.  We will definitely be eating this one again!

Good and easy! I did make some adjustments, instead of canned chicken I used cooked chicken breast. Instead of 2 cans of chicken soup I replaced 1 can with cream of celery. I did have to add more salt than I would have liked b/c it tasted a little bland. I didn't have a deep dish pan so I just baked the flaky biscuits. To serve, I just split the biscuit in half and poured the mix in the middle! Delicious!!

I changed it up a little based on what I had. I used 1 cup of broth to cook the veggies and chicken in. Then added 1 can cream of chicken and 1/3 cup milk. I added a little flour just to thicken. I separated the layers for the top of the pie and baked the rest of the biscuits to eat with it.

I loved this recipe so much that I wrote it down on a recipe card and stuck it in my recipe binder - only the best recipes make it into my binder. :) I didn't have the canned biscuits on hand, so I made half of a biscuit recipe from another cook book.  I also didn't measure the frozen veggies exactly - I had several bags of various frozen veggies in my freezer and a can of corn that I mixed together.  A second can of chicken made it meatier and more savory.  You won't be disappointed with this go-to dish!

Very very good. My husband says he doesn't like pot pie and yet he had two servings of this. I used fresh chicken, and crescent rolls (biscuits have trans fats). This was so easy and so good. Loved it.

Definitely a quick and easy recipe for a busy weeknight.  I did use a larger can of chicken chunks, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I would suggest putting the dish on a cookie sheet, as mine bubbled over a bit.  Overall a good recipe.

Very easy. I followed advice from other reviews and used one can of 98% Fat Free Cream of Chicken and one can of 98% Fat Free Cream of Mushroom Soup.  I stuck with the canned chicken as that was all I had on hand.  I eliminated the butter and sprayed the bottom of the pan and tops of the biscuits with Olivio. Frozen vegs in the steam bags are the way to go. I didn't even have to put this on the stove to heat thru before it hit the oven!  Definitely use your own combo of seasonings.  I used pepper, poultry seasoning, lots of garlic podwer and dried, minced onion.  Super quick meal! There was enough filling that I was able to make two casseroles!  (I used a smaller dish too....)

I hate pot pie, and this is one of my favorite meals! It is SO delicious! My husband and I like to use canned corn and green beans and fresh broccoli in place of frozen veggies, but we've made it both ways and its delicious both ways! We've also tried it with all that plus cauliflower. And we found that a family size can of cream of chicken soup works better than 2 regular cans. Its fun to mix it up with different veggies and its very, VERY easy to make and even more delicious!!!!

This is a very good recipe! Quick and easy, but tastes great!! I did make a few modifications after the first time I made it though: I used canned mixed veggies instead of frozen (my fiance doesn't like the "toughness" of frozen veggies), I use one can of cream of chicken soup and one can of cream of celery soup, I use evaporated milk instead of regular milk (we drink skim milk, and sometimes soy milk, so evaporated milk tends to create a much richer/thicker sauce), I added about 1/2 teaspoon of Mrs. Dash and 1/2 teaspoon of Morton's Nature Seasoning, and I use the cheap (non-layered) biscuits from Aldi/Kroger/Wal-Mart and just stick individual biscuits on top. Tastes great everytime!

I thought this was a great, last-minute recipe! My husband, mother in law, and 4 children loved it. The only change I made was to put it in an 8X11 rectangular pan, and I rolled out a tube of crescent roll dough over it. It was wonderful! I will try it again with biscuits, but this was what I had on hand.

This was very easy and versitile meal. You can definitly add and take away as you like. I got two cans of biscuts and layered bottom of pie pan with those, cooked for 15 min, and then some for the top... I cooked the veggies until warm in cream of mushroom soup and a can of broth. let that boil and added some corn starch to thicken towards the end... Then cooked the chicken and sauteed that in evoo with some onions and mushrooms.... In the oven now! Cant wait! :)

easy recipe, and good comfort food. Can be changed up in so many ways to accomodate a  variety of likes. I even snuck in fresh spinach, & diced red bells sauteed in garlic. Gotta get those dark veggies in somewhere!! Thanks, Helen!

I am with Littlest_mermaid on this one, but I am giving it a 5 for taste. It was excellent, but my biscuits didn't cook all the way through. I even made them really thin. Otherwise, my entire family loved this (even the pickiest eaters inhaled it). Thanks for sharing!

Like others, I thought this was a great base recipe. Instead of two cans of cream of chicken soup, I used just one and then a can of campbells cheese soup. I also added garlic powder, onion powder and a little red pepper. Turned out wonderful. My family ate all of it and most of them don't even like pot pie!

Really good and hearty.  Instead of the canned chicken, I use a rotisserie which I think gives it more flavor.  I've also used turkey legs from the deli.  Also, instead of putting the biscuits on top, I make them separate and spoon the chicken mixture over the biscuits.

This was quick and tastey!  Just a few changes for me.  I used cream of mushroom soup, and tossed in a few dried cepi mushrooms.  I used freshly boiled chicken breasts, cut up, instead of canned.  I halved the recipe, since I was just making this for myself.  Next time I think I would make the biscuits separately and then pop them on top when they're done baking.  I will definitely make this again - next time just using the chicken soup.

This recipe is good, but I would definitely use more chicken next time and I think the people who said they added biscuits on the bottom definitely had a good idea there.  Thanks!

My family enjoyed this pot pie, but I found it had to much butter and the chicken didn't hold its form.  I think the brand of biscuit I used,which was a pilsbury brand, had the extra butter in it.  I would try this recipe again with a different type of biscuit and fresh chicken chunks.

My family was very pleased with results.- we opted for leftover turkey from xmas, used 1 can cream potato/1 can cream of chicken - we preferred more savory flavor and used 1 pkt dry gravy mix, 1 cn diced potatoes and used leftover piecrusts instead of biscuits -it doesn't all fit in the pan - I put the rest in freezer for another meal- there were no leftovers to toss out.
This is my tru sign of a good recipe in my house.

Even if it tasted terrible I still would have rated this one at least 4 stars for convenience sake. It was very quick to make and fortunately it tasted good too :) My whole family ate it up. I used canned veggies instead of the frozen mixed veggies because my family doesn't like everything that's in the mixed. I used one can of corn, 1 can of green beans, and 1 can of peas. I might not use the peas next time because they ended up kind of mushy.

Found this recipe when I was searching for a quick & easy pot pie recipe that used ingredients on hand. It is terrific! We are vegetarians so we left out the chicken and instead of cream of chicken soup we used cream of potato. It was delicious! Definitely a keeper and a favorite. The family loved it!

This might be the perfect pot pie recipe if you're not interested in wasting an entire day for a simple dish. I made mini pot pies and they turned out beautifully with the exact same baking instructions. 

The only "changes" I made to the recipe were adding a good 4-5 tbs of poultry seasoning, 2tbs red pepper flakes and 2tsp nutmeg. The outcome was a perfectly seasoned dish (not overtly spicy, but not bland like most recipes). Another change was using homemade pie crust instead of biscuits, and it turned out quite tasty but I'm sure biscuits would have worked out well too (but I prefer the harder texture). And finally, I ended up adding at least a cup more water to thin out the filling and let it bubble for about 15 min (helped soften up the ingredients)

This is honestly the best pot pie I or anyone in my family has ever had, and I've already had requests to make it again even though it's not even finished!

Perfect for a quick but delicious dinner!!  I used all the ingredients (had peas instead of mixed vegetables), and I didn't have refrigerated biscuits for I made Jiffy Mix biscuits (2 cups mix, a little under 2/3 cup milk). I put the Jiffy Mix biscuits in little drops all over the pot pie mixture.  It browned beautifully, and tasted amazing.  My family ate the whole dish and kept asking for seconds, especially the biscuit topping. I'm going to keep for nights we need a quick, easy dinner.

I love the entire recipe. It was super easy and good. Instead of can chicken I went the semi easy route and bought some chicken breast pre-cooked and cut up in my local Kroger deli. I then used 2 cans of condensed soups (cream of celery and cream of chicken). I followed the directions on mixing all ingredients as stated. The only other thing I changed was I cut my biscuits in half and layered the bottom of my casserole dish (cooked em until slightly browned) and the remaining went on top. Couldn't have been better. Will be a regular staple for the cold months to come.

I did some adjustments too (we just can't leave a recipe alone, can we?) :-)

Sprayed 9x13 pan then put one can of Grand's and pre-cooked them at 450° 10 mins (nothing worse than mushy biscuits) 

3 TBS flour
3TBS butter.  > made a roux
1 cup milk

When thickened I added 2 cups cooked chicken, 1 can crm of potato soup, 1 can crm of chicken, 2 cups cooked green beans,  1 can corn (drained)  add S &P, garlic powder &  mixed well, then spread onto pre cooked biscuits, I like my pot pie cheesy, so I added some (6 slices)  American cheese on top of the mixture then added one more can of Grand's and cooked at 400° for 15 more mins. Delish!! :) 

(I'm allergic to peas)

This recipe turned out to be surprisingly tasty! My husband, who can be secretly picky, really enjoyed it! My one modification for the next time would be to cut down on the vegetables and add an extra can of chicken. I seasoned the "filling" with salt, pepper and about a teaspoon of sugar to cut a bit of the saltiness. And I find the best chicken pot pie I've eaten had a mildly sweet component.

I chose this recipe because I had 2 large chicken breast that needed to be used.  I had a bag of frozen mixed vegetables but no pie crust, so I remember reading somewhere that someone mentioned Bisquick as a topper but I did not have any.  I did have a can of regular butter biscuits (not the layered kind) so I gave it a try.  I also decided to add an onion when I cooked the chicken.  I then added the mixed vegetables, 2 cans of soup (one cream of chicken and one cream of celery) and milk.  I also thought it was slightly bland so I added pepper, garlic powder and a teaspoon of worstershire sauce. The flavor was great!  I rolled out the canned butter biscuits extremely thin and placed them on top.  I did not put any biscuits on the bottom. I really liked the flavor of the filling, but I did not care for the biscuits on the top. The pot pie was not dry at all. I will make this recipe again, but I will not use canned biscuits.

I tried what others did and used a half biscuit layer on bottom and top but that was too much biscuit. I also had to use two pie pans. Next time I will use a large baking pan and only put a biscuit layer on top. I'll also add some garlic because even though I used chicken soup with herbs, it was a little bland. Good starter recipe though.

I'm not a fan of canned chicken, so I used two chicken breasts and seasoned them.  I also skipped the butter as the biscuits have enough richness & calories on their own!  Other than that, I didn't make any changes.  I really enjoyed this recipe.

I made a few changes to this but it was fantastic!  I used to be scared of making pot pie I thought it was too hard but this was sooo easy!  My kids LOVED it!  This is a keeper!!  I doubled this recipe and when I split the bisquits I put them on the bottom of the dish as well as on top.  I baked it a little longer and put foil on top for the last 10 min so that the top bisquits would not overcook.  I also added garlic pepper and a little extra milk.  GREAT RECIPE and I would reccomend this to anyone!

Good easy recipe for a quick weeknight meal.  I added some Le Seur carrots and peas that happened to be in the pantry and frozen corn.  I find tarragon to be a great herb with any creamy chicken recipe so I added come dried to give it a home-cooked taste.  Definitely not the greatest pot pie but I love it for ease and quickness.

very easy! and very delicious.  Great quick dinner to make for my pretty large family.  I made it even quicker by getting 3 baked chicken breasts from the deli at my super market.  I also made it the way one reviewer suggested with 1 can cream of chx and 1 can cream of potato. and putting half the bisquits at bottom.  It was amazing! all members of the family loved it, which is very rare

This recipe was great for a quick meal. I did used real chicken instead of canned and added more seasoning including garlic, onion powder, parsley, and a little hot sauce. My 3 year old even asked for seconds! I did follow the advice of others and baked the bottom crust in the oven prior to placing the filling.

I have made this a few times now, and the best way that i have found is to buy a roasted chicken and use that. Then i also substituted the condensed soups for one can of cream of mushroom ready to serve kind. I also use the large crescent roll dough instead of the biscuits, i found that the biscuits just were too much bread. I layer the bottom with half (two pieces of dough for the crescent rolls) bake for about 10 mins, add the mixture from the pot, then top with the other two pieces of crescent roll dough and bake for another 15 mins. I didnt add the butter, but i thought with the premade dough you didnt need it! Hope this helps anyone else!

I made this for some friends and I was thinking 'comfort' type food. It was easy and a hit with adults and 4 young kids. There was nothing left. My only substitute was chicken and rice condensed soup instead of chicken because it was what I had in lower sodium. I also used a rotissere chicken like suggested in another review. My husband added a little shreaded cheese to the top.

Made this for a second time since adding it to my recipe box. First time around, I made my own bisquick biscuits and baked them for a few minutes before adding to the top. This time, I used flaky canned biscuits, and added garlic salt, pepper, and onion powder with parsley. Fantastic! Had no problem with undercooked biscuits, either.

Simple to make but you get the same result as if you spent hours.  I just used a package of frozen veggies and it turned out great.

Ok I made a bunch of changes only because I was in a bind and did an ingredient search and this was the closest to what I had on hand.    I did not use a pie crust.  I had boneless chicken thighs that I boiled while simmering the milk soup and veggies.  I tore up the chicken and put it in a 9 x 13 pyrex.  I poured the soup mixture on top and took the biscuits and rolled them into little dumplings and pushed them in the mixture.  I cooked it for 15 miutes.  I got rave reviews.  Thanks for saving dinner.

I used pie crusts(one for the top and bottom) instead of biscuits for this.  Used one can of cream of celery and one of cream of chicken.  I also added small chunks of potatoes in the veggie mix. I did not use canned chicken, I used chicken breasts.  Very tasty!

Absolutely delicious.  I've made this several times making no substitutions and it came out great.  Last week I accidentally picked up the butter flavored biscuits instead of the regular.  It was incredible, so now I plan to pick up the butter flavored biscuits every time.

Followed the basic recipe with a few personal adjustments to suit my family's taste and it turned out well.  I will use this recipe when in a hurry, but still like my classic crust made from scratch.  Thanks for the nice change!

I am not a big pot pie fan to begin with, but my husband is, so I thought I would surprise him with this recipe.  Unfortunately, he was not into the biscuits in place of the regular pie crust.  I also tried to follow some other reviewers suggestions like not using the canned chicken, and I think that was a very good idea overall.   I also used flatter-type biscuits as recommended and baked the bottom layer separately, but still found that they were too soggy for our liking underneath the top layer.  I can see how some people may like this, hence the 3 star rating, but I think it would take a lot of tweaking and I really wanted something quick.  I also read other later reviews that I think could have helped make this better (like baking the top layer of biscuits separately on a cookie sheet), but again I was going for something really quick and I ended up with multiple trips in and out of the oven and a meal we really werent impressed with.  You know the old saying.... cheaters never win.

Very Good. Hubs was going to the store and i thought this would be quick. It was. I did modify. I am a vegetarian so I used vegetarian chick'n patties. I used one can of mushroom sick. I was going to add a potato soup but it looked like too much. So I added an extra 3/4 cup of water. I also used the grands biscuits. Next time I will either use regular or roll the grands into a crust I also added tumeric and poultry seasoning and a little marsala wine. It really did taste lie I had used a chicken soup.  Excellent base recipe. Definitely going into the rotation. Am also thinking of using the celery soup when I makes a vegetable pot pie.

For our family this was just ok, I think the bread texture for us was a bit too much. I used a roasted chicken from the store and added a bit of canned milk with 2 percent milk which added thickness and made the filling richer. I had no problem with it being runny.The filling itself was good with a little tweaking of spices we enjoy. I will try adding this a flaky pie crust.

This was delicious...I cooked my own chicken breast and seasoned it with poultry seasoning, garlic powder, salt and pepper.  I also chopped a little onion and sauteed it with the veggies.  Will definitely be putting on my regular rotation.  Thanks!

This is easy, a great way to use leftovers, and a good way to finish the ends of the bags of veggies in the freezer.  It is easily tailored to your family's likes. I made it with leftover turkey from Thanksgiving; used one can of soup, and leftover gravy instead of second can of soup and milk; used frozen onions, carrots and peas, and a bit of borccoli because that's what needed to be used up from the freezer.  I also put a pie crust on the bottom because I had one leftover from making the Thanksgiving pies.  It was a bit salty, so I suggest low sodium soup.

this was really good, altho i changed it a bit:  i had skinless/boneless chicken thighs to use up, so cut them into chunks, used cream of celery (low fat) and cream of chicken soups, added a bit of garlic powder, poultry seasoning, and chicken soup base, then topped it with crescent rolls (from a tube) laid flat (i had them to use up)---it was fantastic!  my husband went up for thirds:  a sure sign of a hit!

This is no gourmet meal, but it IS a tasty one. I used to make it this way quite often, only using canned veg-all instead of frozen. Sometimes I made a Bisquick or Jiffy cornmix topping instead of canned biscuits. It honestly depended on how much time I had :) I don't eat the canned soup anymore, but I don't look down on it because I remember how convenient it was & how pleasant it was to get comfort food fast!

Tasted very good.  Some of the biscuits did not cook all the way through.  I'm not sure how to alleviate this problem.  I will try it again though, because it was excellent otherwise.

This was very easy and good-I used one can of Cream of Chicken soup and it was plenty. The preparation was easy. I already had chicken and vegetables left over from last nights dinner, so all I did was put everything together and heated it up and put in pie pan with buttermilk bisquits. I would make this again.

This was really good, but I made changes. I used a roasted chicken from the supermarket and shredded the meat. Then I put it in a bowl and dumped a can of potato soup and cream of chicken on it, a half cup of milk, about 2 teaspoons of garlic powder, a teaspoon of onion powder, s & p.  Mixed it all up. Meanwhile, I bought a bag of mixed veggies in those steam bags (frozen) and that was cooking in the microwave while i mixed everything. I mixed all once the veggies were done and dumped it into the casserole dish. Then, instead of using biscuits- I took a cup of bisquick, 3/4 cup of milk and a 1/4 cup of melted butter and mixed. I poured that over the top and baked on 415 for about 25 minutes until golden brown. It was fantastic.

The first time I did not use biscuits, but used a name brand pie crust on the bottom and criss crossed one on top. This I gave a five. The second time I used biscuits as directed, and gave it four stars. I think if I used the bigger biscuits I probably would of gave it a five. Also, both times I just used leftover Chicken rather than cans.

This is simple and hearty, warmed us up on this cold night. However, it is quite bland and unimpressive, so I'm going to have to go with only 3 stars. I cooked 2 chicken breasts, seasoned just with garlic salt, instead of using canned. I used 1 can fat free cream of chicken soup and 1 can fat free cream of celery soup. To avoid soggy biscuits, I did things differently. I put a layer of biscuits in the bottom of my casserole dish and put the remaining biscuits on a baking sheet and baked them until the bottoms were browned... about 10 minutes. Then I added the veggie/chicken/soup mixture to the dish and topped with the partially cooked biscuits. Covered it with foil so the biscuits wouldn't burn and cooked for 15 minutes. I don't think I would bother making this again, but thanks!

I used leftover Thanksgiving turkey for this and fresh carrots and celery. I added some garlic too and I didn't have 2 cans of the cream of chicken soup only one so I added a can of cream of celery. It was a huge hit.

I love this because it is so simple. I use canned mixed veg because it has potatoes. I'm sure fresh would taste even better, but keeping this simple canned works great. I also throw whole chicken in a crockpot in the morning seasoned with onion powder, garlic powder, italian seasoning and salt and pepper. I let it cook all day. Then the chicken shreds and I freeze the broth for other recipes. Per other reviewers, I layered four biscuits and baked them alone. I added the chicken mix and topped with the rest of the layers. Baked until brown and it is perfect. It's not gourmet, but it is a super-quick super-comforting dinner that can be thrown together on the busiest nights!

Easy, easy, easy.  The shortcuts shave time off of this recipe, but little flavor.  It's great.  I give this recipe five stars for what it is--not gourmet fare, but down home comfort food which is easy to prepare.  I did use fresh chicken, not canned.  Though the flavor was wonderful, I did have a  couple of "issues."  First, the vegetable and chicken mixture was too soupy and thin.  I attempted to thicken it with a little corn starch, but I apparently didn't add enough.  The recipe indicates that the mixture should not be runny, but doesn't provide a way to prevent or fix it.  Try flour or corn starch; keep adding until thick.  I was so hungry, I didn't have the patience to wait, so after a half-hearted try, I popped it in the oven.  Too, the biscuits turned out golden brown and great--on top, but a couple were a little soggy on the bottom.  I was afraid to leave the pot pie in the oven any longer because I didn't want the biscuits to burn on top.  Any suggestions?  Maybe if the mixture is thicker, the biscuits won't fall so deeply into the mixture and as such, won't turn out soggy.  Anyway, soggy or not, this one is a keeper.

This was quite tasty and easy.  I used 2 cans of turkey, more meat was a good idea. I didn't have refrigerator biscuits, so I made them from scratch. Yummy!

This was very good and super easy.  I substituted cream of chicken and herbs for regular cream of chicken and I realized (while it was baking) that I forgot to add the milk.  It didn't matter though, it was still very creamy and good.  I sprinkled a little cheese on top and some italian seasoning (for color).  I'm saving in my recipe box because I will make this again.

I have to say this was easy to make. I used to 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of the canned chicken. I did add salt and pepper. I added 3/4 cup of milk to make it alittle more creamy. But I have to say this was good and this is a make again. Thanks for the recipe !!!

I followed the recipe exactly, and I don't know if I did something wrong, but the biscuits were kind of "slimy" on the bottom and the filling was a bit too salty.

I made this for the 1st time last night and added diced potatoes.  It was great!! As far as the bisquit top, I divided them a little thicker then a layer and it was perfect.  I was happy I had doubled the recipe.  I used left-over grilled chicken...perfect.

This is a great recipe!  So easy, and the whole family loved it.  I added minced onions to it, and baked it in a cassarole dish instead.  Also, I topped it with French's Fried Onions when it came out of the oven.

I did alter the recipe and use fresh chicken, but I cannot see how it could have made the outcome too different.  Overall, the inner portion was great, but the biscuits did not cook thoroughly underneath.  I guess it needed a lot more than 15 minutes to cook.  It could have been the store-bought biscuits I used, but either way I will never try this one again.

My kids and their friends loved this.  Here are my changes. Vegetable spray instead of butter for the pie pan. For the chicken, one whole chicken breast, boiled and cut it into chunks. I used 1 can cream of potato and 1 can cream of chicken with roasted garlic soup. Petite cut, mixed frozen veggies. I made a very thin layer of buttery, layered biscuits on the top. Since there were plenty of biscuits left, I served them on the side. I will be making this again. Thanks for a tastey recipe.

Filling is great! But it needs a bottom crust so I used the leftovers in a frozen pie crust(prebaked it first) and then added new biscuits on top.  It was much better in my humble opinion.

I liked this recipe, and used fresh chicken instead of canned, also sprinkled cheddar cheese on before topping with homemade biscuits I had made.  I recomend flavoring the biscuits with fresh ground pepper, some tabasco sauce or cheese if you are making them from scratch.

This recipe is perfect for a quick, flavorful, hearty meal! However, I would suggest using TWO cans of chicken instead of one. (It makes a difference!)

My husband just loves this!  He wants it at least every other week.  Sometimes, we just chunk leftover chicken breasts instead of the canned chicken.  Because it is too much for just the two of us, we often just cook the biscuits separately and ladle the mixture over them.  Very quick!

I had cooked a whole chicken and was looking for another dinner to make with the left overs. This was perfect. I only had a can of cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soup but that worked perfectly. I added a can of white corn and some frozen peas. Came out great. I love a good, simple, quick recipe. This fits the bill!

Used  9x13 casserole dish, added precooked egg noodles, a splash more milk, flattened the biscuits to cover top. Oh yeah added twice the meat (leftover rotisserie chicken). Only thing I'd change is brush biscuits with butter midway through the baking time. Everyone loved, even my extremely picky stepson.

Made this pretty much per the recipe and it was very tasty.  I used a 12.5 oz can of chicken as that is what I had in my pantry but also 5 oz did not seem very much.  I topped with puff pastry in place of biscuits and baked about 20 minutes at 420°.  It was very good and will make again.  Thank you for posting this recipe.

I didn't have all the ingredients on the list so I tweaked it a bit with what I had.... I used mushroom soup instead of the cream of chicken and added some powder chicken soup base to it then covered it with a frozen pie crust but I would definitely wait till I bought some frozen biscuits the next time as YES I would make it again.

I made the recipe as shown except I used leftover rotisserie chicken in place of the canned chicken.  The taste was great but the veggies were a little too firm and the biscuits burned on top while still remaining too doughy on the bottom.  I had to peel off the top layer of the biscuits and cook a couple of extra minutes. Next time I will boil the vegetables a few minutes first to soften them a bit and I will lower the oven temp to 350 or 375. Hopefully that will cook the biscuits through without burning the tops.

This recipe was a huge hit... even with the finicky eaters in our house! I only made one change to the original recipe... I used one 12.5 oz can of chicken instead of one 5 oz can. I will definitely make this recipe again, maybe with some suggestions from other reviews.

Overall very yummy. Minor changes as listed: boiled and shredded a few chicken breasts. After reading other reviews I went ahead and baked half the biscuits on the bottom. I like my veggies tender so I combined veggies, soups, and milk and let simmer while the oven warmed and bottom biscuits baked, then folded in the chicken. Bottom biscuits were very chewy and some might say soggy, but we thought they tasted pretty good. I used Grand flaky biscuits. Maybe would go for a smaller one, crescent rolls or even pie crust next time. Baked in an 8x8 pan and couldn't even fit all the mix (Im sure because of the giant biscuits.) very savory and buttery flavor. Will make again using my noted changes and report back. First attempt 8/10 for quickness, ease, and simple accessible ingredients.

i love this recipe, and only need to alter it slightly. i add a small can of creamed corn  and frozen pearl onions. i add seasonings to taste, sage, thyme, garlic powder, and parsley. i also use croissant  dough instead of biscuits. i mix everything in the pan it cooks in because i'm lazy, and then i put in a 350 F oven for 45 minutes. then i put the croissant dough rolled out on top. it never fits exactly and there are a couple spots of double layers, but it works out fine thanks to heating the filling first, no risk of doughy bread topping.. about 15 minutes later it is ready to eat.

Very good..I used canned veggies instead of frozen, added onion and garlic, and used butter biscuits and cut in half placed them on top in a 9 x 13 pan. Big hit!! Will be tweeking to make my own variation.

I took the advice of other reviewers and split the dough - half on the bottom (cooked for 10 min before), and the other half on top. This recipe has the perfect ratio of chicken, vegs, and sauce overall, but be aware -- the filling will likely overflow the edges of a standard round pie pan. So either leave some out or put a pan on the bottom rack of the oven so the drips don't hit your burner and scorch / smoke.

I  made this for dinner and really the whole family liked it. I didn't use canned chicken,but instead left overs from a whole chicken that was made the other day.  It's perfect for left over chicken and so quick and easy to make. I have made it before with the canned chicken but didn't care for the flavor of that, just tasted like something is off. Overall great dish and will make again...and again

This is my recipe in a nutshell with the exception, I use filo pastry instead of biscuits. cook the chicken and sauce together in a pot, when its nearly ready pop the pastry in the oven, plate the chicken and then put a slice of flaky pastry on top. Its awesome and just as quick

I have been making pot pies using soup for MANY years.  I mix 1 can healthy request cream of chicken and 1 of cream of mushroom with a little 1% milk and heat in pan, add a little pepper,then pour over the chicken and veggies. Usually use 1 full breast cut into pieces from a store cooked roaster chicken.  I use the already prepared pie crust, always tasty and filling.

Mine came out nice except my biscuits were the GRANDS and they came out gooey on the bottomt... but the inside tasted good.  (Was like a chicken stew).  I added chopped canned potatoes and left over veggies from the fridge.  I will try this recipe again with the smaller, thinner biscuits.I also added 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of chicken gravy (In place of milk and Cream of chicken soup).  I had to use what I had on hand... which makes this recipe very versatile.  The consistancy (without milk and just with soup and gravy) was perfect.



    3 tablespoons butter, melted

    1 (16 ounce) can mixed vegetables

    1 (5 ounce) can chicken chunks, drained

    1 16 ounce can whole cooked potatoes

    1 (10.75 ounce) cans condensed cream of mushroom soup

    1 can of chicken gravy

    salt and pepper to taste

    1 (10 ounce) can refrigerated layered biscuits

Very good recipe.  Having the biscuits on top makes for a nice looking dish, but I think I'll just make them on the side next time, so they won't be soggy for leftovers.  I would also recommend using a larger can of chicken.  I used 12 oz. and it worked wonderfully! Yummy dish!

My mom made this and now I make it for my family.  We use our own homemade biscuits, don't add butter, and buy a precooked rotisserie chicken to tear apart.  Other than that it is pretty much the same.  Some might not think it is 5 stars but when you grow up loving it, there is no other way!

I adjusted the recipe slightly for picky kids and to reduce the fat.  I used 1 can fat-free cream of chicken and 1 regular, I used 1 lb diced fresh cooked chicken breast, 1 can of fat-free skim milk (whisked it with the condensed cream soup base), then added 1 1/2 cups total of frozen peas, carrots, and corn.  I then heated the soup and veggie mixture in a pan sprayed with cooking spray (since I omitted the butter) and heated it up for a few minutes.  Then topped it with southern style biscuits and waited for the biscuits to brown, then placed foil over for 5 minutes, until it was done (to prevent the biscuits from browning too much) .  My kids and the whole family loved it!

Thanks for this recipe! I used to make something similar, but I must have forgotten the recipe over time since it stopped tasting good. So I looked for it again online and found this one. This one is both easier and tastes better. This is going to become a common dinner in my house.

I made this while  on vacation for my brothers family and they decided that I am welcome to come back any time as long as I make this again. It was delicious! The only thing I changed is that I used leftover chicken instead of canned. Thanks for sharing this simple and satisfying recipe

I cheated even further.  Instead of putting the mixture into a pie, I spooned it over rice.  I used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of celery.  I added a little more milk, a small amount at a time, until the mixture thinned out a little bit.  I added biscuits on the side.  Yummy!

I made a few changes after reading the comments: I used what was left of our Christmas turkey, and a can of mixed veggies instead of frozen + a can of corn (we really like veggies).  1 can of cream of chicken soup, plus about a cup each of leftover turkey gravy and some freshly made turkey stock, plus a little milk to make it creamy. Simmered the sauce for a little bit before adding the meat and veg, plus a few seasoning (salt & pepper, garlic Lowery's season salt, a little poultry seasoning).  Followed the suggestion to split the biscuits and make a top and bottom layer.  I had too much filling for the pan, but then not enough in the pie so we scooped some extra on.  I think next time we'll just cook the biscuits separately and pour the filling over.  Very good!

great starter recipe!  skipped the butter, used a ready made rotisserie chicked, shredded, healthy choice cream of mushroom soup, water instead milk -- healthier and still dee-lish!  i added 1 medium-large cubed potato and a dash of garlic powder.  oh, i also used crescent rounds rolled lightly out so the crust isn't so thick instead of biscuits -- lighter texture.

Very creative way to make this yummy comfort food on a whim. I followed some suggestions and put some biscuits on the bottom and baked those first, and only used 1 can of soup. I cooked the veggies/chicken in a roux of butter, flour, chicken broth. I've made this a few times now and we love it!

This was pretty good - I took the first reviewers advice and I liked it.. I ate almost the whole pot pie myself over a couple of days. My husband liked it too.

This turned out wonderfully and friends approved! I used 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of potato soup.  For the biscuit dough, I went with Immaculate Baking Co. refrigerated buttermilk biscuits, squishing most on the bottom of a glass pan to create a lower crust (cooking it for 15 minutes while combining the other ingredients, as suggested).  For the chicken, I cooked 1.5 fresh chicken breasts in butter in a skillet and tore them into pieces.    This recipe tasted great and I would make again!

This is soooo easy and very yummy on a cold night.  I added more chicken the second time I made it to give it a little more substance and used low-fat cream of chicken soup.

We just finished this pot pie and it was YUMMY.   I made the changes that the first reader said and used broth instead of milk.  I also used "real" chicken that I boiled beforehand.  It was soooo easy!!!   And I was actually surprised how good it was b/c it was so easy to make.  I also used crescent rolls instead of biscuits b/c that is what I had on hand.  I put half on bottom and cooked them before I cooked the rest of the pie and that worked well also.  Very good meal that I will definitely be making again.

Really tasty!! I used frozen "stew mix" vegetables (potatoes, carrots, celery, and onions) and put a little shredded cheddar cheese in there as well. Also used some boneless skinless chicken breast I had in the freezer instead of the canned chunks. Overall, everyone enjoyed this dish. I will definitely make this again!!

My husband, who hates pot pie, loved this!  BUT,  the biscuits never seem to cook all the way on these types of things so I made croissants on the side and had those with it.

After Thanksgiving I wanted something quick and easy to make with the leftover turkey. This recipe was the winner.   I used about 1 cup of turkey as opposed to chicken and instead of frozen vegetables, I used can green beans (since I had no peas) creamed corn (since we didn't have regular corn) baby carrots and mushrooms. I opted to cook everything in the sauce pan and added 1 can of creamed chicken (since I used a can of creamed corn) as well as milk to get the desired consistancy. For the pie portion of this recipe, I rolled out a defrosted frozen pie crust (A leftover, since its mate was used in a pie the night before), cut shapes with cookie cutters and baked in the oven per package directions to make pie crust cookies to serve on top of the pot pie. Definitly a cheater pot pie.   I must say. I enjoyed the slight sweetness the creamed corn added.

This is a good recipe.  Simple to make and very tasty.  I used premade pie crusts instead of the biscuits.  I added poultry seasoning, a dash of dried onions and fine diced celery to the veggie/chicken mix.  I used cream of chx and cream of celery soup - use the low sodium versions otherwise it's very salty.

Huge hit with my French husband.  I turned the oven down to 375 bc I didn't want burnt biscuits raw on the inside so it took longer but cooked all the way through.  Used fresh roasted chicken, fresh veggies and organic cream of chicken soup.  Could have used more water, it was a little salty.  I thickened the mixture before it went into the oven with flour and butter or it would have been too runny.

great recipe i added some cornstarch to thicken it and baked the bottom biscuits for a few mins to light brown so they wouldnt get soggy,  i used 6 chicken tenderloins and boiled them with carrots & onion & chicken stock then added 1 can cream of chicken & 1 can cream of celery and made 2 small dishes instead of 1 big one. it was great! warm & cozy and filling. a great way to stretch your food budget.

Not fantastic, but good. I will only make again with alterations. The soup/sauce was kind of blah. I much prefer a more gravy-like sauce. Three stars mainly for ease and convenience.

Easy to make, and my daughters both liked it. I used cooked boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of canned chicken. The recipe does not specify what to cook the frozen vegetables and chicken in, so I cooked them in the liquid from cooking the chicken. I found it quite runny when done, so I added 2 tbsp cornstarch dissolved in water to thicken it a bit. Also, at the temperature specified, the biscuits would have been burned by the end of the baking time. When I looked at them at 20 minutes, they were done, so I left the pie in the oven but turned the oven off for the last 5 minutes. Thanks!

Great recipe if you want a cheap and easy dinner. But I made my with a pie crust on the bottom and I rolled 4 biscuits (canned) and made them very thin to make the top crust. I dont like thick bread.

Followed recipe with the exception, (based on others' input)  of broiling chicken breasts for 8-10 min each side - then cubing. As well, I used low fat cream of celery soup along with low fat cream of chicken. Finally, I placed the flaky biscuits on the bottom as well as the top of the pie.

Very good!  I followed the recipe pretty closely.  Instead of canned chicken though, I used a rotisseree chicken from the store, shred that up and put it in the pie.  The veggies I used were frozen peas and carrots and I added a bag of diced potatoes.  Very good and very easy!  I will definitely make again!

I've made a similar recipe but instead of biscuits, I use refrigerator crescent rolls and to really be quick and easy try plain old veg-all. Use the chicken soup, milk and canned chicken as called for. I'm telling you, quick, easy AND good!

This was good. Like other reviewers, I used 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of potato. I added some thyme while heating the soups as I found it a bit bland otherwise. Also, I used rotisserie chicken from the prepared food section of the grocery store, which tasted better than canned chicken and was just as easy! Finally, I did pre-bake my biscuits to avoid the sogginess described by others!

I really liked the taste of this. I used another reviewer's advice and put half the biscuits on the bottom and baked for 15 minutes then filled the dish and put the rest of the biscuits on top. Not enough biscuits to go around the whole top! Next time, I will try the larger biscuits. 

I also only used one can of soup, which was plenty. If it had more, it would have been too soupy. Added some petite frozen onions and frozen corn with a can of mixed veggies and it was just right.

This was great with a few simple changes.  I sauted onion, garlic and celery in butter in the bottom of the pan before adding the vegies.  Also added a tablespoon of paprika and put 1/2 the biscuit in the bottom as others recommended.  Turned out great.

this was great... I did a biscuit base... cooked it for 15 minutes. I used real boneless skinless chicken breast. I let the other biscuits sit out for about 20 minutes so they got pliable and puffy... then I rolled them out into perfect circles and layered them into a decorative design on top of the pie so they resembled more of a pie crust. Everyone loved it and it was REALLY pretty!!

My boyfriend and I really liked this recipe, but we did it a little differently.  After reading the other reviews, I made it with the biscuits on the bottom, and that was just too much bread.  I also made it using leftover crockpot roasted chicken and vegetables and added in some frozen peas & carrots.  The cream of mushroom soup with a little milk and a bit of broth was just the right mixture to go with everything and was just the right amount of creaminess.  Word to the wise, just make sure to check how long your biscuits say to cook them, because 15 minutes were a little too long for mine.  Overall, very very good.  I will definately make this again!

WOW!! Really good!! Very hearty warm meal. I did make some changes suggested by reviewers. Cooked half the biscuits on the bottom, used fresh chicken and fresh veggies. I cut up a large potato, 1/2 cup of peas and diced up some carrots. Boiled them til soft and put with mixture. I also had to put some flour in soup mixture to thicken up. Next time Im not gonna put biscuits on the bottem werent as good as the ones on top. Also gonna try some brocolli with it too...Thank you.

This was good! My little girl ate two servings, and wanted more. I didn't have chicken, but I substituted it with tuna, and it turned out fine. I used homemade biscuits, b/c that's our preference. Thanks for the recipe - I'll be making it again!

I liked this recipe, but be careful.  I used a pie plate and when I went to take it out of the oven, the biscuits had slid and were hanging over the edge of the pie plate and the topping was oozing out into the oven.  The next time, I would use a casserole dish instead or something deeper than the pie plate to bake it in.

This is extremely bland. I even added minced onion, garlic and thyme. I used left-over herb roasted chicken. The part of the bisquit sitting closest to the mixture came out uncooked and raw tasting to me.

I used crescent rolls instead of layer rolls, and that made it amazing.  Also used one less can of soup (since I was out) and it still was very good.

I loved this recipe and made some changes. I added a can of mushrooms and celery with a little onion. I also added about 3/4 teaspoon of dill weed. I also substitued sour cream for milk.I added cream of mushroom instead of the chicken soup.Fresh cut carrots and corn was also added.I made my own biscuits from a recipe I found on here called J.P. Big Daddy biscuits. That recipe for biscuits is flawless!!!!!!!!!

As good as I expected a pot pie to be w/o all the trouble of making from scratch. Had to use one can of cream of mushroom and kept the other,chicken. However, I think cream of potatoe would work much better. If you have extra chicken, use that instead. I don't think the canned stuff works that great in this, even though it's a good concept. I'd suggest adding your own blend of seasoning or it'll come out quite bland.

So easy and delicious.  I used regular chicken, chopped to bite-size pieces and sauted.  Then added veggies and soup.  Also used low-fat very large buttermilk biscuits.  My husband and 2 yr old both loved it!

This was just ok. Good to try, but not a regular to add to the meal plan. Maybe some potatoes would help it out some. Just seemed to be lacking in the warm, hearty department that one would expect from a pot pie. Seemed more like a bland chicken soup with biscuts on top.

Super easy, and super versatile, but found it could use a bit more spice.  The last time I made it, I added just a touch of curry powder to take it out of the bland, and it turned into a 5 star!  Also use any leftover chicken instead of canned, and any refrigerator biscuit or crescent (they all work well so far).

My husband and I really love chicken pot pie, but the taste of this chicken pot pie was too "processed" for us.  The biscuit topping is too salty as well.  The recipe was fast, but sacrificed flavor.  We won't be making this again.

This was very easier, and better tasting than I expected. I used cresants instead of biscuite, and used a can of cream of clery instead of one of the chickens. Very tasty!

YUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!
sOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooooOOOOOO EASY!!!!  The only suggestion is...
make the biscuits seperate.  The underside didn't bake so i flipped them and left the whole thing in longer.  This is some serious comfort food.  My Mom said it tasted like it was from Po'Folks, a country style restaurant here in California by Knott's Berry Farm.  I didn't have frozen veggies so I used 1 can each of carrots and corn.
Definate keeper!
