Wonderful Cream Cheese Cookies! My recipe is a little different however. If you want your dough to be perfect you MUST use real butter and make sure it is unsalted. I use Land O Lakes. I use 8oz. of cream cheese, not 3oz. 1 1/2 cup sugar, 1 cup of unsalted butter, 1 8oz cream cheese, 1 egg, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp almond extract, 3 1/2 cup flour and 1 tsp baking powder. I've never had problems getting these to roll out after chilling the appropriate amount of time. They bake easy and taste wonderful. I use royal icing to decorate. They make great gifts as long as I can get them out of the house before everyone in my family eats them!!

This recipe is definitely a keeper.  Rather than roll and cut out the cookies I use a small scoop (or teaspoon), then flatten them slightly with a pecan or walnut half, then bake.  I also have doubled the recipe, baked half the dough and formed the remaining dough into two cylinders, wrapped in plastic wrap and freeze.  When slightly thawed, slice 1/4" thick and bake.

I used the suggested changes of another user.  I used 1 cup unsalted real butter, 8oz. of cream cheese, 1 1/2 cup sugar, 1 egg, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp almond extract, 3 1/2 cup flour and 1 tsp baking powder.  Very easy to work with and tasted great!

GREAT recipe.   Wonderful flavor, moist, perfect for decorating, easy to roll if you keep chilled. Must add a little more flour than the recipe calls for.   I scoured through all of the recipes on this site for just the right cookie cutout.  Given the multitude of mixed reviews, I was unsure, but liked the variation.  I am extremely happy that I took the chance.  These cookies were wonderful...everyone loved them and I will need to make another batch before Valentine's Day!

Really yummy cookie. I did increase the almond and vanilla extract to a tsp. each but I made no other changes. After chilling the dough overnight, we were ready to go. The dough just had to sit out for about 15 minutes to take the chill off and you really have to work fast because the dough warms quickly. I cut my cookies thicker because....we'll, it's a personal choice so I got much less than 72 cookies. No problem because this recipe is great! 375* for nine minutes was the perfect time for me. NOTE: If you wait a couple minutes after you take the cookies out of the oven and just let them cool on the cookie sheet, they'll slide right off onto your spatula.

Perfect! Here are some sugar cookie rolling tips to make the most of your dough, as well as make things go a little easier and faster for you (hopefully!), because these are as time consuming as you'll let them be!  So worth it though!:  -I divide the ENTIRE batch into about 5 pieces, and leave them covered in plastic wrap or in plastic baggies in the fridge, removing one at a time to roll out.   -Once I've used my cookie cutters on one as much as I can, I roll up the scraps, put them back into the plasic wrap/baggie, and into the fridge it goes.  I do not re-roll it, even if I'm working fast and the dough's still cold.   I then move onto the next ball of dough in the fridge, and so on, rotating in the same order I started.  I do this until all of the dough is gone.  -Everything gets rolled out onto a surface dusted with a 50/50 mixture of powdered sugar and flour.  The powdered sugar helps keep the dough from getting tough, instead of using just flour alone. I hope all this helped some of you! Enjoy and have fun decorating!!

For anyone who really wants to enjoy these cookies you really have to use pure vanilla and almond extract. Philidelphia cream cheese and real unsalted sweat cream butter not margarine. Cut out your shapes a little thick. And make life easy on yourself by covering the cold dough with wax paper when you roll it out. If you would like them a little sweeter don't hesitate to frost them. NOW ENJOY!!! MMMMMMMMMMMM

These were delicious.  After I made the first batch....I had to make another because my Husband ate them all.  I didn't roll them out and use cookie cutters.  Instead I rolled them into balls and pressed them out with a glass.  Then sprinkled decorated sugar on top...delicious.  Thanks for the post.

This is a finicky recipy to work with, but if done right the cookies come out great. Be sure to work with the dough in portions (1/4 to 1/3 the dough at a time, chilling the rest when not being used). A few modifications are necessary, however. I used an extra 1/4 cu flour and used the entire egg and reduced the oven temperature to 325. For me, these made really awesome cookies that, when topped with the Butter Icing for Sugar Cookies recipe from this site (1 tsp almond instead of the vanilla), get great reviews. I never have any leftover.

This has been a Christmas tradition to bake and decorate these cookies since I was a little girl.  I have passed this on to my children as well and we have baked and decorated them every year for the past 14 years too!  They are the absolute favorite cookies in our household.  We make "paint" to decorate them by mixing 2c. confectioners suger, 1t. vanilla, and 2 egg whites.  Add food coloring and we "paint" our decorations on them for a sweet holiday treat!!!!

You won't regret baking this one!

These cookies are yummy, especially if you like cream cheese.  However, they are very fragile (crumbly).  It's difficult to give them away as gifts during the holidays.

I was so excited to try these cookies since they have cream cheese in them.  I was so dissap- pointed when I ate one.  They were greatly lacking in flavor.

Excellent cookie!  My family liked this better than the recipe for Best Rolled Sugar Cookies, from this site.  I do have to disagree with the recipe submitter that 1) the oven has to be preheated at least 30 minutes in advance and 2)that the dough has to be chilled 8 hrs or overnight or this cookie won't roll without sticking.  My foolproof way of doing this is once the cookies are mixed, roll out the dough between 2 pieces of parchment paper.  Put the rolled out dough on a cookie sheet or something flat & put in the freezer for 15-20 minutes.  Then you can peel off the top layer of parchment paper & cut out your cookies & pop them in the oven.  The dough will be nice & firm & it will hold it's shape beautifully while you transfer them to the cookie sheet & also as they bake.  I have used this method time & time again & it has never failed.  If you have large batches to bake, keep the dough in the fridge & while the first batch is baking, roll out & freeze the next set of cookies.  By the time one batch is done, the next will be ready to pop in.  And as for the oven preheating for so long, I'm not sure why that's part of the recipe but I've never done that & it hasn't been an issue.

I found this recipe over 2 years ago and have been very pleased with it!  Everyone loves the flavor that the cream cheese and extracts give the dough. Since I've made these cookies many times, I'd like to address some of the problems others have had. 1)I agree that the recipe could use a bit more flour.  In fact, I add 1/2 cup of extra flour to all my cookie recipes.  2)As far as baking unevenly or browning too quickly, I experimented. I used a regular metal cookie sheet with parchment paper and the cookies browned, just as I thought they would.  But when baked on my baking stone, the cookies turn out perfect everytime.  3)The original recipe states that unused dough needs to remain in fridge and I agree.  The cookies keep a good shape and the dough is easier to work with when very,very cold. 4)If you are making small cookies, watch the time carefully. It only makes sense that they may not need as much time to bake. So, if you are thinking of using this recipe, keep some of these things in mind.  It's a good recipe and the taste is unique.  It will be worth the effort.

This is my second review of this recipe.  I've made these a few times now and have made a few changes.  I used 1 cup unsalted butter, 8 oz cream cheese, one whole egg, a full teaspoon each of almond and vanilla extracts and salt.  I also used powdered sugar to roll them out rather than flour.  These are amazing.  I've had several people ask for the recipe.  I've never been a fan of sugar cookies until now.  My boyfriend said the same thing.  The first time I made them, he wouldn't even try them until he heard how much everyone else liked them, now he asks for them.

I tried this recipe after "The Best Rolled Sugar cookies" were not as tasty and soft as the reviews stated. These turned out great. They are soft, rolled fine after 3 hrs. chilled with a dusting of flour or powdered sugar, easy to cut, and did not lose their shape when baked. I did use the 8oz of cream cheese, 3 1/4 cups flour, 1 1/2 cup sugar, 1 tsp. baking powder as suggested by another. I used 1/2 cup of margarine and 1/2 cup of butter to equal the full cup needed.  Will make again!

I followed the recipe others listed-1 c. butter, 8 oz. creamcheese, 1 1/2 c. sugar, 1 egg, 1 t. vanilla, 1/2 t. almond extract, 3 1/2 c. flour, & 1 t. baking powder. They turned out soft and with just the right hint of almond. I chilled the dough overnight and it rolled out easily. I baked them ahead of time, froze them, then thawed and decorated with buttercream frosting. Delicious!!!

These turned out beautiful and taste very good. The dough rolled out very easily after overnight refrideration. I did keep the dough a little thicker than 1/8'' and only baked for 7 mins. because I like these kinds of cookies very soft. I used the "Sugar Cookie Icing" recipe and ended up with some stunning cookies that were almost too pretty to eat.

This was almost the same recipe that I have used for years. I changed 2 things. I added 1t of Cream of Tartar, this will make your cookie a soft cut-out cookie, and I left out the Almond. Thanks for sharing

I made these today for valentines day, thy came out great! I followed one reviewers recipe and added 8oz cream cheese 1tsp baking powder and only 3 1/2 cups flour. I also didn't have any almond extract handy so I used 1 1/2tsp vanilla instead. Decorated with royal icing. They're so good, crunchy on the edges chewy in the middle. Be careful when bakin these... The minimum time (7 minutes) burnt my first pan a bit. 5 minutes and they came out perfect!

10 Star Recipe!!! This is the sugar cookie that I've been searching for! The cream cheese & almond extract set this cookie apart from regular sugar cookies; the taste is phenominal. They bake up beautifully and stay nice and soft. The dough is easy to work with as long as it's not too cold and not too warm. Frosted with my favorite cookie frosting (Sugar Cookie Frosting from this site) for the perfect combination. Yum Yum Yum. Thanks! :)

I made these for my hubby to take to work and share with his co-workers. They absolutely devoured them! One said that they were the best sugar cookie he's ever had (I think it was the almond extract). I made them exactly according to the recipe. I refrigerated them overnight and I was a little alarmed when I took the dough out of the fridge because it was so dry and hard. I just let it warm to room temp and it was super easy to work with. I rolled it out between parchment paper and didn't even need any flour to keep from sticking. My only complaint is that the cookies were a bit fragile. I cut them into shamrocks for St. Paddy's Day and the stems kept braking off. However, that could be because I rolled them too thin. I frosted them with "Sugar Cookie Icing" from this site, which was perfect since it also has almond extract. Overall this is an excellent recipe. The dough is easy to work with and the almond extract gives it that little something extra.

Excellent recipe for cookies!  We will do this recipe again for the family.  We already have gone through half the cookies between the children, husband and myself.  I did do a little variation and used all the egg and I always use real butter when doing rolled cookies, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Using real butter helps with the dough not being sticky.  Margarine has a higher percentage of water.  I only refigerated this for an hour and was able to roll the cookies.

These cookies were the BEST and super easy!!!  I did not find the dough to be too sticky.  I made sure to pack the flour down in the measuring cup each time.  I froze the dough in three loaves for about 45 minutes and it rolled out perfectly!  I made these for St. Pat's with an Irish Derby cookie cutter! Everyone loved the almond taste.

Made modifications as suggested by others. 8oz cream cheese, omit salt, 1 c butter, 1 1/2 c sugar, 1 egg, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp almond extract, 3 1/2 c flour, 1 tsp baking soda. Baked 6.5 min @ 375.  Love how these smell & taste. Will definitely be my go to recipe for sugar cookies.

Just made these with my daughter.  They're delicious!  I also took the advice of the other reviewers and used the 8oz cream cheese and 1 whole egg.  I didn't have any unsalted butter so I used salted but didn't add the salt the recipe called for so it balanced out nicely.  I also didn't have any almond extract so I just doubled my vanilla.  I'll be making these again soon to give as gifts.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

The main ingredients of this recipe are identical to the Butter Snow Flakes recipe from this site so I tried this dough in my cookie press instead of chilling it for rolling out.  The texture and consistency of the dough was perfect for the cookie press.  The taste is nice and they will look great decorated.

Although this original recipe is good, I found that one of the reviewer's revised ingredients of the recipe is even better. The revised ingredients: 1 1/2 cup sugar, 1 cup of unsalted butter, 1 8oz cream cheese, 1 egg, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp almond extract, 3 1/2 cup flour and 1 tsp baking powder. The how-to part of the recipe is the same as original.  Rolls out great, texture great. This version tastes like cheesecake in a cookie! A must try :)

Great cookies! They turned out very soft and moist. I took the advice of others and made some changes to the recipe: 1 1/2 cup sugar, 1 cup softened unsalted butter, 1 (8 oz) pkg cream cheese, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp almond extract, 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1 egg, 3 1/2 cup flour, 1 tsp baking powder.

This is a very good recipe. Simple to make actually. I did follow some suggestions from the other reviewers though. I added 5oz as opposed to 3oz of cream cheese. Although, next time I think I will use the entire 8oz brick. Also, I am not overly fond of the intense almond taste. I might cut back on that by half and double the vanilla extract instead. Definitely chill dough over night. Also, while rolling it out, whatever you aren't using can be put back in the frig until you are ready so it doesn't warm up.

Awesome cookies, loved the addition of the cream cheese.  This will replace my other sugar cookie recipes.  I did follow the advice of others and used a full 8oz of cream cheese, with more flour.

Finally found my tried and true sugar cookie recipe. I made the first batch exactly as written and found the dough very hard to roll. The second time, I refrigerated for 1 hour and found it was much easier to manipulate. Instead of using flour to prevent from sticking I used powdered sugar which helps the taste.

These are awesome! I love cream cheese so I was really hoping they would turn out. I followed what other reviewers did and used 1 1/2 cups of white sugar, an 8 oz. brick of cream cheese and 3 1/2 cups of flour. This made 6 dozen cookies for me. I chilled the dough overnight - I made the cookies at 7pm the night before and began rolling them out at 10am the next morning. They were a bit tough so you may need to really knead the dough. The dough is really easy to work with, I found it wasn't sticky at all. I decorated them with Sugar Cookie Frosting off this site. Enjoy!

I often make these cookies for Christmas. They are my daughter's favorite and are absolutely delicious. However, I too have a problem with rolled cookies. I followed instructions from another recipe and shaped the dough into balls about 1 1/2 inch in diameter and dip a small flat bottomed glass into colored sugar and flatten the cookie gently till about 1/4 inch thick and bake as usual. Same wonderful taste, but much easier to make. By the way, I'm eating one right now.

YUM! I can taste the cream cheese. This is a super easy recipe..just use real unsalted butter & philadelphia cream cheese- I read others that said the cookie was sorta bland so I added 1tsp real vanilla instead of 1/2 and about 3/4 tsp almond extract. Happy Baking!

These are really good. I've never made sugar cookies with cream cheese before and wasn't sure what to expect but I liked them. They tasted a little shortbread-y. Made as per the recipe and the dough was super easy to work with - I'm not a big fan of rolling out dough but this gave me no troubles at all. After they came out of the oven at first, they seemed a little fragile but they firmed up (while still saying soft to eat). I will say that I can't imagine how anyone could possibly get 6 dozen cookies out of this recipe. I got 27 cookies total and 9 of them were a little bigger than the other 18. This is more than enough for my needs this time, but nowhere near 6 dozen.

Cherish and other reviewers suggested the following changes and these cookies came out perfect!
1 1/2 cup sugar, 1 cup of unsalted butter, 1 8oz cream cheese, 1 egg, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp almond extract, 3 1/2 cup flour and 1 tsp baking powder


I might have only used 1cup sugar though, can't exactly remember.

But- these cookies were absolutely delicious! They were soft, not too sweet, perfect flavourful (I could eat them without frosting, though its even better with it). 

This is one of the best and easiest recipes I've tried on allrecipes. This will be my go to sugar cookie recipe from now on.

Frosting:
*I hate sickly sweet frosting, and began to follow the Sugar Cookie Frosting recipe on this website as reviewers said it wasn't too sweet. I hated it-- it was waay to sweet, so I modified it. Here is my frosting recipe:

1cup unsalted butter,
3-4 cups icing (confectioners) sugar (start with 2-3cups and add more until you get your desired sweetness)
8-10TBSP milk
1pkg (8oz) cream cheese
2/3 tsp almond extract
1 1/2tsp Vanilla extract
Food colouring

Beat all ingredients together. Its perfectly flavoured and not overly sweet. If you let the frosting dry overnight on the cookies, it will be stackable, but the frosting does not completely harden.

These turned out perfectly!  The cream cheese really adds depth to the flavor, and they are not quite as sugary sweet as most sugar cookie recipes.  I try to make sugar cookies at all of the holidays, and this will be a recipe I will turn to often.

If you love a soft sugar cookie, you'll love these. I liked it better though without salt, also unsalted butter. I found that using 4 oz cream cheese gave more flavor, and 2 1/2 cups flour made for perfect rolling out. Also rolled them out 1/4 inch thick. Thanks Karin!

Well I messed this one up.  I misread the 3 oz and put in 8oz of Cream Cheese...  Oops!  So I just added another 1/2 cup of flour.  Then I refrigerated overnight.  I rolled out with pwd sugar instead of flour just b/c I had already added more flour to the batter.  I rolled the batter out to AT LEAST 1/4 in thick.  I baked the cookies for apprx 10 mins and the cutouts did not loose their shape.  I iced and sugared these. My husband said they were awesome and couldn't imagine them with any less cream cheese...   =)

I am only putting 1 star because I didn't use the recipe measurements. I used measurements by another poster Cherish.  The cookies are awesome!  I may never make plain sugar cookies again. They were soft, moist, and very flavorful.  I was not able to chill the dough for 8 hrs, so I chilled in the freezer for 2 hours and rolled them out on floured wax paper and baked them on parchment paper.  GREAT, GREAT, GREAT recipe!

MMMMMM!!!
I've made these cookies a few times, and they always turn out well. 
The first time, I made them for my roommate, and her and her brother ended up fighting over them.
The last time I made them, they were for a bake sale; one person came by and bought a couple, then came back and bought all 80 cookies. 
These never disappoint! 
I always melt the butter completely to make the cookies soft and chewy, and I choose to omit the almond extract as I find it adds an odd smell. 
Now I feel like eating some, so I'll make another batch today!  :)

Wow! The flavor is fantastic. I change up the extracts though. I've used cherry and vanilla. Cherry & lemon. My favorite so far is lemon and coconut. I do not roll them out the recipe is too moist. I really don't want to add more flour becuse the flavor is perfect. It taste like a cheesecake cookie. My husbands favorite cookies now. The kids loved them just as much.
Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Followed erecipe exactly as written. Delish. Easy - cookies were a little hard to roll if the dough got too warm, but that was it. Excellent flavor and texture.

A+ Recipe! The best recipe on this site by far. BUT one note though: DO NOT ADD ANY ALMOND EXTRACT! Just vanilla extract.

These are my all-time favorite cookies ever and a definite MUST for the holidays.  I roll them out slightly thicker, about a quarter-inch, and bake them for only 4.5 minutes instead of the full 7 - 10.  The cookies come out very soft, but after cooled, they are firm enough to properly frost.  Excellent!  Excellent!  Excellent!

Love this recipe! It's so nice to see a good variation on a simple sugar cookie. I used lemon extract instead of almond and it was DELICIOUS.

These were so good!!  the dough was a little stickier than most sugar cookie doughs.  I will have to experiment and read some other reviews to see if there are solutions for that.  I added a little more almond extract for a little more almond flavor!!  These were fantastic!!!

These are excellent.  The almond flavor gives the sugar cookies a new twist of flavor.  These DO NOT work well in my cookie cutter gun though...

Great cookies. Not exactly what I was looking for but worked really well as cut-out cookies with butter-cream frosting. I added a little more cream cheese because as is you can't really taste it. They taste more like sugar cookies.

Having read that one reviewer only needed to freeze the dough for 45 minutes, I ,too, did the same. I used the sugar cookie icing from this site, but flavored them with peppermint. The whole house loved these cookies, so I will be making them again, but will add a little more cream cheese. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Tasted great, easy to roll out (with a little more flour), cut outs held their shape well, and the cookies stayed nice and soft after cooling. They frosted nicely. I didn't have any almond extract so I doubled the vanilla and the cookies still tasted yummy! The cream cheese isn't over-powering

This is one of the best cookies I've ever tasted.  Instead of rolling out the dough, try instead an easier method.  Because the dough is so soft, I chilled it for a few hours, divided it in three portions and rolled each up log style in plastic wrap and froze them for about an hour, then sliced them and baked them.  That way each cookie is tender as the first because you don't add flour and reroll the dough.  They are fabulous!

After reading the reviews, I decided to follow the recipe exactly as posted.  Delicious sugar cookie with a slight cream cheese flavor.  I refrigerated the dough overnight and let sit at room temperature for 15 minutes before rolling out.  Cookies turned out perfect!!!

This is my go-to recipe for any holiday cut-out cookies except that I double the extracts. If you really want the best results, don't roll your dough out with flour. Stay with me here - divide your dough into quarters and roll one portion out at a time between two sheets of parchment paper leaving the other portions in the fridge. I then transfer the rolled-out dough to the fridge again on a cookie sheet to chill a bit longer. Using this method ensures two things - you're not adding extra flour each time you re-roll your dough, and when it comes time to cut, your dough is cold enough to retain shape during transfer. I frost with a recipe containing powdered sugar, milk (ensures it "crusts" or hardens), corn syrup (keeps it shiny), and almond extract.

These are wonderful tender cut out cookies! The dough does need to be chilled and then brought back to room temperature to roll really well. The bit of almond give them such a special flavor, setting them apart from other sugar cookies. I also frost them with Sugar Cookie Icing (from this site), which includes almond. I make these every holiday. Thank you.

This is literally the very best sugar cookie recipe in the world!  I made several batches for valentines day.  I left the dough in the fridge overnight but it was really too hard to roll out so I got it all out and let it get a little bit warm for rolling.  I also used a cream cheese frosting.  Everyone loved these cookies.  I used the recommended recipe which called for the 1 1/2 cups sugar, 1 8oz pkg cream cheese, and 3 1/2 cups flour.  Wonderful, wonderful cookie

Love! Love! Love! this receipe.  Thank you so much for sharing!  I did take the advice and added the extra cream cheese, sugar and baking powder, but still found the recipe to be easy to work with.  I made valentine cookie flowers for my bestfriend and placed them in a flower pot.  I'll post some photos soon.  The extras went to work with my husband and everyone loved them!  Thanks for sharing!

when i was making these, I kept thinking the dough was the consistency of buttercream frosting.  And I didn't think they would set up enough to roll out.  Anyway, they did.  I didn't try to use cookie cutter, but rather just small round smashed with bottom of glass.

They're an ok cookie.  Nothing horrible, nothing great.

Made these today and they are great! Used a heart cutter and red sugar for Valentine's Day but I'm sure they won't last! The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because the dough was rock hard after letting it chill in fridge overnite, almost had to chisel it out of bowl. After sitting at room temp though it did roll out nicely. Cut them a little thick, brushed with egg white and sprinkled with sugar. Definately will use this instead of my regular sugar cookie recipe

I have used this recipe for years. My family and friends demand these every Christmas. Always soft and always moist, these are the perfect sugar cookie. The taste is heavenly. Always, keep the dough refrigerated, I take out a portion at a time to roll out leaving the rest in the fridge.

PHENOENAL!!!  That is literally how good these cookies are.  I followed some suggestions and changed a few measurements.  I used 1 1/2 c. sugar, 1 t. salt, 8 oz. cream cheese, 1 t. vanilla (omitted almond due to allergy), 2 3/4 flour, 2 egg yolks, and 1 t. baking powder.   I put the dough in the freezer for about an hour and a half and rolled out between waxed paper baked eight minutes.  I topped with "cake with buttercream decoration" frosting from this site.  PERFECTION.

SO GOOD!!
I followed the original recipe and didn't have any problem at all. But next time I am going to increase the cream cheese to 8oz instead of 3 oz to just see the difference of the taste and then I will repost my review.

I was looking for a recipe for my Cookie Press for Christmas, and these turned out just perfect! I DID NOT refrigerate the dough at all, and it was the perfect consistency to be pushed through the press. I added some green food coloring and made some trees and wreaths. I will be saving this one!

These cookies were good and easy to make. I was a little nervous when I made the dough since it was so sticky, but after refrigerating overnight, it was workable. I made a couple changes to the recipe, I used 8oz of creamcheese, since I didnt want any left over and I used 2 1/2 cups of flour. As another reviewer suggested I rollded the dough into balls and then pressed down with the bottom of a glass. I sprinkled the  cookies with colored sugar before baking,  I only baked for 8 minutes.

Hi Karin, this is Karen.  Thank you so much for this recipe.  I never make sugar cookies cuz I hate hard, dry cookies.  These are awsome. I did use 8 oz. of cream cheese though, and decreased the butter to 3/4 cup to even it out.  I wasn't sure how it was going to turn out so I used a whole egg and 1/2 tsp baking soda.  They came out perfect.  I used them with a recipe from the food network called stained glass cookies.  You just put a hole, round or square, in the cutout and then crush up different colors of Jolly Ranchers and put 2 different colors in each square or round and they look like stained glass windows.  They turned out great.  I also added some cherry juice, red food coloring, and 8 or 9 chopped maraschino cherries to the cookie dough and they were a pretty pink with stained glass.

I made some very minor changes: 1 tsp vanilla, 4 oz cream cheese, and a whole egg. I refrigerated the dough for about 12 hours so it was easy to work with. I've been baking these all day and snacking on them - delicious! My family loves them too. Time to make the frosting :)

Taste good, but just as everyone else said-the dough was too soft to roll and cut. I had to keep putting it in the freezer. Not worth the effort unless you are VERY patient.

These cookies are very addictive.  I gave them to my friends at Christmas and froze some of the dough for later.  I thawed out the dough in the fridge for a couple hours, still just as good a month later. I frosted some but they are also delicious plain.

I didn't roll out these cookies, but used them like drop cookies instead and they turned out perfect!  They were very soft and moist and just sweet enough.  Plus they are pretty low cal for a cookies so we eat them pretty quick around our house.  I have to make a double batch for our family and neighbors at least once a week!

The cream cheese gave it a nice flavor. It did not make 6 doz. With my Christmas cookie cutters it only made 42 unless you have very small cutters. Do not make them too thin or they will be crisp. I found that making them thicker keep them soft and chewy. I have been looking for a Christmas cookie recipe for a long time and I think this is the one.

I love the flavour of these cookies since they taste plain enough for me to give them a nice icing on top. Very easy to make and really nice dough. I used this variation that i th1ought would be best from another reviewer. 1 1/2 cup sugar, 1 cup of unsalted butter, 1 8oz cream cheese, 1 egg, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp almond extract, 3 1/2 cup flour and 1 tsp baking powder.

I actually have not reviewed anything yet (although I should I'm on here enough lol) BUT this was a pretty simple recipe to put together and work with, which I really enjoyed because a lot of sugar cookie recipes can be a pain in the butt.  I feel like the recipe lacked in flavor a bit though, I think I will add just a touch more vanilla and sour cream just to get that flavor to stand out more.  With that said, though, I really enjoyed that the cookies were not too sweet.  I just pulled out the last batch and can't wait to decorate them with my little girl for her valentines party :)

This is a delicious and mosit sugar cookie recipe. I add a 1/4 tsp of lemon extract as well. I roll my dough into a log, double wrap it into saran wrap and let sit a full 24 hours in the fridge. I use a whole egg too. (because most of the time i forget to seperate! :) The key is keeping this dough cold. When it gets warm it is too hard to work with. So cut of a log at a time and keep the rest in the fridge while you work. Everyone loved these for christmas i iced them with the sugar cookie icing recipe from this website.

I think this is a great base recipe. I also tried Cherish's modifications and those are excellent as well. I like the Sugar Cookie Icing recipe, too ~ the icing was pretty, shiny, easy to work with and tasty! Enjoy these cookies, we do!!

Outstanding. Stayed chewy for a couple a couple of days. Kids had fun making shamrock and other shapes. I put a standard confections sugar icing on top and was a great combo.

Tried this. Never baked before. It was easy to do. I tried both suggestions (plain with icing and some with egg white and sprinkles). Both turned out excellent. Great tasting.

These cookies hold their shape perfectly if you decide to use cookie cutters. They stay soft and melt in your mouth. This is the very best sugar cookie recipe I've ever used, and I don't know if I have a use for any others anymore. :)

Well i have not baked them yet but the dough is in the fridge. I added 1/2 cup confct. sugar b/c i found that after i added the flour it was lacking sweetness. I also added 1/4 tsp more of the almond extract and 3 drops rum extract and 1/2 tsp lemon and i omitted the vanilla simply b/c i feel that the vanilla gives sugar cookies a generic flavor(personal Preference) Dough tasted great-other than the raw flour.lol

I used the variation posted by some reviewers of 1 1/2 cup sugar, 1 cup of unsalted butter, 1 8oz cream cheese, 1 egg, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp almond extract, 3 1/2 cup flour and 1 tsp baking powder. I wouldn't reccommend this variation. The cookies had a very bland flavor. The almond extract also gave a wierd taste. After making a batch of these and another recipe, I realized the all butter (instead of butter/creamcheese) recipe has a much better flavor.

These were the perfect rolled sugar cookies! I used the first commenters suggestions and they turned out amazing! I used a 50/50 mix of flour and powder sugar to keep my dough from sticking. These are my new go to rolled sugar cookies!

By far, my most favorite sugar cookie recipe EVER. I make it often, and have gotten so many compliments! They stay nice and soft, and have an amazing flavor (as opposed to some other sugar cookies that taste like cardboard dressed up with icing). I make it just as written (sometimes I may use 4 oz of cream cheese instead of 3, because then it's a perfect half of my 8 oz block). I usually use the 'Sugar Cookie Icing' recipe here on AllRecipes.

These cookies are the absolute best sugar cookies ever. Period. I bring these to work around Christmas time and for Valentine's day and people go nuts- this is in no way an exaggeration. I've been told they're addictive. I don't even like sugar cookies, and I love these guys. Just make them! You'll see.

Soft and Chewy w/ a nice hint of cream cheese. Very easy to make. I even just threw it all together in a bowl (no sep wet/dry) and mixed with a wooden spoon. I followed the advice of others and increase the cream cheese to 8 oz., the flour to 2 3/4 c., the sugar to 1 1/2 c., the vanilla to 1 tsp., and used 2 whole eggs. I placed  the dough inside plastic wrap and used it to form a log. Place the log in the freezer for about an hour then sliced the log into cookies. Cookies did not spread and held their shape. I had to cook them closer to 12 minutes on a light cookie sheet. They were golden on the bottom and very light, almost white on top. Next time I will make them a little thinner and see how they come out. They taste even better cold the next day. Yum!

I made this recipe for Valentine's Day and they were a hit.  I listened to some of the advice and added more cream cheese, I think about 3/4 cup.  But honestly I could've added more.  I also used turbinado sugar and about half a cup brown sugar.  Then I made cream cheese frosting with powdered sugar which was yummy!

Great recipe!  This time around I decided to make a chocolate version of the cookie, because I wanted a darker look to complement my new folk cutters.  I used 8 oz. cream cheese and added 1/2 cup cocoa powder to the recipe.  Roll between waxed paper, pop the dough sheets in the fridge overnight and they're ready to go the next day!

I followed the measurements as described by the first reviewer, Cherish except that I used 3 and one fourth cups flour and floured my surface generously.  I had a small problem with spreading in my first batch, but since I kept flouring my surface, I didn't have problems with subsequent batches due to the added flour.  I would suggest testing one cookie before making a whole batch.  

Taste was excellent.  8oz cream cheese added a lot.  Maybe I will add some lemon extract next time or substitute part all purpose flour with almond flour.

A wonderful cookie. I baked it in my convectio oven at 350 degrees and they only needed 7 minutes to cook. I used the sugar cookie frostsing from AllRecipes to ice the cookies and they turned out wonderful!

This recipe was quite good.  I did read the reviews before baking, so I felt I had a heads up on the potential problems.

These turned out the most tender when I did not over mix or over handle the dough.  I made a few batches very thin, and they turned out nice and crisp, then I turned the oven down to 350 and made them  thicker- again a nice tender cookie.
I did go a little heavier on the vanilla and almond, and I made a glaze and covered in colored sugar- added another dimension to the texture-we like our cookies really sweet, so the frosting was necessary.
Because I did not want to over handle the dough(and make them tough or dry) I did try to not roll the dough out more then once- so wasted some-worth it I think. 
I did watch these cookies more closely, they do tend to cook irregularly at the higher temp.

Excellent recipe!!! The dough was quite soft, and I had to work fast with it when rolling and cutting.  But it tastes REALLY great and was the perfect cookie in my opinion.  It's not sickenly sweet like most sugar cookies.  These were a HUGE hit at my house!

Wonderfully soft cookie with a great flavor!  The cream cheese really makes these cookies stand apart from your basic sugar cookie.  I rolled mine out to about 1/4 inch as they don't rise much.  I used a royal icing on some and a cream cheese icing on the rest.  Both were exceptional!  The royal icing allows you to be detailed in decorating them while the cream cheese icing is just yummy!  I will use this as my sugar cookie recipe from now on!

I have made these several times and they are so wonderful and flavorful - they are the best sugar cookie recipe I  have found. I add 1 tsp each vanilla and almond extract. If you find your dough too runny you didn't add enough flour just adjust. I find 2 1/4 to be perfect. I use Nutri-flour it is a great way to sneak a little health into the little one's treats. I teach children and hand these out the final day of class. I cut these into letter shapes and frost with white icing then let the kids take turns speed drawing on them with edible food markers (1 minute) it is great fun for everyone  :)

This is such a TASTY cookie. I made sure my dough was chilled and I used lots of flour on the counter and the rolling pin and they rolled out fine for me. Careful not to overcook, they brown very very quickly. And I agree with a previous poster, when you roll them out make sure to air on the thick side. I do NOT like sugar cookies, but I was making these for my daughters class for valentines day and I at 2 with out frosting they are so tasty!

I'm not sure what recipe everyone followed but it sure didn't turn out to be a 5-star cookie.  I made the dough and dumped out right away.  Even if I had frozen it as others have, I could tell it was WAY too sticky to work with.  I don't get how everyone was able to use this horrible stuff!  I tasted it and it was completely BLAH!  No taste at all.  I tried to add more sweet ingredients to liven it up and nothing helped.  All I did was waste my baking supplies.  Arrgh!

It doesn't get any better than this - SOOOOOOO good!  I didn't have time to refrigerate the dough for a long time, so I simply separated into three parts, placed in the freezer for 45 minutes and it worked just fine. It is sticky, but I just used plenty of flour and it wasn't a huge obstacle.  Will use this every time I make sugar cookies from now on. Thank you!

This is a great sugar cookie for cutouts. I let it chill over night and the dough emerged as hard as a rock! I had to let it warm up about 30 minutes before I could even begin to work with it. Next time, I won't let it chill so long. It was easy to cut and  held its shape well while baking. The flavor is very good and my children enjoyed them. I frosted them with sugar cookie icing from this site.

Oh my gosh!!! These are melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  I read all the reviews before I made this recipe.  I decided to just make it "AS DIRECTED" though.  I usually cannot resist tweaking every recipe "just a little".  Boy am I glad I left this one alone.  I found I had the best results when I used my airbake cookie sheets and baked them more toward the 7-7 1/2 minute time frame.  I'm having a hard time leaving any for others to taste.  Thanks, Karin, for this wonderful recipe.

I definitely suggest using pure vanilla and almond extract as well as using philadelphia cream cheese for a better taste. the dough was not easy to work with so I refrigerated it over night and that worked great. I also took the suggestion of cutting the dough a little thicker. I used royal icing on the top. big hit at my Christmas party

Okay in taste, but really difficult to do if you follow the instructions given, that is why I rate this lower.  First off to even get them hard enough to roll (and not too sticky) you have to put the dough in the freezer over night and only take out a small amount to work with as you go.  Second, I found the cookies needed about 14-15 minutes in the oven to make them hard enough so they would not bend all over. I frosted them with the buttercream recipe from Wiltons and everyone loved them...it is a good cookie, just needs better instructions.

This is the best sugar cookie I have ever tasted.  Instead of using a cookie cutter, I use a cookie press and top some of the cookies with cream cheese cake frosting.  It's almost sinful.

These were okay.  Too thin, and they were very crunchy.  Too thick, and they barely cooked through.  I liked the taste, but they definitely needed a bit of tweaking to come out perfect.  I dont think I will try this one again because it was too time consuming.

I LOVE this cookie!  It's the one I've been looking for.  I made it exactly by the recipe, except that I rolled it 1/4 inch thick. I divided the dough into fourths for chilling, and was able to roll it within two hours. The cut-outs held their shape nicely.  The flavor and texture are perfect!

I like them plain, but kids prefer them iced.  So, I made a simple icing with a touch of almond extract.  YUM!

These are delicious!!! Biggest tip is I kept the dough in the freezer while I was flattening cookies and using heart shaped cookie cutter, only taking out a handful at a time. Dough gets VERY sticky if not cold. I did not use a rolling pin... Much easier with my hands. Decorated them to look like "conversation hearts" and they were a huge success at my work party :)

The recipe is simple to follow.  I followed a number of tips from others who have made these.  Also, I iced them with a recipe that was quite easy, and looked nice and shiny.  As for the cookies, they were missing something.  I didn't miss putting anything in, but they simply tasted like cooked flour.  They were not dry, they had no taste at all!  My husband and I both agreed it was like eating moist, cooked flour!
I won't be trying these again.

The easiest and best tasting dough for my holiday cut outs. Just remember to refrigerate for the extended period of time. Then this will roll out like a dream!

Excellent recipe as written. I did follow the measure of ingredients, however, I did use a 3x2.5" egg shaped cutter for Easter cookies so I did a "test" cookie as always. I baked them at 350 F for 11 minutes on parchment paper in a gas oven and let them cool 2 minutes before transferring to a rack. I rolled out the dough between 2 sheets of parchment paper, (no flour needed), with "roller guides" under the parchment which allowed the cookies to be all exactly the same thickness. I used 2 pieces of flat wood molding, 18" long by .25" thick by 1.5" wide. I did chill the dough in between baking batches. I worked with 1/4 of the dough at a time and this recipe, using my cutter, yielded 25 cookies. Beautiful results. The next time I make them I may add some Cream Cheese Baker's Emulsion to intensify the cream cheese flavor. Truly as written, this proved to be an excellent cookie recipe.
Oh, I only chilled the dough for 3 hours. I did cream the butter, sugar then added the egg followed by the extracts and then of course the flour...Perfect!

This cookies disappear quickly so make two batches. I did make a few changes like increases the cream cheese to 8oz and rather than rolling out the dough I just dropped teaspoons onto a cookie sheet.

These have the best flavor of any sugar cookie I've tried. I followed the recipe exactly, including use of almond extract. I also used unsalted butter.

I've used this recipe for years now. It's amazing. Doesn't even need frosting, but is great with it too. Everyone asks for the recipe.
sometimes I'll switch the almond extract for lemon or orange with some zest also.

I used 4oz of cream cheese a whole egg and 1/2 cup or so of more flour.  Rolled the cookies on parchment paper  since the dough was so soft.   They turned out really tasty and tender, very yummy.

This is my go-to recipe whenever I make cut out sugar cookies.  The cream cheese gives the cookies the flavor we like.  I frost them using the recipe from the powdered sugar box.  I have gotten many a compliment whenever I bring them to a church function.  They do not last long.

These cookies were okay. They tasted a bit too much of flour. The only problem I had with them was they were WAY too sticky to roll out and cut out, even letting sit overnight in the fridge. So they were made into crinkles instead.

Ok at first I began to worry that these cookies would not turn out, then I read other reviews and decided to add more flour. Im not sure how much more I added somwhere between 1-2 cups and then I was able to roll them out. It was worth the effort my husband ate them all before i was able to frost them!

When I first tasted this cookie it was still warm and had almost zero flavor.  I was so disappointed.  However, after the cookies had completely cooled, the flavor increased greatly.

First let me note that I ran out of butter so about 1/3 of the butter was substituted with coconut oil.  And I only chilled the dough for an hour and it worked out fine.  Not to mention, I had to wrap a wine bottle in wax paper to use as a roller!    Now, my review: These are the best sugar cookies ever!  I don't even like sugar cookies.  I made them because we needed cookies for santa and I wanted cookies that I would not like so that I wouldn't live on cookies for the next week. And even though I hate sugar cookies, I can't stop eating these.  They are out of this world!!!

These were pretty good.  I was disappointed that the cream cheese flavor didn't shine through more.  I altered the recipe per the reviews in hopes that it would:  used 8 oz. cream cheese, 1 1/2 cups sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla, 3 1/2+ cups flour, and 1 tsp. baking powder.  I decreased the amount of almond extract because I think it can be a little overwhelming.  My boyfriend didn't like these at all.  He said they didn't taste anything like sugar cookies.

My boyfriend really liked these. I put a whole 8 oz. cream cheese in, and I'm glad I did; these would have been way too floury otherwise. I also did what the "Cream Cheese Christmas Cookie" recipe on this site suggests and made the dough into tubes, rolled them in red and green sugar crystals, then chilled and sliced. They come out looking very festive and bake to have sort of crispy sugar edges. I would add more vanilla and less almond extract next time, a little more salt and a little less flour. Maybe more sugar? I don't know, it was just missing something, but they were good overall.

i followed the recipe exactly, except for 1 tsp vanilla and no almond extract (i was out).  they turned out yummy.  i don't even like sugar cookies, but these i love.  they are sweet and vanilla-y with a hint of cream cheese.  they also rolled out very well.  i used cutters for the first roll out and then balled the scraps and pressed a pecan half into the middle.  YUM!  i wouldn't change a thing, just make sure you chill the dough, that's essential.

These are by far the best sugar cookies I have ever tried.  The cream cheese really adds something special!  To me, they taste like cupcakes with the consistency of shortbread.  SO delicious, and easy to make.  I always frost each cookie with a generous dollop of sugar cookie frosting, and decorate with sprinkles!  Yummy and fun.  My boyfriend, roommate, friends and parents all LOVED these!

Great sugar cookie recipe!  The dough was very easy to roll out and made great cut out cookies.  I did add about 1/2 cup more of flour, but other than that didn't change a thing.  Definitely chill the dough before rolling it out or it will be too sticky.  I rolled mine out on powdered sugar rather than flour to give it a sweeter taste.

If I could give the recipe less than one star I would.  I really wanted to make sugar cookies and decorate them with my fiance (she's not much of a cook, but she likes this kind of stuff).  I found this recipie and it looked delicious.  I followed it to a T and the dough (if you want to call it that) was stickier than glue.  I was so upset this morning when we could not make sugar cookies.  This is a terrible recipe!!

This yielded me a nice cookie and the dough was easy to work with but it did not come out very chewy, but light and crisp.  I think I'll try baking for just 6 minutes next time and maybe they'll be a little chewier.  Overall good flavor and the dough was easy to roll out and cut, but I had chilled it for several hours which appears to be the secret.

This is an easy recipe, and cookies are good.  I had no problem rolling it out and cutting the cookies--I floured my surface and patted flour on the dough.  I didn't chill it for 8 hours though, just maybe 1-2 hours-it gets pretty hard.  I wanted to do something fun with my 5 year old and this was a fun little project for her with cookie cutters and sprinkles.  To get 72 cookies though, you would have to have very small cookie cutters b/c we only got about 2 dozen cookies.  I did not think the cookies were 'to-die-for' good.  If I do it again, I will not add the almond extract as I think it is a little overpowering.  Maybe frosting them makes them way better, but that is more work than I want to get into.

My boyfriend loved these cookies!  I just made them for Valentine's Day and will definitely use this recipe again.  I rolled the dough out on my silpat after a couple of failed attempts of rolling out very chilled dough on my granite counter top.  I hope that this tip helps!  I topped them using the sugar cookie icing recipe and loved that as well.

Oh, woooooow. These cookies are so good... they're cakey and soft, but they're very rich-cakey, if that makes sense. I can't tell you how much I loved these cookies! I didn't roll them out, just scooped out spoonfulls and baked them as drop cookies. I'd recommend rolling and cutting them if you plan to give them away because the drop cookies were pretty ugly. :-) But they taste just fabulous. Thanks so much!!

Yummie, I was craving for a good sugar cookie and when I found that these had cream cheese in it I decided to make it. I didn't refrigerate the dough but just pressed it into my cookie press and baked the shaped dough. Turned out perfect, crunchy on the outside and chewie on inside. I used 3oz as opposed to the 8oz of cream cheese other reviewers suggested and I felt the cookies were very flavourful.

if i could give this recipe ten stars, i would. these cookies turned out simply spectacular !!  yes.. the dough will be a bit "wet" and sticky...but overnight in the fridge will do the trick and don't be afraid to use quite a bit of flour.... dust off the  excess flour from the bottoms before you place them on your cookie sheet.  i used a bit of lemon extract ( we like lemony cookies ),rolled them maybe a quarter inch, watched them closely so the edges didn't brown, lightly frosted... holy cow !! i had to fight my family off to not eat them before dinner !!! even after 4 days the few i was able to hide were still as soft and flavorful as the first day. excellent recipe... will never use another !! thanks !

I just can't say how thrilled I am with these cookies. I had zero trouble rolling them out even though I cheated and instead of refrigerating overnight, I stuck the dough in the freezer for an HOUR, maybe that's the trick haha. The flavor is sooo rich you will need milk with them. By the way, I used fat free cream cheese and still perfect results!

This cookie tasted yummie! BUT... the dough was very hard to work with, even though I had chilled it for about 24 hrs. I could not roll it out, no matter what. So I rolled it into a log, popped it in the freezer and cut the cookies out once it was hard enough. Will definitely make again though!

Just made some this morning! These retain their shape real well and are quite tasty. I would just advise to either cut them a tad thicker that 1/8" or bake them only 7 minutes, or maybe turn the oven down a bit as mine browned too much on the edges at 8 minutes, 375 degrees, and 1/8" thick. Nice recipe and will bake them again for sure!

These cookies are fantastic. After the dough is chilled it rolls out beautifully. I used powdered sugar to roll it out. The dough holds it shape when baked. It is good for detailed cookie cutters and was easy for my kids to use.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a nice sugar cookie for Christmas cookie decorating with my stepdaughter. Whipped it up in the food processor in the morning, and we baked in the evening after dinner.  We did roll them a little thicker than 1/8", on the advice of other reviewers, causing us to have to bake them about 5 minutes longer.  Used the "sugar cookie icing" recipe from this website.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Karin!

I made only half of this recipe and it turned out pretty stiff after I left it overnight.  It was probably too much egg!  So, I didn't make any lovely shapes out of them, I just rolled them and flattened them.  They turned out beautifully.  Coming out of the oven, they were puffy and a little chewy and absolutely delicious.  Half of the recipe made 2 dozen cookies of this size.  Enjoy :)

This was my first time making a cream cheese roll outs because I have a favorite sugar cookie recipes that I use every Christmas, but this was fantastic. I didn't have a chance to decorate them before they were all eaten!! I only made half of the cut outs thus far but I am looking forward to the next batch!! Defenitely a keeper

I too followed the directions completely and these turned out great!!!  They roll out great and I used coloured sugar to make them look pretty.  I like the fact that they are not too sweet.  You can definitely taste the cream cheese.  These will be a staple in my home from now on.  Beware - only make these if you can hold off on tasting the cookies since you have to let the dough sit overnight in the fridge.  That's the killer.  I hate waiting, but it's worth it. :)

Very good taste but a bit on the heavy side for a sugar cookie.    Followed someone's suggestion to use 2 1/4 "packed" cups of flour to make the dough a little easier to work with and had very good results.  No icing needed to make these cookies taste good - my 2 yr old had a blast brushing them with egg white and pouring on the sprinkles and red-hot candies (we made them for Valentines Day).

This is the only recipe I use for cutout sugar cookies anymore!  Everyone loves them and can't figure out what the unusual ingredients are.  I use "sugar cookie icing" with powdered sugar, milk, corn syrup, and almond extract to create the most beautiful holiday cookies ever.

This dough is a little tricky to work with, but as stated in the recipe you just need to keep it chilled.  The extra effort is worthwhile because this is one tasty sugar cookie!  Some sugar cookies are pretty, but taste like playdough.  This one is rich  and yummy.

I literally make these every year. They are PERFECTION. This recipe is it for me, cookie wise. Like other reviews say, DOUBLE the cream cheese though or else they will not have flavor. You do that and they are some of the best cookies I’ve ever had

I've also never chilled the dough. I just drop them on the cookie sheet and bake. I've also never used the almond extract because the first time I made them I didn't have any and the result were so spot on I never felt like I needed to add it.   I also double the amount of cream cheese usually. The melt in your mouth texture and the flavors are just 100% spot on in this amazing cookie.

They're really good, everyone loved them. I made a cream cheese frosting that I found on the food network website, but I cut the recipe in half. I used 1 cup confectioners sugar, 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract, 2 ounces of softened butter, and 2 ounces of cream cheese. Really good.

Found the dough tough to roll, had to soften it first....it was very crumbly and not much flavour. Followed recipe exactly, don't know what went wrong.

Made Xmas 2014.  PLAN AHEAD.  Need to refrigerate dough.  Need to bake cookies, (I rolled cookies in balls, then flattened with the bottom of a glass dipped in flour).  Cool cookies.  Then frost... frosting needs time to set before packaging.

I just made this recipe for my Holiday party tomorrow.  As I didn't have the recommended 8 hours to spare to chill the dough I ended up freezing the dough for an hour and then breaking the hardened dough into sections and rolling it out on wax paper sprinkled with powdered sugar and flour.  Success!!  I have always struggled with sugar cookies but this recipe was so easy to roll out and pop in the oven. I followed the recipe very closely. In terms of flavor and texture the cookies were very good - not as sweet as a pure sugar cookie due to the slightly tangy bite of the cream cheese (hence the name) and a little more crumbly/soft.  I will be making these cookies again!

Best cookie ever..I how ever tripled the recipe since i needed alot. The difference i did was that i used 2 8oz cream cheeses for the triple. I put in frig over nite and the batter was really hard that i had to really work the dough. Best part was that it stayed very cold the whole time so i never had to break it down and put in sections in the frig. I did have to use more flour to cover the countertop and make it a little drier for the roller pin. But boy oh boy, definately one of the best flavored and crunchy edges ever!! The cookie was fluffy yet heavy. I make a Kolachy with the cream cheese and this reminded me of those also. Im sure these wont last long in my house!!

I made these for a birthday party,they were a huge hit! I didn't even get to try any. People are asking for the recipe,and I did make a few changes as other's had suggested,I also added lemon extract instead of almond extract,and after chilling the dough overnight,they cut out beautifully,and baked perfectly,nice and light in color,my cookie dough yielded about 50 cookies,but they were a little thicker than suggested. A good recipe for my first time doing cutouts!

I used 8 oz. cream cheese, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp almond extract, 1 egg, 1 tsp baking powder, 1 cup salted butter, 3 1/2 cups flour (ran out of regular flour so 1 1/2 cups of the flour were whole wheat flour)

They turned out awesome!  I rolled out the dough immediately in between parchment paper, left it in the freezer for 15 minutes and then cut out the shapes and placed them back on parchment paper.  It took about 10/12 minutes in the over for how thick they were.

These were delicious. I put them in the fridge overnight and was glad I did because they were sure hard to roll. The trick was to roll them really quickly because as soon as I did that it was easy to roll, use the cookie cutters, and put them on the cookie sheet. My family was overwhelmed by their yumminess!

I chilled the dough for 24 hours and had no problems rolling the dough. It did get soft once handled but I added more flour and a bit of egg white and chilled it a bit longer and it was fine.

I am a very busy baker at home ..I made these cookies twice and I think they are lacking in flavor as many reviewers have mentioned on here .....They also lack in color and texture ....These are like a sweet biscuit even when you cut down on the flour....and add more extract....These are the type of sugar cookie that was made in the Depression era..Not a modern day sugar cookie busting with flavor...I have found a good sugar cookie recipe on here called The best rolled sugar cookie recipe..and it is the best I have found on here so far...very unhappy with this recipe..

What great tasting and beautiful cookies! I ended up using the whole brick of cream cheese as some suggested and followed up with the added remaining ingredients.  These baked flawlessly! I've never made such a perfect looking sugar cookie! Thanks!

These tasted good. they were nice and soft but tasted a bit bitter to me. I chilled it for 8 hrs and found it SOOO sticky. It wouldn't even roll. I had to majorly flour it and the rolling pin  then blow the flour off once the cutout was on the pan. I probably won't make them again.

I wasn't too sure if I liked these at first - but they really were delicious and pretty easy to make.  My daughter and my mother really enjoyed them.  The cookies stayed nice and soft.  Since they were not too sweet, they went well with frosting.  I will definitely be adding these to my holiday baking list.

These cookies were the best. I used half of the almond extract because of other reviews. I have no complaints and neither did family and friends. They tasted even better the next day. I used the Royal Icing II recipe to outline the cookies and the Sugar Cookie Glaze. Let them sit over night and they were divine!!!

Oh my god, these are the TASTIEST sugar cookies I have ever tried. And that's saying a lot. My mother and I used to make sugar cookies every year for Christmas, from all different recipes, but they were never really "special." These are special and then some! I'm sending the recipe (updated with another reviewer's suggestions, including 8oz of cream cheese instead of 3 - yum!) to my mother as a Christmas gift, along with some of the finished product. When not overbaked, these are the most tender, luxurious sugar cookie. The mouthfeel alone is incredible. Also, for those who found this recipe bland, I suggest upping the almond extract to 1 tsp. It makes a lot of difference. EDIT: Forgot to add, chilling them in the fridge may not work for some folks, like me, who hate sticky dough and the extra time and attention it can take. Freeze it. Honest to god, whether you roll it up in a cylinder or roll it out in sheets, toss it in the freezer and it's a dream to work with.

These are wonderful sugar cookies. I really don't like sugar cookies and I found these quit tasty! They are not overly sweet like many sugar cookies and the cream cheese gives them much more depth and flavor than the traditional sugar cookie. These also have a great texture; they are crispy on the bottom yet chewy. The other thing that makes these cookies great is you can use a sweet frosting without the cookie becoming overly sweet. These cookies are versatile too; you can add food coloring for color and they would still look great. Next time I will try adding a drop of extract- maybe orange or peppermint.

These cookies are the best and a great alternative to more traditional sugar cookies. I dipped the bottom of a glass in water then sugar to flatten them. The tiny bit of sugar on the top makes a great cookie even better. I also added this batter to pumpkin ice cream... yum!

This was a great recipe for the taste. The cookies were crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. My husband and daughter loved them. The only complaint I have is that they were almost impossible to make into shapes with our cookie cutters because the dough kept sticking to everything and we had even chilled the dough overnight. I probably should have added extra flour as the previous reviews recommended.

These are the easiest sugar cookies I've ever made. I tend to struggle with the dough of sugar cookies, and then I burn them, but this recipe's dough is so workable. Especially if you let it sit in the refrigerator overnight like suggested. You can roll them and use cut outs, or you can press them. I'm sure you could use molds for it also. I could get very creative with these cookies. Thank you so much for sharing!

Followed recipe exactly as written.  They turned out great.  I froze 1/2 the dough for later & they turned out as well.  I was leary about a sugar cookie with cream cheese but I couldn't really taste the cream cheese ... they tasted just like sugar cookies from my childhood.  Will definitely make again!

These are the best sugar cookies ever !
I made the dough a day ahead of my marathon cookie baking day to save the refrigeration time. I just wrapped the dough in a ziploc bag.
If you need to chill the dough in a hurry, just stick it in the freezer, it works great as well!
We all loved this recipe !!!

I loved these cookies.  I can't get enough of bakery sugar cookies.  These were right up there in taste and appearance.  I received many compliments.  I have tried to bake cut outs in the past and they always turned out wrong.  I was so proud of these cookies.  I kept them thick and baked for the full time.  I used the sugar cookie frosting submitted by Kathy Brandt on this site.  I will definately be making these again.

These were pretty good.  I really like the cream cheese flavor.  Mine was not doughy enough to roll out, so I did the normal sugar cookie thing.  My mother and I think it might be due to the fact that I used margarine instead of butter.  I'll try to use butter the next time.

These were pretty good, but not as good as I had hoped.  I had some cream cheese that needed to be used, so I thought I'd give them a shot.  The kids liked them, but I'll probabaly keep searching for that pefect sugar cookie.  I'm wanting one that stays soft and melts in your mouth while you eat it, and this just wasn't it.

These were just great!  The dough was absolutely delicious.  I couldnt stop sticking my finger in it to have a bite.  A lot of people have complained about the dough.  But all you need to do is flour your surface and rolling pin very well.  Thats a MUST for any type of dough because all dough is sticky!  If you do that you will not have any problems.  This was very easy to make.  And I have to say I was doubting it when I took them out of the oven and tried one.  It didnt have as much flavor, but then I tried them the next day and they completely tasted so much better!  They became very soft and moist, and the flavors came together nicely!  I used the Sugar Cookie Icing from the site.  DELICIOUS!

These came out great. However, I used an 8oz bar of cream cheese and the flavor of that still came out really light. All my friends loved this a lot, and they all kept asking for more. They preferred these over my Christmas gingerbread cookies. These were really a hit with everyone.
I didn't have almond extract, so I used a little bit more vanilla too. Also, I used the whole egg, not just the yolk.

Taste wise, these were the very best sugar cookies I have ever eaten.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 just because it was so difficult to work with.  It was really sticky.

A very tasteful cookie. As long as you put enough flour down to roll the dough on you won't have any problem with it being sticky. I would also keep in the oven a few more minutes to brown the cookies more. I don't make alot of sugar cookies, but this will definately be one I will make from now on.

Soooo yummy! I think I'll even use just a little more cream cheese the next time I make them so that the flavor comes through a bit more.  I made most of them as cut-out cookies.  However, for about 6 of them I added some Nestle Dark Chocolate/Raspberry swirled chips to them and they were SO good!  They tasted like little chocolate raspberry cheesecake cookies.  They were great plain or with some frosting as well.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!

I usually don't make a very good sugar cookie, but these came out perfect.  Easy to roll out and stay moist after baking.  I will always use this recipe.

These were really wonderful.  I used the changes that Cherish recommended.  I also divided/wrapped/froze the dough in 1/4's and had no problem rolling them out.  Very yummy!

I have been using this recipe for three Christmas's now... I'll never use anything else. I cut them on the thick side and bake them just a little bit longer. The tangy cream cheese is PERFECT.

I was looking for a great recipe to make cut out cookies for the holidays and this is it!  Most delicious sugar cookie I have ever tasted.  I followed the recipe exactly except I cut all ingredients in half to make a smaller batch.  They turned out moist, soft, tasty and easy to work with for frosting.  My husband (who is a very picky eater) even loved them.  (He doesn't like cream cheese so I didn't even tell him it was in there.) I put the dough in the fridge for 8 hours and it was so easy to work with. This recipe will be a favorite for years.  Thanks for sharing!

my sister's new favorite cookie.  i cheat, though.  instead of rolling out the dough or chilling and slicing it i just roll it into little balls, then flatten them evenly with my palm.  works well, but you have to be sure to take them out within 10min. so they don't burn.

This was a great sugar cookie recipe! The cookies were chewy and soft, even a few days after baking. I didn't find the dough too sticky...the trick is to follow the recipe and divide the dough into small amounts to roll out (the 1/3 suggested or even 1/4) so the dough can always be chilled when cutting out the shapes. I'll definitely make this recipe again!

We actually taste tested two different recipes to see which was the best.  This dough was pretty easy to work with once chilled (we only had to chill for about an hour) and we needed to chill it between each batch for it to roll well.  The flavor was good--next time I will use a little less almond extract than the recipe calls for.  This recipe was the winner in the taste test and we will use it again!

This recipe was AWESOME! The cream cheese made the cookies nice and most, which I personally love (I probably shouldn't admit this, but I did add more cream cheese then was required...very tasty!) One suggestion for others: the thicker the cookie the softer it was when it was baked...yummy!

These have a unique taste, if you like cream cheese you may like these. I thought they were pretty easy to cut out once the dough had chilled overnight, but I found they broke apart easy after cooking when I tried to decorate them, would not recommend for decorating!!

I had been looking for a great sugar cookie recipe, and my search is over.  These were the best I've had, and they had the perfect texture...soft but not too fragile.  The cream cheese adds a definite taste to the cookie, which to me was wonderful.

we thought that the recipe was great. It had simple ingrediants. The cookies kept their shape well (for cookie cutters), were soft and delicious. We had no problem rolling them out or cutting them with the average amount of flour. We did need to double the recipe to get an average amount of cookies because we made ours a little larger, so make sure you get lots of ingrediants if you want to make big cookies. With the larger cookies 7 minutes was perfect. Cookies were still soft the next day. A recipe that was enjoyed and will be used again :-)

I never thought I'd replace my grandmother's recipe, but this will do it! Soft, chewy and so good!  I just divided the dough in two, patted each half into a flat circle, then put the dough in the freezer for about an hour. I had no trouble rooling it out.  I made fairly thick Valentines cut-outs and only got about 2 1/2 dozen.  Delicious with powdered sugar frosting with a bit of almond added.

I absolutely loved this recipe. I have been "attempting" to prepare sugar cookies since I was a child. The dough always seemed to come out stiff and the cookies became hard, (like rocks)almost immediately. Now at 30 years old, I have arrived at the point where I can now prepare a delicious cookie that was generally seen as a #1 on the baking difficulty rating scale (w/#10, being the hardest). I have this mastered now and I can't thank you enough for breaking an almost three decade battle with sugar cookies!

For my oven 7 mins was too long. 5 mins was perfect. Also, they aren't too chewy unless you roll them out thicker. Very delicious with the cream cheese added!

These reviews are so irritating.. we just want to know how the original recipe turned out. You want to add your own variation,  create your own new recipe post. 


Anyway, I ignored all of the reviews and their variations and went with the original. Cookies turned out fabulous! I did make a royal icing to top them but they were good alone. Taste like a cheesecake in a cookie! Soft , and stayed soft the next day even leaving them sit on a plate overnight. Perfect recipe,  just what I was looking  for!

With a few changes (mentioned by so many in the reviews), these cookies were easy to make, easy to work with, and absolutely delicious! In addition to the changes recommended, I also swapped mascarpone for the cream cheese. What a Holiday treat!

Loved them! We can’t get enough:) soft , sweet enough and just right.  I used 3oz of cream cheese and they came out great, I’d like to clarify that amount as it says 1 package - I haven’t found a 3oz package of cream cheese yet, so tonight we will test it with 8oz of cream cheese.

I only rated 3 stars because of ALL of the adjustments needed. I read through the comments and others were right. The recipe is off. Making their adjustments & it is a WONDERFUL tasting cookie!!! 1 C real butter; 1 (8 oz) creme cheese block; 1+ 1/2 C sugar; 1 egg; 1 tsp vanilla; 1/2 tsp almond; 3+1/2 C flour; 1 tsp baking powder & I added 1/2 tsp salt (heightens ANY flavors added).  Tasted wonderful and easy to work with. Haven't baked them yet, so I'm hoping they hold their shape well.

This recipe is from the 1950s (?) Betty Crocker cookie cookbook that has been around for a long time. It never disappoints. I always get compliments on the cookies especially when I use a little more almond and and they roll out nice & thin .  They do cook better on the air-bake cookie sheets.

These were absolutely amazing!  The flavor was fabulous as was the texture.  And these things STAYED MOIST FOREVER.  No joke- I, in a moment of what I can only call an embarrassing moment of extreme weakness, came across two of these babies in a ziplock bag after coming back from vacation.  They were almost two weeks old and- no joke- soft as the day they were baked.  Definitely a keeper!

I tried it using the original recipe as written and found cookie nice & soft  but  agree that the cream cheese flavor  is drab with cookie an overwhelming  taste flour. I will try it again following tips others made.

This is a fantastic recipe, and will be my go-to sugar cookie.  I love the texture--just a little soft, but still holds up well after being cut into snowflakes and other shapes that break fairly easily.  I read the other reviews that said it lacked in flavor, and in turn doubled the amount of vanilla and almond extracts.  This was spot on; I ended up with a very flavorful cookie.  I also rolled the dough to 1/4" thickness rather than 1/8" and baked slightly longer since I like my cookies a little thicker.  They also did not spread very much while baking.

I've been making this recipe for years!   Like some others I use real unsalted butter, 8oz cream cheese, 3/4 tsp almond extract, 1 tsp real vanilla extract, 3 1/2 cups flour & 1 tsp baking powder.  I chill it overnight.  They are perfect!  The icing I use is 6 cups confectioners sugar, 1/4 c light corn syrup, 2 tsp almond extract & assorted gel food coloring.  I have 2 girls in their 20's & my youngest girl is 17 & they still can't wait to make these every Christmas!

They're almost a little more like shortbread than sugar cookies, using real butter and I used low fat cream cheese. Also, I had no almond extract, so I used maple (increased each to 1 tsp as another baker had done). It just gives them a nice mildly sweet cream-cheesy taste.
Keep them a little on the thick side - closer to 1/4" otherwise they're a little to crispy.  Great cookie recipe!

My go to recipe for cut out cookies. The almond flavor takes this cookie to another level. I love almond flavor and usually just eyeball it and give it a generous amount. I remove them from the oven just before they brown and the are soft and perfect. Everyone loves them.

OMG! My first time making these I expected this to be a horrible flop. I read other reviews and used real unsalted butter, and Philadelphia cream cheese. My two boys and I were making these cookies for Christmas baskets....well we only got two baskets made because we couldn't resist eating the rest. So tasty without icing. But even better with the icing made of powder sugar,milk and light syrup! Now I  need to go buy more butter to finish our baskets! This recipe is a keeper.

Awesome! I used the changes of another user, because I wanted more cream cheese and max flavor. "8oz. of cream cheese, not 3oz. 1 1/2 cup sugar, 1 cup of unsalted butter, 1 8oz cream cheese, 1 egg, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp almond extract, 3 1/2 cup flour and 1 tsp baking powder." 
I used the sugar cookie frosting recipe from this site, which also has almond extract in. It matched really well and looked beautiful. These were a big hit!

This cookie is fabulous!  Reminds me of an old Scandinavian butter cookie recipe I had for many years and somehow lost in one of our moves. The only issue, if it can be called that, is that the dough was very hard after removing from fridge. After a few minutes at room temp, it was fine.

Amazing! I followed the recommendations of using 8 oz of cream cheese from Cherish in the reviews. I made circles and after they cooled I dipped half of the cookie in chocolate and added fun holiday sprinkles. These cookies are not going to make it to Christmas because we are eating them all they are so good!

The pics looked so cute, but mine were meh.  The recipe was just too tricky for me.  I had refrigerated the dough for for a couple of days before I had a chance to bake it.  The used a melon scooper to portion out the dough.  The dough did not spread out like I expected, instead it remained basically a small ball, and it since it was flatter, the middle did not cook.  I continued cooking, lowering the heat...but this did not prevent the outside from being overdone and the middle remaining slightly raw.  For the second batch, I left the batter out a while longer and then formed the cookies, being sure to flatten it out with my palm.  This time, it was more difficult to work with the dough and it took a little longer than the directed baking time to reach golden brown.  These cookies burn easily too.  The back of my oven is hotter than the front, and though I rotated the pan, the last row of cookies were still browner and this occurred over a period of 2min.

This recipe is too fickle for me to repeat.  The taste was fine, though.  I would not do the drop method would these, and follow the submitter's directive to roll them out instead.

The cookies were mediocre.  The dough was too stiff to roll after the 8 hours of refrigerating, so I let it sit out for about half an hour or so.  Then, the dough kept sticking to the rolling pin & tearing, despite how much flour I used to avoid it.  The cookies started to burn after about 5 minutes, so for the next batch, I adjusted the temp to 350.  This helped, but in the end, once I finally got a decent batch, they were mediocre.  I love cream cheese, but maybe I'm just not a fan of sugar cookies.  I was hoping by the picture that an icing recipe was included, but since it wasn't, I made my own cream cheese/powdered sugar/vanilla/butter icing.  It definitely helped.

These are delicious!  I love the almond flavoring.  They are crisp and chewy simultaneously.  I washed the tops with egg white and put green sprinkles on them via a shamrock stencil for St. Patrick's Day.

I have tried these, and though I really liked them (and made them the way that was suggested with the added cream cheese and extra sugar) they are still not my favorite sugar cookie.  I have a recipe I like better, but this is a good trade off to mix it up once in a while.

Great recipe. Followed it exactly. Dough was delicate but with some tlc got the job done. Topped with royal icing flavored with blueberry extract and a PERFECT COMBINATION WAS BORN!

I thought these were good. Not too much different than regular sugar cookies, though. I had hoped for a richer less floury flavor.

Made these cookies with my 3yr old daughter and her 4yr friend and we all had a blast.  The only change I made was using fat free cream cheese cause that's what I had and the cookies where the best sugar cookies I have had!!  We also put cream cheese frosting on them which was good but maybe a bit much.  Gonna make again for Christmas!!

The ONLY change I made to this recipe was that I had no almond extract so I doubled the vanilla.  These cookies were delicious!  They tasted much better to me AFTER they cooled completely.  Also, they taste nothing like a sugar cookie but more like a cream cheese cookie.  If you dont love the taste of cream cheese - dont make this cookie.  I will definetly make these cookies over and over!

I agree with LHARNISH. Forget the chilling and use a cookie press.  It's faster and easier and the cookies are pretty even without decoration. After chilling, the dough came out of the fridge like a brick. Not bad to roll if you're a BODY BUILDER! The only thing I did differently was add the whole egg. These are very good and would make a wonderful addition to a Christmas cookie platter. Exactly 7 min. at 350°F was perfect. I thought they tasted dry and overcooked when any part except the very bottom of the cookie was golden brown.

I made these and I don't know where I went wrong but they do not taste good!! I used the extra cream cheese as suggested (about 6 oz, not the full 8) and added some extra vanilla extract but they just taste like pure, plain cream cheese! And not in a good sense... I dont know if I should add some brown sugar or something?? Any suggestions?

These cookies taste good, however, I found them rather crumbly; therefore I was unable to roll them out and use cookie cutters. (I let dough chill in fridge over night) I think perhaps the problem was the cream cheese, 3oz doesn't seem like enough; or maybe not enough wet ingredients.

I just made these for a cookie exchange and used princess bakery emulsion instead if the other flavoring.  I rolled them in colored sugar and pressed them with  a glass that had a snow flake pattern on the bottom.  They were wonderful and very tasty.

Good flavor, cookies did not rise up as much as I'd hoped.  Soft & tasty, but not very tall... a bit of a bother to have to use so quickly out of the fridge, especially with my four young kids trying to make their own cookies (playdough rollers are great for them, BTW).  Worked well for lollipop cookies we made by coloring with paste.  Will try again to see if they rise better.  Recipes with buttermilk give softer, lighter texture.

I wanted a more chewy sugar cookie as opposed to the thin crispy kind.  I made these cookies using another's suggestion.  I used 1 1/2 cups sugar, 8oz. cream cheese, 1 tsp. vanilla and 3 1/2 cups flour.  The cookies tasted very bland.  I did taste the cheese which made it a little rich, which I liked, but there was no other taste.  Adding more sugar would just seem pointless.  I would start with a whole different recipe.

We enjoyed the flavor and texture of this cookie a lot. The dough is a little sticky, but nothing that cannot be worked with after a) the recommended 8 hour refrigeration and b) extra sprinkles of flour. I've made this recipe a few times - once with the listed egg yoke, and afterwards with a powdered egg replacer. The egg replacer worked just fine for me in this recipe. Thanks so much!

These are the BEST sugar cookies I have ever had. I read other reviews about using real butter, and as a southern girl I am all about that. It made them so wonderful. The dough was a dream to work with after I chilled it over night. I was scared at first because it was sticky, but chilling it solved that problem. They are moist, flaky and hold shape incredibly well. I rolled mine to about 1/2 inch thickness because I don't like my cookies crisp. These were SOFT! They taste good just rolled in sugar, but I couldn't resist icing them with the sugar cookie glaze on this website. SO happy with them these are my new Christmas cookies. I am getting married in October and I am seriously considering creating cute cookie favors iced with our signature Tiffany Blue icing, like I created before. :)

These were pretty good, and perhaps it's unfair of me to only give 3 stars for personal preference, but I think that regular sugar cookies are a little better.

This cookie recipe is amazing. End of story. They're soft, they're sweet, and when complemented with a buttercream icing, I had people saying they were the best cookies ever (Including my district manager at work; work mates in general also loved this). I've made this for the past few Christmases now and it's always a hit! Thanks so much for this!

This recipe is awesome. Don't listen to all the nitpickers on here. I didn't have real butter - used becel olive oil margarine, I also didn't have vanilla or almond extracts, so I omitted them. I did add 1/2 tsp baking powder because I wanted them to have some levity. And I chilled the dough, wrapped in plastic, for 24hrs. They are to die for, as far as sugar cookies are concerned. The dough was excellent to deal with.

This is one of the few sugar cookies my kids liked even without frosting - very yummy!  Cut-outs didn't lose their shape, even though they did puff up a little more than other recipes. My only complaint is that the dough was stickier/ harder to work with than any others I've made.... maybe because I used extremely fresh butter from a local Amish farm. Either way, well worth a try. You'll love 'em.

These absolutely deserve a five at least for texture and mouthfeel of the cookie and the ease with which you can work with the dough. I didn't use these for rolled cookies, but will in the future! The dough is not sticky at all and very easily pliable. These cookies do not rise or spread at all, so what you put in the oven will be what you get out. The cookie turns out to be extremely soft, but not easily broken. The mouthfeel is incredible - these really melt in your mouth.   The reason for the four stars is that I was not very fond of the flavor. The main thing I could taste was the almond extract. I will scale this back to 1/4 or maybe 1/8 of a tsp, and I think that would help a lot. I began to get used to the flavor, but it is just too different for me. I can play with the flavor ingredients some, but the texture has really won me over!

These are the best!  I've made them at least 10 - 15 times and I have always received many compliments on them.  The last time I made them I made some modifications based on some prior reviews; used 8 oz. cream cheese, more flour, etc.  These were not as good as the original and didn't even have more cream cheese flavor.  They were more dry and the dough was harder to work with.  Just my experience. The only other modification that I make is occasionally substituting the almond extract either with more vanilla or with lemon or raspberry. Also I have tried baking them using several different baking sheets and using a (pizza) stone yields the best results.  They are cooked all the way through without the bottoms being browned.  I take them out as soon as I see the slightest golden color to the top or edges.

This is the best sugar cookie recipe I have ever made! I follow the recipe exactly as it is, and the cookies always turn out perfect. I usually chill my dough for 24 hours, which I would recommend. For the frosting, I use a white chocolate frosting from this site that I found on the "White Chocolate Cream Cake" recipe. With that frosting, these cookies are truly amazing!!

Generally, I dislike sugar cookies, but these were good. The dough was more difficult to work with than plain sugar cookies, but these taste better and I found the texture nicer too.

I was a bit disappointed with this recipe, was expecting so much! My kids worked on the cookies and the icing and were thrilled, but after tasting they said they were a bit bland and when cooled definitely nothing special. Sorry

I noticed when adding in my dry ingredients that this recipe does not call for any baking powder/soda.  I did not want flat cookies so I added in 1 tsp. of baking powder.  I like the simplicity of the instructions and the fact that you use only 1 bowl.  Many other reviewers mentioned increasing the amount of cream cheese which would really make this a completely different cookie.  Even with just 3 oz. it adds quite a bit of richness and softness to the dough.  The end result is quite soft so if you are using it for cutouts some shapes may have a tendency to break if you stack them.  The flavor is very good however but I think there are better, more sturdy sugar cookie recipes out there for cutouts.

OUTSTANDING!! These cookies are the best and so easy to make. I did not change a thing. These cookies are good with just a little sugar sprinkled on top before baking but I have iced them also. Truly a 5 star recipe!

I tried these as an alternative to butter cutouts. They came out wonderfully, and had a nice touch of creaminess about them that made them very interesting. I'll definitely make this recipe again. I didn't vary from the recipe at all, and only added a basic frosting to them.

Fabulous! I made these in the shape of pink ribbons for a Breast Cancer 3 day bake sale and they sold out FAST. Then people were coming back begging for the recipe! 
They are fragile, and you MUST let the dough chill!

I made these cookies for Christmas and they were a big hit with my family and coworkers. I froze the dough and I had no problems rolling the dough out with out sticking. I think next time I will not use 8 oz of cream cheese because my son didn't like the taste.  I use 2 teaspoons of sugar instead of the 1 tsp. I also used 1 tsp of almond and 1 and half vanilla.  Everyone thought I bought these cookies from the store.  Thank you for sharing this receipe.

This batter is delicious and so pretty and white. i used the modified recipe from one of the other reviewers. i really like the outcome of these cookies (so far) but the almond extract was a little strong, i will put less or none next time. these are definitely more delicious than plain old sugar cookies.

i also had no problems rolling out the dough, and i only refrigerated it for 2 hours. its a bit stickier than regular sugar cookie dough but still easy to work with.

will definitely make these again in place of plain old sugar cookies!

Good and easy recipe but extremely sticky dough... even after leaving the dough in the refrigerator overnight.  But, we decided to put the dough in a cookie press and they turned out fantastic!

I read the reviews and thought the people who rated it low maybe didn't know what they were talking about. turns out, they did.

This recipe is not a favorite by any means. The dough is terrible to work with, even chilling over night, the qty. was way, way off, and the flavor is not great either. I was so excited to try these with the cream cheese, not very good. Save yourself the headache and try a different recipe.

These were REALLY good. The only change I made was using 8oz of cream cheese and increasing the flour a bit. I used the Butter Icing for Sugar Cookies on this site to ice them. The cookies were soft and flavorful unlike some sugar cookie recipes that are dry and floury.

Turned out pretty goo, although next time I may try some of the alterations that other people suggested. I expected them to be significantly better than traditional sugar cookies, but they were pretty similar.

These were pretty good.  To me, they need icing, but my husband liked them without it.  I did not roll these because I was short on space.  Instead, I made balls and pressed with a colored sugar dipped glass.  Not very pretty, but tasty.

Better than usual sugar cookies! I used the recipe to make wedding favors. They didn't come out perfectly round, so I used a biscuit cutter to make them perfect. Then Iced them with the Sugar Cookie Icing from Janice Brubaker. Everyone loved them!

This is a great recipe! I added some more cream cheese (about 4 1/2 oz) for more flavor and it turned out great! The dough was sticky to work with but when chilled enough, the finished products were too good to be true!

Really good for making cutout cookies and taste pretty good. Only complaint is I changed the serving size to make only 30 cookies, but instead I only had dough for about 17 cookies.

This is an average recipe.  If you are looking for a good cookie recipe for perfect decorating cookies this is it.  The flavor of them just wasn't there for me.  I have a different sugar cookie recipe that I have always used and I'll be sticking with that one.

Good recipe. I followed the other suggestions and added an extra half cup of flour and found the dough surprisingly easy to work with. I also doubled the cream cheese for the extra flavor and found that the cookies came out well - not overly sweet, but still tasty. Thanks.

These were my favorite cookies this year!  Even though they ARE sugar cookies, they were not too sweet, and the cream cheese really adds the final touch.  They were easy to mix up, and I kept the dough over night in the fridge.  Here's a hint for handling the dough once ready to roll it out:  I found that when the dough was too cold, it was difficult to handle.  I also used a LOT of flour on the counter to roll it out on.  This is a must as otherwise, it's a real pain to try to scrape the cuo out shapes off the counter without mangling them.  The cookies were great.  A little brown on the edges, and for me, the thinner the better.  They were a little too soft for me though - anyone have any tips on how to make them crispier?

Great sugar cookies.  I added 1/2 cup extra sugar.  Make sure you flour your hands and the dough if you are rolling.  It is very sticky.  Keep the dough you are not working with in the fridge until you need it.  Take out of the oven when the bottoms start browning.  The top still looks a little uncooked - but finish cooking while they are cooling and make for a super soft cookie.

I followed the recipe exactly, and everyone said these were the best sugar cookies they have ever tasted. The only thing I didn't do is roll them out. Instead I rolled them into balls, pressed them down a tad with a glass and sprinkled them with red decorative sugar. These are the best!

I also followed the advice of the most helpful reviewers on here and in the product was delicious!  I stored them in an airtight container for about a week or so before now, and they still taste delicious.  Soft and full of cream cheese flavor.  I paired them with the Sugar Cooking Icing found on the site, as well, and the pairing was great.  I will definitely make these again.

I am giving this recipie 2 stars because although these cokies taste great, the dough was way too hard to work with, and I dont think the recipie actually make 72 cookies as stated. I tried to make these so I could give them out at christmas, but the cookies were way to crumbley and just fell apart! I will not use this recipie again.

Fabulous sugar cookies!  They were so easy and very easy to roll and cut.  I had no problem working with the dough.  The flavor was perfect and I followed the recipe exactly.  No need to change a thing.

I am reviewing the original recipe.  These cookies turned out beautifully.  I baked them at 350 for 7 min. and the bottoms turned golden brown, but the cookie itself stayed white and well baked without being brown on top or too crisp.  Made for a very tasty, soft and beautiful sugar cookie!  Will make again and again.

I was disappointed in this recipe because after so many reviews, it rated so high.  I made the dough as directed and found it easy to work with.  But at 375 degrees for 7 min, the smaller cookies were burnt.  I turned down the heat to 350 and baked them for 7 min and the edges were brown but the larger cookies were not done in the center.  Then once the cookies were baked (not burnt) you had to treat them very gingerly so they did not fall apart.  The only reason I am giving this 3 stars is the cookies do have very good taste.  But I will not make this recipe again.

I thought these cookies were very good.  I followed the recipie the way it was stated and they turned out very well.  That being said, I also made a batch of cookies using a mix from the store--I wanted to know if there was a difference in "real" home-made versus "semi-" homemade.  Turns out, my family couldn't tell the difference.  SO, I guess the bottom line is, if you want to go through the process of making and chilling the dough, this is a great recipie.  If you don't have the time for all of the steps to this process, pouches from the store are great too!

The flavor is wonderful! The dough can be a little soft, so flour your surface (they also work well as cookies without rolling), and they should be fine, but keep this in mind - you will have a very soft dough. Certainly LOVE the flavor and recommend.

I gave this recipe 5 stars for versatility and taste. The dough was a little sticky as some others said, but if you flour your suface, they should rool out well. My daughter didn't even want me to frost hers, she said they were good as is!

THIS RECIPE WAS GREAT.  I HOSTED A BRIDAL SHOWER AND MADE HEART SHAPED COOKIES USING THIS RECIPE AND THE COOKIES WERE ALL EATEN UP.  THE BATTER IS VERY STICKY EVEN AFTER I CHILLED IT FOR 12 HOURS.  I WILL BE USING THIS RECIPE AGAIN.

They were really nummy!! But they were also fragile. When I tryed to put the glaze on, a couple of the star points [[the shape]] broke off. I'll most likely make them again though. I'll change my rating if it's any different. THANK YOU!!

Yummy!  Great flavor.  The dough was very sticky - I did not even attempt to roll out the dough and use cookie cutters.  I just rolled them into balls then pressed the balls flat using the bottom of a cup coated in sugar and they had a nice round shape.  Great w/ cream cheese frosting!

I used these in a cookie press, and they were excellent with jam as shortbread thumbprint type cookies, but the plain ones were a little too bland for my taste.  I'll probably drizzle melted chocolate on the plain cookies.

i wasn't sure that i liked these at first; the cream cheese flavor is a different spin on sugar cookies. But i have definitely decided that with the right icing, these cookies are great. i refrigerated them overnite, rolled them very thick, baked them for 7-8 minutes, and then frosted them. they kept their shape while baking (as long as they didn't get too warm)and stayed chewy for several days. Thanks!

yummy! Followed the recipe exactly and they turned out well. I'm not a cookie expert, but, this one is easy to work with. Make sure you chill it overnight and cut the cookies thick enough -- if they are too thin they turn out dry.

This dough works beautifully in a cookie press.  I especially like to make flower or star shaped cookies and put a dab of cherry or strawberry preserves in the center.

Loved the way these cookies turned out, no puffing, so they stayed right on the sil-pat---cutout to oven, just like that.  They didn't stick too much, and I only let them chill about an hour after splitting them into (3) balls.  My only complaint was after doubling the recipe it only made about 48 snowflake cookies (3").

Great recipe!  Chilling the dough is a must!  I put it in the fridge overnight and cut the dough into 3 portions working with one portion at a time keeping the dough cold until the last minute.  The cookies turned out great!!!  DELICIOUS!!!

These are the best sugar cookies I have ever had!  Be sure to keep the dough cold while you are working with it because, as the other reviewers have noted, it is super-sticky.  Even the silcone-coated parchment paper didn't keep it from sticking!  I used powdered sugar instead of flour to work with it to keep it from getting too dry.

I just made these today and I am very pleased with them.  I do agree that the dough is a little sticky but I just used alot of flour for rolling.  I am not usually a fan of sugar cookies and I thought that these were very good.

YUM!  This is a great, slightly different tasting sugar cookie.  I thought the cream cheese taste was just right.  They were a bit tricky to roll out, but with plenty of flour for dusting, it was not a problem.  If I had to think of a complaint to make about these cookies it is only that the thickness that they were rolled out  was very important.  I got the first batch too thin and they got brown too fast.  I had to keep working on making sure they were all the same thickness, more so with any other roll out recipe, or they would not bake evenly.  For the special taste, they were worth the extra effort.  I will make these again!!

Really good, but hard to work with. I used 8oz of cream cheese instead of what the recipe called for as others had suggested. I let it chill overnight and then floured EVERYTHING before I started working with it. The dough got soft quickly so I'd cut a few cookies out and roll the rest of the dough back up, stick it in the freezer, and pull another ball out.

These were pretty standard to me. Even thought they taste good and were easy to handle the dough making cookie-cutter shapes, I'm still going to keep trying other recipes to find the "perfect" one.

The flavor and texture of these cookies is really delicious, better than most sugar cookies I've tried. I followed the recipe exactly and did refrigerate the dough overnight. When I rolled it out, it softened to room temperature too quickly and didn't hold the sharp edges of the cookie shapes as well as I would have liked. Still a pretty good recipe, though!

when i was making the dough, it was very soft and i thought it looked more like a drop cookie than one i was going to be able to roll. after chilling it did firm up quite well. i had to cook for a little bit longer than stated in the recipe. They didnt have much flavor, and i asnt overly impressed with the texture. they werent at all crunchy like a regular cokie or soft like "big fat chewy chocolate chip cookie" i did expect them to be one or the other. not really impressed with these, will keep looking. sorry x

I Hate making cookies.  This dough is so very easy to prepare. I also added grated orange peel just for heebie jeebies. Froze it for 3 hours.  I would definately recommend rolling it out in batches.  Just had the first batch come out and already ate 2!  YUM!

I made these at Christmas time, cut them out, and used red and green sprinkles on them. They were tasty, and cooked up nicely, but I had expected them to have more of a cream cheese flavour. They were sotra bland. Next time I might ad more almond extract, just for some more flavour. They looked really pretty though!

I liked these cookies and they came out beautifully, but they were more bland than I would have liked.  They just mostly tasted like flour and I had expected a richer taste to them.  I'll probably keep looking for another sugar cookie recipe.

I made two batches, one following the recipe and another using some of the variations by other people and both times they turned out horrible.  The dough was crumbly before I even put it in the fridge overnight. I added water but didn't help much. They didn't rise at all and they tasted like cardboard. I was very disappointed and it was a waste of my time.

I followed the recipe exactly to the exception of butter. I used margerine and I guess that is where I went wrong. The dough was impossible to cut shapes from. After 12 hours of being in the fridge I took it out and rolled it within a minute or two it was sticky and falling apart. They tasted okay, if I make them again this recipe is good for round cookies.

Okay...let me start by saying that this was incredibly easy dough to work with, practically fail proof.  HOWEVER, they were so dense and flat and tasted doughy even after 12 minutes of baking.  My oven temp is correct and I followed the recipe EXACTLY.  So, given the great reviews, I hate to post a bad one..but I will not be making these again.  If anyone has suggestions, I'd love to hear them!

Whoa... this has got to be the best cookies I've ever made!  The dough was easy to work with, as long as you put it in the freezer for about 2 - 3 hours or so.  That way, it's not sticky like they would be chilled in the fridge.  I made these for my tennis team the other day - they couldn't get enough of it!  Thanks!

These cookies are very yummy! Left out the almond essence and added 2 tsp vanilla instead. I used 5 oz of cream cheese yet I think the flavor is not strong enough... overall still it was sweet and delicious! Baked for 10 mins and they all turn out perfect!

These cookies are so moist and so delicious. I just loved them!!! I added little more cream cheese and butter flavoring to match the butter cream icing I used to decorate the flower cut-outs. Everyone just loved these cookies. I sure I'll use this recipe again.

They were a tiny bit too chewy for me, but I still really liked them. I topped them with a walnut piece, and since I didn't have vanilla or almond extract (really, I was just trying to use up some cream cheese)... I used mapeline instead. Still very good, almost maple bar-esque!

This is a great recipe! Many people have had problems with the dough but adding a little more flour(about 1/2 cup) makes it extremely easy to work with.I also omit the almond extract.The cookies are soft and chewy with a great taste.I have tried many recipes over the years  looking for an easy and good tasting recipe-I have finally found it.

Stayed soft for day.  These were good--bottom line.  You can kinda taste the sourness of the cream cheese, they were awesome--but not ideal for Christmas butter cookies.

I had a very hard time rolling this dough after it was chilled. VERY difficult, and didn't taste very well. Definitely not worth the time it took to prepare. These cookies ended up in the garbage at my house...

Finally a sugar cookie that's not hard as a rock after cooling. Cream Cheese added a nice twist. I found them very easy to roll straight out of the fridge and divided into thirds. But the dough gets very sticky the longer it stays at room temp.  My family loved them.

On the down side: I found the dough difficult to work with, and it was very tricky to manage it while being careful not to add too much flour as I was rolling it out. My first batch was tough because I added too much flour to keep it from sticking to everything. On the plus side: When I was careful to watch how much flour I added, the cookies turned out delicious, soft and tender, if fragile.  Kinda tricky, but still the best sugar cookies I've made so far.

Interesting recipe. I would not call this a sugar cookie. The resulting cookie is much more butter cookie than sugar cookie. Also, I measured very precisely and chilled overnight, but still found the dough very difficult to work with. On the up side, the one's that I rolled out too thin made an excellent crisp butter cookie that my husband really enjoyed.

This was a good recipe to make, especially around the holidays of course! It was simple, and I had all of the ingredients on hand, and always do. I love recipes where you don't have to run out to the store to get all of the ingredients. I like the cream cheese, because it made the recipe original. :-)

These were excellent!  I took them to a party and got rave reviews.  I found the dough/amount of flour needed to be similar to any other sugar cookie.  My oven tends to bake fast, so my first batch were too crispy at 7 min.  Cut it down to 5-1/2 min and it was perfect.  A definate keeper.  I used a family favorite for the frosting:  3 cups powdered sugar, 2 Tbsp melted butter, 1 tsp vanilla & milk as needed for consistancy- blend together & add food coloring if desired.

I found these disgusting. They tasted like Almond flavored Pay Dough.  I salvaged them by later cooking them more to be cripy, one person liked them and I sent the remaing home with her.  I used the idea of Leaf Cookies and devided the dough into three parts, used food coloring to make fall colors, and made Maple & Oak leaves with my cookie cutters.  I then sprinkeld the top with crystalized sugar.  They looked absolutely beatiful, so those of you who like the recipe give it a try.

I just made these in ghost and moon shapes for a Halloween party, and they were absolutely delicious! I didn't want to put them out because there weren't many and I wanted them for myself! I used mini chocolate chips for the eyes and glazed them with a simple vanilla glaze. I'm making them for Christmas too.  I kept the dough in the freezer between rollings and had no trouble with it. These are really worth trying!

I was making cookies for a kids halloween cookie decorating party and I wanted cookies that tasted good when I ran upon this recipe.  The dough didn't smell all that wondrous, so I was a bit worried, but when the cookies came out of the oven they were so incredibly yummy.  I had to hide the kids batch so they wouldn't get eaten! :)  Thank you for a wonderful recipe...I'm throwing out all my other sugar cookie recipes!

This was a very light cookie, easy to prepare and fast to bake.  I prefered to undercook it a bit to maintain the chewyness.  Next time I would add chopped almonds, pecans or macadamia nuts.  Just wonderful.

I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg and chilled 18 hrs.  Delightfully easy dough to work with
for this beginner baker who _hates_ rolling out dough.  Slightly richer taste
than most sugar cookies; colored sugar on top made them just sweet enough.
Definitely recommend.

This recipe was outstanding. My husband normally doesn't like sugar cookies, but he gobbled these up. I made my cookies a little thicker than the recipe called for, and they turned out soft, chewy, and delicious.

I love these.  They are a great combination of being soft and chewy, yet not so soft that they are difficult to roll out.  I chilled them overnight, and I had no problems.

I have been on the search for a chewy sugar cookie recipe for a long time. This is it!!! So many other sugar cookies lose their shape while baking, but these maintain their details while baking up fluffy and soft/chewy.  The thicker you roll them, the chewier they are.  Great recipe.

Everyone loved these cookies, but it is true that they are a
 bit hard to work with. I recommend only working with a small
 bit of dough at a time, like a hand full. Keep the rest of the
dough in the fridge until you are ready to use it. I also had to 
add flour to the cookies when I rolled them out, but I don't think
it affected the flavor enough to worry. A very yummy cookie!

I don't know what I did wrong - but I couldn't get it to roll out even after it chilled all night plus some, so I couldn't use the cookie cutters.  I just spoon dropped them on the pan and they tasted okay, but not great.

the dough tastes good after 8 hours of refrigeration, but even using a tad less flour it was too flaky and unable to stick together. A bust, had to toss it out.

These cookies turned out great. The only thing I added was the seeds of one vanilla bean to the creamed mixture...just to deepen the vanilla flavor, before I added the flour. otherwise I followed the recipe as is. They were yummy and I received great compliments. Next time, I would add some salt crystals to the cookies. I also cut these out directly on the baking mat, so that I didn't lose the flavor to the flour that is usually used to rollout and cut the cookies. Next time, I would replace the almond with lemon juice or more vanilla...but that's a personal preference - I just don't like almond extract. My in-law who is a good baker wanted the recipe and her son loved them.

This is the sugar cookie recipe I have used for years.  It's from an old Pillsbury baking book.  Probably because I'm so used to it, I don't think it's all that hard to work with.  A couple of tricks, as the dough is a bit soft, is to flour the rolling pin, and use a very thin spatula to get the cookies from the workspace to the baking sheet.  I always frost with cream cheese frosting.

These cookies are sensational. I made the recipe as is and cut it in coin shapes which I sprinkled with powdered sugar. The tangy cream cheese made this cookie unusual for a sugar cookie. I followed the suggestion of rolling it on a bench flour mix with sugar. I combined 50% sugar and 50% flour. It does make a difference. Also, my personal suggestion would be use a flexible bread maker's bench scraper to work it. It will be your BFF once you use it with dough that has the tendency to become sticky. They are inexpensive and save you a lot of tears of disappointment. A granite plaque also might help you as it tends to stay naturally cold making it easier to work sticky dough.

Tasty but do not hold their shape during the baking process plus you need to only roll to 1/4 inch not 1/8 - they completely lose their shape if only 1/8 inch thick.  Also 375 is too hot -  - the edges burn and the center is almost raw.  I am so disappointed - I spent too much time and money on these and now I have no sugar cookies for the kids.

Perfect sugar cookie recipe and really easy. I cut them a little thick, they retain their shape & size nicely. They don’t spread or puff up and sink. Taste delicious too! Will always use this recipe.

I think some of the confusion is because the recipe states "one 3 ounce package".  However, a typical package of cream cheese is 8 ounces.  So, which is it really from the original recipe writer......3 or 8 ounces?  At any rate, I'm not going to say what I did with the recipe.....any sugar cookie is going to taste better than stale fruitcake.  Happy holidays to all cookie makers the world over!  xoxoxoxo.

I followed the suggestions of another user by increasing the cream cheese to 8oz and sugar to 1 1/2 cups; they turned out wonderful! I chilled the dough for approx 2 hours; they rolled out beautifully and maintained their shape while baking. This is my new go-to recipe for cut-outs!

These aren’t bad, but I found them too salty—either that or you can really taste the baking powder/soda.  They did stay chewy and had a nice texture, though!

I love the suggested changes cookie. Things I would like to add to help an amatures like me. Mix 8oz cream cheese, 1 1/2 cups of sugar and 1 cup unsalted butter. Mix till properly creamed... the sugar becomes one with the butter. Then add 1 egg, 1 teaspoon vanilla and 1/2 tsp of almond extract mix again. Then add 3 1/2 cups of flour 1 tsp of baking powder. I also did a chocolate raspberry filling. Heat a 1/4 of whip cream to just a boil take off heat then add 3/4 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chip. Mix til smooth. Put in piping bag. Pipe an amount around the the edge of the cookie then fill the Center with 1/4 tsp of raspberry jam. Delicious!

I made these cookies and they were delicious!  I had dried blueberries I wanted to use so I added about a cup of them to these cookies.  I also added about a teaspoon of  fresh lemon zest.  They were soooo much better than plain sugar cookies.  I decorated them with royal icing.  For  strength, I made them 14 inch thick.  I use bands that are placed on the ends of the  rolling pin to ensure.  These bands are the key to getting a very professional look and uniform thickness.  Because of the thicker size, I cooked them until golden on the bottom, about 12 minutes.

I will definitely make this recipe again, but there were a few adjustments I made. First, I added more vanilla about a TBSP) and less almond extract, simply based on my flavor preference, and I also added about a 1/2 c more sugar and an extra ounce (about 4 oz total) of cream cheese after reading another review that the recipe was bland. I also did not add as much flour as it called for because I often find sugar cookies too dry. I mixed until the dough looked dry, not sticky,  but not overly floury. Finally, we did not use them for cutouts so I cannot attest to how they would work with cookie cutters. We rolled them into little balls and dipped them in different sprinkles, then baked. They were amazing! They are so soft and they have a wonderful flavor, sweet, but not too sweet, and the cream cheese adds a subtle richness to the overall taste. I will definitely make these again. Maybe next time I'll try them with cutouts, but I will likely need to use more flour for cutouts.

Outstanding recipe. Don't neglect the chilling step. I chill the dough wrapped in plastic wrap and pressed into a pancake shape because it's pretty hard to roll once its chilled. I like these cookies thick and with buttercream frosting.

I was surprised at how delicious these were! I love baking cookies but sugar cookies have always caused me stress because I couldn't get them right or find a recipe that was acceptable. I was skeptical about them at first because there are no leavening ingredients, but it turns out this is great because they hold their shape perfectly. I usually prefer a softer sugar cookie and was concerned about the 1/8" thickness but they were the perfect Christmas cookie texture (it turns out soft cookies probably weren't ideal anyway). The dough was such a beautiful consistency after rolling it out that I actually picked it up to show my mother. They cooked evenly, didn't spread, and didn't brown too quickly to catch. I gave it 4 stars because I did not follow the recipe perfectly and I think my decision to not do so was correct. I put a full tsp of vanilla extract instead of 1/2. The almond extract added a very nice and subtle flavor, but (in my opinion) it would have been too front-and-center if it had a 1:1 ratio with the vanilla, or worse yet the cookies would not be very flavorful. SAVING THIS RECIPE. THANK YOU FOR SHARING IT!

I used the suggestions that Cherish made and they are a wow!  I did roll some out, but then did the scoop and flatten on the cookie sheet when I got tired of doing the cutouts.  Used a royal icing which was super easy and dipped the cookies in the different colors that I made.  Great recipe.  Lost the first dozen to my husband.  Thanks so much for the recipe and suggestions.

Not my favourite. I thought I'd like this because of the good reviews and the fact that I love cheese, but it is very fiddly and sticky - even when it's cold. I found it much easier to work with at 1/4 in. instead of 1/8, and makes for a better icing cookie. I'll probably use another recipe next time.

They turned out wonderful, i did make changes as per another baker.  I added 1/2 cup more sugar and 8 oz cream cheese.  They are so much better than regular sugar cookies and they are great even with out the icing.  Love love them.

Great  recipe, not to sweet. I used the suggested changes of another user. I used 1 cup unsalted real butter, 8oz. of cream cheese, 1 1/2 cup sugar, 1 egg, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp almond extract, 3 1/2 cup flour and 1 tsp baking powder. Very easy to work with and tasted great!  Also separate dough into six flattened sections and wrapped in plastic wrap to refrigerate.  I used a 50/50 mix of powdered sugar and flour when rolling out.

I have been using this recipe for years, very soft and not too sweet...I make a cookie pizza using this recipe for the crust..just line a pizza pan with foil and put some baking spray on it and pat out the dough like a crust...some red royal icing for sauce, let dry..thensmear a little cream cheese icing here and there...cut out fruit leather for pepperoni, cut some gummies to look like green pepper,onion, etc...total sugar high, but the kids love it

I operated a cookie bakery for many years  This was my go to sugar cookie cut out recipe except I doubled the recipe and used a full 8 oz bar of cream cheese and always used butter no margarine.  I always got rave reviews on my cookies and even though I don't have my bakery anymore it is still my one and only recipe I use for sugar cut out cookies

This may be the first successful sugar cookie I have ever made. I have a new oven, so the bake time requires some work, but the cookie taste was wonderful. I didn't have almond, I just went with what I had. I never use anything but real butter. I made them in my food processor. It handled it just fine with just a litle prodding, but I would split the dough if I were to make a larger batch. I'm not a baker, so I followed the instructions mostly. I did roll, but will use parchment paper in the future, or flatten small scoops with a walnut or a fork. I love the idea that the dough can be frozen for later. I think I might keep these on hand. I almost grabbed a pre-made roll at the supermarket, but I followed through with my vow to work until I could make good cookies. I don't think I need to go any farther, but I have new confidence for trying out a few more baked goods recipes. I'm going to read over the comments when I do - they are all so helpful. Thanks to everyone.

With all of our changes - this is as an option - I used Lemon Extract for a fresh PoP of flavor to the Cream Cheese - worked very nicely! ALSO, divide into  3 - wrap & press into a thin "saucer" plate size portion & stick in the freezer - once firm - roll 1 at a time - delicious cookie without icing! (forgo the 8 hour chill time too!)

This is a terrific cookie! I used three different recipes during a recent baking-marathon, and this cookie had the best flavor and texture. It is a soft dough, so be sure to chill it for at least a few hours or overnight, roll small, chilly amounts of it with a dusting of flour and between parchment paper - and don't overwork it. The cookies baked nicely for me at 350* for 13-15 minutes - and were easily decorated with colored sugars, stiff buttercream frosting and/or royal icing.

I found this dough extremely difficult to work with.  I made the dough and chilled it, of course.  I divided it into small section thinking to keep the other sections chilled while I rolled out and cut the section i was working on.  I actually had to roll it out, chill it AGAIN, then cut it, then chill it again...it took me HOURS of work because I had to re-chill the dough in between each step for each cookie.  The flavor was pretty good, but not worth that Herculean amount of effort.  My house is warmish, but not a sauna!  It shouldn't have been that difficult to work with.

FANTASTIC cookies.  These are by far my new favorite sugar cookie.  They rolled out perfectly and taste delicious.  The almond and vanilla extract make them more of an "adult" tasting cookie (in my opinion).  I made all snowflakes and am going to try to make them look like the ones in the picture and give them out as hostess gifts. I will definitely use this recipe again.  I did make some MODIFICATIONS based on another review.  I used 8 ounces of cream cheese, 1 1/2 cup sugar,  1 cup of real, unsalted butter, 1 egg, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp almond extract, 3 1/2 cup flour and 1 tsp baking powder.  Thank you for sharing.

I love this recipe!! The only thing I did because I’m adventurous is I did half sugar and half brown sugar and did a full table spoon of almond extract. Other than that the only complaint I had was after letting it refrigerate it was a tad hard to roll out.

Cream Cheese Sugar Cookies
I think this recipe is great. I will say I find it best to divide the dough into four equal parts and wrap tightly with plastic wrap then let set in the fridge. I find the process of cutting, and decorating sugar cookies very time consuming, but I do enjoy it. The cookies have a very light flavor. If you are new at baking sugar cookies the first time it might be a trial and error experience like mine.?? I tried the bagged sugar cookie mix once. Yuck! Never again. This recipe is a keeper for me.

Made it exactly as is....perfect! Rolled them thicker and used cookie cutters. Brushed with egg whites and sprinkled with decorative sugar before baking.  They are not too sweet, great flavor--not your normal sugar cookie. Will definitely make again!!

Excellent cookie recipe, it was just what I was looking for. It makes soft cookies that aren't too sweet that melt in your mouth. I did change the recipe slightly. I double the recipe because I used 8 oz of cheese instead of 3 oz and I didn't put salt in the cookies. The dough I made was perfect after 8 hours in the fridge. I let the dough thaw a little so it was easier to roll out for about 30 minutes. The cookies cut-out nicely and didn't need to flour the rolling pin. I baked my cookies until I saw a golden edge appear in the oven around 8-9 minutes in the oven @ 375 degrees. All I have to say is I made over 30 cookies and they were mostly gone with a day and half. Definitely recommend this recipe to anyone.

Made these for church yesterday's and I'm not thrilled with the recipe. These had no flavor to them. If I ever make them again then I would add more extract and more sugar

I used the changes that others suggested:  8oz cream cheese,  1  1/2 cup  sugar, 3  1/4  cup flour, cup unsalted butter, omitted the almond extract and doubled the vanilla.  Oh, I meant to add in the baking powder and I forgot. I also didn't add salt.

Last  night, at around 7ish  I made the batter and I rolled out and baked the cookie at noon. The dough was very sticky after mixing it up, but  it was fine to roll out as long as it didn't get too warm; that when it got sticky  and I had to refrigerate it again.

I just used a cup to cut the cookie because I'm fancy like that.   I baked at 350 for  10 minutes or so.  I didn't really time it ,I just looked for the edges browning.   

They were very soft when I pulled them from the oven. I broke one in half and it was very crumbly.   I thought these were going to be very messy cookies because the other cookies I make don't do that even fresh from the oven.  But after letting them cool they actually hold together well.  I should say though I made them on thicker side.

The flavor out of the oven was one of those things that had me wondering if I liked them or not.   When they cooled and I tried another piece I decided I thought they were alright. 

I prefer the sugar cookies I usually make over these, but I do like the soft  texture.  Next time I make them I'll  play around a bit more with the recipe to see if I can  get it more suited to my taste buds.

Followed the recipe exactly and the dough was way too sticky. For rolling I tried parchment paper, wax paper and cling wrap. I ended up tossing the dough due to frustration of it sticking to everything, including my non stick rolling pin.

very good cookie.  Wll be a good alternative to my go to sugar cookie that my family loves.  I divided the dough into 2 sections, wrapped them and places it in the refrigerator overnight.  This morning it was tooo hard to roll. I had to let it sit out about 2 hours to soften up enough to roll and cut.  Otherwise very good cookie

These cookies were a hit,  absolutely delicious, I made a few adjustments, used 8oz of cream cheese,  1 whole egg and 3-4 cups of flour. They turned out thick and soft,  very cake like. Very pleased!

I made this dough a few days ago.  I wrapped it in plastic wrap.  Today I put the dough in the freezer, about 15 mins, and worked quickly with the dough split in fifths.  Baked 7-9 mins.  I like the dough a little thicker and they are sooooo soft!  new favorite recipe.

GLUTEN FREE: i used bobs red mill 1:1 gluten free flour and the edits the one user posted which called for adding baking soda and more cream cheese. Its AMAZING! They are soft and creamy and yummy! Perfect for decorating. I rarely review but I am keeping this recipe and am going to make it part of my family's christmas cookies.  I have been gluten free for 10 years now and am so happy I have this recipe.

I followed the recipe adjustment that Cherish left on her review. Cookies came out very tasty. I made them into thumbprint cookies and filled them with pie fillings. I made the thumbprint into the round shape and then refrigerated them for 15 minutes. Then, I filled them with the filling and again, chilled for 15 minutes. I cooked them per the recipe but mine took 11-12 minutes (because they were cold). They held their shape and were delicious. I will make these again.

I did not care for this recipe. They roll out beautiful, but the cream cheese takes away from the buttery goodness of the sugar cookie.

I went exactly by the recipe, left in the refrigerator over night.  When I got the cold dough from the refrigerator, I left it wrapped on the counter for about 30 minutes - then rolled out each ball, cut out the shapes, baked and they were very close to PERFECT!
I'm going to make again and use orange zest and orange flavorings and see how I like that.

1/8" is way too thin, it should be rolled out no less than 1/4". The flavor is lacking and just not happy with no thickness to the cookie.

Excellent recipe, although I did make a few changes:
added 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp baking soda, used unsalted butter, increase vanilla to 1tsp, used 1 whole egg, and increased flour to 3 cups. This is the best sugar cookie recipe I have ever tried. The texture and flavor is awesome! 

***  Used Ghirardelli White Chocolate Melting Wafers to "paint on" a thin coat of icing with a pastry brush and added a few sprinkles.

I've tried this recipe three times and the first time I followed the instructions exactly - I would rate that version 2 stars.  Too much flour and the taste was a bit "flat".  Second and third attempts at this recipe I added more cream cheese, a bit more almond and vanilla extract - that made it a 5 star recipe.  I also bake these in little heart shaped tins that I usually use for Valentine's Day.

Didn't really like the almond extract flavor. So we just eliminated it and added a little bit more vanilla extract. Worked out perfectly!!!

I modified this recipe slightly; I too used a whole block of cream cheese (8 oz). The cookie batter smelled sooo good. These cookies came out really nice. I chilled the dough overnight in the fridge. Definitely easier to handle when rolling out and cutting out shapes. The cookies were not as durable as some sugar cookies I've made (they would crumble if handled too much), but so much softer than regular sugar cookies.

These were great frosted.  Next time add baking soda and less almond extract.

This is a tender, moist cookie that will satisfy the most critical sweet tooth.  I first received this recipe years ago from a student named Karin, when I was the RN/school nurse in  the southern tier village in NY.  Sometimes I replace the almond extract with lemon or orange juice and a bit of zest from either.  "Cream Cheese Cookies ~ Karin's"

These were good sugar cookies. Using real butter makes them taste great. I also followed the advice of other reviewers and used 8 oz. cream cheese. They rolled out perfectly between parchment paper and were easy to work with, not crumbly.

I followed some reviewers' suggestions and upped the cream cheese to about 5 ounces and increased the flour by 1/4 cup. I also decreased the amount of almond extract ( I just don't like it) and increased the vanilla. I had no problems working with the dough and the cookies tasted awesome!! Unfortunately, half of the cookies fell apart as I was trying to remove them from the sheet, which is why I can only give it 3 stars. Not sure if I will be making these again. Maybe with the amount of cream cheese that the recipe actually calls for they would have been less moist and wouldn't have fallen apart. Very unfortunate, since the cookies do taste amazing!!

This is definitely a cookie made for frosting. Without frosting there would be no flavor at all. The dough was easy to work with. The shapes held well, but don't try to eat one plain - Even sugar sprinkles were not enough to bring this cookie to life. They need sweet frosting.

these cookies are ok. I had to turn the oven down to 325 because my first batch fried in under 6 min, that could also just be my oven though. the second batch wasn't bad. I'd add another package of cream cheese next time. The original recipe just tasted like flour cookies with a hint of cream cheese! I like my cookies FULL of flavor.

These turned out great, even with my tiny oven that has no temperature gauge!  I read a lot of the reviews and decided to use about 5 oz of cream cheese, and some extra flour--about another half cup.  I refrigerated the dough overnight, and I had no problems working with it—in fact I had to leave it out for awhile before I could start rolling it. I went a little crazy with flavoring the dough.  To one half I added the zest of 1 lemon and topped those cookies with minced crystallized ginger.  To the other half I added about 1/4 cup of cocoa powder and a little bit of instant coffee granules.  I even combined the scraps from the two flavors to make a few marble cookies...they were all delicious—not too sweet.  I made rabbit cookies for Easter and sent them to my boyfriend who was working out of town. He was beside himself!

I LOVED this recipe - very easy, full of flavor... I wrapped the dough in wax paper and placed in the fridge overnight and was able to even slice pieces off so I did not have to roll the dough out.. I got some green icing from the store to top them off - they were a hit!

I took the suggestion of another reviewer and used more cream cheese and flour and baking soda instead of salt. It turned out wonderful. I was searching for a recipe close to the bakery cookies and this one taste just like it. Everybody loves them. I made them for all the holiday and gathers. Nothing but compliments.

I give these cookies a four star rating because it was IMPOSSIBLE to roll and cut without a lot of sticking or too much flour on surface. I had to scratch the rolling/cutting and did a drop cookie. I did refrigerate for 9 hours. I also used full 8 oz. of cream cheese, a LITTLE bit of lemon zest and 1/8 c. extra sugar, and used vanilla instead. With all that said they came out FANTASTIC. Perfect sweetness, not very sweet like a regular sugar cookie. Texture was kind of like a cake.  Very moist and stayed that way, fresh tasting, for 4 days. I baked them until golden around edges and the middle looked under cooked, but it wasn't. I will absolutely make these again, my way.

Hands down the best sugar cookie recipe ever! It has so much flavor, it really doesn't even need the icing, although the Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting on this website is a great compliment for these delicious cookies! One thing I will say, though, is that they need to be cut thick - too thin and they get dried out quickly.

I did not think these had much flavor at all. These were nothing spectacular, just the usual, run-of-the-mill rolled sugar cookie that needs icing. Perhaps if a citrus extract were used, they would taste better. I would only make these for the holidays because they are fun to decorate, not because they are exceptional to eat.

YAY! What a great recipe. I used some suggested modifications (1 1/2 cup sugar, 9 ounces cream cheese, 3 1/2 cup flour) and they turned out super duper! My only complaint about these cookies is that they tasted so awesome that I ate too many while I was icing them and now I have a tummy ache :(

These are my favorite sugar cookies ever! I prefer to roll them out to about 1/4 inch, though. I also like to let each portion sit for a 1-2 minutes before I try to roll it, as it seems to make it less crumbly.

These were easy to make, I added extra almond extract for taste. They were difficult to roll out though...kind of sticky, we had to work in small batches. Also, I added some almond extract to the frosting I made as well

Sooo yummy and easy to make. My significant other was amazed at how they turned out, using just a few ingredients. I followed the advice of a fellow reviewer and used 8oz of cream cheese, used twice the amount of vanilla since I was out of almost extract, and used the whole egg instead of just the yolk. Yum!

These were really good.  I upped the cream cheese to 8oz, and added some additional flour as some other reviewers recommended.  Chilled dough for about an hour before rolling it out, and had no problem with it at all.  The taste was great, definitely not too sweet, but that may be from upping the cream cheese and flour.

These cookies are good.  Very rich, I did not decorate them.  I feel they are sweet enought without the extra sugar from the icing.  My 3 year old loved them.

These cookies were very easy to roll out and looked beautiful, but they just tasted ok.  The cream cheese really stood out quite a bit and you couldn't really taste anything else.  But it was nice working with the dough.

These cookies were awesome.  The only change I made was to cut them about 1/4 inch thick rather than 1/8 inch because I like thicker, softer cookies.  I iced them with a powdered sugar/milk icing.  My kids made these for Valentine's Day and cut the cookies in heart shapes.  We tinted the icing a pink color and then sprinkled with colored sprinkles.  They tasted so good and did not last very long past Valentine's Day!  Thanks!

Easy to make. However, dough was still sticky and soft after chilling overnight. Needed to add more flour to the dough. Tips: I used a mixture of flour and icing sugar when rolling out the dough so that the cookie won't be so floury and have a sweeter taste (since many of you said that the cookies aren't sweet enough). The taste is awesome! Will make this again with more flour added.

Excellent flavour, texture, just a perfect cookie. 

Tough to roll out straight from the fridge. Didn't notice a difference between the cookies where the dough stayed in the fridge or the dough that was warm from me working w/it. 

Next time I'm going to try using a glaze on top.

I don't know what I was expecting with this recipe, but I did not get it.  The dough was very difficult to work with and the cookies just didn't have the zip I thought they would have.  It wasn't a bad recipe, by any means, but it did fall flat of my expectations.

These were great sugar cookies!  I ended up just rolling the dough into balls and baked them that way.  They didn't spead out flat like most of the cookies that I bake.  I made a powdered sugar frosting to put on top which made them even better.  I will be making these again and again because my husband couldn't get enough of them.

A fine, tender sugar cookie recipe, although it did not blow me away. The dough was very soft, so refrigerating it overnight was essential.

I loved the taste of these.  I made very thin crispy ones, and thicker soft ones, that tasted even better days later.  I mixed flour and powdered sugar to roll the dough out on, and if I used enough, it wasn't any problem cutting things out.

Oh my gosh...these were sooo good!!! The rolled out so nice and made excellent cookies! I didn't roll them out as thin as suggested but more about a 1/4" so they wouldn't brown so fast and I didn't have to worry about breakage when my boys went to frost them.

The cream cheese keeps these cookies semi-soft and the almond extract adds great flavor.  Would like to try these with other flavorings (lemon?).  Very good recipe!

I tried to follow the recipe, but it didn't work for me. The almond was too over powering, and the dough was WAY too sticky to work with. I'll try again adding a whole egg, a 1/2 cup more  flour, and add 1 tsp pf vanilla istead of 1/2 tsp of almond. Also, I'm going to take the advice of the people that said to adjust the temp and cooking time. I'll try 325 degrees for 13 mins.

I followed the recipe, adding a little more flour. I would highly suggest cutting back on the salt and adding more sugar if you are not using icing. My 10 year old cousin complained that they were "salty." Also, I added a few dashes of cinnamon.

I followed the recipe exactly, and found the dough very easy to work with, as long as you follow the directions and make sure it's chilled. I thought the flavor was average, but my kids couldn't stop eating them.

These cookies are good....but the cream cheese you don't really taste to much and I also added more to the recipe.The dough taste like cheesecake but once its a cookie it just a sugar cookie.But I do like that these cookies don't taste sugary.
I had no problem rolling it out, I just put the dough in between 2 pieces of parchment paper and rolled.I don't like to use flour because it tends to change the taste of the cookie.This dough does need to be cooled though so just make sure that dough stays cold before rolling each time.
But other then this nice recipe.

This was a HUGE hit at our Christmas party.  I used very small cookie cutters to make bite sized cookies.  I followed the recipe and had no trouble working with the dough or anything.  Very tasty.  I used a popular sugar cookie icing recipe from this site and it was a great match.

These cookies are VERY tasty and stay moist. I have been looking for a recipe that truly gave you a soft cookie and this is it. I was concerned that there wasn't enough cream cheese, but the almond and vanilla really draw out the flavor. The only change I would make is that the dough truly needs more flour. I used an additional 1/2 c. just to make it manageable to roll out. This much did not compromise the taste at all.

I'm not a big sugar cookie fan but I really liked this recipe. I used 1 stick of butter instead of 2 to cut down on fat and they turned out really good. I will make again.

I didn't read the reviews before making these, wish I had so that I could make the proper adjustments. The dough was somewhat hard to work with, but just put in the fridge when it became too soft. That and I used alot of flour when rolling it out. The taste is ok - not the best. Not sure if I'll make this one again.

I made these for my daughter's Christmas Party today. I was very worried about the dough being too soft to work with after reading earlier comments. The dough did need to be refridgerated overnight, but when we did roll it out it wasn't really all that hard to work with. I just used a lot of flour and worked quickly, storing the extra dough in the fridge between cookies.

The cookies came out soft and tasty. I can taste the cream cheese flavor, but it isn't overpowering. They stayed soft even when left out for a few hours. I would recommend this recipe to anyone looking for a soft, tasty sugar cookie.

Very hard to roll out. The flavor of the dough was pretty good. I liked that it was not as sweet as a traditional sugar cookie. However, We had to put so much flour on the rolling mat, the cookies tasted tough and flavorless when they were baked.

I really am not enjoying these cookies that much. I didn't have that much difficulty working with the dough. Instead of putting it in the fridge overnight, I put it in the freezer for about an hour and had flour on hand for rolling it out. I didn't have icing, so maybe that would have added to the cookie. In my first batch, they were quite thin and very very bland. My second recipe I made them much thicker and they were still a little bland, but much better texture. I'm giving them 4 stars because my boyfriend loved them and I think decorated with icing they'll be better. Here's to hoping....

Good flavor. The dough was kind of hard to work with. Had to keep the dough I wasn't using in fridge to keep cold while making cookies to make it more workable.

THe flavor was good, but I had a terrible time rolling these out and cutting them with cookie cutters.  I ended up just rolling the dough into logs and slicing the cookies off.  Not totally impressed with this recipe.

I have had and made better sugar cookies.  The clencher for me was the smell while they were baking, I don't think it smelled very good, and usually I love the smell of baking cookies.  The taste was good though, not memorable.

I brought some to school and they were gone in a couple of minutes. I had to bring the recipe the very next day for several of my friends. GREAT change from the classic sugar cookie. I undercooked them a little so they wouldn't be hard.

excellent cookies! Refrigerating the dough is a must. I take out small amounts of dough as I roll it out so that the dough continuously stays cool. The taste and texture of the cookie is perfect. It's easy to frost and decorate these cookies after they've cooled. I will be making again.

I have mixed emotions about this recipe. 
Ok, I know you aren't supposed to eat things with raw eggs in them but this dough was absolutely delicious. I didn't like it quite as well once it was baked. 
To be fair, everyone else seemed to really like the cookies.

Nothing special about these.  Basically just pretty good sugar cookies.  I couldn't taste the cream cheese in it.  They definitely need sugar or something sweet on top. Worked well with a cookie press.

Very good! Loved the slightly chewy and tangy effect of the cream cheese. We didn't find the dough too difficult to work with, like most doughs, it took us some trial and error to get them to roll perfectly and tweak the baking time for the oven etc., but we didn't really see this as a drawback because it's what we were expecting. A great cookie for a 'baking day' with good friends.

I don't really care for sugar cookies, but the cream cheese makes for an different tasting cookie (in the good way!). Having never really rolled and cut cookies prior to this year I made sure the dough had plenty of time to chill (about 14hours).

Absolutely perfect for Christmas cookies.  Rolled out perfectly, baked up not too hard.  The cookie is not super sweet so you won't kill yourself once you get them iced.

My 8 year old helped roll them out and we had no problems with the dough!

These were great! The only (slight) complaint for me was that the dough was a bit of a pain to work with until I got used to the stickyness-- just use a LOT of flour on all rolling and cutting surfaces. The cookies were delicious plain, but for a little variation I put a little (about 1/4-1/2 tsp) seedless raspberry jam and a light sprinkling of plain old granulated white sugar on top of some of them before baking-- very pretty and yummy. This one's a keeper.

These cookies were very tasty! I enjoyed the cream cheese flavor. Every Christmas some friends and I get together to decorate cookies, and we bring the cookies already made with us. We had fun decorating these, and eating a few when we were done.  Everyone thought they were great.  Thanks for sharing!

These are super yummy.  They don't puff up, but they stay soft and chewy.  They are addicting! I followed the recipe exactly (just added an TBSP more of cream cheese) and they turned out wonderfully.  I am tempted to make another batch. These will be on my holiday baking list for years to come!

These were very tasty for a sugar cookie. And they were super easy to roll out. I followed the instruction to refrigerate, though I only did it for about 5-6 hours. It seems too hard to roll, just squeeze it a few times in your hands to soften it enough to roll. I found that even though they were thin, they didn't turn crispy. I didn't have almond extract and used maple flavoring instead, very tasty!I will definetely make these again. Thanks!

Delicious and very easy dough to work with.  Just pop it in the freezer a bit before using so it doesn't get too soft while you work with it.

Made these last year with no trouble at all! Followed the recipe and made the dough several days in advance, chilled until we were ready to use it. We love cream cheese and thought this was the best Christmas cookie we've made! Had to look up the recipe to use again this year.

Yum.  Very easy dough to work with and versatile.  I made them into thumbprints, made cutouts, and made drop cookies topped with sprinkles.

My son is allergic to milk and egg, so I am often looking for recipes I can make substitutes and still have the recipe taste great.  This is a keeper for us.  I used Tofutti cream cheese and left out the egg yolk with no problems.  Next time I will use 1/4 tsp almond extract and 3/4 tsp vanilla, since they were real sweet.  Thanks.

What a waste of time and money!  I wish I had read some of the suggestions about adding more flour because, even though I followed this recipe EXACTLY and even refridgerated a little longer than suggested, the dough was impossibly sticky.  I threw it away, along with the recipe.  What a waste!! Will NEVER make again.

I tried this recipe for the first time.  Had to use quite a lot of flour to open the dough although I chilled it overnight.  A little bit on the sweet side too, but the result was good.

These cookies were good.  My family loved them.  I think next time I make them I will add a little more cream cheese and not roll them as thin. Really good though.

WOW! This cookie is so good! Everyone loved them. I only had to chill the dough in the refrigerator for an hour and it was good to go. I used Halloween cookie cutters for these cookies. Great flavor. This is my new sugar cookie recipe. Thanks for sharing!!!!

Very tasty!  Most cookie recipes say to refridgerate for an hour, so I thought I could get away with it.  The dough was way too sticky so I made them the next day and let it sit overnight and it wasn't too bad.  You have to use lots of flour when rolling.  The cookies are amazing.  Plain sugar cookies are good, but get old after a while :)

This cookie was a smash hit at my family Christmas party!  Everyone that ate them loved them and wanted the recipe!  I only changed one thing, I left out the almond extract just because I don't like it. I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could!!

They turned out good and tasted like your average sugar cookie, but weren't anything special.  The recipe also only made 36 small, thin cookies, rather than 72 as the recipe says.  They were easy to make, and I would use the recipe again.

Very chewy and delicious.  I made these cookies for my child's teacher last year and it's now a standing request from her.  They were a big hit!

Despite the great reviews, these cookies were disappointing. I made them Christmas eve for Santa and the dough was very hard to work with - even after chilling all day. I ended up just rolling them into a ball. They turned out very heavy and too doughy tasting. Sorry.

I rolled the dough into balls and pressed slightly flat with a sugar dipped glass, this worked well. I really liked the mixture of almond and cream cheese, this is one I will definitely make again!

Best-tasting cut-out cookie I've ever made.  This is just the flavor, texture and sweetness I like.  Not too crisp, not to dry.  I use small amounts of flour during rolling and keep remainder refridgerated while not rolling. I've been testing cut-out recipes to find the one for me and this is it!!

I found these cookies to be neither chewy or soft, although they were good.  They are pretty rich and I find that I can't eat as many of these as I do other sugar cookies.

I don't know why the recipe says it makes 6 dozen cookies, because my batch just barely made 3 dozen, and I rolled it as thin as I could get away with. Still, even though the dough was rock hard when I took it out, the cookies came out tasting great!

I made these cookies for a cookie swap.  I am not really a fan of almond extract and could really taste it in this recipe.  I would make these agian, but leave out the almond extract.

I loved these cookies...they are so different from normal sugar cookies..they remind me a lot of the cookies i would get at a local bakery when i was growing up.  (I liked them more on the crunchy side, so i rolled them out thin and cooked them a little longer)

I refrigerated the dough overnight and still couldn't roll it out...it was just too sticky.  I wound up making dough balls and pressing them flat with a glass.  The resulting cookies were kind of tasteless.

I can already tell that I need to make a second batch of these cookies. They are truly fabulous, I chilled my dough for about 3 hours and I was able to work with it just fine.  The almond extract gives these cookies a great flavor, my husband made several trips to the cookie tin already.

This recipe was wonderful! They were the best sugar cookies I've ever had! They actually tasted almost like a butter cookie, plus they were very soft. I topped them with wipped frosting. They were a hit!

I thought this was a great cutout cookie recipe.  The cream cheese definitely sets it apart from other sugar cookie recipes I've tried.  I had no trouble handling the dough- just make sure your work surface and hands are well floured.

Really good-tasting sugar cookie.  I used this recipe to make Halloween cookies, and will use it again for my Christmas cookies.  Next time, though, I think I'll roll the dough out a little thicker because they weren't quite as soft and chewy as I was hoping for, but still very good.

I had a hard times with trying to cut these out.  But I have always had a hard time with sugar cookies.  So I rolled them into small balls and then into granulated sugar.  Put them on the cookie sheet and then cross marked them with a fork.  It took a lot of time but they were good.

I found the dough very sticky even after 24hours of refrigeration. I followed the recipe, not sure where I went wrong, I had to add a considerable amount of flour to get it to roll out for use with cookie cutters.
