Very yummy recipe!  It's a keeper.  Prepare the pudding mix according to package directions though before folding in the whip topping and sour cream.  The recipe didn't state that. I soaked my bananas in the pineapple juice, but didn't use the crushed pineapple in the trifle.  Instead, I just used fresh strawberries, fresh raspberries and blueberries, and the pineapple-soaked bananas.  Use whatever fruit is in season. Peaches would be great with this too. I garnished with the reserved berries and a light dusting of cocoa powder.  I used just one 9" angel food cake, but I suggest using 2 angel food cakes for more heartiness.  Also don't bother slicing the angel food cakes into layers. Just cut into cubes, or break off pieces of angel food cake, and layer it that way.  This dessert was fabulous! No leftovers.  The creamed filling/topping is simply delicious.  I suggest assembling and keeping the trifle in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours or more to let the flavors develop before serving.  The filling will seep into the layers of the fruits and meld with everything.  My husband showed off my creation to our guests, as I had served it in a trifle pedestal bowl.  It not only looked gorgeous, but it tasted just as awesome! P.S. You might end up with extra angel food cake (if you use 2 cakes to layer with), and unused filling. I highly suggest you make your own little trifle on the side w/the extras, to keep for yourself because your guests will eat up the main one :)

Very Good.  However, definitely make the pudding according to the package and then fold into cool whip & sour cream.  Otherwise, it is entirely too dry.

This turned out to be absolutely delicious.  I made a few mods.  1) I used chocolate angel food cake that I made from a recipe off this site.  I highly recommend this as an alternative to plain angel food. 2) As recommended by other reviewers I soaked my banana slices in pineappIe juice and prepared cheesecake pudding (excellent with the choco cake) before mixing it with the whipped cream (I basically just moistened it with heavy whipping cream and almond breeze milk b/c it's all that I had on hand.)  3.) I cubed the cake instead of slicing.  This made layering a little bit easier for me.  It was enormously well-received and furthermore, is a great base for experimentation.

I made this recipe for the first time for a dessert buffet for my child's junior high teachers.  I made it the night before and it turned out beautiful and delicious.  I used strawberries and blueberries for one fruit layer and the bananas and pineapple for the other.  I mixed the (vanilla) pudding with 1 cup of milk before blending with sour cream and whipped topping.  The texture was very creamy but not runny -- perfect.  I also soaked the bananas in the pineapple juice as recommended and squirted a little lemon juice into the juice for extra protection against browning.  Used "store-bought" angel cake.  It was simple and delicious.  I'm making it again soon for a picnic.

YUMMY! Like some other's suggested, we used the Cheesecake Pudding instead of vanilla. When preparing the pudding, I used 3/4 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of raspberry liqueur then added the sour cream and cool whip as instructed. WOW! Will be serving this at our annual holiday progressive dinner. After eating all day, you need a light dessert and this is perfect!

I took this trifle to my daughter's preschool for a Mother's Day party and everyone loved it!  Here's a tip for the bananas - don't throw out the pineapple juice.  Soak the sliced bananas in the juice (I left mine for an hour while I ran to school) and they won't turn brown.

I made this for Valentine's day and it was delicious! My boyfriend was totally impressed.

However, there is one caveat; be careful when you fold the pudding and sour cream into the whipped topping. Do not mix it excessively because it will get too liquidy and will drip on the sides . This happened to me the first time I made it and it ruined the beautifully layered look. So I immediately ran back to the store and made it again. I put the whipped topping/pudding mix into the frfeezer to chill for a few minutes so it wouldn' drip this time. It was well worth it though.

For those of you who made it for a party: how did you manage for the whipped topping to not melt in the sides?

This is a hit wherever I take it. I recommended mixing some milk with the pudding before adding the other ingredients to it. Also, saving the juice from the pineapple and soaking the bananas in it helps them from turning brown as quickly. I cubed the cake instead of slicing it into 3 pieces. Excellent summer recipe!

Question: by "pudding mix" do you mean to fold the powder into the creams or to make the pudding and then fold into the other creams? 

personally, i don't like angel cake much, so i used yellow-cake mix. i actually added milk to the pudding mix before folding it in, but still turned out yummy (if it is in fact the wrong way). also added lots of other fruits - mandarine orange slices (canned), blueberries, raspberries, peach slices (canned). Drizzled the cake layer with syrup from the mandarin oranges. No banana or pineapple. everyone loved it - as long as you decorate the top beautifully, it looks impressive and difficult :}

What a great cool summer dessert!  I was looking for something for just me and my husband, so I didn't make the whole trifle--I halfed the recipe and refrigerated what we didn't eat right away.  The whipped topping mixture is a delicious fruit dip for quick snacks throughout the day, and it's super-healthy if you make it like I did.  I used fat-free sour cream and fat-free Cool Whip, and it was heavenly!  Thanks, Joy!

This was amazing!! Thanks for the wonderful idea. I changed it a bit, for the pudding layer, I mixed 2 4oz jello cheesecake boxes, and I followed the box directions.  After I completed that, I also added about 1/2 an 8oz container of cool whip, and a little more than half of a 12oz container room temperature whipped Philadelphia cream cheese.  I just tasted it, if it needs more, just add it, ,then refrigerate for about 10 minutes or so till it thickens a bit. I layered it as follows, the bottom layer was sliced strawberries and whole blueberries, then I made yellow boxed cake (everyone loves yellow box cake) and  I let it cool and cut it up into small cubes and put it together almost like a puzzle in the trifle over the berries,on top of that I put banana slices that were soaked in pineapple juice along with fresh pineapple cut into small pieces, on top of the banana-pineapple layer I put the pudding mixture.  I repeat all layers one more time each, and on the final layer of pudding I put shredded coconut.  I usually make it the night before and store in refrigerator so the flavors mix well. This got rave reviews every time I made it.  Thanks Joy for the wonderful idea!!

UPDATED-
I have just just found an even easier way and still absolutely delicious, instead of jello use the Philadelphia ready made cheese cake filling.  It's easy and if possible even better than the pudding.  Who doesn't like cheesecake with fruits coconut and yellow cake.  The only thing i changed, was on

This was funny. I bought boxed angel food cake. A first for me (angel food cake, not boxed cake). Duncan Hines. The directions literally shout out at you from the box. Use a tube pan and DO NOT GREASE IT!!. okay. I think that's a bad idea but whatever. Then it says to beat it at medium speed for one minute. DO NOT OVERBEAT! alright already. Then it says, bake for 38-48 minutes. Hmm. That's a big window.  Followed by "DO NOT UNDERBAKE!" Say what? And stop shouting at me!! I'm not even going to go into the "hang pan upside down on heat-proof glass bottle until completely cool (like I have one of those hanging around!). What is that anyway? Anywho, after talking back to the box, I made the cake. It basically exploded out of my bundt pan but whatever. It was difficult to get out of the pan (shocker!) and let's just say thank goodness you can put this thing in pieces in the trifle bowl. And let me say, this was FANTASTIC! Funny how you never know. Did the red, white and blue thing for the fourth. BTW, bought an 8 oz tub of cool whip and it calls for 12 oz. Hubs ran to store got another tub. Frozen. So I put it in my microwave. And as I',m looking at it spinning in there, I think to myself, "um, this isn't a good idea. But I salvaged it. Thanks Joy!

I made this recipe for company. I followed the directions to the "T" and I have to say I was very disappointed. The pudding mixture was very dry and difficult to spread over the cake pieces. Next time I will definitely do one of two things. 1.)I may prepare the pudding according to package directions before combing it with the cool whip and sour cream. Or, 2.) I may drain the pineapple juice in with the dry pudding, cool whip, and sour cream. Another thing I would try is slicing your strawberried up beforehand, then sprinkle with sugar or Splenda, and allow them to juice up. The layers didn't meld together and was quite disappointing. This recipe has a great base....just needs to be tweeked a bit.

So freakin' YUMMY, people were literally licking their plates when I made this for Easter, one person even requested this for his birthday instead of cake! No lumps in the cream if you mix the pudding with 1/3 cup milk first, then fold in the sour cream until smooth, then fold in the whip cream last. I made my own whip cream with heavy cream, vanilla extract and powder sugar, and used instant vanilla pudding mix. Use any fruit you like, frozen or fresh, the greatness is really in the cream layer. And it will be much easier to layer if you cube whatever cake you use (I used pound cake for richness). Thank you so much for sharing!!

I have made this twice, once with pound cake and once with angel food cake.  I definetly suggest angel food cake. The pound cake was too mushy.  I made the pudding first as directed on the box as others suggested. And I also used cheesecake pudding.  Before putting the top layer of cream on, I let it sit over night because the desert sinks.

Great recipe for a basic trifle - any combination of fruits will work.  I served this at a summer cookout and it disappeared!  Everyone gave 5star reviews; but my own children were more honest:  they loved it, but all of them suggested that next time, I leave out the bananas.  The flavor is too overpowering and almost ruined the freshness of the summer berries.  I would suggest saving your bananas to use in making a banana trifle.

I made this on the weekend and everyone thought it was fabulous. Followed suggestions and used two  30 gr. boxes of instant f.f. white choc. pudding, whipped that with 3 cups cold milk then stirred in the sour cream. I whipped 2 cups whipping cream with 3 TB sugar and 1 tsp vanilla and gently folded that into pudding mix. I cut homemade angel food cake into cubes, placed in bowl for bottom layer and drizzled homemade raspberry liquor (recipe from this site) over each cake layer, (3), then covered with pudding mix and berries. I used raspberries, blueberries and sliced strawberries. Absolutely divine and it was my first trifle. The sour cream made it mouth watering, took the edge off the sweetness and was devoured. It's a keeper!

This is a very pretty and impressive dessert.  I added fresh blueberries for more color and I used the cheesecake pudding mix.  The only thing I would do differently next time is to add a little milk to the whipped topping mixture to make it a little creamier.  I also used chunk pineapple instead of the crushed to keep all the fruit the same bite sizes. Great summer dessert!

This was really really good.  I did make a few modifications as others suggested.  

I doubled the pudding, sour cream and whipped cream mixture.  I added 1 and a half cups of milk to the two boxes of pudding mix prior to adding to sour cream and whipped cream - it came out perfect.

I also cubed the angel food cake - it was just easier to layer but drizzled a little Jack Daniel's honey liqueur onto each layer - yum.  

I'm not a expert cook by any means, but this made me look like I was.  I will definitely make this again.

I made this Saturday night and let it sit in the fridge till sunday at lunch. it was pretty good. i had some left overs and i forgot about them until now (tuesday night). YUMMMMOOOO the flavors set in very well and the cake was very moist, which i loveeeee..
anyway, this is what i did to the recipe.
I misread it and accidentally combined undrained pineapple and the banana slices. I let those soak for an hour to prevent browning. I also used vanilla pudding and subbed cream cheese for sour cream. (and i added a little more cream cheese because it tasted too sweet for us) next time i think i will use cheesecake pudding and use sour cream. i also added a bit of raspberry extract. i don't know if that did much to it though.  :D In the end, I was a little disappointed because there wasn't enough pudding mix for three layers. Next time, I'll double the pudding mix to ensure that I have enough for 3 layers and to fill up my trifle bowl. but overall, i loved it! will definitely make this again.

oh and presentation is real nice. my husband took pictures of it and emailed them to his mom who lives across the country to show it off. made me feel like a pro! ;) thanks!

Highly successful dessert!  I prefer more pudding in triffle, so I used 2 packages of pudding mixed with 3 cups milk, 1 cup of source cream and about 2/3 of the whipped topping.  This allowed the top layer to be only whipped toppings.  Was afraid that some of guests might not enjoy all the types of fruit - since there were no leftovers, I guess it was not a problem!

Followed recipe exactly. (Okay...not exactly: I added 1 cup of milk to the pudding like others suggested, and I soaked the bananas in the pineapple juice.) But this dessert was great! Sweet, light, decadent. I usually don't consider it dessert until chocolate is involved, but I'll be whipping up this one again! :)

Wonderful dessert.  I had great raves.  After reading the other reviews I used the Cream cheese pudding mix added that to the sour cream and made fresh whip cream. I went easy on the sugar in the whip cream and added some vanilla.    I added the bananas to the pineapple which was great and used pound cake. I had fresh blueberries and added that also.  I would definately  do this again and try a different pudding mix.   A nice light dessert for summer.

I am a beginner and this was very easy to make.  It was a big hit when I made it.  No one could believe I made it.  I had to give the recipe to about 5 people.  I would recommend this recipe to everybody, beginners or experienced cooks.

This was awesome! I made a few changes in the topping-I doubled the pudding and added 16 oz of cool whip,but left the sour cream at 8 oz. I also made a yellow cake mix and left out the bananas. I brought this for thanksgiving and it was gone! My family could eat this everyday!

This was my first time making a trifle.  And MAN was it good!!!  I took it to a backyard BBQ and received lots of oohs and ahhs on apperance then HOLY COW IS THAT GOOD on taste.  I followed some of the suggestions like using cheesecake pudding which i added 1 c of milk to before folding into cool whip.  I also presoaked my bananas in the pinapple juice a splash of OJ and some lime juice. Just because i didnt have enough pinapple juice for all the bananas and its what i had on hand.  I received rave reviews and people asking for my secret recipe. Thanks Joy!

Wow. This was so easy and so delicious. I was concerned that the dish might be too "summery" for a winter dinner party, but everyone loved it, and I was shocked that there were no leftovers. It was a nice, light finish to the meal- I highly recommend.

I followed the recipe, the only thing I changed was the flavor of the pudding.  I really don't get why people thought it was neccasary to prepare the pudding before adding it to the cool whip.  I thought just adding the mix flavored the cool whip perfectly. I guess if you like more of a saucier trifle then prepare your pudding, if you like more of a cakier then don't.

FANTASTIC!!!  This recipe is wonderful.  I used white chocolate pudding mix (advised by another-thank you) and loved it.  My family are total fruitaholics so I added blueberries and mandarin oranges.  It was absolutely beautiful.  I can't wait to make this for the 4th of July.  The strawberries and blueberries will make a great presentation of red, white and blue.  I urge everyone to make this.  Trust me, you won't regret it.  It was easy and absolutely delicious.

I'd give this 4.5 stars and 5 stars to all the reviews that mention putting the bananas in the pineapple juice and the cheesecake pudding mix idea was perfect!  Next time, I'll try it with pineapple chunks since we tried the crushed and it was barely tasted.  Next time we'll omit the kiwi and use more strawberries as my husband doesn't particularly like kiwi.

Excellent.  I served this at a church function and it was devoured.  I did make some lighter modifications.  I used fat free/cholesterol free angel food, sugar free Jello pudding (blue box), light sour cream, and the light whipped topping.  I also added 1/2 c. 1% milk to the pudding mixture to make it a little thinner.  It was wonderful.  I'll definitely make it again.

This recipe is absolutely divine! The whipped topping mixture is so delicious! I will say that the one thing I will do when I make it again is completely drain the canned pineapple. I didn't do that and it made the trifle mushy... Another reason it was probably mushy was because I made it the night before I served it, so it sat in the fridge for too long. Also, the next time I make it, I will use other berries to make it an even more beautiful trifle. Joy...thank you so much for this phenomenal recipe. I wish I could upload the picture of my trifle so you could see!

This is a perfect summer dessert! I used raspberries, strawberries and blueberries, along with the bananas soaked in the pineapple juice. I used chunk pineapples and cut some of them up in the fruit layer. Used lite sour cream, lite cool whip and cheesecake pudding prepared with skim milk.
I mistakenly forgot the sour cream so the first 2 layers just had pudding and cool whip. I added the sour cream to the remaining cool whip and used that for the top layer. The sour cream cuts the usual cool whip taste and the combination tasted like real whipped cream. I'll make sure not to forget the sour cream the next time! In the future for recipes that call for cool whip, I'll be adding sour cream.

I made this as written, and I felt that it tasted like coolwhip and fruit. Maybe I'm just not a trifle fan, but no one at my dinner party raved like I thought they would based on the reviews here.

We normally only like trifle made with homemade custard (the British one) but have to admit this is very good and will be used as an alternative.  I agree that, if you can find it, white chocolate instant pudding is better.

This was absolutely delicious! However, I made several changes. I only used blueberries and strawberries for the fruit, since that's all I had on hand. I also substituted the cool whip for real whipped cream ( I just whipped up 12oz of whipping cream and added a 1/4 cup of sugar to it). I also added the zest of two lemons to the cream, and it was amazing! Thanks for a yummy and impressive recipe!

This make look like a fuss to make, it is NOT! It is such a beautiful dessert (especially at the holidays). It is so delicious and I think very easy to make. This is a hit! I prefer the angel food cake, but I think you could use pound cake if you don't like angel food. I make the pudding according to the directions on the box (I do NOT use it dry). You will be able to tell when something is too wet or too dry. Trust me, it is easy to make. I had not made this in awhile and decided to take it to a party. I read the directions and thought I don't remember making it that way, but I did what the directions said to do. DO NOT ADD THE PUDDING DRY AS DIRECTED IN THE RECIPE!!!! It was like rubber!  I had my husband run to the store and get more pudding and I made it with just pudding, YUMMY!

This was so good! I added layers of cheesecake flavored pudding as well. The different fruits gave it a great flavor, and the angel food cake was nice and lite to compliment the sour cream/whipped topping mixture. I will definitely make this again!

I made this today for a 4th of July bbq and the entire thing was gone in minutes.  I used a frozen pound cake, pineapple slices to line the glass bowl, soaked the bananas in pineapple juice (thanks for the tip!!), and added pressurized whipped cream to the finished product.  I added 1 cup of milk to the pudding mixture and I agree that the pudding part should be doubled.  tasted sooooooo good!!!!

This is a fantastic recipe to which I made a few changes. There is really little room for messing this up, its sooo easy and the results are simply delicious if you are a fruit lover. I started with cake at the bottom, drizzled the cake with the pineapple juice (from the canned pineapple chunks). I didnt add any sour cream but I did prepare the cheesecake pudding according to instructions and mixed it with the ripe banana and pineapple to form a custard layer. I then added the rest of the fruits (mandarin oranges,kiwi and strawberry), covered it with a lightly sweetened whipped topping layer and made another layer exactly the same way and completed it with whipped topping and garnished the top with strawberries, kiwi and mandarin oranges. A tip: Prepare this trifle at least 5/6 hours before you serve for all the flavors to blend together. Yummmmm!!!

This was pretty good, but I think I will stick to my original trifle recipe. I prefer a sponge cake with raspberry jam spread on it and sprinkled with sherry to the Angel food cake. Plus I found this recipe to be 'richer' tasting than I was looking for with the addition of whipped topping and sour cream. Overall, it tasted great and the fruit combinations were delicious.

Delicious! I don't really care for angel food cake so I substituted it for a boxed French Vanilla cake. For each layer, I put the cake on the bottom, followed by the fruit, then the pudding on top. I used the bananas and pineapples for the bottom layer of fruit, raspberries and blueberries for the middle layer of fruit, and strawberries and kiwis for the top layer of fruit. The bowl I used was larger than a regular trifle bowl, so I ran out of pudding after the first two layers. I didn't have any more sour cream, so for the top layer I mixed some cream cheese with cool whip and vanilla pudding. I sprinkled some more strawberries and kiwis on top along with some toasted almonds. I did the almonds over the stove top in butter, about five minutes until golden brown. Then put them on a paper towel to soak up the excess oil.  My family devoured this dish. Thanks for sharing!

Great.  I used omitted the strawberries because they were out of season, and just added more kiwi.  The bananas are clutch - don't omit them.  Very good..I used sliced canned pineapple, low fat vanilla pudding mix, and low fat frozen whipped topping.  Couldn't even tell - would make again.  June 3, 2009:  Second time around, just as good.  Easy and delicious.

I didn't use the cake part of this. I just wanted the fruit and pudding part. I STRONGLY suggest using 2 boxes of pudding. I first did one box and it tasted too much like cool whip. Also, i first mixed each box of pudding with one cup of milk before adding it to the sour cream/cool whip. I used pineapple, mandirane oranges, strawberries, blueberries and blackberries layered in individual wine glasses.

A Keeper! Everyone enjoyed this. *Two Tips: DO NOT prepare pudding; dry mix should be gradually sprinkled over the sour cream and topping and quickly mixed in before it clumps. THEN, the juice of an orange or two squeezed over the cake pieces is so, so wonderful.* I needed to increase this recipe for my giant (30 oz) angel cake from Sam's. So I used a punchbowl and cut the cake into 1/4's. It is fine to rip up the cake layers to fit the bowl. I increased the topping with 1/2 pint of whipping cream, whipped with one tsp. vanilla and 4 Tbsp. sugar. I then whipped in 1 1/2 cups of sour cream and the pudding powder, then folded in the whipped topping. (The kids were fighting to clean the beaters!) A 20-oz can of pineapple was perfect, drained lightly. Chopped kiwi is easier to eat, and I recommend soaking the bananas in pineapple juice. I also varied the layers (pineapple/banana, then kiwi/strawberry), but no doubt you could just toss all the ingredients in at random, slap on the cream, and it would taste just perfect! =)

Made this for big family Easter dinner and it was a HUGE hit!  My mom. who is a great cook, said it was the best thing she had ever put in her mouth!  I left out bananas, used the cheesecake flavored instant pudding per another reviewer, cut the angel food cake into large cubes, and added milk so the pudding would not be so stiff.  Please note, this is such a simple recipe that you can not mess it up!  If you want more fruit or any other ingredient, just add/increase to your personal taste.  INCREDIBLE!  Thanks, Joy!

This trifle is delicious. Since my family prefers lemony desserts, I used lemon pudding with 2t lemon juice added rather than the vanilla. I also cut the whipped topping to six ounces. Yummy! Thanks, Joy!

This was a great recipe. I used bisquick instead of angel food cake to make it a little more heavy and it tasted great. i'm sure it tastes great with angel food cake also. I'll definitely make this again.

Very light and easy to make.  I replaced the bananas and pineapple with blueberries and raspberries, and it was a hit!  People asked me for the recipe before they even tasted it.

What a beautiful and flavorful light dessert! I did take the advice of others and made the vanilla pudding mix into pudding with about 1 c of half and half mixed with 1 c  non-fat milk. (This was with the larger box of pudding mix, so I just used about 2/3 of the pudding.) I think once you get the consistency of the pudding the way you like it, the recipe is pretty foolproof, although I did follow the rest of her directions. I cut 3 horizontal pieces of the cake horizontally, but did score them into smaller pieces as I thought they might be easier to eat that way. Anyway, it was yummy and got rave reviews!

This was delicious!  I made it like recommended where you mixed the pudding with 1 cup of milk and soaked the bananas in leftover pineapple juice.  I also used lemon pudding with about 1 TBSP of key lime juice to give it a slight bit more zing. Wonderful!!!

Wow! This is a keeper...very attractive, colorful and easy to put together. A nice light fruity dessert and very filling I might add. I had tons of strawberries and blueberries and this happens to be in season so it was perfect. The only thing that took time which was not too long for me is that layering of the fruits, whipped topping and angel food cake. I also put it in the refrigerator to set for a few hours before eating. Next time I might try baking my own angel food cake from scratch and/or layering other kinds of other fruits. Yummy and pretty!

I soaked the bananas in the pineapple juice - worked perfectly. I also used only 8oz of cool whip and substituted in 4oz of vanilla yogurt to avoid the overpowering cool whip taste. Also added 20oz of pineapple instead of 15oz. And only used 1 kiwi and added 1 cup of blueberries. And used cream cheese pudding mix instead of vanilla - and prepared the pudding as per the package instructions prior to using. Too dry otherwise! Terrific recipe - everyone LOVED it!

Best dessert ever!  All of my friends just call it "Joy".  They say are you bringing Joy over?  Only changes I have made are using the fat free pudding mix and have also changed it for the french vanilla a few times.  I also use light sour cream just to make myself feel better for eating so much of it :)

Wonderful dessert! I was unsure of the sourcream but I'm glad I added it. It wasn't too sweet like a lot of trifles are, but just right. The cream mixture was a little too stiff and barely enough, so I added another half a container to the mix. Turned out perfect.  I used all the fruit in the recipe and added raspberries and blackberries. This is my go to trifle recipe from now on!

Great trifle.  By far my fave.  I use jelly rolls instead of angel food cake.  Easier to fit in a trifle dish.  Other suggestions I found were valuable - making the pudding according to the box before adding to sour cream and I also soaked all the cut fruits in pineapple juice prior to adding to the bowl but did not use the pineapple.

Everyone LOVED this dessert!!  The only things I did differently were that I used cream cheese instead of sour cream, french vanilla instead of vanilla pudding, and I added blueberries.  My family can't wait until I make it again!!

Excellent.  I did by the cook and serve vanilla pudding and made it and let it cool before folding in the sour cream and whipped cream.  I also soaked the sliced bananas in the pineapple juice.  I did not use the pineapple or kiwi, I used one container of fresh strawberries, one container of blueberries and one container of raspberries and then I used 3 bananas, soaked in pineapple juice.  It was excellent. Actually very light, everyone enjoyed it.

I cannot even recall how often I have made this recipe over the past few years.  I usually use cheesecake pudding, follow the banana slices in the pineapple juice idea, strawberries, blueberries, kiwi.   This is a hit everywhere, family parties, work parties, barbecues, graduations, soccer pool parties, etc.  I use chunks of the angel food cake, rather than sliced layers.

I made this to take to our neighbor's BBQ party and it was a hit!  I didn't have any kiwis so I omitted them.  I also did not use the pineapple.  Instead I soaked the banana slices in pineapple juice and  used the juice to moisten the cake.  In addition I added some blackberries and blueberries to mine.  Some other time I'll have to try this recipe again using the kiwis and pineapple to compare, but nonetheless it was well received and I did come home with an empty dish!  Thank you Joy! Update: I have since made this recipe many times and it is always requested for potlucks or special events at work or otherwise.  I have made it using pineapple and kiwi and also tried angel food cake and pound cake versions.  My favorite is to use a package of frozen mixed berries in addition to the fruit called in the recipe. I also like to change the pudding occasionally and use a can of condensed milk and add 1/2 cup of milk to the pudding mix for a more creamy/sweet version.

I made this for Easter dinner dessert - and EVERYONE loved it!  Just a few changes as others suggested.  I used FF Sour Cream & SF instant pudding -- to cut back a bit on fat & calories -- and it was still amazing!  Also added blueberries for additional color.  Good tip is to dip banana slices in the pineapple juice to preserve freshness.  LOVED IT!

This is the PERFECT dessert at the end of a big meal.  Very light and refreshing...and delicious, too!!  I left out the pineapple chunks and replaced them with blueberries to make the cake a little more colorful and decorative.  It turned out beautiful and tasted scrumptious!  My guests couldn't stop talking about it!

INCREDIBLE! I cannot begin to explain how wonderful this trifle is! Everyone raved, everyone, which is quite rare! I made it for Easter and now it's going to be a requested dessert. Besides all the chopping, it was a cinch to make. I did what other reviewers recommended by soaking the bananas in pineapple juice. I accidentally forgot to layer in the strawberries. When I was all through layering I noticed a bunch of sliced strawberry and was like, ught oh! lol.. No worries. I just made a pretty flower on top with the sliced strawberry's so everyone got some in every scoop. If you are "on the fence" about preparing this trifle I say just do it! You WILL NOT be disappointed :)

Hey guess what?!!! I made this recipe EXACTLY AS WRITTEN and can therefore justify the five star rating. Anyways....I mixed the dry pudding mix with the cool whip and sour cream and it was the most perfect thing ever, delicious. I had no issue with it being too thick at all. I think you need to let the cool whip thaw completely and use the right amount of sour cream and the correct sized box of pudding, I think that's the mistake people are making...let the cool whip THAW.

I admit, I didn't actually eat any of this since I am on a strict diet -- however, I made it for thanksgiving yesterday and the entire bowl was gone with people taking 2nd and 3rd helpings. I was asked many times for the recipe. I think the next time I make it though, I will chop up the angel food cake rather than slice it horizontally. As a hint, the longer it was in the refrigerator, the better it tasted. I guess it gave the ingredients times to meld together. Made before noon and served around 5pm. Definitely a keeper!

Since the first review in 2012, I have made this again, numerous times (and eaten my fair share). It is a wonderful and easy recipe - always a hit at the buffet table.

This is such a simple, yet delicious recipe.

Like most reviewers, I make the instant vanilla pudding according to the directions on the box, then fold it into the sour cream and whipped topping.

I find almost any fruits work with this recipe. Today I used bananas, blueberries, strawberries, and canned peach slices.

I also soak my banana slices in pineapple juice, but do not use pineapple.

Lastly, I pour quality Sherry onto the cake as I layer it.

The recipe is best made the day BEFORE serving as that gives it time for the flavours to come together and for the cake to soak up the sherry, fruit flavours, and the whipped topping.

I have made this several times now and believe this is a very solid triffle recipe. Lately I have been using real whipped cream instead of the coolwhip with even better results.

Delicious!!!  This dish doesn't leave leftovers--too good!  I followed the tips on soaking the bananas in the pineapple juice, and preparing the pudding mix.  Absolutely love it!

Love this! Made it for my in-laws huge gathering at Thanksgiving, it was impressive in flavor and appearance, and not so syrupy sweet as the other desserts. I'm allergic to pinapple so I layered Fredricksburg peaches I had frozen last summer and a frozen berry mix- blueberries, raspberries and blackberries. As the fruit melted, the juices soaked the angel food cake, oh, it was good! I love the whipped topping, I also use it on chocolate cake with a cherry pie filling topping.

This dish is beautiful and tasty.  I took it to a dinner party and everyone loved it.  I did use the cheesecake pudding instead of vanilla pudding, but followed the rest of the recipe as written.  Next time I'll probably play around with different fruits also.  Thanks for a great dessert!

I have made this recipe about 50 times and use it for just about every BBQ I go to in the summer. I think the best thing about this recipe is the ability to change it. Do not fear playing around with the ingredients and "making it your own" with such a solid start you can not go wrong.

My family just loved this recipe, the only change that I made was I made the pudding according to directions and used cream cheese instead of sour cream and blended it in. My wife said its the best desert she ever had. Thanks Joy

I made this for a work potluck. Was gone in minutes. I used 1.5 boxes of the pudding and mixed using pudding directions for one box. Consistency came out perfect with the sour cream and cool whip added. I did incorporate the pineapple and used the juice to soak the bananas in while I was getting everything else ready. Otherwise, I did the recipe as directed other than the pudding mixing with milk and using more to make the right consistency. I finished the top of by piping some of the left over cool whip to make a nice border around the bowl. Perfect combination of fruit!

Really nice to sit down to after a suuuper long day of cooking! I really enjoy how it wasn't overly sweet, and it had a nice, airy, fruity taste :) allll of the kids loved it. It was gone in under 2 minutes, and everybody said: "That was one of the best desserts I've ever had!!" My boyfriend chose French Vanilla pudding and we also prepared it before folding it in, which I would highly recommend. Thank youuu, Ms. Joy :)

It was a HIT at my Christmas Party.  The bakery was out of angel food cake, so I made a pound cake and cubed it...it worked wonderfully and everyone was pleased.  TIP:  Not so hot the next day...indulge and eat it that night if you can!

I tried this with my 14 yr old granddaughter. It was definitely a winner. The presentation was amazing and it tasted every bit as good as it looked. I prepared a little too much fruit but threw it all in anyway. It would make an awesome impression in a "I'll bring the desert" situation. It's a keeper.

I made this for a church group dinner and it went fast. Everyone raved over it and asked for the recipe. There were no leftovers! Thanks for sharing!
Update: Different bowls are different sizes. I have one from pampered chef which is a 1/3 smaller than my other bowl. To deal with this, I broke up the angel food and followed with layers. It's excellent.

So, so good and practically fool proof. Do prepare the jello per the box before adding to the recipe. Too dry otherwise.

I made this recipe for a party tonight. It was a success.  I made it for a cookout this past weekend and it was not eaten.  The first time I made it with yellow cake mix. I don't think I put enough berries in it. Also the guys wouldn't touch berries. The trifle I made tonight had angel food cake and I used more berries and bananas and pineapple chunks.  I also used Cheesecake pudding with 1 cup of milk like others suggested and without it, I would not have had enough filling. I also did not use kiwi. I used blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, blackberries, bananas and canned pineapple. Do soak your bananas with the pineapple juice. This is kind of of expensive to make this time of year with the berries, but very good.  Thanks for the recipe.

I had never made trifle before and wanted to reason to make one since I had bought a trifle bowl, and I am SO glad I picked this one!! The pudding mixture was so yummy!!! I didn't use kiwi (didn't have any), and don't really care for pound cake or angel food cake (as others suggested), so I used good ol' Nillas instead of cake, and it turned out really, really good. Presentation was pretty and taste was great!! Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe!!  :)

What an amazing dessert!!!  I have made this four times within the past 2 weeks, mostly because I bought the fruits in wholesale and did not want them to go bad.  Never the less each time I have made it, it was a delightfully success.  I do recommend soaking the banana slices in the pineapple juice to help them from turning brown so fast.  However, the only thing I changed was using a Classic White Cake, rather than the angel food cake, simply because I am not a fan of angel food cake.  The fruit flavors are more enhanced if you make it at least a day in advance.  I strongly recommend making this for any occassion.  It looks beautiful once assembled!!!!

DO NOT prepare pudding prior to adding to whipped cream as one reviewer told you to.  Read the directions, it says add "unprepared" pudding mix.

I tore the cake into chunks, instead of cutting it into pieces. I did one thin layer of pineapple, sliced just one banana, and did two thick layers of strawberries. I used light sour cream. I also put sliced almonds on the sides and in the top to add a little crunch to the mushy texture. My version came out quite great!

I made this wonderful summertime dessert for a work cookout and it was literally the hit of the entire event.  Half the women there asked for the recipe and everyone commented first on how pretty it was, and then how great it tasted.  I followed the recipe word for word and put it in a glass bowl so the layers were visible.  The only suggestion I have is to use a LARGE bowl.  My glass bowl is the size of a large salad serving bowl and I had to cut back on some of the whipped cream mixture in order to make it all fit (it as still heaping over the top).

This was the hit of oy pastor's family's July 4th party.  You can make this really festive for Americana holidays by using blue and red fruits.  I used a can of crushed pineapple and mixed it in with the fluff in between the layers.

Made this for a church function and it was a hit. Don't usually like bananas or pineapple but weren't noticable. Added oranges and blueberries. Made the pudding up according to package directions and then added the sour cream and whipping cream. This is easy and so impressive. LYB

This was a very "pretty" dessert.  I used french vanilla pudding and it was great.  I didn't like the bananas turning brown so I might top the dessert with them next time instead of layering them in with the other fruit.

This was beautiful and dissapeared instantly!  I used cheesecake flavor pudding mix.  Raves all around.  My 1- and 2-year-olds both loved it as well as the church dinner attendees.  Mmmmm.....

Delicious!!! I made this for our family NYE dinner and everybody loved it. It's not too sweet either. Make the pudding before mixing in with the cool whip and sour cream. I tweaked it by using lemon pudding instead of the vanilla pudding, I think this made it better it complimented the fruit better in my opinion.I also used 2 1/2 of angel food cake to give it more consistency. This made it easier to cut into. It's delicious  and easy the part that's time consuming is cutting up the fruit. I also added blueberries.

OK, This is delicious!  Made it for Labor Day weekend and it was a hit.  I could eat a ton of this stuff!  I followed the recipe exactly, using french vanilla pudding mix, no kiwis, blueberry and strawberry for festive colors, and was able to fit 2 solid layers in my very large decorative bowl.  No worries though, I just used up my ingredients and it was still beautiful and delicious.  For people saying to prepare the pudding before adding-  I think this is all dependent on the pudding mix you buy, there are so many choices at the store, I made sure to get the 3.4 oz, regular old pudding mix, not sugar free, or cook n serve or one of the many other varieties.  I mixed mine in and it was perfect, making the pudding would have been way watery.  I would say add more cool whip if you are looking fore bulk in the cream mixture.  Can't wait to make this with variations in ingredients (chocolate pudding, different fruit, etc)  Great recipe!

Fantastic and easy! I used 2 boxes of pudding mix prepared with milk before combining with sour cream and cool whip. French vanilla cake was very good with this.

Just an excellent dessert.  I used fresh whipping cream which I whipped with the unprepared pudding and then I folded in the sour cream.  I let it sit over night and it was amazing with all the flavours soaking in over night.  This is easy and delicious as well as looks good in a trifle pedestal bowl

Joy, you've got a winner! Everyone at our recent housewarming party loved it. I used cheesecake pudding mix (made as directed on the box) with a little splash of vanilla. I also did what others suggested and soaked the banana slices in the pineapple juice. This was so delicious and pretty. I will definitely make again!

I used this for my son's pirate themed birthday. I swirled in blue food coloring in the top layer for the ocean and then peaked areas for waves, and placed a toy pirate ship on it. It was a fun recipe instead of traditional cake. Used berries (blueberries, raspberries, strawberries).

I made this for a family party and everyone loved it.  I actually folded the drained crushed pineapple into the pudding mixture after making the pudding mixture the way the recipe states.  I liked the flavor a lot better that way, because I'm not a big cool whip fan, and other reviewers had said the pudding mix was too dry, so the pineapple helped with that.  Make sure to prepare the pudding mix pretty quickly, because the pudding will start to set up and you'll get little clumps like Tapioca.  For this one, I used mixed berries, since it's the season for them.  It was a huge hit!

Everyone I served it to loved it!  It got rave reviews!  I made it gluten free using a gluten free cake mix.  I think it would turn out great with whatever kind of cake you want to use in it.  I made the pudding using 1 cup of milk and immediately mixed that with the sour cream and cool whip.  I soaked my bananas in pineapple juice as other reviewers had suggested but didn't use the crushed pineapple.  I added frozen blueberries to the strawberry layer and these were really good in it.  We all enjoyed the leftovers as much the 2nd day!

I Made this for our Easter dessert. It was a huge hit! Very easy and good. I couldn't find ant descent kiwis so I had to leave them off. I also used cheese cake pudding in stead of the vanilla.

This is close to the one I got from friend's in England except they cut the angel food and spread jam on it, put it back together and then cut up and put into dish.  Then you pour 1/2 cup Brandy over it and let it soak in.  Next layer is strawberry jello, almost set up.  Let that set up then and add the rest.  It is the most requested family dessert for holidays.  When my dad was alive and helped my mom make it, we could always tell if he did, it had a lot more brandy in it!!

This was a very good trifle -I did make a few minor changes, though, after reading previous reviews. I recommend using pineapple tidbits in place of the crushed pineapple -especially if you don't want to take the time to thoroughly drain the crushed variety. Also-personal preference -but I would leave out the bananas only because they get gooey and brown very quickly. I did combine the bananas and pineapple to keep the bananas from turning brown so quickly, but this recipe does make a lot -and there's just no way the bananas can hold up past the first day. I also used cheesecake pudding mix and doubled the "filling" -was very thick. Overall a good trifle.

Awesome Easter dessert. Unfortunately I own a smaller version Trifle bowl so i was only able to layer the angel food twice. Next time I would use half the sour cream, and add only one cup of milk to the pudding mixture, instead of two, it was much too runny. I used more than the recommended amounts of fruit, also for easier scooping, chunk the cake as other reviewers recommend.

I have been making this for years and it is my favorite dessert recipe.  The only change I make is that I do NOT drain the pineapple so that it moistens the angel food cake when I pour it over. Thanks so much, Joy!

Outstanding dessert for Easter/springtime!Couldn't find cheesecake pudding at the store I went to, so I used banana cream pudding. Lined the trifle dish sparingly with sliced strawberries, kiwi and blueberries; soaked the banana slices in a lot of pineapple juice for a couple hours, and mixed the bananas with both pineapple tidbits AND crushed pineapple (1 can of each,) cut mandarin orange pieces (from a can) and cut (canned) peaches (light syrup kind.) Added a touch of cinnamon to the whipped topping/pudding/sour cream layer, and spread plain whipped topping on the top - decorated with strawberries and blueberries. Made tons, and family was thrilled to take some home!

I loved this recipe because there are so many options. I used the Cheesecake pudding mix, when mixed with the whipping cream and sour cream, the taste is YUM, YUM. Tastes good just by itself or as a dip for fruits. All the previous reviews helped with the trifle. Thanks!!

I also added blueberries!  My family ate this first at a recent picnic! I love fruit and this was a beautiful and yummy way to have with a little more umph!  Thank you.

Pretty yummy! The only thing I would improve upon was the angel food cake I used. It wasn't as soft as I would have liked so my suggestion would be to use a soft white cake. The "filling was so yummy by itself that I kept dipping into to filling. That's what really makes this dish. I might make more than the recipe calles for next time and just smother the dessert in the filling. I also didn't have a trifle bowl so I used a glass baking dish. I'm sure it would look much nicer with all the pretty layers if I would have had a trifle dish so if you have one, it will look beautiful.

I have made this recipe a handful of times and everyone loves it and asks for the recipe.  It is very easy and fun to prepare.  I vary the fruit to what is fresh and in season.  You can use anything fruit you want.  I sometimes (depending on my mood) use 'light' Cool Whip and 'low-fat' sour cream and no one can tell the difference.  I also use Banana pudding for an extra flavor.

I made this for a Christmas party.  Instead of layering it, I made it in a rectangle dish.  It was easier for guest to get a portion.

I also used cheesecake pudding (adding 1 1/4 cup and mixing before blending with other mixture).  Doubled the whipped mixture as others suggested.

Used the pineapple juice to soak the bananas while I got everything else ready to assemble.   

I froze a lemon and grated the zest onto the top for a little extra flavor!

A great little tip!  I put it in the freezer for a couple hours.  It started thawing while I drove to the party.  When everybody got to the dessert, it was still nice and cold!

Wow. This is a great refreshing summer desert.  I have to admit I was a little bit skeptical when I mixed together the whipped topping, sour cream, and pudding (which i did actually make with the box instructions) because it seemed too runny.  But in the end, it was perfect!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This is a very deliciously flavored trifle but I have to admit, I would have appreciated it to be a little less "runny" and more light 'n fluffy.  Next time I'm probably going to cut the pudding in half and see if that lightens it up.  Also for next time I'm going to try using pound cake instead of angel food because I think it would give it more substance than the angel did.  It soaked up all of the moisture and got too soggy in spots.  Great base recipe though!

I made this for christmas dinner desert and it was amazing.
 For those that are confused about the pudding the recipe said to add the "unprepared pudding mix" to the whipped topping.
I am making this again today for a dinner party i'm going to tomorrow !

Oops didn't read the posts before making this dessert last minute for Christmas, so I did not prepare the pudding but folded in the unprepared package. Which really didn't seem right at all!! Nobody is complaining but I think it would be much better that way.

DEEEEElicious. I, like others, added one cup of milk to the pudding mix as I thought it would be too dry. It makes to a nice presentation and was so easy to make.  I had never had it before but it was a hit and I will make it again.

This was extremely tasty and bonus points for how easy it was putting it together.    I added blueberries, along with the suggested fruit.  My friends said it tasted like a banana split.  I definitely think the crushed pineapple is a must.    Thanks for sharing.

I made this dessert when company came over and everyone seemed to like it.  It was nice because it wasn't too sweet and it was relatively guilt free since I used low fat whipped cream, sour cream and angel food cake is already pretty good for you.  I followed other's advice and soaked the bananas in the pineapple juice.  However, I wish that I had used fresh pineapple instead of canned. It added an odd texture and nothing can compete with the taste of fresh pineapple.  Next time, I'll try changing up the fruit and will probably add lots of berries!

We attended a St. Patty's day party so I used Pistachio pudding and substituted Plain fat free Greek Yogurt in place of the sour cream to make it a bit healthier.  Everyone LOVED it and couldn't believe it was basically a fat free dessert.

Beautiful presentation and tastes even better the next day.   Big warning to other newbies like me - I used Drambuie based on someone's recommendation to add raspberry liqueur.  This turned my beautiful creation into the color of warm gray death.  Tasted ok but had to start over since this was intended for a party.  No leftovers at the end of the night.  Sour cream makes this dish. I also soaked the banana in the pineapple juice as suggested and used fresh berries (strawberries, blueberries and raspberries).  Fantastic and will make again!

My family loves this.  I have made a few times, usually just as the recipe states, sometimes substituting other fruits and it is always a winner.  I try not to let it sit too long as it sometimes gets a little mushy, but that is generally not a problem since people eat it all!

I liked it.  I prepared the pudding before like other reviewers suggested, but I was confused about how to assemble it based on the instructions vs. the picutre.  Anyway, it was good but not tremendously so.

Delicious!  I made this for Easter in the morning and let it sit until dinner, and everyone loved it.  I used only strawberries for fruit, cubed the angel food cake and added a little less then a cup of milk to the dry vanilla pudding mix.  Beautiful presentation.  I made my own real whipped cream, can't stand the taste of Cool Whip.  This dessert was not to sweet, just perfect.  Was eaten in no time at all, too bad no leftovers. This has already been requested for the next family gathering. YUMMY! Thank you for sharing.

This was my first time making a trifle, lets just say it was easier than it looked. I used french vanilla (prepared), could not find the cheesecake at my grocery store (but would like to try). I also allowed my bananas to soak in the pineapple juice, and it really helped prevent browning. At the book club meeting everyone loved it and of course wanted the recipe. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing.

We made this for Christmas day. I'm used to a more heavy, soaked trifle. This was a nice switch.

Mediocre at best.  Very sweet, a bit too mushy, and tasted primarily of cool whip.  Although my kids enjoyed it was not worth the effort, fruit with cool whip dumped on top would be the same taste equivalent.

Very good recipe! I changed a couple things to make it my own and added a mixed layer of fruit and cream into the center hole. Turned out great! I will absultly make again!

This recipe is delish! I made quite a bit of this since it needed to feed 30 people. My first batch I goofed and prepared the pudding. No worries, it mixed in great! I actually liked it better with the prepared pudding mixed in (Mix according to pie directions on box).  Someone made the suggestion of soaking the bananas in the pineapple juice - Do it! That being said...awesome recipe!!!

Just a tip for those of you who are worried about the pudding mix: my mom makes a fabulous fruit dip using powdered vanilla pudding mix and sour cream. You just mix the two together. No need to prepare the pudding. It mixes into the sour cream perfectly. Delicious and would be great with this recipe.

everyone not only LOVED how beautiful it looked, but also how good it tasted! 

i made a few changes - i added in some pound cake along with the angel food cake to give the trifle more heartiness. (then followed the suggestions by other reviews)....such as prepared the pudding according to package directions before mixing with whip cream and sour cream.  only added a bit of cubed pineapples. also soaked the bananas in the pineapple juice!

This trifle is the best I've ever had! Just to clarify...some reviews have to said to prepare the pudding first. The recipe says to combine "unprepared" pudding which I did and it's delicious this way! Also, I wouldn't leave out the crushed pineapple as this flavour is wonderful!

Very pretty!!  For looks I rate this 5 STAR!! I think it would taste better without the pudding, just use, cream cheese, sour cream and real whipped cream as the base!  The angel food cake tasted wonderful in it!  Thanks for the great recipe!

We don't have frozen whipped topping in Australia - I just used thickened fresh cream.  I also used fresh strawberries, can peaches and added red jelly for the kids!  You also can't buy Angel food cake, so I used Heavenly Angel food cake recipe from this site - Absolutely delicious combo.  Will definately do both again!

My hubby made this and it came out great!  He baked a white cake instead of the angel food cake.  Very pretty to look at and even better to eat!  This is a keeper.

Made for a picnic, was a hit!  Used cream cheese pudding with one cup of milk, then added sour cream, then 8oz of cool whip.  Used a sour cream angel food cake, soaked the bananas in pineapple juice before placing on cake.  Really a great, pretty recipe!  Thank you:-)

Move over Martha!! This dessert is Absolutely Scrumptious! I only made a minor change (I didn't want to, hubby bought the wrong kind of sour cream)which was light sour cream instead of regular. I also added 2 teaspoons of lemon juice to my pudding mixture because the light sour cream didn't taste quite as sour as normal stuff and also had a weird after-taste which after my lemon juice adjustment to the mix, dissappeared. Anywho, it turned out phenominal. My bowl was large so I needed additional strawberries and kiwi to top it, other wise I wouldn't have changed anything at all and I'd bet it would be even better.... This is an Amazing dessert. Thank you, Thank you a billion times!!

This was fine but certainly not the best trifle I have made. Filling was pretty sparce. I suggest making a double batch. A little dry as well. No raves from my guests over this dessert.

This was an incredible dessert.  I made it for a Sunday family dinner and I am still getting rave reviews about it.  The only suggestion I have is to use some of the filling as "adhesive" for the strawberries and kiwis and also mix the bananas with the pineapple so they dont brown.  Thank you!

i liked this a lot! couldn't find the cheesecake pudding everyone suggested, and had to use strawberry angel food cake (which was good anyway). also couldn't find the correct size pudding mix. used low-fat whipped topping and low-fat sour cream, and it still tasted amazing! use LOTS of fruit.

So very, very good!  I made it with all low-fat products and it was still to-die-for.  I could eat the whipped topping/sour cream/pudding mix mixture like ice cream it is so delicious.  I have made it since as just a topping for fruit, without the cake and other ingredients.

Good, but not outstanding.  I would recommend preparing the pudding first as per package directions.  I did not, it remained a little grainy/lumpy.

This was easy & yummy, but I did not have people begging me for the recipe.  As others suggested, I did not layer w/ the bananas, but put them on top just before serving.  My 6 & 7 yr old nephews did not like it, but the rest of us thought it was good.  I will keep it for a nice summer dessert.

I have made this twice. Once for New Year's and once for a work event.  It was a big hit.  I use the cheesecake instant sugar free pudding mix (3 one ounce packages), no fat sour cream, light whipped topping and milk (to make the pudding according to package directions). I also us kiwis, strawberries, and blueberries.  However, I tend to change the fruit to what is on sale and it still turns out great. I have also made this using regular ingredients with more fat and no one could tell the difference. Go with the lighter ingredients.

This was a hit!  I used 75% of vanilla pudding because it was so sweet.  Next time,  I would eliminate pudding.   The whip cream & sour cream taste fantastic on its own.   Also, had chopped walnuts available.   This  recipe is easy & is a keeper.

I found the directions lacking.After reading some of the reviews, I opted to make the pudding, then folded it in with the coolwhip & sour cream. I added some "Let's go organic "unsweetened grated coconut (Publix supermarket) because I needed to use it up. By the way, this coconut is the closest to fresh coconut I've ever had. I grew up in Florida, so I know my tropical fruits! Drained most of the pineapple juice. I think Tidbits would have been better than crushed. This was put together 4 hours before serving. I was not impressed. Found it to be too bland. Too much "fluff" , and did not care for the angel food cake. Moist pound cake or yellow would be my choice. Had some leftovers 2days later and it was much better, So I think this should be made at least 24 hrs. ahead. I would try this again in a tropical mode: pineapple, mandarin oranges, bananas, coconut, mango. Would be great in summer.

I made a few changes based on personal taste (removed bananas and sour cream, added blueberries;  changed vanilla pudding to cheesecake pudding and angel food cake to yellow cake).This was my family's first Xmas celebration since my dad died in January 2013 so I wanted everything to be perfect.  My mom was BLOWN AWAY and raved to her coworkers about how beautiful AND delicious it was.  My first sincere compliment about my cooking from my mom LOL.  Thanks Joy!!!

This recipe was delicious. We don't have dairy whip here in Australia but whipped cream instead. Years ago we were able to get dairy whip and I wish we still could

I LOVE this recipe!  Easy and delicious. Every single bit of it 
disappears each time I bring it to a gathering!  I do drop the bananas into the pineapple juice to soak up some of that flavor while I'm assembling the trifle; not sure if this helps with the dryness a few people mentioned, but I've only had rave reviews from anyone who's ever tried it....wonderful!

This was a big hit after dinner. I made my own angel food cake. Angel Food Cake I by Syd. I also followed the advise of others to make the pudding according to the directions on the box and also soaked the bananas in the pineapple juice. I used strawberries, blueberries and bananas for a patriotic theme.  It had the perfect amount of sweetness and the fruit makes this a very refreshing desert.

This recipe was perfect. The only thing I did differently was instead of using a round angle food cake, I used thinly sliced butter cake which was wonderful. I think next time I'll add blueberries as well.

Light and lovely dessert! I made the angel cake, but would prefer to buy it made if i make it again.  I cooked the pudding as the many reviews suggested and I'm sure that's the proper way to make this.  I do suggest adding half of the pudding to the sour cream and cool whip mix, try how it tastes and slowly add more pudding to get a taste that you like the best.  I added all of the pudding and i didnt like that the tartness of the sour cream was diluted by all off the pudding.

We loved it! Made it the day before serving and it was great. Will most likely be appearing on the table again shortly! I did mix the pudding with a cup of milk first and followed the reccomendation of soaking the bananas in the pineapple juice.

MMmm, made this tonight and it was nice and easy. The only time consuming part was cutting the fruit-which wasn't that bad. The cream filling was a little on the sweet side as you continued eating it. I definitely be making this for the next potluck

Great recipe.  The only thing I would change is that I'd mix the pudding with milk like one of the reviewers suggested...or maybe sift the pudding mix.  It was a little chunky, but still tasted great.

Great!  This is easy for trifle beginners like me.  The only hard part is finding a large enough glass bowl.  I used a deep angel food cake in a bunt shape and cut it roughly into palm sized pieces.  This is a recipe that can easily go low or no fat - modify the whipped cream, sour cream, and pudding.  Keep the sour cream in, though, as it adds weight and cuts the straight sweet flavor to make it more enjoyable. If you don't like these fruits or want to add others feel free!

I always get rave reviews when I make this trifle!  I don't use kiwi, because I worry that it'll be too tart, but I substitute with blueberries.  I did follow the suggestion to add a little milk to the mix, and I feel it did make a difference- not as dry when made that way.  I don't know if I'd make the whole pudding, that might end up too runny.

I was uncertain about trying this as I had never made a  trifle before.  It was a breeze.  Delicious and looked great.  I was concerned about how it would serve out of the bowl because the angel food cake was not torn into pieces but it was not a problem at all. Loved it. It had a real WOW factor.

A lovely trifle that is not too time consuming to make and can (should) be made ahead. I layered somewhat differently and used cubed cake, as some other reviewers did. I also added I cup of milk to the pudding before incorporating it into the cream and used real whipping cream (whipped and sweetened) instead of whipped topping, as I don't like whipped topping. Thanks for the super recipe!

This is one of the best trifles I have tasted! I left out the bananas and just increased the other fruit, as I knew there would be some left. I hate banana all brown and squishy the next day.The combination was just wonderful and it looked so pretty.

OMG...this trifle cake is to die for!!  This is the best Trifle Cake I have ever had.  Thank you Darcey55 for sharing your awesome recipe; anymore recipes you would like to share?  At every gathering or holiday party I am always asked "are you bringing that trifle cake?".  People always rave about how much they they loved the my (really yours) trifle cake and how they want the recipe.  The only addition/change I make is that I add mini chocolate chips in between the layers.  I wish I could give this recipe more than the 5 stars...this is to die for!  I also print out copies of the recipe because someone always requests it.  Thank you!!

This was absolutely delicious!!!  I switched it up a bit. I omitted the pineapple completely and used fresh strawberries, raspberries and bananas in the centre layers. Made it for a family and friends dinner and it was a HUGE hit! thank you very much for sharing.. will definitely be making this again!

This was so awesome!!  I did soak the banana slices in the pineapple juice and accidentally did 2 pudding mixes (I made it about midnight the night before I took it to a church get-together).  It was a HUGE hit!  I thought for sure I'd be able to take some home with me since it was such a big dish, but it vanished!  Everyone loved it and wanted to lick out the bowl!  I didn't use the whole can of pineapple, and I used 4 or 5 kiwis.  Also for the middle layer instead of doing the kiwi and strawberry slices on the edge I did banana slices.  Also dusted the top with cocoa powder.  It was very pretty and tasted even better!  Thanks!  Will make this many more times!

This trifle was a real winner!  All the ladies at my dinner party asked for the recipe.  The only change I made (that's because I didn't read the recipe correctly) was to not drain the pineapple - I mixed the undrained pineapple with the bananas.  I will always make it this way, it really soaks into the angel food cake.  This recipe was even better the second day and even better the day after that!!!  Next time I think I will use coconot pudding.  So refreshing!  Thanks for the great recipe.

I love this receipe. I modified it to suit our taste. I use pound cake instead of angel. Omit the kiwis and use assorted berries strawberries, raspberries, blueberries and/or blackberries and of course banana and pineapple and some of the pineapple juice too!. I mix the pudding mix with some milk then add the rest. This is the best!

Will be making this treat again soon! My whole family raved over this easy, yet scrumptious dessert. I did omit the sour cream. Used sugar free/fat free vanilla pudding, 1% milk, fat free cool whip, and the angel food cake with all the fresh strawberries, kiwis,bananas, and drained pineapple.....so good! Refreshing and light, no guilt about this beauty. A true hit! Thanks!

Sorry, I didn't think this was the best trifle I've made.  The pudding mixture was too thick, had to use milk to thin it. I like kiwi, but thought it was too tart it it.  Still prefer the Angel Berry Trifle from Light and Tasty(pudding mixture is vanilla pudding, milk, vanilla yogurt, sour cream & cream cheese, whipped cream is a separate layer,layer with angel food cake and berries).

This is now one of my favourite desserts I've ever made.  Very few changes...I did soak the bananas in pineapple juice as suggested by other reviewers, I tore the cake into cubes rather than slicing it and decided to use banana pudding (which I did prepare, and glad I did)instead of vanilla.  It was delicious! Everyone raved over it.

This dessert is fabulous!  Made it for a reunion and it was the first dessert eaten.  Unfortunately I had none to take home!  Next time I will make it with fat free sour cream and cool whip and sugar free pudding.  I think it will still be wonderful. I will definately make this again and again.

This was a huge hit.  Made it for a Mystery Dinner Theatre we hosted at our home for 20 or so people and everyone loved it!  It is beautiful and makes a great presentation.  It's so simple too, there's really no way you can mess it up.

Excellent and quick!  I made this twice and preferred the one I made without the bananas (personal preference).  You can use any fruit on hand.  Thanks for this recipe.  I will definitely make it again and again.

I made this for a baby shower for my SIL who is diabetic.  It was a huge hit. I had a bit left over since we had people not show up and this is alot of food.  My 18 year old son LOVED it.  It was really easy and you can use any fruit you want and then just layer.

WOW - THANK YOU!   Outstanding dessert that my family loved - it's in my recipe box now.  I followed the hints and combined the bananas and pineapple.  I wish I had added a little milk to the pudding - will do that next time. Oh .. and I used cheesecake pudding.  WHOO HOOOO

Made this for American friends who had never heard of trifle. I used a little more whipped cream than needed but it still came out good and everyone loved it! Some weight watchers even went back for seconds! 
I did follow two tips from others and that was to soak the bananas in pineapple juice and to make the pudding separately before mixing into the cream. I will definitely make this again.

This was delicious even though I made a mistake in mixing the pudding with the sour cream before folding into the whipped topping -- it was like paste.  The filling ended up tasting good even though it was lumpy.  I would recommend breaking up the cake as you put it in the bowl.

This is very good. I lowered the calories by using fat free sour cream and fat free whipped topping. No one could tell. I took it to a family get together and everyone loved it. This is a definite keeper that I will make again!

This was a great recipe!  I took the advice of some other reviews.  I soaked the bananas in the pineapple juice.  I decided not to use kiwis.  I used strawberries, blueberries, pineapple & bananas.  I also used chunk pineapple instead of crushed pineapple.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I used low-fat whipped topping and low-fat sour cream -- it was fantastic!  I made it in the morning and by dinner time, the bananas got a little brown, but it was still great.  Would be great with a variety of different fruits -- a real crowd pleaser (and beautiful to look at).

I tried this triffle on a whim and must admit that it turned out better than expected. It was not to sweet and not to sour but a perfect blend of the two. My husband even loved it and insisted that I make it again. Thanks for sharing, it was simple and delish.

Yum!  This went over really well!  Both of my daughters concluded that they would rather leave out the pineapple and put sliced strawberries in place of that.  Sounds good to me.  We'll make this one again.

My family couldn't get enough of this dessert. The entire trifle was gone by the next morning. And it certainly gets points for presentation - there's nothing quite like a pretty trifle for producing maximum wows with minimum effort.

This was pretty good - it tasted awesome, but didn't look as good as I thought it would!  I would make it again though!

Everyone raved and not a drop was left. What I loved was the simplicity and the flexibility of the recipe. I only used strawberries, substituted with pound cake and cheesecake pudding. Also layered the whip cream on top (used a canned whipping cream so I could decorate as I wanted, see my photos). I loved the sour cream Excited to make again with whatever fruit is in season. Thank you for the inspo!

This dessert is perfect! Not too sweet and it's nice and fluffy. I'm not big on bananas in my desserts, so I substituted with a half pint of blueberries. I think next time I will used drained crushed pineapple instead of chunks so it it easier to distribute evenly. I also cubed the cake since the cake rounds didn't quite fit it my dish. Definitely will make again!

I just made if for the first time, looks great and tastes great, but am going to let it sit for 5-6 hours. Like others I used the juice of the pineapple to soak the bananas in and also used blueberries. I used a big single package (equal to two) of cheesecake pudding mix that called for 2 cups of milk. I folded the sour cream with the pudding first, then added the Cool Whip, I bought 2 containers and used 1 1/2 of the Cool Whip, thought it was better to have more then not enough to top it  off. The total process took 45 minutes, but next time it will be probably 10 minutes faster. Like everyone else said, I used Angel Food cake and just pulled it apart into 1-2" chunks.  Anyway, it is my first time, and can tweak to try different things like different pudding flavors, different types of cake or fruit and even some sweet liquor or almond or vanilla next time. It is a very beautiful serving, I bought a $25 trifle dish on Amazon that is beautiful to serve it. Oh, by the way, the cool whip was frozen, I put it in the sink in cold water for 30 minutes and that was enough to thaw it instead of the refrigerator waiting 3-4 hours, just a tip. Update: Well this was a big hit with our friends and came out very well. I think however, that I will skip the sour cream next time, personally I like it sweeter and it seems to tone it down too much for me, but that is just a personal taste, it was still excellent but worth a try on my next experiment!

Loved this.  Did change the pineapple, as I'm extremely allergic, to mandarin oranges crushed by hand.  My friends from out of town told me that any time I wanted to make this they would come back to visit.  Now I have a great bribe to share to get them back.

It was super easy and delicious! I used double the amount of angel cake and just crumbled it.  Used blueberries instead of kiwi and threw some over banana slices.  Every one raved about it at a family get together;-) Definitely a keeper!

Brought this to a work picnic and it was hit!  Made a few minor changes per others: Used cheesecake instant pudding and mixed with one cup milk before folding in. Used light sour cream and light cool whip (used a little more of each - closer to 12 oz of sour cream and 16 oz of cool whip). Omitted bananas, but added blueberries and raspberries to the pineapple.  Made this the day before so flavors could blend. It was great!

Fantastic light dessert for party. This did not feed 15 but only 8. My trifle bowl was overflowing and seconds were definitely 
required!! I used the pineapple also soaked the bananas in the juice,strawberries, 
blueberries, raspberries, kiwis.  Preparing the pudding shortly before a must. You won't regret making this for a party. Just be prepared to serve seconds and thirds. Be safe make 2!!!!!

This recipe is da bomb!!  I made it twice for two different groups and they raved over it.  I'm definitely keeping this one close.  It is delicious and there's never leftovers.  Mostly, I like it because there is no custard, not a fan of trifle with custard!

Made this trifle for bridge.  Amazing dessert - light and not too sweet. As with other reviewers, I prepared the pudding before adding sour cream and cool whip.  Scrumptious!! Thanks so much :-)

Delicious and versatile! I read the reviews and mixed the pudding with a cup of milk first.  I used banana crème pudding instead of bananas which was delicious.  I was unsure of how to put the fruit on the cake and so I layered cake, pudding/coolwhip mixture and then mixed the pineapple into that.  I then used mandarin oranges and blueberries along with the kiwis, and repeated. I ended with the cool whip mixture and decorated the top with strawberries. It was wonderful.  I really felt it tasted better the second day. I wouldn't be afraid to make it a day ahead and let it sit for a day before serving.

Majority of co-workers liked this.  Also prepared pudding according to box instructions before folding with sour cream and whipped topping. Used 1.5 oz box of banana cream flavor pudding + 1 cup half&half + 1 cup milk.

Was this recipe ever good!  What I did differently was to make real whipped cream and add powdered sugar to sweeten it - then the sour cream and pudding mix.  I don't like to eat frozen whipped topping because I believe it is healthier to eat "real" foods.  (OK the pudding mix is artificial but I could have substituted homemade pudding (which is soo delicious) and next time I will.

We really liked this recipe; my husband couldn't get enough of it, and he is not a fruit fan. I was afraid that the pudding mixture would have an artificial taste, but it was really delicious. We used pound cake because that's what we had on hand. Also threw in some blueberries which were delicious.   Next time I'd leave out the kiwi, just didn't seem to go well with the other fruits. The banana and berries together were delicious. I didn't drain the pineapple, and would do the same next time just so everything is moist. We will definitely make this one again. Very easy to put together and a big hit!  I used low-fat sour cream and low-fat whipped topping and could not tell any difference.

My mom gave me a store bought lemon pound cake to take to a family reunion, and I wasn't sure how it would taste alone, so I sliced it up and served it alongside the pudding/whip cream/sour cream mixture and a big bowl of cut up strawberries and peaches. I suggest using a big package of instant vanilla pudding and 8 oz. of Cool Whip. I made the cream topping as directed, but it tasted too Cool Whip-py to me, so I dumped the rest of the big package of the pudding over into the bowl. Very yummy! Will definitely make again.

I made this for Father's Day, exactly as the recipe was written, and it was a hit. I will make it again using other fresh fruits this summer. I appreciated the tip about soaking the banana slices in the pineapple juice. It's a keeper....thanks.

I made this for the first time for a cookout at work.  I did not use kiwi.  I substituted fresh blueberries and blackberries.  Everyone raved.  It is definitely the new favorite and talk about easy.  This is my new favorite dessert.  Thanks!!

I thought this was ok but nothing special at all.  It definitely needs more fruits and less whip topping.  Update:  It was A LOT better the day after, hence 4 stars,

Great recipes, I used only fresh strawberries and banans(soaked bananas in pineapple and lime juice) I used cream cheese instead of sour cream and also 
I used strawberry jello and sprinkled on the strawberry layers while layering them and it turned out great!  It made it more of a strawberry-banana trifle instead of tasting just like banana.

I made this for a new years eve party. People raved about it. I did change a few things, I used pound cake instead of angel food.  I soaked the bananas in the pineapple juice, and left out the kiwi.  I prepared the pudding/sour cream mixture as listed in the recipe, however I noticed it was hard to combine.  It didn't turn runny and was very good.  Between the layers of cream and on top, I sprinkled sweetened coconut.  This made it more tropical.  I left everything else the same.  YUMMMMMMY! The whole bowl was empty at the end of the night, and people were asking who made that delightful dessert.  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe looked easy and pretty.  In fact, I thought it would be prettier that it tasted.  It's pudding and cake, right?  Boy, was I wrong!  It was soooo delicious.  Everyone raved over this.  When you make this recipe, please adhere to the instructions of not preparing the pudding before mixing it with the sour cream.  The thick texture is really good.  The one change I made was to add 4 ounces of cream cheese to the pudding mixture.  It's just my preference.  Gonna make this one again for sure!

Followed the directions as stated and got great reviews!!  I brought to a dinner where everyone is watching their calorie intake, so I made a few ingredient modification.  Used the light version of sour cream and whipped topping.  The nearby store I go to sells a reduced sugar angel food cake and I used that as well in the recipe.  I will definitely make this one again. Very Yummy!

Very yummy. We have made a few times. Soaked bananas in pineapple juice as other suggested - worked well. Have tried other fruits as well - always delicious. I do use cream cheese vs. sour cream - we like the flavor better. Thanks Joy!!

This is my stand-by for any summer gathering, and I'm now known for this dessert -- thanks Joy!  Huge WOW factor to it.  It does take a little work, but boy is it worth it!  The kiwis and strawberries are easy to slice in a hard-boiled-egg slicer.  Bananas do brown quickly, so I usually do various berries in the layers instead(strawberry and kiwi outside).  And I add a little more sour cream to sort of de-sweeten the cream part.  Yummy!

Very, very yummy.  I used mint leaves to garnish the top layer - put them in a circle with sliced strawberries in the middle.

Great recipe.  Very easy.  Very quick.  Great taste.  Used the leftover fondue ingredients (the cake and cut up fruit) and it was perfect.  I did end up making more of the topping mixture as it wasn't enough.

I made this for a cookout and everybody loved it.  I thought there was too much fruit.  Next time I would leave out the kiwis.  I also like trifles with pudding layers, so I will do that next time.  Overall, I would make again with some changes.

Made it as diabetic friendly as possible using sugar-free white chocolate pudding and whipped cream.    Fantastic!!! Family loved it at Easter and my hubby finished it for breakfast.  Bananas soaked in pineapple and juice poured over cake was a great suggestion.

this was an awesome ending to a great Easter dinner. My family loved it. I used wine glasses and made them all single serve.They were attractive and my family  could not believe that there was sour creme in it. I used banana pudding, strawberries, crushed pineapple, and bananas.Thank you so much!

LOVE this recipe. I decided to buy low fat vanilla pudding in cups and combine that with the fat free sour cream first. Then I gently folded that into the fat free whipped topping just enough to bring them together and the texture and taste was wonderful! Soaking the banana in the pineapple juice definitely cut down on any browning and I used pineapple chunks, blueberries, banana and strawberries but about double the amount recommended. I will make this again and again. Thanks Joy!

This was a wonderful, light recipe that I made for Easter. Everyone loved it, and there wasn't much left over! The only problem I had was layering everying and making it look nice in the bowl, but that might just come with practice. I cant wait to make this recipe again!

I haven't actually tried the recipe yet but it sounds soo yummy. I just had a question on the angel food cake. I may sound dumb, but does this recipe call for you to make the cake or for a store bought one and could either one work?? Thanks

This was delicious.  I got so many comments and everyone liked how pretty it looked.  No one new how easy it was!!  I do recommend you mix the pudding mixture with the sour cream before adding the cool whip because it is hard to mix otherwise.  I will make this many times with other fruits!!

I thought this was pretty good, not fantastic though.  I think it was the angel cake, maybe had it been another cake it would've been great.  It was easy to make, but why don't I see any complaints about the prep time (LOTS of chopping!).  I'd try the chocolate trifles on this site, they look scrumptous!

I tried this recipe on Easter and it was a big hit. I put whipped cream all around the cake and decorated it with alternating slices of fruit.  It was a beauty.

Thanks for a great recipe.

This is very yummy and looks great! I was worried that it needed a bit more moisture to get the cake soft, but worked out fine. I would not add more than 1/4 cup of milk at most. I used a pound cake because that is what I had on hand. It was very well received and will be made again! Thank for the recipe.

This is a winner.  We had this at a family get together and everybody thought it was fantastic.  It was the only dish that was completely gone.  I doubled the fruit on everything with the exception of the pineapple.  For the pineapple use chunks if you want the pineapple flavor to come out a little more.

It was delicious and the perfect lighter dessert for a party!  I will definitely make this again.  I used previous feedback of preparing pudding before mixing with other ingredients.  I also had some extra filling so the kids enjoyed having some fruit dip!

It  was too dry.  I have tried other recipes using custard and they were much better than this one.  Won't make again.  I even added milk to the pudding mix.

I used sugar free pudding and sweetened the
 strawberries with Stevia. I used Sugar-free Whipped topping. I made mine in individual serving bowls and topped with a strawberry and toasted pecans.  I used the drained pineapple juice to thin the pudding a little. It was pretty and tasted good. This one is a keeper!

Made this for a dinner party yesterday.  Absolutely add the milk called for to make the pudding then fold it into the whipped cream, sour cream mixture.  Absolutely a hit.  Not hard at all.  Delicious and beautiful.

So delicious and pretty! I used the cheesecake pudding option, and my fruit was blueberries, strawberries, kiwi and blackberries. I used low fat dairy products to keep it light
and healthy—delicious and you’d never have known, so why ever use full fat?  I doubled the whipped cream mixture so I could put a bit more over the top (there was some left over which we used for fruit dip the next day). I also made a version later that I served in 24 clear plastic cups, for an office treat. Not as easy to achieve the layered look but I was able to ring each one with kiwi slices and make them up ahead of time so there was no serving involved. A big hit and guilt-free for those watching their waistlines!

The recipe offered the opportunity to use fresh fruit here in Florida. I substituted blueberries for bananas. I kept the pineapple juice after reading that the sour cream, pudding and whipped topping was dry. I added about 1/2 cup of almond milk to soften it make the mixture more creamy.  A nice dessert to enjoy on a hot evening.

Fabulous! So easy and such a beautiful dessert. I ommited the pineapple because I'm not too keen on using it in desserts. Otherwise, followed it to the letter and loved the results.

The recipe as written doesn't work.  I followed one suggestion to mix the pudding mix with 3/4 cups of milk and 1/2 cup of raspberry liquor.  This turned the mix into a light tan color, but was very tasty.  Also, I added the whipped topping to the pudding instead of a separate layer.  The pudding was too thick to go down through the layers.  I think it needed the full 2 cups of liquid.  It does look pretty good.  It will be easier to make the strawberries and kiwis stay in place if you put the cake in first!

This is my favorite trifle to make.  I prefer the one with sour cream over the ones with cream cheese for a lighter taste.  But as so many have noted, the pudding mix needs at least 1 c. of milk mixed with the dry pudding mix before other ingredients are added (then 5 *).  Otherwise it is way too stiff.  You can also use any 'cake' - angel food, yellow, pound, brownies,etc.  Just change the fruit to go with the flavor of cake.

Simply delicious and beautiful!  Perfect for one of our Christmas desserts without chocolate.  I made it with cream cheese pudding (prepared as directed the day before) and I made my own whipped cream with 1/2 cup of whipped plain cream cheese and 2 T. of white sugar.  So, no sour cream.  It was so fresh, creamy and fruity!  I added some raspberries on top too.

The changes I made was to use Pina Colada yogurt in place of the sour cream.  It added flavor and I consider it to be more healthy than sour cream.  Any flavor yogurt can be used.  If you don't want a strong flavor like Pina Colada use vanilla or honey flavor.  I also like to moisten the cake with liquer and juice OR  liquid flavored coffee creamer such as Coffee Mate or International Delight.  French Vanilla is a good one for those who are not adventuris  but I like amaretto flavor and also almond joy the best.

It has been awesome every time!!  I always get so many complements.  I do use a combination the regular and low fat varieties of the whip topping and it doesn't make much of a difference.

Delicious!  I took the suggestion of many of the reviews and made the pudding as per the directions on the box and then added in the whip cream and sour cream.  I made it with angel food cake and only used strawberries, blueberries and kiwi.  My guests and I liked it a lot.

DO NOT make the pudding mix first, and THEN add the sour cream & whipped topping. If you make the pudding first, it's going to be a wet, gloppy, mess that will over soak your cake while chilling. Next time I might make a homemade angel food cake instead of a purchased one from the Deli. This is almost too pretty to eat. *Almost*. ;)

Made this recipe in a church Iron Chef Cook off. Won 5 stars for taste, appearance and best use of ingredient (which happened to be sour cream). Everyone (mostly teenagers) LOVED this! We made it with all the ingredients listed, the only thing different was we made the pudding first.

Wonderful!!!!!!  I was looking for something light and summery for the first warm day we'd had in a few months and this fit the bill!!  I did make a few changes based on other reviews.  I used cheesecake pudding and I prepared it per instructions on the box before mixing with sour cream.  I also tore the cake up into pieces and used blueberries instead of kiwi.  Everyone loved it!!!! Will definitely make again and again!!!

This is the dessert you bring to a party or serve for guests....and there is never any left! Kids and adults eat this up! It's also fun to make. I finish off the top layer with whip cream and some fruit. I also just break up pieces of the angel food cake when doing this recipe. My kids love to help with this recipe too! You can't go wrong with this one! Looks great and tastes great! Be ready for everyone to ask you for the recipe!

Very good for the summer, nice and lite, but a little more tangy than I usually like.

I changed several things just because of what I had on hand.  I substituted marscapone for the sour cream and frozen mixed berries for the strawberries and kiwi.  I did as other reviewers and made the pudding according to the package adding a little extra vanilla and soaking the bananas in the pineapple juice.  It took less than 10 minutes to put the entire thing together and it looks beautiful.  The pudding mixture tasted amazing.

This was very good.  I followed the recipe exactly, but didn't have a trifle dish, so I ended up putting it in a large plastic bowl.  Still came out good.

I am just reviewing the filling-The cream cheese, vanilla pudding mix and coolwhip mixture. I baked little pie crusts in mini muffin tins, then piped this cream into them using a big pastry bag and the large cupcake tip. Just before serving I topped them w/frozen wild blueberries. They were so good. My son raved about them.

Wow! I made this for Easter and it was a hit! I thought my brother in law was going to lick the bowl! The only change I made was to mix the pudding with 1 c. milk before adding the sour cream.  Once that was mixed well, I folded in the cool whip. We could have just eaten the 'fluff'! It was so good! Thanks for the tip of soaking the bananas in the pineappe juice. I couldn't believe they did not turn brown. This was a spectacular dessert.  I can't wait to try it again with blueberries and raspberries!

I loved this recipe!  I used it last night at my Pampered Chef party to demonstrate the trifle bowl and it was a hit.  I substituted the vanilla pudding for cheesecake flavored pudding and the fresh strawberries for a pint of frozen, sliced, sugered strawberries (Wal-Mart didb't have any fresh...can you believe it?).  It was great, thank you for the recipe.

My family loved this recipe.  Just for those that want to make it a little healthier.  I made it with fat free cool whip and sour cream and sugar free pudding and angel food cake. Still wonderful and even better the second day.

This was incredibly good! I used a combo of fat free and lite cool whip and it was still delicious (and now lower fat!). I will definitely be making this again.

This was ok. I didnt get any complaints but no one ooo'd and aaaa'd over it either. I used mixed blueberries and raspberries with spleda and mixed with the strawberries. I also used a vanilla cream coffee cake in place of the angel food. It was gone by the next day, but I probably wont make again.

This was sooooo good!!!  And sooo easy, especially for someone who hardly ever cooks!  I took it to a family reunion and everyone thought my mom had made it! (she always makes things that look gorgeous and taste even better -- the ultimate compliment!)  The only change I made was to prepare the pudding first and then add the sour cream and whipped topping!  Turned out great!  Thanks Joy!
