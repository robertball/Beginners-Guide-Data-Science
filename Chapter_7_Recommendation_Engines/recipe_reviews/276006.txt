Loved this! I will never cook lobster in anything other than an air fryer again!

I made it but don't agree with the time of cooking instructions.    Did taste great and I like the butter, lemon, garlic topping.
Certainly will make it again.

This was excellent!!  And easy as can be.  I placed them in a small piece of tinfoil to hold in the butter mixture. So this added about 3 minutes to the time.
