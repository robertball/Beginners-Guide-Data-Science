Great salad - being from PA I had to try this! And, while this doesn't compare to Pat's or Geno's, it's a nice twist on a great classic! My husband loves cheesesteaks and since I have a hard time getting him to eat salads this was perfect! I used a sirloin steak that I partially froze in order to get the slices nice and thin. I marinated only the steak in light Kraft Italian dressing that I perked up with some additional minced garlic and bit of oregano. I marinated it for about an hour. I sauteed the onions and pepers in a bit of olive oil and then sauteed the steak. I used light cheddar cheese on mine and provolone on my husband's portion. You can leave out the garbanzo beans if you like, but I love them so I left them in the salad. To put this over the top I wanted a homemade Ranch dressing, so I used "Ranch-Style Buttermilk Dressing" from this site. I will definitely make this again.

Wow!  This was an excellent recipe - my husband just praised it!  It was so different but had such a great taste.  One of my best recipes from this website yet!  I did leave out the garbanzo beans and used thin fries instead of curly but obviously that did not negatively affect the outcome!

What a great way to use leftover flank steak/salad...who would have thought??  To make things easier, my DH bought the FF down the street while I sauteed the veggies (I added mushrooms too).  I didn't use the beans or use the ranch dressing..it didn't appear to need it.

I sauteed the veggies longer than the meat, as I like them tender. I also used an Italian Dressing Mix dressing from this site. I left out the fries, forgot the beans and tomatoes, but this was excellent. I get cravings just thinking about it.

WOW!, what a great dish. Made for dinner as a main course. The only thing I didn't do was the fries, I omitted it from the recipe. It was a wonderful meal. Will definitely make again...

Hubby's not a cheese person, so his portion was served without, however, the kids really enjoyed this very different salad. Great Dinah!

This recipe was perfect!  My boyfriend had always spoke lovingly of this salad and I was glad to find it was so easy to make with this recipe.  He did add ketchup over the dressing, which looked awful but tasted great.

This is a very interesting main-dish salad!  I consider it a "Fusion" resipe based on Philly Cheese Sandwiches, served with fries.  I think some reviewers must have been confused.  The recipe didn't say to use a combination of the two dressings, but gave an "OR", choice.

Used sirloin instead of flank steak.  Substituted frozen curly fries with the Simple Oven Fries recipe from this site.  Think next time I will marinate steak but not the onions and pepper.  Recipe can easily be customized to suit individual tastes.

I'm giving four stars because I really liked the sweatness the italian dressing gave the steak, onions and peppers. I didn't have curly style french fries just regular frozen french fries. I didn't care for the french fries on the salad I ended up taking them off and eating them seperate. I left the garbanzos beans out.

This was so good! I didn't think I liked it at first, but once the steak, onions, & peppers warmed up the rest of the lettuce (and I don't like warm lettuce usually), it was very tasty!
We used a good spring lettuce mix from Trader Joe's, tons of peppers & onions..would definately make again!

We really like this. Might try with baking my own fries next time to make it healthier. Kept the cheese to a minimum. Very yummy, and if the fries get a little soft or soggy, it just makes it easier to fork them with the rest of the salad!

This was okay. The combo of Italian and Ranch dressing was a bit odd.  I think we would have liked it better if I'd sauteed the veggies and meat in butter instead.

Marinating the steak in italian dressing really added flavor. I am shocked to see how many people don't use the fries!! Try them...it makes the whole salad. Funny thing is you can order this off any menu in Pennsylvania!!!

I thought this was a pretty good and different salad.  I might use a better piece of steak next time...I thought it could have been a little less chewy.  The curly fries can be left off and it would still be good.  I would make this again.

Many, many, many, many, MANY thumbs up for this one!  I made it for clients at work... I typically need recipes that double/quadruple easily.  I made this recipe for 40 people quickly and efficiently and got tons of compliments.  I made it as listed, I just used bags of lettuce from the store instead of heads of lettuce.  Very yummy!

I am from Pennsylvania and this salad is on all of the menus.  It is a staple in our area and delish.  We also have it with grilled chicken or fried fish.  Yummo!!  You have to have the fries on it too.  We don't go to the trouble of sauteing any veggies.  Sometimes they put hard boiled egg on too.  You must try it!!!

Ok, I am from Pennsylvania and I am huge Philadelphia sports fan…and let me just say this salad is awesome!  It really is like eating a Philly Cheese Steak without all the guilt.  I added some sautéed fresh mushrooms and roasted garlic, and left off the garbanzo beans.  In this area, some would also call this a Pittsburgh steak salad…what ever you call it, it is delicious!  Believe it or not, the french fries make the salad!

It was okay, didn't necessarily taste bad, but i won't be making it again.  It reminded me of someone just mixing a whole meal all together and saying "it's a salad"

This was a sassy little dish. I came to it with raised eyebrows, but all the textures and flavors worked. You have to be sure your fries are done up nice and crispy, though. And don't let the salad sit before you serve it. Soggy fries are not happy fries. In fact, why don't you just toss a few fries on after you dish up the salad?

Based on flavor alone, I'd probably give this a 3, meat and cheese, how can you go wrong?  The deal breaker here was discovering that the curly frys are *within* rather than *akin* to the dish.  As such, rather than the crisp, firm curly fries one might desire, you end up with soggy, limp, mildly tragic objects with a rather unfortunate texture.  It's just not right.

I was unsure about the combination of ingredients however, it came together very well. I wouldn't eat this all the time but would serve occasionally.

I made this dish for my hubby for his birthday for two reasons: 1-he is a huge fan of the big salad and 2-he loves philly cheesesteak sandwiches. Can I just tell you, we both LOVED this salad??? I was skeptical about putting fries on a salad..but it was great! I will totally make this salad again.

This was really tasty and easy.  Since it is only two of us at home, I used a couple skirt steaks instead of the flank, thinly sliced on the bias.  I used a combination of romaine hearts and spinach for better nutrition. My husband thought the curly fries were wierd in a salad, but since he cleaned his plate, I guess it wasn't too much of an oddity!  I am keeping this one to serve for guests because it tastes good, and seems healthy and is unusual.

The individual components were great; the combination was only so-so.

Nothing to write home about. I would probably make it again but it wasn't anything out of this world. I think the meat needed a little more flavor.

A little high in sodium, but it was easy to prepare and my husband and I loved it.  Good flavors.

This is really good. I loved the french fries in the salad. The dressing was delicious.

Love all of the flavors!  I'd leave out the garbanzo beans next time - a bit of a disconnect for me . . . but yummy!

I liked everything about this salad except for the meat.  I'm not all that familiar with different cuts of meat, so maybe this cut is meant to be a little big tough/chewy, but the salad would have been a lot better with a nice tended bite of steak in it.

My husband regarded me dubiously when I presented him with a salad that had curly fries and garbanzo beans in it, however, he was hooked at the first bite! This is a fun, easy recipe that we will definitely have again!

We LOVE salads like this, so I knew it was gonna be a hit! I did use my own baked fries instead of the curly fries. I dressed this up for Valentine's Day by topping them with grape tomato 'hearts', which were super cute and the kids loved them. Great flavors and a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This salad is great!  I usually just use sliced leftover grilled steak, added after sauteeing the onions and peppers.  It's strange but so good.  The kids call it silly salad because it has fries.
