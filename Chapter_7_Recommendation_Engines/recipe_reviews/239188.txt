Well I should have gone with my intuition here. I was sort of taken aback that this recipe should call for "1 pound of ground beef or more to taste." As it happens the massive amount of milk called for made beef soup. I ended up adding an additional pound of beef and another 2/3 cup of grits -- to texture not to taste... and I still felt it was a little loose. Flavor wise this meatloaf is unimpressive at best. Perhaps if I hadn't had to double the meat and triple the grits it would have been better but the cocktail sauce might have been overpowering too. I couldn't get excited about this meal despite the fact that I think grits in meatloaf is conceptually brilliant. No applause from the peanut gallery either. I am inspired to experiment with them in the future.

I made some variations with ingredients I had on hand. Instead of cocktail sauce, I used Worcestershire sauce (same amount). Instead of grits, I used corn meal. I also found it to be a little soupy (with 1.3 lbs of meat) so I added an extra egg. Cooked it for an hour. It turned out very tasty and my family even liked it! I'll definitely be making this again.

After reading the reviews I decided to use 2 lbs meat. On the rest of the ingredients I just used my judgement on how much extra to put in. Turned out really good. I was not expecting this to tast just like regular meatloaf but it did. I ll definitely be doing this again.

Tastes great! I made it with 2 pounds so added some of the listed ingredients but it has good flavor!

I thought this was delicious and easy especially for being gluten free. It was pretty soupy though I'll have to either add more meat or some gluten free bread crumbs. We'll be making this again though!
