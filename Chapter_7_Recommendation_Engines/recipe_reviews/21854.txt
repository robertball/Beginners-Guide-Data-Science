I used 16 oz. coleslaw mix, a coarsely chopped onion, 4 medium potatoes and Healthy Choice Kielbasa diced in one inch pieces.  Substituted chicken stock for water and baked covered for 50-60 minutes.  Served with mustard on the side.  Will definitely make this again.

I loved this recipe on a cold February night.  I added carrot, onions, garlic salt, and pepper.  I also dissolved a chicken boullion cube in the water before mixing the ingredients together.  It had great flavor!! This took longer to cook though, maybe an hour.

This receipe was easy to prepare but somewhat bland.  Should definitely be covered (not mentioned in recipe)to prevent cabbage from drying and tips scorching.  Ended up taking it out of the oven and cooking on stove top.

My family really liked this recipe.  I did add carrots and used chicken stock instead of water.  I also sauteed the sausage in a skillet to get rid of some of the fat before putting it into the oven.  Overall, this was very easy and tasted great.

I can't really figure out why so many people left low ratings.  There are no spices in the recipe so if you don't like bland food ...... spice it up!!!!  I left out the taters and added carrots, onions, fresh thyme and 3 cloves of chopped garlic.  I also replaced the water with veggie broth.  A SUPER EASY AND YUMMY DINNER!!  BTW - we cooked 45 min and it was perfect.  Thanks!

The directions are misleading, as 1 cup of water was not nearly enough. When I checked the dish's progress half way through, much of the cabbage was a bit burnt, and the potatoes not done at all. I added water and waited a half hour, and the potatoes were barely tender. Next time, I'll try this in a crock pot.

I liked this one-pot dinner---starch, veggie, & meat all in one. However, it was very, very bland...even sprinkled liberally with my husband's spice mixture! Basic salt & pepper also helped alot! But that being said, it is one of those dishes that can easily be customized to taste, spices, ingredients. I subbed sliced carrots for the cabbage because I didn't want to run to the store & had carrots on hand. I will make this again with cabbage. (I know, I know, change a major ingred. in the recipe and still rate it...as is it is probably a 3 star recipe but I bumped it to 4 because of my subsitition). PS Also added more water than called for (about a cup more)and I cooked on 350 for about an hour. I added the sausage in the last 30 min. so that it wouldn't be too dry or burn.

This recipe was easy to make.  To prevent burning or drying the cabbage and keeping the cooking time within range, put foil over the baking dish.  I used a "light and healthy" kielbasa to lessen the grease.

The flavors are subtle, but very good.  I would suggest a bit of sour cream on top.  I sprinkled a little garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper on top before putting into the oven.  Also, it took an hour to cook - maybe covering with foil will help.  This recipe is sinfully easy and makes a great amount of food.  Perfect for the working woman who depends on leftovers!

I use this recipe except I use canned ham patties , with or without cheese  , & simply chop it all & fry like you would potatoes (slowly with just a little water in the bottom or the cabbage will burn ), then season with salt & a good bit of ground pepper . Onion or any sort of fresh pepper make great add-ins , as does grated cheese . Out of 6 kids , only 1 wont eat it , the others cant get enough .

Being from New England, my mother prepared this dish quite often.  She always included onions and carrots to give it flavor and would sometimes use ham instead of kielbasa.  She boiled all ingredients in a dutch oven until the vegetables were tender and served it with pickled peppers on the side.

This is a basic version of a New England dinner.  Traditionally, it's a boiled dinner, which would ixnay the dried/burnt cabbage some people complained about.  Others mentioned blandness-a dinner like this is supposed to to get its flavor from the meat, soaked into the veggies; it's not meant to be an in-your-face flavor dish.  I like to add baby carrots, garlic, thyme and S&P.  Perhaps a bayleaf.  These changes bump it up to four stars for me.

This turned out delicious! I used Hillshire Farms Lite Kielbasa and cut it up into small cubes. (The photo had me confused. The author says to dice the kielbasa but the photo shows otherwise.) If you dice the kielbasa the flavor comes out. Using Lite kielbasa, I didn't find the dish greasy at all. I added some black pepper, a little bit of garlic powder and a splash of wine. Oh, and I had some baby carrots and turnip laying around so I those in. We loved it! We will definitely make this again. I'm going to try angelhair coleslaw mix (just cabbage) with those bagged, pre-diced potatoes sometime for an easy dinner.

Too much for a 9 x13 pan.  The potatoes were not cooked even after an hour.  Some of the cabbage was burned on the top but that was okay.  Very bland tasting.  We won't use this one again.

If you want a 5 star recipe add a couple peeled carrots and maybe a half teaspoon of mixed pickling spice.  Even better.  You could also use ham instead of the kielbasa.  Fill your plate and cover the piping hot vegies with butter.  When you finish, put on your jammies and crawl up onto the couch.  Talk about comfort food!  Sweet dreams.

This was a simple recipe to put together, but probably not one I would make again. I substituted chicken broth for the water, put all the ingredients in the baking dish and poured the broth over top. I also seasoned with salt and pepper. It wasn't really good or bad, just average.

This was still not done after an hour in a 400 degree oven.  We covered it the first 30 minutes and left it uncovered the rest.  I had to scoop it out of the baking pan and finish cooking it in a frying pan on the stove.  The flavor was really good, though.  I thought the idea of baking it sounded good instead of all the fried versions. Thanks anyway!

Very tasty and good comfort food.  We sauteed an onion with the sausage first, then the cabbage and two cloves of garlic.  Added a healthy dose of black pepper, then two carrots.  Baked for an hour, stirring a couple times and using a lid the last 30 minutes.  Served with sour cream.  Filling and satisfying.

We enjoyed this dish!  I had read the reviews prior to trying it, and I took to heart the reviews that stated that this was bland.  Prior to baking, I seasoned with salt and pepper to taste.  I also mixed in dijon mustard (we love mustard in this house!), covered with foil and baked for 30 minutes.  Also, I substituted Sam Adams beer for the water, just for the extra oomph.  A great, easy meal!  Thank you!

This is a great base for a good recipe, thats why I gave it 4 stars with the following changes. I sauteed the kielbasa in onions and 2T olive oil, and a few shakes of worchester.  Then I used chicken broth instead of water and added more worchester to the mixture. This recipe also needs A LOT of seasoning.  I used garlic powder, salt and pepper.  I covered it and cooked it for 40 minutes and then cooked it uncovered for 20 more minutes because the potatoes took a long time to cook.   I also suggest eating it with mustard.   With these additions, this is a great easy dinner.

I've been making this dish for years; but I always add onion and carrots.
Also I cook it on top of the stove; never in the oven.

Per other suggestions, I dissolved a chicken bouillon cube in the cup of (warm) water.  I also added an onion, a small apple, a generous sprinkling of black pepper, and half a package of hot dogs which we had in the fridge.  I covered the dish and baked it for about 45 minutes.  My husband and son loved this casserole--they ate three helpings each.  My husband even said the flavor was "phenomenal."

We've made this a couple of times now and love it. Following other reviewers' suggestions, I brown and drain the kielbasa before adding to the casserole.  I also added salt & lots of freshly ground pepper.  Then I pour 2 cups of chicken broth over everything rather than 1 cup of water.  I use my stoneware casserole & lid to bake for an hour.  With my changes, I'd give it 5 stars, but I think as it is would be too bland for our tastes.

This tasted good.....but....after an hour of cooking, potatos were still not quite done.  After an hour I had to add more water, cover with foil and cooked 45 more minutes.  I expected to have this meal ready within an hour.... maybe the potatos should have been chopped smaller...mine were 1" to 1 1/2" cubes.

I thought this sounded really good, because I have a recipe similar to it that I cook on the stove top.  But this turned out bland, I had to cook it longer and then the cabbage was too dry.  We ate it, but the leftovers have been untouched in the fridge.  I will stick to my stovetop recipe.

This recipe would be great with some modification.  The dish came out greasy and bland.  The sausage should be cooked separately and some seasoning should be added.

We call this Bubble and Squeak. It is a family favorite. I usually cook it in a Dutch oven on the stovetop. I'll try it in the oven sometime. It is comfort food on a cold winter's night.

As other reviews mentioned, it is fairly bland. I cut the cabbage and potatoes in 1/2, used full sausage, onion and few  carrots. This filled my crock pot so it was hard to stir in seasonings. Even bland, my family ate this like none other. From full crock pot to one bowl leftover. I was thinking this would make a good lunch for work this week. Guess I get one lunch, maybe if it's not eaten today.

This is a good recipe to start off with... I added some fresh garlic, and carrots, chicken stock instead of water - and with all that, I'd give it a five.   I cooked it in my iron skillet on the stove top and it only took 30-35 minutes.

This recipe was just ok although I will make this again due the the health benefits of the cabbage.  This recipe does not cook the vitamins out of the cabbage.
I added sauted onion, garlic + carrots, used chicken broth instead of water.
I covered with foil to avoid burning the cabbage, had to squeeze into 9x13 ( barely fit).  Baked for 1 1/2 hrs as potatoes were not cooked @ 1 hr.
I found the benefit of this recipe was the cabbage, definitely nothing to brag about

New England Dinner Haiku: "Browned kielbasa first, and used bag of coleslaw mix, made this so easy!" We like crispy kielbasa so I browned mine first in a pan w/ a handful of chopped onions and a minced garlic clove. Dumped that in the 9X13 w/ probably wayyy less than the called-for 6 chopped potatoes (cabbage is usually a nice starch stand-in for us, so I used 2 small potatoes) and put it in the fridge in the morning ready to go for when dinnertime approached. Removed from fridge, poured on 3/4 c. chicken broth, and everything was tender and perfect, covered 20 min., uncovered 15.) No, it's not an elegant meal, and frankly is very drab looking, but it's just simple, warm and comforting.

Really good and hearty! Makes a bit too much for just my 2 person household, so I will have to scale back the recipe next time. Also, I used a bit of seasoning salt to vamp up the flavor.

Sorry but I have to say that this was bland and burnt. I had to make some MAJOR changes and was not satisfied with the oven method. First of all I sliced the kielbasa into 2" chunks. Put it on the bottom of a dutch oven with a whole onion. Then added 4 potatoes cut up into  1 and 1/2" cubes,  6 whole carrots sliced in half lengthwise. added water to cover and added 2 bay leaves, 8 peppercorns and 2 cloves of garlic, bruised. I cooked it on the stove top on med/low for 2 hours and added 1 medium  cabbage cut into 6 wedges. Cooked for an additional 20 mins until the cabbage was tender. Served it with spicy mustard and the family ate it up!

I make this but substitute bagged sauerkraut keeping the juices.  If the kraut is too much you can add chopped apple to counteract some of the bite.

I just made this for my family for dinner and was so surprised!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful!  Fast, easy and great.  The cabbage was perfectly steamed and sweet, the potatoes were moist and the sausage was great!  The kids added a little bit of butter, salt, pepper and mustard on the side.  Thank you for a great easy dinner that tastes super!

This was really good and so easy!  Following several reviews, I used a bag of cole slaw mix, 2 cups of vegetable stock instead of water, covered with foil, cooked for 45 minutes, and topped with sour cream. Very yummy! :)  (also, used turkey kielbasa)

This recipe was really good!  Both my husband and I really liked it and I will definitely be making it again.  I took previous poster advice and used chicken broth (1 can)and added celery and onions.  I also covered it and it took almost an hour to bake.  We found it very flavorful, as well as easy and satisfying.

Awesome!  I took others reviews and modified:  Used Healthy Choice Kielbasa.  Added 2 carrots and 1/2 red onion.  Tossed w/ 2 tsp. of cajun seasoning in bowl.  Poured 1.5 c. of chicken broth over mix in pan, then covered with foil.  You must bake for 1 hr. for all to be nice & tender.  Very yummy , and super healthy too!

My husband loved it although I took the advise of all the recipes.  I used 1 1/2 cans chicken broth, added two carrots, covered w/ foil and baked for 1 hour.  It turned out perfect!  Easy!  And great on a frigid night!

Sorry...didn't pass the picky boyfriend test :)  I thought it was OK, but the baked kielbasa didn't really do it for me.  I like my kielbasa a little crispier.
