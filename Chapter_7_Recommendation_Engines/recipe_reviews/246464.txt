I have never made a custard before, I didn't have a metal bowl so I just used a small sauce pan. It turned out amazing!

Those reviewers who said there wasn't enough are doing something wrong. The eggs need to be whisked constantly - without stopping - until the custard is cooked. This puts air into itwhich makes it very light and greatly increases the volume - similar to wglhipped cream ir meringue. It also accounts for the pale white color. Using an electric hand mixer set on medium works great. I highly recommend using a double boiler setup to avoid scrambling the eggs. I made with 4 yolks and it was plenty for 4 deserts with a bit left over.

On top of being fast and easy, this was absolutely delicious! I did substitute diluted balsamic vinegar for the wine since I don't drink wine. I used the double boiler method to make the custard and it worked like a charm. I will definitely be making this again!

All time favorite, quick dessert? Probably!! I (and my S.O.) can't get enough of this stuff. He requests nearly every other night as a post-dinner treat! It's great because I always have the ingredients on hand, so as long as I have some strawberries prepped, I can have this on the table in less than 10 minutes. I have tried this recipe with other fruits, but strawberries pair so well with the marsala, I think it's a critical ingredient.

This was so easy and so good! The video shows torching the tops, and I HIGHLY recommend this step (based on the photo, I thought it was a dusting of cinnamon on top). It really adds dimension to the flavor profile.  Also, I was a bit nervous setting my metal bowl over a direct flame, but just keep whisking, and mine turned out just fine...just don't rush it and don't leave it unattended!

I make this all the time. People are always impressed, they think it’s something really complicated but it is so easy!!! The only drawback is people always want seconds and I never make enough. There’s a lot of bowl scraping at the end! Sometimes I blitz the top with a torch if I’m in the mood (after a sprinkle of sugar). But it’s great as is with or without a torch.

I'm not sure if it was the quality of my marsala or not, but I wasn't really impressed with the taste.   (I suspect the marsala because the only marsala I was able to find was the 'cooking marsala' at Kroger and not the real deal).

I really enjoyed making this dessert.....simple ingredients and patience will get you there.  I used the double boiler method for the custard.  I could not find dry Marsala, so I used regular Marsala.  I am going to cut back a little on the Marsala next time for a more delicate flavor.... I think the issue Is that I don't have DRY Marsala.  I am going to get a torch to use for next time also....seems that it makes a difference.

This was easy and delicious and beautiful! I used a double boiler but I did whisk by hand like Chef John suggests. Just when you feel like your arm might fall off, keep going it’s almost there. Lol it was an impressive dessert and I will make it again!!!

I made this tonight for dessert.  It is really good.  There could have been more custard, so next time I will double the recipe  for the two deserts. (Those desert glasses in the photo must be VERY small.)  My hubby and I agreed that next time there should be more custard because there was only a few bites for each of us on our strawberries.  I used a Mochetto wine instead of white wine which worked great!  I will make this again.  It was a lot easier to make than I expected.  I DID whip it without stopping, until cooked!

I followed the directions, and it looked nothing like the photo. It hardly made enough to cover the strawberries in two small dessert dishes. It was yellow, not pale white like the photo. It was delicious, but not as attractive and plentiful as the photo.
