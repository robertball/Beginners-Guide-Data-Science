This is a very good dressing that uses healthy fats.  I tasted the dressing before adding the cumin, and loved it, but did not care for the cumin after adding it.  I think it's a 4 1/2 with the cumin, and a 5 star without the cumin.  But that is just my preference;try it both ways and decide for yourself.  Thank you for sharing!

Absolutely delicious blend of all flavors I love! I dipped every vegetable I had in house and when I ran out of veggies I couldn't help but eat a couple spoonfuls on its own. I used skim milk mixed w vinegar to make my own healthier buttermilk. Guilt free, healthy and oh so good. Thanks for sharing!

This was a fantastic salad dressing.  When I went to get my avocado, it had gone bad, so I substituted mayonnaise.  We all loved it.  I can just imagine how much better it would be with the avocado.  Thanks, jesnmeg.

I didn't have lime juice so I used lemon juice. Also just threw in a few spoonfuls of sour cream and a bit of mayo, no cumin. I'm sure it would be delicious without the additions. I love it!

Great as a salad dressing, a dip, or a sandwich spread!  I thinned mine a bit with Grapeseed oil, but otherwise stayed with the recipe.

This is a delicious and versatile dressing/sauce.  I used it on chalupas and also on salads.  The directions said to use a blender, but I used a small food processor instead, which I think works better.  I also used more cilantro, as well, because I had a nice crop growing in my herb garden.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as shown.  Very tasty.  I will definitely make this again.

I took out the jalapeno pepper, the cilantro and the cumin.  I don't like spicy things much.  It was the best dip I have made using avocado.

Wow!  This is an amazing dressing/dip!  The flavors are super together.  I made a double batch because my jalapeno was large and I am glad I did.  Will definitely make this over and over.  Thanks for the great recipe!
