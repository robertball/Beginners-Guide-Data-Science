i absolutely love these cookies. and i am not usually a fan of peanut butter cookies. the recipe is perfect the way it is, but usually instead of putting chocolate on top of the cookies after they cook i roll chocolate chips into the dough when i am making the dough into balls. also i have made these without vanilla extract simply b/c i didn't have any vanilla at the time, and they still tasted great. such a simple, great tasting, and easy to make recipe.

I have mixed reviews about this cookie. For ease and convenience, it gets 5 stars. For taste, 3 stars. My husband and boys gave it an over-all 4 stars. The taste is a soft and extremely mild, peanut butter sugar cookie. When mixing the batter, it was quite thin. I only use the reduced fat Bisquick, so I added an extra 1/2 cup or so to thicken it up. It was still quite thin, so I put it in the fridge for about 24 hours. It thickened up very nicely was I was able to roll it into balls. They baked very well, about 9 minutes. I may make them again.
