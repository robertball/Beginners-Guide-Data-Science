YUM, YUM, YUM!  This recipe couldn't have come at a better time--my bananas were BEGGING me to use them for something.  I have tried some of the other popular banana bread recipes on this site, but always went back to my wonderful old standby.  I decided to give this one a try, and I am SO GLAD I did!  It came out of the oven smelling heavenly, and I cut a slice right away (burned my mouth eating it too!).  THIS IS EXCELLENT!  I did make a couple of changes--I used 1/3 cup canola oil for the shortening (healthier), and I used all brown sugar, because I like when the cake looks darker.  Those changes worked out just fine!  I think the oat flour adds an interesting flavor.  Thanks sooooo much, Verona!

This cake had a great banana flavor.  It was moist and dense, for the most part.  I found that the 8x8 square pan was too small.  It made for a very deep cake that didn't cook in the middle.  I left it in the oven for 15 extra minutes and the edges were getting a little too dark by the time the center was cooked enough.  Since the directions mentioned vanilla even though the ingredient list did not, I added 1 tsp.  I also used butter instead of shortning - just a personal preference.  My biggest quibble was with the topping - way too much and way too dry.  I'd cut everything to 1/3 but the butter.  With those adjustments, I would definitely make this again.

Great crunchy outside/moist inside banana cake!  I made some slight changes to the original recipe:  I add an additional half cup of mashed banana and prepared the topping with oat flour instead of rolled oats (that I happened not to have) and the result was just perfect.  Plus add cinnamon to the topping (1 full soup spoon)

This is spectacular! I took some advice from other posts and added 50% more banana. I also used half shortening, half butter in the cake. It was moist, caramel-y, crunchy and delicious. It would be a terrific coffee cake, too.

This cake is really delicious.  I used a stick of margarine instead of the shortening, and it turned out moist and yummy.  This one's a keeper.

I give this a top rating due to the others who have reviewed it before me.  I used canola oil, as one reviewer said, and I did cut the topping down to 1/3 cup on all ingredients except the butter, and it was perfect!!  This was so delicious and the oat flour (which is super simple to make) gave it such a yummy nutty flavor which I love, especially since my husband and son both have nut allergies and I can't use the real thing!  Great recipe!

I have been making this recipe for many years and I ALWAYS have rave reviews.  I do cut the topping in half, or double the cake recipe.  I agree with the others--two much topping for the small cake.  I also add chocolate chips to the batter.  Delicious!

This recipe makes a very moist cake. The crumb topping was different but it made the Cake. Will make this often to get rid of old bananas.

This cake was easy to make but a little dry.  Also, if you read the directions.  The ingredients does not list vanilla but when reading the recipe, it does.  Also, it isn't very sweet.

This is soooo good!  I have been making this recipe for over 40 years.  I get compliments all the time when I make it.  Some have complained about dryness.  Everyone should remember, a recipe is a guide.  Not all ovens are calibrated to the exact temperature and not all measurements of ingredients are exactly the same.  Some individuals will pack their flour more than others, which will dry out a cake due to more, bananas might not be ripe enough or some may use bananas that are overly ripe, etc. all this can affect the outcome of your cake.

Big hit at this house.  I was out of shortening so I subbed 1/3 cup of canola oil instead.  I baked this in a 11 3/4 x 7 1/2 size pan and it was perfect thickness and the topping was a perfect amount.  I froze a few pieces of this after it cooled and they defrosted nicely and the topping stayed crunchy.  If you have "spotty" bananas to use up, this is a wonderful recipe.

I did not care for this cake.  I followed the recipe as stated.  The bake time listed was not long enough so by the time the cake was cooked in the middle it was dry.  There was WAY too much topping which became overcooked.  I won't try this one again.

altered the recipe a bit.  Used 1 stick butter instead of shortening and reduced oats to 1/2c. for topping.  The cake was not quite banannary enough for me.  I will increase bananna's to 1 1/2 c. next time.

What a wonderful treat! I wanted to use up some bananas, but didn't want to make a layered cake or boring old banana bread. This was very easy to make & I enjoyed the crumble on top, as well as the fact the cake wasn't too sweet. I didn't have shortening so used butter & added a few spices & it turned out amazing. Thanks for sharing this great easy recipe!

-Based on the previous reviews, I cut the crumble recipe in half... wish I hadn't ... I would recommend making the entire thing, then applying to your liking, wish I had about half of the 1/2 recipe that I was missing.  (And forgot to add cinnamon as some suggested, which sounded good.)  Some substitutes were butter for the shortening and whole wheat flour for the oat flour.  I also added 3 bananas (abt 1.5 c)  I also added 1/2 cup mini semi-sweet chocochips.  The only thing that I didnt like was too much salt.  I got the teaspoon but fell just short of putting it all in because it seemed too much...  I would probably recommend only 1/2 teaspoon, if any at all.  With all that, it was otherwise great.  The crumble takes it to a whole 'nother level as a banana bread.  I will surely make again!

Great recipe for browning bananas! I changed it a bit.. :) Oat flour was replaced by whole wheat, marg for shortening, used brown sugar rather than white in the cake, added a bit flour to the crumb mixture and then sprinkled a bit of white sugar with cinnamon over the crumbs once it was ready for the oven. The white sugar topping gives it a little crunch. 
I'm saving this recipe!!

Very nice cake.  I used old, frozen bananas and doubled the recipe so I could have some at home and take it to work as well.  I looked up how much 1 cup of bananas is--it says 3 bananas.  I don't know if that's accurate or not, but that's what I used.  People who think this is heavy may want to make sure they are using 2 cups of oat flour--I did as the submitter suggested and processed 1 1/4 c for the cup of oat flour and got a bit more, so I adjusted the flour accordingly.  This took a while longer to bake, and I changed the temp to 350, but that's all good.  Most things take a while in my oven, and all ovens are different.  My coworkers raved over this cake.  Thanks for the recipe!

I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9x13 dark pan.  The outside was dark brown, but the taste was wonderful.  Thinking about modifications for later.

This is a flavorful, moist cake. I used lite cinnamon applesauce with a little olive oil for the shortening, and brown sugar for the white sugar. Making the oat flour was a great idea. I will be adding this to my regular recipe file.

Really loved this recipe. I made a few personalized changes. Doubled walnuts in the topping and cake mixture. Used 1/2 c oats instead. Included cinnamon in the topping. Used mixture of brown and white sugar for the cake mixture. Added more banana (1.5c). Used wheat flour instead of oat flour, and bread flour instead of all-purpose (b/c that was all I had).

I had 3 very ripe bananas to use, and was looking for something other than banana breads or muffins.  This cake sounded yummy and healthy, and it was!  I also used all brown sugar, and also added 1/4 cup of ground flax seed to make it even healthier.  Will definitely make this again, a winner!!

I'm not quite sure what happened with this recipe.  I followed the recipe with the exception of pecans instead of walnuts.  The cake turned out dry and crumbly.  I will not make this cake again.

I added 3 large very ripe banana's and used brown sugar in the recipe instead of white sugar and a 1/2 cup of butter instead of shortening.  I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter and added 1/4 of melted butter to the topping to make it hold better. This was FABULOUS!  Thanks for a keeper.

My mom used to bake this cake when we were little, it was always a big hit! She got it from a quaker oats recipe book, which she has since lost, so thanks for posting this recipe! When baking this cake, I only use dark brown suger (gives it an extra kick of molasses), add a tsp or two of cinammon to the batter (besides the crunch topping) and substitute butter for the shortening and whole wheat flour for the all purpose flour (gives it a nuttier flavor and helps my stomach deal with the oats better). It makes a great breakfast cake!

I used the canola oil and that was good but will try with butter and or margarine too.  I liked the crunch topping and I did not feel it had too much.  This cake is not real sweet which would make it a good batter for muffins.  I used pecans instead of walnuts because I happpened to have them on hand.  However, I prefer the taste of walnuts when combined with oats.  Probably would add more walnuts to the topping mixture when I make this again.  I like this recipe.  I think you could do a lot of variations with it.

We loved it!  I used all brown sugar as was recommended and only 1/2 cup oats in the topping.  Also put it in a 9x9 pan, which was perfect - I wouldn't go larger than that.  It was moist and tasty. The topping made it.  Without that, it would just taste like extra moist banana bread.

This was really good.  Still tastes like banana bread, not really a cake.  It's a little sweet for me, but good.

I made this for friends & everyone loved it.  I followed the recipe except I used a stick of margarine instead of the shortening.  Cake came out perfectly moist & the kids loved it too!! Easy recipe & a nice change from plain old banana bread.

I made this in a jelly roll pan & it came out like bars.  Pretty good.
