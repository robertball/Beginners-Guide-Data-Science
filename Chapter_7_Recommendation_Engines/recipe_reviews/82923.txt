This is a great recipe!  Thanks for sharing.  I did make a few additions as others did.  The great thing about this recipe is you can tailor it to your tastes without any problem.  I used a whole onion.  I added celery, shredded carrots as well as basil, oregano, marjoram, cayenne pepper and a few red pepper flakes.  As a final touch I added some thinly sliced smoked sauasge.  And as always, when I make any soup I use boxed chicken stock.  It is so much more flavorful than boullion or broth and not nearly as salty.  After simmering together for less than an hour it tasted like it had cooked all day.  So flavorful and wonderful!!! Will definitely make again.

I made this soup for its healing benefits, but I ended up loving it so much I'd make it anytime! It truly is "healing" and not just for cold/flu season, but this could also greatly benefit those with certain digestive conditions. (Cabbage being excellent for stomach ulcers, for one thing.) I found the amount of cabbage in the original recipe to be just right and did not add extra as other reviewers did. I did however, increase the onion to a whole medium-sized onion instead of just half, and used 4 garlic cloves instead of 2. I also added a little Italian seasoning to it, a pinch of cayenne, and a little black pepper.

So yummy and easy!!!!  I only gave it a 4 because once you make it your own it's a 5 star!!!!  I did not use any oil, I used olive oil cooking spray to cooked 1 large onion and 1 TBS crushed garlic.  Added water, all bullion, 2 stalks of celery, 20 baby carrots cut up, 1 potatoe, tom. w/ juice in can, 1 tsp cayenne pepper, and 1/2 tsp italian seasoning.  i thought the amount of cabbage called for was PERFECT!!!  I did have to add an additional 1 1/2c of water thr. out cooking.   Thank you for the great easy recipe!!!  I'm guessing left overs will be wonderful tommorow after the flavors have intensified!!!  Thanks for sharing!!  This will rock this summer when i have those left over veggies from the garden i'm not sure what to do with!!!!!  My boyfriend loved it as well which is a big plus as he's not a huge veggie guy 8 - )

9/2013 I've made this many times and love it. Whenever I can, I add some kind of protein... usually beans (pinto, garbanzo, black...doesn't matter). The other option is serving over some leftover  shredded chicken. It may just be soup, but with a little thought the nutritional value is excellent.

I found this recipe to be perfect as written. It is not supposed to be a thick soup, but a consume based one. I think there is confusion about how much cabbage to add because they do vary in size alot.  Maybe trying to pin down a weight (like 1/2 of a 2 lb head) would give a little more guidance. Thanks for a great recipe!

Wow, is this a great soup! Absolutely our new favorite comfort food! I used chicken broth instead of water and also added some baby carrots and canned corn to my pot. I have made this several times now and it always turns out fabulous... is even better the next day. Eat with some crusty french bread and it's heaven! Thanks so much for the great recipe!

I decided to try this last night since I'm fighting a cold.  It was delicious!  I did make a few changes though, which is why I only gave it four stars.  

I used 8 chicken bouillon cubes instead of 4, plus I added extra herbs & a pinch of red pepper flakes as someone suggested.  I substituted 1/2 tsp. onion powder for the onion and used more garlic than called for.  Since I left out the onion, I only needed 1 tsp. of olive oil to sautee the garlic.  

We served the soup with some French bread brushed with olive oil and sprinkled with garlic salt & Parmesan cheese then toasted.  It was an excellent meal!

It seems like a good base for what could be a great soup. I read a lot of reviews that say it tastes even better the next day and I'm looking forward to that.
 
I used canned chopped tomatoes and added the juice in (didn't want to waste it) and I'm glad I did, it definitely added to what would otherwise be a relatively plain broth. I think it's lacking in some dimension ... perhaps more veggies or another spice). 

That being said ... I'm sitting on my couch, wrapped in a blanket eating/drinking this soup with a box of tissues next to me and I already feel like it's giving my cold a run for it's money!  I'm not tossing this soup out!

we loved this soup.  As others did, I changed it a bit.  I used maybe 1/2-1 T of oil.  I used a 48 oz can of low-fat/low sodium chicken broth and one C of water with 1 boullion cube.  I added about a cup of carrotes diced and 3 stalks of celery diced (which I sauteed with the onions).  I used the liquid from the tomatoes, too.  Oh, I added 2 whole cloves of garlic instead of chopping and sauteeing with the onion.  We may try it next time with only 1 clove or leave it out all together.

try 1 to 2 quarts of low sodium vegetable, chicken, or beef broth instead of the water and bullion cubes..Can also add sliced mushrooms for a little different flavor.

Even though I'm not big on soup, I enjoyed my first bowl of it tonight.  I used half chicken broth & half water, because I don't like strong broth.  Also used a whole onion & whole cabbage, & plain stewed tomatoes; added Italian seasoning & omitted salt.  If I do it again I would use fresh plum tomatoes in place of canned, because I prefer to stay with whole foods & avoid added sugar, salt, high fructose corn syrup, etc.  This is definitely a nice way to use cabbage.  Will probably do this one again.  I gave it a 4 because of the use of convenience ingredients which are not healthy.

Excellent recipe!  Like the other users, I used 2 qts. chicken broth (cage-free, of course) instead of the water and chicken bouillon and added carrots, celery and a handful of spices (oregano, basil, etc.) and tripled the amount of onion.  I might add lima beans next time to make it a bit more filling, while keeping it lo-cal and nutritious.

Several days after coming home from surgery, I sent my husband to the grocery store with lettuce on the list. Well the angels were watching over him & he came home with cabbage instead. I found this recipe which contained ingredients I had, or had reasonable substitutes. And with a name like that how could I resist? My "I'm not a cook" husband chopped all the veggies and it was easy enough for me to put it all together. We just finished it and it was great. So comforting. Real food. I feel better already.
I used 2 tablespoons olive oil which was enough. With the onion (used a whole small one) and garlic, I also cooked some celery and green pepper. I used "better than bouillon chicken base" which I use in place of bouillon in all my soups. 1/2 teaspoon pepper was just right for us but 1/2 teaspoon salt was plenty. I thought I'd want more than 1/2 of the large cabbage I had--but 1/2 was fine. I used diced tomatoes with balsamic vinegar, basil & olive oil.  It turned out great.

LOVED IT!!!!!!   I read every rating beforehand and took advice of others. first I did not use much olive oil, maybe 1 1/2 tb. When I added the water and bouillon, I also added carrots, oregano, thyme, basil, and just a dash of chili powder, salt and pepper.I used a can of regular stewed tomatoes and just choped those up. It turned out excellent!! I will make often! Very inexpensive.

I just made this recipe tonight.  It is probably one of my top 10.... the best/easiest thing you could ever wish for!!  Instead of bouillon cubes and the two quarts of water, I used only two cans of reduced sodium chicken broth, because after making this recipe a few times, I realized that I prefer it have much less liquid.  I did not add salt, and added 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper flakes as well for a kick.  The thing about having less liquid in this soup is that it can be served as soup, or other times you may prefer to drain away some of the liquid and actually serve it as a tasty side to any simple pork chop or chicken dish.  I make this at least once a month and it's enough for 8 servings for us, even with the reduced liquid.  At times, I use only ONE can of chicken broth when I know that I plan on serving this as a side dish and not a soup.  It's still every bit as delicious!

I was skeptical at first that so few ingredients could make a good soup.  I was pleasantly surprised how good this is.  I used red cabbage to get more nutritional bang and added red kidney beans for protein.  The red cabbage turned the soup a pretty burgundy!

I did make a number of changes, although I suspect that the soup would be wonderufl as posted.  I list my modifications so that others may benefit from my experience; as others have said, this recipe is perfect for local tailoring!

I began by browning chunks of lean pork (I used cubed boneless country-style "ribs") in olive oil with the garlic and onion .... and generous sprinkling of herbs de provence.  Once the pork cubes were brown, I added three bags of slaw mix, one large can of chicken broth, and three cans of diced Italian-style tomatoes.  This I simmered for about 45 mins.  Then, with the heat OFF, I stirred in about two cups of frozen peas (which were able to cook in the residual heat).   Oh ... I also added a genrous sprinkle of fresh-ground pepper.  Yum.  Relatively low-fat and relatively low-sodium!  Today was the second day I carried it to my office for lunch.  Don't think I'll be tired of it by Friday!

Sorry to be so long-winded ... and to have deviated so much from the original recipe, but I wanted to share my delight in my new soup discovery!

Great Stuff! I added some red pepper as well as one of the other reviewers. Very tasty soup. Excellent for using up all the cabbage in the garden.  I didn't have parmesan cheese though. I guess I will try it like that next time. This will be one of our stapels in our house.

I LOVED this recipe.  It's one I'll be making again soon.  I used more like a full head of cabbage, and since I didn't have Italian tomatoes, I used plain and added Italian seasonin as some other users had suggested.  I also added some Red Pepper as another user suggested to give it a little more kick.  The entire pot was gone in about two meals time!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is very similar to a recipe I use. I use a little less broth and add a pinch of Italian seasoning and cayenne and I top it with a sprinkle of parmesan cheese. I also use coleslaw mix to avoid all the shredding. This is a good filling and low calorie soup with plenty of fiber.

Great basis for a cabbage soup. Added 5 garlic cloves, 1 whole onion, 1 red and 1 yellow pepper, sm. box sliced mushrooms, sauté all these veggies together in olive oil. Used 4 cups chicken broth, 2 cans rotel Tom. Whole head of cabbage. Had a pound of sausage that I boiled in a separate pan for 5 mins. Drained then rinsed in cold water. All grease is gone! Added to soup, half tsp. Hotshot, dash red pepper flakes. Simmer altogether about an hour. Delicious!

Delicious! But I found a few more ways to cut some of the calories off. First, I didn't use any oil (I just put the onion in the water/chicken broth mixture) and since I had no canned tomatoes on hand, simply used two small chopped ones. I still found it delicious, and have made it two times more since.

This was really good- I was skeptical since it IS cabbage soup, but it surprised me!  We'll definitely make this again.  I did add a can of garbanzo beans because I wanted some protein and I knew my 18month old would eat those.  Didn't take away from the tastiness, but added said protein!

This recipe came at a perfect time.  I needed to use up a pkg of slaw mix and the date was going to expire.  The only changes I made (and you could do a lot of personalizing on this one)were to add celery, a little more onion and diced carrot and subst one can of chicken broth for part of the water in addition to the granules. And I used the entire can of tomatoes and pureed them before adding them to the soup. Also added a scoop of cooked rice to each seving.  This is great if you are sick or well and it would be very soothing if you are sick with cold/flu.  Thanks, JG from Susie

An outstanding recipe to add your own flair to. I took the basic recipe and also added: 1) 1 bunch of green onions, chopped; 2) 1 can each of red kidney and cannellini beans (drained); 3) 3 sliced chicken apple sausage links; 4) more herbs (parsley, basil, italian seasoning, celery seed), and 5) 1/4 tsp cayenne for zip. Had amazing flavor and made my stomach happy. Even better the next day.

My hubby and kids ate this right up.  A little on the salty side though.  I think just with the chicken cube seasoning alone has plenty of salt.  Next time I will omitt the added salt.  Didn't have stewed tomatoes so I blended my own fresh tomatoe.  Thanks.  This was a warm and comfort soup for us stuck at home with a cold!

I'm impressed. It's a simple recipe that creates a flavorful, light soup, perfect for a lunch.  the only thing is that it is a bit on the oily side.  maybe a tbs less would be better.

Really delicious soup! I added corn to the soup to give it a little more bulk. Also, to make it a little thicker, I took about half of the soup, put it in the blender, pureed it, and added it back to the stock pot. This really helped with the texture. I also let it simmer, uncovered, for about 2 hours to thicken it up as well. Overall, it was very tasty and cheap to make too, which was great for a starving college student.

So so yummy!!!  This is my second time making it. first time I added extra garlic, Italian seasoning the whole onion and the whole cabbage and it turned out excellent. This time I boiled chicken first to make the stock and the same additions as the first time and served with rice on the side since my husband doesn't eat soup by itself and it turned out amazing.  This is a great recipe by itself or with extras. You can't go wrong as long as you like cabbage like me.  SO SO GOOD AND GOOD FOR YOU!!!!!!

Oh my!  This is excellent!  The only differences I made were to cut up some baby carrot (as suggested) that I had in the fridge, 3 stalks of celerey, 6-14 1/2 cans of broth and a whole head of cabbage.  I used a can of Italian seasoned diced tomatoes.  I'm eating it right now and on my second bowl.  It is delicious!!!  I left the seasoning the same.  What a great recipe!

I was attracted to this recipe because I am pregnant, feeling sick and horribly constipated. LOL 
I definitely followed Taylor's and others' suggestions to add different ingredients here and there. I added: Black peppercorns, salt, pepper,. balsamic vinegar, paprika, italian seasonings, celery, carrots, potato, cooked onions and garlic,  ketchup, and also some chicken bouillion and even plain spaghetti sauce, as I didn't have any tomatoes. I thought it was delicious! I will make this again.

I'm a cabbage fanatic and made hubby meatloaf for dinner and I don't like so decided to whip up something that would be nice and warm...this fit the bill.  I had the Italian diced tomatoes and also added 1 roma tomato that was starting to look kind of sad.  I used Swanson chicken broth w/roasted garlic (it's really good canned broth) and then some chicken bouillon/water.  I had some baby carrots I had made and couldn't choke down on their own (balsamic carrots) so threw those in, and I had one lonely turnip down in the crisper so diced that up and threw in.  Put this on the stove while I whipped up a batch of cookies and was done by the time the first batch came out of the oven....I did have to add a little more salt to mine but that's personal preference.  Also added a bit of harissa chile powder for some 'heat'.  This could easily be embellished with the 'clean out the fridge' bunch of veggies.  lo to no fat and very, very healthy.

I've never made cabbage soup before. It was my son's idea to make cabbage soup. And since he doesn't eat many veggies, we had to make it! I made it as it was written. Except he wanted to add some carrots and green beans and I had some fresh mushrooms to use up. It was SO good. My son ate it up!

I really like the soup and think it would most likely be just fine as instructed but due to other comments I made a few changes adding some seasoning and I used a chicken base. It was very good BUT I think I used a bit to much crushed pepper flakes. Normally we like it really hot and I'll use as much as 2 teaspoons of red flakes in a dish. lol BUT I used 1 teaspoon and maybe a pinch more in this soup and it was way hot! I mean spicy enough to have to keep a glass of water on hand! So next time a pinch or two but whoaaaa...not so much red pepper! Thank you!

I received this as a daily email from Allrecipe. I looked at it, read all the reviews and thought I like cabbage but in a soup?..Today I wanted something to make to go along with my Sunday meal making for week ahead.  Worked with what I had on hand. I used a bag of frozen seasoning vegetables (onions, celery,red and green peppers)thawed.  Minced garlic.  Do not use bouillion, so used 4 cans of chicken broth. Omitted the salt.  Added 2 carrot sliced thin. Didn't have a head of cabbage but I did have a bag of cole slaw mix. No Italian style stewed tomatoes but did have diced. Sauted the veggies,and garlic, added the black pepper, and thyme,which I put in all my soups, crushed caraway seed,because it goes good with cabbage and dash of italian spices to make up for stewed tomatoes.  Added the cole slaw.. then the tomatoes undrained.  And let it go. I ended up eating two bowls of soup and the Sunday dinner is now leftovers for during week.  This was delicious and using the short cuts made it even better and I am sure it didn't compromise the taste. Thanks for a great base..will be making this often.

Loved this but made the following additions which really kicked it up: add 2-3 chopped celery stalks and carrots (sauteed in small amount of butter), basil and used Ro-Tel tomatoes which made it have a little kick.  Oh, and I also added 3/4 cup of barley.  As recommended by others, I used chicken broth.  Delicious!

Very good recipe. I also made a few changes, but nothing that would take away from the original recipe. I used a whole onion, a small carrot sliced, and a couple stalks of celery, sliced (including the leafy tops, diced).  I found this soup to be light and tasty. It would go great with something heavier, such as a grilled cheese sandwich.

A healthy, hearty, filling and cheap soup.  Just what I was looking for.  The directions couldn't be easier, nor could the ingredients be more simple-- all that and it even tastes good.  I made a double batch and had it for lunch at work every day this week, and I'm still not tired of it.

The reviewer who suggested Parmesan cheese was right on.  When I first made the soup, I served it for dinner with a crusty French baguette that I cut into slices, basted with olive oil and garlic powder, sprinkled with a Parmesan/Romano mix and then toasted under the broiler.  I also garnished my soup with some of the cheese mixture, which was great.  

I made my soup pretty spicy by adding some Cayenne and a good amount of fresh ground black pepper.  My nose runs every time I eat it, so I'm sure this would be perfect for healing a cold.  I ate it in perfect health and on the hottest day of the year, though!  I think it's tasty anytime.

I just made this and my husband and I thought it was very good and will make it again. That being said, I looked at this recipe first because I wanted cabbage soup. I read many reviews and barely any are for the recipe. The reviews are based on using it as a base and putting in whatever you want, and still calling it this recipe. If you add a bunch of vegetables, it becomes vegetable soup. there are recipes for vegetable soup. If you put meat in it, it is no longer cabbage soup, but something else, that there  are recipes for. Obviously, everyone who changed it, wasn't really looking for cabbage soup. We all do our own thing with cooking, but I get tired of reading reviews that just change the recipes. And since they change everything, the amount of reviews becomes deceitful and misleading.

This was a really good soup.  I added chopped carrots, celery, green and red peppers to the onion and garlic as it was frying up, and then used low-sodium chicken broth instead of the water and bouillon.  I had a bag of coleslaw mix that I used for the cabbage, and as I didn't have italian-style canned tomatoes, I chopped up fresh tomatoes and added some dried basil and oregano to the soup to make up for it. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Well, I have to say, I am astonished and gratified to see such a wonderful response to my little soup recipe!  I am beyond pleased that God is blessing so many people with it.  Since the recipe as published here isn't exactly the same as the one I submitted, I am amused to see that some of the reviewers have brought it closer to my original in the changes they have made to it.  Happy eating and stay healthy!

This is sooo delicious and hearty!! It really hit the spot this cold winter night! I doubled the recipe and used red cabbage because that was what I had and I followed the recipe, for the most part, but I didn't follow it strictly because this recipe is great for personalizing. I used everything the recipe called for and added canned beans for fiber and protein and I just threw in what ever spices I felt like the soup needed from my spice cabinet (i.e. garlic and herb powder, cayenne, etc.). I really liked how a little cayenne upped the flavor of this soup. Everyone in the family loved it (even though they usually don't like the "healthy" dishes I make), but I especially loved this dish (being that I'm a health freak). Also, I threw in the tomatoes as is without draining them---I like the extra tomatoe flavor and nutrients!

I was not expecting to like this soup at all.  I just finished my 3rd bowl.  I used a can of Diced tomatoes with zesty mild green chilies, Perfect!  I also followed other suggestions of adding carrots & celery, chicken broth & just a cup of water.  I chopped half of the cabbage, then placed the remainder in the blender to thicken the soup a little.  This soup was a hit!

This is one of the easiest soups to make and it's one of my favorites. It's very tangy and fresh tasting. The veggies are not mushy as long as you don't overcook. I stop cooking when they are still nice and firm with just a little "bite" to them. I think you have to like Bloody Marys, tomato juice or V8 to enjoy this soup because it does have a lot of zing from the tomatoes and other veggies, but if you are a huge fan like me you will love it. As with any recipe here, only add salt to taste. I never trust another person's salt threshold.

I made this for dinner tonight. Oh my lordy, it was awesome. I did make a couple small changes just because of personal preference and everyone here ate two bowls at least. I added a whole leek instead of the onion because I love leeks and 4 cloves of garlic. Also, sauteed some button mushrooms with the leek and garlic. I used chicken broth and some water instead of the bouillon cubes because it was in my cabinet. And I used a whole 2 pound cabbage. It was perfect for me because I'm sick. My nephew is on a special diet and he ate three bowls. Soo happy with this. It is on the meal rotation hahaha

Once again, the simplest things are the best! Healthy, easy and economical. I doubled the recipe and used regular diced tomatoes and added 2 tsp Italian seasoning. Also added a couple of stalks of celery.  Will definitely make again.  Update - this soup freezes very well.  I found a long lost container in the freezer this morning and brought it for lunch.  It's been in the freezer for a while and I didn't have high hopes, but it was very good!

I love this soup!  Besides being delicious, what I really like is how nice it heats you up on cold nights, but isn't heavy like most "winter food."  I have made it several times now.  First, I made it as-is.  Now when I make it, I make two slight changes.  I like to add about half of the liquid from the can of tomatoes and add a little bit of sliced carrots.  The recipe is still five star as-is.  My changes are just for my personal preference.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Good. Easy. Garlicky and spicy. I used crushed tomatoes since I had no stewed tomatoes. I also used low-sodium chicken broth instead of water and bouillon to cut down on the salt.

Very good, for what it's intended to be. I used turkey stock, since I made it yesterday from a turkey carcass, so didn't need the bouillon and water. I did use a little celery, 1 small carrot, and a little red bell-pepper. Stirred in some cilantro after it was done. I held myself in restraint, and didn't add dry beans, barley, potatoes, or any other "carb," to stay true to the spirit of the recipe. This has been on my list to try for a few weeks. Thanks!  : )

Great soup. Sometimes I brown some lean ground beef first and drain off all fat, then add to soup.  I always use beef broth instead of chicken b/c it gives it more flavor.  I also saute the cabbage with the onions and garlic first before adding broth and tomatoes and use 2 cans of diced tomatoes instead of 1.  Also add sprinkle of Prudhomme's Vegetable Magic and onion powder.  Delicious!

This is truly a comfort food.  This is a great soup for a snowy, cold night.  Will definitely make again.  The changes I made were:  I used a whole onion, I used chicken stock, did not use salt, used a 16 oz bag of Old Fashion Cole Slaw Mix, added 2 can of diced tomatoes with basil, garlic and oregano, added a pinch of sugar and added a couple of diced carrots.  Served it with some crusty bread.  YUM....

I made this soup to directions, only I doubled the recipe. The flavor is awsome. My entire family loved it, and it cured my cold.

I just made this soup tonight after a long day of Christmas cookie baking.  It was quick to throw together.  Took advice of others and used chix. broth, water and 1 chix. bouillon cube instead of all chix bouillon.  Added chopped celery to onions, cooked till tender.  I bought the wrong size tomatoes, got a very large can, twice the size called for, but added it all anyway.  Added some sliced smoked polish sausage, carrots, and about 2 Tbls. sugar to take the bite out of the tomatoes.  It tasted great on a cold winter nite here in Wisconsin.  I bet it will taste even better tomorrow after flavors have time to mingle.

What a pleasant surprise!  My husband (not always a soup fan) loved it (with my few additions).  He asked me to keep the recipe handy so we could have it again--soon.  I replaced the canned tomatoes with 5 fresh Roma tomatoes coarsely chunked, a can of Jalopena stewed tomatoes, and I added a cup of thin spaghetti (broken), along with  a half-cup of elbow macaroni.  The pasta made it a bit heartier and the Jalopena tomatoes gave it a enough bite to make it interesting.

From 2 Stars to 4.  I thought this soup was a little bland but with a couple of minor changes, it jumped to a 4 star recipe.
I used canned chicken broth in place of water (omitting the called-for chicken bouillon).  I also wanted a more savory flavor so I added 1 1/2 teaspoons Italian Seasoning.  I'll be making this again.

I am so happy to have found this soup!  I used chicken broth and a little Penzeys chicken base instead of the bouillon cubes.  I didn't have Italian stewed tomatoes, so I used regular ones, and added them along with some Italian seasoning, juice and all.  Adding kidney beans made the soup even more fiber rich.  As much as I enjoyed this soup tonight, I can foresee endless variations, including adding smoked sausage, chicken, and almost any kind of bean.  The fact that it is a healthy soup and takes no time at all to make, is the icing on the cake. Love this soup!!

This was so good---I was really surprised. I used a can of regular, not seasoned, diced tomatoes and added an italian herb mix. I also added a bit of cayenne pepper and used chicken stock instead of bullion cubes. My husband even really liked it. And, unlike most soups, the leftovers didn't just sit in the fridge---I ate them all! This will be a regular.

I am rating this 5 stars because just as it is, it is delicious.  That being said, I did change a few things.  I added 2 stalks celery, 3 carrots and 2 cups of lentils.  I used chicken broth instead of water and bouillon and didn't add any salt.  Next time I think I will use diced tomatoes instead of the stewed.  I served it with cornbread and my husband kept mmmmmmmmmmmming.  It very good.  Our temps this weekend were in the 30s so the soup was very satisfying.

This is a delicious low calorie recipe; good for the holiday time of year with all the other high fat/calorie food choices out there. To make the soup a little more substantial, sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, or add a little cooked pasta (like ditalini).

Hubs has been asking me to make a low carb, low calorie veggie soup that he can “snack” on.  I made this using chicken broth instead of the water/bouillon and a 1 pound package of pre-shredded cabbage.  I didn't drain the tomatoes and used diced tomatoes flavored with garlic, basil and oregano.  To bulk up the veggies, I also added one cup of each chopped carrots and celery.  I only used about 1 T. of oil to sauté the veggies and added the garlic for the last minute.  After that I followed the recipe.  This turned out to be very flavorful and just what Hubs was after.  So five stars from us!

Awesome anytime. this is a great base soup to add whatever other veggies you like. when you are cooking the onions and garlic I also add carrots, celery and zucchini.  I then mix spinach with the cabbage. I use two cans of tomatoes and use the sauce from it as well. I just make sure that the tomato sauce and broth add up to 2 quarts.

This was Delicious. I made this for me and my friend when she was sick and it was a big hit! I changed it up a little bit by adding carrots, celery, fresh tomatoes( rather than canned ones) and I added seasoned chicken and (canned) green chilli peppers. It was Delicious and because of the kick, it cleared our sinuses! Thanks for the healing soup!

DELISH! I fixed the soup as directed; I am NOT a good soup maker.  I did double the recipe, added 8 oz of julienne ham strips and a 12 oz pkg of mixed veges. 
A nice thing about this recipe is that you can add things that you like and it is a great basic recipe. Thanks for a GREAT basic recipe.  I also have an italian herb garden and added some of my own fresh herbs for additional flavor.

This was excellent! I didn't have stewed, Italian tomatoes, so used a can of diced tomatoes and added about 1 1/2 -2 teaspoons of Italian seasoning, along with an extra teaspoon of dried basil. Topped with a sprinkling of fresh grated parmesan cheese and served with whole grain bread. Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good soup. Use chicken broth, reg. stewed tomatoes and added a rounded scoop of Italian Seasoning. Nothing is wrong with this recipe. It was strangely exactly what I needed (I'm not sick) and I can see myself eating this soup in the summer too; maybe because though it's filling it's also a very light soup. Even my 3 year old ate it, I love ways to get veggies down him. It's being put in the recipe box for keeps right now!

EZ. Good healthy soup focused on cabbage and tomatoes. Needs your favorite spices. I added zucchini, garlic powder and about 1 cup of Bubbies brand sauerkraut and that made it REALLY delicious! Next time a smaller can of tomatoes. I love tomatoes, but this was too tomato-y for me.

I made this soup when I had a head cold and it was delicious.  I even had enough to eat off it for at least 3 more dinners.  It was really good with cheese-filled breadsticks.  The only thing I really did different was use 2 cans of chicken broth instead of the boullion, because I didn't have any boullion, and use the petite diced tomatoes, because that's what I had in the pantry.   I don't know if it made my head cold any better, but it's definitely a soup that I'll be making over and over again.

We loved this soup! I followed the recipe except that I only had plain diced tomatoes, so I used a can of those and didn't drain them (that's too much great flavor to not put into the soup), and I put in a teaspoon of Italian seasoning. Next time I'd like to put in carrots, celery, sausage and a few more spices. But the recipe is perfect as is! Thanks~

This was really easy and very good. I doubled both the cabbage and the tomatoes and it worked out fine, plus I added a tablespoon of bacon grease with the bouillon ... yeah! wow!   My husband doesn't eat dairy but I love it, so I stirred two large spoonfuls of yogurt into my own bowl of soup and it was delicious.  Thanks for posting this tasty and versatile recipe!

I added smoked turkey sausage when I stirred in the tomatoes and let it simmer for 40 more minutes.  My husband said he could eat this every night for the rest of his life.

very nice comforting soup.  I added some pork cuts and a carrot, and used a full head of cabbage.  We ate it with a loaf of french bread.  I will definitely make again.

PERFECT! I am currently caregiving for my father, so I do all the cooking for him. It has been difficult to find tasty and nutritious recipes you can eat without teeth! I drained the broth when the soup was done and put all the solids in the food processor. I then returned the puree mix to the broth and he LOVED it! Thanks!!

Delicious! I did however follow some people's recommendations and added cayenne pepper. I also used red cabbage instead of green since its higher in vitamins,and added some cut okra, lentils, and sliced mushrooms. Instead of chicken bouillon I used a vegan chicken flavored base that was low sodium.

Made this last night for supper. Way beyond good. This goes in my permanent folder. The only thing I would likely change is using bacon grease in place of the olive oil. You absolutely have to try this one.

Ok, so I just got finished eating a bowl for lunch.....and it was delicious! I sauteed onion,carrot,celery, and garlic first, then added fat free/low sodium chix broth. I also used a bag of pre-shredded cole slaw mix(didnt have a head of cabbage),a can of fire roasted tomatoes, and a can of drained/rinsed kidney beans. Very tasty on this cold rainy day.

Simple and inexplicably soothing! Had a terrible cold and wanted home-cooked soup without much effort. This was wonderful. Used 2 cans chicken broth in place of water, added carrots, a little basil and thyme. Perfect!

This was really good! I was skeptical as it was cooking, it's not very pretty, but it was great.  My whole family liked it (even 2 & 4 year olds!)  
I did make some changes: I used a 28oz can of tomatoes with basil, and also added a can of cannellini beans (white kidney beans).  Also used 2 qts of boxed chicken broth instead of the water & boullion.
The beans worked perfectly in the flavors and added some protein!

I was waiting to catch cold to make this soup since I saw the recipe ! This is a great recipe. As I did not have stewed tomatoes on hand, I used 2 tbsp tomato paste instead. I also added a little bacon and thinly minced scallion. Really yummy.

I thought this was a good soup.  I did make one change which was to add one cup of dried lentils with the cabbage.  I didn't have the italian tomatoes so added 1 1/2 tsp italian seasoning.  Not the best cabbage soup I've made but it was good even my 6 and 5 year old asked for seconds.

I think the key here is to double the tomatoes and don't drain them.  This made for a very flavorful broth.  I used chicken broth from a carton, added carrots and celery and omited the salt.  Only thing I didn't care for was the cabbage-- forgot how much I really don't like it cooked.  Otherwise I enjoyed it.  Next time I would add a bay leaf and cut the cabbage into big chunks so I could fish them out easily..  I like the flavor of cooked cabbage just not the eating of it.  Random thought....maybe I could finely shred it and add it near the end of the cooking time.  Trying to increase my veggie intake.

Once you make a few minor adjustments this soup will become a staple. I highly recommend, as others suggested, using chicken broth and no water. I used some leftover broth I had and five cups water so to give it a broth flavor I ended up adding in 4 tbsp. of chicken bouillon.  Adding in a pinch of cayenne pepper also gives it a boost of flavor. When adding in the onion I also included red potatoes, frozen corn, green bell pepper, and fresh parsley and crumbled up some fried bacon once it came to the step of adding in the canned tomatoes. Bake some sweet cornbread alongside in the oven and it's sure to please. Hope this helps ya’ll, enjoy and happy stewing!

Better than chicken soup! So simple, so tasty and so easy to make. This recipe is fantastic as is, without any alterations.

That said, the small changes we like to make are upping the pepper a bit; throwing an egg in the next-day leftovers to give the soup a bit more protein and heft; add cooked rice. Adding the juices from the canned Italian spice tomatoes gives the soup a great taste, too. 

And by the way, it does not freeze well. We found that out the hard way! Regardless, this is our go-to soup in the winter whenever one of us is feeling the chill or just a little under the weather.

This recipe is delicious. I made a few changes. I did not drain the tomatoes I diced them up and added the tomatoes as well as the juice to the soup. Other than that, the recipe is delicious! I make it once a week now because both my family and my boyfriends family love this soup!

Absolutely loved this. Made minimal changes: used chicken broth instead of water and added some Italian seasoning and a pinch of cayenne pepper. That's it! Everything else stayed the same. I have been sick the last couple days and this soup has been pretty much all I've eaten. And that's ok, because it's delicious!

I'm making this soup for the second time now. My parents and I both love it.  My mom said it reminds her of soups her mom made. I do add other vegetables like carrots and celery to it just because I really like those veggies in my soups. I feel like a cold is coming on and this will hit the spot.

Just tweaked a little, this is the perfect, easy soup!  We add carrots in our house - they are best put in the pot right in the beginning and sweated to release the sugars - then just go on as the recipe says.  Quick, simple, and incredibly tasty!

This is a simple recipe, and I used red cabbage since that's what I had.  I also subbed carrots for the canned tomatoes since I didn't have tomatoes on hand.  I also added some black beans for a little protein.  This lends itself to a lot of variety.  If you're in the mood for something with a little kick, you can add some sliced sausage as others have mentioned.

Great soup!  Used recipe to start me out, then added ingredients suggested by other reviewers.  Turned out so well!  It helped me use up a few items I had around the house that I might not have used otherwise.  As many others have said, it truly DOES taste better the longer it sits.  Try it, you'll like it!

Great soup! I used chicken broth because I didn't have any bouillon and it still turned out great. The only change I made is I added some carrots and celery to the soup.

I love this soup. It's easy to make and comforting on a cold day. It's also super easy to modify. I always throw in celery, carrots, potatoes, and whatever I have lying around to make it heartier.

So delicious. Very comforting. I didn't drain the tomatoes just dumped the whole thing in. I also added more spices, just a bit of this and that. I agree its best with garlic bread to soak up the juices. Yum!

I love this recipe.  I use it as a "base" for vegetable soup. I use Swanson's chicken broth.  I add celery, carrots and sometimes corn.  Use your imagination and you can't go wrong.

Love, love, loved this recipe!  It is so versatile.  To make it healthier, I used low-fat, low-sodium chicken broth instead of the bouillon and water.  Also added a qt. of my own canned tomatoes- juice and all.  To compensate, added 1 Tbsp. Italian seasoning, a dash of crushed oregano, marjoram, basil and a few red pepper flakes.  As suggested, I loaded this soup with 5 cloves garlic, a whole onion, 3/4 c. sliced carrots and 3/4 c. chopped celery, sauteed before adding the liquids.  Wonderful served with my whole wheat rolls!

I gave this 5 stars because my family gobbled it up! I didn't use tomatoes but added carrots, smoked sausage, and some spices and it was great! I just thought it was ok, but I'm not a big cabbage fan. The family loved it though, so that's all that matters! Will make again, simple and good!!

its a really nice soup. very low cal also. i used regular diced tomatoes ( i still haven't figured out the point of any recipe that calls for stewed or whole canned tom. when you have to chop them anyway?) I added a bit of italian seasoning to the soup and used a whole small head of cabbage. which made the soup very full. The italian seasoning made the soup taste slightly sweet so i added extra pepper, but after sitting the sweetness went away. Its very filling and a simple to make.

this is a great light soup! But, if youre going to be taking pills with this, you need to add a carb or a fiber, whether it be rice, dumplings, beans, or meat. Bcuz i made the mistake of not doing that and took some pills and a vitamin and i ended up throwing up. Oh and I didnt have chicken cubes so i used beef, and it was great. I agree with the others, this is a great base recipe, but feel free to add any goodies you like. I dont think u could mess this recipe up! (unless u add something stupid like chocolate, lmao)

I rated this as only 4 stars because it was perfect AFTER I made adjustments! I added celery, carrots, bell pepper, unseasoned stewed tomatoes with the juice, oregano, basil, parsley, and some tomato juice. I also used chicken broth instead of the bullion/water-that is mostly because I didn't want to buy bullion especially for this recipe. So good!! I am making it again today, though, this time I am using beef broth because that is what I have on hand.

I rated this 4 stars bc I made some changes (as I always do).  This was DELICIOUS!  This was my first cabbage soup.  I used vegetable bouillon instead of chicken, and I added lots more black pepper, and an entire head of cabbage & 2 cans of stewed tomatoes.  I also added Parsley, Oregano, Sesame Oil, toasted sesame seeds, copped baby carrots, I also added 1 red potato at the beginning (to thicken slightly) and then added another, and a yellow potato toward the end, so they would have some body.    Will definitely make this again!

I make this recipe all the time and it never gets old!  Twice this week in fact!  My changes are:  I use chicken broth instead of water and bouillon.  I use the sauce from the tomatoes!  I double the garlic.  I also add 1/2 teas. of cayenne and 1/2 teas. of red pepper flakes.  The broth is amazing!!!  We like it spicy, though, so you may not want to add that much pepper!  But if you like spicy food, then this broth is for you!

Made this in the morning... may make it tonight as well.  Can. Not. Stop. Eating this soup!  What a great basic recipe.  I altered by using only two garlic cloves and adding a bay leaf, half of a jalapeno with no seeds and 2 large, chopped carrots to the onion/garlic/oil step. One qt veggie broth (boxed) plus one qt water was perfect with kosher salt and pepper to taste, and for spice I added a pinch cayenne and about 1/2 teaspoons each of tumeric, basil and dill seeds. (Wow, the dill seeds!!)  Stirred in a tsp cider vinegar to seal the deal.  It truly is a delicious meal alone, and I enjoyed it with a bit of pre-cooked turkey sausage.  xox

This is outstanding! I modified the recipe with on-hand ingredients, as others have, doubling the garlic and adding sliced turkey sausage, matchstick carrots, a can of cream-style corn and a can of white potatoes, quartered. I used unseasoned tomatoes, chicken broth instead of boullion and added 1 T. of marjoram instead of Italian spices. Can't wait for lunch so I can have another serving!

This soup is true to it's name.  I cooked it the first time last winter when I had a cold.  I felt better almost instantly.  I've been making it regularly ever since.  I make it whenever someone is sick and I make it when we want to enjoy a nice, delicious soup.  The only change I make is that I use a whole head of cabbage.  I never know what to do with the rest of the head and I don't like to waste food.

This is an excellent basic soup recipe just as written, and also a handy recipe to have on hand as a starting point when you have a lot of random vegetables to use up.  It's a great addition to my recipe box!

I was just looking for some easy, quick soup that had cabbage in it.  I also was coming down with a wham-dinger of a cold.  Wouldn't you know, this did the trick.  It was quick, easy, DELICIOUS, my kids LOVED it, and my cold was gone in the morning!!!

I used other reviewers suggestions and this turned out well.  I added 2 carrots and 2 celery stalks to the onion while sauteing it.  I also used a clove of elephant garlic instead of the 2 cloves in the recipe.  I used 1 cup of chicken stock and used about 4 tsp of bouillon and added an extra 2 cups of water.  I used the juice from my canned tomatoes and added 4 tsp of ketchup for some extra sweetness.  I used napa cabbage instead of regular cabbage.  I added about a tsp of cayenne and about a tsp of italian dried herbs.  A good recipe to build upon and make your own.

I cook for a kidney patient whose diet is severely limited.  We both found this to be a wonderfully simple and satisfying comfort food on a cold, rainy day.  I froze several portions for the next winter cold.  I'll definitely make this again.

Good, comfort food. Nothing to exciting about this dish, but it serves its purpose. It is a good way to use up a lot of cabbage. The only changes I made was to add carrots and a handfull of barley and I didn't drain the tomatoes before adding them.

great recipe!  especially for someone who's looking for recipes to cut calories!!! I omitted the salt, I think the stock has enough salt in it.  I also added carrots & celery.  Thanks:)

This is a great- light but hearty soup.  The name says it all.  I have made this for a family member who needed meals upon returning home from a long hospital stay.  He even called me a couple of months later asking for "that awesome cabbage soup recipe".  If you love cabbage like I do, this recipe is for you.  Easy and full of flavor.  
I always tweak the recipe to fit the ingredients at hand.  Lovely with a little kick of heat.

I love this soup and it really helps with weight management.  I ate a small bowl of this at the start of a meal and it caused me to eat less of the fattening foods.

We all had colds when this recipe was recommended and it was perfect, especially since I happened to have all the ingredients on hand and didn't have to go to the store.  I don't think I'd crave it for a regular meal, but for when you're in a "chicken soup" kind of mood, this is a good alternative.  Thank you to the contributor.

Great soup that is very easy to make. I made three additions: chopped carrots and celery, 5 dashes of cayanne pepper, and cubed, firm tofu. I also added some more chicken flavoring and let it simmer on the stove for 3-4 hours and it cooked down to a rich, yummy soup. We will definitly make it again.

This is sooo soothing and good!  I am pregnant with a big head cold, so this is the medicine for me.  I can't tell you how much it made me feel better :o)  I used real chicken broth (instead of cubes) and added a pinch of cayenne and red pepper flakes (to clear my sinuses!)  Thank you so much for this recipe.

So easy, and really, really good!  Even my pickiest child and my meat-and-potato lovers loved it.  The only changes I made were to not drain the tomatoes, add a pound of frozen green beans with the onions, and throw in a bit of leftover turkey.  Best vegetable soup recipe I've found.

This is a great basic soup that's easy to make your own. I don't like chopping vegetables, so when I was in Trader Joe's I purchased pre-chopped mirepoix for this batch, definitely worth the $2.99. In the past I've used the frozen chopped onion and it works well, but the addition of carrot and celery in the mirepoix was great in this soup. I also added some turmeric since it is anti-inflammatory and gives the soup a deeper color. In the past I've added a good quality Hungarian paprika to the onion and oil in the beginning, which is also very good. I decided to try this batch in the Instant Pot for a change. I plan on making this all winter!

Girlfriend wanted to make a low calorie "weightloss" cabbage soup and this was just the recipe we were looking for. We look a few minor liberties in the recipe, added baby carrots and substituting veggie bouillon, as she's a vegetarian. Thanks for the basic recipe to start us up!

2 cloves of garlic in 8 cups of water is hardly any flavoring at all.  You couldn't even tell there was any garlic. This was tasteless and bland

Simple, quick, and delicious. I make it often and sometimes add a few things to make it almost a minestrone. Even though I live alone, I have no trouble finishing off a pot of this soup within a couple of days.

I have made this a half a dozen times and it is just fantastic! It is full of flavor and SO EASY. I make it just like the recipe says, or sometimes I may add in some stuff of my own, like a little pasta, fresh vegetables, or maybe some meat.... There are so many ways you can go with this. It is just wonderful. I am making it now and this time I added some cauliflower and broccoli to it with fresh tomatoes and seasoning. Can't wait to dig in!

This is my go to Cabbage Soup Recipe!
I make double batches and freeze some, if I haven't shared it with our neighbors.
I use chicken broth and/or vegetable broth instead of bouillon.

love this light easy soup.
I through it all in the slow cooker after browning everything and let cool all day on low. 
Portioned it for my lunch  and froze it.
I take out a container before I head to work and it's thawed by lunch...

This soup is in regular rotation in our house, and even more so when we're under the weather. I've added carrots to this soup, and that makes for a nice addition, but more often than not, I make it as written...except I use chicken broth instead of water and bouillon. If you like cabbage, and easy, simple soups, you'll love this.

I will definitely be making this again! Perfect for winter blues or stuffy noses. The tomatoes were just the touch. Next time, I might add some lentils or beans because it didn't fill us all the way up.  I made a double batch and the family still couldn't get enough. Thanks for sharing!

I make this soup all of the time. I always add a bay leaf. This soup is very versatile. I call it "Refrgerator Soup" because I also add any veggies left over in the fridge. By the way, don't throw out the liquid from the tomatoes. Add that to the soup as well.

Jaynie Q: I too made some additions. I added a quarter of a jalapeno. No seeds. I added fresh oregano one sprig. Followed KathyLC's additions,  and, used 5 cloves of garlic. Used red cabbage, because that is what hubby brought home. LOL! Red cabbage has more C. Also added to my hubby's, bowl, some apple sausage. i wanted mine more pure. If you like heat, this is the right amount to make you warm inside. I really liked the taste, and the broth. 
The nice thing about the way I made this, I can add a few more ingredients if I get tired of the taste. Or put some meat, chicken, or as I did for my hubby, some of the apple sausage.

I've made this soup many times , but not for a few years, and not necessarily for weight loss.  Does anyone know if this soup can be frozen? It's  just 2 of us now and this soup makes a lot!

Really good base, just what I was looking for.  I added carrots and celery, more garlic, and some spices, as others suggested.  I also added smoked paprika which I thought really rounded it out. I will definitely make this again.

I figured that  after the hundredth time making this soup, I should review it!  It's my go-to when I am sick. I almost always use chicken broth, and I add celery and carrots and extra garlic and some red pepper flakes. I will often add shredded chicken to make it more of a meal. Tonight my husband has strep throat, and I'm feeling like my cold is turning into something  bad, so I have a pot of this simmering on my stove. It's easy and cheap, and I'm so thankful to have found this recipe years ago on Pinterest!

This is by far my favorite cabbage soup recipe! The only change I make is I use 2 quarts homemade chicken broth, no bouillon. Just my preference. I also like to add carrots and celery and sometimes I add ground turkey! I make a big pot and eat it all week. Gets better the longer it sits!

I have been wanting to make cabbage soup for awhile.  My family won't eat it,  but I will.  I added cannellini beans,  carrots,  and celery to bulk up the soup. I also used chicken stock. Very good

I'm a serious "soup-guy" and made a number of my own.  But this is definitely one of my all-time favorites! I have made it many times and have never been disappointed. Loved it the first time done as directed, and it immediately became a solid "soup staple" for my family as it is easy and delicious and gets better over time. I have probably made it 6 times. As there are 3 of us in the household and always with different hours and always "on the go", to come home and have to put together a meal when tired can be a drag. But a hot bowl of soup retrieved from a pot in the 'fridge' is just the ticket.
It's adaptability is amazing. I now always use some meat, (diced or shredded chicken),(also large sliced mild-spicy sausages). An extra veg is nice, too. A note: If it is meant to last 2-3 days, best to be easy on the cabbage at the initial cooking as it is delicate and sitting for a time in the 'fridge' can become a bit soggy. Better to boil an add fresh to the later bowls.
Delicious, and ridiculously healthy, I highly recommend this to anyone.

This was so incredible and simple. I am so glad I came to allrecipes and found this wonderful recipe. I followed the ingredients list with just one substitution. I used Swanson chicken broth(32 oz) for half of the called for water. My wife couldn't wait to taste, literally, had to spoon some out before the final simmer.  I made enough to jar and freeze for later. I will update during the winter to let you know how the jarring held up.

7/1/15:  Hubby loved this even though it is July.  Used a slaw mix that had carrots.  Followed other suggestions and added whole chopped onion and 4 large garlic cloves.  A definite keeper - thanks so much.  OOPS. forgot to mention I added a can of white beans, rinsed and drained but did not drain the tomatoes.

Great recipe! As other reviewers I added a little something: some Italian herbs, a sliced carrot and a handful of red lentils. I also did not drain the tomatoes and added the juice. The soup was delicious and I am already looking forward to the leftovers. :-)

This soup was incredible.  I pureed the whole can of tomatoes and poured it in with juice.  I did add carrots, extra garlic and a teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  I also added some turmeric just because I'm trying to get more of that into my diet.  I will make this many times. I can see adding potatoes or sausage or meat or spinach - I think this soup will let you add almost anything to each one's taste.  Excellent!

Wonderful recipe & great for cold days.  Followed the recipe exactly, but added 1 lb. of fully cooked 
Turkey polish sausage cut in rounds & 2 teaspoons of dried Oregano.  This is a keeper in my recipe box.

Thank you so much for sharing your recipe with us.

I loved this soup.  I used the healing cabbage soup recipe and then I added 6 more cloves of garlic (no it won't be to much garlic, but you can adjust to your tast), 2 cups of fresh chopped mushrooms, and 1/2 half of a small head of cauliflower.  In addition I added fresh oregano and thyme.   To give it some heat, I added a small teaspoon of sriracha chili sauce. Of course salt and pepper to taste with a dash of garlic powder.  And last, 7 cups of chicken broth mixed with 2 TBL of chicken flavored Better than Bullion.  Next, I added 1 1/2 cup of white wine.  I have also made this with 1 1/2 lb of browned ground beef added to the soup and used red win instead of white.  It was also fantastic.    Enjoy

Very good! I did customize it. I added a bottle of beer after sautéing the veggies, cooked off the alcohol, this added a savory richness. Doubled the veggies and added a thinly sliced a carrot and a celery stalk because I had them. The head of cabbage I bought wasn't that big, so I used it all. I used vegetable broth and puréed the stewed tomatoes. Finally, I added red pepper flakes. I think I followed it fairly closely, only making it thicker with veggies and a bit spicy. I usually add a beer to broth soups so that I don't have to salt it. You can't taste beer at all. Thank you!

I am a major fan of cabbage not only for its healthy qualities but its wonderful flavor (if you know how to cook it!). I NEVER use bouillon. I first boiled the 2 quarts of water with chicken bones that I keep in the freezer (about 2 good handfuls of chicken bones, it makes this healing soup even MORE healing due to using a bone broth! im sure you could always just boil some bone in chicken like if you were going to make chicken soup) then i sauteed carrots, onions, celery and garlic. Then i made the recipe as written. DE-LISH!!

I really like this soup. I felt like it needed to be a little heartier, so I used veggie stock in place of the bouillon. I also added celery and spinach. Will certainly make it again.

My husband just happens to be down with a cold this morning and I was looking for a soup recipe that wasn't the standard chicken noodle, since he's not too keen on chicken. I'm so glad I found this recipe! We love cabbage and since it's the day after St. Patrick's day, I had some on hand. After all, soup is about using what you have in your fridge and pantry. I wanted to fill this soup with as much nutrition as possible, so in addition to cabbage, I added a few handfuls of chopped kale, chopped carrot, oregano, thyme (which is excellent for respiratory issues), took the advice of other reviewers and added a dash of cayenne and some red pepper flakes. Since they have great healing properties I increased the onion and garlic. I didn't have any stewed tomatoes, so I used fire roasted diced tomatoes instead. Toward the end of cooking I threw in a small amount of elbow noodles that needed to be used up and for protein, added dark red kidney beans. I cooked it all in low sodium (from Trader Joe's) organic chicken broth and then added some more water and Better Than Bouillon Organic Chicken Base. It tastes amazing and I expect it to be even better tomorrow. Thanks, JGCase, for a great cabbage soup recipe.

I've made a few changes to the recipe to jazz it up.  I add carrots, celery, red kidney beans and substitute reduced sodium chicken broth for the chicken bouillon.  Additionally, I swap out the can of tomatoes for a can of Rotel to add heat.  It's a great soup that's even better with modifications to suit your own taste.

This is probably my favorite soup recipe. So delicious and versatile. I like to add chicken or chicken sausage, plus carrots and whatever other veggies I have around. I use plain diced tomatoes and add my own spices. Yum.

This recipe was fantastic and flavorful (I added a few extra seasonings mentioned by other reviewers)! I needed a way to use up leftover cabbage, but in the future I think I will buy cabbage for the purpose of making this soup. Love that you can throw in carrots, celery, or other vegetables you have on hand.

Not a bad soup, but not over the top either.  I did as others reviewers and added: 3 carrots, 2 potatoes, & 2 celery.  The last 30 minutes I added chopped kale.  Definitely use a good chicken base & add about 1 tsp. ground anise to the broth.  Serve with sourdough bread & butter.  Yum.

So good.  3 tbsp of oil sounded like a lot, I decided to use a tbsp of butter instead.  Everything else I kept the same.  Next time I will add some smoked sausage.

This soup is incredible! The recipe is great as it, but I tend to add an extra clove of garlic and some carrots for fun. Great comfort food without the comfort food calories!!!

Only thing I did different was added one packet Beefy onion soup mix bc I had no onion.  perhaps that was the reason for the taste, but still could not see this improving THAT much with just an onion added. (and i added celery, shredded carrots, basil, and oregano as others suggested)

I used one head of cabbage instead with the rest of the ingredients at the same measurements. A simple, no fuss recipe and perfect for when one's appetite is not exactly great.

Yum!  I loved this.  So did my daughter.  I only had fired roasted tomatoes so used those.  Also  added chickpeas.  I served daughter's over rice.  Really good. Thanks for sharing.  I will make again.

delicious!  i think i prefer the chicken broth flavor over the tomato base that the other cabbage soups have.  i added potatoes, carrots, celery and of course MORE garlic because i had it on hand.  i think the additions added a lot.  also, a splash of hot sauce is always good!!

I like this soup, but it tastes a bit bland for my preference. I usually end up adding more broth and seasonings. It's a generally good base for a cabbage soup though.

Making and eating this soup just makes you feel good.  Nothing like the restorative powers of broth!  I made it with homemade chicken stock and extra garlic.  It smelled  so appetizing that I served it before adding the tomatoes; no matter, it was fantastic without them.  I love that it costs PENNIES per serving.  Thank you JGCASE, this one's a winner.

great base for Cabbage soup. I followed some of the reviews and added about 8 baby carrots (sliced roughly), 1 bunch of (chopped) green onions and sub. the water and bouillon with low sod. chicken broth. I added spices according to my taste and added 1/2 lb of browned ground beef. *I didn't drain the diced tomatoes. I added the whole can to the batch. Great flavors!

LOVE IT!! This soup is delicious and very adaptable to your taste. I know I will make this often because it is light and perfect for lunch. I ran a whole small onion and 4 small cloves of garlic through the food processor and while they were cooking I added the chopped cabbage. I used about 3/4 of a small head. Once all was wilted I added 2 quarts of chicken stock, 2 chopped carrots, a stalk of chopped celery and instead of stewed tomatoes (which I don't like) I used 4 T. of tomato paste. Seasoned to taste with a sprinkle of dried basil and had a very tastey and healthy warm bowl of soup for lunch. Even my cabbage hating husband tasted it and said it was very good. Thanks for sharing!

Pretty good recipe. I used a full onion, no olive oil, and a full head of cabbage. I also added lentils, some pre-cooked ham, and Italian seasoning as another reviewer suggested. Instead of making it on the stove, I used my slow cooker.

This was SO good!  My 5 year old son asked for 3 bowls! My other kids didn't care for it, but they did eat some which was amazing all in itself! They hate everything that was in it.  :D  I did add carrots to our pot.  It was just what we were needing last night.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Love this recipe, I followed it for the most part. I added red pepper flacks and onion power. I also added red skin potatos, peas, carrots and green onions. Just whatever I had in the house that would taste good in it. I like spicy so I made it hot. Good for cold winter days! :-)

I changed the onion to one sliced leek, added one diced carrot, used one box organic chicken broth, added a good splash of apple cider vinegar, and sauteed 3 slices of turkey diced bacon until slightly crisp and added to soup at the end. Fantastic!

Great recipe. I decided to turbo charge it with turkey sausage (garlic/onion flavored) lightly fried with mushrooms and onions.  I add some left over curry sauce (home made) and a teaspoon of blackening spices for heat and left over spaghetti.  WOW! “the best soup I’ve ever made” from the lips of my husband!  Thanks for a great start.

As is, this recipe is way too bland, even when you are sick. It's good as a base to add on to, but otherwise I would not make this again. I added carrots, celery, potatoes and a little bit of parmesan when serving. I also added a lot of spices to try and make this soup more flavourful. Oregano, cayenne, red pepper flakes, pepper, etc. You can add whatever you want, but definitely add the spices and it will turn out great!

Very good soup. To reduce calories, I used olive oil spray instead of regular olive oil, added sliced baby carrots, 14 oz can of kidney beans and a 6 oz can of tomato paste.  If your counting WW points, this is 0 points per cup!!

This soup is a good basic tummy warmer.  While most cabbage soups tend to be rather bland, this one wasn't.  The nice thing about this recipe is that you can add whatever veggies you like.

I chose this recipe for its simplicity. I followed it as written and really enjoyed it. It is very flavorful and satisfying. I used the regular green cabbage and canned chicken broth (don't add salt if you do this) instead of water and bouillon. It would be even better with homemade chicken stock of course. A very frugal dish.

Great recipe as it is, but for a little more zing try substituting a large bottle of salsa for the canned tomatoes.

Just made this for church soup sale. We have some great  cooks & I think this soup will compare very well.    Per other reviews, doubled the garlic & onions  which added greatly to flavor, added a carrot, used chicken broth.  part diced  italian tomatoes & part  Muir Glen canned whole tomatoes, which have much better tomato flavor & thicker juice/sauce.   Also added extra basil. Add crusty roll & have souper healthy meal.

This recipe is fantastic!  First of all, to only give it a 4 because "it's not a 5 until you make it your own" is really beyond me...every recipe is made your own in some way more than likely!  I followed everything ingredient wise but used more ingredients than called for.  I used a whole onion (somewhat large yellow onion), equivalent to 4-5 garlic cloves (they were 3 huge ones), the whole head of cabbage, and then of course extra water and added a can of chicken broth since I used extra stuff.  I also chose to use a regular can of stewed tomatoes because I didn't want an Italian spin on the taste.  My husband requested ham to be put in it and so I found Tyson's ham strips (small pieces of ham) and they went perfectly even though it was a chicken based broth.  For the seasoning, I added a little season salt, pepper, and a couple sprinkles of cayenne pepper.  This came out EXCELLENT!  This will more than likely be the soup I make most often.  It is a wonderful recipe, THANK YOU JGCASE!

Absolutely wonderful!  My family always begs for this soup on cold days. Definitely a major hit! lol I found that half a cabbage is plenty for the soup. I added crushed, dried mint leaves to the soup which gave it a wonderful aroma and taste! I usually add 1 T of it to my soup, makes a big difference!

Four stars only because I made a few additions and subtractions...it was a bit plain without them. I don't use packaged stock, I make bone broth and freeze it so I used 2 litres (8 cups), of my home made bone broth to start the soup off. I also used two heads of garlic (instead of 2 cloves), and 3 brown onions. I added carrots, leeks,  a tin of baked beans in tomato sauce and coriander. I also added kumara (Maori sweet potato in New Zealand, but any sweet potato would work as well). Yummmm

This soup is so tasty, simple, and versatile. I added cut up bits of leftover pot roast and some chopped up pepperoni, just to make it more appealing to my husband. Fantastic!  Also, this soup freezes and reheats very well.

Not really a soup person, but needed something to augment my food choices while on a 21 day no meat, no sweets fast.  This was right on target especially during cold, drafty nights. Looking for more soups to add to my recipe box.  Thanks.

I was very disappointed in this soup recipe; with all the good reviews, I was expecting something better! Mine had so little flavor that I ended up adding so many other ingredients that it became a different soup! I added some cooked ground beef, green beans, pasta, oregano, basil, parsley, and bay leaf. It tasted good with these additions. I will not be making this again.

WOW! This was yummy. Dh was leery w/ the idea of eating "cabbage soup" for supper...but when it came to eating, he was one happy man, and a new soup lover. I made a few changes, only to satisfy my liking. I added portuguese sausage (or if you can't get these maybe kielbasa?) in to the mix, and used 3 cans chicken broth or 1 32oz boxed broth instead of boullian cubes, and I also added onion powder, and used garlic salt in place of regular salt...served with rice, OH what a dish!! Definitely making again.

I can't believe how good this soup was! My husband came home and asked "what smells so good?"  After reading some reviews, I made the following changes:  Add carrots, celery, and a can of cannellini beans; use can of seasoned, diced tomatoes w/juice instead of the stewed tomatoes; use chicken stock instead of the bouillon; add Italian herbs.

This was GREAT! I've had cabbage soup before but it was a long time ago and I don't remember how it tasted. Not only is this recipe very easy but the taste was more than I expected. I did change it up a bit though. I used Organic Chicken Stock instead of water and cubes. I also put italian seasoning, marjoram, basil, some cayanne pepper and more garlic. I also used 28 oz. of Organic crushed tomatoes with basil. It was great the next day for lunch also. I would almost recommend making it a day ahead so the seasonings have time to combine. I love this soup!!

This does have a very good flavor.  I did add a bit of soy for a more salty flavor, and kale for some greens.  

I think it would be good with some grains added as well, maybe barley or rice.

I made this recipe a little different
to suit my family's tastes. I sauteed
the half cabbage in with the onion and garlic, then added in the broth.I threw in a half package of matchstick carrots as well, to boost the flavor a bit. I
also added in about two cups of coarsely
chopped turkey and omitted the tomatoes.
(We've made it with the tomatoes, and
it's good, but I didn't this last time.)
I also added in two bay leaves and a 
couple good shakes of worchestershire
sauce. Is also good with egg noodles,
for those who like a heartier soup. 

Good base soup. Very good for those
ailing not only in the body, but also
in the mind.

Good, simple recipe. I had the beginning of a cold when I made it and felt much better after. Sauteed kielbasa with garlic & onion and added a few small red potaotes and a carrot to the soup. Used liquid (can or box) broth instead of bouillon. Delicious with pumpernickel bread.

Good Soup. I did as others did by adding carrot and celery, as well as cut up several chicken sausages, and added a can of beans bc my bf wont eat it if it doesn't have lots of protein. I also used two cartons of reduced-sodium organic chicken broth instead of water and bullion. Served with mexican cornbread from this site. Was a comforting meal. I have been trying to find ways to use cabbage since it is so healthy.

This was delicious!  I sauteed some chopped carrots in the olive oil about five minutes before I added the onion and garlic.  I added celery salt instead of salt and just a little bit of cayenne pepper which is also good for healing infection and getting rid of colds.  Thanks for the recipe!  Cabbage soup is the best.

I made this soup using vegetable broth instead of the chicken boullion.  I also added 1 pound lean ground beef, chopped celery and onion.  Additionally, I did not drain the tomatoes.  It was wonderful.  I ate it all last week for lunch and I am making it again tonight.

1/2 bag baby carrots
6 fresh plum tomatoes
2 potatoes, peeled and cubed

This was great! We used vegetable broth instead of water and chicken boullion but it was still great. Easy to make and very filling. Definitley needs a side of bread.

I used 3 quarts of water and adjusted boullion, 1/2 of a LARGE cabbage and threw in some frozen carrots, peas. The flavor was out of sight (even my b/f commented on it) but it just wasn't "hearty" enough for me. I think next time (yes, I'll make again) I'll add some fresh veggies and/or potatoes. I brought left overs for lunch today.

Very nice soup - I made a few changes - used 3 cloves of garlic, and added chopped carrots and celery.  I also added 1/2 tsp. Italian seasoning, 1/2 tsp. Marjoram and 1 Tbsp. Balsamic vinegar.  Instead of a 14.5 oz. can of tomatoes, I used a 28 oz. can of Roma tomatoes (drained).  I will definitely make it again.

This is an excellent recipe! It is so flavorful, so easy and so healthy! I took several suggestions from previous reviewers that I will definitely include next time I fix this (which will be soon!). I added 1 tsp of majoram and some chopped baby carrots and celery (had them on hand, didn't want them to go bad). I substituted vegetable broth for chicken bouillon (vegetarian) and seasoned diced tomatoes (basil, garlic, oregano) for the stewed tomatoes. I didn't drain the tomatoes (to retain the seasonings) and the recipe still worked out great. My girlfriend (who usually requires massive amounts of cheese and/or butter to eat vegetables) suggested that I make it every Sunday!  I highly recommend this recipe!

Very hearty and healthy.  I added 2 cups of frozen mixed veggies ann left out the salt and my family really liked it.  Then we ruined the healthiness with crazy bread from Little Ceasars but it was great!

I made this New Years day, and since I was feeding a crowd, tripled the recipe.  I used 2 cans undrained stewed tomatoes, and one can mild Rotel.  I have never drained my tomatoes when making cabbage soup.  I forgot to saute my onion and garlic, so I just added it.  I add s&p, garlic and onion power.  I can't begin to describe how good it was.

1 full medium head cabbage
1/4 tsp (or to taste) cayenne pepper

My husband and I LOVED this soup!  The only changes I made were to use bone broth and plain organic chopped canned tomatoes, undrained.  The leftovers were even better the next day as the flavors were able to develop more.  I will make it again and have already recommended it to a friend.  Oh, almost forgot....I added two Kielbasa links halved and sliced.  I first browned them before sauteeing the onion.  With the sausage, I did not use the olive oil as there was enough fat, but more added flavor.  Makes me hungry just thinking of how good and satisfying this soup is.  Am making a double batch today for us and dear friends.  Such a good soup that can be customized for your personal preferences if one would like.

It was definitely a good recipe to start and then tweak the recipe to your liking. I added zucchini and matchstick carrots along with a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and a teaspoon of lemon juice, some smoked paprika, garlic powder and fresh parsley.

I make this every winter, except my version uses chicken stock instead of water+bullion cubes (it’s what I have on hand). This is a flavorful soup, and it’s perfect for when the family gets colds. It is very comforting...better thanks chicken noodle soup. ?? Make it, you won’t regret it. ??

This was a very good base recipe. I  used chicken bone broth instead of water, a whole onion, chopped celery and carrots, a couple green onions, A few red pepper flakes, basil, oregano, and bay leaves. I also used a bag of coleslaw mix instead of cutting up the cabbage. Will definitely make it again.

I followed the suggestions of some of the other reviewers and added the carrot, celery and Italian seasoning.  I used Hunts canned tomatoes - because they have no MSG.  I also used 8 cups of Better than Bouillon Chicken Base - no MSG either.  Then I sauted the onions, garlic, carrot and celery in the olive oil but I sauted then in my XL Power Pro Pressure Cooker.  Then locked down the top and cooked this on the soup icon for 8 minutes.  I did a natural release for 8 minutes.  Great soup with plenty to freeze for later meals.

I just have a comment about recipes in general. I wish they would say what constitutes a serving. Ok you have this huge pot of soup and the recipe says it makes 8 servings, just exactly how are you suppose to determine how much that one serving is????

Good recipe only lacking some chicken breast meat or some browned pork breakfast sausage [hot Italian sausage adds a great tang] and some carrot shreds. Instead of bouillon I use a 32 oz [4 liquid cups] container of Chicken broth in place of an equal amount of water. Occasionally I will buy a package of rough cut red and green slaw cabbage instead of chopping 1/2 head of cabbage. Next I use 1 tablespoon of minced garlic. I love this soup because it brings out my soup creativity!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  One of the great things about it is that you can make it your own.  I didn't have garlic on hand, but I added carrots instead and also beans for protein.  I know there are many who get irritated when someone changes the original recipe, but not everyone likes the same things, or maybe don't have something on hand.  So to know that this is a good one where you can add or subtract and it still tastes great is important.

I almost followed the recipe...just changed a little to utilize things I had.  I used two undrained cans Italian seasoned diced tomatoes, veg broth and water for the chicken bouillon.  I used 6 cloves of garlic...because it's garlic. I added fresh chopped green beans and mushrooms that needed to be used and a bit of red pepper flakes for a kick! I made it yesterday after dinner, then plopped it in the fridge. I reheated it  for tonight's meal after a late night of work. Really hit the spot after a cold wet day! Thank you for sharing!

I used fresh tomatoes in place of the canned stewed. I googled what canned stewed tomatoes were, and then decided to cut up some fresh tomatoes which I cooked in a pot with olive oil, garlic, a bit of sugar, a bit of salt, herbes de provence, and rosemary. I also didn't use bouillion cubes, but made my own broth with a turkey carcass I had in the freezer. It turned out great.

Made this because I had a head of cabbage that I didn’t know what to do with. Instead of adding salt and tomatoes, I added tomato bouillon (1tsp). I also added potatoes with the onion and used garlic powder because I did not have fresh garlic. Came out good. I put them in jars for the week. Ver good and clean flavor.

This was very good.  i added carrots and celery as others suggested.  I also added other seasonings such as garlic powder, Italian seasoning and hot pepper flakes.  My only regret was I didnt double the recipe.  After eating one serving, I have one more serving for later.

I had crushed tomatoes on hand, and used them instead of the stewed tomatoes. It gave the soup more of a tomato base, which I liked.  

Adjust the black pepper to taste. I thought the recipe is a little heavy handed for an “everyday” soup, but if you’re fighting congestion, this should work along with a small dose of crushed red pepper flakes.

This soup is brilliant!! I added a few things...carrots, sweet red pepper, used a whole cabbage head. I added some water and some chicken broth in addition to the bouillon cubes. It has a wonderfully satisfying flavor. Will definitely make again!

Tasted much better the second day after marinading in the refrigerator overnight. I omitted the teaspoon of salt the second time I made it. The canned Italian tomatoes and chicken bouillon contained enough salt for me.  I also think this recipe would make a great soup stock  for something more ambitious.

Even my 9 year old daughter asked for more!
Changes I made: Instead of water and bouillon, I used organic chicken stock.  I added in 2 chopped carrots.  I did not add in the tomatoes, simply because I didn't have any.  Wonderful!!!

I made a few changes to the recipe. I used a whole onion (medium/large sized). Half a knob of garlic and started with chicken broth rather than using bullion and I added about 2 pounds of sautéed, unseasoned pork. I followed the recipe to the letter until the end and then I added pepper and garlic powder to taste and we all LOVE it!! Thank you for the recipe idea! This one is definitely going down in the book!!

This soup is delicious and easy! I used 2 tbs olive oil, that was plenty.  I substituted 2 quarts of veggie broth for the boullion. So good!  Made 4 large servings,  200 calories each.

This is a nice basic recipe but we needed a bit more so my Sweet Hubby added the garbanzo beans, 1 bottle clam juice, shrimp & 1 tsp slap your mama seafood boil to the half recipe we started with & that made a wonderful soup on a cool evening. Next time we'll use a 1/2 tsp slap your mama spice--remember that's for a one half the recipe.

I used 4 cloves of garlic, (love garlic),  & added a good few dashes of jerk seasoning & 1 teaspoon of oregano . Added 1 green, bell pepper & carrots sliced, to sautéed onion & garlic.  Also added 3 medium potatoes. Cooked, low heat for 50 minutes, (to let flavors meld & tomatoes cook down,(only way I can eat tomatoes). Last 15 minutes I added 1-15 oz can of cannellini beans along with cabbage! Jerk seasoning gives a good kick!

Made this recipe as stated.  It was OK. it needed something....some sort of protein.  I agree with another reviewer that this recipe would be a good base for other soups.  Will not make it again because I think the Weight Watchers vegetable soup is much better

Very satisfying.  I used savoy cabbage and added about 2 TBS lemon juice.  I may add chick peas on occasion to make it heartier. This, with some crusty bread for dipping, will be a staple in the house.

A lovely soothing soup that is very easy to make. I use petite diced tomatoes and just dumped the whole can in,  I also  added sausage to mine and thought it was a nice addition.

I did add other veggies like celery and carrots. I also added a can of northern beans. I don't think it mattered because the broth is the star in this. It isn't a thick soup but it is wonderful.  The only suggestion I have is wait to add the salt, you may not need it.  Thank you for this soup!

Excellent!  One of the best vegetable soups I've tasted!  I also cut up some baby carrots and a stalk of celery, adding some red pepper flakes as others suggested.  I used a whole head of cabbage (a fairly large head) and used canned drained diced tomatoes (since I didn't have stewed Italian style), adding some Italian seasonings for flavor.  I also cut back the oil to 1 T. (which was enough), cut back the salt to 1/2 t. (also enough, with the saltiness of the bouillon), and used bouillon cubes and water as written. Delicious, especially served with parmesan cheese! Since we used a large head of cabbage, it made more than 8 servings, which we were very happy about!

This is really, really good. And we're not big cabbage lovers! I made this because I had a quarter of a head of cabbage left over from making slaw that needed to be used up before it went bad. I made the recipe as written but also added some things: about 1/2 a large carrot (shredded), 1 can of drained and rinsed light red kidney beans, 1/2 cup white wine (replacing 1/2 cup of the amount of water recommended), a generous squirt of sriracha, and some diced and pan fried beer brats. It is so good! My husband, who is neither a soup or veggie lover, gave it the thumbs up. :)

I totally cheated on this recipe; I had a huge bag of coleslaw mix left over from a family function and I was looking for a recipe (other than coleslaw) where I could use all this shredded cabbage.  It worked PERFECTLY and the soup is SO delicious!  I think next time I won't use as much oil though.

I have been making this soup at least once a week since I found this recipe.  It is absolutely delicious as a soup before the main meal, but I also love it as a main dish with a slice of French bread with cheese.  I highly recommend this inexpensive and easy to make recipe!

Very simple cabbage soup with lots of flavor, even though I forgot to add the garlic. lol Otherwise, the only change I made was using a 32oz carton of chicken broth instead of the water and bullion (which is not really a change), and omitted the salt. Used good cracked pepper and a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes that made the flavor pop! Would make this again for sure.

This was good but I made changes.  Used 2 qts of chicken stock instead of water and bullion.  Added 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning, 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper and left out the salt.  There is plenty of salt between the stock and the stewed tomatoes.

Great as is and also as a base for other soups. You can vary it a zillion ways.  Try using dropping in some cooked frozen meatballs.  Try using Mexican stewed tomatoes, a combo of beef and chicken broth and add some chicken, corn, green pepper, and diced green chilies; pour over tortilla chips & sprinkle with cheese. Try adding a tall jar of turkey gravy to change the consistency.  Try adding a potato or two. Thanks for perking up my imagination.

Loved this soup!  I made some of the changes suggested by other reviewers so my recipe looked more like this:

2 Tbsp. olive oil;
1 onion, chopped;
2 cloves garlic, chopped;
48 oz. organic low-sodium chicken broth;
1 tsp. salt;
1 tsp. pepper;
3/4 large head of cabbage, cored and coarsely chopped;
14.5 oz. can diced tomatoes with liquid;
water to cover contents.

Delicious reheated as well.

Pretty good base recipe. I am giving it a 4 because I did 'zuzzh' it up!  I used homemade chicken broth, added 1 tsp. hot sauce, a 1/2 tsp. cumin, few dashes of chili powder, 1 tsp. celery seed, chopped baby carrots, handful of rice, and kidney beans for protein. After all my additions, this is an excellent soup!  It's very hearty for vegetarian style, but some ground beef added would be good too!

This is a great base to start with or eat as is.  I have added shredded carrots and once I used vegetable broth instead of bouillon for my husband.  I think I'll make this tonight and add mushrooms!! P.S I tried it with mushrooms, and it was fantastic!!

This soup exceeded my expectations. Very simple to make and delicious just as it is, but you could always add meat and other vegetables. I didn't have the Italian stewed tomatoes and substituted a can of diced tomatoes with onions and green peppers and it was delicious. Definitely a keeper.

This soup is amazing! I did make my own changes and it is delicious. I used a whole onion, low sodium chicken chicken broth instead of bullion, chopped carrots, celery, and red potatoes. I also added cayenne, garlic salt, and  seasonings. This is one of our new favorites! The longer it sits the better it tastes!

This soup is great. To make it even quicker and simpler I used a 12oz bag of Asian blend salad mix (Dole brand) which is already cut into small pieces and made the soup as directed but added basil, oregano and crushed red pepper to taste. The family loved it.

First off, I love cabbage. So this had almost no chance of disappointing me. And, as always, I added more garlic and cabbage than called for. Also added sliced baby carrots and used 2 quarts of chicken stock (less salty than the bouillon). Very healthy and sooo good. My Bohemian grandmother would have loved this. Thanks for the recipe.

This was so amazing, just wanted you to know I added a little more garlic and onions, substituted lawrys salt for regular salt, and just can't get enough in my stomach.  :)

I've made this soup for years, I altered somewhat. I start by browning the onion and garlic in just a little olive oil then I add 1.5 # of ground turkey.  I use 28 oz can of tomatoes and Chicken Box Broth along with 1 Tbsp.  of dry Italian dressing mix and tons of veggies. This time I added celery, carrots, fresh green beans and corn. I generiously sprinkle Mrs. Dash Onion and Herb spice on top and stir, simmer on low about 1 hour.  Serve with crusty bread and enjoy tons of left overs.

Love this recipe.  I try to made it monthly.  For my husband I will add shredded chicken (leftover rotisserie works great) or browned ground beef but it is excellent as is for me.  Thanks for sharing!

I thought the soup was delicious, but only after I altered it a bit. Even though I used 28 oz herbed & spiced diced tomatoes (with the juice) I still found the soup bland. So I added onion powder, chili powder, crushed red chili peppers, italian seasoning and more chicken bouillon powder. Only then did I find it tasty!

This is a nice basic soup that you can cater to your taste. I added julienne carrots, oregano, basil, italian seasoning, and a dash of cayenne.

This was a great recipe for cabbage soup. I don't use chicken bouillon or broth, so instead I use my own homemade lobster stock. I did also add some carrot, celery, green and yellow onion, four cloves garlic rather than two, red pepper flakes, cayenne pepper and Mexican-style stewed tomatoes since that is what I had on hand.

I like this soup but did add some embellishments like cayenne, tumeric, (anti-inflammatories) to the soup along with some kale from my garden and sliced olives at the end to garnish.  I don't worry about cutting olive oil as its good for you.

I had left over cabbage from making a cabbage/shrimp salad and so this was perfect! I followed another reviewers advice and added in some curry powder and I agree that put it over the top!

It is a good solid soup, but per reviews I was expecting better; however, I would make it again with a few adjustments: less olive oil, add the tomato juice from the can, as well as carrots and potatoes.  I did also add fresh oregano which tasted great when you got some of that in the bite.

Mine is similar, but I got a little creative with the aim for less calories.
1/2 an onion
1/2 medium head of purple cabbage
3 orange/yellow tomatoes (they are lower in acidity)
1 yellow bell pepper
1 green zucchini
4 cups vegetable stock
4 cups water.

Basically, throw the chopped onions in until they look transparent. Cut up all the vegetables into appealing cuts (I like to use different shapes on different vegetables for contrast).  Then throw in the vegetables and let them sweat with the lid on at medium for a bit. then toss in the vegetable stock and water and bring to a boil. this is where you would add your favorite spices if you like, salt (or not), pepper, what ever you want, throw it in. Next, put three servings of your favorite whole wheat noodles in there. once the noodles are soft, bring it down to simmer and let is chill there for an hour (or until all the vegetables are soft). This entire pot contains 1,000 calories.

Very glad I had so much leftover to freeze!  I used 1/2 a head of a cabbage that weighed 4 lbs. I reduced the olive oil to about 1.5 Tbsp, & when the onions were soft, I added in 2 stalks of finely-sliced celery & cooked that with the onion, then added in 4 cloves of minced garlic & cooked a couple minutes longer.  Used chicken-flavored "Better than Bouillon", which comes in a jar.  Added 3 thinly-sliced carrots along with the chopped cabbage. I used the liquid from the tomatoes, also, & ended up cooking an extra 30 minutes (at least).  The flavor really comes together as it cooks, & is even better the next day.

Great recipe!  I didn't have bouillon so I used vegetable stock.  The soup still had lots of flavor, maybe partly because the stewed tomatoes had red chilis in them.  Either way, I will make this again, thank you!

I made this soup today for the first time.  I added some cooked and cubed sweet Italian sausage to the mix.  Also, I used a package of cole slaw cabbage and a half a package of shredded carrots.  It was just delicious soup (and I know nothing about cooking, believe me!) and didn't take very long to make since I didn't have to cut the cabbage.

OMG! this soup is phenomenal. I've made it several times and I have to say that it is a staple in my house. It freezes well and reheats with more flavor than the day before. I cant wait to introduce this to my new family... It will not make it to leftovers. The kids are gonna love it with Kielbasa sliced in it and my Boyfriend will serenade me til i serve it again.

This was delicious. I used a whole cabbage (why waste half a a cabbage), a whole medium onion, I added more garlic and red pepper flakes for some heat. I didn't measure the water, but I kept adding as it got thicker, and used 4 bouillon cubes instead of the 4 teaspoons of chicken bouillon.

This soup is great! I made it a few weeks ago with extra veggies such as celery, lentils, broccoli, and carrots. It was ok, but today I made it using only garlic, cabbage, 5 qts water, 8 boillons, 2 limes squeezed and dropped in, I also used ginger paste, white pepper and red pepper flakes. It is GREAT made like this!!

Awesome base recipe!  I added to it like everyone else and made it for New Year's Day.  I added everything as called for except no salt and no pepper.  Instead I added a can of black eyed peas, cumin, and quite a bit of cajun seasoning.  I then let it simmer until the cabbage was transparent.  I was surprised to see that most of the black eyed peas actually dissolved in the soup.  I'm gonna add a little cheese to the top once it gets in the bowls but so far this is really good soup!

I added carrots and celery....some baked ham cubed up would be good in this too. Also, browning the garlic & onions in leftover bacon grease (just a little) gives it good flavor

I substituted the water with homemade veg. stock leftover from Thanksgiving and just 2 veg bouilon cubes substituting the salt and chick bouilon. Did have tomatoes so I substituted with some jarred salsa. I used sea salt at the table because I didn't want to over salt it. The cabbage turns out so silky. Yum, going for my 2nd bowl.

In the future, I plan on using half chicken broth/half water. I used just water this time, and although it was still flavorful, I would have liked a stronger broth. Overall, this was great. My boyfriend had 3 bowls and commented that it filled him up, but was still healthy. I recommmend this for sure!!!

I cook 2 nights a week. I tend to be the meat eater in our family but my wife loves lighter foods. I made this for her and she raved about it. She said it was the best thing I've made from AllRecipes so far and that I could make this for her anytime. It's a bit light for my taste, I'd probably give it a 3, but my wife would give it a 5, so I'm giving it a 4.

a good soup recipe...I made a couple alterations with adding more chicken stock/water and a couple of additional veggies, such as potatoes, grated carrots and frozen spinach.

What a simple but yummy soup. I just needed to use up a head of cabbage in my fridge that was getting old and came out with a favorite! Make it your own with a few spices you enjoy.

Loved this soup - the longer it simmers the better and the next day, it super good.  I added some carrots and potatoes for more of a mouthful and of course used chicken & veggie stock!  My kids loved it too....

Great starter soup - perfect for using veggies from the garden! I used vegetable broth and tomatoes I canned last year. I've also made variations with kale, carrots, and celery. Also, a dash of crushed red pepper adds some zip. Great soup.

Wonderful!  I make this every time I am starting to feel a little under the weather.  I substitute canned veggie broth, but otherwise it is great as is.  Easy and comforting.

This soup is my all time favorite!! Even my one year old granddaughter loves it!! The only thing that I do different is add whole food ingredients instead of can and sometimes add different fresh or dried herbs for flavor variety.

This was so easy to make and very good. I use vegetable stock broth or chicken broth instead of the water and bouilon.  We both loved it. Great for all the cabbage we have growing outside.

Loved it. Tried it first with the Italian style tomatoes and didn't care for it. I also don't care for italian seasoning. I then made it with oregano from my garden, a can of diced tomatoes, added red pepper flakes, a couple of hot sauce vinegar peppers cut up (secret for making good soup), a couple of teaspoons of minced bottled garlic, better than bouillon chicken flavoring, and it was wonderful. I have made it everyday since I found this recipe. Great for someone watching their weight. I make a similar soup that I get raves about called meatball soup. The oregano really adds a great flavor and when you add it you don't miss the meat.

This soup is delicious. I think it really is healing. I feel better right away when I eat it. I make a couple changes to suit my taste. I had two stalks of celery and three carrots, chopped. I cook these with the onion and garlic at the beginning. Also, I either use all chicken stock/broth (the boxed kind), or I use one 32 oz. box of stock, 4 cups of water, and a couple teaspoons of better than boullion. And I buy to canned diced Italian style tomatoes rather than the stewed tomatoes.
When I'm feeling especially lazy, I buy the mirepioux mix from Trader Joes (chopped onions, celery & carrots) and the bagged shredded cabbage. The soup practically cooks itself! And I have a hot cup of soup helping me to feel better in no time. Thanks for a great recipe!

Not only is this soup good every time but it is low carb, probably only a few grams per serving. I'm a low carber so there is always some in the fridge. Follow the recipe and you won't be disappointed. For the spicers out there like me, add what you want to make it even livelier!

Great soup!  Nutritious and delicious!  Only change would be to make home made stock (much healthier and more nutritious and tastier than boullion).  I love onions, so I used a whole one as well.  Will make this again.

This is a great recipe. This is great for sad-sacks with a cold (me)! I did add hot Italian sausage, a lot more garlic, carrots, mushrooms, and some leftover veggies from the crisper. I would have given it 5 stars but the extra star comes from whatever else one chooses to add.

I really love this soup!  Actually, my whole family does.  I do add a few things (carrots, celery) so that the kiddo gets more veggies.  But this is such an easy and cost-friendly recipe.  It's a definite 'go-to' in the winter.

The best! Like some others used 64 oz of chicken broth rather than water and bouillon. Added 3 diced carrots, 2 diced celery stalks, 1 teaspoon of Italian Seasoning, 6 chopped cloves of garlic (instead of 2), and thinly sliced and then quartered smoked pork & beef semi-dry sausage (ready to eat). Decreased the salt to 1/2 teaspoon. Increased to 1 onion, total.  Will make this again and again.

Funny how some are saying this recipe is bland.  Well......it is!  Hopefully they can recognize that when someone is not well they might NOT want to taste thyme, basil, oregano, sun dried tomatoes, turkey sausage....etc.  That said, it's a terrific base if your not under the weather.  I wanted a little touch of "soul" in mine, so I added a splash of white vinegar and a pinch of sugar... YUMMY!

I've made this soup twice now (different ways!), both times to use up cabbage and other vegetables that came in my produce box.  The first time I used red cabbage and diced tomatoes with some spinach added at the end, the second time I used green cabbage and a jar of pasta sauce since I had no tomatoes on hand.  Both times I threw in carrots and summer squash since I had lots of them!  Both versions were super delicious!  I ate a few bowls and froze the rest to use in the winter - not a big craving for hot soup in August!

Great soup! Easy, quick and very good. It is excellent made with plain canned tomatoes and fresh oregano, basil, and tarragon in lieu of the Italian seasoned tomatoes.

Great base for a soup, I made it my own. I doubled the base but used my homemade broth and added extra garlic carrots, celary a few bay leafs, extra italian spice and added sausage. My Dad, Husband, Cousin and daughter loved it. It is really a soup base you can do anything with. I did not use any oil but started it early in the afternoon and let it simmer all day. YUM!!!!!

Very good soup, love it on a cold, rainy day! I used roasted garlic and fire roasted tomatoes for a deeper flavor. I don't like my cabbage mushy, so I added it in the last 10 minutes of cooking.

Very nice soup!  I made this for a whole bunch of hungry Airmen during my monthly drill weekend for the Air National Guard.  It was a hard sell but the people that tried it RAVED over it.  The only minor changes was I sauted the onions in butter, used chicken base instead of bouilon, added Italian seasoning, and used fresh diced tomatoes.  I would easily make this for my family if anyone else besides me would eat cabbage.  :-)

Really good soup for a cold winter night. I used 3 Chicken bouillon cubes and it was perfect. I also added light red kidney beans for extra flavor. Will make again.

I will be making this one regularly! YUMMY!! I did make some changes, but didn't alter the seasonings and it is really fantastic (even my picky when it comes to new veggies son likes it a lot!) I used 4 cups chicken broth and 4 cups veggie broth instead of bouillon and water. I used a whole small red onion and put that with the 2 garlic cloves in a food processor and got them nice and small. I sauteed that with about 15 baby carrots diced and 2 celery stalks diced. I then followed the rest of the ingredients and instructions as written (I did not drain the tomaotes). At the very end I aso added a can of drained beans for some protein. This was really delicious and feels so good on my stomach. I think I could eat the whole pot! :)

I made this recipe last night and it was fabulous! I did deviate from the recipe a little: instead of using chicken bouillons I substituted 1 quart of chicken broth. Then I used 1 quart of water...added some italian seasoning and it was the bomb! It is great on cold winter nights...

This soup was perfect and just in time for the cold and flu season. I have made it twice in the last few months. Each time exactly as the recipe states and my family loves it! I will definitely make this whenever someone is feeling under the weather. Thanks for this recipe.

This soup is officially a hit!  I've made it 3 times now and each time I play with it, it just gets better.  I also like adding cayenne powder and have used both Italian-style-canned tomatoes and fresh-from-the-garden tomatoes.  Celery and carrots both go well in this, but I might avoid potatoes, as they thicken the broth a bit and the broth is my favourite part.  I used powdered vegetable bullion, as some of my family are vegetarian.  I have another cabbage in my fridge right now that is begging to be in this soup!

Very easy and good.  I used beef boullion and onion powder (all I had on hand) the only tomatoes I had were diced fire roasted, and I did not drain them.  AWESOME.

Very good recipe! Lots of flavor! My only suggestion is to add barley or rice because it wasn't very substantial. I also added a dash of gourmet soup seasoning. Very good though, definately making again.

I thought this was a great recipe. It tasted great and was very filling. I might only add 3 bouillion cubes next time because it was rather salty. Otherwise, I won't change a thing and will make again.

I didn't think this would be liked that much by my family but made it to help with my Grandma's liver cancer.  Everyone enjoyed it!  I threw in some carrots, celery and the tomato juice.  I also added extra garlic and cayenne pepper.

I thought this was ok the first day and phenomenal the second day. Apparently, that's the way cabbage dishes usually are :o) Next time, I'll use a whole onion and add a few more spices but I thought it was great as it is now! Soo excited about the very low fat and calorie content too! Thanks for a great recipe. FYI: We served this with a slotted spoon and ate it as a side dish instead of soup. I liked it better this way!

I made this soup yesterday because I'm fighting the flu.  I doubled the recipe and it made a ton!  This soup is so soothing, I can't even describe how good it feels on the throat, to the ears...it's wonderful.  Simplicity at its best.  Thanks for sharing!

I have been making this recipe for a while and it is one of our all time favorites. Over time I discovered Trader Joes has bagged pre-shredded caggage which is what I buy for this soup now. I have experimented with different assortments os stewed tomatos and diced and we preferred the diced and I toss the entire can including the juice into the soup. I usually buy  basil and garlic diced tomatos.

This recipe is soooo good.  My husband and I love it.  We like to carmalize the onions first and then wilt the cabbage. I also season it with Cajun seasoning and add some meatballs.  It makes a hearty soup.  Thanks a bunch.

this was so good, I kinda wish I was sick to really appreciate the "healing" element! The beauty of this recipe is that it is SO adaptable! It is delicious on its own, but so easy to tweak with the addition of fresh veggies and spices should you choose to do so. Lots of leftovers which we will enjoy for lunch tomorrow :)

After reading reviews I also made some changes. I'm a vegetarian, so I used vegetable boullion, tripled the garlic, doubled the onion and added cayenne and a couple carrots.  The tomatoes I had on hand were Italian flavored, so I used that and added a cup of dry lentils when I added the cabbage, which meant a little more simmering and extra water.  It was tasty and healthy and I'll probably make it again, but I wasn't blown away like some of the others reviewers. Despite the added flavors, I felt it needed a bit more kick.

This is a really good recipe for cabbage soup. I (unfortunately) didn't have the stewed tomatoes, and I'm sure they owuld have been wonderful in the soup. I added extra garlic, carrots, barley and parsley. I give this 4 stars, because I think the oil used to cook the garlic and onions should be reduced a bit, it made the broth a little too oily. Other than that, really good!!

This really is a good recipe.  I think next time I might try it with just regular canned tomatoes instead of the Italian-style, and I'm thinking of adding some rice noodles, too.

Very yummy! I doubled up on the chicken bouillon, doubled the garlic, used a whole head of cabbage and added carrots.  I think it would be a little bland if I didnt double the chicken bouillon.  That is why I have four stars.   Very filling.  Froze the leftovers.

i just don't get it!!!  How can it be that a handful of simple ingredients can make something so absolutely fabulous?!!?
My husband and I looove soup and I am always on the lookout for a new recipe. This exceeded all of my expectations. My alterations include adding chopped zucchini and summer squash. I also added extra garlic, a touch of Splenda, and used diced canned tomatoes instead of stewed. I added my own italian seasonings, and garnished with a touch of parmesan cheese. I cooked it all day in the crock pot on low and the house was filled with the most wonderful smell. This would be great with the addition of browned ground chicken or turkey, as well as rice or pasta. We are both hooked on this soup and will eating constantly! Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe! You rock!!!

This was good. I like mine a tad bit sweet, just a smidgen so I added 1 Tablespoons white sugar. Otherwise, this is wonderful. I will keep this as a staple for cold nights. Yummo!

I love this recipe. It's easy enough to make when I'm not feeling well and so comforting. It really is perfect when you have a cold.  I prefer it with regular stewed tomatoes though.

YES!  The only things I change: 1. add fresh chopped tomato because canned is difficult to find and expensive in China, and 2. I just throw everything in the crock pot after the onion and garlic has been sauteed.  The aroma drives our Chinese university students, "our kids", crazy and they can't even wait for it to cool off! Often it burns their tongues but they don't care, they just keep eating and "mmmm"ing!  Quick and easy with great tasting soup that has never failed - for anytime!  THANK YOU!

This soup is so simple, flavourful and delicious!  Prep took almost no time at all.  I stuck to the recipe but at the end added a couple tbsps of lemon juice and spicy red pepper flakes to "liven things up" just a little :)  I served this for lunch with fresh bread and it was a perfect meal.  My husband loved it as well.  I will definitely make this again and again!

This recipe was a great base, but I did changed it and made the best soup I've ever had. I didn't have chicken cubes, so I used real chicken. Two big cut up chicken breasts boiled them in the water til they were done. I added broc, zucchini, carrots, mushrooms, bean sprouts, yellow squash, onions, 1/2 head cabbage, can of tomatoes, cayenne pepper, lots of granulated garlic.. It was so good and everyone loved it.

Very tasty and filling!  Used leeks instead of onion and added a can of kidney beans for a little more substance.  I thought it was great!  (so did my coworker, I had to bring her some two days last week!)  Thanks so much for the tasty, healthy recipe.

This soup was amazing.  Best cabbage soup ever!  I didn't mean to make changes to this recipe, but I used what I had in the pantry with the recipe as a guide:  32 oz of low sodium chicken broth and 16 oz of water as the main broth.  I used the entire onion along with some shredded carrots.  I had a can of diced tomato with garlic and onion.  And I added a small can of spicy hot V-8 juice which added a nice kick.

My sweet husband has a horrible summer cold so I looked this up.  I made it for his lunch today and he really enjoyed it.  It's a simple soup which is just what is needed when you are not feeling well.  The only canned tomatoes I had was a can of tomato and okra put out by "Glory." The tomatoes had some spice already and it really complimented the flavor of the soup.  I would recommend anyone who can find "Glory" canned vegetables at your supermarket to try this soup with the okra and tomatoes.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!!

This is an excellent and easy base.  I added bacon, a little more garlic, celery, and carrot.  Next time, I will try red pepper flakes to add a spicy kick.

This still seemed a little blah even after adding carrots, celery, and spices. It seems like it would be good for healing an irregular digestive system with the cabbage though and it is very similar to the cabbage- soup-diet recipe. For any other purpose, I don't think I would make it again.

The only change I made was that I used vegetable stock instead of chicken bouillon  cubes and water. At first my husband was not too excited when I told him we were having cabbage soup for dinner, but he tried it and ended up eating 2 bowls! Great recipe!!

Added a carrot, 1 onion, chopped tomato, 1/2 tsp. parsely, basil, crushed red pepper, and thyme.  Next time only add 1/4 tsp. cayenne.  I used 6 boullion cubes and an extra cup of water.

This was so delicious I couldn't believe it!  I added a little more garlic than called for, not a significant stray from the original recipe.  This is definitely a new staple in my "favorite soups" recipe file.

Tasty! I"m giving 4 stars as I went with the mods others had suggested: carrots, celery and some canned beans. I think I may have screwed up by using tomatoes with oregano and italian spices... I think I would have liked it better with regular canned tomatos. All in all yummy, and will make again.

This was very good. I made a few additions after reading the reviews. I added paprika, pepper, garlic powder, italian seasoning, and cayenne pepper. Just about a teaspoon full of all. I also added about an extra 1/2 teaspoon of salt.  I like my soup chunky so I used a whole head of cabbage and anextra tablespoon of garlic. It was REALLy good but I rated it a 4 because of all my changes.

Great little soup recipe! Easy and very comforting after having a tooth pulled and braces put on and being zonked by a cold. Followed the recipe except for doubling the tomatoes and garlic. Added the tomatoes with their juice. If you like spicy, I suggest liberal squirts of Tabasco Sauce in the soup bowl.

A simple but very good soup. Vegetarian option of swapping vegetable stock for chicken stock works great and doesn't diminish the flavor at all.

This is a delicious soup for one that's so low in calories.  I tend to like my food salty, but this soup was a little too salty for my liking. I used a whole yellow onion and a whole (small) head of cabbage and the soup came out great. Like others, I also pureed about half of the soup to make it a little smoother and "thicker". Great idea! This soup is an excellent "healing" food, however if you want to make it for dinner rather than recovery, I would suggest adding potatoes and carrots to make it heartier.
warning: dont puree soup (in blender) while HOT...the pressure will make the lid fly off and soup go everywhere.....

This was really good !  Based on the reviews (and picture :o) )  I added carrots, potatoes, kidney beans and a little bit of cayenne pepper.  Tastes great with a little bit of Parmesan cheese added on top.  Thanks !

I made this yesterday with the leftover cabbage I had from making the turkey stuffed cabbage, and it was very good except I made the mistake of not adding the salt and I ended up needing to add salt to it when I ate it.  Also, I used half the amount of pepper, which I'm glad I did because it came out pretty peppery as it was.  Another thing is I think next time I will add a couple more chicken bouillon cubes to it too.  Great healthy soup recipe, though.

This was very good, I did add a little extra seasoning, just for personal taste.  I made it for my hubby who was feeling under the weather and he really enjoyed it.  He actually said he felt a little better the next morning.  Thanks

My Husband and I love Cabbage and we are always looking for new ideas. We just loved the addition of the tomatoes, it makes the dish. Great for winter time. Would recommend it to anyone, it is so simple.

This is EXCELLENT!! My husband and I love this. I cooked it before he left for Navy training and when he came back, he requested I make this one again! You know it's good when the boy hasn't had a homecooked meal in a couple of months and comes home and requests certain things! Thanks, for the great recipe!

I too was making cabbage rolls and decided to look up a recipe that the rest of my cabbage could be used in.  This is the most delicious and easy cabbage soup - this was my first time making it, and it came out great!  I followed the recipe to a T, but my cabbage was very large - so 1/2 meant a lot.

12/7/06 I doubled this recipe and added some ground venison with sausage. I used 1 can of Italian diced tomatoes plus 5 fresh cutup tomatoes.  My family just loved it.  Definitely a keeper in our house.

The weather this very chilly and the only way is to eat or drink something hot and fulfilling. I came across this recipe and it turned out to be a dinner treat.  I didn't add the salt because the chicken bouillon was salty enough. This soup is almost similar to minestronie and next time I'll add some pasta.

this soup was just what i needed on a cold winter night.  All I changed was the amount of bouillon used.  I added one more teaspoon.  But perfect either way!

I have been making this recipe well over a year now.  I just love it and always have the ingredients on hand.  I add a cup or so of carrots, extra onion, and extra garlic and some salt and seasoning.  I just love it year round!

I cooked this soup yesterday for my boy-friend who came down with the flu.  At first, he was not excited at all when he learned that the recipes contains cabbage. But then he loved it! The recipe is excellent: I did the changes as were suggested by some of the other reviewers and I added carrots, more garlic gloves, extra balsamic vinegar and the cayenne pepper.  The soup was spicy, but so delicious! thanks for this healthy recipe!!!

EXCELLENT!!! I read other reviews and took some their advice and I used fresh tomatoes as well. I also add Italian seasonings of oregano, basil, thyme and Mrs. Dash original seasoning. I also used low sodium chicken boullion cubes to keep the sodium content down. It was very flavorful. Great If you have it with warm Italian bread with butter. Yum!!!!.

I used some new kind of freshly diced tomatoes that come in a jar...and I used the seasoned ones. I think the tomatoes ruined it. I also used sliced turkey sausage, which was tasty, but the rest of the soup was not. It sat in my refridgerator for 3 days and I finally put it down the garbage disposal. I don't think I'll try this again. It's a shame too, cause I love cabbage.

Really yummy and soothing, but came out a little too oily for my taste.  Next time I'll reduce the amount of olive oil and add more cabbage -- I like my soups nice and hearty.  This was delicious with a grilled cheese sandwich!  Thx for the recipe!

This is an excellent recipe for a very filling, low fat and low calorie soup that tastes great. I added a little more bouillon and instead of itialian style tomatoes I used tomatoes with peppers and added a some ground chili pepper for a little zing.  I can't imagine anyone that likes cabbage and beef flavor not liking this recipe.

So simple and delicious. Didn't have Italian stewed tomatoes, so used regular diced tomatoes and added Italian seasoning. Family loved, even the little ones and my husband said he hated cabbage until I made this. Thanks.

Delicious! I doubled it so I could use the whole cabbage, and doubled the rest of ingredients.  I also threw in 4 chopped carrots, 4 chopped celery sticks and 3 small zucchini.  Added some basil and oregano as well. It makes a lot but you can eat a lot since it is all vegetables and water based.

Delicious! I made a few changes: instead of water/boullion cube, I used 3c turkey bone broth (made from Thanksgiving bird) with 5c water and added 8 oz of the dark meat from the roasted turkey. Since I did not have stewed tomatoes on hand, I added diced tomatoes with a tsp of Herbs de Province. Really filling and full of flavor.

I love this recipe.   It is a perfect soup for a cold winter night and so easy to make.   I have made this a few times.  I substitute veggie bullion for chicken bullion.

Such a simple soup but so delicious! I made it pretty close to recipe but instead of chicken bullion granules I used 1 c of stock and one large bullion cube. Low in calories.  Really good and making it again today.

I’ve made this several times but I always use chicken stock instead of water and omit the bouillon cubes.  I’ve started adding a can or 2 of northern beans to make it more filling. Tastes awesome the next day.

I make this all the time.  If you don't have the canned tomatoes you can use tomato juice or V8.  I love either and often put them in my soup with Better Than Bouillon chicken broth paste.

Loved it! So tasty. I didn't have raw garlic so I used garlic powder, and still tasted amazing! I also used canned diced tomatoes instead and found it easier to eat instead of whole. I took it to work once and when I heated in the microwave my coworkers were in love with the aroma

Perfect timing because I do have a cold and flu today. This was delicious but I changed it up a little bit by adding some fresh organic brussels sprouts cut in half and celery. I didn’t have Italian style stewed tomatoes, so I added a 14 ounce can of fire roasted tomatoes. I also added some fresh basil, 21 seasoning salute ( Trader Joe’s) garlic salt, and I used rosemary infused olive oil. I did sprinkle in about a teaspoon of Italian seasoning and just a hint of Cayenne pepper.? Delicious!

Very good basic recipe. I added a chopped carrot. Not enough liquid for my liking so I added 2 more cups of chicken broth the next day. I added a variety of seasonings and a pinch of cayenne powder to take it up a notch. Next time I will double the garlic.

This soup was very easy to prepare and delish!!! I made a few changes; added carrots, celery, chili pepper, Italian seasoning and thyme.  I used chicken Better than Bullion.  I like my food with a lot of flavor.

I'd give this 4.5 stars, but I don't have the option.  I made this soup with a couple alterations.  I used 2 quarts of organic chicken broth instead of the water and bouillon.  I'm not sure how this would have affected the overall flavor, but I found I needed to add a little more salt that might have been present in the bouillon.    I also had a half bag of frozen carrot slices in the freezer that I threw in, which worked well.  

I made this in my Instant Pot, using the sauté feature to cook the onions first, then added all other ingredients except the tomatoes and cooked on high pressure for 4 minutes.  I quick-released immediately, and the texture was just right.  I stirred in the tomatoes at the end, and the soup was hot enough to heat them up.

I used canned, already-diced, Italian-style tomatoes and did not drain them; I didn't see the point in wasting the juice.  I know the Italian style tomatoes add the flavor of herbs (particularly basil), but I think when I make this soup again, I'll just go with regular diced tomatoes and try my own seasonings.

Fabulous!  I completely messed it up, by accidentally doubling the amount of tomatoes, then had to double Everything up, more vegies and added a shot of wine vinegar.  That made it come out right.  Soup for Days, but Healthy, hearty and def healing!  Not too bad for breakfast, either.  And lunch, and dinner...  ;)

So easy, and so good.  Very adaptable recipe, and very good when you have a cold.  I used only 1 tsp. oil, mild Ro-tel tomatoes and about 1/3 C of Sweet Pepper in my mix with about 3 tsps. chicken bouillon in mine.  Gently boiled for 1 1/2 Hrs. and Yum!  It gets better as a leftover soup!   A little snappy from the mildly hot Ro-tel, yet so good!!!

Mmmmm. This soup is delicious to eat all day any day. I ended up using 2 boxes (bogo) of chicken broth because with just the ½ onion and ½ cabbage I found my soup wasn’t brothy enough. I also added 1 green pepper chopped, chopped celery and a bag of baby carrots. The flavor of the onions and garlic are very good by sautéing them first. I also added my own spices to liven it up. Basic things...s,p, basil, cayenne. Whatever I had in the house that I knew would work in this recipe. It doesn’t take long to cook so be sure to turn it off and let it sit and soak up the divineness. Personally I think some baby meatballs would go great in this, but I’m off meat, and I didn’t add the tomatoes because I can’t eat that either. Still, my hubby and I loved this modified version. Next time I might try after making some turkey meatballs. Happy eating!

made it many times.  boiling the roast chicken or roast turkey carcass for broth. adding goya chicken powder in both. been using barley instead of pasta, if I use pasta it's generally acina de pepe, tubertine,  something small. I also use napa cabbage.  I use basil, oregano moving towards minestrone.  I love Chef Luca Pappagallo.

I made this yesterday and instead of 2 quarts of water, I used one 32 oz of chicken broth and added 4 cups of water and 2 rounded teaspoons of non gmo chicken bullion for the added flavor and also added 2 bay leaves for additional flavor.  I used a can of roasted organic diced tomatoes for more flavorful zip and it was awesome.  Definitely a keeper.  This ought to keep anyone's strength up during those episodes of illness.  It's quite a comforting bowl of soup.

I followed the recipe, and the only change that I made was to use chicken Knorr Homestyle stock in place of the chicken bullion. (I think that the stock adds more body.) The soup was delicious. I'll definitely make it again, and when I do, I plan to wilt some baby bok choy in it for additional color.

I make it frequently in the winter.  I have also done it in my crock pot which certainly is easy.  It's also filling and low caloried.  I first made this while on a low-cal diet but it quickly became a staple because it was so tasy!

This was absolutely awful. No flavor. Unredeemable no matter what I added to perk it up. Something about the cabbage and tomatoes just didn’t work.

This is very similar to the Weight Watchers Garden Vegetable Soup. I added green beans. This is very easy. And it was even better on the second day.

Great soup as per the recipe, however if you have some extra vegetables in the fridge like me, I suggest you add them. I had match stick carrots,  a small zucchini, a few stalks of celery. I also added some splashes of Frank’s hot sauce, basil and lastly parsley by accident because I thought it was oregano but it tasted great. Dress it up, dress it down- this soup is soothing. Next time I’m going to try beef broth with some sausage and potatoes!

I have ulcerative colitis so this recipe may actually be healing for me. I just made it for the first time today so I will update my review in about a week to include my body's reaction to it. But it tastes great and the cabbage falls apart as you eat it so it's less harmful fiber-wise for these conditions.

I was looking for a soup recipe that I could use my left- over ham from Christmas and a half a bag of coleslaw. This fit the bill. I added carrots, celery, garlic, a potato and chicken broth. It’s just the 2 of us so I adjusted the size and still had left overs. Thank you for this recipe I’ll be using it again

It is a wonderful, warming soup for the body.  I just used 6 cups of water, the only thing I changed, so it was a bit more "hearty."

So good. I changed the recipe somewhat by adding diced tomatoes with no salt added on salted chicken stock a little bit of celery 1/2 a package of torta leni tricolore 4 cheese. It was delicious. I highly recommend the soup and there's a lot you can do to make it more palatable for the people in your family. My father and husband are on a lower sodium diet, this works great

This soup is perfect for anyone struggling with a cold or the flu! I made just a couple of changes. I added celery and I used chicken stock. ( Has more flavor) I also added red pepper flakes and Cayenne pepper for a little extra kick!

Made this with Napa Cabbage and used chicken stock and it turned out well.  Simmered the soup a little longer than suggested at the end.  Next day it was richer flavored after keeping overnight in the fridge.

If I could give this more than 5 stars i would. I read some of the reviews and made some similar changes.  I added two celery stalks chopped up, chicken sausage sliced, a dash of cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes and a 1/2 teaspoon of basil.

When i saw the recipe I began to crave this.  I made it today but didn't have the canned tomatoes so I used a can of chunky tomato soup.  This was sooooooo good.  It hit the spot on an overcast slightly chilly day.  Will add some carrot next time  but its great as written.

This soup is delicious! I made it as-is the first time, which was wonderful. The second time, I added leftover rice and ground beef. It was awesome!!! Also as a personal preference, I steam/boil the onions instead of using oils.

I've made this soup a few times; I freeze half of it, because it makes so much, I'd get sick of it if I ate it every day. I like spice, so I usually add some sriracha at the finish.

Been making this for years and love it!  Most of the time I add ,of each, about a half to whole cup of diced carrots, celery and a large bay leaf and couple tablespoons fresh chopped celery.  
     I also add canned beans like as previously mentioned when introducing it as a meal.  I sprinkle grating cheese over the top and wait for the raves.

This is one of the BEST soup recipe's I have ever tried. I can't say how good it tastes. It really has different taste flavors especially my favorite garlic. Use the exact recipe and you can't go wrong. don't make any changes unless you want beef bullion.

I didn't cut my cabbage small enough for my liking. Flavor was on point. I added one medium jalapeno got that kick. Also added some smoked turkey sausage. It made plenty for my wife and i. Leftovers were even better tasting.

I added another quart of water and two more bouillon cubes because it didn’t seem like enough with the cabbage.  It actually went a longer way and tasted just as good as I think it would in a smaller portion. Needless to say - it was a good thing I made a larger amount because it went fast!!

It's a very good base. I add more garlic, red pepper flakes, carrots, kale, and kidney beans for protein. extra herbs. Use what you like best. Sometimes I'll add broccoli, that's delicious.

I feel like rubbish. I’m sick. So sick. This soup was easy to make, cheap, and I didn’t have to expend too much of my precious precious energy. Used the liquid gold known as leftover Thanksgiving Turkey bone broth, added some basil and thyme but otherwise followed recipe. Yummy. Hoping to benefit from the “healing” as promised in the recipe title.

I made this. It just "struck" me when I saw it in my email box.   And true-to-form I deviated.  I turned it into a mock-Asian dish with corn starch thickening and drizzled whipped eggs.  A little soy sauce... touch of hoisin...  It will cure any cold!   :)

This was an easy soup base to make and easy to tweak for preferences. I used chicken broth instead of water and did not use the bouillon. I increased to one whole onion as other reviews suggested. I added a potato, green onions, white rice, basil, cayenne, red pepper flakes, and chili powder. It tasted a lot better the next day. It is a good make-ahead soup.

Kind of bland, but a great way to use up anything that may go bad soon in the fridge! I added lots a carrots, some celery, and jalapeño. Also used some cumin, hot chili flakes, and paprika to give it some life. Pretty yummy! Definitely a good way to avoid being wasteful.

I use half vegetable stock and the rest was the water the recipe called for. I also added some chopped leftover rotisserie chicken to the mix. I didnt have onions but I diced up green onions to put in my bowl when I ate it. This is so delicious!

I have made this soup two times so far... this really is HEALING. 
I added a can of corn as well as tomato paste and  a small amount, (maybe a cup or so), of left over cast iron browned garlic chicken breast that I shredded with a hand mixer before adding it to the soup at the end.  I make a batch of cornbread that is half and half cornmeal and Jiffy.

A quick and easy recipe, perfect for a cold winter night or during flu season! I personally used boxed chicken stock as my base and the flavor was just perfect. Not too salty nor too strong, it was light and hearty and had that homemade taste to it. Will be making this a ton in the future!

I was Surprised  how good this turned out because it is so simple to make. Four stars because, I had to tweak just a little to suit my taste (I added a thinly sliced carrots, frozen sweet corn, and about a tsp of Italian seasoning). It was simple to make those adjustments though, and it’s so comforting. I served mine over buttered pasta - Yum!

I added sliced baby carrots and used 1 qt chicken bone broth and 1 qt regular chicken stock instead of boullion. Made for a friend who had a cold/allergies and she loved it.

Absolutely delicious! One of the best soups I’ve ever made and I love soup! I was looking for something healthy, stomach soothing, and calming and this fit the bill and was SO yummy. I made a half recipe, exactly as specified, except used a carton of Costco organic chicken stock instead of water & bouillon and used a can of plain petite diced tomatoes & some Italian seasoning instead of Italian seasoned stewed tomatoes (because those were what I had on hand). This one’s a keeper and will be made again and again!

This soup was great following the recipe exactly. It needed a bit more salt for my taste and I also added cooked chicken to add protein to the meal. This soup was wonderful and comforting if you're not feeling well.

First time making it to use up the Napa cabbage I purchased for pot stickers.  Oh my is this delicious.

I used 1/2 head and didn't think enough, so I ran down to Walmart and picked up another small Napa cabbage to add to it.

I used my own chicken broth, but otherwise the recipe as directed and my oh my how delicious and hearty, especially for a no meat soup.

I now prefer the Napa cabbage to regular head cabbage.  A little sweeter and has no odor like regular cabbage does.

Try it I think you will love it.

Agree with lots of previous comments - great base for a savory cabbage soup. Modified to make heartier by adding celery and a yellow butter potato with the cabbage. Threw in zucchini, some rinsed cannelloni beans, and some cayenne pepper when I added the tomatoes. Super delicious and easy to make. I give it 5 stars with my modifications to suit our taste.

Very good soup that's even better after a few days. I used a good quality boxed chicken broth and regular stewed tomatoes (so added a bit of Italian seasoning). Healthy and may be good for what ails you, too!

Yum! made substitutions based on previous reviews - and I used beef stock as I didn't have chicken in the pantry.

My other additions: Cayenne pepper and oregano. Added three grated carrots, two fresh chopped tomatoes to the mix, and a can each of cannellini beans and red kidney beans. 

Next time I'll be true to the recipe. But I'm happy with how it came out - the soup stock was delicious!

I loved this soup! Even my kids enjoyed it! Thanks! I did use chicken broth instead of the water and bullion cubes. And I used garlic and onion tomatos, because that's what I had at home. There was enough left over for my husband to take a bowl to work

I have to add a bit more......turmeric, ginger, cumin, carrots, and celery. 
I know it’s more than a bit....but I started off making this recipe but I felt it needed more! So every time I made it I added more. I’ve got to this point where it needs no more.

My daughter and wife wanted to try this soup so their wish was my command. For such an amazingly simple recipe, the flavor is huge, and scored a big, big home run with the wife and daughter.

I really enjoyed this soup it is nice and simple and it lends great to adding other components like paprika to make it a little more spicy. I will definitely make this again and update what I have added to this great base soup!!

Used chicken stock instead of water/boullion granules, and added sliced kielbasa when I browned the onions. Yummy yummy

I had not been feeling well and wanted to make something that was light but substantial. This hit the spot. The only thing I changed was I added a little more bullion and 3 slices of bacon.

Great recipe, simple and easy to follow. I made a few alterations due to my taste. I added oregano, thyme, paprika and a touch of cayenne pepper. Also, I added green bell peppers and carrots. I will definitely be making this again and often.

I added a lot more pepper (lemon pepper) than they advised. I also made the bouillon broth with water, rather than breaking it up in the soup and adding water.  Very basic but tasty soup.

The only reason I rated this recipe a 4 star and not a 5 is because of the chicken bouillon cube.  But with any easy fix like store bought chicken broth that you like, or even better, a homemade stock/broth that you have made, this recipe is a 5-star one.

I didn't add tomatoes, but I had some celery and  yellow bell pepper that I cooked along with the onion and garlic. I also used low sodium chicken broth and added about 1/2 cup of white vinegar just before serving. It turned out fantastic! I will be making this again and again.

LOVED this soup!   I made it to boost immunities as illness was seeping its way through our house.  It's easy to adjust ingredients to your liking.  I used the original recipe but used purple cabbage, increased garlic to 4 cloves, added ginger root (great for nausea), red pepper flakes for capsaicin (stuffy nose), and thinly sliced radishes (because I had them).

Bravo!!

This is good, easy to make and a great way to use up a half head of cabbage. But like others—I omitted the tomatoes and instead added carrots and celery. It tastes better on day 2. This makes a lot of soup for two people, but during cold weather it’s wonderful to having a flavorful bowl of homemade soup handy whenever you want.  Prior to reheating a bowl in the microwave I added a handful of Jimmy Dean fully cooked turkey sausage crumbles and to me it was just right.

This recipe is great once you tweak it to your personal taste. I made it as is the first time and it was okay. However, the second time, I omitted the tomatoes, used a full onion, and added carrots with the cabbage. After that, my family loves it!

I found this to be a great "base" recipe, but I like my soup to have more substance so I added more ingredients. I added 1/2 a kielbasa, diced. I did 3 cloves of garlic (will do 4 next time), added 2 stalks of celery, a full onion, and carrots. I used a mandolin to slice up the celery and carrots. It's super quick and keeps the slices uniform! Instead of going through the hassle of chopping up a cabbage I bought a family size "coleslaw mix" bag (cabbage and carrots) and used that. It's perfect! I put the full can of tomatoes in, juice and all, and added a small can of tomato sauce. I'll also be adding a red or orange bell pepper and zucchini next time. For spices I used 1tsp. pink Himalayan salt, oregano, sweet basil, cayenne pepper, red pepper flakes, Italian seasoning, multi-color ground pepper, a dash of smoked paprika, and a bit of dill. Pepper to taste. Mine came with a kick and I love it. With all the additions it's a 5-star soup, but as is I would have found it very bland.

This recipe has been a staple in my household for probably 10 years or more in both times of illness and as a winter go-to recipe in general Simple ingredients that not only taste great but nourish your body. An excellent recipe as is, Ive never seen the need alter the recipe in any way.

This soup is so delicious!!  I made it about as directed but I added a can of Rotel tomatoes in addition to the Italian tomatoes.  My Italian tomatoes were already diced and I didn’t drain them.  I had a half pound of ground sirloin that I wanted to use so I browned that and drained it and added it to the soup.
I used a whole small head of cabbage and used Better Than Bouillon to taste.  Everyone loved it and I can’t wait to make it again.  Leftovers were even better!

I made the following modifications based on what I had sitting around at home: (1) I didn't have chicken broth, so I used water plus a can of condensed chicken noodle soup. (2) I used 2/3 of a red onion instead of regular onion. (3) I tripled the garlic, because unlike chicken broth or regular onions, I ALWAYS have lots of garlic at home. (4) I used the full head of cabbage - I had no plans to cook with cabbage the rest of the week, and I don't like to waste food. (5) I used a 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes. (6) I wound up using a tablespoon of salt instead of a teaspoon, because it just tasted better that way at the end.

The end result was delicious - I think I'd make it the same way again.

It was so good and my husband loved it!
By mistake, I made the double of the portions.
Freeze the leftovers and it was good again!

I’ve seen a ton of cabbage soup recipes but this is the original one that came out many years ago.  It’s great. It’s easy to make, smells great while making it and healthy.  I always tend to choose “Allrecipes” for new things I make, they have the highest ratings and have not let me down yet.   I’ve been making this recipe for cabbage soup for years.  It’s great when it’s cold out, you’re sick with a cold but you don’t need a reason to make it, it’s just that good.   I use Chicken broth in place of water, I  crush up bouillon cubes versus the granules, I add celery and carrots.  Last time I didn’t have Italian style tomatoes so I used canned diced tomatoes and added Mrs. Dash, Italian seasoning and oregano and a little celery salt and it was just as good or better than canned Italian tomatoes.  Five stars for the simple but very tasty soup by Allspice.

Turned out great. The only thing I will change next time is to use different tomatoes (they were in huge chunks), and maybe add a little heat. It needed a little kick.

Changed the water to chicken broth to make the soup more hearty. Improved the taste of the soup tremendously.

Love this soup!  Found it a few months back  when I was very ill.  It was easy to make, delicious, and comforting so I have been making it at least once a month since.

I will definitely make again but might add carrots. I did not have Italian stewed tomatoes so I used Rotel tomatoes with green chiles and because they come in 10 ounce cans I added 4 ounces V8. The chiles help your sinuses too!

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was very bland for my taste buds. I also wished I had added more water for some reason there wasn’t very much of it and I love broth soups. I don’t think this soup is for my taste buds but I’m glad I tried it.

As a vegetarian, I substituted ‘Better Than Bouillon- Vegetable Base’ in the recipe. I made this in a crockpot.  I bypassed wilting the cabbage.  All the ingredients went straight into the crockpot on high  for 4- 5 hours.

Mmmm mmmm mmmm! I read this recipe in its entirety and then I read some of the reviews. Based on my own taste, I did decide to make modifications as I was cooking. I added diced carrots and diced celery (because I had extra veggies on hand and I wanted to make the soup hearty because I wanted to serve it by itself as a main meal!). Towards the last 10 minutes of simmering, I also added sliced smoked sausage. Again, I was trying to serve this as a meal in itself! The house smelled amazing as this was simmering. A sprinkle of red pepper flakes for a little heat and this was absolutely delightful. Definitely making this again!

Will definitely make this again!  
Changes I made: a whole onion. A whole head of cabbage. About 1 cup fresh cut carrots. No tomatoes. 
I made this assuming only myself and one (young adult) daughter would eat it... it was so good that my son and 2 other daughters liked it, too! I was pleasantly surprised— and so were they!

Very good!  My doctor has me on a low sodium diet so I used Mrs. Dash Classic instead of salt and pepper.   I also crushed the Italian tomatoes because I don't like tomatoes.  Also I used three chicken boullion cubes instead of granules. However these are awesome in this soup.  Kudos!  I shall make it again.

Excellent,  flexible and rich soup.  I made broth with ham bone, removed bone and scooped out ham debris with handheld strainer basket. In addition to the ingredients listed, I added cubed ham, fresh cut corn, and chopped basil leaf. Absolutely delish and our family loved it! Made a larger amount and refrigerated remainder from first meal, for two more family meals.

I used 64 ounces of chicken stock rather than bullion, garlic powder to taste because I didn't have fresh on hand, and a full onion because I don't like trying to remember to use halfway-used vegetables. 

I also added about a half of a cup of barley  to make for something a bit more filling. It probably could have taken a bit more barley than that, but I was still after a light soup, so I was happy with how it turned out. I was vaguely pulling inspiration from Beaker's Vegetable Barley Soup on this same website, so I also included some chopped carrots and a bay leaf.

I suspect that this soup would have been perfectly tasty without the changes, but it was pretty good with them, too! Very mildly spicy, if you're someone who notices the 'spice' of cabbage and black pepper, with a hint of sweetness too. 

Overall, I'd say that it's a nicely flexible, forgiving recipe. I'm definitely going to keep it around for whenever I'm craving something light and warm.

We enjoyed this flavorful soup. I added some carrots and zucchini.  Like others i used low sodium chicken broth and marjoram, oregano and basil . 

I have a cold and its raining outside. This soup was a perfect choice for today. I will be making this often.

I did have Italian stewed tomatoes so I added about a table spoon of Italian season. I also added one sautéed sweet Italian sausage sliced up to add more flavor. Finally I cooked two bay leaves to help with digestion. I added one less cup of water. It was delicious my husband thought so too and he is not a soup lover because he likes a lot of meat.

An incredible soup recipe!  Polish husband loved this soup.  I used all chicken broth instead of water and cubes and added a couple of carrots , oregano and red pepper flakes.  I doubled the recipe and am glad I did - the leftovers are even better!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I followed other commenters advice and used extra garlic and onion along with diced celery, carrots, and potato. I used low sodium chicken broth rather than bouillon and water. I added a teaspoon of cayenne and TJ’s 21 seasoning salute. I added the Italian stewed tomatoes with juices in the can. I loved this soup! It had a spice that was great for my cold. Will definitely make again when in the mood for a healthy light meal or under the weather.

I’ll be the first to admit I used this recipe as a base. Doubled the recipe except used less chicken stock, used a red onion in addition to a white one, added 5 stalks of celery, 5 carrots, didn’t drain my tomatoes (used plain diced) and added lots of spices to the mix including red pepper flakes, Italian etc to make up for the plain tomatoes. This was requested again immediately from my boyfriend who ate the entire pot. Easy to play around with recipe, yummy and cheap.

Made it 2x now.  Took the suggestions of another reviewer and added chopped carrots and chopped potatoes.  Also used a whole onion and a whole head of cabbage.  Extra garlic - Yum!!
Very easy to customize to your liking.  This is great soup and so easy to make!!

Excellent starter soup. I would make it as is if I was sick and had a hard time eating. I almost never have that problem. I made it using chicken stock and added mushrooms,carrots and celery. I used some spices and linguisa. The sausage gave the broth a rich flavor. I will definitely make this again!

I loved this recipe and like many others I added to it. I added italian seasoning, carrotts, celery, more garlic, and had left over pork shoulder that made it so good. This is a keeper and perfect for a cold day!

I've been making something very similar to this for years only I use lots of other veggies in it (cabbage, onions, carrots, celery, mushrooms, etc.  I use beef broth and chicken broth and add quartered turkey meatballs.  This is an old Diet Workshop recipe tweaked several times.  Still delicious!

A bit too salty and I put a 28 ounce can of diced tomatoes in place of the 14 oz" of stewed ones in recipe. I loved the cabbage.

oh yes! I'll be making this again.  Filling, nourishing & delicious.  I used a combination of chicken stock & broth as I had it on hand and didn't use as much liquid as stated. I like a thicker, hearty soup. I did add maybe a teaspoon of chicken bouillon paste (skipped the granules listed) but the rest was as written. I'm not sick but it is a cold, rainy winter day and this really hit the spot. Thanks !!

I used purple cabbage and loved the color it turned the soup!!! If you added hamburger, I believe this would taste like stuffed cabbage soup!! Definitely will make again. I did use low sodium chicken broth instead of water.

I followed the other reviews and added some carrots and mushrooms, more onions and a bit more broth. I seasoned with a healthy dose of chili powder, Italian seasoning and a dash of cayenne. This soup is absolutely DELICIOUS!!!  I can’t wait to eat the leftovers!

We loved this soup.  The only change we made was, we didn’t have any ground beef but had some frozen Italian meatballs in the freezer we defrosted and browned and added the rest of the ingredients except for the ketchup.  
Will be making this again.

Great soup, my wife was really down and this soup gave her a good pick up. The only addition we would make in the next batch will be to add a teaspoon og chilli flakes.

1.  I used the chicken broth instead of water
2.. I used a can of diced tomatoes and a can of rotel     because that’s what I already had. 
3.  I added a fresh rosemary stem about the last 30 minutes then took it out - just because I like rosemary. 
The soup was excellent - I made it especially for my wife who was sick with a cold and hadn’t been eating much of anything.  Sharon ate two bowls and swears it made her FEEL BETTER !!!

After suffering through a cold for almost 2 weeks I made this soup and it has a healing effect. Very delicious!!! I did add an additional pint of my home canned tomatoes. And I use chicken  broth instead of water  and bouillon.

So incredibly simple and yet so wonderfully warming and satisfying.  Taking cue from another reviewer, I added hickory smoked chicken sausage, chopped, and the smokey taste was great.

this soup was so awesome, i couldnt wait to have leftovers EVERY DAY! made it like the recipe, except i used ch broth instead of water & boullion. also i cut some carrots & celery on the bias & added them in along with some sliced portabella mushrooms i had left over. for the tomato i added 1 can of ro-tel mild & 1 of hot to give a little kick. so basically it was this recipe with a few additions that didnt change the taste. i'm so tempted to make this every week, but i'll hold off for once a month during the winter months.

No reflection on the original recipe - this was what I was looking for - but when I make soup, I want lots of veggies in it.  I added carrots, celery, roasted chicken chunks, a little oregano, basil.  I never measure - how can you go wrong with any of these.  The cabbage is a real plus.
I made it for a friend who was down with an awful cold and she loved it but so did my healthy husband.

It is a basic starter soup. It reminds me of veggie soup without the meat, & most veggies. IF, I make again I'll use beef broth or beef bouillon. The one good thing of this is you don't bloat up from it. I thought for sure because of the cabbage the usual would happen, but probably because it cooks so long I didn't, nor did my hubby. UPDATE: 1/1/2020 I don't know what we did different but we give it a 4 now. We used bouillon/chicken as called for, Italian diced tomatoes - what we had, but it sure tasted different than what we remembered. We will make again. I'm thinking the # of bouillon cubes and water, used made the difference. I believe I used part broth & cubes the last time & made note not to do that again.

I used Better than Boullion, but otherwise made it following the directions. It's a good basic soup, but if I make it again I will probably add a meat or beans.

Delicious and easy to make.  I continue to make this soup.
During January we will be having soups for five dinners each week.  This will be one of them.  Perhaps, this will extend throughout the winter....

The recipe as written is a good base and I’m rating it as okay.

Pretty dang good with my changed. As with most cooks/reviewers, I added ingredients, e.g., Italian seasoning, mustard, celery, crushed red pepper, more onion, more garlic, chicken broth instead of water, chopped carrots and okra. In addition, I used less evoo than suggested, and still tasted the grease. My pot took an hour to reach the consistency I wanted. Served with cornbread muffins. I think I made cabbage stew!?!

I won’t make again, but will include these seasonings in my cabbage dish.

Should the pot have been covered?

Made this soup last night, and I can't stop eating it.  The only thing I changed was to substitute low sodium chicken stock for the water.  I make a lot of soup during the winter months and this one will definitely become a staple.

Easy changes. I used Better than Bouillon chicken to make the broth instead of granules; I used 1/2 bag of prepared  'Superfood' salad mix that had various chopped cabbages, a bit of carrot and kale. I did add rotisserie chicken.

I made this first time yesterday on a very busy day.  It was perfect for a dark, cold and gloomy day. Yes, we have those kind of days too in Florida. Soup loaded with cabbage (1/2)) a head) I added diced ham n carrots for color. I used chicken broth instead of water. So delicious and easy to make as I make Christmas cookies. Recipe couldn't be easier.

Easy.  Family loved it.  Used chicken bone broth 2x and one chicken bouillon cube to add more salt.
Once the onions/garlic were done i just put everything else in at once and simmered.  Good stuff

Outstanding soup - full of flavor. I didn't have any chicken bouillon granules, so used 1 1/2 qt. chicken stock and 1/2 qt. water. Next time, I may add a little chopped celery.

I took another reviewers idea and added some carrots & celery.  I also added 1/2 tsp each of dried thyme, dried basil, dried oregano, dried marjoram, pinch of cayenne and a teaspoon of turmeric (good for combating inflammation).  Because the flavor was a little flat with the Kirkland brand chicken stock, I added some chicken base (the paste kind--about 1 T) and I always add a couple of shots of Worchestershire sauce to soups like this to amp up the flavor a little.  It's a good soup--I'm eating a bowl now because my throat's a little sore and it's going down well.

As others have said, I really like this as a base recipe that you can do a lot with.  Super easy and flavorful as is...most ingredients readily on hand.  I followed the recipe exactly, but doubled up the garlic.  I then added some Kimchee that I had on hand to spice it up.  Was REALLY good with this extra kick which should help with clearing a stuffed head.

As an aside...I continue to love this recipe and use it often...especially during cold/flu season.  I tried adding some meat.  I used Roasted Garlic & Gruyere Chees smoked Chicken Sausage from Aidells and it was great.  I simply fried some in the oil prior to adding the onion/garlic.  Don't know if I will do this every time, but it is a viable option if you are looking for some protein.  

I continue to prefer this soup recipe with Kimchee added.  It adds a nice kick to help clear your head and I now wouldn't consider making it without at least a little added.

Supper yummy and easy to make. I added 2 med size carrots and 2 stalks of celery to the initial soup base before adding the cabbage because I wanted more veggies in it. I also added one quart of chicken stock for extra flavor. My husband love it! Will be making this again!

This was a fast and tasty soup.
I did make a few changes.I used butter instead of olive oil. 
I used purple cabbage
I also added half pound browned ground chuck.
I added chopped celery  and green bell pepper.
I did not drain the stewed  Italian tomatoes.
for a few carbs I added cup of  Farfalle  or bow-tie noodles

I love this soup but perhaps to the horror of vegans, I used some bacon to flavor the onions etc.  I like the idea of adding carrots and celery.  Its great soup on a snowy winter day.

I used organic unsalted chicken stock and added my own salt .   Really good soup. I typically like soups that are more brothy. Lighter. This was great.  I used 3/4 of a head of cabbage because that's what I had leftover from another meal. I also used 3/4 of an onion and 4 cloves of garlic and a tsp of Italian seasoning. It was very good and comforting.

I use your recipe for a reference when making my cabbage soup. I haven’t made it with garlic yet but it’s just a wonderful soup, regardless! 
Sometimes I eat it as is and sometimes I add different veggies or a small portion of mushroom or spinach tortellinis. mmmm good!

I love this soup. Make it all the time.  In addition to the ingredients listed, I add carrots, celery, kale and 12 bouillon cubes with 8 cups of water.  Godd hearty vegetable soup.  a nice crusty Italian or french bread  with lots of butter is so good with it.

This is quite like the old “Weight Watchers” recipe my mom used to make back in the 60’s only hers was made with tomato juice! I still make it for me—my husband does not like cooked cabbage—and freeze what I can’t eat I like seeing the variations of an old favorite.

Delish! Great Recipe.. The only thing I reallly didn't like about this fabulous recipe was the excessive Flatulence the day after.  Melted the wallpaper.. the dog left the room. I would however make it again soon and maybe share it with my wife and her new boyfriend.

Only changes:  coarse cut the cabbage and saute with the onion and garlic before adding liquid, and be sure to add enough black pepper to taste.

I've made this soup for years and I like it very much. It used to be called "Peal a Pound" soup undoubtedly referring to it''s fat free an low caloric attributes. However.... WARNING!!! THIS SOUP CAN GENERATE MORE GAS THAN EXXON MOBIL! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

A hit every time! Have made it for adults, kids, Californians, Alabamans, Texans, hot or cold weather.
Periodically will add dried bell peppers or red pepper, or other spices but basic recipe is the best.

Delicious, and the tomatoes really add nicely to the overall flavor. Just remember that the cabbage may not be compatible for all digestive systems so everyone may not be a happy camper.

This was a great soup. I did triple the garlic, add crushed red pepper and Italian seasoning. I also added a jalapeño chicken sausage link from Trader Joe’s along with 6 tiny potatoes diced. We wanted a slightly heartier soup that would open our noses up a bit and it really worked! Genuinely felt better the next morning. Thanks for posting this.

Very easy to make.  I only had diced tomatoes instead of the Italian stewed tomatoes so I added some basil and oregano. I also had a piece of rind from some Parmesan cheese and added that as well.

I did not have stewed tomatoes.
I made mine with- one drained can medium rotel tomatoes and chilies, 4 cups chicken broth, 4 cups water, half can of tomato paste, one onion chopped and 3/4 cabbage. salt, pepper, italian seasoning blend, and a teaspoon taco seasoning.

SOOOO GOOD! 
Mine was spicy, and delicious and cheap to make.

I will make this again. It's easy, affordable, and you can tweak it to your liking.

Fantastic. Didn't change a thing and it was great. Gives you a calming effect.  Great also for when you are not feeling quite right. Easy to digest. Passed recipe on to several people after they tried it.

Good recipe as is but I tweaked it a little because I like 'thick' soups so I added a can of tomato paste with one tablespoon sugar to cut the acidity, and I threw in a can of northern beans to add a little substance. Perfect for the cold weather!

Excellent recipe.  I used a whole onion, 1/2 t. ground garlic instead of cloves, 2 32oz unsalted chicken broth instead of water & bouillon (way less sodium), bought a package of cole slaw (24oz) as I am unable to cut up a head of cabbage so I chopped this.  Very easy to make and tastes great.

Excellent soup for the soul. I have been making this recipe for years...it has become my Feel-better meal when one of us is feeling poorly or when we need a comfort meal. I use a bit more garlic and usually add fresh parsley if I have it; otherwise I keep to the recipe and we never ever have leftovers!

If you'd like an Asian twist, add ginger to this for even more healing ingredients. Don't use boullion cubes. They are processed garbage, full of salt. Sodium overload stresses your organs, especially your kidneys. Use low sodium broths.

This is a great soup but it was missing a little something to really hit the spot and fill me up. So I added Lima beans. I cooked the beans on their own then rinsed them and added them to the already cooked soup.

1: i added 3 average size carrots (chopped into 3mm coins) 2 sweet peppers chopped(fry with onions) and mushrooms(fry with onions as well) 2: i didn't drain the juice out of the tomatoes i added it to the the vegetables slowly to stew the carrots after frying the garlic and onion. i also replaced the pepper for chilli powder and montreal steak spice for a little more of an underlining heat. a teaspoon of each

I used fresh tomatoes and Campbell's chicken broth and a red pepper olive oil. I didn't add any pepper, but I used a fair bit of garlic. It is spicier than I anticipated, I think maybe from the red pepper olive oil, but I liked it!

I’m not at all a veggie person much less a cabbage person but honest to God this is one of the best soups I’ve ever made in my life. I switched this one up a lot,  changed some of the ingredients added Italian meatballs and some really robust tomato sauce to it and it was out of this world. Out. Of. This. World.  Wow!

I wanted a plain cabbage soup and that's what this is.  The there are only a few things I changed.  I used crushed tomatoes in place of the stewed tomatoes and I added some peppers, celery and carrots because I had always add them to soup.  The other thing I did was use home made bone broth.  I make my own and love that flavor.   The soup has wonderful flavor and we are trying to loose weight and I believe this is what we need to eat.  Thank you for the recipe!!

It's still on the stovetop and it smells great! I will post a pic after it cool or tomorrow after the flavors merge and I will serve it up for my vegetarian friends. I used better than bouillon  veg stock. I followed the recipe but did not add meat, but potatoes (Yukon golds) More later!

Its a great generic soup base from which you can build many things. FYI... Please never use water in soup to start..if you have to use water,its hopefully just to thin.

I’d definitely do this again, a spring cold hit me a few weeks ago so I decided to make the cabbage soup. I added some Turmeric, other than that stuck to the recipe and it was a hit with the family. 5*

Simple, and very tasty. I've made it probably 2 dozen times, and it's always great. Sometimes, I add a few shakes of red pepper flakes if I'm in the mood for some extra kick, but absolutely doesn't need it.

I have to say, I really liked this soup. Until I added the tomatoes.  I didn't like it as much after that. I made it as written, maybe a little more onion (I hate having left over onion). I would have given it 4 stars before I added the tomato.

I made this recipe exactly as described. I thought it was a little on the sweet side and somewhat bland even after adding additional chicken granules, salt and pepper. I doubt if I'll be making it again.

WOW!!!!  Exceptional base soup!!!  Ok... so I did what several others did and added chopped celery and carrots... Upped the garlic to 4,  Used Lower Sodium Chicken broth.. but did 1 cup less, AND sliced mushrooms...(sautéed all that together),  AND dried Thyme, basil & Oregano... then had in the freezer... corn niblets AND Italian meatballs... 12 of them... It truly was a HUGE hit!

I can't give this five stars as I made some changes as suggested by other reviewers.  I added celery and carrots and I also added some sliced Italian sausage to the onions as they cooked.  I also used ready made low sodium chicken stock - I prefer this over the chicken bouillon.  The result was a very good cold winter day soup.  I will make again.  Thanks.

I loved it but made a few changes. I added some chick peas that I had in the fridge and also some large elbow macaroni that added a few carbs. Nonetheless, it was delicious and because I needed a little spice I added some oregano and a tiny bit of crushed red pepper flakes. Delicious and I’ll keep this in my winter soup rotation.

This was amazing! It was the right amount of flavour, and kick! Using Himalayan pink salt made the cabbage stand out more and I added a bit of ground beef and VIOLA! An amazing and hearty soup! 10/10 would recommend.

I've been making this for over 2 years. I found it because I was diagnosed with all kinds of food allergies that were causing me inflammation. This soup has been a godsend. I've altered it in many different ways and each time it's been awesome. I always use chicken broth instead of bullion. I, also, always add celery and use canned crushed tomato. I started with a half of a head of cabbage, but eventually realized that a whole head is perfect for a whole week of meals for 2 people. You can throw all kinds of veggies into this soup. I love it with green beans or bell peppers. Basically, if you have some veggies on their way out, throw them in. I usually eat it with an added protein diced or shredded in it. Every meat works. Sausage or ground turkey have been my fav. The best part is that I always lose weight, during the soup week. I want to thank you for posting this recipe. It's made me feel better when I've been ill and lose weight when I've been fat. What more can you ask for? oh, yea....it tastes good too!

Wonderful recipe for using up an excess bag of coleslaw mix that I purchased to make slaw for a potluck.  I used homemade chicken broth, added the can of Italian-style tomatoes UNdrained, and also a splash of balsamic vinegar for a touch of sweet/sour flavor.  I noted one reviewer's comment to add white beans for protein - will probably try that next time.

I've made this many times. Usually exactly as listed(which is wonderful!), but I tried a couple of things differently today and it really elevated it. 

Add in one can of Rotel tomatoes with green chilies, and cut up a couple of zucchini into inch chunks. Regular diced canned tomatoes, not the Italian. Lastly I added in a solid pound of chopped carrots. It is amazing.  A dash of lemon juice when you bowl it up and it really kicks it up that little bit. 

I love that this recipe is nothing you need to be exact with. You can adjust it to what you have on hand as well.

One word of caution... the garlic... ahem.. unless everyone's eating the soup.. use cautiously. I'm reasonably certain there's not a vampire around for at least a 10 mile radius.  Ha ha!

I need to lose ten pounds so I chose this recipe for  lunch time.  I am so glad I did.  This soup is not only healthy it is very satisfying. It will keep me from snacking in between meals.  
I made it exactly as directed.  Maybe next time I will try adding a little carrot.  I did add a bit of Italian seasoning.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I really enjoyed this soup! I read through a few of the reviews before making this and decided to do just a couple of changes. Instead of water I used chicken broth and added ground italian turkey sausage. It was really tasty and the sausage made it hearty. I will definitely make this again, thank you!

Like the flexibility of this soup. I used 1 box low sodium chicken broth & 4 cups of tomato juice for the liquid. Also put a diced green pepper in with the cabbage and extra onion. Only 1 tbsp. of oil was necessary. Had a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes that made this a wow.

I have made this but......I added green beens, carrots, fresh Roma tomatoes, more beef stock...lots of celery. It is wonderful, and keeps you going.  Excellent vegetable soup...with lots of vitamins and nutrients! So very good. My version is a lot like Weight watchers vegetable soup.

Extremely delicious! Have been sick like a dog for two weeks; this feels so good.
My slight changes: 28 oz can diced tomatoes (no need to drain), whole onion, 4 cloves of garlic,  2 pinches red pepper flakes, 4 boullion cubes, and only 1/2 tsp salt.

so easy, so good.  its great on its own but i added a can of garbanzo beans to up the nutritive value.  also, used vegetable stock (the box container) for half the water requirement and five boullion cubes instead of four.  i let it simmer longer than suggested and promptly ate two bowls.  hubs loved it so that was a surprise now i have to share! i can see adding rice, or quinoa or cannellini beans.  this is definitely going to be my go-to soup this winter.  yummz!

Blah! Tasteless and for me, the cabbage was wimpy and overcooked. Adding insult to injury, by using the packaged onion soup for flavoring, those soups are loaded with salk, preservatives and  other nasty chemicals. Cabbage should always maintain a nice crisp edge, not raw but crunch tender. This was tasteless and boring. Not a keeper.

I used a white onion instead of a red onion because i was out of red.  I added three slices  bacon which I chopped and cooked ahead. The soup was very tasty.  We will definitely make this again.

When your hubby brings you a cabbage... you make cabbage soup!
I asked for lettuce but ended up with cabbage and I am glad although at first it felt like the end of the world haha. 
I am recovering from eye surgery and ended up with bronchitis to boot and this soup was so soothing to eat.

I didn't have any tomatoes on hand so I left them out and it is still such an amazing soup. I used 6 cups of beef broth and 2 cups of water in place of the chicken bouillon and water. I added sliced carrots and a can of corn, as well I used a whole onion.

This soup is awesome! I've done it with tomato paste cooked in with onions and garlic. I used cole slaw mix for quick prep and seasoned with fresh herbs (oregano, thyme, parsley, black pepper, chili powder). absolutely delicious!

it was super good- but i only added six and a half cups of water and like five bullion cubes and then half a package of bacon for extra taste, since some of the reviews said it was bland.

I used a full head of cabbage (chopped), 1 1/2 onion, 1 lb of baby carrots, 1 green pepper,  and 12 cups reduced sodium chicken broth and olive oil as needed.   I brought the chicken broth to a boil and put in the chopped cabbage, meanwhile I chopped the onion and pepper and fried in olive oil for about ten minutes.  When cooked I added it in with the cabbage.  No salt, pepper, etc. was added.  After cooking on a low boil for 30-35 minutes I used my immersion mixer to blend the ingredients.  It tastes great and is relatively low in calories.

This was great. My family liked it and asked to me to make it again. I didn't have any Italian tomatoes on hand, so I used plan ones and added some oregano and basil. I served it with grilled ham and cheese for a hearty week-night meal.

I cooked the onions and garlic in a separate pan. Add to the broth less than a tsp of thyme and crushed red pepper, no salt. I used GoBio chicken bouillon (no slat, gluten free, organic). I included the liquid from the peeled canned tomatoes, since the soup was getting thick. I had some celery and carrots, so added that too. Nice easy recipe, and versatile allowing me to add what I had hand.  I liked it and will make it again. Thanks.

Changes- didn't have bullion so I used 1 pack onion soup and half can tomato paste and added water. Easy and always goes over big for a cold day's dinner.
Being a vegan dish- goes well with hot italian sausage or leftover rotisserie chicken.

I made this last night. I used "fresh"(grown in some warm country. NOT here this time of year)tomatoes, carrots 
& added chickpeas for protein. I doubled the garlic & onion plus added crushed red pepper to get the sinuses flowing. Oh and good organic chicken broth, comes in a pourable box. The brand name is "Imagine". This is not watery, clear broth. It's just like real chicken stock. VERY good. I sent my husband off to work with a bowl for lunch.

I came across this due to health reasons. I had to drastically change my diet. I make this about once a month. I do change it up a little. I use chicken broth instead of bullion, I use crushed canned tomato  and I add celery. I also double the whole recipe. Sometimes I add whatever meat is available to my bowl before reheating. It's terrific with ground sausage, by the way, or chicken. It has truly been a life saver. Thank you so much for posting. It's my favorite meal, plus it's ultra healthy and filling .

I added some chopped carrots and celery to the saute.  And, I added some crushed red pepper flakes for some heat.  I don't use bouillon if I can help it because of the sodium so I used boxed stock.  Finish with some chopped parsley!!

in a word- wonderful! I loosely followed the recipe- chopped 2 small red cabbages, used 1 qt each of chicken stock and vegetable stock, added a few small summer squash, sliced, onion, tomatoes, splash of olive oil, red pepper flakes, 1 seeded and chopped jalapeno,2 peeled and cubed turnips, turnip greens, minced garlic, and some oregano. My husband, who doesn't like leftovers, but LOVES cabbage ate this 4 days in a row and said it was SO GOOD! The second day we had it, he added sliced smoked sausage. Delicious! WILL definitely make again!

I made it with purple cabbage, and threw all ingredients into the slow cooker in the morning so it was ready by lunch.  This soup is quick and very easy, and also tasty. It's a five star recipe for me!

I did make with chicken broth instead of water and bouillon cubes and added a can of Ro-Tel and some celery. This is fantastic soup, my husband and I both love it. It is light and easy on your stomach if you are not feeling well and yet hearty and filling if you are. Add a big chunk of sourdough bread and chow down! Definitely added to our "crave" list.

I added hamburger, which I boiled in water, drained then added after the onions, with everything else.  I also doubled the recipe and used 2 cans of crushed tomatoes instead of diced tomatoes.  I added a LOT of pepper.  I really enjoyed it, hubby thought it was good enough.  Of course, the kids didn't like it, though.  I didn't use as much water, but still used more bullion cubes.1

I've made this soup many times and love it. I use all organic ingredients and add chicken thighs, oregano, cayenne pepper and sometimes a pinch of rhyme or some fresh cilantro. The best.

I followed other suggestions and added more onion, in addition to celery, carrots, and hot turkey Italian sausage.  I made a huge pot and have eaten bowls of it over the last two days.  It is good for my soul as I nurse myself back to health from a cold.  Next time I will add a little more seasoning.  Delicious!!!

This is a very simple and quick soup to make.  I did add carrots since it was in the photo.  This soup is full of flavor.   When I reheated the leftover soup for a second meal I did add Italian sausage to it to create a new layer of flavor. This is a great soup as is or with additional items added to it.
 After making the soup I thought that if someone did not want to chop or cut the the vegetables that one could pick up the items that were already prepped.

I added red pepper flakes, and twice the garlic. I also substituted vegetable broth to keep it vegetarian. I make this soup at least once a month and serve it often to the delight of everyone who eats it. 

It makes a great comfort food for for people suffering flu, a cold, or even the blues.

I can't believe how much I enjoyed this soup, I wasn't expecting this to be so savory. My one modification was to use an entire chopped onion (was worried I wouldn't use the remaining half of onion). It took longer to sweat the onion out, but it was definitely worth it! Saved this as a favorite, will absolutely make again!

This is delicious!  I will make it again...contemplating sauteing the onions and garlic in a little bacon grease next time, and maybe adding some kielbasa to it.  Served it with cornbread muffins with butter and honey...awesome comfort soup!

I added an extra teaspoon or two of chicken bouillon and an extra teaspoon of crushed garlic as I found the recipe slightly bland. Love how light it is, though. Will definitely make it again.

A good recipe to start with.. but even better when you throw in your own touches.. I added a stalk of celery, tsp of celery seed, and 2 tsps. of parsley flakes with the cabbage.. with the tomatoes ( I used 2 cans), I added a can of chick peas to up the fiber and 2 handfuls of spinach.. I also added a couple teaspoons of sugar to cut tartness and it came out absolutely delicious. I'll be enjoying this soup for my lunch this week. Thanks for a great recipe :)

I made a few additions to this soup. I added sliced red peppers, 1/8 cup quinoa, 1/4 cup lentils, a teaspoon of minced ginger, and a can of coconut milk to this recipe. Also I used vegetable boullion instead of chicken to make it 100% vegan. Really tasty!

Holy moly, what a  nice tasting soup, thanks Kathy. Did I make changes, I used bullion cubes that I had on hand, the same amount as mentioned. I also used the canned tomatoes AND juice in the can to give the soup a nice color. This soup is tasty, sweet from the cabbage and the  broth I could drink by itself it is so good.  It is 90 degrees outside, make it summer or winter, cooks up in a hurry.

I liked it very much.  It gives a lot of flavor for few calories.  I used 6 bouillon cubes , 4 cloves garlic , One small onion and a small head of cabbage.  If you are trying to lose weight this is great.

This has a good flavor and am sure leftovers will be better, I think I am feeling better already .  I was looking for a recipe to use cabbage and half an onion and glad I found this.  I have been feeling under the weather so needed something super easy with lots of leftovers and good for a queasy stomach.    I used less oil and part veggie bouillion and part chicken (half the amount called for and half the water).  Wish I felt  good enough to go get some crusty french bread.

I absolutely love this recipe. I tweeked it up a bit by using 1 quart of swanson chicken broth instead of the bullion and 1 quart of water, adding pieces of chicken tenderloin, sautéing celery together with the garlic and onions, adding carrots, and using canned diced tomatoes with basil and oregano together with its juices. I also used 3/4 of a cabbage head. This recipe was perfect, felt hardy, and was just purely enjoyable. I absolutely loved the texture of the cabbage.

I added some thinly sliced carrots for color and a little sweetness.  I also used canned Italian precut tomatoes and did not drain so I also added addition soup base to compensate.  Doing so made the soup reddish and not clear.  I also sautéed everything, even the cabbage, because I've found once tomatoes/sauce is added to cabbage it all but quits cooking.  This is a lovely, easy soup to make, versatile  and tasted yummy.   Thanks for sharing

This was OK. I used chicken stock instead of water and bouillon. granules. It seemed to need more spices, although I was pleased with how it turned out. After the initial cooking, I let it cool down and then gently reheated it. Eating the last of it this evening! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

i added carrots and celery and zuccini as well as  the spices in KathyLC 's review and i always add sour salt to my veggie soups so i never add salt till after it cooks a while and then i taste it. Sour salt is ascorbic acid and that is Vit. C.  with changes i give it a 5 star review.

I loved this soup! I used red cabbage, added a few carrots, and a can of diced tomatoes. I also used up some chicken broth we had left over. Delicious and cleansing!

We needed a simple, nutritious meal, and this was perfect! I used 1 quart of chicken stock and 1 quart of vegetable stock (what I had) and added some corn. We had some good bread with it. I will make this again for sure!

I LOVE this soup. I make it all the time and will eat it until it's gone! I usually add an a can of diced tomatoes in addition to the stewed tomatoes .. and I also use low sodium chicken broth instead of the bullion. Or both, depending on what I have on hand.  ?

I thoroughly enjoyed this soup!  The scent was wonderful and it clears out your sinuses.  I use garlic broth instead of chicken, and I will make that the usual recipe.  

It was great in a bowl by itself.  I also heated up individual portions and poached a white fish fillet in them.  That dinner was a hit as well.

I LOVE this soup. I make it for cleansing purposes and can't get enough of it. I double the recipe, add jalapeno peppers to boost with metabolism, and throw in just about every veggie you can think of. I like a LOT of fresh ground pepper, and hardly any salt. It tastes fresh and spicy, and I never get tired of it.

I made this overnight in a crockpot based on comments that it tasted better the next day. It is Delicious! I threw everything in the pot without first sautéing the garlic or onion. I had fresh ginger on hand so I grated that in and added a shake of cayenne pepper.I cooked in on high for 2 hours then warm all night and morning. LOVE it!

Good soup,I  made with beef broth celery, pepper and a small zucchini. To those who thought bland, I thought same thing, so I left on low boil thinking it needed to cook down a lot more. After about three hours of simmering it was exactly like cabbage soup supposed to taste.

Delicious. Made changes. Per other raters' suggestions, used Italian seasoning, added white beans, and added white potatoes. Also added red pepper flakes and cayenne pepper (powdered) seasoning to taste.

I found a keeper!  The hubs loved it but my changes were V8 instead of tomato juice, added garlic, pepper and salt.  I omitted the green pepper as I do not like them.  I am NOT a cabbage fan, but loved this soup!

Such a great basic recipe...thank you!  I add potatoes, onions, garlic and replace Italian stewed with diced then add my own basil and oregano. Sautee all and then add vegetable stock for a wonderful vegetarian meal.

I have made this simple soup several times and I can't seem to ever get enough!  As a vegetarian, I use part water and part vegetable broth.  I always double it, and find that usually within a week, it's gone.  My boyfriend loves it so much that when he starts to feel poorly, he'll have a steady diet of cabbage soup, ginger tea, and orange juice.  I add fresh carrots (because, hey, who doesn't like carrots?!) and, if I have celery, I chop up some celery and add it, too.  I tend to like a slightly thicker soup, so I'll add croutons but that's me.    I love, Love, LOVE this soup!  I recently saw someone put mushrooms in and I'm definitely going to try that next time this soup is being desired, and in this cold weather, it's desired more and more!

I love this soup and use an entire head of cabbage so I end up making a huge pot.  I can freeze it in containers and take one a day for lunches.  It is simple and I can use just about any vegetables I have on hand to add to it.  I've used peppers, squash,  celery...anything.  One thing I love to do is add half an avocado and a splash of fresh lemon juice to it right after heating.  This one is a keeper and I've made it several times!!

Probably should have cut recipe in half for the first time. Used green and red cabbage so the broth is almost purple. It's ready for a cold winter's day.

Enjoyed learning how to make cabbage soup with this recipe.  I tailored it a bit, adding carrots, celery, whole onion vs. half, and vegetable broth.

So tasty!!  The only things I did tweak a little was I used fresh tomatoes (always a must for me ;) ), white pepper and just for a little color I added just a some green onion.  Great recipe!  Thank you!!

I made the soup on a week night on a cool September evening. I changed it by adding fresh herbs,  celery, baby carrots, potatoes, 1 banana pepper , & chicken.  Served it with grilled Basil tomato bread topped with mozeralla cheese. I added jalapeños to mine bowl. :-)

I've never had cabbage soup before, let alone even made it. I don't like Sauerkraut, so I  wasn't interested, but, having half a head of cabbage left over from another beef soup recipe, and having a vegetarian friend over the following day, I decided to look up cabbage soup and stumbled across this one. I made it exactly as specified (except I added celery I also had around), but it seemed to taste a bit bland. Based on reviews, I upped the garlic and chicken broth flavoring (I used "Better than Bouillon" Chicken), upped the salt and pepper a touch, and added some basil and Italian herbs. After simmering, I cautiously tasted the broth. It seemed pretty good. I poured a small bowl. It was really good. I poured another bigger bowl. It was DELICIOUS! I then poured an even bigger bowl full. IT WAS AMAZING! This is among the best soup flavors I've ever experienced. No lie!

This tasted good but it was too much cabbage for me.  I was planning to have this soup for my lunches during the week.  However, the gas from the cabbage hurt my stomach so badly after the first two days, I threw the rest out.  If you aren't impacted by cabbage in large quantities in this way, enjoy!  If you are similar to me, this one is just too much to take, steer clear!

This was great! I did as others  before me , and added chicken broth instead of the boullion. Also put in carrots, celery, a can of corn and red pepper flakes. My husband is a big fan of this soup and said to put it on the "Make this again" list!

OMG!  This is the recipe my Dad used and was lost when he died!  We have been searching for 19 years!!!! Every other recipe had carrots, meat, or other stuff in it...the only change Dad made was he used V8 instead of the stewed tomatoes!  My daughter is going to be delighted..it was her favorite!!!  Thank you so much I can't wait to make it for her this Sunday!!!!

This turned out way better than I was expecting. Just cabbage and tomatoes. Who would have thought! I did add a can of beans, and I think a bag of shaved carrots would be an excellent addition. I also used a pound of fresh diced tomatoes as opposed to the can because we had so many from our garden. Very yummy.

I do apologize, I can't review the exact recipe, I know that's annoying. I used chicken stock (lower sodium) instead of the bouillon granules, and I didn't have the tomatoes so I used a red bell pepper. I added ground turkey, and some various veggies I had on hand. The nice thing about this recipe is that it's flexible.

This is a fantastic recipe that's delicious as written. I've made this many times since joining here, and it's one of my favorites.

Even while it's great as is, I often tweak it a bit for my personal taste by adding a few carrots and some cauliflower, some oregano, and some hot sauce to give it a little bit of heat.

Thanks you for this simple and delicious recipe!

Great Soup. It's easier to double it.  Use the full 2 lb cabbage and onion.  It freezes really well, and is even better re-heated. I used 2 tablespoons of crushed garlic in oil instead of the cloves. Also, I use a hand blended to blend it all together, which makes it feel more substantial.  Delicious!!

I loved this receipe, the only change I made was adding whole peeled tomatoes.  Next time I am going to use both red and white cabbage.  Thanks for posting.  We loved it!  PS I hate tomatoes, hence using whole tomatoes, but I will admit, the tomatoes gave the broth so much flavor...and I could enjoy the soup without having to eat the tomatoes.

Awesome! I always add about 1 heaping tablespoon cornstarch dissolved in cool liquid to my soups; which smooths out the flavours and adds to their eye appeal. Oh, and with this particular recipe, I threw in a package of chicken noodle soup mix just because it had been hanging around in my cupboard waiting for some action. Worked great. Need I say this is now a pillar of my cooking repetoire?

Made this soup,but added cooked canned lentils and white beans and used vegetable stock in place of some of the water for added flavor. Very tasty with some crackers or crusty bread for dipping! I split this into two separate pots and added two small cans of flaked tuna to one of them for added protein- it sounds strange but turned out surprisingly delicious! Would definitely make this again.

Super easy. Super good. Super comforting. Made exactly as written, although probably used more than half a head of cabbage. Cannot even imagine how great this would hit the spot when you are not feeling well! Great for a cold night. Thanks for submitting this! Loved it!

I had as dozen Roma's left from my garden so I used them and a table spoon of Italian seasoning. Also added a cup of cubed ham at the end of the cooking time. Next time I will use the full head of cabbage and add carrots.

My mother-in-law made this once and I liked it so much I made it too. I added a can of kidney beans and loaded up the garlic. Once I ladled it into bowls my husband and I added a shot of sriracha. Yum.

This was a success. I substituted 2 1/2 quarts of organic chicken broth. I added about 6 carrots chopped, 3 chopped Roma tomatoes, a can of northern beans (drained), as well as sprinkling some odd amount of dried basil and Italian herbs. The kicker was a heaping tablespoon of turmeric. It turned everything yellow but it tasted incredible. Our 2 year old ate 2 bowls.

I used 2 quarts of homemade chicken broth instead of boullion cubes and water. Super yummy and healing.

I made this soup yesterday because I wanted some homemade soup in the fridge. (I hate canned soup)  It is absolutely delicious!  At the suggestion of other reviewers, I added carrots, small white beans and 1/2 link of smoked beef kielbasi diced.  Excellent!  I will be using this recipe as a base for many other variations.  Thank you JGCASE!

I adjusted the recipe for 6 people, added 1# ground venison, about 3 cups V8, a cup of quick barley, and a pinch of dry basil and went outside to work in he garden while it simmered. It was amazing and inexpensive. Homemade garlic bread  well. A definite 5 star and I think I  see if I can can it too.

Very very good and easy to make. Made this when I was sick and it was really helpful. I love cabbage and used a roasted spicy tomatoes and it gave it a slight kick.

WOW!!!
I had some leftover cabbage from cabbage rolls and made this instead of throwing it out like I often do... this recipe is a permanent new addition to my cabbage roll nights!
The cabbage was frozen (for cabbage rolls) but I thought it worked very well for the soup.
I just eyed out the amount of pepper and I may have added more than called for but I found the pepper overwhelmed the soup a bit so I will cut back next time (my boyfriend disagreed but he loves peppery food)
So delicious and healthy/guilt free to eat.
Thanks for a great recipe!!

Made this tonight.  Didn't have the onion so I used onion flakes. Also added carrots and celery like the old awesome weight loss soup recipe. It turned out just perfect.  My boyfriend and I decided we wouldn't change a thing.  The broth was awesome by itself.

I was honestly hesitant about this soup. It seemed really basic and I figured it wouldn't be all that great. I WAS WRONG! This soup turned out really delicious! It was a great way to use up the cabbage in my fridge. I added an extra teaspoon of garlic, celery, and carrots, all of which I sauteed in the beginning with the onions. I also added about 2 tsp. of Italian seasoning and an extra tsp of black pepper. YUMMY! This is great since it is all veggies, it worked out great for my Weight Watchers points!! WOO HOO! :D

Great as is.  Simple, low effort to make this while cooking up your main dish at the same time.  Good flavor.  Low calorie.

Since St Patricks Day is tomorrow, my market had cabbage on sale for 19 cents a head. I didn't have the tomatoes, but I had a can or organic tomato soup. Added a couple of pinches of cayenne pepper, a sprinkle of soy sauce, a splash of apple cider vinegar and a can of black beans. Best soup I ever made!

I didn't read the directions correctly--only added 1 quart of water. DIDN'T MISS the other quart. I threw in 4 carrots because I needed to use 'em up. Other than that I stuck to the rest of the recipe. YUMMERZ! Think I'll add corned beef next time. Thanks for sharing.

Good and healthy. I had a  hard time trying to get the cabbage and tomatoes to the consistency. I ended up taking them out of the soup and putting them in the blender to dice them really thin them put it back into the soup.  
Great filler and healthy so you don't feel bad about eating it severely times a day.  Will make it often

Have made this multiple times as is, and some more times with some "tweaks". Absolutely delicious as is, but I like to put the garlic in with the tomatoes to give the soup more garlic flavor. This is definitely a keeper.

I just made this for dinner tonight. Great the way it is written. But, I added smoked sausage, more garlic, onion, tomatoes and chopped green chili's for a little kick. My husband loved it.

Thank you

This was really good.  We are part of a co-op and had an abundance of cabbage, so I was looking for different recipes to utilize it.  I added some carrots and celery that I happen to have on hand to it as well.

This is a really delicious and simple soup to make. I used all organic ingredients including the spices and used 1/2 head Napa / 1/2 head Savoy cabbage. Rather than the bouillon I used some bone marrow broth (I am nearly entirely Paleo) and dried thyme that I grow in my window and keep hanging in my kitchen. I highly recommend adding two pinches of the dried thyme...rally punched it up for me! I also used a fresh carrot sliced thin and 8 cloves of garlic rather than 2. I can literally feel my immunity increasing as I eat it. I will make this again and again...enjoy!

I've made this 3 times and love it.  My husband even went back for 2nds even though there is no meat!  I altered it by adding carrots & celery w/ the onion and added 6 stems of kale to the mix when the cabbage was added. I also added cannellini beans with the tomatoes.  I used low sodium chicken broth but it needed a kick so I added a little seasoned salt w/ some red pepper flakes.

This recipe was very easy to fallow but it needed more umph. I used 2 carrots thinly sliced along with the onion and garlic. Then I added 1/2 pound ground beef to my saute and made sure not to over cook the beef. Then added the water but cut the chicken bouillon amount in half and substituted the other half with beef boullion. Then instead of only letting it cook 30 min. I let it cook for 1 hour. It turned out great and was very filling. I think the next time I make it I will add half head broccali and a quarter head coliflower just for the health benefits.

I tried this today and I loved it. I changed it up a bit by adding more garlic, onions, and tomatoes, and I added cauliflower. I also only used 1 tbsp of olive oil instead of 3 and plain diced tomatoes, and I used organic chicken bouillon cubes but I doubt that makes a difference. I'm sure the original recipe tastes great too. My recipe came out to only 39 calories/cup. Very low calorie if your looking for that.

I look at this soup as not just soup, but medicine.  It is wonderful to have this when sick, and I do believe it helps.  Instead of using chicken bouillon granules, I use chicken broth.

My wife and I really enjoyed this recipe; it was so simple, yet so good.  I only made one change (I can hear the growls now):  I substituted vegetable broth for the chicken since we're vegetarians.  During this week of record lows, it really hit the spot!

Instead of chicken broth, I made stock from a ham bone and then used the ham and added it after the cabbage and tomato. Also added shaved carrots, and the spices....marjoram, basil and oregano.

An absolutely delicious recipe, and very easy with its limited ingredients.  I was sick and this was so comforting, and my husband raved about how good it was and had the leftovers for breakfast. I did make a few changes based on what I had in the pantry and another cabbage soup recipe I had just seen.  I started by dicing and frying 4 slices of bacon (froze it halfway first to make it easy to dice), drained most of the fat and add 2 tablespoons of olive oil to cook the onion and garlic.  The bacon added a mild richness but did not add a bacon flavor.  Bouillon has way too much salt so I used chicken stock and no added salt. I doubled the tomatoes, and as I didn't have Italian Style Tomatoes used Fire Roasted w/chilies which added just the perfect amount of heat, plus I added 1/2 tsp. of Italian Seasoning.  I served with thick slices of crusty bread!  This will become a regular winter time meal.

Very good.  I had left over chopped cabbage, onions, and carrots for slaw and didn't want to waste them.  I added a little ground pork and had pork soup base instead of chicken.  I felt this recipe would adapt well to other veggies and a little added meat or sausage.  Served with good bread, it is a great meal.

I was skeptical because it seemed so boring, but curious because of the high ratings. I agree w/ the positive reviews, who knew such a simple soup could be so delicious! I did sauté carrots and celery w/ the onions and added crushed red pepper flakes. Will definitely make again and again. It freezes well too.

Ok, a little salty with all that stock, even though I didn't add the salt.  But tasty.  I didn't add all the extras other people did though.

The best cabbage soup in the world. I have made this so many times I do not need a recipe. I have kept to the original recipe, but sometimes add a bit more garlic.It is super easy to  make, cooks quickly and my family absolutely loves it. It is my husband's favourite.  This is in my recipe rotation at least every two weeks.

I love cabbage soup and this is almost the same as mine, but I add a potato and carrot... great with beef instead of chicken and just a tad of liquid smoke.

I loved this soup and I don't even like cabbage that much! (ha)I made a few changes, like adding more onion and using chicken broth instead of bullion cubes. I also added scrambled mild sausage and it is delicious. You can make changes to suit your taste but the basic recipe that was listed is great. Make it your own!

This was delish.  I got sad because my bowl for lunch was finished.  

I doubled the recipe (except for the boullian) and added just a lil basil, thyme, majoram and rosemary for extra seasoning because it was so simple i thought it might be bland.  I also added raw spinach and baked tilapia.

This was a winner!

Good basic recipe, worth adding a few extras.  I threw in oregano, fresh parsley, chili flakes, doubled the onion and garlic and added chopped kale and shredded carrots for good measure.  Delicious!

This soup was great but I admit that I used vegetable broth (vegetarians) and added 5 carrots, 3 potatoes, and 3 stalks of celery to it, along with some sriracha sauce as I like to spice things up. I was worried at the amount of cabbage but once it all mixes in there, it's perfect! Thank you for this recipe - even my hubby, who isn't a big fan of cabbage, gobbled down two bowls and asked to have this put into the regular rotation.

Love this soup, it's my new favorite! I wanted to bang my head against the wall every time I got cabbage in my CSA box(not a slaw fan), now I finally have a plan for all that cabbage! It's a great recipe, but I felt it wasn't complete with out a meat substance so I added Polish sausage links, browned and cut up. I have the freezer stocked up and ready for winter.

This is awesome soup.  I love the basic recipe, but then I add whatever veggies are in the crisper and it just makes it yummier.  This time I added zucchini, carrots, potatoes, and celery plus leftover chicken breast.  I took the advice of another reviewer and added oregano, thyme, parsley and cayenne, which just brought its savoriness to a whole new level. I had two bowls for dessert tonight after dinner!

Good base, not even seasoning. I added baby red potatoes, yellow squash, and carrots. When it was done, my husband and I added hot sauce to our bowls lol. My 22 month old daughter ate it up, which surprised me! We will be making this again- I had just been looking for a way to use the cabbage from our food co-op and I'm glad I found this.

I admittedly changed a few things and thus didn't try the original recipe. However what I ended up with was much enjoyed. I used two quarts of organic chicken stock instead of the water and bouillon. I had a small head of cabbage and I just used the whole thing. I added sliced carrots as well as their greens and dandelion greens as well. The bitter greens worked really well in this soup. I also added four links of organic kielbasa which delivered a magnificent spice to the broth. I will definitely be making this again.

I am sure this soup is perfect the way it is, but I used it as a base for a bigger soup. Added a jalapeno for the flavor, carrot, potato, celery, zucchini, red and green bell pepper. Used chicken broth instead of water. Along with salt and pepper, added some red pepper flakes, cayenne pepper, and a little bit of chardonnay for flavor. Turned out to be delicious!!! Wife and Father loved it, I loved it. Thanks so much for the recipe!

I added a 1/2 cup of brown rice. I also used pre-shredded cabbage since that's all Trader Joe's had! It worked and it was very delicious, but I want to use big chunks of cabbage next time. I love it when I get that earthy cabbage taste- but you need it in big chunks to get that I think.. I also used like 8 cloves of garlic because I love garlic. Yummy!!! I will definitely be making this again.

I really liked this recipe, but I read over the other reviews and made a few changes and additions. I used olive oil cooking spray at the beginning to saute the onions and garlic. I also only had the bullion cubes so I just added 4 of those for the 8 cups of water to make it with chicken stock. I added about a teaspoon of Italian seasoning and a pinch  of cayenne pepper. I also had leftover some leftover kidney beans so just threw them in and it was a great touch!  Even my boyfriend who does not like veggie soups ate it all and more. Some hamburger would be nice in it too I think but still a great base recipe.

Had some leftover cabbage and a miserable cold so decided to try this even though I'm not a fan of cabbage. So glad I did! Used my own chicken and vegetable stock from the freezer, added 1/2 cup barley, shredded the cabbage and some carrots in the food processor. Delicious comfort food. Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious! I made mine with all organic ingredients and it was fantastic. The only thing I did differently was use organic vegetable broth. Wondering what this would taste like with organic ground beef added to it--pretty wonderful, I would imagine! Terrific recipe!

Made this on a day when my husband and I were not feeling good.  Used Savoy cabbage; added carrots and celery.  Chopped up tomato but also included the juice.  Used canned low-sodium broth.  Water never adds flavor and I don't use bouillon cubes.  Next time I will probably add potatoes.  Very good soup and really is a comfort food when you don't feel good but will eat other times too.  So simple and fast to make.  Will definitely make again.

I'm not sure if it's fair for me to rate this, as I did make some changes.  I added sliced carrots while sauteing the onions, doubled the garlic, used homemade stock and omitted the bouillon, and added very healthy dashes of cayenne pepper, pepper flakes and paprika as well as added more italian seasoning (the flavor wasn't very strong on the tomatoes, which I didn't drain).  It was delicious.

Overall it was good.  I added some carrot that added some color to the soup.  I wish the sauce was a bit thicker.  Next time I'll look to thicken the sauce with some potatoe flakes.

I tried this exactly as written and thought it was pretty good.  However I like my own recipe a tad better which is similar but not the same.  Mine is similar to alot of other reviewers who made changes to this recipe.

Delicious! I used broth instead of water and added sliced smoked sausage and spinach. Next time I'll leave out the salt too, I think the broth had enough. Delicious though!

This was tasty-great for a cold night. I don't use bouillon, so I used 2 cups chicken broth, 2 cups vegetable broth, & 4 cups water ;) I misread the recipe and added plain diced tomatoes by mistake, but countered it by adding 1 tsp Italian seasoning (1/2 with the salt & pepper, 1/2 with the tomatoes). The flavor was great, especially with a little Parmesan a baguette. But it's not filling enough for a full meal-I calculated that 2 cups is only 160 calories :(

This was exceptional! It was so easy to make, inexpensive and healthy! We added more garlic (because we love garlic), celery and carrots. Next time I think I will add julianned potatoes and maybe pasta! It was a cold day today and this soup was the perfect addition!

Even better than I expected.  I only made a few minor adjustments to the original recipe.  I used 1 whole onion, canned diced tomatoes (undrained), 3 chopped celery stalks, 1/2 beef and 1/2 chicken bouillon, Italian seasoning and dried parsley, omitted the salt, and substituted 2 cups of the water with some thick home-canned, lightly-seasoned tomato juice.  Other than those changes, I followed the recipe, and it turned out to be very flavorful!  The next day I added some leftover ground beef that had been sauteed with Rotel...really good!  Next time I make it, I'll add hamburger to begin with!  Great low-carb recipe!

This has become my favorite soup.  I make it at least twice a monthy, especially if we have been sick.  Some things i do different that have worked out well for me is I add 1 box of chicken broth and a little water.  I like the soup a little thicker and not so much broth.  I am so glad I found this recipe.

Like everyone else, I customized this recipe.  Added a little chopped Celery, ground White Pepper (mmmmm, spicy and helps clear the sinuses), and about 1/4 tsp of Sugar to cut the acid in the tomatoes.  I had some homemade chicken stock in the freezer that needed to be used, but added water to fill in the remaining 2 quarts along with 2 Knorr Chicken bouillion cubes (they are huge).  There really isn't a way to mess up this soup, and you can add or subtract as you like!

Excellent soup with great flavor.  Instead of bouillon, use 2, 32 ounce,low sodium chicken broths for the base.  I add more onion and an extra clove of garlic and a pinch of cayenne.  Can also add carrot, celery and/or potato to make it more filling!

This soup turned out really good and was super easy to make with things I had in the pantry. Added a carrot and stalk of celery to the onions to beef up the flavor. I also used a small head of green and purple cabbage to give it a more appealing color composition. A great healthy and satisfing meal if you are watching your figure or just trying to eat more healthy.

I added cannelloni beans, green beans, 1/2 tsp of hot sauce and 1/2 cup of freshly grated Parmesan cheese to really top this off nicely.

Ever since I have found this recipe, I have made it at least once a month. I use one head of cabbage the roasted garlic basil tomatoes and like to add a little cayenne pepper to spice it up.  Great recipe, definitely worth trying!

Healing is the right word, you will love this soup in the winter. I made as is and then with additional vegetables, both times it was delicious, I cannot wait to make this again. The first time I made it I couldn't stop helping myself to small portions before everyone came home for dinner, so good and flavorful.

Definately yummy.  I added my own stuff to it as many other people did.   A great perk to this soup is that it cooks quickly and does taste like it simmered all day.  I was feeling lazy when I made this so I used a bag of shredded cabbage and shredded carrots to make the soup.  I also added celery and used marinara sauce instead of a can of stewed tomatoes.  For seasoning I used salt, pepper, rosemary (dried), and fresh basil.  This is a recipe definately worth making.  I will be making this again.

Yummy!  Of course, customized it to our family preferences but this recipe is a very good starting point.  I sauteed up some bacon pieces with the onion and garlic.  I added some celery and more spices.  The bacon was very complementary since it added a nice smoky flavor to the soup.

So good! I tweaked though. I wanted something for my crock pot, so I put in a head of cabbage, approx a box of chicken broth, 2 cans stewed mexican style tomatoes, 2 stalks celery chopped, 1 small onion chopped, 1-2 cups chopped baby carrots, 2 cups sliced mushrooms (sauteed first), 1/4 cup of lentils, and garlic powder. Mix all together in a crock pot and cook on low for 6 hours. I made corn muffins to go with and the sweet with the spicy juices were sooo good! Tasted even better the next day. 
Very good and easily customizable recipe. Perfect for a fall day! :)

I love this soup. So easy to make and so delicious. The aroma gets everyone's attention. Sometimes I add a half pound of browned ground beef when I add the tomatoes to get a meat kick with the soup. I make this soup at least twice a month.

THANK YOU for posting this!  I got a head of cabbage from my organic delivery service and did not know what to do with it.  I doubled up this recipe and added hot sauce (I love a spicy soup), and it is DELICIOUS!  So easy too!  Thank you so much, if you hadn't posted it all that food would have gone to waste and I would have had a boring old sandwich.

I add an extra can of tomatoes (I don't drain them), 2 thinly sliced carrots, 2 thinly sliced zuchinnis and serve with a couple boiled potatoes (don't cook these in the soup, or they get crumbly and gross). Also, I add some Italian seasoning (about 1-2 tsps) for extra flavor.  SO cheap, and very delicious.

This is really yummy! It made far too much for one person to eat, so I'll have to freeze some servings for later. I added a cup of rice when I added the tomatoes, and ate the soup with a crispy tortilla rather than bread. Very delicious. I used 1 quart water and 1 quart chicken broth rather than the bouillion cube.

Delicious and nutritious!  Thanks for a great base recipe for cabbage soup. We served this for a community soup meal here and it was well loved. We had lots of vegetables donated for this dinner so we added chopped cauliflower, potatoes, celery, carrots and parsley. Fantastic!

Yum!  Like many others, I changed a few things.  I didn't use the 3 Tbsp olive oil, but gave the pot a healthy spray of olive oil spray, instead.  I used a bag of frozen "soup mix" that had a blend of onion, celery, bell pepper, and parsley.  It didn't have much parsley, so I added a little fresh chopped that I had on hand.  I also added a can of new potatoes (drained and cut into bite-size pieces), some Italian seasoning, and a few squirts of sun-dried tomato paste.  I used a 32 oz box of chicken broth instead of the water and bouillon, and that seemed to be just right.  It's great!!  I recommend serving with the Crisp Corn Breadsticks http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/recipefinder/crisp-corn-breadsticks-recipe-ghk1110?click=recipe_sr

Maybe the original recipe is excellent. For me it was a great basis for my version. I used 1 quart purchased chicken stock, 1 quart water with two veggie boullion cubes. To the ingredients listed in the original recipe, I added 1/2 tsp or so of crushed dried oregano leaves, about a quarter cup of dry red wine, a can of lima beans, and for some zip -- 3 pepperomias. I added the oregano early in the cook time and the rest near the end. This was a perfect cabbage soup for me.

This recipe is a solid four as is, but once you make it your own, its a five, for sure. I added the other half of the onion and cabbage, along with some more garlic and pepper. Make sure its piping hot when you serve it!

Pretty good.  I added cut up potatoe, carrots and celery to make it more of veggie soup.  I also used vegetable bouillon instead of chicken bouillon to keep it vegetarian.

So delicious and healthy tasting! This hit the spot to sooth my cold symptoms and sore throat.  Made some minor changes:  Added NO salt, since bouillon naturally has more than enough salt to flavor. Added a few sprigs of fresh Italian parsley, several dashes of dried oregano & basil, to bring out the Italian flavors of the stewed tomatoes. Totally addicting!

Yum! I just made this for the second time and it very easy to make and tasty. I didn't have Italian -style tomatoes so I just used regular diced tomatoes and then added Italian seasonings and red pepper flakes. This soup is just delicious!

Wonderful soup.  I added a couple of potatoes and carrots and some celery, used chicken broth in place of the water.  I didn't have any stewed tomato's but I had a can of diced Italian flavored tomato's.  I will certainly make this again and to make it more hearty I wouln't hesitate to add some chopped ham .  It does taste even better the next day.  Thanks for another keeper JGCase

Incredible!  I have made this a hundred times and it always come out perfect.  This is good any time, but especially good when you have a cold.  I add a little crushed red pepper when I add the tomatoes.  Gives it a kick and clears out the sinuses!

I tried this soup and it was great. I did make a small change though. Instead of using a can of Italian stewed tomotoes, I purchased 4 medium sized tomoatoes and stewed them my self. Soup was great and the family loved it.

This is such a quick and easy soup to make and it tastes terrific.  I added a few carrots and some tabasco sauce and served it with freshly baked rolls from AR. I used savoy cabbage left over from the cabbage rolls I made a few days ago.

AMAZING. I added fresh rosemary, sage and fresh tomatoes. A dash of red pepper flakes, and a cup of lentils made for a hearty soup. Oh, and I used a full red onion. great flavor.

Excellent and extremely versatile. I used 4tablesp olive oil, 1 onion and 3 cloves garlic. I flavoured the soup with a few sprigs of fresh thyme, 1/2 teasp each dry marjoram and dry rosemary. I used 4 qts water and 2 bouillon cubes. I used 3/4 of a Savoy cabbage. I doubled up on the tomatoes - two 14.5oz cans - and used the liquid from the tomatoes - didn't drain them. I added a large parsnip and 4 carrots both sliced, which sweeten the broth. Delicious. Thanks for the recipe.

If you like very mild flavor you might enjoy this soup. This soup is too bland for me.  Adding more bouillon, more spice, 8 oz. of tomato sauce,  more onion and more garlic, plus a carrot made a decent soup.

Great soup! My fiance actually made this with left over cabbage after a night of cabbage rolls. We froze the soup cause there was a lot of it, so now when we get sick we can pull it out and cook it up. Really is a delicious soup and it does give some relief from colds. TX!!!

This is a good starting point to a great soup, but it lacked flavour for me.  It was also a little too acidic because of the tomatoes.  I will be making it again once I learn more about what seasonings go well with cabbage, and I will be using ready-made chicken broth, because concentrated bouillon didn't seem to add enough taste to the cabbage.  It's still a good soup, and I will eat the rest, but I wouldn't serve it to anyone else, it's just too bland.  As for the amount of oil in this recipe, it could easily be reduced by half.  The film of fat on the surface of the soup is unappealing.

I've made this recipe twice and love it. I added a few things, some shredded carrots, andouille (cajun sausage)for spice.Like others I used chicken broth instead of water. It was fabulous. My family said this is definitely a keeper.

Easy & Delicious!  I made it Sunday and am making it again today (Thursday).  My husband ate some drained like cabbage with jerk chicken.  HE LOVED IT AND ASKED THAT I MAKE IT LIKE THAT FROM NOW ON!  Only change is I did not drain the canned tomatoes.

When I first looked at the ingredients, I thought it was going to be pretty bland....well it wasn't...I did make some subtle changes.....I used 4 cubes of chicken bouillon cakes, 1 tsp. kosher salt, added about 1 cup or organic chicken broth, 1 whole onion instead of just a half, and 1 tsp. italian seasoning......so yummy, light and goes well with a sandwich for supper.....

This is absolutely delicious. I recommend adding carrots and celery, the cabbage really soaks up their flavor. I made the soup last week and am getting ready for another round this week...its filling and healthy to top it all off.

I loved this soup.  Like most people I had to add something to it.  Twice the amount of garlic for me.  Wow, it was good enough for breakfast the next morning.  One of those things you will crave every once in a while.

I love this soup, I make it often for my roommates and boyfriend, (who does not even like vegetable soup, and they all rave about it) I use all the vegetables in this soup,and a little more,, whatever I have on hand. It is really forgiving and versatile, and so delicious, it doesn't even have to be cold. I highly recommend it because it really hits the spot ^^.

My husband and I did not care for this soup and we both love cabbage.  It just did not have much flavor.  We were very disappointed due to the great reviews of this recipe

This is one of my favorite recipes of all time. As written, it's a 4 star recipe. With a few generous shakes of red pepper flakes, extra chopped garlic, chicken stock instead of bullion, and a can of drained kidney beans, it is a 5 star cold-kickin', bone-warmin' soup! Try it! It's so cheap, easy, and delicious. I had two bowls today and can't wait for more tomorrow.

Great soup base, but I made a few changes that other reviewers advised. Sauteed onion, celery and carrots then added in garlic and sliced turkey breast. Added in a can of cannelini beans, tomatoes, then added in a bay leaf and thyme. Used 48 oz. low sodium chicken stock, then added in additional veggies like zucchini and squash. I know it seems like a lot of changes but my man won't eat it unless it's hearty so I had to bulk it up...LOL but like I said great soup base..and healthy!!

This was a delicious soup, but I found it lacking something. On my second preparation, I added some left over cut up ham which made it heartier for my taste. Next time I think I will try some smoked sausage.

This soup is amazing! I made a few substitutions to personalize it to my taste but it is a great base recipe. I used a whole head of cabbage and just used more stock and I also added a bag of frozen oriental stir fry veggies which just put this over the top. I have never eaten cabbage outside of coleslaw and I wanted to try something new and this hit the spot. Between my hubby and 3 year old we licked the pot clean!!!

This was very good. My half a cabbage was too much cabbage, but just a bit too much. For being so simple, this soup really is tastey.
I like some others added some chopped carrot, celery, italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, and upped the amount of garlic.
Very easy to make, nice to eat, easy to save.

Was a very nice soup! At first I was a little worried about the amount of cabbage because it seemed to much but in the end it was perfectly fine. My family loves strong tasted so added extra sea salt, pepper and garlic and I used fresh tomato's instead of out of a can. Surprisingly very tasty and full of flavor!

I love this soup.  First of all it is cheap to make, easy, and delicious.  I've already made it several times.  I like it best with the red pepper flakes in it per another persons suggestion.  I also add a bit more garlic(the fridge pre-chopped kind)makes it even easier and taste so good.

I've made this soup several times now and it has become a family favorite! I took the advice of others and added the spices and most important - the pinch of cayenne (you really need that kick when you're sick and the tastebuds aren't working properly). I also add whatever vegetables I have in the fridge that I want to use up. I find that the longer you simmer the soup, the better the flavor. This is an easy, healthy, flavorful and easily modified to what you have on hand recipe. Everyone should try it!!

Good but needed something more. I used italian diced tomatoes instead of italian stewed. The tomatoes may have made the difference. I will certainly make again though.

Best part about this recipe is the re-heat.  I made the original with the exception of 2 chicken boullions.  I then stored the sevings in seperate bowls, and each re-heat I added something different so it never got boring.  Parm.chs., balsamic vinegar, and tobasco bloody mary mix were some of my choices.

I tried making this with two fresh tomatoes that I needed to use up and it was really bland, so I ended up adding a can of stewed tomatoes. It was delicious. I also like this soup with a bit of vinegar or sauerkraut and some caraway seeds. It's also great with a can of pork and beans, but I admit that these versions are not for everyone. My husband won't touch them.

Mmm! So good and so simple! I changed the recipe a little by adding sauted carrots, mushroom, and celery.

Good, but not great. Tasted kind of generic, like any tomato based vegetable, minestrone-like soup. I used packaged chicken broth and Pomi packaged tomatoes for better flavor.

I loved it. So easy and it gets better after each day. Very light and a great way to use pantry items and things in the crisper that must be used before they spoil.

This was a good soup, but my DH & I both felt it would be better with the addition of sausage or fish, perhaps.  (We are obviously not vegetarians!)

I for one love soup, ESPECIALLY if I dont get it from a can! This was very good and wholesome....my 2 year old grand-daughter has never eaten soup before but after watching me eat it she took my spoon and decided to try it...ummm, she ate all my bowl up! Thankyou :) Next time I think I may add less garlic though, it was a bit over-powering but yet still wonderful.

This stuff is so good that you want a cold just to make the soup. I do not use the extra salt as I find the chicken bullion has enough sodium as it is.

this morning i made stuffed cabbage.  Since you only use the outermost leaves i had half a cabbage left.  I found this and figured i had all the ingredients I'd give it a shot.  Came out great.  I did add 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper just because i like it spicy.  It could also have used an extra garlic clove, but that's just me.  Someone else said something about Italian sausage, that would be FANTASTIC in here, some ground hot Italian sausage mixed in would give it a perfect taste.  But for a quick soup that tastes very good this is an excellent recipe.

Oh yes! This is a keeper! My entire family has a cold right now and I made this today and everyone loved it! I added some boiled potatoes to the pot but other than that, I left it basically the same. I think being "comfort food" makes the healing properties seem so much stronger! Will make it again tomorrow at everyones request!

Very easy & tasty!  I will definitely make this again, although next time I think I will try adding some type of meat for a more hearty meal.

This is a great recipe, but we added some smoked sausage and andouie sausage and used a can of italian tomatoes.  It was a little spicy but very good. I think it is good with this meat.

This recipe was alright, I guess. I didn't exactly make it the way that it recommended, so that could be why I wasn't amazed. I added two pounds of ground beef, just so that this would be a heartier meal. I will follow it exactly next time.
