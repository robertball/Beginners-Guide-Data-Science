This was amazing!  I used ground chicken, added one chopped onion and omitted the corn.  But otherwise, I followed the directions to a T.  A definite keeper -- my dh couldn't stop raving about it!
I've been trying to find "the" chili recipe over the past year or so and have tried several from this site.  This is the best one (including both chicken and beef recipes) out of the whole bunch!

Good recipe. I used ground beef - thought I had chix, but didn't! - and I sauteed garlic and chopped onions w/ the meat. Used both kidney and black beans. Too much cumin for my taste, and I cut back! I did simmer for about 20 minutes. Next time I will try ground turkey instead of chicken, because my husband loved this with ground beef! Topped with mozzarella cheese and crushed tortilla chips. Don't be afriad of green ortega chilis - they are usually VERY mild.

Great, easy meal thats also very healthy!  I took the advice of another reviewer and simmered it for a while to let the flavours fully develop.  I also omitted the green chillies (scared it would be too hot) and used green beans for a bit of colour.  It ended up really yummy, I do think it HAS to be simmered to let the cumin and chilli powder release their flavour.  Great recipe!

This is exactly like a taco soup that I make, only with chicken. Done in 30 minutes - it's a nice, quick one-pot meal that you can spice up as much as you want. I used plain old taco seasoning, an extra can of beans and a pinch of dried chile peppers. Great with grated cheese and a dollop of sour cream over the top. We ate it with french bread but cornbread would have been better.

This was really good. I added one sliced carrot and one rib of celery after the spices were stirred into the chicken. I added about a teaspoon of cayenne toward the end and simmered about 10 minutes to ensure the chicken was fully cooked. Even with extra simmering, it was fast and easy, and we were absolutely satisfied with this dinner.

This recipe was bland and unexciting. I think chili gets most of its flavor from simmering and not being quick - this supports that opinion. My boyfriend liked it - so perhaps it's just not for everyone.

This Chili recipe is great and very healthy.  It is a great change on the old fashioned chili with hamburger.  The longest part of the whole process was cutting the chicken. I doubled the recipe but did not add as much cumin, I also used the salted canned vegetables and it was very good.  The recipe was pleasently spicy.

This was an EXCELLENT chili---the first chicken chili I ever made---and the whole family loved it, even my 5 year-old!  I didn't add the green chillies (only because I didn't have them on hand), but I did add some shredded Pepper Jack cheese on top, and it was marvelous!

I'll definitely make this again.

Delicious...the only deviation from the recipe was that I used white beans instead of red or black.   So healthy that I could have eaten the whole pot myself! Will definitely make again...thanks for this recipe Jean!

I followed this recipe exactly except that I cut the cumin back a bit, since I'm not a fan of strong cumin flavour.  

I thought that this chili was just "okay."  Nothing terrible, but nothing spectacular, either.  I was a little bit surprised that it has a 5-star rating.  In my opinion, regular chili (with ground meat and more simmering time) isn't that much harder to make, and the additional simmering time really makes for a better blend of flavours.

If I were to modify this recipe to make it again for my family, I'd use ground chicken, add a few chopped vegetables at the beginning, and leave it to simmer at the end.  

The green chiles were a nice touch, though.  I never think to use them in chili, but they were good!

This was really good, and super easy!  Since  I don't like really spicy things, I might make this with a 1/2 can of chilis next time.

It was a cool and rainy New England day and chili seemed like just the ticket.   I thought of making chili late in the day, so set out to find a quick chili and I found this recipe.  Thinking that the recipe might call for too much chili powder and cumin for such a short simmer time, I cut back.  Also, I had no canned chilis, so I used a fresh jalapeno.  After taste testing, I simmered the chili for an hour, and the flavor did improve.  It was even better today.  If I make this again, I will throw it all together in the crockpot in the morning and cook on low for 8 to 10 hours.

I gave it four stars for the idea and potential but prepared as written, it's lacking. I sauteed an onion and then shredded chicken breast from a rotisserie chicken and put it in the pan, then put in chili powder and stirred. Then the tomatoes, beans and corn were added in. I agree with others that it tastes so much better with simmering time. In the end, it was good and we could have a tasty meal during the week.

Easy. Tasty. Fast. Gets a full rating from me! I have tried this with: ground turkey, extra lean beef, and chicken. All work well. I like extra spice so I dump in some hot sauce and chili peppers.

Great base recipe! Made alterations due to lack of ingredients. Used 1 large can of pureed tomatoes, a package of cherry tomatoes and a whole can of corn. Everything else was the same except that we doubled the chili powder and cumin. Simmered for around 45 mins. We mushed up some cornbread into each serving, and topped with a little bit of cheddar cheese and sour cream. Was soooooo good. We will make this again and again.

I took 2 hours making this chili to make sure everything simmered and the flavors blended well. I still found it bland. I will try it again, but will most likely use beef to see if that helps, and I'll also add much much more spices and seasonings. I rated it 3 stars even though I didn't like it at all, because my husband ate the entire pot in 2 days and couldn't stop talking about how much he loved it.

Just finished this for dinner and as a busy mom of three this is simple, delicious and good for us!  This will become a regular fall and winter meal in our house. Omitted the corn and used green pepper from the garden.

I've made this too many times to count and is a favorite recipe in our house. It's so easy and quick to put together. I like to simmer it for an hour or so and add a bit of water or chicken broth, but otherwise follow the directions. I apologized to my husband for making it once again and he said it was one of his favorite dinners. Thanks for sharing!!

This was pretty good, too spicy tho. I cut the chili powder and cumin in half but it was still too spicy for me and the kids. I added a few TB of brown sugar for a bit of sweetness.

This is a delicious recipe!  I followed some reviewers' advice and added more corn, and sauteed the chicken with minced garlic and diced onion.  I also added some red pepper, reduced the cumin, didn't add the green chiles, and made my own diced tomato by chopping some organic tomatoes in the food processor.  To make up for the  lack of tomato juice, I added a bit of chicken broth.  Wow was this easy and delicious!  I let it simmer all afternoon and we had a delicious meal.  My boyfriend is a major soup/chili fan and said this was the best chili he'd ever had.  I love that it's super healthy - this is going in the normal rotation!  Thanks!

This was the second time I made this and the second time was better.  I did make changes from the last time.  I cut back to 1 tsp of cumin, I substituted one 10 oz can of diced tomatoes and green chilies for 1 can of the diced tomatoes and the can of green chilies so that caused a reduction in liquid but I only added a little bit of water since I prefer thicker soups, and added a few shakes of garlic powder.  We didn't need to add any additional salt to taste because I didn't use any no-salt-added canned goods.  I also did not use any cayenne pepper.  I shredded 30% fat free cheddar cheese to sprinkle on top and we enjoyed the chili with tortilla chips.  I gave it 5 stars because my husband and I felt this recipe is a winner and one I will make over and over again.  I also loved that it was so quick and easy to make after working all day and then taking a walk for 50 minutes.  I will probably tweak it now and then depending on what I have on hand in the pantry and how much time I have.  Delicious!

This was Amazing!  I made this with Enchilada's http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Angelas-Awesome-Enchiladas/Detail.aspx (Great Enchilada's!!!)  to take to a couple with my church who had just had a baby.  They loved it!   I made double the servings and my family had the same meal for dinner.  It was great!  I, as well as, my friends will circulate this recipe.   I followed the recipe with the exception of the green chilies.  Because I accidentally only got one can at the store instead of two.  I preferred to use them in the enchilada's.  I boiled the chicken for both the chili and enchilada's together and shreded all of it.  Instead of cutting the meat into cubes.   Also with the choice of red or black beans I used black.  It came out great!  Makes good leftovers.

Very good, I  used fresh chopped tomatoes instead of the canned tomatoes and added hot pepper flakes, and let it simmer longer for the flavours to develop.

I liked this...quick and healthy.  I did however add a jalapeno for a little kick and I love cumin so I went a little heavier with that.  Can throw this together anytime.

This is the best chili!  I love that it is a healthy alternative and does not sacrifice the taste.  This recipe beats any beef chili recipe by far.

For the time spent on this recipe, it's pretty good.  I changed out the plain diced tomatoes for Hunt's fire-roasted garlic, added some salt, and in addition to the one can each dark red kidney beans I added a can of rinsed black beans.  I mashed some of the black beans with a fork before adding so as to thicken the chili.  I also just used pre-cooked chicken I had on hand and that worked fine.  Easy, tasty, healthy recipe.  Will make again.  Thanks!

Very easy, very good.  I substituted some diced tomatoes for chicken broth, and added a teaspoon of molasses in the end because I thought it was a bit too sharp.  Also simmered for about an hour.

I did not like this recipe.  I used black beans and maybe that affected it.  It just lacked flavor.  Thanks for sharing but I will not be making it again.

I browned the chicken and then cooked everything in the crockpot on low all day.  It was wonderful!  I don't even really like beans, but I liked them in this recipe.  I will make this often.

This was so delicious!  I'm not sure who could say it has no flavor because its very flavorful!!  I did tweak it a bit.  I added 1/2 of a chopped onion, 1 chopped green bell pepper, and a couple tablespoons of minced garlic to the chicken as it was cooking.  I only bought 1 can of diced tomatoes so in place of the liquid needed from another can of diced tomatoes I added some V8 juice.  I reduced the Cumin to 1 tablespoon and used about 1 teaspoon of Ceyenne Pepper.  Topped off each bowl with a dollop of sour cream and some cheddar cheese.  My husband loved it!!

I'm rating four stars because that much cumin would overpower even with the specified amount of veggies. I like cumin but it can dominant a dish quickly. I used half of a can of beans (drained and rinsed) and half of a can of corn (drained.) I added back in water until desired consistency. I used 1 tb. or so of chili powder and 1 teas. cumin. This made a great chicken chili. I really liked the green chilies in this. Love having fast-to-fix meal ideas when needed. Oh and I sautéed a quarter of a chopped onion with the chicken.

I was blown away with the taste of such an "easy" chili. I bought organic canned ingredients and followed the directions as indicated. Perfect servings for just the two of us, but if there were more people, I'd probably increase the recipe. Will definitely keep on hand for those weeknights without much time or energy for meal prep.

After reading other reviews...I cut back on the cumin. Used the whole can of chilies (I'm not a fan of spicy food and I loved this! Not too spicy at all and adds great flavor). I absolutely let this simmer for at least an hour (I prefer even longer...if I have time I would throw it in the crockpot on low all day). The flavor of this is surprisingly really good and it is definitely easy to make! I used ground chicken and threw in some garlic while cooking it. I do have a great chili recipe that I use when I cook with ground beef but I find this tastes just as good and a lot less time to prepare!

Fantastic!  so hearty and pretty healthy!  Also, it is not spicy, it just has a slight heat to it.  So if you are worried about adding the green chilies, don't, it will turn out great!

Very quick, tasty, and easy!!!!  I baked my checken and then shredded it.  I love shredded chicken in soups!  Sauteed the cooked shredded stuff in the oil and spices and then added the rest!  I actually only did one can of tomatos because I didn't have two and I really like it as is!!  Also, didn't have corn, but will try it next time with it!

This smelled so good while it was cooking that I was quite disapointed when I sat down to eat it.  I used salted varieties of the tomatoes and beans and therefore omitted the salt.  It still needed quite a bit of salt and the flavor was just okay--nothing special.   The cumin was overpowering and I like cumin.  Hubby liked it, but he wasn't raving about it.  I might try it once more and cook the chicken with onions as other cooks have done, otherwise I'll just stick to my standard chili recipe with a chili mix from this site.

My 15-minute chili came out great! I made a whole lot of substitutions, though, since I don't have a lot of the stuff in my kitchen. Instead of canned beans and tomatoes, I used frozen green peas and fresh tomatoes. I also substituted the chicken for beef patties (which I mashed up with a spatula in the pan). I dropped out the green chili and corn (didn't have). It wasn't exactly 15 minutes for me since I'm a newbie in the kitchen and I had to prepare all the ingredients by hand, but the chili still came out great. Thanks for the recipe! :)

Great tasting Chili!  I used ground turkey and added chopped onion and celery.  I also added an extra can of kidney beans and mushrooms.  I pureed most of the tomatoes as my kids are not that fond of canned tomatoes.  Threw everything into the slow cooker and went about my day.  Will definately try this again.

I loved this!  I added some additional seasonings and some heavy cream at the end for a creamier chili.  It was MUCH better the second day.  I'll definitely make this again sometime this coming winter.  I'd probably add a can of rotel next time as well for a bit more spice.

I made this for my wife last night.  Very easy to prepare and better than I thought with such limited effort.

A definite keeper!

Quick, easy and tastes good.  Added chopped fresh cilantro.  Was a bit thin for our preference but will definitely make again.

I read the recipe and reviews thouroughly before attempting this chili and I am glad I did. As stated it seemed bland, and some reviewers validated my assumption. I added one chopped onion to the chicken while sauteeing. I added garlic powder and some cayenne pepper along with the spices. I used a can of mexican style chili beans along with a can of black beans. I used a whole 14.5 ounce can of corn, as well as a whole 7 ounce can of diced green chilis. I brought the whole concoction to a boil, then reduced the heat and covered it, letting it simmer for about an hour. These changes made for a top-notch chili that was delicious served with corn bread. Not to mention, still healthy (although the mexican style chili beans added some sugar and salt).

Great flavor!  I didn't have any green chiles or corn, but didn't miss them.

I really enjoyed this. All I did differently was saute a chopped onion and green pepper in with the chicken. My husband said it was "tasteless" but I think he's crazy!

Super easy and will make this again.  I used leftover chicken (grilled extra from previous meal), the can of corn was Mexicorn and for tomatoes I used 1 can tomatoes with jalepenos and equal amount of salsa--so I did not add the can of chilies (which I didn't have).   Yes,  I tweaked it based on what I had--but still great rating on original recipe, blend of ingredients and amount of spices added.

This was great!  It was quick and easy and delicious.  I didn't have any canned tomatoes on hand, but I had fresh ones so I used fresh diced tomato.  I had nearly a pound of chicken, so I increased the chili powder and cumin some.  Used a can of black beans and a can of red beans, and nearly 2 cups of frozen corn.  I don't like things very spicy, so just a little dash of red pepper.   Seems this would be easy for people to spice up or down to their own taste.  I'll definitely be making this again.

I used Chili-flavored diced tomatoes and Great Northern Beans & everyone loved it. Simmer for about 15 minutes to meld flavors.

It was delicious and easy. I added a chopped up onion and a few cloves  of  garlic to the cooked Chicken and let that sauté a few minutes. I also substituted a jar of mild salsa for one of the cans of diced tomatoes. I let it all simmer for about 25 minutes. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks.

This is a great recipe but like some of the other folks had stated it was a bit bland for us so I tweaked. We sautéed the chicken with cumin, onions, and garlic and then added in chili powder. We added in cilantro at the end to add in some more flavor. Excellent receipe!

I start with onions, coarsely chopped. Sauté in oil with the chicken and spices, then everything else.  This is a great recipe for twenty somethings who haven't cooked much but want to make meals at home. Very easy, tasty, and healthy!

I didn't have green chili's so I left them out. Good recipe for a quick meal.
