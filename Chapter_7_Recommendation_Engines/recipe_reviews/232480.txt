The tortillas turn out great. However, the instructions are wrong. Using these ingredients, a dough is never formed and there is no way you can form it into balls. It is very runny. The best thing to do is just pour the liquid into your skillet and let cook 1-2 minutes (or until firm enough to flip) and then flip and cook for another minute or two. It actually tastes really good!

Nope.. I started with one egg.. was too much for even half a cup of almond flour.. am up to 1 1/4 cup  and while it makes a big ball, it is still far too sticky to  roll out.... So I started over.. and used the amounts in the recipe.. POURED it in the skillet, swirl it around to make it thin, then I cooked it .it was fine and tasted quite good. Do not try and roll this out.. no way no how.  4 stars for taste - zero stars for instructions

A huge disappointment! Form mixture into 6 balls???! How?! This was very soupy. I even increased the almond flour to 1 cup and I STILL had nothing but liquid (like pancake batter). So, I decided to cook them up just like I would cook pancakes and ended up with a very eggy pancake type of thing that was not worth the time or expensive ingredients. I'm definitely NOT making this again.

Mine turn out more like pancakes but that's OK, the consistency and flavor are what I want.  I did use only 3 eggs and added almond milk to get the right texture, also used coconut oil instead of butter.  Since we use them with Matbucha, I added spices to the mix, in our case, hot smoked paprika and chipotle chili.  They are really good, I make them about once a month.

Really disappointed with this recipe. I'd planned on making tacos with these tortillas and had chicken in the oven and other fixins already made. The batter was runny and there's no way you could roll balls of dough with that consistency. I ended up giving up and making pancakes out of the batter instead.

I followed another reviewer's instructions and they came out great.  Even my husband liked them who is a new convert to grain free eating.  I just whipped up ingredients with my emersion blender b/c my almond meal was lumpy and I did cut the honey to 1 tsp.  Batter was very thin liquid and I just poured a thin layer onto warmed buttered skillet and flipped once brown.   First two were perfect, the third I poured too thin and tore apart when I flipped.  The rest were great.   So easy will make again.

This tastes like egg "omelettes". I followed the recipe but plan on making changes the next time we make it. I did make the mix and it was way too soupy so I poured it into the hot pan and just swirled it around until it was thin and flipped it once it starting lifting.

I reduced the eggs to 4 and added two tablespoons of coconut flour, a teaspoon of garlic salt, and a half teaspoon of garlic powder. I did not use honey as I am not eating sugar. After the batter sits a bit it does thicken up but not enough to roll out. I poured it into a pan sprayed with Pam and spread it with a spoon to the size of a tortilla.  The end result was still thicker than a flour tortilla but the taste was good and the texture was similar to a thick tortilla. When you're limiting carbs, this works well! This made 3 nice size tortillas.

I agree with other people who made this - the recipe is way too runny.  I tried adding more flour but stopped when it was getting ridiculous!!  

So instead I left if reasonably runny and cooked them up like pancakes.  That worked quite well and they were yummy.  

I would make it again but I think from reading other reviews it is impossible to make the mixture thick enough to roll out.  So I would make them up again like pancakes.

So I didn't try the dough prior to baking, and I cut it in half ( I didn't have enough sugar). I also forgot to add the almonds. I used sweetened coconut flakes and thought they tasted really good! Fluffy and sweet!! I would make these again!!

Not good for tortillas at all. Mixture is soupy, even after adding more almond flour. These make, however, delicious paleo pancakes!

The mixture was so soupy. I added more almond flour and it didn't help. I ended up pouring it like a pancake. Tasted really good but there is no way I could make this into balls like the recipe said.

This was way too soupy to make a tortilla.  I think it would make an excellent crepe, however.

I wish I had read the reviews first. I added another 1/2 cup of almond flour and 2 more tsp of honey. We basically had pancakes with our taco meat lol

Running batter for sure. As much as eggs cost, the person of added this recipe should revise it.  Too many eggs I believe but it was very good.

This was ok.  It served it's purpose as a vessel for paleo fajitas but it's really just a super thin omelette.  I don't think it needed the honey or any sugar.  My husband liked it just as much as lettuce wraps but no more.  Will continue using until I find a better recipe.  PS. It worked for us better than a basic crepe recipe - more pliable and tastier.  And yes, I made it like everyone else - as a batter not a dough.

I gave it a 4 because of the instructions, otherwise would’ve been a 5.  As well as other reviewers had stated,  it’s impossible for you to make them into a ball due  to the very healthy ingredients used in this recipe, so basically just pour it directly with a measuring cup onto the skillet and  you’ll have some very tasty tortillas!

True, it was very runny. I added extra flour to no avail. However, I found after deciding to give it a go on the stove, that it works great as a pancake recipie. I suppose I've found my go to for making pancakes from scratch.

I think the ingredients are incorrect. I've doubled the amount of almond flour that is called for. I'm cooking them now. So far they look like pancakes. They look like they will break apart :-(

Instructions are way off. If you follow them, you'll have a big liquid mess. 

When I revamped it with a lot fewer eggs and more almond flour they tasted okay. It's still hard to get them thin, though.

Tried this but thought the list of ingredients should have said 1-2 cups of almond flour?   Too many eggs for my personal taste, so deducted one egg.   Tried that and it actually does make balls of dough.   made ok tortillas.  tillyflop
