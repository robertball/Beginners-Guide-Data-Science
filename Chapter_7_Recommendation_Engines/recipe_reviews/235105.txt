I loved the idea of the fruit in this recipe, and the strawberries I picked up were delicious!  I did feel like the dressing was not quite what I was hoping for.  The amount of mustard scared me off, so rather than use spicy mustard I opted for country style Dijon---and that could have been my undoing.  It was too mustardy for me (and I almost always add mustard to a dressing), and I had to add another teaspoon of sugar to try to offset it.  I think I could save the rest of the dressing by doubling the other ingredients but with no mustard.  Thanks for a nice refreshing idea for a salad!
