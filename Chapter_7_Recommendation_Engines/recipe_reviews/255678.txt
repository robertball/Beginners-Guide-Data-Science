This is a pretty tasty recipe.  I cannot imagine going to the trouble of making a beautiful omelet and then wrapping it in a tortilla as the recipe states.  Perhaps this would have been a 5 star recipe if I had, but I suspect that amount of trouble would have lowered it to 3 instead.  I scrambled the ingredients instead of omelet-ing them but otherwise I did follow the instructions.

This breakfast quesadillas was great, made better by using leftover steak instead of Canadian bacon.

We love spicy food and yet I didn't have any jalapenos on hand, but even without the jalapenos it was delicious!  Will definitely make it with jalapenos in the future, but if you are like me and don't have them, don't hesitate to make it anyway.  We topped with sour cream and Frank's Hot Sauce , both of which I would recommend.
