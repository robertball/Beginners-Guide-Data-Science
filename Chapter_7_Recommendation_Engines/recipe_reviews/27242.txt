Very cute cake that was fun and easy to make WITH my 3 year old.  I let her help put the eyes and nose on and sprinkle chocolate eggs on the "grass".  Tasted yummy and put a smile on everyone's face who saw it.

I love cut-up cakes. It's adds fun to a party. Easy to make. Kids love to help decorate. Kids of all ages will like this cake. Try different toppings and colored icings. I used Betty Crocker's Cream Cheese (white) and Strawberry Cream Cheese (pink). If you like bunnys, decorate in different holiday colors. Somebunny will love your bunny rabbit. Have fun!!!!

The creative aspect of this recipe is great and VERY easy to do.  The cake mix itself is OK, but I HIGHLY recommend making your own cream cheese frosting rather than using the fluffly white frosting.  Using a cream cheese frosting is much better for a carrot cake, otherwise it is just too sweet combined with the coconut flakes.  This was a visual hit on Easter Sunday, but not much got eaten.

I am actually rating the diagram of this cake.  It was so easy!!  I used yellow cake and vanilla  frosting. Everyone was very impressed.  My mom used to make this cake when I was a kid.  Thanks for posting Betty Crocker.

We made 3 bunnies, they were so fun and easy to do!!!  We made it out of party rainbow chip instead of carrot cake and used regular vanilla frosting instead of whipped to make them taste better!
