I made this pretty much as published, only substitutions I made were replaced the 4 med. potatoes with one large sweet potato and a can of garbanzo beans (since I had no regular potatoes on hand) and used frozen peas instead of canned for the same reason.  Flavor was excellent, only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that it's way too oily.  I will be making this more, but with half the oil or less next time.  Goes well with the Syrian Bread recipe from this site.

This recipe is excellent. I would recommend you to follow the recipe exactly. DO NOT omit the ginger as it is what gives this recipe the zing. The whole family loved it. Hubby says this is the best dish I've ever made.

This is a really yummy recipe! I cooked it in a crock pot, which made the chicken REALLY tender.  The recipe was a bit salty, so I added a little more tomato sauce, and substituted the baby peas with carrots. I will definitely make it again. Reminds me of home!

I made this with some alterations and my kids loved it.  Instead of tomato sauce, I used fresh ripe tomatoes with tomato paste and herb seasonings.  I also didn't use any ginger, soy sauce or oyster sauce and used chicken stock instead. Boneless skinless chicken thighs work well with this recipe and is convenient for kids.  Also sauteed garlic with onion instead of using garlic salt.

So easy and tastes better than my mother's recipe. I think the oyster sauce did the trick!  I did make a few changes using what I had on hand. I used E.V. Olive Oil. Instead of garlic salt, I used 2 tsps of chopped garlic and added that in with the onion and ginger. Instead of red bell pepper, all I had was a 12 oz jar of roasted red pepper, so I added that 5 minutes before serving and let it simmer. Since I have 2 toddlers, I substituted the can of peas with 1 cup frozen peas and carrots. My husband and my picky toddler loved it! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This recipe was mediocre...it didn't know whether to be Asian or Texan.  My son wasn't thrill about it and I didn't really like the over powering flavor of ginger; although, I do enjoy ginger.  It was better the next day for soft tacos with olives and cheese.  If I use this recipe again, I will cut down on the ginger or omit it.

My husband's favorite dish!  It's too salty and greasy for me as written, but with a few minor alterations it turned out great.  Instead of frying up chicken, I saute some cubed boneless,skinless chicken breasts in a skillet.  Instead of 1 (10 oz.) can of tomato sauce, I use one of those larger 29oz cans.  That's it.  After those few changes, it's perfect for me and my hubby still loves it!

Not quite the flavor I have had when friends cooks this dish, but still very good and close to the taste.  Make sure not to cook your sauce down too thick.

I loved the flavour of this recipe.  The only complaint is that there wasn't enough liquid to cover and cook the chicken, but that's easily fixed.

I don't use oyster sauce, ginger, or garlic at all in this.  Also, I put sliced carrots and chick peas instead of baby peas.  I add sliced hotdogs in it as well (how ethnic, Â¿no?)  And sliced green peppers and a small jar of diced pimentos go well together.  Someone told me to add milk in it one time, and I was like "ewww gross, no thanks".

Lots of flavor! A great recipe that strays from the traditional. I added worstershire sauce and gave it a little more of a kick. I'd definately reccomed and make again.

I make pork Afritada and my Filipino hubby and other family members love it.  Having an over abundance of chicken breasts, I decided to try this recipe and I have to tell you, I hit the jackpot on compliments.  I cut the breasts into bite sized pieces and fried them til just done.  The only reason I added 2 sweet potatoes was because I only had 3 small redskin potatoes.  Also did not add oyster sauce and about half the amount of soy sauce.  Didn't eliminate anything else and the ginger is absolutely key.  The dish is easy, a big plus, ingredients readily available and absolutely delicious.  This will be a regular on our table!!

For anyone who may wrongfully think this dish is "Texan" or whatnot, it's actually Filipino, it may come as a shock but we cook more things than just Lumpia and Adobo. 
Anyhow, this is a great recipe, I didn't mess with it or change it, because it doesn't need to be tweaked. Great alternative to my family recipe.

Did not have tomato sauce so I put fresh tomatoes - next time, use canned because it made the sauce too intense with fresh tomatoes.  Jacques loved the flavors - rest is all fine.
Also, would probably be better next time on a bed of rice vs with little potatoes - to try.

Delicious! and easy to make but just cut back on all that oil and maybe add a little stock.  Definitely try this again and probably will just add another little twist here and there!  :)

Fully 5 stars.. Made it tonight.. substituted a can of stewed italian tomatoes puree'd (didn't have tomato sauce onhand... what?!)  Used reconstituted dried ginger cuz that's all they had at the store, and used green instead of red bell pepper.  So authentically asian tasting that anyone who gives this less than 4 stars is obviously a jealous asian troll.. :)
