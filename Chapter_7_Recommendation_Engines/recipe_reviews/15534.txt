In spite of looking "weird", I tried it.  My large, picky family devoured it! Only one serving remained as leftover, so I took it to work for lunch.  My coworkers begged for the recipe and their families loved it, too.  Just tastes yummy.

Just an average dish, we probably would have preferred it without the pasta or sauerkraut.

My sister-in-law "Mary Kurer" sent me this recipe. I've made it for several functions. I was asked to make it for Super Bowl. Big hit! Thanks Mary!

I'm not a big cooker--I was entertaining a group of ladies with a St. patrick's Day theme and was looking for something quick, easy and also delicious to serve and make a good impression.  This was exactly what I needed--souldn't of been easier and more delicious!!!!!!!  Also, make a dish to take to work--they loved it too--everyone wanted the recipe--this will become a regular on my dinner menu.

WOW! I haven't made a casserole in I cannot tell you how long and this is only the 2nd time I've bought a cream of soup in 10 years at least BUT it was pretty tasty. My cheese came in an 8oz package so I used the extra 2 oz. to sprinkle over the top and this added a nice golden crispy layer on top. This was the first time I had ever bought canned corn beef as well but I wasn't disappointed in it in this dish. I think next time I make it I will add rye bread crumbs drizzled with Thousand Island to the top in the last few minutes of baking for an added touch.

This was a good, quick recipe.  I substituted cream of celery soup for the cream of mushroom soup (not a mushroom eating family).  Also, could not find canned corn beef at 3 grocery stores, so I bought corn beef from the deli.  The meat was very flavorful.  I drizzled with Thousand Island dressing before serving.  This make a lot and will be good for a large family or a carry-in.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I didn't have beef on hand so I diced up some Kielbasa instead.  I also used Swiss cheese instead of mozz & cream of onion because my husband doesn't like mushroom.

This upset my stomach a little but my boyfriend LOVED it.  His only comment was "could use more sourkraut".

I found this recipe to be about average.  It makes a lot, so that's good if you have a big family, and it is easy.  I also liked the baked corned beef.  So it didn't taste bad, but it wasn't spectacular.  I think it might have been a little better if I used more soup, maybe a can and a half or even two.  If it freezes well (I like to cook a lot in advance and then freeze portions for lunches), I might try making it again.

I added bread crumbs and 1/2 cup of shredded cheese to the top before baking. It's one of those meals that tastes even better the second day! I will definitely be making this meal again.

Easy and delicious. It freezes well, too (always a plus for those of us with small families).  I serve it with whatever green vegetable I have on hand and buttered rye toast. Yum!

I started making this and apparently someone used my corned beef :-( I substituted a pound of ground beef and I think I liked it better! I also used an extra can of soup to make it juicer because the first time it was kind of dry.

This receipe was good.  Not great, but good.  Made way too much for my small family. It is a good standby recipe for a change of pace. Served with stemed green beans.

Recipe didn't taste all that good for the effort
