Great flavor.  Very thin sauce if made by the recipe (probably good for a salad dressing).  I made as directed then put in a saucepan and thickened with cornstarch to make a dipping sauce.  It was really good and will make again.

We thought this was delicious! It is a bit of a sweeter sauce, so be sure to keep that in mind. I used this for a dipping sauce for steamed buns, and that was a nice pairing. I will def be using this recipe again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Based on other reviews I made this without the water, thinking I would add as much as needed. I felt like it was perfect without! I added mine to just barely cooked through chicken & veggies, simmered 5 minutes & served over noodles with toasted sesame seeds sprinkled on top. We loved it!

Excellent.  Used it as a dip for spring rolls.  Left out the water resulting in a thick full bodied flavor.  A real hit.  Definitely a keeper and one to share with others.

Perfect for egg rolls, quick and easy. Had only vegetable oil on hand, added a hint of peanut butter with it. Little grayed Ginger and garlic, delicious!

Subbed Splenda for sugar and doubled the batch.  Added 1 1/2 tsp cornstarch & brought mixture to a boil to thicken.  Very tasty and can be used as a dipping sauce (potstickers, raw vegetables), sauce for steamed veggies, or a salad dressing.  Reasonably healthy option to keep handy on busy weeknights...really liked this one!
