As already mentioned before in the reviews, the measurements on this recipe are a little off. If baked as per recipe, the quiche will be too oily and will not fit into one deep pie dish.  Instead, I suggest making 2 quiches!  Keep the same amount of spinach/mushroom/cheese mixture and separate it into 2 portions.  Use the 4 eggs and 1 cup of milk (can decrease to 3/4 if you like) and half of the spinach/mushroom/cheese mixture for one quiche, and the same for the other quiche.  Only use 1 tbsp of butter instead of the 1/2 cup recommended as it is WAY too much butter if you stick to the recipe.
The quiches turned out delicious and had a beautiful colour to them! Since this was my first quiche, I was afraid it would be too watery, but it came out firm.  Tastes great!

As many reviewers noted, this is a very forgiving recipe. I used some olive oil while cooking down fresh spinach and therefore no butter, 1/2 cup milk, and less chedder cheese.  It turned out great!!!!!  I recommend putting empty pie crust in oven for 5-7 min prior to filling to give it a crispy bottom crust  - no more soggy bottom!!

This was delicious.  I used fresh mushrooms and skipped the crust.  Divided batter into muffin tins, baked then froze them.  They reheated great!  My family loved them.

Why oh why can't there be a six star rating?  Let me preface this by saying that I have never been a big fan of quiche.  I told my husband I'd make one, so I found this recipe.  This is not only the BEST quiche I have ever had; I'd venture to say it is one of the most delicious foods I've ever eaten.  Next time, I will try to make it with less butter as others have suggested.  I used plain feta and added a dash of oregano, basil, rosemary and seasoned pepper.  I made the Pastry for a Single Crust Pie from this site, and it was great for this dish.  (Probably not so great for a sweet pie).  Anyway, thank you for the fantastic recipe Bailey, you are single-handedly responsible for finding a way to get my six year old to not only EAT spinach, but to eat it with gusto!  I am in your debt.  :)

Edited to add:  If you ever plan on making this "healthier" by cutting back on the butter, I highly recommend you do it the FIRST time, so you won't be disappointed in the difference.  It's still a good quiche with 1.5 Tbsp of butter, but it's a GREAT quiche with the whole stick.  LOL

I made a few changes only because I was looking for a particular recipe that I couldn't find...I used swiss cheese instead of cheddar...left out the mushrooms (because I don't like them) used 1 heaping Tablespoon of margarine (instead of the 1/2 cup butter) eggbeaters for the eggs and skim milk and this was Fantastic.  I served it along with other things at a brunch and this dish was gone in 10 minutes..When I make it again (and I will) I will make 2 or 3 of them! I made this the day before, refrigerated it overnight and then warmed it in the oven the morning of the brunch (covered in foil to prevent overbrowning) It reheated perfectly.

This was great!  I made a few variations to lower the fat content.

I used margarine instead of butter and halved it, per everyone's suggestions.  I used skim milk, and I used egg whites instead of eggs.  I also reduced the cheddar a bit. And it was still great!  I can only imagine how wonderful it would be if I used all the real ingredients instead of the low-fat stuff.

Also, I used fresh mushrooms and sauted them with the onions and garlic.  Veeeery yummy.  I made mine without a pie shell.  Other fun things to try next time include bacon bits, a handful of almonds or pecans, raisins, or topping it with bread crumbs, croutons or fried onions!  There are just too many fun things to do with this recipe, so I'll definately be making it again.  And again.  And again.  And... ;)

Thank you so much!  Okay, I'll shut up now.  :D

The flavor blends in this spinch-feta-garlic quiche were very tasty. Follwing the advice of others I decreased the butter from 1/2 c to 6T.....it was still too greasy. Next time I will reduce it to 3T or maybe use a little olive oil. I will also omit the salt altogether. Every family member mentioned how salty it was. Feta and cheddar make it salty enough. I used fresh baby spinach steamed instead of frozen. I think with these changes the flavor blends will have a chance to blossom.

Awesome quiche. 
The only suggestion I have would be to cook the pie crust for maybe 5 minutes before adding the ingredients to brown it a little. 
I will make this recipe again and again!

WOW.  This was so excellent.  I made it for my Bridesmaid's Luncheon and everyone loved it.  I should, however, have read the reviews first and not used as much butter-- maybe only 1/2 or 2/3 as much.  I would call this less of a quiche and more like the Greek dish Spanikopita (spinach pie).  I left the mushrooms out and just used the spinach and the cheese.  The extra butter made the pie crust nice and flaky (in some spots-- in others is was just soggy and greasy) like the phillo dough used in Spanikopita.  I used Sundried Tomato and Basil Feta (all I could find) and it was delicious.  The cheddar cheese and egg on top were a very pleasant contrast to the spinach and feta mixture on the bottom.  A past reviewer said her egg mixture overflowed in the oven, even though she used a deep dish pie crust.  Maybe that was because you used eggs that were too large?  I don't think I'd use anything bigger than a large egg for this recipe.  Also, I think a cup of milk is too much to add to the eggs.  I only used between 1/2 and 3/4 of a cup.  This turned out way better than I expected.  It's also one of those great dishes you can get creative with depending on your mood.  Just change the ingredients to whatever you have on hand or feel like using!  A++

Wonderful recipe. I made it for my vegetarian brother-in-law and sister who hates mushrooms. The previous comments gave me the "courage" to be creative! Instead of the most dreaded mushrooms, I used just a little chopped artichokes and and finely chopped pine nuts. Outstanding with the feta cheese/spinach.  This one is a winner!

SOOOO good!  The changes I made were to use half of the recommended butter, sauteed fresh mushrooms with the onions, and added some minced sun-dried tomatoes to the spinach.  I used 2 9” regular pie crusts (instead of 1 deep dish) and it was the perfect amount for 2 quiches.  I baked the pie crust for about 5 min before I added the spinach so it wouldn’t get soggy.  I also added a dash of Italian seasoning to the feta because I could only find regular.  It was FANTASTIC!!  *UPDATE*  I minced a few fresh basil leaves into the spinach.  It was a whole new level of delicious!

I just returned from a PTA sponsored breakfast for the teacher's because today is national teacher's day and I was asked to help out and make a quiche.  I usually do not make something to bring somewhere without having made it before but I figured with all the positive reviews of this quiche, I couldn't go wrong.  This is a TEN star recipe.  There were five quiches at the teacher breakfast and this one was gone in 15 minutes.  Teachers were asking me for the recipe! I only used half a stick of butter and half the package of spinach, I just feel that the whole 10 oz package of spinach is too much. Other than those minor changes, I followed the recipe exactly.  The garlic-herb feta gives it a wonderful flavor.  I have also made the crustles spinach quiche on this website and this one is really much, much tastier and delicious.  I can't want to make it again.  Thanks for a superb recipe!!

Also made a couple changes, but an excellent quiche resulted, so that's what counts! Combined this recipe with "Suzanne's Spinach Quiche" for a winner. ...Combine 6 strips crumbled bacon, 9oz. fresh spinach (wilted), browned onions & garlic in a 9"crust; top with 1c. cheddar; mix 3 eggs, 1c. yogurt, salt & pepper - pour over spinach; bake 15 min.; top with remaining cheddar; bake 30 min. till done.  YUMMY!

We were excited to try this version of Spinach Quiche, especially after reading the reviews.  We were disappointed.  The flavors were bland, even with the garlic herb feta, and there was just nothing that stood out about this quiche.

This is excellent!  And a must try for anyone who's never made quiche before or is looking for an awesome recipe as is or to work with.  It's very simple and excellent.  Personally, my fiance and I hate onions, so I skipped that.  I cooked the pie crust for approx. 10 minutes by itself.  I put 4 oz. of the cheddar cheese in the quiche and used a smidge less than 1 cup milk (the first time it overflowed).  I cooked only the garlic, spinach and mushrooms in 2 1/2 T. butter (you don't want it too greasy), and set them aside to cool.  Mixed everything else (including cheeses, I did this because the cheese melted as per the instructions the first time I made it making it difficult to mix the ingredents for the oven) then added the cooled cooked mixture and poured into the pie crust.  I cooked for 40 minutes. Then added 2 oz. cheddar cheese to the top plus approx. 6-8 pieces broken apart cooked bacon.  Cook for another 10-15 minutes.  For newbies: don't forget to cover the outside of the crust with tinfoil to prevent burning.  A wonderful recipe that you can easily modify to suit your own taste!

What a fantastic recipe this is!  I took the advise of others and cut the butter back to 1/4 cup.  Also, I could only find plain feta cheese so I added a dash of garlic powder, basil, oregano and thyme.  I used a 9" unbaked deep dish pie crust as directed in the recipe.  However, I removed it from the aluminum pan and placed it in a ceramic deep-dish quiche dish.  This solved the problem some readers had with overflow and it gives the appearance that the crust was "homemade" too.  The quiche turned out picture perfect and was absolutely the best I've ever had.  Thank you for wonderful recipe!

Very good but too greasy if you follow the recipe, as is. I used less than the 1/2 cup suggested and it was still too much. I looked back at some old reviews and saw recommendations for as little as 1 tablespoon butter. Note: Made this again with 1/4 cup butter and it was much better.

This recipe is definitely VERY forgiving.....first time I ever prepared quiche.  I used cream cheese instead of feta, monterey pepper jack instead of cheddar, cream instead of milk, and omitted the mushrooms.  I made substitutions because I already had on hand the mentioned ingredients.  I had more than I needed for a 9 inch pie crust so I put the remaining mixture in a non-stick pan.  So, this recipe lends itself nicely to a non-crust quiche as well.

Wonderful dish! If you want to prepare it ahead of time, you can mix all of the filling ingredients together in a bowl and refrigerate overnight. In the morning pour into your pieshell and bake. Presto! Very easy for an early morning meal and it tastes just as great! I added bacon to my quiche and used 6 eggs instead of 4 as others suggested. This was perfect to fill a 9-inch deep dish ready-made crust. I also found that no extra salt was needed--the feta and cheddar gives it plenty of flavor! Loved it!!!!

This recipe was so easy to make and tasted so good.  I made it last night for my boyfriend and he loved it.  I took the advice of some other reviewers as follows:  1) reduced the butter to 1 heaping tablespoon, 2) reduced the amount of milk to 2/3 cup, and 3) baked the pie shell for 5 minutes prior to adding filling.  I will definately make this recipe again.  The cheddar cheese was very crisp on top and due to personal preference I will probably add it 10-15 minutes before the quiche is finished next time so that it's more stringy.

Delicious! I took the tip of cutting the butter in half and with all that cheese it was a good decision.

I made this with a bag of fresh baby spinach and skipped the mushrooms because no one here likes them. 

Instead of layering everything in the pie plate, I mixed the filling in a bowl, then poured it all into the shell.

This was the best quiche ever! My husband and I both loved it. After reading the other reviews I too made a few changes. I cooked the crust 5-7 minutes before adding the ingredients and so my crust turned out perfect on the bottom. I cut the butter to ¼ cup and…no grease so that worked well. I took the garlic down to 2 cloves and frankly I could have done 3 I think. The spinach I used was fresh so I just cooked it down in a little water and then drained it. Also, the feta only comes in a 4 oz package now so that’s all I used. Lastly I cut the milk to ½ cup and the eggs to 3. It turned out perfectly and it was the first time I ever made quiche. I felt like I needed something with a little texture so I served it with a side salad in a balsamic vinaigrette. Delicious! I can’t wait to experiment more with different ingredients!

This recipe was absolutely FANTASTIC!!  I made a few adjustments.  I used Havarti cheese instead of feta (I'm not a big feta fan), I switched out the milk for heavy whipping cream and I used 1/4 butter.  I also added a little sherry wine and green onions as well as red onions.  My daughter was not a big fan of quiche but she came RUNNING in my room saying "mommy, this is the BEST quiche EVER!" With that being said I highly recommend this quiche to everyone!!!!!!

OMG, so good! Make it gluten free with the Whole Foods gluten free crust. Wow. And I made this with whole Lactose Free milk so everyone could enjoy it. Fabulous. I have made this dozens of times and it's always a hit. Add a fifth egg and an extra bit of mushrooms so the volume is equal to 2 quiches. Otherwise, you end up throwing about 1/2 a pie worth of filling out. Outstanding.

This is a wonderful dish!  My husband was pretty leary of it at first, but he ended up loving it, and eating almost the entire quiche by himself.  I made a few minor adjustments--I reduced the butter to 1/4 cup because 1/2 cup seemed like way too much.  I also reduced the cheese by about half, and it was plenty.  Also, put the cheese on right at the end; if you put it on as directed you will end up with a brown, crusty mess.

Really delicious quiche.  I baked the crust for 6 min before adding the egg mixture.  Saute the onion and fresh mushroom in 1 tbsp of butter.  add garlic right at the end so it doesn't burn.  remove from heat and stir in spinach, plain feta, 1 tsp of dill and 6 oz cheddar cheese.  in a medium bowl, whisk eggs and milk.  add salt and pepper.  Mix spinach mixture and egg mixture and pour into crust.  Bake for 50 minutes.  let stand 10 min.

I made this for my mum's birthday brunch and it was the most tasty and good-looking quiche I have ever made. Everyone commented on how good it was. I was very happy with the end result. I did use olive oil spray instead of the butter and 1% milk to cut down on the fat content, and it was still delicious!

This is good...BUT... 1) The amount of ingredients did not fit into one deep dish crust - this recipe makes 2 quiches, not one.  At least not with the "deep dish" crust I bought.  I did not realize it until I was pouring in the egg/milk mixture that it would not fit.  I had to grab another pie pan, move half of the spinach mixture to the second pan, and then split the egg/milk mixture between the two...2) Half a cup of butter is one stick!  WAY too much.  Thankfully I realized that immediately.  I used 2 tablespoons and even that was too much.  With all the cheese in this recipe, no wonder it still came out greasy.  I will definately do this again, but I will probably only use 1 tbsp of butter, no additional salt, and a little less cheese.  BTW, my changes are as follows: fresh spinach and mushrooms, evaporated milk, and a mexican blend of cheeses.

This was good, but not the best quiche I've ever had.  It had a very unique and good flavor with the feta cheese.  I really enjoyed that.  The only thing I would change is the fact that all of the spinach and mushrooms are on the bottom causing the cheddar cheese to be a bit tough on top.  I prefer my cheese mixed throughout to give it a "melty" taste.  Maybe next time I'll try just mixing everything together...

My husband had invited a colleague to dinner recently. I know the rule about trying new recipes on guests but this looked so good, I couldn't resist. Well, this came out so well that both the men had seconds.

I will offer a word of caution to anybody like me (in rural Australia) that cannot get a large pie crust, you will only be able to fit half the filling in a small crust. I used the leftovers next day by filling muffin tins and making mini-quiches. These came out really well, too.

I will be making this again. It's very nice in the summer with a salad. Highly recommended.

Love this recipe.However, I use fresh mushrooms & spinach.  I saute them with the onions & garlic then drain off the excess liquid.  I also use cream instead of milk & sometimes play around with different cheeses, but the basic recipe is very good.

Great, great, great quiche!  Hubby and I loved it.  I added twice the amount of mushrooms called for, and used half the amount of butter called for.  I split the cheese/onion/spinach/mushroom mixture between two deep dish pie shells.  I mixed six large eggs with seasoned salt and 3/4 cup of milk, then split between the two pie shells again.  This was a most excellent dish!

I tried to make a healthier version since the original one has WAY too much fat!  I used reduced-fat cheese (chedder, monterey jack mix), fresh mushrooms, halved the butter, 16 oz spinach, an extra egg white, and no pastry shell.  delicious!

Wonderful recipe.  I made the filling without changing a thing.  It did make a lot, so I split it between two pie shells and reduced the cooking time by 10 mins.  Definitely prebake the shell!  I baked one but not the other, and the non-prebaked one tended to stick, and the pieces didn't come out as cleanly, tore the crust.

That said, I will definitely be making this one again!!!

First off, this is a first rate quiche.  Really delicious.  However, I made a couple of changes.  You absolutely do not need that much butter.  I used 2 tablespoons and it was perfect.  I also omitted the mushrooms added a half package of bacon, and used plain feta.  Really rich, but really good.  It was even better the next day cold for breakfast.  A++

This recipe is enough filling to make two deep dish quiches.  I'd change the butter to 1/2 stick, and if you only want to make one quiche, cut everything in half (1/4 stick of butter).  I bet if you do this, it'll be very tasty.

I got great results by 1) using just 1T butter; 2) squeezing the water out of the spinach and then adding it to the sauté for a minute to cook off extra moisture; 3) adding 1/4 cup sliced artichoke hearts instead of mushrooms; 4) using just 4oz feta and 2oz cheddar; and 5) mixing everything together (except the cheddar) before pouring it in the pie shell.

This is fabulous, and like the recipe says, very forgiving. Feel free to play around with it to make a whatever-you-want-it-to-be quiche, but here is what I did to make it a little better. First off, 1/2 cup of butter is ridiculous; all you really need is about 1tbs. I used two small bags of organic spinach - washed and chopped - from the farmers market, 4 medium shallots, 3 cloves of garlic, goat cheese, green onions, fresh parsley and thyme, and a strong white welsh cheddar (I didn't have any mushrooms otherwise those would have gone in too). I sauteed the shallots and garlic in the butter than added the spinach. Make sure to squeeze as much water out of the spinach as possible for adding it to the pan though, as this will keep it from make the quiche too watery (same goes for frozen spinach). I added the spinach mixture to the pie crust and then sprinkled it with goat cheese. I beat the eggs with the milk and added salt and pepper and about 2 tbs fresh chopped parsley and 1tsp fresh thyme to the mixture. I made my own pie crust in a deep dish glass pie plate which I partially baked before adding the rest of the ingredients. Unlike others, I found that I actually didn't have enough filling to fill the crust so I added another egg to the mixture. I topped it with about 1 cup grated welsh cheddar (yum!) and a handful of chopped green onions, although I wish I had added more green onions now. This came out FABULOUS and is probably one of the best quiche recipes I've tried.

This is delicious! I actually made two quiches by just adding four eggs and half a cup of milk to the original mix.

As a note: You shouldn't put the cheese on the top for an additional 10 minutes though. It was getting burnt by the end of the cook time. I'll certainly make this again!

Unbelievably Great!  We danced around the oven huffing the yummy smells while it baked.  I only used 2 TA butter to cook the onions, and garlic.  I threw fresh mushrooms on the pile once the onions had cooked about 6 minutes.  I pre-cooked my pie shell for 7 minutes as others had recommended to keep the crust from getting too soggy.  I used plain feta (all I had on hand) and added a dash of dried rosemary, basil and oregano to the skillet.  I ended up using colby-jack in place of the suggested cheddar (again, it was all I had in the fridge), 4 eggs and 3/4 cup of half n half (same fridge related story)..used up 95 percent of the egg/half n half mixture.  I had a frozen pie shell, not deep dish.  For selfish reasons I am writing this detailed review down so I can make this exacatly again. Wow, wow, wow... this recipe is so good.

I omit the butter completely and saute the veggies in a tbsp of olive oil instead. I opt for healthier substitutions: egg beaters, 2% cheddar and skim milk or fat free half & half. I've experimented with fat free feta and the herb/garlic variety. Both are delicious but the herb/garlic does add an extra level of flavor & richness. Bump up the antioxidants by adding red pepper too. I find it easier to mix everything in a bowl before filling the crust... regardless, this recipe is wonderful!

As others have said, this is a good and forgiving quiche recipe. I made it as-is for some dinner guests, and it tasted very good, but next time I will make it without the butter, with Egg Beaters and with half the amount of cheese so I don't feel so guilty eating it! I think it could also benefit from some fresh chopped herbs... just to add more depth in flavor.

This is FANTASTIC! I made the mistake of buying tradional pie crusts insted of a deep dish, but I made a few changes and it worked out great.I used 1 cup of milk and 7 large eggs and that was enough to fill up both shells. The cooking time I adjusted to a total of 40 minutes @ 325. Also, I used tomato & herb feta-thats all Food Lion had-and it tasted great. Next time I'll still use two tradional pie shells, one for now, and one for later. Thanks for the great recipe!

This always turns out well.  I use fresh spinach and chop it in the food processor.  Also, I find that combining the spinach & egg mixture in the pastry shell is too messy.  So I mix it up in a bowl and then put it in the pastry.

This is easily the best quiche I have ever had! And that's saying a lot, because I grew up with my mother's fabulous quiches. The only thing I changed was that I used fresh mushrooms and sauteed them with the onions and garlic. And I used Olive Oil instead of butter because I am trying to eat more "good fat"... Thanks for a fabulous recipe Bailey!!!

This was good. The flavored feta made it more interesting.  I made it crustless & put it in a glass baking dish instead of a pie pan.  I cut it into squares when serving.  If I make it again, I'll try one reviewer's suggestion to mix all the cheese with the spinach instead of putting most of the cheddar on top.  I guess you could make it with chopped broccoli if you weren't a big spinach fan.

My extremely picky boyfriend loved it. I accidently bought 2 regular 9 inch pie crusts instead of a deep dish, but i seperated it between the 2 and it was still really good.

Left out the feta cheese with no apparent ill effects. We also prebaked the pie pastry for 7 minutes before filling - probably could have done another minute or two on that. Added 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper to the spinach mixture and that worked out about right. Total baking time after filling was 15 + 30 minutes. Will make again.

This was an excellent basic recipe. I made individual crustless quiches in muffin tins. I left out the mushrooms because my guests didn't really like mushrooms but added sundried tomatoes instead.  I used regular feta and fresh spinach because thats what I had. These flew off the plate.  Thanks!

Pretty good recipe.  Will make again.  !! YOU MUST USE DEEP DISH PIE CRUST !!  I didn't and had so much filling leftover it was running over the sides.  Do not forget this important advice.

The herb and garlic feta is an absolute MUST. This recipe is fantastic! I used fresh spinach instead of frozen, and didn't chop it at all, but threw the leaves in whole with the onions after the onions were translucent. It came out perfectly, and had a lot more flavor than frozen spinach.

I made this with no mushrooms or onions and it was still fantastic!  It got so many compliments and requests for the recipe.  I will keep this as my go to breakfast food.  I do think there was too much milk and maybe you only need 3 eggs, I had leftover egg mix because the deep dish crust was already filled and that was with no mushrooms!  Make this for sure if you want to wow!

I used fresh spinach and fresh mushrooms, and I must have misjudged the amounts.  I had more filling than would fit into the pie crust.  However, it was so yummy!  I think I like it better left over and reheated...the flavors blend better after it sits for a day or two.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I fixed this yesterday for the first time ever.  My wife and Mom are big spinach pie fans, so I thought I would give it a whirl.  I took some hints from other reviewers and cut back 1/2 on the butter and left out 1 egg to reduce calories/fat.  This turned out amazing!!!  I am not a huge spinach fan, and even I had 2 pieces of it.  I did use fresh baby portabella mushrooms instead of canned.  This is just a great recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

Wowza! This was a very pleasant surprise to all 5 of us at dinner last week. Who knew we loved spinach and feta so much? Easy to make and very tasty! I used fresh spinash and sauted it with the onion and garlic. Crumbled up the "tomato and basil" feta, and the cheddar, in with the spinach mixture. Topped with the milk/egg mix, but didn't pour it all in as I could see the quiche was FULL. Yummy!
I'm baking TWO of the quiches tonight for dinner...rare for me to make something again so soon!

I made this for a Mother's Day Brunch and it was a huge success!  Even the kids who hate spinach loved it. It was simple to make and tasted a lot more complicated than it really was. An instant "old standby" at our house now!!

I made this for a friends bridal shower and for my sister's baby shower.  At both events, everyone RAVED about it and asked for the recipe.  I used Ina Garten's Perfect Pie Crust recipe for the crust (found on FoodNetwork.com), and it is excellent with this quiche.

This is delicious!! I used 1/2 cup of butter just because I wanted it  to be really velvety. It was. I did not find it too greasy but if you like your pie shell crisp on the bottom bake it for 5 minutes before you fill it. I couldn't find a deep dish pie crust at my grocery store so I used 2 regular 9 inch pie crusts. This is the first quiche I ever made and I am very happy with the results. I only put feta IN the quiche, but I topped each quiche with a handful of cheddar 15 minutes into baking.

First time I ever made a quiche, and everyone at the party loved it!!! I followed what others had recommended:

I used 1 tbsp butter to saute the onions and garlic til brown. I used fresh spinach and after put them on the same skillet once the onions and garlic were brown. they wilted down nicely. I then added the mushrooms and the feta and cheddar. For my crust, Well this recipe is enough for 2 quiche! I let my crust sit in the over for 5 minutes, when I removed it I sprinkled cheddar on the bottom, and then I added the mixture evenly into both pies. I whisked 4 eggs and half a cup of milk with salt and pepper and poured them on top, and followed the rest of the recipe.. I was so proud that it came out so well, especially since it was my first time!!

Best quiche I've ever made! I followed the recipe exactly. It was perfect! I might add artichoke hearts next time. Not because it needed it but because it would have went so well with it.  My husband does not like feta cheese. He had NO IDEA it was in there. ha Thanks for the great recipe. It will be in my "keeper" file!

I've made this twice over the holidays.  Once to try it out and the next time for guests as part of a holiday brunch. Very tasty and ideal for my vegetarian friends.  The quantities here will definately make 2 full 9 inch pies.

Absolutely LOVE this recipe! I use regular pie crusts and this recipe fills two pie shells. Freezes well too so the 2nd quiche makes a very easy meal when you need a fast one. I also decrease the butter because the cheddar is already oily enough. One of my favourite recipes to make so far! Thanks.

This came out really good! I'll definitely make it again. I used fresh mushrooms rather than canned; I just added them in the beginning with the onions and garlic so they could cook down some. I should've listened to the reviews about the measurements being off. I went ahead and followed the recipe but when I poured the egg mixture, there was no way it was going to fit in a 9" pan. I probably only used half of the egg/milk mixture. Next time, I'll use 3/4 the spinach mushroom filling and only use 3 eggs and 3/4 cup of milk.

This is a great basic quiche recipe. Like another reviewer, I used the single crust recipe available on this site for my crust: 1 1/4 cup AP flour, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/3 cup shortening and about 5 tablespoons water.   I also pre-baked the crust for about 5 minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients in.  For my ingredients, I definitely didn't use any butter, (1/2 would have been way too much anyway) but I sauteed some onion and garlic in olive oil and then added about 3 cups fresh spinach, 5 fresh mushrooms sliced, and 1/4 cup diced red pepper. I let these ingredients saute until the spinach was fully wilted. Then I added 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese at the last minute and poured into the pastry shell followed by the egg mixture. I added the additional cheese as directed.   This is a great way to get rid of any leftover ingredients you have in your fridge at the end of the week. I will make it again!

This is a fantastic recipe and I make it often.  The only change I make is to use 1/4 cup butter.  It is still rich and delicious, and is always gobbled up.

The best quiche I've ever had!!!!
This is such an easy recipe and so yummy.  I did alter it sligtly to decrease the fat and calorie content.  Replacing the butter with olive oil, whole milk with fat-free milk, the whole eggs with egg whites and the cheeses with reduced fat cheese.  I also used fresh mushrooms, cooking them with the onions and garlic.  Delicious.  My husband usually hates quiche but he thought it smelled so good while cooking that he'd give it a try and ending up eating half of it before I even had 1 piece.  My 4 year old and 1 year old gobbled it up as well.  I also took the advice of others and cooked the pie crust for a few minutes before adding the ingredients.  Next time, I think I'll try a crustless to decrease the fat and calories even more.

The original recipe must be incredible because my low-fat, low-cal version was awesome.

loved this recipe. absolutely wonderful. as suggested by the other reviewers, i made a few changes. here's a general summary: 1) i baked the pie in the oven for about 2-3 minutes. any more, and the pie would have overbaked. when baking, make sure you poke a fork in the bottom a few times otherwise, the crust will bubble. 2) i only used 1/4 cup butter (1/2 stick) and that was even too much. 3) instead of just Cheddar cheese, i used to 1/2 Cheddar and 1/2 mozzerella. 4) i didn't have any preseasoned feta so i crumbled regular feta and added thyme, oregeno, basil, and garlic pepper. 4)both the spinach filling and the milk mixture turned out to be too much. i used only four eggs and a little less milk. 5) to the spinach mixture, i also added i diced red bell pepper.

Delicious, but as some others said, it makes too much for even the "deep dish" ready made pie crusts.  I divided it into two crusts, but then they were a little skimpy.  Next time I will add enough eggs and mild to make two full pie crusts.  Excellent flavor!

Great quiche!  I made this using 1 T. of olive oil to saute the onions and garlic( used only 2 cloves & half of a sm. onion)  I also only used 1 cup total for the cheddar cheese.  I can't imagine another cup because I thought it was perfect with 1 considering the feta. I will definitely make again and will use fresh mushrooms that have been sauteed.  The canned/ jar kind sort of stand out instead on blending with the other ingredients.  This was even better the next day for left overs!!

Wonderful recipe! This is the best base for quiche I've found. I make this quiche all the time... I love it because it's quick and easy to add whatever ingredients you might have in your kitchen. I sometimes add pimentos, fresh mushrooms, green chlies, or artichoke hearts (my favorite!). And throw in whatever kind of cheese you might have lying around too. I usually cut the butter and the milk in half, and I skip the cheese on top part because I'm lazy. It ALWAYS turns out great. I made one last night and I accidently forgot about it in the oven for almost 20 minutes over the bake time... to my surprise it was a little brown on top, but still perfectly delicious!  Highly recommended. :)

Due to where I am located in the world, I had to make a few substitutions.  Instead of frozen spinach, I used fresh, and instead of jarred mushrooms, I used fresh, chopped mushrooms that I had sauteed in butter.  I also had to add my own herbs to the (plain) feta cheese.  I didn't bother making a pie crust (no frozen ones here), so I just poured the ingredients in the dish and it came out like a casserole instead of a traditional quiche.  I served this dish at a party that was attended by a vegetarian and a low-carb dieter--perfect for both!  Everyone raved about it, so I am making it again tonight for some friends who are coming over.  It was best when fresh, but the reheated leftovers were also good.

Wow, this recipe was awesome!  It actually made 2 quiches and I just added 2 more eggs.  I had one with the feta and the other without and both were awesome.

I followed the recipe as written except made a few personal touches. I used a 9" Pillsbury frozen unbaked pie shell. Thaw and baked 11 minutes, which is on the product wrapper. Only used 1/4 cup butter to sauté instead of 1/2 cup. Instead of canned mushrooms, I used fresh, sliced mushrooms to taste. Sautéed these along with the onion and garlic and spinach. In place of 1/2 cup shredded cheddar, I used 1/4 cup mozzarella shredded and then divided the feta half plain and half flavored. Placed completed mixture into the cooled pie shell. I only used 1/2 cup milk beaten with the eggs and slowly poured over the spinach mixture. I poured small amounts of the eggs/milk mixture into the solids a few times so the liquid would be absorbed. If you pour all the liquid in at one time, then it doesn't absorb well and the liquid runs off which is what I'm reading happened in some of the other reviews. Then, finally 1/4 cup of shredded mozzarella was put on top and pie was baked and cooled.  My husband said it was literally the best quiche he's ever had in his life!  It was moist and made excellent left-overs.   Thank you for submitting this quiche recipe!

Followed recipe except reduced butter to 1/4 cup and only used 1 garlic close. Boyfriend said multiple times how good it was. Next time, I will put the shell on the top so it doesn't get soggy

Excellent quiche, made it as the recipe was written except I did reduce the butter to a 1/4 cup and the milk to 2/3 cup.  Everyone raved about it.  Thanks, Bailey for the great recipe.

I used fresh spinach only (no mushrooms).  2 large "freezer bags" full of spinach.  It sautés down to the perfect amount for one quiche. Also added some minced country ham to give it some smoky flavor. One spice to add to the egg mixture is nutmeg. I didn't add the cheese at the end, but I used a combination of jalapeno jack cheddar and baby swiss in the mixture. Once you put the egg mixture over the spinach, take a fork and lightly fluff everything together.I will also say, use 1/2 stick butter max. Fresh spinach is the way to go. -Rally'smom

Wonderful quiche recipe! I like substituting white cheddar cheese and egg whites. I made it once in a 9 inch pan, and a second time in a cupcake tray, both times it came out great. Fun recipe with a lot of room to play with. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was great! My eight year old will only eat spinach in this recipe. I did make some changes: Used fresh spinach instead of frozen, deleted mushrooms and used regular feta not herb.

This was my very first time making a quiche. I loved it. I was reading the reviews for this recipe and I would have to agree with veggiemommie in that,the spinach with the herb and garlic feta was such an amazing combination. I did however add in some shallots in with the sautee blend. Thank you for sharing the recipe

WE LOVED THIS!!!!! But of course I made it my own, 1st I cut the butter to 6 TBSP. Then I added 2 eggs and 1/2 cup milk. I also added 1/2 cup cranberries and 1/2 cup ham. I followed the recipe but made 2 9" deep dish pies. Awesome, this is going into our dinner rotation and will add it to our pot luck menu, too.

I don't typically leave reviews, but after using this recipe dozens of times, I knew I owed it to the creator to take the time and say how amazing this recipe is.  I've made this spinach quiche countless different ways and every version, including the original, always turns out perfect.  The original recipe is incredible -but- some variations I've created: making my own whole wheat pie crust, baking it with no crust at all and using all low fat and fat free ingredients {i.e. low fat feta, fat free cheddar, skim milk, low fat Brummel & Brown yogurt butter, etc...}, I've even replaced the 10 ounces of spinach with 10 ounces of crab meat, have replaced the spinach with bacon and used all Swiss cheese - stunning, every way you bake it.

This was really good.  Like some other reviewers, I used olive oil for the butter for less fat.  I also used fresh mushrooms and fresh spinach.  I think I should have drained the mixture before adding to the egg mixture since the fresh ingredients seemed to have a lot of liquid after cooking.  Great change from the ordinary ham and swiss quiche!

Great recipe! I eliminated all shortcuts: used a bag of fresh spinach, fresh mushrooms, green onion, olive oil to sautee these ingredients. Skipped garlic, but added garlic sault to spinach mix. Used Pillsbury frozen pie crust (thin, it takes about 1 hr to thaw, then i just unroll it and put into a pie dish). Prep time - 15 min, bake time - 35 min. It is a very popular dish in our house!

So incredibly good! I will make this again and again.  I accidentally used a regular crust versus the deep dish, so it overflowed just a bit, but still came out tasting really wonderful.  I reduced the butter to 1 1/2 tablespoons and used fresh mushrooms and spinach.

I thought this recipe was delicious! The only critique I have is that it was WAY too cheesy, and I didn't even use as much as the recipe called for. I had 1/4 of the pie for dinner, and I felt sick for the rest of the night because of the cheese. I also reduced the butter to just about a tablespoon or two, which I thought was plenty. I will definitely be making this again, but reducing the cheddar cheese to about 4 oz instead of 8.

Overall very good.  I give it 4 stars because it is a bit greasy from too much butter.  Also, it really does need a DEEP dish pie crust or you will have way too much filling and won't have enough room to pour the egg mixture.

This was really yummy. I made it for a family luncheon. I did not use the mushrooms and I used fresh spinach instead if frozen. It eliminated alot of the water. I never used feta cheese in a quiche before. It made it very creamy and delicious. Everyone raved about it. My brother-n-law thought it was store bought. I serve it with a cranberry salad on the side. Will make this again.

This quiche is absolutely scrumptious, with a couple of modifications that I got from other reviewers.  I only used 1/4 cup of butter and a little over 1/2 cup of milk.  Also I omitted the mushrooms, but that's only because I hate mushrooms.  I used swiss cheese in place of the feta, only for personal preference.  Otherwise, I made this exactly per the recipe, and it is soooo good!!!

Very quick and easy!  I made it several times for different audiences.  Each was a success.  As someone mentioned, this is a very forgiving recipe.  The last time I made it, I forgot the milk, but nobody noticed the difference.

Tweeked somewhat to what I had on hand. Used no butter. Sauteed 1/2 lb fresh mushrooms with sliced green onions and garlic. Added 1 lb of fresh spinach and black pepper. No salt needed with Feta. Let drain in a mesh colander about an hour. Beat 3 eggs with 1/2 c. milk, added the feta and mozzarella cheese. Baked the crust for seven minutes. Combined spinach mixture with egg mix and filled deep dish shell perfectly. Baked until golden topped with more mozzarella - baked until melted. Fantastic!! My husband and I really enjoyed this and it will be in our regular rotation.

Great idea but yes, the proportions are off.  My suggestions, cut butter down to 2 tblsp., cut the cheese (no pun intended) by half and use 16 oz. of light sour cream instead of the milk.  This perfectly fills 1 pie shell and makes it nice and firm.  Nothing worse than a soggy or mushy quiche.  Another easy thing to do is just saute the first 5 ingredients, Then mix the rest in a large bowl.  Combine them in the end and pour in the shell.  It helps with consistancy. The feta, garlic, spinach combo is fabulous.  Red pepper is a nice touch too.

I wanted to make this recipe but found I didn't have a pie crust, so I combined it with a crustless spinach quiche recipe from this site.  I ended up using five eggs and no milk.  I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and added some olives and jalapenos just because I had some open already.  Quiche is so forgiving, you can add anything you like!  I really like the feta cheese flavor in this; it's so good with spinach!  Because there was no crust, I only cooked it for 30 minutes at 350.  Yum!  Thanks for sharing.

just need to make a few minor changes....cook the onion and garlic in 2-3 Tbs of butter (no need for 1/2 cup!)...keep everything else the same, BUT, use two pie crusts instead of one.  This came out so yummy!!!  (Also, might need to use foil around the edges of the pie crust so it wont get too browned)...I've made it two more times...add some italian seasoning and garlic powder if you'd like

I wanted to write this before I went to bed in case I had a coronary in my sleep due to the stick of butter called for in this recipe. Yet to have this be the last thing that passed my lips, I would die happy. This was awesome! I subbed herbed goat cheese for the feta (I'm sure that would have been great too, but I used what was on hand) and it added this delicious creaminess to it. I also subbed a bag of fresh spinach (9 oz.) and half a basket of fresh sliced mushrooms (1/2 of an 8 oz) instead of frozen and canned. I thought maybe that was why I was able to squeeze in maybe half of the egg mixture, but it sounds like a common problem. The only real problem I had was the crust burning, so I'll just put a bit of foil around it for the first 15 next time. Thanks sooooo much for sharing!

I made this last Saturday and it was great! The only things I changed was I used a package of fresh mushrooms and half of a red bell pepper chopped to give it some more color. I also couldn't find a deep dish pie crust so I used 2 normal size crusts and they filled up perfectly. Not sure how all the filling would've fit in one pie crust. Very good, will def. make again!!

I stuck pretty close to the recipe as it is written.  I didn't have any feta on hand, so I left that out.  I also added about 5 slices of crispy chopped bacon which gave it a nice flavor.  And I reduced the milk to 1/2 a cup.  The end result was great!  It was just moist enough without being soggy.

The feta cheese taste was too strong and overpowered everything else.  Followed other reviews to add less butter and milk.

This is probably one of the best quiches I've ever had, and as a vegetarian I go through a lot of quiche! There's a trick to making this one, though - I have to cook my pie crusts beforehand so they don't come out still gooey by the time the egg/cheese is done, and I layer the spinach and egg mixtures to get a more even spread. Olives make a great addition... but so would just about anything. :)

My co-workers loved this recipe!  After sauteeing the mushrooms I added fresh spinach.  I used monterrey-jack instead of cheddar and it gave it a very subtle flavor.  I baked the pie shell for 10 minutes as I don't like a soggy crust.  Very good, have made it twice since.

This is great- even my kids love it. We have been making it for years and everyone always loves it. It's very flavorful, unlike some quiche I have had. Make sure you get the herbed feta if you can find it- it's in the dairy case or sometimes the deli in my local supermarkets. The best recipe I have found so far!

Great Quiche base recipe.  I've made this several times recently and have received rave reviews every single time. I have made quite a few changes - but I think this is a good base recipe.  You can pretty much add any type of veggie and cheese you like.  I've made it a tad healthier by using a combo of egg beaters, turkey sausage, onion, green pepper, mushrooms and reduced fat cheddar cheese and the results are outstanding.  The cooktime remains the same.  Great recipe!

Very good and very rich.  We added some chopped ham and it was great.  Won't make it too often because it is so high in kcals and fat, but definitely a keeper for special occasions!

Very good.  The 6 serving recipe is enough for 2 dishes.   I didn't have time to heat up the cheese in the mushrooms, spinach, and onions.  The dish still turned out great!

This is a wonderful recipe. My family really enjoys all the flavors of the cheeses. Our 4yr old loves spinach and this was a real treat for her. 2nd's the next day for lunch is just as good. Thank you for posting.

This quiche was excellent. I used skim milk, 3T butter 3T Olive Oil and added tomatoes after the first 20 minutes of baking. I used fresh spinach which I highly recommend.I also sprinkled basil on top. I ended up making two, It was a big hit at brunch.

This is a great recipe!  I took the advise of the previous reviews and used very little butter, just enough to saute the onions & garlic, using a tablespoon or less.  It turned out great...but it is defiantly more  of a spinach pie than a quiche.  I had left over spinach mix which I ate with tortilla chips and it was delicious!!!  Fantastic recipe, even I couldn't mess it up!

This recipe was great.  I used only slightly less butter and spinach and it turned out great.  I did not add mushrooms as 2 out of the 3 people eating the quiche don't like them!  Instead of cheddar cheese I used mozzarella.  I did not have a pie crust so I used puff pastry and blind baked it a bit first.  I will make this again and again! YUM

This is fantastic. Everyone loves it without exception. I use fresh mushrooms and let them cook for a bit with the garlic and onion to simmer off the additional moisture. I also add garlic powder and a bit of parmesan cheese. The crust is important - I like Ms. Smith's the best.

Great dish and very easy to make. Only thing I did differently is added about 10oz of diced ham. Came out with much more flavor than expected for such a simple dish. Highly recommend it, also goes great with a crisp Riesling wine.

I was a little hesitant to use feta in this recipe, and then I also forgot to get the herbed kind... BUT, I went ahead with the recipe and it turned out great.  Fresh mushrooms were used as well.  Everyone loved this dish at my Mother's Day brunch.  Thanks!

I've never made a quiche before so I was learly making this for a dinner party but it was awesome!  I took other's advice and prebaked the shell about 10 min and had no trouble with sogginess.  Found there to be wayyy to much cheddar and we love cheese, would probably cut back on that...oh and for those of you who had a hard time getting your quiche to set, use sour cream instead of milk and you'll have no problem!

Finally -- a quiche recipe I would make again! I followed the recipe exactly, only omitting the mushrooms.  I used sharp cheddar which complemented the tang of the feta nicely.  I also precooked the crust for about 7 minutes so I didn't get any soggy spots in the center of the crust.  I was so pleased by this recipe because the eggs were neither runny nor overcooked - they stayed moist even after reheating for leftovers the next day.  I served with a fruit salad and french bread which was a wonderful contrast to the savory flavors.

Excellen!  Made a couple adjustments.  Added bacon and cut down on the salt.  Pre-baked the pie shell and I think it helped keep the bottom crisp.  Also, this made enough to fill two 9" pie pans.  I used 5 eggs and 1 cup milk.  I also mixed it all togehter in a bowl and then poured it into the shells - thought it would mix better that way.  Everyone if the family liked it, even the kids and the hubby who doesn't generally care for quiches or spinach!  Will definitely be adding this recipe to our list of 'regulars'!  A++

I took this recipe to an all girl's weekend in the mountain and won the award for best dish!  I heard from several people that weekend that it was the best quiche they had ever had! Thanks! I too used 1/2 the butter and plain Feta, wonderful!

This was really simple.  I almost messed it up, though:  I am not sure if you were supposed to pre-bake the pie shell or not, but I did prebake it and because of that, the crust almost burnt when I baked it with the filling in it (I had to put foil over the edges and it still got too browned).  I had extra filling, I think it will fill a second pie crust...it's in the freezer for a lazy day.  The flavor is really good.  I didn't have herbed feta, just regular, and that was good in it.  I also used fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  I highly recommend this recipe! *** UPDATE *** I've made this recipe many times with great success.  I usually use feta without herbs but this last time I used 6 oz of herbed feta, my husband said it was the best way I made it.  Picky family member loves it and went back for seconds.

Finally! A quiche that worked out perfectly. Not runny on the inside, and fabulous flavor. I didn't add any extra salt or pepper, it's not necessary. I used regular feta, and forgot the garlic. I also used fresh spinach that I wilted in the microwave first, and fresh sliced mushrooms that I didn't have to do anything to.

This is a great recipe.  I modified it to make it a little lighter, and it turned out wonderful!  I only used 1 tbs of butter to sautee the garlic and onions per other reviewers' comments about the "grease factor."  In addition to the other ingredients, I used egg substitute (5 egg equivalents), 3.5 oz reduced fat feta cheese, ~6oz spinach (that's all I had left), and 8oz of reduced fat cheddar shreds.  I also excluded the milk because I didn't have time to drain the spinach.  I just mixed everything together instead of working it layer by layer, and it's delicious.  Other reviewers were right about not needing salt at all.  The cheese definitely takes care of that!

This was my first attempt at quiche and it came out absolutely delicious! I read the comments before trying out the recipe, so I had an idea of what I was getting into. I omitted the mushrooms and feta cheese, used only 1 tbsp butter + 1 tbsp olive oil to sautee the veggies, used a little more than 1/2 cup of SKIM milk, and used only 2 eggs. I also added 1/4 cup parmesan cheese to the egg mixture along with a couple tbsp of fresh chopped parsley. I had just the right amount of veggies + egg mixture to fill the 9" deep dish crust. This was a quick and easy meal that I feel I can make any time. Highly recommended!

This is a wonderful quiche recipe.  I used to regular pie shells.  Sauteed fresh spinach with the onions and garlic, added fresh sliced mushrooms sauteed in butter.   I used regular feta and riccotta in a mixture to equal six ounces and sprinkled Mrs. Dash Tomato, Basil and Garlic seasonings along with seasoned salt and fresh cracked tri-colored pepper.  Baked for 50 minutes and this dish is superb!  Take it from a former breakfast chef from a local B&B.  I served it with fresh sliced Georgia Peaches and Blueberries and Pumpernickel Toast with Homeade HoneyBell Orange Marmalade.

Very savory recipe - excellent taste! I made this recipe the night before and served it as one dish the next day at a baby shower brunch. It was very popular! I used 3T olive oil instead of the 1/2 cup butter, 4 cloves of garlic instead of 3, 4oz feta instead of 6oz, 6oz cheddar instead of 8oz. I used about 1/2 cup less of the spinach mixture and all of the egg mixture and it was perfect. Another option would be to use less milk (maybe 1/2 cup) and keep all of the spinach mixture. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

Absolutely to DIE for!!  My husband who hates spinach went back for second and third helpings.  A huge hit at Mother's Day brunch.  Did have more than what the pie crust would hold, but it didn't change the flavor any.  Thanks so much for sharing!!

This was simple and super delicious.  I made it for Christmas Day lunch and it received many rave reviews.  I left out the feta (too many picky guests) and replaced it with more cheddar cheese.  It was as if the recipe was suppose to be this way.  Wonderful! Thanks for sharing!!!

This was my second quiche recipe that I've tried from this site, and this one is hands-down the best.

This was really tasty. I cut the amounts of butter and cheddar cheese in half, and it was still plenty cheesy and rich. I used a homemade crust in a 9.5 in. deep dish pan, and it was full to the top.  I think next time I might use the same amount of filling to make two smaller, thinner pies.

This is a great recipe.  I made it for my in-laws and two quiches dissappeared.  I felt that it was a fairly easy recipe, but it did create a lot of messy dishes.  Also tastes great as leftovers the next day.

Excellent recipe.  I have been making spinach quiche for years, but I have to say that the feta sauteed in garlic is excellent.  I couldn't find the garlic and herb feta so used plain feta.  I also add vegetarian bacon (Morningstar).

First time I've made a quiche.  I wanted to use up the rest of my fresh spinach and I was very pleased at how it turned out.  I used just a bit of olive oil instead of the butter, much less cheese than recommended, I used fresh cut up mushrooms and I also used 1/2 cup of milk instead.  Turned out great and was a healthier version of the original.

Very nice.  We all liked this a lot, though I think it was a bit heavy on the butter.  This definitely made TWO 9-inch pies, not one.  Nice to have the leftovers.

i added bacon, just cheddar cheese, 1/2 the amount of butter and 1/4 less garlic, and fresh spinach. I would only use fresh mushrooms if I made it again. It was great but it needed more than an hour to cook. that might be my oven though.

This recipe was so gol darn delicious.  I made two so I could share with my daughter's family. When she came to pick her's up, she ate a piece from my dish and went home and ate two more pieces.  I used fresh spinach and mushrooms instead of frozen and canned.  I, also, topped with crumbled crispy bacon.  I can't wait to make it again! I do make my own homemade pie crust, too. I'm very picky on my pie crust... I have the easiest and most delicious crust recipe. Should I share it? It has great taste and is very flakey and tender.

Not that this recipe needs any more reviews declaring how wonderful it is, but it's wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. I didn't read the note that there would be extra filling so I made the full recipe, but then saved the extra filling in the fridge to make some delicious omelettes the next morning. Thank you for an exceptional recipe!

This was simply amazing!  So easy to make and incredibly DELISH.  I did change just a couple things.  I added 2 table spoons of pesto as well as exchanging 1/2 cup of Cheddar for Mozzarella.  The spinach mixture before adding it to the pie crust was so  delish, it could actually be used for a dip all by itself.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

I changed a few things, but this quiche came out great.  I used frozen spinach as well as frozen onion, and I omitted the mushrooms.  I also added mozzarella cheese, and next time I think I'll add swiss. Great recipe!

This was excellent!  I did what others suggested and put it in 2 nine inch deep dish pie crusts.  I wasn't able to find herb and garlic feta and just used plain feta and upped the amount of garlic used in the recipe.  Also used sharp cheddar cheese rather than cheddar cheese.  It was yummy!!!!!  Would definitely make again.

I like this quiche well enough but the time to cook is off by quite a bit. The in-oven time alone is 55 minutes with 10 minutes to sit after so that's already an hour and 5 mins without counting the preparation time.  This is crucial when I come home from work and need to know at a quick glance how long dinner will take to get on the table. I hope the recipe owner will amend this. Otherwise this is a very good quiche that I use for Meatless Mondays a lot.

I like to switch this recipe up a little. I make 24 mini quiches in a muffin pan and freeze them to eat throughout the week. Two or three and a fruit smoothie make a great breakfast! I use Ruth's Grandma's pie crust recipe and just put the pie crust on the bottom of the muffin liners, cooking the crust for 5 minutes before adding the mixture, then for 25 minutes. Also, fresh spinach and mushrooms make this recipe! The fresher the ingredients the better it tastes after being frozen all week. We never have feta in my house so I use a white Italian cheese blend instead.

Very tasty and disappeared quickly. Made some changes. Based on repeated issues in the reviews about being too oily and wet, cut butter to 1/4 cup (half stick) and milk to 2/3 cup. Egg-washed the pie crust, and baked for 7 minutes before filling to resist a soggy bottom pie crust. Used fresh mushrooms rather than canned, and added sweet peppers and fresh basil when cooking the spinach mixture. Used 4 ounce package of herb & garlic feta as it’s now commonly packaged in a smaller size. Placed thinly sliced green onions on top of pie as last step before baking. With added ingredients, it almost perfectly filled a Mrs. Smith’s 9 inch deep dish pie pan close to the top (about 1/4 cup excess egg mixture) . . . had no oven spillover as others say they encountered although pie tin placed inside an extra deep ceramic pie dish just in case. While it will be made again as made this time, we’ll also try another version with 8 ounces of herb & garlic feta but no cheese on top, even less or no butter, and 1/2 cup milk with a glug of sherry. A definite keeper!!

This was excellent!  I used 4 large eggs and two regular 9" pie crusts that I pre-baked for 7 minutes before adding the filling.

Very Very Good! 

Made some Changes:
Used less then 1/4 c. Butter 
(otherwise it would be mighty greasy)
Used 4 c. fresh spinach 
Used 1 c. Portabella mushrooms
Also put tomato slices on the top to make the quiche look amazing.

Definitely Use the deep dish pie crust youll need the space. 
AND the picture is not what it looks like with the spinach on the bottom and everything else on the top.  I mixed and i would suggest mixing it all up to you too! :)

Fabulous Recipe!!!

Very easy to make but I ended up with twice the amount of spinach/cheese mixture. I would suggest using half  of the spinach, feta, onion, cheddar. The egg mixture was fine amount wise.
    I used the extra spinach and cheese for individual quiches in muffins tins. I had enough over for 6!

Awesome! I also made a modified version, no pie crust, just baked the ingredients in greased cup cake pans. I used no butter, only olive oil to saute the onions and garlic. I also added the (fresh) mushrooms and (fresh) spinach for a few minutes to cook them down to better fit in the cupcakes. I used 5 eggs and only a few splashes of milk. I added the cheeses separately per cupcake cup, just a pinch of each. The cooking time was a lot less, 10 min/ add cheddar to top/ then another 10-15min depending on the pan. Turned out great! It made 12 mini quiches!

This has way to much butter in it for my tastes.  Next time will def 1/2 the butter at least.  I used all eggs whites and (besides the butter) was good.

This was delicious. However, I had to make a few modifications because I didn't have some ingredients handy:

• I didn't use cheddar cheese; I used swiss cheese.
• I nixed the mushrooms
• I used regular feta

My suggestion: I don't know if i accidentally used a smaller pie crust than suggested, but the egg mixture was too much.

I did as other reviewers suggested and halved the amount of onion and spinach and cheese.  I did leave more mushrooms in to make for a happy family, though :D  

The other thing I did was omit the feta cheese, instead opting to make the recipe entirely with cheddar.  We don't like feta cheese much and since it would have been too much cheese anyway...

I sauteed the veggies in just a touch of olive oil instead of butter, used skim milk and egg beaters, and 2% cheese instead of full fat, and it turned out to be a MUCH lighter version of the quiche while still being tasty!  Will definitely make this again

This is the most amazing quiche I and my boyfriend have ever had! I am funny about quiche but this was so delicious. I would make this again and again. All the ingredients right down to the crust blended well but the recipe calls for one pie but if you decided to make this get two pie crust because there is an error with the amount of ingredients for one pie. Thank god I got 2 crust in a value pack because I needed it.

Used 4 eggs 1/2 cup milk.  1/3 amount of feta and 1/3 the amount of cheddar, no mushrooms and 1 tablespoon of butter and a little olive oil.  Make sure to squeeze the excess water from spinach.  It came out delish & I felt it was somewhat healthy!!  Update added some ham & it was awesome!! Great results if you don't use all the butter and cheese!!

I absolutely love this recipe. A stick of butter, and nearly a pound of cheese tastes so delicious. But it was really too much cheese and I only used 4 oz of feta.

I'd say cut the feta to 4 oz and cheddar to 4 or 5, still putting a half cup of the cheddar in the quiche and the rest on top. 

Be sure when you thaw the spinach to squeeze it dry afterwards. The quiche ended up soggy when I forgot to do this.

Having made this twice I'm not sure how to keep the egg mixture from spilling over the top when I add it. The extra water from the spinach may have contributed. Maybe I need a better pie pan with higher edges. And next time I'm going to have the pie pan on the baking pan on the oven rack before I add the eggs so almost no movement is needed.

Very Yummy. I added fresh spinach instead of frozen, 1 Tbsp onion powder instead of fresh onion, left out the butter and the cheddar completely, added 4 extra eggs, 1 extra cup of milk and 2 cups of plain Feta. I also used a 9 x 13 and skipped the pie crust.

Excellent. I used fresh mushrooms (sauteed in the butter with onions and garlic). I prebaked my pie shells for 5 minutes and didn't have any soggy crust problems at all. You'll need two pie shells for these quantities, so cut the recipe in half if you only want one quiche. It came out wonderfully and I've got tons of leftovers!

The flavor was good, but the texture was only so-so. I'll make it again, but next time use less milk. I would probably keep it in the oven a few minutes longer too.

Left this review on one of the modified version. Should probably leave it on the original as well:

A perfect quiche. I've made quiches before where it's more of a vegetable pie with the ingredients not really meshing together. This is different. Spinach and mushrooms complement each other perfectly. And surprisingly, it's not the cheddar but the feta that really does the trick in tying together all the ingredients. You get the richness with the mushrooms and the healthy goodness with the spinach. The only thing I added was a pinch of freshly ground nutmeg. Got a week's worth of lunches out of one gigantic quiche. Keeps very well. This one's a keeper! Thanks!

Some more mods I made:
I used a couple tablespoons canola oil instead of the butter. I also used fresh spinach and fresh mushrooms, sauteed down so as most of their water is gone. Also, as others have said, this recipe does make too much for one deep dish store-bought pie shell. I just cooked the overflow in a few ramekins without the pastry. Didn't stick much because of all that yummy cheese!

I would alter the recipe and use fresh mushrooms. Saute them in butter add a little worcestershire sauce,
Salt & Pepper.  Then add them to the Spinach mix.

This is good! I always thought that quiche would be difficult to make but this was a very simple recipe.   I revised the recipe a bit based on recommendations. To cut down on some of the fat and calories, I used 1 tablespoon of "I cant believe it's not butter", mixed two eggs with 1/3 cup of egg white, 1 cup of skim milk, and lowfat colby jack. I'll definitely make this again.

Loved this!  The only changes I made were:  used 2 Tbs Smart Balance margarine, half an onion, 1/2 cup milk, 1-1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, which is all I had, egg substitute and fresh mushrooms.  It was just enough to fill the pie pan.  Next time I'll add more onions and cheese and not use a pie crust.

This was very yummy!! I left out the feta and added ham because I had some on hand.  I will definitely make this again. It was pretty quick and easy for using up on hand ingredients.

I took other reviewers advice and only used 2Tbs of butter and used 3/4 cup milk. I also used fresh spinach which I will do again. My family loved it.

This was very flavorful. There was enough filling for two store-bought deep-dish pie crusts, so make sure you have two on hand or you will not use half of the filling (or just make your own crust in a deep-dish pie plate as they tend to hold more than the store-bought ones)

This is now our favorite Quiche recipe. The great thing is it is awesome just like it is or you can play with it and add things. We like to add crab. YUM. I always make 2 (like another rater suggested)by splitting the main ingredients and doing the milk and eggs seperatly for each. 1 cup of mik 4 eggs per each pie...sooo good.

I was cooking for both my vegetarian sister and my meat-loving husband and family members all along the spectrum in between, so I had fun with this recipe!  I made two quiches, one that was fairly similar to this recipe, and one that used this recipe as a base but turned out very different after I left out the spinach and loaded it up with ham.  Both were very popular!  One note: this recipe makes way too much for one pie crust.  If you don't make two quiches, you'll have to reduce some of the ingredients.  (You should reduce the butter anyway.)

Very good recipe.  If you want to make just one quiche, use 1/4 cup or less (next time I will use 3 T because I think 1/4 is still just a tad too much).  I used fresh spinach and wilted it after the onions and garlic was simmered.  Fresh mushrooms are better.  Only used 1 garlic clove because other family members have a sensitve tummy, havarti cheese instead of feta, and to make it very creamy and not too liquidy, use 2 full eggs and 2 egg yolks instead of all four eggs.  Also using 1 cup of heavy cream made it perfect.  To test if done, slide a butter knife about 1-1/2 inches from the outside rim.  If it comes out clean, it's ready to be taken out of the oven.  Allow it to stand for 10 minutes and then try to only eat one piece.  You won't be able to stop with just one piece.

Very good, but I agree it is too much butter and next time will decrease butter to 1/4 cup.  I used fresh spinach and added a shredded chicken breast, I divided the ingredients between two pie shells and it was perfect.  Waiting to see if the recipient of the second quiche enjoyed hers too.

obviously I am in the minority but I did not like this quiche. I found it way to salty-from the feta. I'll stick to my traditional spinach quiche.

I had two pie crusts leftover from Thanksgiving, so I was looking for a tasty and inexpensive way to use them. This recipe was perfect. I made it last weekend with 2% sharp cheddar, parmesan, frozen spinach and no onion (because I was all out). My bf loved it- we couldn't stop eating it. Today I made it again with 2% sharp cheddar, frozen spinach, onion, and black forest ham. It's in the oven- can't wait to taste it! This is a perfect recipe for a brunch. It stays very tasty even at room temperature, and is very forgiving, as the contributer promised!

I love this recipe! Did modify just a little...didn't use as much butter, added tomatoes instead of mushrooms and just plain feta. Made 2 regular pie shells instead of 1 deep dish...one in the freezer for later. Will definitely be using this one again! Oh and went just perfect with mimosas!

It was pretty good.  I used only 2 tbs of butter and made 2 quiches.  I froze one for future use and it held up well.

Since I did not read everyone's review before making this recipe, I made it twice and came out bad twice.  Too much butter, to much spinach, to much cheese and eggs, and milk.  Also, I could not fit it into a 9 inch pie crust.

VERY very yummy recipe! Made it for a bunch and got all rave reviews. A few things worth mentioning: a HALF a cup of butter is unnecessary. You're sauteeing onion and garlic... don't get me wrong, butter is one of my food groups, and i don't believe I ever cut back in a recipe, but a T is perfectly fine. I also used light cream, which made the consistency extra creamy/custardy. And the spinach mix is about 2 C more then what you need for a standard 9 in pie pan. Add a bit more and you can easily have 2 quiches out of the recipe. The main substitution I did was mozzerella instead of chedder, just seemed more fitting. It's actually good with either, but I personally like mozz better in a recipe like this. I would highly suggest Martha Stewart's "Pate Brisee" recipe for the pie crust.  Excellent recipe! I will be making this again!

Great quiche!  Only one suggestion - bake the pie crust for 7 minutes or so before you fill it so that the bottom doesn't come out soggy.  Other than that it was excellent.

The only thing I did different than the recipe was use plain feta crumbles.  I couldn't find the garlic herb crumbles.  It was YUMMY!!  For those that said it was too much filling...????  I don't understand.  Mine fit my deep dish pie plate *perfectly*!!  And...I really didn't think it was too oily at all.  I did squeeze the spinach dry....not just drain it.  I'll definitely keep this recipe!  YUM!  Maybe the problem people had with it being too much filling is that they didn't use a *deep* dish pie plate?  Maybe...the deep dish pie crusts in the disposable pie plate are not as deep as a deep dish pie plate???  I don't know.  I don't buy the crusts that are in a disposable pie plate.  I use bought crusts with my own pie plate.

this was so super easy--i would definitely make it again.  As suggested I did deviate a bit with the ingredients, I didn't have herb feta so I substituted 2 wedges of laughing cow cheese and I added sauteed diced ham.  It was a huge hit!

Great recipe, however I made a few changes: added olives and anchovy fillets; used 2 eggs and only a dash of milk. I didn't measure other ingredients but used only a little butter to saute the onion & garlic. I'll definitely make this pie again

Great recipe.  I bought non-deep dish pie crust and ended up with two quiche from the same amount of the other ingredients.  I did not use 1/2 c of butter.  I used 1/4 c to saute the garlic and onions and it was perfectly fine.

This is the best quiche I've ever tasted! I make it into 8 servings instead of 6 but it's still gone within 2 days between my boyfriend and I!  I have to start making 2-3 at a time!  Only changes I made were using a little less butter (1 heaping tbsp), using fresh mushrooms instead of canned, using bagged baby spinach instead of frozen, and cutting the egg/milk amounts in half because there's not enough room for it all in the pie crust.    For those folks who don't like an eggy quiche or don't like quiche because it's eggy, this is the perfect recipe.  I have friends who don't like quiche but love this!

This recipe is so yummy! You can add or take out whatever you want and it will taste great. I like to roll out the crescent rolls dough and use that for the crust instead. The crust comes out flakey and so yum!

Quiche is a standby meal at my house and this one is a good one.  I like to mix my quiche about ten minutes into cooking to avoid burnt edges with a unset center.

Supremely delicious.  I added extra mushrooms and some bacon crumbles.  Next time I think I'll mix the eggs with the spinach mixture prior to pouring into the pie shell.

Amazing recipe! I tweeked a few things per other reviewers suggestions. I decreased butter to 1/4 C. & decreased milk to 1/2 C.  I used fresh mushrooms & sauteed them with the garlic & onion. To put my own spin on it, I also added 6 strips of crumbled bacon, paprika and parsley flakes. I didn't have feta on hand so I used mozzarella. It was wonderfully rich and flaky! I'm definately replacing my old quiche recipe with this one.

I decided to make this quiche because I had all the ingredients on hand except a deep dish pie crust and I planned on making my own pie crust.  Do NOT do this!!!  All of these ingredients will not fit in a standard pie crust and pie plate.  I realized this too late, and tried to fix it.  It still turned out great, but next time I will definitely be sure to get the deep dish crust.

I took other reviewers' advice and brushed the crusts with egg whites and baked it for about 7 minutes to prevent a soggy bottom and it came out perfect! I did use the entire stick of butter (my bf loves butter) and I used two crusts instead of trying to fit it into one pie. I'm going to try and give away one of them so I don't eat it all because it is so freaking good, yum!

Everyone LOVED this recipe at a recent family brunch.  I added (and cubed some) ham steak (although I originally figured I'd use smoked ham) and used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of using milk (although I'd probably try it with milk next time and see how different the taste is).  I did not really measure too well when it came to the garlic & herb feta cheese (as I couldn't figure out what 6 ozs was in comparison to the package I had).  My husband also accidentally put in all the cheddar cheese instead of saving half after the first 15 minutes of cooking.  No one took just one piece !  We used two frozen pie crusts (9 inch and not deep dish) as there was enough for two and all two were gone (or someone took home leftovers).  It is a DEFINITE keeper and I'll never make another quiche recipe again after finding this winner. Thanks !

Yum! I could only find feta in 4 oz. pkgs, so I use 2 of those (8 oz.) and then made 1.5 times the recipe for the rest of the ingredients (meaning 6 eggs, more mushrooms, 1.5 pkg. of spinach, etc.), but kept the same amount of milk 1 c.--although it probably would have worked with more milk. This filled 2 regular sized pie pans (used frozen pie crusts, pre-baked for 7 minutes with edges covered in foil) and a sm. creme brulee sized dish. The crust really makes  this recipe though, because the smaller one was crustless and it wasn't nearly as good. Also, I didn't wait to throw in the cheese (oops! didn't follow directions!), so I just turned down the temp. Overall, really good. I figure since this is already loaded with calories, this might taste better with half & half or a bit of sour cream instead of milk. I normally make my quiches with bacon or ham, but I was bringing this to a work function and quite a few of my co-workers were Catholic, so they don't eat meat on Fridays (Lent). I'll make this super flexible recipe again. I'd also like to add that the feta cheese was barely noticeable, flavors really meshed well. Thanks!

We really enjoyed this recipe; it was fluffier than others I have made in the past.  I only used 4 tablespoons of butter and it was plenty, with all the cheese it was rich enough and you really do not need it.  I made this twice once with cheddar and feta, and one with Swiss and little cheddar(little bland), both very good, but we prefer recipe as stated.  When making my quiches, I have always brush 1 tsp Dion mustard on bottom of uncooked pie crust, for little flavor.  I mixed all the ingredients together, instead of pouring the egg mixture over the spinach mixture, and it came out great. I would definitely make this recipe again.

This is the best quiche recipe ever! The only change I made is by adding fresh mushrooms and cooking them in pan with the onions and garlic. Thank you for a truly fabulous recipe!

Great recipe. Easy to prepare and tasty. I substitute fresh spinach for the frozen kind and think it enhances the flavor.

This was my first quiche and it was delicious!  As Bailey stated, the recipe is very forgiving, allowing you to modify to suit your taste.  Like some, I used 1 fewer egg and 3/4 of cup of 1% lactaid free milk, I also substituted olive oil for the butter and 6 oz of marinated artichoke hearts for the mushrooms. Again, delicious! Finally, as with some of the other reviews, I pre-baked the crust for 5-7 minutes and would recommend adding the top layer of cheese during the last 15 minutes of the cooking process; otherwise the cheese will be too brown.

What a terrific recipe!  I followed the previous reviewers and cut the butter & salt out entirely.  I would also suggest you reverse the timing of the cheese topping.  Bake for 45 minutes, then add the cheese (I use white cheddar so it looks prettier) for the final 15 minutes of baking.  When I followed the original recipe the cheese browned way too much.

The best quiche I've had in a long time.  I followed exactly by the directions but it overflowed a little and I had a deep dish crust...maybe only three eggs next time.

I made this quiche for a potluck I went to this evening.  I was worried how quiche would go over in a crowd but the recipe sounded so tasty and the number of positive reviews was impressive!  I did make a few changes... For one, I don't know how the entire spinach and egg mixtures would have fit into a single 9-inch crust.  I used TWO deep dish crusts and it fit perfectly.  Instead of using mushrooms which I personally don't care for, I used 4 chopped (canned) artichoke hearts.  I also couldn't find the garlic herb feta so I used tomato basil feta.  I also used advice from other reviewers and baked the crusts before filling them for about 10 minutes but I think that was a bit too long, perhaps 7 minutes would have been just right, 5 minutes wasn't long enough.  I was concerned about soggy bottoms!  I also added sliced tomatoes to the top after the initial 15 minute bake time.  I sprinkled the remaining cheese over the tomatoes and baked an additional 35 minutes - perfect!  And BOTH quiches were eaten by the guests at the potluck, always a nice feeling!  :)  I will be making this one again and it's nice that it really is so versatile.

I've been making this quiche for years since I found the recipe on all recipes.com.  Every one I've made it for asks for the recipe.  It is truly delicious.  My children love it.  This is the main reason I love it so much.. I get spinach into them and they love it.

This was delicious! I followed others' suggestions and made two quiches. I also cut the amount of butter and cheese in half and added small chunks of ham. I had some fresh spinach lying around, so I used both fresh and frozen and it turned out great.

Really good, but nothing to right home about.  I did prebake the crust for 12 minutes, but it was still alittle soggy. I think I will use more spinach next time.  I didn't hear any complaints or major compliments from my guests.

This personally is one of my favorite recipes. Make this dish for nearly every potluck I go to or office luncheons. However, I do make changes per suggestions in the reviews. I use less butter than suggested, I add more garlic. Always use feta that that has flavor, never use the plain feta. And I always tend to reduce the egg amount, only because my dish ends up overflowing. All in all, wonderful dish!

This is great because it's so easy to make and so easy to alter to exactly what you want. Plus, you can make it fairly healthy by using egg beaters, fat free half and half, and definitely only need a 1/4 c or less of butter to brown the garlic. Also, I used fresh spinach, fresh mushrooms, and added red peppers, orange peppers, and green onion. If you add just a little extra milk/half and half and egg, you can definitely get 2 pies out of this recipe. Yummy.

So delicious and easy to make low carb by simply omitting the crust.  The only changes I make to the original recipe is reducing the butter to 3 tbsp and substituting sun dried tomatoes for the mushrooms, only because I don't like mushrooms and I like the hint of sweetness the tomatoes add.  Love, love, love this recipe!

This recipe is so good. I took out the eggs, the spinach, the cheese, mushrooms, milk, and butter and added some peanut butter with skittles and Grey Poupon. Just kidding--some people change the WHOLE recipe around! :) Anyways, I added some extra zing with Lipton Golden Onion Soup Mix...it was delicious.

Delicious! I've made this several times and it's always good. I always use fresh mushrooms and substitute other cheeses for the feta (swiss, mont jack, mozzarella). I reduced the butter and it was fine.

I used fresh spinach and mushrooms in this recipe and it turned out very well.  Thank you to DIANECOOKING for the idea to pre-cook the pie crust for a few minutes, this made the crust flaky and light with no soggy patches.

We were having our vegetarian friends over for dinner and this was my first time making quiche so I was a bit nervous but it was wonderful!  Everyone loved it and even went for seconds. I did bake the crust for about 10 minutes before adding the mixture to it and it was not soggy when we cut into it.  I used skim milk and only used about 1 tbls of butter which worked out well.  I would definitely make it again.

I took it to a work get together and it was a big hit.  However, I don't know how deep the pie crusts that other people have used were, but I definitely bought "deep dish" crusts and had enough filler for 2 quiches (quich-i?) rather than just one.

Excellent!  Great taste!  Next time I'll cut down on the butter as suggested by other reviewers (6T).  I used a baking sheet underneath the pie b/c there was some spillage.

This was great, and easy to make! 
I used a pre-packaged pie crust.  I also used fresh mushrooms and spinach. I took the advice of other reviewers and pre-baked my crust a bit to avoid sogginess, which worked.  It turned out delicious and seems much fancier and more difficult than it actually is.  I do agree that there is enough filling for 2 quiches.

Can you say LOVE?  This recipe was fantastic...but oh so rich!  I cut out so many things and it was still so filling and I don't think I missed anything on the flavor side with my substitutes.  I used a small amount of olive oil to sautee the garlic & onions versus the butter.  I also used 1/2 cup fat-free sour cream & 1/2 cup skim milk with the eggs.  I used the full 6 oz of feta (it's one of my favs), but only used 1 cup of 2% cheddar which I just put on top.  Ohhh...and I went crust free...DELISH!

Add Me to the list! I followed some others advice and made 2 pies. I used 1 cup of milk and 6 large eggs and used fresh mushrooms.I messed up and started to put the whole 8 oz pkg of cheddar in and caught myself at about 1/2 the bag  instead of the 1/2 cup. It didn't hurt much thankfully, except I think the pies would have been a touch moister. Since I didn't have the correct remaining amount of cheese to sprinkle on top, I added enough shredded swiss to make up the difference. I liked that and will do that again, probably 1/2 of each. I preheated the oven to 375, baked the shells for 5 minutes before filling them.  I turned the temp down to 325 when I put the filled pies in, baked for 20 minutes, removed and added the cheese and covered the edges with foil, baked for about 10 minutes more til set.  FYI: I also sprinkled a touch of nutmeg in the mixture and also on top after it was baked. I served it with fresh fruit salad. My 7 year old DGD and I liked it served with a dollop of sour cream, DH liked it with hot sauce. And I didn't think the Feta was overpowering at all as some others thought,  But I like Feta!

This was a wonderful recipe!  I just finished serving it to 21 of my nursing home volunteers.  I even liked it and I am a very picky eater.  Several of the volunteers, as well as my BOSS, said that it was the best quiche they had every eaten!  Thanks for making me look so good!!!

This was super-easy to make and even easier to eat! I added artichoke hearts and substituted fresh mushrooms for canned. I also sautéed the mushrooms, onions and artichoke hearts. I only used 3 eggs and a bit less milk than was called for and it was quite yummy. Next time, I will be certain to add jalapenos to give it a bit of a kick, as it was a little calm (notice I did NOT say bland). The men topped it off with hot sauce, but I've never been a fan of salsa with eggs. Still, quite a delicious dish. Mine wasn't mushy or wet at all. A great basic recipe to tinker with.

This is my first quiche & it was ok. I  probably have to make a little adjustments though. This dish was extremely salty because of the feta. Next time I think NO salt is a must. I cooked it with NO butter....Just a little Extra Virgin Olive Oil was fine. I didn't add any salt to the filling but I did add a pinch in the eggs which I shouldn't have because the dish was a little too salty for me. Also, I used a lot less milk than the recipe suggested, with only 3 eggs.

I have made this recipe several times with a few variations and each time it has been excellant. I don't use the half cup of butter. I simply saute the onions in a little bit of oil or maybe some margarine. I also use plain feta. I always get at least two quiches out of this recipe and by adding another 2 eggs and half cup of milk, I can get 2 deep dish quiches. This will continue to be in heavy rotation in my kitchen. Try adding bacon or portabella mushrooms too.

This was our first attempt at quiche and it came out DELICIOUS! We only changed a few things to try and lessen calories/fat. Instead of butter, we used a couple tbsp of olive oil and used reduced fat cheeses. For the last 10 min, we put chopped tomatoes and the cheddar on top. Great addition:) It makes for great leftovers as well. We will definatly make this again. Thank you:)

OH MY GOSH!!  This is so delicious!  I didn't have any feta or cheddar cheese, so i substituted a Mexican blend and it was still scrumptious!!  My husband asked for seconds and we can't wait to eat the leftovers today!  Thanks for this totally awesome recipe!  It's the BEST spinach quiche I have ever had!

I made 2 of these; one as written and one with artichoke hearts instead of mushrooms and tomato and basil feta.  Both were delicious.  I didn't add any salt; as others have noted, the feta is salty enough!   I also followed the advice of other reviewers and cut the butter down to 1 tablespoon.  This is an easy and delicious quiche recipe that I'm adding to my keeper file.

The amount of butter must be a misprint! Only used 1 TBS and that was just fine. I think it is a must to use fresh mushrooms. The amount of milk was way off as well. This should be no more than 1/2 cup. The taste of this is very good. Thanks :-)

Wonderful, EASY recipe. I've made this countless times and it always comes out perfectly. I use fresh mushrooms not canned. (Come on, you just have to!) I also use plain feta or leave it out entirely.

Excellent recipe!  I didn't have enough Feta, so I added some swiss; it was fantastic.  Be sure to use a deep dish pie crust, as the recipe calls for - you'll need it!

Excellent!!! I reduced the butter in 1/2 and used an 8 ounce package of the herbed feta. I used a bag of cheddar/mozzarella as well.  I saute a good handful of fresh mushrooms in garlic and toss them in. This recipe is easy and wonderful!!

Delicious!  I think it should be 1/2 STICK butter not 1/2 CUP - I used one CUP cheddar
cheese - not one 8 oz pkg (which is 2 cups) and reduced the milk to 3/4 cup. Total Cook time reads 40 min. but directions read 15 plus 35-40 min. DEFINITE KEEPER!!!

Excellent. I loved this dish! I made my own crust (frugal) and used my deep dish pie pan and I had plenty of room to spare. In fact the next time I will add more spinach. Instead of butter I used 3T olive oil (heart healthy). Also, I only used 4 oz. of Feta because it was pre-packaged that way. I served this with garden fresh sliced tomatoes---perfecto!

This was excellent, but, boy, is it ever rich!  I think it would make an excellent brunch dish.  I made it for dinner as a side dish and really enjoyed it, but it was very filling on it's own.  I also used a deep-dish pie crust but found that I still had more egg-milk filling than would fit.

This took a while to cook, in part because i kept checking it, cutting a small section in the middle and getting a lot of water come up.  I recommedn that you REALLY let the spinach dry out.  I thought I had squeezed a lot of the water out, but I think it could have used more.  AS long as the top is firm and crusty (with the cheese) your quiche will be done and will REALLY be enjoyed by everyone!
(I used a ready-made pie crust found in the diary section of the grocer's.

This is an excellent recipe.  I too agree that the butter is just way to much.  I would suggest just 3 tablespoons.  I also cut the total amount of Cheddar Cheese down to 1 cup and used fresh mushrooms.  I made this for a baby shower so I adjusted the recipe to fill two 9x13 inch pans and did not use a crust.  I made them the night before and baked them in the morning.  They just needed to be stirred before baking, but baked beautifully.  I got rave reviews at the shower.  This is on my "Must Keep" list.

Both my husband and I agree that this was the best quiche we have ever had!! The flavor was soooo wonderful. I used a homemade crust which I think makes a big difference. I even found the garlic herb feta. What a great recipe Bailey, thanks!

This was the first "quiche" I ever made on my own and it turned out great!  Thank you!  I omitted the herb cheese and just used the whole cup of cheddar cheese.  It was so easy to make and bake.  My whole family loved it.

delicious!  i followed this recipe to the letter and the quiche turned out great, although i had egg and milk mixture left over because it did not all fit in the 9 inch deep dish pie crust i bought.

next time i think i will cut the butter in half and omit the extra salt to taste, since the salt in the cheeses is plenty.

Everyone in the family *loved* this recipe, and took seconds.  I omitted the mushroom, and added extra onion and some fried crumbled bacon instead.  I also reduced the butter and cheese, as other ratings suggested.  It was perfect served with mashed potato pancakes, just an ideal pairing.

This was really wonderful tasting. I added sliced tomatoes over the top (but under the final cheddar cheese) and it complimented the spinach and feta perfectly.  It wasn't soggy the next day like I expected, either.

We loved this recipe!  The feta cheese made the flavor very different from the usual quiche recipes I have tried.  Next time I make it - I'll make the crust instead of buy one for an even more wonderful dish!

it is good, somewhat heavy on the butter, therefore next time i would reduce the butter...and make sure you watch it cook, depending on oven ranges----make sure cheese doesn't burn....

This was a quick and easy recipe.  I also had leftover egg mixture, so I put the rest in a small corning dish and baked it without a crust. Both turned out to be very delicious.

I was shocked that my 4 year old ate this but he did! It was easy and very yummy... a great  way to use up the extra feta at the back of my fridge. Definitely a keeper. I had lots of extra egg/milk mixture when I was done (maybe my crust wasn't big enough) so I made another one!

I made this ahead of time for my large family during Thanksgiving week.  We all made different quiche recipes to feast on for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  This one went the quickest and everyone loved it!  I was only able to get one slice. Good thing I had one in my freezer at home!

First quiche I've made as I'm testing recipes out to feed a small crowd for breakfast. 

I read most reviews and did buy the 9" Deep Dish Pie and just used 2-3 TB of butter. I used 5 eggs and 1 cup milk but had a tad extra so I'd either do 4 eggs or just less milk next time. I used fresh mushrooms and fresh spinach and saute'd them with the garlic and onion in the beginning.  After saute'ing I added to the whisked egg/milk bowl, and then added the feta (regular). Stirred up a bit and added salt/pepper and poured into my pie crust.

I did bake the crust for 6 minutes before pouring my mix in. Baked 15 min then added cheddar and baked final 35 minutes. I didn't cover edges with foil and it came out perfect. Tastes good too! Will keep this recipe! Others have said you can prepare it night before and bake in the morning. I may do that!

This was a delicious and simple recipe!  I followed the advice of some of the other users and used half the amount of butter, baked the pie crust for 7 minutes before adding the filling, used fresh mushrooms and added sun dried tomatoes.  My guests loved it!

Definitely a keeper.  I had to substitute broccoli since I was out of spinach.  Very easy and quick to put together.

Wow I really enjoyed this recipe! As the comments mentioned I only used 1TB of butter but it still came out greasy (must be the cheese). Anyways the Quiche was full of flavor, will def make this again.

I also added Italian seasoning to the Feta...yum!

Honestly I stumbled upon this recipe because I purchased WAY too much fresh spinach at a local bulk retailer.  As you know the recipe calls out for frozen steamed spinach. Easy enough I found a quick easy way to steam the spinach online and I was on my way! (you still gave to squeeze out all the extra liquid). This is delicious! Follow the advice of our predecessors and only use 1 tbsp of butter.  I also adjust the garlic and onions (and a dash of red pepper flakes) to taste. So good!

This recipe definitely needs some alterations.  Next time around I will use 1/2 the butter and milk and add more salt. I added 2 extra eggs and made this into two quiche. May try the gruyere cheese instead of the feta....more flavor.  I also omitted the mushrooms because my family are not fans!

My family loves this quiche. The only thing, is one pie crust is not enough. So, just make two quiches with this recipe, don't change anything, just divide it all in half. Also, I always use graham cracker crust. And I use a red onion, because they are more flavorful than the white onions.

WOW! This is outstanding! I couldn't find the flavored feta, so I just used plain. It still had TONS of flavor! Cut the milk to 3/4. I only used about 2TBL spoons of butter and sautéed fresh spinach (chopped and squeezed to get excess water out)then added fresh mushrooms,garlic and onion. I baked mine for 40 minutes total and it came out perfect. This is a keeper and will make it again and again!

don't you hate it when people change the recipe & then rate it? Well...I was just checking this recipe for proportions before making my spinach quiche. I had a freezer thaw and needed to use up some creamed spinach. I love using it in a quiche...the seasonings & cream sauce work & you don't need much butter or prep. I used one box of creamed spinach, cut the butter back to 2 tablespoons. I prefer swiss cheese & parmesan over cheddar with delicate spinach nutmeg is a must as well a pinch of ground Cheyenne pepper. Add chopped artichokes for variation with thinly sliced tomatoes on the top before baking for color and flavor. Good basic recipe...without all the butter!

This is a great base Quiche recipe.  I cut the butter by half, used  unsweetened almond milk (we are lactose intolerant), omitted the muchrooms, feta added 2oz of turkey; Did not saute garlic and onions. I pre baked the pie shell for 10 minutes and then poured in the mixture to the shell and topped with slices of tomato, more cheddar and a sprinkle of nutmeg. 
My husband said it was one of the best Quiche I've ever made, my boys ate it and asked for 2nds. They NEVER DO! Will continue to use as my new base.

I made a few changes and one major mistake, so it might be my fault that this recipes was delicious but not mind-blowing.  It was almost mind-blowing.  It was . . . mind breezing.  I left out the onion because I'm really not into onion and I left out the garlic and herb feta, because it just sounded kind of gross.  I'm also kind of ishy on spinach, so I pre-cooked the spinach it by sauteing it in a little bit of butter, as per my mother's suggestions.  This was a mistake.  The spinach became way too wet, and I couldn't get the quiche to cook firm.  In spite of that, it tasted very good.  My other issue with this recipe is that there's no way you can fit all of this in one pie crust.  Do like another review recommended: double the recipe and make three pies.  You'll end up eating them all.

So good. This was the first quiche I ever made. It costs between 8 and 10 dollars to make because the feta was $5 and the cheddar was $2. It is VERY rich. But it was so good, that my boyfriend and I couldn't stop eating it. We ate the whole thing, no sides. Because it has so many calories, after this I didn't eat anything else that day. In the future, I will make a salad with it and make sure we ration it out over a few days so as to have a more balanced diet. Sorry to bring attention to it, but this dish is mostly fat. There are lower calorie quiche recipes on this site. Something with less butter and less cheese would be better.

Hi. This turned out fabulous for me. I did make a few adjustments. I made my own crust. I used fresh spinach and cooked it down, fried my onions with it and added 4 medium cloves of garlic at the very end,  so it didn't burn. 
I didn't use mushrooms. I did add a teaspoon of Greek seasoning.
I didn't add any extra butter. Just the olive oil I used to cook the spinach.
I used fat free feta. 
And 2% milk. 
I followed the rest of the directions. 
If you use a 9' deep dish pie pan it will fit perfectly. 
There is even room for extra ingredients if you wish. 
I baked for a total time of 50 mins @ 375° 
Absolutely perfect.

This quiche was easy to make and delicious. My whole family loved it. I cheated and used a crescent roll for my crust. I rolled it to make it thinner.

I made two of these this morning.  Both turned out really well and I had people asking me for the recipe.  I will definitely make again.  Accidentally, I left out the milk - it didn't seem to make a difference.  I will say that if I had added the milk, I think my filling would have overflowed the pie crust.

I made two 9" pies (not deep dish)with this recipe.  I used 12 oz. of fresh spinach, chopped. I also used 1/2 a stick of butter. I didn't have milk but I did have buttermilk.  I omitted the cheddar in the mixture and only sprinkled some on top after 15 minutes.  The quiches turned out very tasty so I froze one for another weekend.

Husband  thought it was just perfect with half the package of spinach. I screwed up somehow and the crust wasn't too crisp on the bottom, but a solid recipe.

My family LOVES this recipe.  It is so easy to make and it tastes delicious.  This is a favorite for Sunday dinners.  I use parmesan cheese instead of feta and I shred whatever cheese I have in the fridge for the cheddar.  Our favorite cheese to use is cooper sharp.  It is delicious.

It's always a happy thing when I find a recipe that the whole family likes, including my vegetarian daughter!  This one is a keeper.  The only adjustments I make is using half the feta, the whole quantity makes it a bit too salty.  Also, when using a frozen deep dish pie shell, there is too much liquid.  I use three eggs and 1/4 c milk.  Be sure to get all the water out of the spinach--I use a strainer and press out the water with a potato masher.  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

I love quiche because it's so versatile. And the ingredients in this recipe work together so well. However I gave it 4 stars because they call for way too much of the milk/eggs mixture. If you use the whole thing you end up with the mixture dripping all over your stove. I use HALF the mixture (2 eggs & 1/2 cup of milk) to make my quiche and it comes out great!

Very rich and tasty.  Probably because of the butter which many reviewers have suggested could be cut way down. I sauté fresh mushrooms and fresh spinach with the onions and garlic and add a few bacon bits.
Recipe makes more filling than what will fit in a single pie crust and it is very important not to let the filling overflow.   I usually cut the butter and milk in half and I use a separate baking dish to make a crustless quiche out of the extra filling and egg mixture.

Made this for Mother's Day and it was a huge hit! I substituted olive oil for the butter, as most people seemed to have done. I also cut the cheddar and the feta a bit. I added half a red bell pepper and chopped artichoke hearts. It was so freaking delicious. I also took someone's advice and pre cooked the crust for about 6 minutes prior to pouring the mixture into it to avoid sogginess. Good stuff.

This sounded great becasue my son-in-law is a vegetarian and this recipe had no meat.  I did have to make some substitutions so I apologize that this review isn't for the recipe as shown.  1.  My family doesn't like mushrooms so substituted a drained-and-dried can of artichoke hearts.  2.  My grocery store didn't have the herb and garlic feta so I used sun-dried tomato and basil feta.  3. I personally am not fond of Cheddar cheese so I substituted a 3-cheese "pizza" mixture.  4.  I cut the butter down to 2 T.   5.  I added about 1/3-1/2 c. of toasted pine nuts.  BUT - after all that! - this was AMAZING!!  I used a 10" deep-dish pan, and it was just right for this recipe.  I waited until the last 10 minutes to sprinkle the rest of the cheese on.  I made my own crust using lard -- I know that's not a healthy thing to use, but there's just nothing like it for making pie crusts!  Anyway, the crust held up perfectly after being cut and the filling didn't fall apart at all.  And it didn't look ANYTHING like the picture on this page - much prettier!  And soooo yummy.  I'm going to make it for our church's Easter potluck on Sunday!

Turned out well- but here's a few changes I've made: 1/2 cup of butter was just nutritionally irresponsible as is using frozen Spinach, when fresh is available. I used 1/4 cup of butter & that was more than enough. The recipe made enough for 2 quiches, BTW. And forget about using a "medium" saucepan ! Use the biggest one that you can get your hands on...

The recipe made so much that I had to use two pie crusts (not deep dish). It was really tasty and didn't last long at my house.

I love quiche because you can add whatever ingredients you prefer. I always layer my meat, cheese, and spinach in the empty pie crust then pour the milk mixture on top, this way the ingredients are evenly distributed and you get some of everything in each bite! Also give you quiche time to set after cooking or it will be runny.

Super Good! Super Easy! I have followed the recipe as is and have experimented with different ingredients. It's always good. FYI...when i use fresh ingredients i usually have to split the filling between two pie crusts. Also if your not a huge fan of feta, still give this recipe a try. When it is baked it changes flavor...yuummmmm

I used 1/2 the amount of butter as suggested and substituted fat free 1/2 and 1/2 for the milk.Didn't have mushrooms so I just left it out.Also, after mixing the liquids ,I just added the spinach mix to the bowl ,mixed well and dumped the whole thing into a well buttered glass pie plate. baked as directed.Fantastic!
no soggy crust for the leftovers!

Cutting down the butter to 2 TBS with a little bit of olive oil worked great for me.  It made 2 quiches for me but I had to add 2 more eggs.  My family absolutely loved this!

My comfort food is quiche and when I have a rough day, it is what I crave.  Just the smell of this quiche cooking is enough to make me smile.  Like other reviewers, I also reduced the amount of butter.  I used a cream cheese instead of feta (feta is hard to find where I live in the world) and it was delicious.  I also made my own pastry as pre-packaged pie crust is not an option here either. It may have been my gas powered stove that increased the cooking time as my took longer than an hour to cook properly.  I cut out the  mushrooms and added red pepper for color.  The end product was delicious and I know I will make it again.

I made this recipe for a large event of 160 people.  I scaled it up to 160 servings.  I also put the quiche in small mini 3 " pie crust to make individual servings.  You do need to prebake your crust a bit to prevent the bottom from being soggy.  Serve this with a mixed green salad with blue cheese, pancetta, cukes, and craisins.  Its a complete meal and a huge hit! R Weaver

This is an awesome recipe. The only thing I changed was I omitted the mushrooms and used sliced black olives instead (that's all I had in the cupboard). It worked well because the feta cheese and black olives really complimented each other. Oh, and I mixed the egg mixture with the spinach mix, then poured the combination into the pie crust instead of pouring the egg over the spinach. My picky daughter who only eats white food even liked this recipe. And I didn't even have to blindfold her first. What's that tell ya?

I only gave this recipe a 4 because of the amount of butter it calls for. I use half the butter and fat  free cheddar cheese. I've made this recipe BOTH ways, and my boyfriend and I both prefer it with less butter and fat free cheese. It's too greasy the other way. That said, this is my GO TO quiche recipe!

First time making quiche - it was so easy and great!  I had one problem, which was that I could only find pie crusts that were for pies, and the plainest one I found was a vanilla wafer one.  So the quiche uh, had an unexpected sweet undertone, which was not bad!  I'm sure it's better with a plainer crust but if you're ever in a pinch or are looking to try something different, vanilla wafer pie crust is not too bad at all.

This is definitely a keeper! Thank you for sharing. Might try a "lighter" heart healthy version next time but definitely delish as is. I did mix the egg/milk mixture into the spinach mixture by mixing it up a bit with a fork after pouring it in.

This taste great.  It's one of the recipes people ask for and I'm reluctant to give cause then they'll know how easy it was.    Yes it's too much filling and egg for one quiche but what I do is make all the filling, put it in the crust and then just pour egg or egg beater on top til it's covered but not pouring over the sides.   Easy peezy

I agree with some of the comments here. The ingredients were too much. And I think the quiche was a bit too salty (too much fetta). Otherwise, good stuff.

I used the same measurements that were outlined in the original recipe with just a couple modifications to ingredients and directions.  Excluded feta cheese (we aren't fans), and mixed up the spinach mixture with the eggs. I opted to use a deep casserole dish rather than a deep dish pie pan and I think that's the main issue everyone is having with the measurements.  It turned out great! Still can't believe it only took 4 eggs!

Disaster. I wish I had read the other reviews before using this recipe. I doubled this recipe to make 2 quiches. Proportions were way off, ended up with way too much filling and way too much egg/milk mixture. The eggs and milk spilled over the quiches and I still had extra left over.

I have made this several times and it is amazing.  You can vary the recipe a little bit - I do.  I use it sometimes with different types of cheese or add crumbled bacon.  But it's delicious believe me.

Very simple.  Easily a five star meal if you jazz it up. I used abt 1 Tbsp evo instead of butter.  I added some herbs to the veg like oregano and thyme, then a dash of nutmeg and garlic salt to the egg.  Remember that you can cram the pie shell pretty full of toppings because the egg will fill into the crannies, and also that quiche doesn't rise so you can fil the crust to the top.  This yields a chunky, satisfying meal.  I always make twomwith different toppings (try bacon, onion, cheddar).  I am vegetarian and the veggie bacon by morningstar works great in here.

This is a delicious recipe, easily adaptable & forgiving.  I did not measure the ingredients, used a small can of sliced black olives instead of the mushrooms, cut back on the butter, only used 3 eggs & 1/2 cup of milk.  So yummy I have eaten it for breakfast, lunch & dinner today!

This was terrific! Like other reviewers, I baked the crust slightly first. Only used enough butter to saute the veggies. Used fresh mushrooms and only about half the cheddar called for. A huge hit for brunch with friends.

WOW!!  This recipe was outstanding!!  Not the healthiest choice but really tasty!  Both my husband and I gave this one 5 stars!  I made this for a family with a new baby and modified the recipe (removed the garlic and feta) as the family has allergy restrictions.  Made a second quiche for my family and elected to leave out the feta.  After having cooked two on the same day I would tweak a few things next time.  On one quiche, I followed the recipe suggestions for butter and cheese.  That one turned out a bit greasy looking.  For the second quiche, I used less butter (just enough to cook the onions and mushrooms).  I also used about 5 oz. of cheese.  I did mix some in my mixture and only added enough on top to cover everything.  That one looked much better, had less fat and tasted amazing!  A must try meal!

This is one of the best things I've ever eaten! I have made it at least 5 times so far and have a few comments. I couldn't find any herb and garlic feta at the store, so I used plain and instead substituted marinated artichoke hearts for mushrooms. The flavor balances out perfectly. Also, I have made it with the 8 tbs of butter, 4 tbs, and 2 tbs, and I have to say it is most delicious at 4 tbs. As far as the egg and milk portion of the recipe goes, it is a little too much. I use 3 eggs and 3/4 cup of milk for this, and it fits perfectly.

I never thought it would be so easy to make such a YUMMY quiche! Everyone had seconds and my daughter kept talking about how good it was! I used only 1tbs butter and only about 5 ounces cheddar.  No need to salt this as the feta provides enough of that.  This recipe filled the pie crust to the tippy top and I had to be careful not to spill it, but I think it was the perfect amount.  LOVE this!!

very good and very easy.  i used 1/2 the butter that the recipe called for and next time i make it i will use 1/4 as it was still very buttery.  You just need enough butter to brown the onions.  Definitely making this again.

I misread the recipe by not including the crust, i sprayed the bottom with cooking spray and baked as directed.  It turned out great! Next time I might slice some tomato's on top for extra flavor and color.

A fabulous & tasty recipe!!
My variation: I used fresh spinach (1 lg bundle) and mushrooms (about 8 medium, sliced and chopped). I added these after the onions & garlic were lightly browned to wilt. Because the fresh veggies add moisture, you must drain about 1/3 of the liquid. Then add the seasoned feta & cheddar. Then follow the recipe from there
I also added some chopped, smoked ham (about ½ cup) when all was blended. The prep for this took a bit longer but was well worth it!! 
This was an exciting change from the “norm” and my family loved it!!

This quiche was amazing!!  I took most of the reviews in to consideration, ie: less butter, less milk, making ahead of time, and it was pure perfection!  I did leave out the mushrooms, I didn't have any on hand.  I highly recommend this recipe!

This was amazing!! I used fresh spinach and mushrooms, and regular feta. (preference)
I made this for my folks this morning. My husband doesn't even eat quiche, and he really liked it too! This is a keeper. I'm eating the leftovers for dinner.

excellent!  
used a frozen pie crust that was shallow so I did 3 eggs, .25 c milk, 6 oz feta and a handful of shredded cheddar.  Sauteed fresh spinach from my garden in 1 T olive oil along with about .33 c onions, 2 t garlic.  Salt/pepper/red pepper flakes (last is key).  GREAT!!!   -zh

Awesome!  Few changes... added diced ham, used only 1.5 Tbs of butter and used mostly egg whites.  I also used 2 greased 8 inch pie pans without the crust and baked at 350 for 20 min.  covered for the first 10 minutes.  It was amazing!!!!

I have been making this quiche for several years now and it is fabulous!  I use fresh mushrooms and spinach.  For the fresh spinach, I just kind of eye ball the 10 oz from the number of oz in my package (it cooks way down if you've never used fresh spinach before).  I always end up with extras as well, so I just put it into a separate smaller baking dish.  Even without the crust, it is excellent!

This recipe is AWESOME!  I made it for Easter and everyone LOVED IT.  I will say, though, as other reviewers have, that the amount of butter called for is atrocious and could probably be cut in half and still be excellent.  Definitely give it a shot!

Incredible. I usually hate things without meat, and was skeptical...but this is INCREDIBLE.

A wonderful taste combo. I also used less butter with splash of olive oil and no salt.

I loved it!!  I was skeptical how it would turn out.. it seemed like a big mass of spinach at first, but the end result was very pleasing.  I made a few variations -- I put a few slices of fried crumbled bacon in the bottom the pie shell and I used half mozzarella and half cheddar instead of all cheddar. I will definitely be making it again!

This was very, very good. I had enough batter to make 2 9" pies (not deep dish). Will definitely make this again.

this turned out terrific!  My local grocery store didn't have a deep dish pie crust so i divided the ingredients between 2 regular frozen pie crusts and it worked beautifully---thanks!

Found the cheese salty enough and so I definitely don't add any additional salt.  Also I add fresh mushrooms which I saute first and drain.  Other than that I follow the recipe as is and it is fantastic!!

Very good flavor with the feta cheese. It worked well with both a traditional crust and also with a mashed potato crust. Fresh mushrooms worked fine. I had a much larger amount of spinach so I made the same filling recipe as a crustless spinach quiche which turned out well too.

This was the best tasting quiche I've had in a long time. There was plenty of flavor and the cheese baked to a nice crust on top. This reminded me a little of Greek Spanikopita, which is delicious.

This is a great basic recipe with a few renditions. I def cut down the butter...if that was really what you needed I just could not make this dish no matter how delicious it is lol. I used fresh spinach and fresh mushrooms and the onion. Also kept the feta which gave it such an exquisite flavor but skipped the cheddar cheese all together. I was able to make two quiches with all of that so I doubled the eggs and kept the milk the same amount. Turned out FABULOUS.  Can't wait to make it again!

Delicious!!! I have made this a few times for friends and family, everyone has loved it. Made exactly as the recipe reads and have had to pour into two pie shells one deep dish is not big enough.  It is a rich recipe with all the butter but absolutely delicious. The only change I have made is to use a homemade pie crust - which makes it even better. Thanks for a great recipe!!

I used Paula Deen's Pie Crust recipe and dry baked it before putting in the filling so the crust was crispy instead of soggy.  I did not use any butter (don't need it); no mushrooms (don't like them); no feta (didn't have it); use half and half or heavy cream instead of milk for a more custardy quiche and the secret to a great custard is to add a small amout of nutmeg :)

I'm giving 5 stars b/c for a quiche, this is excellent & quite easy.  Quiche is usually not my thing, but I actually liked this one.  Next time I think I will leave the mushrooms out... although I usually like mushrooms, they just didn't fit this dish.  I cut back on the butter as others suggested & otherwise followed as directed.  There was a little extra, so I just baked it in another pan without a crust.  Turned out great!

I LOVED this! So, so yummy. The only adjustment I made was the with the pie crust, I made mine with 2 cups of cooked brown rice and 1 egg white (bake for 10 min prior to filling and cooking) for a much healthier crust. The feta makes it!!!

This quiche was delicious!!  It was really good even though I used just a bit of Canola oil- fresh mushrooms and plain feta with my own herbs.  I had to double the egg mixture and leave the spinach mixture as is - and got 2 quiches.  If you like quiche- this is great!!

Very new to cooking, but followed the directions as listed. Was very oily but still delicious. Definitely too much spinach for a single crust along with eggs and milk. As other reviewers stated, could have probably seperated out into two quiches. However, great recipe.

This was wonderful. I've made it twice now. It is also excellent the next day. I made one adjustment the second time; I only used 3/4 cup milk. When using 1 cup of milk, it was running over the side of a deep dish crust. I used the tomato-basil feta the second time also since the grocery store was out of the herb and garlic--it was just as tasty! Thank you for my now favorite breakfast or dinner meal!

This was my first attempt at making quiche-- it turned out perfect with some minor adjustments... I used some of the other reviews to modify the original recipe: I used the recommended amounts of spinach, cheese (along with the feta and cheddar, I added a pepper jack to the mix) and mushrooms (fresh) but divided them into two even portions. 8 eggs and only 1/2 cup of milk (1/4 for each) was used for each quiche. This recipe is so easy and you can play with different ingredients. Next time I will use fresh spinach instead of the frozen and will add meat. Oh, and you really don't need 1/2 cup butter. I'd cut that by at least half for each quiche.

Love this quiche, but there was probably waaaaay too much butter. Next time I would cut it down to about 1/4 stick and you wouldn't miss it. I also used most of a bag of fresh spinach and fresh mushrooms so it took two deep-dish crusts this was an awesome dish and I would definitly recomend it!

I made some changes - basically a new recipie, but the spinach feta combo here is genius. Decreased butter to 3/4 stick, used fat free feta, which had no herbs so I used one extra garlic clove, oregano and thyme. added no salt as chese had enough. used 4 eggs plus 2 yolks, reduced milk to 3/4 cup and added 1 TB of sour cream. I used low fat muenster & mozarella instead of the cheddar. it made extra filling, so cut out circles of puff pastry and made little pie crusts by pushing the puff pastry circles into the muffin pan and I filled with the mix. even better than the pie dough with puff pastry.

This turned out very well. Easy and quite good. I used fresh mushrooms that I sauted in a little butter before adding to the other ingredients. Thanks Bailey for the recipe.

This was a delicious quiche, I have made a lot of quiche recipes, but I especially enjoyed the moist consistency this recipe produced. I give it four stars since I made some modifications based on the ingredients I had on hand. I used Monterey Jack Cheese, omitted the feta and mushrooms since I was out. I also added some chopped ham and fresh minced garlic to taste. Everyone loved it, even the picky 8 year old.

Excellent Recipe!!  I changed it up a little and instead of the canned mushrooms i used Fresh Mushrooms and sauteed them in a little butter.  I also added a little bit of green & red pepper diced up & it added great flavor!  Also, for the cup of Milk i used half Heavy Cream and half Skim (becasue i didn't have reg milk) and it came out excellent!  I will make it again!!  Thank You!

This recipe was wonderful!  I made this quiche for a friend who was visiting and is vegetarian.  Much to my surprise and delight, the rest of my family raved about it as well!  I ended up sharing the recipe with my friend and am looking forward to making it again.  I almost always make recipes exactly as they are written when trying them for the first time.  However, I agree with others here that there is too much butter.  I ended up scooping half of it out of my saute pan before continuing onwards.  Next time I'll start with just 1T and add more as seems necessary.  I also substituted regular feta for the garlic and herb variety (my store doesn't carry it).

Five stars with these changes... Use only half the butter. Chopped up a package of bacon and drained thoroughly. Just used regular feta... that is what I had but with the bacon, onion, garlic and cheeses it needed no other spices except some ground pepper. Divided filling in half and mixed with six eggs and milk each then put into two pie crusts... was fabulous left over as well! Thanks for the great recipe!

My favorite Quiche recipe.  Works great with any filling. I omit the feta and divide the mix between two frozen crusts (Marie Callendar's is the best!)

Very good!  I only used 1/4 cup of butter, and I used fresh mushrooms.  Next time, I will probably use less butter, and I will use less feta cheese and mozzarella!  YUM!  Previous reviews about the portion size are correct... The "filling" will make 2 quiches, and then use 4 eggs + 1 cup milk for each quiche.  Very good.

Of the three quiches I made for Mother's Day brunch, this was the one everyone raved about.  I only used 1/2 the onion, but followed the remainder of the recipe to the letter.  It was so flavorful!  Great recipe ... thanks!

My first quiche ever came out perfect!  I made an addition to this recipe, I fried up some bacon and threw that on top of the quiche and covered that with cheese and then threw it back in the oven for another 10 minutes.  Bacon and cheese makes everything taste better!  The recipe yielded two pies.  I happily froze one to enjoy on another day.

This quiche turned out beautifully.  Thanks to those who submitted photos, I used the idea of placing sliced tomatos on top.....a super nice touch!  I slimmed this down some by using 1/2 egg beaters, reduced fat cheeses, and much less butter.  Also used fresh mushrooms.  The feta cheese is a must and really added to the flavor.

This is delicious. I followed the recipe exactly. I made a homemade crust, baked for about 5 minutes before putting in the filling. I used a 9.5 inch deep dish pie plate and everything fit just right. This is good enough for company- I will make this the next time that I host a brunch. Plus will add it to my family's normal meal rotation- even my 2 year old ate it!

I made this as a low-fat version (no butter, skim milk, egg whites, reduced-fat cheeses) and it was still phenominal!  Just make sure you either use a deep dish pie pan or half the recipe for a normal one.  This puffs up quite a bit!

This is absolutely delicious.  I'd never made quiche before and tried this recipe for a dinner party and it was a hit!  Though, as I was making it, I realized I had enough of the filling to nearly make two quiches, so I added the rest of the 12oz pkg of spinach I'd purchased and went for it, which meant sending the extra pie home with two very happy dinner guests~!  Next time i will try my mom's suggestion and brush the pie crust with egg white then bake it for about 5 minutes before filling.

I used 2 pie crusts, spread them out and put them in a 8x8 glass dish and substituted egg beaters for eggs and used lowfat herbed feta cheese and lowfat cheddar cheese.  Did not use all of the cheddar chese as recommended.  This was awesome.  Excellent dish for lent !  Will definately make it again and again.

As mentioned before the recipe only calls for 1 pie crust, but this recipe definitely makes enough for 2 quiches.  We only had one because its just me and my husband.  If we had kids, we would have made 2.  My husband and I both loved it, which says a lot for him because he normally hates quiche. :-) Great quiche recipe!

Tasty.  Not too hard to make.  Only used 3 eggs but probably should've reduced the milk too because it took a while to solidify in the oven.  Used a 6oz. bag of fresh spinach.  Added cheese after 30 minutes in oven, but still took a while to solidify.

As is, this recipe is way too greasy.  There is no need for 1\2 cup of butter. It is a wonderful recipe with the healthy changes I made:  I completely omitted the butter, used low fat feta cheese, and fresh mushrooms, I also cut down the cheddar cheese considerably.  I loved the flavor and it was even better the second day.

This was really good! Of course I made a few changes b/c of what others wrote. I bought fresh spinach and chopped it up and put it in the microwave for 30 seconds which was more than enough. Then I sauteed fresh mushrooms with the garlic and the onions. Instead of the Feta cheese I used Mexican mozzarella actually made from Mexico (My relatives had just come from Mexico and they like bringing us cheese. It tastes different than the mozzarella you find in the store. I feel it taste much better). Oh I forgot to mention that I skipped on the butter and used olive oil. I also skipped the salt since the Mexican mozzarella is salty enough. In the egg and milk mix I only used two eggs and put what I thought would fit in the pie of milk. Also did not need the indicated time of cooking. Took it out when I saw it was set. My family loved it!! Even my father who doesnt really like food that isnt Mexican loved it! Thanks for sharing!

I just can't even begin to express how much I loved this recipe. I really would give it 10 stars if I could.  I used fresh mushrooms, half the butter, made it crustless and split it between two pans, cooked at 30 minutes.  Loved it!  Eating it now for leftover breakfast :)

You got to admire a recipe that's not scared to use a whole stick of butter but alas, it is not necessary.  Per other reviews I too cut the butter to about 3 table spoons combined with a little EVOO.  Also prebaked the crust for about 6 minutes.  Turned out great and will make again.

This is so tasty!  My picky husband loved it.  It's super easy to make, too.  I passed on the pie crust because I forgot to buy one and will leave that out all the time.  The herb and garlic feta really "made" this!

This was a delicious recipe!  I followed the advice of another reviewer and made 2 quiches instead of 1 (using the same amount of filling) and it worked beautifully.  I can't see putting all of the filling into only 1 crust as there was way too much!  One could even add a 1/4 cup more milk, 1 more egg and increase the onion and spinach by 1/4 cup each and the amount would be perfect for 2 even deeper dish quiches.  Very yummy!

I always get rave reviews when I make this. Essentially you can just use 4 eggs, some milk, cream, or half and half and then add whatever you like. It seems to taste best when you saute the spices, herbs, and onions first.

Quiche was easy & delicious.  I only used one TBS. butter...couldn't image needing more.  I used goat cheese & Monterey jack.  I added two additional eggs to fill 2 deep dish shells.  My husband couldn't stop eating it.

Yum - yum -yum. Great recipe... did not use as much butter as it said but turned out great.  I'm making it again this weekend, I'm adding different ingredients this time but I think if you stick with the base of this recipe you can't go wrong with whatever you add to it.

I love to cook healthy....so like other have done.....I used olive oil instead of butter about 2 tbls.  added broccoli ,used 3 egg whites  and 1 whole egg and used 3/4 cup skim milk and I also cooked the pie crust a few minutes before. My secret is I lined the bottom of the crust with thin from the deli sliced swiss cheese! The crust stays flakey not soggy!  Then I added part-skim mozzerella and low fat cheddar to the mixture. I got so many compliments at dinner!!! NO one even thought it was a healthy version!!

My friend sent me the link to this recipe and it is seriously one of the best things I have ever eaten.  I am on Weight Watchers, so I changed a bunch to make it much healthier (no butter, just used cooking spray/halved the feta/used fat free milk/used 2 eggs and 2 egg whites/used only 1 cup of reduced fat cheddar, mixed in, and none on top).  I also used fresh mushrooms and sauteed/deglazed the onion and garlic pan with the liquids they released.  I will split up the filling next time into two crusts.  I made it again tonight and didn't have any pie crust, but I DID have some leftover roasted red potatoes from last night's dinner, so I mixed the potatoes in with the filling and poured the egg mixture over all of it.  Wonderful recipe and SO SO easy to customize.  Thanks!

I've never been a big fan of quiche, but this simple, very forgiving and adaptable recipe changed that. You can't go wrong with this one. It's a new favorite in our house.... even the wife loves it. Second time around I put in some Canadian bacon which was great too! Substituted egg for egg beaters on subsequent times. Quality and taste was just as good as original.

This is a great quiche recipe - a base which I'll use in the future for other variations.  Next time I will be sure to bake the pie crust for 5-7 minutes as recommended by other reviewers because I did find the sogginess to be a disappointment.  I used a refrigerated Pillsbury pie crust and a pie dish that I don't consider to be particularly "deep dish" - however, I found that I did not have "too much" of the mixture as other reviewers have reported.  I did only use 1/2 cup of the milk - maybe that made the difference.  I also used swiss cheese instead of the cheddar - next time I will use the cheddar - I think, particularly a sharper version, would have packed a nice punch.  Omitted the mushrooms because don't love them and used a 10 oz. bag of fresh spinach in place of frozen.  I cooked down the spinach in 1 Tbsp. of olive oil.  I recommend tearing fresh spinach into smaller pieces for anyone going that route....I also used olive oil in place of butter to saute the garlic and onion - again, only 1 Tbsp.  Next time I will use butter for this step in place of the olive oil (but probably only up to 2 Tbsps) - I imagine it adds a nice richness.  I covered the edges of the pie crust with foil before baking to avoid over-browning.  Thanks!

I really liked it! I skipped the mushrooms and used feta with sun-dried tomatoes. I also used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk. Came out really delicious!

This was an awesome recipe! I followed another reviewer's advice and made this into 2 quiches, using the same amount of spinach/cheese mixture, but doubling the egg mixture. I also decreased the butter to 1/4c and baked my crust for 5 minutes before putting the mixture into the crust.  Will make again and again..I loved it!

Excellet spinach quiche. My husband loves this and asks for it once or twice a month. I wouldn't change a thing. I've made it with & w/o mushrooms because I didn't have them. Either way it's good. The quich with a side dish of mint couscous is a great lite dinner.

This was a great recipe!  I only used a tablespoon of butter and  sauteed fresh baby portobello mushrooms with the garlic.  I left out the onion (I don't like them) and used plain feta because that's what I had.  It was delicious!

This is the best quiche I ever made! I used plain feta and added about 1 tsp of italian seasoning and I also added some ham. There was plenty of filling to make two deep dish quiches. This is definitely going in my recipe box!
I have done this quiche many times since. Tried it with fresh mushroms (cooked them with the onions and garlic). Tried it with broccoli instead of spinach... not matter what you put in it, it always turns out great. I cut the amount of butter by half, it doesn't need that much! And I bake my crust for 5-10 min. before putting the mixture in, so the bottom doesn't get soggy. There's also enough to make 2 quiches... Great fool proof recipe!

Fabulous!  Even better on day 2.  I used a pack of portabella mushrooms because I had no canned and I made 1 1/2 times the recipe with 2 crusts.  This really filled them up with the mushroom addition.  I also used plain feta cheese, but it was still amazing.  I shared with my 2 friends and my family and got thumbs up all around, and my family is hard to please!  I am going to try this as mini quiche appetizers for a Christmas party.  Really good!

I have been making this for years and finally got around to a review.  I use regular feta as I think the herb over powers the other flavors!  Great recipe, thanks!

This is a great recipe, for sure.  4 eggs and 1 c. milk is a little too watery for my taste, and makes too much egg mixture for one quiche, but not enough for two.  The best thing to do (as previously mentioned) is to stick with the same amount of onion/garlic/spinach/cheeses, but when it comes to the egg mixture, use six (large) eggs, and 1 c. cream.  Divide half the spinach mixture between two pie crusts, and pour the egg mixture over that.  Make sure you blend the egg and spinach mix a little bit, I recommend using a fork to "fluff up" the spinach mixture, as it is very solid, and allow the egg mixture to infiltrate the bottom layer of spinach.  Don't worry too much about blending, though.  The quiche tastes great even if the spinach layer is a little thick on the bottom.  As for pre-baking the pie crusts before adding the ingredients, I did that the first time I made this quiche.  The crust was overly browned by the time the quiche had finished baking.  I prefer to just let the pie crusts thaw to room temp, and add the ingredients, then bake as directed.  Would've given this recipe 5 stars, but it did need a few alterations.

Wow!  This quiche is fantastic!  I used only 3 T. of butter after reading some other reviews, and it turned out great, although I couldn't use all the egg mixture because it overflowed the crust.  My daughter looked at her plate, said, "I don't like spinach," and then proceeded to eat the whole thing.  The whole family loved it.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Made the recipe exactly as written and was very happy with the results. It was very rich and was more of a dinner meal then breakfast.  In the future I'll scale back the butter to make it a bit more healthy.

Four stars 'cause it should be tweaked, but this is crazy delicious. No butter whatsoever, half of the cheddar cheese, and garlic powder with fresh spinach. I feel really spoiled being able to eat this made from my own hands and not bought in an expensive shop.

I used 1/4lb of fresh spinach and 1/4lb of fresh mushrooms (that's what I had)and put all the cheddar in at once. For my store bought crusts, this was too much spinach filling for one quiche so I made two. (Though I added 2 eggs and 1/2 cup milk to make enough of the egg mixture.) Came out beautiful and tasted fantastic - thank you for the recipe! (Note: it was very buttery, which is delicious but not so healthy. I suspect I could have used a less - maybe even half - and still had nice quiches.)

Absolutely delicious!  I followed the recipe pretty closely.  I was concerned about the butter content since everyone seemed to have had problems with it, but mine turned out perfectly.  I only made one significant alteration, that being the substitution of 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream for the 1 cup of milk.  I like a richer texture in my quiches which the cream seems to provide.  I also used the sun-dried tomato/basil feta.  Definitely a new staple in my repertoire.

I have tried MANY quiche recipes but this was by far the best.  I used tomato basil feta and I only added 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese total to keep the fat content down.  I actually added 8 eggs and 1/2 cup extra milk and it filled two pie crusts.

I have made this about a dozen times over the last year at least, maybe more. I always get rave reviews. The only change I have ever made was that I use regular plain feta instead of the flavored one, it really lets the mushroom and spinach shine through. Yes, this recipe is so forgiving, I think you could add just about anything and it would be great. Really a 5 star recipe. Quick and easy too!

The whole family liked this.  Served with a fruit salad and some crusty bread.  When I make it again I will only use 3 eggs and maybe 1/2-3/4 cup of milk as I couldnt fit it all in the deep dish pie shell.

Oh my.
First of all I will say that I should have read the "reduce the butter" reviews prior to making this.  So my heart is not thanking me right now, but my tummy is soooo happy. :)
The bf was quite wary of the intense amount of spinach in this, but it is just so dang tasty that he didn't mind at all, and even said that the flavors balance out so well that it's delicious.  
I left out the mushrooms (don't like them) and used regular feta, couldn't find a deep-dish crust so some of my egg got left out, but it is PERFECT.  Oh my.  I'm going to have some for lunch, like, right now :)

I made this dish as directed. I sauteed fresh mushrooms and spinach with the onions and garlic.  I made this dish for a large group at work. This was beyond a great hit. I made three quiche so I added two more eggs to the mixture and a little more milk. My other two quiche I added cooked bacon, ham and maple sausage to them. All of them were a hit. I will definitely keep this recipe in my recipe box.

Changed just a little. Used the qucihe dish recipe from my sister (from the 1970's). - called for 2 cups  heavy whipping cream,12 strips of crumpled bacon, 1/4 tps sugar, otherwise recipe the same.  I precooked for 8 minutes the pie crust.  Did not have feta cheese so had to use just chedder. Turned out great.   Next time will try less whipping cream and use more cheeses.

Wonderful!  I have made this for my family several times, and there are NEVER any leftovers!  I always end up with more egg/milk mixture than I can fit into the crust, but it doesn't affect the end product.  It's delicious!

One of the best quiches I've ever eaten!  I made it exactly as the recipe stated the first few times and it was fabulous.  The next few times, I have not been able to find the herbed feta.  It's still good, but the herbed feta makes it wonderful.  Thank you!

This is one of my favorite quiche recipes!  I also make the recipe as an appetizer by preparing the filling and egg mixture and adding it to thawed frozen Phyllo cups and baking according to phyllo package instructions. I brought them to a party and everyone raved about them!

This was the first quiche that I have ever made, and it was so easy! The spinach quiche is so delicious and will be making this again.. I do, however, think that 4 eggs is a bit too much. I couldnt not use all the milk and eggs when mixing the ingrediants together. I would suggest cutting both down.  Perhaps 1/2 cup of milk and 3 eggs.

Really easy recipe. I'll definitely make it again. I used 5 eggs and 1/2c milk as another reviewer suggested and it came out great. Next time, I'll bake my frozen pre-made pie shells a little ahead of time as the bottom came out a bit mushy. Also, when I stir fried the mushrooms, onions, garlic and cheese together, there was a bit of juice at the bottom. Next time I'll also drain it a bit, so there's less liquid in the pie before I bake. I too also had more than enough for one pie, so I made two! I tried cooking one for 40min before putting in the cheese and then the other I put the cheese in just after 15min of cooking, and both came out exactly the same!

I just ate the leftovers for lunch--it is even better today!  I did make a few changes, per other reviews.  Only used 1 1/2 T. butter.  Used fresh spinach & mushrooms.  Used a 4 oz container of Sundried tomato/basil feta (all I could get) & more like 6 oz cheddar (still plenty).  Only used about 1/2 c. milk.  I also added tomato slices on top of the spinach layer.  Great quiche!

Ah! This was so amazing- even though I doctored the recipe a little. I omitted the mushrooms, substituted parmesan for the feta, used 4 ounces of the cheddar and another 4 ounces of swiss cheese, and also crumbled bacon on the layer just above the spinach. I know it sounds like I changed a lot, but it wasn't really that much :P But it tasted absolutely FANTASTIC. I will most definitely be making it again soon- though maybe next time I'll stick to either just cheddar, or swiss, not both. It might be easier that way.

This dish was good. The only modifications I made was that I used only half the egg and milk because I was afraid that it would run over. Also, I only used half the mushrooms because I don't like them and 1 tablespoon of butter.

I have been making this recipe for over a year and am just now reviewing. It is absolutely my favorite quiche recipe! I leave out the mushrooms (my household doesn't like them) and I use fresh washed and dried spinach. I use a couple of large handfuls of spinach. Great recipe! If you haven't tried it. TRY IT!!!!

The flavor was pretty good- I had a problem fitting the egg mixture into the pan.  I ended up not using about 3 oz. of the egg/milk mixture and the quiche still ran all over the cookie sheet it was placed upon. I even used a deep dish pie crust. If I do make it again I would cut back on the milk. Oh, and I also cut way back on the butter. I saw no need to use an entire stick of butter in this!

Excellent flavor - make sure to make/buy a big enough pie crust as the store-bought deep-dish one I used was too small.

Original recipe is super yummy and rich. To lighten it up a bit, I reduced the butter to 3T, used buttermilk instead of milk, and 2 whole eggs and 2 egg whites. Can't tell the difference with taste.

My hubby said "I didn't know you could make quiche!" and he used to be a chef in a fancy hotel in California!  So 5 stars for this easy yummy quiche.  I used canned spinach cuz that's what I had and a variety of cheese substitutes.  Oh yeah, and a little bacon and cut the butter to 3 tbs.  My kids could not get enough, I'm making it again tonight.

This was soo tasty. I used a cup of fresh parmesan instead of the fetta and I added some ham. The whole family loved it! Also, I used a little olive oil in place of the butter. I also found it better to bake the pie crust for about 10 min before pouring the mixture in.

very very good.  i did have a problem pouring the egg mixture on top of the heated spinach mixture though, as it couldn't really seep down to the crust...just kind of sat on top.  next time i am not going to heat the spinach mixture.

What a fantastic quiche! Next time I will cut way down on the butter (to 1 tbsp) and will add some half and half to the eggs instead of using milk to make it creamy. I will also use less cheese on the top because when I went to cut through the slices, the cheese on top was too cooked and made everything underneath a mess. My husband ate about half of the quiche and had to hold himself back from eating the rest!!

This was absolutely delicious! It instantly became a family favorite! Easy to prepare and very filling. I cut down on the butter as recommended by other cooks, and crisped the crust for 5 minutes in the oven before adding the mixture and eggs. Perfect!

This recipe turned out great despite changes:
left out milk
used 10oz can mushrooms

All I can say is YUM!!!!!  I don't even like spinach all that much but this was amazing.. I read the reviews and added a little more in order to make 2 quiches.  I left out the mushrooms and used sundried tomato and basil feta instead.

Absolutely mouthwatering! I used 2 cloves of garlic, 3/4 cup milk, 2 tbs butter (a must for that fantastic aroma!), 3 eggs and only 1 cup of cheddar instead and DO WITHOUT the salt. The herbed feta is what made this pie so never leave it out! In the egg mixture, I added a tbs of dried parsley, a heaped tsp of oregano as well as garlic powder. Just combined the spinach mixture together with egg mixture and pour into an 11" pan. On the top, i spreaded buttered cauliflower mash, baked for 15 mins then topped with 3/4 cup of cheddar and baked for a further 30 mins. Resulted in a 'healthier top crust' and wonderful meal!

First time I made quiche and it came out FANTASTIC! Per other reviewers, I made some changes - recipe in general is way too much for a 9-inch deep-dish store-bought crust so I will make two quiches next time. I used 2/3 cups half and half, 4 oz of feta (they don't sell 6 oz where I am so I opted for less), small Vidalia onion, and reduced the butter to 1 heaping tablespoon. I also put the top layer of cheddar cheese during the last 15 minutes of cook time. Mmmmmm...this was so decadent.

Great recipe, but it had too much butter.  Use half the butter and it will still be rich and flavorful.

It seems a little ridiculous to rate this recipe after there are soooo many.  But this is a great(!) recipe.  I quadrupled the recipe to feed a large crowd for Easter.  It was a definite hit.  I used the recipe as written, with a tad less butter, and it rocks.  Any additions would just be gravy.

This was a good quiche.  I followed the directions exactly, so that's what my rating is based upon.  Next time, I would make some changes: Increase to six eggs and 1 1/3 c milk, and split between two 9 inch pie crusts; use only 3/4 of the package of spinach; add some sauteed red bell pepper to the veggie mix; spread the spinach/feta mixture across the bottom of the two pans and then top with the eggs WITHOUT combining.  I thought given all the filling, it was hard to actually taste the eggs; layering will give it more of a quiche feeling.  Also, I found that there wasn't enough room for the egg mixture (I mixed eggs and spinach together before pouring in deep dish pie shell and still had to throw some away). I love the spinach and feta mixture though!  Sooo good.

Well I don't think this recipe needs anymore reviews...we all can't be wrong!
I've made this recipe at least 5 times now and changed it a bit by adding some cubbed ham or crumbled bacon, but it really needs nothing. I just wanted to add some of our favorites. Everyone loves it! To make it feed our family with a leftover for lunch, I make it deep dish by streching my pie crust a little wider, using 6 eggs and 1 cup non-fat half-half and 1/4 cup lowfat milk. Yummy. Sometimes I make two and freeze one after cooking. Excellent!

I made this quiche tonight with Dana's "Butter Flaky Pie Crust"  and it was to die for! We both loved it! I added extra cheese, you can never go wrong with cheese! I also used heavy cream instead of milk. I didn't use butter, instead I used a bit of olive oil to saute. I added mushrooms and bacon pieces. And I added sun dried tomatoes to the top and covered it with cheese. The sun dried tomatoes added a bit of extra flavor. It was delicious!! I did NOT add any salt because the cheeses and sun dried tomatoes had enough salt in it. It was perfect along with a salad. :-) I'll definitly be making this again! I think next time I'll be adding ham or more chunks of meat for my carnivorous husband. :-P

We loved this. I cooked the onion in olive oil instead of butter. I subsituted a bit of ham for the mushrooms and used 3/4 C milk instead of 1 C. My husband bought 2 9in pie crusts instead of a deep dish (don't ask) so I had to make 2 & cooked them for the same ammount of time. I also baked the crusts for 5 mins in the oven before adding the other ingrediants. Thanks. We'll be making this again.

This was great.  I made a crustless quiche with this.  I just added 1/2 c flour to the milk/egg mixture.  I also topped the quiche with all of the cheese (by accident) and baked.  It turned out golden brown in about 30 minutes.  A keeper for sure!

I probably can't fairly rate this recipe since I made a few changes, but my quiche turned out great. I substituted chopped broccoli for the spinach because that was all that I had in the house. I think that the broccoli ends up taking up more room in the pie crust so I wasn't able to use all of the egg mixture. Despite that, it turned out great. I love the flavor addition of the feta, and I left out the salt completely because feta is naturally so salty. My husband who doesn't like quiche even ate a few slices of this quiche (maybe because it wasn't as "eggy" as other quiches). I can't wait to try the recipe with spinach next time!

Could probably do with 3/4 stick or even 1/2 a stick of butter (instead of 1 whole), but very tasty nonetheless.

wow! this is really good! my husband and i made this recipe with a few small changes: I used only about 1/8 c. butter to saute the vegetables; i had some zucchini in the frig and sliced it up cooked it with the onions and garlic. one other change... instead of the pie crust, we used two large mission carb-balance tortillas to line the bottom of the pie plate (spray  with a little bit of non-stick spray first).

This was very good, even though I lighted it A LOT. I always make quiches crustless, and I used 1 TB of butter, 2 oz of feta, a light sprinkle of cheddar, 5 fresh mushrooms sliced, and the remaining half of a package of frozen spinache. I sauteed the mushrooms with the garlic and onions. BF loved it. on the keeper list!

I needed to make this a little healthier so my changes were instead of 4 eggs I used 1 egg and 3/4 cup eggbeaters, reduced fat feta (and added a little bit of italian seasoning and garlic powder), about 4 ounces 2% shredded cheddar cheese and 1 % milk.  It was so good!  My 9 year old asked for thirds!  Make sure you do let it set for about 15-20 minutes before serving.  I will make this for guests.

1/2 the amount of butter is plenty. I used plain feta and added my own herbs. This was a delicious and rich quiche. You'll feel a little guilty after eating it. My kids ranged from tolerating it (which is still a winner in my book) to loving it!

Awesome flavor!  A 1/2 cup of butter is alot; you could easily get away with using olive oil to reduce the fat content. I used two regular pie crusts, creating two quiches.  We ate one and froze the other for another day!

I've made this twice now, changing the ingredients based on what I have.  I've used sauteed spinach, red pepper, feta cheese, colby jack, and mozzarella, half cream half milk (or half half-and-half and half milk), sausage... it's turned out great both times!  I used a basic butter pastry crust with it.

Delicious. Next time, for my own prefernce, I may reduce the amount of butter a little bit and put the remainder of cheddar on during the last 15 minutes of cooking.  But truly delicious just the way it is.

Like other reviewers said, this is a very forgiving recipe. I changed it up a bit to make it more healthy.  I only used 1 T of butter, and only used about 1/2 C of cheddar.  I also used two eggs and three egg whites.  It was very tasty!  Love the addition of the feta for a kick.

I don't seem to be as big a fan of this recipe as everyone else, although my husband gave it a big thumb's up.  This was my first time making a quiche and I thought it was very easy to make.  For some reason, however, the spinach layer and the egg mixture never really mixed together and there were two layers.  Anyone else with this problem?  I think next time, I would just combine the two parts and then pour them into the crust.  I found the feta cheese a little overwhelming, I would cut back a little.  Also, you absolutely do not need to add any salt to this recipe, there is so much from the cheeses already.  I will try again.  (I took other reviewers' suggestions and cut way back on the butter, using 1 Tbsp. butter and 1 Tbsp. olive oil, and I cut the milk back to a 1/2 cup.  I used 4 eggs and it was just the right size for a deep dish crust.)  I had no mushrooms, fresh or canned.

Made this for my family and they loved it. I substituted 3 tablespoons Extra Virgin Olive Oil for the butter, and used 2% milk cheddar. It definitely fills TWO deep dish shells. Next time I may try 2% milk (instead of whole) to cut the fat down further. I'll be making this many more times!

Excellent recipe!  I had some leftover pastry dough from something else, so when I saw this reciepe - perfecto!  Omitted mushrooms, only 1 T butter, 2 eggs, and halved the cheese.  Added roasted bell peppers and jalapeno stuffed olives.  With these changes, it fit in one 9" tart shell.  Really drain the frozen spinach...  cannot be stressed enough.  Had to up resting time to 20 minutes, could have gone even longer.  Definately will make again!

Very yummy. I made two as the filling was enough. I added less milk (1/2 C each quiche) as there was still a little liquid with the spinach. I mixed the cheddar in and added mushrooms with the onions and garlic. Fab! Thanks Bailey, this is a winner!

My first time making quiche and it turned out great!  I used a 10 oz. bag of fresh spinach, about 5-7 fresh mushrooms, and fresh Dodonis Feta instead.  I also rolled out my own dough for the first time!  It was very easy and I found the recipe on this site.  The quiches (filling made 2) were delicious, even better the next day.  What a nice breakfast treat with a hot cup of coffee and sliced tomatoes or fruit.  Thanks Bailey.

My husband and I are on a low-carb diet, so we didn't make this with crust, and it was just as well.  Lots of flavor packed in this one.  Spinach is sooo nutrient dense and tasty, we couldn't pass this one up!  Great for quick breakfasts!  I also have made this by request again and again for church, but I make it in a mini-muffin fashion for easy handling.

I made this recipe exactly as described for a Christmas brunch.  Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe!  This is one recipe that will be made over and over - for brunch or dinner.

Loved this recipe.  Read the reviews and have to agree that it makes too much filling but I just took some out before I poured the egg mixture over it, put it in a little corningware dish and put a little of the egg on the top and baked both.  Fantastic!  I messed up and put the cheddar on top from the beginning but it still came out great.  Thanks for the recipe!  Oh, almost forgot, I too cut the butter in half as others recommended.  :)

I used 2/3 a bag of "real" spinach, sauted and reduced in butter - make sure to add a bit of butter to the pan with each batch.  mature spinach can be a bit bitter - look for baby spinach leaves.  I didn't have 8 oz of cheese on hand, more like 4, and that was enough.
It was good - even my pick
y teenagers liked it.   will try the base with other ingredients used at La Madeline!

This tasted great!  My boyfriend who does not especially like spinach even loved it.  I used half of the butter and half of the cheddar cheese as suggested by others.  Next time I will use even less cheddar cheese.  It made the house smell great while I was preparing it.

This is a wonderful quiche! I was looking for a recipe with spinach & mushrooms.  I didn't have any feta, so I used some blue cheese instead.  I also used some dried minced onion and sauteed it with the garlic and mushrooms.  I used butter flavored cooking spray instead of butter. I also substituted whipping cream for 1/2 of the milk.  It all fit perfectly into a deep dish crust which I had prebaked for a few minutes.  I will most definitely make this again!!

Fantastic taste and presentation!  I love it as well as my guests!  I did have left over like the other reviews mentioned, which I just discarded.  With the amount of time involved and number of ingrediants, this is a great dish to serve to a group at bruch, although I wouldn't cook it for just me and mine.  Again, Fantastic!

Spectacular!  Everyone in my family loves this recipe-- even the ones that won't even look at a quiche.  I usually buy Athenos brand garlic and herb feta, and cut the amount of garlic that is added.

I followed the recipe to the letter and it was wonderful! However, it was almost too much for a single deep dish pie crust.  I plan to use egg substitute and halve the butter and cheddar cheese next time to cut out some of the fat.

YUMM.  I made my first quiche last night and used this recipe.  

I changed it up a bit...used fresh baby spinach instead of frozen, used 1/2 fake carton eggs and 1/2 real eggs, shallots instead of onion, no mushrooms, plain feta (added my own seasonings) and a little less cheese than called for!

The quiche was delicious...everyone loved it!

Next time I will leave out the salt.  The salt from the cheese is more than enough for the quiche...I thought it turned out a little too salty and I only added a pinch.

This was a wonderful quiche recipe! After reading the other reviews, I used a deep dish pie pan and was able to just have one. I poured off about half the butter after I cooked the onions and garlic (next time I will start with 1/4 cup instead) and I did mix the egg mixture with the spinach mixture before adding it to the pie shell. It all went in beautifully together! Like many other husbands, mine is not a quiche person, but he said he was looking forward to having it again!! Thanks for the recipe!!

This recipe is excellent.  I made it the first time for company and was a little nervous about how it would turn out, but it was great.  The flavor was delicious and the consistency was perfect.  Be sure to thoroughly drain (squeeze) the spinach and canned mushrooms.

This quiche is really easy to make, although a little time consuming.  I really liked that it make more than one quiche, so I could freeze the extra one for later use.  I made this recipe for my co-workers, and I received nothing but compliments.  One suggestion I have is to use more eggs, as I found only 4 eggs does not fill up two pie crusts.  I would suggest 6 or 7 eggs total.  Otherwise, I also like this recipe since it is easy to add or subtract ingredients as well.  I added 1/2 lb cooked bacon to the recipe and it made for a nice addition.  Perhaps the best part... the finished product looks impressive, but it's very easy!

This is a great dish and I've gotten compliments from everyone I've served it to.  I actually make two 8 inch pies out of this recipe.  The cheddar cheese has posed a problem however, because it tends to get too hard if I put it on following the first 15 minutes of baking time.

the mushrooms for personal preference and

I have made this quiche twice now. I really love it. I do suggest the following modifications:

1. Less butter. No need for that much butter. Unless you want to gain 20 lbs and a heart attack. I used 1 tablespoon of smart balance butter and 1 tablespoon of olive oil. 

2. I only used 3/4 of the bag of spinach. It is a bit much. 

3. I used mozz and swiss cheese instead of cheddar to lower fat content. 

This will fit in a true deep dish pie pan. It will not fit in a "normal" sized pie pan.

I just used a TB of butter because of the other reviews and left out the mushrooms because some of the people I was serving it to don’t like them. This was a big hit for Christmas brunch and I’m enjoying the leftovers too!

This is the best quiche recipe I have ever tried. Adding the mushrooms and onions first to the thawed pie crust allows it to take on a wonderful buttery flavor while I finish the rest of the recipe. My wife thinks I'm a genius!

This was great! I didn't have the  correct cheese so just used Jarlsberg cheese. Our company loved it.  This is a keeper for sure.

After reading other reviews, I used maybe 2 tbs of butter to sauté onion, garlic and mushrooms.  I also used less of each of the cheeses.  I used fresh chopped spinach and fresh basil, oregano and a little rosemary.  Made the recipe less fattening, but still really good.

This turned out great!  Used a homemade, blind-baked, pie crust.  Added a pinch of nutmeg for more flavor.  
A lot of people seem to be saying it's "too much filling", but I didn't have that problem.  Just make sure you're using a deep dish pie dish instead of the regular one.  Also I cut back on the butter and it was still rather rich and liquidy.

Loved it! Forgot to buy milk and used 1 cup of coconut milk instead. Didn't do the crust or mushrooms and it was delicious! Word to the wise if you use fresh spinach and sauté it, be sure to drain it before adding it to the egg mixture. Mine was just a little liquidity because I didn't do this.

First time trying quiche and I was afraid of it having too much of an eggy taste/texture. BUT this was wonderful!! I cut the butter down to 3 tbs and added rosemary, basil, and oregano spices to the mixture (I was afraid the feta cheese wouldn't give enough flavour). OMG, this is absolutely delicious! I added bacon and omitted the salt. The cheese and bacon was salty enough. I have made this twice in a week. My husband ate one to himself. I'm hesitant to try other recipes now since this recipe set the bar quite high!

I used regular pie crust and only 4oz herb and garlic feta cheese and it was awesome.  I also used only 1.5tbs butter and I cooked the pie crust for 7 minutes before adding the filling.  I also used fresh mushrooms and cooked them with the onions.  Everyone said it was delicious :-) except the boys who would not try it because of the spinach

I thought this recipe was very tasty but:
The 1/2 cup of butter mixed with the cheese made it very greasy.  Next time I will reduce the butter to 1/4 cup. I slowly added the egg mixture to the spinach mixture ( off heat) in order to guarantee that it would be nicely combined. Just cool down you spinach mixture on a plate first to keep from cooking your eggs on the egg mixture. I used plain feta as I couldn't find herbed feta.

Terrific quiche recipe! My husband said it's the best he's ever had. I followed the recommendations of other reviewers and used less butter -- 2 T. --  and less milk -- 1/2 c. -- and plain feta cheese. I added about 1/4 t. dried basil. I also used a Pillsbury ready-to-bake pie crust, baking it first for 8 minutes to keep it from getting soggy on the bottom. I also sautéed fresh mushroom with the onion and garlic, rather than using canned mushrooms. Be sure to use a deep-dish pie plate, too. SO good! This will become part of our regular meal rotation.

I made the filling according to the directions, except that I used less butter (~3tbs) as others suggested, and  I only used 4 oz of feta and about a  tbsp Italian seasoning.  I split the filling between two pie crusts (pre-made from Aldi) and then I added the egg/milk mixture to each of the pies.  I used 4 eggs and ¾ C of milk for each of the pies.  I baked for 15 min, added cheese as recipe suggested, then baked for another 30.  They were wonderful.  Will be making again.

Was wonderful!! I added extra seasoning to suite my taste. The only change I will make from now on will be to add another egg, precook the crust for a bit and incorporate all the cheese instead of layering some on top. It browned too much. Cook time was about 10 minutes to long. Had to pull out after about 20 minutes or the cheese would have burned.

Delicious! I think I used 1/3 butter. I think it would be equally delicious with only 1/4 cup. I wouldn't cut it much more than that though. Butter helps add flavor! Also, 3 eggs and 3/4 cup milk is all you need. There is no way you can fit 4 eggs and 1 cup milk into the pie crust.

Great quiche base!!! Probably one of the best quiche I've ever had. I did follow other's advise and cut the grease. I used non of the butter listed. I fried bacon and used a TB spoon of the grease to sautéed onion, mushrooms, and fresh spinach (tossed in towards the end) and I threw in some leftover rotisserie chicken, and of course the bacon. Mixed everything together used 1/2 cup of cheese instead of a full cup. Pre- cooked the pie crust 10 minutes then poured in the mixture, covered the crust edges and baked 30 min. Sprinkled with cheese 1/4 cup and removed foil bake another 15 min. Perfect!

The ingredients don't fit into a 9"deep pie crust.  Not even close.  If I ever make a quiche again I will follow a recipe that doesn't include so much butter, so much egg and so much milk/light cream.

Way too much fat in this recipe and it's not needed. I reduced the butter to 3 tablespoons to saute the onion/garlic and reduced the garlic to one clove. I used 3 eggs and added 1 tablespoon of flour to make sure the quiche firmed up. Added 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg for flavour and some chopped ham. I also used fresh spinach which I sauteed along with the onion and garlic to wilt it. I used Swiss cheese; cheddar is too bland for my family. I will use Gruyere cheese in future as it has even more flavor. I used 4 oz feta since I'm not crazy about feta. A good recipe with a lot of tweaks.

Filling was absolutely delicious! My husband ate half the quiche the first night :) I made my own pie crust and par baked it for 10 minutes then let cool for 15 before adding the filling and eggs. I used a 9.5 inch glass pie dish and found I had  about 1/2 cup too much liquid for the dish to hold so a mix of butter and eggs spilled over the sides.  I let it set in the refrigerator for about 3 hours, then baked as recipe suggested- it came out perfectly set with a delicious crust of cheddar. Will definitely make again.

Very delicious and easy to make.  I used what I had on hand for the filling:  ground beef, spinach, sautéed salami, red onion, garlic, parmesan cheese.  Important to drain the spinach well and sautee everything together and make sure the mixture is very dry.  I only used a smidgen of butter, about a 1/2 inch slice from the stick, not nearly as much as the recipe called for.  I beat the eggs and milk until frothy so it would not be dense.  The quiche turned out wonderfully light, perfectly seasoned and not greasy at all since I used very little butter.  If you want a quiche that is light, but still substantial, I say go for the meat.  Even my picky 5 yr old liked it and he won't touch anything green.  Winner!!

Loved it! Used a Jiffy pie crust (whole box rolled out for the bottom crust) and a round casserole dish, since there was so much filling and it wouldn't have fit in my pie plate. Decreased the butter to 3T and it was plenty.

I've been meaning to try this recipe for a long time. I finally made this for a potluck, and it was a hit!! I had friends calling me the next day asking for leftovers... Having read about the excess filling size, i downsized the spinach, mushrooms and feta a little. Yet it seemed like a lot when poured into the pie crust. But it wasn't an issue because it settled in eventually. Do try this!

I added onion powder and garlic powder, no onions.  added less cheddar, added Parmesan. my feta cheese wasn't herb and garlic- it was plain but it was kept in a container with olives, so it had an olive smell while I was frying. I think that may have added a lot of flavor. I also used frozen mushrooms that I had fried earlier with garlic and onion. I made my own dough, and I lined the pan with homemade breadcrumbs. loved it! so flavorful :)

Great base quiche, we loved it.  I did fresh spinach, and skipped the mushrooms.  Also added a diced red pepper.  Great, the whole family enjoyed it!

Excellent! My family loved this recipe, even having seconds.  I did add bacon bits to the spinach mixture as well as mozzarella. This was delicious and very flavorful.

My husband and I both loved this!  We made it just as the critical review suggested which was a tablespoon of butter and 3/4ths cup of milk.  We put the whole quiche in one pie crust and it was outstanding.  It was a great new Christmas morning tradition.

I liked this quiche overall, the next time I would reduce the salt.  There's salt in the crust, salt in the preparation of the spinach/vegetables and more salt in the egg mixture.  Too much.  Otherwise, I liked the texture and the flavor, etc.  Used fresh spinach, fresh mushrooms and added spices to regular feta cheese to make it "herb/garlic".  Took to a Christmas potluck and everyone loved it.

I loved this dish.  It makes a great dinner for Fall or Winter, my husband even liked it and he doesn't eat anything that doesn't contain meat!  I loved it so much I'm making another one to bring to my mom's for Christmas :-)

I liked this and my daughter liked it.  But, it is true, you will not fit this in one deep dish!  I tried!  Had some left over and also it bubbled over the dish.  Thankfully I had a cookie sheet underneath.  RIP cookie sheet...

I used fresh mushrooms and Swiss and Gruyere. It was delicious. Next time, I'll make it without the crust for a healthier version. Think I'll add some red and yellow bell pepper. Will bake in a square Pyrex dish, then slice into single serve potions and freeze.

Yep, two of them for me too, but still a lovely dish! Maybe a deep dish pie would fit all the toppings? I'm not sure, but definitely cut down your butter! My onion and garlic mix were hot tubbing in the stuff. Maybe two tablespoons to start the onions and add another two to flavor the spinach mix when you add it. Really easy to make though, I'm glad I found this recipe.

Delicious. Add 1/2 to 3/4 pound sausage (regular), and then just used cheddar cheese, but could try with feta--probably would be good. Also, filled two normal size pie crusts (not deep dish). Baked for 15 minutes, added cheese on top, and then baked for about 20-25 more minutes .

I am not an experienced cook. This was very easy to make. Only things I would change is the amount of cheese. Seems like a huge amount and also the egg and milk mixture seemed to spill over when adding it in with the rest of the mixtures. Tasted pretty darn good though!

I used this as a base, but I thought there was way too much butter. Even after I cut it in half. I also did not use a crust, but rather sprayed a muffin tin and made mini quiches to freeze. Oh, I also did not add feta (didn't have any) so for some more flavor I added some rosemary and red pepper flakes.

I love this recipe! My husband, who really hates eggs and breakfast in general, devoured this the first time I made it. It's my go to breakfast recipe when we have guests over, it's easy and delicious. Follow other user recommendations for pre-baking crust and cutting down butter and cheese.

Very good with several modifications.  Replaced the 4T of butter with 1T of olive oil (other reviewers reduced or eliminated the butter too), used 6 oz fresh spinach (removed the stems and chopped), 4 large fresh mushrooms, chopped, 1/3 cup of chopped sweet Vidalia onion, reduced the garlic to 1 clove, and used plain feta instead of the herbed feta.  I added 1/4 cup finely chopped green bell pepper to the mix, seasoned with pepper, but no salt (feta is quite salty), and replaced the cheddar that is sprinkled on top with grated asiago cheese.  I made a 9" pie in a gluten-free crust, but based on other reviewer's advice that there was too much filling for 1 pie, I made 4 small crust-less quiches in paper baking cups too.  The 9" pie was good, but it turned out that my deep-dish crust was plenty big enough to hold all of the filling, and it would have been better that way.  However, I'm glad I made that mistake because the little crust-less quiches were wonderful, and they only took 10 minutes to bake!  No need for a crust with this recipe, which is great for those on a gluten-free diet.  If I make this for people who can eat gluten and want a crust, I think it would be better in a crust made from a tube of refrigerated crescent rolls.

It was wonderful. I made this today, Mother's Day, for brunch. I made a few changes and additions simply by preference. I used a Pyrex baking dish, sprayed, and lined the bottom only with crescent roll dough rather than using a pie crust. I also added 1/2 lb. bacon fried well but less than crisp. I also used 1/2 cup heavy cream and 1/2 cup milk rather than just milk. The recipe states baking 15 min. before topping with cheese and then finish baking. I waited 20 min. before topping with cheese. It came out golden brown enough to make me wonder if I hadn't burned the top. Amazingly, it wasn't even crisp. Topping with cheese even later in the baking time should lighten the top and hopefully the cheese will remain creamier. The egg mixture was so light and airy. I will make this many times again.

This was delicious!  The only changes I made was left out the mushrooms because I don't like them, used fresh spinach, plain feta and added a few more cloves of fresh garlic.   I will defiantly make this again, it reheats nice too so you can heat it quickly in the morning and have a good breakfast before work.
After making this a few times, I have also cut the butter amount in half and use only 3 eggs (4 eggs overflows in a deep dish pie crust).

Loved it! Very flavorful! The only thing I changed was using fresh vegetables.. baby spinach and portabella mushroom caps! Also, I only could find plain feta. I split the veggies into two 9 inch pie crusts and mixed two batches of the egg mixture to pour over top. My family was pleasantly surprised. I definately will be making this again.

This was quick and delicious. A good quiche base. I used leftover ham from Easter and cheddar cheese. Also added broccoli, sautéed onions, and diced green chiles. Because of the extra  ingredients I had to use a fourth egg and extra milk.

This recipe was fabulous!  I did switch it up by using fresh mushrooms.  I discovered my husband had used the last of the minced garlic so I substituted it with garlic powder.  I used tomato and basil feta cheese.  Instead of using cheddar cheese, I used half sharp cheddar cheese and half Colby cheese and Monterey Jack.  We initially tried pouring the egg/milk mixture over the quiche mixture in the pie pans but the egg/milk mix went everywhere!  Once that occurred, we emptied the contents of the pie shells into a large mixing bowl.  We added the rest of the egg/milk mixture and mixed it thoroughly.  Then we returned the mixture back to the pie shells. We did have some leftover mixture.  Due to the size of our family, I made two quiches and placed them on a foil lined cookie sheet with a lip. Even for two pies, it cooked in the same amount of time as just one quiche (I do not have a convection oven).  I served fresh raspberries as a garnish.  I also prepared the easy arugula salad recipe on Allrecipes.com as a side.  This was so tasty and not hard at all.

I made this and split it into 2 deep dish pie shells as another reviewer suggested. I only used 2 tbsp of butter not sure why you would have needed more. I used a blend of italian cheeses and could only find tomato basil feta cheese.Turned out great. Gave the second one to my friend for her husbands birthday and she called me saying the 2 of them ate the whole thing in one serving it was so good!So easy to make also. Tastes like you slaved in the kitchen!!

I made this recipe for brunch; we really enjoyed it. 
I used fresh spinach and mushrooms instead and sautéed them before throwing it in the mix; I assume this caused extra moisture, since I didn't the spinach/mushroom mixture after sautéing it and it took longer for the quiche to cook.  I will make it with fresh ingredients again but will skip the sauté part. The taste was good.

Only 4 stars because, as others mentioned, it made too much filling, resulting in a messy overflow. But it tasted great!

I have made this recipe a few time now.  The first time I cooked the recipe as is, which was fine except that I didn't like the crust very much.  Later I took a note from a different recipe and layered the bottom of the crust with swiss cheese.  This made all the difference in the world.  I now make a lower cal version by reducing the butter and the amount of cheese (the swiss on the bottom makes up for this).  I also use a combination of reduced and full fat cheeses.

I was looking for a quick dinner using eggs. This is a great basic recipe, just tweak it depending on what you have on hand. I added an extra egg and used whatever cheese I had. Did decrease the butter to maybe a 1/4 if a cup as others suggested  Did not have feta or mushrooms. I think I just used cheddar. The extra egg did make a nice firm quiche. I will use this recipe again and again just mixing up what I add to it. Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe. always wondered how to make quiche and was pleased with this recipe. Like others I changed things a bit. I added a couple slices of cooked bacon and used the grease from that to cook the veggies instead of butter. Didn't use feta. Used soy milk instead of regular. this is definitely too much for one pie. Will use 3/4 of what's listed in the future. :)

Best spinach quiche I've tasted! Even hubby who doesn't like quiches loved it. Made these adjustments, per pie (1) used 1.5 tbsp of butter only (2)used 8 oz spinach (3) used 4 oz feta (4) used whole milk.  A definite keeper recipe!

My husband and I loved this quiche! We have been married for years but this is the first quiche I have made for him because I thought he didn't like quiche.  For a sure hit, I wanted to make a more healthful quiche than Quiche Lorraine, and this was a home run!  I make my own pie crusts and for this one, in keeping with the healthful theme, I used unbleached white whole wheat flour and it was a fantastic combination. The recipe measurements were perfect and I won't change a thing the next time I make it. I don't have a deep dish stone so I used my 10" Pampered Chef pie stone (never a soggy pie crust) and it worked perfectly.  We cannot wait to have more of this quiche.  Thank you.

Not only was it delicious, but beautifully golden brown.  Looked and tasted better than a restaurant.
I will be making this often.  I don't like mushrooms so I left them out.

So good and very easy to "use what you have."  I couldn't find herb and garlic feta, so I used Rondell soft cheese with herbs and garlic (very creamy) and I used a mixture of other cheeses I had on hand. I used a refrigerated pie crust, which I baked for about 5-6 minutes and then poured the mixture into it to bake for the rest of the time.  Thanks so much for this great recipe!

Good starting point for making a quiche. I made it the directed way the first time and made adjustments the second time. I prefer this recipe made with FRESH spinach. Blanch in boiling water for about  5 minutes drain well I used approx. 6 cups of fresh baby spinche.. It was great. I also added some grape tomato sliced in half blended in some feta cheese. This adds a very flavorful and distinctive taste... yum yum.

As usual I love this recipe as a great base recipe for a delicious spinach quiche. The first time I followed the directions and it came out a bit oily (too much butter) and I had approximately half of the egg mixture left over. It was delish nonetheless!! So now my second time making it, as my boyfriend LOVED it so much last time, I've made a few changes. I used fresh mushrooms, add in marinated artichokes and used 3 eggs and 1/2 cup of milk. I still had a little of the egg mixture left over, so the next time I make it I'll try using 2 eggs and 1/4-1/2 cup of milk.

EASY EASY EASY!  I added spinach, mushroom, onions and swiss. Sprinkled pepperjack on top. I also used 1/2cup milk, 1/2 half and half and 1 cup of egg beaters.  It filled 2 frozen pie crusts so I brought one to work!  I got a raise!  :)

Very good and nice consistency. I did not have mushrooms, so I used some green and orange peppers instead.  I used skim Lactaid milk and plain feta cheese and only one clove garlic.  I think the prep time should be longer.  I cut up my veggies the night before and still had 20-30 minute prep time.  Also I used a 9 inch deep dish pre-made frozen crust and there was too much egg/milk mixture.  Will definitely make again.

Loved the recipe, EXCEPT the idea of the 1/2 C of butter.  Instead, I used about 1 1/2 T of olive oil....it was plenty to sauté the veggies, and the quiche was not oily at all.  I also used fresh mushrooms instead of canned, and I sauted them along with the garlic and onion.  I also pre-baked my pie crust for 7 minutes to make sure it got nice and crisp.  Minor changes, but they make a big difference in the outcome.  Because my husband isn't crazy about Feta, I cut that in half.  This is delicious....I just finished a piece for lunch, and I wish I had some more!!

This recipe makes a delicious quiche, it was everything I hoped it would be.  Told my husband if I had ordered this in a restaurant I would have been extremely happy and would have ordered it again.  Especially like the fact that (warm) it stands on its own plated and doesn't melt out.

I made this exactly according to the recipe, and it was AMAZING! I think the main photo of this recipe is misleading as it looks like the egg sits on top and the spinach sits on the bottom. This made me hesitant to make this recipe. However, the egg mixture seeps into the veggie and cheese mixture quite nicely. I now use this recipe as my basis for making other quiches, changing the types of veggies and cheese.

I made this with fresh spinach I had on hand & wanted to use, did not use any feta cheese, actually used about 3 kinds of cheese, mild cheddar, mozzarella & sharp cheddar, & used a pre-made crust.  Hubby said it was the best quiche ever.  Am making it again today!

This was yum!!! I used about 1 T oil and that was definitely enough. I skipped the pie crust, used regular feta cheese, mixed pizza cheese instead of the cheddar and 4 egg whites and 2 whole eggs. After the first 15 min bake, I mixed in the rest of the cheese because I was afraid the topping would burn after the extra time in the oven. This was very good. Totally do not need the extra added salt though after all that cheese.

Quiche is not one of my favourite types of dish but I really enjoyed this one. I read some other reviews and took the advice of splitting the filling amount between two pie crusts instead of one. I really can't see how all of it could fit in one! 
I would also use 3/4 cup of milk next time. There was a little too much liquid. Definitely put the pies on a baking sheet unless you want this all over the bottom of your oven. I used fresh mushrooms. I couldn't find garlic and herb feta so I used regular feta and just added some italian seasoning and granulated garlic. I also doubled the amount of fresh garlic because I love having stinky breath! I used probably a lot more cheddar cheese than the recipe called for but I never measure that stuff out. There could never be too much cheese!

Loved this recipe because it's not set in stone.  I can change (and have in subsequent versions) the cheese, the vegetable and even made a cheese crust for a friend on a low carb diet.  Works every time!  Love it!

Excellent spinach quiche, have made it twice now; I cut down the butter to 1 tbsp and use the Better Homes and Garden pie crust recipe. I was also, like other reviewers, able to divide this into 2 tart pans easily.

I think this is the BEST quiche I've ever made and I've made a lot!  You don't need that much butter to saute onions.  I used fresh mushrooms and half-n-half in place of milk, and I'm lucky enough to have farm fresh eggs from my chickens.  Other than those 2 small changes I did everything as the recipe is printed.  My husband and his friend said it's the best quiche they've ever eaten!  Thank you!!

This is outstanding. For a more healthy alternative, I used Coconut oil in place of butter, and Soy almond milk in place of regular milk. Other than that, I made it exactly as written. We give it more than 5 stars!

I've been making this quiche for a few years and my family loves it. The only changes are to use half the butter, no salt in the spinach mixture, and add all the cheddar to the spinach mixture rather than how recipe describes. I used jarred mushrooms for convenience but prefer to use fresh and saute with onions.

Made this for brunch today.  Hubby gave it 5 stars. I did not have mushrooms next time I will have to add them and I did not want to use up my feta cheese so I omitted that too.  I used Trader Joe's 3 cheese mix of mozzarella, Monterrey Jack, and Cheddar, fresh spinach (well drained of excess water), and a Marie Callender's Deep Dish Pie Shells.

This was very easy to make and good.  I doubled the recipe and made two pies.  I must say, I had enough with just the eggs for one recipe to cover both pies almost.  Everyone really liked it and I would make it again but add some variations to it probably.

This was very good.  I had to feed 2 big eaters so I added a couple more eggs and little more spinach and a few strips of crumbled bacon.  Still it only feed 5.  I was hoping for leftovers so will have to make it again.

Great recipe. I added eggplant, tomato, foiled the crust, pre cooked crust 5 min. Doesn't seem like much could've been added to this, but it turned out very good as well. Thanks.

We loved this recipe.  I used romano cheese, crumbed with butter, instead of the feta.  Used 5 eggs as well.  Delicious.  Husband really liked it, served with fresh green salad.  Thanks so much for posting.

This is amazing, but the amounts are off as others say. I've made this with fat free feta and it doesn't turn out quite as salty. I always use 3 eggs and 3/4 cup of milk, 2 pie crusts and a lot of cheddar :)

This quiche gets me compliments every single time. We used olive oil (just the amount needed to saute) instead of all that butter. And we used 3 parts whole milk and 1 part half and half at my mom's suggestion. We skipped the mushrooms because I hate them. I don't know about the other reviewers, but this seemed to fit my 10 inch diameter, 2 (?) inch deep glass pie pan (tart pan?) pretty much perfectly. I used a premade crust from the refrigerator section of the grocery. My didn't turn out like the featured picture, with the spinach at the bottom and eggs on top, it was kinda all blended together and actually VERY pretty. Lovely recipe. Thank you!

The recipe made more than my deep dish would hold, I ended up using two crusts and it filled them both about 3/4 of the ways on each.  The filling was great and hearty.  We used it as our Meatless Monday meal, and Hubby even liked it!

I made this because I had to use up some spinach and some eggs.  I didn't use mushrooms and used regular feta cheese instead of the herb and garlic.  I put the mix in a muffin tin and cooked them for about 15 minutes.  I added the cheese on top and cooked about another 5.  They turned out amazing!  Definatly a keeper!!

Everyone praised this quiche! I used fresh kale and Hungarian Walking Onions from the garden, plus fresh spinach. I did not add a crust but cooked the whole thing in one old-style iron frying pan (with eggs from my laying hens :) ). It cooked more quickly with the iron preheated. This is a real keeper--yum!

Tried this recipe and after reading all the reviews, decided less butter the better and made some of my own variations to the recipe.  Instead of using butter to saute, I just used Smart Balance spray to coat the fry pan.

I made my pie crustless to save a few calories.  I used chopped onion, spinach (less than the recipe called for, I used only a half a cup cooked down).  Because I had seen it used in a quiche at a local diner, I added diced tomatoes for a variation.

Also, I used less milk as I was making it crustless and didn't want it to be watery.  I only used a 1/4 cup of mile and 1/2 of fat free half and half to make it creamier.

I really liked the recipe and my Dad really enjoyed the Spinanch (and vegtable) quiche.  Said it was better than the one at the local diner.  High praise as he loves eating there!

Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I didn't have mushrooms in the house, but even without it, this was delicious. My family loved it. I made a crust from scratch using the recipe in "How to Cook Everything." Very easy and well worth it.

Ok, this was fab!!! I made this for folks who don't count calories and its a good thing! I did not read all the reviews and about mid way got concerned about the quantities. Most def makes 2 pies, there was way too much egg and milk, cut it in half and still make 2pies easily. So really the recipe makes two pies, I did lessen the butter used all the feta on the recipe and 1/2 the cheddar. added two sliced of chopped up ham for flavor and used fresh mushrooms, a must for me. I used a very large onion and I am glad. The reviews were wild, everyone wanted the recipe, men and women. As she said its an ad lib recipe, but quantiey needs to be cut back as others say too! Will make again and again ,perhaps with a tad less butter! :D

I have made this twice this week and I think it’s a great dish. The first time I only made a few changes. I used three tablespoons of butter, fat free feta, low fat cheddar, added thick cut cooked bacon, and left out the salt. I bought a 9 inch deep dish Marie Callender’s frozen pie shell and I had too much filling, so I froze what I did not use. The quiche was fantastic and it was my intention to make this a head of time for a daily breakfast dish. Yesterday I multiplied the ingredients by 1.5 thinking that it would fill two pie shells. They ended up overfilled again, but not by much. If I had left the bacon out, they probably would have been fine, but there was no way that was going to happen! I refrigerated each quiche overnight and cut them into eight pieces this morning. I wrapped each piece in foil and put them in my freezer except for what I will eat the next three days. I could easily eat 1/6 or even 1/4 of the pie, but I am working on portion control and I use more expensive ingredients since almost everything that I used was organic or “clean”. I estimate that I got my cost per slice down to under $1.50 each.

Great recipe!  Made some minor changes. Instead of pie crust I used flakey biscuits, chopped fresh spinach, mushrooms, and bell peppers. I like my food spicy so I used shredded pepper jack. And I omitted the feta.

I make this in an emergency as a main dish when I realized one of the guests for dinner was a vegetarian! Even with no crust it was amazing. There was not a crumb left; everyone loved it, and nobody missed the meat. 

Of course, I made alterations as this was not planned and I didn't have all the ingredients. Instead of mushrooms, I used marinated artichoke hearts. I also supplemented the fresh spinach with chopped kale. Cut the butter by half. Even like that, it was great!

I only used a tablespoon of butter. And added some red pepper. I didn't have any feta cheese, and just sprinkled mozarella on top.....it was still really good. But I found that it didn't fit a deep dish pie shell...too much filling. Delicious.

This is not a bad recipe ... But; I wouldn't be wanting to do it again. I'm not sure I liked the flavors. It really baked fine. It raised perfectly. I looked at many reviews to ensure I do this right. I made my crust fm scratch 1 day in advance, used 11inch round pan, put in oven for 25min before i add filling. Mixed all ingredients together. I used 1 tbs olive oil instead of 1/2 cup butter, 1 clove garlic only. fresh mushroom, fresh spinach, double cream instead of milk, worked out the filling measurement to fit the pan size. But unfortunately, the taste was bland!

Tasty but more spinach pie than quiche.  On the greasy side so will try less butter.  Also will try to pre-bake shell 5 minutes so hopefully less soggy on bottom.  Will definitely make again.

This could have been better.  I thought it was too salty.  Also, adding cheese to the top left a sort of chewy crust that we did not care for.

I used two store bought (standard) shells for this recipe. As mentioned before you can cut down on the butter and eliminate the salt completely because of the cheese. I added ham it was delicious.

This recipe was awesome!! I made this for a potluck at work, first time making quiche, and people raved! Thanks to other reviewers who explained how to cut fat/calories. I only used 1/4 cup butter, 1/2 cup or Rice milk, and only sprinkled the cheddar cheese on top instead of adding it to the sauted veggies and it still turned out amazing! I also added zucchini and eggplant, and almost had enough for two quiches.  Awesome recipe though! Thanks!

The quiche was very good- my coworkers all asked for the recipe!  I did however leave out the garlic and I substituted 1/2 a stick of smart balance for 1 stick of butter to be a little healthier.  Also, the picture looked kinda strange so I kinda mixed my spinach mixture with the egg mixture once in the crust.

Great recipe, but I had to mod it a bit since I'm lactose intolerant. I used olive oil instead of butter, plain almond milk instead of milk and no cheese. I also used fresh organic Spinach instead of frozen and fresh mushrooms instead of canned. Still tasted Awesome!!!

This has become a Thanksgiving tradition for my two vegetarian guests. I reduce the vegetables slightly to make room for the red bell pepper I add, which make the whole thing look very Christmas-y and the added taste is marvelous.  I use MEDIUM eggs and cut the other liquid ingredients slightly to prevent spillage since there really is too much filling for the quiche 'as is'.

This was delicious.  I used less butter and substituted shredded swiss for cheddar.  Be careful not to fill with the spinach mixture or you won't have enough room for eggs to swim around.

Very flavorful, this quiche totally hit the spot! I made a few measuring alterations... 4 tbs butter, 8 oz fresh spinach sauteed in the last few minutes of onion/garlic sautéing. 4 oz herb/garlic feta, 6 oz cheddar cheese, no salt and pepper, and 1/2 c soy milk. Will definitely make again!

Taste great. I couldn't get all of the egg/milk to fit so next time I'll cut that in half. Used 3T of butter and a little olive oil and a little more garlic. Could not find herb feta so I did as others and herbed it up myself.  I also baked my pie crust blind for 8 minutes as some suggested. Next time I will bake blind 6 minutes. Will definitely do this one again. Thanks Bailey for sharing.

This really was forgiving. I decided to make it as a last minute thing and refused to spend a lot. So I made a crust for the bottom only and used eggs with sour cream not milk. YUM. And I added left over sausage. The herb feta really set if off! This tasted bought, delicious.

This recipe is delicious! My son does not like any vegetables at all, but when I made this Quiche he loved it and got seconds. The only thing I did different was that I added Italian sausages(spicy) and that was a meal by itself. This was great! I would cook it again.

This is a good quiche recipe but I was hoping for better based on the reviews.  I followed a few suggestions like only using 3 eggs and 3/4c milk, fresh waited mushrooms, 4tbs butter and par baking crust. All really were great suggestions. However I  used regular feta and only about 3oz. I definitely used all 8 oz of cheddar and I'm a cheese lover so next time I will add more. All a in all it came out looking wonderful and tasted really good.

Excellent recipe. I added ham and fresh mushrooms instead of canned and eye balled the amount of cheese and it still turned out awesome. Also made two regular sized pies with all the extras. Will use this one again and again.

Very tasty! I was surprised as my son hates spinach in any form but really liked this quiche. I didnt have garlic feta or cheddar on hand so I used recotta and another firm white cheese, turned out great. I will be making this again and again, thank you Bailey.

I made this last night and made a couple of changes. I didn't put the herb/garlic/feta and I added a cube of chicken bouillon for more flavor. It was awesome. I will definitely be making this again.

Great recipe! Made it for my new husband last night & he loved it.  I used only 3tbs butter, 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 onion (he's not a big onion fan). I'm not a mushroom fan so added a small can of sliced black olives instead. Also added some diced smoked ham. This will definitely be going into our "Favorites" cookbook and be made again.

I followed the advice of others. I used a deep dish crust and heated it through.  I used a quarter of a red onion, no mushrooms (i didn't have any), 3 oz plain feta, italian seasoning and a 1/2 cup of half and half.

My first time making quiche and this recipe was simple and yummy. I did not use butter, mushrooms or the feta. I sauteed the onions and garlic with about a tablespoon of olive oil. Only used 1 1/2 large clove garlic. The rest was the same. Great option for the lactose-intolerant who love dairy - used lactose free milk and aged-lactose free cheddar (Cabot cheddars are lactose free due to the aging process.)

It's my first time to make quiche and was pleasantly pleased with the results.  As per others' suggestions, I reduced the amount of butter to about 1/3 of suggested amount and used a bit of olive oil.  Doubled the garlic, 3/4 c milk, used entire 16 oz pack of frozen chopped spinach and, instead of plain cheddar, I found a package of combined smoked gouda, cheddar, provolone and mozzarella and it turned out delicious.  The house smelled like bacon while baking.  I also had enough filling to make 2 pies!

This is a keeper! Even my brother who hates anything "with veggies" loved this. Next time I will try it without the crust as it was a bit sweet for our taste although that could have been the type I used. I also just used fresh spinach and wilted it.

I've made it a few times, with different variations. Last time, I made it as-is (3 eggs instead of 4 bc my pie crust wasnt too deep) and it was AMAZING.

The only reason I did not give it 5 out of 5 is because tthe recipe calls for canned and fozen! Always go with fresh!! I never even tried it with canned or frozen, tasted amazing with fresh ingredients! Is a bit greasy so next time I will cut down the butter.

Excellent, easy quiche recipe!  I made a "healthy" version with olive oil instead of butter, egg whites, and low fat cheese.  I also used fresh mushrooms, which I sauteed with the onions.  I ended up with too much of the milk/egg mixture -- I will cut back on this next time.

This was really really good!  I've never made quiche before and this came out perfect!  I didn't have the lemon herb soup, so I used lemon pepper and some Italian herb seasoning.  I didn't have green onions either, so I used sweet onions...I also used colby/jack cheese.  LOVED IT!  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks!

I have made this quiche many times and it is fabulous.  The only thing that I alter, is to use fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  This is a great go to recipe for brunch, lunch or dinner.

IMPORTANT! The recipe is delicious, however, the quiche has never taken me under an hour to took, which when I first made it timed it just right for some guests to arrive as it came out of the oven. The guests were on time but the pie was 20 minutes late. Otherwise it was perfect though i only used the recipe as a base and added my own different vegetables. It needed more salt, but that was my own preference, not my guests, so it was perfect with an extra dash on top!

I LOVED this! I used this recipe as a base for my first ever quiche! I added 4 cloves of garlic (we really like garlic at our house), used fresh spinach, and omitted the mushrooms. I added precooked bacon instead, and it was great! I also used 4oz of mozarella and 4oz of shredded mild cheddar for the cheese mix. The feta added a great taste as well! 
I always play with spices, so in the egg mixture I added a little red pepper flakes, basil, and oregano. Thank you so much for the great recipe!

Made this especially for my vegetarian daughter but husband also tried it. Big success. I followed the recipe fairly close although I didn't use as much spinach as called for.  I added one extra egg and used some a Mont. Jack/Colby mixture for the cheese with additional cheddar added.  Will make again!

Very forgiving.  Used this as a base and have made it with many different fillings.  Loved it with black olives, red onions, spinach and feta.

I made this quiche and another old favorite yesterday for a luncheon with 6 friends.  My old fav turned out perfectly, but this new spinach quiche did not set, even after 1 hr.  The only things I changed was cutting down on the butter and using 1 tsp of garlic - that's it.  I see another reviewer used half the milk and only 2 eggs.  I have never had a quiche fail but this one certainly did.  Don't know what happened...

Outstanding, I thought it was just a little heavy on the butter, so next time I will cut that back a little.  Made with regular feta and fresh mushrooms since I had them on hand - still wonderful!  I think it could even do without the pie crust, but no matter what, it was a huge hit!

Definitely one of my favorite recipes on Allrecipes.com :) I agree with the other reviewers, only add 1 tablespoon of butter. I added, spinach w/ arugula & baby bella mushrooms fresh and sauteed it in the garlic and onion as the original recipe. Absolutely delicious!

this was my second attempt at making a quiche and I was really happy it turned out! I ended up having leftover egg and milk so I think that made a bit of a difference in the traditional "quiche" sense but the spinach and cheese filling was AMAZING!

This is a very good basic quiche recipe. It is flexible to add your own ingredients. I made this twice before I submitted my review.  My family doesn't like feta...no problem....just use whatever you like. Each time I varied the recipe due to taste and what I had on hand.

The only reason I gave 4 rather than 5 stars is because of the portioning of the recipe. I made as directed however, I split it between two regular 9 inch pie plates because I don't have a deep dish pan and I'm glad I did. (especially since we now have left-overs) I don't believe the filling would have fit in one pan and I'm not sure I would have liked the filling that thick. Splitting it worked great. The taste was delicious and the preparation was very easy. I omitted the mushrooms because I don't care for them. I think artichokes would be good or I may try substituting broccoli for the spinach next time. The onions & garlic added alot and I loved the feta cheese. Also for ease, I used the Pillsbury refrigerated pie crusts. This was my first time making quiche and I was very pleasantly surprised.

This quiche was really good. The only thing I didn't like was that it was very greasy. Next time I will try using 1/4 cup of butter instead of 1/2 cup. The flavor was awesome though and was very filling.

made this quiche last night and it was phenomenal!  my first time ever making quiche and i'm not one that actually likes to cook but this recipe was super easy to follow and quick to throw together. i will be making this dish for one of my next family/friends get together one small note is that the egg and milk mixture didn't all fit into my deep dish pie crust but maybe the pie crust itself was smaller than usual.

I made this quiche for the first time, It turned out GREAT! The feta cheese really adds some flavor. I actually used fresh mushrooms and spinach instead of can and frozen ones. Will try again with goat cheese, my favorite.

This tasted amazing as is.  That said, I would lessen the butter next time just so I can live with myself after eating it, because it is a bit rich. . .

I made this a second time with 1/2 the butter and it was just as delicious.  yum!

I used 2 tblsp butter and thru in some diced ham. I did not put all of the spinach mixture into the pie crust. I agree with other reviewer who suggested might be better to split spinach mixture into two quiche. Looks beautiful, smelled fabulous, and tasted wonderful. Thank you.

This was a great quiche!  I was concerned about the amount of butter but it gave the crust a great taste and texture contrast to the eggs, cheese, etc.  My husband has never been a fan of quiche but he LIKED this.

I didn't have a pie pan so I just used mini muffin tins, and ommited the crust to make it a little more healthy. Quick, easy, relatively healthy and delicious!

Thank goodness other reviewers warned me that there is WAY too much filling for 1 quiche.  I had just the right amount for 2 regular pie crusts.  It made 2 perfect quiches following the directions above.  I did only use 1/4 cup of butter which turned out just right - not oily at all.  I also used regular feta and added a dash of tyme and basil.  I only salted and peppered once.  I also baked the crust for 5 minutes prior to cooking, but I really think it made the crust a little too brown.  You won't be dissapointed with this recipe.

Fantastic!  I made this for a brunch this past weekend, and the girls devoured it.  The only thing I did different was used 8 oz. of fresh mushrooms ( I don't like canned) sauteed with the garlic & onion, and used not nearly that much butter.  I also only had a 4oz package of the feta cheese, but it still had a wonderful flavor.  I had a little too much egg/milk mixture, but not a whole lot.  Not enough for a whole other quiche.  This recipe is a keeper.  I wish I could give it 6 stars.  Thank you for sharing.

This quiche was absolutely delicious, although I didn't really stay faithful to the recipe at all! I used only 2 Tbsp. butter, and sauteed the garlic and onion with a head of fresh broccoli. I also put in fresh sausage from my local farmer's market, which really made it amazing! I didn't have any feta, so I just threw in a handful of taco cheese and a couple handfuls of mozzarella. I mixed all these ingredients into the egg mixture before I added it to the pie crust. Excellent recipe - thanks!

Wow, how yummy and beautiful looking too to serve at a party. The feta cheese is obvious but not overwhelming. This was a wonderful item to serve my vegetarian friends.

This is a great basic recipe for a first timer. I took several readers advise..In a nutshell this makes two quiches (add extra egg and @ 2 oz extra milk), do not add salt, squeeze excess water out of spinach, use 4 tablespoon butter, prebake crust for 5-7 minutes, chop feta into finer crumbles with knife, used sharp cheddar, I added 1 thick slice of deli ham cubed, vidalia onion, celery, cuban peppers, red peppers & green peppers. This was  a great hit and it is so easy to add your own flavors to it. It also reheats well.

A very good quiche!  I turned this recipe into a kale quiche by substituting one finely chopped large bunch of kale for the spinach and leaving out the mushrooms simply because we didn't have any.  To accommodate for the lack of mushrooms I needed to add another egg and more milk to fill the crust.    It is a welcome addition to my recipes, thank you for submitting!

As many reviews there are on this I wasnt going to post anything BUT..I wanted to share my thoughts on this recipe.  When you go to the store and pick out the Spinach, check the Ounces on the package because I didnt and realized I used 14 Oz instead of 10.  My Quiche was great but because of MY error it was WAY TO SPINACHY :)

WOW!  Why I never thought to put feta in a quiche is beyond me!  Absolutely fabulous!  As stated by others, this recipe is very forgiving and flexible.  I omitted the mushroom soup, used about 2 tbsp. butter, used evaporated milk in place of the milk and skipped mushrooms only because I had none and it is OUTSTANDING! Thanks Bailey!

This was excellent!! I didn't read the reviews, and I used the full amount of butter, but I could definitely see myself cutting the butter in half next time. Overall, the flavors worked well together and the result was extremely tasty! I also loved that it took no time to prepare. Definitely a keeper!

Wow!  This is awesome!  I believe this is my favorite recipe on this site.  Based on other reviews, I only used about 2 tbsp butter and 3/4 cup milk.  I didn't have garlic and herb feta, so I used regular feta and added some basil, oregano, thyme and fresh garlic.  And I left out the mushrooms because my kids and I don't like them.  My kids still didn't like it because of the feta, but everyone else loved it.  I took some to work and several people asked for the recipe.

This recipe is perfect as is! But - if you want to make it healthier, you can eliminate the cheese and add some other veggies. I added red pepper.  The whole family loved it!

The 1st time, I followed the recipe.  Then 2nd time, I used 75% less fat cheese and low fat feta to cut some calories down.  Both quiche tasted soooo yummy!

I love this recipe.  It was my first quiche, and it was wonderful.  I had to skimp on a few ingredients (like the 6 oz. garlic herb feta cheese and 4.5 oz canned mushrooms) because they came in smaller packages than what the recipe called for, but it turned out just fine.  The quiche came out with a lot of excess moisture, but other than that, it was perfect, and so flavourful.

First time I had made quiche. Excellent and easy recipe. Would have been a 5-star, but I took others' suggestions and adjusted the ingredients. Used 3 eggs, 3/4 cup milk, 2 cloves of garlic, 3 Tbsp. of butter, 1/2 pckg of spinach, and 1/2 the cheeses. I used plain feta and sauteed fresh mushrooms with the onions and garlic. I also baked the pie crust 5 minutes before filling the shell. I forgot the salt & pepper (oops!) but never missed it!  Next time, I will reduce the butter even more and leave out the garlic (it added nothing to it). But it's definitely a keeper! I felt like a culinary expert, making this dish.

This was my first quiche I've ever made and it was a huge hit.  The whole thing was gone!!  I did follow the advice of others and really cut out most of the butter.  I also fried and diced a few slices of bacon to add.  It was so delicious.  I can't wait to make again...which I will because like others have noted...there was plenty of filling left over.  I did cheat and buy a frozen pie crust...but it still turned out awesome.

I'm not a big fan of eggs, but the garlic and cheese make this a total winner! I didn't have the Feta, but will definitely give that a try next time cause it would make this a six-star dish! Next time, I will bake the crust for a few minutes before putting the mixture inside - to keep the crust from getting soggy. Otherwise, FANTASTIC. Part of my recipe repetoire now!

This was a delicious quiche!  I followed the advice of others and halved the butter (adding a little olive oil), fresh mushrooms and instead of using 4 eggs I used 2 plus the equivalent of 2 eggs but just the whites.  My 6-yr-old daughter gobbled up two big pieces!  My only problem was that the bottom of the crust was mushy.  Next time I'll drain the spinach better, let the ingredients cool a little more before adding to the pie crust, and will also heat the crust for a few minutes before adding the mixtures.  I might even mix things up and add artichokes ...  Overall this is an easy, flavorful quiche!  Thank you!  :)

I followed suggestions by Julie S. and added bacon (previously cooked in microwave) to the spinach mix and was wonderful.  Did precook the crusts for about 5 minutes.

You deifnately need to make two pies. I made two and added eggs and I still wasnt happy with it. I think it needed more eggs. There was no fluffy egg, but it still tasted great and the famiyl loved it!

Really Delicious, but you have to substitute real mushrooms for the canned ones. It's easy enough. Just slice' em up and put them in the pan with the onions. I also subbed heavy cream for half the milk for a bit richer flavor. It turned out beautifully, the perfet consistency, and was easy to serve after cooling for 15 minutes.

LOVED IT!!!! I am a big fan of quiche so I'm rather picky. I took other's advice and did 3 tbls of butter which is efficient. It was still a little greasy on the bottom of the crust, even after baking it in the oven for 7 minutes as the other reviewers suggested. I only could only find regular feta in the store, so I added a dash of oregano, basil, and parsley, which was yummy. I didn't have enough spinach, so at the last minute, I added ham, which ended up being my favorite part!! You MUST add ham to this! Good thing my husband and I always have those big chunks of ham in our freezer.

This was the first quiche I ever made and it came out perfect and had a great taste!   And I only strayed from the original recipe just a little – only added half the cheddar cheese and I used fresh mushrooms as opposed to the caned ones and I used plain feta and just added a little more garlic.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!! :)

I used half of a 10-oz package of frozen spinach, half of the Cheddar cheese, 1 tablespoon butter, 3/4 cup milk, and omitted the mushrooms. For the pie crust, I used my own recipe and baked it for 10 minutes before adding the filling and baking for another 55 minutes. The filling barely fit into my regular 9-inch pie pan.  The quiche was very tasty, and my brother, who doesn't even like spinach, enjoyed it.  Next time I will try adding crumbled sausage or diced ham, but the quiche is still delicious without meat.

I am all about this recipe!!! I found it simply delicious the way it is, and it is fun and easy to add your own steps (like some Jimmy dean sausage, cooked first... OR Gorgonzola... I also add extra mushrooms due to peference). Easy to make, impossible to screw up!

I took the author's advice of adding and subtracting to my taste and found this to be a really great base recipe. I used olive oil in place of butter to saute the onion and garlic. I also added an extra clove of garlic because I'm addicted to the stuff. Instead of canned mushrooms, I opted to buy fresh, chop them finely and saute them. I pretty much eyeballed the cheese and added a few good shakes of hot sauce along with the pepper in the eggs. Put it all in a very simple crust recipe I'd found online and it was fantastic! I also realized as I was starting to fill up the pie crust that I didn't have enough room for 4 eggs and milk but that's my fault because I was using a tart dish that's probably only 8 inches. I made do with 3 eggs and 3/4 cup of milk and I didn't feel like it ended up being too dense so if your space is limited, don't worry too much about decreasing liquid.

This was absolutely wonderful.  My very un-adventurous husband ate it up and asked for seconds.  I made it without a crust by spraying the pie pan first and it came out perfectly.  I had fresh spinach, so I blanched it muself and chopped it.  I had fresh mushrooms too, so I sauteed them with the onions.  I cut the butter down to 2 TBS, which was plenty.  And I followed other advice that this was a large amount, so I made 2 pies instead of one.  Really fabulous!!

I used the deep dish frozen pie crust from Marie Callenders. I also used fresh ingredients instead of frozen/canned. Oh, and I think swiss is better.

Awesome quiche! I used fresh spinach and cooked it down with the onions and garlic and substituted black olives for the mushrooms (not big mushroom fans in the house). I also used mozerella cheese instead of of feta.....I've also used swiss instead. Fab! Very versatile! Thanks for sharing!

This was delicious and so easy!  I changed a lot and this recipe was very forgiving: I only used 1tbsp butter. I left out garlic. I used fresh spinach (torn into small pieces) and added broccoli. I had regular feta, so I added basil, sage, thyme, and rosemary for flavor. I only used half the feta and 3/4 the cheddar called for. I baked for 45 minutes total.  I was worried because this was my first quiche and I changed so much, but my boyfriend and I LOVED it!!! I will be making this again for sure! Maybe playing around with different veggies next time.

Absolutely delicious! Great creaminess and spice / flavor from the feta cheese. Definitely in my recipe rotation, especially since my 2-1/2 year old enjoys this quiche.

Fantastic! I served this for Christmas brunch for my daughter who's a vegetarian along with the Clark's quiche (also from this site). Both were a big hit but this one stole the show. Everyone was begging for the single remaining piece. It was wonderful.

I used fresh spinach and fresh mushrooms, and also added a red bell pepper to the mix. i first sauteed the onions and garlic in a little butter and a touch of olive oil, and then set them aside in a bowl. then i cooked the mushrooms and red bell pepper, and cooked down the spinach. i added that to the bowl and mixed. then added the cheeses. i prepared two pie tins with crusts, spread half of the mixture in each. i used 8 eggs in total, and still only 1 cup of milk. i split that between the pies and it made the perfect amount. otherwise followed recipe as stated. thanks alot!

This was an easy recipe. I substituted fresh spinach and wilted it when I sauteed the onions and garlic. I added fresh mushrooms and added an extra egg. I also divided it between two pie crusts.. Next time I will make it without the crust to see how it holds up. My family loved it and I will definitely make this one again. I want to try it in large muffin tins so I can freeze individual servings to have at a moments notice.

One of the best quiches I've made! Because I live at high elevation, I only used 3 eggs and 3/4 cups of milk. I also just used reduced fat plain feta cheese because I had it in the fridge.

I tried this recipe without the piecrust and, instead, mixed all the ingredients together and poured the mixture into large muffin tins.  The baking time was pretty much the same and the finished product was great.  The muffin tin idea wasn't mine.  It was actually recommended by another reviewer.  Great idea!  And each muffin makes 1 serving.  I freeze them and use them for lunches during the day.  Also, I later tried the recipe with frozen artichoke hearts (thawed and chopped) instead of spinach.  I thought it was very good -- but then I also like artichoke hearts!

It was really good except I had too much to fit into one 9inch crust. Maybe would have been better fit into two 7 inch crusts? I'll try that next time.

Lovely quiche. I make only one, minor change, I take about 1 teaspoon of dijon mustard, and smear it around the bottom of the pie crust before adding spinach mixture.  Just adds a little tang, which we love!

This is a great meal!  Depending on the size of the pie crust (and if you purchase one as opposed to making one), the mixture doesn't all fit inside the pie crust, so I slightly decrease the ingredients so that it will fit.  I usually add more mushrooms and less spinach as well, and get compliments when doing this.  Overall a great dish though!

Made this recipe last weekend for a group of friends, and they all loved it (even the one that never touches vegetables!). I added a diced tomato for additional color and vitamins, and it fit in the mixture perfectly. NOTE: PREPARE THIS IN A VERY LARGE SKILLET! I had to move the mixture into a larger skillet when it became clear the "medium skillet" described in the recipe wouldn't be big enough.

This recipe is fantastic! I followed the advice to bake the pie shell for 5 minutes first, and as a result the quiche was not soggy. Thank you :) I will be saving this one.

Very EAZY to make. Use a deep dish for sure.I used Mrs. Smith pie crust. I used x lg eggs and could have use 2 less eggs. I add nutmeg to it and doubled the recipe to freeze one for later. A big hit for the veggie lover in our family. I also used fresh mushrooms and froze chopped spinach.

This came out great! I made a few minor changes: I used fresh spinach and fresh mushrooms instead of frozen. I only had regular feta on hand so I used that instead. This was easy to make and everyone really loved it!

I prebaked the crust for 10 minutes and used chopped ham and mozzarella instead of mushrooms and feta and I only used 4 tablespoons of butter instead of 1/2 cup.  This turned out fantastic, my whole family loved it!

The basic recipe was wonderful as other reviewers have said. The mixture of cheeses as well as textures with the onions, spinach and mushrooms was divine. The measurements were a little off (as other reviewers have said as well), this however worked to my advantage as I had to make 14 quiches for a brunch of 105, yesterday. It looked beautiful as it was being served, so thank you Bailey for sharing. Things I changed as I was working it:  Lessened the butter and added a little olive oil while sauteing the onions; Added a bouillon cube and garlic powder as I was sauteing the spinach to lessen it's moisture level; Used garlic powder instead of cloves of garlic; Did not use any extra salt as I felt that the cheese added enough saltiness to the dish and finally I pricked the defrosted pie crust with a fork before browning it in the oven and baked it for 6 minutes before adding the filling.

Delish! I also divided this recipe into 2 pie crusts.  Very cheesy and tasty.  Couldn't find the herbed feta so I used regular and added my own herbs.  Used fresh mushrooms.  A new easy favorite!

Made this this morning, it was so good. I love spinach, but only in moderation. So many recipes like this have so much spinach that it becomes the only thing you taste. That was not the case at all with this. I didn't use the mushrooms or onions, cause I have picky eaters (myself included), and only used 3 eggs intead of 4, but it turned out so great. Insanely simple, can't wait to try it again.

As another reviewer mentioned, this is a great jumping off recipe to make to changes to! I added cooked diced potato to the mixture of onion, garlic, and frozen spinach. I also added chopped broccoli florets. I adjusted the egg mixture to only 3 eggs, as my veggie/cheese filling was more than the original recipe called for. Great clean-out-the-fridge veggie quiche recipe!

Delicious!  This is a good basic quiche recipe, and as in the description, it is infinitely flexible.  I took what I had, canned and fresh spinach, cheddar and parmasan cheese, put those into the mix with sautéed garlic and onion, and then topped it off with slices on fresh heirloom tomato and more cheese.  I baked it for 40 minutes and let it cool atop the stove.  This quiche was better than what I can get at the local bakery, and very moist!  I would make sure you don't overcook it.

Wonderful! I have never made Quiche before and was so surprised at how wonderful this was. I used 2 Tbl butter and no crust to cut down on calories and it was perfect! I also used fresh mushrooms that I sauted with the garlic and onions. I will make this often!

This is an awesome dish.  I took it to work for a potluck and had to pass out the recipe to other people because they loved it.  I did like other recommendations and used 2 pie crust, baked the crust for a few minutes so that it wouldn't be soggy. This was so easy to make, I thought quiche was more complicated.

This was wonderful! I took some of the suggestions from the reviews: 1) I baked the pie crust for 5-7 minutes before I added the ingedients 2) I used 4 oz of herbed feta cheese and about 3 oz of colby jack (we didn't have cheddar) 3) I used about an ounce of butter and a little bit of olive oil 4) I added a few slices of crumbled bacon  I'd never made quiche before, although I'd tasted it. Easy recipe...I will definitely make this again!

This was my first try at a quiche.  This recipe was very easy.  I used fresh spinach and fresh mushrooms.  I cooked the spinach in a bit of water before I did anything else.  I then cooked the onions and mushrooms together then added the spinach and cheese.  I didn't have any feta on hand so I simply skipped it.  I also halved the butter.  This turned out much better than I had expected and my husband LOVED it.

This is a very good base quich recipe.  Make it like this or switch it up.  I like using the same basic recipe but using some sauteed sweet onion and sun dried tomatos with the feta cheese.  Be sure to cook the pie crusts for a few minutes first so their not mushy.  Good stuff!

I have made this a number of times and it is great. I would, however, recommend baking the pie crust for about 8 minutes so it holds the filling better. Also, the filling makes enough for 2, so make 2 quiches. Let the second one cool, then freeze it. What I do after it is frozen solid is vacuum seal it. Works great.

Following advice, I changed quite a bit. Used cream, not milk; about 2 cups to 4 XL eggs was the ratio. Sauteed minced onion in butter, added well drained spinach, fresh mushrooms (not canned) and some chopped, seeded tomato. Seasoned with nutmeg, salt, and white pepper. That makes 2 8" pies that serve 16, or 8 each pie. (I made this as a crustless quiche to reduce calories). Yum! Tip: Start the oven very hot, then reduce to prevent overbrowing of the top. Result was 5 stars, but I'm giving the recipe as written 3, because I had to change so much.

I thought the flavors of this were very good but agree with another reviewer that is more like a Spanakopita than a quiche.  I will make again but next time will divide filling into two pie crusts and then double the egg mixture.  I will also probably mix the eggs and mixture before putting in pie pan.  Flavors were very good just hoping for an eggier texture.

Delicious!  I made two.  For one, I threw in 7 oz of chopped ham on the bottom.  My husband said it's one of the best meals he's had in a long time.  :D  It turned out lovely last night.  I microwaved it for 5 min at 50% power.  The other I added seeded tomatoes and reheated in the oven at 250 for 15 minutes(?).  Mmm, very good.  Always make sure to cook and drain your veggies prior to adding to the quiche and layering sliced/shredded cheese on the bottom helps keep the quiche from getting soggy.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made it this morning for brunch.  It was great.  I left out the mushrooms and prebaked the crust so it wouldn't get soggy.  Other than that, didn't change a thing.  Lots of people said it made enough for two quiches but it made one deep dish pie pan perfectly.

Very forgiving is right. I have never made a Quiche in my life. I only had some of the iingredients on hand. I didn't have mushrooms or onions (or the feta.) I took those out. I used this as a base or a guide, if you will. It was awesome!! Thank you!

This quiche was so delicious.  I rummaged through the freezer and found out I didn't have any spinach so I used zucchini instead.  It is very forgiving and a great basic recipe for quiche.

I love this recipe!  I made it twice this week alone, so I could use up the extra pie crust.  I did replace the mushrooms with diced ham, but otherwise stayed true.  Delicious!  You'd hardly think it was packed with iron-rich spinach!

I made this according to the reviews and eliminated the butter.  I used a bag of frozen spinach, defrosted and squeezed it do death lol. Then I sauted the onions, garlic and mushrooms in olive oil, added the spinach after a bit.  This did make two pies, which I usually make my own but for this time I did buy them already made:(  I would definitely bake the pie crusts for about 8 minutes before putting anything in it.  My dad ate half of one pie lol!

This is the most AMAZING recipe I've ever used!  Every time I make this my husband and I end up eating every little bit.  And it's super forgiving like others have said.  I always use fresh spinach and add crumbled bacon (this makes it fantastic).  Also I never have feta cheese on hand when I make this so I usually substitute with Mozzerella.  Oh and I always double the recipe and make an extra for the freezer.  Thanks so much!!

Wow!  I hate spending time and money on quiche ingredients then be disappointed when it turns out bland and dry.  This was one of the best!  I used monterrey jack instead of cheddar cheese; 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk; fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  It was so good, but what can you expect with a stick of butter! Loved this and will make again!

Flavour was very nice but the mixture definitely does not fit in one deep dish pie shell!!! I would cut down the milk as well as someone else's review suggested since the consistency was a little to "wet" for my taste.....but my guests seemed to really enjoy the taste so I'll try it again!

Great recipe! Be sure to use a DEEP DISH pie crust so all ingredients will fit.  Allow 20 min of cool down before serving to increase thickness.

Yummy, but like others, I divided the filling between 2 pie shells. Like everything else these days, even the frozen pie shells have been downsized.

This was excellent. I made a few adjustments and it was a hit! Instead of butter I used about 1 tbsp of olive oil. Instead of the feta cheese I used about 1/4 cup of herb and garlic cream cheese mixed in with the onion and garlic mix. It sort of melts a bit. Then I sprinkled mozzarella cheese on top and put the quiche in the oven. This recipe also made enough for two pies so I put 4 eggs per pie and just split the spinach/onion mix in half. Very good...will definitely make again!

Made this for Valentine's day breakfast.  Used fresh spinach from the garden and cojita cheese (had it in the fridge).  I also added a few strips of baby peppers that were in the fridge.  It was really good.

THIS WAS SO GOOOD!! I made mine without the crust...only because I'm on a diet..gotta watch those calories:) I normally don't care for quiche without crust, but the filling was so tasty, that I actually really enjoyed it. One of these days, I'll try it again with the crust. Thanks for sharing!

I made this for a work function today and it was a smash hit! Everyone loved it. I sauted fresh spinach about 3/4 of a 9oz bag in olive oil and added oregano and basil to the egg mixture. Turned out great. The bake time was right on. Excellent.

Great, great recipe.  I follwed the directions exactly as written with the exception of fresh mushrooms for canned and baking the crust to "firm" it up.  Adding crumbled bacon or diced ham would make this even better I think. This is a relatively inexpensive meal to make and will be a staple in my recipe box from now on.  Thank you!!!

SO good - I earned serious kudos from father-in-law for this recipe! The taste was very elegant and different with the flavored feta -texture came out perfectly - not runny at all (I scaled back the butter to about 3 1/2 tablespoons), added some chopped ham since we ate this as a "breakfast for dinner" meal, along with Country Brunch Skillet potato dish (w/out adding the eggs it calls for.) I look forward to making this again!

I've been making this recipe for about 2 years now...it's EXCELLENT!!  The only thing I do differently is allow the veggie cheese mixture to cool slightly and add the egg/milk mixture to it instead of pouring it over the veggies in the pie crust.  Additionally, I've found that it's enough to make two quiche's.  Even my kids love this!!

This quiche is very good.  I doubled the recipe to have a spare quiche and I'm glad I did.  I used 10 oz. fresh spinach, sauteed, for both quiches and subbed sauteed red pepper for the mushrooms since I didn't have any.  I put in a bit less cheese, a lot less butter than was called for and one less egg (that was all I had) but it was still delicious.  We also used Sargento cheddar and bacon Bistro blend cheese.  That little bit of bacon was lovely in this dish!  I would definitely make this again.

Super yummy and easy to make! This was the first time I'd made a quiche and I was surprised how simple it was. I followed one of the comments which advised turning the batter into two pie shells and thus doubling the recipe. In these economic times, what a savings!

This recipe is really, really good! My only issues with it were already what other reviewers have said-I bought an already made 9 inch deep dish pie crust, but the filling was definitely too much. Fortunately, I had two crusts and split the contents into each.  I also used fresh sliced mushrooms, which possibly made the filling more liquid.  I did allow the mushrooms to cook a little longer in the pan with the onions.  The feta cheese and cheddar together made such a wonderful flavor! It was tangy and delicious!  I think this quiche is definitely a keeper! Thank you for the recipe!

Great recipe, exceptionally flexible with ingredients which is good because I like extra cheese.  It does make 2 pies however.  I would suggest two regular 7" pies.  I tried the deep dish, but the were a little too deep.  Also I suggest to put the last layer of cheese about 10 or 15 minutes before the end as opposed to 10 or 15 after they first go in.  Also this freezes great.  I cut it into quarters and it makes a great meal when I am short on time.  Just pop it in the microwave and insta-quiche.

Good recipe but needs some changes.  You can use little or no butter (I used PAM) to saute the onion and garlic.  1/2 c is just way too much.  I cut the eggs and milk in half or else it would've overflowed.  If you're not a fan of stronger cheeses, skip the feta and just use cheddar.  You can definitely change the other ingredients to your taste - mushrooms, onions, tomatoes, etc.  Very adaptable recipe.  Also, pre-bake the crust 5 minutes to prevent a soggy bottom.

Waaaayyy too much feta. I'm rating this according to the printed recipe. I wish I would have just put half the feta in - would have rated much better. I did't use the whole amount of butter and it was plenty. The crust was crispy and everything baked perfectly. I used fresh spinach and added a little bacon. I do like feta...just not that much. Very overpowering and salty.

This quiche was marvelous, though I took some others' advice, the ingredients really do make enough for two 9 inch pie crusts, as long as you add an extra egg or two.  We all loved it, it was awesome!

Very tasty and easy to make.  I made two quiches as suggested by other readers and increased eggs to 6 instead of 4.  If you make two pies, decrease the cooking time, mine were a little over done but family still thought yummy!

I cut down on the spinach, added smoked turkey sausage and fresh sauteed mushrooms. Like others suggested, I made two regular-sized pies, but one was a little thin. Next time I will just make one deep-dish. Very good.

I thought this was great. I took the advice of others and used olive oil instead of butter and 1/2 a cup of milk instead of 1 cup. Turned out perfect. Next time, to appease my husband, I will use a 8 oz of spinach and add some sausage to make it a little heartier.

This recipe is terrific and easy.  I did substitute canned/frozen for fresh products instead to give it a better taste and texture.  It was enough for 2 pie shells, so plenty for the family. I have passed this recipe on to many!

This was the first quiche I have ever made so I wasn't sure if I'd like it or not.  We loved it!  It has prompted me to experiment with all sorts of other ingredients.  It's such a forgiving recipe.  Add extras if you like, it won't ruin a thing!

I only gave this one 4 stars because of a few hiccups I had while making...the taste is 5 stars!  I found that the deep dish crust wasn't large enough to hold all the ingredients and spilled out leaving only half the egg mixture.  

Still turned out delicious and the feta was a great surprise to my guests that tried this!  I would almost say that you could split this mixture between two crusts and it would be great.  I'll have to try that the next time I make this.  

Also, for those that aren't fond of the bitterness of spinach (like me! LOL)...this recipe is perfect since it balances it out so nicely!  The only other thing I might change is using less butter :o)

I'm not usually a quiche fan, but this recipe is awesome!  My only recommendation would be to use less butter (I used about 2Tbsp) and I split this recipe into two pie crusts - I added ham to one and left the other vegetarian.  I made this at a birthday brunch and a get together for the girls and had rave reviews both times. Definitely a keeper!

This is the best quiche recipe I have ever made.  It is very moist and flavorful.  I used cheddar and Swiss cheese.  Also, next time I will use 3 eggs only, as there is not enough room in the pan for four.  I think the Feta cheese adds a lot of flavor to the dish.  I can't wait to have another piece tomorrow.

EDIT: I forgot to buy mushrooms and had to use what I had in the cupboard - All I had was artichoke hearts and let me tell you they were fantastic in this quiche. I'll never use mushrooms again. nom nom nom

If only there were a better word than yum... Everyone loved this quiche, the herbed feta added a great flavor. I followed the recipe exactly and it fit into a deep dish shell perfectly. Thank you so much for this one!!!

This was excellent!  When I told my husband what we were having for dinner, he said, "Eww."  He ended up eating half of the quiche!
I didn't use any butter, just sauteed everything with a bit of olive oil.  I also cut down the milk to 3/4 cup, and added some asparagus.

Thought this recipe was very good.  However, I only used 2 tablespoons of margarine and half a cup of milk and there was still WAY too much liquid for the Pet Ritz 9-inch deep dish pie crust that I used.  So much wet ingredients that I easily could have made another whole quiche.  Regardless, the end result was very tasty.  Next time I will make two quiches using the ingredients as noted in the original recipe.

Followed the recipe as is.  Excellent flavor and very easy to make!  I did season my spinach after it was drained just to add a little extra flavor.  Also cooked the pie crust for 5-7 min before actually using it.

Love Spinach Quiche!!!  This recipe is very forgiving!  I didn't have Feta on hand and so ommitted it and it was still fantastic!!!  One time making this I prebaked the previously frozen piecrust for about 15 min and that seemed to help it stay crisp.

I give this 4 stars because I didn't follow the instructions exactly. Yes, I adjusted it after reading some reviews.  Used 1/2 the butter, left out the mushroom (don't like them) added and egg a pinch of nutmeg and cayenne. I also prebaked the crust for about 7 minutes. Crust was nice. Forgot the Cheddar at the store, so I used Monterrey Jack. Couldn't find herb and garlic feta, either, so used plain. Probably would have been eve better with the extra spices, but even so, my book club couldn't stop complimenting me. That's always nice.

Amazing. Really simple. Used 4 oz of feta instead of 6 and an Italian mix of cheeses rather than the cheddar. Otherwise, followed recipes exactly as outlined. Highly Recommended!

I thought this quiche was good, but a bit too heavy in my opinion. I like something a bit lighter, but that is me.  That being said my family said it was excellent overall so I will give it 4 stars. I made a few changes: I used 2 cloves of garlic, not three. I used fresh mushrooms (would never use canned) and I sauted them with onion and garlic in butter. Called for a stick of butter, which I used, but I think that could be cut in half easily or not used at all--maybe olive oil would be just as good and less fattening. I also used regular feta cheese, not fond of all that garlic. My dish only fit half the egg mixture called for.  Maybe I will use 3 eggs and less milk next time--not sure? I guess if you have a bigger dish--10 inch-that might work. I cooked the 15 minutes, then topped with Cheddar, and cooked only about 30 minutes more in my oven.

Great recipe. I made four changes in preparation of this dish. First, I used only 2 tablespoons of olive oil to saute the onion and garlic instead of the recommended 1/2 cup of butter. Second, my market only carried 4oz containers of feta cheese so I used that amount instead of the recommended 6oz. Third, my husband is not a big fan of mushrooms so I omitted the them from the recipe. Finally, since I am a "cheesehead" from Wisconsin and have access to lots of types of cheese, I chose to top the quiche with a 4 year aged white cheddar. The quiche was wonderful. Thank you for this recipe.

This was a big hit at my party! I took the advice of other reviewers and cut down on the amount of milk used. Also, I used fresh spinach, and added some sauteed red pepper with it in one of pies. Delicious!

Made this again for our weekly work lunch and it was excellent.  Used 2 tablespoons of olive oil instead of the butter and didn't use as much milk for the eggs.  I put foil around the edge of the crust so it wouldn't burn.  Delicious - one of my favorite recipes.

I was scared because I have never made quiche before.  I acidentally made a couple errors but I think it actually helped the recipe.  I did the spinach mixture as intructed but found that I could not get the egg mixture to seep into the spinach while it was in the pie shell.  I ended up taking the spinach mixture out and combining with egg mixture in separate bowl then putting back in pie shell. Worked out much better.  I also reversed the baking instructions.  I baked for 40 min then put the cheese on top and baked for 15 min.  It came out perfect. The only thing my family suggested is next time I make two.  They wanted seconds and it was gone.

Wonderful. Used it for Easter and it was a hit with everyone. Got it partially ready the night before to save time. I used fresh spinach, sauted down, very good.

Excellent recipe! I made this for Easter and everyone enjoyed it. I used 2T butter and a dab of olive oil to saute the onion and garlic and fresh mushrooms. I also added one extra egg and just a half cup of milk. I used a combo of lowfat feta and sharp cheddar. I attempted to prebake the pie crust but it shriveled down into the bottom of the pie plate and I had to get out another crust! That trick didn't work for me but I was using a pillsbury ready made piecrust. Thanks for a terrific recipe!

Excellent!  I used cottage cheese instead of feta cheese.  I used half the butter and next time will try olive oil.  I also baked the shell for five minutes by itself first.  I used fresh mushrooms and cooked them with the onions.  I also used less cheese on top than it called for.  It made six servings.

I made this without the crust to cut on fat/calories. Eggbeaters in place of whole eggs- this is a perfect recipe for eggbeaters. Added a 16oz bag of spinach(thats what I had) a little less feta(thats what I had). The canned mushrooms didnt have any flavor so I will do fresh sauted next time. Overall though I liked it and will make it again.

Awesome!  We added all 8 oz. into the on accident...good choice!  We also used fresh mushrooms and sauted them with the garlic and onions.  We added sun dried tomatoes and black olives.  We then topped with Parmesan instead of Cheddar.  Unbelievable!!!

It's just that, spinach quiche.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It wasn't the best, nor was it horrible. It was a basic, good quiche -nothing more,nothing less.

This quiche is AMAZING. Everyone who tried it said its the most amazing quiche they have ever had.  It tastes exactly like spanakopita and it's perfect. I only used 3 tablespoons of butter though and that was more than enough.

Awesome! It did make a lot more than I anticipated, however, it was great for breakfast the next day. I used freshly sliced mushrooms rather than the can.

Great recipe!!! I made my own crust and did precook it for about 8 minutes. I do think I will add a little bacon to it the next time I make it.

Great recipe - any flavor of feta will work. I used Mediterranean.  I did not use ANY butter but used a couple tablespoons of olive oil just to brown the onions, garlic and mushrooms (chopped).  I really didn't even need to use that much olive oil because you can see the extra grease after this is reheated from the Cheddar and feta cheese.

I chose to make this recipe due to so many rating it so highly. It was the best quiche I've ever made and I've made many. I didn't use all that butter, just enough olive oil to cook the onions and mushrooms which were fresh. I couldn't buy the herb garlic Fetta so I used a herb one. Like other reviewers I found the egg mixture too much to fit in my large quiche dish. I think 2 eggs and much less milk would have been fine. The only change I'd really suggest is to make a double batch as everyone fought over the leftovers. Delicious and thanks for the best recipe I've found on this site.

This is a great recipe! I actually used the recipe as it is (less butter) and put all of it into two 9" pie shells. It worked out quite well because it was going to be way to much for just one. Also, make sure to let it cool for at least 20 minutes otherwise it will seem soggy.

This quiche was delicious and even better the next day. The only change I made was cut down the butter to 1/3 cup as suggested by others, also I never use canned mushrooms in anything, the taste and texture are horrible (my humble opinion). Instead I chopped up a large portebello mushroom and added it with the garlic and onion. YUM now that's what mushrooms are supposed to taste like. Will definitely make this again soon.

This was yummylicious!  One note of agreement with other reviewers. It does NOT need a cup of milk, I had to pour at least 1/4 to 1/3 of the milk/egg mixture down the drain b/c there simply was not room for all of it in the dish. I also added one extra clove of garlic and added a bit of garlic and onion powder. It was so good, my husband said it tasted like heaven!  Heats up well as a leftover too!

This was wonderful. I did make a few adjustments though. I used oil instead of butter and I used fresh spinach and mushrooms. I also did not add the feta cheese. My family and I enjoyed it and I will make it again.

Yum!  As stated this is a VERY forgiving recipe. I made several changes that worked very well: 2 tbs butter instead of 8 tbs.; I wilted fresh spinach--I eyeballed the amount as I wanted a lot of spinach; did not use a crust; did not use the mushrooms, but added in a cup of chopped leftover ham; only had plain feta on hand; used soymilk. I had enough for 2 so I used a glass pie dish and a metal 9-in cake pan. These cooked up much faster than the recipe called for and were set after cooking for about 35 minutes as opposed to total time of 50-55 min. called for in the recipe. Very yummy!

I've been searching for a good quiche recipe for ages.  I did however use 1/2 C half & half and 1/2 C milk, added a little crushed red pepper and prebaked the pie crust for abt 5 min.  Fabulous! I have had several requests for the recipe.

This was the first of many quiches that I have cooked and Imust say it was really tasty.  Had it warm from the oven on the first nightwith spinach salad and a sweet dijon mustard dressing.  Opened the fridge the next day and was greeted with the wonderful smells and so had it cold which tasted just as good.

*DELICIOUS*  I put some cheese on the bottom so it didn't get soggy.  Also I made a roux and added the spinach, and onions and I used mozzarella and cheddar.  I reduced the eggs to 2 eggs bc I could tell by looking 4 eggs were NOT going to fit in that crust!  Came out perfect and delicious!

I decided to make this on a whim...and didn't have all the called for ingredients but it still turned out GREAT!  I used the eggs, milk, spinach, onions, garlic and butter.  Added 7 sliced of precooked turkey bacon (diced) and diced red bellpepper (sauteed with the onions and garlic).  Then I just mixed everything together into one bowl tossed in a couple of handfuls of grated cheese, mixed well and poured into my pre-baked pie shell (I pre-baked it for 5 mins).  I cooked uncovered for 15 mins then tented some foil lightly over the top of the pie until the last 5 mins - removed to allow the top to brown jut a bit more and it came out perfect!  My friend asked if I bought it!  This is a great recipe for whatever you have on hand.  A keeper for sure!

Very good. I make several times a month. I changed a few things - fresh mushrooms and I add crushed red pepper. I also use whatever cheese I have on hand - it is good with shredded Italian mix. Very versatile recipe.

I only gave this 3 stars because I had to bake it for over an hour for it to be done which played havoc with my afternoon tea schedule. The flavor was good. I made several variations to the recipe based on previous reviews - used 1 tbsp. butter and 1 tbsp. olive oil to saute garlic and onion; used only 6 oz. of shredded cheddar cheese; no additional salt because the feta was so salty; only used 1/2 cup of milk and only used 1 egg plus 4 egg whites because I don't like the flavor of egg yolk. Definitely put this in a deep dish pie plate and allow plenty of time to bake. It is a good recipe with tweaking. It tastes just like spanokopita (Greek spinach pie).

I also used 1/2 cup of milk and split the mixture between two regular pie crusts. I sauteed the onions, mushrooms and spinach in olive oil as suggested by others and added some herbs for extra flavor. It was FABULOUS! Very easy to make!

This was super easy and my first pie that doesn't go from the freezer to the oven.  I skipped the mushrooms, used olive oil instead of butter (1/4 cup) and I put foil over the crust to prevent burning. I used 3 eggs and 1 egg white but the egg mixture overflowed so I'll reduce the milk next time.  I also plan to do a better job of draining the spinach because I suspect that the additional moisture accounted for less room for the egg mixture.  I brought this to Thanksgiving dinner and they loved it! It is a bit heavy with all that cheese so I think I'll try some low fat cheddar next time.

This recipe is TASTY! It's also the perfect easy quiche recipe to make your own. As is, it tends to be too large for a regular pie dish. I usually cut back the ingredients  and add chopped grilled chicken to make it more hearty. Sometimes if I'm feeling healthy I'll use less cheese, omit the butter and use olive oil. the baked cheese on top is the best part though as it adds a chewy almost crispy topping.

This is soooo yummy. I used fat free half and half instead of milk, fresh spinach and fresh mushrooms, Monterey Jack (i dont like melted Cheddar) crumbled bacon and sliced tomatoes on top. My husband wouldnt let me freeze the extra quiche that I made.

Wasn't a big fan of the mushrooms in the recipe but other than that, it was pretty good. Made a few changes by substituting the Cheddar cheese with Havarti and adding a layer of tomatoes on top as well.

This is the best quiche I've ever had! I couldn't find herb feta so I just added a little garlic salt and it is "exquisite" as my hubby says. I ended up making 2 pies, I added 2 eggs and 1/2 cup milk to make them full. I also added diced tomatoes to one after the first 15 minutes.  Absolutely wonderful!

very good.  I changed a few things by using Swiss instead of Cheddar, added some fresh dill and a pinch of nutmeg didn't add mushrooms and used half and half instead of milk.  This is a very forgiving dish and really hard to screw it up.... give it a try and use your imagination and you will end up with something delish...

I thought this recipe was just scrumptious(even though I limited myself to just taste it with a sliver!). I could have eaten the whole quiche...I used 3 eggs instead of 4, fat free half and half, reduced fat feta and reduced fat cheddar, I also sauteed the onions,garlic, and mushrooms in evoo instead of the butter. I also prebaked my shell for about 10 min. 350. Family loved this....thanks for the post!

The flavor is great--the herbed feta really makes a difference. I wouldn't make it with plain feta at all. My bottom crust was undercooked, though. I think if I prebake the shell a bit the quiche would turn out better.

Delicious.  But too much to fit in a (9" pie plate. It ran over under the crust, so it was difficult to get out in a couple of spots. Next time I'll use 2 8" ones.

Just made this yesterday and it turned out great! I made a few changes with the cheeses. I used Havarti Dill Cheese instead of the Feta, which has a sweet, creamy dill flavor to it and works great with the spinach. And instead of adding the cheddar after 15 minutes I used crumbled Brie, which made a great crust on top. Also, I didn't add the mushrooms and the top of the quiche was pretty big. I'd imagine you'd need to cut some milk or cheese to accommodate for a standard pie dish. Definitely a keeper - thanks for sharing!

Fantastic starter recipe. I made it without any butter (sauteed the garlic, onion and mushrooms in a bit of olive oil) and there was still dairy fat bubbling on the bottom when I took it out of the oven.  Also, my favorite quiche add-on is strips of roasted red pepper with the cheese on top.

I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe, unless you want TWO deep dish quiche. The only difference was I used 10 eggs and left everything else as is.  When I pulled them out of the oven I thought I overcooked them because of the browning on top, but the inside was SO moist and yummy I had to come back here and leave feedback.  I thank Bailey for posting this fabulous quiche - I will make it often, as it is now my FAVORITE!

This was a big hit at the brunch that I brought it to.  It was my first experience making quiche and everyone went bananas for it.  It's the kind of thing that's good the cheese lovers out there.  One thing:  the crust was very soggy.  I think I will use store-bought crust next time rather than making it myself.  Definitely a keeper!

This turned out excellent, but I only gave it 4 stars because I made quite a few changes.  I cut down on the butter, milk, and cheddar cheese.  I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  I increased the spinach to 16 oz., added an egg, and used 2 deep dish pie crusts.  The key, however, was the addition of sun dried tomatoes.  They "made the quiche" according to family.  A very good jumping off point recipe.  Easy too! Thanks.

The fam. loved it!  I accidently used 2 packs of spinach, but it was even better that way!  This meant that there was excess egg mixture.  Next time I think I might omit the mushrooms since half my family doesn't like them, and they didn't add much.

Based on reviews, I used vegetable oil instead of the butter, which made it a lot more healthy.  I also did not use mushrooms, just because I don't like the taste.  I also used a little more cheddar cheese.  The recipe turned out great, my whole family enjoyed it.

Absolutely delicious. Everyone was right, you can't mess this one up. I did add bacon and mushrooms and cooked the pie crust before filling. Next time though I would make 2 quiches from this recipe; one was too full and spilled over little while cooking. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

It was fantabulous. First Allrecipes recipe that made me actually sign up to review!

I used fresh spinach - chopped very fine. Loads of onions. Loads of garlic. Less cheese. Also stuffed in loads of blackpepper (I like this addition) & herbs. Made my own crust & baked it for around 10 minutes before adding in filling.

One piece will do per person, very filling.

PIG IN!

my (usually critical) siblings all did. a whole clean plate! woohoo.

I made this yesterday and it was really good. I gave it 4 stars becuse i can't imagine it would be nearly as good with canned mushrooms. I used fresh mushrooms and spinach. I added 3 more eggs and made it in a 9x 13 pan. No crust. Thank you

I suggest changing the name of this recipe to SINFUL Spinach Quiche. I made it for the first time this weekend and absolutely loved it.  Next time I will reduce the butter and milk, to reduce some of those delicious calories!!

I made three different quiche recipes for a baby shower brunch this weekend, this I have to say was the tastiest.  My husband, who hates spinach and mushrooms, loved the spinach filling.  He was so upset when he found out there were no leftovers.

This was my first attempt at making Quiche.  It came out great!  I changed the ingredients to lower the fat/calorie content.  I used egg beaters, light margerine, skim milk, low fat feta, & 2% cheddar (reduced to 1 cup total as others suggested).  The flavor was still excellent.  I would like to find a reducted fat pie crust recipe for next time..if such a thing exists:-)

Try this quiche--you won't be sorry. I made it for a bridal shower and everyone loved it. I personally don't care for quiche--but I even enjoyed it. It is very tasty!

Very good recipe. I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and less onion and butter than called for--the taste was excellent. I never would have thought to add that much feta to a recipe, but it was great!

This was my first attempt at quiche & it was delicious!  I am not a huge fan of feta cheese or mushrooms, but kept them in there for the family and I was not disappointed!

Outstanding!  I made many a quiche with my mother, but this was my first on my own. I made a few adjustments for what I had on hand and my own preferences but this recipe gave me a great guideline... I used mozzarella vs swiss, shallots/garlic vs onion, added grated carrots, 50:50 low fat milk to half and half vs milk alone.  Also, I left the butter out entirely sauteeing the shallot/garlic in a tbsp olive oil, and I used 3 whites and 2 yolks.  One thing I have to say is that I followed others advice and attempted to split the mixture into two pies... NOT a good idea.  My quiches, although they taste great, are pretty thin.  One big fat quiche would be more presentable for a potluck then a skinny minnie two.  Thanks again!!!

This was soo good.  I gave 4 due to my changes.  I only used two handfuls of real squished drained spinach.  I like it to be kind of eggy.  I only used a couple of handfuls of bacon bits, and used shredded emmenthal and cheddar cheese.  Threw in some pepper and nutmeg, & baked it for about 35 mins, and again it turned out awesome.

This is really good.  I varied the ingredients, using imitation crab and omitting the mushrooms.  Excellent.  Now I have something quick, easy and delicious for potlucks and get-togethers.

this was awesome. Better than the one my mom makes and it took half the time. I think it was the flavored feta that made all the difference. My pie shells were too small so it made 2 whole pies. I froze one after baking, we'll see how that turns out.

These were very good.  I left out the mushrooms because I just don't like them.  Instead of baking as a pie, I baked them in phyllo cups to serve at a brunch.  They didn't puff up so well, but still tasted great.

This recipe IS forgiving! I thought I had all the ingred. but didn't. In the end, I used 3 eggs, 4 oz of feta, 4 oz of mont. jack, a 6 oz bag of spinach, no mushrooms, and about 1/2 cup of milk. I precooked the crust for 5 minutes. It was very good, but   the leftovers were not. Will make it again! Thank you.

Yum! My family loves this recipe. I only used 1/4 C of butter and 3 ounces of garlic tomato feta. I omited the mushrooms. In the future I will make two at a time. It's beautiful and delicious.

I really enjoyed this quiche.  Made it crustless because I am not crazy about crusts.  Also omitted the feta because my husband does not like it (I could eat it feta right from the package) and mushrooms because I forgot to get them.  But all in all, was very good.  Had a nice light texture that I really enjoyed.

Very good. Will cut butter and cheese to half the amount next time. Did not have herb feta cheese.  Used plain and added 1 tsp Herbes de Provence seasoning and 1 tsp Italian Herb seasoning. Served this with a green salad to a couple of friends for lunch.  They raved about it. Both in looks and taste.

I'm not a big fan of frozen spinach but my husband loves spinach quiche so I thought I'd try this recipe.  Although I didn't care for it & was only able to eat a couple of bites, my husband devoured it and gave rave reviews.  Thanks for the recipe.

WOW, this was great!! Made this for dinner last night as I'm tired of the same old vegetarian dishes, even my meat eating husband like it. I used what I had left of my fresh feta cheese and cut back on some of the cheddar cheese.  It still was great.  Re-heated the next day for lunch and it was still moist and flavorful.
Thanks for the recipe.

I highly recommend this quiche for a great bruch or dinner meal.I love this recipe and will make this again and agian!!

This was delicious! I followed what others said and halfed the amount of butter. I also used those frozen garlic cubes which were great! I also did add less milk and one less egg. It came out great and not liquidy which I get sometimes with quiches.

Wow, was this awesome!!  I used fresh spinach in addition to the frozen spinach, and fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  I should have known better, because only part of the eggs and milk mixture fit in the quiche.  I fit what I could, and it baked fine, believe it or not!  I reduced the fat by using skim milk, reduced fat feta, and only 1/2 cup cheddar cheese.  Great adjustments!  I used 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/8 tsp. pepper in the cheese mixture, then 1/4 tsp. salt and a pinch of pepper in the milk mixture.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Great and easy recipe! This was my first quiche, and it turned out beautifully, with some modifications. I only used 1 tbsp butter and 1 tbsp olive oil to saute the onions and garlic. I used 3 eggs and 1/2 cup of milk. This fit really well into one 9-inch deep dish pie crust. I also only used about 1/2 cup of shredded cheese within the quiche and sprinkled just a bit more on top to bake off. Final product wasn't greasy or oily, but just perfect! Can't wait to make again.

I decided to try this recipe out b/c I had a ton of eggs to use up.  It turned out great! I followed the advice of the past reviewers... I used fresh mushrooms, only 3 tbs of butter, and by adding 2 more eggs, had enough filling to make 2 quiches. Next I'll try adding bacon, and making mini-quiches for a party. Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious, and reheats well.  My young children loved it.  Like others, I would cut the butter at least in half.  I used fresh mushrooms (vs canned) and added a few grates of fresh nutmeg.  The pie plate filled up and I had too much egg mixture at the end -- but used it to make a scrambled egg the next day.

I followed the recipe to the letter (didn't have time to read the reviews on cutting back on the butter), and somehow managed to have a cup of egg mixture leftover, even with a deep dish pan...I don't know how I managed that. I think next time I will use less butter and spinach as it was pretty oily but went over great at our Christmas Eve brunch. Was great as leftovers for several days after too! So easy, I will make it ahead of time.

I made this quiche last weekend.  It was very good.  I will definitely make it again.  I didn't have mushrooms, so I just left them out.  Quiche tasted great without em.  I did have too much filling for one pie crust.  I even bought a deep dish one.  So next time, I am going to buy regular size and I am willing to bet I'll have enough for two excellent quiches!

This is delicious!  I couldn't find herb and garlic feta so just used plain, and fresh mushrooms.  Only thing I would change is to cut
way back on the butter

Very good quiche...and very forgiving, just like it said!  I didn't have mushrooms on hand, so I omitted them.  I used only 1 TBS of butter with olive oil to saute the garlic. I added a small chopped onion and 1/2 a chopped red bell pepper.  I had a 5 oz. container of regular low fat feta, and added Wildtree Herbs' Garlic & Herb Blend to that.  I prefer a crustless quiche, so I baked this in my Pampered Chef round baker.  It came out excellent!  I'll definitely do this again!  I used low fat versions of cheese and milk.  Great, calcium rich recipe.  Thanks!

The quiche turned out great even though I had too much liquid in the deep pie shell (1 cup milk) and had to pour off some.  Next time I'll use 1/2 cup milk.

Sooooooooooo good... a few changes, though. I used only 3 tbsp unsalted butter (plenty!), a large yellow onion, some fresh spinach in addition to frozen (added this at the end just before pouring into crust), only 4oz feta, added 2-3oz ricotta (!!), fresh mushrooms, SKIM milk, kosher salt (always in cooking), added all the cheddar in with the mixture and topped (before any baking) with grated Parmesan instead, AND... drumroll, I combined both mixtures BEFORE pouring into the crusts (I also used 2 deep dish crusts for this recipe). This was absolutely amazing... I will be making time and time again!!

This recipe is very yummy! I love the addition of the feta cheese. I have made it with canned mushrooms and fresh mushrooms and the fresh mushrooms make it taste less salty. I crumbled up some italian sausage, cooked it and added it with the mixture to add some meat and it goes well with. Very good recipe - it is a regular in our house!

This was my first quiche.  I added a grilled, shredded chicken breast.  The feta gave it fabulous flavor.  I served it to my parents (mom being the quiche queen) and they both raved about it.  I will definitely be making this again!

This recipe was REALLY GOOD. I didn't have any cheddar on me so I used mozzarella instead.  It was still very tasty!  Easy to make as well.  I used 2 normal 9-inch pie shells and it was perfect!

I'm not a big "egg" dish person, but I tried this recipe for a family breakfast at Christmas, and it was wonderful!  I didn't have any feta on hand, so I substituted gruyere that I had in the freezer, along with the  cheddar cheese.  I cut back on the butter by a couple of tablespoons and used a traditional quiche/tart pan for baking.  The presentation was beautiful, and it tasted even better the next morning.  I'll be adding this recipe to my favorites.  Thanks, Bailey!

Made this for a brunch and it came out great. I followed alot of the other reviewer's comments. Definitely use less butter, I used 2 tbl instead of 1/2 cup and it was delicious.  Also I used fresh mushrooms and actually didn't have herb and garlic feta, but it still came out great.

What a great recipe. I followed it pretty close and used some of the suggestions left by other cooks. I added brocolli along with the spinach. I used one 10oz box of frozen spinach and about 1 1/2 cups of brocolli. I used swiss cheese instead of the feta and mixed it in with the spinach/brocolli mix before placing in the pie shell. I made two, one for me and one for my mother and she even ate a piece for breakfeast. This recipe is so easy and you can use your creativity to make it personalized.

I've misplaced my favorite quiche recipe, but this one looked similar enough to try and am I glad I did!  It was delicious and the texture was exactly to my liking.  I changed things up a bit...using chopped broccoli instead of spinach[tho I love it with spinach!] and swiss in place of the feta.  It didn't last the night!!!  Luckily, I got one piece before my 2 teenagers devoured the entire thing!  I don't suppose I'll need to turn the kitchen upside down looking for my old quiche recipe, huh?  I'm going to try this again next week with crumbled sausage in place of the spinach and add green and red peppers/monterey jack/cheddar.  Mmmm.

I made this for a reading group meeting.  Since I hade made a double recipe I had left an extra at home.  My husband devoured it at lunch time and when I got home from my meeting there was none left!  Out of 2 whole pies, I had one piece.  P.S My husband hates quiche!  You wouldn't know it by this one though!

I get so many compliments on this recipe, it is spectacular.  I cut way back on the butter, and use fresh sliced mushrooms instead of canned/jarred. make sure to get all the water out of the spinach.  Also i dont like eggy quiches, so i only use enough egg and milk to barely cover the top.  Make this quiche for guest, and they all of a sudden think your a brilliant cook.

Used all fresh ingredients, WAY less butter, changed from feta to blue cheese, and used a mashed potato crust.  Great base recipe for quiche!

Absolutely delicious.  The feta is a nice addition.  I made a homemade pie crust and this was so yummy as a brunch item amongst girlfriends for a playgroup.  The recipe was requested.

This was excellent and easy!!  The seasoned feta made it much more flavorful that using plain feta.  I replaced the mushrooms with artichoke hearts and added bisquick to the milk and eggs instead of using a crust.  By far, this is the best spinach & feta recipe I've seen.

Great recipe!!  I really enjoyed this.  I used reduced fat feta.  I just eyeballed how much cheese I wanted in it and I'm pretty sure I didn't come close to putting in as much as what the recipe called for.  Also, I mixed all the cheese in instead of sprinkling it on top.  I also used fresh mushrooms which I sauteed with the onions.  Finally, I put 3/4 of a packet of spinach.  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing.

This is one of the best quiches I've ever had!  My husband doesn't like spinach and even he loved it.  My filling was going to over flow, so I split the recipe into two pies.  Other than that everything turned out great!

Wonderful quiche!  I like to double the recipe, which makes enough for 3 pies.  I give away one pie and still have enough for plenty of great leftovers for us!

The combination of spinach and mushrooms with the feta and cheedar was very good.  Everyone at our company breakfast was impressed.  I will definitely make this again.

Excellent taste.  I used sun dried tomato feta cheese and fresh spinach (9 oz).  I also used only 1/2 stick of butter, and 1/2 cup of milk.  I couldn't pour all of the egg/milk mixture in because it would have overflowed, but it still turned out with just the right consistency.  Very flavorful.

Wonderful flavour.  I read the reviews first and cut down on butter, used half of the spinach, half of the mushrooms, 3 eggs and 3/4 cup of milk.  Filled a 9" pie crust.  Will certainly add to my favourite recipes - husband gave it "thumbs up" too!

Absolutely wonderful!!  I would not recommend making the spinach mix the night before.  I did and the butter hardened, making it hard for the egg mix to blend with it.  This is a really good recipe.  I made it on Sunday night/Monday morning and my husband and I ate on it all week.  Makes a great fast breakfast!

Taste wise this recipe definitely deserves 5 stars, but because of some mishaps during the preparation I only gave it 4 stars.  I wish I read the reviews before I made it.  I agree with others-1 stick of butter is too much.  My biggest problem, however, was that I couldn't fit all of the egg mixture into my pie crust (it was a 9 inch deep dish as the recipe called for).  Not only did it make a mess in my kitchen, but my oven is a mess too.  Then when I had to add the cheddar cheese the quiche overflowed into my oven even more.  I couldn't even add the entire amount of cheese.  I'm so glad the quiche tasted so good-it made me forget about the preparation disaster!

I made this one evening while my college sister was here with some of her girlfriends, and it didn't last. I was hoping for a little leftover for breakfast. But it was gone before it could even get it out of the baking dish. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is really good! But as others have said, don't use all of the butter that is directed. It will make you sick. Only half the butter, or as i used, margarine, is needed. Oh yes, and make sure you're pie crust is a deep dish pie crust! because if it isn't you'll have an overflowing quishe! :)

Simple and absolutely delicious!  Used plain feta and it was fine.  Most definitely use a deep dish pie crust!  I will be making this again and again.

This is fabulous!! The best quiche recipe I have ever tried! The first time I made it I used the full 10 oz. of spinach. The second time I made it I used a little less spinach (7-8 oz) and like it better. Other than that, I didn't change a thing, and it was very yummy!!

This was absolutely delicious.  I used tomato & basil feta cheese and replaced the milk with soy. I will use fresh muchrooms next time, but it was great with the jar mushrooms too.  All my meal needed was a salad and glass of red wine!

This was the belle of the ball.  Used fresh mushrooms sauted them in the butter with the onion and garlic.  Drained the butter and did not have the "too much butter" problem of other cooks.

This was the first quiche I've ever made and it was fantastic!  I took the advice of others and I ended up using 1 tbs. of butter and it turned out great!  It was still rich and very flavorful.  It also set up very nicely, was not runny or soggy.  A five star recipe!

I made this for our annual Valentine's Day brunch and it was a HUGE hit. I also used only 1/4 cup of butter and it turned out great.  I LOVE it and could eat it every day.  I used fresh mushrooms that I sauteed with the garlic and onion.  I will make this one again for sure!

I loved this recipe and so did my kids.  I used half the butter, and used canadian feta cheese, instead of the herb.  My 3 year old son usually hates eggs, but he ate a huge slice!  What a great way to get veggies.  I also used two 9" pie shells.

Wonderful recipe. I didnt use a crust. I did add fresh spinach and mushrooms so I had to cook it for a little longer. I also added more cheese than what it called for. Absolutely devine. All the changes was worth it. My son doesnt like quiche and he had seconds. Thank you, Cory

This was pretty good. I omitted the mushrooms, used a deep dish crust and added a 3oz jar of real bacon pieces. The kids weren't too crazy about this. Probably won't be making it again.

What a great recipe!!! I decided to use 2 tablespoons of butter due to the comments made by previous reviewers, as well as omitting the shredded cheddar on top of the quiche, and it came out perfectly. The cheddar inside the quiche was enough for my family. Also for those of you, like myself, who refuse to season to taste with raw egg products...I used 1/2 tsp salt & 1/8 tsp pepper. Fits comfortably in a 9-inch DEEP DISH pie shell. All-in-all, a wonderful meal-time treat!

Way to fattening and greasy!!!  I made half of the recipe so I could make 1 quiche instead of 2 (based on the previous reviews).  My husband liked it at first but then by the second piece said he felt sick.  I couldn't even eat one piece.  I don't like anything that tastes to "eggy" and/or greasy.  My husband and I eat high fat food more than we should but neither of us could handle this quiche!  Sorry, I won't be making it again.

I served this to company for Easter. Some were vegetarians, some were not, so
I also served a ham. The kids pointed out I had made "green eggs and ham"!
It worked great. Very yummy.

Awesome dinner with a side salad.  As mentioned by others,. I did tweak the measurements a bit. 1/2 stick of butter is more than plenty for sauteing the veggies, Unused fresh spinach (about 3 cups) and split the filling between 2 crusts.  all other measurements and amounts were the same as written.  Sooo tasty.

I loved it. 
After reading reviews, I used very little butter to saute the garlic and onion. 
Someone suggested pre baking the pie crust a bit for crispness, great idea! You might need a bit of foil for crust edges near the end of baking, but worth it.
 I must have a true deep dish pie plate. Many reviewers found the filling was too much for one quiche. I found it was the perfect amount. 
And I added cayenne, to kick it up a bit.
Oh, and it freezes beautifully. Whole pie, or frozen by the slice.

Oh my. SO good! I didn’t have as much cheese on hand so I just was able to use feta for inside with some “gourmet pizza cheese” then a slight sprinkling of cheddar on top. I reduced milk to half a cup. No mushrooms because the kids hate them. Cooked as directed. Still turned out DELICIOUS.

Have made this recipe several times, the only change is using FRESH spinach instead of frozen. The frozen has way too much water in it, even after defrosting and pressing out the moisture. Only a 1/4 cup of butter, instead of 1/2 cup because the first time I made it, it tasted like butter!! Fresh mushrooms (6 medium) instead of canned, And plain feta. All the ingredients were mixed in a bowl then placed in the crust because the first time, the egg didn't mix well with "dry ingredients" as the recipe instructs. Basically the fresh vegetables and less butter reduced the moisture and also I prefer fresh over processed.

Took this to bible study, everyone liked.  I kind of goofed though, instead of whipping the eggs like with a whisk or fork, I used an elected mixer which 'fluffed them up so much that I  couldn't put all of egg in pie pan.  Still turned out great.

We enjoyed my adaptation of this recipe. There was no mushroom soup handy, so I added extra milk.  I made a similar quiche later that same week.

Flavorful and Delicious! 
Note: I used a regular size crust and twice the mushrooms, which yielded enough to bake 6 (extra) crustless mini-quiches in a muffin tin. I removed the muffins from the oven about 20 mins earlier than the quiche.

This recipe is delicious! I made some of the changes recommended by others such as reduced butter (used only 2 Tbls). I had a fresh crust which I pre-baked for 5 minutes. Added some baked ham and a bit more feta than called for.  I reduced the amount of cheddar cheese by one quarter. The baking dish was a bit deeper than most so all the ingredients DID manage to fit into one dish ....barely.  I allowed some time for the wet ingredients to soak into the spinach mixture for awhile. Tasted great!!

This is the absolute BEST quiche recipe ever! The ONLY changes I made was using half of the butter called for and plain Feta cheese (only because I couldn't find the one listed) It still turned out fantastic. I also diced the mushrooms to "hide" the fact that they were in there.  I didn't want to hear, "I don't like mushrooms".  The mushroom haters didn't even notice.

The only thing I changed was I added sliced green onions to the mixture before I put it in the pie shell.  Even my son-in-law (who doesn't like spinach) loved it.  Everyone loved it in my household.  I will use this recipe only to make it.  Thank you so much for sharing.  Our dish tasted awesome.

Made this for the first time and it turned out great, but I did read other reviews that said to use less butter (1 tbsp instead of 1/2 cup). Once i started pouring into the crust I realized there was enough for 2. I added 2 more eggs to fill both and it was the perfect following all of the other portions exactly.

Made this recipe for a dinner with friends and it was every bit as good as any upper scale restaurant ... 
I was complimented several times on just how delicious it was.
I did a couple of things different.
1. I made my own pie crust 
2. I didn’t have the seasoned Feta so I sprinkled a couple tablespoons of a dry, rosemary,  garlic and parmesan cheese combination 
This was melt in your mouth savoury goodness and just right for a November evening with friends.
Have saved the recipe and will use it over and over again.

I have been making this recipe for years. As the years went on I have adjusted it to my own liking. I only do about a tbsp or two of butter. I saute fresh spinach not frozen in a pan with butter, garlic, chopped onion and bacon. Once it's all cooked I add in the feta and only cook a few minutes longer. I place it in to the pie crust then top with 5 eggs scrambled with about 3/4 cups of milk and I also add the shredded cheddar cheese to the egg mixture as well. I bake for 30 minutes, pull out and top with more shredded cheddar cheese then continue to bake until fully cooked.

Awesome base recipe that allows a lot of flexibility. Used fresh spinach and mushrooms.  Sautéed onions, garlic and mushrooms in olive oil, then added spinach at the end until just wilted.  Also used 1 cup ricotta cheese in place of the feta, and an Italian blend in place of the cheddar.  Made two pies and froze the second one. Really tasty!!

Sooo good!  I followed the advice of other posters and used about 2 Tbsp of butter.  I also used green onions, loads of mushrooms, 1/2 tsp of Adobo seasoning, a splash of thyme, basil, used the full amount of both cheeses all at once so it was well blended.  Thank you for this delicious recipe!

Amazingly easy and great taste!

Like many others, I reduced the milk to half a cup
I used a 4 oz package fresh spinach rather than the canned
Instead of feta, I used 1 cup of shredded cheddar
After the 15 minutes of bake, I used 2 tablespoons of Parmesan cheese rather than more cheddar

I used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk. This recipe fits perfectly into a 9-inch pan. Granted, 1/2 pound butter is a lot but it’s yummy. Next time I’ll use fresh mushrooms. It is a forgiving recipe so you can add & delete as you like. I may add some chicken next time.

This was a great quiche, and less fat then using a lot of cream... I used Monterrey Jack and plain feta, that I had on hand, sauteed fresh mushrooms. It was delicious... lots of spinach, but good. Husband liked it even though it was green!.Thank you for sharing.

We are not new to quiche.  I tried this recipe and hubs and I both agreed the feta cheese was not to our liking.  The recipe as written is good, but I did pre-bake the pie shell until almost done so the bottom is not soggy.  This is just a personal preference.  I will say one thing, this was much better after it cooled completely.

We made it with some modifications. Ready made shallower Gram cracker crust, cut vegetable/cheese saute mixture in half and freeze remaining. Also cut cook time down. Ours was well done by 15+30mins in. I'd recommend reducing cook time to 30 mins and checking from there.. Still the flavor was awesome, especially with the gram cracker crust. Yum!

The first time I made this recipe I followed it to a T, including using an unbaked frozen deep pie crust shell. The contents were too much despite using a deep dish pie shell. 

The second time, I partially baked a fresh pie shell, using a new truly deep pie plate.No overage. I could not find Herb and Garlic Feta Cheese, so I added a small shallot to the sautéing onion and garlic. When it was time for Herb and Garlic Feta Cheese , I improvised by using plain Feta and mixed Italian Herbs into it  before I adding it to the sautéd onion mixture. 
Then adding then cheddar cheese, I used 1/3 cup more. ( I did have a larger pie plate this time) All of this ingredients were mixed with the spinach. The egg mixture had equal parts of heavy cream and milk added. In order to get a more thorough mixture, I added the egg, milk mixture directly into my skillet. Doing that step really allowed all of the ingredients to really thoroughly mix. It worked out well. My husband told me that this quiche was my best one so far! ( I have made 4 in the last month-2 Quiche Lorraine and 2 Spinach Quiche )

I love this recipe.  I always dig around until I find it.  I do divide the spinach mixture into two pans.  Then I use 7 eggs and 1 & 3/4 cup milk to pour over along with an extra portion of shredded cheese.  The recipe is very flexible.
I always buy a feta with tomato basil seasoning which makes the recipe so much better. 
Yum.

I made the recipe as close to the directions as I could with the ingredients I had. Well my husband said three times that night  " the quiche was so good!" I don't think he has ever done that. Also, he asked if he could have more for breakfast LOL.

One of the best quiches I've ever made -- and a wonderful vegetarian option for picky eaters. I made a few changes which I think made it wonderful: 
- Left out the mushrooms and doubled the spinach
- Replaced the feta cheese with parmesan cheese
- Used sharp white cheddar on top 
- Reduced the butter to 6 Tbs. 

DELICIOUS!

Absolutely delicious with a beautiful presentation! 
I followed the recipe with a few minor adjustments: as suggested, I only used two tablespoons of butter. My feta was plain, therefore I added some oregano and thyme. Additionally, I used fresh baby bella mushrooms, and baked in  a deep dish pie pan - no need to make the recipe in two pans.

I didn't even use mushrooms and only used half of the cheese, still this made two 9 inch pie crusts, not 1. It made such a mess and I'm really anxious about trying it. Seems a little light on the egg

I prefer to put 5 eggs in my quiche, I reduced the cheese by nearly 1/3, and replaced the spinach with frozen chopped kale.  I baked it for the time recommended at 375.  I'm quite pleased with it and my husband had 2nds!

On the whole, good and easy recipe. I followed some suggestions from other reviews, namely to split the recipe into two quiches and to pre-bake the shells for a few minutes to get a crispy bottom instead of soggy. These two together meant a shorter baking time by about 15 minutes. Fortunately, I checked, but my pastry was overdone (dark brown, crunchy), and the filling was on the edge. It was still good, but next time I'll maybe not pre-bake the shells. Otherwise, the family said it's a keeper.

Good.  I, too, reduced butter and used swiss instead of cheddar.  Also used regular feta and fresh spinach.  About 3/4 cup milk. Didn't really follow measurements in recipe exactly but went by reviews and my own intuition.  Seemed to fill up the deep dish crust just perfectly.

Wonderful recipe. I prebaked the crust for 5 minutes, and sprinkled a layer of cheese over the bottom before filling. I omitted the mushrooms and feta and used an Italian blend of white cheese instead of the cheddar because that’s what I hand on hand. I did not take the extra step of adding cheese after ten minutes, instead I just put it all in and baked it all at once. Was perfect at 40 minutes. Delicious.

I used fresh spinach and fresh mushrooms but sautéed them first. I did pre bake the crust so it wasn’t soggy. Otherwise everything else was good

Thanks for the recipe. I used a pound of fresh spinach instead of frozen and a cup of half and half instead of milk.  I skipped mushrooms bc my husband is not a fan. I stirred all shredded, sharp cheddar into egg mixture. I added a pinch of red pepper flakes, two ounces of cubed mozzarella, and a tablespoon of grated parmesan to the egg mixture, too.  I sprinkled a few slices of crumbled bacon on top of quiche.

This turned out really good.  The only changes I made was to use fresh mushrooms and added two extra eggs.  I made for an overnight party with my girls and they all loved it!

Very good. The only addition I did was to saute diced fresh carrots  for a minute or two before adding the onions and mushrooms. Everyone raved about it. Oh... I'd probably not add salt to taste--the feta and the butter took care of the need for salt. Just my opinion.

I'll be making this for girls weekend and for overnight guests.  Super easy to put together.  

Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe.

Very good.  I would add some ham or bacon next time.  I made this recipe without mushrooms.

Made it again, doubled, added mushrooms , diced ham, and bacon, in one, and ham and bacon in the other.  Loved the one with mushrooms!

I made it again with plain feta cheese and bacon.  Next time I would half the amount, or eliminate feta altogether.

I followed the suggestion of making two quiches with the sautéed veggies (I used fresh spinach, too), and substituted the feta with gruyere  for a richer flavor.  The family loved it!

Read other reviews - made with 1/4 cup butter, 8 oz fresh spinach, 8 oz fresh mushrooms,  no salt/pepper, 4 oz of feta with Mediterranean herbs (could not find the one listed). It was very rich and a little runny (the mushrooms gave off a lot of juice) but very delicious. I also cooked the crust about 8 minutes before filling.

Delicious! I didn't quite have all the ingredients so I subbed red onion and garlic in a healthy knife full of butter (not 1/2 cup).  I had one fresh mushroom chopped it, had fresh spinach and baby rocket so I used that.  I had plain feta and I just spiced it by adding oregano, rosemary, basil, sage, and marjoram.I had some cheddar so I used that as well.  I also used 6 eggs for my hungry teenagers.   I should have doubled the recipe because we still ran out! I did not add milk or any other liquid.

II baked it a day ahead and  reheated it in the oven for 15 minutes  because it took me almost an hour to prepare it.  But it was delicious.

Did not use butter, just a bit of oil to saute the onion. No garlic. I used bacon but ham would be fine too.

5 eggs, cup and a half of swiss ('m sure another cheese would be fine).  I started with a cup of cheese then sprinkled an additional 1/2 cup 15-20 minutes into baking. Added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg which I love with eggs/milk which accents the custard so well.

All in all, a great recipe to use as a basis for an adaptable quiche.

This is my go-to recipe for quiche.  I always forget to thaw the spinach ahead of time, so I defrost it in the microwave in a plastic (must not be metal) colander.  I use my hands to squeeze as much moisture as possible out of the spinach before adding it to the other ingredients.

Yikes, hit return and it posted.... So, here goes:  I preferred using fresh ingredients. Added super to the flavor but I should have squeezed the moisture from the fresh microwaved spinach and the pan fried fresh mushrooms. I would also bake the pie crust for 15 minutes empty to give it a head start for the wet ingredients. I used skim milk because that’s all we had at the time....no, no, not ever again. I’d rather use whole milk or even half and half. I used baking merely as a guideline and found it took longer.  I will definitely make this again and try it without changing the authors recipe.

So good!!! Followed recipe as written but used fresh spinach and mushrooms and, based on other reviews, only 2 tablespoons of butter to sauté the onions, mushrooms and spinach. I ended up with a bit too much filling, so probably could have made two smaller ones instead - but it turned out perfect and delicious and I won’t change a thing!

I first made this as a healthy breakfast option for a friend a few years ago. Delicious! Over the years to save a few calories, I started making it without the crust and it works fine as a casserole. In fact, it has become a tradition at our Christmas dinner. The recipe is very flexible and I, like others, have cut back drastically on the butter, using just enough to brown the onions.

This is very similar to the one I make. I cut the sodium count by using fresh spinach and mushrooms and making it crustless. Very good recipe though which is why I gave it 5 stars.

I wanted something that tasted on the idea of a Greek spinach pie, and this satisfied that craving! I actually made this crustless, something I prefer lately (easier, lighter and less calories). I halved the recipe, and used cooking spray on a 9" tin pie plate. I had a 5 oz bag of baby spinach that I wanted to use up, so I wilted that in a little olive oil for about 5 min, adding a little salt and pepper. I only used about 2 tblsp of butter to saute the onion; 1/4 cup in the halved version would have been way too much for me, anyway. I did leave out the mushrooms. I believe I read the recipe wrong and added too much cheddar to the quiche, not realizing some was reserved for the top. I still put a little on top, along with a sprinkling of Romano cheese. Maybe because it was in a smaller pan, but mine was ready in 25 min after the initial 15 min baking time. Thanks for this excellent recipe Bailey, which I'll surely make again!!

This was excellente! I did make a few changes to it though. I replaced the feta with shredded parmesan. Also I cooked up some crumbled country sausage and cubed some ham. Then added that back into the saute with the spinach and cheese mixture. I actually got complimented from the mother-in-law!

A good quiche recipe. It actually even tasted better the next day. Next time I make it I will add bell pepper to be sautéed with onions just for an additional flavor. The muenster cheese was an excellent choice.

I left out the mushrooms and added kale in with the spinach. Even my kids liked it! That is high praise.

This is such a delicious and versatile recipe. Thr only adjustments ive made is cutting the butter way back, like half. It does make more than one deep dish though so I've ended up adding a bit more milk and an extra egg to even out the 2 pies I end up with. I could literally lick the dish with this recipe.
Also I've had trouble finding the feta it calls for so I just buy regular feta and add Italian seasoning to the feta before adding it in.

Great recipe!  Wonderful blend of flavors.  This is the first time I made a quiche with garlic.  That kicked it up a few notches.  I only had cream on hand.  As recommended by other reviewers I reduced the butter by half.  I did not pre-bake the pie shell.  With the filling in the shell, I baked it for 20 minutes in a preheated 425 oven.  Without opening the door, reduced temperature to 375 and continued baking for 15-20 additional minutes.  Enough filling to make two 9 inch pies.  My vegetarian friends loved it.  But next time, I’ll use Half & Half and make it with  bacon and fresh mushrooms.  Very flexible and delicious recipe.

I'm glad I read through the comments before making this dish! To start, I baked both of my frozen pie shells for 8 minutes to prevent the bottom of the pie crust from becoming soggy. Be sure to stab the crust with fork before baking to prevent bubbling.  I also took people's advice and used only 1 tbsp of butter which was perfect, and I fried my fresh mushrooms in with my onions and spinach. Quantity-wise, I varied things slightly: I used about 8 oz of spinach rather than the suggested 10 oz which was still plenty for a spinach lover, 200g of herb and garlic feta - an extra ounce than suggested, 1 tbsp of minced garlic from a jar in the fridge rather than fresh, and 1 extra egg so 5 total. This recipe makes TWO full quiches, even when using a deep dish pie crust. Thankfully my grocery store sells them in two's, so I had an extra one on hand and was able to use all the filling across two pie shells that resulted in two full quiches. Great recipe. A very tasty, savoury dish that I will definitely make again!

First time making quiche ever.  turned out yummy!  2nd time,  I tweaked it a lil bit, using less butter and shredded cheddar to drop the calories.  It was still just as yummy! This will def be a recipe I use often the rest of my life!

I had my sister and her daughter-in-law over for lunch one day. As her daughter-in-law is vegetarian, I decided to try this spinach quiche.  I was unable to buy the herb and garlic feta so substituted tomato and basil feta along with a few chopped sun-dried tomatoes. I served this with a fresh lettuce salad and it was a real hit.  I will definitely make it again.  Even my husband was impressed with it.

I tried making this twice and was very frustrated by the proportions. I tried making it without mushrooms the second time and STILL did not have enough room for all the eggs! Next time I will cut way back on the butter and use 2 pre-browned crusts.

This actually tastes really good, however, there is WAY too much butter and too much cheese. I would also recommend using fresh spinach and mushrooms in this.

Such a delicious recipe! I like to use fresh portobello mushrooms (1 1/2). I find that this makes enough for two Pillsbury pie shells- it’s way too much for one!

Excellent!  Easy to make and it taste great. The Feta cheese gives it the extra zip. I also cut the onion ingredient in half and used scallion chopped small.  We were able to make two 9.5” pies by using the full pack of Spinach.  We liked it so much we made four pies and shared a pie with our neighbors.  Thanks for sharing.

This is a FANTASTIC recipe, but don't expect the proportions to fit at all.
We take out the mushrooms because of allergies, but beyond that you really only need like half the butter or it seeps into the crust and makes it liquid. Additionally, I've never been able to make all the eggs fit, so I halve that, too, because personally I prefer more substance than egg to my quiches.
We've been making this recipe in our family for a good number of years and have found that this works best for us, and it tastes amazing even when microwaved, making it a fantastic thing to prepare in advance for a long week.

I believe it's the feta that sets this apart! Flavor is excellent, and house smelled so good preparing it! Used a frozen deep-dish pie crust, did a 5-min pre-bake on the crust but recommend 10. Also, wrapped crust edge with tinfoil half-way through. I avoid lactose so went with macadamia nut milk (higher fat/protein and non-distinct flavor, so no unintentional flavor imparted). Used a bit less spinach than it called for. A hit even for the kid (near-adult) who doesn't like spinach!

The main change I made was using fresh spinach and wilting it myself.Sadly I have to leave out the mushrooms since I'm allergic to them.
I have had a few people that claim to dislike spinach try this and they LOVED it! Great winter time dish.

I am not chintzy on the seasoning, remember spinach can be bland with out it, extra cheese, add canadian bacon, or spicy sausage.

We enjoyed this and I’ll make it again. Based on some reviews, I cut the butter down to 4 tablespoons and the milk down to 3/4 or a cup.

Great! We used fresh mushrooms in place of canned and Swiss chard instead of spinach.

I never write reviews but I had to for this one. This Quiche was amazing, everyone loved it including my picky son who had two portions and has asked me to send it in his thermos to school. Thank you so much!

This recipe is almost perfect. The only thing I changed is using fresh baby bella mushrooms and sauteing them with the onions and garlic. I also added 2 more eggs to the mix, mainly because I have a lot of fresh eggs on hand and I'm always looking for an opportunity to use them up.  I also split this into 2 quiches.
But this is delicious and usually on the menu at least once a month.

I only used about 2 tablespoons of butter, rather than 1/2 cup and I omitted the feta,  and added bacon.  It was amazing. 

I read several reviews that indicated that this recipe had a good bit of left over filling for one crust,  so I used 6 eggs rather than 4. and increased the milk to 1 1/2 cups.  Doing this, I had enough filling for 2 deep dish pies, rather than one.

I fed eight hungry women at a book club meeting with this quiche.  It's the best quiche I've ever made and I've made them for years.  I did let the garlic out because sometimes I think garlic overpowers all the other fresh vegetables.  The feta cheese added a nice texture and flavor.  I am going to make this again for many other guest.  Thank you to the creator!

Yes, I added my own little bit of spice. I have made this dish several times and have changed the cheddar cheese to several different kinds of cheese it is still very good.

Really flavorful.  Our WalMart does not carry the Garlic & Herb Feta, so I bought some Garlic and Herb seasoning and just added it myself.  I also forgot the mushrooms, but it was still AMAZING!!   Would love to add the mushrooms and some bacon next time!!

It really is a forgiving recipe. I added celery with the onions & garlic sauté. I also used Swiss cheese instead and it added great flavor. I also added Conch, a local mollusk here in the Bahamas. My quiche was a big hit!

This recipe is excellent!  The quiche turned out perfectly...not at all soupy, not at all dry. Just perfect and delicious!!!  I 'm staying with a friend in a small town,  can't get the right kind of feta, plus I didn't have enough of the plain feta I was able to get.    However, it turned out perfectly anyway.  Thanks to the inventor of this recipe!  My friend loves it, too.

This was good. I only used plain feta because my store didn’t have seasoned. It was a little greasy. I feel like it needs more egg.  I will try again with the suggestions of prebaking  the crust and less butter.

Here are my changes, I multiplied everything by 1.5 and that made a perfect amount for 2 crust. I only added 1.25 cups of half and half instead if 1.5 cups of milk and really squeezed out the liquid from the spinach I steamed before returning to the empty pot, through the cheese in with the spinach and mixed that, the cheese melted in. Then threw in the butter and garlic mix and mixed that with the spinach cheese. Then I mixed the eggs and half and half, beat that together well. Added that to the spinach cheese mix and stired that up well and then spooned that into the crust.

Very good quiche almost as written.  I recommend reducing the butter to one tablespoon.  Yummy!  I do love to play with recipes so here's my adaptation.  I used one half cup half n half, five eggs, cherry tomatoes sliced in half, a few spring onions, tomato basil feta, cheddar cheese, spinach, salt and pepper, deep dish crust.  This was a big hit for dinner.  Served with a spring salad mix and balsamic dressing.  Thanks Bailey!

Two thumbs up. I did however make a few changes to mine. I used fresh spinach, added ham and for the crust, I decided to use hash browns instead.

It was excellent! I took half of it to my sister's house, as she was coming home from a 12-day vacation. She absolutely loves it too. I will definitely make it again!

Really good! I didn't have herbed feta so I just used regular. Didn't have mushrooms, but added 2 chopped up sausage patties. Really great flavor. Will make again. Very easy to make substitutions for whatever you have laying around. Oh and I only used about 4-5ish tablespoons of butter and it was perfect!

Almost made it as is, except didn't add mushrooms, mixed all the cheese in at the same time, and added slightly less milk.  It didn't seem too oily, and it all fit just fine in one 9" ceramic pie plate.  My children were pleasantly surprised, saying: "It tastes like pizza" and "You can't taste the spinach."  The spices in the feta gave it that "pizza" smell and taste!

Used half the butter and fresh mushrooms. Just sauté onions and garlic as instructed then add the fresh mushrooms and sauté several more minutes.  Also made without a crust. The quiche was delicious!

This was a very easy and quick recipe. I did pre bake the pie crust and it still came out soggy so I ended up scraping the filling off  (this was just for myself by the way) and the flavor was great. I may try to to do half  and half next time to see how that turns out.

I changed this up a bit after not being able to find a quiche recipe that called for less cheese and no crust. I sauteed the onion in 2 tsp of butter and added 3 cloves of chopped garlic. After mixing the onion, garlic and mushrooms together I blended in about 5 ounces of canned salmon. I used four eggs and 2 cups of half and half, and whisked  in 1/4 cup of flour, 1 scant cup of mozzarella, plain feta plus about 1/4 tsp of dill and doubled the black pepper; sprayed a deep dish pie pan with cooking spray and mixed all the ingredients together. About 5 minutes before the cook time was up I frosted it with pre-cooked  Ore-Ida frozen combination mashed potato and cauliflower  mix and continued cooking til the top was light brown. Came out somewhere between a quiche and Shepards pie. Of course it would've been good without the topping but it did make up for the lack of crust.

This is a very good recipe. Like others mentioned, 1/2 cup of butter is way too much. I used 3 Tbsp instead and fresh mushrooms instead of canned. It made one deep dish quiche for me. If you are using regular pie baking pans, there’s enough filling to make two.

This is a great recipe.  It takes just a short time to put together.  I made this recipe and another one for a party.  This quiche was gone first and everybody raved about it.  The other quiche was good but paled in comparison to this one.  I reduced the butter by 25%, used fresh spinach (sautéed and drained well) and added some bacon that I rendered first and cut into large pieces.   I am not a big quiche fan but this recipe won me over.

So like many, I neglected to read the notes about the butter, etc, but I only used 2 T anyway.  I also browned the mushrooms after rinsing them and patting them dry.  Once the onions started to go to translucent, I added the mushrooms to make sure the metallic canned taste didn’t ruin my quiche.  I never buy canned anything, but for my first try I decided to go with the recipe and then adjust if I do it again.  I didn’t use all of the egg mixture, it just wouldn’t fit and I bake the quiche on a baking sheet in case it boiled over, which it did not.  I won’t know til tomorrow if the oiliness is there, but it sure looks and smells amazing!

This quiche was one of the best I ever had! My husband raved about it as well.  I didn't have mushrooms or pie crust so I left those out and I cut the margarine I used to 2 TB as some reviewers recommended.  Everything else was as written. So, so yummy!

Used the most helpful critical proportion to make 2 pies. Used everything organic, raw mild cheddar cheese, 3 large and 1 extra large egg per quiches. Added portabella mushrooms and this blew the lent dinner away.

This tasted good but I only used 2 tbsp butter and about 2/3 the feta asked for. 1/2 cup butter seemed excessive and I don’t think it hurt the recipe at all. My gram loved it. Next time I will use a little less filling so the quiche is more eggy.

This recipe is alright but next time I will definitely cut the butter by half. it was super greasy and almost not edible. nobody went for seconds because of how greasy it was. also if you are using salted butter skip adding the salt to the spinach mixture it's salty as it is.  I've baked it for 15min on 350 then added cheese and cooked it additional 40 min. came out perfect.

I love this quiche and will make it again.  I bought deep pie crusts so it wasn’t enough for two, but it was a bit too much for one.  I could see where it would fit in two regular size crusts easily.  I cut the butter down to 1/4 a cup and baked the shell just five minutes before putting in the ingredients.  The crust wasn’t soggy at all.  Edit:  Now that I’ve made it several times, I don’t cut the butter down.  Use the whole 1/2 cup.  Nice and rich.

Made it with plain feta, and when I make it again, I will not add any extra salt, the feta took care of it. This was an outstanding recipe! I will definitely make it again. It will be a staple.

How does a recipe get 5 stars if it is greasy and does not fit in one shell as measured.  This needs to be corrected I think to earn 5

Made it for Christmas brunch. It was delicious.  Followed the advice of others so I didn't add salt, didn't use as much butter or milk, and used fresh spinach. I also added some Italian seasoning.  Made another one with bacon for my meat lovers.  They were both great!  Will make them again!

Fantastic! I made it as a vegetarian option for Christmas.  My bf said it was "restaurant quality." The only changes I made were reducing the butter to about 2 or 3 tablespoons and I used Greek seasoned feta. I will definitely make it again.

This recipe was a good starting point, but as it was my first time making quiche, I relied heavily on other reviews.  I chopped and fried six slices of bacon, and used the grease to saute the onions, garlic, and probably about 1/2 Tablespoon basil (I couldn't find the garlic and herb feta).  I used regular feta.  I also sauteed about a pound fresh spinach in butter to remove the water.  I had two deep dish pie crusts, which I cooked for about 8 minutes empty before I added the spinach/cheese mixture.  I also used 3/4 cup milk and 6 eggs.   I did not add any more butter/oil other than what remained in the cooked spinach after I drained it, and the grease from the bacon.  It turned out really yummy.  I will make it again!  Next time I might try adding some sun dried tomatoes.

I used fresh spinach, fresh mushrooms and blue cheese crumbles (I thought it was feta and used it by mistake!) My husband thought it was the best quiche he'd ever tasted! I think the feta would have been good too, but recommend trying blue cheese. It gives it real bite.

Yesssss!!! Made this for thanksgiving breakfast. 
Per the recommendations of others, 1. I used less butter, and 2. I put the crust in the oven for a few minutes before  pouring in the batter. 
I also used  fresh rather than canned mushrooms.

Loved it!!  Instead of cheddar cheese I used muenster cheese and just used half the amount. I did notice that if you use the 9 inch Sara-Lee crust, the dich is not deep enough and there is not enough space for the egg mixture, So perhaps... find a deeper crust dish.

Very yummy recipe... Also very forgiving and very versatile. I have made this many times with success. Tonight I omitted the mushrooms, kept the butter at 1/2-cup (which was still plenty), didn't measure the cheddar - just added handfuls till it looked "cheesy enough". My feta was plain so I threw in a tsp of Italian seasoning. I doubled the filling which made three 9" (store-bought deep dish) pies. I also reduced the milk to 3/4-cup. Sky is the limit with combinations you could make... bacon, mushroom, peppers, zucchini, etc!! Baked in covection at 350 for 15-min, added cheese, then baked 30-min more. Delish!

I definitely recommend baking the crust before adding ingredients.  I did not do that and it did not completely cook.  The flavors were great.  I did not use all that butter (I read the reviews first).  I used olive oil to sauté the onions and garlic and that was enough.  I will be making this again.

This is an expensive dish to make and for there to be an error like I found was cruel. The recipe calls for 1/2 cup of butter. I made 2 quiches so therefore used 1 cup of butter. I thought It seemed excessive but forged ahead. The most  it should have had in the ingredients was 3 tbsp of butter. I had butter dripping out of the pie plate when I took it out of the oven.  Needless to say, it was almost inedible. May decide to throw the extra one out. I would have expected allrecipes to test it first. Not sure I will try another recipe from them.

I really liked this recipes but made a few changes that helped a lot, thank you reviewers. I skip the butter and used just enough olive oil to cook everything down. I also use fresh spinach and mushrooms, just a personal preference. I also use shallots instead of onions and am very happy with the results. I also use just enough milk to mix the eggs. Great recipe and all I did was make some minor changes to suit our house, great stuff and a delicious quiche.

I have made this so many times, it's time for a review. It's my go to recipe for family brunch. I use 3 eggs and 3/4 cups of milk and don't use cheese on top. I sometimes use fresh spinach and mushrooms that I sauté with the onions and extra garlic. In a pinch I use canned mushrooms and frozen spinach - both are good. The key cheat is the Mediterranean flavored feta I buy. My family also likes it with red pepper flakes.

I'm giving four stars because I made some changes, but it has a very good base to go by or start at.  I used 1/2 the butter, added some cut up bok choy, peppers,  spinich, arugula.  Also made gluten free crust.  My boyfriend raved about it.

This was delicious! I've never had feta cheese and was a bit nervous about trying it, so I used ricotta instead. I took others' advice and increased the eggs to 8, used a 10 oz bag of fresh spinach and kept all the other ingredients the same. I also used two deep dish pie dishes instead of one. Lastly, after pre-baking the shells for 10 minutes, I put a small layer of spinach and cheese on the bottom of each one to prevent any potential sogginess from occurring, then baked for about 5 minutes longer than recommended. This turned out excellent and my husband and son loved it!

I made a few changes to the recipe and the quiche turned out even better than I expected it to. I used fresh spinach and left out the mushrooms. I only used 3T butter, 2 garlic cloves and also used less cheese. I also used plain feta as I feel the garlic and onion add a lot of flavour already. This is the best quiche I have ever tasted and will be making it for Easter lunch.

My whole family loves this recipe. It has been my go-to quiche for years. I solved the overflow problem by switching to a deep dish pie pan. I also leave out the mushrooms as my husband won't eat them. Those two changes will eliminate the spill over issue some have noted. I also recently cut the butter in half and no one noticed a difference.

Absolutely delicious!! I used olive oil to sauté the veggies instead of the butter and I used Parmesan and some queso fresco since I don't particularly like feta. It was the first quiche I've ever made and it was super tasty. Will definitely make again

Extremely good. Most importantly, the custard ratio (eggs & milk) is perfect. So however you may tweak it. You will have a great quiche. Thank you for the recipe!

This quiche is delicious! I have made it for several occasions and everyone has loved it. I would give it 5 stars but the ratio of filling to 1 deep dish pie shell is off- there is definitely enough filling for 2 shells. The only other changes I make are I use margarine instead of butter and I bake the shells first before filling, about 6 minutes. It reheats well, both in the microwave and in the oven.

I get many requests from co-workers to bake this when we have breakfast carry-ins.  Like the author states - it's very forgiving to add/subtract ingredients. I prefer fresh spinach and mushrooms, and decrease the butter by half.  It's fantastic!

I have to first say I didn't follow the recipe to a T. I don't use crust because I don't want the carbs. I used fresh mushrooms and sauteed them with the onions and garlic. I didn't use feta. That being said, I liked it. It was ok. No one else in my family liked it, but no one has ever had quiche before and they're really not into trying new things. So, I truly wasn't surprised they didn't like it. Because of that, I probably won't make it again. Not because it was a bad recipe.

Excellent! I made no changes to this recipe.  My family loved it. The cheddar cheese over the spinach/mushroom/feta pie filling topped it off wonderfully; it was absolutely delicious.

It was awesome. I made it in a deep casserole. Too deep to cook it such a short time in the oven. I finished it in the microwave as it was still watery.

I made this for a church breakfast last weekend and EVERYONE raved about this quiche. it was so good! I used 1/2 C butter but strained the spinach instead of adding all that butter. I used the same butter to Sautee 3 bunches of fresh spinach(for 3 quiche) and it was the perfect amount, not too soggy. also, I sautéed mushrooms and added bacon.

I followed the recipe to a T so that I could rate it honestly. Most reviewers rate the recipe based on their changes and I didn't want to do that. There was way too much spinach and the recipe yielded way too much of the egg mixture. There was maybe 1/4 cup leftover, otherwise it would've overflowed. I did make one change and that was omit seasoning it with salt according to one other reviewer, who said that the salt content from the cheeses is more than enough.

I made this using colby jack cheese and mild cheddar in the recipe, and just mild cheddar on top.  I also used a 10 inch pie plate and all ingredients fit in it fine.  I used fresh mushrooms, instead of the canned variety.  The taste of this quiche is awesome!  I will definitely make it again.

My people loved this. HOWEVER, it does make enough for TWO quiches. I'd half the ingredients. Also, i found the baking time a big too long for my convection oven- I took it out 10 minutes earlier.

I skipped the mushrooms and added a bit more cheddar cheese. Works also with a mix of Swiss and cheddar. I would use less butter myself..My kids loved it!

It was a good place for me to "start" with a quiche.  Always like a little nutmeg with spinach (thanks Rachel Ray!).  Love reading the reviews and comments too, as they inspire me to add or substitute items that fit our pantry and your preferences.

A bit too much butter for my taste. Next time I'll halve it. I made it minus the mushrooms, and with regular feta. I also used a pie crust sheet, and baked it in a cake pan(don't have a pie pan). Still turned out great! Easy to make, especially for a novice cook (like me!).

I've made this quiche numerous times and everyone loves it.
I don't like mushrooms so I add peppers and whatever meat I have on hand (ham, sausage or bacon).  My favorite feta flavor to use is the tomato basil! Yum!!

1st time was ok. 2 time was delicious. Sorry I hacked it. 2nd time  I changed it, instead of milk I used half/half  a dallop of basil pesto.  Also I used Swiss cheeses instead of cheddar as it gave it a bit more flavor. Very good! Such a forgiving recipe, such great inspiration. Mix it up its a great start to many a great quiches. Bon appetite !

The measurements are way off for this, it made quite a mess and the reviewers are correct that it is better suited to two instead of one.  But, I found it very yummy and healthy.

This is very good! Made a few changes based on members input.  Used 2 frozen pie crusts. Poked and cooked 5 mins in oven. Put 1/2 filling into each pie.  Whip 7 eggs and 1 cup milk-  divide between the 2 shells.

Also used fresh mushrooms. And I added the shredded cheese on top after cooking for 25 mins.
I also cut the butter down to 1.5 tbsp.

Easy and delicious!

Really good. Didn't season with salt like it said to because of the feta. Glad we didn't ( and we like salt). Used fresh spinach but too much so all the egg mixture wouldnt fit. My fault.

Good thing store bought pie crust come with two because the amount of ingredients do require two pie crust.  Following the reviews, I too decreased the butter by half.  This is a very tasty quiche.  I will make it again.

This quiche is awesome!! I've made it twice in one week. :) The first time, completely as written and the second with subtle tweeks to the quantity of a few ingredients. Now, I like butter, but this recipe calls for A LOT of it so the second time I cut way down, to 1 TBSP and I thought it still tasted great. Also, it was a lot of filling and not a lot of egg mixture comparatively. So, the second time I made two quiches keeping the same quantity of filling split between the two and doubled the egg mixture. This also prevented the filling from overflowing like it did the first time. The recipe as is is fantastic. Definitely try it. The tweeks I made were simply to suit my waistline and tastebuds. Enjoy.

This had a good strong flavor and the left overs were great!  Pour the egg  mixture in slowly, or it will quickly overflow the pie crust.  Overall this was an easy, tasty recipe.

I didn't use all the ingredients but as a basic start, it was good. I didn't use butter, I used fresh mushrooms (8oz) and spinach 1/2 large bag), 1/2 small onion, didn't use the herbal feta ( can never find that in my grocers) I used a small amount of cheddar, I used egg beaters and only 1/4 cup of milk, which I probably shouldn't have because it had a bit too much liquid. I added coarse garlic powder. I also put about 3 pieces of cooked bacon in it so my hubby would eat it!

 I didn't think my hubby would eat it because it was spinach, but he ate quite a bit of it! So thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! Made a few changes. Used 2 tablespoons of butter. Used 4 eggs and 4 egg whites. Used fresh mushrooms and added green peppers. Used pepper jack cheese instead of feta.  Baked crust for 5 min before filling. Baked 20 min without cheese topping, added cheese then baked another 25 min.

This is the best quiche recipe around. It is a holiday tradition as  well as any family function. I am asked to "make some quiche" or "spinach pie" as  we like to call it. I  l do add  more garlic, pepper, and  use sharp cheddar , and  also add some Greek seasoning to the mixture  . This is a real winner and I have been making it for  6 years now, probably 8 to 10 times a year upon request. I am writing the review now because I recently shared the recipe with my sister in law.

This was Lovely.  Decreased the butter to 1/4 cup as others had done and used fresh chopped spinach.  Used regular feta cheese with Basil, Oregano, and Thyme for seasoning!   Put the pie crust in my glass pie plate instead of the store tin it came in, so there was no overflow when pouring in the egg and milk mixture.  
As the recipe states above it is nicely adaptable to taste.  
Very cheesy but delicious!

As the creator said this recipe is very forgiving, I didn't really measure much and I made some other minor changes. I used three tbsp. of butter, fresh mushrooms and baby spinach. I used two crusts, seven eggs and 1.5 cups of milk. I cooked the crust for five minutes before adding everything (it could have used longer). After the cheddar topping step I covered the quiches with tinfoil for forty minutes. They turned out good for my first time making them.

This is fantastic! It did make 2 full 9" Quiches. One I am freezing. I used canned spinach because it was what I had and fresh mushrooms. No salt, only pepper and I added basil to regular feta cheese. One of my favorite things is spinach pie. This fulfills that craving perfectly!.

To be fair, I made a LOT of changes to this recipe, so my review  is really just to confirm that this is a fabulous way to clean out the crisper drawer. The bones of this recipe are really good, and you can make it into whatever you have or like.

I did a healthy version of this recipe. I used lite margarine 1 1/2 Tbsp. to sauté  the onion and garlic for a few minutes, I added  the sliced mushrooms, then the chopped spinach for a few more minutes, till it wilted.  I used half the cheese it called for and I did  3 eggs and 1/2 cp. low-fat milk. I baked for 45 min. at 375F and it was amazing! Another good tip from a reviewer: Before filling the pie crust with the quiche filling FIRST brush the pie crust bottom with egg and bake it for 5-8 min. to avoid soggy bottom crust.

I make this quiche lorraine all the time, except I substitute the Feta and cheddar cheeses with 1/2 lb shredded swiss cheese, and then add 1 pkg cooked & crumbled bacon.  My kids LOVE this recipe!

Everyone loved this quiche and it was gone almost immediately. I didn't have any cheddar, so I subbed in american cheese.  I also used frozen bell peppers instead of the mushrooms.

Made with the changes to decrease butter and only 3/4 milk.  Used both fresh mushrooms and spinach.  Made a little bit extra so after filling a crust I also had mix to put in a muffin tin.

I would definitely make this recipe again. I used half of the feta but added some chopped jalapenos and some red pepper flakes. I also added some chopped sun-dried tomatoes to the top after 15 minutes, when the recipe calls for adding the rest of the cheddar.. It was delicious!

My only changes were to use only half of the butter for sautéing and I substituted fresh mushrooms instead of canned and fresh smoked mozzarella (shredded) instead of feta. I also added some Tabasco sauce to the eggs and pre baked the crust for 5 minutes. It was excellent!

Used the recipe, and made these changes: no canned mushrooms (never buy them)but there were a couple of fresh small  ones left in the fridge, so used them. No herbed feta, but had plain feta so added about a teaspoon of fresh chives from the garden.  Shredded my own cheddar (no packaged shredded cheese if I can help it). Added 2 strips chopped bacon for the men, and a few sundried tomatoes.  After sautéing the ingredients, including the mushrooms, was aghast at the amount of butter so drained out a good 1/4 of a cup and discarded it.  The remainder of the recipe was as written.  Quiche was GREAT! My addition of sun dried tomatoes not a good fit but the small amount of bacon perfect.  Too much liquid with 4 extra large eggs, so it spilled over onto my cookie sheet and had to be blotted up.  Will make again, but not w/ that much butter (maybe try a quarter stick?) and use a little less milk, and just large eggs.  Butter and overflow the reason it didn't get 5 stars but yummy!

I added 8 oz of cooked, chopped chicken and substituted creole seasoning for salt and pepper.  I also could not find the garlic and herb feta so I used regular feta cheese with a dash of garlic.  One should note that when adding extra ingredients you will have enough for two pies instead of one.  So I made two.  I divided the spinach mixture evenly among the 2 pie shells and I just added two more eggs and a bit more milk to the egg mixture.  I ended up with 2 perfect spinach and chicken quiches.

Made an excellent quiche! The texture was great, not too funny and nice and fluffy. I used less butter and regular feta cheese as I didn't have any garlic herb feta. I left out the mushrooms since I did t have any and I added squash from our garden.

I made this for the vegetarians in my office, they seemed to like but I could tell they didn't overly enjoy it. I tried it and enjoyed it quite a bit.

I agree with almost everybody here, the ingredients in this recipe are off. I made half the filling of the quiche and it works great. I used plain feta instead of the garlic one just because I love it plain. And about the butter I only used one tablespoon butter and one tablespoon olive oil and that was enough. 
I really enjoyed the flavour of this pie.

This was delicious. I used fresh mushrooms can sauté with onions. Divided batter into muffin tins, baked then froze them. They reheated great! My family loved them.

the measurements on this recipe are a little off. If baked as per recipe, the quiche will be too oily and will not fit into one deep pie dish.


a few variations to lower the fat content,  margarine instead of butter and halved it, per everyone's suggestions. I used skim milk, and I used egg whites instead of eggs. I also reduced the cheddar a bit, an use swiss. Also, I used fresh mushrooms and sauted them with the onions and garlic. made mine without a pie shell.

Pretty good quiche. My pre made pie crust  wasn't the deep dish kind, so I halved the filling amount, except for the butter, I only used 2 tablespoons. I could have used some more milk/egg mixture. I barley had enough to cover the spinach mixture. But, the quiche was tasty and held together when cut up.

I skipped the crust and used regular feta cheese. Would cut back on the amount of butter and cheese.

Followed the instructions but substituted the 4.5oz of mushrooms for 4.5oz of ham. However, i think it made the quiche a little too salty (especially cuz feta cheese is also salty by nature) so i would recommend putting less ham and eliminating the salt ingredient completely if you are using ham. The ingredients were enough to fill a 9" pyrex glass pie dish; not sure why other reviewers say it is too much. I made my pie crust using Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust recipe on this site- it is excellent and i highly recommend it!!! (Light, slightly flakey and just right... I could eat the crust by itself for a meal haha)

I was able to make 2 quiche with this recipe. I too changed it up thanks to other reviews and made up a bit of my own recipe, using pre frozen crusts. I used about 2 teaspoons of olive oil to sauté the onion and garlic, then later added 1/4 cup of butter before adding in the spinach and cheese. This helps it not stick to the pan while folding the cheeses in. I used a 1/2 cup cheddar cheese and 6 oz. feta (since size-wise, that's all that was available at the store). I used 3/4 cup of milk and 4 eggs. Once you have spooned in the spinach cheese mixture into the pan and pour over the egg, I would recommend softly stirring the egg mixture into the spinach/cheese mixture. The first time I just let it sink in by itself which resulted in far more egg up top, which is fine if that's what you prefer. I topped it off with sprinkles of cheddar, Romano and Parmesan cheese (no measurement/just what I thought would taste good). Turned out great! I made the first batch for my job, and it was gone by the end of the day. My little brother (who can be picky) and my boyfriend (who is a critique in his own right) both really enjoyed it for breakfast, lunch, snack, dinner. It's great to refrigerate and heat up later. I'll be freezing one for a tough week when a great breakfast is needed!

I made this for a brunch and it got rave reviews! I followed the recipe exactly except for the butter. I sautéed the onions in a couple of tablespoons of olive oil instead. I used a 10-inch pie plate (and made my own crust), and I definitely didn't have too much filling. It was perfect!

My husband is not a fan of anything meatless, so I added 1 lb. of lean turkey to the recipe, but changed nothing else.  Doing so gave me enough filling to fit into 2 pie crusts perfectly.  When all was said and done, I was told it looked and tasted like it'd come from a restaurant!  Thank you for an awesome and easy recipe!

Delicious! I've made this more than once and it always comes out good. I like pie crust and so do my kids, so instead of using 1 deep dish, I use 2 pie crusts and split the filling between both.

Unable to find herb & garlic feta so I substituted a garlic & onion gouda that I shredded. If you do this, freeze the cheese for about a 1/2 hour to make it easier to grate. I will make this again, everyone loves it.

I LOVE this quiche. This was my first quiche, in a really tiny oven, so I was not sure how it would turn out. I really didn't expect it to be this good. I decreased the butter to 1 tbsp, and used a homemade crust. This quiche was an instant family favorite! Keep up the good work!

The recipe was great. I added sausage and took out the mushrooms. The recipe was then a little too oily, therefore I drained the excess oil. In addition, with the addition of sausage, there was no need to add salt when I cooked the spinach. With these modifications (of my own choosing), the quiche still turned out great and was a winner with the family.

So delicious and an instant hit! I used duck eggs to make this quiche, so it would sound fancier for a brunch party. ;) If you end up doing the same thing, I would suggest that you only use 3 duck eggs.

It actually turned out great. Had my doubts. But that is just because I made some changes of my own. I did a crustless quiche. I omitted the mushrooms, I have some family members that do not like them. I substituted them with onions. I added half cup milk and half cup cream. No butter. And I used goat cheese in place of the feta.

I didn't use much butter and was unable to pour all of ingredients in the pan as mentioned by others.  I also omitted the mushrooms. I recommend making ahead and reheating. It was very good the next day.

Really enjoyed this recipe. Didn't have a deep dish so halved the mixture as others did and it fit perfectly. Also mixed everything together before pouring in the rust

a great combination for a satisfying dish ( the best during breakfast with some plain mixed greens with or without homemade dressing, or a fruit). although, go for alternating healthier choice and still keep flavourful. alternate frozen spinach with fresh organic spinach and saute it with the butter mixture for extra 2 minutes and it will soften jist like the frozen kind, use 1/4 of butter vs 1/2 cup and dont not! alternate for margarine, trust me scientifically proven butter is a better choice for a fat choice vs margarine( created fake substitute like rubber ). add a drizzle of olive oil at the end when niced all ingredients before adding to the pie shell. alternate portobello or other fresh mushroom vs canned mushrooms for higher nutritional content value. trust me just add the egg mixture with the spinach mixture and pour all together into the pie vs doing it separately , and if you want add the cheese also with it inside at the top. and this will make the quiche cook faster within 45 mins or max 50

I've made the recipe several times. Originally, as written, and know, as stated, it's a great starting point. There was one day where we were craving quiche and we needed to make more then one but I only had enough spinach for one. What's a girl to do?
I substituted a can of seasoned collard greens and we may never use spinach again!! Theres no cookong down, no defrosting, just open up a can, drain it and you are good to go! watch adding any extra salt though. It just seems to add that extra depth of flavor beyond just spinach.

I made this for Easter and got great compliments. I doubled the recipe except the butter and used fresh spinach and mushrooms. Will definitely make again.

I just made this, I added chopped ham, cut back the butter, used fresh mushrooms...big change was I did not add salt and pepper because I thought the ham would supple the salt.  It was perfect!

It easily makes 2 deep dish 9" pie pans full.  I added slices of tomato on top during step 4 when the additional cheddar is added.  I also added cayenne pepper, paprika, and red crush peppers in the egg and milk step to provided a bit more flavor.  It tastes very good.    Definitely a wonderful brunch addition.

Great, easy recipe. Though I made a few modifications, I would think it is very tasty as written, too.

I made this got a wedding shower, so I used two shallow pie crusts instead of one deep. Used only half an onion and skipped mushrooms for husband's taste. I used half the butter and put the pie crustsin the oven for five minutes before filling it, based on other suggestions.

Changes I would like to try next time are: modifying ratio of egg mixture to spinach mix (more egg), skipping cheddar on top (would look more sophisticated without it), or putting the cheddar on in the last ten minutes.

I make this all of the time for picnics and brunch, people always love it, and don't even use the recipe anymore!  I leave out the mushrooms, only saute the spinach (fresh or thawed both work) and onions in spray oil, not all that butter, and also use less cheese.  I often use 5 or 6 eggs.  I also use sundried tomato feta and its great.  Enjoy!

Very good basic recipe and the whole family loved it....but there's a problem in the directions.
  After sauteing the garlic, onions, spinach and mushrooms in butter(and half the butter is plenty)  and adding the cheeses to that hot mixture.....
DO NOT add that to the pie crust before adding the beaten eggs and milk custard mix. 
  The melted cheeses make the filling mix a cohesive glob that was very hard to mingle with the custard mix in the pie shell without destroying the bottom of the pie shell.,
  Mix the sauteed filling with the custard base in a bowl and then pour into the ready pie shell.
  And do use a deep dish so there's room for all that luscious custard and filling. 
   Excellent flavor!

this turned out well with rave reviews from DH.  I did reduce butter to 2 T to saute fresh baby spinach and fresh white mushrooms.  I made one quiche with a Pillsbury pie crust (for DH) and the other one (for me) in a sweet potato crust (I layered thin slices of sweet potato on a greased pie plate, baked it for 20 minutes in 375 degrees, before adding quiche filling). Both were amazing.  This is a keeper.

First time I made quiche & I must say it was simple. I did make two pies as previously stated because it was just too much filling for only one. The only thing I would change is the feta cheese my husband & I weren't fans of it. Other than that I will definitely be using this recipe again & experimenting with the filling.

On a scale of 1 to 10 I rate this a solid 8.5.  Cooking time for me at 34 minutes was good.  Cool down period of 10-12 minutes is a MUST.  Next time I will use even LESS salt than is called for, if any at all.  The cheese has more than enough.  Be sure to completely drain the water from the spinach and mushrooms.  I figured $2.10 per serving times six servings.  With a small salad and warm bread it's a very healthy and tasty alternative to the fast food joints.  Easy and fun to make.  I would make it again.

We. loved it!! only slight change for me was I used 3 cheese Cheddar blend. It was beautiful and delicious.   Fit perfectly in the deep dish.  I did use a cheese cloth to wring the spinach as I find draining alone is uneffective for me and the extra water in spinach can create a diluted flavor in some dishes. Definitely making this one again.

I would recommend this to anyone making quiche for the first time! Very easy to make with very few steps and overall delicious. About 20 minutes through I put another thin layer of cheese on top and it turned out golden and crisp.

Good but made a few changes. Loved the feta cheese! Added bacon, left out the mushrooms & butter ..used a bit of the bacon grease to saute the onions & garlic... & used cream instead of milk. Loved it! Plus, needed to use 2 pie crust instead of 1.

This  was absolutely incredible.  My husband and I agreed it was the best quiche we ever had.  I used fresh spinach (would recommend always using fresh)  and the feta is very salty so next time I wont be adding any additional salt.

This recipes a winner! I know it's good when my fiancé doesn't go back for not one, not two, but for three helpings! X out the mushrooms and milk. I used half the amount called for milk with heavy whipping cream. And I added an extra egg to ease the guilt! You're welcome!

This is a good baseline recipe.  I just throw in whatever I have for veggies on hand.  Onions,  garlic, Broccoli, carrots, spinach, you can even throw meat in there if you wanted.  But you get the idea,  throw in what you like.  I lightly coat my crust before filling with Dijon Mustard, and bake till fluffy (about 5-7 mins),  then fill,  then bake again per these instructions.   I also like to add a little Swiss in there.  But again,  this recipe is great to use as a baseline and make it your own.  :)

Delicious! Next time I would mix all ingredients in a bowl before putting it in the pie crust. Much easier to mix. Also couldn't fit all the egg mixture in the pie crust and mixing In a bowl may help.

As every cook knows, it's only as good as YOU make it! This was a good basis for my quiche! The only measurement that is constant for me, is the milk, in which I substituted for half & half. I also use more spinach and mushrooms, and NEVER canned or frozen. I also, always, do without the pie crust.

Following Julie S. Advice about halving the recipe was a very good idea!

We did alter this recipe slightly.
We used 'seriously sharp' cabot shredded cheddar and tomato & basil flavored feta.

This is the first time me or my grandmother had quiche and we both enjoyed it very much. This dish with these alterations I believe is savory and filling.

It was very good. But I did use some of the other reviews that people have posted. Such as not using butter I use extra-virgin olive oil, egg beaters and 1% milk and I also added garlic powder a little onion powder a little oregano and no salt because of the cheeses. Delicious!!!

Very delicious. I made my own changes to it like getting rid of the feta cheese and making it out of fresh ingredients the spinach and mushrooms were great. It gave the quiche dish have more moisture than in the past which I really enjoyed.

Love it! I used egg whites to substitute 2 of the eggs; flax milk to substitute the regular milk; and added red and green peppers and veggie sausage.

The reviews attracted me to this recipe. My first time in years trying one without my mom's help and my hubby took pictures! He's the cook of the family and is very proud. 

Note: I used heavy cream instead of milk. The recipe as measured does not fit in one crust. I had to split it comfortably in two and it cooked well. A little loose and moist, but good.

Thank Allrecipes.com!

I'm not a big fan of garlic and onions, so I just cut those ingredients, and it got really good!

Very good!! So proud of my first quiche :) Didn't have mushrooms, but put in fresh tomatoes, and mexican cheese blend, put 1 tbsp of butter as recommended by others. Also didn't have a pie dish so used a round casserole deep dish but it still worked. Had to cook for about 50 min in the oven. Was a bit watery because of the fresh tomatoes but that wasn't an issue when I ate it for leftovers. YUMMY!

This quiche is wonderful! I did everything in this recipe fresh instead of frozen. It was a hit, even over the second one that I did that had jalapeno bacon in it! I am definitely making it again. It was suggested that instead of doing this as a pie, make it in a 9x11 pan for a larger crowd. I think I will have to try this...

I followed the one reviewer's recommendation of less butter and dividing the spinach mixture between two quiches and it turned out great.  My guests loved it.

I love this pie! It freezes great. I wrap slices individually, first with plastic wrap, then foil, then put them in a ziplock bag and I have breakfast to go or stay. Love it, thank you.

I have used variations of the recipe for 3 or 4 years now.  Several substitutions include; using fresh spinach when in season,  making 2 regular 9 inch quiches with this recipe (rather than the deep dish), leaving left out the mushrooms.  I have used different flavors of feta....so many choices!

Couple of must haves...1) a pan under the quiche when cooking, otherwise your oven is a mess 2) I tend to cook a bit longer to brown the cheese 3)make more than 1 because there are no left overs!

I made this in a deeper dish pie pan and had to add 2 more eggs (Recipe calls for only 4) So I think 6 eggs with 1 cup of milk would be good.  And I used a regular hunk of good plain feta and grated my own extra sharp cheddar cheese for more flavor. The other ingredient amounts are just fine.  AND I used some olive oil instead of butter and cut back on the cheddar cheese to make it healthier. Very good!

Baking now. Did not see the recommendations to decrease the butter. I am hopeful using fresh mushrooms will soak up some of the extra butter. I also used the full package of spinach and sautéed some chopped red and green peppers for a holiday look. Looking forward to tasting it, thanks

This is suer rich and delish! I didnt use a pie crust and poured the mixture straight into the pan. I'll probably use half the amount of butter next time.

Just to shout out about the variations made easily to this. I made it with spicy Italian sausage, onions, yellow peppers, and 5 eggs with milk. I attached the photo. Amazing and maybe not as healthy as the spinach but I don't care when it's delicious

I used fresh spinach and mushrooms.  The mushrooms I add at the same time as the onions and garlic so that they are appropriate softness.  Also instead of spooning the mixture into the crust and then adding the egg, I pre-mix them in a bowl and then add to the crust; this makes the quiche more homogeneous.  It is delectable.

I read some reviews and used less butter as recommended. Next time I will cut it down even more. I used fresh spinach and mushrooms, and no salt. My feta was plain. I really loved this and will be making it again.

After reading all the reviews on this recipe I also tweaked it.  I used 12 oz fresh spinach, sautéed in small amt of olive oil,  drained and squeezed the liquid out.  4 large brown fresh mushrooms cut into pieces.  I sautéed the onions in "two" tbsp butter, then added the garlic and the mushrooms until soft.  Then I added the spinach and the cheeses.  I used Gorgonzola instead of the Feta and I used half swiss and half white cheddar cheese.   I poured the mixture into my oiled quiche dish (not deep dish) and added the milk and egg mixture.  It fit beautifully in my quiche dish.  The result was yummy!   I like quiche because we use it for "take to work" lunches the next day.    Will make again!

Great recipe! I adjusted as the other reviews stated. I used 4Tbsp butter, baked crust for 5 min prior to filling, and used different cheeses. I used swiss and gouda, fresh spinach, and fresh baby bella mushrooms...FANTASTIC! Thank you for the recipe, very easy to make and adjustable.

Ingredients added: ham, cayenne pepper and rosemary.
I also made a muffin sized batch and they were as delicious as the full sized quiche (for the muffin sized ones, I didn't leave them in the oven for the same duration as the pie-size quiche).

Will make again!

I used cheddar and swiss cheeses.  Happened to be what was in my fridge.  I think I could have added a few bits of real bacon. I also steamed fresh spinach instead of frozen. It DID all fit in my one deep dish pie shell. Delicious! You can definitely play around with this recipe.

I agree with the previous reviews - some of the measurements are definitely off (i.e. butter, milk, eggs). This was my first time doing this recipe so I decided to stick with it to the tee just to know for myself how it would turn out.

I used fresh baby spinach, and lots of fresh baby Bella mushrooms.  Used 5 cloves garlic.  Used 5 eggs instead of 4, and the whole cup of milk.  Used 1.5 tbsp butter.   Next time might want to cut down on cheddar, and maybe just use feta?  Also, split in half and baked 2 quiches.    I put too much salt, used 1/2 tsp for the 5 eggs, use less next time. 
I thought the spinach, onion, garlic, mushroom mixture was sooo good that I might want to make just that and stuff it into fatayer dough with mozzarella cheese!!

Delicious! The spinach filling makes two deep dish pies, though you have to double the eggs and cream. Very tasty. Reduced butter to 2 tbs to sauté onions, garlic, fresh mushrooms, zucchini, spinach. Used half and half instead of milk. Beautiful presentation!

I have made spinach and feta quiche before, and I liked this recipe as it was very forgiving, as suggested in the recipe. I didn't use mushrooms as I didn't have any, and used pre-prepared frozen pastry as I couldn't find pie crust. Was flavourful with the onions and garlic even without added flavour in the feta. Great tip to squeeze out as much water in the spinach as you can, which ensures you don't end up with soggy quiche.

Now a favorite.  I used Mediterranean herbs feta and seriously sharp cheddar and fresh mushrooms. Squeeze spinach as dry as you can.

This was wonderful! I used less butter , but used fresh mushrooms with onions and green onions. I only changed the salt out for Mrs Dash Italian for our personal needs. Served with stewed apples and cold salad . Love this!

Delicious! I used all fresh ingredients and no butter. It is amazing. I also baked it for 40 minutes then added the cheese and baked again for 10 minutes. When I did it the way the recipe calls for, the cheese on top burnt bad. So I reversed and it came out perfect!

I have made this several times now and it is always a hit. I am always asked for the recipe. Like other reviews, the measurements are a little off. I had a little of the milk and egg mixture left over and I cut back on the butter to a half stick and it was still a touch oily. But the favors are delicious and with a few tweaks, I highly recommend this recipe.

So delicious! Used chopped broccoli instead of spinach, added bacon bits and diced red bell pepper, and used 1/2 cup heavy cream instead of milk.

Excellent recipe, hubby said its the best quiche I've ever made! Only used 1 Tbsp butter (a whole stick would have been way too much), omitted the mushrooms and used fresh spinach instead of frozen (just sauteed until wilted in skillet after onions and garlic were soft). Also, plain feta instead of the flavored kind...the feta makes this! It gives it a really yummy, salty kick. Will definitely be making this again, and probably two at a time next time (we ate the whole dish in one sitting, and quiche is one of those "better when leftover" kind of dishes to me!) Very yummy, thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recs of others and made 2 quiches from this. Actually filled 2 regular 9 in (frozen) crusts using only the listed ingredients (didn't need more eggs). I also used only a tbsp of butter to fry the onions/garlic. Really delicious!

I never made a quiche before, so when I made this recipe for a breakfast dish to take to work, it was AWESOME.  Very buttery, flaky, and TASTY !!  I had to use plain Feta because I couldn't find the garlic herb feta, but it was very good anyway.

Cut down on the butter.  I am not big fan of salt, but this is bland so make sure to add salt. I don't like the herb feta.  Just ruins the taste, in my opinion.  I will try it with regular feta.  It's just okay.

I made this quiche for Good Friday because I needed a good meatless alternative. Only big modification was use of half and half instead of milk because I had some I needed to use up before it had to be thrown out--waste not want not. I also used plain feta, 4 oz, instead of herbed. I mixed everything together, including all the cheddar, before I put it in the pie crust. My teenage boys could not stop eating this, and neither one is a big spinach fan. They said it was by far the best quiche I've ever made.

I make this whenever my family stays overnight.  They absolutely love it and always ask me to make it. I found there is too much filling for one pie so I usually divide it and make two. The only thing I've changed, as many reviewers have, is using sliced fresh mushrooms instead of canned.

I love spanakopita, so I thought I'd give this a try.  Used fresh spinach, which I chopped and then microwaved for 2 minutes to get soft.  Will cut back on the butter next time, maybe by half, as it seemed to ooze a little when taken out of oven. Still cooling.  Can't wait to try it!

I modified the recipe. I used frozen 3 pepper veggies, green onions, whisked 2 tablespoons of flour with while milk and then added 4 large eggs. I sautéed the 3 pepper biggies with 2 cloves if garlic and fresh spinach, butter, fresh crab claw meat and one bag of salad shrimp. The flavor were delish!!

Oh my goodness, that was the best quiche I've ever had. I really didn't change much at all. I couldn't find anything but plain feta at the store, so that was altered. I substituted frozen spinach with fresh organic spinach, which I sautéed with garlic and butter on its own before adding to the mix. The only other thing I would change next time (and there will be a lot of next times) is to wait 25 to 30 minutes before adding the cheese on top. It came very close to burning after 25 minutes when I added it after 15, so I'll let the quiche bake longer next time before the cheese is added. Great recipe! Even my 7-year-old loved it, and he's very against new food.

Very good.  Here were my changes to make it a bit healthier:  replaced frozen kale for the spinach, added fresh mushrooms and green onion in addition to the small onion, and scratch-made the crust with some gluten-free flour and coconut oil.

I really like this recipe, and it adapted nicely, as I didn't have the feta. I used fresh spinach and fresh mushrooms following the directions I cooked on the stove top adding the spinach last. I whipped together a little cream cheese, and some ragotta cheese with the egg and cheddar cheese. Layered the pie crust with half the spinach mix and then added the egg and then the remaining egg mix and topped with cheddar cheese. I know I changed it quite a bit but I only had limited of the specified ingredients. It turned out great, next time I will try it with the feta cheese.

I made this for Christmas brunch 2013 and loved it. I  don't particularly like mushrooms, so I left them out of the recipe.  I served the quiche with bacon bits and fresh salsa on the side as toppings. Yum!  Will definitely make this quiche again.

I made this for Christmas brunch.  The only change I made was using fresh ssuteed mushrooms and I put all of the cheese into the mix. It was so most and delicious!  The only problem?  I didn't make enough!

Thank you for the recipe.  I made the quiche this morning on Christmas Day and it turned out scrumptious.  Will definitely make it again in the future.

Wow! This was my first ever quiche and everybody loved it! I used half of the butter as others suggested, and sauteed it with fresh garlic, onion, and fresh mushrooms, adding fresh spinach at the end. Those were my only changes. I look forward to making this again and again.

Like others, I made a few changes. 1st, I sauted shitake mushrooms in butter less than suggested amount. I used 1/2 heavy cream and 1/2 milk. Overall is is a great foundation for a recipe. I wish that I had added Thyme to the ingredients. Next Time!

This was very good. However, there is enough filling for 2 pie crusts. I split the mix and distributed it evenly between the 2 crusts. Delicious.

This is the best quiche I have ever eaten.  EVER.  I think I made it exactly as written here.  I used the "Basic Flaky Pie Crust" (submitted by Stephanie)as my crust.  I could not stop eating this quiche and finished it all by the next afternoon (that means I ate 6/8 of it!).  Thank you, thank you for this delicious recipe!

As others stated, the recipe is enough for two pies and use three eggs in each pie. I reduced the butter and seasoned plain feta cheese with italian herbs. It was great. I shared with co-workers and they loved it.

This is really easy and indeed forgiving.  Absolutely delicious...I did not use a crust and used fresh mushrooms and threw in some chopped kale (I had it left over).  It was great!

This recipe is DELICIOUS.  Heated crust in oven for 7 min. b4 filling
as another cook suggested.  Used ONLY 1 T of butter in non-stick pan,
Egg-Beaters instead of real eggs (1 cup) & 1/2 cup milk - a little
TOO much - Next will use 1/4 cup. Followed recipe for everything else. Easy & Good!!  This is a keeper.

I loved this. It was easy and versatile without being too plain. Its a good resipe for easy kitchen sink quiche. Only suggestion is use less - I got away with adding some potatoes to half the filling mixture and 3 eggs - and that was plenty for a full-sized quiche.

This is excellent quiche. It is important to drain the spinach beforehand because it makes the quiche too watery. I tried evaporating the water off in the pan with the onions and it was only partially successful. I used plain feta and topped with bacon pieces. The flavors were great together.

First quiche I've ever done and it came out very yummy.  Everyone in the house loved it!  I did lessen the butter to 1/4 cup, mindful of the feedback that the quiche recipe as it stood might come out too oily.  I also used fresh spinach which I needed to wilt a batch at a time when i cooked it.  I used Kiseo, a native buffalo cheese here in the Philippines, in place of feta, and cheddar cheese.  Because the native buffalo cheese gave off some liquid, I removed most of that from the spinach mixture before I placed it in the pie crust.   I didn't salt the milk and egg mixture anymore because the spinach mixture was already salty enough.  The quiche came out really lovely. Thank you!

Very good quiche. I made this quiche in a 10 inch pie crust. Today I have made the half of the recipe and cooking this in a Tenderflake deep dish shell. Perfect!

Made this tonight.  My feta cheese had gone bad, so I used all cheddar.  I used only 2 tbsp butter, fresh mushroom and fresh spinach.  Very tasty.

I loved this quiche. It reminded me of spanakopita, too. I read the other reviews and made these changes 1) Only used 1tbsp of butter 2) Skipped the feta, didn't have any, added extra cheddar instead 3) No salt 4) Made two quiches! Split the spinach mix in half and use 4 eggs and 1 cup of milk in each quiche 5) Mixed the spinach/eggs together before putting in the pie crust. The quiche was even better the second day.

the taste was great- but i don't know what went wrong. the problems already started before i put it in the oven- the filling or the egg mixture was too much and everything started flooding, dropping and spilling. when i took it out of the oven the center was set and the cheese about to burn, yet the egg after cutting in was still runny. also the crust was too soggy. i would have liked it better with fresh sauteed mushrooms.

I made the following changes to this recipe- fresh mushrooms instead of canned, fresh spinach instead of frozen, and 2 TBSP butter instead of 1/2 cup. The flavor was very, very good. However, the entire lower half of the quiche was soggy. When we cut into it and removed slices of the quiche, liquid oozed out from the quiche that was still in the pan. Obviously the button crust was completely soggy. So, the flavor was great but it was so soggy and wet that I cannot give it a very high rating. I may have made a mistake by using the fresh ingredients so it might have been my own personal problem instead of a flaw in the recipe!

Really good! Just remember to add the cheese on top in the last 15 minutes of baking - otherwise it burns.

I have made this quiche on multiple occasion's and never been disappointed. You can pretty much throw in whatever you have on hand and have a good dinner. I add another box of spinach and make two quiches. My family loves it.

I am home for school super bored so I cook dinner for my family when they are all gone in the day. My mom had me make it 3 days in a row and took one to work. HUGE hit with the whole family. If you have a stick of butter just cut a small pad. And when you sprinkle the cheese on top don't try to dump a full bag just gently cover the quiche it will work. We did not use a crust at all.

This recipe is hard to mess up and was a hit at the potluck so will definitely be making it again! I am a clumsy cook so when I make something that people tell me is actually good I can hardly believe it! I went out of my way to find pie crust that didn't have lard/hydrogenated oils in it. I suggest you do too, I found mine at Trader Joe's.

I love this recipe.  As a prior reviewer said, it's very forgiving.  You can add as much butter or olive oil as you want, it's good with amount recipe calls for and I think it's good with less too.  I always add red bell pepper b/c I like things to be pretty.  I use red onion too.  Make sure you pull the spinach up into the egg mixture a bit.  This is also good w/out crust.  Yum!

This might possibly be the best thing I have EVER made.  I made it for a brunch & every bit was gone before I could go back for seconds.  I am sending my husband to the store so I can make it again for him tonight, because it is THAT good!  I made it exactly as the recipe directed.  It was a lot of the spinach mixture & I ended up wasting a lot of the egg mixture because it overflowed.  This time I am going to divide & make 2.  YUMMY!!

This turned out great!  I made my own pie crust, and used less butter. Put crust in for 5-7 min. beforehand to get it crispier.  I put the entire thing in a 9" cake pan with a removable bottom - this is important because the quiche filling fit perfectly in this deeper size dish. It would overflow in a regular pie pan. It's also nice aesthetically to have the removable bottom on the cake pan because you can take the quiche out of the pan, and see the crust all the way around.

Completely awesome! I bought a 2 pk of deep dish pie crusts, and there is no way all of this will fit into one. Maybe if you have your own super deep dish and make your own crust it would fit. Anyway, I followed another reviewer's advice to divide the spinach mixture evenly, but make an egg/milk mixture for each and pour over top (so double the egg mixture and divide). One crust I pre-baked a few minutes, the other I didn't. No one complained of soggy crust, so I don't think it matters. I only tried one, not sure which it was. Refrigerated over night and microwaved slices the next day...wonderful!

I have made this recipe several times and like the author says sometimes I change it up a bit, it always comes out delicious.  The only thing I change is the cheese.  I have used herbed cherval instead of the feta delicious, I used swiss instead of the cheddar 1x but did not like it as much as the cheddar.  You can do whatever you like to the spinach mixture and when it tastes like the spinach you love you can't go wrong!

Yum! Turned out great... I used fresh spinach instead of frozen and it was still delicious. But I would cut back on the amount of onion next time.

I doubled the recipe to make 2 quiches but had so much extra that I also used a third pie pan.  I would recommend fresh mushrooms, not canned.  Also I used 1/2 cup butter for doubling the recipe, wouldn't use that much butter to sautee the spinach mixture for one quiche.  I also used one package of Tomato Basil feta because the store didn't have the herb & garlic kind.  The quiches were fantastic!!!  Everyone loved them.

Really, really good quiche. However, when I followed the directions about the salt; it ended up being way too salty. You don't need to add too much extra salt to this recipe (if any at all).

Excellent Quiche, but very rich. Use a tablespoon on butter only, not a half cup or it's too oily.  Too bad the calories are so high, 613cals for an 1/6 slice, 459cals for a 1/8 slice.

It just came out of the oven and it tastes delicious but I think the butter was a little excessive, it's very greasy. This was my first attempt at a quiche so now I know. I also ditched the mushrooms and swapped broccoli and cheddar for spinach and feta, and added a dash of paprika. yumm

This recipe is very forgiving. I didn't think I would like the combination of feta and cheddar, so instead i used some goat cheese, which I think has a similar tang as feta but is more mild. I also added about 1/4 lb of deli ham. I used a 9" deep dish pie crust and it was filled to the brim with a little left over, so you definitely need a deep dish crust. 

The quiche came out amazing and was even better on day 2! The only thing I did not like about the recipe  was that there is entirely WAY too much cheddar cheese reserved for topping the quiche with. I only reserved 1/4 to 1/3 of a cup of cheese to top the  quiche and it was still way too much. The result was a tough layer of cheese, rather than a soft fluffy quiche. Next time I will mix almost all of the cheese into the filling and add a light sprinkle when it has only about 10 min left to cook. I did not care for the cheese layer this recipe calls for  and if you follow the recipe exactly, you  may as well eat a melted block of cheese.

Made this without the crust and it was nice and spinachy.  But toooooo cheesy.  Will look for a new recipe with less cheese or just cut it back for this one.

This is a great Spinach Quiche recipe!  A definite keeper in our house.  I made several changes after reading other reviews.  I made 2, easier to make a double recipe.  Prebake the pie shells for 10-15 minutes.  Saute fresh mushrooms in 3Tbl of the butter in a separate skillet while cooking the onion/garlic mixture in 5Tbl of the butter(even though I made a double recipe, I used 1/2c butter total).  When the onions were cooked, I added fresh spinach to the onion mixture (a 1lb Organic tub from Costco).  The spinach wilts quickly, keep adding a little at a time till you get all the spinach in.  When the spinach is wilted, add in the cooked mushrooms, and the cheeses as described in the original recipe.  Whisk together the eggs, milk, and seasoning in a large bowl.  Add the cooked veggie/cheese mixture to the egg mixture and stir quickly to prevent cooking the eggs.  Pour the combined mixture into the prepared pie shells and bake as directed in the original recipe.

Awesome dish! I as well wish I had read the reviews before making it. The butter is WAY too much. I'll use the recommendations of others and lower the butter content as well as the cheese next time.

Good recipe.  My crust turned out a bit soggy, but I think that's because I used fresh spinach and mushrooms.  That said, the entire thing was eaten and enjoyed, so still a tasty recipe.

Simply delicious!  Here are my modifications:  I used half a yellow onion and substituted half of a yam (grated) for the mushrooms.  I sauteed the onion, garlic, and yam with 3 tablespoons of butter and some canola oil until the sweet potatoes were lightly browned.  I halved the amount of spinach and the amount of cheddar and feta cheese.

This was good! I took a lot of people's suggestions - Used only a tablespoon or two of olive oil, I used fresh spinach, prepared a second pie crust just in case (I didn't need it), etc. I had plain feta so I added thyme, rosemary, basil and a tiny dash of cayenne. I topped it with sliced Roma tomatoes like I saw in the photos. It's very tasty; my husband is helping himself to his third slice!

Love this recipe.  I have tried to make this somewhat more healthier for us.  The few modifications I do is I like to brown a couple of sweet turkey sausage links then remove those onto a plate with a paper towel to get the extra grease out then add it back in later with all of the other ingredients.  I then use the same pan for the onions and garlic but I cut the butter down to 2 Tbs.  That is plenty.  I use about 3/4 of a package of fresh mushrooms diced (even though I don't like mushrooms at all, there is so much flavor in this quiche that they don't bother me).  Instead of 8 oz of cheddar, I halve that and then do about 4 oz of smoked gruyere.  That is such a great cheese in quiche.  I also use Egg Beaters instead of eggs and FF milk.  I never use a crust  and it turns out fantastic every time.  This last time I actually put this in a small casserole dish and it worked out even better becuase usually there is too much to fit into my quiche pan.

This was fabulous!!! I did make a couple of changes since I was serving 10 people; I used the same amount of feta, cheddar and spinach for two pies and doubled the amount of eggs, milk, onions and garlic. I used a 1/4 of butter instead of 1/2 of the amount listed for this recipe. I eliminated mushrooms because I do not like them. I used 1 cup of milk and 1 cup of heavy whipping cream (since I doubled this part of the recipe for 2 pies)...they still had plenty of spinach and cheese and was absolutely delicious, even my father (who claims to dislike quiche) loved it!

This was DELICIOUS!!! The only change I made was using fresh vegetables instead of frozen or canned. The herb and garlic feta gives such a wonderful flavor to this dish....LOVED IT!

This was truly fantastic! I am actually eating it now for lunch the day after and the flavors propelled me to write a review. Couple changes: I added a container of shitake mushrooms instead of the canned mushrooms and used 3 shallots instead of the onion. After pouring in the egg mixture, I slightly moved the spinach around with a knife to facilitate the binding. I didn't stir the spinach, just poked and moved it to the side so the egg could seep in. :) This made for a more cohesive dish and one that did not feel like it was layered.

EXCELLENT! I couldn't find my normal recipe so tried this.  My 2 yr old, 7 yr and husband loved it!  I didn't have spinach so I used 1/2 a can of diced tomatoes (I will repeat that) and no mushrooms so I took some ham and diced it up.  I didn't have 8 oz of cheddar cheese so I used Romano and Parmesan and an Italian cheese mix that were left over from dinner the night before.  This was so good!  It will be my go to quiche from now on.

I've been making this recipe for over 4 years now and it's one of my favorites on this site.  I have altered the ingredients slightly for our tastes and dietary needs, but the great thing about this recipe is that it takes very well to experimentation!  I substitute a large zucchini for the mushrooms, and if I'm making a lactose-free version I use goat cheese feta and leave out the cheddar as well. Comes out delicious every time and makes a great presentation.

This recipe is great! Easy to do, however, the second time making it I backed off on the milk by half cup, as there was too much egg mixture for the crust to hold. The feta cheese really makes this a flavorful quiche!

Wonderful!  I only used 1 TBSP of butter, and had too much egg/milk (and I only used 1/2 cup of milk) for my deep dish pie crust.  Next time, I'll only use 2 eggs, but this was wonderful!

I only had a 16oz package of spinach and decided to just use all of it along with an extra can of mushrooms. The outcome filled two 9in pie crusts. I only increased the amount of cheddar cheese by a half cup for topping both pies. I also only used a little over 1/3cup of butter for sautéing and doubled the egg mixture, though all of the egg mixture couldn’t fit. So in essence, I didn’t have to completely double the recipe to fill two 9in pie crusts. I’m glad I didn’t because it might have been too rich for our liking. We think it came out delicious! It's true, this recipe is very forgiving so if you want to add more of what you love (i.e. spinach) or add tomatoes like some other people have, it will still turn out great.

Very delicious recipe! I only used 1 TBSP of butter as others recommended, soymilk, 5 cloves of garlic, and half of the feta cheese. We had enough filling for 2 9 inch pie crusts. My bf is non vegetarian and he loved it! Great!

Just made this quiche, and it turned out beautifully! I added tomatoes, and some bacon. I also used 1/3 cup heavy cream, and 3/4 cups milk for added fluff factor. The measurements here are accurate for two nine inch quiches. It was my first time making quiche, and it no longer intimidates me! I'm serving this for valentines day dinner (: great recipe!

I wouldve given 5 stars but ingredients are way off!

I used 3/4 cup milk,3 eggs,1/2 teaspoon minced garlic,1/2 of a small onion,10 oz frozen organic spinach, omitted mushrooms(personal choice),6 oz of both cheeses, and only a bit of olive oil heated in pan. It was great this way and I only had to use 1 pie crust this way too. It makes the mixture less than what is called for. I used less salt and pepper too. I will make it my way again.

Easy to make.  Very similar to another quiche recipe on this site (can't remember it's exact name).  To cut down on fat/calories, I didn't use a pie crust.  Believe it or not, Rainbow Foods, a large grocer in my area, did not have the frozen chopped spinch.  It did, however, have frozen cut-leaf spinach so I got that.  I also used fresh mushrooms and just dumped some in since I like them.  I had a 4 oz- pkg of herb/garlic feta and then added 1/2 container of plain feta.  I used a Cheddar blend shredded cheese.  It baked up very well.  Didn't seem greasy as others have commented but I was surprised by the amount of butter for sauteing the onion and garlic.  I will try to cut down on that in the future.

This is the best recipe...my first quiche. I did listen to reviews, used 2T. butter, 2 cloves garlic, a couple of diced button mushrooms cooked near the end with the onions and garlic, and 3/4 cup milk...perfect! I didn't need quite all of the cheese on top and used an Orononoque Orchards deep dish prepared frozen pie crust. I added 2T of julienned sun-dried tomatoes from a jar cut up fine. I thaw my spinach a bit and then leave it overnight in a sieve over a bowl to drain and then squeeze out the excess water in a towel before using. This was my first quiche and it was awesome! Friends at work loved it. It freezes very well and is great reheated in the oven. The crust even stayed crispy. For new cooks (and I am not a new cook)...PLEASE, put a cookie sheet under the frozen pie crust when you cook the quiche or you will have happen what just happened to me when I made it the second time....it bent in half over my oven door when I went to put it back in the oven after 15 mins!!!! What a mess. I should have known better. Also, don't be afraid to use whatever cheeses you have for the cheddar. For half of it I used a four cheese shredded blend that I already had and then the other half was sharp. You must use some sharp for flavor I think. Make this...your family or friends or just you if you are trying to make ahead some meals will just love it. After thawing pie crust for 15 mins, brush pie crust w/egg wash and cook 7 mins.for crispy crust. Annalou18 helped me. Thanks!

This is delicious.  It is definitely the best quiche that I've ever had.  I did make some changes.  I used half the butter.  I also used 3 eggs and 3/4 cups of milk and I still had some left over. I also added some spices in addition to salt and pepper. I bought a deep dish pie crust since some reviewers said it was too much for one pie.  It fit perfectly. This was delicious and I will definitely be making it again.

the recipe was really good, the one thing i really dislike about the recipe is the amount of butter it calls for 1/2 cup or in other words one whole stick, this recipe is realatively healthy aside from the amount of butter. I  cut the amount of butter in half because you really only need enough butter to salute the onions and garlic in, that is the only thing i would do differently trying to cut back alittle as well. Also I baked mine in a tradional quiche pan ( its like a deep dish tarte pan) this makes for a really good solid quicke with higher sides

What a terrific recipe!  I just started eating a more balanced diet. A great start to add more veggies to a meal.  I made this quiche on Sunday and brown bagged it for lunch with a small green salad. Saved money and and expanding waistline.  It's filling and very tasty!

My family really enjoyed this dish (as did I).  I had made a crustless quiche in the past and my significant other asked me to try one with a crust.  I used bacon and layered it at the bottom, then added the spinach, feta and cheese mixture, then poured the egg mixture on top.  Made it on Christmas Eve and warmed it up in the morning in a 250 degree oven on Christmas morning while the kids were opening their gifts.  It was a HIT!  Definitaly recommend it your family likes quiche.

MMMM this is good. I followed others' advice and for ONE quiche used: half of the spinach (I cooked down fresh), cheese (Mexican mix and Goat Feta (OMG)), garic and onion (white) mixture w/ 2 T butter (I added one roasted red pepper). I then used 6 eggs (3 whole and 3 whites) and 2/3 c. skim milk). The consistency did not turn out like a full fat quiche, but  it still tasted wonderful, and looked very beautiful!

This was my first time making a quiche from scratch and it was delish! Followed the recipe making a few small changes - used only 1/4 c. butter, tomato and basil feta, and a Mexican cheese blend. I did have some egg mix left over after over-stuffing a 9in. deep dish pie crust so next time I will definitely make two. Another change I will make is to put the remaining cheese on the top towards the end of cooking since my cheese was burnt the first time around. Leftovers were good, albeit a bit soggy, but that was to be expected. Really yummy dish with a side salad or soup. Thanks for submitting!

Great recipe! This one works well because the milk and egg ratio is good and you tend to have it on hand more often than half-and-half or cream. I omitted the mushrooms and feta because I didn't have them and it was delish! Also, I've since used this recipe for other types of quiche and the basic base works no matter what you put in it. Love this recipe!

So good. I didn't follow the recipe too closely because I didn't have everything. Used 1/4c butter, onion powder instead of onion, 16 oz of spinach, plain feta but added Italian seasoning and only half the milk. And I didn't measure the cheddar so I'm sure it was more. Good though.

Easy and yummy!  BUT there is enough filling to make TWO pies.  The first time I made this, I filled the pie crust with the spinach mixure and then had barely any room for the egg portion.  The second time, I split the filling into two pies and it was perfect!

The recipe was easy enough, however the herb flavor for me was way over powering.  I think I will try half the feta next time and replace with more cheddar.

This was extremely good and I have a feeling tomorrow it will be even better after all the flavors soak in. I used half the amount of butter and it was more than enough! I also put it in two 9" pans and decreased the cooking time and it served 4 hungry people for lunch with a whole pie left over! Very good!

I only used 2 tablespoons of butter.  Added another egg and more milk and it was enough to make 2. Next time would add 1 more egg and bit more milk so it would be a bit fuller in the pie crusts, but rest of the ingredients were sufficient to make two quiches.

Thank you, Bailey, and BRAVO! What a terrific twist: FETA! My family (of 5) devoured one pie in minutes! Will have to make two next time... Not having frozen spinach, but fresh spinach; and also having fresh mushrooms vs. canned, I sauteed the two first and drained the excess moisture. I then followed your instructions from there. Worked beautifully! Used Italian blend of shredded cheeses, and tomato/basil feta since my grocery store didn't have garlic-herb. Again, great combo. Thanks---quiche fans must try!  ;)

Oh my!!  Yummy is what my husband and I say!  I gave it 5 stars based on how I prepared it.  1.  No butter I always saute in EVOO.  2.  Used fresh spinach and shrooms (canned?? that just aint right)!!!  3.  Regular feta (cause that is what I had on hand).  4. After baking the shell for 7 minutes I lined the dish w/tom's.  5.  Added 1 link of cooked Bratwurst (chopped up) to the spinach mixture. We could have eaten the whole stinkin quiche.

I made this for dinner tonight and my family and I loved it! I did make a few chanages. here we go: 1) I used fresh spinach, 2)i didnt have mushrooms so I used some sundried tomatoes that i had marinated, 3) I only had Bulgarian feta, so I added some sumac (i remembered that in egypt and syria its added to spinach pies), 4) i browned some beef bacon and tossed that into the saute as well, along with a little of the rendered fat. 5) I reduced the milk to 3/4C. 6) I only added a dash of salt to the eggs before i whisked them. OK I admit it... i used all of the butter! those last 2T looked so lonely on the counter, I felt bad (hahahaha) anyway, this is a really easy recipe and takes no real tending, so I could see whipping up one of these on a weeknight again for sure, i will try it with less butter next time (maybe), but i had to try the full fat version first!

Love this recipe and so does my meat eating husband! It's always a hit, I've been making it consistantly for a few years now.  The only reason this doesn't get a 5 is that the measurements are a bit off. I keep everything the same except the eggs, add 2-3 more then the recipe calls for and you will have 2 quiches.  I also have used these ingredients, minus the egg and milk in veggie stromboli - delish!

Really good--the kids actually ate it.  Definitely skip the butter, except a little to saute onions, garlic and fresh mushrooms.  We didn't miss it all.

This quiche is amazing!  I've made it, like, 8 times since I found the recipe--a month ago!!  My four year-old son loves it to; he and I usually fight over the last piece :-)

I made this for a potluck at work and it got the most rave reviews from everyone. I made it as is and it was great! I'll be making this again and again.

12.29.15 - 5 years later after my first review of this quiche and I have continued to make this easy quiche. It never disappoints.

This is a great recipe!  I cut back the butter to 1 Tbsp and followed the rest of the directions exactly.  It came out perfect and I will be making it again.

Came out perfectly. I did end up making two of them as I can't possibly figure out how any one could  fit all of it in one pie pan but I kept the 4 eggs and 1/2 cup of milk to each pie pan. I only had to bake them for 25 min total to have them be set. Great dinner-the kids ate it up!

I used the full amount of butter recommended in the recipe, and though it seemed like way too much in the beginning the result was quite good. I may still cut out a bit of the butter next time.

This is yummie, seems like it needs a little more spice of some kind though. I read the other reviews of how big the pie is and went ahead and devided it to make two pies. Work out great that way. Thanks for the recipe

I made this last week and it tasted great! I did take some suggestions from the website and cut the butter to 1.5 tbs and I used 1/2 cup of milk. I baked my pie crust for 4 minutes before hand as well.

This was really easy to make and really good! Like others, I modified to make it lower in fat. I used one TBS of olive oil and no butter. I used lowfat cheddar cheese and skim milk (about 3/4 cup).  I also used fresh spinach and no mushrooms. I reduced cooking time by about 15 min.

For those of you that are rookie, unexperienced quiche makers (or maybe cooks altogether) like myself. BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO OVERFILL! I haven't tried the quiche yet because I am in the process of cleaning up an egg catastrophe  :)

Really good. I added bacon. I had trouble understanding when to take it out of the oven, though. It seemed so wet so I kept it in for at least an extra twenty minutes but I think that may just be because there is so much butter in this recipe. I will definitely make this recipe again.

Great recipe! I used fresh veggies and added red bell pepper. Like some of the others, I doubled the eggs and milk and made this into two quiches. They were still overflowing!

This was my first time making quiche and my fiance, 7-year-old and I LOVED it.  I left out the mushrooms, added bacon bits and prebaked the pie crust for 5 minutes or so.  It was perfect.  We're even planning on using this recipe to serve at our wedding reception.  Thank you!!

This recipe is delicious!  I used fresh mushrooms and only used about a half stick of butter, instead of the full stick called for in the recipe.  I also found that my pie crust (which was a deep dish) was overflowing, so I split the mixture in half and made two quiches.  The spinach & mushroom mixture was absolutely fabulous!  I would serve that alone as a side dish!

Very good! This was my first time making quiche, and I thought it was successful. I did not have a full package of the feta, but I used as much as I could (would have been better with the whole package) and then used more cheddar. I also didn't use the deep dish pie crust because I had an extra regular one in the freezer. As a result, a lot of the filling spilled out (my own fault). Next time I will make sure to use a deep dish.

Yummy.  My husband loved it.  I used fresh spinach instead of frozen and left out the mushrooms.  I sauteed about 1/2 cup of green peppers with it instead and added 1/2 cup sour cream to the eggs.  I used olive oil instead of butter.  So very good!

This is a great basic recipe but I definitely recommend playing around with what you add to the filling. I put sliced tomatoes on top after adding the remainder of the cheddar and thought that it added a little more depth to the flavor. I also added sage to the veggie mixture. Very excited to try other combos!

Less egg and more cheese than your average quiche, which is a very good thing. I always adapt recipes, so I cut the milk and crust (inessential), doubled the garlic, used fresh spinach & mushrooms, and added artichoke hearts. As I was preparing this for a brunch we were throwing, my husband assured me that he didn't like quiche and would stick to the chocolate chip pancakes, thank you very much. Then he tried a piece to be nice and almost passed out! And I quote..."This is the BEST breakfast food I've ever eaten. Can we eat this all the time?" : ) It does have a lot of butter (that's why it's so yummy!), but it's so rich I think it's quite easy to feel satisfied eating a reasonable piece. It will last for several meals! Just serve a piece with some carbohydrates (croissants, biscuits, pancakes, waffles, etc.) or a salad so folks can fill up with some less rich food.   Oh, our guests loved it too! Everyone said, "REALLY good quiche." and "What did you do to this?!" with notes of surprise that were entirely satisfying. I will definitely make this again!

Delicious! It didn't all fit in one pie crust. I'd suggest you cook it on a foil-lined cookie sheet. Looking forward to trying it again and reducing the calories if possible.

First time making this. I used fresh mushrooms and sauteed them with the onion and garlic. I also used mozzarella instead of cheddar... just because that's what I had in the fridge. Delicious!

This is very good!  I followed the directions exactly as written; however, as others have noted, I only used half of the egg & milk mixture.  It also browned too quickly so I covered it with foil for the last 10 minutes and only baked it 28 minutes after the cheese was added.

I did something different to the butter--heating over medium heat until brown and screening it off with cheesecloth. Then add back the brown butter into sauteed onions and spinach mix. The result is amazing, I'm guessing that's what the large amount of butter is for. Also I used 1/2 cup of evaporated milk instead.

This review is mostly based on the response I got from the women in my church group.  They all raved about the flavor.  The only change I made was that I cut down the butter to two tablespoons.  I would have given this five stars but there was too much egg/milk mixture.  I filled the deep dish pie crust until full and I still had plenty left over.  It made a mess while baking.  Good thing I had it on a cookie sheet.  Overall this is a great recipe and I'm adding it to my recipe box.

Delicious!! I made with plain feta (don't like Italian seasons), added a tad of nutmeg (advice from Rachael Ray) and omitted mushrooms.  I used a 9.5" deep dish pan and it all fit perfectly. My family loved this! I will make again and again, Thanks!

I, like some of the others, agree, that the ingredients are enough for two smaller quiches, which is great! I think the feta made it great as well! It is probably the best quiche I have ever made and I have made a LOT of quiche. I would add this though, to cover the edges of the crust with foil so not to over brown it. Other wise it i the perfect recipe!

Very Successful! I made a pate brisee pie shell, covered it with foil until the last 20 minutes (to prevent burning) and it turned out golden, flaky and rich. I used fresh mushrooms and cooked it at 400 degrees the last 5-10 minutes so the cheese would brown and the middle set quicker. Will make this again.

Excellent recipe - my brunch guests loved it.  This is my first quiche, and I am so glad that I used this recipe.  I used two regular pie crusts, pre-baked them, divided the spinach mixture into each one, and poured the egg mixture equally on top of each one.    I did drain the spinach and mushrooms very well, pressing them against paper towels.  The only deviation was to use 1.5TB of butter. I will be making this again.

Yummy quiche.  I used 1/4 cup butter instead of 1/2 cup and I steamed the spinach from fresh.

Quiche has been our Christmas morning tradition for years, and after this year, this recipe will be the only one I ever use!  It is definitely the best quiche I have ever had in my life.  Following the advice of commenters before me, I altered the recipe to suit my tastes and what I had on hand.  Instead of mushrooms I used canned artichoke hearts and some red bell pepper.  I had 2 frozen pie shells on hand, so I baked them ahead of time to make sure they stayed crispy, and I used both because this recipe makes a lot of filling.  (Even after dividing the filling between two pie shells, I couldn't fit more than 3 eggs on top of each.)  This was not only easy and quick to prepare, but also very delicious.  YUM!

This quiche is absolutely amazing!!!  I've been making it every Christmas morning for about 3 years now, and everyone thinks it is awesome!  I just made one today, because this year I am trying clarks quiche for our annual christmas breakfast, just because it had so many rave reviews, but needed my spinach quiche fix so decided to make it just for the heck of it.  I made one for my mom and grandma also, and they just loved it.  You won't be dissapointed (as long as you like mushrooms, feta and spinach).  Yummy!!!!!

Very good!  I also used fresh mushrooms and sauted them in olive oil (with the onions and garlic).  I omitted butter.  Used unseasoned feta, but tossed in some oregano and basil.  Way too much filling for one 9" pie, so also made 6 muffin cups full.

Excellent recipe.  I only had 2 eggs so I made it in a shallow dish, reduced the amount of milk and added sundried tomatoes - Fabuloso!  It tastes exactly like my favorite Quiche from our local Omelette Shoppe restaurant.  Thanks for posting!

Excellent and fast becoming a favorite.  Good for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike!  Slight variation on the ingredients by using 1+ cup of sliced fresh mushrooms.  Fast easy and delicious!

this is a wonderful recipe! after trying this my husband declared that "real men eat quiche!" i have a house of picky eaters so the mushrooms were left out, but we did add chicken. i browned a shredded chicken breast with the garlic and onion. it gets better every time i make it! this last time i divided the mixture between two frozen pilsbury pie shells. the sweetness of the shells gives the flavor another level. thank you so very much for this wonderful recipe!!

Maybe I did something wrong but this didn't quite work for me. There wasn't enough egg and too much spinach in this for me and my pie crust wasn't anywhere near cooked. I wish I had cooked it at least a little bit before adding the filling.   I think I'll take the lessons I learned from this but won't make it again.

I absolutely love this recipe. Very yummy. The only thing I don't like about it is that it is quite fattening. I cut out some of the butter to feel better about it.

This is one of my favorite dishes.  I used less butter or oil, also fresh mushrooms about 1 1/2 cups.  I also use two regular size pie pans instead of a deep dish.  The garlic herb feta make the recipe delicious!

Very tasty, even though I only used half of the amount of cheddar cheese. I also had regular 9 inch pie crusts (not deep dish), and the mixture made enough to fill both. This recipe was very easy to make and leftovers are great!

Delicious Recipe! I substituted corn oil instead of butter, used fresh spinach and golden chanterelle mushrooms, and it turned out wonderful. The recipe made two pies instead of one.  Definitely a keeper.

This was my first time making a quiche.  I couldn't find herbed feta so I used plain and just added my own herbs.  It was a huge hit with my family and I'm sure I will make it again.  Served with a side salad and breadsticks. Yummy!

I did as another reviewer recommended; and doubled the eggs; and divided the rest between two pie pans.  Added fresh (saute'd) mushrooms instead of canned ones, didn't use feta (personal taste; used cheddar instead in chunks; and colby on top) and added some brocolli and spring onion too (had excess int he garden, and the kids like brocoli; but they don't like spinach; trying to come even a bit; we love spinach; grow it, kids don't like it at all); and fresh baby spinach leaves.  We loved it; but failed on the kids level... ohh, well, gotta cook something for us adults sometimes; too!  Thanks for the recipe; will use it again and again... perhaps trying different ingredients to get the kids to like them too; as it's a great way to use up excess eggs (as we get plenty; both duck and chicken; get about 8 eggs a day at the moment for a family of four...  always looking for ways to use them up, and this fits the ticket wonderfully!)

I made some changes. I added a 12oz package of bacon. Used a little bit of the bacon grease to fry the onion and garlic. I don't like mushrooms or feta cheese so I just didn't add them. I didn't add any cheese to the spinach mix but I did add a little of the bacon. I put some of the cheese and bacon into the egg mix. I put the rest of the bacon in the bottom of the pie crust then some cheese. I put the spinach next with the last of the cheese and then the egg mix. I don't usually like quiche and this was great.

I should've read the most useful reviews! I used this recipe with the "Butter Flaky Pie Crust" from this site, and it was too much for my regular pie plate. It actually was so watery; it went above my pie crust and underneath it! I thought the quiche was ruined for sure! Baked it for 50 minutes and it turned out great, though I'm sure the crust would've tasted better had I not filled it so much. Subbed blue cheese for the feta, and next time I'll use half the milk it calls for.

8/3/2009: Very tasty!  I made it half-sized, and on top of that I cut down on the butter and a bit on the milk.  I baked the pie shell for 7 min first, too.
Feb 2016:  I made it as-is but with 2/3c milk because I didn't think it would fit.  It made too much filling and it cooked over in the oven.  I would make the filling with 2 pie crusts next time.

Fantastic and easy recipe!  I took the advice of another reviewer and baked the piecrust for 5 mins before filling it.  Also, I only used about 2 Tbsp of butter and cut back on the fillings - I didn’t want them to overpower the eggs.  The combo of flavors was great - especially the feta cheese.

I followed the recipe using some reviewers’ suggestions of 1 tbsp butter, 3 oz of feta and 4 oz cheddar and omitting the mushrooms (didn’t have any) and it was delicious. Thank you for sharing Bailey.

Excellent!  Everyone here LOVED it!  Even my father, who does not like Feta Cheese at all, loved it.

This was sooo yummy! I made this at brunch for guests last week and it turned out great. I used a little less than half a stick of butter.  I would also advise browning the crust for a few minutes to get the bottom done.

I think this recipe is great! I have made it twice so far and both times it has come out excellent. the only thing i would say, as have other reviewers, that the measurements are a little off. I think there was too much butter, and a little too much spinach that when i put the egg mixture in, i couldn't fit all of it.  with a little tweaking, this could definitely be an A+!

This was pretty tasty, but it definately makes enough for two quiches! I didn't have another pie crust,  so I just put the rest of the filling and eggs and milk into a pie plate and it still turned out tasty without a crust. I used regular feta, fresh mushrooms, and colby instead of cheddar because this is what I had on hand, and the flavors worked well. Thanks for the recipe because u needed a recipe ibcould through together in a pinch with what I had on hand. This way we had leftover to to eat for breakfast in the morning. Made this for dinner and also served with salad and bread on the side. Perfect!

I made this today for lunch with a friend. It was my first time making a quiche. I pricked and baked the pie shells for 8-9 mins. Then, as a friend suggested, I spread some mustard on the crust before adding the egg mixture. I omitted the butter, cooking fresh spinach, with garlic and onion, in a little olive oil. Then I drained the mixture before adding it to egg mixture. I also cut back the milk to between 1/2 and 2/3 of a cup. I used canned, condensed milk in this recipe. I used regular feta cheese. I added more cheddar to the mixture and less for a topping.I waited about 20 mins into cooking to add the top cheddar. This recipe made two quiches. Even though the oven is a very good one, my quiches required an extra 5-10 mins cook time. It came out perfect!! I served it with a greek salad w/ greek vinagrette. Thanks for the recipe! I will definitely be making this one again:)

I made this twice. The first time following the recipe's measurements (except I used all fresh veggies). The 2nd time, I made 2 9-inch shells, doubled the veggies, but kept the egg mixture the same and made 2 quiches. We all liked it much better. This is 1st time I've used soft cheese in a quiche and it was great!

Amazing taste. I did precook the crust for about 6 minutes, as someone else suggested. I also used less cheddar.  This did make too much for one quiche so I put all of the spinach/cheese mix in the crust & poked a few holes in it so the egg would get in. Then I poured as much of the egg mix in that would fit & tossed the rest. Next time I will probably make 1/2 the egg mix. Everyone loved it and they commented how much more they liked it than other quiches BECAUSE it was not eggy. One person who didn't like quiche said it was the first thing she ate.

Excellent!  I used 2-3 T of butter; fresh spinach in place of frozen; no mushrooms and plain feta.  I added fresh basil and oregano.

SO GOOD! The blend of cheeses melts in your mouth! I thought there would be too much spinach, but it really added to the texture of the dish. Even my picky 12-year-old brother liked it!

WAY too much cheese.  totally covered up the taste of the feta and spinach.  Next time, I'll cut the cheddar in half if not out entirely.

Was really really tasty! I used a herbed feta in oil and it added a bad taste, so I definatly wont use that again, one of the herbs was too strong, but the rest of the recipe was amazing!

I used this recipe to make little mini-quiches and they received rave reviews (I have an egg allergy, and could not eat them). I didn't have any mushrooms on hand, so I didn't add those, but I did add some finely chopped carrots. I used a combination of fresh and frozen spinach. These freeze well and are super easy to heat up in the morning for a quick breakfast!

I used 10oz. of chopped, thawed broccoli instead of spinach, half a 10oz. package of fresh mushrooms chopped and only used about 3oz. of feta since that's all I had on hand. I didn't put the cheeses in the cooking pan for fear of it melting and creating a tougher mess to clean up. I put the veggies in the pie crust, sprinkled with the cheeses and then covered with the egg mixture. Used the easy No Fail Pie Crust III. Turned out great!

I used less butter than the recipe calls for, skipped the mushrooms, used shallots instead of an onion.  Then, I added some ham chunks and used various cheeses: cheddar, Gouda, etc.  It made enough for a 9" pie pan (with crust - I used "Cheesy Quiche Crust" recipe) plus 2 small ramekins.  Very very tasty!  The consistency was really nice too... Oh, and really drain the frozen spinach to help reduce the liquids!

If you are reading these reviews: trust me, you have to make this quiche.  You will not be disappointed, it is so good. I only used 2TBSP of butter, a cube is way too much. I added sweet italian sausage and used fresh spinach and fresh mushrooms.  Could only find regular feta. My 7yr old loved it also. Delish!

This has become one of my staple dishes.  It's absolutely delicious!  I always make 2 pies out of it by using the normal amount of spinach and adding an extra egg and a little more milk, and lots more cheddar and feta cheese.  The added feta make it even more delicious.  The recipe is very versatile though and come out good no matter what variation you choose.  Just make sure you add enough salt and pepper!

Super easy recipe and very yummy!  I left out onions and mushrooms because I don't like them, and used much less butter to cut down on the fat.  I used leftover ham, spinach, feta and cheddar and it was so good!  Next time, I think I'll leave the cheddar off the top.  That made it a bit too rich for me.  Bravo!

It was pretty easy to make!  I used, I think, half the butter noted, and that worked out, though I would go with less spinach next time.  Just was saturated with the green stuff.

This recipe is so unbelievable easy and delicious! I've made it without all the butter and it still tasted just as good. I usually skip out on the feta and I add fresh mushrooms and zucchini. You really could add whatever you want and it will taste delicious!

Followed recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing. The garlic and herb feta made this recipe. It's bursting with flavor and was even better the next day. This is the one I'll use from now on.

Excellent quiche! The first time I made it, added a little extra salt, but it definitely doesn't need any.

Great quiche!! I found this recipe very forgiving as others have mentioned. I used kale instead of spinach which gave it a very nice body. I also used a mix of feta, mozzarella, and parmesan cheeses that worked very well.

This is delicious!  I made mine with fresh spinach and mushrooms.  I sauteed the mushrooms with the onions and garlic.  I didn't have any feta in the house, so I substituted fresh parm....it was wonderful!  I'm making it again tonight!

Great Recipe:  I used cheddar cheese instead of Feta because I just don't like Feta.  I also added a can of drained Rotel tomatoes.  It gave it just a little spice.  I loved this.  Thanks for sharing! :)

This quiche was delicious! I added some bacon (I cheated with pre-cooked bacon; microwaved 5 slices and crumbled it in between the spinach mixture and the egg) and it was great.  I just had some leftovers for lunch, reheated in the microwave and it tasted even better than the first day!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Very delicious!!  I'd recommend cutting back on the spinach to a little less than one whole package; otherwise the egg mixture will not all fit into the pie shell.  The butter is way too much....just use enough to sautee the onion mixture.  Precook the shell though or it will be runny.

This was good. I used about 8oz spinach, regular feta cheese that i seasoned with herbs for my garden, I did not add the mushrooms since I dont like them, and about 3/4 cup of sharp cheddar chesse that I sprinkle on top. I waited more than 15 minutes to sprinkle it since i was afraid it would sink. Besides that I followed the recipe and it was superb.

Phenomenal! everyone LOved! lot's of room for variations.. few changes: used 1/2 the butter, omitted the mushrooms because i didn't have any, added small cubes of spam (because i love spam and couldn't help myself), only used 3 eggs (cus that's all i had), and rice dreams instead of milk (it's what was in the fridge), didn't have any cheddar so used shredded jack cheese.. added shredded parmesan on top the last 10 min of baking. it made a beautiful crust. it was sOO delish!  I only got to eat a slice because the leftovers mysteriously disappeared.. =P

only used 3TBS of butter-plenty!  i baked the crust first for 5 minutes.  I used 6 eggs instead of 4 and then and was able to evenly divide the ingredients into 2 pie crusts (it was too much spinich/cheese/mushroom for one).  The feta cheese MAKES this dish!

Kind of tasted like Greek spanakopita.  Ok, but I've had better quiche combos.  Only used 1/4 cup of butter or a 1/2 stick...seemed crazy to use a whole stick.

By family loved this quiche- even my two year old, although he did eat around the spinach!  Here's the couple subs I made:  fresh spinach (I recommend squeezing the water out of it if you use this b/c my quiche was a bit watery), shallots instead of onions, and blue cheese instead of feta.  I also reduced the butter to about 2 T.  ENJOY!

Loved it - Used this healthier variation/substitution:

Substitutions:
2T butter instead of 1/2 cup (for saute)
Fresh Spinach 10oz instead of frozen
1/2 onion instead of full
no garlic
Lactaid instead of milk (made it lighter)
A little more garlic herbed feta (softer garlic taste - more cheese)
Reduced fat italian mixed cheeses instead of cheddar
Tomato sliced placed on top instead of muchrooms.

Preparation Changes:
- Melt the 2T butter in a skillet, saute the onion on one side as you saute down the spinach.  As the onion starts to turn golden, mix the two together.  salt/pepper to taste.  Remove from the burner to cool long enough for you to get the cheese ready.  Quickly mix together and then spoon into the pie crust.  Then follow the rest of the recipe.

Thanks to the original author because it's the best recipe I've used.

Yes, yes, yes!! Fantastic. This is the first time I've made a quiche, and it was perfect! I made it into 2 pies and omitted the feta (not a fan). The kids were so excited about a "veggie pie".

I have been using this recipe for a few years now, and I LOVE it!  It is great as it is, or I use it as a base recipe and switch around the fillings.  I have used it for everything from a breakfast quiche (sausage/bacon/onion/peppers/cheddar) to zucchini pie (zucchini/parmesan/cheddar). Thank you for sharing this one!

1st time: Made per recipe directs.
2nd time: Sauteed in a little oil.  Used cheddar and monterrey jack instead of feta,but less cheese overall than the recipe calls for. Added spices (& vinegar) used in Quiche Supreme on this site.

We had a brunch today and made several quiches, one of which was this one.  It was very good, very easy, and set up well.

I mixed everything together before I put it into the pie crust. My husband said that he liked it as he was taking his first bites but then said later that he could not stop eating it. He had 3 pieces. Later on my cousin came over and I offered her some left overs. She told me the exact same thing and ended up leaving with rest of it.

This was so good!  I followed the recipe but used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and low fat cheeses.  Also used half the butter the recipe called for.  It was excellent!  We can't wait for tomorrow's leftovers!

This is a tasty recipe.  I would cut down on the amount of butter and milk, only because it seems to take longer to bake.  This quiche travels well and is even better the 2nd day.

Wow, yum yum good!  Great flavors!  The first time I made this I used heavy cream instead of milk and it was awesome.  The second time I used milk like you are suppose to and it was still awesome!  I always end up having too much milk/eggs so I have started cutting the amount of milk and eggs in half and that works really well.  This is a great dish to make and then stick in the fridge and reheat later...I personally think it's best that way.

This was REALLY GOOD. I had to give 4 stars because it's a GOOD THING that pie crusts come in 2 packs, LOL! This made so much filling that I had to grab the spare shell from the freezer, and scoop half the filling from the other, overflowing, shell.   In order to get the 2 shells nice and full, I added in an extra egg each.  The only other thing I changed was adding a little bell pepper and fresh seeded tomato to make up for no mushrooms (I hate mushrooms). I cooked the peppers with the onion and garlic, and added the tomatoes right before the egg (so they wouldn't disintegrate). Everyone loved it, which is saying something coming from my veggi-phobic family. And yes. I definitely used deep dish crusts ...

Very very good. There was too much butter in the recipe for my liking so I used only 1/4 cup. I added an extra egg and used skim milk...it set perfectly. I also used 7-8 ounces of fresh mushrooms and cooked them with the garlic and onion until soft before adding the spinach. As someone suggested before I cooked the pie crust for about 8 minutes before adding the filling to prevent a soggy bottom. This quiche was the best quiche I've ever made.

This was ok.  I thought it could use a little more egg & cheese but a little less spinach.  I did pre-bake the crust. You must dock the crust (prick it all over the bottom with a fork) to keep it from puffing up.  
Next time I'll try 6 eggs and I'll mix the cooled spinach & mushrooms with the eggs & milk before I pour into the deep dish pie plate.

This was delicous! I followed the directions exactly except for leaving out the mushrooms which I don't like.  Although my kids weren't crazy about it, my husband and I loved it! My brother-in-law stopped by the next day and had a piece. The funny thing is both my husband and brother-in-law asked me where I bought it when they first tasted it. Will make again.

I made it for brunch on Easter and got rave reviews from my family. The only changes I made were the following (just to make it a little healthier and more flavorful): --I used a whole-wheat pie crust (from Whole Foods) --olive oil instead of butter for the sauteed onions --fresh mushrooms instead of canned which I sauteed along with the onions. I will definitely be making this again! Thanks, Bailey!

This was superb! I only wanted to make one so I cut the entire recipe in half. I used the five cheese italian blend of cheeses with a small handfull of cheddar too, and sprinkled the Italian cheese on top. I also added chunky salsa per my likes and 1/2 teaspoon celery salt. My entire family loved the spinach once I made them try it. It has been voted a keeper at our house. Thanks for this great recipe!!

The recipe was very good, though the directions for the spinach mixture gave me way too much, it was more like two 9 inch pans worth. I only wish I would have had two crusts ready.

Yup, darn good quiche.  Would've been even better if I hadn't burned the crust.  I prebaked the crust to prevent soggy bottom but then when I baked the whole thing the crust got double-baked and a wee bit too done for my liking.  I just broke it off and then it was just perfect.  A great recipe.  Make sure you drain your spinach well!

Fabulous recipe. I modified slightly to ensure it fit into the crust. I only used 3 eggs, regular feta (added garlic and herb spice mix instead), and fresh mushrooms. So good in fact, I pureed some of the spinach and mushroom mixture for my 7 month old and he couldn't eat it fast enough. I will make this over and over again.

This is VERY good, but VERY greasy!  To make it more healthy, I would use 1/4 cup butter instead of 1/2 cup, or maybe even 1/8 cup.  With the oils from the cheese and that much butter it becomes way too greasy.  Otherwise, oh my!  It's great!!!

Very good. I halved the butter and will use even less next time. Didn't use a crust either and it came out great. Added 3 slices of crumbled bacon... yum!

Delicious! Did make some changes, omitted the onion, used onion powder, added a dash of paprika and nutmeg.  Sauted the spinach in butter. Used swiss, chedder (1/4 cup)and feta (minus the garlic/herb seasoning-sounds like alot however it wasn't. Turned out great. Used a 9" deep dish pie crust-didn't overflow. Will continue to make.

Wonderful!  I made a few changes. I didn't use a pie crust. I just poured the mixture strait into a deep dish pie plate. I also used less egg. I didn't want it too eggy so I only 3 eggs instead of four. It still came out great!!! Would definitely make again!

Very good. Always well-received. Update 03/09/10 - I'm upgrading this to five stars because this has been a no-fail, very impressive recipe every time I've made it. Everyone enjoys eating it and it is indeed very accommodating to whatever you have in your fridge! I had forgotten to get spinach and substituted frozen chopped broccoli; I also didn't have enough feta so I made up the difference with cream cheese. Delicious! Another note: I ALWAYS  make this with the no-fail pie crust recipe on this website and EVERY TIME someone comments on how great the crust is. Thanks for this delicious recipe.

This recipe turned out great!  Call me crazy but, there was no way I was getting all of that in one 9" deep dish pie crust, on the plus side, it made 2 perfect quiches.  Yummy!

My 4 yr old request this at least once a week! Great recipe :) I did chnage a few things...I use fresh spinach, egg beaters, reduced fat feta cheese and use half of the cheddar cheese to top it with.

Followed this recipe to a "T", but once the egg mixture was added to spinach and cheese mixture, it overflowed quite a bit. I will definitely altar this recipe if I make it again.

This was excellent. It was a great success at our Christmas party. I did make a few changes. I didn't add mushrooms.  Ithawed out the frozen spinach over the stove (no water added). Once thawed I placed the spinach between paper towels and squeeae out the rest of the moisture.  auted onions and garlic in a little olive oil. Melted 1/4 cup of butter. Used cream instead of milk. Used a little italian seasons, because I didn't have flavored cheese.

Delicious! Even my 1 year old loved it. This was my first attempt at quiche and it turned out perfect. I baked the crust for 5 minutes before putting the mixture in as one reviewer suggested and the crust was not soggy at all. I'll definitely be making this again! Thanks!

I could not stop eating this. Wow is this good! Everyone, even my nine month old baby, loved this quiche. It's very easy to make and so yummy. I think next time I make it I may cut the cheese like in half and use a bit less butter so I wont feel like I have to do 50 stomach crunches after I eat it.

Awesome awesome recipe!!  As stated - very forgiving - so work with what you have.  I only ever use regular feta, fresh mushrooms, and even fresh spinach and whatever cheese I have around, and it comes out nothing short of fantastic!  I also make them in batches and then freeze them, which works great when company comes over unexpectedly!

12/3/2007This is the best spinach quiche I have ever had in my life.I wasn't able to fit all the egg/milk mixture in with the veggies, but who cares...it turned out great regardless!!! UPDATE: Still just as good, same problems arise. I love this quiche though.

This was sooooo yummy.  My family who was wary about having quiche ate it all up. The only thing I did differenly from the original recipe was to omit the butter and just sautee the the onions and garlic in a pan sprayed iwth pam.

Everyone that has tasted this quiche has loved it. Two things I did differently. One, I sauteed the mushrooms with the onions making them even more tender. And two, I added two more eggs and made 2 quiches with this recipe. My pie crusts were not deep enough for one.

I have never made a quiche before and you really cant screw it up. Used less butter and added extra cheddar cheese. I give it 5 starts even though I gave myself a 3rd degree burn on my hand making it. (Oven mitts people!)

This is a great recipe! I made for an early afternoon party with the girls and it was a huge success! Only change I made to the recipe was to use heavy cream instead of milk. Would make a great side dish for almost any meal, but is also wonderful all by itself!! I will make this again for sure. Thanks for a great recipe, Bailey!

My father really enjoyed this pie. Some reviewers said to use less milk which I wouldn't do again. I like a more "custardy" pie so next time I'm going to add 1/2 creme and 1/2 skim in order to achieve a lighter pie. All in all, a good recipe. I used feta without the flavoring and it was awesome!

fantastic!!!  My hubby & I really enjoyed this dish.  After reading the reviews, I used a deep dish 10" pie pan with a homemade crust.  It was perfect.  I also cut the butter to 6 Tble (3/4 stick) Next time, I'll reduce it down to 3 Tble.  It was a tad greasy. Was delicious, had it for dinner, next day's lunch, & a snack. Great Recipe !!! Thanks

Love this recipe even more every time I make it and I always serve it to rave reviews. I sprinkle top with crumbled bacon, sliced green onions and cheese during the last 10-15 minutes in the oven. Delish!!

This turned out beautiful.  It's important to make sure that you use a deep-dish pie crust, as a normal one would be thin enough to get soggy.  Make sure that you're spinach is really well-drained.  It was a little greasy the first time I made it, I think you can as much as half the amount of butter to help this.  A great meal served with fruit or waldorf salad!

I was a little disappointed in this one, but maybe only because I have 5* that I was hoping to match. A little cafe where I work makes the BEST spinach quiche and I was hoping this would taste like it. unfortunately it was a little bland in comparison....

This recipe is absolutely fantastic!  My husband was a bit leary because he had never had quiche before but he loved it!  I took the advice of other reviewers and split into 2 deep dish pie shells.  I had another cup of Cheddar cheese when putting the cheese on top so that both were very cheesy on top, otherwise followed the exact recipe.  I will definitely be making this one again!

Use less milk. Otherwise, this is such a great recipe.  I make it every time I have bring a dish to a brunch or luncheon, and every time I have people raving about how wonderful it is!  I've also tried using just egg whites (6-7 egg whites) and it turns out healthier and still delicious.

What a wonderful dish!  It is very forgiving as I have fiddled with the ingredients as well.  I usually don't use a crust either.  Tonight I gave the recipe over the phone to my mother!

I made my own crust for this recipe and also substituted my preference for cheese. You can do both easily and it will still come out delicious. Really most cheeses will work for this recipe so, go with what you prefer or have on hand.
My only small criticism (not really criticism...more like preference)is that I thought it could use a little extra something. Something like chopped ham would taste lovely in this.
I'm going to try this next time!
Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I tried this recipe 3 years ago and made a couple of them for my sister's bridal shower.  EVERYONE WANTED THIS RECIPE.  This was an explosion of wonderful flavor and I've been using it ever since.  Might I add that it's lighter then most quiches out there.  Who says you need cream to make a Quiche?  Thanks!!!!

This quiche was great and super easy, even for a first-time quiche baker! My only tiny complaint was that it was rather crumbly, and it did not stay together in a pie-slice shape as I served it. Maybe more eggs will glue it together.

My husband and I both agreed this was the best quiche we had ever had.  It's fabulous!  I'll try the suggestion of making it without a pie crust and with low fat cheddar next time to cut the calories, but definitely won't skimp on the garlic and herb feta.

This quiche was absolutely delicious! I fried up some turkey bacon and crumbled it into the spinach mixture and it was perfect. Any meat would taste great in this.

This recipe is the BEST spinach quiche I have ever tasted! So easy to prepare, and besides the feta cheese, made with ingredients that are common to most households! I substituted reduced fat plain feta and used colby cheese instead of the cheddar and it was fantastic! Have made this many times and it is gone before the day is done!

Excellent harmony between the spinach and feta.  A very rich quiche, indeed, I only used about half of the suggested amount of butter.

I don't know what to rate this b/c while I loved the taste, there's just so much  butter!!!  I will make this again and I don't want to discourage anyone from making it, but I will cut the butter in at least half.

I was so excited to make this, but ended up a little disappointed. Per some reviewers, there was too much filling, so I halved the entire filling for one regual pie crust and it worked perfectly. But, the quiche just would not set. I had it in the oven for about an hour at 375, and it was still soggy.

The first quiche to be devoured at our Easter brunch.  It's pretty decadent so I would only make it for special occasions with large crowds so I have just a small wedge.

Excellent!!!  Every time I make this everyone loves it - we cook it for brunch on the weekend for company and eat it throughout the week.  You can't go wrong cooking this recipe.

Oh so yumm! I made my own quiche crust then followed this recipe exactly. The spinach goes so well with the feta cheese, and both are nicely complemented with the garlic. I love cheese but I am thinking that the addition of the cheddar is unnecesary here - makes it a bit too tough and overpowers the spinach too much for me. but otherwise, a perfectly tasty recipe. Love the mushrooms in there!

IT's definetly forgiving. I used no butter, only a smidge of olive oil, and chorizo and onion instead of other ingredients. I used the "pastry for a double crust" recipe for the crust...
Delicious! Only took 30 minutes to cook for me...

I made this for my husband's family after Thanksgiving and got RAVE reviews on it. I added in bacon, used regular feta, and it made 2 quiches. This was gone within minutes and it even got the kids to eat spinach. I've already had requests to make it again. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

This is the best quiche recipe that I have used.  My husband, who is a very picky eater, nearly ate half of the quiche.  I omitted the mushrooms and added some diced ham.  It was wonderful.

This recipe was somewhat of a disaster for me, but I'm giving it 3 stars based on its potential. When I put the filling into the pie crust, the spinach mixture nearly filled the entire crust. There was very little room for the egg mixture, and it ended up overflowing. I did follow the recipe and did use the 9-inch deep pie crust, so I'm wondering if the proportions are off. I'd make it again but next time use TWO pie crusts. The flavor was good, so I can see why it's getting good reviews. Seems like a lot of people are modifying the recipe using less butter and milk and fewer eggs so maybe I'll give that a try.

Every time I make this for guests, they rave about it.  I use an 8 oz package of sliced fresh mushrooms instead of the jar (saute in a little Pam or olive oil to make tender).  I also omit some of the grated cheese (not the feta though!) b/c husband is lactose intolerant.  This IS a very forgiving recipe!

What a great quiche!  Made it for brunch along with Clark's quiche (for the meat lovers) and it was a big hit.  Used sliced fresh mushrooms which I sauted for the final two minutes in with the onions and garlic and everyone raved about how good it was.  Thanks Bailey!

Great blend of flavors - if you like the flavor of spinach, I would definitely use fresh, especially now when it's in season.  Also, to cut down on fat/carbs/calories, I use 3 tortillas instead of pie crust (I stole this from some cookbook).  You can get different flavors that way too.

Excellent!  I added some diced ham.  Used fresh spinach that I nuked then chopped.  Increased chedddar since I did not have feta. Didn't have mushrooms either - result: incredible!  Next time I'll try it with everything - I'm sure it'll be delicious!!! Great with Best Ever Pie Crust!

Put only 2 egg yokes and added one more egg white. We liked it a lot.

Best quiche I've ever had.  Cut back on the butter, but other than that, followed the recipe exactly.  It fit perfectly into my 10" pie dish.

I tried this for my family on Christmas morning and it was a big hit! I just used regular feta, left out the mushrooms, and added a bit of monterey jack cheese..and it was just delicious. It made 2 pies though which suited the family just fine!

I made this for my baby shower and it was absolutely delicious!  I also added some fresh basil leaves on top before adding the final amount of cheddar cheese and that made it just a bit more scrumptous!!!  I highly recommend this recipe!  Although not the healthiest - it is seriously delicious!

I had a Christmas Party for work today and everyone raved about how wonderful the spinach quiche was. I did change the recipe though. I skipped the mushrooms, only used 2 tablespoons of margarine. I also read a review and added two tablespoons of olive oil as well. I also used regular low fat feta chesse. It was a definite sensation! I heard people say that it was the best quiche ever, and that they don't even like spinach! I will definetly make it again and again! Thans for sharing! YUMMY!!

What a lovely twist to the usual spinach quiche.  The feta cheese adds a rich flavor.  I have already received requests from family members to make this again.

My husband is not a quiche fan and was not too thrilled when I decided to make this. I thought it sounded fabulous! It was delicious and my husband ended up enjoying it more than I did! Very rich and filling, I will definitely make it again.

Deeeelicous....I must have done something different than the other reviewers because I just had enough spinach filling for one crust.  I used about half of the egg mixture.  Next time I will double the spinach, onion, garlic, and cheeses to fill a second crust.

Really yummy! I made it for father's day brunch and hubby ate it up...i think he ate atleast half of the whole dish! When I do it again, I'll reduce the amount of spinach, I really like spinach but it was a bit overpowering. Loved the feta..oh baby! I didn't use all the egg mixture because it was so full, maybe by reducing the spinach I will be able to use all the eggs. Thanks for the recipe! Served with fresh fruit and a smoothie.

This was my first time making a quiche and my boyfriend, who says him mom makes the best quiches, absolutely loved it.  I browned some sausage and substitued that for the mushrooms.  I only used a half of a small onion.  Next time I will cut down the butter to only a 1/4 cup.  I will certainly be keeping this in my receipe box.

I made this for Mother's Day brunch, and everyone LOVED it--even my husband who hates onions. The garlic and herb feta gives it a ton of flavor. It is easy to make but tastes like it has to be difficult.

I'm not always fond of quiche but I made this last night and it is one of the best quiches I've ever had.  I used fresh mushrooms and sauteed them with the onion and also added some crumbled bacon with the spinach and cheeses.  It was yummy!

The five stars here come from my husband who loves quiche.  His mother always made quiche for the family when he was younger, but it isn't something I had ever made for my family, until I found this recipe here on this site.  He loved this, and it worked out for me, despite being my first attempt.  Will be making this again.  Thanks Bailey!

Wow, my first time making a quiche, and it turned out "perfect" according to my boyfriend! What a good recipe. I halved all the ingredients to make a 9.5" regular quiche. I bought some refrigerated pie dough and first toasted it for 5 minutes in a glass pie pan. Left out the mushrooms(the bf doesn't eat them), so I added an extra ounce of feta. Also, I only used 1.5 tablespoons of butter. I mixed the shredded cheese in with everything else and just baked for 50 minutes. Next time, I'll experiment with bacon and etc. Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe actually made 2 quiches!  Maybe the pie crust was not "deep dish" enough, but frankly it didn't matter because I took the extra one into work and everyone loved it. It was pretty easy to make!

This is the first Quiche I've ever made and it turned out delicious!!!  My husband loved it and he is not a big fan of eggs.  Will definitely make this again, although I plan on using half the butter.

Very tasty. I cut back to 3 T. butter and should have reduced even more because it was insanely rich. Used 4 oz plain feta, fresh mushrooms and substituted mozzarella for cheddar. Baked in homemade whole wheat pie crust.

I changed this recipe quite a bit, but I'm going to give the submitter credit as she did encourage us to do so.  I made my own pie crust using half white and half wholewheat flour, and I used fresh mushrooms.  I also used only three eggs, half a cup milk, and left out the extra butter and the cheddar cheese (because I didn't have any).  I had been hesitant to try my hand at quiche up until now but it was a great success.  My boyfriend said that it was the best quiche he'd ever tasted, and we live in France so we've tasted quite a few.

My husband and I made this together and we both love garlic; however, the garlic was too overpowering.  Also, way too much butter!  I should have followed others advise to cut back.  I made it again the next day with fresh spinach, mushrooms, 2 tbl of butter and no garlic and it was wonderful.  The recipe was a good base and I will continue to use it.

What a great quiche!  I couldn't find herb and garlic feta so I just used regular feta.  I was also making Quiche Lorraine II at the same time and I had left over eggs from that one so I used them in here instead of the eggs and milk called for.  Even my 4 yo loved this quiche and now goes around telling everyong he likes spinach!

I love spinach so this recipe was a big hit. My 18 month old son absolutely loved it too! I used fresh baby spinach, only 3 eggs, less milk and butter. Make sure to drain the spinach, it can be very watery.

I made this quiche for my future daughter-in-laws bridal shower.. along with a few others.  This was wonderful......  I did use fresh spinach and mushrooms...... Everyone loved it and I was sad when all the left overs were gone....  Hmmm time to make another.  By using the same ounces fresh, as called out for frozen spinach and canned mushrooms.......I round it actually made 2 pies...  Good Thing!  It was the favorite!

This quiche was a hit with my playgroup and my husband! The feta cheese gave the quiche a yummy twist. Per other suggestions, I only used 1/4 cup butter and reduced the cheddar cheese to 1 cup. I also prefer the basil and tomato feta cheese over the garlic and herb. I will make this again and again. Delicious!

Fantastic!  I will make again and again.  I added bacon and really liked it.  I agree with the other reviewers that it makes too much filling.  I'd either split into 2 pies next time or use only 3/4 the spinach.  I also only used half the cheese.  Great recipe!

I reduced the butter by half and reduced the cheddar cheese to one cup.  This is definitely a recipe I will repeat, and possibly tweak, such as replacing the spinach with broccoli.

This was a great experience for a first time quiche. I did away with the mushrooms, and held out some of the feta in order to add it once the mixture was spread on the crust, before added the egg and milk mixture. I used a small amount of cheddar only to sprinkle on the top.

A delicious and cheesy quiche.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and added chopped artichoke hearts and omitted the mushrooms.  It was delicious, and the salt from the feta worked perfectly -- no need for additional salt.  I also used less than half the butter with no problem.

This was a very good quiche. I reduced the amount of butter to 1 T. and halved everything else (except the feta).  I used tomato and basi feta.  My husband devoured it - he had the rest of it for dinner that night!

I agree that this quiche is forgiving. I just used a random combination of cheeses that I happened to have in the fridge -- along with the spinach -- and it was great.  I used half the butter, as recommended by another reviewer. I used a Jiffy crust and so overall felt that the process was quick and easy. I had leftovers, and it still tasted great for brunch the next day!

I've never made quiche before, so was looking for a guideline. This was great! I used a lot less butter, as others have commented on, and omitted the mushrooms. I added some paper-thin sliced julienned ham. Next time I will use less cheese - it was a little much for my husband's taste. Also, I missed the "deep dish" note on the pie and used a regular pie shell - only need half the eggs and milk. All in all - a keeper.

This was really good - the whole family liked it.  However,  I would cut the butter in half - was greasy.

I am not a big fan of Feta cheese, but my wife is.....  she couldn't help herself on this and just loved it.  One of the best things she has ever eaten!  We use farm fresh eggs and goats milke in our cooking so it was very rich and tasty.

Fantastic!  I substituted goat cheese for feta and added a few tablespoons of parmesean.  I decreased the butter to 2 tablespoons and it was great.

This is a wonderful quiche recipe!  I did use less butter after reading the other reviews, and it worked out just fine.  Very easy and delicious.  My husband enjoyed it and even my 2 year old couldn't get enough of it much to my surprise!!

I,too, made two quiches.  It was wonderful.  My oven is a little hotter and so I baked it about 10 minutes the first time and then about 25-30 the next.  Thank you so much.  Everyone loved it and it came out perfectly.

REALLY good quiche.  (So high in fat though. *argh*)  I used two 9" deep dish pie shells, 1/4 cup butter instead of 1/2, and 6 eggs.  I also mixed the cheese into the spinache mixture rather than putting it on top.  (Oh, and I used fresh mushrooms, not canned.  Can't stand canned mushrooms.)

This recipe is rollin'. I got a lot of compliments on this dish. It seems like an aweful lot of butter in this recipe. I might try half as much butter next time and maybe add small chunks of ham to it also.

Very very good, and I don't even like feta.  Was even better the next day.  With this recipe I was able to make one deep dish pie and a regular pie.  If you want to make just one pie, definitely halve it.

Tasted really good. Did have lots of egg mixture left, so use this recipe to make 2 pies instead of one.  Gotta figure a way to make it less fat, for a more healthy meal. But boy, its good!

This was really good.  I've never had Feta cheese before so I only used half the amount and used two deep dish crusts.  My husband said this recipe was a keeper!
