Loved it!!! My husband and 22 month old loved this recipe.  I wanted to use up the pumpkin flowers I had in our garden, but I did not want to fry them--like so many other recipes call for.  I found this recipe, and followed it exactly...although I did put in more pumpkin blossoms.  We ate it up.  The next day we put the leftovers over white rice as a sauce, and it was delicious.  Thanks....it was a lot of work, but I will make this again.

I used butternut squash instead of zuchinni,forgot to add the corn,used a pasilla instead of a pablano and evaporated milk for the heavy cream.Been wanting to try this since "A walk in the clouds".Very tasty !
