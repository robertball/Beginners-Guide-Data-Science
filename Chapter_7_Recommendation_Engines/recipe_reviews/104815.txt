The addition of onion is different and pretty good.  I also added some chopped ham and cheddar cheese.

The key to fluffy eggs is to remember NOT to overbeat them.  Beat them until they are JUST scrambled.  If you beat them too much they will turn out flat.  Also, I prefer my eggs without the milk or a very small amount added.

Delicious. I didn't have much time in the kitchen this morning or else I would have topped it with some sliced tomato and grated cheese. I will definitely be experimenting with our favorite omelet combinations. Thanks, Whitney!

Loved the lessons over scrambled eggs i learned from making this recipe:) Never knew about the whisking to get fluffy eggs or about not cooking them until they're cooked when still in the pan. Very good recipe. Thanks Whitney:)

This was ok, better than plain but I wouldn't call it perfect-- depth of flavor wasn't what I expected.

I left out the onion because I don't care for them. All in all this was just okay. I think I would prefer to add the pepper at the end. Also I think I like my eggs better without milk.

Instead of milk, I added a little water, salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder. And I don't 'stir constantly' - I let them cook a little, stir a little, cook a little, stir a little until they are done. I think stirring too much makes them mushy!

Onions and eggs just don't go together. I always add a dollop of sour cream to my scrambled eggs before I whisk them, that will really make them fluffy. All in all this recipe was just not my taste.

I assumed the minced onion was meant to be fresh and not dried. I sauteed the onion and then added the egg mixture to the pan. This was O.K.

These were very good, and how I was taught to make eggs. Since I have started using Scrambled Eggs Done Right on this site I have come to prefer them over this way. This is a classic recipe though! Thanks.

My dad was released from the hospital and didn't have much of an appetite. He wanted scrambled eggs. I don't like eggs, so I looked for a recipe on how to make them. My dad really liked these. Thanks for the recipe.

this sounds good...but I do mine in the micro wave and they are so fluffy...I even add cheese and pepper and salt and diced onion to them...so fast and so easy....If I do them on the stove top, I do them just like this recipe by Whitney though (in a cast iron skillet)

I love these eggs, I always beat them to long and they were flat. I added sharp cheddar cheese and chopped jalapeños.  GREAT.  II don't like any added fat or cream, just the few ingredients I mentioned. Sometimes I like chopped veggies and no cheese.

I used 8 - 10 eggs for the recipe and added chopped red (sweet) onion for taste. I also used deli ham which I shredded by hand. I then topped it off with shredded cheddar cheese. It was delicious! I served it with shredded hash browns & glazed cinnamon buns for a tasty Christmas Day Brunch.

This recipe doesn't seem extraordinary to me however is not bad. I added a bit of green pepper to add a bit of color. Now, I  notice many people mention their eggs come out dry. Here are some techniques for obtaining fluffy scrambled eggs. First, keep in mind that fluffiness in eggs depend on the addition of either water or milk. Note: Milk works better in scrambled eggs and water works better in omelets. Second, once you crack the eggs open, beat them slightly. Third, once you pour the eggs in the pan, let it set for 30 seconds. Adjust your heat to medium low to cook them slowly and prevent quick browning. Also use more than a tsp of butter. This will help you to scramble them more easily without having to over beat the eggs. I usually use 1 tbsp. to make scrambled eggs.  Fourth, after the 30 seconds, then scramble them with a fork, but not beat them too much or for too long. This is crucial to prevent dry eggs in the end result.

OMG people.......this is a BASIC scrambled egg recipe!  It's been done this way since eggs were discovered I think!  Having said that....I use WATER, not milk. My grandmother & mother always said 'milk makes the eggs tough!'.  As for the rest....you can add in anything you like....bacon bits, chopped mushrooms, any cheese, chopped tomato, pepper, etc.etc. & adjust the spices to suit your family's preferences. It's all to personal taste once the EGGS are scrambled!  Such a kaffuffle over simple scrambled eggs! lol.  PS: if you don't 'stir' them in the pan, spread the add-ins over them, cook until almost done, then flip one half over the other & cook a bit longer.......you will have an OMELET !  Easy-peasy!

I used less minced onion than what the recipe called for, and it was still too much. If you make these, just be careful with the amount of onion you add.

First time making scrambled eggs and used this recipe. Didn't have any onion but they still turned out great! Next time I think I'll use a little less black pepper but it was still really good. A keeper recipe for sure!

It was okay, wasn't anything special about it. I changed the milk to half & half.

I feel silly rating a scrambled egg recipe. but I am!  I realized my eggs are never consistent, so a recipe that tells me how much milk to use for 6 eggs? I'll take it! It works.  Following this recipe gives me great scrambled eggs on a regular basis! thanks!

I made them but used only 1/4 cup minced onion.  1/2 cup is way too much!  Plus, I added about 1 cup shredded cheese.  Any kind you prefer.  I used a Mexican blend.

Good receipe. Living in the Great Smokey Mountains,  we have access to "Ramps" each spring.  The use of this minced wild onion instead of regular onions takes this dish to another level. Thanks for sharing.

these had to much milk in them...agree with some of the other reviewers regarding adding liquid to eggs.
