These are great especially when you want something more than 'just a burger'- nice twist, even without the shrooms.  You'll want to smush the blue cheese into the meat pretty well, because it inevitably melts and oozes out in the first few bites...but is still there for the dipping.

I actually combined this recipe with another from this site(Jalapeno-Garlic-Onion Cheeseburgers) Tried that one and was good but rather bland. So took all of the spices from this recipe but also added 1 1/2 fresh jalapenos,with the seeds left in to make it hotter, 3 cloves of garlic, and 1 1/2 small onion (finely diced). Instead of putting blue cheese in the middle, I just cooked them on my George Foreman grill, and put pepperjack cheese on top, and popped them into the microwave to melt the cheese. Served on fresh bakery buns with bbq sauce, NO mushrooms, with some homemade coleslaw on the side. Very good if you like zip in your food!!

These were very good. I skipped the mushrooms and cooked my burgers in a frying pan, but other than that followed the recipe pretty closely. I think there was a little more cumin flavor than I enjoy here, so I'll cut that back next time. The burgers are VERY VERY thick once you've finished making them up, and take forever to cook.  I'm a bit too impatient--I will probably just put my bleu cheese on the side next time and just make the flavorful burgers! Thanks for the recipe :)

I added jalape√±o pieces and used blue cheese dressing. I used some ground venison once and they were even better! Everybody raved about how juicy they were, even people who didn't like blue cheese.

These things are delicious! I didn't use mushrooms or blue cheese because I didn't have any, but just as a regular cheese burger, they were outstanding. They're very easy to make and don't crumble. They are packed with flavor and are so moist they feel like they melt in your mouth.

OK.  Omitted mushrooms, hubs doesn't like them, BBQ sauce cause we're on a low carb diet, as well as the bun.  I added Worcestershire sauce cause I like the flavor it adds to burgers.  My husband was not impressed.  I didn't think they were too bad, probably will not repeat.
