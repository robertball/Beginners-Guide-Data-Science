I was curious about the disparity of reviews so figured I'd give it a try. I couldn't get this recipe to work. Followed the recipe exactly timed the boiling stirred often used a stand mixer to beat--ended up with a hardened candy-like mess. Had to soak the saucepan and mixing bowl for hours to remove the hardened sugar. Maybe you need to boil it for less time just until it reaches a certain stage. If it turned out well for you please give details!

Made this for a cake to be used in a church bake sale. It does not work. We tried making it over and over and still it did not work!! If you are wanting to make this I highly suggest you find another recipe!!!

Wonderful! I used it as fronsting for the "Apple cake and butter sauce"- it turned out great. After I had put it in the mixer it was a little thick so I added an additional 1/4 cup of milk and it was perfect. Thanks for the great recipe!

I'll bet you a million dollars the writer of this recipe meant "Boil for 2 minutes". Give that a shot before you get all hot and bothered:)

I did the same thing as the reviewer below and ended up with the same hardened candy-like mess in my mixing bowl that I had to soak for hours to remove. (Perhaps you're supposed to use a hand-held and beat it in the pan in which it was boiled??) But I made a second batch and only boiled it for 3 or 4 minutes (and didn't beat it) and it turned out fine - poured it directly from the pan onto the cake and didn't have a problem. It is delicious so I had to give it three stars:-)
