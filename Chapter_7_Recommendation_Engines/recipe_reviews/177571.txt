My family loved this recipe. I made a few changes myself: I shredded the chicken instead of cubing it, I used real cheese instead of cheese soup, and I baked it in the oven (about 350Â° for 15 mins.) instead of nuking it. It's a bit more time consuming than the original recipe, but my family said it was definitely worth it. Good luck!

Fast, easy, & delicious.  My kids asked if I would make it again tomorrow.  I made a few slight variations to the recipe - I used shredded cheese instead of the cheddar cheese soup (since I didn't have any in my cupboard), I used bean & corn salsa instead of the Thick & Chunky, and baked it at 350 for 15 min instead of microwaving (gave me time to clean up the kitchen).  I also sprinkled a little garlic & herb seasoning on the chicken while cooking it.  I ended up getting more than 8 enchiladas...which worked well for us!  You could easily use any leftover chicken/rotisserie chicken to make this too.

yummy!!!! I used cream of onion instead of cream of chicken because that's what I had. Even the kids had seconds (and thirds). I added a little mexican blend cheese on top and it was great.

Will not be making again. Maybe if we use real cheese and enchilada sauce on top it may be better.

my husband LOVES chicken enchiladas and i was trying to find a quick & easy recipe. i live overseas, so my microwave is for sure NOT big enough to cook anything in so i changed it up.  i shredded the chicken instead of cutting it in cubes, i used shredded cheese instead of cheese sauce. once they were rolled in the pan i poured a can of enchilada sauce over top and then sprinkled the cheese. i cooked them at 350 degrees for 15 minutes and they turned out amazing.  i will be remaking this :)

I made exactly as directed but instead of more soup on top, i put a can of enchilada sauce with a little more shredded cheese.  When I served it, I put shredded lettuce, sour cream, and chopped black olives.

This was an amazing recipe that i used and modifided accordong to suggestions and what i thought would taste good. We baked at 350 for about 13 minutes and i made a mixture with monteray jack and cheddar cheese with a few heaping tablespoons and a little bit of milk to help it spread. i also used more of the cheeses in the mixture and covered the sour cream/ cheese with it instead of the cheese soup. turned out wonderful.

It was easy and cheap to make, also my boyfriend loved it so that alone made me happy. The left over chicken mixture makes an amazing dip for tortilla chips which makes a great mid-day snack. The dish it self is Americanism Mexican food so if you're looking for an authentic taste I would try a different recipe.

Wished I had all the ingredients but ended up still having a good dish, boiled chicken breasts with water seasoned with salt and pepper and chicken soup powder, then chopped into small cubes and left in fridge till later. Mixed the soups and a can of diced tomatoes ( had no salsa) had some left over corn and rice from dinner the night before and that went in too. Used 4 large costco tortillas rolled up and put the extra sauce on top with shredded cheese. I baked at 350 for 20 minutes then turned the broiler on for 2 minutes to brown it up. My family loved it and hubby took leftovers to work. I will try next time with the salsa, probably would make it even better.

These were good.  Not like traditional enchiladas because you use flour tortillas, but otherwise the taste was authentic.

Made this exactly as written and it made for a quick and tasty meal. I recommend shredding the chicken as well. Nuking it worked fine for us.  Enjoy!
