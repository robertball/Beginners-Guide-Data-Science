Best mayo recipe so far. Easy and tasty. I used it in Suddenly Salad for my hubby. He liked if too. Will use it from now on. This is way better than store-bought stuff.

One of my few failures. Everything was at room temperature... but this never would emulsify   I tried twice.. failed both times. Maybe the oil I used was a problem.. I dont know. I've made mayo before and havent had this happen. Maybe someone else will have better luck than I did
