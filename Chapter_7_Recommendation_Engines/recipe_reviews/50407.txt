I made this in my crock pot instead of on the grill - same ingredients for the glaze, just pour it over the meat, then occasionally spooned over the meat as it cooks. Fantastic!

This was very good. I did add some rosemary but all in all followed the directions. I'm looking forward to trying it on other meats.

Wonderful flavor.  I made this in the oven instead.  It was a success with my husband.  I will make this again and I have shared it with my Mom.

HUGE hit! I made this for Mother's Day and the platter was literally wiped clean. I prefer lamb on the rare side but for those that didn't I just zapped their serving in the microwave and everybody was happy. We will definitly have this again.  I think I will try the glaze on lamb chops too.

Were I am lamb is so expensive that this recipe does not rate a repeat.  It was okay if you have lamb and are trying to find ways of cooking it.  I had a "roast" that I cut in half to cook.  Took well over the alloted time.  Ended up putting this in the microwave so we could finally eat.

This recipe was just okay. Leg of lamb is expensive in my part of the world so when I cook it, I want a surefire showstopper type of recipe.  This wasn't it.

I guess I've got to be different with my review, but I thought this was simply an OK recipe. Because of the weather, I didn't grill it out, but I'm not sure I would have anyway...the glaze simply wasn't robust enough to hold up to a charcoal fire. I will make this again, but I'll use the glaze for an overnight marinade and see if that gives me a bit more of a lime flavor. I was actually looking for  something I could serve with more Caribbean-influenced foods since I do a lot of lamb that leans to the Mediterranean side of the world and needed something different. I did cook it to medium-rare (30 minutes/pound) and it was very tender.

Jenna, a crock pot is for cheap cuts that need to be slow cooked.

Instead of making this on the grill, I broiled it in the oven on a low broiler setting.
  Although it did smell good, I didn't care for the thyme in the baste. Next time I will reduce the amount of thyme or use rosemary instead.

I have never cooked lamb before and took the plunge for our Greek themed Christmas feast this year.  This recipe was perfect and we cooked it on our spit.  I marinated the lamb in the limeade and other ingredients for 24 hours before placing on the spit then basted with a fresh batch of limeade mixture.  We will be having lamb more often now

I don't have a grill so I cooked this in the oven, basted it frequently and reduced the remaining limeade mixture to serve as a sauce over the lamb. It was very tender and flavorful, and I did really like the lime flavor, but the limeade was too sugary for me and my husband. I think next time I make this I will use lime juice and a little bit of honey instead of the limeade, but I will definitely be making it again!
