Good recipe with a couple of minor changes. First of all, please don't use bouillon and water. There are wonderful packaged chicken stocks and broths in the grocery store. Secondly, once you've made your roux, start slowly adding your stock. You won't get any lumps this way. Adding the other ingredients first makes no sense to me. Then add the rest of the ingredients. Definitely needed a lot more seasonings. Also added some fresh chopped parsley as a garnish. This was a great place to start Rebecca and a good way to use up some leftover chicken. Soup was hearty and very tasty. Thanks!

I was in the mood for something chickeny, broccolliy, cheesy, and spicy as well - so I made a few changes. First, I sauteed a whole large yellow onion with three cloves of garlic - then added the roux ingredients and cooked it until bubbly and just starting to turn brown. I, then, added 8 cups of chicken broth (slowly at first), four cups of water and the rest of the called-for ingredients (except for the salt) - plus some baby carrots for sweetness, and some pre-cooked bacon for smokiness. Then, I added a half teaspoon of cayenne, a few pinches of nutmeg and about 15 shakes of mexican hot sauce. At the 45 minute mark, I removed about a litre of the soup (for use later) - then added the creme and cheddar, as well as about 1/2 cup parmesan. Wonderful!!!

Thanks for the recipe!  I just made it for a Teachers' Luncheon at school, and everyone raved about it and asked for the recipe.  The addition of the chicken was such a nice change, and all agreed that it was a meal all by itself.  I did make a few changes, just to make it easier on myself.  I picked up an already roasted chicken from the grocery store and just cut up the breast into bite-sized pieces, and I used 2 bags of frozen broccoli florets, instead of the fresh.  Obviously, I didn't need to simmer the soup nearly as long.  I also added some sauteed onion and garlic, a bit of cayenne pepper, and about 8 oz. of velveeta cheese.  It turned out beautifully!

Thanks again for the recipe.  It's going in the "keeper" pile for certain!

My husband almost had tears in his eyes when he took his first bite.  He absolutely loved this recipe.  I didn't follow the recipe all the way either.  Instead of adding the flour mixture last, I added all the rest of the ingredients into the flour mixture.  I also didn't let the soup simmer for 45 minutes.  But it was still amazing.  I made the Italian Bread Bowls from this website and this meal was a complete success.  If I could, I would give this recipe 10 stars.

This turned out very nice for me. I boiled the chicken first and shredded it first instead of cutting it in chunks, and also used 4 cans of chicken broth instead of the bullion.
When it was time to add the thickening agent, I actually poured out some of the broth into the flour and butter and wisked that together separatly so there were no lumps. Then I added garlic salt and an extra cup of cheese. 
Excellent!!

This soup was a SHOW STOPPER!  Everyone loved it, and the flavor was well WORTH the little extra time it took to make.  I've made it three times, and I add extra chicken, and I put steamed broccoli into the bowls before I serve up the soup. A good loaf of sour dough bread is ALL you need to complete this outstanding meal.

My family never eats soup and they hate broccoli.  I took a chance and made it thinking that if they didn't like it, I would have lunch for a week.  They absolutely loved this soup and even wanted more.  Thank You!

This was so good!  Everyone enjoyed it and the leftovers went fast.  It was even better the second time around.  The butter/flour paste comes out very thick.  I thinned it with a little of the soup broth before adding to avoid clumping.

I added two equal halves of green and red peppers, extra brocolli, and used whole baked chicken and it was great.  I put the cooked chicken in the pot with water for 15 minutes, removed to let cool for 1/2 hour.  Added ingredients to remaining broth and simmered for an hour.  Ummm Soupeee...  Cool broth in fridge to skim fat.

Use chicken broth instead of water and bouillon. Save 4 cups of the broth to make cheese sauce... melt the butter, mix in the flour, whisk in the 4 cups of broth and then whisk in the cheese till melted.

This was a good base for me - I wanted to cut the calories so I cut the butter to a Tbls. - no cream - & no cheese. I sauteed' a couple onions and garlic - used garlic salt - carrots - and brown rice. I just wanted to make it healthy and less fattening. I'm sure its great just as the recipe states and my way is another whole recipe - oh well - at least I didn't mess up the rating!! I only made it for a healthy choice for me to take to work.

Sauteed sweet onion and several cloves of garlic before adding broth. I used Progresso chicken broth instead of boullion.   I also added broccoli stalks that were pulverized in the food processor along with the florets.  Used 1/2 mild and 1/2 sharp cheddar.  Wow!

Good recipe. I did make a rue instead on the butter mixture in the beginning.  The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 is because although it is good, it is not going to be one of my "go-to" recipes.

This was a delicious and easy recipe! I about half an onion in with the butter, then added flour to make the roux. Then I added the other ingredients. At the end, I added 4 cups of sharp cheddar and some Cavendar's seasoning. So tasty and PERFECT on a snowy night :)

This was a great family dinner.  It was filling and everyone loved it.  I used a roasted chicken and added another 2 chicken breasts.  I also substituted chicken broth for the cubes.  I will make this again in the future.

Skip the butter, flour, start with water add 6 chopped potatoes, 1 chopped onion, 2 T minced garlic, and 3 chicken breast.  Go ahead and throw them in when their frozen, you can take them out and cube when cooked. Buy 1 lb frozen broccoli florets. (they don't spoil) Cut a whole in the top of the bag of broccoli and fill with hot water let sit in a bowl, drain after they have thawed. Taste and see how close they are to fully cooked. Add after potatoes and chicken are cooked add broccoli and cook until tender (about 3 min.) Turn off heat. Cube a pound of velveeta and stir in. (sometimes I add 3/4 of a 2 pound loaf of cheese) Soup is ready when cheese is melted.

Great, big pot of soup!  Followed a suggestion to leave the roux in the pot, then added the liquid about two cups at a time and stirred it well with each addition.  I had no lumps. I cooked my roux with a medium-size yellow onion and two cloves of garlic. After the roux was thinned with the liquid, I added the rest of the ingredients, plus a container of fresh mushrooms.  This added to the simmer time, but I wasn't in a hurry.  I can't wait to have leftovers tomorrow! Next time I'll use closer to 8 cups of broth/stock.

This soup was DELICIOUS! I did make a few changes, as other reviewers recommended: I used 2 bags of frozen broccoli cuts for convenience, and used 8 ounces of Velveeta cheese in addition to about 1 cup of shredded mild cheddar cheese (We're BIG cheese fans). Also, I added 4 sauteed garlic cloves and 1 large sauteed yellow onion for added flavor. This is a LOT of soup for two people, but it's SO GOOD that we're both happy eating it all week! Especially delicious with warm sourdough rolls. This is my idea of a perfect soup recipe :)

Made this for dinner tonight because husband wanted broccoli cheese soup and we also had a bunch of chicken to use up. Although we both liked the flavor, we thought it was missing that super cheesy kick that broccoli cheese soup usually has..I even used 4 cups of sharp cheddar. Maybe the chicken is what gave the soup a different flavor. All in all..decent recipe. Thanks for sharing!

By far my husband's favorite soup that I have ever made! I serve it with homemade cheesy beer bread and he goes crazy. A nice fall soup, even though I am reviewing it in the summer. Next time, I might try adding cauliflower and a few more spices, such as celery salt instead of regular. I did substitute white pepper for black when making this soup initially.

Made this soup a few days ago and it turned out amazingly good!  I did however add the broth to the flour mixture like Linda reviewed and it really helped keep it from forming lumps. I also used salted butter, might be a newb mistake on my part but it left it a tiny bit too salty for my taste and I will use unsalted next time.  I stuck to the ingredients and directions this time, but will add muchrooms and some onion next time I make this. This is a delicious soup that was real easy to make and everyone slurped it up!

I enjoyed this soup. Like many other reviewers, I used chicken broth instead of boullion and water and added it directly to the roux. I used canned chicken because I was feeling lazy :).  The soup reheated really well and I think it actually tasted better then. I think next time I might try Velveeta instead of shredded cheese just to make it taste even more cheesy. Overall very good!

We really loved this soup!  I used low fat low sodium chicken broth, fat free half and half, and 2% velveeta. I also added the liquid to the roux and then the chicken and broccoli.  I also added onion powder and garlic powder.  I think I will add fresh nxt time.  Awesome recipe!!  Thank you!

This is good soup. I would suggest waiting till the soup is put together before adding salt. My chicken must have been a little salty, so adding salt wasn't a good idea.  I only had frozen broccoli and sharp cheddar cheese. the flavor was good and comforting during these really cold days of winter.

What a delicious soup!  Thanks Rebecca!  I for one LOVE cheese, so I added an extra cup of cheese.  I also used chicken broth instead of 11 coups of water and chicken boullion (which someone else recommended).  I think next time, I may use two cans of campbells broccoli cheddar soup or just the cheddar soup.  Like I said, it's delicious, but I want MORE CHEESE!  :)

The perfect broccoli cheese soup recipe!! It's great with or without chicken. The only change I did was to add extra cheese. It was wonderful and warmed up well several days later.

We really liked this recipe. One thing that I did differently was to blend the broccoli up in the blender along with some of the water to reduce the cooking time a little.  This made it creamy and delicious.

I LOVED this recipe. My roommates were raving about it too, but I did make a few alterations.  I added bite size chicken to the melted butter, simmered it with chopped onions, minced garlic, and 1 tsp of cayenne pepper (love the kick)  then i added chicken stock, only 6 cups though. I love my soup thicker, so i lessened it dramatically.   Stirred in a cup of flour, then the rest of the ingredients and simmered it all together for a good 15 minutes.  added 8 oz of velveeta, and 1 cup of milk. the cheese melted within 5 minutes, then it was ready to serve.  with the tweaks, it was delicious. definitely a keeper!

We really love this soup! I've made it several times this winter. I always mince 1 or 2 cloves of garlic and add them to the butter before making the roux, then I add chicken broth to the roux slowly. I always make this with skim milk and a few tablespoons of either plain yogurt or sour cream. Yum, perfect every time. Thanks so much for this great recipe! :)

I changed this receipe a bit to adapt to our needs but it was delicious.  I eliminated the chicken, used 1/2 broccoli and 1/2 cauliflower, used 2 % milk velveeta cheese, used chicken broth instead of the water and chicken cubes, and used milk instead of cream.  I would make again!

Wow, this was amazing. I made it a little less work by using rotisserie turkey breast. This was very simple and very very good. It also reheated very nicely.

Very tasty and hearty soup.  I made a substitution with the chicken bullion and added chicken stock instead.  It was a great way to use up left over rottiserie chicken.  Will make again!

Delicious.  If you cut the chicken small enough it will completely dissolve into the rest or the soup and make a creamy dish you don't have to chew.  Great for people who recently had oral surgery or braces...

I really liked this recipe. I also added potato to mine. I read others reviews & did the following: Sauteed a diced onion & two cloves of garlic in only 2 tblspons of butter (to keep it healthy), then added the chunks of chicken to brown with the onions & garlic while adding spices (black pepper, salt, white pepper, pinch of nutmeg, dried parsley flakes, Tony's, and one cube of chicken bouillon) once the chicken was a little browned, I added  cans of chicken & veg. broth. Let that simmer for a bit until the chicken is tender. I mixed 1 cup of whole milk (cream is too fattening) with flour and added this mixture to the pot. When soup thickened a bit, I added a bag of frozen broccoli & cubes of boiled potato that were boiled while chicken was boiling. Then I added medium sharp cheddar cheese at the end, I only had about 1 cup of cheese but the soup was still amazing!

I changed this recipe some, partly because I only had one head of broccoli, but mostly to make it WAY lower in fat!  I used 1/4 c. butter, 3/4 c. flour, 8 c. water, left out the bouillon, used 2 lb. beef steak instead of chicken (all I had at the time), 1 head of broccoli, 4 tsp. salt, 1/8 tsp. black pepper, 1 c. non-fat milk, and 2 c. of 2% low-fat sharp Cheddar cheese.  I cooked as directed, EXCEPT I mixed the flour with the milk and poured it slowly into the pot at the end.  Then I added the butter.  We LOVED it, and I could serve it without feeling guilty!

Three of us LOVED it.  One of us HATED it.  The hater complained it was too creamy, too cheesy and would have been better with more veggies and only broth and meat otherwise.  The lovers said that would ruin what they liked about it.  To each her/his own, I guess.

Very good soup! For some reason, the soup didn't thicken to my liking but can be modified with additional broccoli, chicken and perhaps even flour in the future. I used two bags frozen broccoli instead of fresh but didn't add it until the chicken was cooked through (apprx the last 10 min before adding the flour mix and cream)and also used processed cheese oppossed to shredded chedder, which made it rich and creamy.  Would make again! Thanks Rebecca!

Just finished it.  Was very good, my 2yr daughter loved it.  It is a very good base to experiment with.  Think I will add a jalepeno and substitute a couple cans of beer for some of the water next time I make it.  Wife said "it's a keeper"

Very good.  I would have given this 5 stars but I think the bouillon gives the soup a slightly bitter aftertaste.  I will substitute with chicken broth the next time. My 10 yr. old, who hates soup, loved it so I will definitely make again.

We absolutely LOVE this soup.  I did make a couple of changes.  I used chicken stock (in place of water & bouillon) from a hen I cooked the day before.  I also used white and dark meat as suggested by another reviewer.  We also prefer more of a chowder vs soup, so I made the roux as instructed then took some of the stock and added another cup of flour to make more.  We will definitely be adding this to our winter menu.  Super YUMMY!!!  Thank you Rebecca!

I used chicken stock (dont care for boullion cubes).
I used rotissaire chicken that was left over with 1 cup extra xharp cheddar and 2 cups velvetta. I dont really think these substitutions changed the integrity of the recipe, that is why I am reviewing. I also pureed the mixture with a handheld, then added the cheese and chicken in. Very good, evven my 6 yr old nephew liked it!

I wish I had used 2-3 cups LESS water because it didn't thicken as much as I would've liked.  That's really the only negative thing I can say.  I made my own chicken stock and shredded the resulting chicken for the soup.  I then sauteed some garlic with the chicken and tossed in everything else.  To cut back a little on fat, I only used 1/4 cup butter for the roux.

I made this soup last night. My family couldn't stop raving about how good it tasted. I did do some changes after reading some of the reviews. I made the thickening mixture and added it to the pot at the end. I used creamer rather than the light cream. In addition to the cheddar cheese, I added 4-5 ounces of velveta cheese. Also, I added the garlic powder, chopped onions and cut back the butter to about half. Instead of using fresh broccoli, I only had frozen (thawed). Still turned out great.I added the broccoli for the last 5 minutes to prevent it from over cooking.  Between bites, I asked my family if I should perhaps try adding potato chunks next time.......My husband told me not to mess with how I made it. He is quite a cook himself, so that was a compliment! The broth was a bit thin at first,and I had hoped there would be some left over to see if it would get thicker the next day.....but no such luck! I would highly recommend this one! One note.......I think it might be good served in a bread bowl!

FANTASTIC! A small bit of advice though: Wait and make the butter & flour mixture last. Sure you'll dirty up a small pot, but after using a big pot for the soup, is a dirty small pot going to really make a difference? So yeah, I think it's far better and less hassle to just wait and make the butter-flour mixture last and then add into the soup. My husband isn't a soup person at all and he said he really loved this recipe. The chicken pieces were an excellent addition to this soup. The texture was perfect and the flavors were great. As others mentioned, I too, added garlic and sauteed onions into the mix; it was the perfect flavor booster. Paired with a couple slices of French bread and you have a great meal. This is definitely a great recipe for cold nights when you just need a warm pick-me-up. It's a keeper! Note: I set the servings for 5 and it made enough for 2-3 nights worth for our family of 3.

Great base recipe with a few changes!  1, definitely use chicken broth in lieu of water and cubes.  2, I sauteed the chicken with some thyme, garlic, a little butter and a medium diced onion before adding to the soup,  3, I shredded both the broccoli and the cooked chicken in the food processor (I like a smoother consistency), and 4, I replaced the cream with whole milk and thickened the soup with a flour / milk mixture instead of a roux before adding the cheese.  You'd never know that I cut the fat in less than half.  Yum!

This recipe rules! If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would. I made it for some out of town guests who are soup lovers. I didn't follow the directions exactly...I used frozen broccoli (I have no patience to cut fresh broccoli), and I used four cups of cheddar cheese instead of three. The chicken was a nice change, but you don't need it. I also had a problem with the "flour paste" rising to the top. I used a slotted spoon and just scooped it all out while it was cooking. I didn't use the boullion cubes, I added a can of chicken broth instead. I would like to try this with velveeta cheese and see what happens!

Oh...M'god...this was THE best soup recipe I have ever made. Everyone loved it. Pay no mind to that bad review below. To make sure the the roux dissolved completely, I just stirred it in small portions with a rubber spat til it all melted away. Oh, and I realized at the last minute that I didn't have any bullion so I had to omit it. I substituted some diced onion and garlic powder. ;)I served it with Grands biscuits, but next time think I'll get a package of the Rhodes dough balls and make them instead. A DIVINE recipe that I will definitely make again and recommend to all of my friends. THANKS REBECCA!

The soup was good but next time I will add less liquid and one can of cream of broccoli soup. I used chicken broth instead of cubes and added water to equal the 11 cups od water. I think the cream of broccoli soup and about 3 less cups of water will do it. Thank you for the recipe

I'm eating this right now and it's delicious! I cut about 100 calories per serving by using skim milk rather than cream and slices of 2% american cheese rather than shredded cheddar - about 1 slice per serving. I know that doesn't sound like a fair trade, but it really is very cheesy and delicious. I also added white pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, parsley, and a little shake of basil. Will definitely make again.

I am giving this 5 stars based on the original recipe.  My family loved it.  I have made it multiple times and have added a few things.  I have added carrots and cauliflower, my kids love this, so why not add extra veggies?!  I also have used broth instead of water and bouillon. The only other major change I make is I don't add the cheese to the pot.  I can never get it to melt smoothly, so each person adds the cheese to their bowl.  I find this gives me a better consistency. As I said, made it as written, loved it, that is what my rating is based on. Thanks for the recipe.

SKINNY VERSION: Still uh-mazing!! Instead of light cream I used hemp milk, instead of flour use gluten free pancake mix with only HALF the butter!! Replaced cheddar cheese with raw  gruyere cheese and used only a little…..maybe 1/2 cup….OMG!!!!! My husband FREAKED!!! Soooo good!! This is an amazing recipe to base what your tastes are. IT'S A HIT!!

I served this recipe in toasted bread bowls for a family dinner party and everyone loved it!  Based on other reviews, I also added a 4th bouillon cube, diced onions, fresh minced garlic and cubed potatoes.  I also substituted the cheese with sharp cheddar.  Thanks Rebecca for sharing this one!

OMGOODNESS!!!! This came out sooooo good! I sauted an onion and garlic before adding water, the chicken was seasoned and baked in the oven and then finely diced, to cut down cooking time. I roughly chopped the broccoli and then added 3 cups cheese grated, so I had roughly 5-6 cups of grated cheese. adding the broth to the flour mixture was the key to not having any lumps!! Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Excellent!  I did use chicken base instead of bouillon and it still turned out great.  My almost two year old even liked it and had a second bowl.  Next time I think I will add some carrots for more color.  This recipe is a keeper!

I *loved* this soup.  I made it vegetarian by omitting the chicken and using vegetable boullion cubes, and it was still absolutely the best soup ever.  I also just added the boiling water and broccoli to the roux at the beginning instead of letting the roux cool and adding it at the end, which is why that one guy got little cooked blobs in his soup.

I found this recipie when my neighbor was ill a while back and made it mostly according to the recipie.  I added about a 2 teaspoons of chopped garlic and did not use bullion cubes.  I put the chicken in raw, letting it cook as the soup simmered.  Use three crowns of broccoli for more veggie flavor.  Regarding the roux, when you are ready to add it, break it down a lot so it dissolves easily.  Since I made this soup it has been an absolute favorite amongst all my friends and family.

This soup was ok.  If I make it again, I am going to shred the chicken instead of chopping it.  I added a little hot pepper cheese to spice it up a little.

Great recipe with a little tweaking! As per reviews (and common cooking sense), I left my roux in the pot (including some diced onions I sauteed in the butter) and added the broth gradually to let it thicken up. I used leftover rotisserie chicken and frozen broccoli florets which made for a super easy meal. I used an immersion blender to break up the broccoli a little, though if you do this I would recommend putting in the chicken afterward! If we weren't having this in bread bowls I would have added a little rice too, but I didn't want to OD on the starches! :p

Delicious flavors!  
I sort of messed it up a bit, but it had potential!  Double broccoli and add maybe more chopped chicken.  1 c. milk instead of cream, & add 1 TBS worcestershire sauce!

This is good, needs more salt, and less water for creamier soup.. It's a bit watery for us, we like it creamier so next time, I'll use less water, and more sat and pepper. Good recipe.. I did it all in one pot, no sitting anything aside. Was a 1 hour meal..

Update: Today I made it with a few changes to use up what I had. I used 1/2 turkey 1/2 chicken. Added some onion, and bell peppers, added a big pinch of basil, and parsley, and used sweetened condensed milk instead of cream. I also used Velveeta (generic brand) instead of regular cheddar, and what was left in a bag of mozzarella cheese. The family likes it. You can do all kinds of things with this recipe. It;s a great base for anything you want to do with it.

Awesome! I recommend taking the chicken and broccoli out prior to whisking in the roux, then add them back in after (my broccoli disintegrated and my chicken shredded). Also, my girlfriend recommended adding whole kernel corn and egg noodles which made it even better!

Excellent recipe.  I used it as a guideline as I am a vegetarian, left out the chicken, subbed veg broth for the chicken bouillon cubes.  Was a thick and creamy dinner.  Next time I'll add some cooked rice and make sure I have some fresh baked bread on hand.

WOW!  Even my picky 4 year old eatter LOVED this soup!  I fed it to my 9 month old and he GOBBLED it down!  I put chicken stock in it and added celery because those were the stuff I had on hand.  Oh, and velveta cheese, too.  But it didn't hurt the integrity at all!  Wonderful!  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent. I used a milk and heavy cream combo since I had some on hand I wanted to use up. It had a little much cheese for me but my daughter loved it. I don't know why I followed the directions to add the roux to the broth, it came out clumpy, of course. Next time I will make it separate and slowly add the broth broccoli mixture.

Four stars for my version that came out a little salty (I added more bullion) but quite good.  I will stick with this recipe and tweak it a bit more to perfect it, but a great basic recipe.
I added diced ham (instead of chicken),and a small onion sauted in butter.  I also added three small potatoes that I cubed and cooked in the chicken broth before adding other ingredients.  
I served it with refridgerator dough breadsticks for a warm dinner on a cold and windy night.

Very easy soup to make and the whole family enjoyed it.  I didn't have cream so I used evaporated milk instead and the results were tasty.  I will definitely make it again.

Everything was well planned, however, How much flour is in a cup? A cup of flour can be 8 oz or 4 oz or 24oz depending on how you you look at it. This tells me that everyone had a different recipe. I usually toss any recipe I see that measures flour in cups instead of weights. I used a standard measure for a roux and this soup had a great balance in taste. I am glad I didn't toss your recipe. :)

Good recipe.  Here's how I made it:  I browned the chicken with some garlic and diced onion.  Then I cooked it approximately 1-1/2 cups of chicken broth along with the broccoli, and some finely diced carrots and celery.  After the veggies and chicken were cooked, I removed the mixture from the pan.  Then I made the roux and added the remaining broth.  Returned the veggie mix to the pot and then added the milk and cheese.  Only thing I'd do different is to not add quite so much salt - I forgot how much salt there is in cheese.

Excellent soup!! My 7 year old LOVED it. Good consistency albeit a little bland. Maybe a little onion and a pinch of ceyenne to add a little kick. Best served with a nice crusty french bread.

This was delicious, and my somewhat picky 8-year-old ate four (!) helpings.  It was a bit bland, but my husband and I both put a little hot sauce in ours, and it was perfect.  Next time, I think using good, sharp cheddar would make it even better.  My only complaint is that it was a little difficult to blend the flour/butter roux into the soup because I would usually whisk it in to avoid lumps, which I could not do because of the chicen and broccoli pieces. We did find a couple on small, un-blended roux-lumps in our soup.  Overall, though, delicious, filling, and reasonably healthy with FF half and half.

Excellent! Instead of 11 c. water and 1 c. cream I used 10 c. water and 2 c. whole milk. I blended the flour/butter mixture and milk together in the blender before adding it to the soup. If you want to increase the thickness, add 1/4 c. more flour to the butter.

Recipe couldn't be any better.  I did change the recipe by using 1 bag of frozen broccoli that I had in the freezer.  I would do it again next time to keep it easy.
Thanks for sharing!

I had to make soup for 25 people for a progressive dinner. I didn't want anything too heavy. I decided to omit the chicken and double the rest of the recipe. Because there was no raw chicken to cook, I reduced the cooking time to 30 minutes. It turned out awesome! I am sure it will be just as good with the chicken added back in. I also added about 3 cloves of minced garlic (because I am a garlic lover).

A great soup.  I did alter it a bit!  Didn't use the chicken, used 1/2 tsp salt and split the 11 cups of water and 1 cup light cream into 2 c. water, 2 c. 1% milk, 1 cup 1/2 and 1/2, 2 c. chicken stock.

No need to double to double here; this recipe makes a large quantity.  I only slightly deviated from this recipe because of ingredients around available around the house; It's good as it stands.  I used some different cheeses that i wanted to use up and you really need to thin the rue (flour/ butter mixture) with some milk or whipping cream before putting into the soup.  I used both milk and whipping cream and then didn't add it to the recipe later.

Absolutely delicious! For slimming reasons, I only added half a cup of cheese and a tablespoon of cream. I also placed it in the blender for 2 seconds to shred the chicken. It was scrumptious! Thank you.

This was definitely a delicious soup! I tried to cut the chicken up into canned-soup-like pieces. And I also cooked the paste just a little past raw so it would not taste raw.

Such a yummy soup!  I added something that put it over the top, I  just had to share!  Like others, I used chicken broth instead of soup and I used a good quality cheddar (not shredded stuff in the bag) but it still needed something.  I had a nice stilton (blue) cheese in the fridge and crumbled about 1/3 c and added that in.  It was amazing!  You would not have known it was blue cheese that you were tasting, but it definitely added another layer of flavor.  Highly recommend. . .   It was AMAZING!

Tried this for the first time last night and loved it. I varied a bit by adding maybe a half an onion and 3 stalks of celery that I minced in the food processor. I also used rotisserie chicken and diced that real small too. I don't like chunky soup so I also chopped the broccoli super fine.  I used whole milk instead of cream and 4c cheddar.  Yum!

Very good!  I used ham instead of chicken, so I needed less seasoning.  I also cut the recipe in 1/2 and it was just enough for a hearty bowl for 4 of us.  Served with some garlic and cheese bisuits and voila! a nice comfort food to have a on this snowy winter night!

I didn't measure anything as I wanted a smaller pot of soup for my lunch and my 3 year old.  It was thick and creamy and cheesy.  My son really liked it, but broccoli is one of his favorite veggies :-)

Wonderful recipe! We used canned chicken broth instead of bouillon and water, and also used milk instead of cream. Also I prefer thicker soup, so we added a little bit of mashed potato flakes at the end to thicken it up. Really yummy and flavorful.

Delicious - did make changes to the recipe.  Sauteed onions and garlic with the chicken a little - then added chicken broth and some extra spices (nutmeg, thyme, red pepper).  I waited about 20 minutes before putting the broccoli in since some stated how it all becomes really mushy really fast.  And then mixed in the roux.  I used a bit less flour than called for in the mix since i found it caked up quickly.  even with slow stirring and mixing.  But great recipe for a cold night!

I started by browning the chicken cubes in a little oil, then removed them.  I then also sauteed some onions and garlic in a little more oil, added the butter and the flour.  I also didn't remove the roux and just continued by adding the water and boullion, which I used 5 cubes, instead of 3.  I used frozen broccoli and added cubed potatoes, and added the browned chicken back to simmer. I used an extra cup of cheese (as the pre-shredded cheees came in a 4 cup bag) and added heavy cream (as it was the only container that came in 8 oz.).  It came out wonderfully, but think I would either add more broccoli and chicken, or use less liquid.  And might cook the brocoli and potatoes separately and add towards the end, as they mosly broke apart.

I am only giving this recipe three stars "as is." Based on other reviews and my own taste, I changed this recipe by adding 1/2 onion & 2 cloves of garlic (sautee first) and some thyme & parsley. I also added more salt & pepper than what the recipe called for. It would have been very bland without these changes! I added more cheese (about 3/4 cup) as well. In addition, I made the roux and added whisked my liquid (NOT WATER! CHICKEN BROTH/STOCK!) into it. You don't add the paste to the liquid!! Ew. Anyway, other than that, I used frozen broccoli and cooked the chicken in a pan before adding to simmer in the soup. Okay recipe, not stellar. I'll be looking for a different version to add to my recipe rotation.

Better than restaurant quality. This recipe makes a lot but it tastes even better the next day, and freezes well. I agree with other reviewers, wait to add salt until after you've added the cheese.

Delicious!  Try it with cubed ham instead of chicken - it's to die for!  I also recommend using low-sodium chicken broth instead of bouillon, especially if you are using ham as this will add more salt.

FOLLOW these changes for a perfect SOUP!  First, sautee 1/2 cup onions and 2 cloves of garlic in soup pot.  Then I used equal parts vegetable & chicken stock (8-10 cups total), all the called for ingredients above, 1/2 cup diced celery, a few pinches of: red pepper, nutmeg, bacon bits & hot sauce.  During 45 minutes of simmering, I added the roux.  I finished by using only 8 oz. of velveeta and a few shakes of parmesan.  It was plenty cheesy without all the fat.   ENJOY

Simply the most delicious soup!  My one year old ate and ate this soup, with his hands(messy of course), and kept saying mmmmmm.  My husband and I loved it equally as much.  In fact, my husband said "you mean, you made this from scratch, mmmmmm".  I kept everything the same except I substituted onion salt for regular salt.  Also, I added some garlic powder, onion powder, and I used chicken broth in place of the boullion/water.  Thanks and I mean thanks for the wonderful recipe!

A lovely hearty soup. I'd advise against using that much salt though! As has been said before, sauteeing an onion with garlic first and adding a little cayenne pepper really does give it the extra kick needed. Next time I'd probably use more cheese - perhaps a cup of parmesan. 

All in all a great base soup with bags of potential for experimentation. Tasty too!

So good!!!  Added paprika parsley, and curry to taste.   Adding about a cup of cooked liquid back to flour mix made it easy to mix with soup and not lumpy. Next time I will double the brocolli since it nearly dissolves while cooking.  Would be just as good with no chicken. Can't wai till winter to curl up to a bowl.

I was pleasantly surprised at how my husband and sons actually liked this.  It was pretty good!  I made it super easy on myself, and I don't believe my cooking method changed anything at all.  I started with the butter (added some shallot and garlic), stirred in the flour, then added the chicken broth (instead of bouillon & water) and the milk (instead of cream) and all the rest of the ingredients.  I let it simmer stove top for a couple of hours, stirring occasionally, until I was ready to serve it (with broiled french bread).  It was a one-pot, easy, pretty yummy meal!

Love this soup! Too much salt the first time I made it. This time I used 6 cups of water and 5 cups of low sodium chicken broth. I personally like to make my roux and then add the broth (cold) right to it. I added about 3 cups of the broth to it and continued stirring until it thickened. Then I added the cheese. After all the cheese was melted and the consistency was thick I then transferred into a large pot that already contained the brocolli, remaining broth and water. Didn't add chicken the 2nd time around but just didn't want it in there this time. May add potatoes next time. Great recipe!

This was not a family favorite at all.  I personally thought that it was bland and I also used chicken broth, the paste mixture at the end of the cooking was very hard to mix into the soup and not get lumpy.  Be prepared to make a few changes to this.

I changed this recipe by using chicken stock and also I added a little curry which gave it tons of flavor. I also used more cheese.  My whole family had seconds. It was great!

i used chedder cheese and processed chedder cheeses.  I added onion and potatoes.  Unlike what someone else said the flour mixture wasnt a prob for me, i simply whisked the soup repeatedly to avoid lumps, and the few VERY SMALL lumps that remained were actually tastey.  I have made other cheese broccoli soups but this batch was remarked the best one by my hubby!

I was really excited about this soup, but a little frustrated by the prep. I used part water/boullion combo and part chicken broth for the base. I shredded most of the broccoli by hand and left a couple bigger pieces. It did not take 45 minutes to cook, more like 10-15. The roux did not work very well for me. It was very time consuming to add it in such a way that it did not leaving floating clumps in the soup. I only used about 1/2 the prepared amount. I also used finely shredded cheddar cheese and I think the thicker shred would have been better in this soup. Once I finished, it was very good (I sprinkled it with chopped tomatoes and raw purple onions just before serving) but did not have as much broccoli-cheese flavor as I would have liked(and I used a lot of cheese). I would make this soup again, but modify the base to less chicken-y and use thicker shredded cheese.

The chicken fat came out while the soup was cooking and I had to skim it.  The flour paste was terrible and left little lumps of flour in the soup!  Big failure for me-won't do this one again.

Great soup!! My husband loved it and he is a bacon and potato man. It was very easy and quick to make this soup. I had a bag of cut up veggies which made it all the easier. It also taste great the next day.

I made this tonight with a few modifications. Sautéed onion and garlic with butter, then added flour, cooking for a minute. Next I added broth, canned cooked chicken, fresh broccoli, and seasonings (salt, pepper, hot sauce, bacon pieces &  nutmeg), cooking until broccoli was tender. Since I didn't have cream, I substituted cream cheese. I used my immersion blender to chop broccoli and incorporate cream cheese, taking care not to completely puree everything. Finally added cheddar, increased to about 1/2 cup more than recipe stated. Deliciousness plus!!

This soup was delicious. I did make a few changes, I used slightly more butter, probably closer to 1 and 1/3 cups and I used about 4 cups of chicken broth plus 3 cups of water. I also only used one head of broccoli since that was all I had, and half and half cream instead of light. It turned out great, creamy and delicious, and was even better after I let it sit for a few hours and it congealed a bit. I would probably use entirely chicken broth next time instead of water, or only add 2 cups of water, to intensify the flavour. I will definitely be making this again

Love, love! I used chicken broth instead of water and bouillon. Plus, thyme, marjoram, rosemary, and sea sal to taste.. I used half of cheese and then supplied croutons, roasted pumpkin seeds, chopped green onion, fresh ground pepper, and shredded cheddar cheese as toppings. Delicious!

Delicious. It was a hit- especially with the kids! Based on other reviews, I substituted the 11 cups water with  7 cups chicken broth and 4 cups water. I wanted a broccoli cheese soup without the processed cheese, but with fresh cheese instead, so thanks to you, I have it now.

I really liked the soup, my kids liked it more than I do.  I used turkey instead of chicken and browned that in butter with 3 chopped cloves of garlic.  I cooked the broccoli in 4 cups of chicken broth (only needed enough for 4 people).  Added the turkey to the stock and then made the roux adding it slowly, as suggested, to the stock.  Finally added LOTS of mild cheddar.  It was great!  Thanks for the recipe.

Good soup (I did change it a little, that is why I only gave it 4 stars) I like my soup a little thicker so I added some potato flakes. I want to try this with some garlic, etc. I will make this again. We all liked it.

Great comfort food!  I went with several people's suggestions and added garlic and onions to the butter and once I added the flour and stirred, I added all the water and other ingredients as well rather than separating this part and adding later.  It was much more convenient and worked just fine.  Also added red pepper flakes for more flavor and a bit of extra cheese.  Very good recipe and brought back flavors of home as we are living overseas in a 3rd world country where you can't buy things like this at restaurants!

Very nice!! I did saute the chicken with a clove of garlic and some seasonings for 5-10 minutes before putting it in the water. I think this adds the needed extra flavor. Also the comments around the supper table was that next time we should add chopped celery - this can only enhance this already good soup.

This was really good but needed some tweaking. I Sauted the chicken with 2tsp of garlic. The boullion was not enough, I had double it. I'll use stock next time. I used a 16oz package of frozen broccoli chopped it in the food processor. (My wife hates the chunks) Doing so required only 20minutes simmering rather than the 45. We loved it!

We really enjoyed this recipe. I did use real chicken broth instead of cubes and once everything had cooked I took a potatoe masher to break up the broccoli. I also used canned milk so I could freeze it without the seperation and to cut down on some fat. simple and tastes great.

My hubby, daughter and I all really liked this soup.  I thought that it could have been cheesier so I added an extra cup and a half of cheese.  I probably would have added even more if I had it.

Did not use butter, flour & salt.  Substituted milk for cream & ham for chicken.  Used 1 c. shredded cheddar cheese & 1/2 lb velveeta.  Thickened with the milk & cornstarch.

RATING: Husband, kids and myself all thought it was delicious! We had it for dinner last night and the rest was finished as leftovers today. I ate it plain, but one of my sons loved it with bacon crumbles.
CHANGES: because I had read so much about there being not enough flavor I decided to add another bullion cube to mine.  It came out very salty - so next time I think I'll add the bullion cube but minus the salt.  I also did not have a normal pot big enough so I boiled the items initially in a pot with about 2/3 of the water, then transfered it into a crockpot (with the remaining water amount already heating inside) to finish it. I think maybe next time I'll try potatoes as others have done.

Great recipe... I did tweak a tad bit and it still came out great...  I did make the roux but I added olive oil along with the butter to make the consistency of the roux better.  I also kept the roux in the pot while I added the other ingredients.  Must admit I utilized onions and green peppers along with frozen broccoli and I also added potatoes with artichoke hearts... Came out awesome and like other reviews was better the next day.  I also utilized sharp cheddar cheese... Highly recommended on a cold night!

This was very good....but not quite as good as some others that I have tried...with a little tweaking I think I could turn this one into a five star recipe. Next time...I will use Velveeta cheese and maybe some onion and garlic.

I had high hopes and watering tastebuds while making this soup but was really let down... it was REALLY bland and a previous reviewer was right when she said it doesn't make sense to add the flour paste after everything is encorporated... hard to get the lumps out. I ended up having to melt cheese wiz all over the top of the soup so that my family would eat it.  Next time I think I will use a sharp/old cheddar instead of regular cheddar and... I dunno it needs SOMETHING to give it a better taste.

Fantastic! I used an immersion blender to blend it all (and got a little too carried away), which might be why it's not 100% perfect (maybe it should be chunkier)...but otherwise, great! I halved the recipe and sauteed the chicken with 1/4 of an onion, 2 tbsp of butter, and one clove of garlic. I also wouldn't add the roux to the soup--do it the other way around to save yourself the hassle of finding (and getting rid of) clumps of flour and butter.

THIS WAS GREAT!!!!  I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but pretty close.  I only had frozen broccoli so I waited until the very end and put it in the pot about 10 minutes or so.  I added a lot of cheese.  Mine did come out a little thin at first, but as it sat in the fridge over the next day or so, it thickened almost seemed like a chowder.  I actually ate it the next morning for breakfast, it was THAT good! LOL  Hubby loved it too, he kept raving about it! Thanks for the great recipe!

This soup is very easy to make, and even though we halved the recipe there was lots.  The long simmering time makes it unnecessary to blend it to make it creamy like most broccoli soups.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I think it needs more seasoning.  The addition of an onion would help.  I will definitely make it again.

I adore this soup!  I've made it a number of times, so I've adapted it quite a bit to my tastes.  Some notable changes: I add garlic and an onion, halve the butter, increase the chicken boullion, add the liquid into the flour mixture instead of the other way around, and puree the soup (I add the chicken at the end so it's still in chunks).  I find that the cheese blends best if it's at room temperature before I add it.  Everyone I've made this soup for has loved it!

I halved this recipe.  It made a lot.  I did make some changes. To the 1/2 recipe, I used 1 carton (4c.) of chicken stock and 1 1/2 cups of water instead of the water and boullion cubes.  I added 1/2 chopped onion and 1 clove of minced garlic.  After simmering for 45 minutes, I added about 1 cup finely chopped cauliflower and 1 large carrot, chopped fine.  Then I simmered it until they were tender.  I added a couple of shakes of cayenne (not too much).  I also used 2% milk instead of the cream to make it healthier.  In addition to the cheddar cheese, I added a couple of good shakes of parmesan cheese.  I then put it in the fridge to sit overnight to let the flavours mingle.  

My husband said it was the best soup I had made.

Very good - I did make a couple of changes - mostly based on reviews here. I sauted onions and garlic first with a little cayenne pepper.  I also added some shredded gouda and parm along with the chedder.  Yummy!

WONDERFUL!  My only addition, was about 8oz of velveta.  I sarted the broccoli cooking in the water along with the chicken seasonings. After about an hour, I added the velveta along with some cut up chicken that I roasted the night before. Then I started the flour roux and added that at the end with the half and half and 3 cups of mild cheddar, medium cheddar, jack and colby cheeses.  I served this with Amish Bread on this site and everyone raved!  Thanks!!

My family LOVED this recipe and that is no small task!  I took the advice of others and added sauteed onion, potato and substituted cream for half and half.  Delicious!!  We'll be making this again!

This soup is great. So much nicer than canned soup. I like my roux to be at the beginning too, so didn't even try it the other way. Other than that, I made this exactly like the recipe. It was very good and I give it 5 stars. However, in addressing the others concerns over lack of zip, I then made these changes: I added a pinch of cayenne and then a little bit of shredded parmesan. That seemed to give it a little "extra" although, I found it was good either way. Thank you!!

I cut this recipe in half.  I sauteed an onion and garlic in a pan before adding and cooking the chicken.  Also I added a little bit of liquid to the flour mixture a little at a time before adding it into my soup.  I used chicken broth instead as well.  I used a full bag of mexican style shredded cheese, so 2 full cups for 1/2 the recipe, and also added a 1/8 of a block of velveeta.  I was great!  I cooked it earlier in the day when I had the time and put it in the crock pot on warm until dinner was ready.  Great with a light sandwich.

Very good recipe.  The only changes I made were I shredded the chicken, almost doubled the cheese (couldn't taste the cheese in the amount the recipe called for - and that was with sharp cheddar) and cut back the salt to 1/2 tsp.  It still was a little salty so I will probably cut back to 1/4 tsp next time.  The whole family enjoyed it.  Thanks!

I did what others said and added more cheese, but even then I think I still needed MORE cheese!  It was a bit bland.  It was awesome with sliced french bread with olive oil baked in the oven for 10 minutes, though.  A whole meal in itself, yum yum.

Also, I didn't care for the chicken in it.  My boyfriend didn't mind it, but I thought it was much too bland and ended up just eating the broccoli.

Is half and half equal to light cream?  I wasn't sure, so that's what I used.

Overall, very good, though!  I will be making it again, but next time with no chicken, more cheese, and substituting maybe half the water for chicken broth.

This was very good.  I gave it 4 stars because it wasn't one of those "outstanding" soups.  I really think more cheese would make it slightly better.  I would make this again trying more cheese.

I used 2 cans of chicken broth, 2 boullion cubes and 9 cups of water.... wasn't sure about the "light cream" so I used 1/2 heavy cream and 1/2 2% milk.  My family and I really liked this soup and I have passed it on to my parents who love to cook!!  Thanks Rebecca for a great one!!!

I love to modify recipes to suit my own tastes and this one was no exception. I had a whole chicken and a half pound of bacon on hand to use up, so I boiled the chicken, removed the meat, and shredded it by hand. I'm not a big lover of chicken in soup, so I added probably half of what the recipe calls for. I fried the bacon 2/3's of the way done (until it was chewy, but not crisp) and also shredded that by hand into the soup. I omitted the bouillon cubes. Instead, I decreased the water by 2 cups and added 2 cans of chicken broth. I also used skim milk in place of the cream. I thought it was delicious. The soup portion itself tasted great and I can't imagine why some of these reviews want thicker soup. If mine had been any thicker in consistency, it couldn't have been called "soup"!

This is a great recipe as is. The only problem I had was getting the *paste* not to clump when I added it to the soup.  Don't add anything to this, try it as is first! It is delicious!

THE best soup I've ever made. The addition of chicken is brilliant. I've made this soup several times and it is SO easy, and probably impossible to mess up. Everyone who tries it loves it.

I added 1 tsp of thyme and 1 tsp of tarragon when the broccoli was simmering. I used fat free half and half. It was very filling and just right for dinner on a cold NE night.

I think this soup was so delicious that I will make it again, and again, and again. My husband is doing a low carb diet, and this was PERFECT for that. The flavor is so incredible, there is NONE left, despite the fact the recipe made 10 servings, and there was only four adults! Absolutely scrumptious.

This was not as fabulous as I expected.  I used broccoli & potatoes.  I did not add chicken, but next time I will definitely try with the chicken.  I used milk instead of cream.  I will try some thing different when adding the flour and butter, maybe do that step at the end.

I packed this in my husband's lunch and he called me from work to rave about how fabulous it was.  I loved how the flour/butter paste trick thickened the soup up without lumps.  It seemed so much more "real" than when you just dump in a can of some pre-made "cream of whatever" soup.  It was all pretty easy, too.  I'll definately make this again and again.

This was a delicious soup!  My sister asked me to make her some soup because she wasn't feeling well and I looked for a reipe online.  I am very glad I found this!  Thank you.  My whole family loved it.

The only thing I altered was the amount of water.  I used 8 cups instead of 11 and it was a delicious, thick soup.

Excellent! No one, and I mean no one, did not lick the bowl clean after this meal. It's creamy, flavorful, and wonderful with some extra cheese on top. That's all I would modify- more cheese! Thanks for this recipe.

I love soup and thought this recipe was great. I did not alter anything.  I would add that you probably should liked broccoli before trying this recipe.  It tasted as good as any I have had in a fine restaurant.  Definitely a keeper.

Excellent!  I have used chicken breast and canned chicken.  Make usre you really stir when adding flour mixture back in so that it dissolves, otherwise, the floury clumps hide in the creamy soup and don't tase very good!

This soup is definitely worthy of all the great reviews...I just modified it a bit:  1) instead of chicken breasts, I boiled a young chicken (Mom always told me the meat on the small, young birds is better), de-boned the chicken and used that instead 2) instead of the 11 cups of water, I used the chicken stock I got from the boiled chicken, I doubled the cream and used heavy instead of light.  I doubled it because the soup seemed a little salty for my taste (plus I used Knorr boullion cubes, and I think they may have been a tad bigger than the run-of-the-mill cubes)..so you may want to save the salt until the end and salt-to-taste instead of adding it during "adding the ingredients" part.  It really is a very lovely soup and not at all "cheesey", as I was afraid.  I wouldn't even have known there was cheese in it... oh, and 3) I also added a cup of sliced baby carrots which added some color and sweetness.  I DEFINITELY am making this one again!

This soup tasted so good I couldn't believe I made it. It was like something I would order in a restaurant. I followed the recipe as written, except I used 2 1/2 lbs. chicken. There was plenty left and the next day it made a great lunch. I was surprised that to make such a great soup it was so easy. If you are looking for a cheesy chicken and broccoli soup, look no further--this is it!

This was yummy!  Served with a baguette for dipping, made a great light dinner and a fabulous lunch the next day.  2 and 4 year olds enjoyed as well (they even ate the broccoli).  Only changes I made were halving the recipe, used a cheddar/colby/monterey jack blend, and added a little cayenne pepper for an extra kick.  Delicious!

I did make some changes.  This is a very versatile recipe and quite easy.  After making the roux (flour paste) I added the 1 cup milk and 2 cups of the water, gradually, a little at a time stirring til smooth.  Then I added the cheese (I substituted low fat cream cheese for the cheddar-its what I had), salt and pepper.  In a separate pot, I used the remaining water (and added the bouillon) to cook veggies and then added cooked, diced chicken.  I threw in some leftover rice, peas and corn that I had in the fridge.  I then added the original roux (flour) mixture to the soup.  My soup was not too thick (as some claimed) and you can do so much with this basic recipe adding whatever veggies you have on hand or some diced ham would even be a good addition.  I served this with some fresh baked biscuits and it was a hit with my family.  Thank you Rebecca for recipe.

YUMMY! I just made it and it was more than I expected, even after reading the other reviews..I thought I would have to add more seasoning at the end like I usually have to in other recipes..but this one is perfect! I didn't add or take anything away! But don't add too much flower  in the beginning..I added too much! :)

Great recipe. A definite keeper.  I did make some minor changes. As others i used chicken stock but also braised the chicken breasts and used the chicken broth it created. I also pureed the  about 3/4 of the broth and broccoli in a blender returning it to pot adding the remaining ingredients to simmer and melt the cheese.  I also added some hot sauce and the nutmeg.

Still not as great as some restaurants' I've had, but this is the best recipe I've found for it.  Added some broth to the roux and mixed it well before pouring the thinned mixture into the soup.  Also, I used half and half instead of cream, and added just a bit more cheddar.

This might be my favorite soup. I crave it on a regular basis. I do make a few minor changes as recommended by other reviewers, but I think it would be 5 stars without the changes, too. I add chopped onion and minced garlic to the butter before adding the flour. I use 8 cups chicken broth instead of water and bullion, and I always use sharp cheddar cheese. It truly is comfort food.

This is a good starter recipe. I tweeked a few things. First, I always make whole roasted chickens for the family so I boiled the leftover carcass all day to get a nice broth base. When I felt the broth was strong enough I added the broccoli and let it soften and then used an immersion blender to chop the cooked broccoli. After that I made a roux and stirred it into the soup, added the cream and the salt and pepper, and then I put the leftover roasted chicken  (cubed) in, and then I melted the cheese into the soup.  It's delicious and very easy and economical. The family loves it.

Very good for when it's cold outside and it's easy to make! This recipe feeds a lot of people, so I would recommend cutting it in half for a smaller household.

Excellent! Left out the salt. Didn't need it. Garnished with some steamed small broccoli florets and bacon bits for presentation.

Wow - I have made this a few times, the only changes were to used chicken broth rather than water and bullion cubes. So good, my hubby loves this soup. If I want everyone to be happy, just serve this soup - happy family!!

I used cream of broccoli cheese and cream of potatoes instead of water and I also used heavy whipping cream instead of light cream. My family loved it!

I used left over cooked chicken and didn't have to cook for 45 minutes. I substituted milk for the cream and it was still delish.
 This recipe could be cut in half for a smaller portion.

Followed the basic recipe for 4 servings, although I added an extra cup of water to cover the broccoli.  Instead of using salt and pepper, I opted to use a couple good shakes of Nature's Seasoning and Tarragon.   I used 1 Knorrs Chicken bulllion cube, which is equivalent to 2 cubes in other brands.  I had regular half and half and Kraft Shredded Extra Sharp Cheddar on hand, so that's what I used.  The soup was just the right thickness that I like, it was absolutely delicious.  Since I was fixing this for myself, I have plenty left over for lunch tomorrow.  I'll definitely be making this again.  Thank you Rebecca for such a great recipe.

I made some changes so that it would be thicker and more cheesie. I added 5 cups of cheddar cheese and heavy cream instead of light cream. I also substituted the bouillon cubes for around 4 or 5 cups of chicken broth and 3 cups of water.  I added bacon instead of chicken to add a pop of flavour. It was delicious!!

I cut the recipe by 1/3.   Used chicken broth rather than water & reduced the cheese a bit more. And no light cream.     It turned out GREAT.   Just wish I had made more.   Definitely will be on the menu this winter!!

I like that it doesn't use processed cheese product. I sauteed some onion & garlic with the butter before adding the flour, added some cauliflower because I didn't have enough broccoli. Left out the chicken and it was still very hearty and satisfying. Will definitely make again.

Great starting point for a delicious soup. I made some modifications- like another poster, I sauteed half an onion and 3 minced garlic cloves in the butter to be used to make the roux. Then made the roux first without removing it- I could see no need to do so. We also decided to grill the chicken and add at the end, for more flavor. The addition of sliced carrots and mushrooms really took it up another level. Added 1/2 tsp of cayenne, also

I made this on a whim to try something different, but my Fiance liked it so much, he requests it every week! 
I tweaked the recipe a bit...I got 2 packages of chicken and I boiled them in water 'til they were cooked all the way through, then shredded them..It made for a smoother soup instead of the chunks. I also cooked a chopped onion with cloves of garlic for added flavor..
I also added cooked rice into the mix (the boil-in-bag rice tastes the best with this), and that was what made it AH-MAZINGGGGGGGGGG. I think without the rice it would've been decent soup, but the chicken, broccoli, cheese, and rice made an incredible combination!!!! SOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOOOD!!!! Putting this recipe in the book, because I'll definitely be using it again and again. Yummy!!!

I used cream instead of light. I didn't have fresh broccoli, so I used frozen.  The only complaint I have is the cheese didn't melt down totally. It coated the spoon. I've never had that happen before.

Wonderfully delicious! I sautéed a grated onion in a little olive oil. I melted a stick of butter in onion mixture and added a cup of flour to the mixture. When roux was sufficiently thickened and bubbly, I slowly added 10 cups of chicken broth to flour mixture (whisking continually). I omitted the chicken altogether, but added 3 small heads of broccoli florets and salt and pepper. I brought it up to a boil, stirring constantly. Then I let it simmer 45 minutes. Then I added a cup of heavy cream and a 16 ounce block of extra sharp cheddar cheese (shredded). This soup was amazing!

My husband LOVED this soup! It's even better the second day. I left out the chicken because I didn't have any but it's so rich and thick you don't need it. I used milk instead of cream and used only 8 cups of water. Definitely will make again!

This was pretty good but as so many other reviewers added ingredients I had to also.  Therefore I can only rate it as a starter recipe.  Reviewer EJMATL made an entirely different recipe if you ask me.

8 24 16 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/12992/cheese-and-broccoli-chicken-soup/ ... Honesty:  I changed it, but changes weren't drastic; & I "thirded" it.  Here's how it went ... I've been given the assignment to find an excellent (as in Panera-ish) broccoli cheese soup.  Due to that, I've made a few recipes & am not making huge pots for just a taste.  Here goes - I  thawed a 10oz? package of frozen broccoli.  I took half that & put it in the blender with 1 1/2 c homemade chicken broth.  Last soup was "too chunky" :?  :D  'Melted 3T butter with 1t oil.  Whisked in 1/4c flour. & cooked a minute or two.  Slowly added the broccoli/broth with 1/2t salt & 1/4t pepper.  Let that come to a boil for a 2 - 3 minutes - till the broccoli was cooked, soup was thickened & tasted good.  It really did already.   Then, stirred in 1/3c half & half.  Removed from the heat, added the 1c cheese & a few shakes nutmeg.  I'm more of a no cheese with my vegetables kind of girl, but I liked it.  Wow!  & no, no chicken.  K, 17, reason for  making, thumbs down.  First day, I liked; reheat, not good.

Very good, great starting place.. Just like several others I put my own spin on it, added onion, garlic, and some carrots.. Used chicken broth instead of the water and chicken bouillon.   Husband loved it... Said I could make this anytime

I'm not a big fan of broccoli, but my mom wanted some broccoli cheese soup and this was the recipe I ended up trying.  We both loved it, and even better is how cheap it ends up being to make.  I've made it both with and without the chicken, and it's good either way.  I did end up substituting chicken broth for the water/bouillon, and whole milk/butter for the cream, though.  Thanks for sharing this recipe,we're both keeping it, lol.

If you have the  need for rich and flavorful and are tired of counting calories and diet sodas, try this soup. I changed the cheddar to a velveeta style of cheese for punch, start with 8 oz and work your way up to your taste. I added two pinches of nutmeg and half teaspoon of cayenne. A teaspoon of chopped garlic. Frozen broccoli is more economical with no sacrifice in flavor. I enjoyed a side dish of blue corn tortilla chips with my soup.

This was so good! My daughter helped me prep and stir. She said we definitely need to make this soup again. To cut down on the sodium, I did substitute the bouillon cubes with chicken broth.  To kick it up, my daughter added crushed red pepper to her bowl.

So easy and so delicious! Finally, a recipe that doesn't call for "processed cheese product loaf." Cooking with whole foods to make a comfort-food meal is ideal! I used eight cups of chicken stock and four cups of veggie broth and the flavor is PERFECT! Works very well at high altitude (9,500ft...hence the extra liquid).

This was really good soup. I rated it 4 stars because some modifications need to be made to make it 5 stars. Mods: First, use more butter than directed when mixing with flour at the beginning to make a roux. It should be somewhat a thick liquid and not a paste. This is important or you'll have chunks of flour in your soup later on... Next, I used half chicken stock and half water, not water with the  chicken cubes. Next, there are no steps for how to cook the chicken. In a separate pan, I seared 4 bonless skinless thighs (salt, pepper, little paprika, little red pepper flakes)  finally adding onion and lots of minced garlic to the pan until it glistened. Chopped the chicken and tossed that mixture in with the broth. After simmering broth, broccoli, chicken, onion, and garlic for 45 min - add cream, use half cup more than directed. Also change the amount of cheddar, use double the amount of shredded cheese directed. Season to taste. Finally, add some chopped green onion and bacon as a garnish to the bowls of soup.  Serve with bread, I used garlic buttered sourdough.

Pretty good basic recipe, but like everyone else , it seems, I made a few alterations.  I started by making only a half recipe for four people. I boiled the chicken separately and shredded it.   After removing the rue from the pot, I sauteed a cup of finely diced onions along with a cup of finely diced celery and a couple of minced garlic gloves.   Used chicken broth instead of bouillon.  After removing the broccoli florets I put the broccoli stalks along with two carrots in the food processor and pulverized them. Added this along with the broccoli florets.   Last change, used half and half instead of cream and shredded extra sharp New York cheddar.  Came out very thick and smooth.  VERY TASTY.

Agreed that chicken stock results in a higher quality final soup.  I used a variety of cheeses that I had on hand (cheddar, american, mozzarella) and it was great.  I also threw in some finely chopped bacon and that was a good addition as well.  Thumbs up from my family of 5!

I used the "Better than Boullion" chicken base for the stock which is delicious in my opinion.  The third time I made this I realized that the butter/flour combination is a hassle to blend in the soup.  I used a fine strainer to break up the flour and just added the stick of butter afterwards.  I also added garlic when I sautéed the chicken for taste.  Some of the best broccoli soup I've ever had.

Followed the first couple of suggestions regarding the roux and adding chicken broth first. I sautéed finely chopped leeks to throw in also.

I never took the flour and butter out of the pan... Never heard of that and I guess I read it wrong... I just slowly added all the water, whisking it in, and I had no problems that way. Honestly not sure how you'd stir  the roué in afterwards... Added 1.5 lbs of chicken breast because that's what I had and I added about 4 cups of cheese per request of the man in the house. I might cut back on the pepper a little just because I am not a fan of the taste of black pepper.  I write these reviews to give me a heads up for the next time I make it... And I will because  dusty loved it (the man I was talking about)

To this wonderful recipie i added a few things and it really added a kick to it.  I started with sauteed onion, 3 strips of bacon, leeks, carrot, turnip and instead of the chicken breast I used chicken legs added 1 ts cumin, 1 ts sugar red pepper flakes once it all was nicely seasoned I pressure cooked it to preserve the vitamins. After  20 min I used the hand blender and made it real smooth.  I loved spicing  it up !!  Everyone  loved it ..it was a cold snowy night in Toronto so it really hit the spot and made the whole floor of our high rise building smell like home. Amazing how the aroma of home cooking transforms a cold condo to a comfortable home. Thank you for the amazing recipie

I hate broccoli but I loved it in this and so did my family. I did take the hint of using stock and adding fried onions, garlic, bacon and cayenne pepper, although 1/8 teaspoon of spice was enough. I was worried about the flour, so reduced that to 1/4 cup and about 1 tbsp of butter, and I stirred and toasted the dryish flour and butter mixture for quite a long time until it had started to color. I cut the chicken into small cubes, I thought it would overcook but it turned out fine. Will be using this recipe any time I want to get rid of broccoli.

I used only 5 cups water, and combined it with 5 cups chicken stock, instead of bullion cubes I used a chicken flavored broth base and seasoning powder. I boiled the chicken in broth and water until I could shred it, then I threw in the broccoli along with a couple of cups of chopped cooked bacon. Then mixed in the cream, flour mixture and cheese. Good stuff. Better with ritz crackers.

Then after 45 min was up... i added the 1 c whiiping cream and 16 oz of cubed valveeta cheese. i love it! I made some white rice on the side. so good mixed together in my bowl where it is just creamy, not soupy

Absolutely delicious!!  I did make some changes, but only to procedure, not ingredients.  I cooked the broccoli and chicken in broth (I used the boxed stuff), then at the end of cooking time, I scooped out the chicken so I could use an immersion blender on the broccoli.  (Experience - my kids won't eat it if I leave the broccoli whole!)  Then I made the roux separately.  I was really thrown by the proportions in the roux, as it basically made a thick glop with just a cup of cream.  I quickly figured out I had to add a large amount of the broccoli/broth and cook the roux that way before adding it back to the main pot.  Added the cheese at the end, served it in homemade Italian bread bowls (dough in the bread machine), and it was a hit!  This original recipe makes a LOT of soup, though.

It was very good & makes a complete meal.  Made according to recipe except substituted broth for water and bouillon.  Added other ingredients to roux & cooked all.  Turned out very good; will definitely make again.

I loved this recipe!! First broccoli cheese chicken soup I made.   Only thing I did different because I had this on hand, was used whole drumsticks and I also put everything in a crockpot for 4hours on low to cook the chicken.

Very tasty I definitely would make it again. The only problem was that the butter flour mix got cold and very stiff waiting for the rest to cook for 45 min, then did not mix in well. I will do that step last with another pan next time.

I served it to a family of five, and we all loved it! I made numerous changes.

I first roasted some chopped onion and garlic in the butter. Like many others, I used the base made with butter and flour as a starter and added the other ingredients. Much easier. 

I used 10 cups total of half chicken stock, half chicken broth. I personally would not use water, especially tap water. I slowly stirred in the chicken stock using a whisk, keeping it from getting lumpy. 

I brought that to a slow boil, and added two whole boneless chicken breasts, fresh broccoli (2-3 heads worth), sea salt, black (and a little white) pepper, garlic powder and a sprinkling of Mrs. Dash. I never measure spices. I go by "feel" and taste. 

I had all of that on a slow boil for approx 50 min. I removed the chicken, and shredded it with two forks and returned it to the pot. I then placed the flame on simmer. 

Meanwhile, I had cut up a small box of Velveeta into cubes. I slowly stirred this in until melted. I then added the rest of the cheese via fresh shredded mild cheddar. Finally, I used Half and Half instead of light cream and added that in. I let all that simmer for another 15 min or so and then took out a hand masher and mashed the broccoli up so there were very few large pieces. I was going a little more for a cream of broccoli, and I didn't use a ton of chicken either. 

Probably the best and most well received soup I have ever made, and I have made a lot. Really, really creamy and delicious.

Really easy but did follow others advice of making the flour/chicken broth paste before adding other ingredients.  Very simple and delicious especially after a long day.   You could really add lots of different veggies.  I didn't think it lacked flavor at all.   
thanks

Very good recipe!  Kids loved it, too.  Five star-taste; 4 star directions. 

Really, the directions should probably instruct you to make the roux: gradually add the stock (soup base much better than boullion cubes) whisking constantly to remove lumps; then add other ingredients. Easy and delicious.  I suspect that using the roux as written would give you problems with lumps. 

Love the addition of chicken to broccoli soup!  I decreased the cheese a bit and still wonderful.

I added a few more spices (a bit of garlic and onion powders and some parsley) and I added a touch more of the bouillon to the water (which i boiled the chicken in.) As far as the cheese, I used about a 1 inch chunk of velveeta instead. THIS SOUP WAS AMAZING WITH MY CHANGES! My family ate it up!

I did read a few reviews saying this was bland and I agree.  I added a few spices and extra shredded cheese and it wasn't too exciting.   I can see this being something kids would enjoy.  

The one thing I wish I would have done was throw the cooked broccoli and chicken into the food proccessor.  I think that would have went better in the soup than bite-sized chunks.  

Also, I even added some corn starch and it just wasn't thickening.  I spent a lot of time stirring the butter, flour, and liquids and nothing was really working.

Really good, but I agree with other reviewers, just make your rue, add broth with wisk, then add broccoli and other ingredients.  I also added a pinch of cayane, a dash of dry mustard and garlic powerder.  Turned out awesome.

This was a good base, but like others I preferred to use chicken stock and to add onion & garlic in the roux.  I added the stock directly into the roux (You really only need the one pot!) after the flour had cooked and after stirred until smooth, all the other ingredients saving the cream for last to desired thickness.  I added a jar of pimentos, a teas. of fresh shaved nutmeg, and fresh chopped parsley at the end which always gives cream soups a bit more flavor & color.  This recipe on it's own would have been way to bland for us.  But again, a good base.  Thanks for sharing!

This was good.  I made per recipe but though it was a little thin.  I would use less broth next time and a bit of garlic and onion for additional flavor.

I think this soup would be better with beer added into it, and without the chicken. Otherwise, this was a great dish!

Satisfying, thick soup.  Like many other reviewers, I added broth to roux then continued with the recipes.  I used a little less butter than called for and subbed 1% milk for cream.  Frozen leftovers reheated well.

I tried this recipe last night and it was very, very good. I read some of the reviews and followed a little bit of all of them. I made the rue and then slowly poured into the pot 6 cups of chicken stock from a box and 5 cups of water. I also added 8 ounces of Velveeta and an extra cup of shredded mild cheddar. The next time I make it I will add a pinch of garlic. I was told this was better than Panera Bread's Broccoli and cheese and better than Carrabba's. My girlfriend told me this recipe surely goes into my recipe book!

I thought this soup would come out creamier.  Maybe a did a mistake but I followed the instructions step by step.  THe part where you need to mix the melted butter ad flour didnt come out the way it should have.  It came out in chunks.  Next time I would not use the flour and butter.  My parents loved the taste of the soup.  My sister who is a picky eater liked it too except for the flour ad butter.  And as per me I foud it ok.  Would prefer to try different soup next time.

On a cold, rainy winter day, this recipe hit the spot. It was easy to make and it tasted great. The only thing I did which differed slightly from the recipe is that when I made the roux, I let it brown for a while, so the flour/butter mixture was chocolate brown. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.

I followed Linda McCleans directions.  I also used 1/4 cup butter instead of 1/2 cup and 2 chicken breasts instead of two pounds chicken breast.  I added 8 cups water instead of 11 cups and used chicken base.   Delish!

This soup was amazing!!  I added a couple extra cups of cheese, and then it was perfect for my taste.  Also, after chopping the florets off the heads of broccoli, I added the remaining stems in to the soup whole.  After they were cooked, I took the stems out, pureed them, and added them back to the soup.  Very delicious.

Very good!  Big hit with the whole family.  I cut the recipe in half, but still used 3 boullion cubes.  I also sauteed onion and garlic in the butter before adding the flour.  Delicious!

Definetly need to add onion and garlic. Also, next time I will add broccoli half way through cooking. It got to broken up and I like big bits of it. Also ended up adding more cheese.
Definetly a good base.

My husband loves this cheesy, creamy soup, with the added bulk of chicken.  I added cayenne pepper, though, because it seemed a little bland to to me at first and needed a kick.  I think that's the way it's supposed to taste, though;  like a thick, cheesy soup.  I also doubled the broccoli, and I'm glad I did.

Very good, made the recipe the same with the exception of adding an extra bunch of brocolli, 1 more cup of water, and one more chicken cube.  Very tasty this way but I believe it would be better with the addition of onions and garlic as others have suggested.

This turned out really good. I added a half of a large, white onion when the broccoli was added. And also used canned chicken. When it was time to add the paste, I mixed some of the watery soup to the paste to smooth it out. I think that was the key for no lumps. I had tons of leftovers too and they were great the next day. Everybody who I shared with, raved!

I personally did not enjoy the taste of this recipe at all. But everyone I made it for loved it and my husband did as well! THey would not stop ranting about it. I also made bread bowls out of buns and it was a huge hit. Very easy to make. I reccommend it to those that love broccoli & Cheese.

Delicious and easily adaptable to suit your personal taste.  I use chicken broth rather than water with bouillon and also add diced carrots, onions, garlic and thyme.  Serve with rolls or half a sandwich or salad and you've got a delicious lunch or light dinner!  Especially wonderful on a rainy, cold or "sick" day.

This was good, but not near creamy enough. Perhaps it was my own fault because I didn't use cream but a mixture of milk and butter. It had a good taste though.

DELICIOUS! We didn't care too much for the chicken chunks. I would make it exactly the same next time but without the chicken. We also added a little extra cheese (yum!). Very tasty, fairly easy to make. Long cooking time, but worth it!

Our 17 year old daughter loved this one in a big way.  We thought it could be a little cheesier, but man is it tasty!

This is very good, I add extra cheese at the end.  I also tried to make it in my slow cooker once but the cheese never quite melted.

This was GREAT I made it without the chicken and blended it smooth after cooking.. I just wish it turned out a tad bit thicker.... Fantastic taste!

This is so good. I made it just like it says. Except for 3 servings. Very very good. I think I may try it without the chicken, just a broccoli cheese soup.

This was very tasty, but I'll probably make it without the chicken next time.  I think bacon would be more of the flavor I'm looking for.

This was amazing and even better the second day.  The only problem I had was with the roux was a bit thick.  I might use less flour next time.  Overall, great!

This soup is delicious!! So hearty and filling for these cold winter nights. I used a bit less cheese and only had vegetable stock on hand but it still came out wonderful. Of course i added lots of garlic which i can't seem to do without. I will make this time and time again.

This is a great recipe.  Being from South Louisiana, it goes against my religion to not add at least some diced onions to the mix.  I sauteed them in the butter before I added the flour to make a roux.  Also, as I am a spaz when it comes to thickening with flour (I usually use cornstarch,, it doesn't lump)I drained the chicken and broccoli into a colander, then added the roux to the broth and used my handy hand held blender to keep it all from lumping.  I then added the cream and cheese, and added the chicken and broccoli back when the soup part was all done.  It worked like a charm.  Also, I added Tony Chachere's, substituting 12 tsp. for the salt in the recipe.  My kids licked their bowls and they don't like broccoli.  A definate keeper!

This was a good, hearty soup.  It didn't have as much cheese flavor as I thought it would, but the texture was good, as was the broccoli/chicken flavor.  It definitely can be altered to suit your tastes, though. Great for a cold day!

Not as good as I anticipated.  The flour/butter paste was more like flour/butter course crumbs.  The soup didn't thicken very well at all.  I didn't like the chicken in the soup.  Prep time was more like 25min not 10min.  Definitely not something to cook during the week.  Bottom line - there are better recipes that take less time.  Sorry.

I thought the soup tasted good - but for all the trouble to prepare it - I could have opened a can of that cream of something....I was disappointed at how the nice broccoli florets disinegrated while I was trying to dissolve the rue. The constant stirring, though gentle, made the broccoli disappear. Probably won't make again.

Incredible soup!  I used homemade stock and the food processor to finely chop the chicken & broccoli, since I don't like big chunks in my soup.

This sounds like the delicious soup served at a famous seafood restaurant chain. I'm definitely going to try this one.
