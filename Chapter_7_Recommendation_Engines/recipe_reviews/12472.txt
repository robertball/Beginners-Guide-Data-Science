I like this recipe, I used the original one and it was very difficult to make so I really like the changes and how there is a better explination on the steps.

I do a lot of baking and found this recipe tricky to make.  I don't mind time consuming recipes but found it really lacked taste.  Tasted like whip cream and rum pie. Will not make again

You are definitely right about this being an old recipe! Found it in a magazine in November 1975! Have been making this for many years. Pecan crust can be difficult to form, but well worth the extra effort.
