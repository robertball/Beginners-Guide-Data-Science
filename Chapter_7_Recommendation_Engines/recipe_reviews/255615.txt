Way too many potatoes on the recipe for me. I substituted vegetarian mean for the sausage, doubles the mushrooms and tripled the spinach.

We loved this recipe but I had to make some changes out of necessity. I had some hash browns I needed to use up so I browned them a bit with some seasoning salt instead of using the potatoes. I only had 6 eggs instead of 8 and wouldn’t hesitate to do that number again. I wanted to add red peppers in the sausage mixture with the onions to add more veggies. I also didn’t have sour cream so I decided to add mayonnaise instead. This recipe didn’t disappoint. I think it would have been delicious even without the changes I made and it shows how versatile the recipe is. This is going into my favourite breakfast casseroles even though we had it for supper.
