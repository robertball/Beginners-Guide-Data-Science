made these.  I used vanilla and a touch of stevia in the raw.  I had no liquid sweetner.  Turned out good.  Then I used the stevia in the raw and butter with cocoa for topping.  It was too thick to drizzle, so I spread it over.  Got to have the chocolate on top!  Makes a great go to when you are craving a sweet snack

I didn’t have the specific sweetener and used powdered Stevia. Next time I will use the recommended sweetener. It’s not Reese’s, but it’s not bad. Easy to make and I will definitely be experimenting to improve the taste.

Overall it is a little bland. The chocolate sauce turned out better than expected though. I think chopped peanuts would be an improvement and I will add if I make this recipe again.
