This is very similar to a Dutch Baby which my son loves!
I reduced the butter to 1/4 cup and the salt to 1/4 tsp, I added a tsp of vanilla and 1/4 tsp nutmeg.
Mine started to brown a bit too much at 23 minutes, so keep a watch on it!
I served with jam and a sprinkling of icing sugar, my son and I ate the whole thing, thanks for a tasty recipe.
I made this recipe for the Allrecipe Allstars Canada April challenge #ARFaceless
