This is a great base, but I found it bland as is. Other than caramelizing red onions in coconut oil while the quinoa was cooking, I followed the recipe exactly, but after tasting it I increased the cardamom (I used 1/2 tsp ground; 1 pod = 1/6 tsp), added salt and 1/2 tsp garam masala, and added raisins. The raisins really gave the dish a needed punch. Once these changes were made, it was delicious!

most certainly is a great way to combine veggies with a natural protein-rich grain. Needs more spices unless you're serving small young ones.

Great and easy recipe. I used vegetable broth instead of water and add 3/4 cup of raisin. it adds a bit a sweet and flavour to it

This is an amazing way to eat quinoa.  I am trying to get more healthy quinoa in my diet but get tired of the simple quinoa-onion-beans combo or the add-it-to-soup.  This is a super delicious, novel way to eat it!  My fiance is from Bolivia, the land of of quinoa, and he loved it and said he had never had quinoa made this way before.  I also added more spice and plenty of salt, as other readers commented, and I just used the vegetables I had on hand: corn instead peas, butternut squash cubed instead of broccoli or cauliflower, and it was great!

I happen to love the indian basmati rice version of biryani but this recipe was SO BLAND! Very dissappointing. I've had quinoa in salads and love it but I didn't feel that it's a good base for a biryani. I don't think I'll be making this again.

I found it bland.  I thought it was because it was my first time using cardamom and I didn't really know how to use it, but reading other reviews reassure me. I might try it again if somebody has a great suggestion for tweaking it.  I was so excited about eating a good biryani that night...:-(

I also found it bland and certainly would not put potato in it again as that didn't seem to match and was just another bland addition.  I added craisins as I didn`t have raisins and that was slightly better but I would not make this again.

The flavors just weren't strong enough.  The more we ate the more the flavor grew, but it was pretty weak.  I'd be tempted to add some other flavor, but I'm not sure what.  Also, my potato dice may not have been small enough, but they didn't have enough time to cook before the water was gone.

I loved this! Great way to make a flavorful quinoa as a change of pace from rice. To give it a bit more flavor, simply trade out the water for vegetable broth.

Not worth the time and hassle.  It was on the bland side with a slightly bitter aftertaste.

Beautiful colors, great mix of textures- looked really good but the taste fell short- pretty bland as others said. I wanted to make it the way it was written since I don't know much about these spices or what to do to enhance. Might try it again...

This turned out really nicely. I used t bone steak rubbed in turmeric and salt and pepper in with the onions and dumped it all in the mix.

It needs more flavor as it tasted quite bland. Needs a bit of salt.

We loved it! Sadly, I had no cardamom, but substituted coriander. I can't wait to try the original version!
