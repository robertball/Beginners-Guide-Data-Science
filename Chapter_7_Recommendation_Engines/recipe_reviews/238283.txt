No. It was delicious! Thank you for sharing this juice. I drank it while I was breastfeeding my children and it really give a boost, in providing milk for them. I recommend it to everyone that is doing the same, after giving birth.

Very, very delicious. If you don't like things sweet, definitely add less sugar. I used 3/4 the amount written and would lessen it further the next time. Also, I believe this would work with agave or honey just the same. The leftover pulp is a plus to use for other recipes. Thank you for the recipe.
