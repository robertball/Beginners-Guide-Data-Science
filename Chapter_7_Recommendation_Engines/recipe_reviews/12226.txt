I made some modifications to this pie, and it turned out great. Instead of a double crust, I made a crumb topping out of cinnamon, brown sugar, flour and chopped pecans; I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup of white and about 2 or 3 tablespoons of brown, and I added half a jar of Smucker's ice cream topping caramel. The pie was perfect at 45 minutes in the oven, and it tasted SO GOOD. Half of it's gone already and it's still hot...will be a keeper.

I've been playing around with creating my own caramel apple pie recipe for a few years and this is the one I started with. Originally mine were also to runny inside. I used some tips from another website about pies and did the following: Subsitute the constarch for 2 Tbsp Tapioca (ground) - the tips said to use Tapioca flour or granulated tapioca but we live in a small town and can't find either, so I bought the tapioca in a box and ground it to near flour in my food processor. The tip didn't say how much to add but the Tapioca box said to use  2Tbs for a fruit pie. 

Also, I sprinkled the bottom crust with cinnamon sugar (this is supposed to make the bottom crust crispier) and also sprinkled the bottom crust with 2Tbs ground oats to help absorb any excess moisture. 

I used 5-6 granny smith apples with this method and it's not too runny at all. Very nice actually. Now, my problem is that I tried using the individually wrapped caramels (to help eliminated having so much liquid in the pie). Do Not use individually wrapped caramels... the are way to chewing and don't spread out or melt like I had hoped they would. 

Also, I used a crumb topping  made from flour, butter, brown sugar and pecans which goes very good with this pie. 

On my next effort I'm going to try "Grandma's Secret Pie Crust" recipe from this site and either make homemade caramel or try to find a thicker version in the jar. 

Happy Baking!!

I have made this pie at least 6 times now. I made it to a tee. Of course when baking it I have to have something underneath it or else the caramel oozes out every where. My solution to this problem is just putting caramel on the bottom of the pie instead of the top. This is my families favorite pie!

This is the BEST apple pie! My family loved it & it will definately be a family-favorite from here on out! I did alter it a bit. I added an extra 1/4 cup of carmel topping & an extra 1/4 cup of pecans. In addition, I melted my own carmel from classic carmel candies. I also covered the edges of the pie crust with foil after the first 15 minutes in the oven to avoid burned crust edges. It was PERFECT!!

This is a great pie! It will be hard to make another type of apple pie after making this one. I made this for a pie contest and won second place with it. I have made this pie 4 times now. After making the first two, I modified the recipe slightly to help. I used 7 c. Honey Crisp apples and added an extra Tbsp of cornstarch (it was a little runny the first two times I made it). Make sure to brush on an egg wash on the top of the pie and it will get a wonderful maghogany color. I sprinkle with a large grain decorating sugar before baking too. Cover the tops with aluminum after about 15-20 minutes and then uncover for the last 15 minutes of baking. The last two were sold by the slice at a Craft Bazaar and people loved it and wanted the recipe. Thanks for such a great recipe!

After reading the above reviews, I made this recipe with a few changes.  Instead of the sugar I just used an entire 16 oz jar of Smucker's Caramel topping and a 4 oz bag of chopped pecans instead of 1/4 cup.  Instead of the 3 tablespoons of corn starch I used about 8.  The pie was STILL runny when cut still warm, however, when it cooled to room temperature it was perfect.  The family loved the pie.  I didn't use really tart apples, but the pie would have been too sweet if I had put ANY of the sugar and I like things really sweet~  **Just in case you want your pie warm, you can just dip a little of the sauce that runs out of the pie out and ladel it over the warm pie before adding a scoop of ice cream or whipped topping.

The pie itself was very good but really runny. I used Granny Smith apples and I think they were too moist. Plus I will use corn starch next time instead of flour. I also scaled down the sugar amounts and used fat free caramel topping. I will try it again but might alter it a bit again.

This would have been a good recipe if I had known which apples to use.  When cut open, the pie was filled with water which I later found out was caused by the type of apples I used.  I may try this again with different apples.

I JUST made this pie tonight as a test for Thanksgiving and for a bake sale at my church. My mother loves the test pie I made. However, a few modifications were made after reading the reviews....I used the recepie for apple pie off of the pillsbury pie crust box which includes salt. The salt helps with the too sweet taste that some reviewers complained about. I also found that spooning the apples into the pie crust as opposed to pouring the mixture in helps cut down on the runniness of the pie. Spooning the mixture into the crust allows you to control the amount of juice that goes in. I left some juice in the bowl (approx 2 tblsp) and the consistency was perfect. We cut the test pie while it was still smoking and it wasn't runny at all. I also added walnuts after putting the carmel over the apples and mixed about 2 tblsp of caramel in my apple mixture before spooning it in the crust (I used hot caramel topping by smuckers). I also only used 1/2 of a 12oz jar of caramel per pie. After baking, I brused the crust with butter and sprinkled a little bit of sugar on top and then drizzled caramel over the top crust. Now I just have to perfect my skills regarding sealing the crust together!!!!

I won 1st place at the apple pie bake-off using this recipe, with just a few minor alterations.  I followed the advice to increase the cornstarch.  I also increased the cinnamon to 1tsp, and used cajeta, which is a mexican caramel and a little richer tasting.  Otherwise, I followed the directions and it came out fantastic.  Everyone raved and I beat out the other pies by over 100 points.

I've made this pie twice. The first time it was really runny but I learned a lesson. Instead of pouring the apple mix into the pie crust, spoon it in. The second time I made it, it was perfect. My whole family ate it up in one night!!

Very good recipe.  I increased the apples by a cup, increased the cornstarch to 4 tbs. and increased the caramel to 3/4 cup.  This made the consistency perfect.  Also, I left out the pecans.  This pie would be great with a crumb topping (with a little more caramel drizzled on top - Perkins style), but since I didn't have the foresight to get the ingredients, I topped it with crust, put on an egg wash and then sprinkled the top with raw sugar.  Very good results.  My family is already begging me for another!

Amazing pie.  I used a little of everyones suggestions, and would only try one different thing next time.  Here's what I did: 

Used a variety of apples, including Pink Lady, Honeycrisp, McIntosh and Cortland.  The combination of sweetness/tart and crisp/softer was excellent.  I then made Grandma's Secret Pie Crust from this site, and sprinkled the brown sugar/cinnamon on bottom, followed by the ground oatmeal.  (A suggestion to keep the bottom crust from getting soggy).  I then spread caramel apple dip over that, and filled with the apple mixture - spooning in so I didnt have too much juice... made a lattice crust and baked.

The pie was gone that day.  I had worried about the caramel oozing out of the lattice, but that didnt happen at all (so the lattice was gorgeous) but the caramel didnt melt into the apples at all, rather stayed at the bottom completely.  Next time, I think I will either spoon a little of the juice in, or put the caramel on top, and not worry about the lattice.  Either way, it was much better microwaved at the end of the day, to warm up the caramel.

Delicious pie.  Thanks so much for the recipe, and reviewer advice!  Thanksgiving tradition from now on!

The pie turned out wonderfully!  Here are the modifications I made: I squeezed half a lime over the peeled apples to keep them from browning. As suggested by another member, I used caramel dip instead of caramel topping and spread it on the bottom of the pie crust. I used 2/3 cup sugar instead of ¾ cup. I used ¾ t. all-spice instead of cinnamon. I used walnuts instead of pecans. I added ½ t. cardamom powder. About half way through baking, I put foil over the top because it was rapidly browning. Fifteen minutes before it was done, I removed foil and just placed it on the crust.  A delicious pie that I'll definitely make again!!

I couldn't really taste the caramel so this was more of a plain apple pie, but it was still really good. I made my own caramel sauce by bringing a 1/4 cup of brown sugar, 2 tablespoons of half and half, 2 tablespoon of butter, a pinch of salt, and a dash of vanilla to a boil. In the apple filling I cut down the sugar to a 1/2 cup and used 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice instead of the 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to give the pie a stonger spice flavor. I didn't use the pecans and I brushed the top crust with milk before putting it in the oven. I did find the pie a little on the runny side and it made the bottom crust really soggy, so next time I would add 1 more tablespoon of cornstarch. Thanks for the great recipe!

Great pie, I increased the cornstarch to 4T and used 1/4 white sugar and 3T of brown sugar and about 3/4 cup caramel ice cream topping.  Because the husband doesn't like nuts, those got left out.  Wonderful warm with a cold glass of milk.

Wow. First of all, let me start by saying that i do not like fruit pies or cobbler...something about the idea of cooked fruit makes my skin crawl.  Buuuuuuut, I figured that it wouldn't hurt to have an apple pie recipe under my belt just in case.  I stumbled across this recipe and thought I'd give it a go; am I glad I did! It was excellent, even to a non-apple-pie-eater like myself.  I made it last Saturday, took it to my grandmother's house Sunday, and by Monday it no longer existed. I made very few, minimal changes: in addition to the white sugar, I added 3 TBS of brown.  I put more caramel than the recipe called for, and next time I will put even more (I love caramel!). Based on other reviews, I added a couple of extra tablespoons of cornstarch, especially because my caramel was runny.  I waited until it was cooled to cut it and the consistency was perfect. The pecans were also a great touch! All in all, a fantastic recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I needed to use up some red delicious apples that were about to go soft. I wasn't sure how this would turn out since the apples were already mealy, but cooking them in this pie totally salvaged them.  Somehow in the pie they seemed crisp.  I only had about half the quantity of needed apples so it turned out like a tart but with the nuts and the drizzle of caramel, that worked out just fine as an alternative to a heaping apple pie. I used walnuts in place of pecans because that is what I had on hand.  I thought the pie was a perfect balance between sweet and spice.

Left out the nuts, did everything else as stated in the recipe.  Super sweet, but pretty good with ice cream on top.  Yummy!  Looked, smelled, and tasted great.  Had to make more the next day!

I used golden delicious apples so we cut back on the sugar. I also used flour instead of the cornstarch and added some nutmeg. Everyone loved eat. Just like eating a caramel apple but a whole lot easier. Next time we want to make sure we have some ice cream. Yummy!

This is one of the most delicious apple pies I've ever made!  I used gala apples!  I had to leave out the pecans (my mom has dentures....), but it was still GREAT!

It was So Good, but not I am going to die becouse I found the best pie in the world good. It did get a bit runny, but the flavor was great. I took the advice of other people's comments and put on a crumb topping.

The only reason I didn't give this one a 5 is because it turned out a little on the soupy side.  The overall taste was amazing.  I did add a little more cinnamon than called for and about a tsp or so of all spice.  We topped it with a scoop of french vanilla ice cream and it was really tasty.

This was the first apple pie I have ever made and it was so easy!  People couldn't believe that I made it myself. I used Marzetti's caramel apple dip and cashews.  I will be making this pie again!

Very tasty.  Used walnuts instead of pecans and half Golden Delicious, half Granny Smith.   Next time I'll do a different crust -- I used Pillsbury refrigerated crusts and they just weren't very good.

This was my first attempt at an apple pie, and it was pretty good.  I also didn't check ahead, and assumed granny smiths were the apple of choice.  I ended up with a runny pie that tasted fabulous.  I made my own caramel sauce from a recipe on the back of a corn syrup bottle - delish!  Everyone at Thanksgiving enjoyed the pie.  Thanks for the recipe!

This pie was 'ok'... I actualy made it for tomorrow's feast but the presentation was not what I had hoped so I snuck a piece. First of all, the caramel leaked out of the pie plate and onto the top and bottom of the pie, not enough to make a huge mess, but enough to ruin the presentation for me. Second, tastewise, it was very, very sweet. I had to grab a glass of milk to finish my slice. This was my 'new' recipe to try this year for Thanksgiving, thanks for letting me try. I probably will not make it again, though.

I was asked to take a dessert to a potluck dinner at a friend's house.  This sounded so good, so I decided to make this pie with a lattice top crust.  It was still warm as we cut it after dinner with ice cream. MMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!  The pie did not last long at the party.

Turned out great. Used 1/4 cup white sugar, 3 tablespoons brown sugar,
4 tablespoons cornstarch. Used 5 sm-med granny smith apples and 1 honey crisp, and a refrigerated pie crust. Baked for about 55 minutes the night before. Had it for dessert on Turkey day and everyone loved it!

This recipe is so delicious! Best tasting apple pie, my husband loved it. I spread melted butter and brown sugar on the crust about 15 minutes before taking the pie out of the oven. It added an extra bit of sweetness.

I tried this as something new for my son on his birthday. He loves apples. It was a huge hit! Friends started asking me for this for their birthdays too! I followed the recipe except I used more caramel topping. My choice of apples were Golden Delicious and Fuji. It came out sweet and the apples weren't mushy. I will definitely be making this one again. Thank you.

I wish I had read the reviews before baking this pie.   It was runny.   I should of added more cornstarch and maybe less carmel.  But then,  it would not have the carmel flavor.

Fabulous!  Wonderfully sweet and tasty.  The filling has a great texture.  I think the corn starch works much better than flour as a thickening agent.  I subbed 1/4 c of the white sugar for brown sugar and used homemade caramel instead of ice cream topping.  I used my grandmother's recipe for pie crust.  This pie was to die for!

This pie was delicious! I liked the idea of using caramel instead of butter or margarine for the sauce.  It gives it a sweeter taste instead of a butter taste.  My husband said this was the best apple pie that he ever had.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used a pre-set frozen pie shell, which was not a deep dish, and flopped another pre-set pie shell on top once it had thawed out. Since the bottom shell was only for regular sized pie dishes, I cut down the amount of apple slices needed. I did make the pie slightly heaping with apples and put a slightly reduced amount of caramel topping over the top. Even wit the size modifications this pied turned out wonderfully. This may have even been the reason why I did not have the issues with "wateriness" as some other reviewers experienced. Who knows... but now I am a little reluctant to try it deep dish style. It was very yummy and my husband keeps insisting that I need to make another one.:)

This pie was awesome!!  The whole family loved it at Thanksgiving.  It only took about 10 minutes to put all together and stick it in the oven.  So simple!

This was a huge hit last Thanksgiving when I made it. I followed the instructions of a friend and used Granny Smith apples, but I would just use red ones next time because the cook time needs to be increased dramatically if you use them. My only complaint is that I hate when recipes state an amount of cups (for the apples) without an estimated amount of apples that are required. As an inexperienced baker, I didn't know how many to buy.

I have made this several times now and my kids always request it! The only things I have changed are I use 4 Tablespoons of cornstarch, I also sprinkle a little cinnamon and sugar on the bottom crust before adding the filling. If using the double crust I brush the top with egg white and sprinkle decorative white sugar on top.

this is fabulous!! i had a recipe i used several years ago in an old cookbook given to me as a gift. i moved a couple of times since i received it and it somehow got lost. i search all over the internet for that "perfect" caramel apple pie recipe and i have found it!! 

i made only a couple of modifications - i used a pillsbury ready crust that i could easily use for smaller pie pans. i did as some had suggested and i used the caramel dip instead of the caramel sauce. needless to say, for my 2nd time ever baking a pie, i was very pleased and my husband was even happier.

thank you for the submission - i will be making this often :)

Delicious!!! I used a bunch of different kinds of apples (because I was making applesauce and apple butter). I used an extra tablespoon of cornstarch and didn't measure the carmel or nuts, just sprinkled. I also used store bought crust (a little salty). It was so good. My family gobbled it up. It was a little juicy, but delicious juice!!! I will make this again for sure.
