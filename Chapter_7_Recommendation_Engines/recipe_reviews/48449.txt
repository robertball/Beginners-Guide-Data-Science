My husband and I really liked this recipe.  I followed the advice of other posters and drained the majority of the liquid from the beans, as we like thicker chili.  Also, I sauteed the onion, celery, pepper, and garlic in butter with a bit of chipotle chili powder before adding  to the slow cooker.  I will definitely make this again!

I had success with this recipe, with a few small changes from reading reviews.  I did NOT add celery.  I also drained 2 cans of beans and left one undrained.  I used one can of tomato puree and one can of diced tomatoes.  I bumped up the seasonings by using 1.5 T of chili powder, extra garlic, and almost 1 tsp of tabasco.  The chili came out great and my husband described the flavor as "earthy."  He liked it.

I love this recipe!  I have made it twice now and the only thing I did different was add more of the veggies and used a little cheyenne pepper to give it more of kick (but not too much).  I ended up making it with pinto beans the second time around instead of kidney beans (I live in CO and during the blizzards the grocery stores were a little low on items) and it tasted great once again.

I am not a huge fan of chili, but my husband has been asking for it, so we tried this one.  I am not a huge exact measurment person, so I threw in the beef, approximate amounts of onion, celery and green pepper.  I drained all but 1 can of beans (I used dark red, light red and white kidney beans.)  I used 1 can of puree and 1 can of diced tomatoes with green chilis.  I used the recommended seasonings, approximately, but used tobasco instead of the chili sauce that I didn't have.  I cooked for 6 hours on high.  This was really hearty with the right ammount of sauce.  We stirred in sour cream and cheddar cheese and topped with cheddar french fried onions (way to load up the calories, but boy was it good!!!)

Was looking for a recipe that was similar to one I used to use but lost.  This was it and it was great.  If you like it spicy, you will need to up the spices.  I also added some cumin and swapped out the tomato puree for tomato chunks.  Everyone loved it!

I thought this recipe was lousy. Where's the taste and spice to it? I'm tempted to pitch it but I think I can salvage it with a whole lot more spices than what's called for in the recipe. It tastes like tomato period! I will not be making this recipe again.

This was awsome and so delicious. I used ground chicken rather than beef and found there was no difference in taste. The ground chicken was usefull in reducing the cholesterol levels in this meal. I will keep this recepie in the faves.

Good simple recipe.  Made a few tweaks on second batch:  - 1 lb LEAN (93%) ground beef, browned and did not drain fat (it's very little and adds flavor) - 2 cans red kidney beans, 1 light and 1 dark, (drained and rinsed because they are packed in corn syrup--sugar) - 1 can black beans (with liquid) instead of cannelloni  - Two packets taco seasoning instead of chili powder - 2 cans diced tomatoes w/ green chilies instead of puree - 2 teaspoons dried Italian seasoning instead of the individual herbs.  - 3 cloves garlic, minced, instead of 2 - 2 medium jalapeno peppers, cleaned and seeded, chopped - 1 cup beef broth

Used ground turkey instead of beef. Everyone who ate it loved it. I also used quite a bit more veggies. Served it over elbow noodles!
Yummy for winter time!

This is a great recipe for families with different taste buds.  I fed my family of six this recipe Superbowl Sunday and what I liked about it was that it wasn't too hot for the young or older ones and for us in the middle we were able to heat it up to our liking.  I served it up with some garlic bread and the meal was complete.  I only added four cans of beans - three red kidney and one black bean. I don't think the recipe suffered from the lack of the other two cans. Has anyone made this recipe and added cornstarch to thicken it up?  I didn't find it overly thin, but debated with my sister whether or not to add the cornstarch.  In the end we left it as is.

Very good recipe. Every once in a while I see someone post that you should not rate a recipe that you made changes to, and I understand that view but I also think that many of us enjoy reading through the changes/variations to get other ideas. I think I will send the idea along to allrecipes.com that we should have 2 ways to rate a recipe - "followed recipe exact" and "changes made" or something like that. Then everyone will be happy, well...not everyone. Anyways, on with my review - this chili came out great, and yes I made some changes. I did not add celery as I'm not a big fan. I used Canellini, Pinto and Black Beans and added a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles. I was concerned as another reviewer posted that the base might be too "tomatoee" but it had fantastic flavor. Thank you for a great chili recipe!

Excellent recipe!  Received many compliments.  I doubled the recipe for an office "pig out."  Used 2.5-3 lbs beef (browned the meat with the spices and half the veggies), 2-3 onions, 2-3 peppers (red and green), 6 stalks of celery (optional), 6 cloves garlic (jarred), 4 cans crushed or diced tomatoes, 4 cans kidney beans (drain 2-3 cans), and all the spices mentioned.  4 hours on high or 8 hours on low.  Went easy with the hot stuff since some don't like, but placed hot sauce, red pepper flakes, and chili powder on the side when serving.  Also served with grated cheddar cheese and french bread.  Enjoy!

Excellent flavor after I modified it a little. Used 2lb chili meat from the butcher.  Bumped up the amounts of basil, oregano, salt, pepper, and parsley. Added 1/2 teaspoon cumin. Drained and rinsed all beans (I think this helps cut down on gas!).  Used 1 can diced tomatoes with green chilis and one can tomato sauce (not spaghetti sauce). Added 7oz can of green chilis.  Cooked on high for 6 hours.  Hubby thought it was wonderful; and he's a tough critic!

This was delicious!  My whole family loved it, I followed the recipe with just a few exceptions... instead of adding the liquid from the beans, I drained off; added 2 14-oz cans of diced tomatoes (with liquid), just 1 can of puree, and a 12-oz can of beer.  Then I doubled all the seasonings, just because we like it very flavorful.  Definitely a keeper!

We ate this for an entire week as a side dish. We swapped the ground beef for ground turkey, and cannellini beans for black ones. I cooked it on high for 4 hours (instead of low for 8 hours).

Best chili ever....with modifications to bring a little more heat!  I added a can of Rotel in place of tomatoes, trippled the chili powder, subtracted the celery (celery in chili...really?), and mixed in a teaspoon of brown sugar.  This recipie will win awards!  Amazing!

Slow Cooker Chili II Haiku: "Well, it was easy. I wouldn't make it again, without some changes." Prepped this b4 work in the morning (bonus for quick and easy) and dumped it in the crockpot. Came home and my first thought at the aroma was, "did I make spaghetti sauce?" b/c it didn't smell like chili at all. More points for my pre-schooler eating her whole bowl, but that's b/c it was bland as bland can be - overly tomato-ey and lacking in that punch that makes chili, well, chili. Husband and I could only eat our's doused in Sriracha, cilantro, and cheese. If I make this again, I'd seriously increase the seasonings, drop the celery, and swap tomato puree for diced tomatoes w/ chilis.

I was at home while this was cooking so I got to try it occasionally and added stuff as need, it is a great base recipe that you can customize to your own palette.  My additions were 1 additional tbsp of cumin, 3X the Chili powder, 1 tsp white vinegar, 1/2 tsp sugar, 1/2 tsp brown sugar, 1 tbsp Schlotszky's hot sauce, 1/2 cup fresh chopped tomatoes,2 cans tomato sauce(accidentally only picked up one can of puree at the store) and 2tsp unsweetened chocolate.  And it tastes wonderful:)

Not bad. Seemed to be missing the tomato flavor and was a bit dry so we added a 28oz can of crushed tomatoes. Probably should have added more chili powder too but will need to next time.

Made almost exactly as written except:

Sauted onions, pepper, celery and garlic before browning beef.

Used crushed tomatoes (Aldi brand) rather than puree.

Drained both cans of kidney beans.

Doubled the chili powder.

Still came out a little on the mild side, but very nice thick texture.  I liked all the veggies, husband was a bit iffy about the celery.  Was much thicker when left overs were reheated, almost dip consistency.

This is a very good starting base for chili. I ended up using more chili powder than was asked for, and instead of cooking the meat solo, I sauteed the onions / garlic, then cooked the beef, draining the fat when it was 1/2 done. I added the spices and finished cooking it. I then threw it all in the cooker, using diced tomatoes and some tomato paste, and mushrooms. I added some more chili and a bit of cayenne, plus a habenero sauce that I have home made from a family member, and finished it off with a couple of bay leaves.  Really good outcome. Usually have it with shredded cheese all mixed in

I loved this recipe but it's a litle bland on it's own. I added extra veggies, more chilli powder, red chilli flakes, can of green chiles, paprika and lots more salt. It was fantastic.

I had never made chili before, and my husband wanted chili just like his mom's. I did make a few changes, but I think this recipe is GREAT! I used one can of tomat sauce and one of diced tomatoes with green chilis instead of the two cans of puree, two cans of kidney beans (only one with liquid) and a can of black beans, drained. Other than that I followed everything as the recipe stated, cooked on low for about 8 hours, and my husband LOVED it! He said it tasted "just like mom's", and it was super easy! I will definitely make this again.

I had great success with this recipe as an informal dinner at an evening meeting I hosted at my house.  I love all the different flavors.  Instead of celery I used celery flakes, and the flavor was still good.  Next time I think I will add corn to the slow cooker during the last hour of cooking

This chili was excellent with a few preference changes.  I added the kidney beans, but not the other type.  I added two cans of diced tomatoes instead of tomato puree. Along with the ground beef, I added one cup of mild Italian sausage crumbled. Great recipe!

This is a great, quick chili (when you know you won't have time in the evening to make dinner).  There are definitely more interesting, or complex chili's out there but this is very FAMILY-FRIENDLY.  Top w/ sour cream, cheese, & onions & don't forget the cornbread! Use left over for burritos.

very good, very hearty. I didn't even think of putting shredded cheese or sour cream on this, the flavor was so good! Only thing I did different was use chili beans, instead of kidney beans. It's called Chili, not Kidney, for a reason.

Enjoyed this very much. I used one can of mixed beans and one can of black beans because that is what I had. I used a large can of diced tomatoes and one 5 oz can of tomato paste instead of the two cans of tomato puree. I rinsed my beans before adding them because I heard others say that it was soupy and I prefer a thicker chili.

Added more garlic cloves and garlic powder. Used kidney and pinto beans drained and rinsed. Also added  a tablespoon of Cumin for flavor without adding more heat. We like to serve over rice and top with sour cream, scallions and fresh lime juice.

This was a good base and I always add celery to my chili. To me, the best tasting chili I have ever had comes from the basic 'Carroll Shelby" chili makins packet  found in most grocery stores. All it is is a bag of seasoning and some other stuff but great seasoning. I brown 2 lbs   ground beef with chopped onions, garlic, celery and green bell pepper. Drain and reserve. Add two cans pintos, two cans tomatoes (undrained), 8 oz of tomato sauce and a 15 oz can of black olives, drained and sliced. Add the masa flour from the Shelby spice packet and the cayenne pepper to taste and let that simmer on the stove for an hour or two. THEN add the ground beef / onion / green pepper mixture and simmer for another hour or so. I don't allow the ground meat to simmer too long as I feel it cooks all the flavor out of it. Allow to cool and put in the fridge over night and then heat it up the next day when it has melded the flavors well. This is the most important step as chili is always better the NEXT day in my opinion. Add shredded cheese and Louisiana hot sauce to suit your own compression ratio. Serve with warmed tortilla chips and scoop it out of your bowl. Works for me.

I made this for New Years Eve for a family pot luck party. It turned out great. I actually had to make 2 pots of it because my grandfather has a special diet right now and can't have Green peppers, onions, and Salt. I made one pot without them ingredients and it turned out great for him. The second pot I made I left out the celery and added a bit of cummin. I also put the onion green pepper and garlic in the pan while I was browning the ground beef. Oh yeah and I used 1 really big can of Tomato sauce and as we don't really like super thick chili. This is a very good recipe even without all of the ingredients!

Delicious!  I left out the dried parsley because I didn't have any, and substituted the cannelini beans with black beans. I also reduced the salt. I topped it with shredded cheddar, diced onion, cilantro and a bit of diced jalapeno - wonderful!

I will admit that this was my very first attempt at Homemade Chili and it was no less than "Fantastic!".  I did make some minor changes such as the type of meat used (I don't care for Ground Beef very much) and basically added more of everything than what the recipe called for but all the ingredients listed were there.  I am an "Over the Road" truck driver and I have the ability to cook using a "Slow Cooker" so this was perfect for me.  With an on board Refrigerator/Freezer I had no trouble storing the left overs AND after reheating it in the Microwave it was thicker and more flavorful!

Did not like this at all. Spices were way off. I thought it was odd that cumin was not on ingredient list but I thought I would try it anyway since all of the reviews were so favorable. The meat had a mushy odd consistency too. I suppose that is why I never use ground beef in the slow cooker. Even if you were to reduce the cooking and preserve some of the texture of the meat, the flavor was still off.
I added a  lot of cumin and more chili powder and cooked it down for a while just to make it palatable for dinner, but would not make it again.

This is so tasty and versatile! My husband had been telling me for several years that he didn't really like chili. I finally just went ahead and made this and he liked it so much that he ate the leftovers I wanted to freeze for a quick meal later. 

The first time I made it, I followed the recipe. Now, to save money, I cook up a big batch of beans every month and keep them on hand in the freezer. It's so easy to throw this together and it hasn't been a problem to cook it on high for a shorter time if I want to, which really helps if I forget to put it in the slow cooker early enough. I use ground turkey and adjust the seasonings and it's always delicious. This is now on my menu every month.

This is one of my favorite recipes.  I will also take crescent rolls and take two triangles and form a bowl out of them on the underside of a muffin tin and bake for approx 12 mins.  Then you can use it as the bowl for your chili and it gives you some bread to eat it with.

Very solid recipe and easy to tailor! I don't know how anyone can rate this poorly. I did found this recipe too soupy. Prob next time I'll drain all but 1 can of beans. Also, sauté onions, celery, and pepper till soft. Next time I will use white wine to lift all that flavor from the pan. I also recommend tasting the sauce before you start the slow cook process. That way u can tailor the chilli to your taste. I added a little cumin and bay leaf to added aroma.

Made this recipe the other day and the whole family fell in love with it. I did not add the celery. I used crushed tomatoes and a can of diced tomatoes with chilies in it. Differently making this one again.

I used turkey instead of beef and added a pinch of cinnamon, and it turned out pretty good. I like my chili a bit spicier, though, so next time I'll use some hot peppers.

Super easy and delicious. Added about half a teaspoon of cumin and quite a bit more cayenne and doubled the meat.  I will probably follow suggestions and replace one of the puree cans with diced tomatoes.  Served with cornbread and on top of mac - happy happy!

I love this recipe!  It s super easy.  The last time I made it, I made tacos for dinner and simply doubled the amount of meat I made.  That was I just had to dump it all in the slow cooker, plus it gave it a little more flavor since it had taco seasoning on it.

Added extra garlic and cumin. My husband added more chilli powder and hot sauce when I wasn't looking and he said it was a fantastic result for my first try at making chilli! We spooned this onto our American hot dogs for dinner.

With a few changes this recipe can be a 5 Star recipe.  I followed directions exactly, then had to make a few changes.  Increase Chili powder to 1 and half to 2 TB.  Increase onion to at least 1 cup.  I use at least two bell peppers, yellow and red are good too!
I've also added in shredded zuchinni and carrots and it still tastes great!
After those changes I give it 5 Stars!

I made this yesterday and it was fantastic!  It was a cold fall Sunday - perfect for a warm chili dinner.  I got a late start on cooking it, so I cooked it on high for 4 hours instead of on low for 8.  When serving, I added shredded pepper jack cheese, a spoonful of sour cream, and a side of homemade cornbread.  AMAZING.

The recipe wass a good base but def needed some more flavoring to it. Was a pretty non spicy chili. I don't like spice but in chili I like it to have more flavoring. Would make aagain but make some adjustments.

Quite enjoyable. I would agree with a earlier description: "earthy".  In the future, I'll probably buy one of those chili mixes and use for seasoning purposes because there was definitely some room for growth in the seasoning department.

Delicious! I always modify it some depending on what ingredients I have. I used 1 full green pepper, 2 jalapeno peppers, 1 full medium onion.  2 lbs of ground beef.  For the seasonings I used about 1 tsp of each.

We added:

1 tablespoon cumin.
3/4 cup red pepper.
1 can tomato paste

Chives.

I just made this overnight and I thought it was quite good. Gave it 4 stars simply because I felt it was too soupy.I have never made chili before so I was afraid of altering the recipe. I think I'd drain the liquid on another can of beans perhaps. I could've went with another 1/2 lb of meat as well. Certainly beats the chili out of the can though.

I love meals cooked in the slow cooker.  This is a good baseline recipe, but I have to admit that I change it quite a bit for personal tastes.  I can't believe this chili recipe doesn't call for Cumin.  I add that, along with a red pepper for color and taste.  I also add a lot more garlic and a lot more hot sauce, and left out the celery.  I'm not a fan of cannellini beans, so I use black beans.  It's so much better the second day.

For extra flavor, I threw in a bottle of Guinness. Also used canned tomato instead of the puree, with one of the tomatoes with pepper. Also used Sirracha instead of chili powder. To thicken I also added flour into the cooker until desired thickness. Topped with cheese was very yum!

This chili was a big hit in my house. I added 1 large can of kidney beans and a small can of cannellini beans. I did not add the celery as suggested by other views. I added 1 onion, 1 green pepper and a tsp of hot sauce. I adjusted the season according to taste. Everything else I pretty much followed. I paired it with baked potato topped with cheese and sour cream. This was a first for my family and they keep asking me to make it again.

This was easy and delicious! I made this last weekend (my first dish in my brand new slow cooker). I took the advice of a few of the other reviews. I drained the beans, I used one can of Hunts Diced Fire Roasted Tomato. I'm not an onion person so I used onion powder (one teaspoon). It was done in 4 hours.

I like to try different chili recipes and have tried many, but I may stop here! This was a HUGE HIT!  I did double the onion and garlic and sauté it in olive oil before adding them. I also used one can of purée and two cans of diced tomatos with peppers. Won't change a thing!

This was very good but had to add more seasoning.  I checked the chili about an hour and a half before finishing and it was a bit bland.  I added an additional 1/2 tablespoon of chili powder (Total 1 T.) and 1/2 tsp of ground cumin powder.  My family does not like bell pepper so did not add that.  Will make this again...SOON!

This recipe was probably the most disappointing recipe obtained from this site. It was so bland. We quadrupled the spices and when it was done, all I had was a bowl of salty, semi-spicy chili. I have no idea how fix it. Sorry, I won't be keeping this recipe.

This came out very good, and was relatively easy.  I loved the idea of letting the crock pot sit all day long, and just come along to eat when we were ready.  I had never had slow cooker chili before, and I was surprised by how soft the meat was.  I made a few substitutions based on reviews and the cans of beans that I had on hand.  I replaced the 2 cans of tomato puree with one 28 oz can diced tomatoes and 1 12 oz can of tomato paste.  I used 1 can kidney beans, 1 can garbanzo beans, and about 1/2 a can (leftover from something else) large butter beans, all drained, plus a can of baked beans with the liquid.  I really liked the texture of all the different beans in there.  While the chili was certainly not lacking in flavor, it could have used about 3 or 4 times the amount of chili powder -- it was almost closer to a meat sauce flavor than a chili flavor.  Still, it was delicious, made a ton (careful when mixing, it barely fits in the pot), and I would definitely make it again.

I love this recipe.  I found this when I was looking for a chili much like my Dad used to make.  I do add two jalepeno peppers for heat and lots of hot sauce and use pinto beans instead of canellini!  Once I did not have all the ingredients and used black beans instead of one can of kidney beans, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce and tomato paste for thickness.  It  still came out great!  Thanks!

What a hit with the family!  I've been searching for a chili recipe that's not too spicy and has some sweetness.  On the advice of a previous review, I used pork & beans in molasses (2 cans) and just 1 can of kidney beans (drained) and omitted the cannellini beans.  I also added extra garlic, some mushrooms and increased the beef to 2 pounds.  For our family of three, the left-overs didn't last past noon the next day!

...REALLY good flavor!  I only had 1 can of kidney beans so I threw in a can of ranch and left out the cannellini...I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes that I put in the blender with the garlic.  Slow cooked all day on low..served over tortilla chips and topped with cheddar cheese and sour cream...Next time I will double and freeze half.  Really good chili!

We loved it!  Great Chili recipe.  I only used one can of kidney beans and substituted a can of pinto beans for the cannellini.  I increased the chili powder to 2 tablespoons and added a lot more red pepper sauce.  Very good otherwise...

I made this recipe for my husband, and he who thinks the best chili is made at steak and shake, said it tasted very good his only complaint was to many beans, so the next time I'm going to leave out one can of the red kidney beans. I personally liked it very much.

I did make this with turkey for personal preference, drained/washed all the beans and added can diced tomatoes and about half a can of beer.  To help the flavors meld I cooked the meat till almost done then added all the seasonings and onions.  I then mixed everything in the crockpot and put it in the fridge over night.  It was on low for 9.5hrs because I came home late and it was delicious!  Really, if you like a more spicy chili (because this is not- which is the way I love it!) either pick a different recipe or add some spices!  This got rave reviews from a group of 5...I had hot sauce, sour cream, olives and cheese to add as people prefer.

I have made this several times. The first time I made it I found it tasty but something didn't taste quite right. After several experimentations I believe it was using the liquid in the beans and the spice blend  that gave it an odd flavor. This last attempt was so different from the recipe that it is hard to give more than 3 stars. 1 can each of kidney and black beans drained and rinsed, 1 cup tomato sauce for some liquid, 1 can diced tomatoes, extra chili powder, ground cumin, no basil or parsely (gives it an "earthy" taste), no celery and I added 1 can creamed corn. It was so good this is now my official chili recipe. It tastes good vegetarian style as well by adding ground round in place of ground beef

This recipe is fantastic!  Like other readers, I did tweak it some to suit my tastes.  I omitted the celery and doubled the amount of onion and green pepper.  I sauted the onion, garlic and green pepper in 1 tbsp of butter and then browned the meat with it.  I used 1 can of southwestern style diced tomatoes, 1 small can of tomato paste and 2 small cans of tomato sauce.  I also doubled the chili powder and put a good amount of tabasco sauce in (we like ours hot!)  My house smelled absolutely wonderful today!  It was hard not to sneak a bite while it was cooking!  I highly recommend this recipe :)

This is my second time making this recipe, of course I estimate all of my ingredients. With having a family of five, three of them being small children that are picky eaters, I never have any issues serving a second dish when I make this Chili. My husband has been waiting for me to make this recipe again...and he gets his wish....we absolutely LOVE this Chili recipe.

It wasn't that bad, but for me it didn't have much of taste. I had to add a lot of cajun pepper, black pepper, salt, and other spices to make it better. The consistency was nice though. My husband liked it, and ate it all, but he always eats anything and everything...Next time I'll try a different recipe.

I followed the recipe to the T (except for the fact that I left out celery, as suggested by other commentors). The taste was only of tomato, and indeed something was off with this chili. Perhaps it would suffice as a chili base, but I'm still wondering how to tweak this recipe so that I don't feel I've wasted so many ingredients. Any suggestions?

This was my first time cooking Chili and it was phenomenal! 

After reading the other reviews I made a few changes. I only used the liquid from one of the can of beans and just used the beans from the other two. I added 1/4 cup of chili powder, 3 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce, 1 teaspoon of white sugar, and 2 teaspoons of ground cumin.

I also used 1 teaspoon of dried basil instead of 3/4 - same thing goes for the oregano. I used 2 teaspoons of the hot pepper sauce instead of one. My husband likes his chili spicy. 

I didn't use parsley.

Pretty Good.  I personally am not a fan of bell pepper, but I put it in there anyway just for the sake of sticking to the recipe.  My husband said he thought there was too much celery, but I personally think it was the bell pepper he was tasting.  Next time I won't put it in...Or I'll half the amount I use.  

My mom gave me a tip for the future, and I did it to my left overs.  Put in some baking cocoa(1 tbs for the whole batch) and brown sugar( I don't remember how much she told me of that, but I put about a tsp in the bowl I'm eating right now).  Makes for a little smokier flavor.  Even without taking the peppers out, it is much better!

This is a great basic chili recipe and can be easily adapted for with what's available to you!  I didn't have bell peppers, but I threw in a jalapeno pepper and a couple yellow wax peppers in (it's what I had).  Since they are all hot peppers I decrease the chili powder to 1 tsp.   Also, I suggest adding about 1-2 tsp of taco seasoning to the ground beef while you are cooking it.  There is a great taco seasoning recipe on Allrecipes.  Just look for it.

Great with corn chips (I fried up my own out of corn tortilla)

This Chili is pretty darn good. Not  too spicy (so it goes over well with the kids) if you follow the recipe. I made a double batch which barely fit in the jumbo crock pot and froze the leftovers for an easy microwave dinner later.  Maybe next time I'll add some corn for that southwestern feel.

I have to agree with the other reviewers who say this is very bland, which is why I gave it three stars. It's a good base or recipe if you aren't into spicy.

Great recipe. Added more veggies since we are vegertarian I added a can of veggie broth and used meat protein as alternate meat. Doubled the spices for flavor and topped with cheese. Had great flavor and would make it again.

I followed the instructions for the most part... I used ground turkey instead of ground beef, which was a delicious alternative. I like my chili with a little more zip, so I threw in 1 jalapeno pepper (1 half with seeds and the other half without)... it was perfect. I paired this with the "Buttery Corn Bread" recipe I found on this site, which was AMAZING! My boyfriend was quite impressed! -- SCORE!

This turned out quite nice. Added a little more garlic and a little more tomato (3 small cans because it didn't make sense to divide it this awkwardly). Turned out great. Added a little more spice and served with shredded cheddar and sour cream topping. Lovely for a nice rainy evening, as it was last night.  Served it with Grandmother's Buttermilk Corn Break (recipe on here) - great combination!

This is a great recipe.  The only modifications I made was to add a small can of diced tomatoes along with the tomato puree and as I'm not a big fan of kidney beans, I only added one can.  It's a great basic recipe that you can play around with and with the slow cooker you just leave it.

Delicious!  I adjusted some of the ingredients to fit my own personal taste (like black beans instead of cannellini beans) and instead of tomato puree, I used the equivalent amount of chunky hot tomato salsa.  Other than that, I pretty much stuck to the recipe and LOVED it.  As the chilil was cooking I would taste it periodically to add any additional seasoning I felt was needed.  This is now my goto chili recipe (with slight modifications of course)

I really don't like to cook and decided to experiment with the slow cooker.  This recipe was great.  I followed some of the suggestions - drained the beans, added at least double the chili powder and hot pepper sauce.  I also included a touch of cinnamon and cumin.  My husband, who loves to cook and is very particular, loved this chili!

This was very good. Made as written, it was a little too watery.  I thickened it with a bit of corn starch and water.  I added additional chili powder & hot sauce at the end to suit the tastes of my family.  When I make it again I will take others' suggestions and drain the liquid from both cans of kidney beans and may add some tomato paste to help thicken it.

I love this chili recipe! Somehow I end up making it at least once a month. The only thing I do different is the beans. I do one can kidney, one can pinto, and one can great northern (my store doesn't carry cannellini) and it is always a huge hit! Also, if I have mushrooms in the house, they tend to make it in my chili too. YUM.

I wasn't as big a fan of this recipe as I was of the Slow Cooked Chili recipe on the site.  I only had one can of kidney beans and put extra tomato puree , but it was way too tomato-y. I would not have put the celery and would have put diced tomatoes and corn instead.

This was my first chili ever and for a chili novice, I will say this was super easy and came out pretty good.  My biggest change is that since I read the critiques of this recipe were that it was bland, I added two jalapenos. If you like heat, then that really kicked it up.   I also added a can of corn to balance the heat with some sweet.  I'm not entirely sure why celery is in here, I feel like it made the taste a little too stew like. I'd omit that if I make this again.   I used a full cup of onions because I love onions in my chili and even that was pretty mild on the onion. I'd add more next time.  I will be looking for ways to season this better without necessarily making it too hot, but I think this is a great base/starter recipe for chili, especially if you like it meaty.

It came out ok but I had to make several modifications to the recipe. the spices seem very odd choices.  Italian spices in chili?  I cut out the basil and used cumin which is standard with chili powder.  I've also never heard of putting celery in a chili so left those out.   If I make this again I'd do this instead -  use the drained can of kidney beans but not use a second can of kidney but black bean w/ juices instead use a can of diced tomatoes with juices use 5 oz of fresh pureed tomatoes 1 4 oz can of tomato paste and if you can find them roasted new mexico hatch green chiles with juices instead of green peppers.

I made this on Halloween night.  I had a house full of family and friends and received rave reviews for this chili -- there wasn't a spoonful left.  I didn't know what canellini beans were when I went to the grocery, so I bought extra red kidney beans.  I now know that they are white Italian kidney beans.  I also added a can of chopped tomatoes (with the juice).  The onon, bell pepper and celery give this chili a lot of flavor.  I will be making this again very, very soon.  Thanks for the delicious recipe!!!!!!!

This chili was EXCELLENT!! I personally don't like chili or beans, but my husband has been wanting some chili for some time so I decided to make some and found this recipe. My Changes: I seasoned the beef, sauteed the veggies in the juices of the meat, I used 29 oz tomato puree, I drained both cans of kidney beans, instead of cannellini beans I used pinto beans in chili sauce, I didn't have chili pepper or hot sauce so I used 1/4 cayenne pepper. I will be adding this to my recipes. Thank you!

I'm always looking for easy weekday recipes for those hectic nights after work. My family loved this recipe! It made so much that I was able to take the leftovers to work the next day and everyone there loved it, too. We don't care for bell peppers, so I left those out, and I halved the chili powder for a little less spice. It was still full of good flavor. I served it over fritos with sour cream and cheddar cheese (way to make an otherwise healthy recipe unhealthy - LOL). Thanks for a great recipe!

This was pretty good chili.  My husband and I love thick chili, so I chose to drain all of the beans before adding them to the pot.  In addition to the spices listed, I also added 1 teaspoon of cumin and an additional 1/2 teaspoon of salt.  Once everything was in the crockpot, I decided to add about 1/2 cup of water.  It turned out perfect!!!  My husband raved and even my picky children ate it.  We topped ours with cheese and sour cream.  Next time, I will add a touch more chili powder.  This was not spicy at all (which was fine because of the kids).

I thought this slow cooker chili was excellent. The only change I made was to substitute the liquid from the cans of kidney and cannellini beans (I did't care for the syrupy consistency) with a can of diced tomatoes. It was perfect!  I served with Italian bread.  Very hearty, healthy and satisfying! Thank you!

The measurements in this recipe were really off. I added almost 60oz of tomato puree just to get it to the point where it was more like chili and less like meat sauce. I didn't add any of the liquid that is in with the beans (I think it smells/tastes horrible) and found that it was the right (thick) consistency this way. I would definitely recommend sauteing your veggies in butter and garlic first.

I made this chili for my fiance's friday poker night, and i got compliments from all the men! I omitted the celery. I used one can of kidney beans, and one can of chili beans. I also added a small bottle of v8 juice spicy. It was a big hit at my house that night!

We loved this chili recipe, it was absolutely delicious.  I halved the amounts to make it for 4, but kept the original amount of garlic and increased the amount of hot pepper sauce.  This one's certainly a keeper - we'll be using it regularly. :)

I had made the suggested changes to this chili per previous reveiws like added more chili powder for the blandness and drained the beans prior to adding them to the slow cooker because it was stated to be to watery and soupy, and what a mess it came out to be! It was way to pasty (too much tomoato paste in it) all you could taste was all the tomoato paste in it! The added chili powder was nice, good spice but thats about it! It was like a glob of tomatoe paste. So I added some stewed tomatoes, with water as well as a can of niblets corn to get some consistence back. but all in all the flavor of spice was good, but thats about all. I wont do this recipe again. Sorry.

Loved by all, I used 3 cloves of garlic, substituted pinto beans for the cannellini beans and used 1 Tablespoon chili powder. I served this with the "Golden Sweet Cornbread" recipe found on this site.  Will make again soon.

This was so easy and delicious. It was perfect after 7 hours in the crock pot. I added more chili powder and more hot sauce, but other than that, I wouldn't change a thing!

I made this for a set of new parents - froze half and left half in their fridge.  They thought it tasted great, but my hubby thought it would have used more seasoning (hence the 4 stars).  It was very easy to make in the crock pot.  I used 1 1/3 lbs of ground beef, 28 oz can of whole tomatoes (ran a knife around in the can to rough chop them up) and pinto beans instead of cannelini beans (didn't think cannelini beans were in the true spirit of chili!)

This turned out sooo good! It simmered all day in the crockpot, and I served it with a dollop of sour cream and some cheddar cheese shredded on top, and buttermilk biscuits on the side! My family was very happy.

This is really a great chili. I made it for company and they also loved it. The only thing I changed is we used only one can of kidney beans and drained both cans of beans. We also used two pounds of hamberger because we like a very meaty chili. Also did what another reviewer suggested that I saute the celery, onion, and green bell pepper in butter before adding it to the slow cooker and they on low for 4 hours. loved it and will make this again. Served with a green salad.

I actually followed this recipe exactly, and it tasted like a bland bowl of tomatoes. It was the worst! 

In attempt to salvage it, I added cumin, beer, Worcestershire sauce,a lot more chili powder, brown sugar, more garlic, more onion, a little paprika.

It does not need so much tomato puree.

Loved the chili  I followed recipe but  I did cook veggies to soften a bit before putting in crockpot and used 2lb Hamburger instead of 1lb and used 3 tablespoons of chili powder and 1 teaspoon Ancho chili pepper.  Turned out great husband and kids loved it.

Won't make this again. I followed the recipe and when it was half way done cooking I tasted it. There was NO flavor, just as another reviewer commented. With the number of ingredients, I was perplexed but I added more chili powder, cayenne pepper, salt and black pepper. The flavor improved dramatically. I let it cook the rest of the time and then had a bowl. While this isn't bad, it's not great either. I'm not sure if it's the tomato paste and basil combo (which as an Italian, I love!) but it's just got a strange taste to it, as another reviewer also warned. However, unlike yet another reviewer, I did like the texture of the celery in it. That's about all I took away from this. So sad.

I am not a chili person, but this was pretty good.  I omitted the bell pepper, as my husband doesn't like it, and I was out of celery.  It is a very mild chili, so if you are looking for something with spice (as in heat), you are going to have to kick it up, though it has a very good flavor.  I will make it again- it is too simple and too good not to!

I think this is a great base recipe for first time chili makers! I bumped up the spices and added a bit of cumin.  I also used black beans and kidney beans and only drained 1 can.  I used diced tomatoes and puree. NO CELERY! Like I said it's a great base and you can play with it to your liking!!

I for one LOVE when people tell how they made their version of these recipes. It gives me ideas about what works and what doesn't. When I make homemade lasagna, I pull out my 3 favorite recipes and use what I like from them-different prep every time but always delicious.

My husband and I love this recipe! It's the only chili recipe I use. As with all recipes I tweak them to please the tastes of my hubby and make it my own. The only changes I have made on a consistent basis is to drain all liquid from the cans of beans, add more veggies, and 1 can of corn. My secret to making this man approved is to also use one bottle/can of beer to replace the lost liquid. The result is a thick pub style chili that is great on game days and super cold winter nights! This  recipe has become a staple in my household!

This was a very versatile dish. Mild enough to satisfy my 8,7 & 5 yr. old children yet easily adapted with a few jalapenos and tabasco sauce to a volcanic gutbomb. Definitely will make this again!

This was AWESOME!!! The only thing I did different was add taco seasoning to the meat... Oh and I used fresh everything instead of dried... It was amazing! My family barley believed me it was my first time making home made chili thanks!!

This chilli was really good. I used ground turkey instead and seasoned it with black pepper, paprika, onion powder and a little salt while browning it. Serve over white rice and this was the perfect sunday meal.

I do not like spicy foods, so I am picky about the chili I eat. This was AWESOME! I tweeked it by adding diced tomatoes (with oregano, garlic and basil), I added a pound of turkey sausage (I like meaty chili), I deleted the hot sauce, and free poured the spices and veggies. I made it for Super Bowl Sunday and everyone LOVED it!! I am making it again tonight!!

I didn't care for the flavor of this chili.  It tasted too bland for my preference.  I added a bit more salt, which helped some.

the base was great, but missing some of my usual ingredients.. so i put one large can crushed tomatoe, 1 small italian diced and two 1 can kidney beans, both drained. i used diced steak cubes along with hamburg, add spices to meat when sauteing, After meet is cooked I used 1 tbsp flour and spices to cover cooked meat to keep the flavors in the chili.  Veggies, are what you like. i like onion and shallots and then some freeze dried tomatoes to the chili. (sometimes corn, but not most of the time)  chili is fantastic.  this is a great recipe to start with and tailor it to your own tastes. .thanks for sharing.

Definitely had to add a few extra ingredients since I thought it was rather bland.  I prefer sweeter chili so added some white sugar.  Also added some cumin and a dash of steak sauce.

Super yum! While my hubs would beg to differ, I think this is the best chili I've made in a LONG time! My only complaint is that this is a tad too beany for my liking (and I like my beans!). My hubs isn't a fan of beans, so of course he didn't care for this. :( I will definitely make this again if for nothing other than the convenience factor, but I'll make a few modifications to better suit our tastes. I suggest eliminating one can of kidney beans and increasing the beef by a half pound to compensate. Other than these changes, I think this is perfect as is. Served bowlfuls topped with chopped red onion, cilantro and shredded pepper-jack cheese. All I can say is this is the BOMB!!! :) Cornbread was the perfet accompainment. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Danielle! :-)

Delicious slow cooker chili! 

The chili turned out really well. I didn't have eight hrs, so I put the slow cooker on high and cooked it for 4 hrs. I forgot to put in the celery and I substituted the cannellini beans with great northern beans. I topped off the chili with some diced jalepenos and shredded cheese. 

This is definitely one I will be making again!

I added 1 lb of hot sausage, 1 can corn, skipped the puree and added a bit of chicken stock to substitute the liquid from the beans- must rinse your beans to avoid such a large sodium intake. Topped the chili off with sour cream, freshly grated extra sharp cheddar and fritos. Needless to say it was a huge hit. I also added a touch of cinnamon. Love love loved it!

I made this for a casual dinner party.  Used the recipe as written except I forgot to put in the green peppers.  There were no leftovers and everyone said how good it was.  It is also very easy to make and left me plenty of time with my guests instead of in the kitchen.

We love this! Whenever we want to host a dinner for a group of people, we usually make this :) I use ground turkey and don't add hot pepper sauce or chili powder, and it still tastes GREAT. So much flavor and is perfect with a little cheese on top.

This was probably one of the best tasting and easiest slow cooker recipes I've tried. Tastes amazing as leftovers as well. My only recommendation would be to taste it a few hours into the simmering to judge whether or not the chili needs more garlic, salt, etc.

I made this recipe without celery (didn't have any) and without chili powder or hot sauce.  It was very good and everyone enjoyed it.  I added a little Worchestire sauce for additional flavor.  I would definitely make this again.

I made this, and it was really good!  The only thing in preparing it, I accidentally put too much (2 cans) of tomato pureer instead of 1.  It was too much liquid for for my crock pot, so I cooked it on top of the stove instead. well, it cooked much faster.  I just had to keep stirring it, so it didn't stick to and burn the bottom of the pan. I think I will make it with double the tomato puree next time.  It was nice and thick!  I also got shredded cheddar cheese, to put on top.  My family loved it!

I loved this chili! I've made this 2 or 3 times, already. My only variation: I don't use any meat. It's hearty even without it. Aside from that, I serve it over Fritos with a dollop of sour cream (and maybe some shredded sharp cheddar cheese) on top. I am not a big fan of spicy foods, but my husband is. We were both VERY pleased with this recipe. THANKS!

This was excellent!  I doubled the recipe and used black, kidney, pinto, and chili beans.  I also used 3 cans of diced tomatoes and two cans of tomato paste plus 1 cup of water instead of the pureed tomatoes.  I also added a can of corn instead of the celery.  The seasoning was excellent and this is a good recipe to play with by adding different beans and veggies.

First time making chili and it turned out really well. My daughter, who only eats "Wendy's" chili said this was really good.  Followed directions, with the exception using one can of puree and two cans of diced tomatoes w/ pepperse onion and celery added. Added a small can of green chilies, because I had it.  Just enough spice with out any other additions or adjustment.  I will definately make again.

Absolutely Delicious!!! This was only the 2nd time I've made chili. This was the first time in a slow cooker. The recipe was easy to follow...the slow cooker did most of the work. To give it an extra kick, I added sliced jalapeno peppers.

This recipe was a little bland for me.  I substituted half of the pureed tomatoes for Pace sauce and it was much better then.  It added more flavor.

I made this first time for an office carry-in. It was a hit. I added some jalapeno, habanero, and anaheim peppers to it and increased the chili powder though. I like my Chili with a lil spice to it.

This was a delicious and hearty dinner, perfect for a cold winter night! I didn't have any kidney beans, so I used 1 can black beans, 1 can chili beans, 1 can pinto beans and 1 can white beans. I also cooked the vegetables in a Tbs. of butter before adding them to the slow cooker, and added a 1/2 tsp. of smoked paprika for additional seasoning. Yummy!

Wonderful chili recipe - I've been tinkering with it a lot - I try to make this a full slow cooker's worth so I have lots of leftovers because everyone loves it so much.  I found adding one can of 'special' beans (of all types) adds a bit of variety to it each time.

Just made it, my first meal in a slow cooker and it was fantastic. I used ground chicken (always do), and put in all diced tomatoes-- but drained all the cans of beans. This made for the perfect amount of thickness. I also noticed it needed a bit of salt when I got home to check on it, so I just added a tiny pinch, mixed 'er up and it was great. I made this as part of a very strict, disciplined nutrition plan I live-- yes, I'm serious! This makes for a very healthy meal in the right portion, and I had it with half a toasted pita which I grilled with a homemade garlic spread.

A good, basic chili recipe.  Smells wonderful cooking.  I left out the cannellini beans and celery and substituted a can of chili beans for one can of kidney beans (just personal preference).  I also sauteed the onions with the meat.  Not my favorite chili, but probably one I will make again when I need a slow cooker recipe.

This recipe turned out great!  The only reason it is getting 4 out of 5 stars is because strayed from the recipe a bit and used some of the modifications listed by other users: drains all the beans, added a can of chopped tomatoes, and I left out the celery and oregano because I didn't have any but upped the other spices to 2 tbs chili powder & way more Tobasco, because I was making this for my fiance and he likes his stuff spicy.  He tasted it today and said it was warm but not overpowering.  I also upped the veggies to 1 green pepper and about 3/4 of a large white onion, and browned them with the garlic before putting them in the crockpot. The consistancy of this chili was great, the perfect meat/veggie/sauce ratio.  I think another reviewer mentioned that it is almost impossible to please everyone with a chili recipe, as everyone has their own precise idea of what chili should be, but this is definitely a great base recipe, then just adjust the spices to your liking.

This turned out very good after 3 hours on high in the crockpot.  My husband loved it - added a bit more chili powder and called it good - but I thought it lacked a certain something... next time I might try more spices.

I made a double-portion of this for today's Super Bowl. The initial review from my boyfriend was that it was bland, so I added several things. (Remember, this is a double-portion) 1 small can of sliced jalapenos, more chili powder to taste, cayenne pepper to taste, salt, black pepper, and the other recommended spices.

Overall it was good, however not as thick as I usually like my chili. I could've used more spices as well. I'll continue to tweak it to my personal tastes.

I made this chili on a cold fall day and my husband could not stop raving about it!  I did tweak a few things:  I doubled up on the amount of garlic (mmm garlic), omitted the celery (I don't like warm celery), used a larger (27 oz. I think) can of tomato puree, drained all of the beans, added a 15 oz. can of diced tomatoes with juice, and added a bit more of each seasoning.  The chili turned out thick and flavorful, exactly what I wanted!  I'll definitely make this again.

I made this with finely chopped stewing beef for something different.  I still prefer ground beef, but my husband loved it the way I made it.  An almost perfect recipe, though I used about 4-5 tablespoons chili powder.  Maybe we just like our chili spicier then some.

This is a good base for a healthy chili recipe.  I like a bit of heat so I added ground red pepper along with some Louisana hot sauce which I think brought it up to a 4 star.  Unfortunately I don't think it is possible to reach 5 star status when you are missing things like honey and BBQ sauce which starts to make it a bit unhealthy.

I will make this again (with my modifications).

This recipe was perfect, I only made a few small changes with the type of beans: kidney and chili or red beans instead of cannellini.  Also, canned diced tomatoes should be used to make it nice and chunky.  If you like yours spicy add red pepper flakes and paprika.

I added 3/4 lb. ground chuck, and 1 can italian style diced tomatoes. Drained both cans of kidney beans, added more garlic and tobasco sauce.  Did not have chili powder, but it turned out great anyway.

I made this for a crowd to celebrate my daughter's birthday.  I doubled the recipe and they were still scraping the crock pot for more!  I left out the onion, added a bit more beef, left out one can of kidney beans (one without liquid).  It was delicious!  I served it with sour cream, shredded cheese and corn bread.  Definately my new chili recipe!

Loved this!! I added a can of diced tomatoes and used medium chili powder. Next time I'd add a jalapeno too... wasn't quite spicy enough for these heat lovers!!

We really liked this chili; and I'm not a big fan of chili!  I sauted the onions, peppers & celery in a little butter to give them a head start with softening.  I followed the recipe but I will make one change next time.  When I was eating it I felt it lacked a little 'tang' so I mixed a little ketchup in and thought it was perfect.  Next time I'll add 3/4 cup - 1 cup ketchup to the whole recipe.  Also, I cooked it for 4 hours on high.  My family, especially my husband (a huge chili fan) loved it!

I gave this 4 stars and not 5 because although the taste was outstanding, (The best chili I've made EVER!) it was too soupy.  I cooked it on high for 5 hours then another hour with the lid off.  And the onion and celery were still crunchy. (I omitted the green pepper) I'm not sure if it's my slow cooker, which is quite old or the recipe. I ended up transferring the whole thing to a big dutch oven and simmered it uncovered for another hour until it reduced to a nice thick consistency.  My advice to you if you use a slow cooker for this recipe would be to brown the ground beef with the onions and celery to start softening them a little.  I'll certainly make this again, but I will cook it on the stove and not in the slow cooker.

I love this chili recipe. You can adjust the heat(spicy-wise) to this. I used ground turkey instead of ground beef. I used one 29oz can of tomato puree and one can of petite diced tomatos. I put everything in the slow cooker the night before and let it cook on low for an extra hour and half than what the recipe asked for.

This was pretty good, but not "wow." I had four men eat it who love chili and I barely got a compliment on it. Boyfriend said it didn't have enough flavor, and that's in spite of the fact that I inreased the chili powder. I don't eat chili so I have to go with what they say.

This was good and healthy! We used Rotel diced tomatoes with chiles instead of the tomato puree, and we used ground turkey instead of beef. It had a mild chile flavor, and reminded us of soup. Served with corn bread. Yummy!

When the time was up in the  crockpot and I took the taste test, I wish I would have not added the liquid from the beans and used tomato sauce instead.  I just wasn't thrilled how my chili turned out sort of "syrupy."  So I added some tom. sauce and more chili powder.  After that, it was more to my liking.  However when I reheated it the next day, it was terrific!!!

I couldn't find cannelini beans so I replaced it with one more can of kidney beans.  I didn't have hot pepper sauce so use chili pepper oil instead.  Other than that I followed your recipe exactly as shown and all I can say is, "WOW!"  My family loved it and even I loved it and I am not a big chilli eater...until now!  Very easy to make and great on the budget!

Wonderful and  delicious. Added liquid smoke, just 2 drops Grated carrots 4. Canned mushrooms, sliced. Great also to cook on stove top for 25 minutes to 35 minutes. Add 1 cup small sea shell pasta or rice last 20 minutes of cooking. Bread dumpings are wonderful 
to serve with this excellent soup.

This was good chili from the crock pot. The only suggestion or change I would make is to add a little more spice. My family likes chili spicy. I will make again.

My fiance and I loved this chili, but I changed a few things... I used ground turkey rather than ground beef, omitted celery, and used one can kidney beans and one can black beans with liquid rather than the beans recommended. Also served over small pasta shells... outstanding!

Caveat- 4 stars with modifications, but 2 to 3 without. 

Basically, if you double the amount of seasoning it calls for, and also add some spices that it doesn't call for, it tastes like a darn good chili.  If you make this exactly as called for, its way too bland. Don't be afraid to kick up the seasoning!

This is way too mild as is. I added a few chipotle peppers with some of the adobo sauce in the can. It added the perfect amount of spice and made this perfect.

It was really good with a few modifications. Since some reviews said flavor was lacking, I added 1 diced poblano pepper, 1 minced  jalapeño pepper and 1/8 cup fresh minced parsley (instead of dried). Since I added  the above for heat/spice, I substituted ground cumin for the chili powder and added two dashes of cayenne. I rinsed the beans before adding and ended up using 1 large can of crushed  tomatoes (28 oz) and 1 regular size (15oz). Although this is much more than the recipe calls for, my chili still came out chunky and not at all soupy.

Omitted the parsley, basil and oregano. Did not want a spaghetti sauce tasting chili. Instead added cumin, Hungarian smoked paprika and some cayenne pepper. It's still slowly cooking away, but smells devine!

Wow ! This chili was great! I had never made chili before and after finding this recipe, I thought I would give it a try. I followed the recipe to the exact, changing nothing. I cooked it for 8 hours on low in my crock pot, stirring only once at the 4 hour mark. It was thick enough to be considered hearty, while having just enough liquid to sop up with cornbread. Next time I may try a tad bit more hot sauce, as we like our chili on the spicy side. Overall my family and I really enjoyed this dish and will be making it again.

I like this simple chili recipe. It's easy and can be made in a crock pot or on the stove. I used green chilies instead of bell pepper to give it some kick. I also used 1 TB of chili powder because I've never made a chili that had less than a tablespoon.

Okay so I made some changes to this recipe so I'm kinda rating just what I have, but this recipe definitely makes a great chili base to work with! I sauteed the onion, garlic, and celery with the meat and also added some salt and pepper to the pan. I left out the green bell pepper completely and instead added a can of drained whole kernel corn. Instead of the tomato puree I used two cans of diced tomatoes (one with green chilies and one with onions and chili sauce) I only used one can of kidney beans and I left the liquid in. I used 3 tablespoons of chili powder as opposed to the half. I added a bit more salt than called for, used a few dashes of cayenne pepper, and used about 1 1/2 tablespoons of buffalo sauce instead of the pepper sauce.  Also added a few spoonfuls of brown sugar, and 1/4 cup of fresh cilantro. Topped the finished chili with sour cream and cheddar cheese. Absolutely perfect!!!

This is a terrific start to an ingredient list. I asked a few cooks I knew for some advice how to pump this up and wanted to pass it on.  First, I replaced the green bell with two pasilla peppers and included a shallot- be sure to sautee with the onion, celery and garlic first before putting into the pot. I drained all liquid from the beans. I used one can of kidneys, I added a can of drained pintos, one can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes, a tablespoon of Apple cider vinegar and a tablespoon of distilled white vinegar.  I included a tablespoon of brown sugar as well. Now, I am a fan of spice so I included one jalapeño, seeded and sliced. Most importantly and lastly, I picked up several dried chili pods earlier at a mexican market and softened them on a hot skillet before adding them to the crock pot. I choose a guajillo, California, arbol, ancho and negro. I removed them after 8 hours, pulsed them in a blender and stirred the puree back into the chili.  I was really pleased with the depth and richness of the resulting flavors. I'll be making this the rest of my life. I'd love to hear if anyone else tried this.

This is a great blueprint to start your own chili recipe. I used all the ingredients except the celery. I also substituted turkey instead of beef. To up the flavor, I doubled on all seasonings, tripled on the chili powder, used 2 cans of diced tomatoes with green chilies instead of the puree, added an extra clove of garlic, and used Extra hot Nando sauce for a kick.

Decided to make chili for the first time on Saturday, so I searched allrecipes.com for a simple recipes.  My family loved the chili so much that i was gone in less than 24 hours (3 people).  Sunday even I made another pot, but doubled everything this time so it would last more than a day.  The only change I made was I added more hot sauce and didnt use celery.

Soooo delicious! Changes: a bit extra onion and garlic, used red pepper instead of green (personal preference), used tubed puree as I couldn't find it canned, used 1 can kidney beans and 2 cans "chili" beans (chili flavored pinto beans)--this was GREAT, used extra chili powder and hot sauce, but would use even more of both next time. What I love about this chili--NO CHUNKS OF TOMATO! Just creamy, thick goodness. I will make this time and time again.

I love this as a base recipe - I've used it several times. However, when I make it I have to make to pots - One for the kids cooked as directed. The one for adults gets some jalapenos, lots of extra hot sauce and some ground cayenne pepper. Sometimes some other hot peppers, depending on what is in season. Also use dried beans with an overnight soak - 1 lbs is good for doubling the recipe. Also use some cheap, lean steak instead of hamburger.

This was delicious and easy. 
A few alterations: I used 1/2 turkey 1/2 ground sirloin, omitted celery, 1 can purée and 1 can tomatoes with chiles, drained all beans and rinsed. 
Added fresh chipped jalapeños , added cumin... It was allllll gone and waiting for more. 
Thanks!!!

Good chili. Took the top off for about 30 minutes at the end to thicken it just a bit before serving.

Next time I'll drop the cannellini beans, and add some turkey meat. Maybe try some chopped jalapeno.

Very good chili.  I like celery so I use it. If you want to add more spices...then go ahead. I change things up depending what is in the pantry and fridge. Mushrooms, corn, carrots, spinach, a can of maple beans, the possibilities are endless...go ahead and add what you like in a chili, but this is a good base to start with. Make this in my Instant Pot now. Brown up the meats and onions, add everything else but not the canned beans. Put on pressure for 10min to blend flavours, then NR for 5-10min, QR open it up stir in the canned beans and any other delicate veggies such as spinach. Ready to serve or keep warm until you are ready to eat. (my first rating was 2015, but I've made this a zillion times)

I've tried this and put it in my recipe box. I love it! It's easy to make (and even easier with a food chopper), tasty, and calorie and carb reasonable. We eat with corn bread ( when splurging on calories) or corn tortillas when controlling our carbs. Either way it's delicious. It's also a good food to take for lunch because it warms up well in the microwave.

It is very, very bland. I initially added about 1 Tbs of cumin at the beginning along with 3 or 4 small bay leaves.  After 8 or 9 hours, it was still bland, so I added about 2 Tbs of Tony Chachere's, 1 or 2 Tbs of chili powder, some Rendezvous dry rub, a Tbs of garlic powder, and a couple tsp of black powder.  After another 2 hours on high in my slow cooker, it turned out pretty good.

The first time I made this Chili it was served to my husband, and his Mom and Dad, for dinner that night; a bold move since I had no idea how it would turn out.  By the end of the meal everyone was complimenting me for it and having seconds!  Since his parents aren't easy to please when it comes to food, this meal must have been extra good.  A winner in our book!

Fantastic.  The servings count was a little low - no serving size mentioned, so we used 1 cup.  It was absolutely delicious. We'll be doubling the recipe for our next go around.  This served 5.

I liked it after I used diced green Ortega chilies, fresh oregano from my garden, one whole onion, grass fed hamburger, a ton of garlic, paprika, bay leafs, pepper, pink salt, lots of cumin, diced tomatoes, two cans of kidney beans during the last 45 minutes of cooking. Oh yeah I added a bit of chili pepper flakes.... But we are not hot chili eaters....we loved it! Cooked it all in a slow cooker. We topped it with sour cream, chopped red onions, grated cheddar cheese and chives. Had mini saltines too and ice cold beer!

This was just "good" for me, not "great." It is a good starter recipe I suppose, as long as you plan to add more spices or flavorings. But it didn't seem to have much flavor on its own, unfortunately. I added some Worcestershire sauce and hot sauce to try to doctor it up, and that helped.

I am very happy to have found this recipe.  Very easy to make & easy to adjust to varied tastes.  I read many of the reviews (Thank you!) and chose to drain two of the cans of beans as I prefer thicker chili and I used garlic salt instead of regular (we're garlic fans) otherwise, I didn't change anything.  I understand why most feel it's too tame a recipe but I personally prefer to taste the ingredients in a dish and not the spice/seasoning.  My husband, however, loves spicy and he just added more to his own bowl.  Overall, I found this to be something that I could enjoy, my 15 month old son would eat and my husband could adjust to his taste.  Thank you, Danelle!

This is a family favorite. I love that I don't have to measure anymore lol. A few alterations to fit my family's taste. But for me being new to cooking a lot this was a perfect base for me to go off of.

Made as described. The only thing I changed was adding more hot pepper and cook on high for 4hours because I was short on time. Came out great, right consistency and all.

heres what i did i flipped the recipe a bit but used the general recipe as a base, and i have a large family and a large crockpot, feeding 8 people ive learned to stretch and it was a bit cheaper.

first what i did i make my beans from dried beans so i took a bag of red kidney beans, quick soaked them and then cooked them in chicken broth and kept the juice. from there i used ground turkey cooked in a little bacon fat and salt&pepper. 
1 pound ground turkey drained
 1 cup diced onion
 1 cup diced celery
 3/4 cup diced yellow bell pepper
 4 cloves garlic, minced
 2 (10.75 ounce) cans tomato diced with juice
for the beans i used the tomato cans and filled them with beans and the one with juice i added the bean broth from the boil.
 1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans with liquid
 1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, drained
1 (15 ounce) can black beans i pulled from the freezer that i prepped from another meal with some of the bean broth
1 (15 ounce) can black beans drained (mine were frozen)
 1/2 tablespoon chili powder
 1/2 teaspoon dried parsley
 1 teaspoon salt
 1 teaspoon dried basil
 1 teaspoon dried oregano
 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
 and a sprinkle of different chili powder as much as you want

on top of all that i put in 3 chili flavor packets and i topped off the crock pot with more kidney/black beans and i put more of that bean broth in till it topped off the crock pot and had a chili texture, a little on the watery side and let it just cook on low for 10hrs.

Quick and easy and delicious.  I used ground turkey in place of the beef.  I also added cumin and a bit of crushed red pepper as I thought it needed a bit more flavor.  It turned out perfectly and normally we have chili left overs for a couple days, not this time.  Definitely worth trying.

This chili was incredible. I was shocked by how delicious it was, especially considering that it took about 10 minutes to chop everything and throw it in the slow cooker. My 2 year old son, who often gags when trying new foods, even enjoyed it, asking for "more beans". I switched out 1 can of tomato puree for 1 can of diced tomatoes, as recommended. We also used leftover grilled steak which added a delicious, smokey flavor that melted in our mouths. Then we added tortilla chops and a little mozzarella cheese into our bowls when it was ready to eat. This recipe is a must for busy, working parents.

I had never made chili by myself before but this recipe was very simple to follow and very tasty! I agree with some of the other reviewers who felt it was a little bland; we compensated by adding salsa and sriracha sauce to each serving. I plan on making this again this weekend and I think instead of tomato puree I'm going to use two cans of Rotel. I also think the vegetables would benefit from a saute before they go into the slow cooker, they were a little bit crunchier than I would have liked but that's just a personal preference. Other than that I highly recommend this recipe, we had it with tortillas chips and it was wonderful!

I doubled the recipe, as is, and made this for a big family gathering.  It got great reviews from everyone, kids and adults alike.  I'm the only one who didn't eat it, having been a vegetarian for over 25 years.  I served it with grated cheese and chopped onions, also cornbread.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

This was easy and tasted great.  The only thing I did differently is use ground turkey, added .5 tbsp more chili powder, 1 tsp cumin, and some cayenne pepper for spice.  I also drained my beans but added about 2 cups of water.  I will definitely be making this again!

I liked this recipe a lot.  I did replace the tomato puree with canned diced tomatoes with chiles which let me omit the hot sauce.  It made for a looser chili but I don't like to add hot sauce to my cooking because I feel like it just disappears in the cooking processing. It can be added after it is cooked.

Good BASIC recipe.  Chili lovers have their own idea of what makes a great chili.  So just add or detract (celery)ingredients to make it your own. We have a large crock pot and we like it HOT, so I diced and sauteed 1 jalapeño, 1 habanero and 1 hot banana pepper from my garden and added it to the mix along with cumin, chili powder, roasted paprika, and a few dashes of Louisiana hot sauce:)  As far as the beans go, you can add a combination of whatever beans you have on hand and you can't go wrong. I added, 2 cans of red kidney, 2 black, 2 pinto and 2 garbanzo. 2 jars home canned tomatoes and 1 lg can of chopped.  Makes plenty of leftovers.

I think this is Wendy's fast food recipe! Unoffensive, yet not eye popping. Per other review's comments I didn't add celery (good choice), I added a little extra hot pepper sauce, more chilli powder and half a can of diced jalapeno peppers and felt I could serve it to about anybody (even people who don't do spicy) without a problem, but also wouldn't get a compliment on it. Smother with shredded cheese, a few crunchy onion bits and sour cream and it will feed anyone.

I had a crock pot laying around that had never been used, and it was perfect because I was having a halloween party, in which it was snowing the whole day prior. Made it in the morning, and let it cook throughout the day and came home to my house smelling delicious! 

I did take other's advice, as I like my chili on the thicker side, and only used about 1/2 of the called for kidney bean liquid, and 1/2 of the cannellini liquid.

I replaced: 
the Kidney Beans with Butter Beans
I added:
3/4 can of canned diced tomatoes (1/2drained)
1 can of pre-sliced/peeled potatoes
1/2 tablespoon of chili powder
And then once it was all in the pot and stirred, I lightly coated the top with more oregano, parsley, basil, salt, and pepper. 

The potatoes really added a nice texture to the chili, along with the larger butter beans. I served with cheddar cheese, sour cream, and green onions... The chili was gone within an hour of people showing up to my house! Next time i'll have to invest in a larger crock-pot and double the recipe.

I've made this 4 times now, and each time I've gotten rave reviews!!! I did make some slight modifications to the origianl 8 serving recipe...
- I increased the amount of meat 1/2 lb
- Only 1/2 cup of onion
- I used garlic powder instead of garlic cloves
- 1 can of Kidney beans with juice partially drained
- 1 can of Red beans and all the juice
- I couldn't find Cannelli beans so I used white beans 
- 1 can of tomato sauce instead of tomato puree, and 1 can of petite diced tomato with partial juice
- Added a little more chili powder... a couple dashes  =)

This is a really great basic recipe if you're just learning how to make chili or you don't like spicy chili. My husband and I like it spicy so I added a seeded minced habanero, 1/3 cup chili powder, 1/2 tsp ground cayenne, and 1 tsp cumin. I also added about a tablespoon of salt and a tablespoon of pepper directly to the meat and let it sit for a couple minutes before adding everything else in. I've got a new house favorite now! And I'll stick to the original if I ever do a chili-bar style, so everyone is sure to enjoy!

Like other reviewers, I also thought this recipe looked promising, but bland. When I made this, I added 2 stemmed (not seeded) jalapenos, 2 finely minced habaneros, a heaping tablespoon of cumin, and upped the basil and chili powder. I also sauteed the onion, bell pepper and celery in a little olive oil until the onion was translucent for a little more flavoring before adding it to the slow cooker. One small can of diced green chilies was also added. Overall it turned out quite nice with those additions. I agree the celery was a bit quirky but it actually added a nice flavor to the dish. With the changes I made, I will make this recipe again.

This is a good basic chili recipe but, like many other reviewers, I had to make some modifications to get the results I wanted.  After reading comments, I decided to leave only one can of beans undrained and also swapped out 1 can of tomato paste for 1 can diced tomatoes with green chiles. This worked out pretty well for making a slightly thicker chili and yet still had enough liquid so as not to burn on the sides of the crockpot. Also left out the celery and halved the garlic called for (due to preference in taste).  As recommended, I increased the seasonings and spices. Anyone who likes a spicy chili will need to do this! Bumped up the chili seasoning to 1Tbl and the hot sauce to slightly over 1 tsp, also threw in a little bit of cumin. The chili still wasn't spicy enough for me after these increases and I ended up adding a few dashes of ground cayenne red pepper to the pot after it was done cooking. Overall, I would use this recipe again as a reference for basic chili ingredients but I will continue to adjust the measurements.

This was an excellent starting point for me. I made changes only because I used ingredients I had on hand, and adjusted for my family's taste. I made the following changes: I omitted the celery and the parsley (because I didn't have any of either), and subbed a can of black beans for the cannellini beans (again, because I didn't have any). I doubled the spices, because we like our chili pretty spicy. I rated it 4 stars only because even with doubling the spices, it still wasn't that spicy, so I'd imagine the original would be a bit bland. I threw it together before church this morning and am sitting in front of a football game eating it now. It couldn't be easier!

Very yummy - next time I will try to make it on a day when I am not home smell it simmering all day. The house smelled amazing. It also took me a lot longer than 15 minutes to prep, though.

This is a easy, simple meal. I added 1 can of diced tomatoes and substituted the Geen bell pepper with red & yellow peppers, the sweetness of the peppers adds a hint of fruitiness while cutting the tart from the tomatoes. I substituted white beans just because I"m not a fan of cannelini.

Axe the celery and add cumin... you won't ever regret it. If you like spice, I would go with an actual spice, rather than hot pepper sauce. Fix these things and you will like this.

It's not bad, but I found it didn't taste much like chili. It was very vegetably and not very chili-like. I think next time I'd use less celery, less tomato and less liquid. All in all, not bad for easiness.

Very simple and easy! Made it before lunch, and didn't have to worry about making dinner later on. Up'd the amount of spices used, when i sautee'd the beef i added the spices into it. and then added them again in the croc pot. Very delicious! I also added Italiano seasoning, Paprika and Cayanne!

My family loved this.  I did make some changes.  I left out the onion, celery, pepper, hot sauce, and cannellini beans.  I used 1 (15oz) can tomato sauce instead of the puree.  I used 2 cans pinto beans, all drained, instead of the kidney beans.  I added 1 can petite diced tomatoes, undrained. This was a thicker chili but still enough juice to eat with some crackers.

Very good. This had way more flavor since it was slow-cooked all day. I used less beans & tomato puree due to dietary restrictions and it was still very flavorful. This will be my new method for making chili.

I made this tonight with very few modifications (no cannellini or garlic on hand, so I used 3 cans of kidney beans and garlic powder).  I also swapped the ground beef for turkey as a personal pref.  I wasn't too sure how celery in a chili would turn out, but it cooks down really well.  I asked hubby and his friend how they liked the new recipe and they told me they'd only change one thing... Next time make a double batch so there might actually be leftovers!

I have to agree with everyone else, this was really fabulous!  I did make a few alterations based on what I had in the kitchen, like using different types of beans, and I did added diced tomatoes as a sub for one can of puree. Then I had to use tomato sauce instead of puree b/c I couldn't find it in my bags when I got home to start cooking.  But it turned out great!  I also added corn to it after it was done cooking and for my tastes buds it was the perfect touch!

Great Recipe!  I do have to say the next time I make it, I will use a little more ground meat.  And I did add a more chili powder as well.

Very delicious recipe!  The only thing I would suggest is when serving, put a tablespoon or two of sour cream on top with a handful of shredded cheese.  It's like icing on a cake!

This is now my go-to chili recipe! I forgot to add the garlic, and only had 2 cans of beans (one kidney, one black) but it still came out great. I don't think it needed 3 cans of beans. I also added an extra can of diced tomatoes with mild green chilis, since the sauce alone didn't seem like quite enough. I used 1T of Penzey's Chili 3000 seasoning blend instead of the plain chili powder.

This was a good recipe and very easy to make.  The only change I made was I added a can of tomato soup because it didn't look like there was much liquid in it when all the ingredients were put together.  The fresh vegetables were a nice addition that you don't see in a lot of other chili recipes.

This chili smelled so good cooking overnight that it woke me up!  Here were my tweaks that made it delicious: 93/7 lean turkey meat, drained fat No celery 3 cloves garlic instead of 2 2 cans Rotel plus one can sauce instead of 2 cans puree 2 cans kidney beans drained (1 red 1 dark) 2 tsp. Italian seasoning instead of separate herbs + 1 can beef broth + 2 jalapenos seeded and diced few shakes of Red Hot  It's a little spicy but if you like that you'll love these changes.  Will definitely keep and make this recipe again!

Loved this.  Drained 2 cans of beans instead of one and used one can tomato puree and two cans of seasoned diced tomatoes as well as a bit more hot sauce and cayenne pepper.  As always, I used more vegetables than called for and increased the garlic.  This went very fast and was even better the next day as it seemed slightly soupy and first and then became more chili-like as it sat.  Served with cornbread.

This is an excellent Chili recipe.  I made it exactly as the recipe states, but only used 1 can of kidney beans.  My husband loved it, and took some left overs to work the next day.  I served it with some home made cornbread (Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread).

This chili is a delicious, no-fail recipe!  The only change I made was to use 1 lb of ground beef AND 1 lb of roast cut into 1 inch chunks and used 2 cans of pinto beans (instead of cannellini) with the liquid from both.  I made it for a family get together and everyone (including my one year old daughter) ate it up!

I made this tonight and it was so good!  This was my first attempt at making chili and I was really happy with the outcome.  I changed the recipe a little (based on other comments).  I used 2 cans of chopped tomatoes and ended up having to add a little corn starch to thicken it up.  I also skipped the celery because I don't like it.  I drained 2 cans of the beans and used the juice from the third can.  Thanks for the recipe!!  I'll definitely make it again!!

This was perfect! I did everything according to the recipe but I added a hole jalapeno (took out the seeds) garlic salt, garlic powder...and i also added cilantro. I just love a lot of flavor and it turned out soo yummy! I highly suggest the cilantro!

Well, it's a good tomato base and it is a good chili I guess but...but for spice lovers beware! you will have to add spices, I added more chili powder, cumin and Tony Chachere's.

I love this recipe. The only things I do differently is I add one less can of kidney beans, I add the liquid from the 2 cans I do use & I add 2 cans of diced tomatoes slightly drained, then I add more hot pepper sause for that kick, but not too much so it dosen't burn our mouths.  serve with garlic bread. My husband & toddler love this especially in the winter time when it's cool. & since I've been in the morning sickness stage of pregnancy lately, we've had this quit often!

Very hearty and delicious. I used 1 cup green pepper, 1 cup celery, 1 medium onion, 4 small cloves of garlic, a sweetened red pepper, and extra chili powder since I did not have any hot sauce. Will try with the hot sauce next time. I did not have tomato puree either so I used 2 6oz cans of tomato paste with 3 cans of water. Oh and only 1 can of red kidney beans. Will do 2 next time. It was done after 6 hours in the slow cooker.

This was delish!!  I did sautee the onions and used a red bell pepper, with garlic.  Just used 2 cans of  Red Kidney beans with one drained.  Added 1.5 chili powder and 1 tsp of hot sauce.  Hot but not too hot really good topped with shredded cheddar and sour cream.  A keeper 4 sure.

Very good!  I made a few changes to the recipes though.  I added a can of mushrooms (I put them in everything), I seasoned the beef with salt and pepper while frying and I only had 1 can of tomato paste so I used some spaghetti sauce I had left over in a jar from the other night.  The chili turned out great.

This is a great base for chili. I made some substitutions to make it to my liking.  I omitted the celery and one can of tomato paste, but added a can of diced (drained) tomatoes and diced hot peppers. I drained the beans, but added about a quarter cup of coffee and a quarter cup of beer to the crock pot. The spice mixture included chili powder with dashes of ground cardamom, coriander, cumin, and baking cocoa. I serve it over warm corn bread.  Delicious.

This turned out great.  I couldn't find the Cannellini beans, so I just used white kidney beans instead.  Drained all the cans and added an extra tomato paste with some water.  Turned out to be a nice consistency.  Not too watery, not too thick.  This recipe is not too spicy which works great for the kids.  Adults can add some hot sauce if they choose.  Definitely a keeper!

I didn't use any celery. I sauteed the onions before adding to the crock pot, to enable them to release more flavors.
I only used 2 cans of beans, one drained and one with liquid. I enhanced the beef flavor by adding one beef bouillon cube.
I also doubled the amount of chili powder and added some cumin.
For tomatoes, I used what I had in the pantry, one can of chili ready tomatoes, and one 8 oz tomato sauce. 
It tasted pretty good.

This was a really good recipe! My husband loved it, he wants it all the time now. I did add a Red Pepper as well as a Hot Chili Pepper to give it a little more kick! I also added a package of Chili seasoning, and a can of tomatos with the juice, and drained all the juice from the beans.
Really Good Recipe thanks for sharing!

This is a good recipe.. However, the first time I made this, I didn't have chili powder.. So I added more hot sauce.. We liked it that way better than when I actually used all the chili powder... But I will definetly make it again, and appreciate the recipe. Thanks!!!

This chili was fantastic, although I did make some changes because of my personal tastes.  I seasoned the beef with Worchestershire sauce.  I also used extra chili powder and a dash of cayenne pepper instead of the hot sauce.  This was a great meal to come home to.

This is a great recipe!!!! I've made this chili twice and both time I used venison instead of beef. The second time I also added more black pepper and pepper sause and for the pepper sauce I used Franks Red Hot. I added more just for personal taste.

This was really easy to make!  I didn't have any celery, so I left it out.  I added carrots though.  I also added a lot more spices. I added an Italian blend, and I also added about 2 tablespoons of hot sauce.  It didn't turn out hot at all, but the flavor was amazing.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a hit in my home! I used buffalo meat instead and squash and carrots instead of the green bell pepper. The suggested spices were the perfect amt of hotness (fairly spicy) and i served jalapeño on the side for those who like it even hotter. thanks!

This was a nice, easy chili that tastes wonderful.  I think it will be even better the second time around.   I used my One Pot on slow cooker mode.  Still getting used to the One Pot.  Think the slow cooker would have meld the flavors even more.  I will definitely try this again.  It was hearty and very satisfying!!

I was a little disappointed with this recipe. Overly onion-y tasting (perhaps I had a stronger than usual onion?) and this recipe calls for no cumin! The taste was so underwhelming that I ended up adding more chili powder and some cumin.

I tried this recipe, but found it seemed to be missing something. I couldn’t put my finger on it until I saw other’s comments about cumin missing. Next time I make it I’ll add cumin as well. 
For my first batch, I added a heck of a lot more tobasco sauce just to give it a bit more kick. Also, I used two cans of low sodium diced tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce. I didn’t have cannalini beans, so added black beans. Thanks for sharing. My husband enjoyed what I made (he’s not a chili connoisseur like me.)

A good base recipe. The first time I made it, I didn't have 8 hours for it to cook, more around 5-6. It came out ok, not great. It was thicker than I wanted, so this time I included the liquids of all the bean cans. Also this time, I am able to cook it the full 8 hours, so we'll see how the flavors unfold. I used a can of diced roasted tomatoes and a can of crushed tomatoes instead of tomato puree. And I added a small can of diced green peppers and 2 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce.

I actually did not use the spices indicated but used 2 packages of McCormick Chili Mix instead.  I also doubled the recipe and used 1 lb of ground beef and 1 lb of ground turkey with 2 cans of kidney beans and one can of cannellini beans with 27 oz tomato puree plus 2 15 oz cans of diced tomatoes.  I cooked 2 hours on high and 5 hours on low.  Delicious!!!

This was absoluteIy the best chili I have ever made! The only change was I added a can of Diced Tomatoes. After watching the video I noticed the vegetables were in larger chunks than I normal chop. The larger pieces made a fantastic difference. Everyone loved it and actually asked me to make it again the following week!

Good chili. I added extra garlic along with a lot of chili powder. Next time I’ll add more veggies and cut the beans back. There were a lot in there. I’ll also add in some petite diced tomatoes to give it more texture. Overall, a good base recipe.

This is a great recipe for a basic, hearty, kid-friendly chili.  I wasn't sure it would be enough flavor with the minimal amounts of seasonings but after simmering for 8 hours in the crockpot it was perfect.  Those who want more spice and heat can always doctor it up to taste, but this is a great starter recipe for that!

This was my first chili that I have ever made, so I was looking for a starter recipe that I can build off of. If you want to make this a spicy chili, I suggest adding some cayenne as well. This was definitely a hit at my household though! Thank you!

I went heavier on the seasoning measurement and it was great! Ensuring a small, consistent dice cut for the vegetables made a good difference. Also, using a slow cooker liner made for barely any clean up.

was looking for a good chili recipe since I lost the one that I usually use and I found this one and it was a huge success with my whole family. I made a few changes, I used ground turkey instead of hamburger, I used one can of tomato paste and  one can of diced tomatoes instead of the 2 cans of puree and then instead of the cannalli beans I used light kidney beans.... I just made this and my family is already asking me when I am going to make it again

Made it, and everyone loved it! Was for a larger group, so tripled the meat, spices, and tomato purée, while doubling the veggies. Swapped out half the bell peppers for mushrooms, half the celery for carrots, and half the beans I didn't have for an extra can of kidney beans. A1 will make again.

One thing to know about me, I doctor every recipe... I almost tripled the recipe, 2.7 lbs ground beef. I added a&o to the beef while browning. I used one Vidalia onion and two small red onions, because I like the bite of a red onion. I sautéed the onions, celery and garlic for a few minutes, adding a splash of balsamic vinegar to caramelize a bit. Substituted red pepper for green, only because it’s what I had. Used two 28oz cans of San Marzano peeled tomatoes, pureed, with 1/2 tube paste. Added cumin and cayenne to taste (guessed). Even better than anticipated.

I made this today and tweaked it a bit as per other reviews.  I used ground moose, a whole onion, doubled the garlic, doubled the chili powder, added 1 tsp of cumin, a whole tsp of basil/oregano, 2 tsp salt, 1 can of canelli beans, 1 can kidney beans, 1 can of black beans, all drained, a few generous shots of tabasco and a bottle of corona.  My husband loved it, which is amazing as he isnt usually a chili lover.

I added Sam's club Gourmet Burger to the ground beef while browning and put 3 bay leaves into the Crock-Pot. Also, beans should never be added to the beginning of a slow cooker recipe. I only added them for 15 minutes at the end in order to avoid mushy beans.

This is the basis for a good recipe but when I made it exactly, it was extremely bland and not very meaty. Weird to see a chili recipe without cumin. I used 1.3 lbs of ground beef and another pound of finely chopped sirloin steak (marketed as "stir fry" steak), doubled most of the spices and added a tablespoon of cumin. My family STILL suggested I throw in a cyan pepper next time.

I actually added 3 pounds of ground beef and swapped a few other different types of beans, added 1 full chopped sweet onion, 1 full green bell pepper.   I did not include the liquid of any of the beans except for the chili beans.  Once, it's cooking and looking at the texture, I added 1 can of tomato sauce to give it the chili sauce.  Made enough for a weeks worth of meals.

A great “starter” recipe to build on.  I upped the amounts of all the vegetables, subbed a can of black beans in for one of the kidney beans and used fresh diced tomatoes. I also added cumin and siracha sauce because it needed a little extra umph.

It's in the crockpot, and it's full. 
I made some slight changes:
I used a package of dried beans. instead of soaking them I used my Instant Pot with 6 cups water. 
I used 2 tsp of chili powder.

This was the blandest chilli I have ever tried. My wife had to doctor this with so much more than the recipe called for just to make it tolerable.  I chose this recipe because of the reviews, people need to stop giving 5 stars and then changing everything about it.

It was very bland when made as the recipe directed.  I would have used chopped canned tomatoes, rather than only sauce, and I needed to add more chili powder as well as some cumin.  I even added a few drops of Carolina Reaper sauce, hoping to add some  "personality", and I don't even like really spicy food.  It worked well enough, but I wouldn't make it again.

I pretty much stuck with the recipe, except I used tomato paste instead of puree. I'm making tonight. The four stars are for the simplicity of the recipe. I love chili and have never attempted to make it on my own, so I'm pretty excited.

I made it, and even when I DOUBLED the measurement of spices it was bland AF. Chili for people who are terrified of anything "spicy". But it's convenient crock-pot chili and the ingredients are sound. Just...think of it as a chili base, and add way more spice as you see fit.
As for me, I'll find another recipe that doesn't run screaming from a  pepper. ¯\_(?)_/¯

Recipe is decent but I changed it and it was much better.  I added 3 jalapenos and 1 habanero along with half cup of stout beer and a little coffee for flavor along with a dash of Worcestershire and some beef bullion.  It came out with a super zing, much better.

My first thought upon looking at this chili in the crock-pot was: "It doesn't look right." But my first thought upon tasting it was: "This is amazing!" Probably the best chili I've ever made, and I've pleased a lot of guests with chili!

I really enjoyed this recipe. For some reason it made me think of my time in the Midwest :).  It turned out to be really hearty. I used low sodium beans and drained and rinsed all the beans and added about a half cup of chicken broth instead. I also omitted the chili sauce because not everyone in the house likes it spicy.   I also didn’t have any green pepper, so I skipped it. I will definitely make this again.

I agree with another reviewer, that this makes an okay base for chili or for someone who doesn't want much spice to their chili. I tried it because my husband doesn't care for tomato chunks, so I thought I'd try it because of the tomato puree instead.  He also doesn't care for green peppers, so I added Green chilies instead.  I also could tell from the start that there wasn't near enough chili powder, so added 1 tbsp. of regular chili powder and 1/2 tbsp. ancho chili powder. I also added 1/2 tsp. of ground, toasted cumin that I was surprised was not part of the recipe. It was okay, but definitely needed more spice.  I will add even more spice next time and some garlic.

Cooked for my husband and his brother and his family of 5 -  it was a hit all around, even with the kids, and super easy to make and clean up afterwards. My husband said it should be my default chili recipe from now on.

This is a really good "family friendly" recipe. It's flavorful and delicious enough that the adults go back for seconds, but not so spicy that kids can't enjoy it. My super picky son just asked if I could make this "a lot."   It's a food he'll eat! YAAAS!!!

There is nowhere near enough spicing in this recipe. I had to add at least 5-6 tablespoons of salt and pepper and 2 tablespoons of Tabasco plus another 3 tablespoons of Chili Powder and it's only just OK. The tomato paste has a bitter aftertaste. I can make it better next time by using 10x as much spices, and replacing one can of paste with some tomato sauce and a pinch of sugar to cut the acidity.

Yummy recipe. The only changes I made were adding fresh herbs instead of dry and I added fire roasted tomatoes. The hot sauce I used was a chipotle habanero which gave it a nice smoky kick to it.

Some decent tasting chili here. I'd only do one thing to it and that's leave out the kidney beans. Then you'll have official chili. Real chili does not have beans and I don't care who tells you different.

I added 1 tbsp more, I added 1 tsp of cumin, I added 1 tsp of white pepper relish. I added 2 can of diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. I trained 2 cans of beans. 
I cooked it for a Chili cook off and it won.

Winner winner! Made this for a potluck at work and it was a big hit. I followed advice of others and added extra spices (almost 2 TB of chili powder) and replaced one can of tomato puree with a can of diced tomatoes and green chiles. I also added a dash of cinnamon at the end of cooking.

So good!! I didn't add celery because that sounded kind of weird in chili. I also used one can kidney beans, one chili, and one hot chili beans. Only drained kidney beans. One can tomato purée and one can diced tomatoes. 1.5 T chili powder. Mmmmm!!!

Good chili. I used dried beans instead of canned and doubled the seasoning. In addition, I added a 1/2 teaspoon of cayanne red pepper and 1 tsp of cumin. Due to the dried beans I added beef broth to have enough liquid for the beans to cook.

Omitted celery, and substituted black beans for cannellini beans. Delicious and only took 5 minutes to prep. Yielded 8 servings for about 10 bucks! Will be making again.

So, I mostly used this recipe with a few changes. I included a lb of ground pork with the beef, used three diced anaheim chilis instead of the hot sauce and included a can of chipotle chilis in adobo sauce. And maybe a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce and a teaspoon of ground cumin.

I tripled the chili powder based on other reviews and it was still bland. There are much better chili recipes put there and this should not have such a high rating if you have to change the recipe to make it taste decent.

I didn't have ground beef so I used pork sausage & no garlic cloves, use powdered garlic & dried beans instead of canned (lower sodium content). Otherwise followed recipe. (I substituted Apple Cider Vinegar & water for the undrained can of beans, about 4-6 tbsp ACV to 16 oz filtered water) Cooked in slow cooker on high til boiling then switched to low. Still cooking but just tasted and my rating is OMG-TTsU (Oh My God - Two Thumbs Up)
Will DEFINITELY recommend & prepare again. It's the best chili I've ever made (& I've been trying for a couple years now.)

My husband is not a big fan of Chili,however he really liked this.
I put shredded Mexican blend chees as a topper.
I found it to be a little bland so I also added a few extra dashes of hot sauce.
Over all I would make it again.

I made this hardy chili and it was a hit for me and my family.  I did not add beans, as my children refuse to eat the beans, but the chili was amazing even without the beans.

Read some of the reviews and tweaked it a little... I like it a little spicier so I added some cayenne and paprika to the dish. Sauteed the onions, pepper and celery for 2 minutes before adding it to the mix and drained all three cans of beans before mixing it
My bf loved it and said its one of the best he's had.. will definitely be making it again! Thank you xx

Good recipe.  I didn't really change much except I thought it could use a little more seasoning, so I added some onion powder and garlic salt, and it turned out great.  My boyfriend however thought it wasn't spicy enough, so he added hot sauce to his bowl.

Cooked the onions and pepper with garlic and butter first. Added one shot of espresso, one teaspoon of cumin, half teaspoon of cinnamon and doubled all the amount of spices. Taste was on point!

It was awesome!! I used turkey and it was so good! Just the right balance of spices, and loved the celery being in there. I may sautee the veggies next time, yet truly delicious the way it is.

Awesome recipe, I combined it with the Boilermaker Tailgate Chili recipe. Will definitely make again. 

I sauteed my vegetables with the meat when it was close to done and added the seasoning while frying to try and set the flavor all together. 

Loved it for my first attempt at cooking chili!

Only giving four stars because I made some changes.  Used ancho chili powder which gave a nice flavor.  Substituted one of the cans of kidney beans for garbanzo beans and added about 1/2 a Tbsp. of ground cumin to give it a little more flavor.  Turned out wonderfully flavorful and not overly spicy.

I found this recipe to be bland. The only substitution I made was ground turkey instead of beef; maybe that was the reason. Maybe more chili powder would have added the spice I was hoping for. It looks great in the bowl though :)

I tweaked this recipe per my preferences (and what I had in the pantry), and it was awesome. Even my pickiest kid devoured it. 

I skipped the green pepper--didn't have any--and used 1 tsp garlic powder instead of fresh garlic. I sauteed the onion, celery, garlic powder and ground beef before adding 2 14.5 ounce cans of petite diced tomatoes, 2 cans of black beans (rinsed), a can of chickpeas (also rinsed), and a can of fire roasted chiles. I thought it looked dry so I added a can of beef broth. I added 1 T of chili powder and a tsp cumin, plus the basil, oregano,  salt and pepper called for in the original recipe.  I set it in the crock pot on high for a couple hours till we were ready for dinner, and served  it with cornbread, shredded cheddar and sour cream. Yum.

After doubling the ground beef and adding quite a few more spices plus increasing the spices called for, this was delicious and would make over and over - we loved it ! Adding diced tomatoes and a small can of tomato paste really made this chili sing !

Very good starter recipe.  I doubled all the spices and added hot Italian turkey sausage out of the casing.  I was looking for a little more flavor.  I also omitted the celery only because I didn't have it on hand.  Will definitely make again!

This is my go to chili recipe.  It's really easy to prepare, and you can tweak it to taste without losing it's essential "chilli-ness".

I leave out the celery, because I don't like it, and also I add more chili powder, hot pepper sauce (to taste), and between 8-10 heaping tablespoons of white sugar.  It makes a surprisingly good, savory/sweet chili that keeps my husband and I coming back for more.  We serve with saltines and shredded cheddar on top.  Awesome!

It turned out better than expected  as I changed it up a bit! I used 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 ground sausage. I also used red, yellow & orange bell peppers instead of green ones. I had to add more hot sauce for our tastee. My family loved it! Also, vegetables were super easy to do as I chopped them in my food processor!

I really like this recipe and make it all the time.  I happen to like the celery for a change of pace , but I add more meat to it.  Don't hate, but I make some ditalini macaroni and my family adds it in .  They add hot sauce to it, but I am not a fan of spice so it works well for us.

Pretty much followed the recipe (something I rarely do when it comes to main dishes!) and this was very good. I am still searching for the best blend of spices for my taste, but that has nothing to do with this recipe.

I really like the recipe but I made a few modifications. Instead of using 2 cans of purée, I use one. Gives it a little less tomato taste and more of a heartiness to the chili. I also don't precook the ground beef. I dump the raw ground beef in the crockpot and let it cook with the rest of the chili. I also add some cinnamon to give it a little bit of a sweeter flavor. Last thing which is super important to give it that chili taste, I use one package of chili seasoning from McCormick. My husband loves spicy chili so I use the Hot packet.

Have used this recipe many times but have made some changes to it to suit our taste buds even better.  I use more beef as we like it meatier, basically add a bit more of all ingredients as I have a large slow cooker and this chili freezes very well.  Also I omit the tomato paste and the celery but ad a large can of crushed tomatoes (Italian herb is the best) to the mixture and ad fresh sliced mushrooms, just a preference our family has but overall this is a great recipe that is a staple in our home, served with garlic bread....yum!

I'm not a chili fan so I made this strictly for my husband.  I didn't have all the ingredients so I substituted tomato sauce for puree. mushrooms for pepper and fresh chopped parsley instead of dried.  Additionally I used 2lbs of beef and only 1 can of pinto beans w/ liquid.  My husband said "better than my Mom used to make."  Highest praise from him, I'll definitely make it again.

Fabulous recipe! My entire family loved it and I will be making this again sometime soon! Instead of leaving it in the slow cooker for 8 hours on low, I left it in there for 4 hours on high.  So yummy!

1.25 lbs beef
drained most of the beans for thicker chili
added extra onions (sauteed with beef briefly)
added 1 tomato because why not
kept celery in, added carrots
and here's when it almost went wrong: instead of adding the amount of oregano, the lid spilled open an added about 6times that; panicking, i added 4 times the habanero pepper sauce...and amazingly the chili came out spectacular.

needed a bit more salt that the recipe says, but that could be due to my increase in veggies

10/10, A+++++++++++ will make again and add my own variants.

(side note - cooking is an art, so i took liberties with all ratios and ingredients, and followed my nose)

Went with the celery other than that delicious and when I cooked the beef I added 1 pkg of Sazon and my sofrito to give it a slight Spanish taste my hubby and son eat 2 bowls of it.

Super good! Made it with an extra can of beans and vegan meat instead. If you love spicy food I'd recommend adding a little more hot sauce, but all in all it's great!

I have made this several times and I like the flavor.  My family doesn't like the hot spice so I skip that but double the Chili powder.

One time I substituted "chili beans" for the red beans and I didn't like the flavor.

I will definitely be making this recipe again. I have tried several chili recipies but this has been the best so far! It's so easy to make and it's full of flavor. I accidentally added a whole teaspoon of chilli powder instead of a half teaspoon and it came out fine. I skipped the hot sauce to see how it would turn out but you could always add to it if you want it hotter. Sprinkle some cheese on top and you're good to go!

This was very good.  I didn't use the celery because it seemed out of place in chili.  I added a little cayenne pepper but left the hot chili sauce out and let people spice it up themselves.   I made this for the Super Bowl and everyone loved it.

Why have I been making chili on a stove top all these years? This is so much easier! I even got my picky husband and 5 year old to eat this chili,  although I did eliminate the hot sauce and cut back on the chili powder due to my picky eaters.

Super bland. I had to make a lot of changes including adding tomatoes, tomato paste, bumping up spices and hot sauce and adding cumin.  I would still consider it mild even with my changes. I made it for a party that had kids. So

Extremely simple to put together. Personally I don't like hot sauce so I swapped out that for  dried chipotle pepper powder for a nice smoky heat. Came out delicious, certainly worth making again!

Overall, my hubby liked this recipe but we both agree there needs to be some changes.  The basic recipe is good but it's ratios are off.  Next time I'll use 2 pounds of meat, and the 3 cans of beans was too much so next time I will reduce it to two cans (Preferably two cans of Bush's Chili Beans with sauce as this adds to the flavor and eliminates the need for Chili powder).  As for the tomato portion, I would use  Mild Ro tel diced tomatoes & green chilies and one can of diced tomatoes instead of the tomato puree.  This was the perfect choice and I didn't get the "too tomato" taste that other reviewers said, plus the green chilies really helped the flavor profile.  The only other change I made was I used fire roasted red bell peppers as I didn't have any fresh green peppers.  My husband loved the fire roasted.  Finally, since my husband and I like thicker chili, I think I will try 1 tbsp of cornstarch or masa flour as the sauce is too thin.

Overall I really liked this recipe. I omitted adding one of the two cans of kidney beans, and I drained all of the liquid from the beans as I like thicker chili. Also did not use celery. Next time I will add mushrooms and up the spice a bit.

First of all I am not a chili fan, I don't really like it, I've never cared for it, but my family likes it.  So I found this recipe and decided to give it a whirl. We sat down to dinner and it was great! Not only did my kids and my hubs like it but I liked it too. I'm adding this to my dinner arsenal. It was quick, it was easy and totally good on flavor without being spicy! Thanks person who shared this recipe, from everyone at my dinner table!

I loved this. I made it as is with a few changes:
1. I cooked the beef and onion together first.
2. I didn't add celery
3. I used 3 cloves garlic
4. I added one can of stewed tomatoes (in addition to the puree called for in the recipe)
5. I used kidney beans and black beans. I added NO bean liquid
6. I used 3 tablespoons chili powder
7. I used 1 tsp black pepper
8. I used sriracha chili sauce instead of hot pepper sauce and used about 1 tsp or more.

Super easy to make and delicious.. Love that there aren't so many ingredients like other recipes. Snow storm at home when I made this I didn't have kidney beans so I used black beans tasted the same. Used a little more tomato purée then asked for by accident.. I am not the biggest chili person and I love it!!! Will be making again.

Great recipe, but like most others, it's good to customise it to your liking. I held back on some of the beans, added a can of diced tomtaoes, and for spices added some custom chili mix, turmeric, cumin, paprika and onion powder. Serve with some tortilla chips and sour cream, great stuff!

The first time I made this I made the following change:
I used deer/pork mix & I also didn't add the celery.  I found I had to add some water because it was super thick (I figured it was because of the deer meat) but I also noticed there wasn't much flavor. 

The second time I made this, I still used deer & pork mix. I didn't drain any of the beans, added 1/2tbs taco seasoning with a few more dashes of Frank's Red Hot. I set my slow cooker on high for 4 hours & used some Mott's clamato drink to desired consistency an hour before it was done & it turned out perfect :)

I added 1 can of black beans, and drained all of the beans used in the recipe. It was very very thick..almost like tomato sauce with the ingredients mixed in. I had to add a lot of water (about 1 - 1.5 c) to thin it out, and even still it was very thick chili. I would recommend adding 1 can tomato sauce to have more of a chili consistency. Also, I used about 2 tbsp chili powder to make it taste less tomato-y and more like chili.

I liked it. I ended up making a few changes to it for my smaller slow cooker and to make it spicier, Took out one can of the red kidney beans and for the spicier version I added a bit more chilli powder and replaced the cannelli beans with chilli beans.

Loved this recipe!  I used Slap Ya Mama instead of salt and the hot pepper sauce.  And since I grew up in Louisiana, I loved that it had "trinity" in it (celery, onion, green bell pepper).  I sauteed the trinity before adding it to the meat. Yum!

This was just great, I use Turkey no liquid from the beans the tomatoes were enough. I use three bell peppers one red, yellow and green, I saute the onion, peppers and celery. I also added some celery root. I use my presser cooker for 55 minute and the rest is history.

I was looking for a slow cooker recipe because I had never used a slow cooker before. I found this, but tweaked it accordingly. I made chili today, but I didn't add celery or parsley. And I used chickpeas in place of one can of beans & added more garlic for taste. I also switched up the spices... I used Chili powder, Ground Cumin, little basil, little oregano, lots of black pepper, and 1/2 tsp of Cayenne pepper.  In place of one can of crushed tomatoes, I used a can of diced tomatoes. And I added 1/2 cup of chicken broth as I think using the liquid from canned beans is gross! It was flavorful and had a delicious kick! Spices are key to a good chili!

I added sweet peppers instead of green and in addition to the burger, I used pork neck bones to add a little substance. I thought it was a good starter recipe for those who have never cooked it, but found it was lacking in taste.

Delicious! My dad and brothers loved loved it; it was finished within hours of serving. I might cook the veggies on the stove next time to see if there's a difference. I wish my Crock Pot was a bit bigger so I could make more at once.

The recipe is a good base but is amazing with some other ingredients. Instead of ground beef I used a 2.5 lb chuck roast (trimmed and cut into small pieces) and didn't drain the beans. I also doubled the onion, chili powder, black pepper and pepper sauce, as well as adding 2 tbs diced jalapeños. Threw it all in the slow cooker for 8-9 hours. Add cheese and bam!

I made this but I didn't use hot sauce because I didn't have any. It was so good and I even added shredded cheese into my personal bowl of chili which made it even better!

I give it 3 stars even if it needs maybe one more star, I have replaced the capelin beans with chickpeas but even if it was all very good there's something missing and I don't know if it's more spices or salt but needs just something, it was kind of too blend , any suggestions? (Still good recipe to make and will do it again)

The chili came out great and I will definitely make again.  A few changes made: I used liquid from only one can of beans, using canned tomato sauce instead of puree (couldn't find in my local stores), and using one can of diced tomatoes and one can sauce instead of two can sauce.  I also didn't add hot sauce but added a teaspoon or so of garam masala for an earthy flavor. Lastly, no celery but had bell peppers.

It's in the cooking phase still but very eager to try it. Based on many of the reviews I anticipated a blander flavoring so I made some adjustments (as I often do being a serial recipe adjuster). I browned the hamburger in onion soup mix for starters. I also added mushrooms and carrots in addition to the other veggies in the recipe (including the celery!). I used one can of diced tomatoes and one can of tomato paste. I also used a 540 mL can of six bean mix (and didn't drain it) in place of the beans originally called for. As for the spicing, I doubled the amount of chili powder and used Italian seasoning instead of the the individual "Italian seasons". Then I added a dash of paprika and half a teaspoon of cayenne pepper. I'll keep you posted to see how my faithful and brutally honest critics fair with it. 

Cheers! Enjoy!

It was a little spicy for me but my roommates and friends loved it! Overall, great blend of spices. I substituted one can of kidney beans for black beans and added a bit more onion. I would definitely make this again, but with less chilli powder.

I signed up to make chili for my church's chili cook off. With limited time I scrambled to find a slow cooker recipe, that could cook while I was working. I chose this one. It turned out wonderful. I did forget to put the hot sauce in, but it didn't matter it was still great. This chili WON! It won the cook off. My wife and I were stoked!

Eh.  Im not sure quite what it is about this recipe that I didn't especially care for but I think it was the tomato puree.  I think diced tomatoes would add more of the chunky texture and a more tomato flavor that my children and I prefer.  It was not the worst recipe but definitely not a favorite.

I really like this recipe! However, it was SO bland. I had to add quite a bit of extra seasoning: more salt, some cumin, more chili powder, more pepper, some onion powder, cayenne, and I added sirracha. It was just so bland. Other than that, it is really good. I'll take a picture once it's done. I'm only a few hours in. Serving it with cornbread tomorrow. Also, next time I think I'll bump my veggies up to a cup instead of 3/4 cup and add in some drained diced tomatoes, I like my chili to have tomato chunks and a good amount of veggies. I drained all my cans as well. A very good base recipe! I hate to be the person that completely changes the recipe. I made it as is, but once into cooking I tasted it and made the previously mentioned adjustments. I think that took it from okay to AMAZING! My first time making homemade chili.

This was amazing.  It's a cold Sat and this has hit the spot.  I sprinkled some grated mozzarella cheese on top.  The chili is hearty and delicious.

Love this chili!  I used this as a base recipe. Because I have a large crockpot and love the leftovers, I made these changes: 2 cans each of the white and red kidney beans, 2 cans pinto beans, 2 cans black bean ( all 15-oz & no salt added, half of them drained), 2 7-oz cans diced green chile, 1 large can (28-oz.?) diced tomatoes and I added 1 lb. ground turkey to the hamburger. I took out the bell pepper and celery (-personal preference) and definitely upped the spices because of the volume. We added 3 generous tablespoons of chile powder.  Haha! In rereading this, I probably should have just submitted a new recipe!  If you like spicy, try it!

Definitely strain all of the bean juice if you like your chili thicker. I replaced the celery with carrots, but next time I think I'll use both. I'll also add way more chili powder and replace some of the tomato puree with crushed/paste to give it a bit more texture. Overall, a good chili recipe for a September Sunday!

Honestly disappointing--it tastes like watery tomato bean juice. We left out the celery, because it's an odd addition to chili.

Super delicious chili! I usually add a tad more seasonings than what it calls for and Substitute a can of tomato purée for a can of petite diced tomatoes! This is a regular dinner at our home!

I didn't add the oregano or basil due to not having any on hand and added a good bit more hot sauce (seasoned to taste). I thought the celery was a bit weird but you can't taste it once it's cooked. Just makes it a little healthier. Although if you should be sure to dice the celery very fine. We love it - will be making again

This isn't my style of chili. I wasn't into the tomato puree. I'd rather my chili a little less dense. I like a more moist chili. So this tasted fine, but I won't make it again.

Instead of ground beef, we used 2.5-3 pounds of raw beef tips, used 2 cans of beans (one drained, one not), no bell pepper, 1 can of V-8 juice, 1 can tomato puree, 1 can petite diced tomatoes, 1 heaping table spoon of "better than bullion." Add all  ingredients in the crock pot. Cook for 8 hour on low.

I followed this recipe exactly, and it didn't really wow me, flavor wise, but I can't say it was bad. The cannellini beans were a nice twist on your basic chili recipe.

My husband loved it. I think I will be greatly reducing the amount of liquid used next time for a thicker, meatier chili. I used 2 pounds of ground turkey and did not put in the green peppers or hot sauce and only used one can of kidney beans. I will be using some of the suggestions in the reviews as well.

I bought a brand new crock pot less than a year ago with two settings, low and high. Unfortunately, my chili was boiling after just two hours with my slow cooker set on low. Other than the burnt part, the chili came out good.

Made this last week in our crock pot for the two of us. Delicious ! The next day, we added a touch of water to thin it out before heating it up.

Not a good recipe.  I followed the recipe pretty closely except instead of cannellini beans I put another can of kidney beans.  I also decided to put in more spices since reviews said it was bland.  It's done and very watery, doesn't have enough hamburger, and doesn't taste like chili.  I would recommend another pound of hamburger, not using the bean juice (use a can of tomatoes and tomato paste in its place), and 1.5 to 2 times more of each spice (and add salt, cayenne pepper, and crushed red pepper).

This isn't your typical chili and I'm okay with that.  I do love the extra veggies snuck in.  It was something that my boys would eat and I felt good serving it.  I think the seasonings were a guideline and I took it as so.  We like more garlic and a lot more spice so we adjusted it to our liking.  I think next time that I will saute the onions and celery prior to putting in the crock pot.  That is the only thing that I would change.

Just cooked this for family football evening, really excellent.  I did add a good bit more chili powder, hot sauce, and some cayenne pepper because we love spicy chili.  But this recipe is a great base that even the spicephobic can enjoy.  Served as in thenpicture with sour cream and green onion garnish, and optionally some shredded cheddar.

Very nice chili. Done this a couple times. Use only 1 can of kidney beans with liquid, 3/4 tsp chili powder, 1/4 tsp hot sauce & tomato paste instead of puree.

Made this chili for tonights dinner.  House smelled AWESOME while the chili was cooking.  Made minimum changes (didn't add parsley or third can of beans) and overall the recipe was yummy.  It did taste rather tomato-y & definitely could use more seasoning. With adding more seasoning & kick, I will make this again as my family devoured the chili.

De-Lish! Easy and quick to prepare. I made it with ground chicken, doubled the ingredients and froze half. Great recipe to use as a base for slow cooker chili. My family loved it with some white rice.

I'm giving this recipe 3 stars because I had to add a bunch of things to it to make it taste like something .  The original recipe was so bland.  I adjusted it for 12 servings then added 1.5 tbs chili powder, 1 tbs cumin, 2tsp chili flakes, 1tsp cayenne pepper, 2tsp hot sauce, 1tsp black pepper and I doubled all the other herbs, garlic, and added an extra 1/4 cup of onion and I it awesome now!

A bit light on the Chili, 3 pieces of thick cut pepper bacon to the meat, I added roasted anaheim peppers instead of Bell Peppers, and bumped up the chili powder to 1 tablespoon and instead of Canned beens I used red kidneys with an overnight soak and rinse prior to adding to the pot. Tomato paste with tomato sauce rather than puree.  10 hours on low came out great.

This was my first time doing a chili recipe, and using my brand new Crock Pot, I did half the recipe and didn't use the cannellini beans. My husband liked it a lot, and I enjoyed it, although I think I might try not using celery, I'm not a big fan of celery in general.

4 stars for quality basics. If you've never made chili, this is a great starting point. 1/8 teaspoon of pepper sauce is not nearly enough, but that's my taste. Add more pepper sauce and some spicy sausage and you're in championship form.

Love this recipe! I usually double it and add a pound of ground pork in it too. I also brown the meat with onions and peppers then also add raw onions and peppers to the crockpot.  Add a little extra hot sauce and ready to go!

Just made this and it was severely lacking in spice. Needed way more chili powder and oregano. I also added cumin and cinnamon. Flavor is now a lot better.

There are thousands of recipes for chili, each one the 'best' according to the cook. At first glance, I liked this one simply because it didn't include additional 'cumin' other than what is included in the chili powder.  Having said that, I note that this recipe might be the first choice of those who don't like 'spicy' chili. For those who consider themselves capable in the kitchen, this recipe can be successfully prepared with a boost to the seasoning - for me a BIG boost, but staying away from too much additional cumin-heavy chili powder. Of course, it's all a matter of personal taste.  I upped the green pepper and onion as a matter of preference, and the only additional ingredient I added that was not specified was two tablespoons of sugar - but then I add sugar with any recipe using any large quantity of tomato products. Given the outrageous variety of preferences for making chili, this recipe is a great starting point.

This is my go-to chili recipe. Perfect for game day! I made a few minor changes. I leave out the celery, use an orange bell pepper rather then green (personal preference), leave out one of the cans of red beans (I use one can of drained and rinsed red beans and one can undrained cannellini beans). I use an Italian spice blend in place if the oregano, basil and parsley and use 6-8 jalapeños (half of them deseeded and ribs removed) in place of the hot sauce (my family likes spicy, but it's mild enough even for our four year old). LOVE this chili!

Never thought of adding celery to chili, but we LIKED the crunch it added. This recipe is different than others we've tried, but we liked the change. Didn't have tomato purée on hand, so I used puréed Hot Rotel and it came out great!

Admittedly I usually use McCormick for chili (powdered packet), but I wanted to try something different using my crock pot. All my kids whined that I was "making chili AGAIN!" but then shocked us all when they loved it. I did not have cannellini beans, but used pinto beans with jalepenos instead and substituted crushed tomatoes for the puree. Definitely will be making again - thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe for kids who have severe food allergies. I used a little cayane pepper instead of hot sauce to accommodate  the allergies. Parents and kids loved it! I am asked every few weeks to make it again. Great recipe!

Hubs is a huge chili fan and loved it, but I felt pretty neutral. I omitted the celery, so maybe that's the punch it was missing.

First, it took longer than 15 mins to prep. But maybe I am slow. My other remark is that it was quite tasteless. Maybe it will be better next day? I will taste it tomorrow before finding an alternate recipe and adjust the seasoning accordingly. Granted, I used fresh parsley instead of dried (because I didn't have any) and I could have used a smoked chilli powder instead of regular. I did not have any cannellini beans so I used black beans instead. However, these changes should not be responsible for the lack of flavour. As it is, this is not a keeper.

Very bland, with an overwhelming tomato taste. The white beans didn't cook as well as the dark, and it wasn't very meaty.

I made this last night for a pot luck at the HighSchool. It was a big hit! I changed something's in the recipe. I used fresh oven roasted tomatoes instead of purée. I drained all my beans completely so for sauce I used a can of beef stock and half a bottle of Guinness. Added a jalapeño pepper for kick. With an hours cooking time left to go I felt that the flavors weren't coming together so I added a half tablespoon of taco seasoning. Wow! It didn't overpower the chile at all but rounded the taste off beautifully!

Great recipe. Made it for a church dinner and it was a big hit.
Thought it sounded like too much kidney beans so I added one can of kidney and one can of black beans and I skipped the cannellini beans. Used Tomato sauce instead of puree and it was fine.I'll use it again.

To me finding a good chili recipe is difficult. Many are missing something making them lack a fullness in the flavor. This is not a spicy recipe. I like that because I have small kids and I think so many recipes cover the fact that they are missing the full flavor by being spicy. "Dull the tastebuds so it seems good". This is nice the way it is or add to it.

For me, chili needs to taste like, well, chili! I originally made per the recipe but, like so many others, found it very bland and too much of a tomato flavor and not a chili flavor. I ended up adding a bit more than an additional 1.5 tbsp for a total of 2. Just this addition made it 5 stars for me :)

I truly love this recipe.  I make it often during the colder months.  For anyone who says that celery doesn't belong in chili, doesn't have an open mind.  It's virtually tasteless, but very healthy  and increases the fiber content of the chili.  It also is one of the top foods recommended by the Nat'l Institute of Health to help lower blood pressure.  Packed full of veggies, legumes and taste!  The recipe rocks!!

It's a good base recipe - and I have to admit I use it often. However, I choose to spice it up by throwing three minced jalapenos in it and bump up the chili powder to a full tablespoon - sometimes more. I remove the membranes and seeds from the jalapenos as my spouse can't handle too much heat and I shouldn't be handling too much - but if you like a bit of extra spice my advice is to keep the seeds and membranes in, add a bit more hot pepper sauce and maybe bump the chili powder up even further.

I really like this recipe, but while browning the ground beef, I added the seasonings (chilli powered, garlic, fresh parsley, oregano, basil and sea salt) to the meat while it was cooking.... Turned out amazingly delicious! I also added black beans, carrots, mushrooms and diced tomatoes, and added the black pepper in when I put all the veggies in the slow cooker and mixed it all together.

This had a lot of flavors. I didn't add celery, mainly because I forgot. It calls for 1/8 of a teaspoon of hot sauce(for 8 servicing), I put 1/8 teaspoon and 3 drops more in. I also put a can of chili beans and dices green chili tomatoes in. Will have to make again

I enjoyed this very much, though I partly agree with most of the critical observations.  Very different from most TX/NM styles. It has more tomato, more beans, and less red pepper than my favorite Texas chili, but it was a hit with my Midwestern friends and family.  Note:  I chose this recipe for an occasion where I wanted to please a wide range of ages--not too thick and not too spicy hot.

This recipe sounded good.So I followed the Recipe(except)for the cannellini beans.(I didn't have any.)Well I put it all together and after a few hours in the Crock,I tasted it.It was kinda Bland,& Missing something.I went in my spice rack,sniffed a few spices,then I found that missing spice.(Cumin). I added a little at a time(and I mean a shake at a time)tasted it.Did a little more,tasted,until that Chili taste appeared on my pallet (tounge).Then it was good,not over the top,but good.It was 1 thumb up & 1 thumb down.Would I make it again? Let's say I've had better,but it was good.

Added1/2 red bell pepper and used Victoria's Gourmet Texas Red Seasoning (1.5 tblsp) and salt only. I sautéed  the beef in green onion and omitted the other onion. It's perfect chili! Thanks for the recipe

This is a decent chili recipe.  I did alter a few things though.  I added diced tomatoes and tomato purée.  I also substituted chili beans for the cannellini beans.  I drained most of the liquid from the beans to thicken the chili slightly.  All in all good and I will make again.

Baba Booey to you all!!!

I made this recipe for my BFF and me, because we didn't wanna have to cook for a couple of days. This is a nice and tasty recipe. I used 2lbs of beef and just adjusted the seasonings, it turned out pretty yummy. I also used diced tomatoes instead of Puree because the grocery store I went to didn't have puree. I like the diced just fine.

This recipe is decent. It's not perfect, but decent. I think it could use a tad bit more umph. Like a bit is seasoning of some sort. I think it was made where anyone can add a little something to it. My weapon of choice for my own bowl was Cholula's Chili Lime sauce. That's what made it great. A few folks bash the recipe, but it is a good foundation for a chili you can make into your own. That's what many cooks do. Tweak to their liking and run with it. 4 stars.

I made a few adjustments, based on what I had at home. I used ground turkey instead of beef, an assortment of red, orange and yellow peppers instead of bell, no celery was used, additional chili powder and garlic was used, and I chopped two roma tomatoes and added two cans of Campbells tomato soup in place of tomato puree...I used one can of light red kidney beans, one can pinto beans, and one can black beans...Maybe the only things I kept from this recipe were the spices, onions, and portions of similar items, but regardless, this was an excellent recipe.

This is a great recipe. I have made it as stated on several occasions. As my confidence in myself grew I have experimented. I have used turkey instead of beef. Lean ground pork is excellent. I spice the meat with taco seasoning while cooking. I have tried different beans but have not liked the results.

We love this chili recipe, only the other times I made it I left the celery out and added more onions and carrots. celery in chili, not a success in our opinion.

I love everything in this chili, of course I like to add my own special touch, therefore I give this exact recipe a 4/5. I add a really good porter beer to this chili. Adds a great flavor and it's absolutly delicious. For people who don't care for beer, it doesn't taste like a beer that you drink. It just adds all the goodness from the beer, porters are full of flavor from the hops and wheat. A porter is a dark beer and it gives the chili a great boost of flavor. This chili is a great standard recipe, I add a little more veggies, I like a little more color in my chili. So add some yellow, red, and green bell peppers. Looks great.

This is an excellent recipe just as written.  I did make some changes to suit our tastes, but did not need to for the sake of the recipe.  I just wanted to make a double batch, so I added some ground sausage instead of extra ground beef and added a few different types of beans instead of just doubling the beans called for in the recipe.  I used kidney, pinto, black and boracho beans and I used 5 cans of beans and a can of stewed tomatoes.  I added the tomatoes towards the end, as I found that I had drained too much liquid from the beans and just needed a little more moisture.  By the way, I did save the liquid from the beans and used it along the way to add back into the chili if needed.  This is really a great recipe, and I have frozen a bunch of it to have for quick meals.  This is a keeper.

LOVED!!!!! this recipe. it was delicious. only teaked it slightly. I used 3/4 tsp hot sauce instead for a bit more of a kick, and 5 cloves of garlic. I also drained and rinsed the beans and didnt use the liquid from the. instead i used 1 large can of crushed tomatoes and used the liquid from that.
super delicious

I agree with the reviewers who said this is tasteless. 
As is, it lacks flavor: it tastes like ground beef in tomato sauce.  After doing a search on chili seasoning, I ended up adding some cumin and doubling most of the ingredients listed and it's still a little iffy at this point.

This was delicious! I think the celery was a great addition - makes it a hearty chili. My friends have enjoyed this recipe in the past, and I'm making it again for the Superbowl tonight. Very glad I found this recipes!
Note: I have been adding stewed tomatoes to the chili, taste great!

This recipe is really good. I gave it 4 stars because I added more chili powder and cumin during the last couple of hours to make it more flavorful. I sauteed the veggies and some seasoning with the beef and added some frozen corn. I served it over spaghetti with some shredded cheddar, light sour cream and jalapenos. Overall easy and tasty.

Good-flavored chili. Certainly not overly hot, so I will add more hot sauce next time. I used diced tomatoes and only left in 1/2 liquid from one can of the kidneys. It could have been thicker. Maybe the pureed tomatoes would have made the difference, but I saw the fire-roasted diced tomatoes and went that route.

We love this recipe.  We make it in a large crock pot on a cold day and serve it with shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream.  My husband adds a little hot sauce to his.  It's just as good leftover--we freeze a few individual containers for lunches.

I finally made chili for the first time last night and it turned out really really good. I added a teaspoon of cumin and added extra spices as I made quiet a bit.
I will definitely make this again. Thanks for the great and easy recipe.

A great way to make chili.  I especially like the combination of beans.  Black beans also work well with this recipe.  Another plus was using the tomato puree instead of tomato sauce or diced tomatoes.  The puree looked too thick at first, but gave the chili the perfect amount of liquid at the end.  Instead of using ground beef, I used ground turkey which is healthier.  I did not noticed any difference.  I thought the amount of spices should be increased as the chili tasted bland.  I doubled most of the spices in my recipe.  I also included cumin as others suggested.  Actually cumin as one of the ingredients used in the store bought chili seasonings from McCormick.  Overall, this is a good recipe that I'll make again and again.

I actually combined this with the Emily's Chipotle Chili recipe, and decided I would rate both. This recipe was the perfect base recipe, I followed it perfectly. However, I added chiptoles in adobo sauce and that made all the difference. I'm used to bland recipes for homemade chili and this was the complete opposite. I believe I can use this as a base for turkey chili and vegetarian because it was that good. Thank you for sharing. I topped with dumplings, because well, why not.

Delicious!  Next time, i will add more chili powder , cayenne, and more green pepper.  Used stew beef and that was really good.

Never been a chili fan, but this looked good...My fiancé and I LOVED this...I did change it, instead of ground beef, I used ground turkey, also I didn't add the celery...I used one can of tomato puree and one can of diced tomatoes...I made it in the middle of October, my fiancé asked for it again the beginning of November...Guess it's a keeper...

This chili recipe is absolutely amazing. It's not even done yet and I can't keep my spoon out the pot. I followed the recipe almost to a "t." I added a can of diced tomatoes cause I like my chili chunky and I sautéed the trinity (onions, peppers and celery) in spices. I also added cumin and cayenne cause I like it spicy. Oh yeah and I used ground turkey cause were not big on beef in my house. Absolutely amazing. I'll never use another chili recipe.

I made some of the same changes that others talked about.  I didn't put in the celery and I drained two of the cans of beans.  Next time I would add a can of diced tomatoes and green chiles to give it a bit more spice and I would also add corn.  I am thinking of trying a can of black beans in place of one of the cans of kidney beans as well to give it some more flavor.  My daughter is a pretty picky eater and she even liked the flavor so that says a lot.

This recipe is really good and very easy. I made this in a tiny 1.5 qt. slow cooker with the following modifications: no celery, ~3/4 lb. ground beef, 1 can tomato puree, 1 can kidney beans (drained), ~3/4 can cannellini beans (drained), cayenne pepper, red pepper, no parsley, no hot sauce.  I'm always a bit heavy-handed on the spices, so I probably used more of those. 

I threw the onion and green bell pepper on a saute pan for a few minutes, and then added the meat, followed by the garlic. Lots of salt and pepper. Cooked until meat was brown, and then threw everything in the slow cooker. Also, I only let it cook on low for ~6 hours. 

The result was flavorful, pleasantly spicy, and reallllllly thick. It's a bit more tomato-y than I normally make my chili, but it wasn't a bad thing. This recipe is a keeper.

This was very good.  I tripled the recipe (except the meat - only doubled) based on the large cans of tomato puree I bought and made it with ground turkey.  Very filling, meaty and tasty.  My son and husband aren't fond of beans and this had a lot of them.  Son ate them, husband no so much.  Overall I would make this again making it spicier (it is very mild in my opinion).  Thanks for a great recipe.

Made this yesterday early morning to have for dinner.  Weather report was that it was going to be overnight freezing so figured this would hit the spot for dinner.  It so did.  The best chili I've ever made.  Just changed the type of beans I used (didn't want to run to the store), and actually cook it on the stove for about 3 hours and then let it fester the rest of the day there until dinner.  Reheated it, and as I said before "IT HIT THE SPOT".  This will be my New Chili Recipe.

The recipe is ok (with some changes for my tastes).  I omitted the celery. I substituted ground turkey (I don't eat red meat), used red pepper instead of green, added one can of yellow corn, increased it to 4 cloves of garlic, 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne, and 1 teaspoon of hot sauce (I like it pretty spicy).  With those changes it came out great!

I too made a few adjustments from the base recipe, I added a 1/2 tablespoon of ground chipotle pepper and two cans (10 oz each) of "pieces and stems" mushrooms (don't forget to drain them!) since my wife vehemently despises green pepper.  I thought it was a bit bland for our liking, so I added a teaspoon of sea salt and one packet of stevia artificial sweetener.  Very very tasty chili!
