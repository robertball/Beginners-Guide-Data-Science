I absolutely fell in love with this dish!  I did use turkey breakfast sausage to accommodate some health needs in our house but the flavor was still there.  I topped it with homemade Pico De Gallo and sour cream.  Next time I want to try to crisp the potatoes up a bit in the pan before serving to see what we like better.  I loved the spices mixed in with the eggs and the fresh balance of the other ingredients.

Delicious dish for lunch today :) I absolutely loved the addition of chili powder. Only changes I made...I peeled the potatoes, and added a bit of cream to the eggs after whisking them (this helps to make scrambled eggs more fluffy). Ate them with tiny tortillas :) 5star!!
