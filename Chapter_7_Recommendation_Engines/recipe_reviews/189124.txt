Yummy!!!  I made this with cilantro lime rice, also from this site, and used it in burritoes.  It is also a great with tortilla chips.  I don't like green peppers, so I used a sweet orange pepper.  Also, I didn't have any jalepeno on hand, so I substituted a pablano pepper.  Very tasty.  When I open a can of chipotle in adobo, I blend it and keep in in the fridge or freeze in small amounts.  I suggest adding a little at a time to reach your desired heat level.  Next I will try this on fish tacos!

Made this for a super bowl party. It definately has a lot of heat and for the less adventurous you can try one jalapeno OR omit the cayenne pepper. Great with Carne Asada.

Excellent and easy.  It was a big hit at the party.  Ironically, the store must have had a run on jalape√±os as they were out.  I substituted 1 fresco instead (they are a little hotter).  Definite, must make again.

I did not have the cilantro on hand and did without.  I also had yellow onion instead of red.  The fresh lime juice  makes a  huge difference.  I will try it again with all the ingredients and some tomatoes from my garden.

Amazing!! I was afraid the jalapenos would be too much so I substituted a poblano pepper. So so good and even better the next day and the day after.

I really enjoyed this.  It's even better with beans.
