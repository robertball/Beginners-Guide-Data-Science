I made this today for lunch. It was so much better than any vegan roll I've had in a restaurant. I added bamboo shoots, cucumber, sesame seeds and lemon. Next time in going to add jalape√±o and cabbage. I didn't have a bamboo roller so I used plastic wrap. It worked great. I think I'm going to have this for dinner too, it was that good. I will add edamame to my dinner though.
