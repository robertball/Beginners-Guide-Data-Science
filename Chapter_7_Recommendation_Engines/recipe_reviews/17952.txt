I was given this recipe for a semester-long class assignment in which I had to alter the recipe to have 33% less sodium, 33% less calories, and replace the white rice with a whole grain.  I did this over 5 weeks, with a different test substitution.  The successful substitutions included: brown rice, elimination of the mushroom soup and using a whole can of Campbell's healthy request chicken soup, reducing the cheese by one cup and using a 75% reduced fat cheddar cheese instead of the two types of cheese.  The dish continued to be the favorite of the class after each substitution.  Hope everyone tries these easy substitutions!

Here's what I've done to make this recipe simpler.  I put the chicken in the skillet with the onion and brown them both.  I add the salsa and soups to the chicken and simmer till chicken is done.  I make rice as normal.  I mix the cheses right on the wax paper or parchment paper I shred it on.  I layer as directed.  Saves some pots!

This is a great base recipe, but quite bland as written.  I am rating this 3 stars based on modifcations to boost the flavor.  HELPFUL HINTS:  Saute your chicken with chicken taco seasonings and the chopped onion, set aside.  Use prepared brown or spanish rice vs white rice.  Added one can of minced ortega chilis, 1 tsp of minced garlic (such as Spice World) and 1 tsp of cumin to the soup (used healthy request/low sodium soup) mixture and then proceded to follow the directions.  Substituted 1 cup of the Montery Jack for Pepper Jack cheese for an extra flavor boost.  DEFINITELY much more flavorful!

I only made two changes to this recipe, the first was I used a can of rotel instead of salsa and the second was that I mixed the rice and soup mixture together before layering.  I put this together in the morning and than baked it in the afternoon, I covered it with reynolds non-stick foil and cooked it for 30 minutes removing the foil and baking for the last 10 minutes this keeps the cheese moist and stringy instead of crusty
My whole family enjoyed this and it was even good the next day as leftovers in my husbands lunch This recipe is very adaptable you can make it as spicy your family likes.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe.

I was looking for a quick dinner with the ingredients I had on hand and this far exceeded my expectations.  I cut up the chicken first and browned it with some southwestern seasoning and the onions, some fresh minced garlic and a bell pepper that I sauteed.  I also added some frozen corn to the soup/salsa mixture.  I served it with some extra salsa, sour cream and dice jalapenos on the side.  The whole family loved it and are looking forward to the leftovers.

Yummy. It has the potential for 5 stars. Definitely decrease the rice. I did decrease the rice and thought I could reduce it even more. I simmered some onions and garlic before adding the soup and salsa. I think you could add more salsa. I would mix it all together next time with cheese on top.

This was pretty darn good! My husband even liked it, and he is the pickiest in the family. I did tweak it a little bit, but stuck to the basics: I sauteed the onion along with some bell pepper, celery, and minced garlic.  Instead of doing the alternating layers, I put all of the rice in first, then the chicken, then the soup mixture, then the cheese. I also didn't use as much cheese as the recipe called for - I only used about a cup at the most. I took another reviewer's advice and covered it with foil for the first 30 minutes then uncovered for the remaining 10 minutes. It turned out great, with a bit of sour cream on top. I think I will make this again, and maybe add a can of corn and possibly some black beans. I also agree with another review that said this would be good as a filler for burritos.  I think I'll try that today for lunch.  :) Thanks so much for sharing!

This tasted really good.  It is very similar to my mom's ckn & rice cass. except she doesn't use salsa.  I made a couple of changes in order for this to work for me.  First, I like to cook my chicken with flavor so I seasoned it with salt pepper and garlic powder.I then mixed the soups and rotel (didn't have salsa).  I used this mixture instead of water to cook my chicken.  I cooked it on medium stirring frequently so the mixture wouldn't scorch on the bottom.  I removed the chicken and diced.  I mixed all the rice and soup mixture together and then added the chicken.  I topped it with cheese (I reduced the amount to save a few calories) and popped it into the oven.  By the way, this recipe makes a ton.  We will be having this for lunch today and dinner tonight.

This was an easy but very satisfying meal. I too made the rice separate and combined and put into the oven. That was the only real change except cooking the onions with the chicken. If you don't the onions have a real crunch and are much stronger. I have made both ways and cooked onions is definitely the way to go with this one. Thanks for a great recipe.

very tasty--everything gets mushy together in the casserole--but that's good too!  For an additional kick I crumbled tortilla chips on top of the mixture when serving

HELPFUL TIPS: You can obviously use 2 can of cream of chicken OR mushroom if you're out of one.  Don't stress over amount of cheese.  Use enough to cover a layer in the middle and a layer on top.  If you're in a hurry, use tyson chicken and just cube (~3.5-4 cups).  If you use breasts, I just cube FIRST then put in skillet (with a little oil) for 12-14 min.  Always done, and then you don't have to wait for it to cool to cube.  I then mix in the same chicken skillet the salsa and soups.  Usually I use less chicken in recipes, but I'm glad I didn't w/this.  I am SO GLAD I didn't listen to the review about using less rice!!!!  It was the PERFECT amount to layer very thinly one layer on bottom and then middle.  Can't imagine using even a tiny less esp. if you're using the entire soup/chicken mixture (and why wouldn't you) ;)  BTW, I Spread out the rice with ...yes, my hands as it's the easiest. You REALLY should cover this with foil so it doesn't dry out.  I actually had to use my hand to push the casserole down a bit so the cheese wouldn't touch the foil and also had to foil more of a dome with the foil for the same reason.  It makes a lot which is good.  Leftovers are great in a busy house!  This is a great recipe to make ahead, put in fridge, and bake later.

I loved this recipe and it was fantastic on a cold rainy day! I actually made this in the crock pot, because I have a crazy schedule. For me, cooking a little at a time works best. So I put 4 frozen chicken breasts in the crock pot with the salsa and onions and cooked on high for about 3 1/2- 4 hrs. I cooked brown rice in the rice cooker and after the chicken was very tender I pulled it apart with a fork, added the soups and half the cheese called for. I actually used Shredded 2% mild cheddar. I let that cook on low for about another hour, stirred in the rice and served with tortillas on the side. It was fabulous! My kids and fiancee raved about this one

Followed the recipe as written, but for the layering. Didn't have time to screw with layers, so I mixed it all up. We liked it well enough. Wouldn't hesitate to make it again. Made it extra healthy (LOL) by crushing doritos on top.

If I could give this recipe 10 stars, I would! My picky husband, and SUPER picky kids love this recipe! I generally make it the way it states on the recipe first, and then the next time, I'll check through the reviews to see what others tweaked. I've done it a variety of ways, and none have dissapointed. Fantastic recipe... now part of my permanent rotation! Thank you!

I used some of the suggestions for adding more flavor, hot pepper cheese, seasoning chicken & cooking with onions.  I dislike cream of mushroom so I went the cream of chicken route & some low fat sour cream.  My other trick, on Sundays I get my rice cooker out & make 2-3 pots of rice.  I LOVE white rice, sorry not giving it up.  Serve it with fish, fried rice with chicken, it is a great side.  I then package the rice in serving size freezer bags & freeze.  During the week I pop it in the microwave in a glass casserole with lid & I am read to go.  I like to cook, but hate it when it is a chore.  I also cook my hamburger & freeze.  Then I can thaw & season & go.

Rather than boiling the chicken (EWWW) I sauteed it with garlic and onion and mushrooms , made for a much tastier dish .... used less rice, hot salsa, half the fat cream of chicken soup and cut the total amount of cheese in half ... quite nice with those changes

This was a simple, great recipe, comprised of ingredients that are usually on hand!  I did make a few changes...1) Cubed raw chicken and cooked in a skillet with the onion, added salt, pepper and garlic powder. 2) Mixed the soup with cheese, rice, and salsa...added a packet of taco seasoning. 3) Mixed the chicken/onion mixture with the soup mixture, then poured into casserole (i.e. No layering - just mixed it all together) 4) Topped with cheese and baked covered with foil for 30 minutes, 10 minutes uncovered.

This is not a 'pretty' dish but it was tasty. I simplified it by cutting up chx in advance and cooking most of the way with the onion in one skillet before assembling and baking. I seasoned it of course with what we like like, chipotle chili powder etc. but everyone will season as desired. I do believe that the leftovers, sprinkled liberally with Frank's Red hot sauce, are a very effective cure for a hangover. Thanks for the recipe!

Salsa Chicken Rice Casserole Haiku: "Pretty tasty meal. I changed a couple small things, but liked it alot." I halved the recipe, using only 1 can of cream of chicken soup, that I'd mixed w/ the salsa, and a heavy sprinkle of "taco seasoning I" from AR, along with the onions that I'd lightly sauteed, b/c I didn't want them raw. I had leftover shredded chicken, so that saved me the effort of boiling and chopping the chicken breast. Layered and baked it as written, and my only complaint was that I think there was too much rice, and the recipe could maybe benefit from some additional ingredients, like black beans, corn, or squash. Otherwise, it was fun to put it together, though it didn't scoop out onto my plate looking as nice as it did in the baking dish, but appearances aside, tasted pretty darn good.

Very good.  I will be making again.  I did mix the rice and soup together to save a dish and I felt it would be better that way.  Very wonderful dish.

Boo yeah! This casserole kicked arse! I substituted brown rice and used chicken thighs and made my mom's secret homemade salsa for it and it came out peeeerfect! I made it a night ahead for the puppysitter who was in the house the next day.  I walk in and immediately she says: "Sorry, but I ate lots of that casserole you left...it was too good, I couldnt' stop eating!"  No biggie!

I should also mention that since I live alone, I usually halve recipes and this one halved beautifully!

I made this the other day for my 17 year old son. He told me "I out did myself". Well that gives this recipe a 5 star review in my book. My son is the most picky eater ever. Thanks for a great recipe. By the way I did not layer it. I mixed it all together except the cheese. I topped it with the cheese and baked.

I did the entire recipe without any pre-cooking.  Placed in fridge overnight  and cooked it as specified.  Excellent.  Will put this in my rotation.

Very good! Like others I cooked the chicken w/the onions to save some time and threw in 1/2 pkt taco seasoning, 1 t chipotle chili pwdr, 1 T minced garlic and red and green bell peppers.  Also used a pkt of Uncle Ben's Ready Rice (spanish style) which cooks in 90 seconds.  I reduced the soup to 1 can and the cheese to 1 cup - I think I will go with even less cheese next time. Served with mexi-corn, ff refried beans, ff sour cream, high fiber tortillas, and chipotle salsa.  Yum!!

I made this for lunch at church.  Instead of layering, I mixed it all together.  It was a hit!

I found this to be very bland until I "bumped it up"!  Added about 2 tsp cumin, 1 tsp chili powder and 1/4 tsp cayenne.  Also added 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup frozen corn.  I also topped it with a few crushed tortilla chips which added a nice texture change.  At the table I served it with additional salsa and hot sauce on the side.  Once the heat was added we loved it.  My husband actually had seconds!  Will definitely make again with the above changes.

***As written, this recipe is a 3 b/c it's Bland. W/ my modifications, it's a 4. *Sauteed onion w/ chicken and seasoned it with my own "taco seasoning". (I used 3 boneless chicken breasts)
*Reserved about less than 1/2 cup of the chicken broth and poured it in w/ the chicken & onion. 
*I used 1/2 cup of monterey cheese & 1/2 cup of cheddar, mixed it w/ 1 can of cream of chicken soup, then add it to the chicken.
*I steamed the brown rice(I use 1 cup), but added 1 TBS of chicken bouillon in the water. 
*After the rice is done, I add it to the chicken mixture, then mix in 1 cup of my homemade salsa verde, add more seasoning if needed, MIX EVERYTHING WELL, then pour the whole thing into the foiled casserole dish. (easy clean up)
*Cover w/ foil for 30MINS and then leave it off for the remaining 10MINS. 
*I let it set for at least 20MINS, then eat! MMMMM!

Everyone but the kids loved it.  I did take another reviewers suggestion and I mixed the rice in with the sauce.  Put half in the pan then layered all the chicken, half the cheese then put the rest of the rice mixture on top with the rest of the cheese.

I made as written and it was quite bland. Needs seasoning such as cilantro or cumin. I should have used my better judgement and added.

This is a great, easy recipe... and a flexible one.  I used Mexican Blend shredded cheese and Pepper Jack cheese in lieu of Monterey Jack and Cheddar.  I omitted the onion, and I used a Chipotle salsa.   The outcome was just as fabulous, with a little more 'kick'.  It was a hit with the boys.  I also combined the soups with the chicken to reduce the number of dishes. And layered as suggested.

Great recipe!  I cut up the chicken and sauted then added garlic, 1/2 a small can of diced jalapenos, 1 can of diced tomatoes, 1 can of corn and 1 tsp of cumin.  I cooked this for about10 minutes until some of the juices had cooked down.  I used 2 cans of cream of chickn and I added 1 large bunch of green onions instead of a regular onion.  Used just cheddar instead of Monterey Jack.  Got rave reviews from the hubby!  This is one I will definately make again and again!

I followed this recipe exactly and the onion was WAY too strong in it. No one in my family would eat it but me! I will probably try this one again, but either leave out the onions or saute them first in some olive oil.

This was not at all thrilling. I wanted to give it 2.5 stars. Thank goodness I added some extras to make it edible - cumin, chili, a can of black beans and some corn. Wont make this one any time soon.

This is an easy, very tasty casserole which was a huge hit with everyone.  I made it almost exactly as written.  The only thing I changed was to add a layer of black beans and a layer of frozen corn on top of the rice, then top with remaining ingredients.  Iit doesn't remain layered (like lasagne) when served, so I just used one layer of each ingredient.  This will be in my regular casserole rotation.  Thanks!

I liked this; my husband thinks it needs more kick, perhaps a dash of Tabasco or some chili powder. I thought it was fine as is. Could be served as a filling for warmed tortillas.

The first time I made this recipe, it was ok. I made a few modifications, and it is a family favorite now. 
To add a lot of flavor, I'd suggest using Newman's own corn & bean salsa in the recipe. Then after plating, add some regular tomato salsa and some diced avacado on top. Eat with scoop tortilla chips. Sooo much better. 
I also simplified and used instant rice, a bag of pre-mixed cheddar jack, and added the chicken to the soup/onion mixture. Very fast and east recipe.

Very good. I added a little extra salsa. I also added Franks Red Hot Sauce to taste until it was as spicy as I wanted. I sauteed the onions in butter and pepper and garlic salt and added celery. I also added a can of corn. Someone mentioned it was too much rice for them. I did not find this to be even close to true. I will definately make it again, but I will try it with 2 cups of cheese. The words "too much cheese" have never crossed my lips.. til now. To save time and dishes next time I will mix it all together then top it with cheese and bake it. Might fry the chicken next time too. Its good, enjoy.

Love, love, love this recipe ... first for the easiness and second for the deliciousness!!  I make mine even easier by using canned chicken ... (2) 9.75 oz. canned chicken breast, and cut down the fat by using 3 cups shredded cojack.  Lastly, I only use the can of condensed cream of chicken soup and don't use the cream of mushroom.  I throw in a can of drained mushrooms instead.  Thought 2 cans of soup made it too "soupy".  Oh, and medium salsa instead of mild.  My family LOVES it!!

This is great! I changed things a bit too and tried to make it a little healthier. I made brown rice in one pot and then boiled chicken in 1 can of chicken broth (14 oz) in a separate pan. I added frozen corn, green peppers and onions to the chicken broth. When that was all cooked, I layered the pan with rice, salsa and cream of chicken soup (only 1 can), then chicken (drained the broth) and topped with reduced fat mexican cheese (8 oz package). Was very good- probably only needed to be in the oven for about 15 or 20 minutes because the chicken was a little overcooked, but overall will make it again!

I had to make several adjustments for this to be good for my family.  Plain, poached chicken is extremely bland so I cubed it before cooking and then sauteed it with salt, and onion and garlic powder.  Then fat and calories in this is too much to take so I just used the 98% fat free soups and no one can tell the difference.  I layered as directed but the onion on the top layer doesn't cook through.  The rest of the casserole is cooked through and then there are these odd pieces of raw onion.  I hate raw onion so I had to cover with foil and baked nearly twice as long as the recipe instructs.  End result was good but will definitly finely dice the onion, saute the chicken, continue using the low-fat soup, and cover the dish while baking next time.

I loved this recipe.  It was easy to make and fairly quick.  I used left over grilled chicken and I made the rice.  I used a medium picante sauce instead of salsa.  Everything went together easy enough and the taste was yummy.  My kids (ages 7 and 8) didn't like but couldn't tell me why!  Who knows!  I loved it and will make it again!

My husband and I really liked this.  I made some minor changes such as using hot salsa because we like dishes with a little bite to them.  I also added a little fresh cilantro and cumin and about 2 cloves of garlic.  I will definitely make this again but next time I will make more rice since I think it needed a little more.  But overall I think this is a wonderful recipe.

Used canned and frozen grilled chicken strips. While rice was cooking (1 cup) I sauteed half a large yellow onion and 4 minced garlic cloves in olive oil. Then added 2 handfuls of frozen grilled chicken strips. Let those warm up a bit and sprinkled a little chile powder, garlic salt, and pepper over them. Added mild and medium salsa (1 cup each) to the same pan. Stirred and added both soups. Then added one 12.5 oz can of chicken (which was perfect because there was chicken in every bite). Mixed in cooked rice and spread in  9x13 greased glass pan. Sprinkled Mexican Cheddar Jack cheese and Mozzarella cheese when half the mixture was in dish. Put rest of chicken mix in then topped with remaining 2 cups of cheese. Baked uncovered about 15 min. Turned out very yummy. Has a little kick but not enough to scare off my kids. Would be great with a side iceberg salad. I could see this being a hit as a potluck dish.

This was a great dish! I also adjusted the original recipe. I included a can of black beans (rinsed) and a can of mexicorn and a can of green chilies.  I also mixed taco blend cheese with the monterey jack and cheddar and used jasmine rice instead of white rice. I did layer it as the recipe instructed. I used a rotisserie chicken for ease which I cut up and sauteed with onion and a half package of chicken taco seasoning.  It was topped w/ sour cream, green onion and some salsa. We put it into warmed four tortillas. My family loved it.

I only made 2 changes. I used brown rice instead of white (gotta love whole grain), and I used all cheddar cheese cause it's all I had. 
It wasn't very flavorful and my husband wouldn't even touch the leftovers. This recipe is a good base but it definitely needs some added spice and flavor to make it great.

This was a tasty little dish. I cut the recipe and half so I just used one can cream of chicken, no mushroom. I added about a tsp or so of taco seasoning to the sauce mixture.  I used left over white rice and just added a little fresh cilantro and lime juice to flavor it.  I seasoned the chicken with Adobo all-purpose seasoning and used red onion.  I think this recipe would have been tasty as is too, I just added a hint more flavor. A nice change up from my usual American-Mexican dishes.

This was pretty good, kids loved it.  I cooked the rice in the microwave to same time. Added some cumin and chili powder.   Next time, I will split it into two pans, one original for the kids and the other with lots of jalapenos and black beans for my husband and I.  Thank you!

This was definitely easy. Used rotissorie chicken instead of cooking. Agree with others that the casserole defitinely needed some seasoning. I would mix in some taco seasoning or salt and pepper next time. Added hot sauce to kick it up a notch for my husband  and I. Covered for 30 mins and then uncovered for the rest.

Yummy!   I used brown rice instead of white.  Used 1/2 the amount of cheese (2% milk).  I used medium heat salsa.  Also I seasoned the chicken with chicken bullion seasoning while boiling.  I had read the other reviews stating that this was a little bland so I tried spicing it up a little from the beginning.  This turned out really good.  Cheesy, creamy and filling.  Y'all were right...it's better the next day.  Maybe adding some fat free sour cream to the top right before serving would be good.

I did not follow the recipe exactly: boiled the chicken with onion, garlic and seasoned salt, used the chicken stock to cook the rice and added diced green chilies, canned corn (drained) and diced tomatoes with jalapenos to the rice. Otherwise, followed the recipe and it was very tasty. I will definitely make this again!

It's almost the end of the month and i couldn't afford go to the store, so I decided to make this since I had everything.  I almost cried when I tasted this.  I should've know it wouldn't be to my liking when I got a look at the soup/salsa mixture...the color did not look good, but I thought the cooking would make it fine.  When it came out of the oven it looked great, but the tasted wasn't so great.  The rice from the bottom of the dish was crunchy from the baking and it didn't have much flavor.  I'm sad because I used all my ingrediants and still have a few days until payday.

We just finished eating this (followed the recipe exactly) and cannot even begin to describe how much we loved it!!!! This is a very hearty and delicious casserole that I will definitely be making again... and again... and again! The only change I might make is maybe put in a bit more salsa. Thank you for the recipe!

Very good! I did put a can of rotel in to spice it up, and you can combine everything in one skillet, makes it a bit easier.  Definetly better left over!  We also put a dollop of sour cream on top when we served it!

This is a simple recipe that used what I had in my pantry.  I didn't layer it, I think that probably helps with mixing the flavors.  It was tasty though and I'll make it again.

This casserole is easy and AMAZING! Flavor balance is awesome....it's just great. It's totally great if you follow the recipe to the "t"; the only thing I changed was using 3c reduced fat cheddar cheese to cut the calories a little & upped the salsa by 1/2 c. I might make a little more rice next time, but that's a personal preference. Also, if you like a little kick, use a medium salsa instead of mild.
****UPDATE****: I've made this dish several times & have experimented & served to multiple people & have additional notes: To really cut the fat & cal but not the taste, use 98% fat free cr. of chicken & mushroom soups & 2 1/2-3c reduced fat cheddar cheese. This makes a HUGE nutritional impact & does not significantly affect taste!!! Also, you can cut the chicken by 30% with no impact to enjoying the dish & it FREEZES BEAUTIFULLY!!!

I made it following the recipe exactly. Very tasty and easy to make. Only problem is onion comes out very crunchy. Onion should probably be cooked ahead of time with the chicken.

This is really good! I cubed the chicken and browned it with the onion in a skillet . Followed the rest of the recipe as written. I really like the salsa in it,gives it a lttle kick and you could always make it more spicy if that suits you taste. I liked it just the way it was. Great recipe.

I cut the recipe in half and only used cheddar cheese because I didn't have Monteray Jack on hand.  Next time I think I will use both cheeses, add extra salsa and mix the rice with the salsa mixture before layering and add cheese on top like others suggested.  I also added a dollop of sour cream per serving.

I made this recipe tonight for dinner.  It was very good. I used Uncles Ben Brown Rice b/c that's all we buy in my household. I also used 2 cups of cheese which I found mixed together by Kraft.  It turned out just as good.

I changed this around because I had made really yummy mexican rice II the night before. I sauted onions, few cloves garlic, and 1 green bell pepper then added the cut up chicken breasts. Seasoned with pepper and a little creole seasoning.Browned and then added only salsa and cream of chcken soup. Simmered and then before serving added the cheese(1/2 of what recipe called for)It was really good

I thought that this recipe was just okay.  It was really soupy, and the onions weren't done all the way.  It was missing something, but I really couldn't say what.  I won't be making it again.

We loved this recipe.  Only made a few minor changes : 2 cream of chicken soups (low fat), cooked the chicken in a frying pan with some onion, garlic, & season salt, used medium salsa.  Will definitely make again & again.  Only thing for others to note, you must use 4 cups of cooked rice as opposed to uncooked measure of 1 1/3, these are not the same amounts.  Thank you so much!

I really enjoyed this recipe, but I made a few changes - I halved it because I only cook for myself, and whatever friends come over to steal leftovers. I used chopped green pepper and sliced mushrooms in addition to onion. I used medium salsa,  brown rice, and chicken that I grilled on my George Foreman grill. I used the Mexican blend cheese and also added cilantro, and it turned out terrific! I'll be putting this in tortillas for lunch tomorrow.

This was wonderful, but that is with the following changes...rice cooked in chicken broth, omit the cream of mushroom soupand chopped onion. After the first layer of chicken give the whole thing a generous shake of southwest seasoning. Very quick and very easy!!!

We thought this was terrific! I was doubtful as I layered this that there would be any taste but when it was all said and done, we thought it was great! We had to add a little S&P but other than that, I didn't change a thing and would make again. Next time, I may add a little more chicken as the meal is predominatly rice and heat can easily be adjusted based on the type of salsa you use. Thanks Tami!

I love this recipe!  I recently made this for my sister, a vegetarian, and her children.  I just added two cream of mushroom soups and served the chicken on the side.  Her family loved it.  Tastes great in flour tortillas or with tortilla chips.

I really liked this recipe, we ate it for days! I loved the chopped, uncooked sweet onions in it. I used brown rice instead of white, and Pace Chunky Salsa. With the meal I served extra salsa on the side, plus generous helpings of baked tortilla chips. You could use this recipe as a nacho-topper!

This recipe is the perfect week night meal that's incredibly kid and husband friendly. My only change was mixing the cooked chicken with some taco sauce and of course, added in more seasonings. Great recipe and thank you!!

This recipe is delicious and incredibly easy to make!  We loved it so much, I made a second batch the day after I made the first!  I made it almost exactly as the recipe directed, with one exception being that I used Pepper Jack cheese (rather than Monterey Jack), since I had it on hand. The second time I made the recipe, I made a couple other substitutions, just to use up some other items in my pantry.  I used 2 cans of Cream of Celery soup (in place of the Cream of Mushroom and Cream of Chicken that the recipe suggests.)  I also used exclusively cheddar cheese, since I had a lot in the fridge.  It turned out well even with those changes. When I make this again, I'll use Pepper Jack and Cheddar; that really povided nice flavor, color and texture!

I made this recipe last night with left over Turkey from Thanksgiving.  I did change it up a bit.  Instead of using soup, I used white cheese queso.  I also added diced green chilis.  Also as many of the reviews suggested I mixed the rice, turkey and sauce together.  I put a layer in my dish sprinkled half of the cheese added the remaining portion and sprinkled the rest of my cheese.  I toped it off with crushed doritos.  I had really good flavor.  I think the queso made a big difference because it had so much seasoning to it alone.  My husband really liked it and he isn't a caserole person.  I think had I not used the queso and added the chilis it would have been really lacking on the flavor as many people had said.

Pretty average and not something I would make again with out some serious tweeking! I increased the salsa to 2 cups of spicy homemade salsa, used brown rice and decreased the cheese to 2 cups (one cup mexican blend, one cup pepper jack). If I were to make again I would use sour cream in place instead of the cream soups. Also add some spices (maybe garlic, cumin, chili powder...). Thanks for the recipe.

Pretty Good.  Decreased cooking time a lot by sauteing onion in pan 2 min, then adding cubed raw chicken and cooking till chicken no longer pink and onion opague.  Seasoned Chicken with Onion, Garlic & Chili Powder as well as black pepper.  Added can of soup and salsa to skillet, stirred till well blended then mixed in cooked rice.  Layered bottom of pan with Tortilla Chips, then mixture then cheese.  Would also be good with chips on top of mixture, underneath cheese.  Baked at 350 for 20 min.  Cut this recipe in half (family of 4 with two kids under 6).  Used 2 Chicken breasts, 3/4 cup rice (cooked in 1 1/2cup water), 1 can cream of chicken & mushroom soup 1 small onion, 3/4 - 1 cup salsa.  1 cup cheese. Baked in 8x8 casserole dish.  next time would add black beans (rinsed and drained) to mixture.  Could also add corn & diced red pepper (would saute with the onion).

We made it a one skillet dish - brown onion & garlic & chicken, add soups, salsa, rice, frozen corn and some water, stirred it up and let simmer on the stove top.  Then we added cheese at the end--stirred some in & sprinkled the rest on top. 

It was very tasty, but next time we'll probably use chicken broth in place of cream of chicken soup, we'll use canned tomatoes & our own spices instead of salsa, and add a package of hot green chile.

Yummy Yummy Yummy.  My husband loves this receipe.  I did use rotel instead of salsa and I mix it all together instead of layering.  Otherwise all ingredients the same.

Was disappointed with this one. I mixed the soups and salsa together. I layered the rice, chicken, soup mixture and cheese. I expected this to be more flavorful. Will not make again.

I omitted mushroom soup (wife hates mushrooms) and onion (none handy). I also cut the recipe in half and cooked it in an 8x11 casserole dish. Came out bubbling hot after 20 minutes at 400 degrees. Perfectly easy recipe. It requires a little more clean up than I like, but overall it's worth it.

Very good! I used Pepper Jack cheese for more kick. If this is even possible to say...it was too much cheese. I'll 1/2 it next time.

Well, this was really good! I had most all the ingredients on hand but wasn't sure it would be that good. Soup mixed with salsa? I sauteed the chicken with some onions,  chili powder, and s&p on the stove top since I didn't want to boil it. Then followed the recipe exactly for prep, but used cheddar since that was all I had.  So good. Plus I reheated in the oven for leftovers and it was even better.  My DH hates reheated chicken but thought this was great. Simple, filling and tasty.

Good and easy.  I did take a shortcut though, instead of boiling up some chicken, I used a rotisserie chicken and shredded the chicken.  And I did as some reviewers and added in a can of black beans.  Will be making this again.

I had left over rice, (3 days old). I had all other ingredients, so this was easy for me. I used one pot and browned chicken, (seasoned with Tony Chachery), in evoo, butter. Removed the chicken to chop while I sauteed the onion. Drained a can of Rotel, added to onion, added soups then mixed in the chopped chicken. Layer as instructed. This was awesome! Thanks Gweneth for sharing. Very tasty!

Great kid friendly recipe.  I mixed all the ingredients together vs. layering them.  I also added a can of black beans.  Delicious.  Next time I will add a packet of taco seasoning for a little more flavor.

I loved this casserole.  I chopped the chicken first and cooked it in butter, with minced garlic to add flavor, then I added more mushrooms.  I made long grain rice, and mixed it with the soups before I mixed in everything else.  I put the rice mixture on the bottom, salsa and chicken mix next, then cheese.  I reserved a little of the rice mix and lightly covered the cheese, just so it didn't burn.  Green onions, and sour cream on it when it was plated.  Husband LOVES it.   I think it is still missing corn in it.

LOVED it!  I used medium-hot southwest-style salsa (with the beans and corn) and omitted the chopped onion.  Made it first for a friend's family, using a shredded Mexican cheese blend...they said they liked it, so I made it for us a couple nights later using shredded mild and sharp cheddars, as I ran out of the Mexican blend.  It was YUMMY!  I might try adding some chopped chilies next time for even more kick.  Great recipe and very easy!

Loved it! Only downside, is though we love onions in our house, this had a little to many. Also they didn't cook all the way, and were slightly too cruchy. Will serve again for sure!

This was delicious. I bought some really strong onions apparently, so that was not so good, and I would add a little more salsa maybe 2 cups. But very delicious recipe!

I really liked this. Thought it was very easy to make (although it did call for a lot of bowls!) I found myself thinking that "minute" rice would have taken a lot less time and I did brown the chicken instead of boiling it....but still...it was delicious and it held up well as leftovers too. Thanks for a great recipe.

This actually turned out good. I'm usually pretty skeptical of recipes calling for any type of condensed soup, so I only used 1 can of cream of chicken soup, Pace salsa, and 2 cups total of cheese.  Less fattening, but still really good. I topped with chopped green onions for a little extra onion flavor.

Very easy tasty dish. Instead of boiling the chicken I sauteed it with the onions.  I used a cheddar/jack cheese blend and didn't use anywhere close to 4 cups, but it was plenty cheesy.  Next time I will not layer it, but will mix everything except the cheese and just sprinkle the cheese on top. This is good as written, and very easily adaptable to suit your family's preference for level of spiciness, etc.

DELICIOUS! Whole family, children included, loved this meal. I browned the chicken with the onions and mixed the salsa and soups with that and simmered until the rice was ready. Not sure why this recipe suggests to boil the chicken. Definitely worth making again!

I made a 1/2 recipe in an 8x8 pan which I think still would have served 6 although i did use 2 huge chicken breasts.  I threw the frozen breasts in the crockpot with chicken broth in the morning so it would be ready to go when I got home.  I should have cooked the rice ahead of time too.  I thought this was great how it was, my husband prefered it with crushed tortilla chips and hot sauce on top.

I followed the recipe as it is except used minute rice brand brown rice. It makes the prep time a bit shorter. I would make this again.

Absolutely delicious.  The only thing I changed was cutting out some of the onion (I did a little more than 1/2 an onion).  Otherwise amazing.  My husband loved it.

Really good, even better leftover.  Way better leftover.  The only thing I changed was instead of salsa I used a can of rotel tomatoes.  This time I may add a package of taco seasoning to the soup mixture to spice it up a bit, but its good as is, just looking for variation.  I didnt mess with layers.  once i cooked the rice, i added it to the soups and added chicken.  So I put 1/2 of that in pan then 1/2 of the cheese then repeated once and baked.  YUM!

This is an easy dinner to throw together. I mixed up the onions, soups and cheeses all together to save time and added corn, hatch chili peppers and pinto beans that I had in the pantry. I only used 1/2 the cheese the recipe called for. I topped with the salsa then added a bit more cheese and baked. Excellent. Next time I make it I will try to do the lowfat version...I bet that's still just as good. Thanks for a great recipe.

Very good! I ended up mincing half a jalapeno pepper to mix in with the cheese to give the casserole a little kick. I ended up cooking the onions and 1 clove of garlic before mixing it to the soup mixture. I didn't have cream of chicken so I ended up substituting sour cream with the cream of mushroom very creamy!!!!yum! Also, I added an extra 1/4 cup of salsa.

I didn't think mixing salsa, cream of mushroom, & cream of chicken would be great together. But it is! I am eating this delicious meal as week speak. The only thing I changed/added was broccoli. I grabbed a pound of frozen broccoli and heated it up in the microwave with some water. I chopped it up and added it with the rice! It gave the dish a little crunchiness too! Awesome!

This casserole wasn't bad - but it wasn't good either. I followed suggestions and used only one can of soup and substituted taco cheese. I also used whole grain rice for some extra nutrients. The taste was fine, but the texture is soooo bland. It's just a scoop of warm ooze on the plate. I tried to add some crunch by serving fresh tomatoes, onions and taco chips with it, but it was still very dull. No one asked for seconds. Disappointing.

This was really good. I altered it a little based on our personal tastes and what I had in the pantry. There were only two of us so I mad 3 servings. I used 1 cooked chicken breast, cubed and mixed it with a can of black beans. The beans were a fantastic addition and made it a little more interesting than just with chicken. I used one can of low fat/sodium cream of chicken soup, 3/4c salsa, 1/4 chopped onion (raw), and 1/2 can chopped green chiles. Oh, also, for the rice, I had on of those 90 second microwave pouches of mexican rice which added some more depth than just regular white rice would have. Also, the cheese I used was a pre-packaged mexican blend and I barely used enough to cover each layer and it was more than enough.  I think the whole thing took me 5 minutes of prep work. Fantastic dish! Oooo, we had it with tortilla chips which made it even yummier!

I really liked this, but I did make a couple of small changes.  I used brown rice instead of white and a Mexican cheese blend instead of cheddar and Monterey.  I also added a can of corn (drained) and used extra onion.  Instead of layering, I just mixed everything together except for half of the cheese, which I sprinkled on top.  This recipe is super easy and makes a ton of food!

With a few minor changes I will put this in heavy rotation. I opted to dice, season & sauté the chicken with the onions. For the rice I used 2 cups of the 5-min Minute Maid rice and for more flavor I used 2 cups of chicken broth instead of water and microwave covered for 8 min.    Added the chicken and ½ of the ingredients & mixed in together then stared the layers as the recipe stated. Covered in the oven for 30 min or so then uncover for 15min to get it to brown (this way everything has time to soak up all the flavors and the cheese on top does not overcook) Let sit a few minutes to cool off. *Also note that for those that would like a little heat try hot salsa instead of mild  (I recommend chi-chi’s)

Awww yeah! This recipe puts the roll in the casserole!! Owww! This recipe will definitely be worked into the rotation!! Grazie!!    ~Here are some slight adjustments we gave a whirl:  We satuee'd the chicken with green onions and chili powder, added one can of cream of mushroom soup, omitted the cream of chicken soup and cheese, used cowboy caviar instead of salsa, added black olives, cumin, and jalapenos.     Next time we want to use salsa and black beans. Bon Appetit!

Good recipe - will be making for guests this week.  Try it w/ cream of celery soup. I think we forget that there are other "flavors" of soup and use mushroom too often.  Also, start with a deli chicken for ease of preparation and more taste.

This was very good. The only adjustment I made was to only use cream of chicken - no cream of mushroom and also I separated the layers with a flat, soft tortilla shell. So I put one tortilla shell in the bottom of my round baking dish, did one layer of rice, chicken, sauce, cheese; then I laid out another tortilla and then a second layering of ingredients. This gave the casserole some structure, so that when I cut pieces they actually stood and didn't get mushy and soupy. It also added one more flavor and texture - really tasty. Will defintely make again.

My entire family LOVES this casserole. My husband has been begging me to cook it again for weeks. I made a few changes to the recipe. First of all, I sautee the chicken in a pan with about 2 or 3 tbsp of the salsa. I also spice the chicken with cajun seasoning (thats how we like it; may not be a good taste for everyone). Also, I add a can of rinsed black beans to the recipe by tossing it with the rice. Anyway, it is delicious, and I will continue to make this over and over again!

I made this for two, so I omitted the soups altogether, using only the salsa fo liquid. I reduced everything else by a third and had more than enough for me and my husband. We both absolutely loved this - he even raved to his mom about how good it was! This is a definite keeper! Thanks!

Very tasty although I did make a few changes to suit my taste so I couldn't give it a 5 star rating.  I omitted the can of cream of chicken and instead added 1/2 cup sour cream.  I also added about 1/2 t chili powder to the sauce mixture to give it a little more zip.  I also added a corn layer and added crushed tortilla strips on top.  All and all it was very good and I will probably make this again!

My whole family enjoyed this. I was surprised that the kids(8,4,1) would eat it as they usually don't like things mixed together.  Like other reviews, I also changed some things. I used one can of soup and added some sour cream. I also mixed everything together and added frozen corn and a can of black beans.  We will definitely eat this again.

I made this recipe with the following changes, and it was a big hit!  I left out one of the cans of cream soup and added a can of diced tomatoes instead.  I cut the chicken into strips and sauteed it with the onions, then cut the chicken into bite size pieces later.  I only used 2 cups of cheese instead of 4, and I sprinkled some cumin over the first layer of the soup/salsa mixture.   I'll definitely make this again!

Great recipe . . . I pan fried the chicken with seasoning instead of boiling.  Also, I cut back a little on the rice and used a can of Rotel in place of the salsa.  My husband loves this and he's extremely picky!  :o)

Nothing to write home about. Why it needed 2 cream soups that are so similar in taste i don't know. Too much rice . I needed to add salsa on top as i served it because it seemed to evaprate in the casserole itself. I am sorry but I'll pass on this one.

This was quite a big hit in my family.  I used hot, southwest style salsa, and I'm glad I did.  Without it, I'm afraid it may have been too bland.  (For the record, I never use hot salsa because I'm a wimp, but could not even tell it was hot in this dish.)  I diced the chicken and then cooked in oil in frying pan before adding to the casserole.  The only thing I will do differently next time is to season the chicken first; it could have used some fuego spice mix or, at the very least, some salt and pepper.  When I got a bite of it in the casserole, it didn't taste like much.  Overall, this was really yummy.  I will make it again.

This was pretty tasty and even better the second day. Followed recipe pretty closely with exceptions of using brown rice instead of white, sautéing the onion with a diced pepper and garlic, adding a can of drained black beans, and using a rotisserie chicken/white meat shredded. Will make again. Thanks for the recipe!

This is delish with obvious modifications! Please never boil chicken. It should be a sin..... but I pan seared the chicken with cumin, garlic powder, and pepper (enough salt in other stuff!!!!) Once cooked I cut it up and then threw in some onions and green peppers until they were tender. I used a light cream soup, brown rice (cooked in chicken stock), and only one cheese since it's all I had. I also sprinkled some cilantro on each layer. I also recommend getting a good deli salsa or pico di gallo. Absolutely delicious.

A great go-to on those nights where you need something easy to put together. I think next time I would use pinto or black beans to give it a bit more substance. Also I would recommend pan frying the chicken/onions in some spices/hot sauce for more flavor.

Excellent! Everyone loved it! I followed advice of some reviewers and sautéed the chicken first instead of boiling. I also used more chicken, rice and cheese. I put in a 13 x 15 pan to accommodate the extras and did not want it to overflow. I added a little extra salsa to the soups and made extra rice for the guys that always want more rice. I covered it with foil for 30 minutes And then removed for the remaining cooking time. Definitely a hit and will make again.

So good! I was searching for a recipe that I could make with ingredients I had on hand. This one was perfect. I used two cans of Cream of Chicken, and more actual chicken breast than the recipe called for. I followed some of the suggestions in prior reviews and sauteed the chicken with the chopped onion and added a few tablespoons of taco seasoning mix, as well as a can of black beans.  This casserole is TO DIE FOR! My boyfriend raved about it and happily ate leftovers for days afterward, saying it got even better as the days went by.

I used canned chicken (large can).  Recipe is quite bland. Consider using medium salsa instead of mild.  We don't care for spicy food, but this dish needs something. Also, WAY TOO MUCH CHEESE!! Next time, I'm going to try adding less cheese and more veggies. (Zucchini, red bell pepper, frozen corn, green beans) Update: after making it a couple of times, we've decided we don't like it.

Yummy!  I did this with a supermarket rotisserie whole chicken (in its own juices) which was cheaper and easier with a savory taste.  I thought this dish would be bland so I probably added too much salt, but in any case, it was a hit.

I decided to make this for my Bro-in-laws B.D.  I was distracted the entire day, overcooked the rice etc....So I ended up just mixing everything together and topped it with the cheese. Everybody gave it thumbs up. I don't like to change recipes and then review them but I basically used all the main ingredients and it turned out fine, so I guess the moral of the story is this one is really hard to screw up.

My husband said, "This is killer." I don't get that reaction with every casserole. :)
I made a few changes: 1) I omitted the cream of chicken soup (kinda grosses me out) and substituted a can of creamed corn for it, (slightly drained). 2) I added a diced red pepper, which added flavor, color and nutrition. 3) I used one large bone-in, skin-on chicken breast, broiled in water for 40 minutes (any less, and it won't be cooked through) and shredded that, then added it to some leftover taco-seasoned shredded pork loin and black beans mixture. 4) Ate it with Fritos sprinkled on top. Made altogether, this was spicy, flavorful, and a "killer" keeper. :) Thanks for the recipe!

I'm posting this review mainly so I can remember the adjustments I made, because after doing this I won't go back to the original! I followed another reviewer's idea and used a cheesy flavor Rice a Roni (two boxes), cut down the cheeses to around 1 cup each, added a small can of drained black beans and chopped green chilis, and chopped up 1/2 a green pepper and 1/2 a red pepper (leftover from another meal, just to use them up). Added chives to the top. Kept the rest of the ingredients the same. EXCELLENT.

I increased all ingredients, used 2 chicken breasts and 4 thighs which I sauteed in butter with the onions, made it in a larger casserole dish, used one package of pecan brown rice and 1 bag of Success rice, added a small can of green chili peppers, and used medium rather than mild salsa . . . didn't need to increase the cheese as 4 cups is plenty . . . very yummy!

This dish was the hit of my party!!! I made if for twelve people but instead of adding 1 1/2 cans of each soup I add both the full cans and more salsa so it didn't turn out dry and more cheese and it turned out Fabulous and like I said it was the hit of the party..Thank you for the recipe.  Wendy

I loved the Salsa Chicken Casserole, I cooked the chicken in chicken broth with salt and pepper then cooked the rice in the broth while the chicken cooled. I also sauteed the onions and added corn tortillas (cut in slices)in the layering.  Turned out great!

I cooked the chicken in a crockpot with salsa, salt, pepper, cayenne, salt, black pepper, cumin, coriander, chili powder, and red pepper flakes.  When it was done, I shredded it and added the soups right to the crockpot. I did one layer of rice, chicken mixture and cheese.  I also cooked 30 minutes with foil on and 15 minutes with foil off. Very tasty! I could have actually used a little more rice, I'll use two cups next time and also add beans.

I used a half of a rotisserie chicken and  leftover rice the night before.  I used one can of cream of chicken soup and two cups of salsa,  a can 4 ounce can of Ortega peppers,  some taco seasonings and 2% mexican flavored shredded cheese. I mixed everything together and added cheese on top. I made it earlier in the day and refrigerated it.  I baked it for 30 minutes covered and an extra 12 minutes uncovered.  My husband loved it!

I actually followed several good tips & changes to this recipe and added a few changes of my own. I cut southwest flavored chicken into bite size pieces and cooked in same pan w/ a little oil, garlic & the onion. Used Knorr Fiesta Sides Mexican Rice. I combined the cream of mushroom & chicken soup w/ a can of Mild Rotel together. But when I went to layer there didn't seem to be enough rice to layer. So I actually ended throwing the cooked chicken & onion/garlic all together. So forget layering...LOL! Just mix it all up w/ a cup of mild cheddar/jack preshredded cheese, then sprinkle w/ approx 1 1/2 cups of same cheese combo. Soooooo good. So I guess I used this recipe as an outline then just freeformed a little too. Oh well still 5 stars for mine!! :-)

This is an awesome casserole. I make it about 3 times a month and share it at work and everyone loves it. I use medium salsa instead of mild and oh so good. If you like chicken, rice, cheese and salsa, you must try this. It is the only time I will eat left overs. It is that good. I am rating this a 5 star. It's nice to know you don't have to use any seasonings like salt or pepper. I love it.

This is a keeper. Wow, delicious! Used a rotisserie chicken instead of boiling chicken breast. Made over the weekend at a cabin with girlfriends. Everyone wants the recipe.

I'm not one for this sort of thing, but this was delicious!  I had this with my parents, and we used reduced fat colby jack instead of regular monterey jack, but other than that, no substitutions.  I can't wait to make this for my fiance'!

I made this even easier by doing the following: in 13 X 9 pan- add UNCOOKED rice, cup up rotisserie chicken, rinsed can of black beans, mexicorn drained,  frozen diced onion (1 cup), 1 1/2 cup fresh salsa medium, 2 cups water, cup up red pepper, 2 tsp cumin, 1 tsp chili powder, dash of cayenne, can of diced green chilies, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp pepper  Cover with foil and cook for 30 minutes on 350. Uncover add 2 cups mexican blend cheese, cook 10minutes. My husband liked this in a a tortilla with sour cream and extra salsa.  YUM YUM and easy.

Considering how easy this was - it was pretty darn good. I had leftover rice pilaf and chicken breasts already baked, so I just threw this together. Did not use the cream of chicken soup as I didn't have any, and used mostly medium salsa (this might help those that found the casserole a little bland). I could see tweaking this for a meatless entree - use kidney or black beans and some corn instead of the chicken and use brown rice instead of white - would probably be great. And if you go easy on the cheese, it is relatively healthy too!

I was getting tired of the same cream of chicken/and or mushroom soup chicken casseroles and such that were in our dinner rotation so decided to try this... So glad I did because I was blown away! I used Fire Roasted Red Pepper enchilada sauce in place of the salsa.

This was yummy!  I just mixed mine all together instead of layering.  I also added more rice, as it just didn't seem like enough.  I use minute rice, but I couldn't imagine that would make any difference.  I ended up using about 2 cups of uncooked rice.  I cooked my chicken in a mixture of mostly chicken broth and water and shredded the chicken.  And even though I am a cheese lover, I used closer to 2 cups of cheese (not including what I put on top) and it was still VERY cheesy.  Any more would have been too much, IMO.

This turned out great but I made a few changes to add flavour.  I sauteed the onions and chicken in a nonstick pan with some Taco Seasoning I (from this site.  I also used brown rice, and low fat cheese.  Turned out absolutely delicious, but for me the only thing was missing was black beans or low fat refried beans.  I'll definitely add them in next time!

I really liked this- but I changed to recipe to suit my family, so I felt like I couldn't give it 5 stars. I used brown rice instead of white, cooked the chicken in stock, and only used about half of the cheese called for (substituting queso fresco and mexican for monterey jack and chedder). Next time I will add black beans and corn. It's a keeper!

THIS RECIPE IS AMAZING!!! The only things I changed are that I cut the chicken into pieces when the chicken was raw and cooked it that way (much easier) and I used mexican cheese because I didn't have cheddar. My family loved it!

I love how flexible this delicious recipe is.  I like things a little spicier, so I use a spicier salsa, add some green chiles, and toss in a little chipotle powder.  Yum!  This is a new standard dish at our house.

My husband and I made this with Rotel instead of salsa, added whole black beans and corn, and used cheddar cheese and Italian mix for top. We left covered for 30 minutes then took of foil for last 10 minutes to make the cheese more crunchy. It was good, but not great. As other reviewers have stated, as written it is a quite bland. The corn and taste of the Rotel added a little more flavor.

I think this might be five stars without the onions (ours were particularly potent). It tastes alot like yummy enchilada insides. I halved the recipe and used only cream of chicken soup and not cream of mushroom soup. Worked pretty well.

I added 2 cans of black beans, some red enchilada sauce and left out one of the cans of soup. I also added the juice of one lime to the rice. For the salsa, I used Trader Joe's peach salsa. It was delicious!

Good casserole. I made a mistake and used long grain and wild rice mix. Also added taco seasoning to cooked chicken & some tortilla chips as bottom layer in casserole. Otherwise made as written. Good flavor. My husband wanted more tortilla chips and crumbled extra on top of his. Every one liked except my son. Probably better using regular rice. Will make again with regular rice and maybe add some corn or black beans.

This chicken dish is not very good.  The chicken is bland and the onions, if you cook them as written, are crunchy.  The chicken needs more seasoning it was very bland.  If you are making this recipe for the first time definitely saute the onoins first in some oil and toss in some fresh garlic.  After that 
saute your chicken and add cumin or some taco seasoning.  Recipe needs major tweaking.

Very good! Thanks for the recipe.  I used ground turkey bc that's what I had on hand. Cooked it in a skillet with a little oil and just shy of 2 Tbsp taco seasoning.  Mixed salsa in with chicken and mixed the soups into the rice. Turned out great. Thanks again!

It was easy enough, and had a nice flavor.  A little too much chicken for my taste, though.  I used 3 breast halves instead of 4, and it was still too chicken-y.  Next time, I'll use two.  Also, I served it up with chopped scallions, diced avocado and a dollop of sour cream

FANTASTIC recipe. The only change I made was to toss my cut up chicken in some dry taco seasoning mix, and I also added about a tablespoon of taco seasoning into the salsa/soup mixture. I also added a can of corn. GREAT dish.

A little heavy. I tried to make it healthier using fat free soups, brown rice. My husband liked it, I just thought it was ok. I may try tweaking it. I agree, maybe some taco seasoning might help spice it up.

I made this for the first time tonight and it was delish!  However, I ended up with extra soup/salsa mixture, so I will probably use only 1 can of soup next time, cream of chicken.  I also used a spicy salsa as my family likes it hot. Next time I will also cook the chicken differently and cook with the soup/salsa.  I like the idea of adding black beans and corn to the casserole.  Overall, great flavors!

This was a hit at my house. I made extra rice (2c uncooked brown basmati & 4c water) also I cubed & sauteed the chicken with onion and I added garlic(I don't like to boil chicken). The only other change was to use a can of cream of celery in place of cream of mushroom, I didn't realize that I was out of that. I didn't know what to expect with not seasoning but the flavor was surprisingly good considering - we'll have this again!

Yummy!  I used 2 cans of chicken soup because I don't care for the mushroom, and it was creamy and delicious.  Not sure I want to know the nutrition facts on this though.

This was an excellent recipe.  After reading the other reviews, I did adjust slightly and used medium salsa, cumin, diced garlic and also added some jalapeño on top.  To save steps, I also just threw everything in the baking dish, but cut the water down to 1 1/3 c and baked for 1 hour and fifteen minutes.   It was a hit in my household and will definitely make again.

This is really good.  After reading several other reviews, I decided to tweak only a little.  I cooked the chicken in the crockpot all day so it was moist, tender and falling apart.  I added about 3/4 cup of milk to the soup/salsa mix, and I cut back on the rice a bit.  It was super moist and taste great.  I think this would be fantastic wrapped up in a burrito.  I will try that next time!  Thanks for the yummy recipe!

So I made this because I needed to use some mexican flavored Velveeta and didn't know what to do with it. So I left out the monterey jack, added the velveeta and sprinkled a little cheddar on the top during baking. It was ok, and the calories involved make me a little green but my kids LOVED it - really loved it. So for them I give it  5 stars!!!

I did this with several variations.  Used 1 cup Brown Rice, elminiated the water, cut the chicken in to bite size pieces and sauted it in some olive oil with chopped onion & garlic and added some mexican seasoning.  I spiced it up with a tbsp of chopped jalenpenos which I added to the soup mix.I used cream of celery soup as the chicken one had MSG.  Every Wed I make dinner for a friend with ALS who loves spicy food, this was a big hit for him!!

This is a decent base recipe.  I made several of the changes that others mentioned in their review, too numerous to list here.  Some people said too much rice, others said too little.  I thought it was just the right amount.  The clean up was killer!  Too many bowls.

I'm sure we will try again with a few changes, but overall good.  I'm an onion lover, but this had way too much onion.  I used a medium size one.  I think I would use 1/4 - 1/2 of onion and 1/2 a bell pepper, use about 1/2 the rice and probably add a pepper to give it a kick (I like things hot).

I mixed everything together and then put it in the casserole dish. I wanted a little more flavor, so I cooked the chicken breasts in salted water and used rice with Mexican seasoning (garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, and chicken boullion powder) and added about 1 TBSP chili powder to the casserole. I left out the onion and used only cheddar cheese. I added a few handfuls of coarsely crushed tortilla chips to give the casserole a little more structure. I stuck the casserole in the microwave for about 6 minutes and served with refried beans. My husband and kids liked it, so it's a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

Very creamy and tangy.  Was a bit "runny" but I also used a local Mexican restaurant's salsa and not the chunky store brand so I'm sure that had something to do with it.

I had to alter this recipe with the cheese since a holusehold member has to watch their intake of salt.  I used all swiss cheese and  only cream of chicken soup, and it tasted great.

This was surprisingly flavorful and much better than other similar recipes.  I think that is due to addition of the cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soups.  I omitted the onion and didn't miss it a bit.  And I only used 3 cups of cheese which was plenty.  Just used a Mexican blend.

OMG this was so yummy! My family loved it and it was so easy to make ahead. I did use brown rice cooked in chicken broth. And used chicken from a rotisserie chicken mixed with some taco seasoning for  a bit more flavor to the chicken.

We loved it. It's now added to our "all time faves." I didn't really measure the cheese, but you can't go wrong with extra cheese. I also used Cheddar Cheese soup instead of Cream of Mushroom, again...can't have enough cheese.

Really easy to make, especially if you use rotisserie chicken and leftover rice.  

I added a can of drained corn and followed the suggestion of cutting back on cheese and cream soup and it was perfect.  I think I'd add in a can of rinsed black beans and some dice zuchinni next time too to get some more vegetables in.

My husband and I like things a bit spicier so I added in a couple dashes of hot sauce (Bob's Habanero Hot Sauce, it's here on Allrecipes), it was still pretty mild so I plan on using a bit more next time.

Great comfort food! Made a few changes because we didn't have everything. Used brown rice, and substituted 1/2 cup of sour cream for the cream of mushroom soup. Also added a small can of black olives. Only had cheddar, so used 2 cups of that. will definitely make this again!

Loved this recipe - was so simple. As recommended for ppl not loving too much heat I did use Rotell tomatoes in place of salsa. Awesome! Thank you!

I made this last night for boyfriend and myself, and we both thought is turned out great. I did halve the recipe because I was only cooking for two. It's really convenient that you can now buy the condensed cream  of mushroom soup and the cream of chicken soup combined in one can! Makes it easier and less waste when you cut a recipe in half. Anyway, I sauteed the onion beforehand along with some minced garlic. I didn't use mild salsa though. I used a 7 oz can of Herdez Salsa Ranchera. Gave it quite a kick! I also didn't bother with the repeat layering. There was just one layer of each. Worth making again!

This recipe is nearly the same as king Ranch chicken. Try this same method but instead of rice, use corn tortillas and instead of salsa, use Rotel. My husband loves this recipe.

This was a great way to use up leftover rice.  It went together quickly so I wasn't expecting much.  Boy, was I surprised!  It was a warm, gooey, cheesy comfort food.  I already have requests to make it again!

I tried some of the changes in the reviews.  i agree it would have been very bland had i prepared it the way the recipe read.  Even with the added flavor it wasn't great.  It tasted more like a burrito filling than a casserole.  I do not recommend this for anyone.

This was great! Even the kids liked it. I followed everything except I only had one can of cream of mushroom soup, so I added a container of the new Philadelphia cream cheese cooking sauces (Sante Fe flavor). It was really good, and I'm sure the original would be just as good. Nice to have a spicy casserole in the repertoire!

I wish I could review without rating, because I made several changes.  To get a little more nutrition in, I added green peppers, black beans and corn.  And I reduced the amount of soup and chicken.  I liked this pretty well but decided I liked it even better as a dip for tortilla chips, and I think I may make it that way in the future.

Very good base recipe that's easily adapted to your preferences.

The taste of this recipe is really good, however, I would add a little more rice around 2 cups and wayyyyyyyy less onion, I made it with about half of a smaller yellow onion and every bite was full of onion. I would maybe do a quarter of an onion next time, it added good flavor but was too much for me. I also cooked the rice in my rice cooker instead of the traditional way on the stove...Over all it was good!

Here are the changes on made based on what I had on hand.  First I used yellow Spanish rice which really gave it great flavor.  I didn't have cream of mushroom so I substituted with 1 cup of sour cream, I added a can of drained rotel and only used 3/4 cup salsa.  I also sauteed my chicken with the onion and salt & pepper.  I also added a can of sweet corn which I really loved, it was a nice contrast with the spicy flavors and added some texture.  I didn't layer for time sake but combined everything together including 1/2 cup of cheese and them topped with remaining cheese (I also used pepper jack cheese on half for me and my hubby, would have been too spicy for the kids) cover with foil and cooked 30 min, uncovered and cooked an additional 10 minutes.  Very good will make again and will freeze half to have a quick meal on hand at a later date.

Im giving this a 4 because I didnt necessarily care for it, but my family did.  Maybe I should have let it bubble more in the oven but it had an overwhelming soup taste not so much of a salsa flavor.  Also, I cut back on the cheese as we are eating healhier in our house.  I cut back to 1.5 cups of 2%cheddar which was still plenty.

I made this according to the recipe and my family loved it and they say it's a "keeper".  Even my husband (who is generally wary casseroles) liked it. The one thing they all agreed on is that the onions were a little too raw.  Next time I make this I might saute the onions a little first.

I wasn't floored by this recipe and I probably won't make it again.  I listened to the advice of others and cooked my chicken breast in a pan with some garlic instead of boiling, but that didn't make up for the rest of the dish.  It just didn't do anything for me.  The texture was just mush with chunks of chicken.  I topped it with sour cream and that helped a little bit.

Very good! I used brown rice and only the can of cream of chicken. I didn't even use all the cheese and I also added some frozen mixed veggies. Okay I know I switched things up lol, but it was a great base! I always like to tweak recipes.

We liked it but the leftovers are sitting.  Would probably make again but wasn't blown away.  Thanks!

I've made this a few times and enjoy it. I do however make some changes at this point. I don't really care for the cream soups so I omit them and use sour cream in their place. I sometimes use left over rice that has already been cooked and omit the water as well. This is one of those recipes where pretty much anything will work. I add some taco seasoning to the chicken as it cooks (along with onion) and add my salsa or rotel and let it simmer until the juices evaporate some. This makes a great burrito filling as well.

This was very good and very easy. The only thing I changed was to season water w/ a little chicken base when cooking the rice. Also, I did not layer it in the pan. I mixed it all together, mixing 1/2 of the cheese in & the other 1/2 on top. Thanks for sharing. My family loved it!

Wonderful!  My whole family loved it, and it made great leftovers for the next day.  I did not cook the meat ahead of time.  I mixed all ingrediants except meat in baking dish first, and then cut meat into smaller pieces.  I salt and peppered meat, and added some cumin also.  I then barried meat in rice mixture and baked covered for 1 hour.  I then sprinkled cheese on top and let melt.  Very tender and full of flavor.  I will be making this again.

Gave 5 stars but think it's 4.5 as I made it. Needed something to it..like a small can of green chiles. I halved the recipe and added a touch of sour cream to the soup/salsa mixture. Also, I didn't layer it 2 times...just one layer of each. Turned out really creamy and very tasty. A definite keeper! Oh, and a great way to use up leftover chicken from a whole roasted one from day before. Inexpensive, tasty, and filling!

Yummy! I made this almost exactly as directed. I used medium salsa instead of mild (because that's what I had on hand), and cooked the rice in my rice cooker according to the directions for using it. Leftovers were also yummy!

Made this for a covered dish luncheon recently. Got rave reviews from everyone who tried it. Used a boxed spanish rice mix instead of white rice and Rotel tomatoes in addition to salsa. Oh, and crushed up some Doritos between the layers. Very good!

This was delicious, I did make a few changes to suit my tastes.  I seasoned the chicken with a homemade taco seasoning I have.  I also omitted the onions and added a small can of spanish style corn.  This was very good and my one year old and my boyfriend both devoured it and ate more.

Wow I can't believe how good this turned out, for how easy it was!  Took me about 10min to prep, and 35min to cook/bake: EASY!  The chicken was super moist, and my husband loved it with his Frank's hot sauce and a glass of cold beer. I did make some changes.  First I cut the recipe in half and used a 9x9 bake pan lined in foil b'cuz I cook for only 2 ppl here; I also used a rice cooker instead of using the stovetop.  In terms of ingredients, I used just 1 can of cream of chicken, medium Tostitos salsa, and shredded cheddar cheese. I used thawed frozen chicken breasts (I always have a bag in the freezer specifically for casseroles), and I let it marinate in Lawry's season-all and garlic powder while I chopped the onions. I tossed the chicken in a fry pan with oil on medium heat until done, then I tossed in the onions and simmered everything in some chicken broth. After about 8min, I layered as directed, but only made 1 layer. I covered the pan in foil, baked it for 20min, uncovered the pan and baked for another 5min. DELICIOUS! Will definitely be saving this recipe!

I made this tonight and it was really good!  I usually try to make a recipe as is before I change things, but 1) I was lacking time and 2) I felt it needed more substance just from the list of ingredients.  So the changes I made are: I didn't see how 1 1/3 cup rice was enough for a 9x13 pan.  I made 1 1/3 at first but when I put half in the bottom, it barely covered the pan.  So while I was layering stuff, I made another 1 1/3 cup of rice.  I did use brown rice.  I bought Tyson precooked "diced ROASTED chicken" in the freezer section.  It's new.  I thawed that in the microwave and cooked in 1Tbsp olive oil along with the diced onion.  I added a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes to the chicken and simmered.  I bought healthy request cream soups to cut the sodium, bought "Pace FIRE roasted salsa" that had fire roasted peppers/corn in it.  Added a can of drained black beans to give it more body.  Mixed all of that together.  Layered the rice, then the chicken/tomato mixture, 2 cups cheese (bought Kraft 2% natural cheddar/mont jack), repeated.  Baked 30 minutes added the last layer of cheese last 10 min.  Served with corn bread....everyone loved it!  Had great flavor!  Think the fire roasted stuff really helped with that :)

This was great! It was quick and easy! I omitted the cream of mushroom b/c my husband doesn't like it at all. I didn't boil the chicken, I just cooked it up in a skillet with everything but the rice, which I cooked by itself.  I also added some jalapeno and green bell peppers to it with a can of rotel, to give it extra spice. Shredded my chicken and mixed it all together with the rice in the casserole dish and topped with a bag of cheese. I will make this again for sure! It was sooo yummy!

I made this for a Mexican theme dinner last night and it was a big hit.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  Per other reviews, these are my changes:  I used a Rotisserie chicken and chopped, to save a step.  Only used 2 cups Cheddar cheese, sauteed the onion and added peppers, used half salsa and one can of Rotel tomatoes with green chilies.  I also added a can of southwestern style corn.  Layered rice with onions and peppers, corn, chicken, sauce and then cheese.  Covered with aluminum foil for first 30 mins and uncovered for 10 mins.  YUM.....

Yum!  Four cups of cheese seemed like overkill, so I used one 2-cup package of monterey/cheddar.  I skipped the onions and added a few sprinkles of red pepper.  I used uncooked chicken breasts and baked for an hour at 350...perfect!

This is a great recipe - even my picky eater liked it. I will put it in our regular rotation.  I cut the chicken into bite size pieces before cooking - I sauteed in a skillet with EVOO and the onion.  I also substituted 8 oz sour cream for the cream of chicken soup due to our personal taste (never cared for cream of chicken but did use the cream of mushroom).  Very good recipe!

I have to say first that I didn't follow this recipe exactly as written.  I modified it because it looked like it would be very bland as written.  That said, here is what I did: I first boiled my chicken in water seasoned with PC Mexican Seasoning.  I then removed the chicken and used that water to boil my rice in.  I mixed together the cream of chicken, cream of mushroom, Rotel (instead or salsa), cheese, the chicken-chopped, and about another tablespoon of PC Mexican Seasoning.  To bake, I layered half the mixture on bottom, then the rice, then the rest of the mixture with cheese on top.  With adding the seasoning it was edible, but still bland.

I changed this recipe quite a bit and it was really good.  I used instant brown rice instead of regular white rice and used 2 cups rice and 2 cups water.  I only used 2 cups of shredded cheddar instead of the additional 2 cups of mont. Jack to save some fat.  I used reduced fat cream of chicken & mushroom soups.  I added one can of kidney beans- drained and sprinkled half the kidney beans over the rice layers.  I was shocked that this recipe had NO spices so I added S&P, cumin, chili powder, and Johnny's Garlic seasoning to the soup mixture.  I also added a diced green onion to the soup mixture as well.  I added taco seasoning to the chicken after dicing it.  I served it with sour cream & green onions.  It was VERY tasty and FULL of flavor.  I would suggest adding some spices if you're going to try this recipe, I'm not sure it would have been as flavorful had I not done that.  My husband gave it a thumbs up as a keeper!  I gave it 4 stars since I did have to change it quite a bit, but the base recipe was great!

Awesome! I boiled the chicken then chopped it up and sauted it with minced garlic, green bell pepper, onion, and black pepper. Also, instead of salsa I used a can of Rotel. Didn't alternate layering instead did what another reviewer did and made the first layer the rice then the chicken, soup mixture and then the cheese.....covered and cooked! *Heated the soup mixture in the microwave for faster results and made my rice in the rice cooker*

This was pretty good!  It was easy and contains most of the things on hand.  Did it blow my socks off?  No.  But I'll probably make it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was so excited to try this because of all the reviews.  I was disappointed.  It wasn't a big hit with my family.

Wow.  Everyone in the family devoured this.  Could have eaten the whole pan myself!  Must be the creamy soups makes it so easy to eat!  And the CHEESE.  I used one rotisserie chicken from Sam's, white meat only.  Would have been great with more chicken.  Perfect as is.

I sauteed the chicken and onion together. Added some minced garlic as well.  No one was crazy about it in my family. Might be good wrapped in a burrito. Might do that with leftovers.  Won't make again.

Our large family (14 of us) love this recipe.. i have made it several different ways and its wonderful the original way but we also enjoy variety. on other occasions i have substituted picante instead of salsa with colby jack cheese and cheddar  and have also added chipolte habeneros or jalepenos just under the top layer of cheese. It consistantly gets great raves and i have found that you can also use frozen precooked grilled chicken breast already chopped up, or rotissier chicken deboned to make it faster to prepare. i have made it with ground turkey seasoned with taco seasonings. i top it off with sour cream when serving and it has become the new family favorite having it at least two to three times a month in one of its many variations. thank you so much for this recipe. you turned whats for dinner into a question i dont mind answering!

Yum!  This is a great casserole recipe that both adults & kids in my family liked.  I made 1/2 a recipe to try it out.  I baked & diced the chicken instead of boiling.  Since I was doing a 1/2 recipe, I omitted the cream of mushroom (otherwise I would have had 2 unused half cans of soup.) Next time I might layer it a bit differently to get more of the sauce mixed into the rice. This is an easy recipe to adapt to your own taste and I think it would be great to make ahead and freeze for later.

Not exceptional but not bad at all.  Very basic recipe, tastes mostly of cheese and salsa.  The only changes I made was to saute my onion first as it was a little pungent and to oven bake the chicken breasts.

This was SO GOOD!!  My husband and I had to stop ourselves from eating the entire thing.  We felt like something was missing from this recipe and ended up crushing tortilla chips and adding them on top after it was cooked along with a dash of Red Hot...oh my goodness, it was so good!  I could hardly wait for lunch the next day to eat the leftovers.

Excellent recipe! We enjoy spicy food so while cooking rice I added 1/4cup of hot sauce and 2 tbsp of chili powder to the water. Night before marinated chicken in a chipotle sauce then baked the next morning, and threw it all together. Served with sour cream. Huge hit!! Thanks!!!

Totally Yummy!!! Based on some of the other reviews, here are the changes that I made:  1. Used 1.5 cups of uncooked brown rice (cook as directed before adding to casserole) 2. Used drained can of Rotel in place of the salsa 3. Instead of layering, I mixed everything up and then placed in pan and sprinkled the top with cheese. 4. Used less cheese.  I used 1 cup in the mixture and then just enough to cover the top of the casserole. 5. Added 1/2 cup of sour cream to mixture. 6. Gave the mixture a generous sprinkling of chili powder, cumin, and garlic powder 7. Sauteed some garlic with the onion 8. Added in a can of rinsed black beans  These changes made for a delicious dinner! Both kids, husband, and father-in-law loved it!!!

I'd say it was just okay. Maybe because I used a lo-fat cheese, who knows. As other reviews stated, it was lacking something.  I thought the same thing. Too much rice too, that was all I tasted. I'd cut the rice down a bit before making this. And since it's layered, it didn't really come out layered. It just fell apart in the plate loosely.

This was good. Smelled wonderful while baking, too.  Everyone here liked the flavor... but all agreed it would be better if used as a filling -or- topped with 'taco" toppings (ie:lettuce, tomato, etc.) We decided this time to just 'scoop' it up with crispy tortillas. I would not make from scratch again, but, will make again, when we have leftover chicken and rice.

I made this with brown rice and I am guessing the brown rice doesn't have the volume of white rice. It turned into a runny mess..but with good flavor. Next time I will use white and add another chicken breast as I didn't think it had enough.

I don't get all the 5-star reviews. I followed the recipe pretty much as stated, except I added a can of mild diced green chilis. Overall, it was just gooey, goopy and not that exciting. First time ever that my hubby didn't grab seconds. It would be better if we used it as filling for quesadillas or burritos. I probably won't be making this again.

This was such an easy recipe!  I cooked the rice in chicken stock and used Healthy Choice cream soups.  I also cooked the chicken in a skillet with some olive oil and spices.  My family ate every bite and asked for more.  I have already had requests for this recipe again.

We love this recipe at my house! I alternate the ingredients depending on what's on hand. Sometimes I use cream of chicken or mushroom, but the winner so far has been one can cream of chicken and one can condensed cheese sauce! I also use chicken broth instead of water. This makes a good burrito filling too!

I have to admit that I had a bad feeling about trying this recipe.  My husband isn't usually a fan of casserole type dishes.  I had all the ingredients and it sounded good to me so I gave it a try.  Boy was I pleasantly surprised!  The hubs gave his approval, going back for seconds, and even had leftovers today in a burrito.  There was quite a bit of prep involved with cooking the rice and the chicken, mixing the sauce, assembling it all, etc but it was worth it.  I subbed rotel since that's what I had and we both really liked the flavor.  I also sauteed two cut up chicken breasts with the onion in a little bit of chili powder, garlic powder and cumin.  I added a can of black beans and some frozen corn too.  Topped with sour cream and with tortilla chips on the side, it made a great meal in our house that I'll make frequently.

Everyone loved it. I did make a few changes, I did 1 1/2 cups of rice, added a can of chili beans to the rice when it was done, browned the onions and chicken in taco seasoning and a little water, used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup, added some cumin and chili powder and used only 3 cups of mexi-cheese. We also topped it with sour cream and crushed tortilla chips when we ate dinner.

I have made this for years with one addition, I use corn tortillas cut in forths and layer like lasagna noodles. It firms it up and adds a great corn flavor.

I made just a few changes.  I used boneless chicken thighs and cooked them up in a fry pan.  I omit the onion because my husband doesn't like and just use all cheddar cheese (usually just what I have on-hand) and make it exactly otherwise.  It has become my husbands FAVORITE dish.  I have to make 3 or 4 of them and freeze them up.  I make it exactly as I described and put in disposable pans and freeze it.  Then I cook it covered for 3 hours from a frozen state (per the directions in a thawed state) and it's so easy even my husband can "cook" supper that night!
Yummy!  Thanks!

Very good but I am using it as an enchilada filler rather than a stand alone dish. I will make and serve again and again!

We loved it! Easy to prepare-I made 4 cups minute rice in the microwave to cut back on the prep time,and you could use precooked diced chicken if you really needed to go faster. We topped it with a dab of sour cream like other posters suggested, and I did cut back a bit on the cheese to keep the fat grams down just a  little. LOVE IT-Thanks, its a new family favorite(and leftovers would be great to make wraps with as well)

I was looking for a new way to make chicken breasts. This filled the bill. My husband said to rank this a 4.5 and he said be sure I save this recipe.
I choose brown rice,for flavor and nutrition and it turned out great. THANKS TAMI FOR ANOTHER GREAT ONE.

This recipe is GREAT! The only changes I made were using hot salsa, as others suggested, and adding a can of whole kernel corn. I halved it because I thought it would be too much for just my husband and I. I should have made the entire recipe... we both loved it!

i took others' advice and sauteed rather than boiled the chicken and added garlic, salt, pepper and adobo seasoning.  i also used a large can of crm. of chicken instead of two different soups, used half medium and half hot salsa and it was perfect!  the leftovers are even better...especially when you add some black beans and corn, heat it thorougly and serve rolled up in homemade tortillas.  thanks for a great and easy recipe!

This was pretty good. I added some corn kernels and chopped green chilies, and thanks to some of the other ratings I sauteed the chicken breasts with lots of spices. Still a touch bland but I didn't have enough salsa. Next time I will use lots of salsa and maybe more chicken breast. Made a ton, lots of lunches this week.

Delicious recipe, after reading other reviews I made a couple changes. I shredded the chicken instead of leaving it in cubes so it would be spread out more evenly, and I added seasoning to the chicken and boiled in chicken broth instead of water for more flavor. I made the rice as directed, but next time I will just make the rice like normal. The rice was a bit sticky this way and some stuck to the bottom of the pan. We used minute rice, and I did not cut back on the rice. I had a bit of trouble getting my son to eat it because of the salsa, I think I will put it in the food processor next time to make the chunks smaller. All of the adults approved. Very tasty, will definitely make again.

Very very good recipe. I added 1 tsp Cumin and 2 tbsp ranch mix and some chopped roasted red bell pepper. I only had Jasmine rice on hand which worked great, I’m putting this recipe on rotation!

My son loved it! I did use salsa verde instead of regular red salsa and I also added 2 tbsp sour cream to soup mixture. I also used boil in a bag (2) rice which cut down on the prep time.  I will definitely make this again.

Strongly recommend trading cream of jalapeño condensed soup for the cream of mushroom. Also, I take the easy way out and use pre-cooked rotisserie chicken.

This was excellent! I doubled the recipe for my large family, and added my own Mexican seasoning to the chicken while it boiled, and a sprinkle over the top of the last layer of cheese for flavor and presentation. I served this meal with an optional spread of, sour cream, diced green onions, cilantro, and fresh diced jalapenos, as well as tortilla chips and refried beans to eat like a dip if wanted. It was loved by all 15 people!

I didn't 'change' anything, except to cut the recipe in half because there's only two of us. I did add a can of black beans and a bit of leftover frozen corn to bulk it up a little. I also used green salsa (recipe doesn't specify what salsa to use). I know the recipe would be tasty as is, but I will say that with the additions, it was AWESOME. Hubs went back for seconds. I also cheated and did it the dump way. Just dumped all the ingredients into a bowl, raw rice and chicken and all, mixed and poured it into the baking dish. Covered it tightly with foil and baked for 30 minutes. Then took off the foil, covered with extra cheese and baked for an additional 20 minutes. This is going in our regular dinner rotation.

We really like this dish! This is a keeper. I took some of the review recommendations. I sautéed onions and garlic, then added cubed chicken and cooked it with chicken taco seasoning. I mixed the rice and soups. Layed the soup, chicken, and cheese. Got a couple of layers each. The flavors mixed well. There are only two of us, so we had leftovers a couple of days later. The flavors were still good!

Everybody loved it. I followed the ingredients as written but mixed everything together with half of the cheese and sprinkled the other half of the cheese on top. I covered it with foil until the last 10 mins so the cheese on top could get nice and bubbly. Delicious. I will definitely make again.

First, and most important, POACH the chicken breasts, don't just plunk them down in water and boil.  That way you will get dry, stringy and flavorless chicken!  Put the chicken in a pot and cover with water,heat at med-high. When the water comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let the chicken simmer VERY gently. Begin checking the chicken after 8 minutes: it is done when opaque through the middle and an instant-read thermometer in the thickest part of the meat registers 165°F. Chicken is finished cooking in 10 to 14 minutes depending on the thickness of the meat and whether it is has a bone.  Also, put some aromatics in the  water; celery, any green herbs, such as parsley, sage, and a little salt. Then you can use that recipe!

The men in my life are picky eaters and they both had seconds.  I was actually encouraged by those who reviewed it as being too bland, since that sounds right for my family.  I did soften the onions before adding it to the mix with a little EVOO over low heat, and added some garlic, but other than that, I followed the recipe as written  It wasn't spicy, but I added spice on the side for me and I would make it again the same way ...except I'm wondering if some crushed tortilla chips over the top might be an interesting addition...

Thank you for sharing the recipe.

I was skeptical about the salsa with the creamy soups, but this is the best! It's a hit in my house.

My family liked this very much.  I would add cumin,  maybe a tablespoon of taco seasoning next time.  I had to substitute cream of potato soup for cream of mushroom; since I had to change it I am rating 5 star instead of 4 because I guess that might have made a difference.  I also mixed the rice with the soups and cheese in the pan I used to cook the rice instead of layering because I am lazy that way.  I reduced the cheese to 2 cups to save money and calories and in my opinion, that was plenty. I just think it could use more seasoning.  It was good with guacamole. It was easy and a hit so thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is easy especially if you have the chicken precooked. You don't have to use boiled chicken if you already have cooked chicken use that. I cut the recipe in half and it still made a good size dish. A lot of people stated that the recipe was bland.I can see why there are no spices in this recipe. I tasted the salsa/soup mixture since this is where most of the flavor would come from it was bland. I sprinkled 1/2 of a package of taco seasoning in the mixture. I had some left over corn from another meal so I added that also. All in all this is a good recipe I would make this again.

I made exactly as told. It tastes pretty good because of all of the fat in it, but it does not really do much else in terms of flavor. I was glad that I used high-quality salsa because the flavor did come through although kind of weakly.

Family liked it. Served to eat as is or as hard/soft taco. Used leftover rice and canned chicken. Added corn,diced tomatoes and black beans as others suggested. Added some cumin and taco seasoning. Did not add cheese. Mixed all together.

OMG! I followed the recipe as written and boy oh boy. What a hit! Everybody loved it to the point where we all had seconds. Even better was the fact that we also had some the next day as left overs and let me tell you it was even more delicious!!! We're looking forward to having it again soon.

I don't agree at all with the reviews that said it was bland  - just use a salsa with more kick or a different brand altogether.  I have made this a quite a few times. I have used different brands each time & I do prefer it made with certain salsas such as Jack's or Tostitos.  All my super picky ones ate this, had seconds and even told me how good it was. I would recommend putting the chicken in the food processor after cutting to make the chicken smaller and more shredded - like just a few pulses. I also sautéed the onion in butter to make it more tender.  I use Basmati rice which I prefer over plain white in this recipe.

I also cheated and used our left over Bojangles chicken breasts (skin off) from last night and hot salsa. I cooked the onions and mixed everything together in a large bowl and topped it off with half the amount of cheese suggested. I made it before hand and cooked it with aluminum foil (as suggested) for 30 minutes, then 10 more without. It was very flavorful. Defiantly plan on making it again! Thanks for sharing!

This casserole is THE BEST.  I had it at a friend's small dinner party when she was just whipping something up easy and delicious.  I've made it like, 5 times now on my own.  I usually cook it on a Sunday evening and then have it for the rest of the week for our lunches.  I substitute brown rice rather than white rice and opt for lower amounts of cheeses (or sub whatever I have, like pepper jack) but it's still quite delicious.  Last time I also added in some black olives on top towards the end of the baking time, nice little edit for some additional flavor.

I browned the onion and chicken together in a skillet like another reviewer suggested which worked well. I also added a small can of jalapenos which still didn't put much heat in the recipe. I will have to try modifying a bit more to increase the heat.

I wanted to like this, I really did. But I wasn't impressed at all. I followed the recipe exactly. It tasted like mushy salsa flavored soup. I think if I had time to play around with this recipe a bit, it could be better, but as is - it's just lacking. I ate it, but I most likely won't be making it again. Sorry.

As per other reviewers, I sautéed seasoned chicken and onions, season to your taste. since my family are meat lovers, added more chicken than recipe called for to 2 cups of rice. We have a growing 15 yr old son, to parents with teenagers, I am sure you can relate, any way, so, mix salsa and soup mixes to sautéed chicken, obviously, more chicken, more salsa, more rice, more cheese, you get the pic. I layered chicken salsa mixture at bottom of baking dish, then rice then cheese, and repeat, end with chicken mixture and cheese. Also very important I never dice my chicken, do not like the texture, so much better shredded  or cut into thin strips. Thank you for a great recipe.

Yummy!  I halved the recipe and made a few changes as others suggested (mostly preparation not to the ingredients). I sautéed the onions and chicken and added a can of red kidney beans (drained) to the rice. I mixed one can of cream of chicken soup with medium spicy chunky salsa. I layered 1/2 of the rice/bean mixture, 1/2 of the chicken/onion mixture, 1/2 of the soup and salsa mixture, and 1/2 of the cheese mixture in the prepared dish then repeated the layers, ending with cheese. I covered the casserole with foil and baked it for 30 minutes, removed the foil and baked for 10 more minutes. This dish was tasty and easy to prepare. I will definitely make it again!

This one "is a keeper", as my husband refers to new recipes!  I used cheddar cheese.  Deleted mushroom soup, and added 1/2 cup more of our homemade salsa, which has a real spicey kick!

Delicious! I did make changes with the help of a few other reviews & I added a few time savers.  Every weekend I roast a chicken to use for several dishes for lunch & dinner- chicken salad, tetrazzini, etc. So I used already roasted chicken & just sauteed with low sodium taco seasoning (but tempted to try without to see if that's necessary). I used 1.5 boil in a bag brown rices. I used the Campbell Select soups for lower sodium and only used 3 cups of cheese (but am thinking of trying only 2 cups next time- was very rich and cheesy). The next day we had it for lunch in whole wheat wraps!  I also may try it next time adding corn and black or refried beans- think it would add something.  Thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipe and made some changes. I double the recipe for my large family and add 1 can of corn and 1 can of blackbeans to the cream mix. I also saute the onion in 2 packets of taco seasoning. Then I add it to the cream mix. I use this mixture to make burritos and add sour cream and shredded lettuce to top it off. My family LOVES it and ask me to make it often. (It just makes a heap ton of dishes that my sister helps clean :))

I made it according to the recipe except mixing it all together before baking.  Baked for 30 minutes covered in foil, removed the foil added cheese on top and baked the last 10 minutes.  Amazing!

This had excellent flavor!  Though I think a few changes are in order.  I would AT LEAST double the chicken next time (and maybe triple) if you would like this to serve as a casserole.  Otherwise, it is merely a filling for, perhaps, a burrito.  I also cut back on the onion out of personal preference.  I used 90 second rice from Uncle Ben and rotisserie chicken to speed up the process.  Will make again.

This was good, I would make it again but I need to play with the chicken more. I pan cooked it as some of the reviewers recommended, and seasoned it with fajita seasoning and it got a little too dry. Next time I will add a bell pepper or two for some extra color. My husband and kids all said it was a keeper!

I make this at least once a week - it's my "go to" when making meals for friends, as well. I dice and throw the onions in with the rice while it cooks, and combine the soups and salsa with the rice/onion mixture before layering - rice mixture, diced cooked chicken, cheese, layered twice as the recipe calls for. I serve with black or refried beans, tortillas and salad. Fantastic, easy and always a favorite!

I used pineapple peach salsa that I found in the market and the dish came out like a sweet/sour chicken.  The kids loved it enough to go back for seconds.

Really good.  I bet you can change the taste depending on what kind of salsa you use.  We used a smokey salsa and it tasted great.

Following some of the suggestions I made the following changes;
For 8
1 cup brown rice
2 cups light Mexican cheese
1 can healthy request chicken soup
3/4 can low sodium Mushroom soup
1 1/4 cup medium salsa

Brown the chicken and onion and drain some of the liquid before adding the soups and salsa. 
Layer as instructed.
Family raved about the flavor and will definitely make it again.

This is an excellent base recipe. I only gave it 4 stars because I did change several things based on what I had on hand...so this is what I did and it was so yummy! I had a box of Zatarains Dirty Rice mix I used that instead of the rice. I cooked the chicken with diced onion and bell pepper, added a can of pinto beans and seasoned with Cajun Seasoning. I replaced the salsa with a can of diced tomatoes. I then layered the rice, chicken mixture, soup/tomatoes, and cheese. The seasoning from the rice box worked so well for this and made the salsa flavor unnecessary, my hubby loved this and he doesn't usually care for casseroles.

I made this last night for dinner and it was definitely tasty but, as others have suggested, a few additions can help. Also, I used leftover turkey (about 2 cups of chopped for 4 servings) instead of fresh chicken. 
Other changes I made included: using brown Basmati rice; adding about 2 TBSP of chopped green onions to the salsa (and reducing the chopped white onion by about the same amount); reducing the amount of cheese by 50%; adding salt, pepper and a dash of Taco seasoning; and adding a layer of Tostito round tortilla chips on the top just before the final cheese layer. 
I will certainly make this again as a little change from my usual Chicken/Rice/Broccoli concoctions.

Great recipe! There's a lot of prep work for this recipe, but well worth taking the time to make it. To make life easier, I would suggest cooking the rice and chicken the night before so that the only thing left to do the day you want to make it is to layer it and bake it  (particularly if you are coming home from work). I made a change to the onions - I microwaved them for 1 min to make sure they would be cooked all the way through in the casserole. Also, I have a hard time making any casserole without vegetables. It just seems wrong. So I chopped up 1/2 green pepper, 1 red pepper, and 4 oz of fresh mushrooms, microwaved them for 1 min and added them with the chicken. It was soooo good!

This recipe called for way too much water (if you are using minute rice at least). It ended up super mushy.  I sautéed green pepper and zucinni with the onion which I would definitely rec commend.  Overall it's a good recipe to build on

We really enjoyed this recipe...To cut down on time I used 1 can of chicken breast meat. It is great the next day as well. I will consider trying it with Spanish rice for extra flavor and perhaps more sauce...

I didn't care for this recipe. My husband liked it though (after he loaded it with spices). I found it tasted quite bland, even though I fried the chicken and added taco seasoning to it. Next time I make this recipe I will add corn and black beans. I think this will bring more of a taste to it. :)

This was so delicious wrapped like a burrito.  Did change a little, like added black beans and corn.  We also mixed everything together before baking.  So good.  Insteadbof white rice, we added saffron seasoning while cooking to change flavor snd color.  Excellent.  This made a lot.  We were able to eat leftovers and freeze some for a non-cooking day!  Loved it.  Like a previous post, we ate it with cheddar biscuits.

Was worried it might be bland, but it turned out great! I accidentally used two cans of cream of chicken, and it was fine. The only thing I disliked about it was all the dishes - rice saucepan, chicken skillet, two mixing bowls, baking dish, etc.

No, no, no.  Sorry.  I couldn't get past the color of this dish.  Not pretty at all.  The taste was bland.  I used medium salsa and added some cilantro and sauteed up the chicken with some mexican seasonings, it still didn't do anything for this dish.

Entire family LOVED it... even the 5 year old!  Super easy to make and very tasty.  It's great comfort food and it's even yummy left over.  I made it with brown rice which worked out great!   Hubby told me "this is a repeater"  A compliment for sure

SUPER delcious and very flavorful. Only ommitted the onion just b/c the kids on't like onion, but I'm sure it tasted even better with it.

I like this recipe. I left out the mushroom soup and added a can of drained black beans. I cut my chicken before I cooked it. Very good and simple to make. I also added a couple of chopped jalapeños.

After reading a lot of other reviews, after boiling my chicken, I drained it and cooked it with a package of taco seasoning.  The flavor of this dish was really good.  I found it to be a little too wet though, and would probably make it with only one can of soup next time.

I've made this twice now and I think the original is the best. Just saying it is really easy to tweak so don't be afraid. Second time all I had was sharp cheddar and medium salsa.I used two cups of rice and added 1/2 cup of sour cream to try and tame it a bit. I can actually see making this with ground beef or no meat at all. Heck, maybe a can of refried beans in place of a can of soup. Make it your own.

Love this! I did a couple of different things...my first layer was tortillas, then yellow mexican rice, taco seasoned ground beef, soup/salsa/onion mixture (I used cream of celery since I didn't have cream of mushroom or chicken) then cheese...then repeated the layers. It was outstanding...can't wait for leftovers tonight!

We make this all the time, it goes a long ways.  My family eats it as a burrito though.  I also make it easier by doing it in two pans.  One I cook the rice in.  The second I cook the rest in a skillet.  I cube the chicken into bite sized pieces and brown them and cook them the rest of the way in the soup and salsa mixture.  (I only use the one can of cream of chicken, no more is needed)  It doesnt need all of the cheese either.  I dont even add the cheese to the mixture.  Add the cooked rice to the chicken and soup mixture.  Put some of the mixture on a flour tortilla, add some cheese and fold it up.  Sometimes we fry the burrito in oil and serve it with sour cream...yummy and easy

This is amazing and my new favorite food!  I could eat it every day, maybe forever. :)  I used all cheddar as I had no monterey jack, and half medium and half Newman's Own Hot and it was anything BUT bland, as I read in another review.  It is very flavorful, easy and simply wonderful.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Very good. I am sure it is fine with the soups but I had wonderful turkey broth so thickened that and used instead. I also added ( on a whim) a good sized scoop of Hellman's mayo to the 'soup' part. It gave a nice tang. My husband that doesn't care for poultry or rice really liked it and has asked for it again.  BTW, I used leftover turkey and lots of it since I had roasted one the day before. Great way to use leftovers and cut down on the time also.

Nice, simple crowd pleaser.  It's got a bit more flavor then your traditional casserole.  I skipped the onion and used slightly spice roasted corn & bean salsa from TJs.

Very good.  I made a few changes that others have suggested:  added chilies, used half the onion (browned it first), added have a pkg of taco seasoning, added 1/2 t chili pepper.  This recipe makes A LOT.  Next time I would make half.  Pretty good though.

Fed this to my roommate, boyfriend, and parents - everybody loved it! I used brown rice instead of white (in a vague attempt to be healthier), I used a second cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom, I used hot salsa, and a can of pinto beans. Love this recipe; perfect comfort food with a great texture!

I only made two very small changes to this great casserole.  I bought two rotiserrie hens from the deli at my local grocery and shredded the breasts.  I added a can of drained black beans between the two layers.  Everything else is exactly the same and we loved it.  I typically tweak a recipe to make extra in case the kids have friends drop in for supper, especially on weekends, but this made a very full 9 x 13 pan and we will have leftovers for tomorrow's supper.  Thanks for a wonderful new recipe!

My husband absolutely loved this recipe.  I only used 1 cup of rice to 2 cups of water.  I also used more salsa than the recipe called for, and next time I would use low sodium soups.  We will definitely have this again!

I made my own salsa and  replaced the can soup with bechamel sauce because I don't use any can soup in my cooking.

Very good. I would just make a bit more rice and salsa mix for the suggested size pan. I also opted for pre-cooked, diced chicken breast to make even quicker. Served with salad of iceberg lettuce, tortilla strips, diced watermelon and chipotle ranch dressing.

This was an excellent recipe.  My family loved it.  I did make a few changes, I sauted the chicken and onions in some olive oil and some seasonings.  Then I mixed it all together before I put it in the pan with some of the cheese.  And then sprinkled the remaining cheese on top.  My daughter asked me when I would make it again for dinner!  So in my book this one is a winner.

So yummy. You have to grill the onions first or they will be uncooked.  I also added the frozen corn and then sour cream on top. Both of my boys and my husband just love it.

I made this last night for my husband and I followed the recipe as is except for cutting up the chicken prior to cooking I did season my chicken also cooked it in olive oil and didnt boil it.  Next time I will not cook the rice all the way as it would make it easier to spread and I did not use all the cheese.  Other then that it was a great dish and will make it again

Awesome recipe! My family really enjoyed it. To cut down on calories I used low fat cheese and only used half the amount. I also omitted the cream of mushroom soup. I added more spices because my family likes things really spicey.

I liked it however, alot of prep work for my schedule, I think I will save this recipe for that left over chicken and maybe add some minute rice and have it done in half the time.

Totally easy to make, I had some frozen chicken thighs threw thse bad boys into a pot to de thaw, seasoned them up with some sazon, salt pepper, squeezed out some fresh garllic, and chopped up some onion, for about 20 minutes, while tat was cooking, mixed up the salsa, and the sour cream,  ( didn't have the cream of anything soup) added a can of corn,some chives and some more seasoning, mixed it up and added some more shredded cheese to it. -- Nuked some basmati rice 20 minutes and --due to time restraints I just sprayed pam on the bottom of the glass dish layer of rice-- Chicken on top Creamy mixture, Layered Some cheddar chese ( again had noting else) and a sprinkle of Mustard powder on top -- Cooked for about 45 minutes on 350--- It as perfect. this is a very versitile recipe. LOVE IT. Thanks.for sharing.

Loved it! I used brown rice since it's healthier and added onion powder and garlic powder. Otherwise I followed the recipe and it turned out wonderful!

This a great reciepe for a change ! 
I just would decrease the rice amount next time, and might add little milk or water to make it more juicy, and i felt that the short grain rice ( Egyptian) might be a good ulternative for long grain, as it tend to absorb moisture more and become more soft and help all layers above and under to stick to it.

I think it is a great reciepe also for turkey & meat leftovers.

This is a really tasty easy recipe.  I changed it up quite a bit though.  I used ground turkey cooked with the onions, some garlic powder, and black pepper instead of the chicken.  Added black beans, used only one can of cream of CELERY soup, and used half the cheese.  It was awesome!!

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I did make a few changes because of what I was lacking in my pantry/fridge.  I used only one can of the soup  because that's all I had and I'm glad I did, it would have been too much soup with 2 cans.  I also added some sour cream and hot sauce to the soup/rice mixture.  I think I only ended up using 2 1/2 -3 cups of cheese, and that was enough for us.  I topped this with jalapenos and served with tortilla chips.  I'll make this again with my changes for sure!

this is a great casserole. i gave it 5 stars, but i def think it is missing something crunchy.  I would add some hard shelled tacos or torillas to it after it is done. i also added corn to the soup mix. came out great. my husband loved it.

This is a good basic recipe. I sauteed the onions with the chicken and added a bag of taco seasoning. I layered the rice, the chicken then added a mix of corn and black beans and then the cream of chicken mix and added salsa and then added up crunched up freetos and the shredded cheese and it was delicious!

This is good, but I did change it.  I wanted to make it simple.  Sauteed onion and chicken in a pan with a red pepper.  Also this version doesn't really have any seasoning so I added half a pack of taco seasoning to the sauteed chicken mixture.  Overall a really good idea, I liked how it didn't have whole breasts but pieces.  I also added corn for some crunch, other wise the texture is too mushy.

The only thing I did different was use a Mexican blend of shredded cheese rather than the cheddar cause that's what we had on hand.  This was Super Tasty.  A new favorite.

I love this recipe!  I cook my chicken in the crockpot on low 3 hours with just the salsa.  Then I add in more salsa as needed and the cream of chicken soup.  Then add the rice and cheeses and bake.  I never measure anything so it's a little different each time but always delicious!  Homemade salsa makes it even better!

I thought this recipe had the potential to be really good. My suggestions would be to sautee the onion, the onion in ours was almost raw and the recipe didn't state large or small, so the onion we had was too much and over powered the recipe. To jazz up the recipe, next time I will add 1 tsp. of cumin and a pinch or two of cilantro.

Really, really good. My only complaint was too much onion but that's an easy fix. I would definitely make this again. There's alot of variations you could do on this as well. My husband liked it as well except for the salsa so I may use Rotel instead next time. You could also switch up the cream soups for a different flavor, maybe use a store bought rotisserie chicken for more flavor. Great and versatile dish!

This stuff is crazy good.  Even my fussy wife loved it.  When I make it next time, I won't start cooking the rice until I start chopping the chicken.  It got a little overcooked by the time it went into the oven.  Other than that, everything about this dish was surprisingly excellent.  I had it for dinner, I had seconds and I had it for lunch the next day.  I'm craving it again now.

Made it for the family. Everyone thought it was very flavorful. I did pan fry my chicken with a clove of garlic in olive oil to give some more flavor. We will be making this again!

This is a very tasty casserole! I've made it twice now, and it's even better the next day! My husband did not mind taking leftovers in his lunch! It makes quite a bit, but it never goes to waste here. The only change I made was halving the amount of cheese. Excellent!

It was decent but seemed like a lot of time for the outcome. I added about a half a packet of taco seasoning to the wet ingredients and glad I did or else the flavor would have been bland. We topped with salsa and sour cream. May make this again, but for an hour an d20 minutes I can think of better tasting recipes.

MMMMmm...so good.   I almost did not make this because I did not have a can of cream of mushroom soup.  However, I read Kirstin's review and saw that she had modified it and part of it was to omit the cream of muchroom soup.  So I dmade it like she recommended and added about 1/3 cup of reduced fat sour cream to the soup/salsa mix.  It was wonderful and my husband raved over it.  I will make this recipe often!

This is very good, I've found that if you fry the chicken with some seasoning (whatever you prefer) it adds some flavor.  I also use the mango peach salsa from costco and add a can of black beans!

Its a HIT!  The kids absolutely loved this and asked for it again.  I added mushrooms, can of corn, can of diced tomatoes, 2-3 garlic cloves, 2/3 C fresh cilantro and olives.  I reduced the amount of water based upon the liquids in the corn/tomoatoes.

I used 1.5 cans of HOT Rotel, added one can of corn and one can of black beans.  Wrapped it up in a flour burrito.  My husband ate his with chips.  Delicious, great recipe!  I also used 3 lg cans of chicken instead of chicken breasts, to save on time.  Last thing I'd add is I don't layer, I mix it all together and put it in the baking dish.  Saves time, again.

This was delicious the first night and the next 2 times I ate it (makes great leftovers).  As a newbie to the kitchen, the instructions were easy for me to follow and everything tasted delicious. I recommend this to anyone looking for a great combo of chicken, cheese, and rice.  What's not to love?

I made this tonight, like others the ingredients were what I had on hand.  I kept nearly everything the same.  I used instant brown rice and made it with 1/2 water and 1/2 salsa.  I like others seasoned my chicken with garlic, pepper, and southwest seasoning.  I put rice in pan first then chicken, then the soups/salsa mixture. I didn't find it necessary to mix the cheeses in a bowl first, I just scattered both until covered.  I also added corn t the soup mixture.  My husband said this recipe was a"a keeper"  Thanks!

Pretty good, easy recipe. I used left over rotisserie chicken and brown rice then served with tortilla chips.  My kiddos loved it and asked for more.  Will make again.

Delicious!  I made this last night and am munching on it for lunch today.  This is an excellent casserole!  For mine, I used 1 cup of brown rice, 3 chicken breasts, and added a cup of black beans and also a can of corn.  As other reviewers suggested, I browned the chicken a bit in olive oil and crushed garlic, then added some salsa for the breasts to cook in before adding the soups directly into the pot to simmer.  Used onion powder instead of onions (personal preference), and added a little taco seasoning to the simmering chicken-soup mixture.  Used approximately 14 oz. of salsa.  Since most of the Mexican cheeses were already eaten, I added in Farmer's cheese (what I had on hand), which worked well.    Layering wasn't necessary. This tastes great alone or served with tortilla chips. :)

I really wanted to like this, because I wanted something different for Mexican night. Unfortunately, no one really cared for it in my house. It wasn't unedible, but just very bland and not very pretty.

This easy to customize recipe was excellent! Like many other reviewers, I added frozen corn. Also, I grilled the chicken, onion and diced bell pepper in a large skillet and then added Rotel, cream of mushroom, cream of chicken soup to the skillet. (saves one pan) The casserole came out really COLORFUL because of the yellow corn, red salsa/Rotel, and I added orange bell pepper. Total crowd pleaser! I served it with a punch made of cranberry juice and Fresca (equal parts of both). Everyone loved the meal!

Wow really good! I changed it a little but I don't think it affected the recipe any. I used cheddar which is what I had on hand and used one can cream soup instead of 2 and added a little milk to it. A good dinner! I served this with a wedge salad and spicy homemade ranch ( pkt ranch made as directed + 1/4 cup mild salsa) and corn on the cob. You wont be sorry if you try this!

7yo, 4yo, and hubby approved!!! I used brown rice instead of white, added a can of rotel tomatoes in addition to the salsa, added a can of corn and a can of black beans, added flavor and texture. I also seasoned the chicken with taco seasoning. And I accidently only used 2 cups of cheese (with great results.) It was superb and I will be making it this way in the future.

I sauteed the chicken with garlic and onion in a pan then mixed in the soups. I layered the rice, chicken/soup mixture, salsa then cheese. I would make it again! Great comfort food.

I hate to give this a bad review because of all the good ones.  First I halved the recipe, I used a generic cream of chicken soup, I don't know if thats what made it salty. I sauteed the chicken with a little taco spice and green onions. It was okay, nothing special and not something I would make again.

Excellent.  I used a medium salsa because I like it spicy...next time I may add a can of green chiles too.  Very good.  Oh and I roasted a chicken a couple days ago, shredded it and used that.

This recipe is okay I can eat my way through it, but definitely lacks in the flavor. Think I figured out the secret ingredient to add next time, taco seasoning! I think it would add a lot for the flavor. Aside from that, made recipe as is except I browned the onion and chicken in a pan then added the soup and salsa mixture, then mixed in the rice.

Once you get past the apperance this is a really good dish.  Simple and filling.  Cooked the rice in my steamer (would be lost without it) and cut down on the cheese because 4 cups looked like over kill and my thighs don't need any help.  Good dish to prepare ahead of time and cook at later time.  Wonder if would freeze well?

Great Dish! I boiled my chicken and then cooked the rice in the chicken broth. I used two cans of cream of mushroom mixed with rotel rather than salsa.  I added cumin, chili powder, and garlic seasoning to the mixture.  I added a can of corn to the chicken (a def. must in my opinion).

Great Recipe.  I sauteed the chicken with the onions and a little garlic.  I put it together just as directed, but I used fresh salsa made from 10 roma tomatoes, an onion, some cilantro, 4 serrano peppers, salt and a little water.  I used 3 cups of salsa and the flavor was fantastic.

Made some minor adjustments - a little less rice, 2 cups of cheese instead of 4, omitted the mushroom soup, and used a can of Rotel in place of the salsa, and added some chopped veggies. The family loved it, and I will definitely make it again.

i changed this so much that i think i made my own recipe. wanted to use chickpeas instead of chicken and reduce salt by not using the canned soup. so i mixed 1/2 sourcream with the cooked rice and a bit of cumin. cooked onions first and then added the chickpeas and fresh cilantro to it. layered rice, then chickpea mix, cup and 1/2 of salsa then (only a cup of) the cheese mix. serve with avacado and sliced green onions...mmm.

To make this dish more flavorful, I did several things: First, I added garlic and onion to the rice as it was cooking.  I cut the chicken breasts into 3 or 4 pieces each. Then, I sauteed onion, garlic and green pepper in a little olive oil and added the chicken on top of that to cook almost all the way. On both sides of the chicken, I sprinkled cumin and ground red pepper (cayenne).  Finally, I used medium salsa (Jack's Special- Costco).  This dish was very flavorful, quite spicy and delicious!  I will make it again!

This was great! It didn't seem like it would b but turned out perfect. Only thing I would have done differently was to pan fry the chicken and onions just for the extra flavor.  Thanks for sharing)

This was quick, easy and good.  I followed the directions exactly and used salsa from our local Mexican restaurant.  Everyone loved it and I hardly had any leftovers :)  I would make this again.

Like everyone else said, I decreased the rice to 1 cup. Only used the cream of chicken soup and added a 1/2 -1 c. sour cream. Added in a little onion powder for flavor - would have used cumin but was out. Also added in black beans for a complete meal. Next time, will try it with brown rice.

Good casserole.  I used about half the cheese it called for, and I only used cheddar (that's what I had.)  Whole family liked it... will make again.

I omitted the can of mushroom soup, and used only one Healthy Request Cream of Chicken soup.  I also reduced the cheese by one cup and I added black beans.  I also made with brown rice.  My family really liked this meal and want it put on the menu again.

This was so unbelievably delicious!  My boys couldn't stop eating it and neither could I!!  My friends (and I)were puzzled that mixing cream of mushroom and salsa could make such a great dish.  I also added black beans as I love them and they're a great source of protein and added some corn and grilled green pepper is well.  I did use 2 Cups total of cheese as that seemed to be plenty.  Thanks for this recipe, I will be making it frequently.  It also makes a lot, which was great, because it was nice to have leftovers!

Great casserole!! My family loved it. I tweeked it a little because I like spicier foods. I used all extra sharp cheddar cheese and medium salsa instead of mild. I also substituted Quorn chik'n tenders for the chicken because I am a vegetarian. Easy dinner.

My family really enjoyed this recipe a lot.  I did modify it a little bit.  I used Colby & Monterey Jack cheese instead of the Monterey Jack since it was already preshredded at the store.  I also used hot salsa because it was what I had on hand, and I used 1 Tbsp dried minced onion instead of the fresh onion.  I also combined all the ingredients instead of layering it except for half the cheese which I put on top.  I will definitely be making this one again!  Thanks for the recipe!

My family loved this recipe.  I did modify a bit after reading reviews.  I used rotel instead of salsa; browned the chicken with onions and garlic; combined the cheese, soups and rotel; and used instant rice because that's what I had on hand.  My family told me that they definitely want this again.  Even better as leftovers.

Delicious comfort food at it's best.  I didn't find a need to change this recipe, beyond browning the chicken instead of boiling it (ick!).  It's not something I'd make every day, but sometimes, you just need a good, hearty casserole to make the day go away. :D

Yum!!!  Like others, I diced the chicken first and sautéed with the onion.  Added the salsa and let is simmer and blend flavors.  Added soups, rice,and poured into casserole dish.  Used Colby Jack cheese slices over top and at the advice of another reviewer, sprinkled the top with crushed tortilla chips.  YUM!  DH suggested more chips next time and I'm thinking maybe a little corn and/or green beans (like in some spanish rice recipes!).  I'm thinking since others complained it was bland, they didn't use a good salsa.  Here on the West Coast, we have a brand of salsas called Herdez, I used the medium heat.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!!!

I thought this recipe was almost perfect as is. My husband loved it and he's picky.. so i'm happy. I did brown chicken strips as I don't care for boiled chicken. And I used low sodium soups. I topped it off with sour cream when serving. Excellent!!

I have made this several times and everyone loved it.  I do modify it some by using a can of Rotel (diced tomatoes & green chilies) instead of the salsa.     We also find that it is better the second time warmed up.  Great recipe. I also want to add except for the cheese to top off the dish I mix all the ingredients together.

Excellent.  I added taco seasoning and big dallop of soor cream to the soup mixture.  Put jalepenos and crushed up tortilla chips on table for condiments.  Served with salad.  Ole!!

This was delicious!  The only thing we did differently was sautee the chicken with onion and spices, rather than boil it.  I also put spicy chili beans rather than chicken on one half of the casserole, because I am a vegetarian and the rest of the house is not.  Also, substituted cream of celery for the cream of chicken.  Definitely will make this again!

Dee-licious!  Made exactly as written and it was very good.  Easy to prepare and much to easy to indulge on.  Prepared the same way as a King Ranch Chicken type casserole, except uses rice instead of tortillas.

This recipe is the best!  My whole family loves it.  I cut it in 1/2 for my family of 4.  I also mix everything except the cheese together in a bowl instead of layering like the recipe says, it makes everything taste more moist.

This is a good base recipe. I used 2 cans cream of chicken soup, no mushroom soup. I also used 2 cans of Rotel rather than salsa, added a can of black beans, green chilis, some cumin & chili powder. I mixed everything together rather than layering it and it turned out great.

Quick and Easy!  Since we like things a bit spicy, I added some hot sauce and about 1 TB cumin.  Combined everything but the cheese into the baking dish then topped with cheese.  Served with more hot sauce and sour cream.  Yum...

I really like this recipe.  I think it is easy to adapt to what you have in your cupboards.  Today I am going to make it with spanish rice and a little more chicken.  I don't have any cream of chicken so I will use cheddar cheese soup and cream of mushroom.  I will be able to cut out some of the shredded cheese that way. And I haven't decided on salsa or canned rotel tomatoes.  I haven't used salsa in this recipe yet.    I always always always season the chicken.  I chop it up before I cook it and then cook it in a skillet with some onions and whatever spices tickle my fancy.  A lot of people have been saying it is bland, it is probably because there really isn't any actual seasonings in it.  I really like the thought of eating it with taco shells or wrapped in a tortilla as a burrito.  I think that is how we will eat the left overs.  :)  Happy Eating!!!

We've been making a version of this for years and love it!  I only use cream of mushroom soup in mine.  Also, for a quick week night meal, I use rotisserie chicken.

Easy recipe, good flavor. I baked my chicken in the oven first. I used just 1 cup rice, 2 cups water. When the rice was almost finished I added the chopped onion so it would soften. I used 1 can rotel and the rest salsa. Mixed them with the other canned ingredients then layered per the directions. I used 1/2 the amount of cheese the recipe called for and it was still great. Next time I will try all salsa instead of substituting the rotel.

Definately not bursting with "sass". Boring.  Nothing special.  I mixed everything together instead of layering the rice and stuff, and I highly doubt that would have made any difference.  Eatible, but will not make again.

We absolutely loved this!!  I actually cooked my chicken in the pressurer cooker, which was so quick.  I made this up a couple of days before and then just popped it in the oven.  A great recipe on a busy night.  Thanks for sharing.

We loved this, even the picky little kids we had eating with us.  I wasn't sure that I liked my first bite because it seemed like the layers had not "melted together" or blended.  But as I continued eating, I actually liked the fact that the flavors were separated a little bit.  This is also excellent as leftovers!

I thought this recipe was a little time consuming - having to pre-ccok the chicken and the rice. I like the type of casserole where you put it all together in the oven and let it bake. Also, I just thought the casserole was o.k. tasting - not really too flavorful. My children really didn't like it so I will look for another recipe. Thank you anyway.

I made this yesterday for dinner and it was absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except I had a bit of sour cream left in our fridge and decided to use it up. My parents loved it and my dad even said it would be great as a filling in a tortilla (which I think I'll do next time I make this). Overall this is a great recipe and I will definitely make it again.

Huge hit at my house.  I rarely make a recipe that is as popular as this one.  Usually someone does not like something.  Everyone loved this and are requesting another casserole.  The only change I made was using Minute Rice since I didn't have regular.  Love it

My family loved this casserole! I made it exactly as the recipe said to except I cooked the chicken in my slow cooker for about 4 hours on medium then shredded it with a fork. My family likes the chicken moist and tender better. This was great!

I browned the chicken and then added everything to that pan to mix before placing in a baking dish.  I also added some frozen corn but only used one can of mushroom soup and did not use all the cheese recommended to try and reduce the amount of fat.  It was easy and turned out great.

For perfect, nearly sticky rice (my fav!) for every 1 cup of rice add 1.5 cups of water, bring to a boil, cover & simmer for 20 minutes. Perfect every time! Anyway, I took the advice in one of the reviews to add extra salsa... Oops! Big mistake on my part. I went a little salsa crazy & all I could taste was the salsa! I simmered the chicken in the sauce on the stovetop & I mixed the rice & chicken together. I think 2 cups of cheese is waaay too much, so I only used a handful of cheddar and broiled the casserole for 5 minutes before serving. Overall this is a good weeknight recipe.

OMG! This was great, but my hubby and I both felt like something was missing. Sometime after supper my hubby said "It tastes like the filling in a Taco Bell burrito!" So the next day we got tortillas for the leftover casserole and some taco sauce and oh my goodness! This stuff is heaven as a burrito filling!!

This recipe is absolutely delicious!  I have gotten rave reviews and everyone wants to know how to make it.  Thanks so much for sharing!!!  Since we are a big "rice" family, probably more rice wouldn't hurt - but excellent just the way it is.

Super Yummy!!!  I made this tonight with a couple of modifications.  I used one can cream of chicken and one can of nacho cheese soup.  Added a handfull of black beans and a handfull of frozen corn.  Topped off with a big dollop of cilantro lime sour cream.  Add a side salad and this is definately going in my recipe box!

This was absolutely delicious.  My only regret is cutting the recipe in half and now there are no leftovers.  I used a can of cream of chicken and only a handful of cheddar cheese I also made some instant rice in the microwave.  With the advice of others, I poured salsa and sour cream on everyone's plate.  I also cooked the chicken and onions with a little bit of onion and seasoning then added the soup and salsa to the pan.  Since the recipe was cut in half I only had one layer of rice, chicken and cheese.  I cant wait to make this recipe again.

My family LOVED this recipe, including my 4 year old daughter and 7 year old son. My son had 3 helpings! The kids even ate their veggies, as they were able to mix them in with the casserole. My husband and I put some jalapenos on top to spice things up a bit!

This recipe was really good and easy.  It also makes a lot and we had a ton of  of leftovers.  The only thing I did different was that I sauteed the chicken and onions together and added a spoonful of sour cream at the end.  I will make this again. Thanks.

I didn't love this recipe, but my husband really enjoyed it.  I added black beans to it and that seemed to help, but I thought it could use a little more taste.  I'm not sure I will make it again.

Yum!  I made a few changes based on ingredients I had available.  Instead of the cream of chicken and cream of celery soup, I used Campbell's Southwest Pepper Jack Cheese Soup.  I also added 1 cup of chopped yellow and orange peppers.  I thought it could have used a little more rice, but it was very tasty!

This was a great recipe.  Leftovers were great too.  I did make a few changes that others suggest... I cooked the chicken and onion together in a skillet, used rotel, rather than salsa, added some taco seasoning and since I didn't have any jack cheese, I just used cheddar.  DH says this one is a keeper for sure!

I modified by using Campbell's "creamy chicken verde" soup...gave it a little spicy tang.  I also decreased the cheese to lower the fat content.  Kids loved it.

Family loved it! Cut corners by cutting up a roasted chicken from the grocery store. Sauteed the onions and then added to the soup mix. Added 1/2 can of refried black beans to the rice for added flavor and fiber. Great way to used left over cooked white rice and left over salsa. Delicious!

This is very good!  I only gave it 4 stars, because I did some upgrades.  Used Medium Salsa, instead of boiling the chicken I cubed it and cooked in some olive oil with the onions.  I also added black beans and frozen corn with the layers (layed them ontop of the chicken).  And... I added taco seasoning to the chicken and only used cream of chicken soup (omitted the mushroom soup).  Cooked up very nicely in the layers, the sauce went down through and everything was moist.  Cooked for 40 minutes covered and then 10 uncovered in the overn.  Served with tortilla chips and sourcream!  Thanks.

YUMMY!!  This recipe is SO SO good, I can't wait to make it again!!  I took others' suggestions and made these changes. I used Spanish rice, added corn, omitted the mushroom soup and added a couple of tablespoons of sour cream, reduced the amount of cheese, sauteed the onion with the chicken and used medium salsa rather than mild. This meal had so much flavor!  I will be making this one again and again!!

I also cooked my chicken and onions together, then added green peppers,  steamed my rice in a veggie steamer, mixed 2 cans of cream of chicken soup (b/c of a mushroom allergy) and a can of rotel together and layered it all as directed w/ the cheese. It was better than I was expecting.  My husband, who doesn't eat leftovers, ate it three days in a row and we agreed it was still tasty when reheated.  Will def make again.  Thanks for a simple and filling meal idea.

We aren't casserole lovers, but this one is VERY good. I boiled the chicken with Italian seasoning. I will use less cheese next time. I also only used cream of chicken soup and sour cream.(instead of cream of mushroom) A keeper!

I made a couple of modifications but it turned out wonderful. Instead of the Chicken Breast I used 4 chicken hindquarters and instead of the salsa I used about 2 cups of leftover Pico de Gallo. The raw tomatoes and onions in the pico provided some nice texture. Only other change was I added some chili powder and chipotle seasoning. Will definitely make this again.

This recipe is very tasty. I used brown rice instead of white to make it healthier and added some corn. I also added some sour cream to the soup mixture. I took the time to do all the layering but honestly next time I'll make it simple and do one big layer of each. The leftovers were even better the next day.

I was surprised given the limited ingredient list, this casserole really was delicious. I skipped the chicken and I just mixed everything together rather than layering, but it was fantastic.  My children gave it two thumbs up !!!

I love this recipe!  It is very good as-is. However, I need less calories than 588 so like most people I have adjusted it a bit.  I use brown rice instead of white - healthier and I thought it gave more flavor.  I use the cream of mushroom with garlic to add a little zing.  I look for reduced fat or sodium on all of the soups because that's alot of sodium in a serving.  I'm going to use reduced fat cheddar next time just to cut the calories back a bit.  We'll see since I don't think the reduced cheddar melts as nicely - if it doesn't I'll go back to normal cheddar.  Also, 1/8th of the recipe is huge with all of the layers involved and so this lasted a few days more than expected - which was A-OK with my family because they loved it!!

I thought this was just okay, but my family LOVED it.  I will probably make this again, but next time I might try green chili instead of salsa.  To me it tasted like queso dip mixed with rice and chicken.

My husband and I both loved this recipe.  Based on the feedback here, I used a medium salsa and only half an onion (although, it was pretty big to begin with).  It makes quite a bit and should be great for leftovers.

I made these into enchiladas instead of a casserole.  I spread the rice on the bottom of the tortilla, then the chicken mixture on top, then into oven.  It was so good!!

This was pretty good, and easy to make with stuff I had in the pantry. I did make a few changes: Added one can of drained golden hominy to the rice to give this more of a tex-mex flair, Only used one can of soup (celery) because I halved the recipe, substituted a can of Rotel tomatos for the salsa, green onions for white, and added 1/2c. chopped red bell pepper.  I also added about 1/2 cup of sour cream to the soup mixture.  Small changes, but made for a very tasty casserole!

This was really good.  I made some changes though.  I cut the recipe in half using only cream of mushroom.  I used only enough water to cover the chicken.  Then I generously covered the chicken with Southwestern Seasoning. I used medium salsa and 1/2 sharp cheddar, 1/2 pepper jack cheese.

It came out really yummy.  Next time I think I will do the same thing, but cook the chicken with taco seasoning.


**Well after my dh polished off the leftovers without me, I think next time I will make the full recipe.  Thanks again.**

Good recipe! I think next time I'll use medium salsa instead of mild and season the chicken. We thought it was a little on the bland side.

I enjoyed the recipe and will probably make it again, but I will change it--add more rice and chicken.  I thought it was a bit too soupey.  I still liked it though

This was very good.  I subbed lower fat ingreds where I could and added seasoning to the chicken.  I agree it needs a bit more "kick", which you could add with hotter salsa.  I am looking forwards to using the leftovers in quesadillas/soft tacos.

A great way to use up left-over rottiserie chicken.  My finicky nine year old loved it.  I snuck in a whole bunch of fresh baby spinach (folded it into the soup mixture) and he still loved it!  This is easy to make with on-hand ingredients- instead of cheddar I used up the mozarella, havarti and american cheese that had been lingering in the fridge.

This recipe was so delicious.... but so stuffed with fat and calories, it might not be safe to have very often. definately a once-a-year recipe.

Excellent recipe -- quick, easy, tasty.  I used the hot (instead of mild style) salsa, which made it nice and spicy.  Also, I used Kraft's cheddar-jack pre-shredded cheese, which made it even quicker and easier.

Kids liked it which is what matters most.  I tried seasoning the chicken slightly with taco seasoning, but I think what made the difference is the soup.  I used one can of the cream of chicken, but substituted the other can if soup with cream of jalapeño soup that I had.

I’ve been on a Sunday casserole kick lately in order to give us lunch through the week, and this one makes the cut. I made a couple of modifications...I used a rotisserie chicken (shredded), and I used medium salsa instead of mild. I mixed the soup mixture in with the chicken before spreading. I also made this into more of a “lasagna” by layering flour tortillas in as well. I topped mine with sour cream & my husband topped his with guacamole, and we both had a few pickled jalapeños and a side of blue corn chips. Our son ate it as-is with a side of chips. It seemed to be lacking just a little bit of freshness, but I’m not sure what else I would change to bring that to the dish...maybe top with lettuce & tomato. All in all, I think this one will be added to our Sunday casserole rotation.

I added about a cup of ranch, 2 cans of corn, and cooked the chicken with diced green pepper, onion, a clove of garlic, and taco seasoning. I also added about 3/4 cup chicken stock. Soooo good!!

It was very delicious and the texture was just right, I chopped up 1/4th cup of celery and for the topping crust I crushed saltine crackers and melted butter as well as taco shredded cheese and put the crust on about 15 minutes before it was done ! It was just perfect!

Excellent weeknight casserole.  I made extra and froze a container, which I’ll defrost and use another time.  I did add sautéed onions and peppers in herbed butter but even without this addition, a great meal.  Thank you for sharing.

Great recipe! I had to change it up a bit though. I didnt have chicken thawed so I chopped up onion and sauteed with ground beef and seasoned with taco seasoning and garlic powder. I used Zatarrains yellow rice in place of white rice. It turned out great and even pleased my picky eater. I paired with chips and queso, crowd pleaser!!

I couldn’t bring myself to boil the chicken breasts. In the video it just looked so soggy. I cut them up and sautéed them with a green pepper and onion with chicken taco seasoning and some cilantro. I kid you not my honey ate half the pan by himself and wants it again soon. Definite keeper.

When I tried to spread the rice in the pan, there wasn't nearly enough! So I added a can of black beans and a can of corn. To the soup and salsa mixture, I added a tsp cumin. Otherwise, I made it as called for and we all loved it!! Next time, tho, I will add a can of green chiles, and not bother layering, b/c really, we couldn't tell.

We had leftover rice and chicken, so not only was making this a no brainer, it was a breeze as well!  Fast and easy, and OH SO GOOD!  His Majesty actually made this and was so proud of himself.  We like a little spice, so we are thinking about increasing the salsa next time, and perhaps using a medium or spicy salsa instead, or adding a bit of hot paprika, ancho or chipotle chili spice to kick it up a bit.  We're definitely making this again!  For any make ahead cooks out there - we will be experimenting with making this then vacuum packing the container and freezing.  Our plan is to take it camping then throwing the frozen casserole into a pot of water and bringing it up to a boil.  Easy heat and eat.  We'll report once we've tried it.  Thanks Gweneth for a great recipe that my hubby wants to make himself.  It's a real keeper of a recipe.

I gave this recipe 5 stars for it's versatility. My family likes heat with their Mexican food and I don't like anything spicy. As written, I thought the recipe looked to bland for us. Here are the changes I made. I used 2 packs of Knorr Spanish Rice. I used 2 cans of Kirkland brand chicken. I sauteed the chicken in olive oil along with onions and green peppers. I combined cream of chicken soup and the salsa and added that to the chicken mixture. Tossed in a can of drained black beans and fire roasted corn. Topped with crushed Doritos and Mexican style cheese. Covered with foil and baked 40 minutes. I omitted the sour cream because I'm lactose intolerant.  Hubby and kids added it to theirs. This recipe is a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

I browned the chicken and sautéed the onion(added garlic as well).  It makes the casserole have a deeper flavor.

Really good! I didn't layer anything. I added a can of black beans and just mixed everything together, except for the cheese. I added half the cheese to the mix and put the other half on top. I baked it in a dutch oven with the lid off. Easy and delicious. It's a keeper.

I was able to use my leftover salsa in this recipe.  I used brown rice, pepper jack cheese and Mexican cheese as I did not want to go to the store.  I would do the same cheeses again, it was very tasty.

We didn't add the onion- but this was so good! It was fairly easy to make and made a huge pan, so we will have lots of leftovers. My husband loved it too!

I love how versatile this recipe is. I made it, LOVED it, and made it again with a few differences just based on what I had in my pantry. This recipe is a WINNER. Easy and delicious.

I love making this dish!! the second time I made it- I cut the chicken into cubes before boiling it. added a can of corn and black beans into the soup/sala mixture. after chicken was cooked I put some taco seasoning on the chicken. made 2 1/2 cups instant rice and 1 8oz bag of cheese divided in half for the 2 layers!

This is definitely a go to at my house.  I omitted the onion because my family doesn’t care for it plus the salsa has some in it already. Also mixed everything together vs layering it and it came out great!

I made this for dinner yesterday and my family loved it! I did some things different. I cooked the chicken in the crockpot on high for 3 1/2 hours. I put a can of chicken broth and a pack of taco season. The chicken came out really tender and not dry. I pre made mexican rice. I also used a can of rotel instead of salsa. Once everything was done I put it all in a casserole dish and cooked in the oven for 30 minutes.

I substituted chives for onion because of my allergy to onion & added jalapeno cheddar for extra flavour. It was amazing & very easy for a beginner such as myself :)

Next time, I will double the amount of rice. When it came out of the oven I thought it would be really soupy but once it set up it was very good. Are used hot or salsa and also added some garlic salsa into the recipe. It is not bland whatsoever with the hotter salsa and garlic salsa. I will be making this again!

Followed recipe exactly. It was delicious. I used thin cut chicken breasts and they were a little over cooked at 20 minutes. I would use the thick cut chicken breasts next time, as I would like more chicken in it. I feel like ground beef would be really yummy in place of the chicken too. Might experiment with that next time!

This a great basic recipe to tweak to your liking. I did as others suggested and cut up the chicken and browned it with the onion and added a packet of chicken taco seasoning. For the soups I used fiesta nacho and cream of sweet corn and a can of rotel instead of salsa. I also added a can of corn. I will say it is a lot of rice, so I will scale that back next time. I will definitely be making this again!

I cooked the chicken in olive oil with the onion, 1 tsp of minced garlic, and 1 tsp of cumin. I used 1 cup pepper jack cheese, 1/2 cheddar, 2 and 1/2 fiesta blend. I used a black bean and corn salsa mmh. I also used 2 cream of mushroom instead of chicken. Over all this was good. I also saw no need in layering all this separately. Once the chicken was done I added the other ingredients followed by the rice. I did layer with Cheese in the middle. My husband and son liked it which is saying a lot. I still thought it was slightly bland. I topped it off with a little salsa and sour cream which did the trick. Next time I make it I will tweak it a little more and either do more salsa or take out 1 can of soup. I’m thinking take a can of soup out. Over all it is a good recipe!

I made exactly as stated.  I didn't think it was that great.  It was bland tasting to me.  I think with more spicy salsa and maybe more seasonings & a bit less cheese it might be better.  I most likely will not be making this again.

Very Good. I will make more rice the next time. I wanted a solid base of rice and with that there was very little to add to 2nd layer.

Not sure if I will make this again. I think the two cans of soup was a little much but perhaps more salsa would make it tastier.

I added red pepper flakes, Rotel, chili powder and onion powder for a little extra spice to the recipe.  It was a hit with my family!  I will definitely make it again.

So good!! Seasoned chicken with taco seasoning, S&P and other spices, cooked rice in chicken broth, added sauteed onions, used more rice, more salsa and used up all the different cheeses I had on hand. Home run in my house.

Made it just as recipes states.  It was wonderful!  Love it.  In fact, I shared with co-workers and they also made it and loved it!  My husband said he could eat it at every meal.  We love it!

These are ingredients that I use for many of my casseroles. I usually saute my onions and any other veggies like peppers, garlic, celery with  turkey burger for heart smart so I will either use chicken or beef bouillon and whatever spices. These will brown/saute with veggies. Then I put flour for thickening to make a rue. Then add enough water to have a thick gravy consistency. Then I decide what cream soups I wish to use. I like to add a couple eggs. I layer this with rice or noodles and cheese.

I read and followed some others suggestions. I sautéed the chicken with taco seasoning. I didn’t have cream of mushroom so I just used two cans big cream of chicken.  I added a little cumin and cheddar to the cream of chicken. 
This was really gooooood!!!!

Flavor is SO GOOD! Huge hit in my house. Only difference I did about half as much cheese (and that was almost too much). I would also add more rice next time. But this feeds an army!  I will def make again.

Sorry. My family really didn’t care for this. The chicken was unappealing. I tried it again after baking crispy chicken tenders and it was a new dish. Not original recipe I know. But I got the inspiration from that

I don't know why I keep  trying these recipes with canned soups, way too much sodium. Flavor is good but not a healthy choice. Will stick to a white sauce with seasoning.

This seemed like a nice recipe to me, but adding 2 cans of condensed soup is like committing suicide.  I omitted the soup and used 2 cups of Picante style salsa which is quite watery compared to chunky varieties.  Covered while baking kept it moist enough for my liking.  Water could be added if it seems too dry.  The 1000+ grams of sodium per serving was cut by more than half.

LOVE this recipe !! I Add more spice to the chicken (you can use whatever you have as far as cooked chicken &  spices ) add 1 can of corn and 1 can of black beans (drained) . It's so very good and easy and my men LOVE it ! Last night we had leftovers on warmed soft corn tortillas made basically like a taco (sour cream, salsa, lettuce, tomato) THIS recipe is a keeper !!! I've made it once a week since I found it  BY REQUEST

This is a good family style casserole, but it needs more spice for our tastes.  I also prefer sautéing the chicken and onion.  I took one reviewer's suggestion to add taco seasoning to the chicken, which improved the flavour.  It's not really necessary to layer this dish.  It can be all mixed together, reserving half of the cheese to sprinkle on the top.

Easy and delicious. I subbed cream of celery for the cream of mushroom .  Also instead of boiling chicken I sautéed breasts in pan- using a little olive oil and seasoned with a little sprinkle of cumin, paprika and chili powder.

I am giving this recipe 4 stars because it is a good base recipe you can adjust to your family's preferences.  I halved it for our family of 4. Some changes I made are I used brown rice. .  I used a can of Rotel rather than the salsa and added some black beans.  I did liberally season the chicken with taco seasoning.   I  then  simply dumped everything together (except the cheese) in a casserole dish and baked it till the chicken was cooked (about an hour).  I then shredded/cut up the chicken, added the cheese, covered with foil, and continued baking  till the cheese was melted.

Prepared as written, except for cutting up and frying the chicken instead of boiling it.  Used medium salsa.  The whole family likes it, even the nine year olds.

This was a very filling dish. But the flavor was a bit bland and it had a very tangy after taste I didn't care for. I did make a few changes to the dish but not enough to not give a review.

I seasoned raw chicken breast with taco seasoning and cut it in strips and cooked until just a touch underdone. Then I cooked the diced onion in the same pan since I didn't want to risk the onions being undercooked as other reviewers noted. I cooked the rice in the soup mixture in the oven after assembling it all together. I mixed the soups and salsa, then the rice (plus 1/2-3/4 cup more since it didn't look like there'd be enough) and onion together then added 1 1/2 canfuls of water to help cook the rice. Pour the mixture over the chicken and cook on 425* for about 40-60 minutes covered depending on your rice.

I totally loved this dish. It's turning chilly here in Chicago, and I wanted to make some comfort food that would freeze well. I did pan fry the chicken and threw the onions in about halfway through. I also added some chopped up pickled jalapenos, because I prefer my dishes to be spicy. Those were the only two modifications I made. It was delicious and I would definitely make it again.

Huge hit with everyone!   For the chicken, I used a short cut - the frozen pre-grilled chicken you can get from the grocery store.   You couldn't even tell because everything was so moist and delicious.  This is definitely be a regular for us from now on!

Thought it was pretty good as written.  The only thing I did different was to use minute rice cooked in chicken stock as that is what I had on hand.  I also sprinkled a package of taco seasoning on the chicken and browned it first before pouring in the last of my chicken stock in the container in the pan and braising it.

Too gooey - 
I found this very tasty, using the guidance of other reviewers and adding taco seasoning and onions to the browning chicken tenders, which i then mixed in to the other components whole.  The tenders are small strips and they add a little variety in the texture.  I also used Herr's Black Bean and Corn Salsa, which provided just the right - not too spicy - kick to the dish, with a slightly different salsa flavor.  However, i found the rice and soup mixture to be distractingly gooey.  And that is with a fair amount of onions that release moisture as they cook.  Next time i'll cut the condensed soups with some broth or water, and keep the total to 2 soup cans worth.

With the changes I made following other reviews this was pretty good.   
1) I fried the chopped up chicken (bite-size pieces) with onion and sweet pepper. Added 1 tsp cumin and 1 tsp chili powder. Put aside to cool.
2) I cooked brown rice in chicken stock, about twice what the menu said.  
3) I used medium salsa.  
4) I cut the cheese in half.  
5) I used two cans of cream of chicken.  

My husband and son liked it and scarfed it and said it was a keeper.

I had to create an account just so I could review this recipe.  Everyone in my house loved it, and that is a very rare thing.  This will start in our regular rotation! I only made one ingredient change, and that was to use Cream of Celery instead of Cream of Chicken - I don't like Cream of Chicken.  I also made some prep changes to save time.  1. I used rotisserie chicken and shredded it. 2. I cooked the rice in my rice cooker ahead of time  3. I mixed the chicken, soups, salsa and cheese together in one bowl, and used that to layer over the rice. 4. I sauteed the onion before adding it to the mix. Both my kids and the husband cleaned their plates!

I have made this exactly as the recipe is written for a number of years, and it is fantastic. The whole family loves it when I make this dish. I serve sour cream, taco chips and shredded lettuce along with this. I want to add that this is relatively low in calories in comparison to other chicken and rice casseroles.

Actually this is the FOURTH time that I make this recipe. Great for a freezing cold night- good for A football party... STICKS to the ribs. Comfort food, Creamy, filling...not an expensive meal, either! Based on one other review- I used some more spicy salsa.. easy peasy- serve with hot sauce for those who like their taste buds kicked!

Family loved it. Instead of layers next time mix it all together then spread in pan. Flavors did not spread well. Also I'm going to cook the onion a little first. It was delicious and I'll definitely make it again.

Reading the recipe I thought this can't possibly be any good.  But trusted the reviews and made it.  Glad I did.  My husband is a tough critic and he loved this.  And considering how easy it is to make I'll definitely be making it again.

This recipe was wonderful! The only thing I did different was to Saute the onion and garlic together and add the soups and salsa and chicken in one pan and then layered them with the rice and cheese. Family loved it, and I will make this again.

Great flavor. Pretty easy. We try to do a few less steps to save time and cut down on dishes (ex. We don't miss the cheeses together we just alternate cheeses in layers). Super good :)

Too bland.  The kids didn't care for it.  The flavors didn't meld together, so the chicken, which I seasoned and sautéed first, didn't have any of the flavors of the sauce.

I rated this a 3 star the first time we made, but now I'd give it a 4 with changes.  I would've just updated the other review, except with this format you can't find your own reviews that easy. That said if this recipe is a good starting point for you try others suggestions like adding black or kidney beans, cumin (we'd used 1/4 tsp but going to 1/2 tsp next time).  Adding green chilies was helpful also.  We usually use a mild salsa so had it been med or hot probably wouldn't use chilies.  We also decided after last nights meal that if using beans we won't use as much rice.  This is a keeper for sure now.  Very flexible to your own personal tastes.

Yummy! I did make some changes, however. I sauteed the onion with some chopped bell peppers (2) and half a jalapeno. I also sauteed the chicken in some olive oil and seasoned it with 1 tsp. each of cumin, oregano, adobo and garlic powder. I only used one can of cream of mushroom soup and a whole jar of salsa. I also added a can of drained and rinsed black beans. I would have thrown in a can of corn too, but I didn't have any. I used less cheese than called for too. I topped it all off with a can of enchilada sauce, a little cheddar and a small can of sliced black olives. Will definitely make this again. Maybe will try half rice/half quinoa next time.

I made a couple of changes.  I replaced the cream of mushroom soup with chili sauce with green peppers. So good. I will definitely make it again. Next time I'll add more chicken or make a smaller amount. Will be a great dish to take to our monthly boat club dinner. As good or better after the first day.

This is a great base recipe.  I tweaked it to my family's likes.  I pan fried chicken then shredded it.  I sautéed mushrooms and onions.  I added corn and only put cheese on the top.  I covered it for about 30 minutes and took off the foil for  the last 1o, and the broiler for 5 minutes

I am not a great cook and my boyfriend  gets scared when I am anywhere near a kitchen. I made this for him and his friends and they all LOVED it and told me to give it 5 stars. 

I added canned corn. Would be good with black beans too. Served with sour cream, green onions, and siracha at the table.

It looked like a quick tasty meal but it muddled the flavors and it was not that quick to make.

This is a great casserole.  Recipe make a lot and freezes well.  I add some frozen corn (defrosted) and some chopped red pepper and mushrooms to the mix.  Extra flavour and a chance to add more veggies to the table

Made this first as written and it was very good. Used spicy salsa and my family not only devoured it but asked me to repeat. The second time I doubled the recipe but didn't use enough salsa which was great for grandkids but the rest of us really missed the spicy hot salsa. Still good, comfort food meal. Could add frozen corn or probably any vegetable.

My husband loved this. He's not big on spicy food so I thought the mild salsa would be perfect but I thought it was a little bland. While he liked it a lot, he said I could "kick it up a notch" next time, but this one's definitely "a keeper."

I made this recipe, and I also thought it was a good 'base' recipe but needed a little help.  I read several of the other reviews and agree that maybe a brown rice would be better, as well as some salt. I also cooked the chicken in the pan with the onions with a little olive oil and used some Louisiana Cajun Seasoning on the chicken. Next time I will shred the chicken rather than have chunks. I added a sprinkle of garlic power to the soups and Rotel mixture and just a little corn. It turned out pretty well,  but I still might be tempted to tweak it again.

I like this recipe, but it's rather time consuming and uses a lot of dishes.  I used brown instant rice instead of white, strictly because that's what my family prefers. Next time I make it I will put my chicken in the slow cooker while I'm at work and I'll only use half an onion. Otherwise, my family really enjoyed it.

Made some changes based on the comments: used brown instead of white rice, used a low sodium cream of chicken, and substituted sliced mushrooms for the cream of mushroom soup.  I sauteed the onion and mushrooms together and sauteed the chicken separately in taco seasonings, but unfortunately I forgot to add cumin and garlic :( I am quite pleased with how it came out and will probably be making it again.

It was actually pretty bland and all the cream of chicken/mushroom was just too much for me. Anyways, if I were to make this again, I'd definitely add taco seasoning to the chicken. I'd add some jalapeños, tomatoes etc. I'd also take out the cream of mushroom all together. I'd maybe even add a layer of corn tortilla shells.

I lived this recipe but gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of modifications and because I liked it a lot more than my kids. Sautéed the chicken instead of boiling and added a bit of taco seasoning to it. I also made a section of this with tofu because I don't like chicken and it was fantastic with the tofu. I used the healthier version of the chicken and mushroom soups.

Made this today for a covered dish and loved it. I made these changes:
I sautéed the onions in butter with a few cloves of garlic. Added 1 cup white rice , water and a teaspoon of chicken bullion to cook all.
I sprinkled cumin and chili powder over the chicken breasts, drizzled them with olive oil and roasted at 425 till just cooked thru. 
I tossed the cooked, chopped chicken breast with 1 can of the cream soup, Rotel in place of the salsa, and a finely chopped jalapeño pepper. 
I used only one layer of each-rice on the bottom, chicken/Rotel mixture next layer, sprinkled a can of black beans over the chicken mixture and covered it all with a nice layer of the grated cheese. 
After baking I sprinkled the top with chopped green onion and served with sour cream. Yummy!!

My husband and I loved this recipe. Sadly my kids did not so it will not be a stable in our house, but is a recipe I will keep around for pot luck opportunities. The only thing I did different was mix all ingredients instead of layering them. I used brown rice and cooked it in low sodium chicken broth.

My husband loved this recipe.  I usually read reviews before making a new recipe and then make my own decision on substitions.  I did use brown rice instead of white, and less soup/more salsa and low fat cheese.  I used one low sodium soup and one low fat, no problem!  

It was delicious and kept well for leftovers.  The first thing my husband said, what do I call this when I'm asking for it again....

This was very good.  I probably won't add onion again, since the salsa I used already had quite a bit of onion.   Or, as one viewer suggested, I think it's important to saute the onion first if you do choose to use it.

This was way too bland for me. Season up that chicken and bake it (or fry it). Fry the onions to carmelize before adding to casserole. I guess they are relying on the seasonings in the salsa but I would add more.

I ended up using this as a base recipe and changed it up some.  First I sauteed the rice with about  1/2c of onions with a pinch of salt . I cut the chicken into bite size chunks, seasoned them with taco seasoning then cooked them with another 1/2c of onion. I added a bag of frozen corn and some leftover black beans, about 1 1/2c. I did not use the cans of soup. I layered the rice, corn, black beans, chicken, salsa, then cheese and baked it for 15 minutes.  After it was done I added a dollop of guacamole and some cilantro.  My children loved it.

My kids all liked it, so that's a win at my house.  Instead of boiling the chicken I cooked it in a pan with onions and garlic.  I also only used one can of soup and mixed it and the salsa with the rice.  It turned out well.

While it had different steps involved in the prep, this was an easy dish that I know I will make again, maybe even adding some black beans. I used a 22 oz can of cream of chicken soup and not the cream of mushroom. I put about a teaspoon of dried, minced onion in place of onion. It turned out great. I put a dollop of sour cream on mine. I think it would taste great with tortilla chips, too.

Instead of poaching the chicken, I cut it up and browned it in a bit of olive oil along with the onion and a little garlic. Instead of mild salsa, I used medium salsa as that was what I had on hand. I made no other modifications and thought it was pretty good. I will make again.

Nice recipe. I added  a can of Ortega chopped chilies, which was a nice addition. Otherwise, tasty.

loved this recipe. It was easy and quick to make. I did make a few changes. First I used only 1 cup of rice and 1 cup of riced cauliflower. The riced cauliflower made a very nice  healthy change to the recipe and no one in my family even noticed . I used the riced cauliflower from Trader Joe's. Just to make it easy I used rotisserie chicken . Also as some others suggested I mixed everything together except the cheese. I layered the soup  mixture and cheese. Covered with foil baked 20 minutes then finished the baking uncovered. I think next time I try this recipe I am going to try only  using the riced cauliflower  and no regular rice. Yum.

My Family and I loved it . I did add taco seasoning salt pepper and garlic to the chicken to give it a boost of flavor. I did double the recipe because i had feed five of us. I will make this again.

I followed the changes by Crystal S. Just a note: I always poach my chicken in chicken stock for a deeper flavor. Good basic recipe. Thanks!

This was a fairly simple dinner to prepare and delicious too!  I used basmati rice that I flavored with lime and cilantro.  I used a high quality fresh salsa. I sautéed the chicken and onions together.    The cheese could be reduced but that's a matter of personal of preference. Tasty and filling.

I completely changed the cooking technique, and reduced some of the ingredients.  I wouldn't have given this anymore stars, the way it was written.  Too many unnecessary steps and dirty dishes.

This is a great dish, any time of year.  It's an extremely easy, quick meal, especially when you prepare it the night before; just pop it in the oven (it seems better that way, anyway).

Every time I make this its a big hit with my family and I. I tend to use a 24oz bottle of salsa when I make this recipe. I've made it both with chicken and ground beef. Either way it's a delicious quick meal.

Changes I made:  I cut up the raw chicken and cooked it with the onion (and added 3 cloves garlic to chicken and onion).  Then I added 1 can (rinsed) black beans and 1 can (drained) corn kernels to chicken.  I used a deep 9" square dish.  I cooked the casserole for 30 min covered in foil and 15 min without foil until cheese on top was melted and casserole was bubbling.  

I thought this was fabulous!  Served with a little more salsa on top.  Next time, I'll add a little cotijo cheese to the cheese mix!

Took a little longer to cook than suggested, mainly because the onions were still tough. We made a few tweaks, grilled the chicken instead of boiling (Ick) and added a packet of taco seasoning to the soup. Also added chili powder and jalapenos because we like it spicy! Next time I'm going to grill the onions with the chicken before adding to the casserole.

Definitely a keeper.  Husband loved it.  I did use chicken I had cooked/shredded that I keep in freezer for quick meals and sauted the onions first as we love onions but wanted to make sure they were done.  Not real spicy but that was fine by us.

Turned out great. I used 3 cups of cheese and even that might be a lot. I did use a can of fat free cream of mushroom and low fat cheese and didn't miss it. Next time I'm adding a pepper to spice it up but I like the heat of peppers in food.

Sauteed raw chicken breast cubes, 1 sweet onion, I chopped red pepper, s&p, cumin, garlic powder in avocado oil, then simmered. Used basmati rice. Used an extra cup+ nacho cheese for mild heat. Made 6 hours in advance, removed from fridge for an hour then baked as instructed. Awesome! Rave reviews.

A good base recipe but could use some texture and a bit more spice.Try adding some additional peppers in salsa and add crunch with bits of taco chips on top. Might want to try it with pasta in lieu of rice for variety.

I'm about to be that person who gives a less than glowing review for a recipe she did not follow exactly. Apologies in advance; it wasn't bad, but it was very bland. I halved the recipe, omitted the cream of mushroom (half recipe only needed a half can of each, so I used a whole can of cream of chicken) used shredded cooked chicken I already had, mixed the soup, salsa & onions with the cooked rice before layering, subbed pepper jack for the monterey jack, and only baked for 20 minutes (everything was already cooked and it was plenty hot by then). Next time, would definitely add chili powder and cumin, and maybe a can of diced green chiles and some olives. I also thought there was too much cheese (and I LOVE cheese). I think I'd cut the cheese in half and only use it on top. Husband and I ate it dip-style with tortilla chips, which he liked. I usually have all of these ingredients on hand, so with a little doctoring, I can see us trying this again.

This was a pretty easy recipe to make, but I made it as-written and agree with those who said that it was kind of bland. The boiled chicken and white rice fill out the baking dish but don't do much to enhance the final flavor. I think the concept is fine and I might try making the dish again with some modifications. Instead of boiling the chicken, I would suggest brushing it with oil and southwestern spices and roasting it in the oven. It's nearly as fast and easy as boiling and will yield a much nicer flavor and texture. I would also do what some others have suggested and use a Spanish or Mexican rice instead of plain white rice. (I also found that I had more rice than I needed with this recipe and had to leave some out so that I didn't overfill my baking dish.) I would also sauté the chopped onion, along with a clove of minced garlic. And while I'm a big fan of cheese, I'd probably cut that back a bit too, maybe 3 cups total instead of 4, because it just seemed like a bit too much at the end.

i cooked the chicken with onion and garlic and taco seasoning. Used 1/2 the brown rice and 1 can drained black beans. 1 can cream of chicken soup and salsa. Everything mixed together and baked. DELICIOUS!

I thought this recipe was really really good!  I followed the original recipe ALMOST exactly, but I think there are a few things that were necessary.  I used 2 cups monteray jack cheese, and 2 cups shredded Velveeta cheese.  This made the cheese flavor a little stronger, as my family loves the traditional salsa/velveeta queso dip.  I also cooked the chicken in a pan and added the onions to saute, and then shredded the chicken instead of cutting it into cubes.  I think you should at least have 1.5 lbs of chicken with this, because there's too much sauce witthout it.  Or a little more rice to thinken it up a bit.  But it really was great!!  It made a lot and we are looking forward to the leftovers!

I only gave this a 3 because I had to make so many changes to fix how bland it was.  Instead of all salsa, I used a can of Rotel with diced green chilies and topped it up to the 1 1/2 cups with mild salsa. I also used both dark and light meat for better flavor.  Rather than layering, I mixed the cooked rice, both soups, onion and salsa together along with about 1 tsp salt and 1 tsp cumin.  Then I stirred in the chicken and half the cheese.  I sprinkled the remaining cheese over the top after pouring into the pan.  The cooking time is confusing.  In one place it says an hour and at the end it says 40 minutes.  I baked for 40 minutes, took off the foil and baked for another 20 to get the top all bubbly. I served it with homemade guacamole. Finally, this said 8 servings.  Since this fills the pan to the absolute top, this 9x13 ends up being 12 servings in our house.  Next time I'll cut the recipe in half and bake it in an 8x8 pan.  We had so much leftover that we ended up using it as a filling for burritos the next night.  With the remaining (yes, I still had more leftovers), I made up more burritos, and froze them flat on a cookie sheet.  After they were solid, I just put them all in a freezer bag.  My son heats them in the microwave (just like store bought frozen burritos) at work.

Pretty yummy!  Did some tweaking.  Used leftover roasted chicken.  I prefer dark meat anyhow.   Cooked onions, red and green bell peppers, corn, and black beans with some chili powder and cumin.  Used a bit less cheese 1 cup each.  Served on tostadas, my son ate his with tortilla chips.  Served with chopped green onions, black olives and sour cream.  My son is picky and he gobbled this down.  Success!  Have printed recipe and will make this again.

I made this recipe last night for my parents and they loved it....I did make a couple adjustments though, I grilled the chicken with lemon pepper rather than boiling it, and I added an extra cup of salsa to the mix, and it was amazing!

This is much better if you add taco seasoning to the chicken and also use prepared Spanish rice. Continue with the layers as normal. My family tops with sour cream and crushed up nacho chips on the plate.

Very tasty.  Used brown rice, mango salsa with a bit of Sciracha for kick, a little Adobo seasoning, and a combo of cheddar and pepper jack cheese (a little more than half the recommended amount).  Will make again.

I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe. The  changes I made was that I cooked my chicken and onions in a little olive oil, then shredded it. I mixed the soups, salsa, and rice together. I used two small pans to have one to freeze for later. I layered it half rice, half cheese, chicken, half rice, then cheese. Made the night before then popped in the oven for an easy week night meal!

This was really good. I only made minor changes, so I believe my review is fair. I had to use two cans of cream of chicken (didn't have mushroom on hand), I used brown rice that I had on hand, and I added a can of black beans in withe the coked rice. I only made one layer of each because they weren't covering enough of the 9x13 baking dish. So I put the rice & beans on the bottom of the dish,  covered it with the soup/salsa  mixture, then put the cooked chicken over that, and covered the whole thing with the cheeses. It turned out great, and the thick layer of cheese on top was fantastic! YUM!

I made this recipe last night and it came out amazing! I added black beans and a couple of other seasonings including a half of cap full of smoke to the soup and salsa mixture to give it more of a smokey southwestern taste.I also cut done on the salsa, I used a little bit over a cup because i didnt want it to be to saucy. Everyone had first and seconds. There were hardly any left overs!

This recipe is absolutely delicious! I made this last night and can't wait for leftovers tonight. For those who thought it was bland, maybe it's the salsa you used? I used Pace Chunky Salsa and the dish had tons of flavor. The only thing I would do differently, wait to make it when I have people over just to hear the compliments! Of course I would double it to make sure there are leftovers. Thanks so much Gweneth!

So yummy! I sauteed the onion, reduced the cheese to about 1 1/2 cups, and added cumin, diced chilis and black olive slices. Instead of cream of mushroom soup I used tomato soup. I did mix everything together instead of layering it, too. Lots of tweaks, I know... but it was so yummy. I may add black beans next time. Other than that, my family doesn't want me to change a thing... except maybe only use half an onion. It was very convenient & quick to throw the frozen chicken breasts in water and boil. I may try this in the crock pot next time. My daughter said I must make this very often.

Right away I knew my family would like this but need more spice.  I used 2 boxes of Rice a Roni, and cooked chicken in the crockpot with a can of rotelle.  I used extra hot chunky salsa.  My 4 kids and my husband said it was best thing I had cooked in a long time.  Great recipe, very versatile!

This was good, but you can definitely taste the plain white rice. Next time I will add some seasoning to the rice, and then mix the rice and salsa/sour cream together before cooking.

Great Casserole.  I also added some salt and pepper to the rice and cream topping, and I also seasoned the chicken with some chicken seasonings.

Was wonderful! I used 2 bags of boil-in-a-bag rice which I think equaled 2 cups uncooked. Other than that I made as written, and everyone loved it. It fed eight and there were leftovers, it makes a lot!

This was really good, the entire family liked it. It is a great way to use up left over chicken and left over rice.  I used brown rice (don't know how much I used just enough to cover the bottom of the pan about an inch deep)and my homemade salsa.  Top it all with a little sour cream when serving and yummmmmmy!!

I don't know what I'd do without this recipe.  My husband craves this weekly, and while it isn't my recipe, I serve it so proudly!  I've made this by the book, and it's excellent.  We prefer a little extra spice, so we use spanish rice, medium salsa, and add about a TBSP of red hot sauce to the soup mix (which isn't overpowering, just a little kick).  I also tend to use 3 chicken breasts instead of 2.  I agree with other posters about pre-cutting the chicken to cut down on prep time.  Thank you to the amazing creator!!!!!!!

My husband said this was the best thing I've ever made. I changed two things because it's what I had on hand. Instead of using white rice, I used a box of cilantro lime rice from Target. I also used fat free sour cream instead of cream of chicken soup.

This was amazing. My kids loved it. The only thing I did differently was cut the chicken breast into chunks beforehand, and sautee with the onion, and a clove of garlic. I also sprinkled a TBSP of cumin on the chicken while sauteeing. I then layered the chicken/onion mixture with the rest of the ingredients. I used 2 boil in a bag rice packets, which shave off another 10 minutes.

This recipe is really good but I would recommend as other suggested using Spanish rice. I think Spanish rice is a must. For flavor, I would recommend adding chili peppers (canned is fine) and jalapeno peppers. Also I would recommend adding something like refried beans for texture. Also makes a great dip, especially if you add cream cheese.

It was an alright recipe. My husband seemed to enjoy it, but I didn't care much for the flavor of the cream of chicken soup. If I make it again I'll probably take that part of the recipe out and try it then.

Yum! Just a few modifications to make it healthier and to add some zip- I cut the amount of chicken and cheese in half. I skipped the cream of mushroom and only used 1 can of healthy request cream of chicken. I chopped up a green pepper and a jalapeno and threw them in just before cooking. I sprinkled a little cayenne and paprika over the whole thing This added the bite I was missing. Great leftovers for work the next day too!

I thought it was OK, easy enough to make. Cooked the chicken in crockpot during day instead of boiling the chicken.  Kids didn't care for it, but husband and I liked it.

It was OK, needs to have some seasoning added.  Unfortunately, my family told me I need not make it again :(

This recipe was a nice concept.  I added my own variations to this recipe and it was tasty.  Needless to say, we all went back for seconds!

Much better flavor than the usual chicken and rice casserole. I think it's the salsa that makes it so great. I only used half the amount of cheese that was called for and that was plenty. I took this dish to a potluck and it disappeared fast. I thought it might be a little too spicy for the kiddos but they loved it too.

This was delicious! Very creamy - the only thing I would suggest is to add a bit of spiciness, either by using hot salsa or adding a jalapeno pepper.

This was delicious! I read many of the recommendations in the comments and modified it accordingly. I used Kirsten's recommendations for making the recipe healthier, and I browned the chicken and onions in a skillet along with fajita sauce. It gave the chicken a lot of extra flavor. I used instant brown rice to save time, and it worked fine. I also used medium salsa, because my fiance likes spicier foods. The results were simply superb! I will definitely make this again, but next time I think I will use less onions and add corn and pinto beans.

I LOVE the mix of flavors in this recipe.  I altered the proportions a bit to suit my taste i.e. less meat, kept the rice amount the same and only one can of soup and mixed with 1 cup of salsa.  And only 2 cups of cheese.  Made in an 11 X 7 pan.  Terrific!

Turned out great.  Read some comments, only changes I made is that I sauteed the chicken with cumin and chili powder, used brown rice instead of white, only did one layer and added a layer of chili's.   Very good and easy. Next time, I think I'll add some black beans too.

This simple recipe will please anyone with a craving for good old homemade fare. Perfect recipe as is, but if you're like me, I prefer to saute my onion first. If your kids are picky, then give this one a try. You might also want to try a King Ranch casserole if you like this one.

Just our flavor but didn't get a whole lot of flavor out of this recipe. I added a layor of corn and I am glad I did just for some texture. Not a favorite.

My whole family loved this. I did have to make a couple changes....I used quick cooking brown rice because I was out of white and I used cream of celery soup instead of cream of chicken. I was out of that too. Id di add a touch more salsa. But otherwise followed the rest f the directions. My 2 year old and 5 year old devoured it. I usually dont like left pvers but I have eaten it a couples time now and finished the rest for breakfast today!!

I thought this was just ok. It wasn't spicy enough and didn't really have any flavor. If I make this again, I will do some tweaking like adding more veggies and some hot sauce.

Very good recipe and very easy! Can make simple changes for your own taste. I didnt want it to make alot so I cut the recipe down. I didnt really measure the ingredients, I just didnt add as much. I only used one can of soup and mixed everything together instead of layering. Yummy:)

Perfect leftover casserole. My little girl has loved this since she first tried it at 10 months! I use one whole chicken to last me 3 days, and this is usually day three (or chicken tacos). It's perfect to send to work with my husband, or if my little one is going to the sitters.  I take all the chicken remains (dark and white - I hate dark meat so it's always left), rice made the day before for supper, Tex Mex shredded cheese for an extra zing, and only one can of soup. I add more spices to it also, and use medium salsa.  LOVE this recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly, next time I will only use 1/2 an onion and cook it with the rice so its soft. I will also top with sour cream and avacados. It was very tasty!

Great fast dinner.  My kids loved it.  I cut the cheese in half and added black beans.  I think I might add olives and corn next time just to make it a little different.   I also used medium salsa.

This recipe is so good!  My husband craves this stuff all the time!  Recipes sound gross, and when you're putting the cream of chicken and mushroom with the salsa and onions you think this will be disgusting but it turns out to be soooo yummy!

wonderful dish! I used brown rice instead of white. Recipe calls for everything that most people keep on hand so its very convenient.  Tastes great and I served it as a dip for tortilla chips. Definately making this again!

I really enjoyed this dish. It is a great weeknight meal. I would imagine you could make ahead as well, since everything is cooked. As I was making it, I expected it to be quite bland but it ended up being very good! Very cheap, easy meal. I cut the recipe in half for 2 people, and it was still too much food. We have a lot of leftovers which I will actually consider eating (and I hate leftovers!)

This was great!  The only thing I will do differently next time is reduce the amount of onion to 1/2 of an onion.  A whole onion was WAY too much.  All in all.. great, easy recipe!

GREAT!  I drained a can of corn and added it to the soup mixture and instead of mild salsa I used 2 cups of medium.  I thought there was plenty of rice and it didn't seem to mushy to me as a few reviews mentioned.  My 9x13 dish was completely full.  We also dipped it with some tostitos.  If you want to get really fun add some lettuce and sour cream to the finished product too.  Great meal and this will be a recipe keeper.

The whole family enjoyed this dish.  I mixed the cheese in with the soups and just used a little less tan called for and then sprinkled the extra on top.  It's not the most beautiful casserole (it looks like mush:)) but it tasted good.

Tasty!! To make it easier and save from cleaning some bowls, I may just mix everything together and put into the pan. I saw no real need to layer other than for presentation sake. Also next time I may add a can of green chilis or a jalepeno for some extra zing

I made this dish not expecting much on such a short planning, since the pantry was running low.  I was very pleased as this was filling even when served with one small side and my kids even ate this with tostito chips and topped with sour cream.  We doubled the recipe to feed the whole family of 8 (with four being bottomless stomach teens). I expected to possibly have leftovers but this was the perfect amount.  I plan to make this one again, and again. One of the kids asked if we could add corn the next time, and  which we tried, it turned out even better!!

This is one of the best recipes I've found on All Recipes.  Next time we plan on replacing the cream of chicken soup with cream of tomato, and adding refried or black beans. Overall, it is absolutely delicious!

This was yummy. I made a few adjustments. I added a can of black beans and a can of corn (both drained) to the soup mixture and I used brown rice instead of white rice. It was really good. I will definitely make this again.

This casserole (even though I used HOT salsa instead of MILD) was just sort of bland to me. It was very cheesy, but didn't have much flavor other than the cheesiness.

love this, comfort food! I make mine with cream of celery instead of the cream of mushroom, however. I also make mine with medium salsa, as we like our food on the spicy side :)

Excellent. Very cheesy and filling. The cheese and rice make for a very nice texture. I grilled the chicken instead of boiling it, and I served it with chili sauce to give it a bit more spice.

Made as written except I had to substitute some of the cheese since I didn't have enough Monterey Jack.  I also added some broccoli and mushrooms that I sauteed up with some S&P and garlic.  The chicken I cooked up with some cajun seasoning to add a little kick (used ground chicken).  Next time I'll cut the cheese in half.  I'm a firm believer that you can never have enough cheese.  But my oh my this was a lot of cheese.  I think next time I'll also mix it all together in a bowl before putting into the casserole dish then top with the cheese.

Very good!  Will definitely make again.  Made as written, but I was not a fan of the crisp cheese crust on top, so next time I will leave the top layer of cheese off until the last 15 minutes of baking to make it gooey instead of crispy.

This was quite good. I melted 8 oz of cheese food product with the salsa to make salsa con queso so my roommates would eat the salsa. Leftovers go so deliciously on tortillas the next day to create cheesey rice burritos!

Very good.  I made adjustments to my liking.  I put in 16 oz. of pace mild salsa instead of 1 1/2 Cup, half the amount of cheese, 2 onions chopped, and one packet of taco seasoning, sauteed with the chicken.  Also, I used brown rice instead of white.  Will make again but will just use a 1/2 can of each cream soup.

Pretty good, made for good leftovers as well. Used brown rice instead of white, used a 2nd can of cream of chicken soup instead of the cream of mushroom because I don't like mushrooms. I'm not crazy about overly crunchy onions, so next time I will either cook the onions first to soften them up or just omit them completely as there are onions in the salsa anyway. But this is definitely a keeper.

Awesome! The only thing I changed is that I cut the chicken into small pieces, then sauteed it with garlic and bell peppers.  I turned out great!

This is a great recipe! It's a sure crowd pleaser. I don't like mushrooms or onions, so I adapted the recipe a little bit by using an extra can of cream of chicken instead of the cream of mushroom, and I just left the onion out altogether. You should also use about 3 cups of water to make sure the rice cooks through. It also takes a little longer than 20 min to prep -- closer to 40 minutes, since you have to dice the chicken after it cooks. But definitely worth the extra effort!

Good flavor. I used what I had in the house to eliminate going to the store.  Cut the recipe in half & used 1 1/2 qt. casserole dish.  Used fresh salsa, 2 chicken breasts, co-jack cheese.  The next time I make it I will use shredded pepper jack cheese, add a can of drained pinto beans and a small can of diced chili peppers.  This was good but we like a little more "zip".

Absolutely delicious! I made it exactly as the recipe stated, but I did add a can of black beans. What a hit in our house--- will definitely become a regular menu item!

This was a cinch to make and was very tasty. I lessened the cheese by half, and my husband and I dished the casserole into whole wheat tortillas. It was delicious by itself but even better with the chewy texture of the tortilla shell. Plus, we threw in some sour cream and homemade guacamole - yum!

I made my own version because I have a smaller family. But I used Rotel with Lime and cilantro. (I'll be using fresh cilantro next time) I only used one can of cream of chicken soup. which I mixed with the can of Rotel. I also threw the chicken into this same mix. I layered rice, chicken rotel mix and then cheese and repeat. My family loved it.

Followed the advice of others and used a medium salsa, cooked chicken with onion and fresh garlic, and made rice with chicken broth instead of water. Turned out great, this is a no frills family dinner, nothing fancy but definitely tasty and filling, that is why I gave it 5 stars. Next time I will make more rice, like a cup and 1/2, there was enough “sauce” for more rice.

This is a really good recipe that my family raved about.  I did replace some of the regular Jack Cheese for Pepper Jack Cheese and added some roasted garlic to the middle layer to give it a bit more of a kick.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

My family thought this recipe was great for a cold winter night.  I utilized some left-over rotisserie chicken from the grocery store.  The other change that I made was that I used homemade salsa which was pretty spicy. Today I am making it again to take to a covered dish meal at the church tomorrow.  It is diffinitely a keeper for me.

This was yummy! I made it for my boyfriend and his mom who both loved it and went back for seconds.  Before cooking the chicken, my boyfriend rubbed it down with a Cajun spice mix and brushed it was a Mexican hot sauce.  This added a little extra zip, but not so much that it was over powering.  I also used brown rice in place of the white, giving it a little extra nutritional value. All and all, this was really easy and very good.  I will be making it again!

This casserole was sooo good. I was actually excited for leftovers the next day. I didn't have any cream of chicken soup or salsa on hand so I substituted 1 can of chicken with rice soup and 1 can of diced tomatoes with green chiles. I thought cream of mushroom was going to taste weird in this but it really ended up tasting really great!

Okay, I modified this a lot to reduce fat. I rubbed the chicken breast with olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic powder and basil and then baked for 1 hour at 350. I also used brown rice and added 1 tsp of chicken boullion in the water while it was simmering. For the sauce, I used a can of 95% fat free cream of celery soup and 1 cup of boiling water with 1 tsp of chicken bouillon, chopped onion and 1 1/2 cup of green salsa since I was out of red salsa. I mixed the rice, sauce, chicken and 2 cups of 2% mild cheddar cheese together and baked.  It was very good. Try it with crushed tortilla chips for a different taste.

This was really pretty tasty.  I did not boil my chicken.  I cut it into bite sized pieces and sautéed it with some fajita seasonings.  I also cooked the onion with the chicken.  We will definitely make this again.  Maybe next time we will add a can of mexicorn or drained black beans to the rice mixture.

mmmm this was good! I'm not big on cream of mushroom soup but wanted to follow the recipe. I tried a bit of the soup mixture before putting the casserole together and wasn't impressed. However during baking the flavors all came together beautifully and this turned out to be way more delicious than I had thought! My husband LOVED it. Will definitely make again, and it was easy. Thank you!

For how simple this dish is, it's pretty tasty.  Good comfort food.  I only put the cheese on top, and probably only used 1-2 cups to save some calories.  Also added some chili powder the 3rd time making this...it makes a lot but it's great for leftovers.  Yum!

This was great, however I did make a few changes.    I omitted the cream of mushroom soup.  Instead of salsa I used 2 cans of mild Rotel. One can I used all juices. The second can I drained most of the juices.  Instead of using a chopped onion, I added Tastefully Simple's Onion Onion while the rice was cooking.  Instead of boiling the chicken I pan fried it in a little bit of italian dressing. On one side of the chicken I put Tastefully Simple Seasoned Salt. On the other side of the chicken I used Tastefully Simple Fiesta Party Mix.  I made this for a potluck and it was all gone. :)

This was delicious.  I have to say I didn't make it according to the original post, but wow, my whole family just inhaled it.  I took the rice down to 1 cup and took the water down to 2 1/4.  I opted to cook this on the stove top. I added garlic and pepper.  I cut the chicken into chunks and sauted this in a tiny bit of olive oil with 1/4 tsp. cumin until it was almost brown and then added  1/2 chopped green pepper, 1/2 red pepper, 1/2 onion and 1/2 fresh mushroom.  I kept the original cheeses and the original amounts. I added the cream of mushroom and omitted the cream of chicken.  I just threw everything together in the 9 x 13 in dish and just stirred it all together.  I baked for 20 min at 350 degrees.  My kids even went nuts!! Thanks for sharing!! This would be great with almost any veggie combo. I'll be putting broccoli in next time and my children have requested this with peas!!

I used this recipe tonight and it turned out good. I made a few changes based on a review by Minniedoo. I used a Dirty rice mix instead of white rice and omitted the mushroom soup. I browned the chicken and onions and then put the soup and salsa in the pan and cooked it together. I also used shredded cheeses that I already had in the fridge. I layered mine a little differently and it was still good.

5 stars with my changes.  Sauteed the onion in a little olive oil with some ground cumin.  Replaced all the cheese with pepper jack.  Not to bland, not too spicy.  Used cream of celery soup, 'cause I had it.  Even better the next day.

Everyone (except picky daughter who hates rice) loved it.  Needs a bit more spice. I used brown rice, 2 cans healthy request cream of chicken soup and only cheddar cheese. These substitutions might have added to it being bland. Perhaps spicier salsa (or more) next time. I will definitely make it again.

It was pretty good.  The onion was a bit much.  It didn't cook while in the oven so you bite into chunks of raw onion.  I like my food spicy, so next time I will use half medium and half spicy salsa.  Great week night recipe, it's quick and plenty of left overs to take to work.

It needs a little more spice; maybe a little less soup and more salsa (i used medium salsa and it still needed a little more kick).

This was super tasty! It instantly became one of my favorites and my husband liked it too. The leftovers are delicious, and when they were all gone I was sad because I wanted more!

I really enjoyed this recipe! I'm not a rice fan so  I used corn tortillas instead and added black beans and corn to the layers. AWESOME! I absolutely LOVED the sauce...great creamy spicy flavor!

I made a couple of changes to this recipe. First I cut up the chicken and sauteed it with the onion, a green bell pepper, some fresh garlic and seasoned it with  black pepper and chili powder. Added some extra rice, and only made one layer. It came out amazing, even my picky eaters loved it!! I will definitely be making this dish again!

I made quite a few changes, based on other reviews and what I had on hand, and probably shouldn't be reviewing so bear with me.   Changes: Used 2 chicken breasts, 1 cup rice, about 1.5-2 cups cheddar / mozzarella cheese, 1/2 onion and 1/2 cup salsa. Added a roma tomato to make up for the salsa, small chipotle pepper, 1/2 tsp cumin and a handful of spinach.   We sauteed the onion and cubed chicken in the same pan afterwards. Layered the dish as written and was pretty good, but I had to add some seasonings as mentioned above. I think some black beans and canned corn would work fabulously! It's a very forgiving recipe, have fun with it!

UPDATE: MADE THIS AGAIN, FOLLOWING GWENETH'S COOKING DIRECTIONS TO THE LETTER THIS TIME (I.E. THE LAYERING STEPS). MADE THE SAME MODS AS LAST TIME, BUT USED FIESTA CORN INSTEAD, ADDED A PACKET OF CHICKEN TACO SEASONING TO MY MEAT AND SAUTED MY ONION TO SOFTEN IT. I ALSO USED LONG GRAIN RICE AND COOKED IT IN BROTH TO ADD FLAVOR. BAKED UNCOVERED THE ENTIRE TIME. YUM! This was "OK". It's a shame that my fiance and I didn't like this enough to eat any of the leftovers because this makes a TON!!! This recipe is pretty forgiving. Add anything you want - beans, veggies, etc. I pretty much followed Gweneth's directions but did make a few substitutions. I added a 15 oz. can of (drained) sweet corn and subbed a can of cream of chicken with herbs soup for the cream of mushroom called for. I also revised the amount and types of cheese I used based on what I had in my fridge. To speed prep, I shredded a Mexican-seasoned rotisserie chicken. My only other changes were to use Minute Rice and to follow the cooking instructions printed on the back of the box (i.e. equal parts rice / water). I mixed everything together (as opposed to layering as directed) in my baking dish, reserving HALF of my cheese for topping my casserole. Baking for 25 minutes covered / 15 uncovered worked well for me. Topping individual servings with pickled jalapeno slices and using Tostito's scoops for dipping was a nice touch. All in all, this was decent, but nothing I'm anxious to repeat. Thanks anyways, Gweneth. :-)

This is EASY and delicious!  A hit with my boyfriend, he even had thirds!  Like i mentioned, it was really easy to make and I had all the ingredients on hand.  This would be great for a family because it makes a lot and it pleases picky eaters (in my experience).  Here are some suggestions: Saute the onions first, add some chili pepper to the soup/salsa mix, poach the chicken in low sodium chicken broth.  I think it would be GREAT to add some tortillas and reduce the rice.  I will try making it like this next time.  GOOD STUFF! Five stars!

I have made this twice now and my family loves it.  The first time I made it according to the recipe.  The second time I did alter it slightly with even better results.  I was pressed for time so I needed to combine a couple steps.  First, I used 2 cups minute rice (uncooked) and mixed it with the soup/salsa mixture (I added about 1/2 can of water to thin down the soups a little).  I chopped green onions to use instead of regular onion but I did not mix that with the soups.  I layered half the soup/rice mixture, chicken, gr. onion, then cheese, and repeated.  I baked this at 300 degrees F for about 2 hour.  We liked it better this way, the rice seemed to absorb the flavors more.  Thank you for posting this recipe.  I will definately be making this again.

This was a perfect and easy recipe.  My family loved it.  I did use a Mexican cheese  with jalapenos in it in place of the Monterey Jack to give it a kick.

Great timesaving recipe.  I made a few changes to make it work for my husband and me though.  I used brown rice and served the casserole over the rice.  Also, I made black beans to serve on the side.  First layered a can of corn, can of diced tomatoes with chiles on the bottom of the pan.  Second I added the cubed chicken mixed with cilantro and sliced mushrooms and green onions.  Finally I added a layer of cream soup mixed with sour cream and salsa on top and mixed it slightly with the veggies and chicken. Topped with cheese and baked until hot and bubbly.

I usually love the recipes I get from allrecipes but I even hate to say it but my kids 11 and 15 did not even like it. One thing that I did was use canned chicken, I got home and did not have any in the freezer and did not want to get out again. That could have been the problem. It just seemed like a gloppy mess.

I altered the recipe by using brown rice and making my own white sauce rather than using condensed soup. It was a hit with my family! Would be great topped with sour cream and shredded lettuce.

This recipe is so easy. The only changes I made were, I used sour cream instead of cream of mushroom soup. Added a can of organic black beans. (should have used 2) and used all cheddar cheese. It was what I had on hand. And used yellow spanish rice instead of white. It was yummy.  This is a great base recipe. Oh and I added some cumin for more spice. I also used medium spice salsa. Our family likes it spicy.  Forgot to add, I also cubed the raw chicken and sauteed it with the onion. Omitted the water since I pre-cooked the yellow rice.

I was definately not impressed with this recipe- I give it a 3 star because it filled us up and my fiance said he liked it okay. I thought the chicken had NO flavour, infact, the entire meal didn't have much flavour- i had only added about a quarter of an onion and still it was too much. I think it just tasted REALLY processed- if I wanted a processed meal I would have purchased a frozen meal.  Thanks for the suggestion- however I wont be making it again.

Because i didn't have everything on the ingredients list i had to make some changes and i have to say It Turned Out Great!! I only had cheddar cheese and i'm sure i didn't have a total of 4 cups...more like 2 cups. I also substituted sour cream for the mushroom soup. In fact i'm not sure i would have liked it with mushroom soup. I took the advice of another reviewer and sauted my onion with my cubed chicken rather than boiling the chicken. I also had fresh cilantro, i chopped that up and served it as a garnish on top. that was a nice addition. Will be adding this recipe to my regulars :)

this was delicious! here's what i changed: i made it vegetarian and used 4 quorn brand chick'n cutlets. i added no water, and i sauteed the onion with some garlic before adding it to the mixture (i don't care for raw onions). i nixed the chicken soup and cream of mushroom in favor of medium spicy salsa and sour cream, and i was very liberal with the cheese, hehe.  put everything together in a big glass dish and popped it in the oven.  this recipe takes about 20 minutes (prep time + cook time) when you use faux chick'n.

This is not fantastic but its easy, fast, & filling. Here are the changes I made...I added 1/2 cup of sour cream, used cheddar cheese soup, only added 1 cup of salsa, & used only 1 & 3/4 cups of monterey blend shredded cheese.

The base is good, but some tweaks here and there would make it much better. I would saute the onions before adding to the casserole; also, a touch of some sort of spice like cumin can go a long way in a dish like this. I sprinkled some tortilla chips on top for a nice crunch.

This is requested in my house often.  I have made it many times.  The only thing I changed is not using 1 whole onion.  The salsa we use has onion in it, so adding another onion made it too much for our taste.  Other than that we love it! As I said we make it often.  Thanks!

Two things!  First I cooked the rice with  Wyler’s chicken granules added to the water. Second…I never would fix the chicken that way.  It is so much quicker to cut the chicken into chunks first and then parboil it.  (However I did not even do that, I cooked it in with the onions and other things :) while they were sautéing!) Very good, and I must also add very “adaptable”!

Delicious!  I bought a rotisserie chicken, added a can of green chilis and used a mexican blend shredded cheese mix.  Kids liked it so I will make again.  The rice is a nice change from the recipes that use tortillas.

Thanks for this recipe, Gweneth.  I sauteed the onion, along with a couple of stalks of celery and a green pepper.  I also added some frozen corn.  Loved it!  Next time I make it, I'll throw in a can of black beans, too.

This was great. I followed a few suggestions from reviewers. The addition of black beans was terrific. I would use less onion next time but I would still add raw onion to the dish (rather than browning it) so the finished product tastes very fresh with that crisp onion flavor. I also browned diced chicken in olive oil with garlic, rather than boiling. I included crushed tortilla chips over top when serving and that really added a punch. Very filling and overall a hit!

Delicious! I made no changes except the way I prepared it (simmered chicken and onions in skillet with salsa to cook). I'm not a huge casserole fan, but this was DELICIOUS!

Used homemade salsa and it was delicious!  I cut the dishes by cooking the onions and chicken together and then mixed all the ingredients together in the 9x13 dish

Very tasty recipe, even though not the healthiest! I added a little of Cholula's hot sauce to give it a little kick since we like spice in this house. Also, served it with a dollop of sour cream to balance the flavors. Was told by my boys that they would eat it every week!

This was surprisingly good. I did not have high hopes, but the whole family (even the very picky 5 year old) really liked it. I followed a previous reviewer's suggestion and cooked the chicken and onions in the soup mixture. I did not have cream of chicken soup, so I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup. I added in frozen corn in the layers to get some vegetables in it. I put the casserole together in the afternoon and baked it for 2 hours at 300 (covered; Pampered Chef covered baker) as we were all out at a ringette practice from 4:30 to 6:30 pm, prime dinner prep time. It worked really well so this will be a great dinner for evenings when time is short or we need a meal that can cook unattended.

Took this to a little fiesta for "fight night."  EVERYONE raved.  It wasn't as spicy as I would have preferred.  I think I'll use a spicier salsa for a little more heat next time.  Creamy, delicious and VERY easy to make.  I will definitely keep this on in my recipe box.

Hubby is not a casserole type guy, but he actually liked it! He even remarked about how good it was (again) when we had it for left overs two days later! I liked it because it was quick and easy. I took others suggestions and just threw everything together before putting remaining cheese on top. Covered and placed in oven. Removed cover last 10 min. Wonderful. Thanks!

I just made this recipe last night, and my family loved it. I found the recipe to be very simple, and I actually did have most of the ingrediants in my pantry. I also used rotel vs the salsa, and salted and peppered each layer.

My family absolutely loved this dish.  I didn't have cream of chicken, so I substituted a can of cream of celery, and added a little chicken soup base just to add the chicken flavor.  I also pretty much doubled the cheese, but it was a huge hit with the kids!

Pretty good, according to my daughter. I didn't use all of the rice, as it seemed to be too much, nor did I use all of the cheese - 4 cups of cheese means 1/2 a cup per serving. Even with the reduced amount of cheese, the top of the casserole looked greasy.

Loved the flavors of this dish but I found it pretty watery. I made my own cream of chicken & mushroom soups (I have celiac so I need a gluten-free option). Try to go for a good quality salsa to avoid the watery bottom (or just a slotted spoon!). Either way--YUM!

I thought this casserole was average.  I did follow some of the suggestions made by others and made a few changes that i think improved it.  Rather then boil the chicken i sauted it with some salsa and the onions and sprinkled it with some taco seasoning.  I only used 1 can of cream of chicken soup and added a little extra salsa to the soup mixture.   I dont think this is something that i would make again soon...it was okay, but is not worthy of 5 stars.

this was really easy. i did however do it a little different and it turned out great.  i eliminated the cream of mushroom soup and only used 1 can of cream of chicken soup.  i melted the cheese in the cream of chicken soup, then combined 2 cans rotel, 1 can southwest corn, onions, fresh garlic, and the rice.  i then topped it with cheese and baked like that.  my family loved it!  it's definately an easy dish and a big hit.

This was delicious. Super easy and simple to make.  I cooked the chicken with chicken fajita seasoning and put the casserole together on the weekend.  Then one evening during the next week I popped it in the oven for about 45 min. and it was ready to go.  I also used my own homemade salsa recipe as I don't like store boughts, so they sure helped the flavor as well.  Will definitely make again and again.  Thanks!

This was really good.  We made a few changes: we used brown rice instead of white, only 3 chicken breasts, and about a cup or two less cheese than called for.  We also used healthy request (lowfat/reduced sodium) soups and sauteed our onion before adding to casserole.  We also added a little taco seasoning.  It came out really good.

Very easy and tasty!  My husband and I really enjoyed it.. our three toddlers did not, but they are picky and don't like dishes where everything is mixed together.  Good with sour cream--will add tortilla chips on side next time too.  Very good, thank you!

This recipe is so simple and yet so great! I have made this for quite a few people and always get compliments. Its great for kids and picky eaters, too! I only added a few more spices such as chili powder and paprika for some color. Also added some salt in the water for boiling the chicken. Other than that, It was perfect!!!

I liked this, but my husband did not. I added some black beans and corn to balance it out a bit. Other than that, I followed the recipe. I thought there was too much rice overall for the chicken and sauce ratio. I won't be making this one again, thanks for the submission though.

LOVED this recipe! So easy and tasty!! The only thing I did different was I sauteed the onions before adding them to the soup mixture and I diced the chicken and sauteed as well with a little bit of seasoning (cumin & garlic powder). It was so yummy!!

This was very easy to make, especially with roasted chicken and frozen bagged rice. It was very flavorful and can feed a crowd. I am going to try to put it in 2 pans and freeze one.

This was a pretty good easy dinner option, plus I was able to make it with what I already had in the house. To make it a little healthier, I halved the amount of cheese, used brown rice and skipped the cream of chicken soup. Turned out great and leftovers are easy to reheat.

Nothing too exciting to report on this one.  I've made it on two different occasions, and each time I've made a mental note that I shouldn't make it again.  The dish and its colors are pretty unappealing on the plate, and the flavors aren't bad, they just aren't really particularly good.  I think if you found the right combination of ingredients to add to jazz it up, it would could definitely be improved, but I like to base my reviews on recipes as written, and this one is middle of the road.

This recipe turned out good tasting, but it was too soupy for me.  I know I will make it again, but I will put more chicken in it.  Thanks for showing this recipe to me.

Really good.  I sauteed the onions before in a little olive so the onions wouldn't be crunchy.  I also bought medium salsa, scared it would be too spicy I used some tomato juice in place of some of the salsa.  Definitely will cook again!

This was great!  Didn't change a thing.  I can see it being very good for variations, particularly in the soup.  I followed another reviewer's suggestions and cooked the onion, chicken, soups and salsa together to save on washing up!  Thanks. UPDATE:  I tried this in the slow cooker last night and it turned out great!  Follow the recipe but reserve some of the chicken mixture for the top then sprinkle with the cheese.  Set slow cooker to LOW and cook for about 7 hours.  Perfect!

This is a really great recipe! I only used half the chicken (leftover grilled) and it was great. My two-year-old liked it as well. I served it with a spinach salad and steamed carrots- certainly a winner!

I cooked jasmine rice in chicken broth, grilled my chicken and some mushrooms (using taco seasoning on the chicken). I only ended up using 1.5 chicken breasts for the whole meal - that was plenty!  I added sauteed onion/garlic/cumin to the soup mixture and added fresh cilantro.  I chopped up my grilled mushrooms to add.  SO DELICIOUS!

This was soooooo good the first night and as leftovers!  I followed the advice of others and 1) halved the recipe for just my BF and I 2) sauteed onions 3) used a whole can of drained Rotel 4) added a can of rinsed, drained black beans.  I also mixed everything together and then put it in the oven.  You should def try this!!

I thought it tasted really good.  I used chips to scoop of the casserole.  I used two cans of cream of chicken and half of the cheese.  I also used brown rice cooked in chicken broth.  YUMMY!!

Really yummy!  I made it exactly according to the instructions, and it turned out great.  While it was a little heavy on the rice, we're a rice-loving family so it suited us just fine.  Not the ideal meal if you're on a weight loss diet, though... which I am so that kind of sucked.  But the taste and ease of preparation are superb!

So easy and quick. I reduced cooking time by precooking rice. Added milk and sour cream and reduced cheese.

Very tasty and everyone ate seconds. As others suggested, I halved the cheese & used reduced fat soups.  Next time I will just use 1/2 onion. I agree, would be a great potluck dish. Will make again, thanks for sharing.

This recipe was SO good.  Be really careful when choosing salsa because the heat on the one I chose was a bit much for my kids, but overall WE LOVED this one.  I will for sure be making this again.

It wasn't stellar but it was ok.  I didn't put as much cheese in and I used a medium salsa to give it a little kick.  I may tweak this if I want to make it in the future.

This was excellent.  A lot better than I thought.  The only thinkg I will do next time is DE-crease the amount of cheese to about 3/4.  This had SO much cheese and I am a cheese lover, but it was a bit too much.  Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing!

It was really good.  I didn't even put onions in it because I don't like them, and I used all MOnterey Jack cheese because that's all I had on hand.  Very tasty!  Next time I may add some sour cream to the soup mixture.  Otherwise it was very yummy.  I bet you could use a can of Rotel tomatoes/green chiles in place of the salsa and it would be really good.

Just ok, if I make it again I will add something to it, although I am not sure what.  My Husband felt the same way but my Mom had the left overs and loved them.  She even called me to say that she was eating it again the third day.

Yes, this is very good. I used the chicken breast of a rotisary chicken from Superwalmart, just shredded it a bit and I think that added a bunch more flavor. I also used Newmans Own black bean and corn salsa...put it in the food processor to smooth it out a bit and it turned out fantastic! Husband loved it! Super easy and yummy!

This is an amazing dish, simple to make and tastes great. My DH does not like rice and loved this dish. I only added one can of the soup, found a mix of chicken and mushroom at the store and added more salsa for more flavor. Very good, will make this again and again ...

I'm into easy, now that I cook for just me - so I made some changes, but still wound up with a yummy dinner for several nites!  To halve the recipe I did the following:  I sauteed a cicken breast and a turkey cutlet (all I had in the freezer) cut into bite size pieces while they were still partially frozen. Then, in the same pan, I sauteed 1/4 cup of green pepper, diced, 1/2 cup of diced onion and a tablespoon of minced garlic.  While I was doing this, I cooked, as per directions on the box, 1 packet of whole grain and wild rice. In a bowl, I mixed 1 can of cream of chicken soup, nearly 3/4 cup of medium salsa, the onion mixture, the rice and the chicken and turkey, and poured it into a casserole dish.  Then I mixed a cup of shredded mozzarella and 1 cup of shredded cheddar (again, all I had in the fridge) and sprinkled the cheese on top of the chicken and soup mix.  Cooked it covered for 30 minutes, then uncovered until the cheese was slightly brown.  SOOOOOOO good! Will do this often, and probably still using both the chicken and the turkey. It went together quickly, and , served with cornbread and some green beans, I couldn't have asked for anything better.

I thought it was ok...my husband really liked it. After making it, I thought that it might make a good burrito filling, as one reviewer mentioned.I did modify the recipe a bit by using chicken broth to cook the rice in to add more flavor, and while boiling the chicken, I added a little salt, basil, bay leaf, and peppercorns to flavor the water.I didn't have a can of cream of chicken so I used sour cream as a substitute...maybe this is why it turned out a little too "mushy" for my taste. But, it was good. I also used a sweet Maui onion instead of just a normal onion for a milder taste.

This dish was FANTASTIC! It was full of flavor and very satisfying. Instead of using chicken breasts, I used drained, canned chicken, which worked well. We can't wait to have this one again!

This was quite delicious, thought I cut up and browned the chicken in skillet. I don't care for boiled meat. Used Basmati rice. and of course Pace Hot for the salsa. This turned out quite yummy.

Quite tasty. Good to try. I thought there would be too much sauce but it held together well on the plate. Nice texture. I did not have mild salsa so used hot, I think I would also try adding some veg next time, like corn or kidney beans, perhaps even green beans.

Awesome! Great meal to fix on a cold night! My family loved it- it tastes almost like chicken enchiladas only with rice instead of tortillas. Jeni P. LaPorte, In

I made this and like many of you, I made a few changes. Its a great recipe to change around or add to etc. I added corn and sauteed my onions with the chicken and some garlic. Added a little chilli powder too. I layered it differently than the directions stated, I had the rice with the soup mixture on the bottom and mixed the salsa in with the chicken and corn, and put that on top. I topped it off with cheese, and I only used about half of what it called for, which was plenty. Anyways, it was great idea, even though I didnt follow the directions, it turned out fantastic!

Wow! This was so good! I followed the recipe exactly, but since I only had hot salsa, I only used 3/4 cup salsa, and 3/4 cup canned diced tomatoes to cut the heat a bit for my little ones. It paid off as most of them came back begging for seconds and thirds! I also made a second casserole for my friend that just had baby, and she called me the next day to make sure I get a copy of this recipe over to her today, it was a major hit at her house too. Love how simple this is, such a tasty homestyle meal, and on the table in no time ready to eat. Thank you!

An excellent dish. I followed a suggestion to use Rotel instead of the salsa and it was great! I used 2 cans of mild rotel (use hot for a more spicy result) and used only about 1 1/2 cups of water instead of 2 2/3 cups water.

Needed veggies. It tasted much better with the edition of diced, sauteed yellow squash or black olives.

I thought this recipe was wonderful. I used left over baked chicken season with garlic salt and pepper. I also used a Mexican blend of cheeses. In my opinion the cheeses could be cut in half. Four cups of cheese is a lot unless you really love cheese.

Slightly bland. Use a good hot salsa, not Pace. Also I halved the cheese and used a mexican blend and that was good enough. For ease use a rotisseri chicken.

This recipe was quick and easy to make. My first bite I thought the salsa was a little overpowering, but than I couldn't stop eating it! My husband and kids (3 yr old and 1.5 yr old) all loved it which automatically puts it on my 'make-again' list! Thanks!

Very good! I only used 2 cups of cheese and it was plenty cheesy/gooey. 4 cups is an insane amount of cheese!  Great topped with a little hot sauce and sour cream. Will make again.

Aside from separating the rice from the rest of the ingredients, followed the recipe exactly. Served the sauce on top of rice instead of as part of the casserole. This turned out to rich for my taste and both my husband and I couldn't finish it. I don't think I would be making this again, sorry.

Everyone who tried this really loved the recipe.  In order to keep the rice from getting too soft, undercook it slightly, then it will finish cooking while baking.  It is very good and very cheesy!

I thought this recipe was very easy to make. My husband and daughter loved it. I made the recipe exactly besides adding corn which was yummy. I also think that using the left overs as filling inside a burrito with a little sour cream would be great. I would definetely make this recipe again.

I decided to use this as a side dish to our chicken breasts that we grill. I put some olive oil in a pan and added chopped onion, chopped up peppers, garlic and one can of diced tomatoes with green chilis. I used garlic powder, salt and pepper for seasoning. I added the salsa mixture to my microwaved rice(directions on box)in the bowl that it was cooked in. Then I put just one can of cream of chicken soup and the cheese in the pan I had already been using and cooked till bubbly then added that to the salsa rice. It had some heat, but was so good, and the total cook time was under 30min because we grill our chicken on the side.

I hate when everyone gives a recipe great reviews and I don't like it. But I cannot tell a lie - this tasted like bland, mushy, cafeteria food to me. :-( My boyfriend liked it - but he's not very picky. I guess I am!! The recipe needs so much tweaking to make it good for me that it's not worth messing with. :-(

This was very tasty - if I ever have chicken or rice left over from something else, I will definitely make this.  I omitted the onion (had bad experiences baking raw onion in a casserole) and used medium salsa.  Mixed everything but the cheeses, which i sprinkled on top.

Changed alot in this recipe, but the base of it was excellent. Used beef instead of chicken, and I also used spanish vermicelli rice mix with about a 1/2 can of diced tomato added to that while simmering. Cooked the beef with garlic salt and some black pepper. When the beef was done cooking I mixed in some velveeta and melted that to make a creamy, cheesy beef mixture. Used Mexican blend shredded cheese. It was great!!!

Wow!  If you prep, then it takes no time.  To give my chicken more flavor, I boiled it in chicken broth. For the onions, I added some bell peppers and green chilli then sauteed them together.  I did use spanish rice and hot salsa. Very simple, creamy, and tasteful. Enjoy!

It was good but next time I make this I will be making changes. This is a great base recipe. Next time I will put a mexican flare on it and add taco seasoning and spanish rice instead of the regular rice. Also, I may substitute the chicken for ground beef, just a personal preference.

This is a fabulous recipe. I made a few changes. I diced my chicken and then browned it and added some taco seasoning to the pan. I also added the onions with the chicken and let them cook. I used two cans of cream of chicken soup. My kids and husband loved this dish.  I am sure the leftovers will taste even better for lunch tomorrow!

My shortcuts: I used chunky salsa and cut out the onion, I also used Uncle Ben's rice that you simply heat in the microwave for 90 seconds, and I just used Mexican cheese blend instead of buying two kinds of cheese. I cut the recipe in half since it was just feeding two of us. Overall, the dish was pretty good but we both agreed that the chicken needed some more "zing" - next time I will use Spanish rice and coat the chicken in taco seasoning.

Considering this simple recipe and how quickly you can prepare it, I have to give 5 star ! Not only when my picky husband asked for the second I knew this is the keeper but also it amazed me at my first bite ! It exceeded my expectation.

I really enjoyed this dish.  While obviously not the healthiest option, I still thought it was really good.  I modified it to make it a little less hearty I did not use any mushroom soup but instead added two tablespoons of low fat sour cream.  I also used low fat Cheddar cheese and medium salsa to give it a kick.  Overall, I really enjoyed this recipe and will definitely be making it again!

my family liked it, but how could anyone not think this is too salty?  4 cups of cheese, 2 cans of soup, and salsa made it pretty salty to cover the relatively small amount of rice.  I used just 2 cups of cheese and that was enough.  Easy recipe though.

My original review stated I wouldn't make this again, but I've made it over and over. It's easy comfort food. I dump whatever cheese and whatever soup I have. Often, I leave out the soup and it turns out fine.

This was tasty and flavorfull.  I used one can of cream of chicken and approx 1/2 cup of sour cream.  Probably only added 3 cups of cheese.  Put in some frozen corn and black beans as well.

My husband loved this meal - with a couple of adjustments...  I used 5 chicken breasts and used an entire 16oz HOT chunky salsa.  I served this with guacamole, extra salsa, and sour cream and noticed that, with most casseroles, the meal tasted much better the next day once the ingredients settled with one another.  I'm sure my husband will request this meal again!

I made this recipe with a few variations (listed below) and felt a little like I was eating the filling to something.  So I paired it with refried beans in a large tortilla and it makes a fantastic burrito filling!  Wrap and toast lightly on both sides for a delicious and filling meal.

Changes from the original recipe:
I used 1 pouch of boil in bag rice to save time
I used a heaping tablespoon of light sour cream instead of cream of mushroom soup
I added 1/2 tsp cumin and 1 tsp chili powder for a little extra flavor

This was fantastic!  I had my father who is not a big fan of mexican food over for dinner and he loved it!  Between him, my husband and I there weren't many leftovers but they were great the next day!  This is definitely getting added to my regular meal rotation!

Wonderful dish!  A few changes per other reviewers: 1/2 cup sour cream instead of the cream of chicken, I added diced chilies on top as well as cumin.  Also sauteed onions with the chicken, and just mixed all the ingredients together (no need to layer).  I also threw a can of corn into the mixture.  Boyfriend loved it and it made tons of leftovers!

Delish!  I made this tonight.  It's super easy and I love that the ingredients are things that I just have on hand.  

My husband and I like hot so I used medium salsa and Rotel and added some fresh javanero and jalapeno peppers that I needed to use up.  Also added some ripe olives and cooked the chicken in olive oil instead of boiling.  

Next time I'll try to add some sour creme.  

Definitely a favorite casserole dish!

This was wonderful. I layered it like a lasagna and it was wonderful. Even my 11 year old who is not fond of salsa gobbled this up and asked for more. I have never rated a recepie before but had to let everyone know how great this recipie was.

I really liked this casserole.  I browned the chicken in a skillet instead and I didnt layer anything, I just combined it all at once. You can use Rotel or salsa, any kind of cheese, any kind of soup, add veggies...   its great!

My 8 year old is a huge fan of salsa, so when I saw this recipe I had to try it!  Very tasty and simple to make.  The only change I made was using Chicken broth to cook the Chicken in instead of the water, just for an added flavor.  Came out GREAT!

Not bad. I didn't boil the chicken, I choppedit up and cooked it in a pan with cuin,salt, pepper, chilli powder. Also, I didn't layer I just mixed it up. Needed more salsa/moisture to it but over all decent recipe.

This was good, it had a nice flavor.  Being a cheese lover, I never thought I would say that something had too much cheese, but this did.

Neither my husband nor I liked this recipe. I'm not sure why, because we usually like this sort of thing. It just wasn't good. We could hardly finish our meal.

Pretty good, but needed a little seasonings or else i think it would have been too bland.  I added a pinched of red pepper flakes and it seemed to do the trick.  Tasted much better the next day.

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this recipe. I opted to grill the chicken because I do not like boiled chicken. I will probably add another chicken breast next time, and I'll cut the onions at least in half. Otherwise, very good recipe and keeps well in the fridge.

We loved this recipe!  It was a bit of a hassle because I used a lot of pans and bowls and it took a while to make, but the ingredients are not that expensive and it tasted really great.  I sauteed the onion and the chicken together, and used brown rice instead of white for more nutritional value.  We'll make this again!

Quite yummy, though I made several changes to the original recipe. Did an ingredient search and found the recipe. As a result, had most, but not all require ingredients. The largest missing ingredient was the Cream of Chicken soup. Substituted things of similar consistency - Miracle Whip and Horseradish Mustard. Didn't measure, but certainly didn't include a soup can full of those two. Used havarti cheese in place of the recommended shredded cheese. Result was quite delicious! Will definitely try again and look forward to additional variations!

Pretty good.  Instead of all that chicken, I decided to half the amount and used about 3/4 pound of smoked sausage.  I also used medium salsa and it still did not have enough kick for someone like me who enjoys spicy foods.  
If you follow the recipe as is, I would sugget that you either mince the onions, or cut them FINELY, unless you want to go ahead and cook it before adding.  I was left with chunks of onion bits, which is fine for me, but I'm sure those with kids may not.

I made this for Cinco de Mayo.  While making it, I wasn't to sure, but the end results were great.  I didn't have Monterey Jack cheese, so I doubled up on the cheddar cheese.  Also while cooking the chicken, I cut it into bite size pieces to start, instead of waiting for it to cool.  I also added some cumin, salt and pepper to the chicken while cooking.  I also only used 1-2 a viladlia onion instead of a whole onion.  I suggest that you top with sour cream, and chilies to give a kick.  We will definatly have this again.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is tasty.  I varied it a bit, but it still came out fine.  (I used brown rice, sauted the chicken, used different types of cheese, and used a can of chicken broth instead of cream of chicken soup--with half a cup less salsa to make up for the broth.)

Pretty good.  I grilled the chicken and used 3 breasts (next time will use 4), I used 2 cups of uncooked rice, and a can of cheddar cheese soup instead of cream of mushroom.  I would make this again, very easy and tasty.

I made this and found out how quick and easy it really was. I didn't follow the recipe exactly, as I only had 3 breasts and 1 can of soup. I added peppers, mushrooms, black olives and more salsa than asked for. I also just used the cheese packaged as mexican mix. I cooked my chicken on my George Foreman grill. It was so good that everyone had 2 helpings and there was very little left over.

Man, Did I change this.  Well..I slow cooker'ed some chicken so that it was tender and shreddable instead of usin' a saucepan.  Threw some spices in there of course, adobe, sazon, and tequila lime marinade, water for about eh, 6 hours, just till things fell apart really.  I halved the amount of the whole recipe so I only used the condensed cream of chicken soup, instead of plain rice, I used a box of rice and red beans aka Arroz con Habichuelas Coloradas.  Didn't have Monterey Jack so I used Mozzarella instead.  Everything turned out EXTREMELY good.  I'm gonna stuff this in a tortilla tomorrow maybe along with some home made refried beans.  And maybe taco bell style it and pop it in the George Foreman for a little added grill mark.  Heh-Heh.  Muchos kudos for the backbone.  BOYFRIEND LOVED IT!

My family liked this recipe.  I added two cloves of chopped garlic to the salsa/soup layer.  We put the leftover casserole into soft taco shells the next night and we liked this dish better with the taco shells.  If I make this again, I will substitute the white rice with spanish rice.  What I really like about this recipe is that you can modify it a bunch of ways.  You could substitute chicken for turkey, you can make this spicier or milder, you can use any cheese you have on hand....very versatile!

I loved the idea of having so many layers. One batch of this and your family will be eating for days. A few changes before I make again: half an onion is plenty; white chesse such as jack, mozz, or muenster instead of cheddar; pureed salsa instead of chunky (family isn't big on tomatoes). Or leave the salsa out and add another cream soup and chopped broccoli.

This is a wonderful recipe. Made it for the picky inlaws and they loved it! Definately a keeper. Subbed cream of celery soup for cream of mushroom due to allergies and still worked well.
