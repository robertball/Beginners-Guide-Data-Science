This pizza is the bomb! Went by the recipe, but used
my own dough and sauce, red onion instead of white
and added sliced Roma tomatoes. I also substituted
an Asiago/Romano blend for the mozzarella cheese.
Baking time was 20 minutes at 400ยบ, but my pizza
was 14 inches, and pretty thick. If you're looking for
a great veggie pizza, look no further, this is is. Five
stars and highly recommended!

This wss absolutely wonderful, and we are not vegetarians.  I increased the onion and bell pepper to about 2/3 cup of each (some of the bell pepper was red).  I also added about 2/3 cup of defrosted and nuked broccoli cuts, and a 3 oz. layer of shredded Monterey Jack cheese right on top of the tomato sauce (before adding the veggies).  I always wait to add the mozzarella cheese until the veggies are hot.  Otherwise, the cheese topping is melted and brown before the pizza is heated through.  Magnifico!!!  Will make this very often when we feel like a meatless meal.

The first thing I did was add this to my recipe box. Thanks Rani! Second, I invited my best friend over for lunch and this was the hit of the day. I put red onions on my half as friend does not do onions. Perfect pizza, great flavor, super fast meal. Also one I'd let my grand kids "design" when they're here and offering to prepare lunch or dinner. You do not have to be a vegetarian to totally enjoy this pizza!!

I used one canister of reduced fat crescent roll dough that I baked, then cooled. I used a quarter of the tomato sauce (I have to watch the amount of tomatoes I take in--I did season it up a little with homemade italian seasoning), baby bella mushrooms, chopped red pepper and half the amount of cheese. I baked it again for under ten minutes just to melt the cheese and heat slightly. I really liked this and I think my husband did as well because he ate two pieces out of a "four" piece pizza.

Tasted just OK.  By the time you buy the ingredients it is basically the same price as Pizza Hut Veggie lovers that actually tastes better.

What an easy, yummy dinner. I added fresh sliced tomatoes. There were quite a bit of veggies but I was worried I'd still be hungry, but just two slices were quite filling. Even my husband thought so! I'll definitely be making this again.

This is a pretty good base for an outstanding pizza.  I mix provolone with my mozzarella because I like the St. Louis-ish flavor in my cheese.  I do my own sauce that has some clover honey for sweetness.  So, in this instance, you might try Portabella mushrooms and some fresh basil.

This recipe is just what I was looking for. I saute my veggies with a little olive oil and basil before adding them to the pizza. The veggies usually need a bit more cook time than the premade crust/ cheese, so that works for me!

I thought this recipe was a good basic veggie pizza recipe. Nothing to fancy and easy to add to depending on what you like. I tried it with a whole wheat crust and thought that was a little dry so I will use a regular crust next time. Also, I used homemade marinara sauce and this added just a little bit of heat to the pizza.
