I've made this recipe multiple times and it's quickly become one of my favorites for lunch! I usually make this on bread for a sandwich but if I'm really feeling fancy I make this on toast (lol). I make this without the onions and celery because I'm not a fan of celery and I prefer the sweeter taste of this without the onions. I also cut back a little on the lemon juice and it turns out just to my liking every time. Thanks for sharing this! It's delicious!

I love this recipe. This is my favorite chicken salad. I think the honey was the perfect touch.  I'm sharing this with all of my friends.  Thank you so much for sharing.

I needed a quick recipe to use up some very ripe avocados. This was perfect! Good flavor. I didn't have sour cream so I just added a little more mayonnaise. I even added a chopped jalapeño to give it a kick.

The taste of this is really good. I think I goofed because I cut the recipe down but maybe didn't use the correct correlation of chicken to sauce. It was too saucy and I ran out of chicken. So my recommendation until I try this again and edit this review is to add the sauce to the chicken until you have it right. I love all these ingredients and I really love avocado. It could be that there is just too much mayo! I will work on this until I get it right. I'm sure the submitter of this recipe is just cringing right now reading this. But Runs with Scissors I did like this and will make it again! I promise!

I used canned chicken breast to cut down on time. It's pretty amazing!

I used store bought guacamole (which is mostly mashed avacado) which allowed me to omit the mayo. Delicious recipe!

My 7 yr old was so disappointed when the leftovers were gone! We loved it! I left out the onion and celery. I also always sub plain greek yogurt for sour cream too.

Very good recipe. I took off one star because there is way too much sauce for the amount of chicken. I used plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream cut back on the garlic and added cucumber instead of celery.

Made this with some left over chicken from dinner the night before. Put it on some toast with a tomato. Excellent chicken salad. My husband loved it.

Delicious. I added 1/4 cup fresh cilantro and 1 fresh jalapeño for kick and put on toasted bread with lettuce and tomato. Great recipe!  Thanks!
