I only used a can of tomato & green chile, 1 can of black beans, 1 can of corn, green onions, cilantro spice 9dried cilantro) (I didn't have fresh) salt and pepper. It tasted good, I put in the refrigerator so hopefully it will taste even better later!

I was very good! Something different and fresh. I served with pita chips and tortilla chips.
