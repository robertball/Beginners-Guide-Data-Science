I made this with pancetta.  My family loved it.  I will make it again.   This is a very easy dish.

This looks delicious! I am a lover of Italian food.  Maybe garlic and olive oil aren't authentic, but they are delicious in meals.
Sometimes putting your own twist on Italian food is the way to go.

Thick spaghetti and Pecarino Romano, five stars!

It was pretty good. A little salty for my tastes, but I had to use Pancetta...and Pancetta is always very salty to me.  My friend I shared it with absolutely loved it.

What can be used in place of the guanciale?  Not easy to find Italian meats in my area.  It looks delicious, hence the four stars.
