Definitely  easy.  I wasn't sure if the submitter intended this to be served warm  or  cold so I tried it both ways. Warm is much better.   I did add a drizzle of some lemon olive oil I had.. and I think it improved it. I did cut back on the amount of pasta and I am glad I did. I kept wishing I had an avocado to add to this, so next time... I will do that

My family loved this dish. My wife, who doesn't, like tuna much, and my daughter who is a picky eater both had seconds.  I added sweet red pepper for some crunch, left out the hot pepper flakes, and used goat cheese crumbles as I didn't have feta cheese.

Turned out very well and was quite tasty. I didn't measure any ingredients but added a few sliced mushrooms (and some bacon bits) as well. Would definitely make again and am looking forward to tomorrows leftovers.

I am trying to lose weight,so I replaced the pasta with zucchini noodles and it was really delicious. Simple and quick, I will definitely make this again.

As written this has nowhere near enough liquid for that much pasta. I followed the recipe but saved a tiny amount of the pasta water. Even added in with some olive oil this was way to dry. The night it was made we were putting extra lemon juice on each place and it helped. As leftovers we just tossed some spaghetti sauce in it as it was bone dry and called it tuna spaghetti surprise. That was really great. This recipe has promise with the flavor but needs a lot of adjustments. Either way more liquid, or far less noodles.

While the flavors were great together, it was so dry that the pasta got sticky and clumped up on my plate as I ate it.  Is this missing a step where you drizzle with olive oil or add back in reserved cooking water? Five stars for flavor, one for consistency.

The lemon zest and pepper add delicious layers of flavor to this dish, but I found it a bit dry. I'll definitely try it again and try to alter it slightly to avoid this.

Simple to make and tastes good. If you have leftovers, then you may need to add a little oil to help the noodles separate.
