Just as a side note, these are refrigerator pickles so just putting them in any old jar & leaving them in the refrigerator is fine. They are NOT intended to be shelf stable! Canning jars, rings & proper seals are not an issue! (Don't know why the web site added those in)

I made 4 pints of these and when I first tried them I really didn't care much for them. Not wanting to be wasteful I decided I would eat them in spite of my initial dislike. But the more I ate, the more I began to enjoy them. I will cut down a little on the cloves next time. But these go well in a salad with a honey yogurt dressing.

These are really good! Instead of the spices listed, I used a homemade pie spice mix and tied it up in a cheesecloth that I put into the jar. I would slice them thicker next time. I halved the recipe, and am now wishing I hadn't but since we will be going apple picking in the the next few weeks, I'll be making a full batch of these! I'd never tried pickled apples before, but decided to on a hunch that it would be a great topping for "LaMama Raisin Burgers" along with an applesauce or fruit based steak sauce. I'm just curious how long these stay good for, as I am planning to make a large jar of these (like one of those HUGE pickle jars) so we have these on hand for snacking. I can't wait to find other ways to use these apples!

The kids smelled this being made and said that it smells like wassail!  Officially, on Thanksgiving we get to try them.  Right now they look and smell so good, that I'm sure we will truly savor the flavor!

This was a decent recipe, there's not many recipes like it around. I'll make it again, but next time I'll probably leave out the lemon juice. It was an odd combination with the cinnamon and nutmeg. I'm not sure if it was included for help preserving but I think the vinegar will do that just fine on its own. I also wouldn't recommend using really tart apples, I think sweeter apples go better with the apple pie type of spices this calls for. Since you're not cooking the apples, the tartness doesn't have an opportunity to cook out and get sweeter as they would normally do with a pie.
