it tasted like top ramen and took 10x the time to cook it.

I had to whip something out in lighting-speed time and it won a standing ovation from the kids.
Easy to adapt to a rice dish too!

I would make this again.  I used two whole eggs because I didn't know what I'd do with two egg yolks and didn't want to waste them.  The egg is quite prominent so if you don't like them, omit.

Really good and really easy. To up the flavor a bit, I added a splash of asian sesame oil. Also, I don't like bean sprouts so I dropped some spinach leaves into the broth instead.

Fairly easy, but not a lot of flavor.  Would porbably add a good deal more ginger the next time.

There was nothing special about this recipe.  I thought it would be more like an egg drop soup but instead of being creamy the eggs were pretty chunky, that may have been my fault.  Overall I felt this soup was lacking something.

It turned out very bland.  We didn't enjoy it at all.  I ended up throwing it away.

Good recipe.  I added a good amount of peppers to it to spice it up.  I also used some homemade noodles a local chinese grocery store sells.  With these changes I would give it the 4 stars.

My family really liked this but I thought it would have been improved by adding some spinach.
