Made this without the cucumber (just didn't sound good) and about 1/2-3/4 the dressing called for (personal preference on most salads), and it was very good. Of course, I love dill, so it was to be expected! I also added a little extra pasta to use up the rest of a box. My daughter asked for the leftovers to pack in her school lunch box today, so I'm sure we'll be making this again and again.

My husband and daughter loved this dish.  I don't care for dill, but it is a nice alternative to traditional tuna salad.  I made this in the morning and let it hang out in the fridge until lunchtime.

Very light and refreshing on a hot summer day.  The ranch dressing and dill is a nice flavor combination.  This is a nice change from the mayo-based receipes.  The small shells are the perfect size for this.   The only change I made was to use 2 tsp. dried dill because I didn't have fresh dill on hand.  The quantities of the ingredients are right on except for the tuna.  I used 1 - 5oz. can of Tuna (nowadays Tuna cans are only 5 oz., not 6) but it wasn't enough.  Even a 6 oz can isn't enough for all the veggies and pasta.  Next time I will use 2 cans of Tuna and fresh dill.

Fabulous recipe, and I'm so glad I decided to double it.  I left out the red pepper, used dried dill instead of fresh, threw in about 1/4 cup of shredded cheddar and added salt and pepper.  I made it for lunch, and may just have more for dinner.  Thanks!

When I first put this dish together, I wasn't that impressed. Then I put it into the fridge, and it was 1000x better! Seriously, eat this cold. Also, add salt, 2 cans of tuna, 1 tablespoon of dill (if dried), and eliminate the cucumber if desired. I also used about 1 and a half cups of pasta twists. I thought this was a good amount of pasta.

Just what I was in the mood for.  A caterer I know made this for one event I helped her with and I am not a tuna eater usually, but I liked it a lot.  This recipe comes pretty close to hers.  I didn't even have the celery, red pepper, or cucumber on hand but made it anyway and thanks to the fresh garden cherry tomatoes and fresh dill, I didn't think those other ingredients were missed.

ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS YUUUUUM!! MY THREE YEAR OLD SON AND I ATE THE ENTIRE DISH IN ONE SITTING. I SEARCHED FOR A DISH WITH TUNA FISH THAT MY SON WILL ACTUALLY EAT, AND I FOUND A WINNER. THE ONLY ADJUSTMENT I HAD TO MAKE WAS TO ADD SALT, BUT THAT'S MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE. YOU GOTTA TRY THIS!!

Loved this!  Made it for the first time and had company.  They enjoyed the dish as well.  I used a tablespoon of dried dill and it worked.

This was a good salad.  It didn't have enough spice to it so I added some seasoned salt and that really made it taste good.  I didn't have the green onions but my family tends to not like raw onions.

I was looking for a meal to throw together in just minutes with ingredients I had in the house.  This fit that bill.  It was very good. I did not have dill so I didn't use that. I used 1 1/2 cups wheat macaroni noodles.  1/2 cup seems like much too small of a measurement. 1 1/2 cups was a GREAT amount, not too much, not too little. Everything else I kept the same.  My kids (5 and 3) at it well and asked for seconds.  Thanks Lilah for a quick and easy recipe!

This was soooo good! My 1 year old just wouldn't stop eating in and my 3 year old kept asking for more.  It tasted even better the next day. Nice and light with no soupy dressing at the bottom. Very Healthy.  I had to change a few things but think it would be even better with the original.  I didn't have ranch so I used Ceaser as well I put in a 1/8 tsp of seasoning salt and 1/8 tsp celery seed(personal preference).  sooo yummy thanks for the recipe!!

I thought it was lacking flavor, even after sitting in the fridge, but my husband liked it, and I liked all the fresh veggies in it so that's why I still gave it 3. My husband said it was "refreshing"
