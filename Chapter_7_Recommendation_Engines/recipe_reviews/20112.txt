Easy to make and delicious. I omitted the wine, and it still turned out fine. Using colby-jack cheese instead of cheddar gives a more mild, creamy taste for variety. Will definitely be making this again.

Among the best scrambled eggs I've eaten. No white wine, so I substituted sherry. And I added a little Monterey Jack in addition to the cheddar. Don't overcook. You want light and fluffy. Great.

I just made this for my family. Everyone took one bite and refused to eat the rest of this!  I followed the recipe exactly, and that was the problem. I should have read others' reviews that warned of the strong wine flavor that will be left on the eggs.

I'm not the best at scrambled eggs but I thought I'd give it a try. I scaled it down to 1 serving. I made it as written except I didn't have the wine.  I really like garlic but it had an odd taste in the eggs. Not sure if I cared for it. The eggs did have a nice soft texture. I will try this again when we get some wine into the house.

A nice change from regular eggs. Very rich and firm. The mayonnaise makes for a nice firm fluffy texture like fancy restaurant eggs!

The best! I made my version without the garlic...Yuck! and the wine. It turned out great. Nice and firm but also delicate. I used real mayo and cheddar cheese. I will experiment using Laughing Cow creamy cheese. These are "fancy eggs" my new recipe.

I made this for lunch today, and I wasn't especially impressed; I don't think the alcohol completely cooked off, so it had a  bite.

They smelled horrible and tasted as bad as they smelled. I think the garlic is what made them taste and smell so bad.

I LOVE this - I use it for my Sunday morning breakfast every week.  I change the spices according to my mood, have also used blush wines.  I adjust these by mixing ingredients before I add the mixture to the whisked eggs, then whisk just to combine.  These eggs don't have the "rubbery" texture of regular scrambled eggs - just don't overcook them to dry them out.  I took a couple of tries before I knew they were cooked long before they were typical.  But if you are in the mood for classic scrambled eggs, try these on a different day!  I love having eggs I don't want to saturate with ketchup.  Thanks, Jan!

I did not have Dry wine so I used a white sweet wine. I also used Monterey Jack Cheese. We do not have mayo so I used Miracle Whip.  The eyes turn out to sweet for my wifeâ€™s taste, but my daughter-inn-law gave them a 7 out of 10  I will try this one again with all the right ingredients.

I ate them, but I didn't particularly care for them.  I didn't like the wine taste in the eggs at all...it was so strong and I only added a little bit.  I did however like the addition of the mayo, it gave them a nice creamy smooth texture.  I was in the mood for something different, but I think I'll stick to my regular old scrambled eggs!

OMG, these eggs were heaven.  I got lazy and didn't want to blend any fresh garlic and I don't have any garlic powder so I didn't use garlic but I did use the rest of the ingredients and I tell you one thing, these eggs melted in my mouth.  I took one bite and the next thing you know the whole pan of eggs were on my plate. The taste is delicious and the eggs were super moist wow...  I felt guilty because I suppose to make these eggs for my family for breakfast this morning.  Now I have to make it again but this time I will use some fresh garlic.  Thank you for this recipe.

Great recipe! I admit, I changed a lot of things, but the inspiration from this recipe was wonderful. My changes: I made only one egg and added a little of everything else; I had to use a splash of zinfandel, because we didn't have any white wine (early Sunday morning); I used parmesan cheese instead of cheddar; and I added a little finely chopped green onion. It was a very hearty flavor, but I enjoyed it, and I'm not really an egg person. Even though I loved this morning's concoction, I will try next time to follow Jan's recipe, just to taste the original.

This was a big disappointment. I'm not sure what I did wrong. I omitted the wine, because I was feeding children, maybe that's what did it. When the eggs finished cooking, they became this weird dry yet mushy consistancy. I'm giving this 2 stars because the flavor was pretty good. Next time I make scrambled eggs, I may add cheese and garlic powder. Thanks for the creative ingredient ideas for scrambled eggs.

My husband and I didn't care at all for this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It did make the eggs very fluffy, but it also made them taste nasty.  We would have been  better off with just regular old scrambled eggs with a touch of garlic powder.  Won't be making this one again because neither one of us ate it!

These were good! A nice change from every day scrambled eggs. Followed the recipe to the "T" (except for scaling it down to 3 servings) and they came out very flavorful! Nice and firm and fluffy too! The kids weren't too crazy about them though...said they were too garlicky but they were perfect for my taste. Will definetly make again, but just for me and the hubby! :)

I doubled the garlic and used white cooking wine (I'm 18, can't purchase wine) instead, and this recipe was wonderful! It would also be great with diced onion or peppers. Very tasty :)

I didn't care for the taste of the wine in the finished product.  The eggs were fluffy and had a good texture, but my personal preference is just "regular" scrambled eggs.

If I could give this recipe more than five stars, I totally would.

These were incredible. I changed nothing.
These cooked up fluffy and had a wonderful flavor. I will be making my scrambled eggs like this from now on.

These were okay, but the wine overpowered all of the other flavors.  I couldn't taste the mayo or the cheese at all. My picky kids ate them too, but said they wouldn't want them again.

Freaking awesome.  I never had anything like it. I overdid the wine a bit but still delicious!!  Always use decent drinking wine to cook never use cooking wine as its way salty and makes a huge difference in taste.

I loved this recipe very much. I did increase the water by mistake but it really didn't matter as the eggs were marvelous.  I didn't have an open bottle of wine so I decided to drink Tequila instead.

It was okay. I think next time I would add a tomato because there just wasn't much flavor.

Keeping in mind these are scrambled eggs: Five Stars.  I'm so with TOKYO KAREN - these are like fancy restaurant eggs.  I halved this using one extra egg, a little less (light) mayo, and a little extra pepper. Everything else was the same.  Will definitely make again, as these were a refreshing change from 'the usual.'

These are GREAT! -However, if you don't like shrimp scampi then you probably won't like these. The wine & garlic makes these perfect. If you want to add shrimp & a little green onion it would taste great. I plan on doing so next time I make these!

Too much garlic for my taste. Will reduce by at least 1/2 next time. Otherwise good, nice and fluffy.

I will never make regular old scrambled eggs again! This is a great idea for the best eggs, and no need to cook in butter!! I used milk instead of  water. I paired this up with another recipe on this site called Sausage Potato Medley for dinner, and it went well together!! Thank you for the recipe I will always use!

I really liked this recipe. I didn't change a single thing about it. I was craving eggs, but not just any day scrambled eggs and this was just perfect.

I enjoyed these. I've never had mayo in my eggs before. I used sherry cooking wine instead of white wine. I didn't have any. The only thing I didn't like was the garlic powder. I like garlic, but I didn't think the powder went well with the eggs. Next time, I'll probably use onion. Good job.

I wasn't sure how I would like this, but it was very good. We didn't have any cheddar on hand so we went with a parmesan/asiago mix and it turned out very well. Next time I will try fresh garlic, but it was fine with garlic powder.

I followed the recipe exactly and I thought it turned out very good.  It leaves a nice garlicy after-taste.  Next time I will add some type of meat and some onion.
