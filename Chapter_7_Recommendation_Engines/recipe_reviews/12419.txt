This recipe is wonderful!  I skipped the wine sauce and served it with vanilla ice cream and hot caramel sauce. I made 6 individual tarts rather than one big one by using a 10 oz package of puff pastry shells and rolling each shell into a 5 inch circle.  It was a big hit at a recent dinner party.

This recipe was a great change of pace from the usual apple pie. I love apples and this recipe is now among my favorites.

This is a DELICIOUS recipe!  I substitued oats for the almonds, since some of my family don't care for nuts.  And instead of making the sauce, used a caramel sauce drizzled over it.  Yumm!  This is bound to be a family favorite.

I am going to be "that" cook that gives it five stars and then completely changes it!  I wanted to use what I had on hand - lots of pears and pecans.  I also went without the sauce and served it with vanilla ice cream.  This is a fantastic, easy dessert.  Thank you!

This recipe turned out great and was a huge hit with the crowd we fed. In fact, the last person to leave asked me for the aluminum foil and took the tray and all home with he and his wife! How funny! I did add one envelope of the instant Quaker Oats Cinnamon Roll Oatmeal to the crumb topping. It really made the difference. I also served this with Bryers Real Vanilla ice cream.

This is good.  My daughters really enjoyed it.  It is very light and looks good.  I liked the sauce, but it did not travel well.  It needs to be used immediately after cooking.  Otherwise, great recipe and I look forward to playing with it a bit (for examplee, trying brown sugar instead of white, adding a curd under the apples, etc.)

AWESOME!!  I have received so many compliments on this....and they keep coming!!  I skipped the home-made sauce and just bought Smuckers Caramel sauce and drizzled it on top.  This is almost too easy to make, but it tastes like you spent hours. Even though I did not include the home-made sauce, it was a huge hit.  I will be making this over and over again!

Really yummy dessert.  You can also use dessert shells if you like and bake the apple part separately and then fill them.

Loved this recipe!  It was super easy using the puff pastry too!  The only thing I did differently was to omit the egg yolks in the sauce - maybe next time I'll be braver about that!  (I had to thicken it up a little with 1/2 tsp. cornstarch)I also poured the wine sauce directly over the tart and I think I'd prefer to do that individually next time as it made it a little soupy.  Maybe if I hadn't left out the egg yolks it would've been fine?  It was still a GREAT recipe and next time I'll add a little oatmeal to crunch it up as well.

Lovely in every way. We made this with Golden Delicious apples, and it was just right - perfect flavour and perfect texture. The dessert sauce was incredible.

This was delicious! I didn't have any puff pastry so I just made a quick 10" pie crust and used sherry instead of Marsala wine and it was great !Otherwise followed recipe exactly.

Great recipe, you can dress it up with the sherry or you could dress it down with caramel depending on your main course.

Wow! My goal this weekend was to do something with that 10 pounds of apples we picked last weekend and I found this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and it exceeded my expectations! If you leave out the marsala wine sauce, then you have a nice "comfort food" dessert. The wine sauce stepped it up about 10 notches to a fine dessert you would serve after a nice dinner with friends. Trust me, they'll be impressed! This was off the hook!

My only problem with this recipe was measuring 3/8 cup. I ended up upgrading to 1/2 cup, but then I had too much toping. I should have rounded down to 1/4.

Loved it! However I did not have a puff pastry so I put the filling in a pie crust and it turned out delicious!  I also did not make the wine mixture but instead just left it as it was when it came out of the oven. We ate it while it was still quite warm and it dissapeared in no time!!

While immensely nice to look at, I found this tart to be merely good, not that great.  I used brown sugar in the topping but it was not as flavorful as I had hoped for; a bit of nutmeg may have helped that.  I created a lip of crust around the edges, which were  golden and tasty, but the center was fairly undercooked.  Be sure not to pile your apples up too high in the middle; spread them nice and evenly around the tart.  I would even bake it a bit longer to finish the underside of the crust.  We also skipped the sauce and used caramel and whipped cream instead.  A good recipe for a quick, easy dessert when you have too many apples!

Excellent! This has been a go-to recipe for a quick dessert when entertaining. It always receives rave reviews and requests for the recipe. I've never made the sauce, and it's delicious without it. A scoop of ice cream is a great addition, though.

Very good.  I didn't make the sauce because I'm allergic to alcohol.  But it didn't seem to be lacking anything to me without it.  I found I had quite a bit too much topping.  I didn't cut the pastry to a circle, and instead used the rectangle shape it came in.  (Why waste pastry, right?!)  I altered it a tad by using pecans because I prefer them.  Also decided to add a small handful of vanilla granola to the mix.  So good!

Yummy and easy. Seems like the fruit + nut combinations are endless. Used apples + chopped walnuts. Didn't make the sauce, served with some vanilla ice cream.

Just made this last night and it was a rave with my critical family. I put slices of fresh strawberries instead of apples and left out the cinnamon (didn't think cinnamon and strawberries mixed well).  But I'm sure you can put any fresh fruit you want in the middle and it'll still come out tasting wonderful.  Would definitely try this recipe over and over again with apples and with other fruit.  Seemed very light dessert.

This was excellent.  I brought it to a party the first time I made it and it was a big hit.
