An Easy recipe for kids to make. My granddaughter loved making these. We added cheese and a thin slice of dill pickle. The best part of this recipe is kids love hot dogs in any form.

Easy, good for a crowd...sent 16 of them along with a crockpot of chili to a family with four boys (teens). They loved it and my two boys (teenagers too) loved them as well.

I did what Lela recommended and they came out awesome. They are rich without the pickle but good in a pinch.  Hubby liked them.
