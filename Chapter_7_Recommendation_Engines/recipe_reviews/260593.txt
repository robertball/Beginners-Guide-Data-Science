Overall this is very good, with a nice balance of orange and pumpkin flavors, however it does need some tweaking to be 5 star. 3 cups of sugar was far too sweet for this family, next time will start with 2 cups and work up. Will also sub at least some applesauce for all the oil. I found that this needed two 9 x 5 loaf pans or 3 standard loaf pans (cleaning spillage out of the oven isn't high on my fun to do list) This is something I will definitely make again. Thanks and Happy Thanksgiving!
