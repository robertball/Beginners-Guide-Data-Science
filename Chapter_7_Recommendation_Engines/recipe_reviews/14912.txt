Wow!  Everyone loved this one, and has requested this to be a "keeper."  I used a can of crushed tomatoes in place of the chopped fresh, and it was still good.  If you have no finely shredded cheese, other shreds will do, but the texture may not be to your liking: it is bumpy. This is a great dip.

This is the best 7 layer dip recipe I've tried yet.  And if you use light sour cream and light cream cheese it's still just as yummy.

Made this for a party and it was devoured by a group of men. I used mild salsa but will use either medium or hot next time as the dip was not spicy enough.

Awesome dip.  I drained some of the juice from the salsa and drained and seeded the tomato, which made it less soupy.  It still was great the next day as well.

This is a great recipe because it doesn't include the mushy beans.  However, I did change it a bit based on the reviews.  I omitted the soy sauce, lemon juice, hot sauce, olives (not generally a crowd favorite) and tomatoes (seemed to be the cause of watery mess and there is enough tomato product in the salsa).  I creamed together the sour cream and cream cheese with a half a package of hot taco seasoning.  Then I layered as instructed with medium chunky salsa, green onions, roman lettuce, and cheddar cheese.  I felt the hot taco seasoning and medium salsa made this dish not bland as other commented.  You can always temper the seasonings to your taste with the salsa, hot sauce, and taco seasoning.  I also had no issues with juices, even after a night in the fridge.

I made this for a work party and it was a hit. I made the cream cheese mixture the night before and added the other "stuff" an hour before the work party. I think I would probably drain the salsa a little though, it made it a little watery, but it was still a hit. I was the only one worried about it, but it went. I even added some Mexican cheese, red - yellow peppers, avacado - it looked great and tasted great. Awesome recipe.

I omitted the soy sauce, used reduced fat cream cheese and reduced fat sour cream, used lime juice instead of lemon juice. I also stirred homemade taco seasoning into the cream cheese/sour cream. Next time, I'll cut back the lettuce.

This is a fantastic party pleaser!  I used diced red peppers instead of tomatoes to top the dish and I've upped the amount of hot sauce because we like our food spicy!  There is never anything left when we take it to office parties, and the really great thing is you don't even need a spoon.  Just grab a couple of bags of scoop style chips and you are good to go.  Thank you Kathy G for sharing this terrific dish!

Simple enough recipe, and simple enough in taste.  This was ok, disappointed in the lack of taste with the Hot pepper sauce and the soy sauce.  I will stick to mixing in taco seasoning instead.

Good, easy recipe!  I make it for work parties and it is always one of the first dishes gone.  To save time I buy the lettuce pre-shredded, like for tacos.

Love this recipe.  Made it for a few parties and its always been a hit.  One time I screwed up and bought taco sauce instead of salsa, but I think I liked the taste a little better.  It gave it a little more kick than just mild salso.  Something to try!

This dip is so tasty! You won't be able to stop eating it. Bring it to a party and it'll be a hit, I promise! I love this taco dip especially because I'm not a big bean fan and there's no beans in it.

I didn't think that the seasonings were enough so I added some packaged taco seasoning. It was great that way.

This recipe is great. Instead of the hot pepper sauce and soy sauce I use a dry package of taco seasoning mix and add to the cream cheese and sour cream and beat well. I always get asked for this recipe when ever I take it to a party.

Recipe was VERY easy!  Much like other reviewers I do not care for the refried beans in many other dips.  I did do a few things different, I used fresh salsa (not cooked), used hot wing sauce (instead of pepper sauce, because that is what I had).  I also mixed the salsa in with the cream cheese mixture (misread of the recipe) but that worked out GREAT, just this would be a great dip for chips, pretzels, etc. I would also recommend draining some juice off the salsa. Next time, I might add some more hot sauce-for my taste buds it is not a spicy dip.

I added half a package of low sodium taco seasoning to the cream cheese, and it was fantastic, but was still a 5 star when I made it "as is".

This is bland. A splash of soy or hot sauce in a huge vat of cheese is going to drown. I added an enormous amount of hot sauce, but not even that could liven up this dairy-heavy dip. The flavors are very mild, very mid-western. If you love bold, Mexican flavors, this is not for you.

I made used this recipe as a base for a new years party and it was a total hit! The pan was literally scraped clean. 
For mine, I omitted the lemon juice and soy sauce. I kept the hot sauce (which was what initially attracted me to this recipe). I used kidney beans instead of refried, and added some jalepenos on the top. Once prepared, I put it in the oven at ~375 degrees for about 5 minutes (just long enough for the cheese on top to melt). The inside was still cool and the melted cheese was delicious!

This was OK but I was expecting something more...Husband commented on  the soggy cheese on the top with the lettuce which didnt agree with him. In his words he didnt get the "concept" of the dish (!!)...I am wondering if it is cos he is Mexican and so he was expecting something more authentic. I liked the combo of the soft cheese and salsa and may vary the dish, keeping these 2 ingrediants...thanks anyway!

My family liked this dip.  My husband would have preferred there to be meat in it, but I really liked it as is.  I used mild salsa so that my young children could eat it, but I really didn't need to.  The cream cheese & sour cream really mellowed out the salsa and you couldn't even really taste it.  Next time I will use medium or even hot salsa and I'm sure it will be fine for the young ones.  This is not a "walk by and dip" kind of dip.  If you're wanting something that folks can grab a chip, dip it and move on, this is not the dip - it's too thick.  It's best when scooped out onto your plate.  Very yummy - thanks for the recipe!

This was a good recipe.  I made a few modifications.  I just added a package of taco seasoning to the cream cheese/sour cream mixture instead of the lemon juice, soy sauce, etc.  I also didn't use all of the salsa; I just put a nice thick layer on.  And, I thought this dip would be ample with just 1 tomato for the top.  It ended up being a great recipe, and I was requested to make it again for our next gathering!

This appetizer went!!!  All loved it and said it was so addicting and tasty.  I added more parmesean cheese to the cream cheese just to add flavor and a tad bit of hot sauce.  People love BLTs, therefore they love this dip!

This was a good taco dip.  I didn't put tomatoes on it(salsa IS tomatoes), and had to skip the green onion(didn't have any).  I would definitely use the green onions next time, as it would really compliment these flavors.

Darn good. I made this for a get together over at the neighbors and having never made this recipe before, I was a little worried about trying it out on them and it being a disaster. The only seven layer type dip I've ever had, has always included refried beans, I thought I would miss that ingredient. I liked this better and will make it again and again.  This was a hit.

First of all DO NOT rinse the head lettuce! Otherwise, the lettuce is water-logged and ruins this dish as well as other recipes like this .  DON"T rinse head lettuce, Just take off the outer leaves and this dip will turn out.

This recipe is great, its actually quite similar to my aunties. The only thing I did change was I added  two teaspoons of taco seasoning.

I made this for a family event and it was gone within minutes!  The only thing I did different was to use taco seasoning mix instead of the lime juice, etc.

This recipe was great.  I have never made anything like this before and it was the hit of my Super Bowl party.  Everyone loved it and kept asking for the recipe.  Thanks for sharing it.

This is my favorite layered Mexican Dip. I really don't care for refried beans & guacamole & there are none of those icky things in this recipe. :-)
