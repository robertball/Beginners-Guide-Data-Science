I made this with Ground Turkey and it was amazing!  I left out the hot chili's because I can't eat hot spicy food, and it was still great!  I think it's the hominy and cilantro!

This turned out really well as a basis for my modified chili. We really watch our salt intake, and my husband is allergic to corn, which required some modifications to the ingredients. I'm also a little bit lazy. 

What I changed: 
- Instead of turkey, used 1 lb ground chicken and 1 lb ground sausage.
- Only one (large) onion
- Used about 36 oz. of reduced sodium chicken broth, which is less than what the recipe called for. 
- Replaced the hominy with a can of Northern beans, and instead of 3 cans of white beans unblended, I used 2 plus 1 of pinto beans.
- Omitted the Cajun and serranos.
- Added 7 oz of green chilis, about 16 oz of salsa verde, and some pinches of chili powder and red pepper flakes.

I correctly assumed this wouldn't all fit in my small crock-pot, so I did it on the stovetop in a dutch oven for the same amount of time (about 6 hours), stirring every once in awhile, and without the lid on for the last hour so it could reduce a bit.

Turned out great! Nice flavor, not too spicy (I have a tender mouth), but not too bland either (my husband likes things spicier). We served with an irish soda bread, which is very cornbread-like without corn, and it was a great dinner. Hope you enjoy this recipe as much as we did!

Make sure that you like Hominy before you make this because it has a very strong flavor.  I would have used about a third of it had I known that it would be such a dominate flavor.  It tasted like Hominy and cumin.  I would not make this again even if I tweaked the amounts.

Slow Cooker Turkey & White Bean Chili Haiku: "Took some time to prep. (Way more than 20 minutes.) But well worth the wait!" I halved the recipe, only having a 14.5 oz. can hominy, but it was definitely time-consuming to cook and shred the turkey breast, and blend the beans/broth/hominy. (I don't have an immersion blender, so I just dumped the cans in my regular blender, then poured it into the crockpot.) I was a little disappointed that the Cajun seasoning and serrano pepper flavor didn't come thru very strongly, but bonus points for that - my spice-averse-yung'in was able to devour her bowl. I think if I make this again, I'll wait til I have some leftover chicken or turkey to shred, increase the spices, and wait to put the cilantro in at serving. (It virtually disappeared  into a faint afterthought.) Otherwise, a very tasty chili w/ a glob of sour cream, green onions, and a handful of crushed tortilla chips in the bowl.

I made this with 2 lbs ground turkey and more serrano pepper and seasonings. Just mushed the hominy and one can beans with a fork instead of all that trouble with the immersion blender. It came out great! Just through it all in the crockpot and let it go. Didn't pre-cook the ground turkey since it doesn't have a whole lot of grease wasn't worried about it ending up swimming in grease and it wasn't. Everyone at work loved it. Will defenitely be making this again.

On a rainy day this hit the spot with corn bread. Couldn't find turkey breast so used ground turkey breast meat and it worked out very well. Shared with family neighbors on this rainy day who loved it as well.  Will keep this in mind during the cold season.   TS

This was very spicy.  I will make it again but change/reduce the seasonings.

This recipe is great with modifications.  I used 3 jalapenos and 1 poblano chili, 2  11 oz. cans of (Green Giant) chipotle white corn.  I also used home made turkey stock and left over turkey (from  Thanksgiving).  Blended together one can of beans, corn and some stock as directed.  I did not need the cumin or the cajun seasoning.  I cooked everything on high in the crock pot for about 4 hours.  I also added some corn starch thickening at the end. Everyone put on their own cilantro and cheese.  The chili had a deep rich flavor without being too spicey.  Everyone raved about it and went back for more (2 daughters, their husbands and my husband as well as myself).  By far the best white chili I have ever made or tasted!

I love this recipe, of course with a few changes.  I use chicken istead of turkey, and i poach it instead of panfrying it.  I also only use one onion instead of two.  With those few changes its awesome!

I removed the cilantro and substituted Great Northern beans for cannellinis - next time I might add more serranos and some chipotle or chili powder to add more kick.  I'd also reduce the amount of broth, as mine came out a bit soupy.  Overall a pretty solid recipe that's easy to tweak to taste!

Sort of bland, but not bad. Made it for a group so I went light on the serrano chili and cajun seasoning so it may be why it was slightly bland.

My husband and I really liked this.  I cut the recipe in half and used the slow cooker.    I found it a good base that you can add to or alter a bit  to your liking.   I omitted the hot chilies, my husband doesn’t care for spicy foods.   Being short on the white beans, I substituted 1 can of garbanzos.   I also added chopped carrots and added some leftover turkey gravy to thicken it up a bit more.   It’s a keeper.

I love this chili as a springboard to something custom. As a base it turned out good but was a bit to mellow for my taste. To added 1 Corona beer and then to taste (and mix) I added, salt, sugar (sweetening it up woke up some flavors), black pepper, more Cajun, and a little bit of Accent. I let it sit and absorb for a couple hours and it was pretty darn good. The recipe is mellow to begin with so you can't go to crazy with spices, otherwise you keep adding and adding and then it turns out crappy. It is what it is but beefing up the flavors a bit turned out good. Good stuff and healthy! I didn't change anything else. Next time I might try it with ground turkey and Italian sausage (sweet or mild).

Tried this to use my new immersion blender. Very tasty! I omitted the fresh peppers since I don't like spicy hot, and added about 1/8 tsp red pepper for a mild pepper flavor. Also I just put everything in the crock pot without pre-cooking and it turned out fine.

Visually, this recipe is pretty dull.  The taste is okay and I believe kids would like the simple flavours.  I don't think I would make this again only because it wasn't that memorable in taste or otherwise.

I found this to be a forgiving recipe that was easy to modify and still came out great. I halved the recipe and, like many folks, used ground turkey breast. Also, I don't keep Cajun spices or hominy (because I don't like them), so substituted smoked paprika for the former and Garbanzo beans for the latter (which I blended with the one can of cannellini beans I had). Since I didn't have any more white-type beans to be dumped in intact, I used a can of pintos. And Despite cutting everything else in half, since I like spicy foods, I used three jalapenos (didn't have serranos). I served it topped with chunks of cheddar, a sliced green onion and fresh cilantro. Delicious! I suspect it'll be even better tomorrow night!
