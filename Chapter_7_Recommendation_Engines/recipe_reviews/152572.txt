that's a very nice and tastefull idea, for me it looks like (let's say) an other version of a traditional greek food. But I should mention that for me, feta cheese is not a kind of cheese that we should mix with other kinds, and since the recipe has a special let's say "taste" to serve it together with a greek salad, which would be excellent and as colour and as taste...

thank you very much for your recipe it is very nice

What a treat this recipe is lovely cinnamon,allspice garlic, peppers & onion really give this recipe a taste treat.  I used herb "Apetina" feta. I cut the recipe in half and my eggplant was not that large so I had quite a bit of stuffing left over.  I just wrapped it in foil and baked it along side.  Makes for a tasty lunch next day.  This is a do again recipe for sure.

This came out beautifully and it is delicious. The only change I made was to omit the bell pepper and double the onion (due to family preference). It was flavorful and fun. Perfect! THANKS!

Really good.  However I would slow cook the onions first until really soft.  Take them out, put in the lamb and peppers (i used a red bell), cook them down and add onions.

I made this for dinner last night, using 2 small eggplants since it was just for hubby and me.  We both enjoyed it very much!  The aroma of the lamb with the cinnamon and allspice was wonderful.  Hubs said I should make it again!  High praise, indeed!

this was an interesting and tasty dish, the cinnamon was a little over powering, even when cut down,  so it may be omitted next time and i was thinking this might be a good recipe to liven up regular suffed peppers (omitting the eggplant entirely) but over all good and very fillng!

My husband and I found this recipe to be very sausage-y tasting. And while I do enjoy sausage, it was overwhelming even for me. It's not the recipe's fault, just my personal taste.

Excellent. One of my favourites. Really, I can't say much more. While it may not be the prettiest lookning dish, it's what's underneath that counts. YUM.

This recipe was prefect as written.  I made no changes except I used a garlic Feta.  This is a VERY hearty meal (more then enough).  For breakfast the next day I reheated the filling and served it with eggs and toast instead of potatoes.  Perfect and wonderful. A keeper!

This recipe was delicious and we will certainly make it again.  We used reduced fat cheeses and multigrain toast rubbed with fresh garlic for bread crumbs.

I had never ventured to cook lamb beyond grilled lamb chops.  This was an instant success with a lot of positive feedback and vying for the leftovers even though I forgot to include the marsala sauce. Next time I will include the Marsala.

itis still in the oven, so i havent tasted it yet.  my advice is to either half the meat recipe if you are only using two eggplants.  if not, then you can easily stuff three eggplants with this mixture.  i had so much left over so i put around the sides of the eggplants ending up with something that looks like a 9x10 inch meatloaf.
also when picking the eggplants try to get male eggplants.  they have lots less seeds.  mine were female and after discarding the seeds, i had very little eggplant pulp left.  if you dont know how to tell male from female...look at the bottom of the eggplant.  males have a round bellybutton,  females have a longer almost slit like bellybutton.  no joke.
since this turned out to be so much meat, i am making some rice to serve with it.  a simple salad, too.

I used two small eggplants and had lots of filling left, so I baked it in a separate dish and will use it later for something.  Really enjoyed the flavors in this, especially the cinnamon and allspice.  I will make this again, only with bigger eggplants!

First time, forgot the marinara and skipped the bread crumbs (SB phase one). Still really good. Second time, remembered the marinara and still skipped the bread crumbs ( don't think they're needed and still on SB). Even better. Third time, decreased the marinara a little and added more spices.  We have a winner!

I love eggplant and lamb so it was nice that this recipe called for both. I think it would have been better without the cinnamon and allspice. Lamb has a very distinct taste and the spices completely overpowered the flavor of the lamb. I will make this again but I will omit the spices. Otherwise, this was a pretty solid recipe and a more creative alternative to stuffed peppers.

This is a very traditional Greek tasting recipe. I loved it and I am not a big lamb fan. I like moussaka as well and this reminds me of that. It was easy to prepare and for us enough for another meal. That went into the freezer after I cooked it so it will only need to be reheated in the microwave when the time comes.

I think cinnamon and allspice in meat is probably an acquired taste and I have never eaten it before.  It wasn't bad and I'm willing to try it again.

This turned out well. We cooked the other eggplant the next day and used the left over filling. Even better the next day. I used half the cinnamon and it still was more than I’d like. I’m just not a fan of cinnamon in a main dish.

This is one of the BEST recipes that I've ever found and every time that I make it for someone new it becomes one of their favorite meals. It's a little time consuming but worth it. 

My only advice it that freshly crushed allspice vs ground allspice makes a huge difference and I cut the marinara a little and add some crushed tomatoes (decent quality usually in a box vs a can), I also play around with the ingredients and spices a little but you can't really go wrong with this. It's delicious every time.

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

I purchased ground lamb that was already seasoned so did not use the spices. It was a little too salty but this may not be the fault of the recipe but rather the preseason don't lamb. Otherwise very good dish.

Overall, we liked this dish. I did brown the ground lamb first in a bit of olive oil, then softened the onion and garlic in the same pan.

This came out so delicious! I did have to make substitutions though, due to the dietary restrictions of some family members- but the only thing I substituted was the lamb, since I have a family member who cannot eat lamb. I made 2 separate fillings- 1 with ground turkey, and 1 with ground beef. Both came out tasty!

This was delicious. The only changes I made were to change the cinnamon and allspice to cumin and coriander. It probably would have tasted great if I'd just left it alone, but the thought of cinnamon spiced lamb was just too far outside my food comfort zone. Otherwise, I followed it exactly. I felt like we were eating at a fancy restaurant. Even my husband, who dislikes eggplant, cleaned his plate and asked me to make it again soon.

This recipe is awesome -simple, delicious, and versatile. Even my college son who does not like eggplant, gave it a try and approved. The second time I made it with some changes: I used ground turkey as I did not have lamb, used freshly grated Parmesan cheese instead of Feta, and seasoned croutons for breadcrumbs. To cut down the cooking time, I microwaved the eggplant halves for 10 mins. to soften and scoop out the flesh, and after stuffing the shells, I microwaved them again for another 10 minutes until the filling was set. Then put in the oven to melt and brown the mozzarella. I baked he leftover filling in a mini bundt pan and everything came out GREAT!
