Great anytime of the day recipe. I made twice with and without the salsa. Love salsa but in it makes it too wet for and flimsy for our liking. But if you add to your egg mixture upon cooking as I like to do then it's perfect (love salsa in cooked eggs). However for easy portability for little hands leave the salsa off and put it on the side which we liked better. Either way the recipe is really good.

Yummy! I didn't have SPAM available so I used ham instead. It was still delicious!

Yummy breakfast quesadilla recipe! The SPAM is really good and browned in this recipe. I'm a huge fan of a crispy tortilla so this is right up my alley! Thanks Crikkitt!

Super good and easy. Made it a couple different ways and really liked the salsa on the side. Basic and delicious.

Easy breakfast quesadilla especially when you don't have fresh meat available.
