I made this because I wanted to quick recipe and have cooked fish in every way but poaching! I added a generous amount of minced garlic and eyeballed amounts of cilantro and green onion. Rather too much soy sauce, so I'd recommend cutting in half or so.  Otherwise, a good basic recipe.

Easy, delicious. I used tilapia fillets and cut back on the water and soy sauce for just 2 servings. I have not poached fish in a long time and it was tender and flaky. Served with quinoa and green salad. Thank you Chris.

Soy sauce and rice vinegar are not considered Paleo foods. This recipe should not have PALEO as part of the name. That would be like having a recipe with flour in the recipe as gluten free. SMH.

Nice & light. I'd use a little less  water & soy sauce. Just a tad too salty but I will definitely make it again - so easy!

Very juicy flavorful fish.  The cilantro was a flavorful touch and good way to use up some extra I had. Easy way to make a healthy dinner

Very easy and delicious. I added a cream sauce and topped with fresh basil and green onions.
