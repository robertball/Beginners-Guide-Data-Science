Soooo good! I was so surprised how sweet this was. My son said it tasted like starburst. It was not overly sweet though. Can not really taste the carrot juice, which I think is a good thing.

3/14/17 Update: I added an apple and it gave it a nice twist. My husband went crazy for it. 4/8/16I love new ideas for my juicer. This is a great combination of flavors that goes perfectly with brunch. Lime and pineapple give the sweet carrot a very unique twist. The pulp makes a great cake!  Thank you for the recipe.

This was very good my mom and I had it but my carrots didn't taste so I added half and half milk, plain milk, and maple syrup
I definitely would make this again. And I do recommend this healthy drink.
