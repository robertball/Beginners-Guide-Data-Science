This was a pretty simple recipe. I made a sugar free version and a couple other adjustments. I made the portion larger by adding broccoli slaw to the mix. For the marinade, I used Apple cider vinegar, grapeseed oil, stevia powder, sea salt, and fresh ground pepper. This is definitely something I'll make again!

I made this just as directed, except for the optional green pepper. At first I thought this was awesome, but after a couple of bites it started to turn my stomach because it was so sweet. I should have known better when I saw the 1/2 cup of sugar in the ingredients, but I gave it a shot anyways. I tried to remedy this by adding in some more salt & pepper and some basil - it helped a bit, but it was still not as palatable as I would hope for. I just personally am not a fan of sweet vinaigrette dressings. I would like to try this again though with some fresh summer veggies from the garden. Next time I think I will try it with apple cider vinegar, salt, pepper, and dill and omit the sugar. 
If you like sweet vinaigrette though, you're going to love this.

I substituted the apple cider vinegar and added a little balsamic as well.  I also added a little Italian seasoning to the dressing.  It was a huge hit at a barbecue.  Nice and refreshing on a hot day.

This was very good for our camping trip. I made it ahead and put in a tight Tupperware container. Everybody raved about it, I did add in some celery seed since I really like that in coleslaw and used white wine vinegar. One thing I did was cut the sugar down by almost half, oil and vinegar down some also, it seemed like an awful lot for just 10 ounces, and glad I did, still a great amount of liquid and not too sweet.

Great Coleslaw.  Followed the directions precisely.  Marinated over night and all the flavors blended.  Served using a slotted spoon as there was a lot of pooling liquid in the bottom. Next time I serve it, I will drain off the liquid right before I set it on the table.

This is an easy, light summer slaw.  I followed the recipe except left out the cucumbers just because I don't care for them.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Hubby & I LOVED this. I made a half batch & we finished it off in 1 meal. I did not use the green pepper & used red onion in place of the green onion, only because that's all I had on hand. I think I'll up the vinegar a bit for me for a bit more kick but hubby said he loved it BECAUSE it wasn't heavy on the "kick". Great recipe that'll be a repeat year round!

This was awesome...I used Splenda instead of real sugar and everyone raved about this cole slaw.  Will definately make it again and again. So much better than using mayo.  Thank you for posting!

RECIPE GROUP: This was very good, especially when you throw in 'ease of use'...I made half recipe, and couldn't find shredded cabbage so chopped my own. Dressing was sweet and soooo tasty. Used a whole Roma tomato for the half recipe. Yum. Marinated two hours before supper, I look forward to further marinated goodness at lunch tomorrow!

I made this late for Recipe Group. It was good, but a little too sweet for me. I didn't fill the 1/2 cup sugar all the way to the top, and I still thought it was a bit sweet. The cucumbers are really what makes this slaw good. I chopped my own cabbage, and I probably had about 16 oz. My tomato was small, so I added some red bell pepper for color.

I used a 16oz bag of slaw mix (with carrots and red cabbage) and a bunch of green onions because that was all I had on hand.  This was still wonderful!  Can't wait to try it with the green peppers and cucumber, but I will leave out the tomato to suit our tastes.

Excellent made with Zylitol instead of sugar!  Use equal parts (sugar to zylitol) or less to taste.

I made this for a 4th of July party and it just didn't do it for anyone. The fresh veggies were wonderful, of course, but the dressing was far from being good. I tried doctoring with other ingredients. It didn't work. I will not try this again.

Love it.
So easy and refreshing. Used only one third cup of sugar, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Did transfer to another bowl before serving, just so there was not so much liquid on the bottom. Will definitely will make again and again.

Great change from creamy slaw.  It was sweet and a bit less tangy than I expected but our guests loved it.  The fresh veggies brighten it up a lot.  Definitely on our menu again.

I made this today,I omitted the cucumber & the green pepper because I didn't have any, so I used a red bell pepper instead It's a dreary rainy day and I didn't feel up to going out, I also added carrots, and chopped celery.It was really good,I will be making this again,This was a refreshing change I was growing tired of that mayonnaise dressing.

Light, crunchy and delicious! Followed recipe, using 12 oz of shredded cabbage with carrots and swapped Splenda for sugar. Dressing was perfect for this amount of ingredients. Marinated for 6 hours and it was excellent! Hubby thinks it would be great served on fish tacos..maybe I'll try that next time!

Recipe Group Selection:  21, June 2014 ~ Great slaw!  I added the optional green pepper and used apple cider vinegar rather than white vinegar.  Mine marinated for about 4 hours before dinner.  It was delicious and we both loved it.  I had a 16 oz. bag of slaw and measured out the 10 oz.  After having dinner, there was enough dressing left with the remaining slaw that I added the last 6 oz. of cabbage.  Served this with 'Cheddar Bacon Hamburger with Horseradish' and 'Awesome Red Pepper Hummus Dip' both from AR and fresh veggies and fruit.

I first made it with half the sugar and then made it with a third of the called-for amount of sugar and loved it!  I had to drain it before serving and again before storing any leftovers.

6.28.18  Knowing our personal taste, I cut the sugar in half, (actually used Truvia®), otherwise, followed the recipe.  This was quick and easy to make.  I love the fact that it’s one of those dishes that you can make early in the day and put in the fridge, making dinner prep easier, keeping me out of the kitchen during summer.

This was a huge hit at our family picnic! I used a popular sugar substitute instead of sugar and no one knew till I told them. Even my picky teenage daughter went back for seconds - this recipe is a keeper!

The sugar caramalized so I assume that means I didn't stir enough. Or maybe didn't cook it long enough.  I strained it out, poured the dressing, and then stirred in 4 packets of splenda. Turned out alright.

This summer slaw is delicious! It has a sweet and sour taste, and is super easy too make! I added a bit less sugar then the recipe says, and a few adjustments on the vegetables. To add some more color to the slaw, add red peppers, and purple cabbage. Otherwise, everyone enjoyed this summer slaw!

I followed recipe, but added a can of mandarin oranges and reserved half the juice to extend the dressing.  I also added about 1/4 t of red chili pepper to give a slight kick.  The crowd loved it!  Fresh and light and crisp.

Loved this!!!  The only thing I changed was I didn't put the green pepper in it but used shredded carrots instead.  My husband is picky and even he liked it!

This was my first slaw and it blew me away! Super easy to throw together and the flavors were awesome. Some reviewers said it was too sweet but I think it's the perfect amount of sweet.

This was so good.  Like carolina coleslaw twisted.  Used xylitol instead of sugar and peanut oil instead of vegetable to make it healthy but very good.
