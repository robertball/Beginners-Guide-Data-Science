I made these for my sons multi-cultural lunch at school. All the kids loved them, and they were very easy to make. Lightly crisp and sweet on the outside, and warm and soft on the inside. I did add a little extra cinnamon and sugar  before I folded in the egg whites, because I thought the dough should be sweeter.

Brought these to a Polish night at a friend's.  They were basically fried dough with potatoes.  Everyone liked them, but they seemed a bit heavy to me.  I did as the other reviewer suggested and added more sugar (a lot).  Never having these before I would say they were okay.
