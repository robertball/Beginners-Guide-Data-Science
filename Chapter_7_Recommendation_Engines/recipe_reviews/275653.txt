We loved this and plan to have often. Followed the recipe except used local skinless, boneless  breast cut to bite size pieces. I' m lucky to have a butcher, who weighs out my purchases.

Follow the recipe only tippled ingredients for larger quantity to feed family, unfortunately, did not turn out well, attempted the pressure cook step and my pressure cooker preheated but did not pressurize, then indicated food burning, tried to repeat step and same thing happened. I proceeded to remove the mixture and scrub out the inner pot, I then added more chicken stock, stir in mixture, and proceeded to pressure cook. This finally worked but, broccoli ended up overlooked and the overall dish had a burnt flavor, chalked up as an epic fail.  I have since leaned for pressure cook setting to work, there needs to be at least 1.5 cups of liquid in inner pot, may attempt again as soon  as I can figure out the right consistency for the sauce to be liquid enough for pressure cook setting and still turn out thicker in the end.

I thought this was outstanding. It was just the right balance of tangy, sweet, and spicy. I may time down there red pepper a bit next time for my kiddo, but I thought it was fantastic. I doubled the recipe, and made it in my 8qt IP. It came out perfectly, tender chicken, full bodied sauce. This is a definite keeper!

It was good but I don't think there was enough liquid for my Instant pot I got the "burned food" message. So I took it out of the instant pot and finished in a frying pan.
