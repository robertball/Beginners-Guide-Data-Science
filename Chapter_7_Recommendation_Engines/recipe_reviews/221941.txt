Very good!  I used 2 cups real crab meat, cut the mayo back to 1/2 cup and increased the Monterey Jack cheese to 1 1/2 cups.  I also added 1 - 2 tbsp of chopped jalapeño for a little kick. This has become my favorite crab dip. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Today was the second time I made this, and since it was as well liked (if not more than) as the first, I give it 5*.  My only tweak is purely out of laziness; instead of chopping an onion separately, I used the onion and chive flavored cream cheese spread.  It came in 15.5 oz so I just doubled the recipe, mixing everything in my kitchen aid and baking in a 9x13.  Magnificent!

Nope.  Not a winner here.  Bland.  Needs spice, less mayo and more artichoke.

After reading the reviews, I too chose to go lighter on the mayo and increased the Jack cheese. We enjoyed this very much. If your store carries the grilled artichokes, I recommend those for this dip. They really kicked the flavor up a notch. This one is a keeper!

Excellent! I too cut the mayo to 1/2 cup and used 1-1/2 cups Monterey Jack. I sprinkled white pepper and Beaumonde spice and mixed it in. Topped it with a sprinkle of smoked Paprika before going in the oven.  Next time I will double the crab meat.

I made this dip for the second time. The first time I followed it to a t with the exception of the crab!
Living in the Pacific Northwest I used 1 fresh Dungeness crab, 1/3 cup of Jalapeños half cup mayonnaise and added a half cup of Monterey Jack cheese....
Absolutely amazing!
Took it to a party and everyone raved about it

A waste of time and ingredients.  Crab was totally lost and it was expensive to make and not worth the time or trouble.  I'd give this a zero if I could.  Linda Eckhardt, James Beard Award winning cookbook author

I didn’t have any Monterrey Jack cheese on hand so I used Gruyere. Otherwise no changes. We liked it and I will try it again with the Monterrey Jack cheese.

I made it with artichokes only because of seafood allergy. I doubled the artichokes in the receipt. The dip got rave reviews. I will definitely make it again.

Please do not make this with tasteless imitation crab, imitation is pressed bottom fish.
Use Dungenesse crab. Costco has nice crab.., or use it out of  a can if you have to.
Very nice with real crab.
Thanks

Omg so good! I added extra crab and used Greek Cream Cheese which I found to have way more flavor... probably about 12oz total, left out the onion and used some onion powder, used 1.5 cups pepper jack, and the rest I left the same. Even my 11 yr old said it was amazing!

I didn't have Monterey cheese, so I used triple cheddar. Also I had parmesan romano cheese. It was very easy & very tasty. I ate it w/ homemade pita chips

I made mine with 1 cup mayo, 1 tub fresh Parmesan, 1 can artichoke bottoms, 2 cans crab meat, 1 can green chilies and 1 can chopped olives. Bake 20 min and then broil to desired browness. Enjoy! Cuz we sure did! Make sure it's  artichoke bottoms, gives it more substance

I liked it a lot and my boys loved it.  Like a couple of reviews suggested, went lighter on the mayo (3/4 cup), and used 1 1/2 cups cheese (Jack/cheddar blend cuz that's what I had).   Good and artichoke-y as described, which was nice.
