Well this is a fantastic recipie.  I tried it for Thanksgiving dinner and it really made the house smell good while cooking.  I must really have a slow oven, because, for me, a 12 lb. turkey at 325 degrees, well it did not get done in the time specified. The breast was done; it came to 175 degrees and the red button popped out, but the legs and bottom were still pink and raw.  Which was embarrasing because I had my new daughter in law at the dinner.

Sorry McCormick - I used other brands of seasonings which were in my cupboard! Otherwise a great rub recipe for turkey. Definitely a tad salty, next time I would decrease the salt by about 1/2 to 2/3 the amound listed. Thanks!

The turkey turned out very flavorful but I will only use 1/2 to 3/4 of the seasoning next time as it was a little too seasoned for me.  I have recommended this recipe to others to try this year as the family did enjoy the test turkey that I did last weekend.

Picked up a Honeysuckle Young Turkey on the day before Thanksgiving--looked for 12 pounds, but they only had 14 pounds or larger, so I got a 14.7 pound turkey. These turkeys were only 47 cents a pound, so you couldn't beat that deal. However, pulled the turkey out Thanksgiving, and the inside was still partially frozen. Ran under hot water for an hour and 15 minutes, and then was finally able to remove the neck and the giblets.

Wanted to try a new recipe for the turkey this year, so I went with this. I followed the direction exactly, except I don't own a roaster. I cooked this in a regular baking pan. I also didn't really baste this turkey during the cooking process either. Cooked 1 hour with foil loosely covered, and then 2 and a half hours exactly with the foil off.

I admit I was honestly surprised at how moist, beautiful and delicious my turkey turned out! The spices are just perfect, but I didn't use all McCormick. I only used McCormick for the few spices I had to go out and buy to make this.

After fully carving the turkey, I simply put the juices and misc. through a strainer, and nothing was stuck or remained in the pan.

If you are looking for a new way to cook a turkey, I suggest this! It makes a very well-seasoned, beautiful, moist turkey that everyone will enjoy, and the even better part: clean up is a breeze! You can't go wrong with this.

This Recipe is Fantastic!! I modified it a little by mixing the herbs with enough olive oil to make it the consistency of paint, then I "painted" my turkey inside and out with the mixture. I stuffed by turkey with stuffing (I use a sausage and bacon stuffing) and baked it in an oven bag per the directions on the box. I has turned out beautifully for the last two years! Even my 95 year old grandmother says that this is the best turkey she has ever had!!

I didn't use all McCormick brand seasonings (sorry), but it  was delicious! This was my first turkey, and I didn't really know what I was doing, but I was so pleased with the results!  I had a 16lb turkey, but I only used about 3/4 of the seasoning, and it was perfect. Thank you for helping me make my first Thanksgiving a success!

The bird was definitely flavorful, but almost too much so.  Not sure if it was the bay leaves or what.  It was good, just very strong.  We added an apple and a couple carrots to the onions and bay leaves stuffed in the turkey and apple juice/water with a touch of honey instead of plain water in the pan. The gravy came out really good.

This rub is delicious and very easy to do. It provides just the right amount of seasoning. i did not find it overpowering at all. I substituted poultry seasoning for the sage. I will definitely come back to this whenever I roast poultry.

Family LOVED it. Best so far. I used butter instead of oil tho. I put the butter and seasoning mixture under the skin too. I didn't use all of the seasoning mixture either. It would have been too much for me and my family's taste. To make this extremely juicy, right before the 30 minute resting period, I took a meat marinade injector and injected the pan drippings directly into the meat. So yummy.

This turkey is amazing and have made it with a slight change in the recipe. We found that f you do not use the nutmeg, it is better tasting (just not to our liking).

It may not look appetizing while basting, but it turns eventually turns to a beautiful golden brown.

I followed the recipe pretty closely. In the spice rub, I used sweet smoked paprika, which I would highly recommend. My 12.5 lb. turkey took 2 hours and 45 minutes to cook,

Delicious. The only thing that I added was placing several pats of butter under the  skin prior to cooking. Meat was very flavorful. The skin was crispy and the meat was very  juicy.This  will definitely be my standing turkey recipe!!!
