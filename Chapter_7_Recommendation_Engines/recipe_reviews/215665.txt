I'm Egyptian, &foul modammas is authentically Egyptian. That recipe is overwhelming &I can make 3 different recipes from those ingredients! Your Syrian friend might have made that up, it's ok but it shouldn't be called foul modammas!
if u like the ingredients of this recipe, just mash the beans up with a fork before adding the rest of ingredients. NO Blender!
1*Egyptian foul modammas is simply mashing the contents of the can (with or w/out its liquid, depending on preference) mash it lightly with adding lemon juice, olive oil, cumin, little dry coriander, salt &pepper.
2*Another dish u do the same with adding some tahini (that's the Alexandrian version).
3*another version add cucumber, onion &tomato chopped very small &mixed.
 all the above 3 recipes are served in room temperature.
4*another dish served warm is sautee in a Tbsp of oil 2 cloves of garlic splash with diced tomato then add the beans &the same spices but no lemon!(this one is called foul bel ta'aleya)
In our mums group we are 6 nationalities & they all love it with all the different recipes!
you can also serve it beside eggs for a filling brunch!

I'm watching an Ethiopian woman smashing the competition in the 10,000 meter race in the Olympics, London 2012! About this Foul Mudammas.  I really like  what I got with the changes I made. All Favas, no garbanzos, no water, 15 oz can tomato sauce, double the tahini and cumin. Excellent.

This tastes good, but it looks just awful. I think the color is just really bad. My blender couldn't process the whole amount at once, so I had to divide it and blend separately. I never got it to a super smooth consistency.

Very good recipe. Real close to the recipe I received from the Lebanese Grocery Store Owner. Except she used double the garlic, extra lemon juice, pinch of salt and chopped parsley. My go to breakfast on some sprouted whole grain toast.

This tastes sooo good. Yes, it looks kind of gross, but that is just due to the ingredients. It really tastes great.
