My 8-year-old daughter was highly suspicious when I said the lasagna would be vegetarion this time. She ended up devouring two big portions and said she didn't miss the meet one bit! I used Ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese and it was delicious!

Great recipe... a couple of things I changed I doubled the noodles and cheese mixture. And when the last 15 minute cooking session I sprinkled parmesan and mozzarella. On top! Perfection!

I admit to being nervous about using uncooked noodles but they turned out perfect!  Only change I made was substituting half the cottage cheese with ricotta simply because I ran out of cottage cheese :)  Awesome recipe!

Awesome recipe. I used a full onion and added quite a bit more garlic. I used ricotta in place of the cottage cheese, and omitted the parsley out of personal preference. I was concerned that the noodles would be undercooked, so I boiled them just until soft. I used only about 1/2 cup water in the sauce because I had precooked the noodles. I used a 26-oz can of garlic and herb tomato sauce and found there was more than enough sauce. My picky sister (NOT a fan of vegetables) even loved this and had seconds. A good way to disguise vegetables.

Made Gluten Free by substituting sauce for GF Wegman's Brand (But I'm sure whatever you like GF works) and pasta noodles (GF Tinkyada Noodles) Left out water and also used Ricotta instead of cottage cheese. Awesome! Awesome!

This recipe is very simple and always a big hit among whichever crowd I serve it too. Since I've made 20+ times now I thought it deserved a review. The only adjustment I make is that I add half of a green pepper and a zucchini, just to bulk up the vegetable count. There's no need to add any additional broth or sauce to compensate for the veggies either. But that's just personal preference and taste great without them.. The only reason I rated it a 4 instead of 5 star was that sometimes I feel like I have too much to fit in a regular sized lasagna pan (without my add-ins). This one can get a little messy when it boils over so I always but a cookie sheet underneath to catch the drippings. Great recipe and worth a little extra mess!

Thought this was an easy lasagna to make and tasty.  Followed the recipe but finished with a coating of Parmesan.
