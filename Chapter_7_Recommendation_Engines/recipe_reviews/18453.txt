Hello All: I added one large egg and 3/4 cup of cornmeal. It made it easier to control the patties. I put them on a cookie sheet using parchment paper, then I sprayed a little pam on each pattie. I baked them on 350 for about 30 minutes they came out wonderful and I cut the fat.

This is delicious. I used canned black beans and needed to add some bread crumbs in order to roll into balls.  I put them in a tortilla with some tomato and sour cream and had as a main dish.

These were good. For those of you whose cakes fell apart, your oil probably wasn't hot enough. Tip: when you think the oil is heated in the skillet, toss in a pinch of flour, if it sizzles, then it's ready.

I don't know if it was the canned beans I used or if the recipe's ingredients failed to bind the cakes together. ? They were even too sticky to come off the wax paper (as recipe indicated to press between). They fell apart turning and I did not like the texture much. I think it would have been better if the beans were not mixed until smooth, but instead left a little "chunky". The spices used had a very good flavor and a creamy sauce is an excellent accompaniement to the black bean flavor- but the sauce was quite plain. I made another batch of sauce blending roasted red peppers,  heavy cream and cayenne pepper;liked it much better. I would try again, only to see if dried beans binded better and with a more flavorful sauce. sorry...

The cakes were very tasty, but way to soft. It was very hard to turn them over in the pan. I added 2 tsp of cornmeal to the mix, but next time I'll also add 1 egg.

Really tasty!  I used canned beans and they came out a little soft, but I'll definitely try again!

The taste was good, and the sauce fine.  My patties didn't fall apart, but they didn't really seem to cook, either.  They only formed the most barely perceptible crust, and were still completely soft inside, even though I had them in the pan for nearly 10 minutes.  Not sure what went wrong - the oil should definitely have been hot enough.

When people say these cakes fall apart if you follow the recipe, they must really mean it.  I'm usually good at pattie recipes so I thought I could make them work, but the consistency was wasn't right.

I had black bean cakes for the first time recently. They were so good, I decided to give them a try. This recipe would have been better if they added some sort of "paste" such as cornmeal.

I did not make the sauce for the top so it was vegan. I didnt have fresh cilantro and was excited to try it so i did this. 3/4 cup masked black beans, 1/4 cup chopped onion, 1/2 tbl minced garlic, dash chili pepper, dash cayenne, 1 tsp dried cilantro,and 1/2 tsp cumin. Then i cut prtion in half and made into balls. After that i squished them lightly so it was about 2 inches across and 1 1/2 inches tall. They didnt fall apart this way and they were soooo good! Thank you for this amazing idea. Im going to make them into "meat"balls. Also if you have problems with stickyness its because your beans are too wet. They need to be very drained and dont use canned, those are slimy and gross. Plus its cheaper to do it yourself.

Like others I felt the consistancy was a little too soft so I added some cornmeal to make them easier to handle. I skipped the cilantro, (not a fan)cut back on the cumin and used canned beans. End result was good and it made a nice healthy lunch. Thank you Donna!

Good.  I'll make them again but not amazing.  They are a healthy alternative to beef.  For the record, I didn't fry them though, I baked them.  Maybe that changed the flavor a bit.

Tasty, especially with the sauce. The only thing I wish I'd realized before making this was just how much this recipe would make - in a family of two we have maybe ten dinners' worth of black bean cakes.

This needs the following changes:
1) One large egg + 1/2 cup corn meal to bind
2) One (or two) cloves of minced garlic (KEY!) sauteed with an onion and green pepper until soft . Add it to the mixture for extra flavor and health prior to forming balls.
4) For the topping- forget the yogurt. I mixed Mayo with Chipotle peppers (to taste). So much more flavorful and authentic.

I liked them, but wish I read the reviews and suggestions more carefully.  I did wait until the oil was hot. I used coconut oil, so not sure if that had any effect.  I found that if I cooked them TOO long and in TOO much oil, they fell apart.  When I cooked them briefly and in just enough oil to season that pan, they were more manageable.  I try to avoid corn products, so don't know if I'll try the cornmeal, but perhaps bread crumbs would help. Although keeping them thicker might help too.  

Flavor was great, although, like others, I don't really like cilantro.  I added onion and garlic powder instead.  For the sauce, I used non-fat greek yogurt, unsweetened almond milk and a touch of mayonaise. Instead of cayenne pepper, I used Tastefully Simple's Fiesta Party Dip Mix.  I ate one patty with the sauce and the other I ate as a "burger" on a whole wheat bun.  It worked well for that.  

I'll try this again.

I made them too big, fell apart in the pan, not so good.
