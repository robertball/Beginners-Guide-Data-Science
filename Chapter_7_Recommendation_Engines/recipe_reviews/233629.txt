Made this for an early morning football tailgate and it was a HUGE hit!  Super easy and delicious-I did peel the apples, and I tripled the recipe for our big crowd.  Will definately be making this again soon.

This is a very easy and simple recipe. I used McIntosh apples and found that the end result was dry. Around the last 7 minutes in the oven the apples were still crisp but very dry, so I put in a couple of pats of butter and that seemed to help some. The recipe is very nice. I think you need to use a juicy type of apple though. It isn't too sweet, a good thing for me. The natural flavour of the apple and the nuts stands out. I used sliced almonds and agave syrup in place of the walnuts and maple syrup. Thank you TsKitchen for your recipe.

Super tasty! Mine came out a little dry and more like a crumble but my wife and I absolutely loved the  taste.  To those that are skeptical, try this recipe and if you end up with similar results, youâ€™ll start thinking of ways to improve the consistency. The flavor needs nothing added.

Good but I needed to make a little more topping to cover the apples.

This was a little bland and not sweet at all. I even sprinkled about 1/2 c. of brown sugar over the apples before I put the topping on. If I make it again, I will add more maple syrup and brown sugar over the apples and make a little more traditional topping. I did enjoy the nuttiness, but I felt that the flavor of the apples was overpowered by it.

Not enough sweetness in the topping.  Consider more syrup in the topping.
