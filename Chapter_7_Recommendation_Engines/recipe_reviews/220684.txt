DELICIOUS! I did par boil my potatoes a bit, just so they would cook more evenly, but other than that, followed the recipe exactly. I do think this could use a bit of salt, but that's my personal preference. Great, subtle flavors that blend very well together. This could not be easier...a definite keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)

Best scalloped potatoes we have had.
I didn't have the garlic cream cheese so used a tub of regular low fat cream cheese and garlic powder.
Mixed parmesan and cheddar.
Delicious!

This is now the recipe I will always use for scalloped potatoes. I didn't have the cooking cream, so I used a block of regular cream cheese and 2 teaspoons of garlic mixed together in the food processor. This was not too rich, but just right.

Very tastey! I added a can of cream of celery soup, some onion, and some garlic spice to the milk and cream cheese. I also topped it with grated cheese and cooked it to a golden brown.  So very YUMMY!

I accidentally put the parmasean cheese in with the cream and milk, but no problem.  I also added a little flour, thinly sliced onions, and a little shredded cheddar cheese in each layer.  For the last few minutes I added more cheddar on top.  It was wonderful!  The whole family loved it!

First time I've made scalloped potatoes not in a box!  Super easy for cooks that are learning (like me)! As I'm only cooking for 2, I only needed 1 potato. Thankfully, the app adjusts the serving size. With the help of the commentors,  I was able to play around with the recipe. I didn't have the cream cheese mentioned, so I used what I had. Whipped cream cheese and then added garlic powder. I used a 6 cheese Italian blend, cream of celery soup, and red onion. When I tasted it, all I could do was smile.  DELICIOUS! My bf who has only had scalloped potatoes with cheddar loved it as well.

Don't think I'll ever use a box again.  

Thank You All!

I cook for a fraternity and I made this in a huge batch to go with a steak dinner. The boys went crazy for it and I couldn't believe how simple it was! The only thing I did differently was that I used heavy cream instead of milk and I loaded it with Parmesan. Very creamy potatoes were the result! I will definitely use this for all future batches of scalloped potatoes.

Have to give it one star because... PHILADELPHIA Savory Garlic Cooking Creme Cream Cheese Product is no longer being made! I made it with Philadelphia chive and onion and it was not good. It was really dry, if I had the cooking creme, I'm sure it wouldn't have been as dry, because I remember the cremes being more liquidy.

I followed all the directions and they tasted terrible. It's not worth the ingredients.

Delicious!  I used the chive and herb cream cheese.  Next time Iâ€™m going to try the garlic herb Boursin cheese.   A big hit- a little bit elevated from the usual cheddar potato dish.

Excellent flavor and so easy to make.
Can no longer purchase the cooking creme cream cheese.
I added 1/4 C. milk to flavored cream cheese and beat until smooth.

I made this to accompany my Prime Rib for Christmas dinner! This is a yummy alternative to the standard scalloped potatoes! I didn't have the cooking creme cheese so I just used the regular 8 oz cube. Also at the end I put several healthy scoops of sour cream in on too & just barely mixed it in! Everyone loved it!!

Probably not make again. Thinly-sliced potatoes turned grey and black in color. Taste was ok, not great.

I used regular Philidelphia cream cheese and added  a teaspoon of garlic powder.  I also through in some Greek yogurt added probably more milk.  I also put in sliced onions.  Then baked it on convection setting on my oven.  Is it ever good.  Will make this again.  Thanks.  Also read some of the other comments which helped me tremendously to tweak the recipe.
