I make this recipe all the time with some changes.  First, I cut the chicken into bite sized pieces, then in a bowl I combine all the other ingredients and mix well.  I pour the mixture over the chicken, cover with foil and bake as directed until the rice is done.  It's a simple dish, but if you make it as directed I find that the rice doesn't get cooked and the ingredients don't blend well together.  Made the way I do it, it's a flavorful and simple dinner.

The first time I made this, it tasted fantastic, however the rice on the bottom didn't cook, and the chicken was a little over done.   

The next time I made it, I cut the chicken up into 8 pieces instead of 4, and I mixed in the liquid and rice.  I also mixed in the soup mix.  This time it was cooked perfectly!  I've made this 3 times now, and this time I  didn't have cream of chicken soup, so I substituted cream of broccoli and it was FANTASTIC.  We had no leftovers, and that never happens.

For a very simple, basic dish, this was pretty good.  It reminded me of something my grandmother would make.  I made a few changes.  I used cream of mushroom soup; I added a little more water; I did not use the onion soup mix (seemed that it would be incredibly salty with the onion mix in addition to the soup) and instead used a little dried herbs seasoning mix (basil, garlic, rosemary, thyme, etc) and fresh garlic for more flavor; I added fresh mushrooms; I mixed the water, rice, and soup mix rather than pouring the mixture over the rice; and I used two chicken breasts because that's all I had.  I baked it for an hour, which was probably a little long.  The rice tasted almost like a nice, creamy (easy) risotto.  You could do a lot with this recipe, and I'll keep experimenting with it.

This dish was yummy. I changed a few things though I used chicken flavored rice mixed in cream of mushroom soup instead of cr. of chicken and used 1/2 a package of onion soup mix and used chicken broth instead of water . but you need to mix the rice in w/ the liquid also the soup and I poured it all over the chicken and added cheese the last 15min .Only bake it for 1hour

I made this last night. I changed a few things after I read the other comments and here is what I did. Instead of water I used a can of chicken broth, instead of cream of chicken soup I used a jar of chicken gravy and instead of onion soup I used vegetable soup. I seasoned the chicken with garlic salt, seasoned salt and paprika. It was so good......my 6 year old, my 2 year old and my husband loved it!

Very easy to make. Good flavor. I added a little extra rice, since many stated the rice was too mushy. It came out great. I would recommend cutting up the chicken into smaller pieces so it can absorb more of the flavor. It was a little bland but very tender and juicy.

This was so simple, but yet so good.  I did brown my chicken in butter, jalapenos, onions, garlic, and dill.  Also used chicken broth instead of water.  I will make this again.

I was looking for something a bit different, yet quick and easy, to make for dinner and this was it!  I added some fresh mushrooms to the rice and soup mix and sprinkled the chicken w/ Italian bread crumbs...it was very good!  My husband even enjoyed it!  I'll definately make it again!

My mom made this when I was growing up and now I make it all the time for my family. I have some tips to make it better/change it up a bit. I use bone in chicken breasts and you can use bone in pork chops. Bake at 350 for one hour UNcovered (that way the top gets crispy but the meat stays tender, yummy) and in the last 10 minutes I top with fried onions. Rather than measuring the rice and water, I just use a soup can of cream of celery or mushroom (I think cream of chicken is too rich), a soup can of rice, and a soup can of water. Turns out perfect every time, is easy to remember,and cuts down on cleanup.

Okay ... I don't like it when changes are made and then recipe is rated ... however, my c/r casserole turned out so so so fab that I had to tell you how I did it ...    Follow the basic recipe  Saute green peppers, garlic, and green onions ... add the onion soup (approximately one half) to this mixture ...     In the meantime, (I used round covered casserole dish) ... rice in bottom as per receipe ... chicken breasts on top of rice (cut into smaller pieces ... not bite size ... but perhaps four cuts per breast) ... my breasts were previously seasoned because I season my meat and then freeze it ... so my breasts had great flavor ... then condensed chicken soup mixed with chicken broth (not water) as per recipe ... then put on the sauteed veggies ... then frozen green peas on top ... cover and cook for 1-1/2 hours ... uncover and sprinkle on parmesan cheese ... leave uncovered for maybe ten minutes ...    THere you are ... what a fantastic dish ... really ... and all was PERFECT ... rice perfectly baked as was the chicken ... moist and delish ... nothing was underdone or overdone and the rice had the most fantastic texture ... nor soggy or sticky at all ... good luck ... I know I improvised, but big wow on how it turned out ...

I've tried a similar recipe before but the rice always came out soft and parts crunchy. I followed another review who said try it in the crockpot and it came out delicious. I used 1 1/2 cups of white rice. 1 can of cream of chicken soup and 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, 1 package dry onion soup, 2 cups of water and 4 skinless, boneless chicken breast with rib meat. I put crockpot on low for 6 hours. The only thing I would recommend is to use a crockpot bag or maybe grease the bottom because the rice stuck and was really hard to scrub out of the pot.

This really is a good dish, it just needs a few tweeks to bring it to five stars. First, substitute chicken broth for the water (and really, 1 and 7/8's?? Let's not split hairs and just say 2 cups). Then, cut chicken into bite size pieces, mix all ingredients together in a bowl, then proceed as written by placing in casserole dish, covering and baking. I love this with cream of chicken soup, but it's even better with cream of mushroom soup. Try a variety of 'cream' soups to change it up and make it equally as delicious!

I have found this to be a quick and easy recipe to prepare.  It is also easily adjustable to fit your family's taste.  The recipe doesn't call for peas, but it's easy to see that some families like peas in this casserole.  If you look at some of the other photos, there is one with mixed vegetables and another one with carrots.  If you want peas in the casserole, add them; if you don't, leave them out.  If you like a different cream soup, use it.  It doesn't make any sense to make complaints about the recipe when someone else posts a photo that clearly shows they made some changes/additions to the recipe.  Any recipe on this site can be adjusted to suit your family's preferences.  Thanks for sharing the recipe J. Saunders.

Very Good recipe. However I customized it by using cut up Chicken Quarters-Drumstcks,Thighs seasoned with Pepper,and Chicken rub. I mixed the Cream of Chicken soup with Vegetable Broth and a small amount of Milk. I  minced about a 1/4 Red Onion and added to the soup mix. Stirred in a package of Saffron Yellow Rice. Poured 2/3rds of the mixture in a buttered 9 X 13" Pyrex dish. Arranged the Chicken on top and put about 1 1/2 cups of Frozen Peas around the Chicken and poured the remainder of the soup mixture over all. Baked it for 1 1/2 hrs covered and it was very delicious. My little lady loved it. The Saffron Rice and Red Onion added character to the dish.

I actually just used this recipe as inspiration. To save time I made a sort of deconstructed casserole.  I put 2 lg cans chicken breast, 1 can condensed cream of mushroom soup (+ 1 can water), 1 pkg dry onion soup mix in a skillet and seasoned with my favorite spices.  I let it simmer for about 15-20 minutes, adding a can of peas toward the end and then served over rice.  It was delicious!

I added some veggies to the recipe (1 cup frozen peas, 3 med. carrots cut into 1/4" slices, and 8oz. sliced mushrooms) and used chicken stock instead of water. Greased a 9x13 pan, evenly distibuted the chicken and veggies, and mixed the rest of the ingredients together and poured it over the chicken.
After one hour, the chicken was perfect, but the rice and carrots were still way too hard. After another 1/2 hour, the rice and carrots were fully cooked.
Next time, I will cook all the ingredients EXCEPT for the chicken for 1/2 hour, add the chicken, and finish cooking for one hour. That way, the chicken will come out perfect. (When it cooks for 1.5 hours, it comes out alittle tough/overcooked).

This is a very good base for casserole.  I cut the chicken into bite size pieces and laid them on top of the uncooked rice.  I then sauteed one tablespoon of butter with one clove of garlic with two stalks of finely chopped celery and sliced mushrooms.  I wanted to incorporate more vegetables so I added chopped fresh broccoli on with the chicken then added the sauteed celery, mushroom garlic mixture.  I also mixed the soup, water and half the dried onion soup mix.  Baked for one hour covered, then took out of the oven and topped with a mixture of cheddar and mozzarella and baked for an additional 15 minutes.  Fragrant, delicious, and with a little more effort, this is a delicious dish that will please almost everyone!

This is an awesome versatile recipe as can be read from all the reviews. Some reviewers are truly over the top rating it only 4 stars [or less] because "they" are self proclaimed expert chefs who cannot be bothered with anything less than perfection and it is there way or no way. Use some thought and creativity and this dish, just the way it is presented is 100 % foolproof and delicious!!! Get creative and make it your own and you can improve on the already "5" star rating!!! Go, go, go!!! A+ all the way!!! All I can say is thanks so much J. Saunders!!! The best!!! And WHAH!!! to the reviewer who rated this low because the picture did not match the description! A quick easy meal that is also tasty is always appreciated by most folks who have to work for a living!!!

Awesome recipe and very easy to make especially after coming home from a long day of work. I did make a couple of changes such as, mixing all the ingredients together first before pouring into the dish, then topping off with the chicken. I used cream of mushroom condensed soup instead. Also increased the amount of rice by 1/2 cup and used about 2 1/2 cups of water. I also pre-seasoned the chicken with some garlic powder and added some frozen mixed vegetables. Yummy!!!

I have been making this recipe for 31 years but I add one can of cream of mushroom soup and one can of cream of celery soup with a can of water from each soup, mixed and poured over the one cup of rice.  The dry onion soup mix does not make this casserole salty but rather very tasty.  I also cook it for 2 hours and everything is cooked perfectly.

My Mom taught me how to make this years ago and it has been in our rotation ever since. I often add different veggies also, keep in mind don't go overboard with them, try it a few times with one or two but because of the onion soup mix, the flavors might not mix too well. Our fave mixes are green beans and corn or asparagus and water chesnuts. Although I like this recipe better than my Mom's because it is less time consuming. My Mom would use a whole cut up bone in chicken, thanks for this version!!!

Loved this! I made a few changes to the recipe: replaced cream of chicken with cream of mushroom, use vegetable broth 2 cups & 1/4 cup water, I used a whole chicken cut up, & I changed the recipe servings to 6. I follwed the advise of another reviewed & melted butter in a skillet sauteeed 1 whole onion & lightly browned the chicken in it. I cooked mine 1 hour 15 mins. Prefect. I also served mine with hot sauce for a bit of spice. I will fix this over as we had no left overs.

I make amodified version of this at least once a week.  Here is what I change: 1) substitute a mix of wine and water for the plain water, 2) omit the package of onion soup mix and add a teaspoon of garlic powder 3) about 40 minutes into cooking, remove chicken breasts and taste rice to see if it is done then incorporate a handful of cheddar cheese, replace chicken breats and top everything with a handful of crushed crackers 4) finish baking for about 10 minutes without foil to get a nice crust.  I have also made this using brussel sprouts instead of chicken (pork chops are good here too)and even my teenager ate it (she finished off the pan!)  Thanks for a fantastic recipe :)

My family has been making this for years, except with skinned, bone-in chicken thighs. Try adding a little rosemary for a nice flavor!

Stovetop method (20 minutes).....I love this recipe but did not have the time to wait 1 - 1 1/2 hrs for it to cook so I tried it on the stove and LOVED it!  I cooked the rice as normal.  While rice was cooking I cut up 2 (they were BIG) breasts into bite size pieces, heated approx 2 Tblsp oil in pan and cooked chicken till almost done.  Sprinkled onion soup mix over chicken and stirred it up.  Poured in 1 can of chicken broth (I used this instead of the water) and let cook until chicken  was done.  Put cream of chicken in, stirred it all up, turned down to low for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Once rice finished cooking, scooped some onto a plate and put chicken "gravy" over top.  This will definitely be a recipe we use often!

I've made this recipe a number of times.  What I do to keep the chicken moist is put it on the bottom of the casserole, top with rice and then the soups.  Always turns out great.  Sometimes I cut the chicken breasts up.  When I do that I start the rice and soups, baking them about half way through, then stir in the chicken pieces.  That way they don't get dried out.

Just an historical perspective- this is a recipe from the 1960's; I think it was from the onion soup manufacturers. I remember my mom making it many times. It was called "Chicken on Sunday," because people would tuck it in the oven, go to church, and have dinner done when they returned. Back then, most people didn't worry about salt as much, so add less if you want of the soup. Chicken breasts were somewhat smaller, and it was usually baked close to two hours, to allow time for church to end-- that way you may find the rice and chicken are more "done."

I typically get a little irritated when people rate a recipe high when they've made a lot of changes to it, but honestly, I think that's the beauty of this recipe.  It's so versatile.  I didn't make a lot of changes, but there were a few.  I subbed chicken stock for the water and used healthy choice cream of chicken.  I cut the chicken into bite sized pieces, seasoned it with salt and pepper, and I mixed everything up rather than putting the chicken on top.  I also added broccoli to it and omitted the onion soup mix(didn't have any).  Next time I will up the rice a little bit because it came out mushier than I would like and I will also not salt the chicken, because the soup and stock are already so salty.  I'm only giving this recipe 4 stars, because I don't think it would so good as is.

I'd also like to point out to the people that are complaining about the pictures that those are user added pictures, the person who posted the recipe did not add them.  Some people wanted to add peas, some didn't.

Good recipe. It's easy to prepare and tastes pretty darn good. The rice had a nice creamy texture. I didn't change or add anything because I wanted to keep it as the simple and satisfying meal that it is.

My mom used to make a similar recipe all of the time when I was growing up. Now that I do the cooking, I have made a few adjustments and my fiance loves it! Instead of cream of chicken, I use cream of mushroom soup. I only use half of a package or so of the onion soup mix. I use just a soup can of water. I place the chicken in the bottom of the pan and mix the remaining ingredients together and pour them over the top. I also top it all with swiss cheese and cover with foil, removing the last 10 min to brown the top.

I have made this recipe for years.  I use a can of golden mushroom soup with half a can of water(alot more flavour).  I always add greem pepper and onion.  I find the onion soup mix is too salty.  I don't put rice in it, instead I make mashed potatoes and a side veggie dish. I have also made this in the slow cooker.  Awesome recipe.

This turned out really good!! I used half chicken stock and half water instead of 2 cups of just water. Also used shredded chicken pieces I had from a roasted chicken. And finally, I followed another reviewer's suggestion of mixing all of the ingredients first then pouring it over the rice on the bottom of the pan. I cooked mine in a Pampered Chef Deep Dish Covered Baker...it was fantastic. I recommend stirring halfway through the cooking time to help everything mix up and also to prevent the rice from sticking. Definitely recommend for a quick and yummy dinner!

This is the same recipe my mother has made for decades.  Easy, great comfort food.  I've adapted it to double in the slow cooker.  Use only 3 1/4 cups water otherwise it gets too mushy.  I also make sure to spray the crock pot before adding anything.  I put the rice on the bottom, add about 1 1/2 cups of the water.  Use the rest of the water and mix with the soup mix and canned soup.  Put rinsed/dried chicken on top of the rice and pour the soup mix on top.  Cook on high for 4-6 hours.  It may not look all that appetizing, but it is sure good.

I just finished cooking it (in advance) for tonight. I just tasted it and it's delicious!
I did cook the chicken breast (bone in with skin) 20 minutes in a 400F degree oven, I used Jasmin rice and a can of cheddar cheese and chicken soup and doubled the recipe. Seasoned the chicken with, salt, blakc pepper and onion powder, didn't have the onionsoup package but it turned out great, 1 hr and 20 minutes. I think I'll serve it with a salad and or veggies on the side.

Thank you J Saunders.  My Mom made this all through my chidlhood.  By the time I asked her how to make it, she had Alzheiner's, and couldn't answer.  She called it Chicken Continental, and the only difference is, that she used bone-in chicken, and coated it with flour.  The top came out brown, with a great crust.  Everything else was the same.
Thank you for a much needed "flash back"...great recipe.

Skip the pizza! This is a great, healthy run-to dinner for those 'need something easy' nights. Just switch to Instant brown rice and FF CreamOfChicken (or your preferred soup).   Like other reviewers, I too mixed the rice/soup/water before adding chicken to the top..... and don't skip the Onion soup mix, it makes the dish different than other Chicken & Rice Casseroles. (I also added broccoli the second time, even better!) Very easy and yummy!  Served with the prepackaged Light Caesar salad.  Family loved it!!

My mom used to cook this all the time. Mine was simple. I only cans of cut up chicken breast by Swanson (not whole) I think that's easier since I cook for only me, cream of mushroom, 1 pk onion mix, 1 cup water, and opened a bag of Success Rice (uncooked). Mixed EVERYTHING together and put it in a dish. Cooked for an hour. Next time I'll add the broccoli to the casserole.

Okay.  I hate when people review but have changed the recipe, however, what I did turned out great and husband loved it.  I cooked one cup minute rice, while it was sitting five minutes I cubed two large boneless skinless chicken breasts and browned lightly.  By this time the rice was ready.  I Pammed a two quart casserole.  I mixed the Cream of Chicken soup, 1 pkg dry onion soup mix and one can of water/milk mixture all together.  Then I placed a little of this mixture in the bottom of the casserole, layered in the rice, then placed the chicken on top.  After that I poured the rest of the soup mixture over that.  e chicken. Placed in a 400 degree oven for about 40 minutes.  Served with green beans and it turned out delicious.  Having leftovers tonight.

I have been making this dish for 30 years but my recipie calls for 1 C long grain rice, 2 cans Cream of Chicken soup, 2 1/2-3 cans water, 1 package Lipton Onion Soup mix. Mix all together, add chicken and bake at 350 for 1 1/2 hours. Stir frequently.  Very good and never dry.

This recipe is very tasty and very easy to make.  I used chicken thighs as we prefer dark meat and it was very good and tender.  Great recipe when working all day and needing something quick to put in the oven.

Like many other reviewers, I made this with cream of broccoli soup instead of the cream of chicken, & also cubed the chicken. I mixed the rice (I used brown rice) with the water & soup, poured it over the chicken, then sprinkled the packet of dry onion soup on top. It was delicious! My husband was very impressed, & told me this was one of the best things I've ever made. I had to bake it for about an hour & 15 minutes, so the liquid would be fully absorbed. Thanks for this recipe, I'm definitely making it again!

This is a tasty recipe, however it does not  appeal to the eye. I might make it again one day.

We loved this in our house! Next time, I will dice up the chicken a bit smaller, just for convenience, but it was overall delicious!  I mixed all of the ingredients together and let the rice soak in it while I cut up the chicken pieces, then I seasoned the chicken to my liking (garlic pepper, season salt, basil, and rosemary), then poured the mixture over top.  Covered with tinfoil and cooked for about an hour and fifteen minutes, just so the rice was tender.

I made this without the dry onion soup mix, because i didn't have any.  I used stock instead of water.  I cut up the chicken, as suggested in other reviews.  I added a bit of thyme and garlic and some chopped up onions.  the taste is good, but the rice is very mushy.  not sure if i did something wrong or not.  might try with brown rice next time.

This recipe was very good. I did substitute broccoli for peas (because my kids don't like them), added 1/4 cup white wine and some chopped garlic. Topped with a little parmesan. DELICIOUS and EASY. . Great idea - quick and easy!!!!

I am a grandma and I grew up with my grandma calling this "busy day chicken and rice."  Even then she knew you have to mix at least half of the soup and water with the rice before you put the meat on top and the rest of the soup mixture and the dry onion soup mix on top of that.  Otherwise, as others have stated, the rice on the bottom never completely cooks.  This is my "go to" Sunday dinner that can cook slowly in the oven while I am at church.  I do not like it in the crockpot because that destroys the crunchiness of the onion soup topping.

I loved this recipe! I almost always make them as close as possible, but I didn't have onion soup on hand. I added fresh mushrooms & 1/2 cup chopped onions & baked as directed. The chicken could use a little more browning so I took off the foil and decided to sprinkle some grated cheddar cheese. What a fantastic addition!! My husband raved about this recipe and I agreed, very very tasty!!

All this has going for it is that it's easy.  I have no idea why it's rated so highly.  It's full of salty, processed ingredients.

Based on suggestions from other reviews, I mixed the rice with all the other ingredients first, then I chopped the chicken into bite-size pieces and added about a cup of chopped broccoli as well. Way too salty and all I could smell and taste was the onion soup mix. Not doing this again.  Ever.

It has been so hot in Texas and I did not want to heat up the house by baking this dish so I put it in the slow cooker and was a hit with the family.  I used cream of celery soup and chicken broth instead of water.  Will add more water or chicken broth next time for the slow cooker.

This sounded very appetizing, but I was disappointed. I followed the hints in other's reviews (cutting up chicken, stirring it all together, and baking for only an hour) and It came out bland and dry. I like to tickle my taste buds. This would be a great dish for kids, as it doesn't have a strong flavor. For everyone else, i would still recommend the above changes, and I will suggest a few of my own. Using chicken thighs (the meat won't be so dry). I would add some savory seasonings - garlic, white pepper, maybe some basil and parsley. I would also suggest reducing the chicken or increasing the rice, as it is very heavy on meat.

Recipe was a little salty for my taste. 1/2 pack of dry onion soup mix probably would have made it less salty. Also, I think it taste better with cream of mushroom, but super easy recipe and will make it my own next time around.  Enjoy!

This was one of the family favorites growing up.  I do mine a little different.  I usually use a whole chicken that has been boiled until it falls off the bone. Let cool then shred.  In the past I had mixed remaining ingredients with the chicken then baked for said time.  However, now what I do is pre-cook rice according to pkg instructions then mix all the ingredients then just pop in over until heated thoroughly.

My husband and I really liked this dish.  It's very tasty.  I used Minute Rice and it worked fine.
Update - made it tonight with 1/3 cup of quinoa and 1-1/2 cups of water.  We're trying to cut down on the carbs.  It was absolutely delicious!

Not a huge fan of the soup mixes and condensed soups, so I made this today using just a white sauce from scratch (almost as easy as opening a can), some basil, onion, garlic, salt, pepper, and some chicken broth. Mixed it in the rice, then put in a bunch of chicken. I doubled the recipe because I'm feeding a family of six, and it was a big hit. The rice was especially delicious.

This was delicious with a few tweaks.  I did cut up the chicken into smaller pieces based on some previous reviews.  I seasoned them with salt and pepper and put in the pan first.  Then I mixed all other ingredients together and poured over the chicken.  Baked 1 hour, for the last 10 minutes I put some fresh grated parmesan over and a little bit of paprika which gave it a beautiful color at the end.  Delicious!

I thought this was pretty bland - definitely needed something something else.  And the cook time was way too long - the rice was really mushy.  You could cut the chicken in smaller pieces and it would be done in about 45 minutes.

This is a really versatile recipe.  I tried it as written except I used chicken thighs (w/ bone) since that was the reason I looked up this recipe in the first place.  I added a little of the onion soup mix to the soup/water and combined with the rice, as some others recommended.  Was VERY tasty!  The meat was really moist and the rice was fab.  I'd like to try it with cream of broc next time.  I think I will also salt/pepper/season the meat first as well.  Good stuff!  And so quick and easy to make.

I really enjoyed this casserole; it was easy to prepare, delicious, and very filling.  The only problem I had with it was that some of the rice didn't get cooked thoroughly.  The next time I make this, I plan on stirring the rice and turning the chicken over halfway through the cooking time.  Definitely a keeper!

I made a few minor changes in the preparation of this.  We don't care for the flavor of the dry onion soup mix, too salty and overpowering, so I finely chopped 1/2 an onion and minced 2 cloves of garlic and sauteed it together in a little butter/olive oil.  I used 2 cups of homemade, defatted chicken stock instead of the water, mixed it with the cream of chicken soup, added in the sauteed onion/garlic, and the 1 cup of uncooked rice and stirred all of that together. I sprayed a tiny bit of Pam in the casserole dish.  I cut the boneless skiness breasts into tenders and put them in the casserole first and then poured the soup/rice mixture over that and baked at 350 for 1 hour 15 minutes.  It was perfect!  Added to my recipe box!

Have made this basic recipe for years. Cream of mushroom or celery works fine but I use 2 cans of cream soup and a whole cut up chicken. Also, uncovering for last 15 minutes gives the dish a nice brown. The rice is just wonderful!

A Keeper.  Easy to make and very tasty.  I cut up the chicken in bite size chunks but will try leaving chicken whole next time, I thought the chicken was a little dry and overdone.  I also added fresh mushrooms and added a little shredded cheese on top when it came out of the oven.  Baked for an hour and rice was perfect.

My husband cleaned the plate.  I used chicken tenders, because that is what I had, and seasoned them with salt and pepper before browning them.  I added garlic to the onions and celery 30 seconds before adding the cream soup (which was celery and mushroom with garlic, which is what I had) and chicken stock instead of water. As other reviewers suggested, I used 3/4 cup rice and baked for an hour. It was very good with a nice gravy left over.  My 4 yr old was very happy with it.  It was a bit rich, and next time I think I will see how I can add some vegies to get those in as well.  Thank you!

I started with this recipe but changed it up quite a bit. Here's what I did: preheat oven to 350. Then I cut up my chicken breasts (I used 3), and mixed the cut up chicken with a can of cream of mushroom soup, almost 2 cups of water, garlic powder, Uncle Ben's chicken flavored rice WITH the seasoning packet, and about half a cup of plain white rice (all rice was uncooked). I added the white rice because I thought the mixture looked way too watery. Mixed everything together and baked for 40 minutes (I forgot the foil but it turned out great anyway). Then I sprinkled cheese on top and baked another 4 minutes, and it was PERFECT. We all loved it!

Good, but not much flavor.  Could be the "healthy" cream of chicken soup I used.  Or that I left out the dry onion soup mix and tried spicing it up with my own spices.  Added a couple handful of frozen veggies.  In the future I'd add a little more rice also.

this was a good base for us.  We used the rice, cream of chicken, water, and dry onion soup as written; we added some veggies - carrots, celery, and onion, too.  Instead of chicken breast halves, we put chicken thighs with butter/herbs on top and baked.  Was very good!

The only thing I did different was mix the onion soup mix with the other soup and water. My husband who does not like onion soup mix loved this and was already talking about different ways to make it, great base for other ideas and very easy.

Pretty good dish - followed suggestions of mixing everything together. Used 1 can cream of broccoli and 1/2 can cream of mushroom soup. Ended up a little too thick so poured the rest of the mushroom soup/milk over the top. Will make it again.

This was a good 'throw together' dinner while I was in a pinch. I used pre-cooked chicken that I had and was hoping to cut down on the cooking time. It didnt work that way. I cooked for one hour and the rice was still hard. It probably needed to cook 20+ minutes loner. I added peas to mine at the end. If I make this again, I would probably try the crock pot.

This recipe was delicious! What an easy meal! The only thing I did differently was cut up the chicken into pieces. I also mixed up the onion soup mix with the chicken/rice/water/soup so the chicken would cook in the flavor of the soup mix.

Rice was mushy, chicken was dry, and the onion soup mix was over-powering.  My 2 year old took one bite and refused to eat anymore.  There are better Chicken and Rice recipes out there.

I agree with so many others: increase the rice!  I used 1 1/2 cups and I still think I could have easily gone to 2 cups.  I used Thai rice and, while I liked it, it did not provide that "homey" feeling.  4 chicken breasts, *just* enough.  I also cut these in to bite sized chunks.  I used Knorr dry French Onion Soup mix.  I added sauteed celery and grated carrot.  I think you could EASILY add just about any veg.  Throw a small bag of mixed peas and carrots in there!    This is a good BASIC recipe and is a great jumping off point for experimenting or cleaning out the fridge or freezer.

Quick and delicious!  I used cream of mushroom soup and 1 cup of chicken drippings and 1 cup of water; instead of cream of chicken soup and  2 cups water.  I cut the chicken up into bite sized peices and coated them with half of the dry mushroom and onion soup mix.  Layered the botom with the seasoned chicken, mixed the other ingredients together and poured the mixture on top of the chicken.  Took maybe 10 minutes, tops!  Baked for an hour... It was sooo good.  Especially with a sprinkle of red pepper!

I am not sure what went wrong!  The rice under the chicken didn't get cooked, the chicken was dry and the onion soup was too overpowering.

I have made this about 4 times and it comes out great every time.  My 2 year old loves it and so does my boyfriend.  And I love taking the leftovers to work.  I love the dry doup on top.  It's not the traditional.  Instead of water, I use chicken boullion.

Simple recipe, ingredients that are on hand!  I used arborio rice (that's all I had that wasn't "quick cook" and it turned out great.  I think next time I'll mix at least half the onion soup mix in with the chicken soup/water mixture to give the rice a little spice too.  Enjoy!

I choose this recipe because it looked easy and tasty.  My family hated it.  I left it in the oven for almost two hours and the rice was not cooked, it was bland and looked awful.

This recipe was as good as it was easy to make. I did change a few things though. Instead of water I used two cups chicken broth and  added 1 extra cup of rice as I found it too mushy. I also put seasoned salt and paprika on the chicken to give it extra flavor. I shortened the cooking time to 1 1\4 hour and put fresh broccoli in for the last 15 minutes. Some canned onion rings on top and it was a real winner in our family!

Awesome and easy.  Made half the recipe in a 8x8 dish with some leftover rotisserie chicken.  Used one can of cream of mushroom soup, one cup of rice, and one cup of water. I did not use onion soup mix.  I added some frozen broccoli and sprinkle or rosemary, thyme, and basil.  I mixed everything together before baking for just under 39 min at 350 degrees.

Easy and quick.  I only used 1/2 onion soup pack & 3/4 can cream of mushroom soup.   Sauteed onions, peppers and mushrooms, added chicken to brown, then added liquids and brought to boil.  I then put in oven at 375 for 50 minutes.  Give it a try.

This was outstanding! I did not have the onion soup mix in hand so I used Lipton Savory Garlic and Herb soup mix instead. Instead of water I used white wine. After reading reviews, I combinded the rice with the soups and wine, then placed the chicken in the dish. I cooked it at 375 and it was done in an hour.

Ingredients are reminiscent of the Campbell's recipe for the chicken and rice bake. Used a crock pot on low, mixed liquids and rice together and placed chicken on top. While I like the flavor the onion soup mix gives the dish, the rice was absolute mush. The chicken was fine. Nothing special. I'll go back to the Campbell's recipe and bake in the oven.

I've been fixing this for at least 45 years. My 'Chicken Rice Supreme' recipe calls for a whole chicken baked at 325 for 1 1/2 hours. I do add another can of soup sometimes & always add water as it is needed. I sometimes double the rice, add a can of chicken broth & let it sit overnight to absorb the broth & soup. I don't think you can ruin this. The broccoli addition sounds scrumptious & I will be trying that.

I cook this and I add Chicken soup and mushroom soup.  I keep adding a little water to make sure the rice if cooked and moist.  When it is done I add brocoli and cheese on top and bake until browned.  It is yummy....

This recipe brought tears to my eyes.  It was my late daughter's favorite chicken casserole.  As a working mom, it was easy for either her, or myself, to get together after work. It's easily tweeked to make it something your family will enjoy.

The recipe was very plain with hardly any flavor. We all ate it, didn't taste horrible, but was nothing exciting. If you have picky eaters this may be great for your family.

Compared to other quick chicken casserole, this one is my favorite!  Lots of flavor!  The combo of cream of chix & onion soup mix makes the dish a little too salty.  I would def try again with reduced salt cream of chix.  I added 1/2 a bag of frozen peas & carrots.  This dish was delish! Very quick & easy!

First time making it EXACTLY according to recipe: 4 stars (really, 3.5). I put it in the croc pot 6 hrs & it came out a little bland & rice came out a bit mushy. When you're in a hurry & you need something fast, easy, & tastes good, this will be wonderful. I'm going to re-review after making this again (it IS worth making again!) with some changes like adding a couple cloves of garlic or some herbs, also put croc pot on low next time!

This dish had a lot of flavor but in my case, the onion soup over powered the whole dish. It was still edible though.   I followed the recipe exactly - no additions/omissions and my rice cooked as it should have. I have made several of these types of chicken casseroles and my rice always cooks this same way so I don't know what to say to help those who's rice won't cook. Sorry.  If I make it again, I will either omit or decrease the amount of onion soup mix and add some frozen vegetables.

I made this for last nights dinner and it was incredible. DH and kids loved it, even I went back for a second helping of the rice. I did think the soup mix would have been to salty. I subbed 1/2 TBL sp Garlic salt, 1 tsp celery salt, 2 tsp onion powder. and since i doubled the recipe i used 1 can cm of mushroom & 1 can roasted garlic crm mushroom. also added 1/2 tsp tarragon on top before baking, salt and pepper to taste.  Excellent recipe, thanks for sharing. Oh, and Hubby says thanks too. He is not a big chicken fan, but this could convert him. :)

This was really easy and also very good!  After reading through the reviews I used some of the suggestions.  I seasoned my chicken with garlic powder, pepper and seasoned salt.  I placed some frozen broccoli around the chicken in the pan.  I used cream of broccoli soup and Uncle Ben's brown rice and mixed those together with the dry onion soup and milk and poured this over everything.  Excellent!!

This was really salty, and I wish I'd added more rice.  Definitely not a hit with my family, but with a few alterations, may not be too bad.

This is a very simple but delicious recipe.  Instead of chicken breast I used leftover chicken from a whole chicken.  The meat didn't dry out.  I wish I had stirred the onion soup mix in with the water and condensed soup....I will definitely make this again with leftover chicken or turkey meat.

It's always hard to rate a recipe that you don't make per the directions, however, based on flavor and family acceptance, I feel comfortable giving this recipe 4 stars. I'm sure made per the instructions, it would be fine.

HOWEVER, like several other reviewers, I tinkered with the ingredients and preparation, but not the baking time. I increased the rice to 1-1/4 cups; used lower fat/lower sodium cream of chicken and cream of celery soup (Campbell's Healthy Request) and used the lowest sodium dry onion soup I could find. I cut the chicken into chunks and combined all of it together.  I added a little Italian Seasoning blend, some chopped parsley and chopped red bell pepper for color.  

Poured into a 13x9-inch pan with that had been sprayed with no-stick spray and covered tightly with foil. Baked at 350F for about 90 minutes. I stirred halfway through (not sure this was necessary). Served to my son, daugther-in-law and their 1 year old and everyone ate well.

Served with mixed vegetable and whole grain bread.  There isn't a lot of color to the casserole, so a colorful side dish helps appearance on the plate. 

We are having the planned leftovers tonight with the leftover mixed vegetables stirred in.

Was looking for something to throw together for dinner tonight.  Not much in the pantry so this looked nice and easy.  Cut up the chicken as another reviewer suggested.  Then mixed together Cream of Mushroom soup, water, rice and dried onions (didn't have onion soup).  Poured that over the chicken and stuck it in the oven.  About an hour later I stirred in some frozen veggies and baked another 20 minutes uncovered.  Boyfriend went back for seconds so it couldn't have been too bad!  Chicken was moist.  Will play with it again.

Pretty simple recipe, but really good! I love when you can make something that is really good and be made out of so little ingredients. Family really loved it. The only thing I added was shredded Cheddar cheese after I took it out of the oven. (covered dish back with foil for a few minutes to let the cheese melt.)

I've got to give it 5 stars because it was so easy, a 5-year old could have made it! It was also very (and surprisingly) tasty!  I followed the directions exactly as written and honestly didn't expect much, but I was pressed for time. My husband and 9-year old son loved it, which was great because my son pretty much hates anything that I cook. The only suggestion I would make is if you follow the directions exactly, make sure you use thicker chicken breasts. I used relatively thin chicken breasts and baked it for 1 hour, and they were a bit dry, but the rice was absolutely perfect. I also loved the "browning" that occurs on top of the chicken breasts from the soup mix. I will definitely make this again!

Very good, rice came out firm and the chicken moist. I added chicken broth and white wine  in lieu of the water. I will definitely make this again as it was easy to make.

I really like this versatile recipe.  I, of course, changed a few things in the basic recipe.  First of all, I used 1 ½ cups of rice.  Then I added 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of chicken soup to 2 ½ cups of water.  I followed the recipe from there.  After baking for one hour, the chicken was done but not the rice so I stirred the rice, soups, and onion soup mix together and put it back in the oven for another ½ hour.  Ten minutes before it’s time was up, I added some fried onions to the top of everything and took the foil off for the remainder of the time.  The chicken was very slightly tough but the rice was perfectly flavored and moist.  We loved it!  My husband likes sharp cheddar so he added some to his chicken and rice mixture.  Next time I think I’ll add some mixed veggies and see what happens.  All in all, a VERY easy recipe that tastes quite good and you can pretty much work it any way you like to suit your own personal tastes.  This is the type of recipe that is impossible to botch so have fun with it and be as creative as you want!

After reading other reviewers suggestions, I was afraid the recipe would be bland. I used lipton's rice medley to give more flavor (and veggies), and used cream of mushroom soup with milk as someone else suggested.  I mixed the rice with the soup before cooking.  In the end, both my husband and I enjoyed this recipe, and I found it to be extremely easy to make.  I'm only giving it a four because I did not follow it exactly... but what I did follow, I will make again!

This recipe was great, really simple to make, but didn't taste like it was from a box. I made a few changes, as suggested by previous reviewers. I used some milk instead of some of the water. I also chopped fresh garlic  and sliced fresh mushroom. At the end (for the last minute), I added about 2 cups of fresh baby spinach which wilted nicely into the rice.

Very good recipe. I substituted milk 1 1/2 C for the water and used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken. 
I also added an extra 1/2 C of rice and a can of mushrooms. I would definately make it again! Enjoy.

I've been making this for yrs as well... rice too dry? secret is good skin drippings from the chicken. Also try adding a sm. container of sourcream or chunk of velveeta below your chicken pieces! Yum!

Oh My Lord - this recipe was sooooo easy to make and it was delicious.  I didn't have all the proper ingredients, so I improvised a bit.  I used bone in chicken breast instead of boneless.  I didn't have cream of chicken soup so I used cream of celery and added chicken bullion to it.  Don't try to substitute for the onion soup mix (I didn't) because it is an important part of the flavors.  It took about an hour and five minutes to cook, it was just too easy to taste this good.  This one is a keeper for my family.

I make this for my family every couple of weeks.  It's easy and very flavourful.  I use cream of cheddar cheese soup, only half a package of onion soup mix, and chicken broth instead of water. I mix the cheddar soup, chicken broth and onion soup mix, with parsley and half of a chopped onion and set aside.  Sprinkle lemon pepper seasoning over the cubed chicken and put that in the pan first, then the rice, then pour the soup mixture over top.  Finally I add some frozen corn and peas.  Cover tightly with foil and stir halfway through- cooking for 45-60 mins.  A delicious easy meal every time!

This was good. A classic casserole. I added chopped broccoli & it was a complete meal. I think the rice was a little mushy for my taste but the flavor was good, needless to say the casserole dish was empty!

My family loved it! My finicky 11 year old loves rice based dishes so when he went for seconds I knew it was good. Easy one dish. I will next time add a little more liquid or as someone else said in review mix the rice in with the soup and water mixture because my rice began to over cook on the bottom. YUMMY! I served with mixed vegetables.

I followed the advice of others by cutting the chicken to pieces first. Then mix all over ingredients together and pour on top of the chicken. I baked on 350 for 1hr 20mins. Delish!

First, the recipe is not clear about the rice. If one uses  quick cooking rice it becomes mush. Original rice does not cook completely in the cooking time given. I ended up having to cook the dish for two hours and that made the chicken WAY overdone. It doesn't look very good, either. The end result is a brown, soupy mess with barely cooked rice and dry chicken.  Not a recipe that my family likes. Oh well, can't win 'em all!

I also make this with a few changes.  I use cream of celery soup and dry onion and mushroom soup mix instead.  I also chop a medium onion into the mixture.   I mix all of this with 1 soup can of water and 1 soup can of milk.  Mix it all til well blended. I put this in the casserole dish first then add the rice then the chicken.  I also use chicken tenders instead of breasts.   Also add salt and pepper to taste.  Always comes out yummy.   Maybe should have submitted a whole new recipe.  lol

This was very good.  Sure it would be good unchanged.  However, I am one of the people that made a few changes ... nothing major.   Used Golden Mushroom soup and added frozen peas & carrots.  Cut meat up in chunks and seasoned with pepper & Garlic powder.  I mixed all, except chicken, in one bowl and then put in casserole dish and then added the chicken on top.  Then "sunk" the chicken in the liquid.  Cover tight so rice will cook.  Took good 1 1/2 hour.  Think would come out just as good using instant rice and looking less time....just till chicken cooked.

I clicked on this recipe looking for something new, but found the same recipe that I have been using for over 35 years that I vary by adding vegetables in season. Additionally, I always precook the chicken slightly since I found it too greasy. When you are cost cutting, the use of chicken breast in this recipe is not an option when raising a family on little money so using the bone in cuts of chicken adds grease. Another trick is that I always cook meat frozen. I just add a half hour to the cooking time and the meat is much more tender. Now that we have moved to Florida, we are having a hard time with finding good quality meat. A big difference from NY so this tip is needed.

I didn't have all of the ingredients it called for and made it my own and it was DELICIOUS. I mixed all of the ingredients in the baking dish i was using, added the rice and them mixed chicken into it.  Seasoned chicken with Johnny's seasoning salt (similar to Lowry's) used cream of mushroom, added peas, cut the chicken into bite size pieces and topped it off with sour cream after serving. EVERYONE LOVED IT!

The original recipe I had was 1 stick of butter melted in the bottom of the casserole dish, 1 cup of uncooked rice, 2 cups of milk, 1 can cream of mushroom soup, 1 pkg. dry onion soup mix and four chiclen breasts  - bone in and skin on.

Pour rice over the melted butter, mix soup and milk together - lay chicken skin side down on top of the rice, pour the soup mixture over that and sprinkle the onion soup mix on top.  Add any veggies you may like.  Bake 325 for 2 hrs which should cook the rice.

I only use about half of the onion soup mix due to saltiness. If want more soup mix type onion, I can add dried or dehydrated onion that is found on the spice aisle. To Alymade, if you take all the seasoning (soup mix) away, bland is what you get. So, don't blame the recipe.

Have used this recipe many times.  Use brown rice to add fiber just cook a little longer.  My original recipe does not call for pease either but when added makes a nice compliment.

Adding veggies is a wonderful idea. I added celery and carrots. Corn and potatoes wld be good too. I will not be remaking this dish because it's very Salty. However, the cooking time/temp was very accurate.

So easy and had everything in my cabinets.  Looked up the ingredients I wanted to use-put this together in about 5 minutes and threw it in the oven.  I used SAVORY GARLIC AND HERB dry soup mix (not the whole package though) and it was wonderful.  Good dish for a cold rainy night.

Very good.  I used uncooked white rice (like the rceipe calls for) & 3 huge chicken breast.  Didn't have cream of chicken soup so I used cream of mushroom.  Mixed the onion soup mix withe can of mushroom soup & one can of water & a little poultry seasing & salt & pepper in a bowl.  Put everything in a 7" x 11" pyrex pan, covered tightly with aluminum foil & cooked for one hour ten minutes.  The rice was delicious & I will make this again, next time with cream of chicken soup.  Thanks for sharing.

I just made this, however like everyone else, I made some changes. I cut the chicken into cubes and boiled it in water. I combined 1/2 an onion, 1_1/4 cups of minute rice, a can of mix veggies, cream of chicken, water and a bunch of spices (basil, oregano, curry powder, celery salt, cumin). I mixed in the chicken when it was done cooking. I put tin foil over top and cooked it at 350 for 20 minutes. When it was done I sprinkled cheddar cheese on it. And served it when the cheese had melted.  It was delicious! I will make this again and again.

My rice didn't come out - some of it was hard - edible but not good.  And I followed others advice and mixed up the ingredients.  Perhaps I should have cooked 1.5 hrs instead of 1, but the chicken was done already.

I made this recipe using leftover turkey from Thanksgiving.  I shredded up some of the breast and thigh meat, combined all ingredients to include some frozen vegetables and baked it for about an hour and 15 minutes.  Easy and delicious.

SO GOOD!  Super easy!  I will never not have onion soup packets on hand again, because this would be a great thing to throw together in a pinch and all other ingredients are pretty regular tenants in my pantry/freezer  :)

I followed this pretty much exactly and cooked in a slow cooker. It smelled heavenly, but it was just mediocre as far as flavor. Probably won't make it again.

Well, I did tweak it a bit...I used Cream of Mushroom soup instead of chicken soup and I used chicken broth instead of water...but I was blown away with the taste and how easy it was to make!  Instead of plain rice, I used a package of chicken flavored rice mix (it had lots of great seasoning, which meant I didn't have to use a lot of salt and pepper), and I added a little Lawry's and black pepper.  I also added mixed veggies to it and did as other reviewers suggested, mixed the rice with the other ingredients with the rice and poured it over the chicken (and I used chicken tenderloins cut into bite-sized pieces).  I just loved it and my hubby and I each ate two big plates full!  There's enough for tomorrow's lunch, too!  Thanks for the dish!!  By the way, I only used a very little of the onion soup mix and I sprinkled it on top.

Love this receipe.  I put 2 cups rice and replaced water with 2 cups milk.  Mixed half of liquid with rice then placed chicken on top season with salt, pepper and Lawrys perfect blend chicken and poultry seasoning and rub to taste.  Then poured remaining half of liquid over chicken then sprinkled oinon soup.  Served with steamed veggies.

Following some of the other reviews, I combined rice, water, and soup first, added frozen/thawed broccoli, then chicken tenders and onion soup mix. Cooked for 1 hour. The whole family liked it!

I followed this recipe almost to the T, except I substituted cream of mushroom for cream of chicken and added some fresh sauteed mushrooms as well as adding some basic spices (salt, pepper, ital. seasoning) to the chicken.  The taste when it was done was pretty good, the boyfriend said he liked it.  The texture, however, was not good.  The rice was mushy and the whole thing looked muddy.  Overall, not something I will try again--tasted too much like something I've had in church basements time and again.

I would give this 4 1/2 stars if I could...not the most amazing thing I've ever eaten, but one of the best casseroles for sure!  I added a can of green beans to give it a little more variety.

I ended up adding a bag of Italian frozen veggies, some herbes de provence (eyeballed it), the whole envelope of onion soup mix. Had to bake it covered for an hour, hardly cooked. Used bnls, skinless chicken thighs. Took foil off, baked another 30-45 min at 325 convection to perfection!!!! Hubby thought it awesome!!!!! said very good!!!! he said it was 5 stars all the way!!!!!

I love this recipe...I think this will become a week night staple in our home. I did add some veggies to it, celery, onion and brocolli and I switched out brown rice for white rice and I used chicken thighs instead of breasts..this is a wonderful dinner, crushed cornflakes on top adds for a nice crunch

Instead of using dry onion soup mix which has 610mg sodium (Lipton), I used a package of Zesty Italian salad dressing mix with only 220mg sodium. That cut the sodium by 390mg!! Otherwise, delicious recipe!

I changed a few things.I used brown rice instead white. Used 1 can cream of mushroom soup, 1 can chicken broth and 1 can of rice. I sauteed a small diced onion, 3 cloves of garlic and a cup of fresh mushrooms for a few minutes. I too combined my liquids with the rice, then added the sauteed veggies to the rice mixture. I used 2 chicken breasts and sliced them into strips. I then laid them on top of the rice.I did not use the onion soup mix, I thought it would be too salty. I sprinkled some mixed herbs on top of the chicken. I also sprinkled some shredded parmesan cheese on top. Baked covered for 45 minutes, then uncovered for  the last 15 minutes.Served with fresh green beans. Easy recipe for a week night supper.

This is a good chicken and rice casserole.  I made it exactly as posted. I agree with the other posters that it would be a great base recipe and you can add the other ingredients that you like.  I will make this recipe again!

It gets points for being easy but it's rather bland as is. Not a bad base recipe, but you'll want to jazz it up.

I tried this out a couple months ago, and it quickly became one of our favorites. It is so easy and delicious. I like to make it with broccoli on the side. I might try some of the modifications suggested to make it even better next time!

This was the first casserole I've ever made. (I'm not much of a fan of cream of mushroom soup, so that kind of narrows the field of casserole recipes). It does smell great baking, and the rice in particular has a very nice texture when it's done (I used "calrose" variety white rice). The onion soup mix is a little strong (and salty) for my tastes; next time I'll probably just throw in some fresh onion. I thought it could use some other seasonings as well-- a little garlic, and any of a number of herbs (basil, or oregano, cilantro, etc.) would add a distinctive flavor. It also definitely needs a vegetable (I would prefer raw, frozen, or steamed over canned) to round out the meal and provide some contrast in flavor and texture, whether added to the casserole, or as a side dish. Good recipe, though. I do plan on making it again and using it as a basis for further experimentation.

Just like it says, Easy & Delicious.  The only thing I changed was I mixed the soup,water and onion mix together and then mixed it with the rice.  The rice came out super moist and seasoned.  I will make this for my husband again.

This is basically a great recipe. I added a second can of cream of chicken and 1 cup of milk in place of the water. Then mixed cream soup, dry onion soup, and 2 cups of shredded cheese with the rice and poured on top of the chicken breast. Rice was perfectly done, and taste was not overpowering. Very nice - even my picky 10 yr old loved it!

I would say this was an OK recipe.  Good for nights when you have to eat and get out the door to an evening engagement.  I can't say I would cook this for company as it's appearance is not impressive.  But for an easy, last minute meal it wasn't bad.

I thought this recipe was yummy yummy with a couple modifications. I mixed the rice with 1 can cream of chicken soup, 2 cans hot water, 1 package dry onion soup and baked 40 minutes. Then I added 1 can drained straw mushrooms and 2 diced chicken breasts that I had left over.  Baked again for 20 minutes until rice was done and chicken hot.  This is a keeper!! Kids loved it.

I wasn't so sure about this with the onion soup packet in the ingredient list. To my surprise, this turned out VERY yummy!!! The chicken was very tender and had a good flavor. And holy cow, was it ever easy!!!!!! The only thing I will probably do next time is add another 1/4 cup or so of rice. Definitely worth a try!!!

This was a very easy dish to fix.  For myself though, I wasn't very fond of this dish.  I cooked it in a crockpot.  One child liked it, the other didn't.

Super easy and full of flavor! I did like others suggested and cut up the chicken as well as mixing all the other ingredients together and pouring on top – only needed to cook for one hour. I will absolutely make this again :-)

I've made a variation of this for 45 years and it's still a family favorite.  I made the basic recipe for years with mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken.   Over the years, I've added these variations.  For the most  flavor, use bone-in chicken thighs and increase cooking time about 20 minutes til the chicken is done. .Our second choice is boneless, skinless thighs, cut into bite-size pieces. Regardless,  always use chicken broth instead of water.  I use minute rice so it's always done.  We really like onion, so i usually add 1/2 sauted onion.  And for  color, we add a small jar of diced pimento.

Too salty.  Probably better if it had vegetables in it.

My kids love this and it's quite difficult to please all of them with one simple dish. I've made it twice and it's definitely going to be a part of our regular rotation. It's so easy and very flavorful. In my case, I've added peas and snap peas to it to sneak in an extra serving of veggies.

Used chicken broth instead of cream of chicken soup and Hidden Valley Creamy Spinach Parmesan instead of onion soup mix.  Very easy and very good!

This is a good base recipe that is easy to build on. I added many ingredients based on the flavors my family likes. Made as is, I'm afraid this recipe would be very bland. Thanks for a great starting point.

I made this at my in laws, which means I didn't have all the correct ingredients and needed to triple the recipe. I also have never loved these kinds of casseroles, since I never seem to get them to turn it well.  My in laws, however, are incredibly easy to please. They eat anything. I'm really not kidding. When I say anything, I mean anything.  I transferred the leftovers to another container and my father in law scraped out the pot. He does that with everything.   Anyway, I had to use a different kind of soup mix, and had to let this bake for about three and a half hours (I tripled it, remember?), and it turned it okay.  The rice was like risotto just as another reviewer noted, and the chicken was good. I also added mixed veggies, which worked well. Thanks for the recipe.

This was very good with cheese on top, broiled for the last 5 minutes of a one hour bake.  Definitely would not have been as tasty without the cheese.

One of my favorite one-dish meals.  Everyone  in the family loves it.   Sometimes I will make my one herb blend for the chicken, and I use the cream of chicken with herbs soup for added flavor.

Am not sure what I did wrong with this recipe. Followed the recipe exactly, except I added veggies and brown rice and cut the chicken into smaller pieces and mixed everything together and poured it over the chicken.. Very, very salty and the rice wasn't cooked all the way and I cooked it for almost  1  3/4 hours... Will try this again but maybe not with the packet of onion soup mix and use  white rice..

May need some paprika or chili powder on the chicken. Frozen veggies, and some noodles would be best to add too; it was a little watery. Instead put in the soup container worth of water. Cook with three chicken breasts for an hour. After, put layer of cheese (recover foil to melt for a few min).

This recipe was so easy to bake and very tasty as well! I cut up the chicken and did not add the onion soup mix as other people suggested. I did add broccoli. It was easy enough for my ten year old to make and the whole family enjoyed it!

this was good, soft creamy chicken rice.  
I seared chicken in garlic first,
cut chicken into quarters, mixed the condense soup with its can of water, the 1 cup of rice  and some seasonings (basil, salt, sugar).
poured mixture over the chicken in casserole dish, added frozen veggies at the end of baking. 
very easy and comforting dish.

I read everyone's reviews carefully before making any recipes. I followed other reviewers recommendations to combine the rice in with the ingredients. Well, it's been in the oven for nearly two hours and it's a soupy mess with uncooked rice. I don't think I'll make this again!

I slow-cooked this recipe and added cans of mushrooms, sliced carrots, and peas. After it had cooked on low for 4 hours, I shredded the chicken breasts and stirred it all to help the chicken absorb flavor. When it finished after 7 hours, it came out like a perfect filling for chicken pot pie.

Made this several times and came out good. Changes I made were Instant Rice works better with this recipe and instead of Onion Soup Mix sometimes instead I use Rotel. Also change the vegetables to Broccoli or Green beans or Corn. Than at the end I add shredded cheese like mild cheddar or Velveeta and without cover bake it 5 min. more till cheese melts.

My family and I really like this receipt, it's super easy to put together and has lots of favor! I put string beans in mine to add a veggie and I'm also going to try next time instead of the onion soup mix to put the french'a onions on top.

Cup up the pieces rather than cooking them whole, I think it turned out much better this way. Chicken still turned out dry but it was ok.

I make a very similar version of this. I sautee some onions and garlic first, then I add two cans of cream of chicken, and roughly the equivalent in milk and I cook my chicken in it on the stove on medium heat. While that's cooking, I make about 2 cups of white rice in my rice cooker. I add seasoning to the sauce to taste. I almost always put cayenne and a few dashes of Worcestershire for my husband. When the chicken is cooked through I shred it in the sauce, and mix the rice in and bam! Done. I love it. My husband hates that I make it so much.

This was really good. I cooked it in the crockpot on high for 3 hours. I did change it a little. I used milk instead of water. I put a can full of rice and a can full of milk. (Soup can) plus half cup of water mixed those all up with the onion packet and put the chicken on top.

I would say this was OK not WOW. I would add next time peas and carrots to give a bit of color and veggies plus a tid bit of salt and freshly ground pepper. It is bland without any veggie touch or without that tiny bit of salt. I do not eat anything salty so I can tell extremes in salt content.

My chicken was finished cooking before the rice.  I had to remove the chicken breasts and continue cooking the rice mixture for an additional 30 minutes and it still wasn't cooked completely.  Next time I will parboil the rice before baking.  I used chicken stock instead of water and used Knorr Vegetable Soup Mix instead of French Onion.  I also added 1/2 a small chopped onion and a can of diced portobella mushrooms. I seasoned the chicken with seasoned salt, garlic and thyme.  Very good flavor.

I didn't care for this.  The rice turned to mush.  I used Minute rice, maybe that was my mistake.  The flavor was good - I added brocolli but to me it just reminded me of cream of chicken soup with rice and brocolli.

yum! I'm new to cooking and this was maybe my 4th recipe I have made. I added extra rice (& liquid of course) because it just didnt seem like enough. I also used milk instead of water which made it very creamy and went well with the soup. I also cut up the chicken since i didnt use a 9x13 (only 2 of us.. i belive it was an 8x8). I'm an idiot and starred at the foil for 45 minutes until i remembered to add it-- which of course made the chicken a little dry but nothing that some gravy can't fix! I also planned to add peas which I forgot.. I'm excited for next time to actually get it right! :D thanks for this recipe! If a beginner can do it, anyone can!

This was really good.  I took the advice of a couple others and used chicken broth instead of water, and I mixed everything together before spreading it in the pan.  The chicken was tender, the rice was cooked all the way through.  Not sure how it reheats but as a good, quick, I-always-have-the-stuff dinner I will be putting it in the rotation.

i tried this recipe because it looked easy and seemed to have a fair amount of positive reviews. However, even after following the suggestions of mixing the rice and soup mix into the water and cutting up the chicken the rice was still undercooked and the chicken bland. The casserole definitely lacked depth and their are a lot better chicken recipes out there.

This recipe is great except for the bland chicken. She did not mention adding seasoning probably since this dish already has a lot of sodium. It was not enough for me. Season your chicken how you like it and then add it on top of the rice. I used cream of chicken and mushroom soup by Campbell's instead. I did as suggested and I cut the chicken up into bite size pieces. The next time I make it I am going to add fresh mushrooms. I love mushrooms DO IT! :)

This recipe didn't turn out well for me!  I think that the rice should be cooked by itself, and then just serve the chicken over it, when it's finished in the oven.

Wanted to increase the nutrition on this, so I used a long/short grain brown rice mix. Also added 1 chicken stock cube in water. Cut 3 chicken breasts into 12 pieces. Used a crock pot for 7 hours on low. Added peas the last hour of cooking. Very, very yummy!

Perhaps the simplest chicken and rice casserole on the planet. The flavors popped just right and the chicken was moist. Only caveat I would have is to spray cooking spray on the bottom of the casserole dish to help with clean up.

However living in the country and been short of some ingredients, we substituted wit packet soup and used some cut leaks with the dish. Thank you for a great treat

I was disappointed. The rice was still hard after 1 and a half hours,  because the foil did not adequately seal it. I will try it again but next time I will bake it in a round glass casserole dish with a glass lid and put foil between the dish and the lid.

This is a good base recipe but unfortunately this was very bland for me. I didn't use the onion soup because I did not have it on hand. I added cheese and combined all the ingredients together to save time. Almost done through cooking I mixed the casserole and decided to taste it; was very bland. So I added more seasonings and cheese and came out much better. This recipe is a good base recipe but not something I would make again unless I tweaked it.

I added about 1/2 c. Diced bacon to mine and also cut my chicken inti cubes. Also i used only 1/2 a can of the soup and add a 3 oz. Block cream cheese. The new cream cheese garlic and herb blends are also a delight.

I made this dish late last night for today's dinner. I followed the recipe as is for the most part with 3 exceptions...I used drumsticks which I lightly seasoned and slightly browned in olive oil and a pat of butter. In addition to that, I also used 1 and a 1/2 cups of saffron rice and cut the onion soup mix down to 1/2 of a pack. As others have said, it is a great base/starter recipe and on that note I rate it a 4. For ease and simplicity I rate it a 5. As for taste I rate it 3.5 stars. The taste was just ok, nothing spectacular to write home about. I'll wait to see if my finicky 8 year old likes it. I will definitely make this again, but I'll tweak it to make it my own. I stumbled across this recipe looking for ideas using cream of chicken soup, chicken, and frozen spinach. I found several recipes and decided to try this one first. Btw, my dish didn't turn out salty, probably because I only used 1/2 a pack of onion soup mix and extra water for the extra rice I added.

I gave this recipe 5 stars because it's SO EASY and very yummy.

Because I didn't want to turn on our oven in Arizona weather, I cut up the chicken and put all the ingredients into a crock pot (minus the rice). 20 minutes before I served the dish, I added 4 cups of  cooked BROWN rice. Delish!!!!

This was a very tasty recipe. I am a married wife with two boys and I work and attend college. I need simplicity everywhere I can find it. I would add if sodium is a concern use low sodium cream of chicken and low sodium onion mix and I sometimes use brown to get the whole grains. I fixed this with lima beans. Awesome!!!

I was prepared to be underwhelmed, but this recipe really was very good.  I did add some frozen peas and carrots, but that was my only change.  You could use any "cream of" soup with this and it would turn out great.  Definitely a keeper.

Only added 1 1/2 cups of water and the consistency was just right.  Was done after 45 minutes.  Usually like onion soup mix with rice but for this one, I think I'd rather leave it out and just add some herbs or something instead.  Nice and easy though, would make again for a quick weeknight meal (sans onion mix).

This is ok.  My kids loved the rice.  I made a few reader suggested changes and combined the liquids with the rice.  I did not cut the chicken into pieces, but if I make it again (probably won't) I would do that.  Overall, I thought the rice was mushy and the chicken had no flavor.  At a very minimum it needed salt and pepper.

I did not care for this recipe at all.  I love chicken and rice but the dry onion soup mix was too much.  Mine tasted so strongly of onions that I could hardly eat it.  Maybe using just half of the package of soup mix would have been better.

Made this last night and i will have to give it mixed reviews. Read all comments ahead of time and planned my variation accordingly. Did in crockpot as one review suggested, used broth instead of water,added cheese, sauteed celery and mushrooms to add in, and put lightly steamed brocolli in at end. Had taken chicken breasts and cut into small tender sized portions.Cooked on low and came home at 4 hours and was running short on liquid and altho it smelled great and chicken was tasty, the rest looked like a goopy mess. Scraped out and put in casserole dish, added broth and brocolli, baked 20 minutes at 325.Put Italian seasoned bread crumbs and more cheese at end of cook time and broiled that off. Will tweak some more or just do in oven at start. Had mixed chicken pieces with other ingredients to start, am puzzled.

Like most I gave it a four only because I had to tweak it to fit my kitchen. I used 2 cups of instant rice, cut up five chicken breast halves (not sure on the weight), and did not use foil. the only reason I left the foil off was because I simply forgot to put it on. Oh, and I sprinkled the top with a little shredded cheddar. I love it!My kids were excited that I actually used chicken, I generally stick to beef (harder to under cook). Thank you do much for giving out this simple bird recipe. New favorite!

This recipe is fantastic, however, I changed this up a bit.  I used 1/2 c. white rice and 1 pk of Uncle Ben's wild rice out the seasoning.  I did not precook just mixed all together.  This recipe needed more crunch so added 1/2 cup toasted almonds. Used 98 percent fat free soups and reduced sodium onion soup mix. I cubed the chicken breasts. This is a great make ahead but cook at 350 for 2hrs.  Great the second day cold.

This dish was a very tasty filling meal however I did not follow the original recipe. Instead I cut my chicken into bite sized pieces, and added sauted celery and onions. Instead of pouring the mixture over the chicken and rice, I mixed the soup, the onions and celery, the dry soup, the water, the rice and the chicken together and poured it into my baking dish. I also found that I need to add more water (almost 2 cups) and that I needed to bake for at least an hour and a half. Other than these minor changes I thought it was good, and I will definately be making it for my family again

Very tasty, But I used mushroom soup, and also added 2 1/2 stalks of celery, 1/2 red onion, 4 tablespoons of finely chopped fresh cilantro. Made one for my cousin to for her to cook up, and she loved it too!!

This was pretty good but it was missing something.I added garlic, onions, parsley, broccoli, bacon, pepper,paprika, and bread crumbs. It came out good but bland. I think it might need some cayenne pepper (not much) to make it better. I'd definitely make this again though.

This is really good! I followed some of the other reviewers' suggestions, putting chicken in the bottom, mixed the rice with the liquid, didn't use soup mix, poured the whole thing on the chicken, sprinkled the top with a some herbs, and baked for 1.5 hours. It was soooooooo good!! Made it for a friend who just gave birth to her daughter. She loved it!!

Bland! I mixed the soups and rice and broth for the water. I cut the chicken breasts in chunks and seasoned it with garlic, onion powder and black pepper.  I baked it for about 1 hour 10 minutes and the bottom was MUSH and the top was DRY. The only thing that had flavor was the chicken, the rice was horrible. My husband choked it down and we laughed about it later, but leftovers went in the trash.

Pretty good for an easy dinner during the week. I think it would have been better without the soup mix. I thought it was to salty but the family loved it.

my rating prolly isn't the most fair b/c i didn't follow the recipe. but i did so based on reviewer comments. worrying about sodium i omitted the soup mix.  probably a mistake b/c it needed salt. also, i used a can each of low-fat cream of mushroom and low-fat cream of chicken with about 2.5 cups of water. lastly, i used brown rice instead of white rice, and mixed in some herbs d'provence and onion powder.  i baked in an 8x8 ceramic dish covered with foil.  but holy cow, it took over 2 hours.  however, end result was tasty moist chicken and yummy creamy rice.  next time i will make in my slow-cooker on high for 4hrs.  and i will also add the soup mix b/c it needs some salt!!

This did make a tender chicken, but it wasn't worthy of 5 stars.

Very good and fast dinner. I overcompensated on the rice after reading other reviews of the rice being soggy. I also used chicken broth instead of water and used cream of asparagus soup. The onion mix gave it a nice flavor and I sprinkled just a little cheese on top. The rice is hard to get to come out perfect but my 3 year old asked for seconds of the chicken which is a rare occasion. Very fast dinner, good flavor.

I was not that pleased with this recipe. It had good flavor but the chicken was on the dry side. I even used chicken breast tenderloins as someone had suggested to prevent the dryness but it was still dry. Don't think I will be making this again.

I thought this recipe was great. Kinda reminds me of something my mom made when I was a kid. Next time though I will cut the chicken breasts into thinner strips instead of using full size chicken breasts.

This was a pretty good recipe. I used 3 cups of rice instead of just the 1 cup, 2 cans of cream of chicken soup and I mixed the onion soup in with the cream of chicken soup. Because of my modifications, I had to cook it for 2 hours total. But it turned out with a great taste that almost everyone loved...picky 3-year-old didn't try it, but that would have been a miracle! :)

I followed the directions. The meal turned out, I just don't think there was that much flavor to it - except a bit too much onion flavor. If I make again, I would use chicken broth and white wine instead of water, and add some garlic and some other spices to spike up the flavor a bit, as per some other reviewers comments. It certainly was super easy, so I will try again with some modifications.

THis was good.  My husband really liked it, but I could have used some flavors in with it other than the salt and pepper we added for taste.  I am sure I will do it again, with some modifications.

This was an excellant base recipe. I added some ingredients for additional taste: I chopped 1/2 an onion, diced 2 garlic cloves and seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and paprika. I then browned the chicken with the onion and garlic in a pan w/ veg. oil. I also mixed the chick. soup with the rice in the pan, topped with the chicken and onion mixture from the pan (added some pan drippings) and then put 1/2 package of onion soup mix on top. My guests and bf loved it! Nice basic home cooking recipe.

I can only give this four stars, because I changed the way I made it.  I used the same ingredients, with a slight difference.  I cooked everything on the stove top instead of in the oven (except the chicken), because all rice recipes I've made in the oven never turned out right (either overcooked or undercooked, could never find a happy medium).  So I doubled the recipe and here's what I did.  Put the chicken in the oven at 400 degrees.  Boiled the water.  Added a little salt and butter.  Poured in the rice.  Stirred in the onion mixes.  Let the rice cook.  When it was finished, I stirred in the cream of chicken soup, but instead of two of those (since I doubled), I used one and a cream of mushroom.  Chicken was nearly done by this time, so when it was done, I sliced it up into chucks and added it to the rice mix.  Then I sprinkled some shredded cheese over the top and served with veggies.  Cooked that way, it turned out great!  Will make it again like this.  Thanks for the base recipe!

pretty good, I used instant rice and the rice and sauce part came out very creamy... next time I think I might cut the chicken up and mix the chicken onion soup and rice together.

I doubled the recipe and followed the directions to a "T".  It was easy, didn't taste too bad, but I'm not so sure about the rice.  It was sort of mushy, I guess.  I'd like to see what other people did differently with it for the next time...

I tried making this in the slow cooker with addtional liquid due to others reviews. Oh my gosh was it ever awful. Mushy and bland. I had such high hopes for this recipe, I have had really delicious chicken and rice from a crockpot before, so I will eventually try again, but it will probably be awhile after this disaster!

A disaster. I used my own spice mix instead of Lipton's soup, but otherwise followed the recipe precisely. Too much liquid and 1 1/2-hour cooking time combined to turn rice into mush.

This was pretty good, but VERY easy.  I doubled the rice and cooked it with the soups for about an hour before I put the chicken in.  It worked out well this way and the chicken didn't get too done.  Tasted even better the next day.

This is a very tasty comfort meal, but I would suggest mixing the onion soup mix in with the can of soup to distribute the flavour better.

This is a good recipe.  The rice seemed a little sparce, so next time I'll add a bit more.  If you're health conscious, try brown rice instead of white rice.  Overall  it's a quick and easy recipe.

This is my first visit to the website and I'm afraid it was not a resounding success!  I really like the idea but I think if I was to use this recipe again I would go for less rice and use fresh chopped onion instead of the soup mix as I felt my version turned out a bit gloopy and very artificial tasting (could just be my cooking!)

this was ok, but would be great with some changes. Per other sugestions I mixed the chicken soup in with the rice and it came out good, a little mushy but was cooked all the way. Also I feel that a packet of onion soup mix it way too much. it was over powering. I will make this again but Im going to season it myself. Something to zest it up but not over power it. Sorry

This was a pretty good recipe. It doesn't exactly taste gourmet but it's easy and my toddler ate it. I did follow the suggestion of other reviewers and used milk instead of water. I would make this again since it uses all ingredients I always have on hand.

This was not my favorite. After 1 hour it was dry on the bottom and the rice wasn't done but I found it kind of mushy after 90 minutes. I wonder if the soup mixture should be stirred into the rice before adding the chicken. I topped it with cheddar cheese (saved it, I think). However, that said, my husband who doesn't like rice enjoyed it! Who knows! My son loved it. I am the one that gets the final rating so I am going with 3 stars.

I thought this was very good!  I used Campbell's Healthy request Cream of Chicken soup to keep the fat and sodium down and used long grain and wild rice instead of plain white.  Next time I will probably reduce the amount of water used to 3/4 cup but other than that it was great! Will definitely make again!

I thought this recipe was wonderful.  I used one of the other reviewers idea and substitued 1.5 cups milk and only used 1/2 of water instead of the total water asked for and really enjoyed it.

As others have mentioned, this is a good recipe with modifications. I used 1.5 cups of milk and 1/2 c water with 1 C of rice plus a can of lowfat cream of mushroom soup. Also fresh garlic and mushrooms. I was afraid the cooking time would be long, but within 1 hour the long-grain rice had cooked thoroughly. The casserole was creamy and tasty and my boyfriend wanted a third serving. Definitely a keeper for worknight suppers!

Great recipe!  The rice cooked up perfectly, the chicken was tender and the sauce that held it all together was rich and yummy.  A good piece of advice, though -- when sprinkling the dried onion soup mix on top before baking, make sure you sprinkle it evenly and sparsely around the casserole.  I managed to get most of it concentrated on the pieces of chicken and it was a little overpowering.

sorry but one star......this just wasn't to my taste.  the onion soup mix was way overpowering and it didn't have a casserole texture...more like a soupy mess...my kids wouldn't touch it and my husband said "no comment".  thanks for the try, tho...

I tried making this with brown rice and it was still crunchy after 90 minutes.  However, the flavour of the chicken was amazing!!!  Not sure what happened but would definitely make this again, next time cooking the rice first.

Loved how easy it was! It definitely needed more rice, and to be turned halfway.  I seasoned the chicken like the other users suggested. Surprisingly rich.  Not bad for a no fuss dish, with minimal ingredients!

This was great! Being a new Mom I don't have much time to prep food. It took me five minutes to prep and the oven did the rest. It gave me plenty of time to tend to the baby while the food was cooking. My husband and I got to sit down to a nice hot meal that we both really enjoyed! Thanks so much!

I "healthified" it. I used 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup, brown rice and added cut up mushrooms, carrots and celery. I also added some poultry seasoning and herbs du Provence for extra seasoning. I took the advice of others and cubed the chicken, mixed everything in a bowl, then put it in the pan. I'm putting it in the oven and running to a yoga class. Hope it's all good when I return.

Flavor was great...rice wasn't totally cooked so should have cooked longer but would have been too dry. Next time I will add just a bit more liquid. I used cream of onion soup and french onion soup to replace the water. I will make it again maybe add a few vegetables.

Doesn't get much easier than this! I didn't even pat the chicken dry, and it turned out just fine. This is a good dish for a beginner cook to make. Can't mess it up!

My wife and I enjoyed this.  Real comfort food. I cut the chicken breasts in half.  I added diced red pepper and peas for color and flavor.  I used a casserole dish with a heavy lid rather than messing with foil.  It's easy to prepare which makes it even more attractive.  I will make it again.

this really is easy to put together.  I like to cook my chicken first then shred it and put it in the bottom of the baking dish.  Then I combine the rice, soup, with chicken broth instead of water and Knorr Vegetable recipe mix instead of onion soup mix.  I pour that over the chicken, cook at 400 degrees until it is nice & bubbly and the rice is cooked through.  My family, who are difficult to please, actually like it.  I have made it several times and always get a good response from them.

Firstly, thank you to the contributor for this recipe. I'm older, retired, cooking for one, this recipe was a joy; so very simple. I will consider adding other veges next time, other than peas. While 'quick may not mean good' in this case this recipe is both quick, versatile and highly recommended, enjoy.

I added a 12 oz. jar of chicken gravy and cut back on the amount of water.  I put skinned chicken legs on top of the rice mixture.  I was very pleased with the result.

I made this tonight. Thought it was pretty good. I added sour cream to the mixture only because I love sour cream & I add it to a lot of my cooking if it fits the recipe. I would definitely make it again. I did brown the chicken & mixed all ingredients with the chicken.

I, too, cut the chicken into bite size pieces.  It is a really good meal to make on a cold winter's night.  I watch grandchildren on certain days and make dinner for the family.  It is a good meal to make if you are a family "on the run."

Great! Everybody loved it. Mixed the rice, cream of chicken soup and water together first, then chicken pieces. Sprinkled the onion soup on top. Done! Next time I'll add a little extra water to make it more saucy and maybe add some broccoli florets. Everyone wants this added to the regular rotation.

I read all the reviews and changes and used homemade chicken stock I made from a cajun fried chicken, added garlic, peas, more rice, cut up the chicken (fried), mixed the rest, and topped it all with cheese and crunched up chips.  Came out GREAT!  doctor this up with what you have plus added some spices.  Thank you for this basic recipe, you could do a lot with your leftovers with this ...

My husband and I loved this dish! Of course I made some tweaks of my own; for example. I used chicken stock instead of water and since I did't have onion soup mix I used dehydrated onions, my own seasoning, fresh sage, and chopped mushrooms.
Can't wait to make it for dinner again.

I used a can of chicken cream soup and vegetables broth. Mixed it together. Pour over cut chicken thighs .springle dry onion mix on top of it. Cook 1 and 1/2 hour. It smells good! It tasted good!
Rice were some soft and hard. Next time I will pour soup and broth in pan and put rice first. Cook about 15 min and then put chickens into it. I will try it again.

My husband and love this recipe!!! I cubed my chicken and seasoned with Morton's season-all. Next I whisked together the soup mix, 1 cup water and cream of chicken soup. I covered tightly and baked at 375 for 40 minutes. I served it over white rice that I cooked stovetop. It was delicious!!!

Chicken was badly overcooked, rice was mush, but the whole thing was soupy because the liquid had not cooked off yet.

It was pretty good, 1.5 hours in oven was a bit too long. An hour would have been enough. Next time I will try chicken broth instead of water to "jazz up" the chicken flavor. Overall I enjoyed it, thanks for sharing!

Very good and easy dish.  You can pretty much add anything to this dish you would like.  I added broccoli and frozen corn.  I also added grated cheese at the end. Next time I am going to also add salt and pepper on top of the rice.

I followed the recipe and it was indelible. The rice was mush and the onion soup flavor overpowering. I made this to take to a friend who was recuperating from surgery but ended up salvaging the chicken to use in another recipe as this dish was just too awful to serve.

Pretty easy and simple meal.  I followed the advice of some other reviewers by mixing the rice with the soup/water mixture.  I also added some canned corn and thawed out peas (to add some veggies).  Turned out pretty good.

We really enjoyed this dish.  I feel like the chicken needed a little more flavor so I marinated it with sage, thyme and rosemary.  YUM!!!!

It was fine..just nothing spectacular. Good for a fast dinner with things on hand. 
I agreed with one commenter that said to chop it all up and stir it.

It was OK.  The family liked it, but I probably won't bother making it again.  The chicken was bland (probably marinating it beforehand would help).  Perhaps using chicken stock instead of water for the rice might help too.  Just kind of boring.

I made this recipe yesterday with a few changed, too and it turned out very delicous! I used pork chops instead of chicken breasts and added a chopped onion. I cooked it in the crock pot on low for 6 hours. I also put the pork chops on the bottom of the crock pot; mixed all rest of ingrediets together in seperate bowl and poured over the top of meat; I added frozen peas one hour before it was done cooking. I will make this recipe again!

It wasn't terrible but it was very plain and boring! The cooking time/temp also left the rice over cooked, the chicken dry and all of the sauce evaporated. If I make it again I will be adding sauteed onion and possibly mushrooms as well as some other spices. & chicken broth with heavy cream instead of water.

I followed the recipe exactly the first time.  Our response - BLAND!  To begin with, the chicken needs a little salt and pepper proir to putting it in the 9x13.  Actually, a little garlic powder or granulated garlic would not hurt (NO Garlic salt) either.

Very easy. Will try again but mix the onion soup in with chicken soup and water to blend better. Will also try cutting chicken into smaller sizes. Perhaps a can of corn for a different texture and to add colour.

YUM! I thought this recipe turned out great. Instead of sprinkling the onion soup on top of the chicken, I mixed it in with the cream of chicken soup and water. I love how quick and easy this recipe is and I had all the ingredients on hand. Took me literally 3 minutes to get it ready! Will definately make again. Thanks for the quick delicious recipe!

I had to laugh because I didn't click into this for a few days because what could be easier or more crowd pleasing then my g-ma and great g-mas recipe. I am 55 years old and this is the exact same recipe my g-mas made! Well they used a cut-up fryer with skin and all for the chicken. Then Mom changed it to bone-less chicken after I had grown up. I cut it in bite size pieces when my grown kids were little kids....Everyone of their married friends calls or texts me for the recipe at some point! It's a keeper and SO easy! Hmmm now what am I going to do that is different tonight....guess this will be it anyway! LOL

My husband loved it. I doubled the recipe and used brown rice so it took longer to cook but was worth the wait. Next time I will try adding some vegetables.

Way too salty. Maybe it would be okay if there is a lower sodium soup but I won't be making this again.

Cravable! Such a simple meal, but so yummy! I switched  mine around a bit and used V8 broccoli soup rather than cream of chicken and added a layer of cheese on the top. Will be making this one often.

This was okay, but the dry onion soup's flavor was very dominant. If I make this again I'll def use less of it.

Loved it! quick and easy..flavorful.boyfriend loved it and he is the main cook in our house. Tonight I'm trying it with cut up potatoes instead of rice to see how it tastes..adding celery, carrots too. Cut up chicken and put the chicken in the last 15 min. to cook so it won't dry out..

Yummy!! Ok so I am not usually a'casserole' making kinda girl, but tonite I was looking for an easy and quick recipe and came across this one....I didn't do many changes other than using 6 smaller boneless, skinless thighs rather than chicken breasts (only because I didn't have them on hand) I also added some frozen broccoli, but otherwise followed recipe and it really turned out well!! Thanks you for this recipe, I will definatly make this again!

pretty good but needed some doctoring up. I used brown rice, added a can of mixed veggies and only used 1/2 the pack of soup mix to make it a little more healthy.  Needed a little more moisture so next time I may add a little milk or an extra can of soup and try frozen veggies for less salt if I remember.

This recipe was very good, but I like others made some changes, with casseroles it's fun to do that. I added fresh mushrooms, frozen corn and peas, fresh onion (instead of the dry soup mix) and fresh garlic. I topped it the last 15 minutes with cracker crumbs and grated colby jack cheese, added a tad of butter. Very good.

It was yummy and filling.  We served it to 4 of us in the family and still had quite a bit left over.  I actually used chuncks of cooked chicken (because I was looking for a way to use leftovers) and it worked just fine!

Been trying out fast, easy recipes lately and wanted to experiment with recipes using canned soups...uh, this was alright. I used a can of mushroom soup. Not the chicken I'm used to. What about some spices? Add 1 ts of paprika, 1/2 a ts each of chilli powder and black pepper, add mushrooms or mixed veggies, and chop a onion on top to give it a crispy onion topping. We used 2 c of rice for 1 cut up chicken...we're bigger rice eaters, but that required extra water and cooking time. It was very heavy and rich for us, even though we used the healthy low fat/ sodium canned soup and only skinless chicken.

The casserole had a good flavor. My kids really liked it. I wasn't thrilled with how the rice turned out...I did mix the rice and liquids as per other suggestions, but the consistency still wasn't quite right. Would probably add veggies next time.

The chicken was dry, and the rice took a long time to cook- I ended up adding water twice to have enough liquid. I would not make it again. It was edible, but not memorable.

Very bland, and the chicken got done before the rice.  Definitely needs some colby jack cheese melted over the top - we did this and it improved immensely.

This was awesome! Only changes were adding a little more rice and substituting chicken broth for the water. I think it really made the chicken moist. Yum!!

very good. I mix up the rice and add about 3/4 cup of milk instead of the water and the soup mix. lay in in a greased baking pan. Then add some frozen peas and then put the chicken on top. Add garilic, salt and pepper! cover and bake just about 10 min. before its done take off the foil and let it get nice and brown! very good and easy

This was okay.  It was definitely easy, but I don't know if I would make it as again. The rice was not mushy though.  It was just a little boring.

I mixed all the ingrediants together except the chicken and put that in the greased pan and placed the chicken on top. I also added and extra can of soup to make it much creamier.

I thought this recipe was bad.  I even tried to help it with some cheese on top, but it didn't work.  My husband liked it (he said about 3 stars) and my daughter even ate it.  For me, it just wasn't very good.  But since it got my family's approval, it for 3 stars.

This is an easy recipe that you can make fairly quickly. My husband loved this and he is a very picky eater. The only suggestion I have is to cook it less than 1 1/2 hour...the chicken gets too done. Maybe an hour would be long enough.

This was one of the best recipes I've tried. It was easy and delicious. I added a little cheese and tomatoes in the chicken and my husband was truly impressed, and that's saying a lot. He's usually picky when it comes to new recipes.

I've just started cooking and honestly, this was the first meal I made for myself and it was wonderful! I improvised a bit when I couldn't find dry onion soup mix at the store and I used a packet of marinade seasoning. As a result it came out very strong, so next time I'll experiment some more. The rice was slightly mushy but it didn't take away from the dish, the chicken was moist and tender. My boyfriend and I both loved it, and the leftovers are wonderful as well. 4 stars because I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but this sort of dish seems very versatile and could suit whatever tastes you have.

I doubled the recipe and only used one  package of Lipton onion soup mix. I will only use a 1/2 a package next time. I also addrd 2 teaspoons of chicken bullion to 2 cups water and add on can of Cream of Celery or Cream of Mushroom Soup.  Sprinkled garlic powder, seasoned salt, and pepper on meat, than pour mixture over the meat and cook as directed. Yum, Yum!

This recipie was okay, but it was a little to strong. My husband didn't like it all that much. He didn't like the onion flavor. However it was okay.

This dish was VERY easy to put together... it took less than 5 mins.  I don't think I will be making it again though, it was boring and bland.  There are much better casseroles out there.  A bachelor friend of ours raved about it, so it could just be my opinion... or it could be because he never gets home-cooked meals.

How many variations of this recipe are there?  It's older than my underwear, boring, bland and only for the beginner cook.  Don't bother, there are so many other recipes on this site that are better.  Much better.

Tried this recipe for some very picky children and a picky husband, they all LOVED it! Only changed 1 thing, instead of white rice used a seasoned yellow rice, it had them coming back for seconds. Thanks for posting it!!!!!

This recipe is so easy and is very good.  I use crm. of mushroom soup instead and add a little garlic powder for some extra flavor.  Both my husband and one and a half year old love this dish!

Very good and quick!  Good last minute meal using ingredients already on hand.  Pleasant surprise.
