Very good and very versatile.  I swapped sausage for bacon and frozen spinach for chard (that's what I had available) and it still worked out perfectly.

Wow!  Grew up in an Italian family, never really cared for frittatas.  My friend asked me if I wanted to make one for dinner.  Chef John is my go-to guy on Allrecipes.  I figured if he liked it, I would.  And wow! It was perfect!  The bacon seasoned the potatoes flawlessly.  I would not substitute sausage for bacon, it doesn't give off the same oil/taste.  Instead, just add sausage (which I will definitely be doing next time).   Thank you, Chef John, once again!

This was fantastic!! As are all of Chef John's recipes! I added onion, just because I love  them, and a scoop of ricotta and some cream to the egg mixture. Delicious!

I loved doing this - I had never made a frittata or used a broiler before. I used leftover thanksgiving potatoes and fresh spinach. I made it and then cut it into quarters and stuck it in the fridge for breakfast for the week. Yummy!

I transferred the mix into a pie pan before putting it in the oven, and this made it require more baking time - approximately 20 minutes at 375, plus the broiling time as written.

This is delicious! Word of advice, don't use a cast iron pan, like it shows in the image above though. It's too hot to cook the potatoes long enough, the bacon starts to burn. I had to transfer everything to another large skillet midway. That aside,  this is so good, and really very easy. I used baby spinach I had on hand vs the swiss chard, and it worked  great! Everyone gobbled it up for New Years Day brunch. Some even topped it with some hot sauce which was yummy also.

I transferred the vegetables and eggs to a baking dish and baked for 20 minutes, then broil for 4 minutes. Turned out great!

I love this recipe! It was a hit in my house, easy to make, and works as a base recipe for other versions.

I made mine with small, yellow-fleshed potatoes, cheddar and spinach. As the potatoes were so lively, I sliced them in halves and pre-boiled them, so I could just throw them in the pan when my husband got home.

Thanks for the great recipe. Recipe itself is great and very easy to change it to my taste. I have tried it with spinach, chive and other different combinations of cheese and such. For me, spinach tasted the best with mozarella and lots of parmiggiano. The best grandpa recipe ever!

We didn't have enough tots to cover thew who bottom, so we filled in with potatoes OBrian. We added more green pepper, and put some sharp Cheddar cheese on top for the last ten minutes of cooking.
We will definitely make this again.

Used the technique but used sausage, onions, potatoes and Cheddar cheese. It was fantastic and everyone loved it. It seems this infinitely adaptable to what you have on hand. Thanks!

I love Swiss chard.  I can use the leaves and/or the stalks like celery.  This is a delicious recipe but I will leave out the garlic.  I know it is nutritious but hubby hates it except in Italian food.

Only changed I made was to use spinach instead of Swiss chard.  One thing I will do differently next time is to remove the  bacon before adding the potatoes and then add it back in with the eggs at the end.  My bacon got a little too crispy and a bit burned.  But the taste and texture and everything was super.  I agree with others this is very versatile, you could use other meats like ham or sausage.  The potato was something I  thought would be odd, but it was super!

This was amazing!  My husband doesn't eat pork so I used thick cut turkey bacon and I added some chopped onions to the potatoes and spinach instead of the chard.   I also added shredded cheddar cheese to the egg mixture.  It was so good and I'm not big on eggs but I will definitely make this again.  A new favorite!

I added a few extra spices (vegetable seasoning) while cooking the potatoes.
