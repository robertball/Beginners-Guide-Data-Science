May family loved the recipe, I used 1 teaspoon less salt.  I really do not care for the taste of salt, the recipe was not harmed by using less salt. Since I cooked chicken pieces I baked the stuffing for 15 minutes at 350.

Good recipe and easy to make - suggest using one less teaspoon of salt and adding raisins and pecans.
