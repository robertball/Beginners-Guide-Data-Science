This is an excellent, healthy stew that really hits the spot. I used leftover chicken breast but omitted the fennel because I do not care for the flavor. Love the spinach in it!

Great flavor!  I did make a few changes mostly in the preparation.  I left out the fennel because I didn't have any and it was delicious without it.  I also cooked it on the stove-top, not the microwave.  I used 3 1/2 c. chicken broth (2 1/2 c. to start and then added 1 c. with the carrots and spinach toward the end.)  I put the chicken, diced tomatoes, lentils, 2 1/2 c. chicken broth, garlic, herbs, salt and pepper in a large pot and cooked it for about an hour.  Then added 1 c. water with the carrots and spinach and cooked for another 15 mins. or so, until the carrots were tender.  I'll definitely make this again!

I did a slight twist - since my boyfriend hates fennel, I swapped the fennel and italian herbs for an Indian take - curry powder, cumin, tumeric, and a pinch of all spice.  It worked great.  Was very easy to make, and the ingredients are great comfort food. Tasted great the next day as well.

This is an easy and delicious recipe.  The first time I made it, it was tasty, but the chicken was over done and the lentils weren't done enough.  The second time I made this dish, I cooked the lentils and chicken before hand.  When I got ready to eat it, I just heated up a bowl for myself and froze the rest.  That did the trick.  It was perfect.

This really hit the spot for my pre-diabetic hubby!  i doubled the recipe and added half an onion and a few stalks of celery.  Everything except the spinach was thrown in a slow cooker with an extra cup of water -- I didn't even need to defrost the chicken thighs.  After 8 hours or so, I mixed in 8oz of frozen spinach and served immediately.  The spices could use a little tweaking, but as easy weeknight dinners go, this was a winner. We'll definitely be making this again.  Next time, I'll try using some red wine.

This was rather horrible.  The fennel was very over powering (and I like fennel!).  I had to add all kinds of spices and an extra can of diced tomatoes to make it edible.  I gave it two stars because after I tweaked it - it was edible.  I would not recommend the fennel.  I would also cut the amount of lentils in half.

Great healthy stew, I loved the fennel and also added some onion, just because thats our personal preference.  Thanks so much for the post.

I love this recipe.  I've made it multiple times and it's so good.  I modified it this time by adding Rotell instead of the tomatos, simply because I didn't have tomatos and omited the Italian seasoning.  It gave it a nice little zip.

One pot, what could be better! Left out the fennel - don't like it. You really need those 8 cloves of garlic, otherwise the flavor is flat. I also added about 8 sliced mushrooms. This is a keeper. Yummy, hearty and healthy to boot!

Served this to my lentil-hating husband and my 16-month-old as well as my parents. They all loved it. I cooked it in the slow cooker as one of the other reviews recommended. The only thing I added was hot sauce to mine to spice it up a bit. Other than that, very tasty!

This was pretty good. It didn't say whether to shred the chicken, so I just cut 1-inch-wide strips to help it cook faster. I followed another reviewer's instructions and used about 3 cups of liquid (2 broth, 1 water) and cooked all but the carrots and spinach for about 1 hour, then added the carrots and spinach for about 15 minutes. Well, the carrots weren't cooked, but I had run out of time. It had a nice flavor and the leftovers ended up more stew-like, which I think I liked better. The lentils (I used yellow) made it a filling meal.

I really loved this - it seemed so healthy and hearty - but my husband and step-son didn't care for it. My husband isn't a fan of lentils - I even cooked them separate to keep them from getting hard but even with them perfectly soft he just didn't care for it. I didn't have fennel seed; I added diced summer squash & broccoli to use them up and I really did love it. Oh well.

This was delicious!  Highly recommended.  I first made this earlier today for a group of ten quilters.  Everyone asked for the recipes and had seconds!  I only made one alteration, and that was to add mushrooms, because I love to have mushrooms in stew.

This was delicious! I used real fennel and omitted the lentils. I baked it in the oven at 375 for 45 min. Then I made some couscous and put the stew on top. super easy and can use whatever veggies/grains have on hand.  Will definitely make again.

My kids said to rate this recipe 5 stars. This is the first time my son has eaten cooked spinach and actually liked it. I put in only a pinch of fennel seed. I also added leftover pasta and extra chicken broth. Delicious!

This was a very good base for a chicken stew. I used twice the tomatoes, added mushrooms and a little paprika and a small amount of garlic salt and made it on the stovetop as the simmering was important for flavor.

Quite good though it did not cook evenly in the microwave.  The lentils were not done nor was the chicken after 25 minutes. We will do this over the stove next time. Halved the Italian seasoning (gives me heartburn) and used chicken thighs. Would like to try middle eastern spices next time - cumin and other things.  But, healthy, quick and hearty.  Can't complain.

Basically a great recipe with great taste but I did change a couple things.  I used ground chicken, a can of chick peas, used more broth and left out the fennel. I also cooked this on the stove top.  Very tasty and will make again.

I would have given it a perfect score because the flavor was great BUT the Lentils never cooked through.  I think the next time I make it I will cook it on top of the stove as I do my lentil soup. I was a little leary in the first place when I saw it was a microwave dish. Nothing ever comes out right in a microwave except just to reheat something. Good Flavor though. Easy and the fennel was wonderful.

Hearty and good. As at least one other reviewer noted, I prepared this dish on the stove top. I needed more chicken broth than the other reviewer used, starting out with 2 1/2 cups and adding more as the moisture evaporated. It did take well over an our for the carrots and lentils to soften. I loved the garlic and fennel, both favorites at our house. My wife was underwhelmed, as I may have been if I compared this recipe to high fat, unhealthy dishes, but as a heart-healthy recipe that also tastes good, this one rocked.

I was reluctant to try the micro cooking. It seems like cheating. But my wife was hungry, so we tried it. It worked great! Used a lot of different ingredients - potatoes, carrots, parsnips, kale, and leek, plus the chicken and can of tomatoes, and only 2 garlic cloves - but the cooking process was so easy. Took 30 minutes with all the stuff I had. Will remember this one for the future.

Fabulous flavors in this dish.  I made this is a slow cooker for 4 hours.  I added a lot more broth, about triple the chicken broth to make it more soupy.  The lentils absorbed a lot of the broth.  I put the fresh spinach in about 2 hours into the cooking. Then I shredded the chicken when it was done.  We serve it over rice.  A great recipe for filling folks up!

Delicious, easy, and healthy. Appreciated the review suggestions.  Needs a bit more liquid than recipe has, so I pre-cooked the lentils in 1 cup+ broth until dry.  For my preferences, I browned the chicken (with a bit of garam marsala) -- and added it for the last 10 minutes. I added browned onions and chopped cauliflower (any veggies likely would work.). I added a few chopped mushrooms for last 10 minutes. I left out fennel. The garlic makes the dish, so don't skimp. Yum.
