Perfect!  The broth of this soup is rich and tasty.  I omitted the sugar, even though there's hardly any, but I don't like too-sweet French Onion Soups, and I used Vidalia onions, which are sweet on their own.  I slathered some minced garlic on the toast, instead of just rubbing a clove, since we love garlic in this house.  You may miss the gooey mouth-feel from the lack of gobs of cheese, but the flavor is still really good, and this is much healthier.  Be careful not to add too much black pepper without taste-testing, as it is quite noticeable, but not excessive, as long as you like pepper.  Great recipe!

VERY tasty! I did use a dab of butter in with the 1/4 cup broth to cook the onions. I've made french onion before and I believe the buttery taste of the onions lend to the flavor of the soup. I know its only a tsp but it added a hint of a buttery flavor. Other then that I used it to the T and it was fantastic. Will definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely perfect. The only thing I changed was that I added mushrooms to enrich the broth.

I subbed this recipe with canned French Onion Soup to make Salisbury Steak (recipe also from this sight).  This worked great and even the picky husband loved it!  Thanks for sharing!

This is an excellent recipe.  Admittedly, I made it with beef broth because that's what I had in the pantry; next time, I'll make it using the vegetable broth. Also, I used the Vidalia onions which I had on hand. Typically, I prefer them to other onions, but in this instance, they made the broth quite sweet. I would agree with the reviewer who suggested omitting the sugar if you are using sweet onions.  To counter that sweetness, I added a 1/2 teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce, a bit of sea salt, and an extra grinding of black pepper.  These minor points aside, it is an easy, delicious recipe, and a real "keeper."   Many thanks for sharing it!

As with most recipes, I used this as a guide.  The soup was delicious.  My cheese was a mixture of mozzarella, good old cheddar cheese, and Parmesan.

I will omit the sugar because it was a little sweet but great flavor and very to make.  Next time I'm going to slice the onions with a mandolin slicer.

Added 1 tablespoon each of red wine & balsamic vinegar, mixed with 1/2 teaspoon sugar. I omitted the flour. Very flavorful!

I was going for vegetarian instead of low-cal. I made these changes: I browned the onions in 3 tablespoons of butter, added 1 teaspoon of garlic powder to the other herbs, added 1 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar with the veggie broth, and used a slice of swiss cheese instead of the parmesan. Brought it to New Year's Eve dinner party and it was dang good. Good base recipe.

This recipe is so easy and delicious. I did add some beef bouillon granules to the soup, but it's good without them too. I shared this with some co-workers who also loved it!

Fantastic!  I didn't have parmesan, so I used asiago, and used croutons instead of toast.  This is superb!

I substituted homemade chicken broth and mozzarella for the like ingredients and omitted the brandy as a personal preference.  To me, it’s not as rich as a beef French onion soup but this was a very respectable lighter version.  I developed the fond three times (tip I learned on America’s Test Kitchen) and it was very flavorful and delicious.
