A good base recipe for a hearty cracker, but it is rather bland as written. It needs salt and either add seasoning in the dough or pair with a flavorful dip.

Great simple recipe!  I've made these a few times though I add garlic powder and sea salt to the recipe.  Once I also threw in Parmesan cheese!  I call these Paleo Triscuits as they're a little thicker.

I haven't had a cracker in a gazillion years.  I'm allergic to so many things.  I've never made a cracker before, and these were to die for.

Slight changes I made:
- I added garlic salt, pepper, and Italian seasonings to the flour mixture.
- after adding 1 T of water it was waaaay too runny, so I just added equal amounts of the flour until it was a nice dough
- I cooked it in light tasting olive oil, because I don't like coconut oil

Note:  I used wax paper to roll out the dough.  DON'T do it!  The dough reeeeally stuck to the wax paper and it was hard to get it off.

In any case, THANK YOU!  I really have been craving crackers for a long time.  I'm sure I will try many alterations of these!

These weren't all that bad but I did modify. I read they were too bland so I added 1/4 tsp of salt, 1/4 tsp of pepper. I accidentally made them too thick but they still came out decent.

Loved how easy this was to make for my first attempt at crackers. They cooked up good in the pan. But as someone else said, way too bland. I added a few things, but probably made it too spicy. Will try again.
