Fantastic! I did only marinate for 1 1/2 hrs. While marinating, I flipped the fish once. I didn’t have any panko or bread crumbs, so I crushed up croutons (fat free) garlic flavored. I didn’t have any thyme, either. I added a little zucchini and asparagus, too. The fish was only about 1/2 thick. It was done in about 17 minutes. My husband loved it. Raved about it. I will definitely be cooking this again!

This tasted light and fresh while I was eating it, but it kept coming back to haunt me for the rest of the night. Most likely will not make this one again. Sorry!

I love the orange flavor with the fish.  The orange zest really adds a lot of flavor.

Awesome fish dish! So easy. I didn’t let it marinate for 2 hours. I probably only let it sit for about 30 minutes. Tasted great! Also didn’t add any orange zest. My husband loved it too.

loved it. used organic naval oranges. was sweet not overwhelming either way. had to use Cod. local store out of Haddock. modified ingredients a bit. hint use melted butter mix into mush. use 1/4 amount of panko as recommended. unless greater than one pound. taste was outstanding. as soon as you tasted the fish (which I don't like) the orange takes over and compliments the flavor. will definitely make again.

Made the recipe pretty much as it was written tonight for dinner, and we all loved it. I did pour off a little of the orange juice before putting the topping on the fish, as I had two very juicy oranges and I was afraid there was too much juice.  And I cooked it for 15 minutes and it was done - but I think you need to figure in the size of your fish fillets anyway.  We will definitely have this again!

This was really different. Wasn't sure about orange with fish but it worked. My husband needs a low sodium diet so we use a lot of Mrs. Dash. The panko topping was nice and crisp and our fish was moist still. The other reviewer must have had a bad batch of oranges. Ours had no bitterness, just a fresh sweet orange flavor. Served ours with glazed carrots and rice pilaf. Will make again.

I used cod as that's what I had. Also, navel oranges which have little juice. That said, we found the taste bitter (I was very careful NOT to get pith). Maybe if some sugar were added it would be ok but in the long run, it's just too much work.
