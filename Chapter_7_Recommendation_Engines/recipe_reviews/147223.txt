This is a great recipe, but I thought I would try a little variation. I used the ingredients submitted except I added a red bell pepper for added color. I used 3 cups of white sugar and two of brown sugar. I added a whole bulb of garlic. I also wanted to add just a little heat so I put in ten jalapeno peppers, five with seeds and five without. I think the final mustard turn out perfect with a little heat but not a lot.
It's been about 3 or 4 years since my first post. Due to the fact flour is not recommended for canning I have started using Clear gel. The Clear gel works great and there is no clumping to deal with. I substitued 3/4 cup of Clear gel for the flour in the recipe. Clear gel can be found on Amazon.

Delicious.  If you are a beginner, make a half recipe the first time.  To avoid lumps, use warm water to stir into the flour, and also add some of the hot liquid to the flour mixture before stirring into the mustard mixture. I use sweet banana peppers for the most part, with only a few hot thrown in...we like it low heat mixed with sweet.

This stuff is awesome! I think the recipe could be written better though which is why I rated it 4 stars.  Tips for people using this recipe--as mentioned, it yields 16 - 8oz jars.  Don't worry about chopping up the peppers too much in the food processor, they cook down.  I added one jalapeno and kept the seeds in to make it spicier.  I put the water/flour mix in a quart jar and shook it up, that worked well and I didn't have any trouble with chunks that way.  Had to get it out with a small rubber scrapper though as it does get thick!  Otherwise recipe was great!

My friend and I made 3 (1/2 batches) of this recipe, with modifications to the last 2 just to experiment. All are wonderful but the favorite hands down was our 3rd half batch. Here are our modifications: 10 banana peppers we processed until smoothish while the other 10 we coarse chopped, along with 1 jalapeno, and 1 red bell pepper, 1 cup white sugar, 1 cup brown sugar, and 1 cup honey, also in this batch we used 6 TBL corn starch and 3/4 cup water instead of the flour and water. The rest of the ingredients are the same as the recipe (by half of course, since we were making 1/2 batches) We like the smoothness and lightness that the corn starch gave the recipe and the coarse chopped peppers give it a pretty look.

This recipe was just what I was looking for!  I followed the instructions exactly and it turned out wonderful!  The only problem I had was stirring in the flour mixture.  It turned into a bunch of clumps.  I waited till the recipe cooled a little and then using a whisk, the clumps disappeared.  Great recipe!  I plan on handing jars out at Christmas time for teachers with bag of pretzels!

DH and I are competing cooks, so when he tasted this after I made it and said, "It's delicious" I was ecstatic. It was my first time so I did cut the recipe in half and used 16 banana peppers with 4 jalapeno, leaving in some of the ribs for heat. I also used 2 cups of white sugar with 1/2 cup brown. Instead of just dumping in the flour/water mixture, I tempered it a little with the boiling mustard and it worked just fine. My yield was only 4 and about a quarter pints, but for the first attempt (and definitely not the last) I was very pleased! Thanks so much for the recipe - I wish I could give it more than 5 stars.

Exactly what I was looking for, it is a hit!  The only thing I did different is 1c of flour instead of 1 1/2. Great recipe thanks!

Found a great price on banana peppers at a  local produce market, so I decided to give this a try and use as give-aways to friends and family.  As recommended by another reviewer, I added a couple red mini bell peppers which gave the mustard just a bit of color (with no effect on flavor).  I bought the inexpensive store brand of mustard which made this even more affordable.  Made half a recipe, used 4-oz canning jars, and ended up with a lot of nice little homemade gifts.  This will be a nice change from the traditional jams and preserves that we all give away so often.  This should be absolutely delicious with one of the soft pretzel recipes on AR. UPDATE 4.12.12  Mixed this into some sour cream and served over freshly-steamed asparagus last night, and it was delicious.  Also, mixed some of the mustard into mayonnaise for a really nice potato salad dressing.

Very good, husband loved it better then gourmet mustard be buy.  I did use a mix of 5 different peppers because we like more heat! In addition to the banana peppers, I used a chili pepper, Hungarian wax pepper, jalapeño pepper and a habanero pepper. A definite keeper! Thanks for sharing !

I have made this a couple of times and along the way adjusted the sugars to my own taste.  My friends & family beg for more when their jar is empty !! The only thing I do differently is I let the mixture cool before adding the flour/water mixture and then heat it back up to thicken. I did this because I could not keep it from lumping when the mixture was at it's hottest.  My way comes at smooth as can be !!!

I left all seeds in the peppers for some heat. Overall it turned out better than expected. i use it on hot dogs, hamburgers, and as chip dip. I would say if you like franks red hot you could tolerate the taste of leaving the seeds in.

This turned out very well and I can't wait for everyone else in my family to try it.  I adjusted the servings down to 9 and used five banana peppers I had in the garden.  I added all the ingredients except the flour/water mixture to the food processor and then cooked it to boiling.  My flour/water mixture lumped after adding it to the mixture so I think that I'd add more water next time so it's not so thick going in.

I have received nothing but rave reviews on this mustard.  I have even been asked to start mass producing it and selling it!  Outstanding recipe and a great way to use the peppers from the garden.

I'm on my second batch this week......The first batch went so fast I don't know what happened.  I'm doubling the next batch, processing it in half-pint jars then decorating the jars and giving it to our "adult" trick-or-treaters!

The first batch my wonderful husband and me made was going good until we added the flour/water, which turned into dumplings.  The second time we mixed the flour with cold water and slowly added it as he vigorously wisked it for me.  The second batch we also substituted some brown sugar for white.  It turned out great.

I used 2.5 cups of white and 2.5 cups of brown sugar.  I also used 6 Bhut Jolokia (Ghost Pepper) because I wanted it with a lot more kick - everyone raves about this mustard!

My flour clumped really bad.  I followed instructions. ???? It happened to my neighbor also.  It was still really good.  I love dipping hot soft pretzels into it.

This is an amazingly fresh tasting mustard! Because of the conflicting info on being able to can this safely because of the flour, I freeze the peppers and make fresh batches when needed. This is wonderful in tuna salad!

My pepper plant gave off almost 200 peppers this year.  The type of pepper is "longhorn".  Some are super hot and some aren't.  Even so, I used almost 50 peppers, seeds and all, for the recipe.  I also decreased the sugar by about a cup.  Additionally, I used .75 cups "clear gel" instead of flour since it's an approved thickener for canning (flour isn't). I was feeling pretty paranoid about using the flour but I know a lot of people use it without a problem.  Clear Gel can be found on Amazon. The recipe has been a huge hit with my friends.  I highly recommend it!!!

I have not tried this recipe yet, but will be.  However, in reading over the reviews I am seeing that ALOT of people have no idea how to make a thickener even for basic gravy apparently!  Put your flour and water mixture in a gravy shaker (Pampered Chef or any other cheaper brand even) and shake till the mix is smooth.  There will be no lumps!!!  Or you can whisk vigorously in a jar or small bowl for the same results.  NO NEED TO ADD MORE WATER TO THIS RECIPE!  I am rating this 5 because I am quite sure I will like it (and because you can't post anything on here without clicking the stars!)

I've just finished a half batch of this mustard.  I've taken a star off for the flour/water ratio...you absolutely need more water than flour in order to get a smooth mixture to stir into the hot liquid.  I ended up putting the ugly glob in my food processor and added half again as much water.  
Another thing, the food processor wasn't making a smooth enough job of the peppers on their own so I added in some of the sugar and mustard and that really made a much better job of it.  Even though it's still hot, the taste is pretty darned good.  I might add just a bit more sugar next time but I'll wait until I taste the cooled product before making that decision. By the way, a half recipe made exactly 6 pints of mustard.

The flavor of this mustard was excellent!  I followed the recipe as shown, but had a problem when it came to mixing the flour and water.  1 and 1-2 cups of flour mixed with 1 cup of water created a dumpling-type thick drop batter and when I added this mixture to the boiling banana pepper mixture, it created lots of dumplings.  I checked the recipe to make sure I had added the correct amount of flour and water, and I did, so I was disappointed.  I tried to fish all the dumplings out before I put it in jars.  I will try it again with less flour and and see what happens.

Thank you for this wonderful recipe! I bought what I thought was a yellow bell pepper plant, or at least that's what it said it was, and it turned out to be banana peppers and I had no idea what I was going to do with them! This mustard turned out perfect! It did get lumpy as I think I had too much flour but I threw it in my mom's old Hamilton beach blender right off the stove, just before I canned and processed it and it turned out smooth and yummy just like professional mustard.
Thanks!

this stuff is AMAZING. this is by far one of the best recipes ive made on this site. i used banana peppers from my garden and since they werent very hot i added a few shakes ( maybe1 tbsp) of cayenne. i made a big bowl and they were dipping hard pretzels and chips into it and it was good on the hot dogs good. this is almost a mustardy relish. went especially well on polish sausages.

With all my extra hot peppers, cherries and hungarian waxed, I thought I'd try this.  I cut the recipe in half. Also added the seeds of four peppers.  Turned our excellent.  You could skip the seeds. It'll still be hot.  Give it a try. You won't be disappointed.

Absolutely fabulous flavor..Perfect EXCEPT for adding flour. Had read previous reviews so tried to mix flour and water first time...Still got clumps. Second time I sifted flour....much better. The flour clumps are ONLY reason it's not a "5".

Have been making this mustard for 3 years now  as it is a  favorite  items in my holiday gifts.   Take  seeds  out of half  of peppers &  has a nice  little bite, for those  who don't like hot stuff.   Stopped using  flour  due to lumps, this year I used suggestion of another viewer & used  powdered bulk  gel/pectin... 1st time it didn't  come together,  had to take out of  jars that had  sealed & redid it using suggestion  of  corn starch., 12 TBS  for whole batch..worked perfectly.

I made a half batch, but only used jalapeños and left the seeds in. I also added one Carolina reaper to the mix. The only issue I had was the flower clumping, which with my next batch, I will in sure that doesn’t happen again. Very good !

A honey mustard with a zesty semi spicy finish. I cut recipe in 1/4 and added a baby jalapeno (1") and 2 salsa peppers (still green), removing all seeds. Delish!! My daughter claims it's the very best mustard she has ever tasted! Can't wait to give some to friends, if it lasts that long!

I canned several pints for my neighbors using hot banana peppers, 3 jalapenos 2 with seeds, re-pureed ALOT in my blender after cooking, and added a red pepper for color as suggested. The reviews are in and my neighbors are RAVING! I even subbed the sugar for equal...but no one needs to know that:) My buddys bringing me another 10lbs of peppers in return for a few more jars. My most successful canning recipe yet, thank you so much for it!!!!

Loved it, fixed it exactly as stated but tempered the flour water mixture. Next time I would cut back on the sugar a little maybe by a cup.

I just made 18 oz of this to try it before busting out 9 pints and it is the most delicious recipe I have EVER made from this site. We tried some Hot Pepper Mustard we bought in a store in Helen, GA over the weekend and we ran out in a day with Ham Sandwiches, Pretzels, and Brats.. I used Half a Jar of Hot pepper rings and a few Jalapenos instead of slicing myself. Also, I too had a problem with the flour water ratio but stirred until my arm almost fell off and they were barely noticeable. FANTASTIC!! Gonna make a larger batch this weekend.

This is a great recipe that takes well to modifications. I added one jalapeno, used 6 tablespoon of cornstarch as seen in another review. This change makes a more appealing texture. Also incorporating both brown and white sugars gives it a bit of a different flavor and the color turns out wonderful. This is the best mustard, everyone I have given it too wants more!

Great recipe!  I did make changes for dietary purposes (gluten free and sugar free household).

I used 4 cups of Sucralose (TM Splenda) in place of the sugar to minimize the glycemic impact.  I also substituted a 1/2 cup of cornstarch in place of flour because we are a gluten-free household.  Finally, I used two cups of agave nectar in place of the honey (again, the glycemic index factor) and one of the cups of sugar.  I heated the agave nectar up and mixed the cornstarch into it before  pouring it into the pot, thus eliminating the cup of water.  
 
It was a little sweet to me - I'd prefer more of a bite of pepper/mustard - but the rest of my family and friends like it the way it is.  In the future, I'd probably cut out some of the sucralose.  Considering it was my first time making this recipe and making the dietary modifications on the fly and people really like it as it is, I'll call it a success.

Can I just say, "yum" ?  I cut this recipe by 4 to use the peppers I was able to get off my one plant.  Next year I'm planting 10 plants and gifting jars of this.  Didn't change a thing, though next time I may cut the sugar slightly.  Eating it with pretzels and find it to be absolutely delicious.  Did have some problems getting the flour smooth and I also don't have a food processor or blender so my banana peppers are just very finely chopped.  Still super good.  WILL MAKE AGAIN.

I love this recipe!!!  This is the second year we have used it and it is the best.  One revision though, when you add the flour, it says to pour it in.  The flour mixture is a thick paste and if you try to pour it in, you get lumps.  Add some of the hot mustard to loosten it up. Fabulousrecipe...everyone wants a jar of our mustand!

Love this mustard!!! I made a few changes... I used some jalapeño peppers as well, about 10. I also used some of the seeds in for a little more pop (in one batch I also added a few habaneros). I also used 3 cups white sugar and 2 cups brown sugar. I also added a T of white pepper. It came out a little thick the first time so I cut the flour to a cup leaving the water the same. I love it in burgers, hot dogs, pretzels, in my sloppy Joe mix and in my baked beans.

Excellent recipe...thanks! Followed recipe and had no issue. I did use a hand blender before hot water processing to make sure all lumps out as other users had said lumps had occurred but really did not see a problem with that. Loving this recipe!

Way too sweet for me. I followed the recipe as written but if I made this again I would cut the sugar by at least half and maybe even add a dash of hot sauce. The sweetness totally overwhelmed the spiciness.

Recipe is very tasty but I used corn starch instead of flour and left out the honey.  Also recipe doesn’t state how many 1/2 pints, pints or quarts this recipe makes. I made almost 7 pints with this.

My family and I love this mustard. I add garlic and mustard seeds. You can use white vinigar, I use half white sugar and half brown. I only use about 3/4 cup of flour. Make sure you temper your flour to avoid lumps.

The flavor is awesome but the flour and water lumped.  I will definitely make this again but will take my time when thickening the mustard.

Taste is great, but even when putting flour and water mixture in at a full boil, it clumped like dumplings, I used an immersion blender in the boiling pot to break up the clumps. Use caution doing this as it will splash and the steam will burn you from the rolling boil. I also used my stand mixer with meat grinder attachment to process the peppers, and it worked great. Other than that, I love the flavor and Was exactly what I was hoping for.

I've made this several times so far.  My banana peppers must be very mild because my first two batches ended up basically (delicious) sweet mustard.  Third batch I added a few Jalapenos, it ended up a little hotter, but not much.  Have a batch on the stove now using about half and half  Banana peppers and Jalapenos, all with their seeds.  Hoping it will take it to the level I want it.  As for a couple problems others have had, use some of the vinegar in the blender when processing the peppers, works great!  For the clumping flour problem, do the same thing, adding some of the mustard mix with the flour and water (and I use a little more water).  It is then a better temp to add to the rest.  If you still have clumps,  just put it all through the blender (after cooling some), re-heat it and finish.  I also cut the sugar by half.

All in all, a good and easy to make recipe. 

I did a half batch.  I used a variety of different peppers that I foraged from my friends garden and added some Sriracha because I didn't find it spicy enough. I would have left some of the jalapeno ribs in had I known, but c'est la vie. In the future I think I would cut back on the amount of sugar as others had noted and I wish I had taken this advice initially. 

I also agree about the flour: make sure you add hot water and some of the cooking liquid into it to make a nice smooth paste. I found mine to be a bit more lumpy than I had wanted, so I threw it into the blender to smooth it out. 

Enjoy!

I came across this recipe about 6 years ago when I had planted some sweet banana pepper plants and I ended up with hundreds of peppers. I also make the hot banana pepper mustard. I thought a pint was a cup and by accident I doubled the honey(I use local honey).  I sell at our local farmers markets and people love both. I'm in south Louisiana and I find more people purchase the hot version more than the sweet. I also only use peppers I grow myself or from other local vendors. At the end when the flour/water mixture is added I turn the heat off add mixture and use a hand blender for the 5 minutes or until smooth.

I don't think I've ever had so many compliments from something I've made.  Back on here today to copy the recipe for someone a whole state away!  I had more compliments when I added extra jalepenos the second go round.

Wasn't sure how many stars to give, since I attempted to make a partial batch of this. I did follow the directions completely, and used the AR adjustments to the amount of ingredients. Everything was going fine until I added the flour and water mix. It clumped up like dumplings. A lot of wasted ingredients and time spent preparing jars and the peppers. I read where you could use something called Clear Jel instead of the flour, but I cannot find it in a reasonable amount; I don't  need a pound of it, which costs about $10. I will look for another recipe.

All in all, a success. Made this yesterday for Christmas gifts. My peppers were on average, longer than 5 inches so I ended up with more than the recipe says so I started filling up whatever mason jars I could find. Generally, banana peppers aren't terribly hot so I didn't bother with gloves when I was cleaning and prepping the peppers. When I started food processing the peppers, however, I started having a very intense reaction - sneezing and couldn't have my face near the chopped peppers without a face mask. Then after finishing, when my hands felt on fire, I realized I had what felt like a chemical burn on my hands. I never knew before yesterday that capsaicin burn was even a thing. It still hurts the next day when I put pressure on them or get them wet. So if you end up with a batch of super hot peppers like we did, wear gloves and perhaps be prepared for some consequences. The mustard is pretty good - but quite spicy. I would have preferred to use a more mild batch of peppers.

I don't write reviews.... this is worth a review! Great recipe to use up peppers left over from salsa canning. My peppers were hot so this has quite a kick.  I used my good old Tupperware shaker for the flour and water after letting the mixture cool for just a few minutes and had no lumps. Great with pita chips!

I love how everyone says they made it just like the recipe says, but changed a bunch of things! Anyway, I added 1 more cup of sugar. Then I used low sugar fruit pectin in the powdered form, instead of flour and water. No lumps, whatsoever! Nice and thick, too. It tasted great.

I labeled my jars as Jalapeño Honey Mustard because though it is hot, it is sweet.  Per another reviewer's suggestion, I mixed it to taste with sour cream.  This mixture is great for making tuna fish salad.

Well, after reading many of the reviews I had to just try this for myself.  I took all the suggestions from everyone, and also purchased at the Farmers Market sweet and spicy banana peppers.  I made 1/2 a batch  thinking that I have nothing to loose if it didn't turn out.  
I added 4 Jalapeño peppers, 4 cloves of garlic, 1 red pepper, half reg sugar and half brown sugar.  When I did add the flour, it still clumped on me, but I used my sauce small blender in the pot and it was all good.  
This turned out to be the best mustard and I am looking forward to making more this coming weekend- foot ball season is around the corner and I can't wait to serve it up- thank you to everyone and all their suggestions. !!

This mustard has a great taste, but it was a little too sweet for me.  Next time, I'll cut the sugar back a little bit.  I made 1/3 of a batch, and I followed the recipe exactly except that I used hot banana peppers from a jar because I couldn't find any fresh ones at the local market.  Also, I had the same clumping problem as everyone else.  I couldn't even get it smooth with a whisk, so I had to put everything back in the food processor to get rid of the clumps.  Overall, it turned out really tasty, and I will be making it again with a slight adjustment with the sugar.

I made this last night, and let me tell you, it is absolutely amazing!  I had no trouble with any lumps, clumps or any other issues. I have already shared several jars and they want to buy some from me! The thing about this you can kick it up if you want or have it mild, your choice.  I would not change a thing!  Thanks peachypie for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I've made this recipe for 2 summers now and let me tell you, I can't keep enough around to enjoy myself!  I now have friends asking me when I will be making it again.  I adjusted the recipe a bit by cutting out the sugar altogether and using Splenda Blend instead so a diabetic friend could try it. The back of the bag says if a recipe calls for 1 cup of sugar, use 1/2 cup of Splenda Blend.  I cut the amount of sugar down to 4 cups in the original recipe so I use 2 cups of the Splenda Blend when making a full recipe and it is perfect, with just enough sweetness. And I have also thrown in whatever kind of hot peppers we have on hand, even habaneros which gave the mustard a good kick.  Last year when I made this was my first attempt at canning too and now you can't stop me!  I just canned 6 half-pints of hot pepper relish yesterday!

I just made this recipe for 52 servings since I only had 15 banana peppers.  It tastes great but I had a problem with the flour being too lumpy so I had to put the entire batch back into the blender.  Also the recipe doesn't mention how much head space to leave and 3 out 4 half-pint mason jars didn't seal properly.  I would have rated it 5 stars if that key info had been included.

Can I just say.....LOVE IT!!! I see some mentioned the flour not blending in. I added a little at a time, wisked it in, and then added more. That seemed to help with the blending. Great recipie, thanks!!

excellent!  we used it as a pretzel dip and on ham sandwiches.  definitely puts use to the peppers coming out of our garden!  i'm going to be making this recipe with some hotter peppers next time for those that think they can handle it!

Very good.  Next time, I will add less sugar and maybe a habanero or two to kick up the heat a bit.
