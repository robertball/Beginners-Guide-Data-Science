This recipe was so easy, and the onion rings tasted so good.  Next time I'm going to try to stick dry mix on there first so that maybe when the onion rings are done frying there will be more breading left on the actual onion ring.  Overall - Tasted Wonderful!

We found these to be extremely bland.  We ended up rolling the finished product in cajun seasoning just to get some flavor on them.  We probably will give it one more try though, but we will be adding a bunch of our own spices to it.

This recipe was very good.  However, I recommend not using a basket fryer for cooking them as the batter gets stuck in the basket making it very difficult to get the onion rings out.

This recipe is awesome!  I have made it many times since I found it...they look and taste like onion rings from a restaurant.  I put about half the batter (before dipping) in a container and freeze it for use on another night.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I used an entire can of beer (minus a sip)and added salt to the batter. Good texture! Thanks!

I was looking for "The recipe". I have tried many batters, and I am afraid to say I'm still on the look out. The batter tasted bland. The batter stuck to the onions nicely until after they were cook then they fell off the onions as we were trying to eat them. Very messy to eat. It is missing something, but I just can't put my finger on it. I suppose I will keep on looking. I would not recommend this batter, but thank you for sharing as I am sure this is good to some. I am definitely not feeling the restaurant quality here.:-)

A bit bland....I added cayenne pepper to spice it up.  Also a bit hard to get the batter to stick.  I used zucchini for this recipe and some onions as well.  Overall it was okay, just make sure to spice it up.

Very time consuming and I didn't need so much onion, 2 or even just 1 large onion would have been enough. But tastes delicious.

This was really easy and really tasty. I didn't feel the need to use any additional seasonings. If you want a little crunchier onion ring: batter it, coat it in corn meal, and then fry it.

I made these for the super bowl and this recipe came out very good.  I used a whole bottle of beer, and extra flour until it was a thick pancake consistency.  I added a lot of extra spices.  Along with the salt, oregano and garlic powder, I added Jamacian Jerk seasoning, pepper and Franks red hot.  

Before coating the onions in the batter I tossed the onions with a dry seasoned flour mixture.  I used flour, chili powder, salt, pepper and garlic powder.

The only other thing I would do next time is cook the onions a litter longer becasue we like them extra crispy.  All in all an easy recipe that was a hit!

This is very good for onion rings, but did not like it for softer veggies, particularly for squash, just not right.  Definitely will use for onion rings, though I liked it better when I added a little yellow cornmeal to the batter, and did not like it too thick.  Thinner batter made them crispier.

YUM!! This batter was easy to make and actually stayed on the onions during and after frying. I used a whole bottle of Bar Harbor Blueberry beer and it gave it a really robust flavor. Batter was nice and thick too. Would definitely use again, but maybe using a fry daddy or something. I used just an inch or so of oil in a cast iron skillet. I'm thinking they'll do better if they're fully submurged in oil. Can't wait to try it on other veggies!!

this is a pretty good batter recipe to use as a base... i breaded onions and fish with this and both turned out beautiful and delicious... i agree with some of the other reviewers who noted how bland the recipe is...next time i will add some seasoned salt to the batter, to spice things up a bit!

This recipe is so good.  I always get compliments on the crunchiness of the batter.  For those of you who think it's bland, it's important to season your onion rings right when they come out of the oil, while they are still really hot.  I use a mixture of salt, pepper and a little cayenne pepper.  Yummy.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Pretty good list of core ingredients. Now to spice it up season salt/paprika/cayenne/fresh cracked black/and a dash of hot sauce. Add a little of all and taste the difference.

The recipe was good, but I added 1 and a half teaspoons of cayenne pepper to give it some kick. Also, as a person on a low sodium diet, this made a great snack food.

I also tried it with some cheese but had to add some panko breadcrumbs to make sure the cheese didnt just melt in the pan with no support.

These were pretty good. I think they were lacking something...maybe more salt? I kept forgetting to salt them as soon as i took them out of the oil. They batter was nice and thick on the onion rings. Make sure your onions are very dry, use some flour if you have to and make sure the oil is very hot. :)

The flavor of the batter was incredibly bland.  The batter also had a strange consistency that didn't coat the onions evenly.  I mixed the batter with the given measurements, and there was still dry flour in the bowl.  I ended up having to add more beer.  I'll try a different recipe next time.

Yum! In a pinch, I used Italian seasoning instead of the oregano. I was happy with the result. I also used an entire 12 oz. bottle of beer because the batter seemed too thin after only 8 oz.

Delish! A bit messy so having an assistant for your assembly line makes the job easier and quicker. If you're making a lot of these, think about putting your batches into a warm oven until the whole thing is ready to serve.

I really have to disagree with most of these comments.  I thought these were completely bland.  All I could taste was the oil and flower.  The batter stuck to the onions really well, and it cooked up  nicely, but the flavor just wasn't there.

Batter is quite tasty, and I can imagine it being really delicious on fish, but it was a little too doughy for onion rings (in my opinion).

I found the batter a little too thick, I should have opened another beer, but overall quite good. I may try the exact same batter with haddock for homemade fish and chips.

I really liked this recipe, it was delicious and added great texture to the onions. I also added more beer to the mix. However, I didn't add enough of the condiments to the batter, and they turned out somewhat bland. So don't be afraid to add enough of them!

This is a good base to start with, the best one I have tried so far.  It was a little bland so next time I will increase the seasonings. Great recipe to experiment with!

I can't believe I made onion rings.  Tried this recipe for the first time when my husband brought friends for dinner...steamed shrimp, onion rings and salad.  They loved them and they really were easy to make!

We just maed this and it was GREST.  The only thing is that you need to double the batter for the amount of onions it calls for.  Other than that it is GREAT.  Thanks Kim

There is too much flour or not enough liquids in this recipe. It was not a batter, but more like a gluey dough. I added another half cup of beer to remedy the "batter" and it was till not fluid enough to coat the rings completely with layer of batter.

The batter was a bit bland so I added lemon pepper panko bread crumbs to it and used Mickeys ale for the beer. I was  able to also use veggies like potatoes and zucchinis. However, I ended up with too much batter.

Was surprised that one onion made enough onion rings for 3 adults with leftovers.  We really enjoyed.  Used the same batter for ocean perch and it worked well.  Lots of leftover batter so I might halve the recipe next time but will definitely make again.  Thanks for the recipe.  Unlike other reviewers we didn’t find it bland but we did have to use most of the bottle of beer.

What a waste of time, energy, and resources. First off, there is no way any group of people are eating 3 WHOLE ONIONS worth of onion rings! One or two is definitely sufficient for a large group, half or less than half of an onion for a small group. Secondly, the batter instantly falls off the onions when you put them in the oil. Lastly, the batter is EXTREMELY bland. Needs more salt or seasoning or anything really. Very unsatisfying. Ended up with way more batter than I needed and threw almost all of it away when I tasted the first round of onions.

Wonderful with a few minor modifications.....  i ended up using 12 oz beer and enough milk to make a thinner batter as it was biscuit consistency without the added moisture.  Also added about a tablespoon of seasoned salt in the mixture because it was so bland.  I also put extra flour and seasoned salt in a gallon bag and shook the onion rings in it to coat them, then let them set on a plate about a half hour to dry out more before coating with the batter and frying then only a few at a time, not touching.  They are wonderful and puffy, crispy, and the batter stayed on the rings just great!  I'm definitely saving this recipe as my go-to onion ring batter!!!  Next time i'll try with veggies  :}

We loved the light and crispy batter but we added more salt and preferred a thinner batter so added more beer. Other than those small changes it is wonderfully delicious.

The first time I made it as directed but the batter seemed a little thick for my taste.  I ended up adding more liquid. The second time I add less flour to start off with and they cooked up more evenly. Also,  the recipe calls for salt and pepper to taste so I made the first onion ring and added more salt and pepper, it was a good way of doing it as to not get a super salty or over peppery ring.

I used gluten free flour,left out the oregano other then that did as written. I found that the batter did not turn out to crispy, but maybe my oil was not hot enough. Very tasty
Thank you for the recipe.

This is by far the best onion ring recipe out there. If you are looking for restaurant quality onion rings this is it. I just added some extra flavouring like a hint of chili, smoked paprika and onion powder. (Onion powder really enhances the onion flavour). I will be doing this again and again and again. :)

Like other reviewers have said, I did find these onion rings a little bland. However, a little salt sprinkled on after frying and some dipping sauces fixed that.  I'll definitely be making these again.

I was really impressed with this recipe. I've never made onion rings before and was honestly not sure how good they would turn out. They looked nothing like the picture but I was ok with that. The oregano was a bit overpowering so next time I'll cut back on that and maybe try some cumin in it, cause cumin is good in everything. Overall though this recipe was awesome, nice crisp tasty rings and I even made some green pepper strips too. They even heated up the next day in the oven really well, no restaurant rings I've ever had have done that.

This recipe was very easy and came out great with some modifications. I fried in about an inch of oil.  I used more beer than the recipe called for.  I also used more spices.  I would use this recipe again and continue to modify to get the right taste.  I also used vidalia onions which are great as onion rings.

With a few modifications, these turned out really well. I added more seasonings and a lot of hot sauce to the batter. To help the batter adhere, I floured my rings first and then dipped. I deep fried these babies and they came out golden and crispy. The coating stayed on perfectly; even after taking that first bite! Very addicting and delish. Thanks!

Eh OK - I would recommend maybe for veggies...definitely has something lacking for onion rings. Not terrible, but a bit bland.

I used this batter for both onions and freshly caught fish. I received compliments on the fish, but the onions weren't that good. I would use this recipe again for fish, but not for onions.

I really thought that these were quite bland.  It was hard to tell when they were done because they didn't really brown.  They need something, but I can't tell exactly what.  Maybe I will try it with some other veggies because I have lots left.

SCRUMPTIOUS!!  These are soooo good!  I did them in a deep fryer, and coated them really thick in batter.  They are even good as leftovers!!
