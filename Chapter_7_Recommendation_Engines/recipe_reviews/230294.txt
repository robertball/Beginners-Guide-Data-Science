This makes a lot of icing for big projects!  
Plus, using meringue powder instead of raw egg whites is definitely a safer way to eat!

Great recipe and consistency. I created different colors from the one recipe and stored in freezer zip locks. This is my new and only icing recipe. Thank you for sharing??
