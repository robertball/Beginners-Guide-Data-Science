This soup is unreal delicious; so good in fact, we didn't have any left overs. 
The only problem was roasting the carrots in the oven. I had them in there for almost an hour and they were still crispy, so I threw them in a steamer for a few minutes to speed things up. 
I also added three garlic cloves, roasted with the onion and carrots. 

Fun fact: one pound carrots works out to about 3.5 cups, roughly chopped.

Really loved this soup!  I always make as directed the first time, otherwise why use the recipe in the first place (unless of course I don't have all the right ingredients on hand).  To make it a bit thinner, just added a bit more liquid and to make it a bit spicier, added a bit more curry to taste.  This recipe is perfect for my children to eat the way that it is (not spicy and thick enough to keep the mess down).

This soup was so delicious! I  just used a regular old hand blender and it got the job done. I had to go through with several passes to get the chunks smooth, but it was well worth the effort. Flavourful and perfect.

Carrots were still fairly hard but nothing my Vitamix couldn’t handle! Needed to double up the spices and salt. Absolutely delicious.

Super tasty, super easy. I simmered until tender some grated carrots left over from another dish, and used onion powder. I'll try it another time as written since the caramelization from oven roasting would add a different dimension.

I made this exactly as written and it was delicious. My curry blend was spicy and that was a nice complement to the sweetness of the carrots. Very delicious.

Delicious! First time making any kind of carrot soup. I had yellow and orange carrots, thus the light color. I’m not one for measuring, so may have put more carrots than it called for. I had to put about two cups of broth to get the consistency I wanted. I also did not have raw cashews, so used roasted ones. And I boiled the carrots in vegetable stock.

Beautiful soup.  I added a bit more stock to make it easier to blend. Delicious!

Well, I decided to steam the carrots instead of roasting them.  I forgot the timer, and my pan bottom scorched, giving the carrots a nice smoky flavor. ??. I made another mistake and didn’t use Asian coconut milk, but an American brand.  It was supposed to be unsweetened, but it was too thin and not enough coconut flavor. Next time I’ll be more careful and update my review.

This was delicious!  I needed a pureed soup that I could eat just lukewarm, as I had a tooth extracted today. This was yummy enough to forget about the pain. 

I did make a few changes, though. I cooked the carrots and onions in the broth in a saucepan  rather than  roasting the vegetables. And I omitted the cashews. I want to try this again with the cashews and under circumstances that allow me to try the soup hot. I'm also going to see how this freezes. I've love it if I'd be able to package it up in single servings for the freezer that I could take out for lunches.

It was missing something.  Can't put my finger on it though.  I made it with organic turkey bone broth and fresh tumeric and ginger root and added some fresh garlic.  Still something is lacking.  But it is a nice soup.

Liked it very much, but can't deal with putting on the oven on a hot day, so I put the carrots and stock in the pressure cooker (a pan and lid will do) and cooked them that way.

I made this just as the recipe said and it was delicious! I added fresh chopped ginger and next time will add a bit more fresh ginger and a bit more curry as we like the heat.

Wonderful!  Tasty and easy to make.  Will do it again and maybe experiment with some green onions too.
