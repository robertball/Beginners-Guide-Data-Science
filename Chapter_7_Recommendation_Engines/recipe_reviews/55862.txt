Recipe submitter popping in to say, fresh fennel would change the flavor quite a bit but would probably be a great addition. Might add to immune boosting too, same with anything in the onion/garlic family. Celery root is a big round ugly lumpy beige root, usually about the size of a grapefruit.  It's a specialty veg, might have to ask your store to order.  Can be kind of expensive -- I usually only buy it for holidays -- but it's a nice addition to soups and mashes.

This was good. Well seasoned. Unfortunately, I made a special trip to a grocery store 20 minutes away to buy celeriac and when I got home I found out it was fennel. Oh well. I was disappointed but made due. I just chopped some celery fine and added it with the onions. I don't know what celeriac would add to this soup because it was good without it. This was not too salty, not too winey, just right. You'll have to cook the onions a long time to get them right (about a half hour) but that's important. The roasted garlic butter was a great touch.

I love this soup and the celeriac really makes it something different! I use only beef broth and put fresh parsley in.  I also cut the onions into long thin strips before sauteing which gives the soup a great texture! This has become my standard soup to make when someone's sick, since the garlic (I put a whole head in) and onions make great immune boosters!

My husband absolutely LOVED this soup!  I had purchased some celeriac and came across this recipe by using the "ingredient search" function. What luck!  This was an easy, tasty and unique approach to a classic soup.  I was sceptical at first about adding red wine, but the flavor it added was rich and hearty. I didn't have any beef stock on hand, so I used 3 cups of chicken broth, 1 cup of water and 2 beef bullion cubes.  It turned out fine, though perhaps a little salty.  I'll try using beef broth (or just one bullion cube) next time.  I used Gruyere to melt atop the soup, which melts nicely and isn't a strong as "Swiss" cheese.

Wonderful. Didn't have red wine on hand but added a bit of vinegar and sugar. Also two small hot peppers to spice it up. Served with a chicken in buttery olive sauce, this made a heavenly Sunday lunch. Luckily here in my village in France we have a local farmer's market where celeriac is the single least expensive item per weight. Merci!

This is a nice soup and the celeriac adds a nice fresh flavour to it. The onions and celeriac need to be cooked for at least 30 minutes or longer to get them nice and golden.

I wanted to love this recipe, and I actually thought it was quite good, but no one in my family was very enthusiastic about it. It smelled great simmering this afternoon. Used gluten-free French rolls as we have celiac family members, the underside disintegrated into the soup, but it made it kind of like a ribolitta. The taste of the celeriac was complimentary, but I don't think I would go the Cajun seasoning route again.

I didn't enjoy this recipe.  If I were to make it again, I would thinly slice the onions and celeraic, not chop them.  I assumed they would dissolve more being chopped.  Instead I had chunky, almost stew-like soup.  Maybe increase the beef or vegetable broth to help with that.

Incredible!  I had a chance to get Celeriac at the local Farmers Market, and was wanting a great first recipe to use.  Glorious!

I followed the instructions as closely as I could - all I changed was I didn't make the roasted garlic butter and I didn't have Cajun seasoning so only added some cayenne pepper and chili powder. Oh, I also added the chopped garlic to the onions and celeriac while they were saut√©ing.  This recipe turned out very tasty and everyone loved it (me not that much, but I think it was just my taste preference).  Apparently it's a very French cuisine taste (as it should be).  Next time I think I might blend a bit of the soup to make it a little thicker, but perhaps that could be sacrilege for a French onion soup. Thanks for the recipe!
