I sprinkled a handful of chocolate chips in the bottom of a ready made pie crust before adding the filling and it was delicious...and fast. Two pies ready for the oven in less than10 min, and they baked up beautifully.  This recipe is a keeper.

This was an incredibly easy recipe. My six yo pretty much made the whole thing (except the oven)I've never had a pie like it. It is sweet and if you like traditional pies (shoefly,pecan,chess,etc.)you will like this.Some type of maple addition might make a good variation.

Although this looks like a pecan pie, it tastes like an oatmeal cookie. I only used 1/2c white sugar but added in 1/4c brown sugar.  Also, I used "Basic Flaky Pie Crust" from this site and the final product was very good. Its only been 12 hours since I pulled this out of the oven and its 3/4 gone! I think adding a few chopped nuts of your choice might be a good variation. Thanks for the unique pie recipe Jenny!

I was kinda leary of this at first, but wanted to make something quick for  dessert and my hubby LOVED it. Ate the whole pie in 2 days! And has been begging for it again every since.
Making it again tonight :)

This got great reviews at a church "pie night." I made it first because my mom loves pecan pie, but isn't supposed to eat nuts now. It really does taste very similar to a pecan pie. And, it's very easy to make.

Honestly, I made this pie because I liked the name, and I like to make fun of my redneck family. Little did I know, this will be one of my favorite baked pies. Will defiantly make for thanksgiving this year.

Even my husband, who doesn't like oatmeal, enjoyed this recipe!  I took another reviewer's advice and added semi-sweet chips on the bottom of this pie, but I think I added too much.  Maybe only 2-3 ounces would be a better ratio?  Will keep tinkering with this one!

This is a great recipe...my husband LOVES it and has added it to his list of #1 All-Time Favorite Desserts :).  I have substituted vegetable oil for the margarine with no difference in taste.  I also found it didn't make much of a difference if the vanilla is left out.  Thanks for the excellent recipe!

I like this pie, but do think it is too sweet. I've tinkered with adding less sugar and adding a little flour to help thicken it. I've also tried simply adding less sugar. Neither of those worked perfectly. I might try tinkering a little more, because I really do like it. I just wish it wasn't quite so sweet.///Update: on a side note, I had real pecan pie this summer (I live overseas), and this is not even a close substitute. I still like this pie, but can't compare it to pecan.

I wanted to make a quick pie with things I had on hand and this was great!  It was darker than I expected so I thought I burnt it but it was delicious.

Pretty good. Gave my boyfriend a chance to see what pecan pie tastes like since he's allergic to nuts.

I was looking forwards to this recipe, because I'm always looking for new nut-free recipes (my son is allergic), and this seemed like a good substitute for pecan pie. Unfortunately, this did not go over too well...I think that it was way too sweet, and without the pecans to cut the sweetness, there was no balance. Don't get me wrong...people ate it, but it took quite a while for this pie to disappear.

I didn't think this tasted much like pecan pie, and it wasn't sweet enough.  Overall it was bland and unsatisfying.

Very fast to make and does taste good. However my family didn't find it to be outstanding.  I may make this again in a time crunch.

I added the chocolate chips as suggested and the pie turned out really well.  Without some extra flavor like the chocolate or nuts, I think the pie would have had great crunch and texture but bland flavor.

This pie sounded great and even smelled wonderful while baking, but the flavor was bland and it tasted nothing like pecan pie.  I took it to a dinner for 12, and it was 12 thumbs down for this recipe.

This is a good substitute for those who can't eat nuts anymore.  It isn't as sweet as most pecan pies. I like that.  It is a cross between a pecan pie and an oatmeal cookie. Even though there's no cinnamon, the impression is oatmeal cookie.  The oatmeal became softer as it set.  My pie is completely gone 12 hours later.  Good, but not what I was expecting.
