I made these chops tonight.  Whew, they were so yummy.  I tweaked the recipe a little bit.  I cored and peeled 2 Red Delicious apples and sliced them up very thinly.  Then I peeled
and sliced 2 onion.  I sautéed them in a skillet with a little bit of olive oil, salt and pepper while the pork chops were browning.  I also added the sherry to the apple cider
concentrate.  When the chops were ready to go into the oven, I poured the Worcestershire sauce over them and then about 2/3 of the cider concentrate/sherry mixture.  Then I spooned the sautéed apple/onion mixture over the chops.  I sprinkled about 1 Tbs. of Worcestershire sauce over that, and then poured the remaining cider concentrate/sherry mixture over that.  The chops I used were rather thick, so I baked them for 35 minutes.  My husband gobbled them up and said I could make them again anytime.  A keeper for sure, thank you.

This recipe is very easy and tasty. I did not have frozen cider and used regular apple cider, and they came out delicious and moist. Cooked 375 for less than 20 minutes. Forgot to add sherry and still great. The more you season the chops, the better they are. Great combination of spices. Served with mashed sweet potatoes and buttured white acorn squash (which i decided I like better than the green acorn squash). I will definitely make again, and thanks for tasty, quick recipe for pork chops.

My husband loved this!  I did make a few small changes.  I didn't have poultry seasoning, so I used seasoning salt.  Also, I did not have cider concentrate, so I also used regular cider.  It seemed to work fine for me.  Last, I thought I had sherry in my pantry, and surprise, DH used the last of it a week ago.  So I substituted white wine vinegar, and we really enjoyed the flavor.  I noted that previous reviews said the sauce did not thicken, so I added about 1tsp. of cornstarch, and it mixed it well.  Thickened nicely.  I served this with rice pilaf, and it really complimented the gravy.

Everyone in the family loved this recipe.  I made a few substitutions though...I used apple cider and two tblsp of apple butter instead of apple cider concentrate, and I browned the pork chops after I seasoned them and dreged them in flour.  Then I took the chops out and set aside, added apple slices and half a chopped onion, to the skillet until carmelized.  After that I put the chops back in,  added the rest of the ingredients to the skillet, turned it down to low and covered it, and simmered for about 30 min or so, until done.  It made an awesome sauce! To thicken the sauce I added a bowlkick, tblsp butter melted with flour added to it until it's like a paste.  Not to sweet, just right!  Try cream sherry instead, it's way more fragrent and yummy!

My hubby went nuts over this dish.  He said I win the expert chef award!  I read all the reviews and i also wasn't able to find cider at this time of year so i added nutmeg and cinamon. I also only cooked the chops for 16 minutes in the oven since everyone said theirs was overdone and mine came out PERFECT!  I also thinly sliced apples and onions and sauteed them with the concentrate, worsheshire and sherry mixture, when the chops were almost done I brought the sauce to a rolling boil for about 4 to 6 minutes and it thickened to a sweet perfection.  My hubby said it was like having desert for dinner and he ooohh yeahed as he ate way too much of it!  Mashed potatoes is the perfect match as well!  Read all the reviews they make all the difference!

The flavor was excellent on these, but my chops, too, came out very dry as another said. I'll try this again just in the skillet without baking or maybe with much less time. My sauce thickened up well.

I made this dish for my fiance, and she thought it was the best pork chops she's ever had.  I cooked 2 chops instead of 4, but still baked for 25 minutes, so they were a tad over done- but only a little.  Otherwise, it was perfect, and we will definitely be having them the next time we host a dinner party.

WOW...this recipe is fantastic!!  My significant other loves pork and I'm always looking for different ways to prepare it so that it does not become dry.  The pork loin chops were tender and juicy and the sauce and seasonings only enhanced the flavor.  When I first found this recipe, I was afraid that 25 minutes in a 375 degree oven would dry the pork loin chops out, but the apple cider helps to keep them moist.  An absolutely perfect, no-fuss meal...I served this with a spinach salad and garlic mashed potatoes.

Fantastic -- my family loved it!  I didn't have seasoning salt, so I used a celery salt instead.  I couldn't find apple cider concentrate, so I used regular apple juice concentrate, and added some cinnamon and grated nutmeg.  I also cooked it entirely on the stovetop.  I added the celery salt, pepper, garlic powder and poultry seasoning to some flour in a large zip-top bag, threw in some pork sirloin chops and coated them with the mixture.  (The flour probably helped my sauce thicken.)  I browned the chops, set them aside, lowered the heat a bit and added thinly sliced onions to the pan.  Once the onions were carmelized, I threw in the apple juice concentrate, cinnamon and grated nutmeg to taste, the worcestershire and the sherry and stirred it all.  I added the chops back in, covered and simmered for about 25 minutes.  When I removed the chops I let the sauce continue to simmer for only a minute or two, that was all that was needed for it to thicken up.  This was a big hit!

Excellent meal, though 25 mins seems too long to cook the pork - 20 would probably be adequate.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because I really enjoyed this dish.  I loved the contrast between the spicy and the sweet.  It makes a great sauce for dipping.  My husband, however, didn't care for the sweet taste.  That's just his personal taste...nothing wrong with the recipe.

Like everyone else, I used this recipe as a starting place.  I used thyme and sage rather than poultry seasoning, and cut down on garlic powder.  After browning the chops (I used rib chops) and removing to a plate, I sauteed sliced apples and onions until they'd softened, adding chopped garlic for the last couple minutes.  I then added the chops back into the pan and topped with a can of cranberry apple juice concentrate (rather than apple, to give it a little more zing).  I baked, covered, for 20 minutes.  The chops were flavorful and moist, and the apples and onions with sauce were great over egg noodles!  I served this with steamed broccoli and cauliflower, although it would also be great with green beans.

Very good!  I make it without the sherry, and I don't measure the spices.  Just sprinkle all the chops with a reasonable amount for good flavor.  I also just use fresh apple cider when I have it.  This has gotten rave reviews!

Easy and Great tasting recipe. I was cooking a 1.5# pork loin roast and decided to use this recipe because I had apple cider from Thanksgiving.  I seared the outside in a oven-proof pan (3 mins per side), then poured ingreds over loin and placed in oven for 30 mins. Removed and let loin rest on board.  I put the 'sauce' back on a burner on high and added the sherry.  **For those that could not get it to thicken--you reduce this on high or med/high heat for 10mins or so.  You want the sauce to BOIL...this reduces the sauce. Watch it though-it may not look thick while boiling so take it off the heat-if it coats the back of a spoon well--it's probably done. Sherry seems to have a high sugar content which will help to thicken it so if you choose not to use it, this may affect how it thickens. I added raisens-about 1/4 c. while the sauce was reducing. Yummy addition.

Easy to make for weeknight cooking.  I followed the recipe for everything except that I also sauteed a thinly sliced apple plus 1/2 a sliced onion.  Even my little kids ate up the whole thing!

I didn't have concentrate so I used actual apple cider and it was amazing.  I guess with the concentrate it would've had a stronger apple cider taste but I think with reg apple cider it was great

Thanks for a tasty, great way to cook pork.  It was quick and easy and my boyfriend and I loved the mix of flavors, the salty with the sweet and tangy.  We'll definitely be having this again.

This was absolutely delicious.  I couldn't find frozen apple cider, so I used frozen apple juice.  Also didn't have any sherry, but this was great without it.  The combination of spices and worstershire sauce was perfect.  Husband and granddaughter are good eaters anyway, but really enjoyed this one.

This is my favorite pork chop recipe!  I find that pork typically tends to dry out when baked, but the apple cider sauce keeps the chops moist and juicy!  My family loves the flavors.  I make the recipe with 8-12 oz of fresh apple cider, but I shared the recipe with my mother, who makes it with the frozen concentrate.  Both methods yield delicious results!  I have poured the sauce over a pork roast, and baked it with a few sliced apples on top.  It tastes as delicious as the pork chops!

My husband made this recipe last night (all by himself!). Initially I was very worried about the amount of Worshestershire sauce, since it is usually very strong. He made it with six chops and approximated the ingredient amounts accordingly. He did not have apple cider, so used apple juice and added some cinnamon and nutmeg to it (his idea). Then he baked it in the oven with 2 thinly sliced apples as well. Then he thickened the sauce with some cornstarch, because the suace was a little thin otherwise. Our whole family really enjoyed it and I was very pleasantly surprised (since I had been worried about the amount Worchestershire sauce)! The apple slices were a very nice touch. I am proud of my husband, because he always says "I don't like to cook" or "I don't know what to make" when it is his turn to do supper. He found it to be an easy recipe and says that he would even make it for company!!

Turned out great! As mentioned by other reviews I reduced cooking time on pork to 16minutes and it turned out great. Also added apples and onions to sauce before placing in oven.

5 Star recipe! I didn't have frozen apple cider concentrate so I used apple cider vinegar and it came out great! I didn't have any sherry but I poured the left over sauce from the pan into a cup and dipped the chops into it.

I followed the advice of CHRISTYGOBAR and skipped the oven step.  Excluded Sherry because hubby did not want to spend the money.  Used Motts Natural unsweeeted apple juice.  Turned out delicious.

Really good!  Store did not have frozen condensed apple cider so had to use regular apple cider.  Can't wait to try it with the condensed cider.  I added apple slices to the gravy before baking.  It was really good!

The apple flavor was lost to the W. sauce, and, like several others found, the baking time was too long, because the chops were overdone and tough.  Will not make again.

We thought these pork chops were good and will probably make them again.  I don't cook with alochol so I didn't add the sherry and I didn't add anything in it's place, just cooked the juice down.  It doesn't really thicken as you might expect with most sauces but the moisture evaporates leaving a concentrated sauce that is a good compliment to the chops.

Very good recipe, but had to be tweaked as many have mentioned. I used regular apple cider, (use less and add more worcestershire sauce if you want it less sweet) didn't put it in oven, but browned pork chops (with seasonings, I added rosemary) on medium-high heat on stove top then let it simmer (covered) with worcestershire sauce and apple cider approx 10-15 minutes. Didn't need sherry!

This wasn't bad but it wasn't good.  The apple flavor is completely lost underneath the Worcestershire and poultry seasoning.

This was excellent! I made it just as the recipe said and all the flavors are so good together. I made a recipe not long ago with apple juice and my husband didn't care for it so I was concerned about this one but with the different seasonings it was a huge hit with everyone :)

I've made this recipe twice so far. The second time I decided to brine the pork chops in a bowl of ice water with 1 tbsp/cup each of salt and sugar and a dozen peppercorns for 6 hours. Wow, what a difference it makes for the meat! So moist and full of flavor. I used bottled apple cider reduced in a saucepan and added a chopped onion to the frying pain before adding the chops but otherwise followed the recipe. (no extra salt needed because of the brine). Very, very good. My family loved it. Thanks.

This was very good although the kids didn't enjoy as much as I thought they would.  I used spicy apple cider instead of concentrate because that's what I had on hand.  Also reduced the cooking time as suggested by other reviewers. The pork chops were moist and the flavor of the sauce was outstanding. Will probably make again when the kids aren't around.

Made this for dinner tonight-it was excellent! Used what I had on hand, so I  used just regular apple cider, instead of the apple cider concentrate, and did not add the sherry at the end. My husband and 18 month old son enjoyed it as well! Will have this again; a nice change from regular 
shake n bake pork chops!

I love, love, love one pan recipes. Made this entire dish in a cast iron skillet.  And, I loved, loved, loved the flavor of this.   I made two modifications.  First, I used cider vinegar because it is what I had in the house.  Second, I seasoned the chops with a hot pepper flake blend because I wanted to kick it up a notch.  I also was worried about the chops drying out, so I covered them for the first ten minutes of cooking.  I never thought about seasoning chops with poultry seasoning, but I think that is was made this super good.  I am going to make this again.  So very quick and easy and yummy.

I always use the suggestion of slicing up two red delicious and two onions and sauteing them and adding them to the apple cider mix.  I also have used fresh apple juice/cider by just juicing apples with my juicer. So So yummy a real winner!  Thank you!!

Made this tonight for a dinner party. Reduced the apple cider in a pan (no such thing around here as the frozen concentrate).. this worked well.  Used thyme, and marjoram instead of poultry seasoning.  Everyone raved about it.  BUT, I was not happy with how tough the pork chops became after pan searing them.  Grilling them first before baking them like another reviewer mentioned would have made the difference.

I made these last night and they were a huge hit! Apple cider was no where to be found however, so I used Apple Juice concentrate instead. I only baked them in the oven for 20 minutes so as not to overcook them and they came out perfect! I served them with some garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus and everyone gobbled them up! In fact, I had to make a second batch because everyone wanted more.

Made this once before a while ago, but it wasn't as successful as tonight's dinner, as I actually had all the ingredients this time.  Didn't have apple cider concentrate, so I simmered 24oz apple cider until it reduced to 8oz.  Sauteed 2 onions and some garlic too.  Everyone loved these pork chops.

We had this last night, it was amazing. I did change it a bit it was too hot to turn on the stove so I through the chops on the grill (thin cut bone in) I based them with the cider olive oil and a teaspoon of Worshire and the spices. Then in a pan made the reduction. It was a bit sweet so I added a bit more worshire. IT was GREAT! Thanks so much

I changed a few things.  I used apple cider instead od the condensed version.  I also used apple cider vinegar.  Before sauteing them, I sliced open the pork chops and added an apple stuffing.  Then I seasoned the oil with cinnamon, nutmeg and garlic powder.  I put in the over and half way through I turned over.  I cooked them for about 20 minutes.  I also drizzled the sauce over a few times while in the oven.  At the end while on the stove I added corn starch and had to quickly stir. It became thick fast and was a great sauce!

This pork chop recipe is fantastic!  I skipped the step of putting the skillet into the oven and simply threw a lid on the skillet and let the pork simmer in the cider after I had browned them up.  it helped the sauce cook longer and saved a lot of extra time.  I didn't need to thicken up the sauce - it became a nice glaze after it cooked down by about 3/4.    I cooked and served it with a chopped apple and that was a really tasty addition.  I served this with some carrots and wild rice and my husband and I both really enjoyed the meal.

This was a wonderful recipe but I modified it for the grill.  I made up all the ingredients except substituted frozen apple juice for cider and red wine for sherry.  I put it all in a bag and added the chops (after poking them a few times with a tenderizer) for an hour or so.  I grilled them and then boiled the marinade adding a tablespoon of corn starch mixed with a little wine until thick.  I also added salt to taste and served it over the steaks.  A nice, sweet sauce on a tender pork steak. All four of the men in my family loved it.  I will be making this again.

My husband and I just love this recipe.  We usually share a thick porck chop.  We cook this in a cast iron skillet and are able to put it right in the oven. Even using a thick pork chop we still only cook it the 20-25 minutes.  It continues to cook while the sauce thickens.  We serve the sauce over mashed potatoes.  I always get rave reviews when I cook this for friends.

The sauce came out very sticky and way too sweet and the pork was just a little overdone. Should've read the reviews beforehand. Would have been better with apple cider (not concentrate) with cornstartch added if needed and baked for 20 minutes. Flavors together (worcestershire and apple) were delicious though. Will definitely make again with modifications. Quick and easy recipe!

Sooo Good!  I used fresh cider which I reduced and didn't have any sherry on hand so I improvised.  I thickened the sauce by mixing a little cornstarch and water and whisking it into the simmering sauce.  Then once it was at the consistencey I wanted, I removed it from the heat and added half and half.  WOW- was this a hit with my family- even the pickiest eater loved it!  Thanks!

I feel bad giving this a 4. It probably would have been a 5 if I had had the correct ingredients. I used apple cider but not apple cider concentrate. Probably would have had a stronger flavor. And I forgot to put in the sherry. In any case, it was really good and the whole family liked it.

This was really Yummy :) my husband really liked it too! I changed a few things though, I didn't have worc. sauce so i put in wine vinegar, but the smell made me nervous with how strong it was lol so i put some garlic chunks in there and 'Mrs. Dash' and lemon pepper on them too. I also didnt see that I needed sherry until I already cooked it so i didn't use that and used regular apple cider. So made quite a few changes but it was still really yummy!!!

My husband used this recipe for a women's banquet at church.  It was a great success.  He fed 120 and instead of doing this in the form of pork chops he cooked them as loins and then sliced them when they were cooked.  We omitted the sherry for the banquet but we loved the flavor when we cooked it for the trial run.

Very good!  I couldn't find the frozen apple cider concentrate so just used apple juice concentrate. I prepared only 2 pork chops (boneless) and cooked for only 20 minutes. Hubby loved it. Will definitely make this again!

I made it exactly as written with the exception of the apple cider. I used apple juice 12 oz. frozen (never found or even saw frozen cider before). The sauce didn't thicken maybe because of the extra juice or the fact it was juice and not cider but who cares, I eat prime rib with au jus and it isn't a thick sauce. I tell you this was a huge hit even without the cider. I just dribbled it on the chops (well, ok...it was so good it ended up as a pool across the chops and potatoes) and it was very very good. I will make this again...I do not plan on changing any part of the recipe (just using juice instead of cider because I can't find cider). Thanks!

The current recipe calls for way too long for cooking the chops. They came out well done and dry (even with the sauce). I would cut way back to 10-12 mins on baking time. Couldn't find frozen apple cider, but used concentrate apple/raspberry blend which works fine. Also, takes forever to burn down sauce so if you're in a hurry, use some cornstarch & a little water and add to sauce. Thickens right up. I will make again with these changes. But with the current recipe, only rates 3 stars in my book.

The taste seemed a bit "off"....I like applesauce with pork chops, so thought the cider would give it a rich flavor. I felt it was more of a sweetened pork flavor. The onions were a hit, but I'd pass on the cider next time and stick with apples on the side.

Really excellent.  I don't have a skillet that can go in the oven, so I preheated a casserole dish and transfered from the skillet to that.  Then I had the skillet warm and ready for when the chops were done in the oven.  I followed other's advice and reduced the cooking time to 20 minutes.  Chops were perfect.  It was taking a long time for the sauce to thicken, so I used a little cornstarch.

This was phenomenal.  Like many others, I didn't have access to frozen apple cider, so I added a dash of nutmeg and cinnamon.  All four of my kids (most of whom are picky eaters) gobbled this up.  They even asked if we had leftovers so that they could have it again.

We just finished up the chops - well, we have leftovers, so we're looking forward to those!  I also did not have/couldn't find apple CIDER concentrate so used apple juice concentrate.  And it came in 12 oz instead of 8, so I made a few extra chops, but the sauce didn't thicken like I thought it should - a bit of cornstarch and water fixed that right up.  We served it with some butternut squash and onions cooked down in butter, which I thought complimented the sweetness of the sauce nicely.  We'll definitely use this recipe again!  I like the flour-dredging idea too - maybe next time!  Thank you!

Pretty good! My husband and I enoyed this dish very much. However, I did make a few alterations to use the ingredients that I had on hand. I used a 12 oz can of Apple Juice concentrate, and sprinkled a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg on the chops to compensate for not having cider. also left the poultry seasoning out, didn't have any, so just added a bit more seasoning salt. also added some onion powder to reduce a little bit of the sweetness, and should have followed the cooking time, but thought that the time wasn't long enough so I accidently cooked them just a wee bit too long. Still delish though, especially served with garlic mashed potatoes....covered with the sauce (which never did thicken) was absolutely awesome!!

This receipe was very easy to fix, however my family did not enjoy it much.  Maybe to overwelming on the Apple Cider.

This has got to be the best pork that I have ever eaten.  I did not have frozen apple cider, but luckily I had fresh apple cider in the fridge!  I didn't have sherry on hand, but next time I will make sure to try it with that as well.  The pork was tender and moist.  Delicious!!

Surprisingly delicious! My boyfriend walked in and commented "Something smells really good!" I made the recipe as written, except I didn't have any dry sherry, so as another commenter suggested, I substituted some white wine vinegar and a bit of cream sherry. I also couldn't find frozen apple cider concentrate, so I used frozen apple juice concentrate. Everything else was as stated. I was really surprised at how much my boyfriend loved it! I served it with roasted asparagus and herbed new potatoes, altho next time I may serve it over rice or noodles to enjoy more of that sauce! I'll be making it again!

This was outstanding.  The entire family loved the flavors.  I did the recommended thin sliced apples and onions, which really helped with the moisture.  We will eat his again.

Very good flavor but does not yield tender chops. Maybe I will try brining them first. Also 25 minutes baking is too long, as some others indicated. I will cook them less next time. Great with the garlic mashed potatoes.

This is a great quick recipe! I didn't have the cider concentrate but used a hard apple cider I did have and it worked very well. I only needed 15 minutes in the oven to finish cooking, and probably could've taken it out in 10-12 since I used chops instead. Very good and full of apple flavor just from the cider. Looking forward to experimenting more with this one!

Loved the sauce for these chops! I thickened it slightly with a little cornstarch. I would makes sure you reduce it enough to concentrate the flavors. I used bone in chops so they would be more tender and moist. I baked these chops 20 mins based on the other reviews. I removed them from the sauce and covered them with aluminum foil allowed them to rest while I made the sauce. Served with cinnamon apples, mashed potatoes. 
I think I would really like to try this with a pork tenderloin next time and make the sauce on the side. It would be amazing. You'd have the tenderness of the tenderloin with these delicious flavors. It's a keeper for me, thanks!

Made this recipe without changing a thing, followed it to a 'T'.  It was great except that my chops turned out very dry.  I noticed a couple others had the same problem.  I don't know if it was the cut I bought (center cut pork loin), or maybe It's because I used an electric oven which heats at a higher level than a gas stove, but next time I will set it at 350 and cover it with foil and bake for only 20 minutes. I think it is always better to find out what I did wrong before blaming the creator of the recipe.  This really was a very good recipe, thanks for sharing it with us.  I will definitely be making this again.

Flavor is AMAZING! I only tweaked the recipe a little because I could not find Apple Cider concentrate so I used Apple Juice concentrate instead. The pork chops were a little dry (overdone at 25 minutes so I suggest taking some time off.) The thick sauce you pour on top is packed with flavor. This is a keeper!

I made these pork chops tonight and they were wonderful! I followed the suggestions of OneSweetShannon below and cooked them on the stove the entire time. I also added sliced onions and apples as other reviewers suggested. The pork chops and sauce were delicious - will definitely make again!

Very tasty pork dish.  I wish I had followed the advice of other reviewers, and reduced the cooking time.  Even though it was a little dry, it got rave reviews around the table, and has already been requested again. Only issue I had is that the sauce didn't thicken after about 15 minutes of active boiling. None the less, delicious!

Like several others, I used fresh cider.  I also used my food processor to thinly slice up two apples and one very large onion, which I heaped on top of the chops when I added the cider.  I cooked it all on the stove top.  The chops were as tender as any I've had.  Even those who aren't big pork chop fans loved this.  Quick and easy, I'll make it again and again.

I made this for dinner this evening as was written with the exception of using fresh apple cider that I bought today at the farmers market. My family was quick to comment that this is a winner and will be making this agaiin for the rest of my family members. I served it with mashed potatoes and spinach..Thanks for this fantastic easy recipe!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I made this along with the Red Chard and Caramelized Onions recipe (also on this site) and roasted red potatoes. Went along with the sauteed onions and apples on top as several other posters did. I also used regular apple cider rather than concentrate. Delicious!

Great chops!!  The gravy especially made then and mashed potatoes, as recommended, was a perfect side!  I could find the apple cider concentrate so I used regular apple cider like MHBMHB recommended and followed her tip on reducing the time, cooked 3 chops for a reduced time of 18 minutes.  I used the tbsp butter/flour trick melabee suggested to help thicken the gravy faster, worked very well!!

This was excellent. We wanted to try something different for thanksgiving so we made this for our dinner instead of turkey. I didn't have any sherry on hand so I substituded it for some grape raspberry frozen juice I had at home. I haven't made it with the sherry yet, so I have nothing to compare to, but it was amazing! Everyone loved them and we had nothing left at the end of the night!

Very easy dish to make and the sauce is quite tasty. I took others advice and adjusted the coooking time in the oven so they wouldn't overcook and added thinly sliced apple and onion as the sauce cooked. Definetely will make this again

We made this exactly as written; we always do the first time we try something new.  Anyway, the sauce didn't thicken, so I left it on medium-high heat to boil and by the time I went to pour it on the chops, it had virtually carmelized to the point of being like a candy apple coating!  Fortunately, the juices from the chops blended well with some of the sauce, so it wasn't a bomb at all!  We really enjoyed the flavors, but next time, I'll pay closer attention to the sauce's consistency.  Great flavors, great recipe - thanks!!

I was determined to stick exactly to this recipe so I could give an honest review based on the actual recipe.  Well, I failed..lol.  Like so many others stated, I couldn't find frozen apple cider so I used a container of frozen apple juice concentate.  I also didn't have poultry seasoning so I used  1/2 teaspoon each of sage, rosemary, thyme & marjoram.  After baking the chops (15 mins. would've been plenty), I added the sherry and boiled away.  The aroma of worcestershire was really strong so I added a 4oz. cup of unsweetened applesauce to the liquid.  Also, like many others, I did use cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  The end result?  Absolutely delicious!  Based on my own personal tweaks, it was 5 stars but without them, I feel the 4 stars is good.  It's all a personal preference. One note- I made 10 smaller, boneless chops and had plenty of sauce.

This was a very easy recipe to make.  The pork chops were very tender and juicy.  I didn't have any sherry so I used more of the apple cider.  I aslo sauted apples and onions and put them on top of the pork chops.

This IS yummy! Made a few changes~didn't use the poultry seasoning or sherry. Dredged chops in seasoned flour first. Also browned some apple slices, which I put on top of chops, then added hard cider and simmered on stove top. Keep aneye on liquid while simmering~the cider quickly evaporates. Served with mashed and acorn squash.

The sauce was delicious, but the chops came out hard and overcooked.  It could be my oven.  I'll definitely try this again, but with less cooking time.

Loved it!  I did what others recommended.... I sautéed an onion and a thinly sliced apple (did this in the same pan I browned the meat in to cut down on dish washing) and put that on top on the chops to bake in the oven.  Also couldn't find frozen apple cider so I used frozen concentrated apple juice and added a dash or two of cinnamon and nutmeg.  Only baked In the oven for 15 minutes.  Served with mashed potatoes and roasted baby carrots.  Fantastic dinner and a cinch to make in no time at all.

I found this recipe to be Very Bland.  I followed all the directions except I sliced a Granny apple and a small onion and stir fried them in the same pan as the pork and followed with the rest of the ingredients but it didn't seem to have the flavor I expected.  I will not be making this again.

I made this and its super easy, and quick. Although during the process I was making home poultry seasoning and in a blonde moment I forgot to put it on. Even so the chops turned out delicious. This is a keeper for sure.

Followed recipe as directed.  Didn't have apple cider concentrate so reduced apple cider to half and added 1 T apple butter to mimic the concentrate flavor.  I don't rate recipes that I did more than one substitution.  It no longer is the recipe but a different version altogether. This is delicious and screams fall comfort food.  
Thanks for posting!  It's a keeper for sure!

I think I messed it up somehow. I didn't brown the meat enough and it was kind of dry. Probably wouldn't try again, just because I'm not sure how to do it right.

I could not find the cider concentrate but found some sparkling cider. I cooked it all on the stove top ...after browning, I  didn't measure the cider just poured it on and let it cook....about 20 minutes. Took chops out, boiled sauce a few minutes with sherry. Added a bit of corn starch to thicken and served chops over jasmine rice with sauce. My daughter and I don't like chops and we loved this recipe...my man loved it too! Yummy!

This was as excellant recipe.  My boyfriend said it was restaurant quality a dish to be prepared with company.  He loved the garlic mashed potatoes.  A real southeren dish.  I read all the reviews before preparing this recipe and did like the cream sherry.  I would also cook this for probably 18min.  I cooked it for 20 and it was slightly tough.

This is very nice.  I reduced and thickened apple juice and did it all on the stove, and added / cooked apple slices.  I like that it is quick and simple.  Nice flavors.  I don't think it would be worthy of repeating without the apple slices.  Thanks for a good starter.

I didn't use frozen cider but opted for a nice brand of jarred, Martinelli's  Apple Cider. Followed the recipe accordingly but for two thick loin chops. I did throw in some sliced onion while browning the meat for added texture and flavor. Last minute I added a dash of liquid smoke. I used a cast iron skillet, and baked for 20 minutes, turning half way. Probably could have cut back a couple of minutes for more pink....I did have to thicken the juices a bit with cornstarch. Served with sautéed apples, mashed potatoes, green beans and coleslaw. The Man was pleased....

I loved the mix of flavors with these pork chops.  Like everyone else I could find no apple cider concentrate so used apple juice concentrate with a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg thrown in. I cooked this all in the skillet, and even with thick bone in chops it required only 18 minutes.  I thickened the sauce with corn starch and did not use sherry and didn't miss it.  The sauce went wonderfully over potatoes. I will definitely be making these again.

I used equal parts garlic powder, Lawry's seasoned salt, poultry seasoning, cinnamon, & pumpkin pie seasoning for the rub.  After rubbing both sides of chops, I browned both sides in olive oil, then added the apple cider, put the lid on the pan, turned the heat to medium, and cooked for about 25 minutes, turning halfway through.  Both sides were carmelized and delicious!

I didn't have any poultry seasoning but have a nice herb garden so I was able to make my own poultry seasoning which came out great. This is a very nice recipe and I received compliments from all.

Followed the recipe as stated only substituting soy for Worchesire  sauce since I was out. I didn't like it and neither did my husband. The sauce isn't good for over rice or potatoes. Too intense. Pork, although I tenderized it still came out too dry. Wouldn't try this again.

Since I don't have frozen concentrated apple cider on hand, I used HARD Apple Cider because it's easy to store and I always have it available.  The hard cider is a good compliment to the dish, it works perfectly with the brandy I substituted.  True Sherry has a shorter shelf life.

This is the most interesting and unusual sauce for pork chops that I have ever tasted.  It would be great with chicken too, but I have not tried that yet.  I recommend this recipe.

My family liked this a lot. I took another reviewer's advice and thinly sliced some onions and apples  to put in. I used Granny Smiths.  Like she did, I sautéed them in olive oil first with salt and pepper, then layered them over the chops with sauce and Worcestershire. The apples really added to it I think!  I also took the suggestion of serving with mashed potatoes and it was a great combination. The sauce was a little too sweet for my taste which is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5 but it's just personal preference.  I'll definitely look for a way to make it less sweet next time around.

This is a fabulous recipe! After reading reviews I modified prep. First, I think my poultry seasoning had some kick to it, yum. I used frozen apple juice concentrate, probably not the same as cider - but hey, it worked. And finally, I did not bake it. I browned my 1 inch pork loin chops as instructed then covered and simmered for 10 minutes - which was almost too long. 
The reduction was AMAZING! 
Most importantly, it is so easy to over cook pork which will make it dry and tough. Its important to have to temperature, but check for doneness or you will be sad.

Thought this was a good recipe. I did saute onions and apples to add to the sauce, and while the sauce was very tasty on it's own, thought the addition of apples and onions was really good and  elevated the sauce. Didn't have dry sherry, used cream sherry, no problem. Did cook for the full 25 minutes in the oven, but thought that might be a bit much, the chops seemed a bit overcooked. All in all, the boys agreed they would eat it again. .

This was easy and we really liked it.  I used thin cut chops so they were a little dry.  I need to make this again with thicker chops.  I might decrease the time in the oven too.

Love this versatile recipe. Used a small pork loin fillet that was already in the freezer. Rubbed the outside with a mixture of Emeril's Essence, thyme and sage (spices I had on hand) and baked according to pkg instructions. Store didn't have frozen apple cider, so I reduced apple cider and added 1 tbl worcestershire and cornstarch to thicken. Sauce was also great over mashed potatoes.

I enjoyed it but cooked it too long in the pan to put it in the oven. I used regular sherry and apple cider not frozen. Very good but will cook less time in the pan.

I will make this pork chop/ apple cider recipe again for sure.  My fiancée said that park chops are Never this tender and juicy.  The only thing I might change is to thicken the sauce at the end; or brown the chops in light flour in addition to the seasonings listed.

I used frozen Cranberry because I couldn't find Apple Cider- I think it would have been better with the Apple, but it was very tender and simple to make.

The sauce was fantastic, but the chops came out dry. I will try it again with less time in the oven. I like to actually brown both sides of my chops for that yummy sear on the meat, so I will experiment with the cook time and use a thermometer to check when the chops are done.

I don't like eating pork, but I love eating this pork.  They came out moist and amazing.  Most pork chops I eat have a dry, tough quality.  Not these bad boys!

I made this with 5 bone-in pork chops.  I browned the chops in a frying pan, then transferred to a baking dish for the oven.  Poured the sauce over the chops and baked 30 minutes.  The chops came out perfect.  I then transferred the sauce back to the frying pan and added the sherry.  The sauce never thickened up, but was sweet on the chops.

Perfect for dinner.  I served it with rice and pasta and both were great.  I had to use apple juice concentrate  because our store didn't  have any apple cider concentrate.

Great, also used frozen apple juice concentrate which tasted well enough, will add cinnamon/nutmeg next time, might replace with real apple cider as well.

Bad: Sauce never really thickened. I cooked that sauce stirring frequently/constantly for like 10-15 min and it just never thickened. I'll try to thicken it with something else next time :/ It was a shame because the sauce IS FANTASTIC!!! But it's just liquid!!

The only change I made was that I used Marsala cooking wine instead of dry sherry simply because I didn't have it.

I don't like pork.  This was delicious!!!!! I usually find pork chops dry, and I saw a few reviews that stated as such, but I only made 2 super thick cut chops as opposed to 4 because there are only 2 of us. Maybe that made a difference. In any case, it was the MOST delicious pork dish I've ever tasted or made, and I'll make it again!! It was moist and flavorful... Absolutely delish!!!

Made this for the local senior center & it was a hit. Served with peas & carrots that we glazed and roasted with the sauce & steamed rice. Yup this one is a keeper, thanks for the recipe.

Made the recipe per the instructions, adjusted for 6.  It came out great.  It is a good recipe, and good for picky eaters (sauce or no sauce).  I would cut back on the olive oil to help with browning (could have been from the size of the pan).  I could not find frozen apple cider concentrate, so I had to go with regular apple cider.  Overall, a great recipe, will be making it again.  Q

The sauce was really good but the meat didn't have much flavor; wonder if soaking it in the sauce for a while before cooking would help.

My whole family, including young kids, loved this! We departed slightly from the recipe: we cubed the porch chops rather than cooking them whole. They weren't at all dry. I also wasn't able to find apple cider concentrate, but found some apple cherry juice and was intrigued. My sauce wasn't thickening appreciably with the sherry, so I also threw in 1-2T cornstarch mixed with an equal amount of cold water. It turned out beautifully! Would go very well with rice or stuffing.

This was so good, everyone in my family of four loved it!  I used butter in place of olive oil, added 2 gala apples and a yellow onion (softened in the skillet), used merlot in place of sherry since its what I had on hand and regular apple cider, not frozen.  Very forgiving recipe because although I followed the directions loosely it was still amazing!

i didn't make any changes but I think I may have over cooked mine. But they had a amazing flavor!  I don't know how long to cook them, could someone help me out how long should you cook pork? Every time I cook pork or chicken breast it is really dry and chewy!

Great flavor!  I did not have apple juice so I chopped up an apple, and added a little brown sugar and cinnamon.  And, I did not have any dry Sherry... so I added splash of white wine.  Sometimes you come to the site for ideas, and just make do with what you have and get lucky!

Very good! I used frozen apple juice concentrate from a can, some chopped onion and thin apple slices. Browned first, then added sauce ingredients and pressure cooked for 10 minutes. I think the Worcestershire did add to it well, so I'm glad I added it. I also took the suggestion to add a little bit of cinnamon and nutmeg. I served the chops over rice and added the sauce on top with onions and apples. I will make it again one day since my husband gave good feedback! Thank you for posting!

Tender and moist, but bland pork chop.  Hubby and I weren't wowed over this dish.  

I didn't use the sauce.  A word of caution if using apple juice/cider concentrate:  WATCH THE STOVE CAREFULLY!  There was too much sugar in the brand of concentrate I bought and the sauce burned within minutes over medium heat.

Very good. I added apples and onions while baking as well as some brown sugar to the sauce.

Sauce was amazing, easy to over cook though, be careful of your cook time.

This recipe is so easy and delicious.  My husband took one bite and asked me to make sure I had the recipe to make again.  The only changes were that I omitted the salt since the Worcester sauce has plenty and I couldn't find any frozen apple cider so I used bottled apple cider and cooked it in a pan until it was reduced and syrupy.

I made this for my family. Unfortunately, I couldn't find apple cider. I used an apple cherry juice instead. The pork chops came out a little tough. But even with the substitution they came out delicious!
