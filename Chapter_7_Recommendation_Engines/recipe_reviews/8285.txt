This cake recipe was disappointing over all. I don't think I would bother with it again without some serious alterations. For chocolate cake this had very little chocolate flavor even after I increased the number of tbls. of cocoa to 9. Also it lacks in sweetness. This cake might be good for someone who likes a less sweet cake...but one thing's for sure it DEFINITELY needs icing of some kind to provide flavor. I found the cake to be very bland and I was really disappointed with the results...come to think of it I even inreased the amount of vanilla by one teaspoon as well! Maybe also increasing the amount of sugar and using melted chocolate instead of baking cocoa would help. There are much MUCH better mayo cake recipes out there...I only gave this two stars because the texture of the cake is very nice (nice rich crumb not too moist or to dry)...and there is probably someone out there who would prefer a cake this way. If you want a traditional dark moist chocolate cake though STAY AWAY from this one!

This cake was absolutely fantastic!!!! I have made many many chocolate mayo cakes but this was absolutely the best!!! One note my cake was not done in 35 minutes so I baked it for an extra 15 minutes (50 min in all). I topped it off with raspberries and cool whip. What a hit!!!

This was a good cake for a last minute cake. We are living in France right now & had mayonnaise that had dijon mustard in it which I didn't realize til after & it still tasted fine. I'm sure it would be better without the dijon.:)

I won't try this recipe again. The taste was bland; it needed salt. The texture was dense and dry..

We've made this cake but we also add Cream of Tartar and 1/4 tsp of salt. Its my husbands mothers family recipe. It's really moist and delicious!
