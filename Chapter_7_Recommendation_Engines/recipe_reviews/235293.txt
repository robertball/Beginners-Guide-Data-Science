We will forever refer to this as The New Years Eve Pie Incident!  Yes, there WAS wine involved!  As I was sliding this (on a baking stone)out of the oven to brush it with jam,  the parchment was slippery and started to list.  When I tried to correct, I burnt my hand, jerked and completed the spill—apple side down on the oven door!  Without missing a beat, my BFF handed me a spatula and I managed to get it upright again—fully intact!  Long story short, it was delicious!  Went well with Pinot Noir!

This was nice and I will definitely make it again but with some minor adjustments. I hadn't planned on making this and was able to put it together in no time and it cooks quite fast. If you happen to already have puff pastry in your fridge or freezer then it really is a quick dessert to throw together.  I had issues with the amount of puff pastry versus the other ingredients though. Obviously one sheet of puff pastry in Canada is 450g (found out after I had started this recipe). Instead, I had a 250g puff pastry so I halved the amount of the other ingredients. I used 2 apples that weighed a total of 400 grams (once peeled and cored). The result was a bit dry. The last 8 minutes in the oven I spread a thin layer of cranberry jam on top, but of course it changed the color and flavour somewhat; I didn't have any light coloured jam on hand. The next time I will use a larger pastry surface so I can get the pastry to fold around it like a galette should. Also, I will definitely use a gelatine or light coloured jam on top to give it some moisture and shine. Thanks Liam Walshe for a very fast and easy, yet elegant solution for my mid aftenoon tea. Your recipe made my daughter's day!

Loved this, and so did my husband.  Only thing I did differently was to add a sprinkle of flour on top of the apples before folding the pastry over because    I was afraid it was too wet.  Still don't know if that was actually necessary.  Served it with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce I made.  Will definitely make this again.

American Puff Pastry is MUCH smaller -- only 2 apples needed!  Otherwise this is a perfect  recipe that I made exactly as listed.  I have made it several times and added walnuts and orange juice soaked raisins along with using 1 Tablespoon of OJ and some Orange Zest instead of lemon when I didn't have one on hand.  It works perfectly!  A great jumping-off recipe that can be used and used........... what a great item to make a quick dessert.  works great for a potluck at work or church too because it is delicious at room temp!

I’ve made this with presidents choice puff pastry. Used sugar substitute but it didn’t turn out very sweet which is good for my diabetic bf but he suggested using brown sugar and it was so good that way. So use Splenda or stevia if you want for a healthier version and brown sugar if you want to indulge! I didn’t every try it with white sugar.

I followed recipe - it was good but not great.  Lots of dough and the apple pieces were large and didn't cook down to soft.  Looked great coming out of the oven.

It was nice! Pretty easy. I'm a baking beginner. The only thing was I think the instructions for putting it together (folding the puff pastry in towards the middle) was a little vague. But otherwise, it still tasted really good

Absolutely delicious.  Quick and easy to make.  I made this exactly as written.  This will be a "go to" when there's not enough time to make a pastry.  Excellent with creme fraiche.
