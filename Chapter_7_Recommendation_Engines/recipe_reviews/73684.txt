Yummy!  Surprisingly light and refreshing.  I used two cans of corn and one can of rinsed black beans.  Some people didn't even realize they were eating corn!

This is WAY better than the "Corn Dip" or the "Spicy Corn Dip" recipes here due to the fact that this one adds fresh jalapeno instead of canned green chiles and then uses the lime juice and cumin and salt and cayenne to get more flavor!  We tried it with and without and it is WAY better with those 4 ingredients, which are not in the other corn dip recipes.  The only thing I changed is using EQUAL amounts of mayo and sour cream (2 cups each).  I also one time had no lime or lemon juice so I substituted a WHOLE 2 OZ. BOTTLE of GREEN TABASCO (officially called McIlhenny Brand Green Pepper Sauce) and it was even better!  The green sauce is not really spicy but adds the tang that you need for this to not be too bland.  I think I may do that from now on as it seemed even better than with the lime juice.  YUM YUM!

My husband and I are addicted. We've taken this recipe to family get togethers and they definitely lick the bowl. But forget that, we make it pretty much weekly and save the leftovers in the fridge and snack throughout the week. We first made it cold-liked it. then, like the others, tried it warm-loooved it! I make this with non-fat mayo and non-fat sour cream every time for less guilt! Enjoy!

We thought this was just okay as a dip even though I had heated it.  But the next time I used bags of frozen roasted corn from Trader Joes, increased the onion and cilantro and served it as a side dish.  Now we really love it !!

This is a great recipe! I made the whole amount (without the cumin) and split in in half. I left one half cold, and baked the other half for 25-30 minutes (bubbling) at 350 degrees. My husband and I tried both, and while both are great we prefer the baked version better and feel that it will travel better and hold up better at a cookout! Try it!

I just don't get the raves about this dip. Maybe it's a mid west thing? I am not sure. Regardless, I have been in the SW my whole life, so maybe my expectations/tastes are a little different. It didn't matter what I did or added to this dip (cold, heated, salsa, chili powder, garlic, black beans, etc.), it just was not exciting and was certainly nothing I would go out of my way for. It was just kind of a blob of too much white and yellow stuff with no interesting flavors. I would never make this again let alone serve it to anyone. Can't give it one star, because it was edible and not atrocious, just not something to get all "yippee" about...not at all. I just don't understand the raves. Oh, well, different keeps for different peeps. I say, don't waste your time and calories. If you are a west coaster, steer clear.

WOW!  Based on the reviews, I was prepared to not really like this cold, but it's awesome!!  Love it served w/Tostitoes flour chips.  Made a few changes because i don't like cumin/cilantro and didn't have lime juice. Used a dash of lemon juice and used garlic salt and dill weed.  Yummy.  I reserved half to try baking it, but I think I'm going to serve it cold; what a great summer dip.  Thanks for the recipe; it's a keeper at our house!

Good dip. I made this for my sisters bridal shower and everyone just LOVED it. They chowed it all gone. I just used regular canned corn because I didnt have any mexican style.

This dip is GREAT if you bake it and serve it hot!!  Bake at 350 for 25 minutes or until bubbly and serve with tortilla scoop chips.  I also add a drained can of green chiles and 1 more teaspoon of cumin.  Made it twice and everyone LOVES it.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this last night for one set of guests, and it was such a hit, I made it again tonight for more guests.  At the suggestion of other reviews, I too bake it.  You couldn't ask for anything easier to prepare and the praise is reward enough to know you have created a wonderful dish!

I made this for a Superbowl party. Although it does make a lot, that was a good thing because people when nuts for it!!!  The only thing I changed was extra chili powder and 1/4 cup of Franks Red Hot sauce which gave it some extra flavor. 3 people asked me for the recipe.  AWESEOME STUFF, highly recommended.

Not excellent. Wouldn't make it again. To me, it just tasted like corn and cheese.

This is a 5 star dip! It is my "go to" for all parties now, and people expect it! The only thing I add is a spoonful of chopped green chilies and I like the mexicorn that has the chipolte seasoning.

This is very rich and bland: corn suspended in fat, almost a 1:1 ratio of corn to fat. At least this version of this dish contains cilantro, an improvement over other versions I have sampled. I gave it 3 stars for potential. I would remove the mayo, sour cream and cheese. I would add lots more lime juice (1 teaspoon in 8-10 cups of dip is undetectable), black beans, minced jalapenos, a minced red (bell or cayenne) pepper for color, and increase the green onion and cilantro.

This was a big hit at my get together! It was very hearty. I added a little more lime and cayenne, and used regular corn. Next time I would use finely shredded cheese. EDIT: I have made this many times, and you MUST use the Mexicorn or at least add a can of chopped green chilies. It definitely makes it tastier. I use finely shredded cheese, usually sharp cheddar and Monterey Jack. ALWAYS a hit!

*****Review addition:  I am changing this recipe from 4 to 5 stars.  I was serving it with my own chicken enchiladas and the usual chips and salsa.  Well, I wanted a hot dip for the chips so I put this in the oven for 20 minutes at 350.  FABULOUS!!!!!!!!!!  WOW!!!!!!  My guests ate the entire dish.  NO LEFTOVERS.  I will always serve this hot.  Thanks!*****Tasty Mexican dip.  I scaled it down to a third of what the original recipe was and it turned out great!  Only thing I did different was used frozen Mexi-corn and I added a Tbls. of lemon juice.  Very good!  Can't wait to serve to my guests!  Thanks CalvinandHenry!

I took this to a work bbq and everyone LOVED it~! I just used 2 cans of corn, 1 can of black beans and instead of the green onions, I used a 1/2 of a red onion (diced). I also used reduced fat sour cream, low-fat mayo, 8oz of reduced fat cheddar, 8oz of low-fat mozzarella - no one noticed~ For a kick, I diced up a jalepeno pepper. I might add some hot sauce or crushed red pepper next time before I bake it.

Have used this recipe numerous times and nearly everyone asks for the recipe! I substitute plain lowfat yogurt for the sour cream, and use lowfat mayo too--you can't tell the difference b/c the cheese is rich enough. I use frozen corn (heated and cooled) and usually add 50% more than called for (to taste) since the sauce is so rich.  I also quadruple the lime juice (substituting lemon if I don't have it) and add fresh chopped red pepper for color.  And I just keep adding more cumin to taste...usually double or triple the amount called for. I just like to make it a bit lighter--great recipe to tweak to your own tastes!

This is good if you like cold corn. I didn' t have any cilantro and used the lime juice out of the little bottle thing.

I think as is this recipe is 3 stars. I took it to a gathering of about 20 and came home with a lot and no compliments. :-( I made exactly as stated, which I think was the problem. It was BLAND and needed SOMETHING - probably lots more spices. Won't make again.

Delicious!  I did not expect to like, but I was very wrong.  We used normal corn and substituted chili powder for cayenne pepper.  We added quite a lot, but I guess it varies from person to person.  We also added a bit of pepper.  Very, very good.

I am from the midwest so maybe that is why I like this so much, lol! Great corn flavor! I didn't have any cilantro and the family doesn't care for cayenne so I substituted chili powder with delish results! Thanks CALVINANDHENRY, for sharing this awesome dip recipe!

YUM. This is in-sane. Quite addictive. I added about a tsp. of Frank's Hot Sauce and used a Cracker Barrel 2% sharp white cheddar, other than that I made no changes. This one's a keeper. So freakin' good.

Really a good, refreshing recipe.  I took it to Thanksgiving (I was in charge of appetizers) with Annie's Fruit Salsa, Amy's Creamy Cilantro Sauce, and Carrot Surprise (no one was really quick to catch my 'colors of the season' theme, lol) but everyone loved all of the dips on various chips - and this one wasn't the biggest hit, but I was asked for the recipe.  It wouldn't be my top choice, but I will definitely make it again when looking to make several dips.

I want to do 4.5 stars but I'll go with 4. This recipe is great and I can't wait to make it again. My only change (which is not necessary) is to add a few teaspoons of turmeric to compliment the Cumin. It's really a good dip. Eat with tortilla chips or even with regular kettle cooked potato chips. A must-try.

This was great and super easy.  It makes a lot.  You may need to scale it down.  I also skipped the cilantro and used reduced fat mayo and sour cream.  Turned out great!

This dip is fab, and much better hot than cold.  I covered with cheese and baked until bubbling... so good!  I might try it next time without the mayo to be less fattening.

The recipe was a hit at my latest party! I warmed this dip in a crock pot.  This was delicious!

This is amazing.  When I make it for a party, I always pour it into two pans since it makes alot and one  goes to the party and we have one at home for the next day.  It's always gobbled up and people rave over it.  I too do not serve it cold, but bake at 350 for 20 minutes.

This is a great recipe. I took this to my neices granduation party and all the other appetizers were snubbed. What little was left, I took home and took the advice of another reviewer who suggested heating it up.  YUMMY!

I made this recipe for a big party and got a lot of great reviews, but I had made a couple of changes to it.  I only used 8 oz. of cheese instead of 16 and instead of regular cheddar, I used the Mexican style.  I also had to add an extra 1/2 tsp. of cumin and another pinch of cayenne pepper, because I didn't think it was flavorful enough the way it was.

This recipe makes a lot, so if you're having other appetizers, maybe cut the amount you make in half.

Everytime I make this I get asked for the recipe.  I always log on to AllRecipes and print this for them.  I use light versions of the ingredients (sour cream...) and I omit the lime juice and the cilantro and I cut down on the cumin.  A little Accent will bring out the flavors in the ingredients.  Yes, I know it's MSG, but I'm not adding a lot of it.  I also often add black beans for a little added protein.  Frito's scoops (or other corn chips) are pretty high in fat, so to cut back on fat try using crackers instead (Ritz Wheat Crackers are a good alternative).  This recipe is great for snacking on while watching a football game on TV with a group.

This was great!  I made it for a party but only used 1 cup of sour cream.  It was plenty creamy without it.  I served it cold. The dish received lots of compliments!

Only tasted a teapoonful before putting it in fridge for dinner but it does taste good. Going to serve it with game chips, chicken and salad. DInner over now and I strongly reccomend this recipe to anyone who likes mexican flavours. I used 1T snøfrisk instead of mayonnaise, one 280 gm can of corn, grated red onion instead of green onion and forgot the cumin, but would add it next time as can't see it wouldnt be good.

I have been making this for years and it is always a BIG HIT! I tweaked it to make it healthier by using low fat sour cream and low fat mayo. I also add a can of black beans, drained, use only ONE cup of cheese, up the cayene some and add diced jalepenos!!! BAM!

followed the recipe almost exactly except i used a little less sour cream and mayo then called for. turned out to have the perfect amount of creaminess so i would definitely recommend cutting down on these. i elected to cook it for 30 minutes at 350 degrees and thought it was superb!

Great recipe! The proportions are perfect.  Good warm, but I think it was better before I baked it. **UPDATE** Made this recipe to a tee - it's perfect - don't change a ting, besides the seasonings to your taste.

This was really great, although I did choose to serve it hot. If you do this, add a little more corn because obviously it will be thinner. I served it with tortilla chips.

Fabulous! I brought this to a pot-luck today and it is all gone. Probably have had 6 requests for the recipe! Tried it at home last week...both cold and hot..and we prefer it cold. I followed the recipe as it is and got great results! Served it with blue corn chips...what a treat! Thanks.

I used a bag of frozen white corn and used a 1/2 pkg of cream cheese and cut the sour cream to 1 cup.  I also had to add more spices as it was a little bland.  This is also great with salsa served on the side!  Oh - and definitely serve it hot!

I would give this 4 1/2 stars if I had the option.  I first tried the dip cold.  Not very impressed.  It was good, but not GOOOOOOOD.  But heeding to the advice of others, I heated the dip up in the oven... OMG... sooooo much better!  I'm addicted!

I was looking for something different and this was it.  My fiancee hates anything to do with mexican food.  I mixed everything together the night before and everytime I saw him in the kitchen he was eating the dip.  The next day what was left I baked.  We liked it both ways but it was awesome hot. Served with fritos scoops.

Very good! The only variation I made  is that I used 1 cup of sour cream instead of 2. I think chopped black olives or black eyed peas would also be a great addition in this recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

What a unique dip! I didn't have any cayenne pepper so I added 2 tblsp of chili powder instead. The flavors are much better if you chill it overnight. Be warned, it makes a bunch! I took it to a church picnic, served it with Fritos Scoops, and everyone RAVED over it. I had four different women asking for the recipe! I will definitely make it again!

This being corn season in the mid-west, and my access to "just picked this morning" corn, this is outstanding with fresh corn. I added 6 or seven ears of fresh corn that had been steamed the night before.  I always run the back of my knife down each side of the cob after I cut off the kernels to get all the juicy bits and added that as well. I didn't have green onion, so I added a sprinkle of onion powder and added fresh chives instead.  Had to rely on bottled lime juice, so I can imagine how great this is with fresh squeezed.

love this!  Good cold or hot.  I cut the recipe to 5 servings (1 can of mexicorn) and use a little less sour cream and mayo - 1/4 cup each instead of 1/3 cup.

Great as an appetizer or side dish.  I added a half teaspoon of chili powder to the ingredients.  Loved it!  The lime juice is a must to top off all the flavors.  I don't see how anyone could call this recipe bland because it's filled with strong flavors like cilantro, green onion and cumin!  

I also took the advice of other reviewers and served this as a hot side dish....350 degrees for 25 minutes.  Everyone gobbled up this dish and they all want the recipe.

Everyone loved this, including me! I did add green and red pepper diced, less mayo and I split it in half and baked 1/2 since my friend's son was helping me and we thought it would be good warm.  Brought out flavors more we thought, so better warm but still good cold!

Took it to a party everyone loved it. Only changes I made was 1 cup of cilantro and then Frank's hot sauce instead of cayenne. You can add to your taste. Warning it does make alot but what I did come home (maybe 2 cups) was eaten the next day.

This dip is always a hit! It's definitely all about that Mexi Corn; it adds a lot of flavor! I also use about 3 limes, a full cup of cilantro and a lot more cumin and cayenne pepper. Make sure to make this the night before if you're serving it cold because it makes it much more firm and a better appetizer dip. I also used light mayo and light sour cream and it still tastes awesome!

Good.  Very yummy and of course very fattening.  So it goes I guess.  Also beware, my sister and I kept eating this as a snack while we fixed lunch or dinner and found that we were pretty much full before it was ever time to eat. Very filling.  The recipe makes A LOT!

Super yummy! I used two cans of mexicorn and 1 can of black beans drained and rinsed. I added more than a pinch of cayenne pepper and I baked mine at 350 for 35 minutes. Served with tortilla chips. Big hit!

This recipe is AMAZING!! Every one who has tried this makes me give them a copy of it because it is such a tasteful dip. It's funny because everyone takes a look at it and is kinda grosed out on how it looks, then they taste it and are amazed!! I refridgerate mine over night for the best taste. Thanks for the recipe!!

This recipe was great, I have made it twice now, once exactly as written and the second time with a few changes.  Both times I took it to parties and it was one of the first things gone. The second time I made it I substituted a 1/4 cup Franks hot sauce for the cayenne and cumin cause I didn't have any and used a can of diced chilies instead of the green onion because we like them.  For me personally I like it better with the changes but it is more a personal taste than anything.  I also baked it the second time and we did prefer it warm.

I was a little skeptical to try something (especially for the first time with company coming over) called "corn dip," but I am SO glad that I did!  This stuff is easy to make and is a HUGE hit.  I love it because it is a great alternative to the usual 7-layer dip that is commonly used at tailgates, parties, etc.  Definitely give this a try!

Wow.  I was cautious at first, because this looked more like a cold salad than a dip (and I hate cold salads), but my tongue was quick to inform me that this was a-okay.  Scooped up in a tortilla chip, it's like taking a bite out of a taco.  Pretty much.  Not much to say, other than I swapped out the mayo, sour cream, and cheddar cheese for soy counterparts and it turned out great.

This was good.  I made 2/3 of the recipe because I could tell that it was going to make A LOT.  I think this recipe calls for too much cheese, so just watch that as you are adding it in so you don't over-do it.  It seemed to be missing a little 'something' but I am not sure what that might be - fresh jalapeno maybe?? Also, by day 2 it had gotten quite runny - doesn't taste any different/worse, just is really juicy now, so try to eat it the day of or the dat after to avoid this...

I've made this dip tons of times and always get good reviews from everyone who eats it.  I use green chilis instead of jalapeno peppers and it works just as well.

The ratio of corn to "other stuff" in my pantry was out of control, and I had a bunch of crackers to use up from the holidays, so although I changed this up a lot to use stuff I had on hand, it's awesome!  I used 1c cottage cheese instead of shredded, and 3 canned chipotles (in adobo w/seeds) in place of chiles and cayenne pepper.  Also threw in a couple diced radishes.  YUM - very different but a nice flavor, although I am a cumin adict!  Thanks for sharing this - easy and inexpensive munchie...would love to try with fresh roasted corn!

sooo good...people love this one.  But I don't put as much cheese or sour cream.  I also add jalapeno.  very good recipe though and you have to eat it with corn chips!!

I made this for a change of pace at work a month ago. Everyone likes spicey but I can't take the heat.This was gone in no time. We are making it again for a tailgating party this weekend due to so many requests. I did split the recipe into 2 bowls and added just a few minced jalapeños to one. I let it sit overnight so that the cumin flavor had time to really come out.

This is everyone's favorite dip in our Bunko group - They won't even let me bring anything else!
The only thing I do different is take one of the cans of mexicorn and use my pampered chef chopper and chop it up so it has more flavor. 
YUMMO!

Great Dip! I omitted the cumin as a personal preferance. I too, baked half; however, I think it is MUCH better served cold.

Made this recipe cold one day and then made it again the next day hot...both ways it was great but it seemed like everyone liked it better hot! i baked it at 350 for 25 min.(if you do make it cold, it is better after it has been refrigerated for a night)

I made this for a party and people seemed to enjoy it.  It wasn't my favorite dip as it was a little rich for my taste.  The recipe makes a ton and is good with carrot sticks, fritos or tortilla chips.

I've made this several times and everyone always loves it. I omit the cilantro (doesn't really do much and many don't like the taste), but I do add minced red onion.  I think it adds a great texture and taste to it.  Goes great cold or baked!

I can't stop eating it.  I don't like mexi corn so I used 2 cans of Green Giant Shoepeg corn (little kernels).  That is the only thing I changed.  So good and wonderful recipe to take to parties or if you are having a party!  YUM-O.

This dip is great!!  I took it to a party and everyone loved it.  It was one of the first times where there was not a scoop left of the dip I brought.  I even had a few people ask me for the recipe.  I liked it cold, my husband liked it hot.  I heated it at the party in a glass dish and let it sit there - even after it cooled people were digging in.

Wow is about all I have to say about this one.  It never makes it to the fridge without a few (or a lot) chips going into it.  I've never had to throw any away.

I made this dip for a family get together this weekend and it was a huge hit! I did not add the cilantro. I used 2 cans mexican corn & 1 can white corn. It was good cold and very good hot as suggested by others.It is now a new family fav. Thank You!

This turned out quite good.  I used 2 15oz cans of corn and 1 5oz can of chopped green chiles, only 1c sour cream, and cooked it all in a crock pot for about an hour before serving.  My mom liked it better cold (after the cheese had melted in the crock pot) but I liked it better warm.  Goon on chips, crackers, and baked potatoes!

This stuff is very good.  Made for a party and was asked for recipe.  Did not use as much corn-modified ingredients to match that-can't say exact amounts, but I don't think you can mess this dip up.  Nice change-would recommend.

I love this dip! A co worker made it for me and gave me the recipe. And I made it for a NYE party and everyone loved it and wanted the recipe!!! It’s so good! I do add jalapeño because I love spice and I don’t use the full amount of cumin just because I feel cumin is overpowering. Try this recipe!!!

Fantastic!  I made this for a work party and not only did I get rave reviews but I also won the Dip Competition!  Several people also asked for the recipe.  The only thing I did differently was to add a can of black beans, rinsed and drained.  I will definitely be making this again!

Added more cilantro,  used the juice from a whole lime, added 1 more tsp of cumin, 1 diced jalapeño and added 3-4 tablespoons of Cajun Spicy Garlic Sauce! 
Loved it!

I make this dip all of the time for work potluck events.  Everyone loves it and I always have requests for the recipe.  I don't use the fresh Cilantro but 3 tablespoons of dry.  Other than that, I follow the recipe.    I serve with Frito Scoops.

Suggestion: I don't like mexi corn so I switched it for Shoepeg corn. Shoepeg is small corn so easier to dip with a chip! It can be found in a can in just about every store. I used 2 cans.

I really like this dip.  I don't think it is bland at all.  Because of the reviews, I tried it both hot and cold and like it equally as well.

Yum! I made this for a work function and 4 people asked me for the recipe! Note that it does make a LOT of dip though- about 6 cups, I would guess.

This was delicious and a huge hit with our friends! I served it with tortilla chips, fritos and pita chips.  This dip also makes a very large amount which is nice if you're entertaining for a large group or if not, then you can save some for your family!  Usually I do not make changes to the recipe but I did this time.  I added the following in addition to the recipe:another 1/2 cup cilantro, 1/2 teaspoon cayenne, 1/2 teaspoon cumin, and 2 teaspoons lime juice.  The green onions really helps the recipe stand out.  Delicious!!

This is one of my favorite dips and it always goes over well at parties.  I omitted the cilantro, used sharp cheddar cheese, and used way more than a "pinch" of both the cayenne and salt.  YUM!

This is very good! I subbed fresh corn and peppers (roasted red & fresh green) for the Mexicorn and plain yogurt for sour cream. I think I'll try subbing cream cheese for the mayo and bake it sometime.

I like this, but don't love it enough to make it often.  It is missing something that gives it a bunch.   It makes a LOT of dip.  Have tried it cold and hot.   Great that it is all natural from fresh ingredients, was well recieved at tailgates but not completely finished, which is how I rate a tailgate recipe as top-notch.

Substituted 1 can black beans as previous posters and added a can of rotel, but found it still needed more kick for my liking. Tasted great with blue corn chips. Will add some red pepper next time.

ADDICTIVE!!! I followed the recipe exactly, and everyone loved it.  I served it hot, based on reviews here.  However, it was just as good cold the next day (for breakfast!!) This time I am going to try adding half a can of hot rotel tomatoes to kick up the heat.  I'll re-post after I get reactions.

This dip is addictive!  I made a half-batch for a very small New Year's party (only 7 adults) and after a very large dinner - including cake for dessert - my guests managed to go through 2 bags of tortilla chips and all of the dip!  You can't go wrong with this, and it won't hurt to have a few spare recipe cards laying around if you make this for guests!

Tasty dip, definitely needs more zip with "cayenne to taste." Agree it's best heated. We also made this in a version free of cow dairy and eggs for a person with allergies by using soy-based "mayo" and goat cheddar. Some said they liked that version even better.

First of all, this makes A LOT of dip! Secondly, it was a little bland. I really liked the flavors that are put together here, but I think it could use a touch of chili powder and maybe a little enchilada sauce...? Overall it's not bad, but needs a little kick.
