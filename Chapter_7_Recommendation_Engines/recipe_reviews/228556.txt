The combination of lemon and milk tastes terrible.   The lemon flavor is overpowering, maybe try less to no lemon,  personally staying away from this dish

Only two reviews so I feel compelled to leave one.

I made this per original recipe, only having doubled it.  It was quick, fairly easy and quite different from our normal fare.  I had figs on hand that needed using so I was interested in trying something new.

The sauce was a bit thick but that could have been my lack of ability to read the tiny directions-without my readers and with a nasty case of poison ivy swelling up my eyes.  I added a bit more milk and it was fine.

My only other complaint is the picky eaters that I fed this to.  I really enjoyed it but they picked out all the prosciutto and left all the figs.  At least they didn't totally turn up their noses, so I think that's a good sign.  I would make this again for me.  The rest can make their own dinner.

Delicious! I had to make a couple subs based on what I had on hand. I used dates instead of figs and used pre-cooked crumbled bacon - did not use the lemon pepper.  I had doubts about the white sauce as a stand-alone with added zest but it was fantastic. The topping of dates/bacon (in our case) was amazing. So so good. Definitely will make again! Thank you for  such a yummy and creative recipe!

Without a doubt the most creative, incredible recipe I've found in forever. The figs, prosciutto, and white sauce with just that touch of lemon make this outstanding. This is a definite keeper, fit for company. Thanks for sharing. I was very impressed.
