One for the keeper recipe file guys and gals! We did it. We've found a real cupcake. Not a rock. Not a chocolate-flavoured sponge. And not chocolate flavoured crumbles to wear on your shirt instead of making it to your mouth! (and I didn't use the xanthan gum) If you're a nut for dark chocolate, then you will be in heaven when you eat these. I made a half recipe and got 12 regular-sized muffins using slightly less than 1/4 cup of batter per cupcake. I used a chopped piece of 70% cacao, didn't have any chips on hand. Reading the notes, I did use brown rice flour instead of coconut and used regular whole, milk instead of buttermilk. The cupcakes  cooked exactly as stated, in 20 minutes. Really a great treat for gluten free diets or not. Thank you, gem bee, for the recipe.

This was delicious, lots of happy tastebuds! I tweaked it and created Gluten and Sugar-Free Raspberry Filled Dark Chocolate Cupcakes. Added Vanilla Cream Cheese Frosting and of course sprinkles! Use the avocado oil, it really adds to the flavor and definitely use foil cupcake liners for holding in moisture.

It is difficult to know how to rate a recipe when it uses ingredients that you are not used to (and don't really need to use)---gluten free flour and brown rice flour.  I made these to take to the faculty at my daughter's elementary school to please someone there who is gluten free.  I made a combination of regular-sized cupcakes and a lot of little minis.  When I tasted the cupcakes, I felt that they were a little dry and somewhat crumbly, but the people who are gluten free thought they were really good.   So the verdict is that they are great for those who want sweets without gluten!
