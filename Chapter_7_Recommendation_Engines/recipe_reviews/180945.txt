These were so delicious! I did make a couple changes because dumbo me forgot the lemon at the store....so I used an orange. Very very good! It would be awesome with the lemon too! They're puffy and moist, which I don't normally like in cookies but these had alot of flavor. I drizzled a powdered sugar glaze on top with a touch of almond extract. Yummy!

the flavor on these were great, but they turned out to be very sticky and dense...the moisture in them seemed to multiply!  Perhaps next time i won't make the glaze for them and just leave them plain...

Great bold flavor. Because the cookies are so fluffy and don't really brown, I think next time I'll bake the batter in a loaf pan - it tastes more like yummy bread.

Loved it. Found this recipe while searching for something to do with the walnuts and cranberries I had. Changed a couple things. Did not add cloves. Had no applesauce so instead I used another 1/4 cup butter. I also only used 2/3 cup sugar and I caramelized it. Used 3 tablespoons lemon juice and 1 tablespoon dried lemon peal instead of fresh ingredients because I really like to have things measured out. Turned out amazing. Will make it the same way next time.

I did not make any changes.  The cookies did not stay fluffy but flattened out instead. They tasted good but had no she appeal and looked nothing like the picture

Made a batch:  baked great, took out as soon as they were golden brown on the bottom, followed directions as for cooling, glazed....had husband taste them...wasn't a fan..I tasted them...not a fan.  Will prepare a different recipe for get together tomorrow.  Very disappointed in lack of flavor..  The cloves overwhelm the lemon.  Should have read all of reviews before I spent the time and used the ingredients.

Recipe needs help.  I added a tsp. of salt and skipped the cloves. Results:   The dough was too soft as other reviewers have indicated, so the cookies ran together on the pan.  If I make them again, I will add more flour to stiffen the dough.  I think this is a decent basic recipe for a cake-like cookie but use your judgement on the amount of flour and make sure the butter isn't melted, just softened.

I made this recipe based on the fact that I love the ingredients.  However, the cookie just didn't do it for me.  Too cake-like.  I don't like clove so I used half the amount--it didn't help.  I don't think clove complemented the ingredients.  One reviewer used orange & I believe that would complement the clove more.  I just made them tonight and perhaps tomorrow they will be better.
