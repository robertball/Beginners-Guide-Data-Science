Delicious! This was great for lunch! I scaled it back a bit for just me and my husband. I used regular tortillas, light cream cheese and low-fat Cheddar cheese as that's what I had on hand.  I served these with a side of homemade salsa and my husband couldn't resist dipping his in a bit of Ranch dressing.

These were very good!I did double the cream cheese spread for the 6 wraps, and used fresh salsa instead of tomato. I also chopped up the avacado and added it in with the fresh salsa.I have made several wraps from this site and this one is my familys favorite.

I was looking for a recipe for beef & avocado & we ended up really liking this one.  Couple changes, we used left-over steak, cut it into small pieces and heated meat before putting in the wrap.  Put 1/2 cheese in wrap & 1/2 on top.  Heated in oven about 10-15 min.  Easy, quick and very tasty meal.

This is a very basic wrap.  Next time I make it I'm going to probably put extra seasoning in the cream cheese it was hard to taste this time around.

THIS RECIPE WAS WONDERFUL, WE ENDED UP SERVING IT TO THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD AND EVERY LITTLE KID ON THE BLOCK LOVED IT BECAUSE THEY COULD MAKE THEIR OWN! PARENTS THOUGHT IT WAS DELICIOUS! WE USED FRESH SPINACH AND SNUCK IN THOSE HEALTHFUL BENEFITS, TOO!

I am not good at wrapping tortillas so I mashed my avocado in with the cream cheese. I find the more ingredients I have, it makes it even more difficult to wrap.  I don't know why, I've seen people wrap tortillas as big as my head. This was a delightfully refreshing recipe, thank you. A couple suggestions; cut and peel a cucumber the next time you prepare this & mash it in with the cream cheese and avocado.  And buy freshly sliced roast beef from the deli.  The roast beef already sliced in packages doesn't really have the flavor this wrap needs.

I made these today, but changed them up a bit... I made a roast in the oven, seasoned with Fajita seasoning, used sour cream in place of cream cheese, no tomato, added green salsa and lime juice...man it was yummy! So I really shouldn't rate this one at all.

I'm not very good at tightly wrapping tortillas so ours weren't as pretty as some other wraps - but the taste more than made up for it! Thanks for a great lunch recipe!

This was pretty good. I made this just for me, which was a little tricky to scale down for one, and spread the cream cheese on the roast beef and wrapped everything in Bibb lettuce. Very filling.

I so wish I wasn't out of avacado right now, but my picky kids are refusing to let me have a bite of their wrap, anyway. So 5 stars from us!!!!!

It's like a cold fajita! I didn't use the chili flakes or lettuce the first time I made the wraps and it still tasted good without them.

These were great! Very "fresh" tasting. Used low fat cream cheese. Can't wait to eat the leftovers!

hubby didn't enjoy it much.  I think it's because it had a tortilla and not some thick crusty bread.  If I made it on bread like that he would eat this a lot.  Not the recipes fault.

I made this wrap as an appetizer for a recent party. Each wrap was sliced into four mini wraps and arranged on a platter. I don't like cream cheese so I used hummus, adding the spices as indicated in the recipe. I also omitted the tomato to cut down on messiness and substituted guacamole for the cubed avocado. It was enjoyed by all. Thanks for sharing this recipe.
