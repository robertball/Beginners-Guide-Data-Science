I only needed to make 2 of these, so I cut everything in half very easily. I used 1/4 cup Ghirardelli 60% Cacao Bittersweet chocolate chips and melted it with the butter in the microwave. In about 40 seconds everything was nicely melted. I sprayed the ramekins with Canola Cooking spray and baked for about 9 minutes. These were perfect and SO easy to make. A light dusting of confectioner's sugar or a drizzle of caramel on top, makes them look so pretty.

Oh my goodness!! These are rich, delicious and sinful! And EASY! I followed the recipe ingredients exactly, using Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate. I saw a similar recipe that said it is ok to set aside and refrigerate the prepared batter for a few hours, just remove and allow to come to room temperature before baking. I made the batter before dinner and took it out of the fridge just as we sat down to eat. I put them in the oven as we finished the meal. The cakes still looked a bit wet after 6 minutes, so I left them 2 minutes longer. I'm not sure if this was because the batter was still a bit cold when I put them in. I used pyrex custard cups and they didn't unmold too well, the one I tried to umold split and oozed all over the plate, but they tasted just as good eaten from the dish rather than unmolded. Another thing I discovered is that if you heat a leftover cake in the microwave for 30 seconds it bubbles up like a volcano and tastes nearly as good as fresh out of the oven!

Made 1/2 recipe to check timing for my oven. These are a bit tricky to bake JUST right but when you do they are delish! Added some vanilla to eggs, a pinch of salt, and an extra teaspoon of flour. Used semi-sweet morsels (1/4 cup for 1/2 recipe). Baked 10 1/2 minutes but next time I'll try 12. They were a little too runny but this is a great recipe to HAVE to experiment with. Definitely serve with a sprinkle of powdered sugar, vanilla ice cream and/or whipped cream. Super EZ to make after dinner and also used the microwave to melt butter and chocolate (40 secs). Used pyrex custard cups buttered and sugared. No problem sticking. Can't wait to make for company. Will add some fresh raspberries or strawberries on the side. These are the same pricey souffles that many of the "Big" name restaurants serve. Never knew they were so simple and bet you've got all the ingredients. GO MAKE THESE NOW! YUMMY !!!

Fantastic!  This needs waaayyy more than 5 stars!  I've had dessert like this in restaurants and had no idea how simple they were to make!  I added a little vanilla to the batter & baked for 12 minutes based upon suggestions.  They were perfect - little chocolate cakes that just ooze a delightful chocolate center.  They're also not terribly sweet, just really, really chocolatey!  Incredible!!!

I used muffin tins but only baked for 7 minutes.  It was very gooey but had a great taste.  Next time I will bake for at least 10 minutes.

Easy, but gourmet dessert! So rich that one is usually enough for each guest. Can make ahead, refrigerate, then bring to room temp before baking. Serving option: after unmolding dust with confectioners sugar and serve with a scoop of Bryers chocolate-chip mint or other complimentary ice cream.

Excellent dessert!!  I had something similar this at two seperate high-end restaurants in Dallas several years ago and this easily competes with those.  My husband - who typically prefers tart desserts - loved this.  I used bittersweet Ghiradelli, added a little vanilla, opted for sugar coating the ramekins rather than flouring and baked at 425 for 10 minutes.  This will now become my dinner party dessert as it is extremely quick and easy to prepare.  I love it!

I made this last night for a perfect end to Valentine's dinner, and it was a tremendous hit! I make a lot of chocolate desserts, and this is by far the best one I have made yet - as good as or better than I've had in restaurants. I cooked mine for 7 minutes only in glass custard dishes and they were perfect. However, I used Baker's Secret spray rather than buttering and flouring the cups, and they did not fall right out of the cups as I think they should have. Will butter and flour next time. Also, used Ghiardelli bittersweet. I think semi-sweet would make the dish too sweet. Too bad this is not health food -- I could eat it every day!

excellent,great chocolate fix!!!! I used Ghardelli semisweet and used splenda for the sugar. I baked at 430 for 9 minutes. Used Bakers Joy and had no problem removing from cups. We ate as is but would be great with whipped cream or ice cream. Will definately make again and again. Thanks Russ!

Unbelievable dessert.  I made it for Valentine's Day and it was absolutely perfect.  My husband, a true chocoholic and dessert conaisseur, said that it was one of the best desserts he ever had.  I cooked it for 8-9 minutes, and it turned out great, but quite liquid in the middle - 10 minutes would be perfect.  Use a good quality bittersweet chocolate.

This recipe is fantantic, elegant and very easy. It is certainly a winner. I have made a few changes since I needed to make it for 6 servings but the result was EXCELLENT. 1) I use 8 ounces of chocolate chips (Ghiraldelli or Hershey,semi-sweet chocolate). 2) 6tbs of unsalted butter.3) 4 big eggs. 4) 1/2 flour. As I don't have a double boiler I heated the butter and chocolate in a heavy pan until melted. I set it aside to cool down. I mixed the flour, sugar and eggs together. I put the eggs, one at the time. Once it got the light creamy colour that they talk about in the recipe, I mixed it for 5 more minutes. Then, I folded in the melted chocolate and butter with a wooden spoon into the egg mixture. Next, I refrigerated the batter for al least 1 hour (that is up to you, the longer it refrigerates the more the flavour inhances). Before I bake it, I let it sit to room temperature. I poured the batter into the six molds that I had sprayed and bake it in my preheated over (375 degrees F) for about 15 minutes or until de middle looks cracked. Before I turn them upside down into the plate, I let it cool for 5 min. Serve it inmediately with cold raspberry sauce and ice cream. ENJOY IT THIS HEAVENLY DESSERT!!

This can be a 5 star recipe, but it's off in measurements and time of cooking, which is why I gave it 3 stars. PLEASE DON'T LET MY RATING STOP YOU FROM MAKING THEM -- they are quite delcious!  I recommend everyone to read other's reviews and make necessary adjustments before you make them.  I made the followng changes:  I used 2 tbsp of gluten free flour for this recipe, buttered and sugared my cups (something I saw on Video Jug).  I also used parchment paper to line the bottoms of my cups -- first I traced the bottom in pencil, then cut out the circles.  After they're cooked, use a knife to loosen the edges.  I cooked them for 10 minutes, but will cook for 12 next time as they were too gooey.  I dusted with icing sugar, and served with raspberries and vanilla icecream.

These turned out perfect and they're easy to make!
I actually made them into "s'more cupcakes" (see pictures on listing) with a marshmallow frosting and crusted graham crackers.  AWESOME!
I WILL be making these again whether alone or as a base!!!

Amaaazing recipe! Elegant and decadent, and so quick! I will definitely make these cakes again. I used margarine and half a pack of semisweet chocolate chips, and I didn't have ramekins so I used a muffin tray. The batter perfectly filled 7 of the muffin wells (the cake doesn't rise, so feel free to fill to the top), and I let them bake for 8 minutes. When they were done, I left the whole tray upside down on a cutting board for half a minute, then pried the cakes out using two mini-spatulas as tongs. They were for a surprise party so I immediately hid them in the fridge, which meant that when we ate the cold cakes afterwards, the centres weren't gooey, but the texture was still wonderfully rich and heavy in a way that seemed gourmet. I got rave reviews and the birthday girl couldn't believe they weren't from a store! (Note: I also sprinkled the cakes with powdered sugar, which made them look gorgeous but turned out to be a big mess when the candles were blown out and sugar got everywhere!)

I made this according to the directions the first time and really felt that something was missing so I tried them again, with the following changes:  --added 2 tablespooons of flour (instead of 2 tsp), a rounded 1/4 cup of sugar, and 1/2 tsp each of Kahlua and vanilla to the chocolate and butter mixture just before combining with the other ingredients. I baked this in two 10 oz ramekins, buttered and dusted with cocoa powder (as some other reviewers recommended), for 10 minutes. These were amazing! My friends think I slaved in the kitchen over this dessert!!

These are very chocolatey! I followed the recipe except I added a few drops of vanilla to the eggs and I increased the cooking time to 13-14 mins. DO NOT melt your chocolate in the microwave like someone has suggested, I followed that advice hoping to simplify a bit and lost my good chocolate and had to start over! The double boiler method is a must. I was INITIALLY disappointed with my cakes because after 10 minutes in the oven, I turned them onto serving dishes and during the 15 second wait to remove the mold, three of my cakes burst open and spilled their lovely sauce all over their dishes. Thankfully I had one cake left and a hot oven, so I popped it in for another 4 minutes and it was perfect! It also puffed up a little more too. They were moist and the texture was perfect, just delightful. Everyone's oven is different so I'm not judging this by the cooking time. I think 13 mins will be perfect for next time, because I will definately be making these again and reccomemnding the recipe to friends! These were perfect with a small scoop of french vanilla ice cream on the side or with a glass of milk.

Perfect for the chocolate lover!  I baked it for ten minutes and it came out easily and had a great gooey center.  I think I might try buttering and dusting the ramekin with cocoa powder instead of flour to get rid of the whitish layer it left on the cake.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Made for Dylan's birthday 2010.  Holy yum!  Serve with sugared raspberries.  Quick, easy better if you refrigerate the mix for a while before cooking.  Chocolate curls.

I thought these cakes were super easy to make.  I like to add just a bit more sugar to mine, I just eyeball about another teaspoon.  I also find it easier to use the microwave rather than a double boiler to melt my chocolate.  The baking time is definitely not long enough, but you just have to keep an eye on them.  I don't use a timer, but I would guess I bake them for about 10 minutes.  I open the oven and see if the centers jiggle--as soon as only the very center is jiggling, I pull them out.  I've never had a problem with these--you just have to use your common sense with the baking.  Oh--and I also use cocoa powder to dust my ramekins with because I felt that flour might show up and ruin the presentation.  Serve these with your favorite vanilla bean ice cream and you're good to go!

WOW! WOW! WOW!  I made these for my kids when the hubby wasn't home then had to make more so that they could have a second one and he could try them.  AMAZING and really quite easy.  I didn't have bittersweet chocolate so just used semisweet and they turned out great.  The first batch I baked for 10 minutes (after reading some other reviews) and they were just too done in the middle and didn't have liquid centers.  The second batch I baked for the time given in the original recipe and they were perfect.  My husband said that I should feel free to make them again any time!  I didn't have any custard cups so I just used a muffin pan and they still came out great.  To unmold them I just placed a cookie sheet upside down on top of the muffin pan and then flipped both pans together.  Worked like a charm.

I cooked them for around 12 minutes and that was too long -- they weren't gooey in the middle when they were done. I would do them less next time and just let them sit after coming out of the oven.

Absolutely amazing. I used semi sweet chocolate. Tasted great. I used a muffin tin and the recipe made 5 muffin size lava cakes. I buttered the tin very well and dusted it with flour and the cakes unmolded very easily. I think it's better to put the tin on the upper shelf of the oven. This way, the liquid part will be in the center of the cake. If you put it on the middle shelf, the liquid part will be on top of the cakes.
I served it with vanilla ice-cream, strawberries and whipped cream for Valentine's dessert and both of us enjoyed it so much. Thanks a lot for posting this amazing recipe.

Yummy! Thanks for the super easy receipe- only alterations I made: added a dash of vanilla essence and a bit more sugar (almost 1/2 cup instead of 1/4) as I was using bittersweet choc and we like it sweeter.. The top wasn't done at 8 mins so cooked for 11 mins in total and it turned out great with the inside still soft.. But I guess it must be eaten soon as after a few hours, the entire cake was more solid. May be will cook for just 9- 10 mins next time. Thanks again for the wonderful receipe :)

Loved the recipe - easy to do - however my oven definately took more than 7 minutes to cook these.   Quick tip if you have issues getting them out of the ramekins whole - serve in the ramekins - dust the top with powder sugar - add a couple of raspberries and a sprig of mint.

Decadent, delightful and delicous. A very impressive recipe. Because I used 85% chocolate, I added a pinch more sugar. I baked the cakes for 6 minutes and they were really melty and gooey, but I think I ate raw eggs. I had only one ramekin, so I used a muffin pan to substitute. Muffin pans are much harder to flip over onto individual plates. One little cake met a sad, sad fate. Anyway, I absolutely LOVE the recipe. It's a keeper. Big 'wow' factor.

Very easy instructions to follow, an instant favorite. I cooked for slightly longer because my oven is older. The only caution that I have is that after the cakes had cooled, the middles had cooked by carry-over cooking. Eat them right away! =D

I cannot believe how simple and delicious this was!!  I made it on Valentines Day in the middle of making 3 or 4 other things.  So simple.  So good!!  I can't wait to make these again.  I think they're my new favorite dessert.

Made this for Valentines day, and it was a hit! Halved the recipe and baked it into a single 2-cup ramekin - that worked fine. Used unsweet chocolate and doubled the sugar. Not quite sweet enough for our tastes, so I will probably use even more sugar next time, or follow other reviewer's suggestions and coat the ramekin in sugar instead of flour. Baked 12 minutes to account for the larger pan - came out perfect. Served immediately with fresh whipped cream. My betrothed requested a raspberry syrup over it for next time. That will be delicious!

Excellent recipe.  I halved the recipe and followed some previous reviewers tips by using butter & sugar for the ramekins, making ahead and refrigerating and bringing to room temp before baking at 430 degrees for 10 minutes.  Huge hit!  May leave in oven a few more minutes next time as I prefer a little less liquid in the middle.  Thanks for sharing.

I love this recipe its so simple and easy, these came out delicious, I used semi sweet choc because that's all I had. They weren't as chocolaty as I would have liked but still awesome. I also added vanilla, next time I will use bittersweet choc.

Chocolate lovers, this recipe was especially made for you! Delicious!! Tips for those who are going to bake this for the first time:  1 - add 1 more teaspoon of flour 2 - the batter won't be thick at all, it's normal. 2 - IGNORE the baking time of the recipe. It depends of your oven. In my case, after 10 minutes it was completely liquid. I left it inside the oven untill the cake turned into this big round "bubble-like" thing. Then I turned off the oven and let it sit there for a while. It sinked and there was this beautiful crack in it, showing the chocolate inside. I took it off the oven and ate it with ice cream, SO yummy!

YUMM! My advise is to eat it warm with ice cream or whipped cream. And use ramekins instead of muffin trays.Or cut the cooking time short if using muffin trays cause they cook a lot faster causing the middle to cook as well.

Delightful!!  I made a half recipe for my boyfriend and myself to solve my craving for chocolate and ended up wanting more.  I couldn't believe how easy it was to make a gourmet looking dessert!

Following previous reviewers' advice, I used half semi-sweet, half bitter-sweet chocolate.  I also baked mine for 8-9 minutes, but I think next time I'll follow the recipe (for a little more "lava").  This would be even better with chocolate, caramel or raspberry sauce drizzled over the top!

UPDATE: I made this twice with half semi-sweet half bittersweet chocolate, with excellent results.  Then I tried to use all bittersweet and added more sugar...NOT a good idea!  They didn't unmold and oozed everywhere.  I, too, use Pyrex custard cups, and they seem to be fine so long as you grease & flour them sufficiently.

ETA: After a 10 year hiatus, I remembered this recipe and made a half batch with my son. Ironically, I didn’t recall this review, so I followed the recipe, using all bittersweet chocolate and baking for about 7.5 minutes. The “cakes” were mostly a chocolate puddle on our plates, so I guess I’ll try baking longer next time and use half semi-sweet chocolate like I used to.

This is an excellent recipe!If I could rate it higher I would! I took the advice of others and baked these 12 min-they were perfect! It would look pretty & elegent with a squirt of caramel sauce on a china plate -invert the cake, dust it with conf sugar-place some fresh reaspberries and dollop of fresh whipped cream---wow--these are a perfect dessert to serve company.  You can make them ahead and pop into oven later--I will be making these again for sure.

It turned out good, I was looking for another recipe so I was disappointed... Anyway, I tried the recipe with original ingredients first. Turned out rich and tasty. Then I experimented another batch--this was good too (not as rich chocolate taste--lighter). Instead of butter and chocolate, I simply melted a bar of unsalted margarine, added cocoa powder and powdered sugar. Then continued the recipe the same way. After all, it is a good recipe, but not the best chocolate recipe.....

I also halved the recipe-turned out great! I melted the butter and Ghirardelli 60% cacao bittersweet chocolate in the microwave. I didn't want to break out the double boiler for such a small amount. I added 1/2 tsp vanilla to the eggs and sugar, and another 1/2 tsp of flour, as per recommendations. I sprayed my 8 oz ramekins (not sure how this would work well with 4oz ones-my batter filled the 8oz ones nearly 2/3 full,) liberally with cooking spray and baked them for 11 minutes. They unmolded beautifully and had delectably liquidy centers. Yum!

So easy and SO good!  I made these tonight on a whim. Used 1 stick salted butter and 2/3 cup Hershey's Special dark chips as that was what I had on hand. Added 1 tsp vanilla to the eggs, otherwise followed recipe exactly. Used Baker's Secret spray on ceramic ramekins set on a heavy jellyroll pan and they unmolded perfectly.  Topped with homemade whipped cream. Husband says it was the best dessert he has ever had.  Thank you!

Made this up impromptu for Valentine's Day - it tasted just like the restaurant kind, and was quite simple to put together!  The only thing I'd say is to bake maybe two minutes longer than the high time, as when I followed plating instructions, the molten poured out and then I scooped the cake out on top. Maybe, though, it just needed longer than 15 seconds on the plates? Anyhow, YUM!

This is the first time I made these and chose this recipe to do it. They didn't pop right out of the ramekins and was very liquid in the center.  They tasted great, but didn't look 5 star.

I only had dark chocolate, and the bowls were a little bigger than ramekins so it only made three.  I baked for 10-11 minutes and they were perfect.  This was an easy and impressive dessert.

Great recipe.  Added 1 tsp of vanilla.  Watch your cooking time carefully.  Easy to overcook and will continue to cook when removed from oven and allowed to sit a while.  Warms up in microwave good too.

I would have given this recipe a five star rating except for the fact that the cooking time was off. I think it needeed about 10 minutes in the oven I added some vanilla extract about 1/2 tb. The flavor was absolutely delicious. All in all we still ate the cakes but they were too runny. It went beyond lava cake to a full blown chocolate flood.

Whipped lots of air into the egg mix and baked about 9 minutes. Felt like I was eating a chocolate marshmallow with a surprise filling! Oh and I also did half milk half bittersweet chocolate, came out not too rich with a hint of vanilla.  This dessert was all about the texture and richness versus just the amount of sweetness. I'd love to experiment more with this recipe!

This was amazing! I doubled the recipe because I knew 4 would not be enough for my family. Instead of using 2 egg yolks per batch, I just used one; next time I might even try eliminating the egg yolks altogether and just use 2 whole eggs. Very easy and very delicious! I made them as a request from my mom and she loved it!

I made this on Thanksgiving for the family I work for instead of pie and they LOVED it.  I have had requests for it again in the near future.  I did have to bake it a little longer than posted, but in the end, it was delicious!

Here's a tip: instead of dusting with flour, use cocoa powder.  It leaves the outside chocolate colored instead of white/flour-y.

These were excellent.  I made more batter than needed and froze the extra--it baked up perfectly after scooping it out with an ice cream scooper!

My husband and I liked these but the kids just ate the gooey centers!  I baked mine for 11 minutes as we didn't want too much "lava" in the middle but still wanted some.  I also used semi-sweet chocolate and I'm glad I did.  Would make for company!

This recipe is so easy and makes an impressive dessert for company.  Best of all, the ingredients can be kept on hand for a quick treat without a trip to the store.  I have made these twice already.  One tip:  If you have a Calphalon or any other heavy hard-anodized aluminum saucepan, you can melt the butter and the chocolate together over very low heat, without a double boiler. The butter will melt first. Once the butter melts, shut the flame off and leave it on the warm burner for a few more minutes.  Then give it a stir to complete the melting process.  The mixture does not get very hot this way and you will not need to worry about "cooking" the eggs.  Be sure the mix is at room temperature before baking.  

I baked the cakes for 8 minutes and then let them sit for 2 minutes before unmolding.  This method worked well for me, using four 4-ounce Pyrex custard cups.

this recipe gave a baking time of 6-7 minutes... they were definitely still liquid after about ten minutes in a well-heated oven. however, i read a similar recipe stating to cook for 14-15 at 425 instead. sure enough, this did the trick! i used strawberries and real whipped cream, but next time i may try a milk chocolate and see how it turns out. great for valentine's day! :)

This dessert is very easy, but one of the best things I have ever eaten!  The only changes I made were to use sugar instead of flour on the greased ramekins, heated the chocolate and butter in the microwave (stirring every 30 seconds), and baked for 12 minutes.  Next time, I will try 9 or 10 minutes, because these were just barely solid.  Can't wait to make these again!

This cake is INSANE. And easy? OMGoodness, so easy.  I tell my friends if you can turn on an oven you can make this cake. WOW.  It is as good, if not better than the ones you buy at the finer restaurants.  Boy, did they have us fooled. We CAN make them at home.
 
I wish I could give it more stars as I made it exactly as the recipe states, but knowing my crotchety old oven I did increase the baking time by mere minutes [10 minutes total] as everything takes longer in my 20 year old oven.  I also used cocoa powder instead of flour to prepare the ramekins but that is simply a personal preference. Flour would work great too. A dusting of powdered sugar and a little homemade whipped cream and it's heaven on a plate. WOW!

Thank you, thank you, thank you!

This has to be one of the best recipes I've tried so far on this site.  Just awesome.  Only made half the recipe first time around.  The ingredient quantities made it very easy to only make half the recipe.  Used a muffin pan instead of ramekins, which worked pretty well.  Made unmolding the cakes a little more awkward, but nothing difficult.  I did have to leave them in the oven 2 minutes longer than the recipe calls for.  The very centre of the cake still looked a little wet when I took it out and it was perfect.  Gooey on inside but not too much so.  Great recipe.

Just had these wonderful cakes for Thanksgiving dinner dessert. Butterd three six-ounce pyrex bowls and dusted them with cocoa powder.  Used 1/2 cup of Ghirardelli 60% bittersweet chips.  Melted them with butter in the microwave on low for about one minute with no difficulties.  Beat the eggs, yolks and sugar for about three minutes till slightly thick.  Refrigerated finished batter till we started dinner.  Baked at 450 degrees for 12 minutes.  Turned cups over on serving plates and waited about 15 seconds.  DIVINE!!!  Try this recipe, you will not be sorry!!!

these were great.. I have to use brown sugar in most baked goods because the white sugar makes me itch. I made these with dark brown sugar and nestle choc chips. I cut everything in half for two people. I baked them in convection oven for 10 minutes on 425.. Then I served them with whip cream. What a great little treat for after dinner.Just the right amount of sweetness. I did run a butter knife down the sides of the baking dish before dumping onto the plate. This prevented any sticking problems I might have. very easy and super tasty. The brown sugar added a slight caramel taste to the end product

This cake is REALLY good. REALLY. but these few tips, i think, will make the recipe easier and more foolproof.
1) the quality of your chocolate really matters. I used Ghirardelli 60% chocolate chips. FYI, 6 oz of choc chips is 1 cup.
2) don't skip the egg yolks. For some reason, using whole eggs isn't as good. Hmmmmm...
3) there's really no need to flour the ramekins. if you "butter" them well, the cakes won't stick.
4) check the oven often. You don't want to undercook (too much "liquid") OR overcook (no "liquid"). I ended up keeping them in there for 11 minutes.
5) tap the ramekins to kill all air bubbles before putting them in the oven.
6) putting all of the ramekins on a cookie pan makes it easier to put them in/ take them out of the oven.
7) let the cakes cool for a few minutes before unmolding them. This will prevent the liquid center from coming out when you flip the cakes onto a plate. The middle should still be liquid though.

I hope these tips make life easier for you :) 
this recipe really is awesome!

This is a very easy recipe to follow and comes out similar to a souffle. However, I didn't use all bittersweet chocolate. I put in 1 cup of bittersweet chocolate chips but when that didn't seem to be chocolaty enough I added in 1/4 cup sweet ground chocolate. It still seemed to be a bit dull, but I didn't want to change the recipe anymore. It came out nicely, but the taste was quite dull and I could strongly taste the egg. I'm hoping next time I feel like eating chocolate this recipe will come out better~

Made this for Valentines day last night. The flavour was great but they didn't hold their shape coming out of the cups so they weren't visually appealing at all. Will probably make them again anyway since it was so fast and tasty. Maybe make 3 cups from the whole recipe, maybe the problem was my brulee cups are too big ?

absolutely wonderful recipe. I LOVE chocolate :) (who doesnt?) - some things I did a bit different but didnt affect the heavenly outcome -  I dont have a double boiler - so I use one pot inside another on top the stove -it works well so long as the smaller pot inside isnt too small so as to tip within the larger.  I also used a small cupcake pan (not quite mini's) I also didnt have enough bittersweet chocolate so I used milk chocolate pieces too. Just before serving I  crushed some Skors bars and put over the tops of each - next time my daughter wants me to put a bit of shredded coconut.  This is a fantastic recipe :)

This was easy and delicious! I served it to 24 seniors for a special Valentine dessert with a small scoop of French vanilla, a mint leave and  raspberry and sprinkled powdered sugar on top. They LOVED it! (Recipe times 4) I used 2 medium sized muffin tins, (sprinkled with cocoa instead of flour) baked them for 4 1/2 minutes and inverted them unto a parchment lined cookie sheet. Even after sitting for 5-8 minutes while I scooped the ice cream they were great.

Fantastic recipe, decadent & rich, really satisfies. It is worthy of company.  I have a son allergic to dairy and used dairy-free butter and it still came out delicious.  Will be making again and again.

These were good, and, unexpectedly, quite simple to make.  These came out of the greased ramekins perfectly, and the centers were just the right consitency.  These are very, very rich.  None of us could handle more than a few bites.  Only for the true chocoholic.

fantastic!!!!  i made these for my parents' 40th anniversary.  for 16 people.  each person had their own individual desserts  and it all looked very formal and dressy.  special.  i used 1/2 bittersweet 1/2 semisweet.  they were incredible.  got rave reviews from the whole family.  i had 6 or 7 oz ramekins so i had to times my recipie by 5 to have enough.  but they were amazing.  garnished with whipped cream a strawberry and a caramel drizzle.  so fancy.

Tasted great but mine stuck to my ramekins so not very pretty! Will definitely try again...I think they'll work if I get the cooking time perfect!

Delicious factor = 5 stars
Ease to bake correctly = 4

I baked this twice and maybe our oven is just a little finicky, but they looked like complete soup after 7 or 8 minutes, so we left them in a couple 2-3 longer and they turned out great! I just had to keep a close eye on them as I over-baked them the first time and there was no liquid center. Used semi sweet instead, as my boyfriend does not like more bitter chocolate, and we had it with vanilla ice cream, fresh strawberries, and a nice tawny port. Yum! Thanks for the great recipe!

I made these for Valentine's Day dessert and they were sinfully yummy! I baked them for about 10-11 minutes in ceramic ramekins. I had a little trouble getting them out of the ramekins, despite a thorough buttering and flouring from Boyfriend. Still tasted fantastic! Served with french vanilla ice cream.

Love it!  I wanted smaller serving sizes (for less guilt), so I made them in a muffin tin.  I got 6 muffin-sized cakes.  I used half bittersweet and half semi-sweet chocolate.  I baked them for 8 minutes and they had nice gooey centers.  My husband said they were perfect, but I might try 7 minutes next time because I like a little more of that gooey-ness.  I topped them with vanilla ice cream and raspberry sauce.  They were so pretty... and delicious.  Very easy and an impressive looking dessert to serve to guests.  TRY THEM, YOU"LL LOVE THEM!

This was an incredible recipe! I had no bittersweet chocolate, so I used two squares of unsweetened and two of semisweet, and the result was heavenly. Also, I followed the other suggestions and cooked it for 11 minutes, which resulted in a wonderful contrast between moist, cakey outside and gooey chocolate center. Very easy, very quick, and an amazing presentation. This is definitely going to become a staple dessert recipe!

I just made this recipie and I wish I could give you more stars!!! My husband and I had these on a cruise a couple of years ago and I got their recipie but it was for 3,000 servings and in metric and I am way to lazy to figure out what I really needed. But I am soooo happy to have found yours. Everyone must try these cakes. I served them with freshly whipped cream. I did use simisweet chocolate but only because it was all I had. I will try it with bittersweet next time (aka tomorrow lol) Thanks so much :)

I thought these cakes were fantastic! I didn't have baking chocolate (like baker's or ghiradelli), so I used 3/4 bar of hershey's dark chocolate for each cake I made...would have turned out better with real baking chocolate for sure, but still, 5 stars! Great recipe, very chocolate-y, and best served with powdered sugar and ice cream or freshly whipped cream. thanks for sharing!

I used 4-6 ounces of semi-sweet choc chips (Trader Joe's brand), margarine (out of butter), 1/2 tsp good vanilla, & 2 very heaping tsps of flour.  Baked them in 2 4-oz. custard cups & 1 bigger oval baker (didn't eat that one b/c we forgot about it).  The little custards turned out great after about 10 mins - very liquidy, but my husband liked it that way.  Will try again with better ingrediets soon! Yum but soooo rich!

It was absolutely fantastic! The only complaint I have is that when I baked them, the tops burned and i had to cut them off. I did as the recipe instructed, but it was less than 6 minutes before they started burning.  The rest of the cakes were still great.

this was AMAZING!  i followed some of the other recommendations (2 T flour instead of 2 t).  i also used 1/2 bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips instead.  i loved it and so did all my guests.  i was wondering if it would be good to take a lindt truffle and place it in the middle of the batter b/f baking???  can never have too much chocolate.  i almost wanted to go to the store, buy more ingredients and make it all over again!!  this will be made over and over!

Delish. Made this one over and over again. I use baker's chocolate (unsweetened) so it doesn't turn out too sweet. Pairs well with vanilla ice cream.

I used 2.5 tsp of flour and Hershey's semi sweet chocolate. I definitely agree with one of the reviewers who advised on using salted butter! Apart from these small tweaks, i pretty much followed it to the letter. I used Pam (baking) instead of butter+flour to grease the pan. I recommenf using a muffin tray as its so much nicer to serve each person an individual portion of this yummy goodness! Served it with some Rum n Raisin ice cream and it was incredible!!!! thank you for such an easy and wonderful recipe! :)

These were awesome. The most forgiving recipe. Didn't have enough chocolate or butter. Used 1/4c margarine,2 tbs butter and had 2tbs whipped cinnamon butter from a restaurant. Only had 4oz of semisweet chocolate, so I threw in 6tbs of dark coco powder. My husband loved it that night and reheated the next!

Phenomenal dessert!  I did not have bittersweet chocolate, so I used unsweetened, and increased sugar to 1/2 cup plus about 2 Tbsp sugar.  It tasted incredible, and looked just like the pictures here.  Thank you ever so much!

I make this for desert when I have people over for dinner and my guests are always impressed!  One tip: use a whisk to mix the chocolate into the egg mixture...it makes the batter fluffy and smooth.  Serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or whipped cream and some fresh fruit and voila! you have a gourmet dessert.

OK - I'm not sure what happened here because I followed the recipe exactly, but all I got was a goo-ey (although tasty) mess.  It seemed like it needed much more flour or a longer cooking time.

Woah. These are seriously, seriously, SERIOUSLY rich. Even after baking for 9 minutes, mine still came out a little too liquid-y for me. The one I unmolded came out of the ramekin fine, but the center was spilling out through a break in the side. I think I'll refrigerate the other three and see if I like them better that way. The flavor is phenomenal, though!

I like this recipe because it doesn't make a lot and you can easily cut it in half to make dessert for two people. I disagree with the reviewers who suggest a "sweeter" chocolate: Bittersweet is the way to go, and the ratio of chocolate and sugar is perfect. I added an extra tsp. of flour since I'm at high altitude, and I thought it might help the recipe--but no idea if it made any difference. At 7 minutes, mine was pretty "unset" in the middle, which was probably okay, but it made me nervous. I left it in a few more minutes and it baked almost all the way through (meaning little to no "goo," but the inside was still soft). I dusted one ramekin with flour and one with cocoa powder. The cake with the flour dusting came out of the dish "cleaner" with no breaks, but the cocoa-dusted ramekin produced a prettier cake. Overall, very tasty! UPDATE: I made this with an extra half tsp. of flour and baked for 7 minutes--came out set on the outside with a liquid center, just the way I imagine it should be. Put lots of fresh (real) whipped cream on there--the chocolate taste is so heavy, it needs something to balance it!

My boyfriend begs me to make these all the time and says they taste better than any lava cake he's had at a restaurant!  I use semi-sweet chocolate and bake for 10-12 minutes. You can easily microwave the chocolate/butter mixture instead of using a double boiler and whip them up in under 30 minutes!  Amazing.

This was really good! The only thing I did differently was to start with semi-sweet chocolate chips because that is what I had on hand and actually cooked for 9 minutes. Served with vanilla ice-cream, which actually levelled out the sweetness. My daughter(8) was upset she couldn't finish it all..but her brother helped her out! 5 stars because it was just so darned easy and just as good as the one at our local restaraunt! I even did all the mixing with a fork..no mixer!
Thanks for this recipe, I've been looking for it for a while!

Since we don't have ramekins or custard cups, I improvised and made these in the ceramic mugs that came with my dish set. The mugs worked perfectly well, because they are rounded a little at the bottom. We went out to dinner tonight  and saw these as a dessert. They were quite expensive, so I promised my husband I would find a recipe and make them for him tonight instead. They're great! I didn't have squares of baking chocolate, so I used 1/2 cup (4 ounces) of semi-sweet chocolate chips. (I followed the advice of other reviews and opted for semi-sweet instead of bittersweet chocolate.) Anyway, they did need to bake a bit longer than 7 minutes, but they're well worth the wait! Will make these again and again! Thanks for the great recipe! (And for making it easy to find with such a specific title!)

I made it exactly as the recipe stated because I had not read the reviews.  Three changes for the next time; 1-2 minutes longer in the oven, use semi-sweet chocolate and sugar the containers.  I served them with vanilla ice cream and they were a definite hit.  Thanks for another great recipe!

I read the previous reviews and baked this 10 minutes and let it sit for 15 seconds.  It was not liquid - only slightly soft in the middle.  Disappointing.  As far as the taste goes, it was not sweet enough.  I used Baker's Bittersweet chocolate.  I should have used Semi-sweet, in my opinion.  
It was ok, but I will look for another recipe.

This is absolutely yummy! I've made it twice and both times it turned out perfectly.  The first time I served it with vanilla whipping cream which was good.  But the second time I made a Raspberry sauce which I put in a sqeeze bottle and decorated the plate after inverting the cake.  I served it with vanilla ice cream.  Very fancy looking and very yummy.  Thanks for the recipe.

I've made this twice.  First time stayed true to the recipe with the exception of baking 12 minutes per previous reviews & letting ramikins sit for 2 minutes per reviews.  Unfortunately, they were moist in the center but not liquid.  Flavor was okay.  Second time added splash of vanilla extract, cooked for 9 minutes & sat in ramikin for 15 seconds before unmolding.  Cake unmolded nicely and held a rich liquid center.  Flavor was perfect!  A bit tempermental, but worth the experimentation to get it right.

These cakes are sooooo good.  I had this on a cruise once and never forgot how much I loved it.
These are so easy to make too.  You can make them ahead of time and just pop them in the oven when you are ready. Thanks for the great recipe.  I have made them 4 times already.

These were terrific - nice dinner party dessert served with fresh berries and whipped cream or ice cream. Maybe next time add a dash of liquor - hazelnut or chambord.

I made this cake for friends tonight. I used semisweet chocolate instead of bittersweet. It turned out really well. I baked them in large muffin tins, using a half cup measure. I se the time for 7 minutes, but had to add 2 more minutes to it. Served it with vanilla ice cream. Yummy.

It seems that there was an imbalance in the ingredients and though it turned out to be a wonderful chocolate goo, there was no cake to hold it together.  I had this in a restaurant once and I know it can be heavenly but it just didn't work out this time.

This was so yummy!  I followed the suggestion of others and cooked a bit longer and I'm glad I did.  I used glass custard cups and cooked for 10 min.  This was just perfect.  The cakes loosened nicely and didn't break at all.  I used semi-sweet chocolate chips as that was all I had, but we prefer it to bittersweet anyway.  Absolutely divine and very nice looking desert.  Sprinkled with powdered sugar and served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Will definitely make again!

I received some ghiardelli intense dark chocolate squares for my birthday and they were a bit dark for eating out of hand but perfect for this. I made as directed except for adding a couple of pinches of cinnamon and one pinch chili powder as flavoring since I didn't have any vanilla. I did use 2 tbsp flour rather than 2 tsp as recommended by some other reviewers.. They turned out luscious... roll my eyes back in my head luscious. Five stars for the cake but four stars for the recipe due to needing the adjustment

The first time I made this the texture was rubbery, and tasted like chocolate quiche.  I knew I must have done something wrong because there's no way something that terrible could have gotten so many good reviews, so I tried again tonight.  

The "secret" (which may have been obvious, but I guess not to me :) ) was to mix the eggs and sugar with an electric mixer.  I had done it by hand the first time which wasn't nearly enough.  You need a good two plus minutes with the mixer to make it thick and light in color like the recipe says.  That made all the difference.  One more note, I had to cook for 10 minutes.  When I took one of the ramekins out at 6 minutes and inverted it, it poured out from the middle and fell apart.  

At 10 minutes, the cakes had risen a lot more and even cracked on the top.  So that's what it looked like when it was perfect on the inside (so you'll know ;).  Tricky recipe for someone like me!  but very good.

Wonderful! I added a few tablespoons of Port and used dark chocolate. I followed others' suggestions to cook longer, but only needed 7 minutes, as at 8 they were over cooked.

These are the best and easiest Lava Cakes I have made.  I don't know how more easy they can get.  I didn't flour my ramekins I sugared them instead.  They released from the cups without issue...will be making these again!!

You should rename this to something like - Molten Chocolate Cakes. This turned out awesome and next day heated in microwave had my husband's co-worker calling me for the recipe. I emailed it to her. AWESOME.

Yumm!  We halved the recipe for two of us, using semi sweet chocolate and margarine (due to a dairy insensitivity).  I melted the margarine in the microwave and then stirred in the choco chips. I microwaved 10 seconds more and it was perfect! We baked 10 min per other reviews and this was perfect (it was not even close to ready at 7 min).  I served my DH's with ice cream and he said it actually was just as good plain.  A perfect (and easy) special night treat!

Amazing.  I will definitely make these again.  Poured a carmel sauce over the top and added a little whipped cream.  Ahhhhh.....

Increased the flour to 1 tbls and the baking time to  about 10 minutes.  Also I used sugar instead of flour to coat the ramekins, which made for a really nice little crunch to the outside. When unmolding, I ran a sharp knife around the outside, inverted the ramekin onto the serving plate, then waited about 30 seconds. When I tried to remove them too soon, they didn't unmold well. This was super-easy and absolutely delicious. I served mine with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream. Amazing.

So yummy! I made two bigger ramekins and let bake for a bit more.  I wish I had made more!  I used German 55% cocoa squares.

Yum!  Absolutely delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfect.  I would definitely recommend serving whipped cream and fresh fruit to cut the richness.

I made mini versions of these cakes in muffin tins and baked them for five minutes.  They turned out very well and best of all came out of the pan very easily.  They only took about 15 minutes to make which probably makes them the fastest dessert I have ever made.  The next time however, I think that I will add a little vanilla to give them a little more flavor.

Amazing and so easy! I melted my chocolate and butter in the microwave instead of double boiler. Oh, also I used Baker's semisweet squares and they worked just fine. Took about 10 minutes to cook in convection oven. I wouldn't bother flouring the ramekins either, I just greased them with shortening.

Excellent recipe!  There are some important points to follow. 1) Use the best quality unsalted butter; Irish butter is perfect. 2) Use the very best quality chocolate;  Trader Joe's Swiss 72% cacao dark chocolate is a good example.  3) Beat the egg/egg yolk/sugar mixture for a long time (as long as 5 minutes).  We also reduced the amount of chocolate to 3.5 oz., the amount of sugar to something less than 1/4 cup, and the amount of butter to 1/3 cup.  This dessert is very rich and a small portion goes a long way!

I totally botched the mixing instructions and it still turned out fabulous!  I mixed the egg, sugar and salt together all at once instead of adding the flour at the end.  I also nuked the butter and chocolate.  I used semi-sweet because that was what I had but I think I would have preferred the unsweetened chocolate.  I did half the recipe and baked it in a corning ware cereal bowl in the toaster oven for about 7 minutes but I think it was too long.  The cake was delicious but there just wasn't enough ooey gooey chocolate for my taste.

Incredibly easy.  I liked these best with half bittersweet half semi-sweet chocolate.  Definitely use salted butter.  Flour the dishes, they will come out easily.  I baked mine for 10 minutes and they were perfect.  I followed the other suggestions and added an extra tsp of flour.  Perfect.

Very souffle-like!  It was fairly easy to make and tasted great.  However, getting it out of the ramekins was fairly difficult.  The middle broke a little while trying to get it out, and didn't look too pretty once out.  I dusted it with powdered sugar and that helped, though.

This is such a decadently, sinful desert!  I didn't have any ramekins so I had to use 2 12oz pyrex dishes and it turned out just fine, only that my husband and I had to share one.  We topped it with powdered sugar and vanilla bean ice cream.  This is certainly a recipie I WILL make again and again.  SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOD!

These are super sweet - just be warned! Perfect for an after dinner chocolate fix. I'm not sure if I would use 1 ounce less of chocolate next time I made it, but would definitely consider it. Anyways, really sweet or not, I still feel it is a 5 star recipe.

As suggested I used a mixture of Ghiradelli bittersweet chips & Hershey's milk chocolate chips. I baked for 12 minutes as suggested, but next time will probably only bake for 10-11 minutes. I dusted it lightly with powered sugar, and served them with a scoop of homemade peppermint icecream, and garnished with blackberries and chocolate covered expresso beans. My family members raved! I will definitely be making these again.

I made these last night for my husband's birthday per his request.  We had tried a cake like this at a local high-end restaurant and loved it.  This recipe easily competes and is surprisingly easy.  I used the Ghiradelli Chocolate as other reviewers suggested and otherwise did exactly what the recipe said.  Will use sugar on the bottom next time - i used flour this time and although the cakes did not stick - I could see the flour on the bottom and it didn't look very pretty.  I think that I will also try to bake a few minutes longer - my cakes could have been slightly less runny.  Other than that a great recipe that I will continue to use.  Is a recipe that will impress guests.

I forgot about this recipe until I was faced with an impromptu dinner this evening and needed a quick dessert.  Beautiful, elegant, simple, and DELISH!  Used semi-sweet instead of bitter-sweet chocolate b/c it's what I had on hand.

Really good!! Tastes like the dessert from an expensive restaurant.  I used about 4-5 teaspoons of flour and a little more chocolate, I baked them for about 9 min, they were set on the outside and gooey on the inside.  These were super easy and really good!!

This is my new favorite dessert!!  It is incredible!  It is so easy to make, done in 10 minutes, and the best part is that you have half delicious chocolate cake and half warm, gooey chocolate.  We top it with a scoop of Haagen Dazs vanilla ice cream (not that it needs it) and, oh my gosh, it is heaven in a bowl!  The only caution I would is that I think you should always use a good quality chocolate.  We use Ghiradelli 60% cocoa chips (just over 1/2 cup) and it is wonderful.  I think if you use cheap chocolate (like Hershey's), you will end up with a whole different dessert. Seriously Russ, I'd drive over and kiss you if I could!  Thank you for such a simple but decadent dessert.

I love this recipe because it is 1) super fast 2) doesn't yield a ton of dessert that will hang around the house 3) is decadent 4) is easy 5) is yummy!

I half the recipe and use 4 very small ramekin cups (1/4 cup size) and because they are small I only cook them 4 minutes.

Also I usually don't have chocolate in the house so I substitute cocoa powder 3T cocoa powder + 1T oil for each chocolate square.  Use a good cocoa powder and you cannot really tell the difference.  For a lighter milk chocolate taste,  add cream instead of oil.

I love this recipe!  I halved the recipe and baked in 2 ramekins.  It was better than the molten chocolate cake I've had on cruises and fancy restaurants.  I liked the fluffiness of the cake; it was less dense than many other cakes.  I ate one cake after baking and the second one the next day.  The second ramekin did not have the liquid center after microwaving, but still tasted like a light brownie.  I love how it makes just the right amount of cake!

Wow!! this is like eating steam egg with chocolate taste. Very smooth eggy texture that melts in your mouth.

I did forget to flour the ramekins, maybe that's why it looks so horrible (it sunk down after few second out of oven), but it tasted great nonetheless.

I cooked this for 7 minutes and served it immediately out of the oven.  It was a bit too runny in the middle, I will definitely bake a tad longer next time.  But the plus was the next day it was a fabulous "mousse" consistency and was wonderful!!  Thanks for sharing.

Very good!!!  It seems like a dessert that would take a lot of time but it didn't.  I served mine with fresh strawberries, yum!  I also microwaved one the next day for 30 seconds and it was just like it came out of the oven, if not better.  :)  Thanks!!!

This was perfect ending to my Valentine's Day dinner for my fiance.  The only thing I probably did wrong was over cook it a bit where the center wasn't that liquidy.  But it didn't really matter because it was yummy and delicious with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.  It wasn't too sweet and the consistency was perfect even if there was no liquid center for us.  Will definitely make these again as I always have these ingredients in the house!

This recipe was just what I was looking for when my husband had a craving for molton chocolate cake.  It was so easy to make.  I substituted 1/4 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips because it was all that I had on hand, and the cakes turned out perfect!  delicious!

My husband and I thought these were fantastic...I used Ghiraradelli semi-sweet chocolate, but followed all other directions re: ingredients.  I baked in Pampered Chef custard cups (prep bowls), and placed them on a baking stone, baked in a convection oven on 425 for 12 minutes.  let cool for a few minutes before I inverted (2) of them - one broke, the other one looked perfect - they were delicious served w/ homemade raspberry sauce.

The other two -- I let them cool to room temperature on the counter, made sure they were loosened from the edge of the baking dish, and then put them in the fridge overnight in the container I baked them in - I served them cold the next day, inverted on a plate and served w/ hot raspberry sauce - we liked them even better this way - the liquid centers solidify and become a fudge/truffle like consistently and they were much easier to handle w/ out breaking.

Update - still great - do not forget to grease and flour the pan; I only greased mine and they stuck (my fault) - I served them with whipcream and raspberry sauce - everyone loved them.

The taste is great when there is a lot of lava.  However, I found that when there was less lava and more cake, I wasn't as convinced.  I made this 3 times so far with the addition of vanilla and a mixture of semi-sweet and bittersweet chocolate.  Since I'm at a high elevation, the cooking time was different.  I still don't know how many minutes would make the perfect cake.  But definitely a keeper when you have a chocolate craving.

I made these for my husband and they were a hit.  The liquid center is what makes this cake far better than any choclate lava cake.

Fantastic!!! It was a wonderful Valentine's Day dessert! I used ramikins and coated the insides with butter.  I then sprinkled sugar and cocoa inside to coat.  It left a wonderful texture! These sat in the frig for almost a day and we so perfect!! I just brought them out as I served dinner and let the oven pre-heat.  Popped them in and they were done in less than 10 minutes.  
We *will* enjoy these again!

I love this recipe and have made it several times.  Forgot to add the flour once and could hardly tell the difference, made the cake edges a bit less dense, but I loved it either way! I make sure I beat the eggs until they are very light and work alot of air into them and gently fold the chocolate into the egg mixture.  I don't add sugar to the ramekins but do use the cocoa powder.  I only use Ghiradelli chocolate, either bittersweet or semi-sweet.  I prefer the bittersweet as I don't have a big sweet tooth, but my honey likes semi-sweet the best so that is what I make most often.  
I have also had success at reheating the cake the next day...not quite as good as fresh out of the oven, but it is great for an after lunch treat.

These weren't bad... the cake part tasted a bit weird, and I followed the reviews and coated the ramekins in a mix of sugar and cocoa...yummm but next time I'd use 2 oz semi sweet and 2 oz unsweetened instead of 4 oz unsweetened. And I'd use smaller ramekins than 4 oz because this dish is very rich.

I liked the gooey center but the cake part wasn't that great =\ it tasted more like tough custard than cake, i think the two egg yolks was an overkill or maybe I just overbeat it.

This was wonderful. And it was super easy. Melted butter and chocolate in microwave for 1 3/4 minutes. Baked cakes in 8 ounce ramekens for about 11 minutes. What a great dessert with such little effort. Would be a great dessert for your special valentine.

I am the ultimate chocoholic and this earned my approval.  Not too sweet, just the way I like it.  For me, the darker(more bitter) the chocolate, the better.  So, if you do not love dark chocolate, I would recommend adding a little more sugar.  And yes, do bake for 12 minutes. =)

I've tasted delicious cakes with liquid centers before, so I tried this recipe because it seemed easier than some and required less eggs.
It was good, but not excellent. The outside of the cakes were too soft. Cooking them longer might help. I don't think I'll do them again, except if I am really craving those cakes but don't want to work too much in the kitchen.

My 11 year old daughter made this recipe. Based on the other reviews, we cooked it about 4 minutes longer. The cakes were excellent. She dusted the cakes with powdered sugar and then served them with vanilla ice cream! A treat beyond words!

If I could give this recipe 6 stars, I would!  I first made this dessert for a special Valentine's Day dinner, and it was the highlight of the evening--very simple and quick, yet extremely elegant.  I prepped the batter and serving cups ahead of time, and then popped them into the oven during the entree.  The ooey gooey centers make this cake so delicious that it's nearly sinful!  Serving suggestion:  fresh berries, vanilla ice cream, a dusting of powdered sugar and a mint sprig.

I absolutely LOVED this dessert! It definitely tastes better  with some vanilla ice cream. I also added some fresh strawberries and whipped cream to romance it up a little for my husband and I. It didn't quite come out of the cups perfectly, maybe I didn't butter them up enough, but it tastes so great who cares about whether it came out perfect or not. My husband was also absolutely in love with this dessert. I will definitelly make it again!!

The taste was very good...rich and chocolatey. We used Lindt 85% cocoa chocolate....I think that you have to use top quality chocolate as stated,...if you don't follow the recipe as given, you can't expect it to be as good as the recipe given. 

We let them sit for a bit and they sank in the middle, but of course that doesn't affect the flavour. They were not gooey or liquidy, perhaps because our oven is fanforced, so they cooked a bit more...still very moist though. The children found it a bit rich, but I loved them. Better for adults I think.

Truly superb! My husband asks for this all the time and I get cravings for it. A chocolate lovers delight and so quick to make. Ridiculously impressive at a dinner party, but for everyday it also works well with cocoa and sugar instead of the chocolate as other reviewers have suggested. Thanks so much for this recipe!

I was really scared to make this recipe. I didn't have a double boiler or the 4-4oz ramekins. I made a makeshift boiler and had 2-7oz ramekins. It worked great! I put whipped topping on top and it was a hit! Great dessert to share with your hunny!

Got to repeat what Russ says: make sure you use top quality chocolate.  We also found that we needed to cook it a bit longer.  But what a delight when you get it right!

I tried this recipe out as an experiment because I was not sure how it would come out.  They were fast and easy and my family cannot wait for me to make them again.  My mother said they were one of the best desserts she had ever had.

Hmm - I put this in a toaster oven for 8 minutes, by then it was just beginning to burn.  I inverted...and 3/4 of it fell out - uncooked - just liquid!!!  I'll have to experiment with this one more.  The flavor though, was out of this world; just awesome.

I saved this recipe a year ago and just recently tried it for an at-home dinner date with my husband.  It was sinfully delicious and very easy to make.  Definately will do it again. (I used 2 large ramkins and we shared-turned out just fine)

My family loved it.  It's an amazing recipe with very little flour.  Don't cook it until you think it is done.  Stick to 6 minutes! It takes just a minute to over cook and the lava doesn't flow.

It was not chocolaty enough. I added two table spoons of cocoa powder, and walnuts. It could have used a pinch of salt and a bit more sugar.

Hubs made last night & I was kind of disappointed. Liked that the cake had enough liquid center oozing out, but the cake was just so so.  I guess I was expecting more of the cake for taste. There is another recipe on this site I want to try before a decision is made if I'll keep this & try to improve on.  I do think raspberries would be good on top with the sprinkling of powder sugar.  We used just powder sugar.  Maybe we'll have to try with whip cream also.

Yummy goodness.  I serve right out of the oven with French Vanilla Ice Cream.  These are something to make for small gatherings ... too many ramekins is a pain and somewhat chaotic

Fantastic! For a Gluten free version  I used Fine brown rice flour and added a teaspoon of cocoa powder .  I also greased and dusted the ramekins with coca powder.  Baked 10 minutes and they were  perfect !  This will be a go to dessert for the chocolate lovers in my life.

If you like chocolate, make these!!! My husband and son are chocoholics so I'm always looking for new recipes. I made this tonight and they both said this is the best dessert I've ever made! I followed the advice of others and melted the butter and chocolate in the microwave (25 seconds then stirred and then another 15 seconds and stirred until the chocolate melted). I used ghirardelli 60% bittersweet cacao. I also baked it for a little over 10 minutes. The first one broke when I inverted it, so I waited about 5 minutes before flipping the others and they came out perfectly. (Don't fret if they break, they taste just as good!!) I served them with vanilla ice cream.  I can't wait to make these for company!!!

I have made this cake several times - we love it!  It is easy and quick.  I didn't expect it to turn out the last time that I made it because I didn't have butter and I was 2 tablespoons short of having enough stick margarine.  I used 2 tablespoons of tub margarine instead.  It still turned out!  I always just use 2 eggs and don't mess with adding just egg yolks.  Sometimes I use sugar on the baking cups, but used flour that last time. Sometimes we invert the cups and sometimes we just eat the cake out of the cups. They are great either way.  I always melt the chocolate and butter/margarine in the microwave.  I love this yummy, easy dessert!

Super quick. Super easy. I halved the recipe easily and followed other reviewers about the cooking time. I cooked for 10 minutes and I wish I'd follwed the original recipe time because I wanted a very gooey center. The only issue I have is that where it says beat the chocolate and butter while pouring? Makes no sense, it should say beat the eggs while pouring chocolate into it. 
You have to make this right now it is AWESOME. Perfect with vanilla ice cream on top!

I cooked for 9 minutes based on others reviews and the center was no longer liquid.  I will go with the original recipe next time!  Also, I think powdered sugar on top is definitely necessary for optimal sweetness as the cake itself isn't very sweet.

Absolutely delicious! Better than the 5 star restaurant that is known for these! Only change I made was bake time. Mine took about 10 minutes. We garnished with strawberries, whipped cream and powdered sugar. Will be making these again...soon!

This recipe is very good but be aware that the proper ramekins are a must!  I decided to improvise and use my smaller rock glasses and it just wouldn't slide out the way it should but to make do I served them in the glass and it came out "looking good" (as one of my guests said).

Wow! So easy and very delicious! Didn't have squares of chocolate so I substituted 1 T oil to 3 T cocoa each for two of the squares and 1/2 C semi sweet chocolate chips each for the other two (so a total of 2T oil, 6T cocoa and 1 Cup chips). Greased and sugar dusted the muffin tins. Cooked for about 8 minutes - no longer. They tasted great the day after too - kind of like a cake with a pudding or chocolate icing center. Definitely making these again.

It needs to cook longer. I used semi-sweet chips because that's what I had on hand but it turned out excellent.

I've made these a few times and we totally love them!  This time I added about 1 T unsweetened cocoa powder to my semi-sweet chips (b/c that's what I had), dusted my ramekins with cocoa powder, and cooked them 10mins.  They turned out the perfect consistency.

Amazing!  While I can't figure out how these bake up to cakes with only a tiny bit of flour in them, they were amazing!  Definitely company worth.  Served with freshly whipped cream.  One word...DIVINE.

Excellent recipe with a very rich chocolately flavor!  I made these for my friends birthday and served each with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream.  This dessert is identical to one that's served at our favorite fine dining restaurant in town.  I had a problem with mine sticking - I used vintage aluminum 4 oz. Jello molds coated with butter and flour but the cakes would not release.  That wasn't a big deal as we were all happy enough to eat them out of the molds.  Excellent flavor!  I used Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate and unsalted butter.  I will be making these again for Valentine's Day! :)

This is "death by chocolate". After a portion or two you can really rest in peace, perfect. 
It is not a good idea to microwave leftovers, because they do get dense, like a soft cake, and the soft centre is lost. If you have no choice, microwave it for 10 seconds at half capacity.

This was a very good tasting cake although I took the advise of cooking it 10 min. instead of 7 and also in a muffin tin, which made the cakes smaller and there wasn't any liquid center.Next time I will use the custard cups and try it for the 7 min.It was still very good and we put ice cream over the warm cake.

Wow!! These little babies are a chocoholic's dream!  I did add just a little vanilla, these were wonderful!  Made them for my husbands birthday and how easy to make, but what a stunning presentation! Will be making these again and again, maybe experimenting with other types of chocolate!

Very impressive and very easy!! I greased (but skipped the flouring) 4 pyrex custard cups.  Used half bittersweet and half semisweet.  Melted the chocolate and butter in the microwave, stirring every 30 seconds (took 2.5 to 3 mins) I put them together a couple hours before we had dinner and just popped them in the oven after dinner. I'll definitely make again.

I followed the recipe -- except I had to use unsweetened chocolate (I only had unsweetened chocolate).  I added 2 tbs of sugar to the butter & chocolate mix.  The end result was delicious, but it felt like something was missing.  Nonetheless, a chocolate crisis was solved in 15 minutes (including prep and baking time).  Next time, I am going to try the recipe with bittersweet chocolate.

these were very good. i did leave them in the oven about 11 minutes, 6-7 minutes just didnt look like they were ready. it might of been a little too long though cause they did not come out of the ramekins very easy, so i had a pile of cake and lava! but they tasted really good! next time, i will butter, or maybe even oil the ramekins so they come out easier. served with vanilla ice cream. my boyfriend loved them with his birthday dinner!

I'm picky about giving out five stars but it was really, really good. I served it with a razzzz-berrry sauce which was: about a cup of fresh berries, 1/4 cup water and corn syrup to taste. The sauce could have been better but I made it up out of my head and it was nice flavor with the deep chocolate. The outside held up well and the inside was just runny enough. Baked at about 450 (my oven was at 425 when I put it in) for 5 minutes then left it in a few minutes longer (without really timing it). Followed recipe exactly using Ghiradelli. Served it with real whipped cream. Would definitely make it again for company, a romantic dinner or a friend that needs cheering up.

I made this when we had another couple over for dinner from my husband's office.  I was really looking forward to an impressive rich chocolately dessert.  I was so dissapointed and even embarrassed with the outcome.  I cooked them for 9 minutes then took one out and tried to plate it- it was a runny mess.  I left the others in the oven for another 3 minutes- I didn't want them to be too cakey but wanted them to at least stay in a cake form until ready to eat.  What I had to serve was chocolate soup on a plate.  I followed directions.  Maybe I will try to double the flour next time.

This is a delicious quick easy dessert. My family prefers it with a semisweet chocolate and I accidentally increased the flour to 2 tbs instead of 2 teas and it was still great.

This was delicious.  I like others used semisweet chocolate chips and a little less than 1/2 c of butter because that's what I had on hand.  I buttered and cocoa/sugared the ramikins.  I used 2 7 oz ones and it worked out fine.  I cooked them for about 13 minutes for great lava and topped it with warmed rapsberry preserves and vanilla ice cream.  I will be making these again soon.

Wonderful!  I have tried several recipes for these and like this recipe the best.  It takes a bit longer to bake them though and be sure to run a knife around the sides of the ramikan before flipping it.  You will love it!

These were wonderful! The perfect chocolate fix. Hubby liked them too. I used Semi-Sweet chips and baked them for 9 minutes. Next time I'll bake less time to have more lava. Be sure to butter and flour the pan really well or they will stick. Great recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly, and my cakes had jiggly centers at 7 minutes (the test that they were done as written in other reviews).  I used a rose-shaped silicone 6-cup "pan" for these, and all but one came out whole (one was still too runny).  I used unsweetened baker's chocolate and added 4 tbsp. sugar while the chocolate melted to make it bittersweet.  My hubby loved them. Happy Valentine's Day!

YUM so so good.  When I inverted the cake out of the ramekin, I inverted it onto ice cream so when the warm venter oozed out, it was kind of like a liquid topping :-)

I gave this recipe only 4 stars because it should have included a few more detailed instructions.  Unfortunately, I forgot to read everyone's great tips here before I tried this recipe.  I baked them for about 8 minutes or so, and probably because of that, they were so gooey that they had to be scraped out of my Corelle ramekins.  However, I will not complain at all about the taste, which was fabulous!  I only had Nestle unsweetened chocolate squares, to which I added roughly 2 Tbsp. of semi-sweet chocolate chunks.  This idea I got from Baking911.com.  Are you kidding?  Of course I will make these again!

These are way too easy to make!  I'm afraid I'll just be making them anytime I need a fix! I prepared them ahead of time and baked them for 15 minutes.  Centers were liquid and hot and they unmolded easily onto plates.  Great recipe.

This recipe is delicious!  I made this for Sunday night dessert, although my husband is more of an apple pie kind of guy...  Well, he LOVED this - said he felt like he was at our favorit restaurant (and also one of the most expensive ones that we go to - needless to say, the desserts there are incredible...).  What a compliment!  I cut the recipe measurements in half, since it was just the two of us, used plain old "Baker's" chocolate, and served it with homemade whip cream.  It was absolutely fantastic.  Thank you so much!

Flavor on these was very good, but be very careful with your baking, these are tempermental little cakes. Mine were a mess, presentation-wise. I prepared ahead and refrigerated for a few hours, put them on the counter while the oven preheated (20 minutes or so) and then baked. I knew they would take longer to cook, but the big problem was that the tops started to burn and the inside was still totally uncooked. I tried to unmold one and it just poured out of the ramekin. Ended up eating out of the dish...Will probably try again, but will adjust cook temp/time...

Fast, easy and delicious.  My husband compared it to one we shared in a chocolate Bento Box from Nobu restaurant in Tokyo.  A huge compliment to say the least.  I had it near the top of the oven and half didn't set well.  Will lower next time and add a minute or so.    Thank you for posting.

Yummy! I tried this for the first time for a dinner party and got lots of compliments. I had to use one oblong ramekin and this one cooked more than the round ones so didn't have the liquid center, but was still delicious. I cooked for 10 minutes and the others were perfect. Impressive, super-easy dessert!

This recipe is the ultimate chocolate fix!  It's also easy to whip up to impress company - and has dramatic flare to boot.  I recommend eating w/ ice cream or whipped cream.

I found this recipe disappointing. The inside of the cake was liquid and the outside cooked but the cake itself was soggy. I don't think that it was anything to do with my cooking- I think it was the recipe itself. The taste also was uninspiring- it tasted like a mediocre self- saucing chocolate pudding. 
However, there is an up side to this story. I made the mixture another time and baked it in a 9 inch pie tin for six minutes. It turned out to be a very flat cake. There was no liquid center, but it was the most lovely moist chocolate cake. If you chill it, you end up with a fudgey chocolate slice. I would give the original recipe 2 stars, but it gets 3 because the ingredients work well when baked a different way.

Without hesitation my family all agreed that this was a five star recipe.  I used regular semisweet Bakers brand chocolate.  I baked the cakes for 11 minutes.

YUM! My fiance does not love dessert, but when he had a very similar cake at a restaurant and flipped out over it, I  knew I needed to find a recipe to duplicate it at home. I agree, use a good quality bittersweet chocolate, it makes a big difference. I used Ghiradelli, and also added 1 Tablespoon of Ghiradelli cocoa into the mix at the end. I refrigerated the mix in the ramekins overnight and it worked out great. Topped with vanilla ice cream, incredible.

This is delicious and so easy.  It was a little runny at 7 minutes, so I left it in for 10.  Sprinkled some confectioners sugar on top and a scoop of ice cream on the side.  Mmm...

My husband is always in search of the ultimate "sweet treat" and this is it.  I followed the recipe exactly (used Ghirardelli chocolate) and it comes out perfectly.  I've made these at least 5 times so far with great results - I highly recommend it!

I cooked it for 10 min. then, because it looked too runny, another 2 min.  I should have stopped at 10, it still was gooey, but not pouring out liquidy.  Very good, nonetheless and we'll make it agian.  We served it with vanilla ice cream - divine!

This was outstanding. I made it for my husband for Valentine's Day. I used Ghardelli bittersweet Chocolate and I also cooked it a few more minutes than stated. If I didn't, it would have been a plate of goo. I sifted powder sugar on top and garnished with raspberries. This recipe is a must for chocolate lovers and to make an impression. YUM! Thank you!

Easy, decadent, amazing!
If you are a chocolate lover, you MUST try this!!
I also like to sometimes serve a scoop of premium (or better...homemade) vanilla ice cream with this.

Russ...you are awesome.  A local rest. serves this and charges $15 for it.  I was excited when I found this.  I found it does need a cooked a little longer than recipe states.  If using a convection oven, the temp is a little lower also.
