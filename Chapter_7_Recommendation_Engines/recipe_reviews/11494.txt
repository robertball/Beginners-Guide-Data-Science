Wonderful recipe especially if you like rum.   Letting these bars sit overnight (well wrapped) brings out the rum flavor  -  yummy.   Thanks.

More like a cake than a bar cookie.  I kept waiting for it to brown and only did around the edges.  Good flavor and love the icing, but overall was disappointed.  The recipe is written in such a way that it does not define what the icing is and what ingredients go into the bar - I could figure it out, just think it should be defined better.

These are fabulous. Very easy to make and they have a very light cake texture. Just the right amount of rum and raisins for a great tasting combo.

I used gluten free flour for this.  When making the glaze, i added 2 T extra powdered sugar so the butter could blend in. These are great tasting bars!

I was worried that the rum flavor would be too strong, but it was just right. That said, while I liked the cake, it's definitely missing something. Needs a spice or something to take it from good to great. I'll play with the recipe and see if I can't figure out what it needs to take it up to 5 stars.

I made this to give to my rum-loving stepdad who isn't a big fan of sweets. He loved it! Definitely a strong rum taste, but they were delicious.
