This recipe is a copycat of a great sandwich I used to get at Penn Station all the time.  I got SO TIRED of paying 10 dollars for a (delicious!) sandwich and decided to learn to make it myself.  The Penn Station version uses melted provolone instead of parmesan, which you are welcome to do, but the parmesan adds more flavor than the provolone without the added fat!  Also, feel free to add mayo as you like.  I think it has plenty of goodness without!

I made garlic bread (french bread, marg, & garlic salt), mixed mushrooms and artichokes as directed (using parmesan) and topped the bread with the mixture. Sprinkled some shredded cheese on top and popped in toatser oven to melt. The open-faced version is the way to go...less bread, more healthy. Or you could eat two of them like I do!

SO SO SO Good!!!  This has so much flavor!  I did drizzle some olive oil on the bread before toasting it and added a little mayo to the sandwich cause I have to had to have some condiment.  Thanks!

This recipe was good!  I used 1tsp garlic powder and 1 tsp onion powder instead of the garlic and onion seasoning.  In stead of making these on a french baguette, I made these an open faced sandwich!  All I did was lightly toast some bread and cook the artichokes and mushrooms as described.  When the artichoke/mush mixture was done, I topped the toast with a quarter of the mixture and threw it back into the oven for 5 minutes or so.  Some additions that will be made next time:  I will probably add some type of shredded cheese to the top when baking in the oven.  I will also probably add some french fried onions to the top as well.  overall, this was a GREAT vegetarian (you could even make this vegan by replacing the parmesan cheese with nutritional yeast) meal.  It is a very satisfying meal!

I did change the recipe (sort of), instead of using an onion/garlic seasoning, i just added a handful of chopped spanish onion and 2 minced garlic cloves to the mushrooms and artichoke mixture.  Is very delicious! I definitely think parmesan is the way to go on this one.

Hubby helped his pregnant wife out tonight and made me this for dinner. He threw in some leftover orange bell pepper and used rosemary sourdough bread. The filling is just awesome. I loved these sandwiches, they are very flavorful and we didn't miss all of the gooey cheese one bit! The parmesan was just perfect. I would highly recommend this recipe as is, or to use up any leftover veggies like we did. Thank you!

LOVED this! I used ciabatta rolls, that I split, drizzled with olive oil and topped with garlic powder and asiago cheese, before toasting, just for extra flavor. Also, I melted some mozzarella on top and made 'Roasted Garlic Dip' from here to use as a sandwich spread, and it went perfectly together! I really, REALLY enjoyed this as an alternative to a 'meat-filled' sandwich (even hubby enjoyed it!) and I would definately make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

My favorite sandwich now! Totally delicious, the second time I tried some home made barbecue sauce! I will try the Tip for using foil by wrapping the baguette for browning and it keeps the bread from getting too hard.
