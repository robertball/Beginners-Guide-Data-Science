I loved this dish! I added more crumbs on top of the chicken prior to broiling, because the original coating didn't stick very well. I would also recommend bringing the marmalade to room temperature, or microwaving it--easier to spread that way.

I love this recipe with Trader Joe's orange/apricot marmalade. Between marinading for a few hours, and adding the coating, the chicken always comes out very moist and flavorful.
