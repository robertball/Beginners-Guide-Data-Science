Yum.. can't wait to make this again.  I was missing dry sherry so I subbed white wine and a little rice wine vinegar. Quick to make and reheated well... I kept potstickers separate in fridge so they didnt soak up all the broth

What a great idea to use pot stickers for a fast and delicious soup.  It's an instant meat, flavour and noodle addition to leftover fridge vegetables.  I didn't add the ham as it was fine with just the meat in our pot stickers.
