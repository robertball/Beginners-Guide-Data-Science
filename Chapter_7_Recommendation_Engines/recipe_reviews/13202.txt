I made this soup 2 days ago and it is no more it was awesome. I tripled the recipe added a teaspoon of cinnamon for warmth omitted the rice and my family loved it. I could eat this almost everyday... I have for the last two days. I used thighs instead of breast and instead of water I used chicken stock. It was gggggrrrreat!

Better than southern homeade veggie soup fresh from the garden!  I used both red bell pepper and carrots, extra spices (especially cumin), and substituted potatoes for rice.  We can't stop eating it and it made plenty to share.  MANY thanks to the submitter!!!

Awesome soup! This soup turned out SO well!  You can def. add any veggies you want.  I didn't use tortillas, to keep it healthier and it's still amazing. I would suggest, however, to season your chicken/stock with salt and pepper while it's cooking.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a very hearty soup. Used Tortilla Soup II as a base and went from there. I added more canned diced tomatoes and a 32-ounce bag of Fiesta Blend veggies (corn, onion, black beans, peppers) so I didn't include the rice. Wasn't needed because this was so think, more like a stew. Increased the amount of cumin and used frozen diced onions as a timesaver.

This was a fantastic soup that you can really tailor to your likes. I made a couple of minor changes to this to be able to freeze this. I didn't add the cilantro simply because I forgot to. I skipped the green onion and used regular onion instead. We really enjoyed this soup and look forward to eating this for lunch tomorrow and freezing the remainder.

I used only one can of tomatoes and we added lime juice at the table.  Put in a couple of mild green peppers too.  Excellent flavor, beautiful color, and lots of it--perfect for company or for freezing leftovers.  Great way to get rid of stale tortilla chips too!

Very good; broth was just a little plain, however. Next time I'll use only one can tomatoes and less cilantro.

This recipe is a regular in my house. I've never tried another tortilla soup recipe and probably never will because this was the first I tried and it is great. I add a little more cumin and pepper to give it the kick we like.

This was awesome soup!! I started with chicken legs, onion and garlic to make the broth and added a bunch of extra veggies- carrots, peppers and cabbage. Following other reviews I added more cumin and sprinkled a little extra in the bowl for serving. I don't have access to cilantro (which I LOVE!!) but this soup was well flavored without it.

Delicious!!  I added carrots, tripled the cumin, and doubled the cayenne.  I also used 4 chicken breasts rather than a whole chicken.  Such a good, hearty meal!

For a lower-salt version, we left out the bouillon cubes...it was still delicious! Used one can of tomatoes and substituted black beans for corn. Very healthy yet hearty. Love this recipe!

I made a couple of changes but nothing that would change up the recipe entirely. I did not make my own stock but used chicken breast and broth instead and, I left out the bouillon. Very flavorable and one I will make again.

This is a really good recipe!  I did make some modifications, first I used a rotissary chicken from Walmart so I could skip the first step.  So instead of using the water from cooking the chicken I used low sodium chicken broth.  The second change I made was to use brown rice instead of white.  I will probably reduce the amount of rice to 1 cup next time.  Lastly, it's a bit confusing because the ingredient list calls for red pepper but the directions say to add "carrots" and doesn't say anything about the red pepper.  I had both so I added both in.  Turned out delicious!  One warning...it is a little spicy so you might cut back on the cayenne pepper if you don't like that but overall a great recipe!

I liked this soup, as did my kids. Hubby thought it was missing something. We did think it was better the second day though.

This is OK but I usually make this Tortilla soup recipe I found on here and I like my usual recipe much better.  I probably won't make it again.

I followed this recipe pretty closely, but I did use a leftover chicken that I had roasted the day before and I used 2 cans of Rotel tomatoes for an extra kick. I did every thing else the same and it was WONDERFUL. This will go in to my favorites folder.

I would have given this recipe 5 stars if it had been creamy.  The flavor was wonderful!  I did add a little extra ground cayenne pepper and one tablespoon of lime juice, no celery, no rice.

Wow! delicious and easy to prepare. I used four split breasts with ribs and boiled for 45 min when I shredded them later they were perfect. I added carrots and frozen corn, along with a can of black beans with jalapeños. Loads of dried cilantro and cumin, along with some ancho chili seasoning I had in the pantry. Served with corn bread and it was a big hit. Thanks for a great recipe :)

This was the first soup recipe I ever tried and it was delicious even with a few changes. I did half the servings and didn't use a whole chicken. Instead I just boiled 1 lb of chicken breast. For most of the spices however, I kept the quantities as written. I used half water and half chicken broth (which I think I will cut down the amount of chicken broth and increase the water because it was a little salty). I added a little bit of taco seasoning because it's mostly cumin anyway along with the cumin. I didn't add celery, white pepper or peppers and it still tasted delicious. Will definitely make again!

This was great.  The only reason I gave it 4/5 stars was because I was hoping for a little bit creamier/cheesy taste.  That is just a personal preference.  Family loved it.

Wow, my family raved over this one. I made a few changes based on the other reviewer's suggestions.  I increased the cumin to 3/4 teas., the cayenne pepper to 1/2 teas. and added 1/4 teas. of cinnamon...really brings out the flavors. I served mine with lime flavored tortilla chips-yummy! This recipe is a keeper!

Excellent recipe.  Used chicken breasts instead of whole chicken.  Also, added red bell peppers.  Directions are a bit careless but easy to follow (some ingredients are labelled differently in the directions vs. the list.  Definitely recommend.

I used the recipe for spices and I tried to make a healthier version. Substitute quinoa for rice, a package of frozen veggies, land low sodium tomatoes. I had purchased a Sam's Club chicken, so did not add any salt! I put diced avocado on top of crumbled tortilla chips. A VERY YUMMY soup!!!

I made this soup last night and added a couple more ingredients, but it still came out delicious.  I added a California chili, green peppers, kidney beans, and half a Serrano pepper.  it was perfectly spicy.  I didn't take a pic of the finished product, but here are a few of the process.

We thought this was great!  Per other reviews and because this was all I had on hand, I used 1 can of Rotel tomatoes and 1 can tomato sauce.  The recipe doesn't state when to add  the red pepper, but I finely chopped it and added it where it states white pepper.  A can of black bean or two would be great. You could easily omit the rice.  We finished it off with some chips, avocado and a squeeze of lime.

WE LOVED THIS!! However, we halved the recipe and it still made enough for 2 people to eat for a week. We added chili powder and added more cayenne pepper than it asked for and it still wasn't very spicy.  Next time may try Hunt's Fire Roasted Tomatos.  But we used Trader Joe's Fire roasted corn and it gave it so much more flavor.  Also used 1/2 can Goya black beans,and substituted black pepper for white pepper.

Topped with crushed tortilla chips and 4 Mexican cheese (shredded) Delicious!!

Lack of flavor. It was okay but needed more of everything or a quart less water. How much cilantro is 2 bunches?

This soup tasted very good.  I only used one bunch of cilantro and I think it was plenty.  I also didn't have any green onions, so I just left them out.

This soup had amazing flavor, however it was too brothy for my liking.  I will make again, substituing Rotell for one can of diced tomatoes and reduce cooking liquid.

This is the best chicken soup I have ever tasted.  The first time I followed the recipe to it's exact.  It was perfect.  My children wanted it like it is served at this Mexican restaurant we go to, so instead of adding white rice, I made the recipe called Mexican Rice II.  I made the soup without any rice and added the Mexican Rice II to the soup as we ate it.  My children really liked it this way, but I the rest of the family (all the adults) liked it with the white rice.  It's awesome with cheese quesedillas! Thank you for sharing!

I made this for my family, they said it was ok, not like the tortilla soup we get back in Texas at a small Mexican food restaurant we went to all the time. I would like to try to make again.
