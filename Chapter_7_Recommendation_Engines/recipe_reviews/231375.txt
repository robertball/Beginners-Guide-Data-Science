As this recipe's first reviewer, I'm happy to report that these were indeed "divine." I loved this recipe, with its additions of truffle oil and fresh parsley, but to ensure "french-fry crispiness," I felt it would need a higher cooking temperature, so I upped it to 425 degrees and adjusted the time accordingly - 25 minutes was just right for the thickness of potatoes I used, which I flipped half way through the cooking time.  I coated them with olive oil rather than cooking spray, and finished them with a fragrant, good quality truffle oil I brought back from Italy.  Truffled potato bliss.

Cooked at 400 degrees to achieve crispier potatoes, and I was not wild about the flavor of truffle oil on french fries.  I received a bottle for a Christmas gift and, admittedly, I have not yet cooked too much with it.   Truffle oil has a very distinct flavor, and personal taste preferences will kick in, but doubtful I'll use it again on french fries, but there were no leftovers either.

I first tried french fries with truffle oil at a cafe in San Francisco and loved them ever since. These are along those lines but I added grated Asiago cheese over them, makes them really divine!

Oh YUM!  Thank you - I adjusted the oven temp to 400 degrees and cooked for a total of 30 minutes.  I used minced garlic and black truffle oil.  So good.  I wish I'd maybe cooked them a bit longer as my potatoes were large, but otherwise, truly divine!
