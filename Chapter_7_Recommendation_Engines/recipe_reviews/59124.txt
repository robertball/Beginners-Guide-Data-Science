Thanks to frozen puff pastry, these are quick and simple with great results. No need to bother with soaking the apples in lemon amd water. Also, I just mixed the cornstarch in with the brown sugar mixture, with no additional water, and cooked the apples until tender and the juices had thickened, then added a little vanilla. After filling and closing the turnovers, I secured the edges by pressing them with a fork, and slit a steam vent in the top. A fantastic bakery-style dessert just doesn't get any easier than this!

First of all, make sure you use an egg wash! Next time I make these I will take a picture--they were gobbled up too quickly this time! This is the easiest recipe. Pepperidge Farm pastry already comes in square sheets, so all you have to do is quarter them with a pizza cutter. Probably the most time-consuming bit is peeling and slicing the apples. Next time I will only use 3 apples and reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup, because we had leftovers--although I'm not complaining, they were delish. You can use apple pie filling if you want, but the crispiness of the sauteed fruit can only come from fresh apples. I cooked my apples a little longer and shortened the baking time since they were browned after 20 minutes. I crimped the edges with a fork when I closed them up--don't worry if a little sauce spills out. (Feel free to add another teaspoon or two of cornstarch/water if your sauce is not thick enough.) They looked like they were store bought but tasted better.

A perfect filling for apple turnovers! I used my own pastry crust, doubled the cinnamon, added a bit of allspice and sprinkled with Demerara sugar crystals rather than glaze. Yummy right out of the oven with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

I made these the other day and froze them.  We took two out yesterday morning, popped them in the oven, and enjoyed them (warm!) for breakfast.  They were delicious.  I love the flaky crust, and the filling was excellent.  Tasted store bought.  I'm looking forward to being able to eat them fresh all winter long.

Amazingly good and so easy to make! Make sure to keep the pastry crust cold so that it doesn't fall apart!

Made these and had great results. Like others, I used apple pie spice, and lined the baking sheet--a must! I had some extra apple filling left--must have used larger apples or something.  A friend couldn't believe they were homemade. I plan on trying this out tonight with peach pie filling, and I'm sure they'll turn out just great! (and then maybe cherry pie filling, etc.--will be even quicker to make!)

Excellent. Skipped the lemon water bath for the apples, skipped the glaze. Cooked the apples longer than 2 mins - this worked well. Used pepperidge farm pastry sheets - these are amazing. Came out really well - whole family inhaled them. Will make again for sure. Easy and enjoyable.

Helpful tips:

Cut the apples into much smaller pieces--faster cooking on the stove, faster, more even cooking in the oven, much easier to fill pastry and easier to eat. You will thank me! Note, you must cook apples much longer than a few minutes--at least 10 minutes prior to adding brown sugar.   Egg wash is a must!  Also, don't really need all the brown sugar, 1/2 or 3/4 is more than enough. Sprinkle some granulated on the egg wash if you want more sweetness. Also don't need glaze--sweet enough. Line the baking sheet with parchment paper for no pan clean up!

Very good and very easy! I've never made pies or turnovers before, so I was delighted that this turned out well. I followed the other reviewers' suggestions and doubled the amount of cinnamon. Instead of using the glaze, I combined powdered sugar and cinnamon and dusted it over the turnovers. This would be a nice brunch item.

I am making these for the second time in two weeks.  They are delicious and easy.  My husband can't get enough of them.  They would be even easier with the use of canned pie filling.

This recipe is wonderful. Every time I make these, I get compliments. I do skip the lemon juice and water step and last time I made them, I cut the puff pastry into 18 squares and made as many smaller turnovers. It is more like a manageable serving size to me. I will be making these for years to come.

Fabulous recipe if you want to look like an incredible cook.  No one could believe I made these.  I did change a couple of things though.  

First, I diced the apples and used about 2/3 cups sugar instead of a whole cup.  I increased the cornstarch and water by 1/2 and doubled the cinnamon.  I used the Pepperidge Farms frozen pastry sheets and cut each sheet into 6 rectangles instead of 4 squares.  Then I stretched the dough a bit to make the rectangles square.  I brushed beaten egg on the tops and sprinkled with sugar.  Because of thinning out the dough a little, I reduced the cooking time by 1/2 and cooked for 12-13 minutes.  

I have also cut the sheets into 16 squares as well and the turnovers are smaller but equally, if not more, impressive-looking.

This recipe is soooo easy to work with. The only thing I can complain about is the time it takes to chop up the apples but the end result is worth it =P The first time I made these I didn't chop up the apples small enough so I had trouble fitting them inside the pastries without them spilling over. Make sure you chop them up to no more than 1/2 inch cubes. My sauce wasn't as runny and smooth the second time I made these so I had to add a bit more water to get the right consistency. Make sure to add your ingredients to the saucepan quickly so the sauce won't dry out. Another tip is to make sure you use the pepperidge farm brand for easy to handle pastry sheets. They come precut in squares and are thicker and larger than other puff pastry brands so you get a more puffy layered turnover. Basically once you get the sauce done, filling the dough with it becomes a breeze. To make really nice streaks for the icing, don't make the icing too thin otherwise it will just run off the pastry and the color will be almost transparent. The opposite is also true, don't make it too thick or you'll just get big globs of unattractive icing all over. If done well, these can look even better than the ones at the bakeries! (I know because I looked ^_~ ). After making this a third time, I did away with the step of soaking the apples in the lemon juice. The apples pretty much goes straight into the skillet after chopping so soaking isn't necessary.

OMG what a hot mess!  Could not fill nearly enough of the apples to use them up, plus they are WAAAAY too runny to even be contained in the pastry.  Don't know what everyone is raving about!  Stick to a cobbler, with puff pastry top, a pie, or a crumble.

Don't make the same mistakes I did! First, be sure to thaw the puff pastry for just 20 minutes, then cut them into the 8 squares- and make sure to place the ones you arent working with in the freezer as you work to put the mixture in each square. The puff pastry does 'melt' just as other people have rated. Also, cut your apples into small squares, not into slices. Otherwise, the apples won't stay put in the square. Use much less sugar, at least 1/2 less. Use light brown sugar, not dark brown sugar (recipe did not specify). Lastly, spray nonstick cooking spray before baking. The recipe did not specify and I figured it didn't need it, and boy was i wrong!

WOW.  My family thinks this is the best thing since ...well...EVER!  I have extra filling after making them and put about 1/4 C in a 1/2 cup of Krusteaz Pancake Mix then add water to get the pancake batter consistency.  Fry just like pancakes except turn the burner down a bit.  And Voila! Apple Fritter Pancakes!  YUMMY Surprise this morning.  Thanks

These turned out great. I would give it 5 Stars, except I would recommend cutting the apples into small, bite size pieces so they fit into the puff pastry better. Also, there was a lot of juice, so I think you can cut back on the sugar and butter by about half, and even just use 3 large apples instead of 4. I will definitely make these again. My friends and family loved them.

So easy and delicious.  I did make some alterations.  I didn't soak the apples in the lemon water but instead used lemon juice and zest.  I also added some salt and vanilla to the apples.  I used three large red delicious and I still had leftovers.  Remember to let the filling cool or it will melt the pastry.  I also used a puff pastry recipe from this site rather than store bought.  Everyone raved!  Now I have tons of requests to make this.

Great recipe! Following the advice of others, here are the changes to the original recipe
1. Used only 2 good-size apples
2.Chopped apples in smaller pieces.
3. Reduced brown sugar to half cup, and added a sprinkle of freshly grated nutmeg.
4. Cooked apples for about 10 minutes.
5. Let apple mixture cool, before making the turnovers
6.Do not worry about making perfect squares, triangles, or if edges do not seal completely.
7. Brush with egg wash (one egg+1 tablespoon water- beat until well mixed.
7. Line baking sheet with non-stick aluminum paper.
8. Baked for 20 minutes.

OMG! AMAZING and SO EASY!!!  As suggested by others, I doubled the cinnamon and didn't bother with the lemon/water bath.  I put everything together in the pan and slowly added the brown sugar til I felt it tasted right.  I did use an egg wash and baked it for 20 minutes.  Fricking amazing! Hubby's on his way back from a meeting and I just called and told him to make a detour home cause he NEEDS to taste this before going back to work! Hahaha! Oh, I didn't make the glaze, just sprinkled some sugar on top before baking.

This recipe came out just like the ones in the restaurant.  The only thing I might do different next time is to use a bit of a sweeter apple.  Also I use another tsp of water and another tsp of cornstarch mixed together and run it along the edge of the turnover dough with my finger to seal it closed.

Unbelievable!  We just came back from apple picking and my son asked me to make apple turnovers.  I had never worked with puff pastry so I was a little nervous.  It was so easy!  I did cut back on the brown sugar as many suggested.  I used 3/4 cup.  I also did an egg wash which gave the turnovers a nice color.  The glaze is a must and so yummy.  Make sure it is thick enough before using it.  At first my glaze was a little to thin.  I made one batch for home and then I made mini turnovers for work.  Everyone thought I bought them.  Not sure if they believed me.  I froze a couple.  Not sure how they will bake but wanted to try.  These are delicious and so easy to make!  I can't wait to make them again.

These turnovers were perfect. I skipped the lemon water bath and added a little vanilla to the filling. Next time I'll chop the apples into smaller pieces so they'll fit better inside the pastry. For a shiny, professional look, definitely brush with an egg wash before baking and cool completely before drizzling the glaze.

we made these as individuals and froze them on a cookie sheet--now whenever we're craving something sweet, we toss these in the oven.  A great use for all of those end of summer apples...hard to screw it up!

DEFINITELY A KEEPER!  Easy and looks like it came from the bakery.  Small cube apples vs slicing them.  Omit soaking in lemon water.  Make sure they are cooled before filling in pastry.  I tried smaller ones and folded them to look like rectangle vs triangle shape and also tried the bigger piece making it into a triangle.  Both are great, husband prefers larger pieces.  With the smaller ones I used rolling pin to to make a little larger to hold filling.  I omitted glaze and put egg wash on each piece and sprinkled with sugar.  Basically, all the suggestions of former reviews.  Sure helped.

Ok, when I made the apples I was like OMG these taste awesome.  Then I stuffed the pastry squares and baked.  Waited until they were warm and ate one and then I was like Ewww.  My apples taste sour.  Then I was up until 2:30am doing work and got hungry so I grabbed a turnover and then I was like OMG again.  For some reason the apples have to cool completely or they have this sour taste.  Is that normal.  Anyways, now they are awesome.  I love the ones I sprinkled some sugar on top before baking.  Will make again but this time will sprinkle sugar over the whole turnover and not just the top.  BTW I used only 3 apples and 3/4 brown sugar and it was plenty for one box of puff pastry.  I actually have a little left in fridge for later.  Thanks...

Quick, easy and tasty!  I made these with refrig pie crust I had leftover from Christmas and the only change I made was to double the cinnamon - because I always do in pie!  I didn't ice, just ate as is.  Is now in my Recipe box and next I will try using the new brown sugar Splenda - will let you all know the result.

These will get 4 stars for now but they have potential.  I may have done something wrong but I had two problems with these.  The sauce was definitely not thick enough and the turnovers exploded filling during cooking.  The taste is there though!  The filling tastes great but I need to work on the consistency of the sauce and execution of the turnover itself.  I would definitely recommend lining your pan with parchment in case the filling comes out of the pastry.  Next time I make these I will cook them at 375 because at 400 they came out crispier than I prefer.  I have made another version of these (but made with jam) and they bake at 375 for 20-25 minutes and I liked the pastry better at that temperature, it was still browned on top but the dough was still soft.  I will make these again but with adjustments on cooking temperature and I will look for suggestions of other reviewers on thickening the sauce.  I also didn't bother soaking the apples in water and lemon and they turned out just fine.

These were so good! Best right out of the oven with whipped cream. When I was cooking I went to grab the cornstarch and it wasn't their! So I had to use flour instead and it worked perfectly. Instead of putting icing on the turnovers I drizzled the leftover sauce from the apples.

These are really good!  My filling leaked a bit while baking, but that is probably just my fault for not sealing them.. maybe use egg instead of water.  They baked up crispy and brown.  The glaze makes it!

These are AMAZING!  My sister and I had never made apple filling before so we were anticipating a learning curve, but these were so easy to make and they were delicious.  If you want to make this recipe even easier, skip the puff pasty sheets and instead by Pepperidge Farm puff pastry shells.  You can just place them in the oven directly from the freezer and they are ready in 25 minutes.  You pop out the centers, fill the center with the apple filing, and skip the glaze.  Even faster and just as yummy.  Happy eating!

Oh, my goodness!  My husband just finished off 3 of these and said they were better than those from the stores.  They really weren't difficult to make at all!  They tasted wonderful, too!  It looked beautiful.  I will definitely be making this again.  Probably with the apple filling prepared the night before.  And remember Pepperridge Farms puff pastries recommend 40 min of thawing prior to use (whoops!)  Things for next time: 1.) make 2/3 of the filling (night before).  2.) use remaining filling for topping.  3.) use egg wash.  4.) Omit drizzle and sprinkle coarse sugar over top.

Delicious turnovers.  I made these for dessert and they were great. Didn't take too long to prepare but could probably be prepared ahead of time and baked when you're ready.  I added about a shot of spiced rum (be sure to pull pan off heat to burn off the alcohol) to the apples at the same time as the cinnamon, which enhanced the flavor plenty. Make sure to cool the apples before adding to pastry, I forgot that step and resulted in messy turnovers.  Also lined the cookie sheet with parchment paper for easy cleanup.  Will make again!

These are easy to make, deliceous, and fun! I traded the apples for strawberries, the brown sugar for normal sugar, and the ground cinnamon for hot chocolate powder! They were so good that I just have to make them again!  

                 P.s. If you use regular sugar and 3 table spoons of milk in the glaze it is so much better.
P.p.s it is more fun if you leave the glaze on the side ( and color it) and dip the turnover in, and you can replace the puff pastry sheets with pie crust.

My main difficulty with these was that the apples made a ton of very liquid sauce that even extra cornstarch and some flour couldn't thicken. I decided to leave most of it out of the turnovers (it would have been quite a mess) and reduce it more over the stove to make a syrup for pancakes. Delicious! Also sort of annoying.

The reason I am giving this a three is because of the filling. The dough was hard to work with and they burned because the filling didn't stay inside even though I had sealed the ends. Might try again but I don't know.

I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out beautifully! The end result tasted much more complex than the simple ingredients and steps to the recipe. The filling yields more than the pastry sheets could hold and next time around I might reduce the filling a bit and only use three apples to avoid the waste.

This was the hit dessert at my Christmas gathering this year.  It seemed like a lot of effort to make them, but then, I had just eaten a huge Christmas meal, and had been baking all day the day before... so maybe I was a little bit biased.  The smiles, "mm"s and requests for seconds and thirds definitely made up for the effort in the end.  I didn't make the glaze, but I put a light egg wash on the top of the turnovers and sprinkled them with turbinado sugar before baking.  Delicious.  I don't know if I'd do the egg wash again -- maybe just a little bit of water to get the sugar to stick?  I would make these again, but not on Christmas day after dinner.

These are terrible if you eat them warm.  The puff pastry is hard and flaky.  The recipe wasn't kidding about making sure they're cooled completely.  I thought these were terrible fresh, but wonderful the next morning.

I made this EXACTLY how it was written. No changes whatsoever. I am really good at baking but this was a mess. There is far too much liquid even after the  sauce thickens. I baked them for 15  mins and they nearly burnt. Never ever again. Save yourself the time, money, and aggravation and find a better recipe. I never write a review but I have never had this much trouble. Dont soak the apples and dont use as much butter. There is too much liquid when you do this. Apples already contain water. No need to drench them.

Excellent! especially for fall! I admit that I too skipped the lemon bath, if you plan out all the things you need before hand and have all ready .. then peel and slice your apples, (or for those who really don't have the time to peel, core and slice - use canned! - without the syrup/liquid - reserve for a topping on ice cream with your turnovers) they don't have enough time to get that brown color. This recipe is really marvelous, but like probably a lot of us, I didnt have puff pastry in the house.. and I usually don't.  It's a bit expensive too. I'll buy it only for major holidays but mostly I make it myself- there is a really good substitute - try Puff Pastry by Phaylock here on this site, it's soooo easy and way less expensive or try using the canned crescent rolls, roll out two together into a square joining them and then after filling fold from two corners into triangle. you can then decorate your edge... i do use a fork sometimes, but you can try other things to get a decorative edge, the flat of a knife or a bottle cap... This is a wonderful recipe and I'll make this again and again I'm sure!

Crazy easy to make, and you end up looking like a baking genius. (Thank you, puff pastry!) I use a variety of apples, and I don't bother with the lemon bath because I'm cooking the apples down and they turn beautifully brown anyway. Next time, I'm going to experiment with cutting the puff pastry smaller to make fun-size pastry bites for a cider-pressing party.

Tasted ok, but made a mess in my oven.  Wasn't able to close the turnovers properly because the apple mixture was too liquid and running all over the place.  In the end I had a big mess of apples and caramel with pastry stuck to my baking sheet, but taste good anyways.  I would suggest cutting the apples into very small pieces and making a thick caramel before adding the apples to the pan so the mixture might run less and actually stay inside the puff pastry while cooking.

I made these for my family and friends and they LOVED these!! I put caramel topping on them.  Next time will try with only the sugar topping.  they are so easy to make, although a bit messy.
Thanks for this recipe.

Delicious. Read the reviews. Added double the cinnamon AND cut half the sugar, might even cut more next time. it's not necessary. Everyone was right, simple to make and really tasty results!

I loved this and it was easy. I used Gala apples instead of Granny smith. Came out great.

Tasty and fairly easy to make.  I feel that the cost is a little too much for these.  $2 for 4 turnovers for just the puff pastry.  2 apples $1.45.  Ummm.. the sugar and other ingredients.  I think you can buy frozen turnovers with the same results for a bit cheaper.

Every time I make these, people rave and ask for the recipe. My husband LOVES them. I use less apples and skip the water/lemon juice step. I always need more puff pastry than they say (2 boxes instead).

These are delicious and very easy!  I used a mix of apples I had - I think a couple honeycrisp and a couple Rome, which are sweet, so I cut back on the brown sugar to about 3/4 cup.  I made them half size, so 16 total.  I ended up with a lot of filling left over, but I'm thinking it would be an excellent topping for pancakes!  I didn't use the glaze - instead did an egg wash (1 egg beaten with about a Tbsp water) and sprinkled raw sugar on top before baking.  Maybe it was because mine were smaller, or maybe my oven was hot, but it took 18 - 19 minutes for mine.  My guests were extremely impressed and they didn't last long.  These will definitely be a must for my holiday breakfasts!!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Super yummy!!! I used 2 large apples and chopped them up tiny so the filling fit into the turnover better and still had some filling left over. Going to put it on my french toast tomorrow!

I LOVE these! I don't like to have too many sweets in the house, but we will be making these again! I used tender-crisp apples and the dish is a hit! Also, a bit too much filling, oh darn! I have to go get some more puff pasty! lol Love this!!!

I made this last night and it was amazing! My husband loved it. Although I used Granny Smith apples I will substitute 2 Granny Smiths for 2 sweeter apples next time. They were a little tart for my 7 year old. I didn't use the glaze but sprinkled a mixture of powdered sugar and cinnamon instead. They were a hit! I will be using this recipe from now on!

I think this was a good recipe but I also think that 1 cup of brown sugar was a little much.  Next time I make these, I will cut back the sugar and add more cinnamon and maybe a pinch of nutmeg.

As others have said, too much filling. I don't know what to do with it, other than make more with the extra crust I got (but didn't thaw) lol I definitely suggest reducing it to 3 apples, and finely chopping up the apples if you like a little less crunch and chew with your pastry.

Super easy to make. I had left over of the apple filling which I incorporated into a apple crisp I also made. If you don't want to make the glaze, you could simply dust with powdered sugar.

These were ok. I thought the apple filling could have cooked for longer and was too sweet for my taste, even with the tart Granny Smiths. They were, however, super easy to whip up after a weeknight supper (but a bit messy to fill). Next time I'd cut back the sugar and cook the apples longer before adding the sugar.

This is really good! This recipe is a keeper; I would eat it again. The only thing I didn't like was the parts without the apple, like the edges; the dough wrap was a little plain, but other than that, it was great!

Oh so yummy! I didn't seal the edges well and a lot of filling spilled out so I'll remember that for next time. If you can mange not to eat them all (we're diabetic so only one each), they keep well overnight too! I save one for my Dad the next day and took one to work - delicious!

Love this recipe. It's relatively easy. I did not find it necessary to put the apples in lemon water they were fine. I always use Granny Smith and Golden Delicious Apples for my pies and did the same here. I added nutmeg too because I love it.  I doubled the recipe and glazed half and used raw sugar to coat the other half. Everyone ate them up. Thanks!

Excellent recipe. I used the egg wash and skipped the glaze. Looks like bakery bought and tastes even better. I had enough apple mixture to make 12 pastries and used a box and a half of the pepperidge farm pastry sheets.

Great filling, I doubled the spices and added walnuts, also sprinkled raw sugar on the top after applying egg wash. One word of warning, your filling should be cooled considerably prior to adding it to the puff pastry or else the pastry gets too soft to work with.

These are delicious, but make sure you read over the reviews for suggestions on improvement. My first batch burned on the bottom in 15 minutes and I followed the recipe exactly. The second batch was perfect: I turned the oven down to 350 and used parchment paper. I also brushed the tops with an egg wash and sprinkled sugar over them. I also agree that the apple mixture can get too fluidy, so feel free to drain as necessary. Other than that, these are fantastic!

These are awesome!!! I pretty much followed  the recipe, except I did not use the glaze. I just sprinkled baked turnovers with a little powdered sugar and cinnamon. Next time I plan to try and fit more apples in the pastry somehow, but cutting the apples or making the squares differently. But overall, easy, aromatic, and awesome!!!!! Will most definitely make these again!

soggy - and not a lot of flavor - but I made it with sprite, so my review isn't really fair.

Very Good! My modifications: Added raisins to the apple mixture. Didn't bother with the lemon bath for apples. Brushed turnovers with egg was before baking, and cut three vent slits in each. Baked for only 20-21 minutes. Did not glaze. They were sweet enough without! Will make again for sure. 
Might try to cut apples into smaller pieces and make smaller sized turnovers. Had to cut them in half b/c they were so big.

Delicious and so easy to make.  I used 4 fujji apples, 3/4 c unpacked brown sugar (and still it was a bit too sweet).  To make smaller turnovers, I cut each sheet into 9 and diced the apples into smaller pieces.  Also use a fork to press the edges, brush with egg wash and cut 3 vents in the top before baking.

I just made these turnovers tonight and they were wonderful!  The flavor of the apple filling was just perfect.  I did add nutmeg and used pie crust instead of puff pastry.  The filling would lend itself to so many different uses.  Thanks for a superb recipe.

I was truly amazed at how wonderful these were! I had never worked with puff pastry before, so I was a little nervous, but my guests couldn't believe the turnovers weren't store-bought. I'd also like to add that they are very EASY to make too. Thank you for this receipe -- it is a new Christmas breakfast tradition at our house.

These turnovers are incredible.  The crust was flaky & the filling was very flavorful.  I'll be making these on a weekly basis - if not more often.  Thanks for the recipe!

They turned out wonderful! I also added a handful of sultanas to the apple filling - delicious! I wound definitely recommend making them with the glaze - it just elevates the recipe to the new level!

Yes, definately use an egg wash & I would only bake them about 17 mins. Took mine out at 20 & they were pretty brown on top.

Before placing in the oven, I gave the turnover an egg wash and sprinkled sugar on the egg wash. This gives the turnover a nice sweet crispy texture.

As an alternative for step 2, I mix small pieces of apple (diced) with raisins, brown sugar, cinnamon and a little bit of apple spices. This mixture is not precooked in a skillet but directly placed on the puff pastry sheet. I lower the temperature to 350 degrees and keep the turnovers in oven 10 minutes longer (35 minutes).

The family loves these but I'm not a huge fan of desserts that feature apples.  My only suggestion is to bake these on parchment paper or a silpat.

Yum, you really don't need to soak the apples in lemon and water. I made with trader joes puff pastry. I made them in the morning before taking my kids to school, so you know it's quick and easy.

Wow, delicious! I used Royal Gala apples, cut the brown sugar down to 1/2 cup packed (I don't like things too sugary sweet) and added 1 T honey. I used a quality vanilla that has vanilla seeds in it and that really enhanced the glaze. Highly recommend. I had to hide them to stop my Hub from eating them all.

I don't eat these but my husband and uncle loved them.  I too doubled the cinnamon like the other reviews and otherwise followed the recipe.  They loved loved loved them.  2 tips, I found that about 1/4 cup was about the right amount of filling for each turnover and 1 tbsp milk is a little too much for the glaze, it will be too thin so start with a little less.

Fairly easy and very delicious. I brought these to work, made recipe as-is, and everyone said they were the best turnovers they've ever had. Even better than the bakery. Both times I made these my sauce never did thicken up but it didn't really seem to matter. I did not do any of the cinnamon and sugar on top and I did not brush with egg wash. I think they are perfectly fine as written.

Good use of extra apples I had. They turned out great not over cooked with a little crunch.  However I only needed 3 there was a lot of left over filling.  They must be eggwashed, and I cut a small vent in the top.  The use of shortening is very noticeable in the store bought puff dough, if I have time I will make my own next time.

These are good but next time I make them I will make half the apple mixture. I thought there was too much apple mixture in each turnover (even though I love the apple mixture, its delicious) it made for a heavy turnover. The bottoms did not puff up nice like the tops and you really need about a good 1/2" around the sides for sealing. I did slit the tops to allow the moisture to escape too. These were good but not as good as a pastry shop.

Wonderful... a few tips: #1: when working with the dough, make sure its not too warm, just room temp or slightly colder to start out with, otherwise it will be too sticky to unfold and you will end up rolling out anyways. #2: Do not overstuff. #3: Watch them the last few minutes of baking. You want golden brown, not brown. Its easy to burn the tops of these.

Absolutely delish! Was easy to make and tasted yum. I was a bit confused with the measurements of ingredients though. Using the converting tool from US to metric didn't match. Seemed like a lot of sugar too!

I made this recipe "by the book," and the turnovers turned out perfectly. I accidentally over-filled my first couple and they looked a sticky mess, but came out of the oven looking great. I did have over a cup of filling left over... To avoid this, I will either (1) use smaller apples or (2) buy another package of pastry sheets. Bon appetite!

I've made these twice now, and both times turned out perfectly and were a big hit at both parties. If you double the batch, take the 2nd set of pastry dough out 10-15 min after your first set so it doesn't get too gummy and challenging to work with.

I made some Greek feta/spinach/ham/onion/egg "triangles" which used 2 sheets of puff pastry (I use Pepperidge Farm" frozen.  But  had enough Greek filling left over to make another sheet's worth of those, so I only used two apples (red delicious) which I thought would make the 9 extra from the other puff sheet.  And because they are so little I wanted each one to pack a punch to match the intensity of the savory ones, so I diced the apples fine, skipped the soaking step, straight to the saute pan with a tablespoon of butter, cooked them awhile, added a teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg, and I didn't have brown sugars so I used 1/2 cup regular white, cooked again, then added cornstarch and water, cooked a little longer, added a little more water because it needed it, then off the range a little vanilla and another tablespoon of butter and stirred, refrigerated it over night.  The morning found me with enough Greek filling and apple filling to make 18 smart triangles.  Both Savory and Sweet.  Nothing could be finer on a cold winter day.  Lunch and/or dinner in a little packet.  This is such a great little recipe to start with, and tweaking is a lot of fun, you just can't go wrong either way.

These taste great, just like the ones in one of my local bakeries.  I'm giving it 5 stars because the only thing i did differently was to add a little vanilla after the filling was done and dusted them with icing sugar to finish.  Oh and I did only have 3 apples but they were big enough to not matter

Very easy to make. Have used Solo pie filling also. Made the apple mixture and it turned out great. Had a lot of apple mixture left over. Didn't use the glaze as I felt it was sweet enough.  I made these again but this time I used half the brown sugar. Taste the apples before you add the sugar as mine were pretty sweet to start with so I cut back on the sugar. I also used Granny Smith and a couple other types of apples. I also cut the apples in small pieces this time. If the apples are quite large you might want to rethink 4 apples. All in all, they were thick enough. I had no problems. I skipped the lemon water this time. No need to use it as the apples cook in the butter. Less liquid that way too.

These were pretty good.  I skipped the lemon water bath, and put them in the skillet. I also added more cinnamon and sprinkleds them with a bit of white sugar as well.  They were too tart for me, so next time I will be using a sweeter apple than the granny smith.  I only made them with the granny smith because they are my hubby's fave apple.  Also, I had a blonde moment and cut the dough in triangles on my first batch! I just folded them into little square and they turned out just fine! ;)

These are excellent! So easy to make and they taste great. I didn't do the water bath for the apples and I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cups. That was more than enough. So delicious! I'll definitely be making these again!

This was so easy and simple to make, resulting  with a bakery-like appearance  and a delicious homemade taste! I didn't  have time to make the apple filling, so I used cherry pie filling. Super good! I will definitely make them again!! :)

I just made these for the first time - in fact I'm waiting for them to cool right now, (and for the smoke to clear out of my house), so I can put the glaze on... The reason I am giving it 3 stars is that I almost burned my house down overfilling the pastry shells, lol, (I had no idea how much to put in each square); it was super messy, and I had a ton of filling left over. Hope it tastes great though. Maybe practice makes perfect!

My 17 year old daughter and I made these together and they were easy, smelled wonderful and were very yummy.  I did roll out the pastry dough a little so I could fit more apple filling into each one.  Even a quarter of a cup was too much to get it to seal.  We applied an egg wash to the top and could not have been easier.

A keeper!   I used the lemon and water to soak the apples, used a little less brown sugar, and I used flour to thicken instead of corn starch.  Puff pastry sheets were easy to use and very tasty.

This recipe is THE best I have found that has it all. Not many ingredients, simple, fast and delicious! I followed the recipe first just as written and they were fabulous. The next time I made them I added some raisins (that I had steamed in water till they were plump) in with the apples. I also added about 1/2 teaspoon of Apple Pie Spice in with the brown sugar and cinnamon. They turned out just absolutely wonderful!

Mmmm... tried this recipe and it was so easy and so good! Taste like they were store bought. I made it easy on my self and used the can apple filling and it tasted like I used fresh apples. I did put some more spices in it but I really didn't have to.

Delicious!  We ate them without the glaze and they were awesome!  Messy to fill, not knowing how much to put in each puff pastry square.  Once I figure out exactly how much is not too much or too little, I'll be a happy camper!  Thanks for the easy and tasty recipe!!!!  Oh, and also, there was quite a bit of filling left over.  I stuck it in tupperware and plan to pour it piping hot over vanilla icecream and graham cracker pieces.  MMMMMM!

Oh my goodness!  These are heavenly.  I am so glad that I listened to some of the other reviewers and lined my pan with parchment paper.  When I took them out of the oven I thought for sure I had ruined them because some of the brown sugar mixture had came out the sides but after I put them on a new pan they looked perfect.  The egg wash is a must.  They were a beautiful light golden brown color.  I did use the glaze but they could be eaten without it and still be amazing.  My husband said "These could have been bought from a store."  Delicious!

These were awesome! I had some left over apple filling but I didn't hate it because it was so versatile (crepes, cake topping, even by itself). They turned out a lot bigger then I expected but I just cut them in half. My family isn't big on dessert and they loved it and I brought them to school and had nothing left. I think that speaks for itself!

Just made these and they turned out great.  Have to say that I've never worked with puff pastry before and should have read some of the suggestions in other reviews first.  Got very frustrated and made a big mess trying to fill and seal.  Thought they'd never turn out, but even though they went in the oven a gooey looking mess they still were delicious (didn't use the glaze, just served warm with ice cream)! Next time will try to drain and reserve some of the juice first as other reviewers have mentioned.

i skipped the lemon juice step as well, also only put in 2/3 cup brown sugar & 1/4 tsp cinnamon rather than 1 tsp, also added a sprinkling of nutmeg & a dash of vanilla. Instead of the glaze i sprinkled powdered sugar on once they were out of the oven. A very good desert! My husband loved them!

Great recipe. I added some extra cinnamon,  1/2 cup of raisins, and a tbl spoon of rum. Halved the sugar, used egg wash, and did not do the glaze. Fast and easy, which is a key when you have an infant at home. Will definitely do again.

I made these for work. They were delicious, especially hot out of the oven (I had to sample one of course!). I had several compliments and they were gone before the day was over. I did follow a review and cut the brown sugar to 3/4 cup instead of 1 cup. Easy and delicious!

Perfect! To make a tighter seal, I used a finger to brush a little water on the edges before closing the pastry and pressing it together. I reduced the sugar down to about 1/3 of a cup and added around 2 Tbsp. of raisins to the apples while they were cooking in the skillet. These are SO delicious with or without the glaze!

Great recipe thanks!!! I do agree that it is a bit too sweet so next time I will combat with some lemon juice or just reduce the sugar. I made it the second time in bite sized portions and it was a perfect sweet treat. The glaze makes LOTS so you could divide in half and have more than enough. I used Tenderflake puff pastry and it turned out great! Thanks!!

Unbelievably easy and totally gorgeous!  They tasted as wonderful as they looked.  If they hadn't seen me make them I'm sure they would have thought they were store bought.  Probably just a newbie mistake here but don't let the puff pastry dough get too warm before you unfold it!

I'm not quite sure I should be reviewing this recipe seeing how I cheated and used apple pie filling :-)  However, before this recipe I wasn't even sure what type of dough to use, so I'll rate it based on that....these came out wonderfully.  They look like they came from the bakery and tasted delicious!

These were delicious!!  I did add a little nutmeg to the mixture.  One things I will do next time is make the filling the day before so it cools completely before filling the pastries.  I had a hard time sealing them because the warm filling made the pastry dough too soft and hard to work with.  Also you can use 2 boxes of puffed pastry, there is plenty of filling, I had a lot leftover.

Used two medium sized apples, perfect amount for 8 turnovers! The sauce didn't really thicken, so next time I think Id use a bit less brown sugar..they were delicious though!

Fantastic!  I made these alterations per other reviews - Used an egg white wash, and topped with sugar before baking - lowered the oven temp to 375.  Next time I will use less sugar - too much "sauce", but it was great to top the accompanying vanilla ice cream!

I was wowed by these delights. I had never used puff pastry before but it was very easy to work with and lived up to the "puff" factor. The filling was heavenly with the apple flavour tasting so fresh. A nice contrast using tart granny smith apples sauteed in a sweet sauce. I brushed the top with a beaten egg and sprinkled turbinado sugar rather than a glaze. These get top marks for appearance. You will be proud of yourself when these come out of your oven. Thanks so much for the recipe.

These are SO good!  I've never made turnovers before and was pleased with the results.  The icing just makes this recipe!  The only change I will make next time is try baking them at 350.  They seemed to spill over and burn at 400. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

The filling is very good, very easy to make.  I had a problems with the pastry.  I use Peperideg Farm puff pastry and it burned and stuck to the pan.  I had planned to take them to a church function, and they looked so bad that I couldn't.  I suppose that my oven runs hot, but I don't know why they stuck to the pan.

Very good - so simple to make. I used the rapid mix sweet dough from this site to make the pastry sheets. I am shape-impaired I think, can't make a triangle turnover to save my life. Then figured out to just make rectangle and fold over. :) I also moistened tops with butter and sprinkled sugar on the tops - only because I was out of confectioner's sugar. These DO taste store-bought - I love those, so this will be great, as they are way to expensive in the store to eat regularly. Thank you!

Superb!  I did cut the pastry into 8 squares rather than 4, which seemed too large.  I added maple flavoring rather than vanilla to the icing.

These are great!  I had some filling left over and my husband finished it off by the spoonful.  He loves this recipe!  Thanks.

I wish I would of made a double recipe.  My kids ate them up way too fast.  I did end up cutting them in half after they were baked to get two smaller sized pastries instead of the big size.  I tried to make them smaller to start but they were too hard to get enough apples in and seal.  I chopped my apples in smaller chunks so I didn't have to worry so much about the dough ripping.  They did leak, but didn't affect them any.  I did use the glaze but for me it was too much (sweet) and I prefer it without.  My kids didn't mind ;)  Overall 4 stars and a keeper quick dessert recipe.

Even though everyone says the filling is easy I took the really easy route and used canned cherry pie filling.  They were still really yummy.  They're even better than some bakery versions I've had.  My husband can't get enough of them!

Who needs to finish making the turnovers when the filling can stand on its own?!!  I may use the *filling* as a side dish instead -- it tastes just like the apples at Cracker Barrell. Yum!  My family liked the turnovers; I made a pie crust for them. However, I'll try a frozen pastry next time, as the recipe suggests, because I prefer a more flakey crust for turnovers.  Awesome recipe!

Super yummy and super easy!  I used ready made pie crust instead of puff pastry and apple pie spice instead of cinnamon.  I also doubled the amount of spice and poured milk over mine rather than messing with the glaze.  Next time I will probably use parchment paper...  the syrup does not clean off of pans easily after being baked at 400.

This were pretty easy to make, and made a delicious Breakfast treat, but it lacked the WOW factor.  I put a cinnamon sugar coating on the outside instead of the icing.  I might make this again, but I think I'll keep looking also.

Made this for a quick Sunday dinner desert. They came out fabulously light and flaky. My mom even took the left over caramel mixture in the pan!

Everyone in my family LOVED these!  Ever since I was a kid, one of my favorite desserts was Pepperidge Farm turnovers.  This recipe is just as good as the name brand.  Actually, better!  I used my friend's homegrown Gravenstein apples, which have superb flavor.  Plus, I followed another reviewer's suggestion and cut the sugar back to 3/4 cup.  Also, I didn't have cornstarch because I avoid products with GMO's (Just about all processed corn products are genetically engineered if they're not organic.) So I substituted arrowroot, which worked great. Didn't bother to make the glaze.  They're perfect just the way they are!  Can't wait to make more.  Thanks for this awesome recipe!

Very good recipe.  I made a couple of slight changes, including rolling out the dough an extra amount to help fit some of the apple, and by adding some vanilla and cinnamon to the icing.

Otherwise, very good recipe.  Due to issues with the brown sugar seeping out and burning during baking, I will double the cornstarch and use larger apple slides .

Didn’t use lemon juice, just added a couple of drops of vinegar ( doesn’t leave a taste).   
Made 8 delicious turnovers. 
I used the egg wash and sugar.
Will absolutely make again.

Delicious!! And pretty easy to make too. My husband loves them (and so do I!) Will definitely make again. I used honeycrisp apples as that’s what we picked last week at the orchard and it worked great.

Very good!  Two notes: 1) Make sure not of the apple mix spills out of the turnovers when spooning as that burns when cooked.  2) On the glaze, I'd recommend a half cup of powdered sugar as the whole cup took a lot more milk to even be able to drizzle and then I only used 1/3rd of the mixture.  Otherwise these are excellent.

I made these the easy way.  Simply thawed out the puff pastry as directed. After removing the paper between layers I placed it on a floured board, cut into three strips and then cut each strip into three squares.  I used a can of Comstock apples and placed about a tablespoon in each square (using more of the apples than the gelatin), wetted the edges with a little water before folding into triangles pressing down well to close, then crimped edges with a fork.  Placed the turnovers on a  parchment lined cookie sheet, then spread a little melted butter on each, finishing with a sprinkle of sugar and cinnamon.  I baked  these in a 400 degree oven for 20 minutes. Easy peasy and so good.

This was an easy to use recipe--I will use it again. I liked the tip for putting the apples in water/lemon juice. I reduced apples to 3 medium Cortlands (and reduced the sugar). Next time I will reduce the apples to 2 medium/large and see if that's a better amount. Also, I used frozen/boxed pastry. I wonder if rolling the pastry a small amount before filling it, might help with the proportions of apple to pastry.

These turnovers were pretty good. To make the recipe easier,  I skipped the lemon water and  just tried to get the prep done fast to avoid the Apple's oxidation. I also opted for a simple dusting of powdered sugar instead of the glaze.
Per personal preference,  I cut the sugar down and cooked the apples longer on the stove because I wanted the turnovers filling to be soft.

Before anyone gets all crazy, I only made one flavor alteration to this recipe. That was adding a pinch of nutmeg just because my family likes nutmeg with apples. That being said, just a few tips. 1. No need to water bath the apples unless you're cutting them way ahead of time. 2. The filling was a little runny. I added about 1/2 tablespoon extra cornstarch. No need to mix with water just add it straight to the mix. 3. I used pink lady apples because that's what we buy. There was a little filling left over, so you can probably get away with just 3 apples. 4. Always egg wash puff pastry. 5. Line your pan. 6. They didn't take 25 minutes to cook so keep an eye on them. Overall, pretty good recipe. Easy and delicious.

I gave up on the half triangles, and just made four squares then cut them diagonally.  I couldn't fill them enough with the filling, so we ended up topping them with the left over filling, then smothered them with ice cream or whipped cream.  They were ok, but nothing to brag about!

So I made this just as the recipe suggested, although the second batch I put into the oven I ended up added just over 1/2 tsp of nutmeg the the apples. Only to get a little more flavor. But honestly, it isn't necessary. It was my personal preference. 

Like others said, it makes a whole lot of apples. I'm going out tomorrow to buy another batch of puff pastry shells so that the apples I have cooked won't go to waste.

The apples did collect alot of juice, even after cooking. In turn, I was careful not to transfer all that liquid onto the pastry squares.

The one thing I wish I had done (hindsight) is use pastry paper to prevent so much leakage on my baking sheet. I made a mistake of scrubbing with a scour (sp?) pad and ended up scrubbing off the non-stick cover (YIKES!). Of course, all that happened because I allowed the turnovers to cool for awhile on the pan. The second batch I took immediately off the pan and let them cool onto a rack, just so I could rescue my pan and not let the fillings harden. Then immediately took my hot pan to the sink and washed it right off.

All in all, the recipe posted as is, is perfect to me. I may do some of the others recommendations such as adding the cornstarch to the brown sugar and see if it reduces the liquid any.

Easy-  yes, very.  The hardest part is peeling the apples and waiting for the puff pastry to defrost! 

Notes: 
- cook the apples longer so they burn off the liquid. That will solve the "it's too liquidy" issue some people have commented on.  Add a bit more cornstarch if needed. Take these measurements and times with a grain of salt; adjust as needed!
- Too many apples! I'd use about half next time.  
- This recipe makes 4 turnovers.

If reheating frozen batch, defrost before baking. The edges will bake faster than the center due to the frozen filling and pie will not be evenly brown.

Absolutely delicious,  a few changes: did not soak in lemon water, used Cortland apples, only used 1/2 cup brown sugar,  used 1 1/2  tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp all spice and used flour instead of cornstarch.  Cut apples into small pieces and cooked in the butter, sugar, flour  and spices till tender. Let cool completely before making turnovers. The flour helps to thicken juices. Did the egg wash followed by sugar crystals on top. Will definitely make again, have already been requested for the next dinner party. Thank you!

These were delicious but need some modification next time. Only 3 apples, and less of the sugar combo, or else it needs to be thicker. It was running everywhere and there was a lot left over. I dusted the parchment paper with powdered sugar to make it easier to handle the pastry. I brushed each folded turnover with an egg wash and sprinkled raw sugar on top before baking, and skipped the glaze. Yum! Great with vanilla ice cream!

These Apple Turnovers came out great! The only thing is that this apple filling did come out a bit watery for me - perhaps I misjudged on the amount of butter, but it was a quick fix with a little bit of flour. I've made these twice now: with and without the glaze, and definitely prefer to just coat them in egg wash and powdered sugar. I'm personally not a fan of the vanilla flavoring in the glaze.

Overall GREAT recipe!

This was very good, tastes as good as anything I've purchased and so easy to make.  I made the apples for another dish, then took the leftover and put it in the puff pastry for a great dessert.   You really only need about 1/4 cup of apple for each turnover, so you may not need as many apple depending on their size.  Easy to make just a couple or more or just bake as you need them.  I didn't find that you needed an egg wash, The glaze is the kicker.

Delicious, and looks and tastes professional.  My first time making a turnover.   I used 3/4 cup sugar, and cut the apples very small, as suggested.  I brushed with an egg white.  I used the icing glaze, and that makes it look professional.  But next time I might skip the white icing because I feel like it makes it too sweet.  Really good!  Even my husband is asking me how I made it.  Seems like he wants to make it himself??  Lol.  I will definitely make this again.

This was great! I did add everything all at once and an extra tablespoon of cornstarch just in case. Had 3/8 turnovers leak out even though I crimped both sides with a fork. No big deal. Easy and lived the flavor. Lastly, I added about 1 T of light corn syrup for the glaze since 1 T milk wasn't sufficient.

I have been making this recipe for awhile now, but am just getting around to reviewing it.  My family loves these but we find ourselves fighting over them and they never last a full day.  I have it down to a science now so they are really quite quick and easy.  I find that by actually cutting the apple mixture recipe in half, it is enough filling for 8 of the turnovers, but extra never hurts either!  The only thing I do extra is add a dash of nutmeg or sometimes allspice.  The eggwash before baking is a must for a beautiful golden color.  I skip the glaze also because I find they are sweet enough with the egg wash and a sprinkle of sugar on top. This recipe stays bookmarked for me and you must try it!!

Delicious filling however I would use only three apples next time plus cut the sugar accordingly. Mine looked messy since I didn't neatly trim the pastry once I rolled it ourt so I would do that next time too.  DEFINITELY use egg wash (1 egg beaten with small amount of water).  Brush this on before baking for a flaky crust finish.   Otherwise, delicious and a nice treat!

Super easy and came out just like the store bought (in a tube) variety except much tastier! One thing I recommend is to add half the sugar and taste before adding the rest---you might prefer it less sweet (my family did). Especially important if using less tart apples. Also, the recipe says to let the filling "cool slightly" before using. I only let it cool about 6 minutes and the heat of the filling caused the puff pastry dough to thin considerably and leak on the bottom of the first few turnovers I made. In future, I will let the filling cool quite a bit more before filling.  I noticed one reviewer complaining the filling was not thick enough. This can happen if the apple variety you use is juicier than normal or if you cook a bit too long(so more liquid produced). Not a problem, just add another tablespoon of cornstarch (mixed with a bit of water first, as the recipe says). I did this and it thickened just fine. Alternatively, you can just spoon up the apples with a slotted spoon and use the liquid for something else.

These came out great. The crust is very flaky.  I cut the recipe in half and just made 4.  I didn't bother with soaking the apples first and I also served them plain without the glaze.  They were still plenty sweet without the glaze.

Excellent, easy recipe. Made as written except for 3 minor changes.  Used 2 Gala and 2 granny Smith Apples, and it worked well.also added a teensy dash of almond extract. I also did an egg wash to seal and brush on top. This produced an extremely tasty, golden, crispy turnover. Definite keeper! Note on portions: go ahead and stuff all the filling into the turnovers and use fork tines to seal. It may seep out the edges during making, but had no effect on the final product.

I would give this more than 5 stars if I could. The only difference is I used 7 apples because mine were kind of small (off my tree). I also did not do the lemon juice water soak. But these were the best turnovers I ever ate. Better than any bakery I've ever had. Absolutely delicious. I also did not glaze, sweet enough on their own.

A great recipe!! I like to add the left over sauce from the pan to the glaze. It gives it a little more flavor.

Turned out well. Used pepperidge farm pastry which was perfect. Granny smith apples were a bit tart. Didn't care for the sugar drizzle. Others in my family liked it. Overall, very tasty and I'll make it again. Next time I'll cube the apples rather than slice them so they are easier to stuff in the pastry.

Made this tonight..., Was a HUGE Success... I did cook the apples a bit longer (4 minutes) and I let the cool almost completely before I added them to the pastry dough. Loved them... Thanks for the recipe.. it is definitely in my recipe box...

LOVED the filling.  However, I had trouble with it leaking out and burning on the bottom of the turnover.  I even used the fork trying to seal them better. Didn't really care for the glaze.  If I make them again, I'll just leave it off.  Definitely need the egg wash if you want them to look shiny like the picture.

Did not change anything and they turned out great.  I had a little difficulty with the dough.  I think the sheet I was not working with should have been refrigerated until I was ready to fill and form it.

When I made this recipie, I used pre-made pizza dough. It was so good, that I did not need the glaze! Also if you don't have corn starch, you can use flour ( that's what I had to do) but you have to be careful not to use to much, and it constantly has to be heated. If you have left over Apple mix place it In a greased casserole dish, sprinkle on oats, and some more brown sugar, and bake at 400 ferrinhight for about 25 min. Then enjoy with ice cream! :)

Skipped the lemon water and just put a tablespoon of the juice in the skillet (Apples have enough moisture without adding water).  Needed to use 2TBLS worth of cornstarch just to thicken a little.  Noticed the egg wash was missing...so brushed egg wash made of one egg and a TBL of water onto the raw turnovers. Looked and tasted great.

I use Fuji apples for all my baked goods. I peel, core and chop ahead, then  sprinkle lemon juice and cinnamon liberally, and mix. Place in a covered container in the fridge up to 3 days ahead. Cook apples as directed in butter, add brown sugar  and cinnamon mix.  Mix a tablesppon of cold water with Wondra flour, and str in to  apple mixture. Add a dallop of cream cheese, and stir until mixed well. Add a tablespoon of vanilla just before removing from stove, and stir.
Let mixture cool while preparing pastry.  I use Pepperidge Farm frozen pastry sheets and after rolling out, I make 6 turnovers per sheet. Using turnover molds, place  filling in center, brush  edges with egg wash, seal edges and brush  pastry with egg white wash. Sprinkle with sugar sprinkles and bake as directed. Once pastry has cooled, hubby likes to slice the pastry and fill each side with whipped cream.

The recipe sounded easy, but I was disappointed.  The syrup was too thin even though I added a little more cornstarch as others suggested.  For the second sheet of dough, I used mini pie pans, lined with a piece of dough, filled with the apples and sauce, then brought up four corners of the dough to make a packet.  That seemed to prevent seepage.  All that's missing is a scoop of vanilla ice crean!

I loved this recipe. I used 2 golden delicious and 2 granny smith apples. I also didn't use the water bath as I just put the apples cut into smaller pieces and put some lemon juice (1tbsp) on them as I let the butter melt. I was wanting to take a picture but they disappeared before I had a chance to. Already have everything I need to make another batch.

These apple turnovers came out so good. We could not stop eating them. I made a  few small changes by added 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of a full cup and they were plenty sweet with a nice tart finish. I also added more apples. Another suggestion is to buy a very good quality pastry dough made with butter instead of a commercial brand made with trans fats. This recipe is a keeper!

Great recipe!! I didn't have puff pastry so I rolled out Pillsbury Crescent rolls and put in a cupcake tin, so my turnover became a popover! I didn't add any water. The liquid from the apples was enough and I still had that sweet cinnamon sauce to drizzle over the popover. The next time I will definitely try the egg wash recommended by other reviewers. This recipe makes me feel like a real pastry chef!

This makes me look like a baker extraordinaire! It was so simple and easy and delicious. I had a little more apples than the recipe called for so my turn overs were a little over stuffed but they come out great all the while. I think this is a fool proof recipe.

These were great and so easy to make.  I diced the apples instead of slicing, but other than that, followed the recipe exactly.  My husband, who is notorious for not liking baked goods, ate two in one sitting.

I made these with my Mother last week and they were so good and easy to make. The only thing I did different was add a little extra cornstarch for a thicker filling. We were having a little trouble with runaway sauce. About a tablespoon extra of the cornstarch and it fixed all our troubles. I would absolutely recommend this recipe.

Very easy to make, and a crowd pleaser. Second time I made it, I reduced to 3 apples, as I tend to have leftovers with the original 4 apples. I've also cut the pastry puff into smaller squares to make more turnovers. Will definitely make again!

Pretty tasty. Was harder than I anticipated to make the dough into perfect squares to seal nicely. Didn't save particularly well either. Still tasted pretty good though.

I can't believe I actually made these!  I have zero experience using puff pastry, and that was evident...I made some triangles and some squares, but they taste delicious and look amazing!!!  Super easy and impressive!  I didn't have cornstarch so I used flour.  It worked fine.  Brushed with egg wash and sprinkled with sugar!  My anti-cooked apple hubby even likes them.

This was amazing and easy to make, the filling tasted just like the real filling you eat from professionals. Just make sure the puff pastry you use is sweet as mine was salty so it slightly affected the taste. I brushed the top of the pastry with milk and sprinkled it with brown sugar, made a nice finishing! YUMMY!

This was my compromise to my brother because I couldn't find the apple fritter recipe he wanted. What a hit! These are super easy to make and full of flavor.  Did not make any substitutions, other than instead of using the glaze I did an egg wash and sprinkled with sugar before baking. Will make these again!

came out amazing!  I used a bit too much butter, but then had extra carmel type sauce left over from the filling that we used as a dipping sauce for the turnovers.  yum!

These are FABULOUS tasting and EASY!! I made a glaze similar to what you would put on cinnamon rolls and drizzled it over the turnovers... SUPER YUMMY! I am looking forwarding to making peach ones this next summer!

Made these today and they were so yummy.  I didn't have brown sugar so i used some white sugar and a little it of molasses.  I also added some allspice.  They came out perfect.  I will be making them again.

A little too much sauce- will try more apples next time and stuff them really full....but will definitely make these again.  Skipped the icing and it wasn't missed.  These turnovers were way better the next day- soft and flaky rather than too crispy.

This is super delicious and super easy to make. Its sweet aroma filled my house with love. I made mine with organic ingredients and sprinkled it with raw sugar (and yummy frosting too, he he he) I added extra cinnamon and a little extra corn starch to thicken it up a bit. Enjoy...

Top notch, easy to make and very forgiving of any mistakes. I used Delicious Apples vice the Granny Smith, bigger apples means less to use in the recipe (I discovered). The icing in the recipe took two tablespoons of milk for my satisfaction, but thats just my taste. I only mention it to illustrate the flexibility of the recipe overall.   It's a keeper!

Wonderful recipe, I wish it could've made more but next time I'll have 2 packages of puff pastry.  I had a lot of extra filling and mostly just ate it right out of the bowl it was so delicious.  This filling could be used in so many ways and it was so easy

This was my first time using Puff pastry sheets and realized it is very important not to overfill the turnovers. I had quite a bit of the mix left over, but it worked out perfect because I served it on the side. I did have to add a bit of cornstarch to the mix

perfect and beautiful!!! i sliced the apples and then cut the slices horizontally to make them more into cubes.  i didnt need the glaze. i served with vanilla ice cream and it was plenty sweet. i also brushed the top with an egg yolk to brown it. my ONLY edit: in my oven i had to cook for 30 minutes.  so increase cooking time, but keep an eye on the pastries.

This is a great recipe!  I usually use Gala or Fuji apples and cut down on the sugar I add.

These are really good and much better than store bought turnovers.  I just thought they were a little messy to work with and I wish I had made the turnover right on the baking sheet from the start.  The filling tastes great but I think my apples turned out with more juice than I should have had...that was the messy part.  I added a bit more cornstarch and water (tiny bit) to make it a little bit thicker.  We liked the glaze on top too.  We would probably make these again.

These were a lot easier to make than I thought they would be...and they were really good!  I skipped the glaze and topped the egg white/sugar as suggested.  Would highly recommend :)

This is a wonderful dessert to serve for any dinner guests.  It looks and tastes like it came straight from a gourmet bakery.  It is absolutely wonderful served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!!  My daughter, who is a super picky eater gave me the thumbs up and ate 2! (never mind they are 500+ calorie each).  I wish I never looked at the calorie count!  The only change I made was that I added more milk to thin the icing.  I like mine to where I can drizzle over the turnovers and when I followed the recipe, it just turned out too thick.  Overall, it was a fun, delicious and super easy to make!  This recipe is definitely going into my 'favorites' file.

Amazing! I didn't have access to the amounts in this recipe when I was making, but I remembered the directions so I used the following: I left out the soaking part, used 3 small granny smith apples, 2 tbsp butter, 1/2 cup packed brown sugar, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1 tbsp water, 1 tbsp cornstarch. Used the pepperidge farms dough with an egg wash and turbinado sugar- absolutely mouthwatering. We only had 1/2 of a turnover left over after everybody dug into them warm, but with that 1/2, I found out that it's also great cold.

Great recipe!  I substituted Splenda Brown Sugar Blend instead of real brown sugar.  Be sure to follow the directions on the puff pastry box for the correct baking time and temp!

this recipe was awesome!  i skipped putting the apples in the lemon water and cut them just before.  i didn't even peel them and they were fine (just make sure you slice into small pieces).  also made just one giant turnover and drizzled the extra brown sugar/butter mix over the top for a crispy/chewy finish.  it was delicious!

These are great, but I am wondering how you freeze them. Oh, and would you do the glaze before you freeze them or after you take them out of the freezer. Thank You.

Im rating the filling only as I would be making my own pastry sheets.  the filling is way to sweet it is too sweet in my oppinion, I didnt like the texture of the sauce. I  tried keeping the apples.  You will need to cook the apples longer than it says because they still come out a bit on the harder side.

This is very good. The one change that I made is to wait tell the apple filling cools all the way untill you add it to the dough.

This recipe is the best, and so simple! I agree with other raters that the apple filling was more than my pastry sheets could handle, but that just meant I got to eat it out of the skillet, which isn't really a problem! :) The pastry sheets puff up so beautifully, it will make anyone look like a pastry chef!! I took another reviewers advice and cut slits in the top of each to give them more of a professional look, and it came out great! I will definitely be making this recipe over and over!

These were a hit to the going-away party I brought them to at work! I made little mini apple turnovers, so everyone could get some. Made 18 little turnovers from two sheets of pastry dough.  Also added nutmeg to the topping and just sprinkled the nutmeg-sugar mix on. Will be making this again!

I substituted fresh pitted cherries for the apples in this recipe. My only comment is to advise people to use parchment paper before putting the turnovers on the baking sheet. I thought mine were well sealed but they leaked all over my baking sheet, creating quite a mess. Next time I will use parchment paper before baking these. They were very good.

This was a great recipe. I added a tiny bit more corn starch as other users said the sauce was too thin. But they turned out great. I baked mine for 20 minutes. I also drizzled a little honey on top right before eating one.

YUMMY. I cut recipe in half because I only had 2 people and one sheet of pastry. There was a lot of sauce for the apple filling, I shouldn't have used it all - it was hard to seal the triangles & seeping out of the seams, and while baking gooped out even more, which burned the bottoms of my turnovers. Still though, they were yummy - I cant wait to try again without burning anything. Next time will cut brown sugar in half, I think that will make less sauce.

Great easy recipe! Next time I will remember to set out the puff pastry much earlier (40 min to thaw).
I would use either smaller apples or only 3 instead of 4. I had too much filling left over, which is fine 'cause I can always use it to make an apple crisp.
Thanks for the recipe!

Very yummy!  I used an egg wash and diced the apples instead of slicing them.  I will make these again!

Wow! Tastes like store bought - but better!  I cut the recipe in half with no problems.  I didn't understand the "unpeel" the layers part - my puff pastry package said not to do that so I just rolled out the dough.  The icing really brings out all the flavors so don't skip this step!

Absolutely fabulous!!  Hard to eat just one!!  The only thing I found was that I made too much filling, so I just threw it into a leftover pie crust. Next time I will make a little less filling.

This is a great recipe. I used only 3 large apples and a bit less sugar. I also used homemade puff pastry. I really thinned out the glaze and brushed just a tiny bit over so it would give the pastry a sweet taste and a slight sheen. I served them hot out of the oven with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Everyone loved them!

My family ate these so fast, I was lucky to get one! The only changes I did was that I did not soak the slices in water and lemon first. If you work quickly, you're fine and the filling is thicker that way! Also, I brushed the tops with a little milk and sprinkled with sugar before baking. They came out just like the apple farms sell!

I bought frozen puff pastry dough as I could'nt find anything that said puff pastry sheets. The dough was very easy to roll and made beautiful turnovers.  I thought the filling would be too sweet with all that sugar, but this recipe is perfect as is, but I made a note to line the baking sheet with parchment paper for easier cleaning. I am sure to make these again.

These were super easy to make. The only thing I did differently was cut back on the brown sugar as I felt one cup seemed like a lot. My husband said they were the best turnovers he ever had. :)

The filling was very fluid-y, so i strained the apples before filling the turnovers and then when serving them used the strained liquid as part of the topping.  (I reduced it more in a sauce pot while they were cooking and poured it over the turnovers warm).  Yummy!

These were really easy and good to make. I followed the advice of others and doubles the amount of cinnamon and put confectioners sugar and cinnamon on them instead of glaze. The best thing about them is that they are not too sweet. Will make these again for sure.

These turned out great!! They were easy to make and I still had lots of delicious apple filling left over for an ice cream topping or more turnovers. I did double the cinnamon though, but followed everything else to a T. Thanks for the receipe.

WOW WOW WOW. I was afraid to make turnovers for years. I tried this recipe and was nervous. This is great. My husband says they are the best he has ever had. He brought some to his friends who work on an apple farm and they keep asking for more. So I keep making them for his friends and they keeping giving me apples from the apple farm. Can't lose with that deal. THANKS

Did it with 8 Gala apples, since that's what I needed to get rid of. Doubled the ingredients. I made it into a long strudel. Next time I should prob. use both sheets (made with Pepperidge Farm Puff Pastry Sheets)
Didn't do lemon bath.

I followed the recipe exactly as directed and the turnovers came out perfect.  I didn't add the glaze on top, as I felt that a whole cup of brown sugar inside the turnover was enough sweets for me and my family.  Even without the glaze, they tasted great!  Brushing egg on top before popping them in the oven definitely helped with the appearance when it was done.  Overall, this was delicious.  It was not a quick recipe for me, since it took me quite some time to put the turnovers together.  Some of them got a little messy but with a little practice, most of them came out looking like perfect triangles.

Really delicious and very easy.  My only problem was too much filling for the amouth of dough.  I think I had really big apples.  So this time I have extra dough ready.  Also maybe needed a little more cornstarch to thicken my jucy apples.  I have also thickened these with flour and it works great.  They are always gone in minutes.  Now on my favorites list!

this is a great recipe. but feel free to add a pinch of nutmeg and maybe a pinch extra cinnamon. i also did not feel the lemon water thing was necessary. i also think that the thinner you slice the apples, the better because turnovers do not fit very much filling and so you can get more apples in if you thinly slice. and dont undercook the apples because it does taste really good when the turnovers melt in your mouth!

These turned out great. My husband said they were better than store-bought.  I didn't put the glaze on, but I brushed with a little butter and sprinkled some sugar on top.  A very simple and yummy recipe to try!

This is so easy to make and has wonderful results!  I, too, had additional apples, but I didn't mind one bit - we spooned them over vanilla ice cream for an additional treat.  I agree with another reviewer, if you don't make the turnovers, at least make the apples, you won't be sorry.
Thanks for the great and easy recipe!

We made this for friends and everyone loved the flakiness and the not too sweet filling. Everyone said they were better than bakery. I also used the parchment paper and was very glad I did.  We used the leftover filling on our overnight baked French Toast!

Great recipe. I went the extra mile and made my own puff pastry from scratch. It was fun. My first attempt at making puff pastry. Turned out great although maybe just a little raw in the middle. I'll have to roll out the pastry a little thinner next time. Puffed up nicely but it should puff up even more when baked through. And, yes there was too much apple filling, so I'll get to make it again soon. I added a little flour to the butter block cutting it in with a food processor. Makes the block more maleable when cold.

Great easy recipe. I didn't try the glaze as I did not have the correct sugar but they were great anyway.  I did add a small amount of fresh nutmeg and some sultanas for extra flavour. This ones a keeper

Living in a county that bills itself as the Apple Capital of Georgia and has orchards everywhere, we're always looking for good apple recipes, and this one is a WINNER.
It's a bit sweet for us, though, so next time we'll cut down on the sugar. Most people like things sweeter than we do, however.

This recipe tastes great..but don't panic if there is a lot of brown sugar syrup leftover and you trouble sealing the dough.  I used a sieve spoon.  Also I know why people said to use parchment paper as they leak.  However they are wonderful!!Be sure to check the bottom to make sure they are done.  Thanks for a great recipe.  My family loved them.

I skipped the water & the lemon because I felt it wasn’t needed.  All other measurements we’re followed, except I needed to mix a total of 1 & 1/2 tablespoons of cornstarch, because my butter, apple, sugar & cinnamon we’re not thickening enough while on the stove.  The thin consistency of the cooled apple mixture was very difficult to successfully fill the squares of cooled puff pastry, and seal the edges properly.    I have now frozen the 8 turnovers with hopes that I can bake them in the morning with a better end result.  Here’s hoping.

Like some other reviewers, my apple mixture had too much sauce in the pan. I attribute this to the moisture of the apples. I just scooped out the apples from the pan and left the excess sauce behind. The turnovers were perfect. My husband pored the excess sauce over vanilla ice cream

I am a fairly good baker but I stay away from things that require me to make pie dough, including turnovers. This recipe takes that step away and allows me to make yummy apple turnovers with a fluffy puff pastry crust.They disappear quickly in my household!

I made these exactly as described, except for the icing. I omit the milk and just stir in a little hot water to the icing sugar until it's thick enough to drizzle. The vanilla, while lovely, makes the icing beige and by using hot water, the icing thickens and firms up when it cools. My husband loved them! Thanks!

Really tasty!  (How can you go wrong with apples, butter and a cup of brown sugar?!) 

I only gave it 4 stars because the main image shown clearly had an egg wash on it and I'm pretty sure it has a vent hole poked in it, neither of which is mentioned in the recipe, both of which would make a big difference.  

But I'll definitely try it again with those additions.

I changed a couple of things.  1.  I added in some raisins 2.   I made it into one big roll to slice and cooked it for an extra 5 to 8 mins and it came out perfectly moist and yummy.  This is a great recipe I intend to try it with peaches next.

Great recipe, but the cornstarch did not sufficiently thicken the sauce.  I made a slurry with some of the apple juices and a bit of flour.  That did the trick!

These were a quick, easy and very nice treat. I didn't bother soaking the apples in lemon juice and water, as you can't see the apples in the finished product. I added nutmeg and ginger to mine, just out of preference.

They where easy to make and did not take to much time. The only problem I had was they where just a little burnt, and the wax paper stuck to the turnovers. but other than that they where delicious, and I would happily make them again.

This recipe is fun and easy to make for any occasion. It was very enjoyable to make and was not time consuming at all. The glaze soaked in very well and was not too thick or watery. There was a lot of filling so make sure you have lots of extra puff pastry sheets just in case. After the turnovers cooled and the glaze soaked in a little bit they tasted like they were made by a small-town family run bakery and not a middle schooler.

This is a great recipe! I made this in my cooking class with my group, and it was so worth the wait! I really enjoyed this recipe because it was gooey on the inside but nice and soft on the outside. It's so easy to make and because of the puff pastry it makes it even easier. I found it easier to dice the apples instead of  slice them because it makes more room in the puff pastry. Next time I might be add some vanilla to the sauce, but that's just me. That's why I loved this recipe!

The recipe was the best apple turnovers I have had in awhile. I'd recommend making these cause they are perfect for beginners and people wanting a quick and easy snack.

I love this recipe! Its easy for a beginning baker, and it tastes fabulous! You don't really need the lemon juice and water at the beginning, and that's most likely the reason for others reviews saying that it's too watery. I would probably dust the turnovers with powdered sugar instead of frosting them, but that's just me. These apple turnovers are great, I will absolutely bake them again!

I loved this recipe. It was a great! I think it needs a little bit more brown sugar but other than that  it was fine. We had about two batches of filing so we made a lot of turnovers  but who cares they are so good. This recipe is great and you should try it!

The apple turnovers were very delicious! If I made it again I would probably only make 3/4 of the apples and sauce, there were plenty of left-overs. I just ate them though, and they were really good.  I could also probably do without so much sugar. I used store bought puff pasty sheets and that made making these very quick and simple. What took the most work and time was peeling, slicing, and coring the apples. I have thought about maybe making a chocolate glaze instead of just plain vanilla glaze. I believe that the apple turnovers would go well with a cup of peppermint tea. I will most likely make these again.

I love these awesome flaky apple turnovers. These apples in the filling were just the right texture. The glaze melts into the pastry when the turnover is warm and it is a nice texture. One thing I might change is a little bit less sauce. When I made the filling I had just enough apples but left over sauce. Otherwise this is a nice recipe for a cold winter's day. This would also go well when drinking milk.

The result was great. I thought all the portions were correct and the flavor was not too sweet, with a warm cinnamon flavor. the Texture was gooey and the puff pastry was flaky. the glaze was sweet and worked well with the tartness of the apples. my only complaint is I should of added more glaze.

First of all, we made this as a class and it came out delicious and smells good. When I checked our oven, the apple sauce was like starting to oozing out and it's still tastes great. I've never made apple pie or turnovers before, this is the easiest recipe that we've ever made. I might make them again. I really loved it

The recipe was great, it was simple and easy. When we were done cooking the turnovers, we let them cool, and after that, we ate them, they tasted delicious. If I could rate this recipe six stars I would, and I would recommend this recipe, to anybody who wants to eat something delicious. This recipe would be great with ice cream.

YUMMM! 
I did cube the apples VS slicing and I used some of the apple liquid to make the glaze vs milk and vanilla. On another batch I egg washed and topped with turbinado sugar.  The mixture was runny BUT I just used a slotted spoon to spoon on the mixture. Super easy!

After you roll out the puff pastry, put it back in the fridge to chill - otherwise it is a sticky mess.

Easy to make and delicious. I, however, rolled each square a little larger and overfilled, They came out giant, think next time I'll stick to the original size and make more of them.

I had 20 oz of homemade puff pastry, which I used. It would have been helpful if the recipe said what thickness the pastry should be and how big the squares should be. Also, with the liquid from the apples, it was virtually impossible for me to get the turnovers sealed.
I will probably try them again though because they sure tasted good.

THere was way more filling then the dough could hold.  It was delicious and went over really well with everyone who tried it. I made a half recipe of the filling for a second go and it was perfect.

This recipe tastes great, not too sweet. For some reason the heat was too high for my oven though and I had to adjust so that it didn't burn.

This recipe is good! I had trouble with the dough squares. Can only fill so much in the pastry. I used jarred apples instead of making them from scratch! Shame on me!! They were good slightly warm with a small scoop ice cream.

Easy recipe. It took me a little extra time because i work slowly but they look perfect and tasted great. Next time i will use less brown sugar and substitute plain sugar for the fill, which looked darker than the Bakery ones. These tasted better though.

OMG! These are the best turnovers ever! A short cut that works great is to use pie filling. I used cherry and made the egg wash for the crust. These are best eaten warm but you will have trouble stopping at one.

Made exactly by recipe and it is delicious.  I had never used puff pastry before so I found at the last minute that the pastries were disks meant to use with toppings.  I simply poured the apples over the pastries, then served in dessert bowls with whipped cream and a cherry.  I will definitely make this again.

The taste of these is great, like small apple pie bites. I thought the pastry was messy though, many of them opened up and it became a bit of a mess.

I added sharp cheddar cheese with the apples after they cooled. I used 3/4 c of sugar but the sugar blend is organic sugar and stevia. Puff pastry amazing! Please brush the dough with an egg wash and they look beautiful. Instead of a icing I used caramel sauce. The cheese takes some of the sweetness and mellows it out. I also diced the apples.

This was sooo yummy!  I made it exactly as written with unpeeled Honey Crisp Apples.  The filling was delicious and the crust flaky.  The smooth drizzled vanilla icing topped the flavors off nicely.  I served it warm with Extra Creamy Cool Whip.  My husband loved it!  I will be making it again.

i honestly hate looking up "homemade" anything and seeing the words ..canned pastry dough.. seriously. Why not just got to the store and get canned apples as well, and make a yummy  from the box tasting  pastry !! or better yet just go to McDonalds and buy 12 "pies" that taste the same. If your going to do a job right and heat up your oven, make the dough as well, all the canned stuff tastes the same and tastes like crud.

this is really good. I did take the brown sugar down to 1/2 a cup and 2 tablespoons of cinnamon, and I think 25 minutes of cook time at 400 degrees was too much, mine cooked in 15 minutes, but really really good. I've never attempted to use puff pastry or made anything close to this, it was super easy and super delicious!! I'll be making this again. not sure why people had issues with the sauce thickening, mine thickened with no problem. thanks for such a great recipe

This was delicious and so easy to make. If you’re in the mood for apple pie with less work, this is it!  I only used a 1/2 cup of brown Sugar. It still had a wonderful sweetness. Next time I make these I’ll try a 1/4 cup Sugar and update my review.

* I also did not soak the apples in lemon water. Unnecessary.

I added a bit of vanilla extract and a little more cornstarch. Instead of icing I sprinkled sugar on top of the pastry. Delicious! I also made one and a half portion and used it for pie filling!

Very easy to make and delicious!  I had extra "sauce" left over after filling the turnovers and I didn't want to waste it.  So instead of making the called for glaze, I served the sauce on the side and let everyone put extra on if wanted.  They LOVED it!!

First, they turned out to be tasty.  I will cut back the brown sugar and butter by about half, add a pinch of salt, and cut the apples into smaller pieces.  The cinnamon amount was fine for my family.  They prefer the turbine do sugar on top so I did not do the glaze.  I will make these again.

I used half the sugar. The apple slices were thin enough but too long. Could have gotten more filling in if I would have cut the apple slices smaller.

Sometimes apples are sweet enough on their own.  I only used 1 1/2 C of brown sugar and they came out delicious.  No confectioners sugar needed. 

I made 4 turnovers from one pastry sheet.  Froze the remainder of apple mixture in small batches and the other pastry sheet for another time.

For taste. I followed recipe exactly. I used gala apples bc to me apples are apples. I used Pepperidge farms pastry sheets. The sauce on the stove top of apples cinnamon and brown sugar and butter was too liquidy even after it cooled off so I just used a slotted spoon. I’m not the best with making a turnover so they came out kinda goofy looking. And oven at 400 only took 15 mins not 25 and my oven is 1 year old. Taste was just like a Pepperidge farm frozen turnover. Some of the juices oozed out and burnt but otherwise delicious.

Absolutely delicious! I ended up using 1 more tbsp of cornstarch and water because I didn't find it thick enough. I brushed it with an egg wash as per other users as well but overall it is a delicious and very easy recipe. I served them for dessert and my guests went for seconds.

I made these delicious pastries just as directed and they were tasty but decided to try them again substituting granulated sugar and only a half cup. One recipe of apples as called for equaled six pastry pockets . Either recipe gets two thumbs up, five stars.

Loved it! The only thing is I had way too much filling left over, I ended up using two packages of puff pastry. Otherwise great and will definitely make these again!

Everyone really enjoyed these. The changes that I made were using Earth Balance® instead of butter and cutting the light brown sugar back to a 1/2 cup. There was a small amount of the filling leftover so I made a personal size apple crisp.

I used less sugar as suggested by another rater, and they turned out beautiful and so tasty! Parchment liner was a great help in cleanup. 
I thought my husband would heat one each morning for breakfast, but instead, he would heat one each evening and eat it ala mode for dessert. We'll definitely be having these again! Thanks

My husband loves the prepared frozen turnovers , so I decided to treat him to a homemade version. From now on, the only frozen turnovers in our freezer will be these. I went the egg wash and sugar route, using sanding sugar. Like others, I more or less chopped the apples, and did have to use additional water in cooking. Golden raisins were a must in my estimation, so in they went during the cooking stage. Needless to say , hubby was happy. Four for our tummies, four for the freezer. And a little filling left for four in the morning sleepy trips to the kitchen.

Absolutely delicious! I used other reviewer's suggestions regarding using less brown sugar and adding cornstarch in 1 step, also added vanilla. I did notice that filling the pastry was tricky as the filling began to melt the pastry; however, I am a novice at this.  My husband and I both loved it - will definitely make this again!

I made this recipe with my sister and it tastes amazing!!! One thing that I would suggest is to use as little juice as possible inside the turnover because when they were baking it smelled like something was burning because the juice had oozed out onto the pan and burned.  Overall, it was a great recipe and I would definitely try it again!!!

These were just ok for me. I hate working with puff pastry and this recipe did nothing to make me feel better about it. I followed the recipe exactly but if I ever had the urge to make these again, I'd probably add a lot more spices.  The flavor of the filling was missing something, just can't put my finger one what it was - perhaps a pinch of cloves? Salt definitely. I crimped the edges shut with a fork but they still exploded and spilled their juices everywhere. Thank goodness for parchment. Anyway, one reviewer said ''don't worry if some of the liquid spills out while you're crimping...'' Garbage advise. That's where most of the spillage happened. Wet the edges with water first then crimp! And the apple filling turned out way too liquid-y. Just not a great recipe.

Delicious and relatively easy - my kind of recipe.  I did not want to waste the puff pastry, so instead of trimming them into square, I simply quartered the large square and folded each quarter into a rectangle and used a fork to seal the edges.  This method still looks attractive AND tastes better because you can fit more apples into each piece.

This recipe was a complete mess start to finish. First, don't bother soaking the apples unless they're going to sit for quite a while before you cook them, and even then it won't matter because they're going to brown during cooking. Dice rather than slice the apples. Make sure you use light brown sugar, skip the water with the cornstarch and just add the cornstarch, and cut the butter by at least a third. Make sure you use an egg wash with the puff pastry. 

As is, these are awful, they're  runny, hard to handle (due to runnyness) and just end up tasting like soupy sugar encased in  flaky pastry. The sugar is so much that it completely overwhelms the apple and cinnamon flavour. The amount of tweaking needed to make this recipe edible, much less good, is too much for it to be a recipe worth saving.

These are so, so good!  I think the frozen puff pastry is an acceptable shortcut, but I've also made my own butter pie crust for the filling as well.  Honestly, they were equally delicious, and I usually have frozen puff pastry in my freezer.  I can make these for a special weeknight dessert, and everyone loves them.

Seriously, what's NOT to love here?  Easy, oh so delicious, enough said!     It made a lot and I actually came out with 9 turnovers and 1 galette.   I actually used those pie crusts from the refrigerator section of the grocery store; not the puffed pastry sheets only because it's what I had on hand at the time. Once I had finished making the turnovers, I decided to use my last pie crust to make the galette.  They turned out just great!

Delicious and so easy to make! I made the recipe as stated with the four apples but had about an apples worth of leftovers that couldn't quite make it into the turnovers. I heated the leftovers and served them over the top of the turnovers (with a generous scoop of ice cream) and it was a great way to incorporate more apples! If I made this again, I would cook the apples much longer than the 2 minutes stated - probably until they were more of an apple sauce quality, but that's my personal preference. I would also probably reduce the amount of apples to 3 just so I wouldn't have too much leftovers again. Great recipe!

My mother liked it, I didn't.  The main reason why I didn't like it was because the philo dough was so pesky.  It wasn't very cooperative.  The filling went nice.

Very good and simple recipe with the puff pastry.  I made a mix of smaller and larger turnovers to suit varying appetites and chose to add sugar to the top rather than icing.

This was a little bland for my tastes. It was certainly easy to make, but I had to add a few twists to give it more depth. I spread caramel sauce on the inside of the puff pastry squares before adding the filling & had to serve it warm & a la mode. Of course guests enjoyed it cold & room temp as well. All in all, it was ok.

Delicious and very easy! I added a bit too much if the sauce which made pinching the dough difficult so recommend using slotted spoon to dish apples into dough. Will add a little maple syrup to glaze next time too. Yum!

Thank you for the recipe. I was looking for some easy way to make-use of the apples that I had in the fridge, and I stumbled upon your recipe. It's easy, quick, and tasty! Oh, I also added raisins and cheese to the mixture ^_^, just because I love cheese... ^_^

These turnovers were really easy to make and very tasty!  I followed the recipe exactly as it was written.  Used 4 good sized Granny Smith's and only used about 1/2 of the apple filling.  So put the remainder in tupperware and think i will make a few more tomorrow for family.  Worth the time!  
Update:  10/23/16  I've made this recipe 3 times since i wrote the original review (had a large bag of Granny Smith's).  Finally have decided you only need 3 good sized apples..kept all the other ingredients same.    You have to let the apples and the brown sugar cook down until almost syrup consistency ...much longer than the 2 minutes as stated in the recipe.  If too runny, your filling will run right out of the pastry.   The pastry will stick together better if you leave the second sheet in the fridge while working on the first batch.   Dough gets really soft and stretches if too warm.  PARCHMENT PAPER ON YOUR PANS!   Save yourself a ton of clean-up time!    If i didn't mention it before, they are delicious!!

I had some apples too soft to eat--so I made this recipe but cut in half.  I did use an egg wash as well.  Delicious!

These were so good and so fast and easy to make.  Followed the advice of other reviews and skipped the lemon water bath.  Only used a half cup of brown sugar and added a pinch of salt and a pinch of nutmeg to the other filling ingredients. Chopped about 4 medium-sized Granny smith apples in small cubes instead of slices.  Make sure the filling is completely cool before using. Added about a heaping tablespoon of filling to the center of pastry and use the egg wash to seal the edges of the puff pastry and brush on the tops. I sprinkled the tops with sugar instead of glazing, but either would be great. Line your baking sheet with parchment paper for easy cleanup and I baked at 375 for about 18 minutes and they were perfectly golden brown. My husband loved them and they were gone in 2 days.  I ate one and he ate the other 7. I will be adding a few cranberries to the apple filling the next time I make them to cut down on the sweetness. These will be perfect for the upcoming fall season when apples and cranberries are at the peak of freshness and they will warm up the cool kitchen in the mornings.

I believe it would've been better to have diced or shredded the apples. There was too much liquid and it seeped out my turnovers and got onto the baking sheet, burned, and made the turnovers taste bad in certain spots plus made my house smoky. Best to use a fork to press edges together-first batch in the oven I used my fingers and they were coming undone like crazy. Then I used a fork on the second batch and it stayed together better.

These were beautiful and delicious and got rave reviews from everyone who tried them.  I made some big ones by cutting the pastry squares in fourths and some small ones by cutting the squares in ninths, and they both worked well.  This recipe made much more filling than I could use, because the filling tended to run out of the pastry unless I used just a small amount.  My main complaint about this recipe is that it didn't feel homemade to me.  The storebought pastry wound up being most of the dessert after it puffed up in the oven.  I'm not going to give this a poor rating because of that, because not everyone cares whether their dessert is homemade or just semi-homemade, but I don't think I'll make this again unless I try to make my own pastry dough.

These were really tasty and made a great impression! They followed an Italian dinner, which was heavy; but the turnovers were surprisingly light.  Served them warm.
I misjudged the thickness of the icing, which was a bit thin, but still tasted delicious!  I highly recommend this.  Also, I substituted unsalted butter and Truvia Brown Sugar substitute. Could NOT tell the difference. :)

Quick and simple to make and devoured in no time!  My only alteration was I cut air holes in the top, brushed with an egg wash and sprinkled raw sugar on top before baking.  Will definitely be making again.

Good flavor,  I had to add extra cornstarch to thicken the apples, and I used Penzeys Apple Pie Spice mix for the cinnamon.  My only problem was with the cooking time. After 20 minutes the bottom of my turnovers burnt. Will make again but will try cooking at a lower temperature.

I made these with cherry filling as its my husbands fav.  I had a hard time sealing the edges? He said they were great but 20 min. would be enough and I should have lined the pan. all in all a great success and company worthy.

These apple turnovers were very easy and fun to make and they taste like they came from a bakery!  I skipped the lemon juice and water soak and next time I will skip the additional water and just mix the cornstarch in with the brown sugar.  I had quite a bit of apple filling leftover, even though I filled my pastry as full as possible.  I could probably make another 3 turnovers with the extra filling, if I had the dough to do it with.  I pressed the edges together with the tines of a fork that I periodically dipped in water to help seal the edges.  I will definitely line my pan with parchment the next time I make these, for easier clean up.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I followed other reviewers and I only used 3 apples, a half cup of brown sugar and 1 tbsp of butter, for the icing I only used half the confectioners sugar and it made the perfect amount.  I also folded into a square and sprinkled sugar on the parchment paper and used an egg wash then sprinkled sugar on top again.  It was absolutely amazing - I cannot wait to make these again.  Even my kids who hate apples ate two each.... awesome

Very easy and tasty - although there was too much liquid once the apples were cooked and a lot of it ran out of the turnovers during baking.. Thankfully I lined my pan with parchment. Next time I will try dicing the apples so I can fit more into each turnover.

Well, with alterations, this recipe is great. I made these a second time without the water, and they were great.  I still felt like they were lacking a little.  It was my first time using puff pastry, so that's why I used this recipe.Water makes the apples watery and a mess.

These are fabulous! Followed another reviewers advice and added corn starch to the brown sugar,also added the  cinnamon to the brown sugar and added 1/2 teas vanilla.I diced the apples and only used 2 large granny smith and I didn't soak them. I only baked for 20 minutes. So easy. Thank you for the recipe, I will be making these again!

this was FANTASTIC!  I must have purchased really large apples - I had more mixture than I needed.  will buy extra pastry next time just in case.  having more than you need of this delicious treat is not a bad thing at all!  easy to make and reheats nicely the next day.

Yes, I will definitely make these again.  I  made them tonight for after  dinner coffee. I  had to  chase both my husband and my son out of the kitchen a few times, so they would be available for our guests.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe. They were so easy to make and extremely delicious to eat.  Bon appetite!

Very easy to make. To cut down on the sugar I used a splenda/brown sugar mix, and only used 3/4 C to further reduce to less than half the total sugar. I also omitted any glaze. They came out perfect with half the guilt. I made 8 total and froze 4 to be reheated for the future.

Too much work to do the filling.  Just use a can of whatever pie filling you like and proceed with the rest of the recipe.  Quick and delicious!

The apples didn't get soft enough and they  didn't have much flavor. Too much brown sugar, which completely took away from the apples. The glaze was way too sweet.

I had to add like 4 more tablespoons of corn starch to thicken then apple mix. I had to cook and reduce nearly 8-10min. The puff pastry only makes 4 per box. My suggestion is get pie crust as well and make a pie.

WOW! These were awesome! I used pears instead of apples because I had a lot of wild pears. They would be great for any fruit really. Love the crust when it comes out of the oven!

Loved this recipe for the apple filling...chopped apples...and made a deconstructed apple pie with my own pie crust and topped with whip cream and a caramel rum sauce.  I will definitely try it with puff pastry next time!

I love this recipe. I usually cut it in half using 2-3 grannies (depending on how large) which makes 8.  If you want to make the full recipe you need 2 boxes of the Pepperridge Farm sheets. You will also need the increase apples. The Pepperidge Farm sheets works like a charm. I cut the brown sugar down to 1/2 cup for 1/2 recipe and added 2 t of cinnamon.

This was absolutely delicious!  One thing, though.. I'd never used  puffed pastry before, so I didn't know it needed to be chilled to be able to work with it... But flour on the surface helped... Also,  I didn't  use the lemon water. .  I cut the apples up [in chunks, not slices]  and put them  right into the pan. I also threw some blueberries 
in and added a bit extra brown sugar.  I didn't  glaze them.... I just brushed them with 
melted butter and popped them into the oven. 
My family killed them! ??

This recipe is VERY tasty and very easy,  Some say the apple mixture is too runny stay in the pastry, which is true if you don't thicken with the corn starch AND let the mixture cool.  If you follow the instructions and let it cool, you'll have a very thick mixture that will stay in the pastry.  One tip to keep the filling inside the pastry is to lightly wet the edge / rim of the pastry before you fold over the dough and then press with the tines of a fork.  It looks great and it helps make the seem secure.  Whipping cream instead of icing is a rich and less sweet option.  Have fun!

Truly delicious filling!  Perfect amount of sugar for a turnover filling.  To balance this amount of sugar, I added 1/8 teaspoon of salt.  Perfection.  A keeper :)

As my first attempt at apple turnover this was a great, easy to follow recipe. The only issue I ran into at all was a little hard to close the edges of the pastry crust. Super easy though and tasted delicious! Will certainly make them again.

Great Apple Filling Recipe and I used Cortland Apples.  I used Pillsbury Crescent Seamless Dough Sheets and shaped them as Turnovers and Popovers.  I then brushed them with the Egg Wash and sprinkled Sugar.  You will need to adjust your Oven Temperature, to 375 Degrees, and only Cook them for 10-13 Minutes.

Very good filling. I found it to be very versatile as well. I didn't have all the ingredients so i had to modify quite a bit. I had run out of brown sugar so i used white instead (reduced the amount considerably). Also i did not have cornstarch so i used custard powder. I will make this version again.

Excellent base recipe!  I do recommend using about 50% more cornstarch just in case your apples have more water than you expect, but these come out fantastic with puff pastry sheets!  So easy.  We didn't like the flavor of the glaze, or how pale the turnovers were without the egg wash.  So we brushed the turnovers with beaten egg and sprinkled with "raw" sugar instead, and they look just like you'd get from a bakery!  I baked them for a working breakfast and they made our morning!

I made these from apples from our trees.  The only thing I can say is put lots of apples in the turnovers. The second time I made these I didn't put many in and it wasn't as good.

I love this recipe! I've used it several times, but I adjust a few things. I only cut the pastry into fourths once-otherwise I have a hard time fitting the apples in! In the past I used the Granny Smith apples recommended but today I tried fresh-picked courtlands. It came out incredible! I also use a caramel drizzle made with butter, brown sugar, and heavy cream. Awesome!

Wow, these ARE better than the bakery! I didn't do it exactly as directed b/c im a bit lazy. Skipped the lemon water soak - just squeezed a little lemon on the apples for flavor. Also used honey crisp apples, and added a dash of nutmeg. Really easy and good thank you for the recipe!

Made as written, and found the apples had a lot of extra sauce when done cooking.  We kept that sauce and used it instead of the sugar glaze.  Very good.

As I had a leftover rolled pie crust (I had previously made spicy beef turnovers), I decided to make apple turnovers as I had a lot of organic apples hubby brought home from a co-worker. As only one was Granny Smith, I also had to use a Fuji apple. I knew the pie crust would not rise much as it is not a puff pastry. I read reviews and used less brown sugar and more cinnamon. I left the apples too long on the stove & so they were a bit browned. I didn't use the glaze but made sure I sealed with an egg & then brushed the tops of the 4 turnovers with the egg. I never brought the paper for the baking sheet and knew they wouldn't stick because I have a very good sheet. The worst part was trying to fill the pastry! Came out excellent, will make this recipe again! Don't forget to make a few slits on top.

This recipe is absolutely delicious.  Next time I will soak raisins and add them as a special treat.  I loved them with just powdered sugar on them and if you go to Peperidge farm they show you how to cut the dough into squares.  Thank you for sharing this recipe with me.

these were great! my family loves them :)

tips: 1. the purpose of soaking the apples is just so they dont brown and you can skip that step however if you do follow that step after straining the apples place them on some paper towel to pull out a bit more of the liquid

2. it does help to cook the apples a little more just to thicken the sauce they are in.. when they bake the sauce heats up and becomes runny so the thicker the better

3. the pastry can be a really difficult product to work with because it has to stay cold so keeping the product in the refrigerator while not in use helps also rolling the pastry in a cold surface helps a lot... something like a frozen cookie sheet or a slab of marble will help to keep it cold for as long as possible

Very good.  Added another 2 Tbls butter.  My daughter ate the small amount of leftovers out of the skillet.  I also used flour added to the cinnamon/brown sugar, since I was out of cornstarch.  Tasted just fine.

should have used an egg wash, but they sealed up just fine.  i did NOT soak in water and lemon juice.  i used 3 Granny Smith and 2 Fuji's and it came out fine, also cooked about 4 minutes.  next time i will just try with a bunch of apples and see if it makes a difference.  no glaze either, they were fine plain and perhaps could have used some powdered sugar but other than that quite perfect for the first time out of the box.  

one other tip, if your wife wants a second one, DON'T hide them, and give it to her or she won't talk to you for the rest of the night.

I got a Granny Smith apple hanging around on my kitchen bench for over a week. Didn't like eating old apples so I searched for an easy and quick recipe. I got this one and I whipped it up within 30 minutes! I adjusted the serving size to 2 so the recipe called for 1 apple. Turned out I could make 4 pieces. I skipped the water bath and added 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. Also, I didn't bother making the frosting. Next time I'll egg wash them and sprinkle with raw sugar before baking. Got problem with the sealing too though I pressed them using a fork and cut a slit. A tip that I'll try next time is to brush the edges of pastry with egg wash which will act like a glue helping the pastry to stick together. I don't understand why some reviewers rated this recipe based on problems they had with working with puff pastry. Just find something to read and you'll know how to handle it properly. Btw, I ate 2 of these in one go. :P

They tasted great, but I'm not entirely sure they were worth the trouble! I will probably try it again, keeping in mind that:
- I had a ton of leftover apples because they wouldn't fit in the puff pastries
- Even after repairing tears in the puff pastry sheets, the liquid from the apples leaked out and made it very difficult to get them off the baking sheet without breaking them
- The apples could probably be sliced and then the slices cut in half in order to help them fit in the pastries better

They tasted GREAT, though.

These turned out fantastic!! Super fast and tasted great. Not too sweet, which I was worried about. I personally think you only need to make half the glaze for them, though.

Tastes great BUT... Soaked apples have a lot of water and the filling was really liquidy. I had to add extra corn starch and drain the apples. Plus don't really need to cook the apples much before cooking for 20 minutes.  I'm going to look for a raw apple recipe for next time.

These are a huge hit everytime I make them! Be careful how much you fill them because they leak can be hard to close.I did cook the apples a little longer, so they were softer, but that's just personal preference. I recommend using a little more cornstarch than the recipe calls for, so the sauce is thicker. I have had to make double batches of these, and they are the first dessert gone at every gathering!

I tried it exactly as written, except that I added just a little more cinnamon, and a pinch of nutmeg and allspice.  I did also have to use about 1 tsp more cornstarch to get it thicken like I wanted.  I thought it turned out great.  Very tasty and pretty easy.

Made this Christmas Day.  They were easy to do and delicious.  Family loved them.  Skipped the lemon water.  Used three gala apples because I'm not fond of Granny Smith apples.  Used 3/4 cup brown sugar and was plenty sweet enough.  Brushed edges with a bit of beaten egg before sealing with a fork and even though I added quite a bit of filling they only oozed very little.  They puffed up nicely and turned a beautiful golden brown.  I will make them again.

The filling was OK, basic.  I'm not sure of the point of GS apples, I'd think you'd want to cook the filling down a little more than they easily allow.  For the first time in years, I tried Pillsbury packaged puff pastry for the sheets.  Let's just say I won't be stocking my fridge up with that product.

Great Recipe!  My family ate these up within minutes.  Make sure you seal the edges with a fork.  I still had some leakage, but I like a lot of apples.  They are best when they are from the oven, slightly cooled with the glazed.  Yum Yum!

Tastes like Pepperidge Farm turnovers, which is a compliment.  Lots of steps to the recipe, but not hard to do.  I loved them!  I used 5 apples just because I wanted to, doubled the recipe, and used vanilla instead of water in the glaze.

I love the filling but decreased sugar to almost half.  Next time, I'll also cut apples into shorter slices so they fit in the turnovers better.

Made these for the second time today. I still can't believe how great these turnovers are. I changed a few minor things in the process though. I added a few tablespoons of white sugar and a little more constarch than originally called for in the cooking apples and for the glaze I used buttermilk instead of regular and I believe a tablespoon and a half of vanilla. For the reviewers who are saying their glaze turns out too liquid-y, there's a quick fix for that: Add more sugar!

This recipe turned out well for the most part. I divided each puff pastry sheet into four squares, but found that they made huge turnovers, so I divided each square into 2 triangles to make smaller triangles. One thing I learned about puff pastry is to never let it thaw for too long, and to let the filling cool before putting it in. Once the pastry gets too warm, it begins to melt before it hits the oven, and the baked result has a soggy, oily, semi see-through look. They tasted really good though! Will try it again.

I gave this a four star because most of my turnovers broke open and I thought I sealed them secure enough.  Next time I will definitely make sure to press the edges better.  They were great tasting though.

These were awesome! We really liked them. I didn't really know how to fold them properly, so they were UBER ugly, but still really tasty :)

Not as good as old fashioned apple pie, but a fun individual alternative.

Excellent flavour filling. My attempt with store bought pastry was not pretty but wow were they tasty.

Very good and pretty easy.  Apple mix makes twice the quantity needed so either halve the ingredients or buy four pastry shells.

Fantastic, though I would make each turnover half the size - they're easier to eat then.

These are unbelievably good, and really pretty easy to make! I made a batch to take on a team trip last semester and they were a hit (even cold). I never wind up using the icing, since it seems like everyone likes them better without!

This is a delicious recipe! We are sure going to keep this one! We skipped the lemon juice though because with the caramel you can't tell if the apples are brown anyway.
