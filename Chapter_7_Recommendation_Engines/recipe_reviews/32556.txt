I did make some changes.  I only added 1 cup of sugar and heated the water and sugar until the sugar dissolved.  This is a great drink and so easy.  When guests are over, you don't have to mix up Fuzzy Navels, just use this.  Perfect for a group of people.

This went over well at our poker night...esspecially among the women. I too only used 1 cup sugar and it turned out very good! This would make a great summer beverage! Thanks Robin!

Wow Robin! Great beverage! I used this for a ladies luncheon where nobody drinks coffee, tea or milk. We're all coke and pepsi drinkers....BUT EVEN COKE DRINKERS GET TIRED OF IT AND WANT SOMETHING DIFFERENT. This was definitely different and will be my drink of choice both in the winter and the summer! Thanks for sharing this wonderful drink recipe. BTW, I cut down on the water by two cups and did not add any sugar. It was very tasty that way. Of course everyone went home with this recipe!

This is a very tasty and super simple drink to prepare and share with guests or just as a treat to me, myself and I!  I usually add a full medium size bottle of peach schnapps and it turns out just fine.  Be sure to prepare a day ahead so it's iced up and ready to enjoy!  Thanks for sharing!

Very yummy!  Notes:  I used one cup of sugar, but felt like it would have been quite sweet enough without the sugar entirely, and will skip it in the future.  We used the whole bottle of schnapps, and served it with ginger ale-- so good! I would recommend freezing it for longer than 4 hours, it was barely icy at that point.  Perhaps 8 would be better.

I just finished making up a big batch and a half of this for a Super Bowl party this weekend.  As lots of people suggested, I left out the sugar.  Was so eager to try it that I stuck a cup of it in the freezer seperate from the rest, just so I could try it sooner.  It is SO yummy.  Definitely sweet enough withough the sugar!  I even only added some seltzer water to it just now because we don't keep soda in the house...still sweet enough for my tastes!  I know this is going to be a hit at the party, and go too fast!

This will be the third Christmas Eve that I have made this recipe and our family loves it.  It's great because all I have to have is beer for the guys and this for the gals.  I don't add the sugar and it is fine without.  I offer both diet and regular Sprite or 7-up with it.

WOW! Great summer slush!!! I omitted the sugar and used a diet lemon lime drink so I could add more peach schnapps. Everyone raved.

I only used a half cup of sugar and it was very sweet.  Next time will skip it.  Also, I used a full 750 ml bottle of peach schnapps and found the drinks were not very strong.  That's 3 cups of alcohol!  We wound up drizzling a little vodka on top.  I like the method and will tweak my proportions next time.

I made it for New Years eve and everyone liked it,some people barely tasted the peach schnapps so, I added some vodka for those who wanted it a little bit stronger... This recipe is very easy to make plus is very affordable!!! I think it only cost me around $12 and it serves 30...this is going straight to my favs!!!

Wow......this is great!  The only reason I rated it 4 stars is because if you actually added the amount of sugar called for it would be way to sweet.  I cut the sugar down to a little less than a cup.  I also used more schnapps, actually the entire bottle (5th) but did add more water.  Couldn't wait for it to freeze so put it in the freezer for a couple hours and then put some crushed ice in a glass, some of the drink mixture, then filled the rest of the glass up with Sprite.  Fantastic!  Sure it will be even better once its actually frozen. Only caution is that even with a 5th of Peach Schnapps, this does not taste like it has alcohol in it so be careful & be sure to keep it away from kids.  They will definitely think its is just a slushy.  Great summer drink!!

This recipe is wonderful and easy for anyone to make.  I do not use sugar or lemonade in my version.  Instead of the lemonade I use a second can of OJ.  Christmas would not be the same for my family with out this wonderful treat.

This was great---made it for our 4th of July party this past summer and had requests for it to be served at future parties.  It is a little sweet in my opinion so you may only want one or two.

Very tasty and easy to make.  You could really taste the peach but not the alcohol.  You really don't have to add much soda to it.  We are making our second batch in a week.UPDATE: I make this at least once a month. We would much rather have this than ice cream!

Made this for our neighborhood Christmas party and it was PERFECT!  Everyone loved it. I omitted the sugar altogether, but we still thought it was sweet enough.  I'll certainly use this recipe again.

This is the absolute perfect fun summer drink, especially for a group of ladies, ala bookclub or bunco.  I made it as written except did not add sugar (thank goodness - it is VERY sweet) and I added a half bottle of vodka to the mix.  It wasn't very strong, even with the vodka mixed in.  This recipe took about 36 hours to freeze, so plan accordingly.  Also, it served eight people with 2-3 slushes each and every drop was finished.

This is a fun and delicious recipe to serve, and appealing even to guests who are a bit reserved about drinking alcohol. In fact, I have to be careful not to serve this unattended around children, since they drool over the pink-orange slushy mix! Always a hit.

These drinks are really good.  I only added 1 cup of sugar and used the entire bottle of peach schnapps.  After freezing overnight I had used an ice cream scoop for the slush, but it worked perfectly.  My husband requested that I always keep some made in the freezer!

Wonderful drink, very cooling in the hot summer. I didn't add any sugar and it was sweet enough. The third time we made it we added some vodka for an extra kick!

Delicious!  I only used 1 cup of sugar.  My guests really enjoyed this slush.  When we ran out of Sprite, we used Mt. Dew and it still tasted great!

This is an excellent cocktail. Great for my Bunco nights with the girls! I double to recipe and it's always gone by the end of the night. One suggestion, it's a little too sweet for my taste, so I suggest using a 2-liter of diet lemon-lime soda- much better this way.

I love this recipe.  I use it frequently.  Sometimes I mix the Peach Scnapps with ameratto to give it a different flavor.

YUM!! Exactly the drink I was looking for.  I actually mixed it all together & froze then thawed slightly when I was ready to drink.

Wonderful!  I could not taste the alcohol in the slush at all.  Very smooth and delicious.
