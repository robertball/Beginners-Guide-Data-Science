This was great!  Different but really good.  I added more cilantro. Better the next day. Can be used as a dip or salad dressing and probably good with fish.

I did not add the sugar. After tasting it, I did add more chopped cilantro and green onion. It's tasty but could use garlic. This would be good as a low calorie topping for enchiladas or tacos but didn't really hit it home for me as a dip. It's good for using on hand ingredients when you're broke, which I appreciated. I recommend you use fresh lime juice and zest.
