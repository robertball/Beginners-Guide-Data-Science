5 stars not enough! I added buttermilk instead of plain milk, and being in a hurry didn't cut the dough into squares, just rolled it into a wheel and put the beaten egg (yes, 1 is enough) on top, with some shredded provolone just dumped on it. After 10 minutes it was ready and I cut it into wedges. Wonderful!!! like a pizza, but no waiting for the dough to rise! Shamefully easy and quick, and I got a lot of praise.

Made this for a St. Patrick's Day party and everyone loved it! Very easy to make and the recipe is accurate - the only change is that you definitely don't need two beaten eggs - one is more than enough for glazing the bread. Thanks!!

This recipe was quite simple and easy to make but, I found it a little plain. I enjoyed it with cream cheese and some other toppings. Perhaps I'm missing the context of the bread but, there just isn't any excitement.

Excellent recipe. Made it for patty's day and I daresay it will be a recipe I will use alot! I used it as a pizza dough today (as one person mentioned) and it really turned out great! To the person below who had a sticky mess: I had the same result until I remembered that dough needs to be kneaded! I sprinkled some flour on it and kneaded away until it was no longer a sticky mess, this may just be the advice you were looking for. Good luck! It is a really versatile recipe.

Basic Irish Soda Bread Haiku: "Yes, it is basic. By basic, I mean boring. Drag it through some soup!" OK, maybe I'm a novice when it comes to dough, but I had a really difficult, sticky disaster of a time rolling this and cutting it into rectangles. And forget dipping them in the egg (btw, yes, 1 egg's plenty) - I had to brush the egg on. Took more like 22 min. for mine to get even remotely brown. I ate a piece plain (yawn), but liked it a whole lot more when I ate it w/ soup. Later on, I spread humus on it, toasted, and that was pretty tasty, but by itself, it's a little mundane. Perhaps per one of the more glowing reviews, I should've used buttermilk instead?

This recipe was great. I did make some personal changes.  I changed the presentation by cutting the dough into circles. I also dipped the dough into the the eggs, covering both sides, and spreading mozzarella cheese, garlic salt, and chili powder on top. This will be my snack dish for years to come!

The word 'basic' in the title of this recipe started wheels turning in my head. The following is where I went with this wonderful bread: First, I increased the recipe by 50%, then 1) In the dough, I mixed 3 tablespoons sliced black olives and 1/4 teaspoon Herbs de Provence. 2) I rolled it out into a circle about 3/8 of an inch thick. 3) I only used 1 egg for brushing the top. 4) For the topping, I used 4 sun dried tomatoes (sliced), and equal amounts of assiaga, flaked Parmesan and fresh grated mozzarella cheeses ~~ totaling 1 cup. Baking time was 19 minutes @ 400 F. It rose to 3/4 of an inch when done. I cut it into squares and served warm at yesterdays St. Patricks Day party. Okay, so what I did to it made it so VERY unIrish (more mediteranean). I'm looking forward to using this basic recipe for other tasty experiments!

03-17-16 ~ St. Patrick's meals require a good slice of soda bread. This fit the bill and was extremely easy to make. I cut the recipe in half and formed the dough in a rectangle. I made 4 slices and popped it in the toasted oven. It baked up beautifully and went well with 'Guinness Corned Beef' and 'Easy Irish Colcannon' from AR.
