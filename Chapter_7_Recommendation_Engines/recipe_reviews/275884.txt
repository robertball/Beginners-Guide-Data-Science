10.1.19  Whew, a long list of ingredients for a pasta salad.  Equal parts of mayonnaise and apple juice, plus vinegar resulted tin a “way-too-runny” dressing, the macaroni was almost swimming in it.  I added a LOT more mayonnaise, and adjusted a few of the seasonings in accordance with that, but the pasta salad still was too “wet” for lack of a better term.  I scaled down the recipe but followed it to the letter, with the exception of using a Gala apple and green cabbage (what I had on hand), and I did add a bit more apple which added a nice pop of sweetness.  If I were to make this again, I’d most likely cut the apple juice back substantially (maybe even eliminate it), since I couldn’t really taste it in the dressing, and maybe even cut the vinegar back a bit as well.  One thing’s for sure, the liquid in the dressing needs to be reduced somewhere.  The recipe doesn’t tell you to do this, but do set aside some time to chill in the fridge.  In spite of the runniness of the salad, the flavor was OK, but I wouldn’t say it was outstanding.  Doubtful I’ll make this one again even with modifications, just movin' on.

Agreed on the dressing--too watery and too vinegary.  The ingredients are a good mix, though.
