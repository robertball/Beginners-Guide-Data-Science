Had a 1.3 lb of Sabana El Res in the freezer.  Defrosted it and chopped it up in the food processor with salt, pepper, red onion, and 1 de-seeded/veined jalapeño. Substituted chili beans for black beans and 1 pack of Old El Paso taco seasoning.  Substituted 10 oz can of diced tomatoes with green chilies for the fire roasted diced tomatoes and 2 cups beef broth for the vegetable broth.  Cooked it up in my Mealthy MultiPot and it tastes awesome! Can’t wait to roll it up into burritos tomorrow!
