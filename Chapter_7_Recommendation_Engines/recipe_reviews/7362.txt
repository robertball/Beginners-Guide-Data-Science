Someone requested a chocolate spice cake and this recipe was great.  I added 2 tsp of choc cocoa and added a pinch of each nutmeg, cloves, and ginger.

This was a very moist spice cake, but I think its name is misleading -- it's not chocolaty at all. You could probably leave the shaved chocolate out of it altogether and it might not even make a difference! I used buttercream frosting, but didn't care for that -- I think I'd use choc. frosting next time just so the cake lived up to its name a bit more. I'm not saying it wasn't good -- my husband really liked it! But it waas a spice cake, not in any way a chocolate cake. So, just be warned. :)

This is a great recipe, it produces a very moist and flavorful cake.  I've made it twice.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time and got good reviews.  The second time I doubled the recipe, used a 50/50 ratio of cake flour/all purpose flour, added 1 cup chocolate chips, baked 2-8" layers, and frosted with vanilla buttercream icing.  This produced even better results.  Everybody that tried it loved it.

Excellent spice cake! I do agree with other reviewers that it isn't really chocolaty, but, still I thoght it was probably one of the best spice cakes I've ever tasted!
Thanks! :)

I prepared this as a test for Thanksgiving and was asked to bake several more times as well as asked to give out the recipe to my mom-in-law, who loves to bake.  It was a big hit to large crowd of hungry (and picky) eaters!

I loved this recipe. Usually when I bake with butter I can't achieve anything as moist as this. And the hint of chocolate from the chocolate shavings was a nice added touch to the flavor. I baked it in an 8-inch square glass pan so it needed 30 minutes instead of 20, but that was the only change I made. I would definitely make this again. Delicious and easy.

I doubled the recipe and made two, 8-inch square cakes. I used 2.5 oz. chocolate (because that's all I had) for the double recipe, but I melted it first to help incorporate it into the batter. I thought the cake was the perfect balance between chocolate and spice. It doesn't need any frosting; it makes a good snack cake just the way it is.

this cake shouldn't be called chocolate or spice cake. it was moist but anything with eggs and butter usually is. i dressed it up with a cream cheese (hint of orange) frosting and was good but i wouldnt make it again. i'd make a real chocolate cake (oe spice) for that fact. i also added 3 tb. of cocoa powder but it still wasn't chocolatey enough.

the cake is perfectly moist, but my family and i found that chocolate doesn't really go with the spice in the cake. the spices overpower the chocolate. but i love the moisture, so i'm gonna replace the spices and put more chocolate instead.

I love this recipe! I made it for my family and they all love it! Instead of using the cloves i used allspice and pumpkin spice! It was amazing. :) Definitely a repeat.

you just need to add cocoa powder to make this truly a chocolate spice cake, can add chocolate chips or my favourite white chocolate chips to this recipe, I have also added craisins to add a twist to it.

I loved this! I added 1 tsp allspice and mixed essence (I usually add extra spice to my baking) and the flavors were amazing! Thanks

I followed several of the suggestions in other reviews.  I used 3/4 flour and 1/4 cocoa powder, added more spices and used chocolate chips instead of shaved chocolate.  I also had to bake the cake 15 minutes longer than suggested but the outcome was quite tasty.

I replaced the butter with applesauce, which usually works well for cakes & breads, except this was almost too moist and springy, and took twice the baking time.  I don't usually see that result with the applesauce, so I don't know if it was the replacement or the recipe is just like that.  Although I like moist and it was still pretty good.  I agree that it isn't real chocolately, but I LIKED that as I'm not a chocolate freak -- it was more like a spice cake with a hint of chocolate, and I do think they went well together.  (But if you're looking for something really chocolately, this isn't it.)  And no frosting -- I don't think it needs it.

I absolutely loved the flavor of this cake! I have been searching for this for years! Okay,the changes I made were simple. I used the spices to my taste. Also, I melted less than 2 ounces of very dark chocolate (83%) and added it to the batter. Unfortunately mine turned out a little dry but I think it had to do with the pan I used. (Nordicware sculpted sheet pan.)
Every raved about it with a simple milk chocolate icing. I will try this again tomorrow and add a little applesauce.
