Really quick and really easy!  To try and make the recipe a little healthier, I used only the egg white and skim milk.  I also put in more a little more walnut and went light on the flour (to cut carbs and up the protein)  And finally I omitted the butter and just used olive oil.  I really just love how crisp the breading gets and how juicy the chicken stays!

This is my new FAVORITE chicken recipe!  I made my tenders very thin and used a bladed-meat tenderizer, because I am very particular about my chicken consistency.  I made the mistake of not chopping the walnuts small enough, which made breading a bit messy.  Next time I'll fine-chop my walnuts and this recipe will be absolutely superb. Thanks!

This is wonderful!  We really enjoyed the texture differences in the nuts and the chicken, and the flavor was great.  I will always use nuts to "bread" my chicken from now one - this is just too good.

This recipe is wonderful. I used cashews instead of walnuts, and my son who hates nuts ate everything on his plate and went back for seconds! Highly recommend this recipe to everyone!

mmmmmmm, we thought this recipe was srumptious! i used real chicken tenders (instead of slicing a boneless breast) & whole milk. the subtle tarragon flavor along with a nutty breading are also nice features. this dish served well with corn on the cob & potato salad. thank you dusty!

I just made this for lunch and it was delicious! I substituted 1 cup of fat free half and half for the milk and since I had egg beaters, I used 1/4 cup of those instead of the egg. I also dipped half of the tenders twice in the two mixtures because I had so much left over and they were really crunchy and very good as well. Thanks for the great easy recipe, Dusty!

I found it necessary to at least double the tarragon for the flavor I was looking for but otherwise an excellent recipe and quite easy.

Good, but needs a little something, so I made a milk gravy from the frying oil and the little bit of flour mixture that was left. Y'all. Do that. Seriously.

I used my moule to grind up the walnuts, and I think the size was too small because the taste of the walnuts pretty much got lost in the flour (maybe there was too much flour for this?).  I followed the recipe exactly, and it made for a nice dinner, but our leftovers really didn't cut it.  I will try this again but make the changes that I have written about.  Thanks for the idea!

This is the best chicken tender recipe I have ever made. My husband, and two teenaged kids loved them. The tenders came out most and had a good crunch. I used cashews instead of walnuts, cause that's what I had in the pantry.

This is a delicious change to regular chicken tenders.  I use boneless skinless thighs too, a huge hit with my young son AND me!

This recipe was good but next time instead of using cow's milk I'd substitute almond milk and possibly crushed almonds and almond flour for the breading. I liked the subtle tarragon flavor blended with the nutty flavor. It's a keeper!

I never really think about using tarragon in recipes, but this was perfect! I tried to health-ify the recipe a little by cutting out the butter and frying in olive oil instead of vegetable, and the flavor was wonderful! A great recipe. Thank you for sharing!

Awesome recipe!! I love it when fabulous cooks enhance my repertoire of cooking--especially chicken!  We all just loved the nutty flavor combo of the walnuts and tarragon. Who ever thinks of tarragon when seasoning food? I do now! Here's what I did to make the recipe more heart-healthy:  used spelt flour, walnut oil and fresh tarragon. Also used lowfat milk. This is a keeper and will definitely make it again!

Pretty good, didn't change anything.  One dipped it in honey, another in ketchup.....another in nothing and said he'd like a good dip to go with it.  So, now to find a good dip to go with it....

Great recipe!  I used frozen grilled chicken strips which I cooked according to the package instructions (3 minutes in the microwave).  It made frying the chicken much easier as I already knew the chicken was cooked.

i love to cook and its hard sometimes to find simple simple things like these.i made these with pork chops and a rasberry sauce for my girl. she loved it, but then again she always does. but seriously they were great. i added extra walnuts to mine. other than that keep it just the same.
