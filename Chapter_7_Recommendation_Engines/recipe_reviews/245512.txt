This recipe gets 5 stars for flavor, but only 3 stars for ease of following the recipe and actually making the dish.  First there is no way to simmer that many vegetables in that much milk and have everything cook evenly.  I left out the parsnips and turnips and still had more than 12 cups of cubed veggies.  I ended up simmering the veggies in two batches and then straining off the liquid to mix in the cream cheese so I didn't pulverize the veggies trying to get a smooth sauce.  Then carefully folded the cheese sauce back into the veggie mix.  If it hadn't tasted SO good I would never bother trying to work out the kinks, but I'm sure I'll be attempting this again.

Make sure you have about 8 overflowing cups of vegetables so the end result will not be too runny and let stand before serving.
