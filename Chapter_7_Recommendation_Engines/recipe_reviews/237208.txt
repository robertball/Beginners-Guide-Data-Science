I was looking forward to a good healthy treat, but found these to be very bland.  I love lemon, but didn't think the lemon flavor really came through enough.  IF I make them again, I probably would use almond extract instead of the lemon extract and zest, add some sliced almonds and chopped tart cherries to give this some zip.

The texture was very strange...less like a bar and more like a baked oatmeal. However, it tasted delicious. I enjoyed the lemon. If you think of it like a baked oatmeal instead of an oat bar, then it is great.

The texture is slightly odd BUT, the taste is nice- love that lemon!  (Didn't have lemon extract so just went overboard with the zest).  I think this is a basic, healthy breakfast bar that can be used as a starting place for your individual likes/dislikes.  I added 1/4 cup chopped walnuts to increase protein and I added 1/4 cup chopped prunes to increase potassium.  I used maple syrup since I didn't have honey.  Thanks Punkim 30 for sharing.

This recipe is yummy very similar to lemon poppy seed muffins in taste. We used Lyle's golden syrup in lieu of agave nectar and I almost guarantee you'd like this version better but I can also assume the calories are slightly more

This was good! I didn't have agave but I used the same amount of Grade B real maple syrup instead.  Just the right amount of moistness. A lot of gluten free or dairy free baked goods are too dry or else dense.  The oats and chia seeds make it a nice texture.

I don't have any allergies/sensitivities to consider but I enjoy the creativity of allergen-avoiding and vegan cuisines. The texture will be familiar to those of us who have used gelatinized chia and/or flax seeds as an egg substitute. I added some sunflower seeds and dried cherries to up the nutrients. The cherries overpowered the lemon a bit so I would recommend something milder if you want the lemon to really come through. I didn't have any agave syrup but they were still plenty sweet from the honey. Only drawback was my not-so-picky toddler wouldn't finish her slice. More for me!

I like it.  I keep it in the freezer, and so the gummy texture isn't so bad when frozen. When I made it, I didn't have lemon extract, so I used fresh lemon juice, as well, I used olive oil instead of canola.  Good recipe.
