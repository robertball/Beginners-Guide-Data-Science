This is good for a basic slider but the true secret to a Super Slider is putting a dollop (approx. 1/2 tbsp) of butter in the center of the patty before cooking.  I also season mine with McCormick Grill Mates Montreal Steak Seasoning instead of just salt & pepper.  Use King's Hawaiian Sweet Rolls for your buns, you won't regret it!

These were a hit, and it was the 'secret sauce' that put these over the top! I toasted the buns and added a little cheese. I plan to make these again, and I'll be using the sauce often~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Love the sauce!  I used dill relish instead of sweet.  I added a tablespoon of minced garlic and a dash of dale sauce and a pkg of lipton onion soup mix to the hamburger.  Then reshaped it so I could cut it into 8 even pieces.  I'll have to make more of the sauce next time because we used it to dip our fries too!  We like our burger done completely and it took significantly longer than 4 minutes on each side.  I used a thermometer to tell when they hit 165 degrees.  This was perfect for our family.

I always love Chef John's recipes so I thought I would use ths one as a jumping off point. I decided I wanted to kick it up a notch. I substituted Johnsonville Italian sausage for the ground beef.Topped it with provolone. I sauteed some mini bell peppers for my topper. I also mixed diced sundried tomatoes into mayo for my secret sauce. My hubby says they are the best sliders he has ever had.

awesome!  the sauce is great too.   but I divided the meat and put it into cheap baggies to press into patties; no mess that way.  They're thinner and cook faster.  Easier to eat too, don't have to unhinge your jaw to bite it. "and as always, enjoy!"

We thought these were fantastic burgers. I know this sounds like a standard recipe but it is so much better for reasons I cannot explain. I used kosher salt and freshly ground pepper and subbed the tomato for chipotle bread & butter pickle since it's what I had on hand. I have been making burgers for years with these same ingredients but there is something special in here that makes these great. I made a comment while eating how good these were and my husband said, "I was just going to say that". The 3 minute time was was too rare for me but my husband liked them. I cooked mine a little longer. Maybe it was the special sauce, maybe it was the hotter pan than I usually use, but do try this. Thanks Chef John! These were fantastic.

Great base recipe, but I needed more flavor.  So I made a few simple changes:
First: I seasoned my beef before cooking by adding chopped garlic.
Second: I added one part Blazin' Burger seasoning to the dressing.
Third: I used Hawaiian Sweet Bread dinner rolls, and topped each burger with a small piece of pineapple, and a slice of jalapeno.
*Alternative dressing is sweet chili sauce; adjusting the heat with hot pepper flakes.
This was 'ONO (which means DELICIOUS in Hawaiian)!!

I followed the method of using a muffin pan to make the patties, but used a large muffin size (6 cup pan) instead of regular size.  I prepared the beef using the Juiciest Hamburgers Ever recipe.  2 pounds of beef made 28 mini-burgers to put on Hawaiian rolls (24-pk), using 2 mini cookie dough scoops each so all were the same size, cooked them for 4-5 min per side, and topped with a slice of manchego cheese and black forest ham, a slice of tomato and the secret sauce, yum!  We all loved these, thank you Chef!

I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and these were AMAZING!! I added a little Montreal Steak Seasoning to the salt and pepper, added just a small amount of butter to the middle of each burger, used Hawaiian buns and broiled them just a bit. The sauce was great too. My son said this made it in his top 5 favorite dinners list. Will definitely make these again!

I used ground venison instead of beef and added a little marinated artichoke juice and a dash of dill weed to the sauce because I didn't have pickle relish on hand. I was worried that the venison would make the burgers unappealing, but, to my delight, my family (of 11) gobbled them up and asked more! They especially enjoyed the sauce---thanks so much for this recipe!

These were great, and my family loved them! I added shredded mexican cheese and a teaspoon of seasoned salt to the ground beef mixture. The muffin liner trick really made the sliders uniform, and my husband cooked them on the grill.

We've made these quite a few times, and they are a big hit in our house.

One note of caution -- these are fat little burgers, and you need to take care to strike the right balance between making sure the middle is cooked, while not burning the exterior. We learned the hard way that the suggested times shown in the recipe do not work, producing near-raw interiors and charcoal-like exteriors.

Here is where we have settled: The recipe calls for medium-high heat, but we go with medium-low (a 3 setting on our stove-top). We also put a fair amount of butter in the skillet at the beginning and, during the initial fry, push a metal spatula underneath the sliders to prevent sticking to the pan. 

Some people consider it sacrilege to flip a burger more than once, but we flip these multiple times to avoid burning. We start at four minutes per side, then two-and-a-half minutes per side, then one minute thirty seconds, and finally one minute (which is when we add the cheese). The result is sliders cooked medium/medium-well (adjust times as needed if you prefer them more rare).

A bit of effort, but it works for us and strikes that balance we're going for. 

We serve on Martin's Potato Rolls, grilled in butter. Yum!

Loved the slider idea, and the sauce was good but would never be enough for 8 sliders.  It was good but needed something.

I think thèse were gréât. Chef John's méthod for measuring the méat by using a muffin tin is  a gréât idea.  Sometimes having a "slider" size burger is just enough.

Meh. Nothing special. The burgers tasted really bland and plain. More seasoning is needed. The sauce was just ok to us. I do like many other recipes from this chef though so it's ok.

Easy to make and very tasty.  I added some ingredients to the beef - Worstershire and Montreal steak seasoning and added mini slices of cheese.  Buttered the buns and toasted those as well.  I would add even more seasoning the next time.  Everyone loved the recipe though.   The sauce tasted weird by itself but good on the burger and that's what counts.

These are quite tasty! Used a seasoning spice instead of  salt and pepper; added diced onions on top of the sauce on the buns; and, diced dill pickles in place of the relish, as dh doesn't care for sweet pickles.  Served on Hawaiian rolls.  Thanks again chef John!

I saved this for the sauce. I don't make burgers or sliders using beef.

I season with McCormick Montreal Seasoning, but otherwise Chef John gets this right on point! Kudos!

Amazing sliders!  This is the first time I made sliders and this recipe was easy and delicious!  I added a slice of sharp cheddar cheese and a slice of a bread and butter pickle!  The flavor was amazing.  Chef John is the best!  I would recommend any of his recipes.

Loved the sauce! Used a couple of bread and butter pickles since I was out of relish. Made clean up easier by putting ground beef in a sandwich size ziplock bag and reusing to press out patties. Served on Pepperidge Farms slider buns with seasoned fries from this site. Very good!

Followed it exactly and the idea about using the muffin tin was great. Put siracha mayo on mine!

Very good.  Used suggestion by jhillhouse for adding a dollup of butter.
