I make this dish often and like any recipe there are always variations depending who is making it. Its probably the easiest meal that you could prepare but it relies on the cooks judgement to get it right. When cooking Italian i have never measured anything because I know when its just right or if it needs more, firstly I only use spaghetti or linguine, I would add more garlic at least two or three cloves and I would add extra virgin olive oil straight to the pasta after its been drained. I would of course add a touch of oil to cook the garlic then add to the pasta. This is a matter of personal preference but I add a liberal amount of shredded parmasan cheese not just a sprinkle. Do not use romano cheese as it flavour is milder and is more suited to soups and stews. This dish is one of my personal favourites as its easy and healthy comfort food.

This is one wonderful dish. You can embellish it all you want just like you can put all kinds of stuff on vanilla ice cream. But you don't really improve it. You just make it different. The only thing I would add is just to remind you that garlic loses its strength (I did use more) when it is cooked and so does olive oil. So, I used a minimal amount of olive oil for very lightly browning the garlic so I could add more straight from the bottle in the finished dish. To me, this is a treasure of a dish. Thank you, thank you.

Delicious! The aroma is fantastic, the taste, yummy!  To the person who did not know how to measure out 1 1/2 lb spaghetti, just buy 2 16 oz boxes, use one whole box and 1/2 of the other.

Great side.  Thanks for the recipe.  I'm sorry but, if you don't know how to measure 1 1/2 lbs. of pasta perhaps cooking is not your forte.

I tinkered a bit with this recipe and was pleasantly surprised.  I've been looking for side dishes which are lighter in calories and fat. Here's what I did.  I boiled a 1 lb. pkg of Angel Hair Pasta, drained and tossed with 1 tbsp extra Virgin Olive Oil - so it wouldn't stick, sauteed 1 diced cherry pepper, a heaping tbsp of minced garlic in 2 Tbsp. Olive Oil, then I drained and chopped a 6 oz. jar of marinated Artichoke Hearts, tossed it around in a bowl with the parmesan cheese. I served this along side some oven-roasted brocoli florets and grilled Lemon Pepper Chicken for a tasty, healthy meal - Do try it with the chopped Artichoke Hearts ...Yum!

This recipe was disapointing.  First off, I have no idea how to measure 1 1/2 pounds of pasta.   Was it dry or cooked, I don't know.  So maybe that's why it turned out flavorless, I didn't do the measurments right.  Who knows?  But it wasn't very good.  Shucks!

I really like this recipe. However, I tinkered with it a bit to make it into a main dish. I used 1/4c Extra Virgin Olive Oil to sautee onion and garlic. Then, added 1/4c water and cut up some Asparagus and cooked till firm. Then added some Angel Hair Pasta and a little bit more Extra Virgin Olive Oil and salt and pepper to taste. And it turned out wonderful!!! I like to measure by my personal tastes tho. Thanks for the share.

Good basic pasta side. I used whole wheat pasta, half EVOO/half melted butter and tossed some roasted broccoli in with it. This went well with the Balsamic Marinated Chicken Breast. I used a quality grated Parmesan Cheese, which I think makes all the difference.

We loved this recipe.  Again, personal preferences... I added extra parm cheese and garlic. Also added a tad of butter for a little creaminess.  This is kind of a mock alfredo.  Very delicious and quick.  All of these measurements can be tweaked to your liking with the same delicious result.  Thanks!

Nice!  Simple and delicious.  I made this with fresh pasta.   I also added fresh spinach to the garlic and oil and cooked it until soft then added it to the past.

I used far, far more garlic than called for, and my husband and I both thought it was still pretty bland. I guess we like stronger flavors than some. I'll add more Parmesan and other seasonings next time. Maybe parsley.

A little bland, but I wasn't very careful with the recipe-- I don't think I had a pound and a half of pasta (I just used one box of spaghetti), so I mostly winged the amount of the rest of the ingredients.

Would definitely add more garlic and more parmesan next time-- but I was very light on the parmesan. I also added mushrooms, for the record, and found that it was nice to have another texture in with the noodles.

I make this recipe all the time; the trick is to add up to one cup of the pasta water to the pasta.  The pasta then is not so dry.  Use more extra virgin OO and much more garlic.  Now....that's Italian!!!

The first time i tried cooking the garlic, right when i put the garlic into the boiling olive oil, it burned right away. We put 2 cloves of garlic in even though it said to put one clove, but when we ate the pasta we couldnt really taste the garlic at all, and the pasta was WAY TO salty.

Quick and tasty.  I jazzed it up.  I added onions and wayy more garlic (8 cloves) fried up in the Olive oil.  Once the garlic was cooked, before it browns, added a half cup of white wine, salt and pepper.  Simmered that for an additional 4 minutes.

This is a good side dish.  I would not make this as an entree unless you are adding chicken or veggies.  Very easy to make.  Nice light flavor.  Would make this again when I feel the need for pasta!

When I make this I like to almost fry the pasta in the oil.  I also add a little butter and just before I am done I add the minced garlic and a minute or two later I add shredded parmsean cheese.  YUMMY!!!!

Cold weather can make you do funny things. For instance, grocery shopping; how does one forget to go grocery shopping? Apparently, I do. With a high of -16 degrees today in CHI-BERIA, I was in no mood to go out to the store, so rummaging through my cabinet, I found some pasta. We always have a jar of garlic in the fridge, so I figured I'd make a quick pasta dish to fill my belly. This recipe, while basic, is the perfect starting point to let your creativity flow. I added crushed red pepper flakes for a bit of heat. Some chicken, shrimp, veggies, etc would also be a great addition.

Very good. I used bowtie pasta which really pleased the hubby. He loved this dish quite a bit. I didn't care for the olive oil flavor and would have preferred butter but he loved it. It could have used more garlic to suit me better and a little crushed red pepper or cayenne too. This was a great side with parmesan chicken. Thanks Josie.

Wonderful!  I made this along with some veal for Valentine's dinner with hubby.  I used 3 large cloves garlic and I used refrigerated linguini.  Delicious!  The perfect side dish with our meal.  Thanks for posting the recipe Josie, I plan to make it again.

I make this a full meal by adding partially cooked diced turkey sausage and blanched broccoli to the pan when sauteing the garlic. I use 4 cloves of garlic instead of only one. I have made this several times, but I often use whatever shredded cheese I have on hand as a topping. Overall, a very good dish!

Hubby made this for dinner tonight with italian marinated chicken sauteed in olive oil. He used garlic powder and only one pound of pasta. This was a tad bland, but heck, based on the ingredients I really couldn't expect more. He also made garlic toast, pretty much not expecting visitors to stay long here with the garlic smell ;-)

For those who have said its bland..... Try cooking the pasta in chicken broth for a little more flavor.  I put the roasted chicken  "Better than Bouillon" in mine.

This is a very simple and delicious recipe. Goes well with Mediterranean Lemon Chicken from this website. I added a bit more garlic and a bit extra oil when I mixed the ingredients. Also added a tid bit of Parmesan until it started to be a bit creamy.

Excellent, healthy, easy and fast pasta to make.  I used 3 or 4 cloves of garlic instead of 1 and topped it off each dish with a handful of green onions chopped to add a bit of texture and flavor.

I did make changes to this recipe, I added diced onion, mushrooms, cherry tomatoes and spinach, it was delicious.  What I did not add was the cheese, I forgot and it smelled so good I could hardly wait to sit down and eat.  I will be making this again because it was so easy to do.  I served it with baked boneless chicken thighs with a seasoned panko crust.

My favorite weeknight side dish. I amp up the garlic a lot through.  I use 4-6 cloves chopped not quite minced.  It goes great with boneless skinless chicken this that have just been salt and peppered.

When I first read this recipe that seemed like way too much oil, but after it dawned on me how much pasta was called for it made more sense. After scaling down the servings it's not too much oil at all. Of course, I used a lot more garlic, three humungous cloves. A great side for all kinds of meals. I served it with Sicilian Olive Chicken also on this site.

I add 3 or more cloves of garlic bc I love love love garlic. One thing I'd note is to make sure you salt and pepper to taste when you've mixed the pasta and oil together otherwise you may not have enough.

* add red flakes for some extra taste = amazing

it 's a very Italian dish that I made several times , even if I usually don't care for  . You must be sure to have enough virgin olive oil ,pepper, and enough garlic and grated cheese for this dish. I also add sometimes a spoon of sweet butter and 2 full spoons of fresh tender peas ...( but not many...) By the way, another great pasta-dish which you don't have in your link (but you should have ..)it is , a pasta-dish that my mother used to make all the time in Italy when I was a girl ....Too bad you don't have this recipe dish ! I make it for my Norwegian husband who loves pasta dishes much more than I do....I will send you the Norma Dish recipe if you will ask for it.... SILVANA / USA

i think what helps is to boil the pasta with a teaspoon of salt aside from the oil (to prevent it from sticking). Also, put some of the garlic (1-2 tablespoons) on the shrimp with a tablespoon of lemon juice and set it aside so it will add flavor to the shrimp. you can do this before you start boiling the pasta so the flavor will stick. when the pasta is almost done, start working on the garlic. after you saute the garlic (once it's light brown, add the shrimp mixture in and put in the cooked pasta. :)

The pasta shape really does matter.  I would use spaghetti or thin spaghetti next time.  My husband and I ordered this in a restaurant once and that is what they used.  I made it this time with fettuccini and it may sound silly but it made a difference in the taste.  I bake it with mozzarella cheese on top after also.

This is a great "starter" recipe.  Once I finished cooking the pasta, I added a bit of olive oil to prevent it from sticking. I also used 2 cloves of minced garlic, 1/2 minced onion and some sliced mushrooms. Only added enough oil to sautee the veggies. Added the Parmesan cheese right before serving. It came out delicious.  Definitely a keeper!

Really good, simple recipe.  Like others, I used more garlic (4 cloves) since I love garlic.  Also, I used 1 lb (not 1 1/2 lb.) farfalle pasta instead.   Really good recipe for a quick, tasty meal.

I'm not the best a making pasta so I tried to find a recipe the was simply. My family and I are garlic lovers so this seemed perfect. I did use garlic salt as well just so I was I didn't under-season. Another thing I did was put some garlic shrimp in as well.

I added 1/3 of a cup of the pasta water back to the pasta to make it a tad saucier. It was much better this way. Still a good recipe.

I make this quite often.. I have to admit I take Olive oil and butter and simmer cloves of garlic in it.  Then pour it all over my pasta with salt, pepper and Parmesan Cheese. If you feel it needs more garlic you can always add some garlic salt or powder to it.  YUMMY!

When I make make I use about 10 cloves of garlic, when my grams makes it she uses about 6 or so. Depends on how much you like garlic. Saute the garlic in the hot oil just to bring out that aroma and toss over the pasta.

We Made this, and since all other reviews said the flavour was really bland so we looked at other garlic and pasta recipes and we just added more spices, thats all you have to do to make the taste better. also add way more parmesan cheese

I was so happy to have found this!  It is super easy and amazingly delicious.  I've been using the packets and boxes of sides but the ingredients were less than desirable.  This makes me know I'm feeding my family the best, simple but tasty food.  Anything in a box or packet can be made simpler, cheaper and a whole lot healthier.  Thank you!  I sometimes add fresh herbs if I have them.  Basil, parsley, chives, thyme and rosemary.  

PS looking forward to more recipes.

Great!  As others suggested I added extra garlic and I did use some butter to make it more thick/alfredo-ish.  A very versatile recipe. Thanks.

This was not a good recipe. I did everything exactly the way that it told me to, and still when I served it everyone complained that it tasted like regular pasta. So I added some of the oil that the garlic had cooked in to see if that would help but it didn't. After that, I was led to grind garlic salt on it but then the texture turned out all grainy and everything

Loved this recipe. I added half cup of green peas and 3-4 rashers of bacon (chopped and fried) to please my meat loving husband. I like to idea of infusing the garlic in the oil. A great recipe becomes a favourite recipe.

I tried this without modifying it. It was really plain and the garlic pieces were the best part. I don't know why, but it was just very bland for me. I added salt, pepper and parmesan just as it said, to taste, but it doesn't help. I expected it to taste more like the boxed kind of Garlic and Olive Oil pasta which is what I wanted, but it doesn't at all taste like it. It's good, just not very exciting.

Been making this for years but use Asiago cheese, top with chopped "fresh" parsley" use pure (no cheap blends) olive oil from Sicily. If you want great taste then buy where Italians buy. Cheap supermarket substitutes won't get it done. Terrific and simple dish with marvelous taste but requires spending a few extra cents to do it right.

This is a simple recipe, and a great base. I liked that it was light on the olive oil; I don't like too much of its strong flavor in my dishes. We did feel that it needed more garlic, though!

I made this dish for the first time tonight and it was delicious! I used about 0.75 lb of past and a little less than 0.25 cup of olive oil with 3 garlic cloves. Next time I'll have it with some steamed vegetables for a balanced meal!

This is super easy and quite tasty. I am a big garlic person, so I added a bit more garlic. The also added 1/4 cup of cream cheese and 1/4 of heavy cream. As I said, quite tasty and super easy!

Great start but it definitely needs more to it. I used 4 cloves of garlic but think I will use 5 next time. I also added tomatoes, asparagus, and parsley. Super delicious!
