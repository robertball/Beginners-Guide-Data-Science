The chili sauce I referred to in the recipe comes in a bottle like ketchup and it's called "Chili Sauce."  It's a really tasty sauce, not as tomato-ey as ketchup with lots of spices in it.  It is not hot at all!  Sorry about the misunderstanding or my not identifying it clearly enough.

This is very good and very easy.  Short ribs are always very greasy, so I do recommend cooking it early, refrigerating, and skimming the fat.  I used this as the meat in a taco which I topped with some coleslaw.  It was very good.
I saved the "gravy" last night along with the leftover meat.  Today (after removing the fat from the gravy), I added some vegetables to the meat, sprinkled it with flour for thickening, stirred the gravy in, topped it with a pie crust and made a fantastic meat pie.  This is a very good and versatile recipe.

My goodness!  These were delicious, easy, and foolproof!  It's not often you can get away with so few ingredients and so little work and have it turn out THIS great.  Thanks for the fantastic recipe. I made it exactly as written. I'll be watching for sales on short ribs from now on, you can bet.

I followed the recipe and these are so good. Easy to put together and tasted delicious. I cooked on low for 10 hours which was a bit too long. I would do 8 hours maximum for my slow cooker.  The sauce was really good and next time I’ll serve them with something I can use the extra sauce on. 

UPDATE: I wanted to make this and I was sure I had both chili sauce and french onion soup but I had neither and I really wanted this dish so I made my own. This is how I made the chili sauce. 
1 cup tomato sauce
1/4 cup dark brown sugar
3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
1/4 teaspoon allspice
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes  
and for the french onion soup I used 10 oz of beef broth and mixed in a couple tbsp dried minced onion and 1 tbsp worcestershire sauce. When it was all cooked I thickened the sauce with 2 tbsp cornstarch mixed in 2 tbsp water. This sauce was just as good as the bought chili sauce and soup. I would do this again.

I wish the recipe contributor would specify what she means when calling for 'chili sauce.' Since we didn't have any on hand, I thought I might use Chinese restaurant packets of "chili sauce." LOL! I squeezed one packet only and stopped, because I tasted a drop of it and my mouth was burning like mad! Certainly the Panda Express type of chili sauce wouldn't be right for this recipe. I couldn't imagine dumping 12 oz of THAT on this dish, EVER. LOL!
I followed the recipe, but added half an envelope of dry onion soup mix, in addition to the canned. Also, added minced garlic, and about 1c. beef broth in order to cover the meat. I don't eat ribs; I made them for my husband and he said they were excellent with some bbq sauce added at the table. Will use this recipe if I let him have ribs again. I cried when I saw the ugly hard grease that cooled and covered everything --- this is bad for anyone with cholesterol issues. All in all I give this recipe a thumbs up!

The ribs  were perfect at 8 hours but the sauce was just so-so. Too sweet for my taste anyway. Thanks for the recipe:-)

Made this just as described and it was wonderful---my 17 year old son said it was the best meal he had eaten in a long time.  (we paired it with some pretty special mashed potatoes).  I thought these few ingredients would not be enough to give a big boost of flavor but I was wrong.  Loved it and making again next week for company.

I was not impressed.  Not with all the five star reviews. I added adobo and sazon to it because it had no flavor.  Meet was tender.  But besides that, not impress at all.

Very simple and easy recipe. The only change I made was to brown the ribs in a pan with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and olive oil before adding them to the crockpot. Then it’s simply a matter of leaving them to cook in the pot for six hours or so, turning every once in a while, and shredding with a fork at the end.

This was soooooo good! I didn’t have rosemary so I added Penzey’s beef roast spices and also added some mushrooms. Will definitely make this again!

What a great and easy recipe to follow. Short ribs came out fork tender and delicious. Gravy had a mild barbecue taste and was good over mashed potatoes. Follow this recipe to the letter except watch time you cook in the slow cooker as mine were done in about six hours. Thanks again for a great recipe that I know I’ll fall back on time and again!

The sauce was delicious, but if I made it again I'd use boneless ribs.

I thought this would be pretty good but I really didn't anticipate how good this would be!  Go heavy on the rosemary and go for 10 hours. You'll love it!

I didn't make any changes and these ribs were delicious!  However, these beef ribs are a lot fattier than pork ribs so I boiled them for an hour, which was probably not long enough.  Then I put them in the oven at 350 for 3 1/2 hours but they were still really fatty.  They tasted really good but I probably won't make them again because of the fat.

GREAT! I used a chuck roast instead of short ribs since the ribs were pretty expensive.  I seasoned  the meat with S&P and garlic and browned the roast in olive oil before I put it in the crockpot 
So easy!  Will make it again

I had some short ribs in the freezer that I needed to use and was looking looking for a simple recipe.  This was both simple and delicious- will definitely make it again.  The only change I made was to use dry onion soup mix, to which I added ten ounces of water.

Made this for dinner with friends.  Rave reviews!  I couldn't believe how quick and easy it is to make.  However, there was alot of fat floating on top, but I skimmed most of it off prior to serving.  If I have time next time, I might parboil the ribs for 30 minutes or so to cut down on the fat.
