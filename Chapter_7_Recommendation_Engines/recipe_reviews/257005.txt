I had some already cooked chicken so that saved time , I didn't have corn so I added peas just for a vegetable.  I also only had small bags of tortillas and used both ranch and nacho cheese and boy was it good.  My husband even took some to work today which rarely happens.  I will definitely keep this recipe and make it again.

I didnâ€™t have pinto beans or plain green chilies, but I substituted tomatoes with diced green chilies. Will definitely make again!
