I liked this! I rarely cook with mustard greens so wanted to try something new. The recipe was simple and flavorful. Thanks, T.J.!

I didn't add the sesame oil used grapeseed oil(what I already had). Didn't use ginger honey or wine. Put more than 1/3 cup of chk broth. More like put 1 c. Remember the greens(if just rinsed) will add liquid. I also cook the chk for more than stated. Wanted to be sure it was done. Over all it took me est. 30mins to cook. It turn out ok.

I made this recipe but I also added spinach and served it on a bed of jasmine white rice.
