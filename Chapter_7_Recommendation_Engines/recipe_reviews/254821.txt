Made it this evening for my husband and me. I didn't have any curry powder or great garlic so I used some chili powder and garlic powder instead. It was delicious!

I think this turned out well! I did not freeze it, I did fresh. I cooked it on high heat in a crock pot and it was done (but not over done) in about 3.5 hours. I think the only thing it could've used was some crushed red pepper to give it a little kick.

Slight tweaks: 3 cloves garlic 2 tbs apple cider vinegar 1 cup of onions more fresh ginger grated a few shakes of chipotle Tabasco. I partially microwave defrosted frozen chicken and didn t freeze ingredients together prior to cooking. First 4 hours on high next 4 on low. Sides were braised cabbage and couscous with green chilies mixed in. Delicious!

Not impressed. Put the chicken in frozen but all other ingredients fresh. Cooked on low for the full recommended time as I was at work. Way too mushy for my taste.

I haven't made this yet. The picture shows diced apples but there are no apples in the recipe only applesauce.

I really enjoyed this. Very flavorful. My wife and I both said it needs to be spicy lol as it has a very Indian flavor with the curry. Next time I will probably add some cayenne and other chilies to add some kick.

I might try this recipe again in the future but without the apple cider vinegar. As it stands this recipe was a huge miss with my family.

My husband and I really enjoyed this. We did not freeze it before and cooked on low less time but the potatoes did get too soft. I ll try it again with freezing it first and using as a freezer crockpot meal so hopefully it won t get too soft. I will also try adding cut apples towards the end but the flavors were excellent and we will make it again.

This was OK. It was simple to put together but it may need less time in the crock pot. I did not freeze mine first just put it all in there fresh. The sweet potatoes got really mushy and I didn't enjoy that texture. I had mine in for about 6 hours. Overall I just didn't find it all that flavorful.

Easy to make and sounds tasty but not husband or child approved in this house:( I thought it was so-so. My daughter told me "never make this again " I don't take it personally:)
