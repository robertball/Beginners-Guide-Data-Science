Was a good recipe. Before rolling, I sprinkled the meat with some lime juice and sweet chili sauce, and added some cilantro. I also made it with ground organic chicken meat rather than turkey.

I would recommend using only 3/4 the onion. The mint was great in the meat, but not on.  Using lettuce as the wrap instead of the tortilla was much better.  I also sprinkled chow mein noodles on top before wrapping it up (to get a crunch).  1-2 Tsps of ginger in the meat was also good, but not needed.  I made it for a group of friends as we sat around and caught up- Everyone loved it and it was a nice change for the group!

Enjoyed this dish very much.  We didn’t nec change the recipe but we did double the amount of peanut sauce made (2 cups instead of 1 cup).  Adding 1 whole cup at first.  Definitely will be making this again.

Yum! I added a couple things per other comments. I also added in 1/2 cup grated carrot, which added a little flavor, nutrition, and color.

I made this last night for dinner and was happily surprised by how good it was. Healthy and delicious with such great flavor. The only thing I didn't use was the peanut oil (I didn't have any). It was a little juicy/messy but still tasty. Overall the dish is fresh and light, a great way to welcome spring. I will be making this again and again.

This was delicious and so fast and easy on a work night. Son loved it, too. I, uncharacteristically, did not read any of the reviews because I was pressed for time but I must admit to the following modifications (which I highly recommend). Used only 1/4 of a large sweet onion, added 2 T smooth peanut butter and 2 T water (coconut milk would be even better if you had some already opened). Do not recommend heating the cucumber and mint (personal choice), add shredded carrot and chopped cilantro on top of the lettuce before wrapping it up. Serve it with the sauce in the recipe or seasoned rice vinegar (we found we especially like it with seasoned rice vinegar). Super!

This recipe was fabulous! I did not use the mint, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly. The only exception is that I didn't have any satay sauce so I used this recipe (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/satay-sauce/) and made my own. My family loved it and looks forward to me making it again.

This recipe is super easy and really delicious. I didn't add the mint and cooked the meat and onions in toasted sesame oil instead. It was a massive hit with my hubby. I will certainly make this again soon!

A good idea, but the flavors are too strong that they don't mingle as much as they clash.

"It's a keeper, mom!" This comment was from my daughter and husband when having this for the first time. Made as suggested except used whole wheat tortillas and added a little cilantro. Perfect for fresh-from-the-garden lettuce, spearmint and cilantro. Little bit of kick was just right.

I gave this 4 stars which is pretty darned good. I've had this a few times now and really enjoy it. It's easy to make and you can get a little creative with it. Tonight I used fresh spinach + garlic flowers + fresh mint for the 'lettuce' stuffing. Really yummy. I think I like it best when there is mint in both the meat and lettuce mixtures. The peanut sauce is wonderful - don't skimp on that. Enjoy.

I was nervous about this one as it had to follow lunch at a Sushi Bar. It was a nice lite dinner, perfect for the day.

This was excellent! I added almost a tablespoon of ground ginger just because I love ginger. :) This was very flavorful, will definitely make again.

This was really good! I used the sweet chili sauce instead of the peanut sauce because the store didn't have it and it was delicious! I didn't use the mint because it seems out of place, but everything else I did just as the recipe states. Loved it and so did my husband!

Yummy! A nice change for a quick weekday meal. I added garlic to the turkey near the end of cooking, omitted the flour tortilla and used butter lettuce leaves as wraps, and sliced up some green onions and red peppers that I had on hand along with the mint leaves for toppings. Will make again!

Followed the recipe with a homemade satay sauce. Found it too bland. Too bad because it was easy. Won’t make it again.

Tasty and easy, and something different to make with ground turkey; just really high in sodium; I will try to make my own peanut satay sauce to cut down on the sodium.  Tastes great without the dipping sauce.  Fresh cilantro and lime in addition to fresh cucumber and lettuce a delicious touch.  Did not cook cucumber.

Made the recipe as written with exception of: I used cilantro for mint, and kept cucumber out of meat mixture adding as a raw topping. I also added radish as topping.

Very good. I made some minor  alterations including using only half of onion and a 1/4 cup of Tsang peanut dipping instead of satay sauce. I served it with thin stripes of cucumber, carrot, mint leaves with a drizzle of the peanut dipping sauce on top on tortillas and some in Bibb lettuce leaves. The kids loved the meat wrapped up in tortillas.

This recipe was very good. I took a suggestion from one of the reviews and sprinkled the meat with some lime juice and sweet chili sauce and added cilantro. It perfected it. I also left out the mint leaves, I didn't think they would blend well with the other flavors in the dish. It might have been a little too much. Great spring dish, very delicious, and it's healthy. Can't go wrong there. Thanks for sharing.
