Awesome main dish salad. Changes I made: used penne instead of seashells, cheddar instead of swiss. I cubed the ham and cheese and added some diced sweet onion and salt and pepper. I also added garlic and wish I hadnt as it didnt seem to meld well with the other ingredients.

Great recipe, the basic sauce is superb and so easy, to play around with.  I added mixed veggies to mine (corn and peas) as well as yellow pepper.  Used red onions.  I didn't have four hours so I just prepared the sauce ahead of time and left in the fridge for about an hour and half, then mixed with pasta (used elbow macaroni) and the other ingredients and popped in the freezer for another half hour.  Had to double at the last minute because of unexpected guests. Everyone had seconds, including them.

I thought the flavor was good - mustardy, spicy (I actually used cayenne instead of paprika due to a previous comment), really flavorful. My only issue with this was that it is very heavy. Pasta, mayo, ham, cheese - it really needs some veggies to lighten it up a bit! I didn't feel that the cheese or ham added anything. The mayo was so flavorful that they were just there for texture. Next time, I'll make the dressing, but toss it with a pasta and veggie salad. Maybe tomatoes, broccoli, peppers, even cabbage. It needs something with a taste and texture that will stand up to, and compliment, the pasta & mayo.

I'm wondering if the folks who are finding this salad too dry aren't following the direction to toss it with 3/4 of the dressing, spread the rest over the top edge to edge, then cover tightly and chill at least 4 hours and preferably overnight.  The salad is not dry when you do this.  The dressing weeps a bit when you follow these directions exactly, and when you stir it up the next day (or after the chill) the dressing is slightly thinner and the salad isn't dry any more.  

I like this dressing -- don't skip the mustard or hot sauce, they are NOT overwhelming at all and they make the salad -- but I really prefer a pasta salad with a lot of veggies.  I made this for a group who really love PROTEIN in their pasta salads, but next time I make it for my family I'll probably try to substitute a lot of veggies for the meat and cheese.

I love this salad.  I often change it up, depending on what's on hand, but it's always a hit.  The sauce is wonderful, and I always make extra, as I tend to add more veggies(ie.; celery, carrot, bell pepper, tomato, cucumber).  I also sub the swiss for cheddar, because no one here will eat swiss.  Basically, this is an awesome base recipe to suit any liking.  Thanks.

This recipe is great!!!  The only thing I changed was I doubled the dressing, and instead of green onions, I cut a little bit of red onion very finely and 1 clove of garlic and put it in the dressing and let it sit for an hour in the fridge to blend the flavor before I put the dressing on.  I also put salt, pepper and onion powder into the dressing.  It was delicous!

I think it's great!  I absentmindedly used a full pound of pasta so I'm going to make a little more dressing.  I love spicy food so one of the things that turned me onto this salad was the pepper sauce, but I agree with some that it isn't enough.  When I first mixed up the dressing (even after 2 tsp) I could just barely sense the zing in it which is good if you are sharing it with people who might be sensitive to that.  But once I got the dressing mixed with the pasta I couldn't find the zing at all.  So I will definitely add even more hot sauce.  I did cube the cheese and I added some little grape tomatoes.  I like the flavor and adds a pop of color.  But I LOVE this!

Really good choice of ingredients.... but the dressing was not that spicy.... kinda bland.  I would probably recommend using a different dressing.... Alison's Pasta Salad on this site is awesome.  And maybe chunks of cheese, I used shredded.

It was a hit at the bachelorette pre-party potluck! I made this pasta salad with  male member shaped pasta - something I could never get away with if it wasn't all us girls! Everyone loved it. I used very little mayo because it's very thick with the sour cream but very easy to make. I made it again after with elbow pasta and my co-workers loved it at our office potluck. Definitely a potluck hit!

This recipe was the bomb!  My husband loes ham and swiss cheese and he ate this up in 2 days!  I loved the dressing!  I used cubes of swiss cheese and diced the ham. So different than the usual pasta salads!

I don't often make pasta salad, but this is so good I believe I will be making it more often!  I used the small pasta, sometimes called ditalini.  I also added 1 medium red pepper diced, and some diced celery, good crunchy-ness!

I am reviewing this recipe before I even begin making it.  Why???  Because 30+ years of cooking, baking and following my "nose"...as recipes develop in the kitchen...this one I know is going to taste good (as is) plus the ingredients make sense.  I will make the sauce first and adjust (if need be) as I go but before it goes into the pasta.  I will also make sure that the thawed, frozen peas are dried out before incorporating into the mix.  I, too, will probably add other veggies for the "crunch" and thoroughly dry them as well.  Sounds like a winner and I cannot wait to begin this one.  This dish is all about the sauce...

I have made this pasta salad for years with some variations...I crumble bacon in it, and also put in some diced bell peppers. (pref not the green ones..they are not as sweet) You can do so much with this recipe. Very tasty!

It was good.  I used it for a catering. I changed the cheese to gouda and didn't add the eggs.  The guest liked it.

I doubled the recipe for my tennis league after play dinner and all of it was eaten!  I followed the recipe but also added cherry tomatoes sliced in halves plus some celery.  I agree with one reviewer....why do you put part of the dressing only on the top?  I thought it was a bit dry so next time I will make more dressing.  Everyone seemed to like it though!

I thought it was ok, my husband liked it, my kids didn't (probably because of the mustard).  It was a smidge dry, but we like it that way - if you want it creamier, I'd increase the dressing by 1/2.  I made it with just peas, added dill, dried minced onion and garlic powder.    It would be good with tuna too - needs a splash of lemon juice or something to give it more zip.

I really liked this pasta! It tastes great, is very creamy, is easy to make, and everyone loves it - (as long as they don't know there's mustard in it!)I usually like pasta salad to be light and vinagrette-ish, but this was a nice change! We used cheddar instead of swiss, and added fresh ground pepper and a dash of garlic salt.

I am thoroughly enjoying this flavorful pasta salad!  I am a vegetarian so I substituted the ham with a non-meat hot dog cut up.  I did not have swiss cheese so I used Parmesan instead.  I also did not have any sour cream so I used ranch dressing.  Finally, I substituted red pepper flakes for the hot sauce.  My family LOVED it.  The flavors only improve with time!  This is a keeper!

Delightful pasta salad!  I left out the hot sauce and cut provolone into very thin strips because I was out of swiss, lol.  Whole family LOVED it.  I also used celery chopped fine and some bacon crumbles and garlic powder.  Hahah...I may have made a different salad huh?

I was expecting this to be a basic, average pasta salad.  I chose it because the mayonnaise was cut with sour cream, which I appreciate in any mayonnaise-based salad.  I figured I'd "doctor it up." But it turned out surprisingly better than I expected, and I can only think it was because of the hot sauce! Hubs' sensitive innards can't tolerate really HOT hot sauce, but there is one we buy on Beale Street in Memphis that we both love and he tolerates well.  I believe it made all the difference in the dressing - that, and the mustard.  I didn't add the ham, as I knew Hubs would prefer it in a sandwich, but some cooked, crumbled bacon made a fine and flavorful substitute.  I used cubed Cheddar rather than shredded Swiss and liked the color it provided. I only used half the amount of paprika called for and that was a good choice for me.  I liked the little bit of warmth in color it gave the salad, but I didn't want to taste it! Finally, so many different-shaped pastas would be appropriate for this, and since I didn't have small seashells I used orecchiette  (translates to "little ears").  Oh...I didn't bother with the last part of the directions, pouring only 3/4 of the dressing over the  pasta, etc. I just mixed it all in at once.  If it dries out a little it will be no problem to moisten it with a little half-and-half or milk.

This was my first pasta salad I ever made, and it was very good. After a few days it started to smell a little sour, so I suggest eating it up fairly fast. Plus, you could probably cut the recipe in half, it makes a lot.

I thought it was ok.  I omitted the eggs and paprika (did not have on hand)  I added carrots and cubes of cheddar and swiss cheese.  It seemed to be missing something.  I wish it was a little spicier.

I made this pasta salad last night to try to find more easy dishes that I can make to take to work with me.  This recipe makes a lot, so I can seperate it into single serving containers and take it to work with my all weekend!  This was so easy and so quick!!  It is delicious.

This was very good.  I ended up doubling the recipe but used 16 oz. of peas for the whole thing.  That was plenty!  I used sriracha for the hot sauce, a little garlic powder, and I mixed all of the sauce with spiral pasta and didn't bother with adding a 1/4 to the top.  Also, cube the swiss!  It's so much better that way.  Excellent recipe to play around with...I'm eating the leftovers right now :)

I did some major tweaking on this recipe. I have to say it was a good recipe to tweak though. Instead of frozen peas, I used diced red peppers and vidala onions diced very small. I did not use cheese either. I kept everything else. To the sauce, I added dill, parsley, salt and pepper and a little garlic and onion powder. I also added about an extra tsp. of dijon mustard. I love recipes I can modify to my likes and this was a good basis of a recipe.

Yummy!  

Changes I made...I used mini bowtie pasta instead of shells, I cubed my swiss, and I added celery for crunch. My eggs were frozen when I went to make this, so I had to omit the boiled egg-it was good without it, but I know I would like it even better with.

If you spread the remaining dressing on the top of the salad as directed, it doesn't turn out dry at all and is very creamy and flavorful.

Very good.
Alterations:
Did not have swiss cheese, onions, scallions, or frozen peas.  Substitutes: Pepperjack in moderation and parmesan.   Frozen corn for frozen peas, chives and dried onion for fresh onion and scallions.  Other, more paprika, parsley, shaved carrot, bacon bits and sliced black olives.  Lastly, less mayo and more sour cream.

The pasta salad was pretty good.  The flavor of the dressing was good but the salad overall was a little dry.  I doubled the ham and it still seemed a little short on the meat to me.  Seemed like it needed something else to make it all come together - maybe black olives or celery?  Couldn't really taste the swiss cheese much either - maybe if you put small chunks in instead of grating it.

I needed to go diary free, so I omitted the cheese and substituted the sour cream for miracle whip.  When served about 2 hours later, it was good, but the next day it was much better.  I used 3 green onions though, and the 1st day that was fine, but by the next day it was pretty strong so I'll only use 2 next time.  Overall, this was a good recipe and I will use it again, especially with summer coming up.

Not a favorite.  The family did not like the egg taste.  It did not have a good mix of ingredients.  We will not be eating this again.

I loved this pasta salad!  I made some small changes, not really changing the original too much.  I couldn't find 100% grated Swiss, and I really wanted to use Swiss because it is low in sodium compared to other cheeses,so I used Trader Joe's Swiss/Gruyere blend (yummy!) I doubled the ham to 4 ounces ( I couldn't  see using 2 with all the other ingredients! and I used Orecchiette Italian pasta which is the closest I could find to seashell.  This pasta sticks easily and I will definitely add oil to the water next time.  I didn't even wait the four hours required and ate it right away!  It was still delicious and I will definitely make this again.

Great Pasta salad.  I only used one salad dressing bottle and it was great like that.  I did add more of the vegetables than the recipe called for.  Initially I was thinking of doubling the recipe....but since reviewers had mentioned it made a huge batch I didn't.  Now I regret it, since unexpected fam stopped by for memorial day and none is left....

This was good and a change of pace for pasta salad. I used shrimp instead of ham and mozzarella instead of swiss, however, I did not see a need for the cheese. Tasty and will be in my box for a different pasta salad.

Not bad but not overly flavorful. I never did figure out why you put the layer of dressing over the top-it just sits there(I made the salad a day ahead). Before serving, I ended up mixing it all together. Glad I tried it but probably won't make again.

I loved the sauce as is but next time I will double it the pasta really soaked it up overnight. I used franks red hot and it wasn't spicy at all. We omitted ham and replaced it with shrimp. it really didn't need that either. And I used spiral instead of shells. Excellent. Next time I will leave meat our altogether and maybe use cubed cheese.

This is EXCELLENT!  I had to come up with something to take to party at the last minute.  I didn't have time to let it sit over night so I just left it in the fridge for 3 1/2 hours.  It was perfect.  There wasn't any left to bring home...

great go to salad for the summer. Accidentally switched the amounts of the mayo and sour cream, so I added a little more mustard and green onions and it was still a hit. Also forgot the ham, but it was still tasty!

I love macaroni salad with ham, cheese and peas.  It's one of my faves.  When I found this recipe I thought I would give it a shot based on the reviews.  Unfortunately, I didn't care much for this rendition.  I like spicey and hot foot but the hot sauce in the dressing seemed misplaced.  I used about 3/4 of the dressing and then added extra mayo, sour cream and ranch dressing to dilute the potency of the hot sauce.  Too bad I had quadrupled this recipe for my daughter's baptism luncheon.

I made this recipe for my best friends baby shower and got RAVE reviews. Everyone LOVED it. I think it was the hit of the party, besides the expectant mother of course. I did add a little Essence of Emeril to give it a little more flavor, but other than that, it was yummy!

Very good and so easy to make! I did add a dash of cayenne pepper because I like my food spicy. This is a great salad for work lunches.

Agree with some other reviewers that this pasta salad is bland. I made it exactly as written except to use Sriracha instead of hot pepper sauce. Even with the Sriracha, I barely got any kick. Also, 2 ounces of ham is hardly anything. It should be at least 6. Otherwise the pea/ham ratio is all out of whack.

I had to whip up a really quick lunch with very limited ingredients so I altered this recipe more than I would normally, but it still came out great.  I left out the eggs, ham, and peas (no time to dethaw or cook the eggs) and the green onions (didn't have any).  I added green peppers, mushrooms, and snap peas in the pod.  I made the dressing as stated but used slightly less mayo (ran out) and slightly more sour cream to make up.  I also used cheddar cheese instead of swiss.  I was afraid it would be bad with all my changes, but it was great and we ate it all up!  I will try it again without all the changes...but would still probably add additional veggies.  We love veggies and it seems to me it would be a bit heavy without veggies.

This pasta salad was amazing.  It had the perfect amount of dressing, so that it didn't end up dry or goopy.  I added some shredded carrots, diced summer squash, and diced zucchini and then increased the amound of dressing slightly to account for increased ingredients.  It was great on night one, as well as for several more days as leftovers!

This pasta salad wasn't my favorite. It was good, but I've had better. If I make it again, I would add pickle relish and pimentos. I tried doubling the dressing, but it was still dry.

I thought this salad was great. I will definitely make it in the future, with my own variations of course. I thought it needed more sauce, so I would increase that. Also, my family can't eat pasta salad without adding some vinegar.

Very good! Tastes like a deviled egg with the combo of hard-boiled egg, mayo, and paprika.  I used “Pico Pica” hot sauce and “French’s” yellow mustard, and the flavors were surprisingly good together.  I will definitely be making this again.

I am pregnant and having cravings.  I was looking for a macaroni salad recipe, because it sounded good, although normally I don't like macaroni salad at all.  I saw this one, liked the sour cream/mayo dressing idea, and made it with a few changes to suit what I wanted: I used elbow macaroni, omitted the mustard and hot sauce, subbed finely chopped red pepper for the onion and imitation crab meat for the ham.  A dash of salt and pepper too.  Not only was it exactly what I wanted, but my husband said it was very good too.

Everyone raved about the dressing so I tried it as is the first time and it was lacking quantity and flavor; a bit dry and needed zing!  The second time, I made 1 1/2 times the dressing and used smoked paprika and doubled the hot sauce and doubled "brown mustard" instead of plain yellow and added 1/2 teaspoons of salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder and left out all the protein items and replaced with chopped red bell pepper, celery and 1/2" cup cut up match stick carrots for a more light feel.  I was attracted to this recipe because of the pepper sauce and it needed more of it to meet my liking, but it is a really good place to start.  Try it as written and then make your own changes.  It's good, not great as written, be sure to marinate over night.

Used recipe as written with the exception of the spice.  After mixing the dressing I felt it lacked the "umphff" it should have gotten from Frank's Red Hot sauce. I felt the sauce should have had PLENTY of kick before you added it to the salad or it would be too weak.  My adaptation was cayenne pepper.  I started adding it by the 1/2 tsp until I felt it was right.  Since I tripled the recipe I wound up with 1 tsp cayenne to each batch.  It makes it simple to adjust to anyone's taste.  Just adjust the dressing BEFORE adding it to the salad.   
  Mine was for an appreciation, so I loaded it in a $1 aqua marine dollar store "ice bucket" for a fun display, crossed disposable salad servers crossed on the top for a cute presentation that was easy to haul.
  For a REALLY great low carb version, replace the peas with spinach and just switch out the pasta for Dreamfields and voila' a low carb pasta salad!

Skipped the onions and hot pepper sauce, added about 1/4 cup milk, and it came out fairly well.  Not your typical store-bought pasta sauce flavor, but definitely worth making  a second time with a few tweaks.

This is a very good pasta salad. I used macaroni instead of shells. I also used about a tbsp of dill paste that I get in a tube. I love dill and thought it added a nice flavour. The only other addition that I made was to add about one and a half tbsp of lemon juice. I found the dressing was very rich with the mayo and sour cream and needed some acidity. I would make this one again

This is a good recipe.  If you don't want it so thick, try letting the pasta cool completely before combining with the sauce.  It's the same principle as allowing boiled potatoes to cool before adding mayonnaise.

There needs to be a sweet compliment.  Sweet Gerkin pickles or Apples were suggested.  I used mozzarella cheese instead of Swiss and Prosciutto instead of ham.  The ham for texture reasons and it being less salty might be better the next time.  This has potential.  We had no peas unfortunately, that may have helped.

Great salad! The flavors blend incredibly well, and the hot sauce adds flavor without a bite. The only reason this didn't get 5 stars right off the bat is because I like more sauce in my salad- I'll try doubling up on the dressing next time.

I made this using cheese-stuffed tortellini, because I needed more of a main dish type salad, and left out the cheese in the recipe. I took it to a covered dish luncheon of men and women, and people raved! They loved it and ate seconds. I look forward to trying it with the shells and Swiss cheese next time. Thank you for sharing this! :-)

I made this for a baby shower...it got good reviews, however I tweeked it
a lot b/f I served it.  I thought it was very dry so tripled the dressing....used cayenne pepper instead of paprika and new time I'll try cubed swiss cheese instead of shredded b/c the shredded cheese gets lost and is hard to taste.
I added lots more shredded cheese to mine.

This was good. The peas were a bit overpowering though  It needed about a recipe and a half of the dressing as it was a little dry. It is very similar to a salad that I LOVE at Souper Salads excpet with corn instead of peas and ribbon pasta instead of shells. I'll modify next time to see if it comes out like the one at Souper Salads.

This was a great, quick dish that was ready for our family at the end of a hot day.  Very helpful...and didn't have a bunch of veggies that the kids wouldn't eat.

Very nice, although heavy as someone else posted. Personally, I think half a bag of peas is enough for the recipe as listed. If you double the recipe, one 10 oz bag is perfect. I also like a bit more hot sauce for a little more kick.

How do I begin.. I live out in the country so use what I have on hand. Used Elbow macaroni instead, added roasted Edamame instead of peas, 1/4 bell pepper and 1 Romain tomato. I forgot the mustard and didn't add the hot pepper sauce. Used Season salt and pepper to taste. I'm eating it now and am enjoying every bite.

Meh- would not rate this as THE pasta salad, more like a pasta salad. Will go back to my fave Cooking Light pasta salad recipe I've made for 25+ years. I still have people asking for the recipe.

This was just okay. I wouldn't call it DRY, but definitely not CREAMY like I was wanting. I found it bland when the recipe was followed exactly. Definitely don't omit the hot sauce. I used "Frank's". My husband can't stand anything spicy and he said it wasn't hot at all. Unless you LOVE peas I would half the peas and add other veges, or just half the peas. Also please note that this makes A LOT. 7 servings would be if it was the main course. Since I made a double batch I went back and added a few things so we can get through it all; doubled the ham, added cherry tomatoes, a bell pepper, celery and carrots. I also added more sour cream and mayo. Still a bit bland, needed SOMETHING, not sure what (as stated in previous posts). You could experiment with lemon juice, dill weed, celery salt, vinegar etc to figure it out. (Or you could just try another recipe).

This recipe is awesome. It was a BBQ hit. So many good flavors and even better two days later. I used cubed ham and tri color rotini, all else exactly as stated and it was plenty moist and flavored but not spicy so don't hold back on the hot sauce. Yum! It's now in regular meal rotation.

I thought it was very dry, make more of the dressing.  As far as the taste, I've had many salads that taste better.  It was OK at best.

Made as directed, chilled overnight.  The consistency was fine.  Like others, I found the dressing to be very bland, it definitely needs something.  If I make this again I will use chunks of Cheddar cheese to amp up the flavor and a different dressing.

Delicious... to be noted, I used 4 eggs and added shredded carrots, diced cucumber and celery. It would certainly have been fantastic without those additions though.

I found this salad to be a bit dry and short on ham. Between the pasta, peas and cheese there’s not enough ham. I made it without the cheese to try it to see if it needed it. Added cheese to a small portion to try and really doesn’t add much to it so if you are trying to cut fat and calories out you don’t have to add it. The mustard is the key, I’m not fond of it but mixed with the mayo and sour cream it changes it up completely. It’s a versatile recipe that can be changed very easily to suit your taste.

I have to admit I only used the sauce recipe. The mayo, sour cream, mustard, and hot sauce. But it turned out great! I used it for crab with elbow macaroni and the usual suspects. Onion, carrot, apple, walnuts, green pepper, and pecans.  thanks for this a great base obviously for other recipes.

I doubled the recipe and omitted the ham (to give my vegetarian daughter another dish for Thanksgiving), used chopped broccoli and shredded cheddar. Next time I might increase the hot sauce and mustard a bit for extra zing. Absolutely delicious, and I'll definitely make it again!

I used whole wheat tiny shells in mine. I also substituted tiny shrimp for the meat.  I like my pasta salad a bit crunchy so I chopped up some sweet onion, celery and bell pepper, as well as chopped green onion.  I didn't have time to chill for 4 hours; I chilled mine for 2 1/2. I think a little Parmesan might be good in this, as the shredded Swiss cheese just didn't seem enough.  I really liked the dressing though and will make more next time!

I love it, can't stop eating it, hope there's some left for tomorrow! One of the best pasta salads I have ever had!  I followed the recipe exactly except for only adding half the hot sauce called for as I'm making this for a 93-year old who doesn't like anything spicy.

I also, as other reviewers, found this dry and not creamy and I did follow the directions to the T putting 3/4 over the pasta tossing it and spreading the remaining dressing evenly over the top of the salad to the edge... I will not use it again. I also thought the sour cream taste was overwhelming--didn't care for that taste.

I haven't had a chance to taste it yet, but my husband says it is delicious.  I cut the recipe in half and made a full recipe of the dressing to which I added garlic.  I mixed all the dressing directly into the salad.  I used elbow macaroni instead of shells as I had some I wanted to use up.

My family's new favorite pasta salad. Changes: 8 ounces of elbow macaroni in stead of shells; shredded cheddar instead of  Swiss; and 3 ounces of diced ham instead of 2. Next time I will probably increase the dressing since this batch was rather dry, decrease the amount of cheese by half; and add 4 sliced scallions instead of 2.

It is OK, but my husband said it needed more flavor.  I did add some fresh spinach and that added some color.  Next time I will add more seasonings.

Made it with red onions instead of green onions and didn't have eggs to put in. Love the spice! It's amazing! May throw some eggs in later..

I too used shells and cheddar as that is what I had. I was short on sour cream so mixed in some top-the-tater (sour cream and chive/onion potato topping). Doubled the recipe. After it had been in the refrigerator for a couple of hours dressed I added more mayo, mustard and hot sauce with a little milk and garnished w paprika. Bringing it to a potluck of old high school friends, i'll let you know how it goes over...well the hubby loved it, caught him sneaking a bowl :)

It was OK. Plain.  Needs more zip.  Have had a lot of pasta salads and this one is just too plain.

I really liked it.. Until I added the egg.  Is perfect without the egg and I would make it again without it.

I just wanted to try a new pasta salad, and found this recipe. It is excellent and I will be making it again and again.  The combination of ingredients is so flavorful and different than any I have used before.  I have to urge anyone who likes pasta salads to try this one.

This is really good, I use red onions instead of green and add any extra veggies I have like green/red pepper or olives. The sauce is really excellent in this recipe.

Very good but I had to make twice as much sauce for it. It was very dry. We liked the flavor. I didn't have any liquid spice so I used Slam Yo Mama and it was just as good, I think.

Tastes better when it's first made. Once it's cold it's sticky and bland. Was not a family favorite and will not be making again.

Made it for our Memorial Day cookout.  The whole family loved it!  I made some slight changes: Omitted the ham-choose meatless since we were having a ton of bbq! Added finely shredded cheddar cheese blend instead of swiss cheese, used bowtie pasta instead of seashells.  Also added a bit of season salt to add some flavor.  I used the recommended amount of hot sauce, I think next time I will add a little more to kick it up a notch!  Great overall recipe, the family is STILL talking about it the next day!

Was expecting more but, this was just okay. Kind of boring. My husband said he liked it although we had plenty of leftovers that we ended up tossing. Was looking for a new pasta salad recipe but I think there are better ones out there. Won't be making this again.

This is, BY FAR, my favorite pasta salad. Like many others, I've made slight changes. I use cheddar cheese since I don't care for swiss, sometimes I use the shredded cheese and sometimes I cube the cheese. I also make a little more dressing than what the recipe calls for. The flavor combination is DELICIOUS! Highly recommended
