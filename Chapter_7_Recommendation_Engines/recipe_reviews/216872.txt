Yes, they are a lot of work but they are SO worth it.  The only change I made was I used beef tips cut up into very small cubes instead of ground beef.  My husband's family is from Bolivia and they love these.  Thank you.

I submitted this recipe so long ago, I forgot a few things....I usually use chicken, sometimes I use shredded beef. The original recipe called for head cheese.For those of you who know what head cheese is, you know it is not a cheese at all. Not a fan of head cheese (1/2 cup; chopped), so I am meerly mentioning it for those that are interested. To be honest, I am not even sure where one would get head cheese. 
Don't skip the gelatin, it isn't the same without it.

This is a good saltena recipe.  I live in Bolivia and can't imagine what it will be like NOT having these when I move back to the states.  Also, there are so many variations, many people leave out the olives here to satisfy more pallets.  Also, I have had them with raisins and olives only one time when I was at my husbands family's home in Houston never in Bolivia. Even better are the sauces that accompany the saltenas they have usually a spicy peanut sauce an olive sauce as well as a spicy salsa and sometimes a green or avacado sauce.  Also, saltenas vary by region here.  Thanks for the recipe.

My father was born in Bolivia, and his family ran a salteneria in La Paz when he was a teenager. I wanted to make my own saltenas, so I was happy to find this recipe. I was disapointed about how dry they came out, even following the directions to the letter. I'm wondering if I should not have drained the "excess grease" as the recipe calls for, and maybe left it in so it would make a sauce of some kind.

I bought the dough discs ready from the market and it worked, though the saltenas were smaller. I used beef chunks -which I diced- instead of ground beef, and cilantro instead of parsley. These saltenas do not taste quite like the ones I used to have in the South of Peru -and of course, they taste differently in different places- but they turned out really good. I Will make this recipe often since it was easy to follow and not really hard to make. Thanks for the recipe.

Made these today for my husband, who worked in Bolivia years ago.  Added 2 cloves of garlic and omitted the raisins.  Next time will use stew meat diced finer.  They were a hit..

This was really good. My other half who is very picky and hates peas and meat pies loved this! He snuck a second one. :) The only change I made was substituting cayenne and chilli powder for the paprika. We were out so I did 1/2 t cayenne and 1/2 t chilli powder. I didn't use that to add to the egg wash just the filling. thanks for the great recipe!

I'm from Bolivia and there a few restaurants which sell these here. I decided to make my own however, I have no idea why I opted out to try this recipe rather the more authentic ones from my Bolivian cookbooks. Anyhow, these turned out quite bland and unfortunately rather dry, not to mention time consuming. So I was left with a whole lot of something no one in my family was looking forward to eating. We did though for the sake of not wasting and it is edible. The dough was quite similar to the ones of hot pockets, so if I ever want to make my own... Won't be making these again.

Worth making: filling flavor is excellent, but the dough lacks the soft springiness of restaurant saltenas. True saltenas when eaten piping hot drip with sauce -- that's the need for the gelatin, to make filling the rolled dough easier with cooled, gelatinous sauced meat filling. I tried 14 oz jalapeno sauce, but still not as juicy as the real thing. Next time I will put egg in the dough. Still, these are very good.

I also used the dough disks from the store, big time saver. However I found the saltenas were dry as the doug absorbed the gravy, I found if I coated the inside with the egg wash it sealed the dough disk and made the saltena much jucier.

I had never made anything like this before, but my son requested it. They were fantastic! The dough for the bread is delicious - a little bit of sweetness to it. The only changes I made were to use Grillers, a meatless substitute for the ground beef. The filling is so flavorful, we didn't miss the meat at all. I also added a little garlic, and my family doesn't like olives (although I love them), so I omitted them. To speed things up a bit, I used shredded frozen hash brown potatoes, and these worked great. Those two substitutions did make the cooking go more quickly. We served them with a fruity salsa, a nice compliment to the flavors. Don't skip the egg wash either; the little pockets have a lovely shine and texture that you wouldn't get otherwise. The recipe is a little time-consuming, but the family asked me to put this in the regular rotation. Thanks for a great recipe!

The flavor was excellent, but I found the dough incredibly hard to roll out.  And the edges were just too hard to get sealed.  I made about 10 the traditional way, and then got too tired of rolling the dough, so I made a "saltena pie" with the remaining ingredients (something like a chicken pot pie in design, but with saltena taste).

Maybe it's not fair to give a recipe lower marks for this...but I was really hoping for an easier way to make saltenas.

So happy to find this recipe! I was an exchange student in Bolivia many years ago and I've been looking for a saltena recipe ever since I left LaPaz. Can't wait to try this out.

Will definitely make this again.  It was labor intensive and resulted in a messy kitchen, but was not technically difficult.  I was trying to recreate the salteñas I had years ago, and this was close-but-not-quite.  I departed from this recipe by NOT draining the meat; by adding the melted gelatin to the meat mixture and letting it chill overnight; and adding paprika to the dough (instead of the egg wash) to give it the golden color.   I also baked them for 15 minutes longer than the recipe called for.  The salteñas I had previously had some kind of sweet spice, so the next time I make it (and I will), I will do away with the cumin and replace it with cinnamon and/or allspice and see if that doesn't do the trick.

I made the Salteñas and yes, a lot of work but delicious!  I made them vegetarian by substituting tofu and vegetable broth.

While they did take a bit of time, I felt I was able to get them right. Though, from what I read about saltenas, they should be juicy; mine were not. I wasn't crazy about the flavor, as is, and felt more spice (maybe double) was needed. I also preferred them with sauce and thought salsa gave them a nice kick. 
I'm thinking of changing up the ingredients and adding a bit of beef broth or bullion to create a sauce and try them again. 
I do like the dough and thought it was easy to work with.

Good recipe. This is very very close to an empanadas
