A very good recipe, very rich and full of flavor.  Because I didn't have Ramekins, I made them into meat pockets and poured the sauce on top.  It's good to serve with a light salad, as it cuts some of the richness of this dish.

I changed the recipe a bit-I doubled the sauce but didn't include the lobster with the second batch. For the filling I used scallops & shrimp, folded into the second batch of sauce, added the cheese. Made the rest as stated, very very good. I made this for a dinner party & everyone raved about it!! Thanks!

Great taste, but very filling, will try without the pastry next time.

so simple, and so yummy! thanks for sharing. I served with asparagus tips on top, and a little green bean thinly sliced red pepper bundle for entree.

Definitely will make again. Baking time in my case was more like 30 min.
