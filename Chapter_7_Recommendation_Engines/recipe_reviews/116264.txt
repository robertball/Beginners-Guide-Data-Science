I love these!!  My mom use to just make them with vanilla or choc. ice cream. she would take the sides of the 1/2 gallon container and slice it with a knife into squares, then place in between two cinnamon sugar graham crackers, then wrap in tin foil. we would fill up the freezer at the begining of summer.  What a great flashback.  I will try the recipe your way, and share with my mom.   Thanks.

What a fun and fabulous recipe! It was such a hit for the whole family! I left out the peanut butter and vanilla and just made the ice cream sandwiches with slightly thawed out cookie dough ice cream and mint chocolate chip ice cream. I poured sprinkles on a plate and pressed each side of the ice cream sandwich into it! I will definitely be making this one again!!!

everyone in my family loves it! dont bother with the vanilla extract, it tastes great without it. i didn't pay any attention to the amount of ice cream and peanut butter, i just did it to taste. i also added a few chopped pecans and walnuts. stir quickly, or else it will melt. after all, it *is* ice cream!

These were just ok for me.  I added some chocolate Jimmies just because I like sprinkle but I recommend adding them after they freeze.
