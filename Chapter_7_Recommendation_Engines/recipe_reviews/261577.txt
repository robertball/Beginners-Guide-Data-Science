This was a great low carb, low calorie option! It went well with my pulled pork tenderloin. I chopped cabbage and broccoli, instead of using the prepackaged. Subbed what I had on hand for some of the recipe items: Splenda for sugar, raisins for cranberries, and apple cider vinegar for rice vinegar. Also, roughly chopped raw almonds instead of using sliced and left out the grape tomatoes. I will make this again! Thanks for sharing!
