I leave out the meat substitute and often have this as a side dish with a meal. My girls are especially fond of peas and love helping with this quick recipe. I've even added roasted Brussels sprouts to it just because we had them, it was great!

Good as is. I made with regular chicken broth and real chicken, but you need to use low sodium broth as it will be way too salty.

Made 1/2 recipe.
I would give it five stars if I followed the recipe. I used Brown rice pasta, four ice cubes of frozen home made pesto. Added chopped sweet peppers for color, garlic and salt. Left out the chicken and used it as a delightful side to BBQ steak.Topped with Romano Mozzarella cheese. Will be making again for sure.

This is really good and easy to make. I'll definitely be making it again whenever I am in a pasta mood.  The ingredient amounts are good, but I added some extra pesto when it was all said and done because I love the stuff. The Quorn is a good substitute, but I still try not to eat it very often since it was created in a lab and I really don't know exactly what its made of (Google it for more info).  If you're not used to vegetarian type substitutes like Quorn, make sure you cook it long enough.  Make sure it's browned.  Most things like this taste better when you cook it fully or slightly over-cook it, which is why I am guessing someone gave this a 1 star.  My non-vegetarian friend loved it.

I didn't have green onions, so I subbed sweet. Didn't have shells so I subbed linguini. Can't have dairy, so I subbed oil for butter, and I made a homemade pesto with just basil and parsley with a bit of water in my blender. To make it go faster and use fewer pans I browned the onions and Quorn and then added broth, pesto, peas, and pasta. Then covered until pasta was soft, uncovered until water was pretty much gone. It was really good. My 7yo was just 'eh' about the Quorn, but she ate one serving anyway, and then got more peas and pasta, my 4yo loved all of it (and he is the picky one), my 11 month old only dropped some pasta on the ground, but ate all the peas and Quorn. I think the would be really good with the parmesan. Will defiantly add this to our meal rotation.
