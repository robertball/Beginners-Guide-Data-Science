Quick and easy to make.  Delicious, too!  The chicken and pasta flavors were enhanced with the red peppers, mushroom, onion combo.  The sauce was very tasty but runny and not enough.  Next time I will double the sauce and try thickening it up a bit with some flour or corn starch. Thanks for a great recipe, Barilla!
