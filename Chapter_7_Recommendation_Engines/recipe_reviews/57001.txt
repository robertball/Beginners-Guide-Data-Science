I made this for our New Year's Eve mini party.  It is super. I only hope we can keep our hands off of it until the guests arrive.  I used only a fraction of the almonds. One 2 oz package was plenty to cover the top.

Delicious appetizer, but I wouldn't call it a pizza.  Easy and simple.

This is a great recipe.. but you will want to add brown sugar to the top to give it a yummy glaze.

It was bland, bland, bland.... Most of it was left behind by my guests. Sickening.

Was a little disappointed with this... which I hate to say because I was super excited to try it and I really wanted it to work!!  I'll try again with a few modifications and see what happens.  It truly sounds like a great app ~ I want it to work!
