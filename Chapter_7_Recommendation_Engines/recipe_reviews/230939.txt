Let's give this recipe five stars for a great base recipe that offers lots of versitility.  Five plus with my tweaks, it was really delicious and hubs loved this.  I only used 4 potatoes, two white and two sweets, added an onion, and really spiced this up.  I used a totoal of three tablespoons curry (2 sweet, one hot), onion powder, garlic powder, a smidge of cinnamon and clove.  I also used about a tablespoon of Penzey's Balti seasoning, out of this world good blend.  Added sea salt and pepper. I used coconut milk in place of cream. Delicious and easy!

This recipe is AMAZING! It is one of the best and closest to Indian food I have ever made at home.

Very good, easy recipe.  The only changes I made were I used approx 2 cups baby carrots cut in half, about 1/4 cup green beans (all I had on hand)and half and half instead of cream.  I served over fresh steamed rice (no yogurt cilantro or nuts - didn't have any handy).  Do not forget to add salt to really bring out the flavors.  I used regular yellow curry, next time I will use madras curry powder to give it some kick.

Loved it. Used Yogurt instead of cream to save some calories. You risk it curdling but mine came out fine. Great recipe and I will make it again.

This was really great and my 8-year old said he loved the "gravy."  It was a hit with the whole fam--even the 1-yr old!  Def make again!  Thank you.   Just a note: I used tomato paste, not sauce.

It smelt good while cooking all day but was very disappointing when it came to eating. No flavour to it at all.

Very good! I was shocked that even my VERY picky five year old loved it. Was a little bland without the salt but once I caved and added it all the flavors really came out

This was delicious!  I used only 6 potatoes and since I had no green beans I substituted peas which worked perfectly.  Otherwise I stuck to the original recipe and it turned out great.  I can't believe someone said it had no taste.  The flavor was incredible.  I have never cooked with fresh ginger root before the flavors in this dish were complex and superb. I served it straight, no rice and did not do the yogurt on top.   Next time I might experiment a little by adding onions, but honestly, I don't think it could have been any better.  Will make again and again.

I must admit, I did not care for the idea of green beans in an "Indian" dish. Omitted those and added a dash of cloves to add some depth. Came out very well. Simple and tasty - just the way I like my meals!

Very easy and quite tasty, but super than I generally like my curry.  Going to have to play around.
