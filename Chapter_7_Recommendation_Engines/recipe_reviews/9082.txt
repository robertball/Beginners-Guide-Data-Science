This was so yummy!  I did take advice from others and made some changes.  Used fresh steamed broccoli cut into small pieces, regular rice steamed in vegetable broth, half of the butter, half of the onion and shredded cheddar instead of processed cheese.  For the soup I used cream of mushroom with garlic.  That really made it tasty!!

I make this recipe every year for Thanksgiving & Christmas. It has become a new family favorite. 

I've made the following changes to the original recipe:

16 Ounces of Velveeta Cheese instead of processed cheese in a jar.

2 Cups Chicken Broth instead of water when preparing the rice. 

I've used condensed Cream of Chicken soup instead of Cream of Mushroom with the same results.

Fresh Broccoli Florets, hand-chopped and steamed make a big difference. 

I also think this taste better when prepared at least one day in advance and reheated when ready to serve.

MMMM This was so tasty!! I used real cheddar cheese instead of the processed kind and it came out great. I also used fresh broccoli, i steamed it in my veggie steamer for about 4 minutes until it started turning bright green. And instead of instant rice I steamed some white long grain rice. Next time I will add some more onions. My husband despises casseroles, and he loved it too!! YUMMY!!

This was delicious, although I did make a few changes based on what others said....I used 1 box of Uncle Ben's long grain and wild rice.  I boiled it in 1 can of chicken broth.  Instead of the processed cheese, I used 8oz. of Velveeta light and 8oz. of shredded Monterey and Colby cheese.  Instead of mushroom soup, I used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of celery.  My husband (as well as myself) loved it!  Thanks for the suggestions everyone!

I made this for a Christmas party tonight. Everyone wanted the recipe! This had a fantastic taste. I alternated the recipe a little. 
For the rice, I used Uncle Ben's wild rice, I put fry seasoning in the onions, I used unsalted butter, 1/2 cup Velvetta shredded cheese and melted it, 1 1/2 cup Monterey Jack and Colby cheese shredded, and crumbled Ritz crackers on top. I baked 300 for 25 minutes. It was out of this world!!!!! Thanks for sharing this fabulous recipe.

OMG! This recipe is just awesome! I love it enough to eat it by itself as a meal, just add shredded chicken to it. Made it for a thanksgiving dish the 1st time and have made it several more times since then. I usually have to cut all ingredients in half since it makes so much. Thanks for sharing!

This is a wonderful accompaniment to a ham or lots of other dinners. I used about 3/4 of a 15oz. jar of Cheez Whiz, one can of 98% fat free Cream of Celery and one of Mushroom soup and used two 10oz. bags of frozen California Blend (carrots, broc. and cauliflower)cooked acc. to pkg. directions. It was wonderful! I added NO exta salt as it has enough with the soups and cheez.

I used cheddar cheese instead of processed, and long grain rice rather than instant. The gang raved about this dish. Will definitely make it again.

This was a very good broccoli casserole, I made it for Thanksgiving and it really tasted great.  I used shredded cheese instead of jarred, instant brown rice instead of white, and I used 2 - 16 ounce bags of frozen chopped broccoli I cooked in a big bowl in the microwave.  I also added seasoned breadcrumbs on top with a few thin butter pats.  Other reviews said it needed no extra salt because of the salt from the cheese and the cans of mushroom gravy,  although there is lots of sodium in those cans, I did wish I added more salt, but I added more broccoli than the recipe said and the cheese wasn't processed so that might be why.  I will definitely make it again.

This is not a bad recipe but I just didn't like the frozen this, instant that and jar of cheese whiz.  There has to be a bunch of chemicals in all that.
So I used fresh brocolli, brown rice, and a half pound each of gruyere and sharp cheddar.  I also cut the mushroom soup to one can and subbed a half cup of chicken broth for the other.  I did the rice in a rice cooker and put the brocolli on top for the last 15 minutes to cook. I also reserved a cup of cheese for garnish

I made this recipe for thanksgiving. I followed the instructions, not changing a single thing. I've already got a request to make it for a friend who will take it to his job's christmas party! Needless to say it was a hit at thanksgiving.

I've made this recipe since the 1980's and always use instant rice.  For those who said instant rice turns out crunchy, use liquid equal to amount of instant rice. For this recipe I use 1 cup milk and 1 cup low sodium chicken broth. The soup, cheese and rice all need a liquid to blend and bake together nicely.  This requires a 11x13 casserole dish and will not fit in a typical 9x13 baking dish.

Yum!  I change things up a little, but this is a great base recipe.  I use regular steamed white rice (jasmine) that usually is left over from earlier in the week or is in the freezer (rice freezes really well).  I use a lot less butter, usually about a tablespoon or so, since I don't find much of a difference.  I saute chopped garlic in the butter and add a cup of onions or a bunch of fried onions, depending on my mood.  To make the creamy sauce, I use a can of cream of mushroom and then a can of milk and sub a package of shredded cheddar cheese for the processed stuff.  My husband LOVES this dish.  He told me to remember it when we have kids! :)

There are many broccoli casseroles out there,but this one is very simple and taste great. I make this by throwing everything in a bowl and mixing it,only changing the recipe by using real shredded cheddar, and it comes out wonderful everytime. I made this last night in the slow cooker and it worked out great! (we ate the whole thing!)

Made this for our work Thanksgiving dinner and it got rave reviews and again this weekend for a party. Everyone just loves it and asked for the recipe. I used two 16 oz. bags of broccoli florettes. To the rice I added 2 chicken bullion cubes and a few shakes of seasoned salt along w/some ground black pepper. To the cream of mushroom mixture I also added approximately 1/2 cup of sour cream. Left out the processed cheese and used one whole bag of shredded cheese food instead and about 1/2 sleeve of crushed butter-flavored crackers.  The first time I made this I used the amount of onion called for and it was a bit too much so I only used 1/4 of a medium sized onion the second time. The flavor was much better. Once in the pan I topped it with slices of cheese food and topped this with two sleeves of crushed butter-flavored crackers. Talk about Heavenly!!! If you like cheese...try it this way. You will love it!

This was extremely bland. I was very disappointed. The reviews were all so wonderful. This definitely needs more onions and seasoning. It was definitely NOT worth the calories from all the cheese and the condensed soup.

Deeelish!  I used diced chunks of light Velveeta cheese (I used the block kind, not the jar kind) & fat-free cream of mushroom soup to reduce the fat content & it turned out great!  Original recipe makes a large portion, but I still added more cheese, broccoli & rice & just about overfilled my casserole dish! I baked mine in the oven for 30 minutes & finished it up in the microwave for about 10 minutes (I needed the precious oven space for other Thanksgiving side dishes).  The result: ooey, gooey, cheesey LOVE!  Highly recommended & highly flavorful!  Leftovers reheated well & tasted just as great as the first-round!

If I were stranded on an island this is the one meal I'd want to eat every day.  I make mine with fresh, steamed broccoli, shredded cheddar (in lieu of faux cheese), and brown instant rice for a little extra nutritional value.  Delicious!!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving, Christmas, and an office party.  It was very well received by everyone and there is never any left over.  It is very easy to make.  I cook the broccoli for 30 minutes so it will be soft, it seems to blend in better.  I highly recommend it!!

I made this as an extra side dish for Thanksgiving and it was great...I used Velveeta light suggested by someone for a similar dish at Allrecipes and the low-fat cream of mushroom soup to cut some fat and calories. I also cooked regular rice instead of using instant rice. The only mistake I think I made was not cutting the cubes of cheese small enough.  I heated this up for lunch for several days after Thankgiving and absolutely loved it!!!!!  I think I will cut the recipe in half and enjoy it with my family year round so I don't have to wait to Thanksgiving to make it again...Thank you Helen for a great recipe!!!!!

This recipe is great! Don't let the fact it has a jar of processed cheese fool you, this is what gives it more flavor. I don't prefer mushroom soup, so I used Cream of Celery...turns out wonderful w/ lots of compliments everytime!

I make this same recipe excepting that I mix the raw rice in with all ingredients and add the same amount of water as rice. 
I ususally use one 10 oz. box of broccoli cuts, 1 cup of rice, 1 cup of water, 1 chopped onion, 4 Tbs. butter, and 8 oz. of Cheez Whiz. I also usually add a 4 oz. can of mushrooms, drained.  Mix everything together in a large bowl and pour into an 8 X 8 baking dish.  Bake for one hour at 350.  Saves a lot of time in that you don't have to pre-cook the rice and broccoli.  You can also add drained sliced water chestnuts.

Best broccoli casserole; hands down! I've eaten and made tons but nothing tops this! I made it for a birthday party (that was Friday) and couldn't wait to eat the left-overs the next morning! I'm making it again today (the next Wednesday)!  I could honestly eat this every single day!!!! Thank you so much!! :D

I can only give it a 1 because I thought it was edible, but nothing special.  My family hated it.  If you like the old time casseroles that used to be made though, you'll like this.

5 stars!! Oh my goodness this is mouth watering. I didn't have onion, so I omitted that. Plus I couldn't find process cheese sauce where I live so I bought cheese dip, it was a bit spicy. I think that made all the difference!! I could have eaten the whole thing before even putting the mushroom soup or even baking it. We don't have cream of mushroom here, so I just took a package for mushroom soup and put less water than directed. There was no need for any salt or pepper! I will be surely making this again !!!

This is a really good recipe. I doubled the servings and it still came out really good. The only thing I did different was add a little Tony Chachere and jalepeno (chow-chow) to give it a little kick. Perfect!

This was a delicious meal easy to make.  I made only 2 subs used baby broccili florets and Tostitos mild creamy cheese dip (could not find cheese whiz) No other substitustions this is a feeling side dish or main dish for a vegetarian.  I will fix this again for guest!

Family loved this dish!!  The only thing I would change is use less of the mushroom soup or use more rice or use some low-salt versions of things.  It was a little over-powering with salt.

I changed the recipe a bit. I used REAL cheese, not that process cheese in a can. I also added way more cheese than the recipe called for-because you can never have enough cheese. I also used cream of chicken instead-just to use up what was left from a previous meal. I also used twice the rice mainly because I had extra already cooked from another previous meal. Overall, it was really tasty, but I would suggest to the amount of rice the recipe calls for.

Awesome side dish! I did use fresh broccoli instead of frozen since I had it & real cheddar cheese & used 1 cream of mushroom & 1 cream of chicken soup and also used leftover cooked cheddar rice I had on hand. Everyone loved it! I'll make this again & again for sure. Thank you :>)

This is a great all-in-one recipe.  You could even add some chicken and really cover all the food groups.  I made some changes like others have said: fresh broccoli, real cheddar, more onion and added a few of my own: put some garlic in with the onions, Parmesan cheese on top.  I also thought a dash of soy sauce would add to the recipe.  Great easy recipe!  Thanks!

I made this years ago and didn't even realize I got it from on here. It used to be one of my favorite casseroles. I used to just defrost the broccoli in some hot water instead of cooking it making it mushy though. At my university they used to serve a version of this with added chicken. I will have to try making this again sometime soon.

GREAT & OH SO GOOD....I did not have cream of mush soup and used cream of chicken instead.  Also used Velveeta.  My grandson, who's 10, wanted to eat the whole thing...but I wouldn't share!  I might try putting some celery in with the onion next time to add a bit of a crunch.  But all in all this was very good and I will definately make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

My family really enjoys this rice recipe. I've made it a few times now. I like to make it with 8 oz of processed cheese and 8 oz of shredded cheese. The men in my house just love this. I also like to take a box of stuffing mix, add it to about a 1/3 of a cup of melted butter and use this as a crispy, tasty topping! It makes great leftovers too. I'm serving this with the "Melt-In-Your-Mouth Meat loaf" recipe from this site tonight. For dessert we are going to have the "Scrumptious Strawberry Shortcake"  also from this site!

Wonderful dish! I had one can cream of mushroom and one can cream of celery so I used them both.  I also steamed my rice and had leftover chicken which I shredded and added.  Used frozen broccoli florets and they were great.  Instead of the processed cheese, I also used grated cheddar cheese.  Mixed it altogether and added garlic powder, pepper and salt.  Delicious!

I agree with the other reviewers. This recipe is much better with shredded cheese instead of the process cheese. I also used cream of chicken soup rather than cream of mushroom and yielded better results than following the recipe exactly. I gave it a 3 because I reserve the 5 ratings for recipes that don't require so many tweaks and changes to taste good. Thanks for the idea though, it was fun to work with!

I made this recipe and took it to potluck. Even with the variety of wonderful food there, my whole 9x13" casserole was gone. However, I would not make this recipe again. I follow the suggestions given by others. I used the 16 oz. cheddar cheese, the garlic mushroom soup, fresh broccoli and steam the rice on 4 cups of vegetable broth.  The cost for this recipe was approximately $13. Cheddar cheese, $4.68; soup, $1.25; fresh broccoli $3.18; vegetable broth, $2.48. Rice and onion were the two other mayor ingredients.

This was sooooo yummy!  I used 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of pepper jack cheese soup.  I also added cooked cubed chicken.  I did not use the processed cheese but did use regular shredded cheese.  This was a recipe that my whole family loved.  It is a keeper.  Thank you so much!

Great recipe. I altered the recipe a bit by sauteeing a handful of fresh mushrooms with the onions as well as using fresh broccoli and blanching for a couple minutes. I didn't have any processed cheese on hand so I grated cheddar cheese and mixed it in with all the other ingredients. Thanks for the post

I made this with the broccoli cuts as per the recipe, but I changed the soup from two cans of cream of mushroom to one can of cream of mushroom and one can of broccoli cheese, and I used real shredded cheese. Fantastic!

Glad I read the reviews, I also used fresh grated cheese but included an Italian blend cheese.  I also added fresh garlic to the onions towards the end of sauteeing them.  Can't go wrong with fresh garlic in anything!  I also have always liked the Ritz cracker drizzled with butter topping (I Can't Believe It's Not Butter light and reduced fat Ritz) to save on calories!  One final amendment I made was the use of brown rice cooked in vegetable broth.  Everone agreed, best Broccolli casserole they have ever had!  Sooo yummy!

This dish was very tasty! Since I sauted the onions in butter, I left the butter out of the recipe. There was a nice blend of ingredients - had a great flavor.

I make this for potlucks and holiday dinners, but never include the onion.  I think it tastes great without it!  I also use 1 can cr. of mushroom and 1 can cr. of celery in my recipe.  I don't care for mushrooms and don't want the taste to be overpowering.

Great combination of flavors. Made a LARGE 9x13 casserole. If you are only serving a few people you may want to half the recipe. Make sure to steam the broccoli and not over cook it before you put it in the casserole. I used velveeta, thinned with a little milk (in place of the cheese sauce it called for) and it turned out great.

My family has been making this recipe for years, originally just with Thanksgiving dinner.  Now it shows up at most of the family functions.  I prefer partially steamed fresh broccoli before mixing with other ingredients. Everyone's favorite rice.

I just made this for Easter and it was a hit. Very easy and tasty. I forgot to season with salt and pepper before baking, but no one noticed. The cheese sauce is probably salty enough, you don't need to add extra.

This was the hit of our Christmas dinner!  I love reading other reviews and tips for ideas when I research recipes.  I used regular rice instead of instant, cream of celery soup, and florets instead of chopped broccoli.  A sleeve of crushed buttery round crackers made a nice topping before I baked it.  This is destined to become a family tradition. Thanks for a great recipe.

You can't mess this one up- it's so easy. We love it and have made it many times- sometimes with fresh broccoli and sometimes frozen- also with real Cheddar and Velveeta- I don't use the jar stuff really. I have even done it with an Italian Cheese blend and that is also delicious. Great comfort food recipe. Thanks for sharing.

Update: Still use and love this recipe. Instead of regular onions this time- I mixed in French's Crispy Onions and topped with more cheese and crispy onions. Obviously not healthy but really delicious.

This turned out great!  I lightened the reciped a little by sauteing the onions with out butter, substituted the mayo with canola mayo, and cut the ammount of mayo in half.  Oh. and I used low-fat cream of mushroom soup.

Sometimes simpler is best. I have tried dressed up fancier versions of this casserole and was always disappointed. This recipe was right on. Just make sure you buy good quality brand name frozen brocolli florets or you will end up with brocolli butt casserole!

This Recipe was a lot better than I thought it would be. I made it because I was running out of food and had most of the ingredients. The only thing in didn't have was the processed cheese (mainly because I don't eat the stuff) and instead I just put some shreaded dubliner in. It was great.

My mother used to make this when I was a kid.  I have searched and searched for her recipe.  I was thrilled to find yours... Cheez Whiz, yes, that's the magic ingredient.  Tastes just like Mom's.  Fantastic!

I followed some of the other reviewers advice and used real shredded cheese instead of processed.  I also only had a cream of mushroom and cream of chicken on hand so I used both of those.  I added minced onions (from jar), and steamed from a bag organic broccoli and yum!

This is good.  I use cream of celery and cream of mushroom soup and real cheese.  Mix some of the cheese in, top it off with the rest.  As well, I put chicken, more broccoli and some carrots and cauliflower in as well.

I made this recipe as written.  It was very good, but a bit to "cheesy" for me.  I will definitely make this again, but next time I will use 1/2 the cheese.

I added chicken to make this into a meal. My husband and kids liked it but I just thought it was okay. The cheese whiz just tastes a little funky to me. I also cut down on the broccoli to suit my two year old. Otherwise I think it's a solid four star.  I just want to add that I tried remaking this tonight with generic cheez whiz. Wow please DO NOT EVER use generic. After tasting it I'm afraid I may have to throw it all away because the taste of the generic cheese stuff is just plain awful. Too bad because this is a good for a family dinner.

I edited the recipe to yield 18 servings. I added lots more broccoli than what it called for (used frozen broccoli florets). Steamed the broccoli & then sliced it so folks would be less likely to need a knife when eating this. I used unsalted butter, healthy choice cream of mushroom soup & lite cheese. I also did not add any salt at all - the cheese had enough in it to suit our tastes. I added lots of garlic & not as much onion because the company who was eating it are not fans of onions. This turned out so good, & like others have said - this was even better when reheated!

I make this often when I need to bring a dish to a party or holiday.  The kids like it and I get great reviews from adults too.  I have made it with brown rice and the healthier soup option in order to make it a little healthier.  It comes out just as good. I tried it with real cheese but I didn't like it as much.

This is a family favorite for us as well! It's not really Thanksgiving unless this is on the table:) 
*** note ***  My husband is terribly allergic to mushrooms, so we substitute Cream of Chicken, instead of Cream of Mushroom and it's delicious that way too!

This stuff is fabulous!!  It is tasty as is but I have tweaked it a little bit to make it easier and cheaper (I use 16 oz. broccoli which equals 1 frozen bag, 1 can cream of chicken soup because it has more taste than the mushroom soup, 8oz. Cheese Whiz and half of the rice) .  My family loves it.  I only have one broccoli-eating kid but the other one even likes this.  It is a keeper for us!

This was an awesome recipe. I made it for my brother and all of his marine friends and they loved it. I used medium cheese and extra pepper, which gave it a little bit of a bite.

I make mine this way also. I do have a few add-ins! Cooked shredded chicken breast mixed with the rest of the ingredients is really good! Then, mix crushed crackers with melted butter and put on top! It is GREAT!

I skipped the rice and butter. I also added shredded cheese instead of jar cheese. Add 1 egg to give a thickness and crumbled Ritz on top and bake for 45 minutes. YUMMY!

I used long grain basmati rice (any rice will do). Monterey, cheddar and colby cheese. Boiled the rice with mostly chicken broth, used 2 cans of cream of chicken. I made a thick layer of cheddar cheese ontop of dish before baking. That came out nice.  Good basic recipe. Needs more broccoli. Next time I Will add corn, that would be good. you could do a lot of stuff with this recipe, I will definitely use it again.

I followed others' suggestions: substituting cream of celery and cream of chicked soups for the cream of mushroom, reducing the onion, using a combination or Velvetta and Monterey Jack cheeses instead of the cheese spread, using Long Grain and Wild Rice, and topping with crushed Ritz crackers.  The dish turned out fabulous and was a wonderful side to our pork loin.  This dish also reheats well in the event any is actually left.

I loved this casserole and I don't usually like broccoli.  I made it for Christmas day and it went over well.  I used a wild rice mix and shredded cheddar jack cheese.  I also used 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 cream of celery.  I  used a bag of frozen chopped broccoli.  I think the smaller pieces of broccoli make this recipe better for people who aren't big fans of broccoli.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I received a lot of compliments on this dish and I expect to receive more soon.  It is easy to make and delicious.  I used one cream of mushroom and one cream of celery and no need to salt.  It is a great recipe.

A wonderful recipe.  I used cream of celery soup because a friend was allergic to mushrooms and it turned out even better.  I have also added cooked chicken to the recipe and it made a terrific one-dish meal.

We don't eat broccoli very often, but we will now. This was wonderful. My family loved it.

This was really good, definitely not bland. I only give it 4 stars because I used real cheese instead, cheddar and colby jack I think. Not a fan of processed cheese. However, the cream of mushroom was great in it, I know next time I make it it will be even better because I really just scraped this together because I had some fresh broccoli I desperately needed to use, and I used some leftover rice, I didn't have enough to use the 2 cups. I could have filled it in more with some cooked potatoes that were in the fridge and some celery, but didn't think of it till after! I also randomly threw in some mustard since I saw it in another recipe, and I added some garlic and parsley. This recipe has a lot of flavor, and can be simple like this for an amazing side (though my vegetarian father and I had it as a meal I just kinda threw together), and I see potential to use it as a starter to add more stuff to. One day I will try adding potatoes and/or celery and let you know if it's edible ;)

I made this for Thanksgiving as a side dish, and it was good, but not amazing. I used real cheese instead of the processed cheese the recipe called for, which was good but also causes you to use more cheese, so be aware when you are buying ingredients. It was sort of bland, I wanted a little more flavor from it, but all in all it was alright. Very easy to make!

yum!  I used brown rice from last nights dinner, fresh sauteed onions, mushrooms, and zucchini... oh and of course 2 packages of broccoli!  Hard to beat making such an easy dish like this.  The real secret is the cream of mushroom and cheese flavor.

what a wonderful dish!  even my picky five year old scarffed it down!  my husband even ate the left overs (he never eats leftovers).  i'd give the poster a perfect ten, but i guess a perfect five will do.  i followed the recipe EXACTLY, except that, instead of making broccoli casserole, i made french quarter shrimp!

This is an amazing dish! It's really not too tough to throw it together either... I added some shredded chicken breasts into the mix, doubled the onion, added sauteed garlic, and used steamed fresh broccoli. My boyfriend absolutely loves it, and so do I!

I have added canned mushrooms to this recipe and substituted California Blend (broccoli, cauliflower & carrots) for a new twist to this recipe.  My family loves this recipe whether it be just broccoli or if it's the California blend!!!!

Delicious...I used fresh broccoli, garlic mushroom soup, and regular rice, not instant steamed the rice in vegetable broth, used 3 cups of cooked rice.  I also used a little half and half because it seemed a little dry...I used shredded cheese, since that is what I had on hand.  But delicious!

I made a couple changes to this recipe based on previous reviews. I used fresh broccoli, shredded cheese, and sprinkled ritz crackers on top. However, I didn't really enjoy this recipe. I found it to be mediocre. It tasted underseasoned, the texture was mushy, and it was bland. I even ended up throwing away the leftovers and I really dislike wasting food! I will not make this recipe again.

The BEST broccoli casserole I have ever made.  I made it for New Years Day dinner and will make it every year going forward.  I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen, and I also heated the soup and added the Velvetta to that before I added it to the other ingredients.  Everyone was raving about it.  DELISH!!!  10 stars.

This is fantastic and easy to make. I get requests every year for me to make this dish.  The only thing I omitt is the butter.  I only use enough butter to saute the onions.  I also cook this for 1 hour in the oven instead of 30 to 40 minutes and I cover the top in shredded cheese.

I adjusted the recipe for 4 servings since I was only cooking for my fiance and me.  I followed the recipe to a T using a Fritos brand jar of mild cheddar cheese spread (I couldn't find a jar of Cheese Whiz-- only those spray cans).  Well, I was thinking there'd be plenty of leftovers of the casserole left for my fiance to bring to lunch the next day.  Nope.  He went up for 3 helpings.  He is looking forward to eating this dish again in the near future!  I served it in a glass, square casserole dish with grilled chicken breasts marinated in Italian dressing.  VERY good!  I think I'd use more of the soup next time to make it a little creamier and more broccoli.

This recipe is good, don't get me wrong, it's just not fantastic.  I thought it was a little mushy.  Maybe I cooked my broccoli too long or something.  I think I'm going to continue looking for another recipe that WOW's me a bit more than this one did.  Not sure if I would make again but I did like it.

I made this for Easter, and everyoe loved it. I loved it because it was so easy to make. I substituted Velveeta for the cheese sauce, because I was out of that, but it came out wonderful. My husband asked it I could make it again real soon, and as we all know that is the true test to a recipe...whether or not it is requested again and again.

I brought this to a large family Thanksgiving dinner last week and they all loved it. They even asked me to bring it again next year.  I have printed this one out and it's a keeper for sure.  Very easy and very delicious

We made this receipe for Thanksgiving using fresh broccoli steamed until it started turning bright green and white long grain rice with a sweet vidalia onion.  Plus used 16oz of the shredded mild cheddar cheese and sprinkled alittle paprika on top for color.  Everyone LOVED IT! I love it so much it is going to become one of our popular receipes.  Thanks for the ideas everyone has submitted and the receipe!

Wonderful!  I used long grain rice, adding 1 tsp. salt to the boiling water (most long grain rice recipes call for 4 cups water + 2 cups rice).  I used Velveeta cheese, cut into small pieces.  After the rice cooked, I added the cheese to the top of it, and let it sit for 10 minutes (covered) so that the cheese would melt.  Then I stirred it together.  I added a little less than 1/2 tsp. salt to the broccoli after cooking and draining it.  Next, I stirred the rice-cheese mixture with the broccoli, and added 1/8 tsp. pepper.  I completely omitted the onions and butter from the recipe - just didn't think it needed it (would do that again!).  I also used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of cream of celery soup, as others suggested.  Great!  I also used cooking spray on the dish, then baked for 40 minutes (until browned on the edges and bubbly).  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I cut soup in half, baked in too large of a dish for 10 minutes too long and it still was gross and runny.  Maybe I did something (else) wrong.

Simply Great!  Easy and inexpensive.  Make it easy on yourself and get the processed cheese in a jar and not the block velveeta.  The cream of mushroom soup was such a nice combination.  Great with chicken!

This is a terrific side dish- great with any meat!!  Only thing I do differently is add bread crumbs to the top prior to putting it in the oven.  I have also substitued different soups- but regardless of the soup it is wonderful!

My mom made this for Christmas dinner and it was so good!  She chopped up the broccoli very fine after cooking it.  This recipe makes more than 12 servings - we had 10 adults eating it and still had some left over.

Delicious! You could probably add more rice to this recipe.  I am going to try turning it into a main dish by adding shrimp or imitation crab next time.

Was very good although I did modify it by using cream of broccoli soup and cream of celery instead of mushroom and I also only used a 1/2 cup of processed cheese and then used a preshredded three cheese mix for the remaining 1.5 cups and it was great (find the processed cheese too salty).

Thanks!

This is very tasty. I didn't pre-cook the broccoli the second time I made it and I think it was much better. I like a little bite in my broccoli.

What a wonderful recipe.  Total comfort food and so easy to toss together.  I made a half recipe since it's just me.  Used 2 c. leftover rice and shredded some sharp cheddar cheese (8 oz.).  Added about 1/4 c. of milk to add to the sauce factor since not using processed cheese.  Also added a 4 oz. can of sliced mushrooms.  Topped with crushed, stale cheesy potato chips and dotted with about 1-1/2 Tbs. of butter.   Cooked for 40 minutes in a 8X8 pan to get a little color on top. Yummy!  Will be making on a regular basis.  Would be a great dish for a potluck or buffet.  Adding some chicken would make it a one-dish meal.

Good-I usally don't like it when people try to adjust before trying-but I did just that because I didn't have frozen broccoli-only fresh on hand.  This was a very tasty adjustment!!  Will make again.

This is a very good recipe, very cheesy.  I used wild rice and sprinkled crushed ritz crackers on top.  It was better the next day heated up.  If I make it again, I will probably go with the suggestion to use half velvetta and half of a shredded cheese.

The flavor was above and beyond what I had expected.  Was pretty runny, definately would add more rice and more broccoli next time.  Even better as leftovers.  Was a hit!

Very tasty. I have been trying to recreate the broccoli cheese rice casserole served by a local restaurant for my boyfriend - it's his favorite - and this is the closest thing yet! Very cheesy and rich. With a few tweaks this will probably become a standard around the house.

EASY, EXCELLENT AND SO SO GOOD!!! If I could give this more stars, it get 100!!  I did add more rice and some cheddar and it was just awesome! It will now replace my original Broccoli & Rice Casserole - it's that good!  Thank you for sharing!

We’ve made this since I was little. The difference is I was one can of cream of mushroom soup and one can of cream of celery. With the Cheez Whiz, I just add until it looks good.

I was looking for a dish to make to bring for Thanksgiving with the family when I came across this one. I wanted to make it and try it beforehand to make sure it would be good. Using some helpful hints from other reviewers, I made it this weekend. My wife and I ate every bit of it in 2 days. My helpful hints are, use chicken broth to cook the rice. (Don't use instant rice). And chicken broth to cook the broccoli. Use broccoli florets and leave them intact. Use Garlic flavored cream of mushroom soup. And liberally use real shredded cheddar cheese. I used a lot.  Like a bag and a half. I also liberally sprinkled some on the top as well as some crushed Ritz crackers. It came out amazing. My family will love it. If they don't I'll bring it back home with me.

This was pretty yummy! Of course modifications were made come on it’s all recipes. LOL  I used jasmine rice because it’s what we like. I added extra vidalia onions. I used a ton of seasoning. Pepper, garlic, parsley, red pepper. I ended up using a jar of Walmart brand cheese sauce because it’s what my husband bought. My entire family LOVED it. The only request was to use real cheese next time. I’m gonna try a vegan version next. :)

I made this for a family dinner and everyone enjoyed it.  I used fresh broccoli rather than frozen,  used half mayo and half sour cream rather than all mayo and added a pkg of fresh mushrooms (sautéed).   This one, I'll do again.  It was a hit.

I made this for a friend of mine who had recently given birth and she and her family loved it! I used a block of velveeta cheese and added cayenne pepper. I also added water chestnuts to the onion/garlic and topped it with crushed crackers for some extra crunch.

I made this today for Christmas dinner. We usually have a vegetable bake family recipe with spinach, green beans and cauliflower. My sister was bringing green beans, so I saw this the other day and decided at the last minute to make it. I did use fresh steamed broccoli and only had 1/2 block of velveeta, so used that and a cup of grated cheddar. I don't like to make dishes I have never made for a holiday, but it was a hit. I will be making this for many holidays to come. Forgot to add I used chicken broth in the rice also.

Very good! It didn’t taste like I was eating veggies at all. Also quite filling, I’ll probably make a smaller pan next time because i wasn’t able to finish it all.

The rice ruined this recipe.  It soaked up all the liquid and made it very dry.  Never make it again.

Used 1/4 of a large onion. Sautéed the onion with season salt and pepper then added 1/4 cup of water and a chicken bullion cube. Added the fresh chopped broccoli to this and sautéed until bright green.  I repurposed some day old rice, combining all the ingredients in a glass baking dish. I used shredded sharp cheddar. topped with bread crumbs just because. Turned out great!!! While I prefer the taste of simple sautéed fresh broccoli, I would make this again.

Turn out great. I did add two cloves of garlic and cut the recipe down by half since I was only feeding 3. But this is definitely a keeper. I plan on trying this with hash browns instead of rice. But it's also great just the way it is.

For a nice touch, 
Crush up a couple sleeves of ritz crackers. Melt maybe a stick of butter. Add to crackers an mix around then put on top of the rice then bake. My family loves the ritz topping. I also use this for other recipes like seafood casserole ect. so yummy! 
have fun,
Nancy

Really good.  I replaced 16oz grated cheddar cheese (instead of the jar cheese!) and used regular rice (not instant) and everyone loved it.

Super yummy.!! We mixed in dried oregano, dried basil, and lemon pepper seasoning before putting it in the oven. I also added three tablespoons of cream cheese to make the flavor richer. Instead of processed cheese, I mixed in few handful of shredded sharp cheddar. On top, I sprinkled some extra shredded Mexican cheese we had in the fridge. Instead of instant rice, I made some brown rice (cooked in chicken broth). Everyone loved it!

This is a great holiday dish. I'm pretty sure I use more than two cups of rice but I don't actually measure it. I also don't find that it needs any salt (2 cans of soup is plenty of sodium!) but I add a teaspoon of pepper. I also add some garlic to the onion while it's cooking. I put it all together the day before the holiday and then bake it the next day.

I  made this exactly as written but used cheddar cheese not process cheese sauce.    I also added one clove of garlic to onions after sautéing them.  Glad I did.  Left overs tasted better- than when first cooked.  It had a good flavor but I was expecting something a little more creamier --this seemed a little too dry to me.   But that could be because I did not use the cheese sauce.  Also  it could be cause I used regular rice not instant.   Don't know.   I will make it again but might add a little milk .....maybe    and at least one more clove of garlic for sure and  more onions would not hurt or broccoli.        Maybe I did something wrong ---it would not have been so dry if I had put it in a 7x11   due to the fact that 9x13   made it pretty thin.

I was so excited to make a new dish that had such high reviews. It looked simple too. Unfortunately, among 7 dishes made, this was the last favorite. I followed the directions as stated but it tasted a little bland and mushy. I think from reading other reviews real cheese and fresh broccoli made it taste better. I wished I would have used those instead.

I've been searching for this recipe for a long time.  I use Cheese  Whiz and Uncle Ben Original rice along with cream of mushroom and cream of celery soup.  Sometime I add celery and and onions.  This seems to be one way to get children to eat broccoli.  Thank You for submitting this lost recipe of mine.

This was very good.  I did a couple things different too. The big difference is I added chicken!   It was delicious! I put the chicken in the skillet with the onions.  I also boiled the rice in water., used 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of mushroom, shredded fresh cheese, fresh broccoli, and mixed in some lemon pepper (I love lemon pepper). There's only 2 of us in the house, and it's all gone in less than 12 hours!

This dish was really good. Didn't use a cup of mayo, I used 1/2 cup of mayo and a 1/2 cup of sour cream. Also added chopped celery to the onions. There were no left overs. Will be making it again.

Very good! I left out the onion, used canned condensed cheese soup (it was cheaper) and I added cooked baked chicken (shredded). I recommend saving yourself some steps and using a rotisserie chicken if you decide to add meat. I also added a Ritz cracker and cheese crumb topping. It is a very filling dish and didn't last long in my house.

I made almost exactly by the recipe and LOVED!  I used Campbell's cheese soup 1.5 cans with a little almond milk and sprinkled ritz crackers on top as well as about 1/4c of cheese. Delicious!

My mom has been making this same recipe for atleast 20 years. I have never cooked the rice first, but I do add a half cup of water. Leave the broccoli to thaw if using frozen. No need to cook that either.  You pretty much put it all together and bake it. Turns out great!

I substituted shredded cheddar for the processed sauce. I added about 2/3 a cup to the rice mixture and put another 2/3 sprinkled over the top. I also sauteed mushrooms with the onions in 1 tsp of garlic powder, half a tsp of Italian seasoning and some salt and pepper in the butter instead of adding the butter to the mixture. 
    I salted and peppered the mixture before baking. It turned out really good and my family loved it.

Delicious as written.  The second time I made it, I added a pound of cooked leftover chicken and it was a super easy dinner.  When I'm really in a time crunch, I buy the roasted chicken strips and viola: dinner in no time.  Yeah, you could feel guilty about the processed foods, but once in a while, you need something fast and YUMMY.

this is  great baseline recipe - I season better to taste, I also add garlic and a bit of rosemary- instead of frozen I used fresh broccoli and I added fresh cauliflower -- I used a bit less of the creamed soup and jar cheese and added crumbles to the top as well as fresh grated parmesano regiano to bake-- my family raved ! win win !

I make it similar but I add 3 cooked chicken beasts cut into cubes, cream of chicken soup with 1/4 cup of mayonnaise and 1 teaspoon of curry to it. I use shredded cheddar cheese and then toss some croutons on it it!

This has been an old stand by in our house for years with a tweak or two depending on who makes it of course. I made it for a potluck at work to celebrate Thanksgiving and I'm happy I did. However, I left the butter and onions out since I was making it for co-workers who may not be down with oniony goodness. Next time I will use different soup mix to change it up and also I will add a clove of garlic and some onions sauteed in butter and I would like to try muenster and provolone cheese in it.. cuz well, I love cheese.  Happy Thanksgiving Everybody!

My mom makes a similar recipe that in my opinion tastes much better. Use fresh broccoli steamed. She doesn't put rice in. She mixes the cream of mushroom soup with the onions, fresh shredded cheddar cheese and adds in lots of cashew halves (makes it 100 times tastier). Then she Browns bread crumbs in butter in a skillet and sprinkles it over top before putting in the oven.

I absolutely loved this recipe. I followed the directions exactly, and what I got was a creamy and flavorful casserole that's perfect for any occasion. My husband loved this and told me it was a dish he would love to have again. I also had a friend over and she loved it as well!

This was delicious!  I didn't have liquid cheese, so I used a mix of cheddar and mozzarella.  I also didn't have cream of mushroom soup, so I used cream of chicken.  And I used fresh broccoli (steamed it for 10 minutes in the microwave).  It came out of the oven browned nicely on top.  Everyone loved it!

It was really good with changes (hence the 4 star rating) - 1 cup regular long grain rice, added 2 chicken bouillon cubes; 2 or 3 fresh broccoli heads cut and steamed 5 or so minutes; 2 cups shredded sharp cheddar (saved some out for the top, last 5 minutes of baking); way less better, probably 1-2 tablespoons.

Love this on a cold day. Add a pinch of salt, pepper and nutmeg. Also added Velveta cheese. The flour mixture had lumps so i had to whisk it with the mixer.

It was pretty good.  I'm not a huge fan of broccoli so I only put 1 bag of it in this dish (it was actually 12 oz).  It makes quite a bit!

I made a half recipe (thank goodness) and used brown rice, but otherwise I followed the recipe as written, including the cheez whiz (because I remember that's what my Aunt used) and the frozen broccoli.  It was bland.  Not bland like a little salt will fix it (it didn't) just bland like there isn't anything going on.  I think part of the problem was the frozen broccoli.  Anything I ever make with frozen broccoli just doesn't taste right.  I never use frozen broccoli unless a recipe specifically calls for it.  I think I need to just stop.  I'm up in the air on whether I will ever make this again, but I would 1) make a fresh cream sauce instead of using cream of mushroom soup 2) use more onion and 3) use fresh broccoli.  I'm on the fence on the cheez whiz.  That is what gives this recipe it's "kitsch".  It's what takes you back to your childhood.

My non vegetarian hubby loves this recipe, it's one of our favourite.  I added fresh mushrooms and one cup cottage cheese, one cup ricotta cheese.  I change the cheese each time and it's always good.

I just got done eating this with the family. I made this, at my daughters request, as part of her birthday dinner, and everyone liked it. I mixed in some shredded cheddar and monterey jack cheese and then sprinkled more on top along with some toasted japanese panko style bread crumbs before baking for a crispy topping.

This was ok.  I followed the recommendations of others and used the shredded cheese and also used brown rice, but not as good tasting as it looked.  It was lacking something.   I'm thinking the cheese sauce would have added some additional liquid to the casserole and also some spice.

Very good. I used 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of chicken soup. Also cooked the rice in chicken broth instead of water. Added shredded cheddar cheese on top.

I have been using this exact recipe for about 3 years.  I make it for every Christmas party, Superbowl Party, etc. & it's always a hit.  I never have leftovers & I get endless compliments on how good it is.

I just finished making this for the big day tomorrow.  My first impression is that it's a little too oniony.  I hope that's just me.  Also, I'm not sure but I prepared two cups of rice which after cooked equals four that goes into the dish. Is that correct?  I'm going to top it off with cheese when I reheat tomorrow.  It does look very lovely!

This was very good...thank you for sharing your recipe.  Next time I will bake it for an additional 20 min. so the brocolli is more tender.

What a delicious casserole! Everybody loved it during our Christmas Eve dinner. I was a little worried about making it because I had never made a broccoli casserole before but this recipe was so easy to put together. I could tell it was going to be great just by the smell of it while it was being mixed all together. The final product was scrumptuous and tasty. Thanks for sharing this easy & delicious recipe. I will make it again.
