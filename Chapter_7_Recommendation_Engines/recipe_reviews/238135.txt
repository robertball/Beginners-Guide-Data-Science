Simple and impressive. This is so delicious, it will go into my rotation as a budget friendly family favorite. Lovely enough for company dinner too. Assemble ingredients early in the day for a quick dinner. I used canned clams and decorated the dish with a few steamed fresh clams just to make it "purdy".  :) Just a heads up....cook your pasta according to the package instructions (my brand said 9 minutes). Thanks Chef John! You rocked it again!

Sometimes you get GREAT; Sometimes you get AWESOME and Sometimes you get SLAM OFF THE HOOK!! That is exactly what this meal is:  SLAM OFF THE HOOK!!! This is truly gourmet.  I would put Chef John up against an Iron Chef even Bobby Flay. I promise you with this recipe, he'd take away the trophy! Believe me when I tell y'all;  I've eaten in more than my share of gourmet restaurants over the years and this Chef just raised the bar on what's for dinner tonight? ;-) Because this is the absolute ONLY recipe site I use, I ALWAYS make a recipe VERBATIM per ingredients & instructions No offense to anyone.....promise; however, I've never understood making it the first time but making changes right outta the gate then rating it. I can now, however, tell you the changes I made the second time. You CAN substitute whole milk and even 1/2 & 1/2 for the whipping cream--just not a big fan of the cream. You CAN use parsley in lieu of the basil.  I am a big fan of anchovy;  however, again it can be made without. Just with those 3 very minute changes the flavor, consistency, and taste you're gonna have a party in your mouth!! Your tastebuds will thank you. If, like mine, your family are seafood lovers, all that banging and sawing  you'll soon be hearing is just them starting on the build of a monument in your honor.  ;-) Oh yeah, & one more thing--making it really is as easy as he says. For the 12-14 mins it takes to cook the spaghetti and/or linguine in my case  the latter, this meal was comple

This recipe really brings out the flavor of the clam and makes a great sauce. We served the sauce over whole wheat pasta, which complimented the earthy flavor in the clams and anchovies. We did add some mushrooms and onion to round out the flavor. We will definitely make this again - it was my husband's favorite of all the things I've made from this site!

If I make this again, I would thicken the Cream first. It was way to watery/soupy. The flavour was good though.

Delicious ! Followed exactly ! My honey added extra croutons to his, because he loves texture. It was a great change to the butter and white wine clam sauce. Creamy, thick, stick to your ribs good! It was super easy and really ready in 15 minutes. The direction to let the pasta sit covered was an amazing tip. I'll use that with any pasta dish from now on.

Great recipe! I didn't have any cream so I just left it out. It still had a nice creamy texture with the egg yolk. I used calamari instead of clams because that's what I had on hand. I look forward to making this again and again.

I’ll definitely make this again.  We loved it. I didn’t have heavy cream so used half n half, which was very tasty but didn’t coat the pasta quite like the cream would.  This recipe 
Is a keeper!

Made this for family dinner eaten by 3 adults and 3 children ages 13, 10 & 7.  Everyone really liked it.  Followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't use bread crumbs on top.   My only reservation was that after I added the pound of spaghetti to the sauce, it was more like 10 minutes before the pasta absorbed enough sauce.   The sauce is thin.  If you have leftovers for overnight, it will absorb more.   Will definitely make again but will thicken it next time.

It was very delicious.  I added a little too much red pepper flakes.  The sauce was a little hot for me.  I will make it again but with a little less flakes.

This was the first time I’ve heard of putting Heavy Cream in this dish! Wow, leave it to Chef John, it works fabulous! Definitely add the anchovy! Delicious! I will be making it this way from now on. Thanks Chef John!

Very good recipe; nice flavors. Super easy to make. The anchovies  were new to me but it worked out well. I found the sauce a little so liquidy for me... the egg yolk didn't thicken it enough for me preference. Next time, I'll just add a tablespoon of flour to give it the consistency I like. Other than that, it is a keeper!

I really like this recipe and it is really easy, but 1 1/2 anchovy fillets?  My can of anchovies had a dozen fillets.  What to do with the other 10 1/2?  Luckily, I do have cats and they were awfully fond of anchovies.  
The sauce is runny, but after letting the pasta sit in it for about ten minutes, it soaked up most of it.  Adding Parmesan and the crushed croutons took care of the rest and there wasn't even any left on my plate to sop up with my toast.
I made some edamame toasts as a side dish and we enjoyed this immensely.

I'll probably leave the anchovies out next time.  Good recipe though.
