I had 6 thighs so the weight was more like a pound and a half.  I used Presidents Choice Marinara sauce and used more than called for because we like lots of sauce. I didn’t have Italian seasoning so used a bit of oregano, thyme, marjoram and basil. Proportions don’t matter that much but total was about 1 1/2 tsp. Served with bow tie pasta and it was yummy. Served with red pepper flakes on the table for those who like it hot. Will make again.

Recipe turned out great.  I didn’t have Italian spice so I used my own mixture.

Made no changes. It was a nice change from our normal chicken thigh recipes.

Absolutely amazing. Cooked 4 lbs for my family of 5 and absolutely every bite was gone or spoken for, for lunch the next day. We usually have leftovers so I was amazed. I found that the thighs have such a lot of fat for the trimming though. So next time I will try a different cut although my dogs did love their cooked chicken trimmings and rice. Also next time will try with pasta seems probably a better fit. Thank you for the recipe will definitely be making it again.

I doubled the amount of sauce and ricotta mixture so I would have enough sauce to pour on a side of spaghetti.  I just used oregano for the spice.  I used Ragu Old World sauce and it turned out wonderful.

I added a little tomato paste to thicken the marinara. We served it over zucchini spaghetti which made it a little healthier. This is one I'm definitely going to do again.

Absolutely loved it! Pretty much made it as written except replaced the Ricotta with a couple slices of provolone because one of the dinner members won’t eat ricotta. Will definitely make this again.

We really liked this dish, I used skin-on thighs.  I browned then skin side down for about 6 minutes till crispy, then followed the rest of the recipe as presented.  I served ours over a small amount of pasta but I'm sure it would be good with rice too.
Fast easy dinner, can't go wrong!

This recipe was excellent.  I am on the Keto diet and it was perfect with some sliced, fried zucchini!!
