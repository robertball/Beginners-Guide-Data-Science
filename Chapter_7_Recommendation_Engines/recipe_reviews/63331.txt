This was delicious.  I made two ham steaks.  On the first - I used the recipe as it called for.  I thought the vinegar was a bit overpowering.  For the second steak - I mixed in some melted butter.  (ok Fattening) but wow..did that make it scrumptious!  Next time - I will half the vinegar and add some melted butter from the start. For me that made it perfect!  As called for - I gave it 4 stars because of the strong vinegar taste.  I will definitely make this again!  WOuld make a good Christmas dinner (red glaze on the ham)!  I think cooking a regular ham and using this as a glaze would be awesome!

Outstanding recipe! I used tarragon vinegar instead of red wine(apple cider vinegar would be good too).  Will double glaze recipe next time. Delicious!

I cooked this on the stovetop in a skillet with great success.  Not nearly as sweet as I had anticipated, although it is definitely possible the grill carmelizes this dish more and makes it sweeter.  Nice, simple, fast, easy, and attractive dish.  Thanks!

The whole family loved this.
I used half of a pound fresh pitted cherries instead of preserves. Mash fresh cherries with a tsp of brown sugar, half a tsp cornctarch, and teaspoon of fresh lemon juice. Cook over med low heat until thickens, add remaining ingredients in recipe.
Grill some fresh pineapple slices along with ham steak.
Yummie!

Definitely a nice glaze; it gave great flavor to the ham steak.  I followed the recipe exact, and it turned out great.  I did crank the grill up to high right at the end, and gave the steak about a one minute shot on each side.  This really crystalized the glaze.  Balsamic vinegar could be good on this as well.

The glaze was pretty good!  The cherries from the preserves plumped up nicely and it gave the ham a sweet flavor.  However, my ham was too salty.  I would make this again with a better ham steak.

i've always liked cook's ham & was pleased to find this simple but delicious recipe. there weren't any thick cut ham steaks so we ended up using a regular cut (weighing just over a pound) then grilled it as directed except over a medium - low heat so it stayed moist. polaner's black cherry all-fruit preserves seemed to work well. it comes in a 10 oz. jar so i cut back the honey & vinegar a tad but kept the spices in the same amount. yum! thanks cook's!

This recipe rocks!!!! I only used a 1 lb. ham steak & am I ever regretting that decision now. I cut the sauce ingredients by half to compensate for the smaller ham steak. And I also decreased the cooking time a bit as well. I served this w/ garlic corn on the cob (from this site) & leftover red-skinned potato salad (also from this site). Thanks so much for the recipe...I'm already eager to have it again!

My husband and kids raved about this.  Made exactly as stated and would not change a thing.  I actually made two hams and there was plenty of sauce for both and had sauce leftover.  Thanks for a good, nice quick dinner.

WONDERFUL!!! I actually forgot the nutmeg and it was still good. Added some allspice instead. Used maybe three TBLS of the vinegar after someone reported it was too vinegar-y tasting.

I do a lot of recipe testing when the husband is out of town. I didn't want to fire up the grill for just myself so i made it in a large skillet. It was still very good. So when he gets home this will be one of my new delicious recipes!

We made this in the middle of winter so the grill wasn't available.  I just cooked it in a cast iron skillet and kept putting the sauce over the ham steaks.  The next time I make it I will add a little less cinnamon since my family thought there was too much in the sauce.  This was pretty good!
