This one's made it to my permanent cookbook. I cooked it just as the recipe calls for and it turned out wonderfully! This makes a TON of soup - like 10-15 servings. You may want to cut it back if you aren't interested in freezing.

Delicious.  Next time I'll add more sausage.  Don't be afraid of that cayenne - it looks like a lot but it's just the right amount for this big quantity of soup.

I made 1/2 recipe for my small family, using leftover brats (I had three).  In the future, I would use at least one more brat for the 1/2 recipe.  This is a very hearty soup. For a Paleo version, leave out the beans and sub turnips for potatoes.  For an excellent Bratwurst Stew, omit the broth.

Very good! Followed the recipe exactly except I did use leftover brats from the Beer Brats recipe by Zach here.I cut this down to 8 servings and it was plenty for six with some leftovers. It seemed it needed at bit more liquid so I put in a cup of white wine. Will make this again for sure.

This was so good and flavorful that the whole family ate it up and loved it! Didn't have all the fresh herbs,  so I just used dried ones & it worked just fine.

Day before grocery day, so I used leftover marinara sauce  and small amounts of every veggie in the crisper. Used 5 brats but halved amounts of everything else. Then added a can of beer as the cooking liquid and some leftover white beans. It all turned out so tasty that I am only sorry I will never have the same combination of ingredients again.

First of all, I was glad I read other reviews to know that this recipe makes a LOT of soup.  I cut the recipe in half and even though I prepared it for a family gathering, was glad I did.  I still had left-overs (which were delicious).  
Excellent recipe - my husband, brother and sister-in-law really liked it.  I agree that grilling the brats brings that needed flavor to the soup.  I wouldn't change a thing, and would definitely make this again.   In the future I would consider using whatever vegetables I had on hand including cabbage.  Five starts for sure!

I may have added bell peppers one time because they needed to be used up, but this has become one of my family’s favorite soups!  I’ve also switched up the beans if I don’t have canellini beans, I’ve used pinto beans.

I made the dish exactly as directed. It is simple to make, very hearty consistency and a large quantity. As for flavor, it is OK but not special. It is very mild, very watery and lacking any real distinct personality. I'd recommend significantly enhancing the flavor profile. Start by adding the basil at the very end after the spinach.

Love trying new recipes and I'm SO glad I found his one! Even my Mom (the PICKIEST eater ever) loved this soup (that's one for the books)! The only change I made was the basil...I didn't have fresh basil but I did have dried basil, however according to the McCormicks label the ratio is 3 to 1 and I was leery about using 1/3 c of basil. Glad I followed my intuition because one tablespoon was perfect! Next time I think I'll add more meat (and I might even try some polish sausage, hot Italian sausage, or whatever meat we like). Definitely will be making this again and again! Thanks for the recipe!!!

I like this soup because it's easy to throw to together and overall very good. It's pouring rain so I didn't fire up the grill outside, instead just cooked the brats in a skillet which was fine. I think this soup would be much better with them grilled! (I'll wait for better weather to find out though) Doubled the meat as directed in previous comments. If you use homemade broth like I did, then it'll probably need a good amount of salt.

Yummy!  I don't have access to a grill in mid-January, so instead I browned the brats in my dutch oven and then deglazed the pan for extra flavor in the soup.  It was excellent, and I will definitely make it again when I have access to a grill this summer.  I add my seasonings and spices to taste, so I can't speak to the exact amounts as written, but the flavor combinations are wonderful.  Delish!

What a great tasty  wholesome meal. It's definatley saved to the favorites list. It's very easy to cook i just followed the recipe exactly but threw in 2 extra cheese kranskys and some kalamata olives for a little twist. Highly recommended especially with a buttered french stick bread on the side.

My 17 year old daughter and I had this for dinner tonight. It was delicious. We didn't get enough spinach, but it was still good. Next time we'll be more careful to write things down before heading to the grocery store. ;)

This is a great soup! Due to winter outside, I broiled the brats in the oven and it worked pretty well. Grilled as directed would be awesome.

I actually used sweet potatoes in place of potatoes. I also did not add tomatoes (can not have).  My family LOVED this (even the pickiest ones ;) )  Honestly, we were fighting over the leftovers the next day too!  Definitely going to make this again!

Very flavorful, a little spicy hot for me - family loved it as is.  I had to tone it down with a little sugar for me.  I will make it as is but keep a little aside for me with less Cheyenne pepper in it.

It is a lovely soup but the bratwursts themselves are bland, I would cook again and substitute with Cumberland sausages or something more flavourful.  You cannot fault the rest of the receipt though, its really tasty.  I added some mushrooms, mustard, peppers and some Worcester sauce as I wanted to bulk it out and use up what I had in the fridge.

This soup is absolutely delicious!  I used dried herbs instead of fresh (my basil plants were kaput about a month ago).  I also salted the veggies as they were cooking and then added 1/2 teaspoon salt with the potatoes.  It makes A LOT of soup.  Put some in the freezer for lazy days.

I made it and followed the recipe, but I’m guessing the type of bratwurst makes a difference. The bratwursts we used were excellent on their own, but didn’t taste well with the soup.

Perfect for a cold winter night I cut the recipe in half was plenty to fill up my crock pot. I used hot Italian Sausage, so  omitted the cayenne. It was plenty spicy. I put in a heaping teas of Italian seasoning and a bay leaf, a teas of Better Than Bullion chicken, and omitted the salt.  I also had some beet greens in the freezer,  used those . Thank you for this awesome recipe!

My wife and I loved it. Easy, low WW points. Didn't have celery, did have corn, so I subbed in the corn. Didn't have chicken broth, did have vegetable broth, another substitution that worked out fine. Will definitely make this soup again.

91 degrees here and I made this soup. The AC is running so it's really not hot in my house!!!! Soup is wonderful any time!!!!!!!  I needed to use up leftover brats and leftover red potatoes. I cut the recipe in half and followed exactly, except my potatoes were already cooked. I added them in at the end.This is a wonderful recipe. The flavors from the spices make this soup delicious. The beans and the spinach are a great addition. I'll be making this soup often. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Super easy (and quick, as far as soups go) to make and very flavorful.  Given some of the reviews that the cayenne was too much, I only used half but felt it could have definitely used more. Will probably follow the recipe, next time.  I'm also not a huge fan of bratwursts, in general, and think a better meat could be used. But otherwise, very tasty!  Adding it to our regular rotation.

I made this for a church gathering & almost everyone told me that it was their favorite thing, even though I thought it was a little spicy. I didn't want to run out to the store the night before, so I had to use what I had on hand. I didn't have chicken stock, so I used beef. I also didn't have plain canned tomatoes so I used one with green chilies, (maybe why it was a little spicy, but I also didn't measure the cayenne pepper, so that might have contributed to the heat). The other thing I didn't have was the beans, but I really didn't have any more room in the large pot & don't think they were missed anyway, since there were already potatoes in the soup. I would make again.

We halved the recipe (it still made more than enough for our family of 5) but kept the sausage the same. We added the beans at time of potatoes and it was great!  Kids loved it!

good flavor, but too spicy.  If not into spicy, delete the cayenne pepper or reduce quite a bit.  Added a bit of Agave to offset the spice - which helped.

Perfect just the way it is. I've made it a few times.  You can mix and match  ingredients to your own flavor choice.  I rate this 5 stars because it's simple and feeds hungry teens and freezes good for later.  I usually add more sausage. You can put most anything really.  Steak tips, ground beef, kidney beans, whatever.  I keep all the spices the same.

Delicious.  I didn't use chicken broth, used homemade pork bone broth instead but that was the only change I made.  A very hearty and healthy soup

Great for using up stuff I had on hand. But my family just didn't think it was flavorful. Which I did not expect considering the ingredients. Guess it just wasn't for us.

This is a great easy soup, being fall I did not have the fresh herbs, I used dried and worked fine, also I did not have a grill for the brats, the stove worked fine.  It does make a full crockpot. I made it for work everybody loved it.

This has become my favorite recipe on this site and my first review! My husband loved it! I used kale instead of spinach. Fresh parsley is a must but subsistuting dry basil instead of fresh worked fine.

This is nearly identical to a soup I've been making for years. I bet this is great as is - but what I do, in case you want to mix it up, is to use kielbasa instead of brats, garbanzos instead of canellini, and omit the potatoes. You can probably use less broth without the potatoes, too. Freezes/reheats beautifully - one of my favorite lunches to bring to work.

It turned out perfectly, although I didn't have fresh parsley, I used the dried Italian herbs which are freeze-dried and become fresh when added to liquid.  It is true that it makes a TON of soup, but that's great when I have my husband and son with big appetites! They LOVED it and asked why I hadn't made it before. I had to move it to a large crockpot until it could be eaten down. I need a large pot to make this one! Wonderful!!! I did use 2 packages of meat instead of 1!

Great tasting, hearty soup that my husband asked me to keep making especially for big family meals. Instead of two cans of cannellini beans, I used one can and added garbanzo beans for a different texture. It tasted great. Will surely make this again.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was fantastic! I cooked it in my crockpot, so I left out 1 of the containers of chicken broth. I precooked the bratwurst on our grill, but that was all. I just threw it all in (except the spinach & beans) and cooked it on low for 8 hours. During the last hour, my daughter put in the spinach and beans so it would be ready when I got home from work. The only thing I will do differently next time, is to double the meat (as requested by my family). Great recipe! Thanks!
