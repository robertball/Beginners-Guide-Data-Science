i normally don't rate the recipes i make from this site as so many already have before me.  this was the recipe of the day  and so i tried this when it had no ratings yet.  i did not have dried apricots so i used apricot jam instead (so i got the flavor and it was a little more saucy too).  otherwise i made it exactly as written -  and the flavors came together really nicely.  in short, we LOVED it!  It was also easy to make.  I'm not even a huge shrimp fan but i would make this again in a heartbeat.   thank you for this recipe!   PS:  just ate the leftovers the next day.... still fabulous!

We really enjoyed the flavor mix with these unusual ingredients for a shrimp dish. The sauce when thickened is more like a glaze than a sauce. Next time I will double the amount of the sauce so that there is some sauce available for the rice too. I forgot the nut garnish, but it was good anyhow. Definitely adding this to the repertoire, and it is pretty easy to make too.

Fantastic!  I did as another reviewer suggested and used apricot preserve instead of the diced apricot. I served with rice and broccoli and next time I will add the broccoli to the dish as we all mixed it together on our plates. Tasty and easy!

I made this recipe for my mom for Mother’s Day and she love it and she is a hard cretic to food.  If she make it and she doesn’t like it you won’t see it again!  This Apricot Shrimp Recipe is a winner in my book two!!  Sorry I have no photo to post of that dinner.  But, believe me, it was good and my parents agree.

It sounded good and I had to buy some Grand Marnier.  It was easy to make but it just lacked something.  I would add a little coconut or maybe some sushi ginger.  Not sure I will make it again.  I'll just drink the Grand Marnier.

easy dish to make..... I would add more onion and more shrimp.  I’d make again.  The soy sauce takes the sweetness away which is good.   The reviewer that used the marmalade what I wanted to know before trying is if they still used the orange liquor.   I would have tried had I known but followed the recipe as written

It was just ok. I was looking for a bit more flavor.
