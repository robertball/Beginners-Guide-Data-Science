Very good recipe.  I added onion, substituted peanut oil for the vegetable oil, and served it over rice.

This was good. The next time I make it I will use fewer carrots and maybe more broccoli.

It was OK...but I wouldn't make it again. My husband hated it...even refused to eat it.  I think it might have something to do with the honey in the sauce.  I can't see anything else that would give it such an odd flavor.

Excellent! It needs a bit more juice to make it "saucier" but that might be because I used too much turkey.

I thought that the sauce for this recipe would be good with a lot of different additions and will use it again. I used peanut oil and skipped the water chestnuts. I also served it over rice and doubled the amount of ginger.

I actually only used a part of your recipe: the sauce.  It turned out very well to serve with mixed stirfried veggies!  I used about twice the called for ginger root.  Thanks!
