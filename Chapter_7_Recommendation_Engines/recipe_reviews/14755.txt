everyone at my tennis club asked for the recipe! The oyster sauce seems like a wierd ingredient, but tastes great with the herbs.

This was very good and different. I had lots of zucchini and was wanted a new recipe for pork chops. I didn't add the oyster sauce b/c I don't like the taste of seafood. It was delcious without it.

Excellent soup! I make this for all new moms I know, along with a sald and loaf of bread. It keeps in the freezer and fridge well. If zucchini aren't in season, I use canned artichoke quarters. And for vegetarians, it's great if you just leave out the pork and substitute vegetable broth.

This soup is extremely good! I have made it twice now and the only changes I made were: 1.) instead of canned chicken broth I used the "Basic Vegetable Stock" recipe on this website (reallly good, and easy too!) and 2.) I also added fresh spinach a few minutes before the soup was done cooking. The spinach, in my opinion, really was the finishing touch for this soup. 

The second time I made it I used cabbage instead of spinach and it was also excellent, though I prefer spinach.

I thought this was tasty but my husband much prefers the similar recipe that uses Italian sausage as the meat ingredient.

Fabulous recipe! I made it as per the recipe but had to leave for about 90 mins so I let it simmer and it was delicious! My husband had 2 big bowls. We did think that there were too many spices in it though, I had to strain the broth for myself. Next time I will omit the spices and buy canned tomatoes with Italian spices instead. Instead of a baguette I cut up some whole wheat pita in triangles and broiled them in the over for 3 mins...crunchy, yummy and low calorie. We're looking forward to having the left overs for lunch tomorrow. Will definitely make again!

I made this last evening with leftover pork roast.  The flavors were wonderful, the soup was filling, and it was a nice change from chili during the cold winter.  I served it with 9-grain Italian bread.  Definitely one of the best I have had in a long time!!!

I used 2 chicken breasts in place of the pork chops but followed the recipe pretty much as written although I have used different proportions for the cheese, chicken stock and tomatoes. The soup is good even without the oyster sauce but adding it gave the soup a fuller taste. Thanks for this recipe, it's a keeper.

We loved this! It was so easy to make and took no time at all.  I used pork loin cooked the night before and it was fabulous.  Healthy too. Great with fresh multi-grain bread.  Thanks!

I definitely liked this soup, and it actually grew on me heated up. I had two medium to medium-large zuchinnis and this amount makes the soup pretty chockful of the veggie-- some people may actually want to add a bit less since the amount of broth I ended up with was kinda scanty in comparison. However, the only real issue I had was with the meat or meat preparation. I think this might actually be better with a pulled pork preparation. Might not be quite as economical, but I think you'd end up with less issues overcooking the pork and less possibilities of raw flour in your broth mixture when it doesn't necessarily need to be thickened.

When you coat the pork chop cubes it won't hold when put in the broth mixture and you end up just essentialy adding the flour coating to the soup so it acts as a thickener (I doubt this is on purpose-- maybe try flouring very lightly before frying). As I said, it tastes fine but then the consistency is a little weird. Be careful overcooking the pork as it tends to get a bit tough prepared this way (maybe I cooked mine more than 10 minutes, but I don't think so...)

Also, do add the oyster sauce, it really does add the oomph that many veggie-filled soup recipes are missing. :)

I didn't use sun-dried tomatoes because I didn't have any. My family loved it. But, I would season the pork before coating in the flour next time.

We all loved this! I didn't change the recipe at all and it was fantastic. What I really appreciated was that it was a unique flavor. I never used oyster sauce before so I'm sure that made the difference, yet it didn't taste like 'seafood' in any way.  We will definitely make this again!! YUM!!

I had my doubts about this soup mainly because I was using up left over pork from my freezer, but the soup exceeded all my expectations. Because the pork was already cooked I added some flour to the onion/red pepper saute to thicken it before adding the broth. At the last minute I tossed in some leftover raw hash brown potato cubes. Other than that, I stayed pretty true to the recipe. The finished product rocked. It reminded me of a minestone. I didn't even add the parmesan cheese to the first bowl but I will when I eat the rest.

I loved this soup. Very tasty, filling and healthy. I added some spinach at the end like another reviewer suggested and it came out very nice. I will try this recipe again and maybe add some potatoes next time to make it even heartier.

Made this soup with some leftover smoked pork loin that I overcooked so it turned out too dry. Found this recipe and figured lets try it and salvage the pork.  The smoke gave a different twist to the recipe and it was great.  Everyone loved it, even my 24 year old son who is not a soup lover.  Only ingredient I was missing was the sun-dried tomatoes.  I did add a little white wine  to knock down the salt in the pork.

Wow, Delicious! I made a slew of modifications, but only because I didn't have everything on hand. I didn't have pork chops, diced tomatoes, chicken broth or oyster sauce. I subbed in 32oz no sodium beef broth, 4 chicken bouillon cubes and 1/4 cup tomato paste. Fantastic recipe!

This is a GOOD Soup. Better than a "base" but definitely amenable to variation(s). The first time I made it, I doubled the recipe in the hope of having leftovers after serving my (adult) family of 5 (giggle, giggle; not a drop leftover). The second time I made it, I omitted the flour (which I perceived as being simply a thickener in any event) and, in order to "stretch", tossed 1/2 cup of PEARL BARLEY into the mix (rice would work equally well, as would a potato or 2 and/or certain tiny pastas). I used pork chops (as specified) because that's what I had on hand, but YES, I can see how sausage (in any form) would work here, too. I left out the salt (but left the shaker on the table) but did use black pepper, basil and oregano (while cooking) according to the recipe because that is how I cook, but I would understand if others chose to spice and/or flavor theirs differently. I, personally, am so sick and tired of sprinkling parmesan (and/or romano and/or locatelli) cheese over EVERYTHING that (second time around) I served the soup over SWISS cheese and it was a MAJOR hit in my household. In this regard, I'd suggest using ANY at least FLAVORFUL cheese (for instance AMERICAN, CHEDDAR, PEPPERJACK, GOUDA (especially SMOKED) etc.) I gave this recipe a 5 because, even after "adapting" it to my family's tastes as well as our BUDGET, this is, indeed, a keeper.

I followed the recipe exacty and it turned out great, and it's also very good after subbing the pork for italian sausage, chicken, or beef.

I don't know why you need "pork chops" to turn into "pork cubes."  Seems to me a pork loin would be easier to cut into chunks.  Poorly written for that reason.

I already had pork stew simmering in chicken broth when I found this recipe, so altered a bit to accommodate, but delicious!  I used vegetables I had on hand so added 2 zucchini, two freshly diced tomatoes, an onion, garlic, and about a cup of broccoli.  I also had fish sauce instead of oyster sauce.  But the flavor was really full and delicious.  I don't usually alter recipes so much, but I think this one is pretty flexible.  A bit of a "stone soup" with a oyster/fish sauce twist.

I made this two ways- first with shredded chicken because it's what I had. I liked it, but it wasn't much different than any other veggie soup I've made. Then I tried it with the pork chops- everyone LOVED it! Even the kids who turn their noses at almost any soup. Definitely try this with pork chops! My 5 year old son even asked for leftovers for lunch the next day. I did not have the oyster sauce though.

What a *SUPER* base recipe - 4.5 or better. Whatever you do, do **NOT** skip - or skimp on - the Parm ... I believe we had roughly twice as much as the original recipe suggests ... it truly moves this dish into the big leagues.

While nice on its own, I tweaked this a good deal to cater to our tastes the second time around: upped garlic to 1 T powdered + 2.5 T minced, doubled the amounts of sautéed onion & Bell pepper, added ~ 1 C super thin celery slices, 3T ground dry Ancho pepper, 1/2 C finely chopped Pompano peppers, increased oyster sauce to 3T while dramatically increasing the basil & oregano to 2 T and 1T respectively. Used large can of cherry tomatoes rather than a smaller one of diced. Added no salt or pepper - smooth rich heat from the mild chili peppers and plenty of sodium in the oyster sauce. All in all, I think this is one of the best dishes I've ever had ... very grateful to the originator for posting it!!

This was really good!  I didn't have oyster sauce, otherwise followed the recipe and it turned out great!  The pork was very moist and tender (I am not normally a big pork fan) and went perfectly with the rest of the ingredients.  I loved the tomato flavoring in the background.  All around great dish!  I makes a really big pot so I froze some individual portions for later.

As a working mom of 2 toddlers, I'm always looking for a time shortcut.  I followed all of the ingredients as listed, except I put everything into a slow cooker (I even skipped the browning of the meat and veggies--less pots to clean).  I cooked it on low for about 7-8 hours overnight.  The smell was delicious and it is a very yummy, savory soup.  The husband and kids didn't rave about it, though, so I gave it 4 stars.

Excellent soup.  The only change I made was I substituted 1 lb of mild italian sausage for the pork chops and omitted the flour.

I cooked it exactly as the recipe stated except I let it simmer a lot longer than 8 to 10 minutes because I wanted the meat to be extra tender and the result was a nice thick vibrant red broth. My eight year old didn't wait to ask for seconds, he got up and helped himself. He said I need to cook this every 6 days. Will definitely make this again.

Yum - delicious and very easy to make. My husband and I devoured the whole pot. I will definitely cook it again. I also added some kidney beans as I had some that needed using in the refrigerator, a nice addition.

From my mother's recipe, I make these changes:
I boil the ham bone with the extra ham, with 1tbl of sauteed garlic and spices to taste. Once that cools, I cut and dice the ham, after cutting off the gristle and most of the ham fat. (Our dog loves the fat and bone.)

Using the same large pot, to which I add a large can or bottle of V8 and eight  cups of low-sodium chicken broth, I turn off the heat and add fresh or frozen corn, two pkg's baby carrots, cut fresh string beans, zucchini slices, cut mushrooms, and sliced kohlrabi.

After boiling, I turn the pot to simmer for @ 30 minutes. Meanwhile, I cook a full bag of No-Yolk noodles according to directions, then use a colander to drain them, and add to the soup. 

The whole process takes @ 40 minutes, but I freeze it for about four more meals. When reheated, consider a bit of cheap red wine (optional), or more chicken broth or a can of tomato juice or V8.

Serve with crusty bread for a delicious winter and early spring meal!

Very fresh and light tasting healthy soup.   As with any soup it's easily adaptable to whatever you have on hand.  I left out the oyster sauce but added sauteed spinach and some canellini beans.

Not  a bad soup at all. 

My only critic of the recipe is that a 'pork chop' is not a unit of measure.

I made this using left over smoked pork loin and it turned out great. I did not use the sun-dried tomatoes as I am not a fan, however I did use fire-roasted diced tomatoes. I loved the flavor and the way this soup is a full meal for a light lunch and easy to make and take.

Enjoyed this soup a lot.  It is easy as presented but I changed it up a bit.  When shopping for some of the ingredients I found some smoked pork neck bones so I made a pork/veggie stock prior to use instead of chicken broth.  I also mixed yellow with the red bell peppers and like some other commenters added some fresh spinach late.  Like most stock soups it needed slightly more salt than with broth.

Great basic recipe, I usually make it with left over pork roast and tonight just made it with left over shredded turkey breast.  I never use the Oyster Sauce or sun dried tomatoes; however I always add the following, frozen veggies (any kind I have on hand, my favorite are the picsweet stew blend), three large diced potatoes, 2 cups of chicken broth and fresh garlic!!! We always put shredded mozzarella cheese in our bowls and eat it with crusty bread.  My whole family loves this, even the toddler!!!

I had a big piece of leftover pork loin roast.  I sliced it super thin, then into bite sized bits.  Added the pork at the very end, just to warm through.  Otherwise kept all other ingredients the same.

I will make this again as an alternative to pulled pork with a leftover butt roast. So the ingredients were the same but the process was slightly different as I did not have to cook the pork. Oh and I had a small chunk of italian sausage leftover as well so threw that in to heat and brown in the panbefore adding the other ingredients.   It was really good, and do not omit the oyster sauce!

Followed the recipe with few exceptions. I added fresh basil from my herb garden.  Pretty good.  I did not separate the ingredients as recommended but kept in a single dutch oven.  The result was a super flavor able  end product that just needed a pinch of salt and some cayenne.  

Unfortunately, I don't see this as soup.  I will savor over some wide noodles or brown rice.

The first time trying a new recipe it is made as written. How would one know what to change if not done as written the first time? We use pork steak instead of pork chops. The chops seemed a little dry to us. I have made this and shared the recipe numerous times. Everyone loves it!!!

Made it just as the recipe says. Was very good. I used a pork tenderloin instead of the chops. Just be careful with how much flour you use to coat the pork as this will affect the flavor and thickness of soup. Will make again.

I made this soup. I used corn starch instead of flour and used cubed pork tenderloin. I omitted the oyster sauce. Very tasty soup.  Served over rice. Yum!! Will add to the weekly rotation of meals for the fall/ winter.

Delicious.  I made an error when reading the recipe and only added 1 can of chicken broth.  So good we didn't notice the mistake till long afterwards.  Thicker was very attractive looking too.

This is very good plus healthy and low cal.  I used low-sodium chicken broth as usual and swapped out the peppers for carrots and peas added at the end.

The family and I enjoyed it, and I would make it again.  I had to leave out mushrooms and oyster sauce due to dislikes, but even at that, it had lots of flavour.

Great taste and loved the combination of zucchini and mushrooms. Only change was to hold the mushrooms out and cook them for only a few minutes. Will definitely be making it again.

We grilled pork chops and as I knew we had too many-found this recipe. I am never one to strictly measure yet this one ended up pretty close. I had no oyster sauce and always hesitate to buy something for one recipe. Even without that ingredient this was great! My Mr Meat and Potatoes man loved it. Zucchini's were great. He added Worcestershire. I didn't in mine. Loved mine too.

This was delicious and I plan to make it again for sure!  I think the sun dried tomatoes  can be omitted and frozen corn can be added.  My family loved it.

My family loved this. I used leftover pork roast diced, and included the gravy. Other than this, I followed this recipe to the letter. It will become a staple in our house!!

A tasty and hearty soup. I omitted the sundried tomatoes (didn't have in my pantry) and made a few other changes. I used both zucchini and yellow squash and added a stalk of chopped celery, a can of red kidney beans (rinsed & drained) for color and texture and another 1-2 cups of chicken broth. When I make it again I won't dust the pork with flour. It really isn't needed and frankly 2 teaspoons isn't sufficient to brown the meat adequately when you use it. But a very good & versatile recipe.

Very tasty and easy.  This is how I customized it:  I didn't add the  oyster sauce because I didn't have any.  I had frozen grated zucchini, and used about 2 1/2 cups of it instead of the sliced.  I had fresh tomatoes on hand, and diced them up to use in place of the canned.  And, wanting some kind of pasta in it, but nothing that would overpower it, I added about 3/4 cup of acini de pepe.  But the flavor was the same as the original recipe except for the missing sauce, and it was delicious!

Fast, easy and delicious.  Husband and I loved this, will be making often. Did make a couple changes to use on hand items, sausage instead of chops, no sun dried tomatoes. Added some celery and cabbage I had to use up. No cheese due to dietary restrictions
