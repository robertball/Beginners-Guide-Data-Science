Exactly the recipe I was looking for.  This is authentic PA Dutch, just like my Gram used to make.  The big difference between this and other recipes is the graham crackers.  I skipped the tomato soup though, and added some pineapple juice to the topping.  I then put some pineapples on top the loaf while it bakes....yum!

I must say I was unsure of this recipe since there were no other reviews & I had never tried it. It was wonderful! I really only make ham loaf for my family because the other recipe I had made before was not what I liked, but I even ate this. It seems a bit wet when you put it in the pan, but it gets very firm & the moisture is necessary.

I wish I could have liked this...I was looking for something different for the family, followed the directions to a T and this was an absolute catastrophe.  I can't explain the very odd taste and the texture was grainy and terrible... the only bonus was the sauce (hence the single star.)  My family had to drown their ham loaf in sauce to choke it down...I'm sorry; will not be making again.

This is IT!  My late husband's ham loaf. This meal is DELISH made just as the recipe is written.  Try it before making any changes.  Certainly deserves a blue ribbon in my family's book!

Was very good. Mixed with hot sausage instead of ground pork, exchanged water for condensed milk and cut back to 2 Tbs and microwaved for 8 minutes. Great!

This ham loaf recipe was a good way to use up my leftover Christmas ham, but it needs onions and bell peppers in order to give it some pep.  Frankly, it was too sweet for me, but the family liked it.

Since ground ham isn't available in the stores near me, I bought sliced smoked ham and put it in the food processor to chop it fine. The finished product was delicious and is sure to be a go-to recipe for our family!

This was very a good use of the leftover ham made for Christmas.  I used a pork tenderloin for the ground pork and ground it all  using my kitchen aid grinder.  I added about 1/2 an onion through my grinder also as it was there on the counter from black eyed peas.  I split it into 2 pans and put one in the freezer with the sauce on it.  I also decreased the temperature to 250 degrees after 45 minutes and covered it as the sauce was beginning to burn.  I  then let it cook the 2 hours in the recipe, but suspect it would have been done at 1 1/2 hours.  It was just like my grandma's loaf and perfect for New Years Day.

Was so excited to make this. Not so excited to eat it. The graham crackers and evaporated milk were the culprits. As it was baking, it smelled like a wonderful dessert was in the oven. Unfortunately ham loaf is not a dessert! Put some smoke and a dash of cayenne to the sauce to kill the sweet - poured it all over the loaf and choked it down. Husband is taking the other loaf deer hunting...those guys eat anything!

My mother and I made this last night for dinner, EVERYONE who ate it loved it! The texture was great, the flavor was great, and the sauce was spectacular. My brother, who is a meat-aholic loved it! We made enough to freeze and last a while. Was super good, even me...who doesn't really like pork liked it!

This rating is really for the sauce.  I already had a traditional meatloaf made but was looking for a different sauce to put on it.  We really liked this sauce.  It was a little sweet but it made a nice change from the traditional ketchup or BBQ sauce.  If you don't like it as sweet cutting down to 1/2 the brown sugar would take care of it and still create a lovely sauce.

I made this recipe with left over ham.  It was great.  Definitely family friendly as I think kids would love this.  The flavor and presentation were good enough for a holiday meal or for company.  I used my Ninja to do the graham cracker crumbs.  It was not grainy as the previous reviewer had stated.  
The ingredients are so simple that the only thing that could give the loaf an off taste would be the graham crackers themselves; maybe hers were old or she used a sausage instead of ground pork..

Been searching for an old fashioned ham loaf recipe and Grams is just perfect!  I prepared it exactly as written was short on Graham crackers so I used a little bread crumbs.  Had some Christmas spiral ham, chopped it in my food processor came out fine. The tomato/brown sugar sauce Is fantastic .  Your Gram knew what she was doing!  My husband and mother in law loved it so I got points boo-ya!   Thanks for sharing Saylor's mom!

This was my first try at ham loaf.  I used our farm-raised pork products to make it, and it was very good.  The reason I gave only four stars is because the sauce was very runny, and I think the loaf itself could use some more seasoning.  It had good flavor and my 4-year-old loved it.  There are 2 things that I will do differently next time.  First, I formed the loaf into a sourdough-type shape, and next time I will make it more of a bread-loaf shape to hold in some moisture.  The edges just got a little dry.  Second, I will not add as much water & vinegar to the sauce; maybe only half the amount.  That way the sauce will not run off of my loaf and burn onto the parchment, which is what happened this time.  I prefer more of a thick-gravy, one that would stick on the loaf and get nice and gooey.  Overall, I will definitely make this again, but maybe add some additional herbs or fine-cut veggies to the loaf to suit our tastes.  Thank you for the recipe!
