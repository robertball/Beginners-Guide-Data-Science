Yes, this was simple to make and the outcome was very bland and eggy. We tasted it and my hubby, granddaughter and I agreed that we could not eat it. I was planning to serve this at dinner and I'm glad that I made it early in the afternoon because I had enough time to make another side dish to go with our dinner.
