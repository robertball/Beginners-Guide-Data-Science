I may not know what "an unfortunate combination of picquancy" means, but I can tell you that this dip is fabulous.  It's one of those recipes that I get asked for every single time I make it.  I serve it either or crackers or on veggies and it always disappears.

Awesome recipe!  I made it as an appetizer for my friend's birthday party and everyone loved it!  I didn't have any kalamata olives, so I used regular green olives and it turned out great.  I will definitely make this again.

I enjoy foods with strong flavors, but this recipe is an unfortunate combination of piquancy. The mixture of raw garlic cloves, feta cheese and Kalamata olives nets an end product that I do not care for. Nevertheless  you can save this from being a disaster if you 1) add the juice of 1/2 lemon, and 2) add 1 can drained garbanzo beans. Puree together with the rest of the ingredients in the food processor. This will change the dish into a cheesy hummus, which is tasty. However, the red pepper is still overwhelmed, and I would suggest using only 1/2 packet of the onion soup mix, otherwise your dish will be too salty. The fact that the recipe holds such a strong flavor even after the addition of 15 oz. of garbanzo beans gives you some idea of how pungent these components are when combined. It will be some time before I try this again.

Good. Everyone at the party thought it was delicious. I used roasted garlic to add more flavor. I think next time I will add less cream cheese and more feta and sour cream. However, I am not a huge cream cheese fan in general. Will make again. Taste great with pita chips and vegetables.

Not bad! I was looking for something different, this was it. The flavors are very strong even after setting 30 mins. I let it set overnight....much better. Flavors had a chance to even out and blend, seemed creamier to. I also used half the olives as I'm not real big on them and it still left plenty of strong olive flavor, maybe becaused I used mediterranean style? Think I will try a milder olive next time.  Served it with crispy everything bagel chips, loved it! Thought they really mixed well together. I was sceptical at first but it has definitely grown on me.......will make this again, since I've managed to eat most of it.  Thanks for the recipe.

I sent this to a party with a friend as I had to arrive late and everyone was trying to guess what was in it before I arrived.  I was attacked for the recipe when I came in.  The guys especially liked it.  I'll be making it again.  I kind of messed with the ingredient amounts as I am not real into measuring and it turned out great.

This was really good. I added a little less of the feta, as it was leftovers from a tub I had. Probably a good thing as it was very forward in this recipe. I also added 5 green manzillas, as I had no kalamatas. It was good overall, though!!

We very much enjoyed this very different tasting dip with pita wedges and veggies at a work potluck.  It was well received but far from a hit.

This was the best dip I've had in a long time. It isn't the prettiest to look at but give it a chance! I roasted my own pepper which made it even that much better. It comes out of the blender entirely too salty so you really need to let it "marry" in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to an hour. Once that is done it comes out lovely! I served mine with baked pita chips and those were a big hit.
