This was amazing! Like an upscale bread pudding, only a bit lighter. Made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it! There wasnâ€™t any left! Will make it again!

For a phyllo cake, i thought it would have been light and flaky. With the yougart egg mixture it was quite heavy. It tasted ok, just wasnt what my expectations had hoped for.
