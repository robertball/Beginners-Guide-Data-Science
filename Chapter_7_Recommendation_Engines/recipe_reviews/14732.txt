The first time I made this recipe, I thought the sauce was too watery at serving time. (I make it in a covered corning ware glass dish--maybe that made a difference?!?!) I've made it several times since, and now I always double the brown sugar, mustard and cloves, but keep the water at 3/4 cup.  I think it tastes richer this way.  We all love it. Also, I've made it both with fresh apples and also with canned.  Both are good.

After reading all the negative rewiews, I almost didn't try this recipe. I am really glad that I did. Here's what I did. I sauted the onions and apple slices in butter, then put them in my crock pot. Next I browned the pork chops in a little butter and cooking spray, and put them on top of the apple mixture. I put about 2 cups of chunky applesauce on top of the chops, then poured the spices (doubled) and 3/4 cup of apple juice on top. I cooked it on low for about 10 hours. We LOVED the flavor! Some of the reviews said there was no flavor in the meat, but using the crock pot let the flavors soak into the meat wonderfully! Try it this way and I'm sure you will agree.   Sherry

I also read the reviews to get useful tips - thank you users for your ideas!  I first covered the pork chops in chopped onion, minced garlic and pepper and let them season in the refrigerator all afternoon.  I came home from work, sauteed them in a skilled and transferred them to a baking dish.  I placed the apple slices on top and poured my modified sauce.  I used orange juice instead of water; added cinnamon as well as cloves; used prepared sweet hot mustard; added more brown sugar and added about 2 tablespoons of flour.  I whisked this all together and poured over the top.  I then added several baby carrots wherever they would fit in the dish.  WONDERFUL!  The sauce was thick like gravy, sweet and was excellent!  Although I don't like baked apples, they added some terrific flavor and I would not leave them out.  Make some garlic-herb roasted buttered potato chunks and you have a quick meal that can baked while you unwind after a long day at work! Definitely will make again!

After reading just the first page of reviews, it was obvious to see that people either really liked or didn't like this recipe.  I read through many reviews and these are the tips that I culled which worked great for me.  I replaced the water with apple juice (I think cider would taste the best though!) and replaced the cloves with cinammon.  I let the pork chops marinate in the mixture all day.  Since I was using small boneless pork chops, I used a smaller baking dish than was called for so that the marinade was almost to the top of the pork chops.  I cooked covered for 20 minutes and uncovered for 20 more (probably could have gone 5 minutes less).  During the last 5 minutes, I pushed the apples and onions down in the juice to cook.  It was a great dish this way.  The meat was flavorful and tender and the apples were delicious.  I think the onions were something I could do without if I didn't have one.  If you're not a huge onion fan, skip these - I think you'll enjoy it more!  Thanks for a great recipe!

These were the best ever, but i changed it a bit. i left out the water and used extra chunky applesauce and cinnamon insteas of cloves. Using the applesauce saved time from chopping the apples and makes it moister. this is one of my favorites

I thought i would give this recipe a try, as something different to do with some pork chops.  BOY was i surprised, both of my roomates LOVED it and went back for second and thirds.  I really liked the mixing of flavors of the onions and apples.  I substituted a few things, like spicy mustard and added cinnamon as well.  I also sauteed the apples with the onions for just a little bit just to help them acquire some more flavor.  This was an overall WINNER!

I suggest using thick chops, 1 1/4", marinating overnite in the sauce, and bake for 30 minutes at 425 degress. I also suggest using apple juice instead of water and doubling the spices. I made twice as much sauce (so i quadrupled the spices) in order to cover the thick chops. i used a clove-cinnamon mix and i also added some flour to thicken the sauce. Frenching the bone (removing all of the meat from the end of the bone with the back of a knife) adds a nice touch and the presentation is worth the trouble.

Wow! This was really Good!  It was quick and easy and my kids even loved it. Hubby and son went back for seconds and even thirds. I used a very cheap cut of pork steak and it worked great with that meat too.
I also thicken the juice the meat cooked in with cornstartch and poured over the top. Yumm yummm

I loved the flavor of this dish. The apple consistency was mushy, but tasty, and goes great with the onions. I would double the onions and cut the water in half because the apples add plenty of moisture! Would definitely make it again. Thanks!

I was blown away by this recipe.  I wasn't it expecting to have so much full flavor!  I followed the advice of a few people and added cinnamon, rather than cloves, omitted the dry mustard, and added 2 more tablespoons of brown sugar.  After cooking the onions in olive oil and setting them aside, I only returned them to HALF of the pork chops for baking, since my husband doesn't like onions.  We were both VERY pleased with this meal and I will make it again!!!

This is a pretty good starting point for the recipe.  It needs some "zing"... so I added about a quarter cup (it was a handful) of Craisins (the dried cranberries you can buy packaged), replaced the spice with cinnamon (I'll try it next time with the cloves) , and also used wet dijon mustard instead of ground.  I doubled the mustard and brown sugar- it added a bunch of flavor.  I baked as directed, but used 2" (double thick) chops- they came out beautifully after 35 minutes at 375 (I'm at about 500 feet above sea level in northern california, if you need to make adjustments for that).  Make sure to brown them well before baking- the sauce ends up rather runny, even after cutting back on the amount of water- but to "fix" it, I first removed the chops from the baking dish, then put all the leftover juices/apples/craisins into a sautee pan and reduced it a bit, also thickening it with a touch of cornstarch.  It made a great sauce for the dish- the flavor turned out nicely.  

This dish still needs a little something- I'd reserve one of the apples for a quick sautee in your pan that you browned the onion and chops in- the apples in the baking dish are rather mushy, but they add tremendous flavor, so dont leave them out!  Just peel and slice one up, then sautee it just to soften and combine the flavor of the pan- deglaze the pan with a touch of orange juice with the reserved apple?  I think that might be a great finishing touch.  Per another reviewers recommendation, I served it

Delicious!! Simpy delicious! Instead of cloves, because I didn't have any, I used cinnamin. I will definitely make this again. It's easy, it's quick and it tastes great.

Looking at the reviews of this recipe, I'd say people really love it or really hate it. No in betweens. The presentation was not attractive with the overcooked apple slices and onions on top. The sauce was moderately tastey, but not enough of it, and for the most part, the pork was bland even though I added garlic powder to the meat, and dijon mustard to the sauce.

After reading several reviews I decided to add cinnamon and butter for additional flavor.  I also stuffed the pork chops with seasoned bread stuffing with additional chopped onions. Before serving I thickened the pan juices with cornstarch. Both men in my family cleaned their plates.Will definitely use this recipe again.

Was easy to prepare, but too watery and too bland.  I noticed on many of the other reviews that they made changes to the recipe.  I have so many recipes to try and keep, this one got tossed.

I tried this recipe as shown, then modified it.  When browning the onions I lightly added flavoured sea salt, and the result was the flavours  transferred to the pork chops during their browning.  I also lightly browned the apple slices in the meat/onion residue adding a tiny bit of salt to the apples(apples benefit from a little salt during cooking otherwise they are bland.) I covered the seasoned chops with the apples and onions as suggested but before I added the sauce I combined the brown sugar, mustard and cloves reduced salt and WHITE pepper(I always use white pepper with light coloured meats) with a tbsp of corn starch and added the water.  It turned out much better.

I tried this recipe using country ribs in my crock pot and it was great.  I mixed 3/4 cups of apple juice with the brown sugar, ground mustard, cloves and 1/4 t. cinnamon.  Put that in the crock pot along with 1/2 C. chopped onions and added the meat.  Cooked it til tender.  Added apple slices the last 45 minutes.  Yum!

This recipe is quick and very simple!  The taste is very good for autumn, but I think that it would be good any time of the year.  My husband and I really enjoyed it, although there were 2 things we would try to make different for next time: 1) Make the sauce thicker and 2) Make the flavor more powerful.  (Instead of ground mustard, we used cinnamon.)  The pork chops were juicy and even though pork can't really be marinated, it had a nice flavor.

Excellent!!Would be great over pork tender loin.I used appple juice instead of water and cinnamon instead of cloves. I double the cinnamon & mustard and brown sugar. Once cooked I drained off juice added a little more apple juice and thickened with cornstarch....Extra sauce is great over stuffing....

So, so, so good. I stay close to the original recipe, except that I, like many other reviewers, use apple juice instead of water. I also add a tablespoon of maple syrup and a cup of cinnamon apple sauce to the mixture and add a layer of apple sauce to the bottom of the dish. I saute the onion and apples in butter with a dash of cinnamon and then brown the chops in the leftovers. I sprinkle salt and apple cider vinegar on top of them in the pan, and then I just sit them in the pan, spoon out the thickest part of the mix on to the chops, pour the rest in, and sit the onions and apples on top and let it cook for 45 minutes. I usually don't have a problem with the apples searing or charring in the oven. They come out neither too mushy nor too crisp; my husband raved about this meal and he can't stand mushy food. I was worried that it would be too sweet for dinner, or that it would be time consuming, but tis neither. It's become one of our favorite meals. Festive, too!

I changed it a little by sauteing the apple and onion in a little butter.  Then I sauteed six pork chops in the sauce pan.  I took the brown sugar, mustard, cloves, pork chops and the apple/onion mixture and put it in a crock pot. The salt was eliminated because it wasn't needed in my opinion.  Instead of water I put in 3/4 cup of unsweetened apple sauce.  I cooked it on low for four hours.  It was wonderful. Thanks for the recipe.  It will be a family favorite from now on.

If I could describe this recipe in just one word, it would be, "Wow!" At the advice of some reviewers, I used the same amount of water but 4 Tbsp. brown sugar. I also substituted 1/2 tsp. cinnamon for the cloves, and left out the mustard and onion. Since I used thin pork chops, they were done in 1/2 hour. I thickened the sauce with corn starch, and it tasted absolutely delicious poured over the chops. This is one of my new favorite recipes!

This recipe was delicious and preparation was easy.  I did brown my chops in a cast iron skillet, covered and transferred to the oven for easier cleanup and so I could enjoy the flavor of the seered bits in the bottom of the pan.

Although the thought for this recipe was a good one, the taste fell far short!  I think instead of adding water, try apple cider or juice and cut the liquid in half (if must have). Too much liquid made the chops tough and tastless, also add more spices to taste. Quite possibly leave out the liquid for best results!!

This was a great recipe.  Fairly simple and fast.  I did use some of the modifications from the reviews.  I added 1/4 tsp cinnamon,
1/8 tsp nutmeg, and 3/4 cups applesauce.  I also baked carrots and potatoes in with the pork chops for a good side dish.

I had pretty good results with this recipe.  I don't cook a lot and this was really easy for me!  I followed a couple other reviews and used 100% apple juice instead of water and I only used a 1/2 cup.  I added a layer of applesauce and cinnamon to the bottom of the dish as well as to the mixture to thicken it up a bit.  I also added some sharp cheese on top of the pork chops in the last 10 min of baking.  My husband thought it came out great!

This is good, but the onions sort of over power the apples.  Try adding much less onions...

Great change from the ordinary!  I did change the following based on previous reviews.

1.  Slice a whole large onion (do not chop) and cut apples in quarters.  This way they will not be mushy.

2.  After you remove chops, DEGLAZE the pan to get all the brown bits and yumminess.  I added a chicken bouillon cube to the water and also used a touch of marsala.  Reduce slighty and add the mustard (I used 2 tablespoons Dijon since I dont have dried), cloves, and brown sugar.

You can also take it another step and carmelize the onions to give another depth of flavor.

We thought this was crazy good!!!! I cooked only 30 minutes and it was perfect!  Thinking of making this a company dish served with Sweet Potato puree, Bussel Sprouts, and Red Cabbage.

I made these last night and they turned out pretty good. The pork chops by themselves weren't very flavorful, but the apples and sauce really made the difference. After reading other reviews, I changed the recipe slightly. I doubled the chopped onion, I used apple juice instead of water, I used 4 tablespoons of brown sugar and added 1/8 tsp of cinnamon to the other spices. The flavor was perfect. I hope they're even better warmed up tonight!

This was a great recipe. I'm a novice cook and it was super easy but everyone thought I worked really hard! I cut the amount of water in half and added more brown sugar and cloves for a stronger taste and it worked out well!

This was okay but I don't think I would make it again.  The "sauce" more water than a sauce.  Just not what I expected.

This recipe was easy and tasty - something that wows guests without a lot of bother.    I used slightly thicker pork chops and needed additional salt and pepper.    I also made the sauce with chicken stock instead of water to give is a bit more taste.  The dish needs a touch more "bite" so I would suggest additional mustard or a little horse radish.  I used Gala apples which seemed to hold together and still were juicy.  Some have noted that there is a lot of liquid left in the pan.  I treated that as a gravy and reduced it with a little corn starch.  The resulting sauce made a great topping as well as a nice compliment to the wild rice side which I served with this nice fall dish.

We loved this! Followed another review and sauteed apples & (dried) onions in butter; then sauteed pork chops, then put into slow cooker with spices/sugar. Covered with applesauce and a little water, cooked on high for a couple of hours then turned to low for maybe an hour or two. Perfect blend of flavors! Served with brown rice.

This recipe was DELICIOUS! I changed it just a bit, and think it was actually easier to prepare. I just sauteed the seasoned onions and apples in light butter and a bit of oil. Then melted brown sugar into the mixture. Then, I seared the pork for a few seconds on each side and only cooked it for 30 mins. It wasn't dry at all, very very good!

For everyone who had dry chops, you may have overcooked them in the frying pan.
You should sear them quickly,the inside should not be thouroughly cooked,they will finish in the oven. I added a little brown sugar while I was sauteing 
the onions, they will brown better, adding more flavor. A sprinkle of Emerils "Bayou Blast" also adds wonderful flavor.They were very tasty.

YUMMY!!  I didn't have any of the brown sugar on hand, but i used some light Corn Syrip instead and instead of mixing it seperate I threw it all together and baked it.......The pork chops were super moist and thses were thick ones too.  Loved it!  Thanks! Oh i didn't bother with the browning of this either.......just baked it i think frying it would loose some of its flvor and the moisture!

I read several reviews before making this dish; I followed other peoples ideas such as omitting the mustard, and doubling up on the brown sugar, and using cinnamen. I also added honey. People had previously noted the sauce being "Thin", however they should have compared its consistency to water. The overall flavor was good, but barely there. (Literally) Boyfriend felt the same. I will try this one more time, but I will use applesauce instead of water, to try and thicken the sauce up some. The thickening of the sauce may be key. FYI: DO NOT USE GRANNY SMITH. (Too sour for such a sweet recipe)

I took the suggestion from other reviews and added cinnamon - very good.  I also noticed comments about the sauce being thin, so I cooked it down a bit before baking.  I think that helped.  The whole family enjoyed them - no leftovers!

I enjoyed this meal a lot.  I followed some of the hints from previous reviews.  Instead of water, I used apple cider w/ 2 tablespoons of cider jack.  I made the sauce first and let the pork chops soak briefly.  I think next time I will marinade them a over night.  The only other suggestion would be to make the sauce thicker. Other than that, it was a hit w/ my picky boyfriend. --Monica

Great tasting recipe! I followed the recommedations of others and doubled the spices, added some applesauce but could have used less water than the 3/4 cups called for. I used a cast iron skillet after the 45 minutes cooking time were up, I uncovered the skillet to allow the sauce to thicken a little bit. The only change I'll make in the future will be to slice the apples a little thicker.

My family did not like this recipe.  I fed my left over portion to the dog.  My 16 year old daughter did think the dog would like to eat her left overs.  So, needless to say we won't be making this again.

I thought this recipie was awful.  The pork chops were so dry and they did not absorb any of the flavors of the other ingredients.  To be honest, this recipie tasted like boiled porkchops with apple sauce spooned on top.  Neither my husband nor I finished what was on our plates (my daughter would'nt even try it) and the rest went in the garbage.I will NEVER make this again.

Absolutely delicious! I can't wait to make this again. Only reason it's not 5 stars is because the meat wasn't really tender. But maybe that's my fault... ;)

I was looking for a recipe to entice my father-in-law, who is going through chemo for advanced cancer, to eat. This did it! I left off the onions, because of the gas they generate as he has horrible problems with it and cooked it in my crockpot. I was running behind, so I browned the boneless chops and threw them in the crock while it was heating and mixed some of spices with enough applesauce to just cover them. (I salted & peppered before browning.) I only had Fuji apples, and 1 reviewer who used them did not have good results, so a quick trip to the store and I got red delicious apples. Brought them home, peeled, cored and sliced using food processor, sauted in butter, poured over the chops and then sprinkled cinnamin, cloves & nutmeg over them and let them cook. They were very tender and Dad actually ate a 2nd chop! My hubby liked them too as did everyone else. Thank you MNKENNEY for a recipe that even cancer patients with little to no appetite can enjoy and is healthy for them as well! UPDATE: I used apple cider instead of water and put all he spices and brown sugar in it and marinated in the frig. I only meant to do it for 2 hours, but something came up and it was 24 hours before I could cook it. Wow! This was soooo tender and the apple taste was all through it. I cheated and used apple pie filling instead of slicing apples myself, adding them in the last 15 minutes. They were great!

This was very good, but I realized that I prefer a more savory flavor with my pork rather than sweet. Everything tasted great, it's simply on the sweet side. That being said, I would definitely serve this to company.

This was very good! I sprayed butter on the top of the chops, then covered with the sugar mix, a few chopped pecans, and apples. I left out the water because I don't like pork chops swimming in juice. Will definitely make again!

My husband made this so he gets the credit. It turned out good... for those of you who find it dry I think maybe you were browning them too long? Let the oven do most of the work and its nice and moist.

The recipe was good using the recommendations by Sherry regarding using the slowcooker method and doubling spices, replacing water with Apple juice and adding Apple Sauce. The only difference is I only use 1 cup of apple sauce. Yummy! I'll make it again. I'm serving it with Stuffing and Sugar Snap peas.

I really hate to be negative, but I would just like to warn others....my husband will eat just about ANYTHING, but he would not finish this dish.  I am also not very picky, but I felt like this took FAR more effort than it was worth and I had even doubled the spices as others had suggested.  Not only does it taste bland, but it just seems to ruin the natural flavor of the meat.

My chops were very juicy. My children ate every bite and asked for more, even the picky one! My husband enjoyed them too. We will make this again.

I didn't really like this recipe. My husband liked it ok. I didn't like the 
flavor/consistency of the apples when it was done. The meat was good. I will
probably not make it again.

A very picky child, hot dogs & cheese.  She ate a whole chop.  After reading some of the reveiws, I changed things a bit.  I used applesauce(about 1 cup) with 3 T. water, cinnamon, brown sugar and dried minced onions.  I baked covered for 30 minutes and uncovered for 15 minutes.  I put the chops on a warm platter and thickened the drippings with a little corn starch in the microwave.  This is one we will be doing again and again!  Thanks Marie, my teenager says this one ROCKS!

Made this the other night and it was delicious. I made it I guess a bit differently as I made a whole pork loin and had it cooking the crock pot during the day.  Cut it into chops, browned them and placed the onions and apples and sauce in oven.  The chops were so moist and delicious.  The liquid is thin, but is meant to flavor while cooking-not to put on top as a sauce.  The apples cook down and basically become applesauce on top.  Great recipe and great for fall!

Excellent!  I followed the advice of some other commentators and cooked the apple with the onion.  Used water, a little less than the recipe called for, and wholegrain mustard instead of ground.  And added cinnamon to the spice mix.  Tasty pork chops, definitely a keeper!

The cloves are overpowering and make it very unenjoyable, especially since it's covered during cooking.   The cloves infuse into the apples, onions & sauce causing the spice to over-shadow any of the other ingredients in the dish.  The pork however, is very tender. Rinsed the sauce off the chops & they were tolerable; This is not a keeper.

After reading other reviews, I doubled the brown sugar, added 1 tsp of cinnamon, and still used the 1/8 tsp of cloves, sprinkled pepper and garlic salt on the chops and used apple cidar. The dish was delicious and we ate it all.

I used the crockpot to slowcook mine.  They were terrific, but I don't recomment eating the apples they were really mushy.  I might try quartering my apples next time instead of slicing.  Adding apple juice instead of water made a big difference also.  I will surely use this again.

This was just ok. The pork chops were bland. I think it would be better to marinate the chops for a few hours in a sweet sauce with apple pie spice then sear and bake them for additional flavour.

This recipe was very easy, with very few ingredients.  However, I have to agree in part with CHEMROSE, who suggested making the sauce separately.  The sauce, while pleasantly sweet and tasty (if you like cloves), did not penetrate the meat, but overpowered it, so we could not actually taste the meat itself -- it could have been anything under the sauce.  It didn't need so much water, as the apples provided a lot.  The cooking time is a little too long for "sirloin cutlets." I cooked three of them only 30 minutes, and the meat was just a little tough.  I might try it again by cooking the cutlets coated with flour, and maybe also with egg and panko bread crumbs (saw this in another recipe), with the onions and apples on the side.

I've never made pork chops with apple before. It was very flavorful. I am generally not too keen on eating any fruit that is incorporated into a recipe but the apples smothered over the pork chops made this dish excellent!

This is the third time I have received this recipe as the Daily Dish and unfortunately I made it the first two times, not recognizing it the second time.  This is the only time I have made a recipe from this site that didn't taste good.  We thought this was so bad that my kids wouldn't eat it and I could barely get it down.

Well, mixed reviews at my house. I read many of the reviews prior to preparing this dish and took some of the advice. I marinated the chops in the apple juice and spices for several hours. I used both cinnamon AND cloves. To me, the chops were nothing special...I did not taste any of the apple flavor at all. My family enjoyed them very much and declared them very tasty. After reading the reviews, it seems that this dish just hits some as wonderful and some as so-so....same as at my house. It DID smell wonderful while cooking...a good Fall dish.

Although this was an easy recipe to prepare, this wasn't a "five star". Maybe a thicker sauce would have made a difference, at least to my family.

This was not a bad recipe, but it didn't "wow" me.  I found it a bit bland.  If I had some pork chops and apples on hand I WOULD make it again, but I don't think I would go out and buy pork chops and apples in order to make it.  My husband liked it more than I did though.

Thought this was average but will try it again.  The sauce was too runny but had a really good flavor (definietly use apple juice instead of water).  Make sure you use thick pork chops & bake for 30-35 minutes.

Wonderful FLAVOR. I followed the recipe 'as written' w/ one exception. Apples are not in season in April.  I some leftover 'fried' Apples. I also used 'Minced' Onions (I soak them in water for a few minutes to soften) they saved chopping time.
The consistency of the 'fried' Apples made for a wonderfully thick 'topping'.  CLOVE is the Magic in this recipe. The chops were done in 30minutes.  don't understand what others wrote.  I used 3/4" boneless center cut CHOPS. They were moist and juicy.  A definite KEEPER.

I had expected the pork chops to be busting with flavor. My family asked me to never cook them again. They felt that this recipe lacked flavor.

I was really looking forward to doing this recipe and was slightly disappointed.  The preparation was easy enough but I found that the chops has little flavor and no real pop.

Although it tasted as if something was missing..this recipe was good.  It kept the chops from drying out and gave it a good flavor.  I didn't use any cloves since I was out..perhaps that is what was missing..but will investigate further.

We really liked this variation on pork chops.  We scaled the recipe for 2 people, but found that the cooking time was a little too long.  We'll definitely make this again, but check it earlier for doneness!

I read the reviews before trying this recipe, so made a few changes.  I substituted orange juice for about half of the water, and added a teaspoon of cornstarch to help thicken the sauce as it cooked. I also increased the brown sugar as someone suggested and added a bit of cinnamon. This was just delicious.  Next time I'll throw in another apple, as they tasted incredible cooked in this sauce.  Definitely a keeper.

I love this recipe!  It's very quick and easy, and it tastes fantastic!!  I just serve it with mashed potatoes and corn.  My hubby can't eat onions, but it tastes great even if you leave them out.  Lovely for fall and winter.

As with other reviews I think Cinnamon adds greatly to the taste with a slight reduction in cloves.  This was my first try using Myreceipt.com and if this one is any indication I will be using it alot.

This was very good.  I used apples and pears, and as I was out of cloves I used a little cinnamin which my kids love.  Pork stayed very moist.  Next time I will use boneless chops.

Very tasty and wonderful aroma while cooking.  I followed suggestion of one of the reviewers by adding orange juice instead of water. I also added cinnamon and 2 Tablespoons of flour.  I sliced some sweet potatoes and added them to cook along with the pork chops.  Served with a side of baked beans.  Everyone loved it!

I think the word my family used was "these rocked!" These turned out better then I had expected! I did use butter instead of vegetable oil and added a few tablespoons of corn starch as suggested by another person's review. The corn starch made the sauce perfect, almost the consistently of applesauce! These were fantastic and I will be making them again....I am sure by request!

This was a delicious recipe.  It came out great.  I used 1 tablespoon Splenda brown sugar and I didn't have any cloves so I used a little cinnamon and it was really yummy.  I will definitely make it again.  Definitely worth making and very simple to do.

This just didn't work.  I only baked this for 30 minutes and the pork was overcooked and the apples were undercooked.  It was way too much liquid, and not nearly enough flavor.  I do like the idea of combining these ingredients, but it needs a thicker sauce.

Yummy!  I followed a combination of suggestions and paired this with boxed Cranberry stuffing.  My family loved it!  I doubled the brown sugar, used 1/8 tsp cloves, 1/8 tsp cinnamon.  I heated the water in the microwave, added the spices and gradually mixed in some flour to thicken everything up.  I also used canned apples.  The chop dish came out a bit sweet for my liking (the hubby really enjoyed it) so the salty stuffing helped balance the meal.  I'm sure we'll be making it again.

MMM! These were good! Very juicy and tasty. The apples were a bit mushy, but still tasted good. I might cut the water down, though, as it seemed to be too much. I made the recipe just as written (important to do if you're going to review it!) and definitely would make them again.

YUMMY!  Modified a bit as suggested by others. I made this in the crock pot, marinated in apple sauce, added cinnamon, no water or cloves. My young daughter and husband LOVED it too. We put the extra apples and sauce over plain baked potatoes.

This was an amazing dish. I made a couple of changes. I added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to the recipe. I also left out the water and replaced it with 1/2 cup apple sauce. I marinated the portk chops in the apple sauce and spices overnight and then baked it. The were wonderful.

Made this last night in the slow cooker according to another reviewers recommendation.  I thought it was pretty good, but my husband didn't care for it at all but I think it was the flavor combination and nothing specific to the recipe.

I really love apple pork chops. I use several different recipes when I combine pork with apples for new flavors. This was a good recipe and I would recommend it. It could use a little more flavor in the chops themselves, though.

Personally I didn't really care for this recipe...nothing against the recipe I think if apple pork chops are your kind of thing this is probably a great recipe...it just wasn't for me.  I did make some major mistakes while making this I over browned the meat and then left it in the oven too long, so it was extremely dry. Plus I think I should have used a different type of apple, I think I may have used fuji apples.  What apples should I use to bake something like this?

This is a good recipe, but the sauce is too runny and needs to be thickened.  I added two tablespoons of flour, but that still wasn't enough as I ended up having what looked like pork chops in water.  I will add more flour next time or possibly try cornstarch.

This was to die for.  I used apple cider for water and double the spices by suggestion of another viewer and it was good.  I'd use less cloves and a little cinnamon next time.  Served it with scalloped potatoes and it was fabulous.  I did think it could cook a little more and left it in another 15 min.  I can't wait to make again.

When I make chops I usually use apples and cider vinegar but I cant stand the smell, so I thought this recipe would be a nice change.  It was pretty good, but not enought flavor.  Next time I will maranade in cider vinager then follow the recipe.

These were very blah and tough even after 45 minutes. There wasn't enough sugar or mustard or anything to make any flavor. It might have been better had the sauce caramelized but I guess it can't do that if it's covered. We ate it but I won't be trying this one again.

Very bland. Pork was also dry and tough. The sauce was watery. Don't think I will make it again.

I made these tonight and they were great! I will definatly make again. I did change the water to apple juice and omitted the mustard to make a sweeter chop. Seasoning Salt complements the sweetness very well and next time I will sprinkle some before baking. I enjoyed and my family gave it 4 stars.

This dish was ok.  Something about the cloves on the apples baked on the pork didnt really mesh - the taste was nothing spectacular.  Overall this dish is fairly easy to prepare and cook but it wasnt the best thing I've ever made.

Delicious and so easy!  The only change I made was to use apple juice instead of water.  This was a perfect dinner as the nights grow a little colder and crisper!

What a great recipe for pork chops.  My husband loved this.  I have shared it with my family and it has been a hit there, too.  The sauce can be made into a very flavorful gravy.

I did not care for this recipe. Perhaps it was the apple taste with the pork chops. Sweet potatoes are much better on the side with pork.

This was ok.  My children didn't like the apples or onions on it because my daughters didn't like the cloves.  My husband who eats anything said next time just cook pork chops and make sauteed apples on the side.  The flavor just didn't penetrate the pork chops even though I used apple juice for the water.  Wasn't bad, just not what I expected.

My husband & I are always looking for new recipes. We decided to try it despite some bad reviews. Opting to use beef broth as someone suggested they did to liven it up a bit. It was no help. This recipe was just plain blahh. Like something you would get a cafeteria type restaurant. It's not on our fix again list.

I thought this recipe was ok but will probably not make it again.  I cooked it on top of the stove; the pork was tender, onions & apples were the right texture.  I used less liquid as others mentioned but felt it lacked something. The clove flavor was strong but I did like the zing of the mustard and brown sugar.

I FEEL SO UPSET FOR NOT USING MY SLOW COOKER TO COOK THIS APPLE PORK CHOPS, BEING IT WAS LATE AFTERNOON, I HAD TO USE THE OVEN, AND OMITTED OUT THE WATER, AND USED APPLE JUICE AND MOTT'S APPLESAUCE, AND A COUPLE OF GARLICS, AND ALL THE SAME INGREDIENTS,  IM SAD IT DIDNT REALLY COOKED REAL THRU LIKE IT DID WITH MY SLOW COOKER/CROCK POT,( I MADE THIS BEFORE IN THE SLOW COOKER). AFTER FRYING THE PORK CHOPS., I THEN BAKED IT FOR AN HOUR, STILL, IT DIDNT REALLY FALL OFF THE BONE LIKE IT DID WITH MY CROCK POT, WELL, IT WAS STILL GOOD BUT WOULD BE 100% BETTER IN MY CROCK POT!!! NO WORRY, I WILL MAKE THIS DELICIOUS RECIPE, BUT IN MY CROCK POT!!!!

I REALLY enjoyed this recipe!  Simple to make, and ingredients that most people have on hand.  The only thing I didn't have was the cloves, so I substituted nutmeg.  I also thought that the sauce looked a little thin as I was making it, so I added some flour to give it some body, and it turned out great!  This will certainly be added to my repertoire!  Thanks, Marie!

Excellent!!! I used thick boneless chops and seasoned them with garlic and onion powders before browning. I made the sauce with 1/2C brown sugar, 1tsp ground mustard, 1/2tsp cinnamon, 1 1/2C apple juice and 2tbsp flour. I then put the chops into an 8in square pan, this way the sauce came right up to the top of the meat. I ended up removing the foil and baking them for an additional 15 mins at 450 to make sure they were cooked through. This made them *very* tender and juicy - and didn't harm the apples at all (we don't care for onions, so I skipped those). I served with stuffing and the "sautéed apples" recipe from this site and everybody, 3 small children included, raved! I think next time I will skip the baked apples and serve the sautéed right on top of the chops, as we ended up using that sauce as dip for the meat anyway.

We really like this recipe.  The meat comes out tasty and moist.  I don't consider the liquid it cooks in anything other than a medium to add flavor and moisture so I don't care that it is 'thin'. We also don't eat the mushy apples - just love the flavor that they impart.  I prefer Granny Smith apples for this recipe. I added this to 'Family Favorites' in my recipe box.  The ground cloves really add a great zing. As suggested, I have used apple juice instead of water. Either way works well. 

I used my slow cooker once for two hours after browning the chops - only because I wasn't sure what time dinner would be and it's easier to keep food warm that way.  My husband loves this recipe.

I did the chops in a cast iron skillet and was then able to just add the onions and apples to the skillet and stick it in the oven without dirtying another baking pan.  The marinade I did without cloves and it turned out great.  Very tasty.

The apples were the best part of this dish. The pork chops seemed to lack enough flavor for me. It definitely helped to eat a bite with some of the apples. I think I'll try this recipe again but I'll let the chops marinate for at least an hour next time.

This recipe is really easy to make and tastes delicious!! It has an awesome flavor and left-overs are even better. It doesn't have a thick gravy type sauce which is fine because all the flavor is already in the pork chop and it's very juicy. Thank you Marie!

Very good! I comined everything according to the directions, put it in my crock pot and cooked it for approx 10 hours. I had it on high, but I think that low would be fine. I also substituted ground cinnamon for the ground cloves. I doubled all of the spices. Great on top of boiled potatoes.

This was delicious. Even my 3 year old ate it!!The pork really took on a nice flavor and came out very tender. I doubled the sauce (using 1/2 water & 1/2 apple juice) and added dried cranberries. Sauce was thin but still very good. Finally a pork chop recipe that's a keeper!!! Thanks Marie!!

This recipe was a hit! Lots of comments on the wonderful aroma, too!  I used only 1 Tbs of oil and substituted orange juice for the water.  I baked for 45 minutes, they ended up a little chewy.  Next time only 30 minutes and they'll be absolutely perfect!

This is probably 4 stars as described, but I think I"ve improved it to 5 maybe 6 stars. I added mushrooms to the onion saute and substituted APPLEJACK (apple liquer) for the water.It was outstanding. Enjoy!

Excellent.  I will make this again.   The sauce was a little runny.  I like the idea of thickening it with cornstarch.

This had a great taste but was much too watery.  Next time, and there WILL be a next time, I will thicken the sauce to make a gravy and serve it on noodles.  The chops were tender as could be!  YUMMY.......

This recipe is fairly easy to make, but is relatively bland in flavor.  I added minced garlic to give the meat a bit of a boost. The cloves will give the chops a nice aroma and hint of flavor.  If you're anticipating a strong apple taste, it simply won't be there.

I loved this recipe.  The pork chops and apples go great together and it is really easy to make!!!
I substituted applesauce for the hot water and added more onions.  It doesn't need to bake that long.  I will make it again!!!

This was a good recipe - not our very favorite, but I think it would be a good one to keep in the recipe box!  It is a mild-tasting dish that nobody objected to, and was a nice change of pace from some of the other pork chop dinners I serve.

.My whole family really enjoyed this - lots of flavor.  I used thinner, boneless chops, and it turned out good.  I used 1/2 tsp of Chinese Five Spice instead of the cloves - yummy.  Next time I will cut the amount of oil and water down by one half.

This dish was good but it does need something else.  I will try it again and add the cinnamon and maybe more apples.  I don't know if I liked the apples and onions together.  Overall it was a good dish and my husband enjoyed it a lot.

I think this recipe is way too bland and needs something. The "sauce" or broth that it cooked in seemed watery, adding little to the dish.  The watery broth made the chops taste as if they had been boiled.  This needs work!

A very tasty dish. A bit time-consuming at first, but then you just coast until dinner comes out of the oven. The chops were very juicy, and the apples gave the kitchen a wonderful aroma. We didn't bother peeling the apples and they turned out great.

This dish is pretty tasty.  The pork 
chops come out nice and tender.  It is
just a bit bland though.  I agree with 
one rater in that is needs "something".
It would be much better if it were more 
spicey-sweet.

I'm not the biggest pork fan, but I did enjoy these chops.  The apples give a light tart flavor, very yummy.  And it turns out alright even if you forget to skin the apples.  Whoops!

This recipe was great! I did take some pointers from other posters, but my changes may be a little too sweet for the average health conscious person! I sautéed the onions and apples in the pan together with butter, sprinkling a little brown sugar and kosher sea salt to speed up the caramelizing of the onions and apples and set them to the side once browned. I then browned the chops in the pan, adding more butter, a couple slices of apples, and a sprinkle of brown sugar. After browning the chops, I arranged in a glass baking pan and spread the cooked apples and onions on the top. To thicken the sauce, I made a roux with butter and flour. Instead of using water, I had some apple-peach cider that I used with brown sugar (omitting the mustard and cloves because I didn't have them on hand) and poured that in the roux and then over the chops once it thickened. I baked covered at 375 degrees for 35 min,  taking the foil off during the last 10 or so minutes so the chops will brown a little. I was sure it would be too sweet. my husband who hardly eat pork loved this recipe and wants me to make it again. Next time, I'll use either olive or coconut oil in place of butter.

I needed to make something different with pork loin chops. I wasn't sure to make this based on the reviews, but I gave it a try. I put a little extra of the spices, including cinnamon,and a tad more sugar.

It's true, this dish isn't something to look at, but it came out delicious! Yes, it's watery, but you will have the common sense to scoop the apples and onions onto the plate. Right?
I was pleased it wasn't dry, but was flavorful.

Great recipe for a nice fall dinner. I read a few of the other reviews and didn't add the water that was called for. Rather, I mixed up the brown sugar, ground mustard, cloves, and added some cinnamon. After I sauteed the onion and apples, (as suggested by another reviewer), I put the dry sugar mixture in the pan and let it caramelize just slightly. I put that in the baking dish, then sauteed the pork chop (I used one large thick cut boneless) in the same pan. Then I put it in the apple mixture and covered the chop. Baked it for about 35 minutes at 375. Turned out wonderful. I only gave this recipe 4 stars because I make changes and read some of the other reviews, but it is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

Sorry but this was kind of bland. Wasn't crazy about it. It sounded good, but it doesn't have much of a sauce...it was too runny. Probably won't make again.

I added a touch of cinnamon to the chops, they were great but the apples were too soft for our liking.

This was my first ever apple-y pork chop experience, and it was good. The flavor was a bit odd, but I think that was because it was new. My husband is weird about soft apples - so it wasn't his favorite, but my daughter and I liked it.   I took the advice of some of the reviewers and exchanged the cloves for cinnamon. The sauce kept the pork chops moist. I served it over whole wheat spaghetti noodles. Great combo.

I made this with bone-in pork chops. It was simple and easy. I am not a big pork eater, but my boyfriend ate three of the four and thought it was delicious. The apples and sauce were delicious. Four stars because the sauce was a bit watery. The pork chops were very juicy and tender because of the sauce however.

This is a nice dish to throw in the oven and take a nap.  I see some of the pros and cons the other reviews mentioned.  I sauteed onions and apples together and then set aside while I browned the chops (3/4 thick).  Put chops in baking dish and covered with apples and onion.  I was in super hurry so instead of sauce I poured in 3/4 cup of apple cider.  I left the chops in for 40 minutes and it was just a touch dry, but not much.  Next time I will do 30 minutes.  I pulled out the apples and onions with a slotted spoon and did not use the cider sauce.  I know others complained about it being mush, but I liked it since the recipe makes its own apple/onion relish.  I did like this recipe for the speed, just be careful not to over bake.  It is also a nice change from the usual pork sautee I normally do.  When working with thick chops a baking recipe like this is about all you can do.  Good luck.

When ever I read such mixed reviews. I have to try it... I fixed it for dinner tonight. I think I'm right in the middle. I didn't do it the way the recipe stated. I did my own thing. I used pork sirlon not pork chops. I carmelized the apples and the onions in butter mostly and a little oil. I added brown sugar, a little cinnamon and sugar, cider vinegar, and the mustard. Didn't have the nutmeg. Sorry, I have forgotten what the recipe stated..I floured the pork sirloin, added a little brown sugar to the flour, salt, pepper and garlic powder. Browned them, then added the apples and the onions. Did not make the sauce separate...I really don't think it would have made any difference. It was just okay. Nothing special at all... Would I make it again? Probally not. Hubby liked it, but he likes anything. I'm the critic not him...Try your own spin on it, if anybody is going to be making it... Enjoy..

They weren't horrible, but they were not great by any means.  Very bland and the sauce was thin and runny.  The pork chops also came out very dry.

Verynice. I didn;t have ground mustard so I subbed an equal amount of dijon. Also didn't have the full amount of cloves - I had run out and only had what I could rinse out out of my empty jar - the full amount would have been too much for us.

This was very good.  Both my kids and husband liked it and it adds some variety to the basic pork chop.  I followed the recipe exactly except I thickened the sauce by adding a mixture of cornstarch and water and then cooking it for 10 more minutes.  We liked the mixture of flavors.  Thanks for the recipe!

The recipe was simple to follow and easy to make, however, the pork chops were lacking in flavor. Tender and juicy, but flavorless. Maybe substituting the water for apple juice or something else might make a difference.

My son loves apples so when I introduced the apples with the onion he was in heaven.  Mine turned out great though I think the next time I will slice my onions into thicker rings.  It's really worth trying.

Didn't have ground mustard so just used a little more regular mustard instead.  Turned out  terrific.  Very tasty.  Also poured the extra sauce over some pasta, you could probably do the same w/ rice.

I may try this with white wine in lieu of water to give it more flavor and a less "boiled meat" taste.  Ease of cooking was nice.

My family liked it and labeled it "a make again recipe".  The chops were a little thinner than l/2" so I limited the time of browning to 1 minute each side and baked for only 25 minutes in the convection oven. I used home made beef stock instead of water. I agree with other reviewers about the amount of liquid - 1/2 cup would be plenty. I also used a 12" iron skillet for the entire recipe because the boneless chops fit nicely in this skillet.

I found this recipe in the AllRecipes CookBook -- which I really love.  I chose this one because I love pork and apples together, and it had an overall 4-star rating. The overall flavor of the dish was pleasant enough, but the apples were mushy, the "sauce" was more like a simmering liquid, and the meat was very tough and dry. I don't know how it could have been changed to make the meat tender- maybe just letting everything simmer in the pan until the apples were soft. In my opinion, I won't be making this one again.

30 minutes turned out to be a little overkill for my pork, so I will cook it a little less next time.  Delicious flavor.  Used gala apples.

I was in a hurry tonight and needed a lowfat pork chop recipe.  I chose this one because I love pork and apples together, and it had an overall 4-star rating.  I didn't have time to read the reviews, but I wish I had.  The overall flavor of the dish was pleasant enough, but the apples were mushy, the "sauce" was more like a simmering liquid, and the meat was very tough and dry.  I don't know how it could have been changed to make the meat tender- maybe increasing the cooking time, however, I will not make this again.

The flavor was okay, but had much too much runny sauce. I used nice boneless chops, but they did not have time to simmer and get really tender.
I will keep looking.

I was looking for a recipe with pork chops and apples like a friend had served me a few years ago, but this must not be it.  None of my family cared for it, so I shredded the leftover meat and the next day simmered it in honey barbecue sauce and had pork bbq in buns.

I really liked this and so did my family. I doubled the ingredients in the sauce except for the water. Also I used cinnamon because I didn't have any cloves. I cooked it uncovered for 30 mintues and then covered it for the last 15 mintues to prevent black apples. My kids really liked it. I can definitely see making this one again. Thank you!

This recipe was okay. I added a sprinkle of cinnamon on the pork before adding the apples & onions. My husband doesnt care for pork, but he had seconds. I wasn't as impressed.

I thought this was a very tasty recipe.  I covered the apples in a white sugar and cinnamon mix and let them sit in the refrigerator for a few hours.  I omitted the mustard and used applesauce instead of water for the sauce.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and the chops were full of flavor and very juicy!  Thanks for the tips!

I made the recipe according to the original directions. It was OK, but not what I expected. I went back and read the reviews and saw some  suggestions. Tried it with some of the suggestions (substituted apple juice for the water, cut out the onion, added a tablespoon of flour to the spices for thickening) and it turned out perfect. It has become a family favorite.

This is such a great alternative to regular old pork chops.  My entire family liked these, including my 2 year old.  I have one child who doesn't like eatting any types of meat but he gobbles this one up!!

It smelled great when browning the onions and the pork, but the end result was not very good.  We also at the pork, but won't make this dish again.

Found this recipe too much work for the results.
My family enjoyed plain ordinary Apricot/Pineapple Jam spread on the chops 5 minutes before removal from oven, delicious and sweeter tasting. Try it - It's better.

I also thought it was too watery. Not a lot of flavor. Maybe I should have used Granny Smith apples. My husband added more b.sugar to his pork chop because he could barely taste it...and he doesn't like a lot of sweets. I guess I thought the sauce would be a lot thicker...it's not.

I deglazed the pan with sweet wine and added it to the sauce.  Im going to try adding a juice instead of water next time.  Definitly don't add 3/4 c. of liquid.

The chops were tough and the sauce was thin even though I only used 1/2 cup.  The only thing that was good were the apples - we had to eat a piece of apple along with each bite of chop to add any flavor to the meat.

The recipe was fairly easy to follow but I found the pork a little dry. It might be because I used thin pork chops so next time I will try it with 1" chops. I didn't like the apples by themselves - but when eaten with the pork, it was a pretty good flavor combination.

I tried this in the slow cooker as mentioned by several previous reviews. Cooked on low for about 7 hours or so.  Being somewhat of a novice cook, I followed the directions as mentioned but followed others advice for more flavor.  Didn't work out too well.  My husband didn't touch it. I didn't find it tasty at all.  Judging by the other reviews, maybe I did something wrong and missed it.  Needless to say, we won't be trying this again.  I have much better success on other recipes.

This was a bit hit at my house. The apples were the perfect consistancy. Didn't have ground cloves, so I used my mortar & pestle and ground up whole cloves... very strong taste! Next time I'll thicken the sauce. The flavours go well with steamed green beans too!

Easy and tasty! I cooked it on top of the stove, and next time I will add flour or cornstarch to thicken the sauce.

Great Recipe!  I used half water, half apple juice, and threw in a handful of raisins and a handful of pistachios.  I even used cheaper cuts of meat, and they came out wonderful.

Very tasty but pork chops were a little dry - more sauce next time, I think, and probably higher heat/shorter cooking time when browning.  Probably my fault, not the recipe's!  I used Granny Smith apples - delicious recipe & will definitely make again.

I bought a goo dgrade of meat and this came out as I've seen in a couple of other reviews: bland and chewy. We threw out the other two pork chops as they didn't even make the sandwich cut. Sorry Marie...

On a scale of one to ten, ten being the best, my husband gave it a five and my daughter gave it an eight.  Both of them just didn't like the apples on pork chops.  I thought the apples gave it a nice, different taste.  I won't be saving this recipe.

I wasn't really sure we would like apples with onions but it turned out pretty good.  I did think it lacked something but I couldn't put my finger on it.  I forgot to thicken the sauce up and wish I had, it was pretty runny.  My husband said he'd like it again so I'll probably make it but it won't be a regular type meal.

I don't think there was anything real special about this - the taste did not blow me away.  Luckily it wasn't too hard to make and the apples took most of the time!

This was good, not great.  I used cider rather than water for more flavor and substituted cinnamon for the cloves.  I might make again but adjust seasonings for more flavor.

This recipe was a different way to prepare pork chops and it was tasty, however it was a lot of work.  Between all of the chopping and slicing, browning, etc., it made a lot of dirty dishes and extra work.  My whole family liked it and my usually picky son said it was the best pork he ever had, but no one except me and my husband ate the apples...which by the way, did not taste like apples anymore!  It smelled good cooking and looked pretty when it came out, but its true...they just kind of tasted like plain pork chops and I expected more with this much work and lots of ingredients.

I thought this was very good and did not find it too time consuming.  I did, however, make some changes.  Used cinnamon istead of cloves and used dry incredients as a rub and put it in the fridge for a few hours.  Also, replaced apples, because I didn't have any, for chunky applesauce.  My husband said " It's a keeper!!!"

It took a long time to make & created a mess in the kitchen.  I used thick 1 1/2 in. pork chops & so it took a little longer.  I think that the juice could be thicker (so I added some starch to make a gravy like.)  The chops tasted like it was steamed & very bland.  It was ok but my guest said they really enjoyed it.  I'll leave this recipe in my box & revise for next time.. Maybe marinate the chops before baking.

I liked this dish though made a couple of changes. I used 3 whole cloves and a tablespoon of reg. mustard in the brown sugar mix which I heated to the boil before pouring over the chops. I made six chops and it was quite good.

I thought that this was indeed a very tasty recipe.  It was not difficult to prepare and was surprisingly quick to put together although time was taken up by cutting and browning.  Overall it was a success.  A nice twist for apples and pork chops.

This is a delicious recipe.  I had all the ingredients on hand, so I thought I'd try it.  They were the best non-BBQ pork chops I've ever had. My husband loved it, too.  You must try it to believe it.  So quick and easy.  The only thing I would do differently is to saute the onions after browning the chops and cut down on the oil a bit.

Great dish!  I read the reviews first so I made a few changes.  I changed the water to apple juice and the cloves to cinnamon.  I also increased the brown sugar to 3Tablespoons.  my husband and 4year old loved it served over rice!

It was pretty good but I wasn't super impressed with the taste. I probably wouldn't make them again since nobody ooo'd and ahhh'd.

so so, but really bland, it needs something else with a kick to it.  But I did use a walla walla sweet and it made a huge difference.

My family enjoyed this recipe. The chops were tender and the apples were a nice touch. Next time I will poke holes in the chops and marinate the chops in the sauce for several hours. Just baking them did not flavor the meat enough for my satisfaction. I will also sprinkle some cinnamon and brown sugar directly on the apples. Definitely a keeper!

I like the taste of butter with apples so I substituted butter for the oil and instead of cloves and mustard, I tried 1/4 tsp. cinnamon and 1/8 tsp. nutmeg.  1 more Tbsp. brown sugar made the difference, it was delicious!!

I think some other reviewers were not able to follow recipes or maybe just couldn't cook as most of the reviews I read were favourable and I didn't change a thing and everyone - even my picky children loved this one (and I don't care for pork much).  Mind you the apple liquor sounds interesting; I may have to try that one!!  A great and simple recipe, THX!

My family really loved this recipe!  The chops were moist, and the 'sauce' went well with veggies (I served it with cauliflower, green beans and corn).  I'll definitely cook this again.

i think that maybe you could substitute apple juice for the hot water...maybe it would give a little more flavor...maybe also try a dry soup mix (knorrs veg.)instead of onion and mustard.

Did not have any Cloves of any kind so went without. The meal was a success.The chops were excellent. Just enough sweetness to compliment the chops. Apples were great with the onions. We had the chops with a baked potato and a garden salad. Absolutly outstanding.Thanks.

Made this dish tonight. It was excellent. I agree with other writers that it needed something but it's a great base to start with and experiment. I didn't have any ground cloves or dry mustard so I substituted with gr. allspice and prepared mustard. I think I can go heavier on the mustard and allspice. I would definately make this again.

I would definitely make this again. I did add a cup of applesauce  and  half a tsp of cinnamon and doubled the brown sugar to the recipe.  Next time I will add cornstarch to juice at end to thicken. I also added potatoes-cut in half inch thick circles to bottom of the pan.

This is definitely a keeper.  I was out of ground mustard so used a squirt of regular mustard.  Used old bay seasoning in place of cloves, sautéed celery with the onion and threw some asparagus in that needed to be used up.  Turned out great.

Thank you MNKENNEY!  Last night my husband said that this meal was one of the best I've ever made.  Considering we've been together for 34 years and I do all the cooking, that was a noteworthy compliment.  I just gave it a little pop by adding a touch of Sriracha sauce.  This was a delicious dish.  This recipe earned a place in my recipe box.

I....like most people altered the recipe.  I used two apples and sliced them and cooked them on the stove. I added sugar and cinnamon to taste.I prepared my chops with greek seasoning, salt and pepper and cooked them fully on the grill.I then sprinkled french fried onions over everything. a Great dish liked by all.

I made this tonight.  I added more ingredients to make it more juicy.   It was great.  The family loved it.  Served  with sweet potatoes smothered in butter, cinnamon and sugar and broccoli as our side veg.  Will definitely make this again! My little one even ate it!    Thank you!

I have made this recipe twice and was very disappointed. It was flavorless and the pork chops were tough. I will not make this again!

I used applesauce instead of apples, and got a good flavor.  ...I did have the problem that the amount of liquid (3/4 cup!) was far too much.  So I poured it out and reduced it and put it back at the end.  Next time I think I will just use less liquid.

I wish I had taken the time to read reviews prior to making.  I also thought the sauce was too runny.  Maybe next time I would try apple juice intsead of water.

We had this last night. The aroma of it cooking was outstanding! I did make it in the crock pot after browning the meat. Next time I will dredge the pork chops in flour before browning which tends to help them retain their juiciness.  I also added fresh ground sea salt with garlic.  It definitely needs extra salt or something else. Otherwise, everyone gobbled it up.

It tasted a little bland.  Try soaking the apples on lemon juice and putting a tiny bit of lemon juice in the sauce.  It would give some zing!  We had leftovers and the meat was better the second day.

No one in my family liked this.  I don't know what went wrong, since we all love apples and pork chops, but this combination was just (as my son called it) funky.  I think it may have been the cloves.

This recipe was just okay.  I made some very minor alterations, I used apple juice instead of water and because the sauce was very thin (as other reviewers have noted), and I dissolved some cornstarch in more apple juice and stirred that in to thicken the sauce at the end.  I poured the sauce over the browned chops and let rest for about 2 hours, then sliced the apples and baked.  The apples were a little mushy (but this really does depend on the kind of apples used), and the overall taste wasn't bad...but nothing fantastic either.

I liked this recipes a lot, thanks for sharing!  Like others, I doubled the sauce.  I was a little worried that my pork chops would turn out dry, so here is what I did: I sauted the onion, & browned the pork, then I put the pork in the baking dish covered it with the onion & then the sauce.  I let the pork marinate all day in the refer.  Just before I was ready to bake the pork I cut up the apples and put them on top.  It turned out very good my entire family loved it!

I would not make this again.  The flavor was bland, chops were dry and the sauce was far too watery.  I prepared the recipe exactly as written.  I guess I should have followed all of the other suggestions, however, by the time I go through that, I might as well search for another recipe.

Sorry, but nobody really liked these.  The "sauce" was the consistancy of water and therefore could not get into the chops.  The meat was also dry and tough.  I even tried some of the suggestions of previous reviewers: doubling spices, using flour in the sauce, etc. and we still didn't like it and we are not a picky family.

I was dissappointed with this recipe. The apples were so mussy, there was so much wasted sauce because the water never thickened and the chops were not very moist.   I will not make this recipe again.

This dish did not turn out as I expected,therefore, I was greatly dissappointed.
The apples were like apple sauce after cooking for the recommended time and the water never thickened up or really got into the chops. I felt as though that part unneccessary. Overall I believe if the recipe had a thicker, tastier sauce and the apples were just tender it may have hit the pallet superbly.

Bland if prepared as per recipe.  Next time might try with the suggestions, more spices, apple juice for the water, etc.

While the recipe looked good, the end product didn't.  No one in my family liked it.  I ended up scraping all the topping off to get to the pork which was dry (and I cooked less time than recommended).

This dish was rather bland.  It turned out nice and juicy, but there wasn't as much flavor as I had anticipated.  I probably won't make it again.

These were so good, and easy, too!  My teenager and his friend had seconds ... unheard of for pork chops around here.  Thanks, will definitely make again.  Yum.

I followed the recipe as written, except I doubled the dry ingredients. It came out a little tough after cooking it in the oven so I placed it in my crockpot on slow cook for an hour or so and it was delicious, mild but tasty!!! Will make again, thanks for a great recipe!

I chose to prepare this recipe because of it's nutitious characteristics - the fat percentage is more than tolerable, particularly when other lower fat dishes are included as side dishes.  I served brown rice and a broccoli salad with it.

I used inch or better thick chops.  After 30 minutes, the chops weren't even close to done, but at forty minutes they were a little more done than I was ideally looking for.  Monitor that oven time closely.

The chops turned out fine.  I used cinnamon as others have suggested.  As low-fat eating goes, this was a nice departure from fish, turkey and chicken.  It's a recipe I would prepare again and though I enjoyed it, I would put it in the category of just another option on a healthy eating plan.  It was good but not particularly outstanding.

It was an excellent recipe. The pork chops were very moist and tasty.  It was very easy to make. I definitely have this one added to my preferred recipe list. Thanks for sharing it,Marie.

This recipe was fast and easy! The onions and apples jazzed up a normally ho hum baked porkchops. I would make these again in a heartbeat. Even my picky husband (who isn't crazy about porkchops) thought these were great.

This smelled great but the taste was bland.  Unfortunately I didn't read the other reviews and made the recipe as is.  I agree with one of the other reviewers.... too many recipes too little time ... to keep this one.

We love this recipe for a Fall Sunday dinner.  It is easy to do and very tasty.  I usually do extra onion and apples.
