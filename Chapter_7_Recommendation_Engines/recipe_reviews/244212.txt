I made 24 cupcakes going by the exact instructions. The cupcakes tasted nothing like strawberry. It had more of a vanilla pumpkin taste. Next time instead of strawberry preserve I will use fresh pur√©ed strawberries. The cupcakes where moist but not what I had planned for.

I really like this recipe because the ingredients are easy to find when strawberries are out of season. I got lots of compliments on them.?
