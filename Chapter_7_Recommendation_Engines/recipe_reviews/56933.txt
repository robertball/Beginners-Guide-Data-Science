I froze my tofu (been in the freezer for a while). Defrosted it in a pot of boiling water for a few minutes.  Took it out and it was a tougher consistency--like grd turkey or beef.  Added fresh minced garlic (3 cloves), added some red and green bell peppers with the onions and celery.  Didn't have corn on hand. I chopped up some carrots very finely diced and threw that in the pot too.  I sauteed all the veggies for a while in some EVOO to get it nice a soft yet crunchy.  You don't have to brown the tofu, just mix it spices.  I added more chili spice (probably tripled it), added a dash of hot sauce, a dash of garlic powder, freshly ground black pepper and a hint of mrs dash hot and spicy.  Didn't want it too spicy but enough flair to go on.  Mixed all that up in the tofu.  It won't change any color...so if seeing the white bothers you, try marinating it in some tomato sauce or something.  I didn't care it was white.  Poured the tofu in the pot and let it boil for  bit 5-8 min and then simmered.  I didn't cook it for the time stating (1 hr).  Thought that'd be too long, plus I needed a meal quick.  Served this with turkey hotdogs for the family.  MMMM mmm mmm .  Leftovers the next day are superb!  Try this recipe.. simple.

This was the first tofu recipe I've ever tried and I loved it! I left out the corn and didn't add any extra water so that it was thick. I highly recommend this to anyone who is experimenting with tofu.

This is a delicious vegetarian recipe but uses way too much water.  I used half the amount called for and then added uncooked elbow macaroni during the last 12 minutes of cooking.

I,too, had to add much more chili powder and some chili flakes because we love our chili "Hot".  I also added some sliced carrots, green peppers and red peppers to give an alround meal.  I took the advice of others and only added enough water to barely cover.  I also added some green lentils to give it substance.  If some people find this chili too watery, add some rice to it which will soak up the moisture.  All in all it is a good chili and easy and quick to make.

This was quite soupy, and should be used, that way. I liked it enough to make again, as a soup. I may also experiment by omitting all that water.

We made this for dinner the other night, and, having read the other reviews, used way less water - only about 1/2 cup.  Other than that, we followed the recipe exactly, and it was delicious.  We enjoyed it just as much the second night.Great for those who think they don't like tofu.  Don't leave out the corn - it is essential to the flavour.

Instead of using the water called for, I added some leftover spaghetti sauce I had on hand, which gave the soup the thicker consistency and full tomato flavor I was missing the first time I made it. Also added a liberal amount of garlic powder, and twice as much chili powder, to kick it up a notch ;)

This is a great base for the recipe.  I didn't use celery (don't like it) and dumped in a lot of cayenne pepper and some Asian curry powder.  After all the warnings, I used only about 2 cups of water and waited forever for it to simmer enough.  My grumble is that the "broth" isn't very thick.  It's still really tasty, though!

I took tips from others, such as, adding more chili powder, garlic, cumin and bell peppers. I didn't have any corn to add, and I added less water, it really didn't need too much. My chili turned out fantastic!

An excellent recipe for those who might be afraid to cook with tofu or are cooking with tofu for the first time.  Based on others' recommendations, I didn't add any water at all because chili should be thick.  Tastes great!

I added curry, cayenne & white pepper, I think it would also be better with even more peppers & chili powder.

The taste was good, my kids liked it, my husband did not- he thought it was way too bland.  (He likes super spicy, though)I wish I had read the reviws first, the water was too much, and I omitted to corn, as well.  I will make it as a soup, maybe add more beans, more simmering time and more veggies.

Hum, where to begin.  As I started to make this recipe, I was worried that I was not going to like it, unfortunately I was right.  I ended up changing it beyond recognition.  I used two teaspoons of chili powder as well as a tsp of cumin.  Without it, it just didn't have enough, umph.  I cut way back on the water (I used 1 cup of water and an 8oz can of plain tomato sauce).  I also added diced zucchini, extra garlic and salt & pepper.  With that said, it turned out great.

I just made this and it turned out great! I did not have all the veggies it required so I used  mushrooms instead of corn as well as blackbeans instead of kidney beans. However, like the others said TOO MUCH WATER. I added flour half way through and simmered for longer, because it just seemed like soup. I also added macroni noodles. It turned out great and flavorful!!

This was VERY bland even after tripling the chili and adding some of the amendments others have left in the comments.  I would not make this again, it really doesn't resemble the taste of chili very well.

I am not a fan of tofu but I was given some.  After a little minor modification this dish was delicious.  I drained the beans and corn and used beef broth in place of the water, also substituted bell pepper for the celery.

This is a quick and tasty way to cook up some (leftover) tofu. It is quite sweet, so I think next time I'll use Hot Rotel tomatoes instead of the stewed tomatoes to see if I can make it spicier (and probably reduce the added water by 1 cup).  This time, I drained all the canned items and retained the original amount of water. I didn't have too much liquid in the final product; I simmered on high to cook off all the juices.

I really liked this recipe.  I made a few changes to it to suit my taste, but overall I think it's great!  A very good way to get unsuspecting people to eat tofu.

I had to do alot to get this some flavor otherwise it was pretty bland.  I even added some vegan cheese in my bowl before I ate it.  I also replaced the corn with the corn salsa from chipotle. They only charged me about $1 for two scoops.  I went to whole foods and got some spicy vegetarian chili mix.  I also added sea salt.

A rather decent chili recipes. I double the amount of tofu and chili powder and halve the water (since we want the chili thick)

This was definatly a treat when it came to tofu! I omitted the corn and instead added a green bell pepper plus I added some garlic powder. I also followed the others advice and added the elbow macaroni. Delicious! My 13 month old has been a very picky eater lately, so I blended some in the blender and let her try it.. she LOVED it! Finally! A healthy meal that she doesn't shake her head at! I'll definatly make this again.

I was looking for a good tofu recipe that resembled as close to a beef chili as I could find. 
I was very satisfied with my results!

This is a bit soupy... but you can just eye how much water to add since it's the last ingredient.  The flavor is really good.  The corn makes it a little bit sweet.  You can make the texture of the tofu more "meaty" if you freeze it and then thaw out in the fridge before cooking.  The soup is great served over brown rice.

This is too watery and fairly bland. Replacing the meat in chili with tofu is a nice idea - but I think I am going to try it with a recipe that has a thicker, more flavorful sauce.

This was great!  Took the advice and used about 2 cups water.  I also mixed the tofu/chili powder/garlic earlier in the day and let it marinate a bit.  I had on hand flavored chili beans and stewed tomatoes w/ spices, and it turned out amazing!

I give it a 5 for simplicity...I doubled the chili powder added cumin, oregano and 1 tsp of salt. I also used 3 fresh tomatoes and 1 tb of tomatoe paste instead of canned. tomatoes.

I substituted diced red peppers for the corn, used diced toms rather than stewed and trader joe cuban black beans instead of kidney. I did not add a quart of water.  I also stepped up the amount of chili powder and added cumin.  Fast and delicious!

The recipe on its own was very bland. However I gave it 5 stars because it is so easy to make and with a few adjustments was very delicious. I used only half the water, as some people had suggested. I also added chili powder, cumin, hot sauce and worchestire sauce to taste. It came out so great I made another bath the same night to freeze!

Why not use crumbly tofu?  It's already brown and looks like ground beef.  I used the crumbly tofu, flavored cans of diced tomatoes (garlic, basil, or whatever you like is already in it), and very little water. Turned out pretty good.

Had to add alot more garlic and chili powder.  Also added bell pepper and would've added cumin if I had it in the house.  Would've reduced the water ALOT. I was disapointed that the chili powder didn't color the tofu.

Quick and tasty dish. I added a little fresh ground pepper and a 1/2 tsp. basil. Instead of 4 cups of water I used 2 cups of vegetable broth. This recipes appealed to both me and my teenage daughter. I served it with oyster crackers.

Made this today and make some changes by reading others reviewers.  I didn't add all the water, I add smoke paprika, coriander leaf, and tomatoe paste for more flavor and I use firm tofu cause that was that I had and was perfect.

Enjoyed by many at a chili cook-off today, although it didn't win first or second place.  I left out the chili powder, and added a 16 ounce jar of medium-heat salsa.  That left the chili thicker  than I wanted, so I added a cup or so of water.  I used "regular" diced canned tomatoes instead of the stewed tomatoes.  It came out a little spicier than I expected, but I was pleased with how it came out.  I definitely want to make it again; it was simple and delicious.

I added salt, cumin, and extra chili powder.  Also used less water, and traded corn for extra black beans.   So yummy!
