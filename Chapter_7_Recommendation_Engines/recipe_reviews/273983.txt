I converted this to cook in my instant pot. Converting the recipe didn’t change the recipe too much, although I will admit I used a stick blender to combine the corn and potatoes. I did reduce the broth by 2 1/2 cups. Overall it has good flavors, but I wasn’t a fan of the shredded chicken. It just didn’t taste right in the chowder.

We had grilled chicken and corn on the cob this week for dinner and had left overs. This  recipe used both so I tried it. Made it just as written. It was amazing. Everyone loved it with some crusty bread. Even the picky eaters. Thanks for sharing!
