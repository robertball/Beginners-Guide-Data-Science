I liked it quite a bit.  I suggest at least 2% milk and use  2/3 of gallon because it was short on oyster ratio.  I only added 1 can of  condensed milk.  It tasted fine, but I'm not use to sweet and oyster in same sentence!  So may forgo next time.  Adding the celery soup wae was a marvelous idea.  AND guess what, It does taste better the next day!  I made it one night and we ate it because it smelled so good.  I saved leftover- it actually did taste better the next day and I liked the consistency better.
Thank's Paul for sharing your family receipe.
