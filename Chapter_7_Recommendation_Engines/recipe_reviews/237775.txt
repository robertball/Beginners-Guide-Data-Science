A keeper recipe. Unique in flavor, not too sweet yet has a natural, earthy sweetness-which is different. The pumpkin doesn't overpower the recipe at all. Though when you eat it on its own you notice it's got something in there.  It still tastes like cornbread just with that subtle hint of natural-almost squash but nutty-flavor that if you don't know it's pumpkin you'll have a hard time placing.  I used buckwheat flour to make this gluten free and frankly, couldn't taste it at all.  I ate this with lentil stew and it handled well when wet and didn't turn to mush as soon as it hit the liquid. I actually made this to be used in gluten free cornbread dressing for Thanksgiving.  Definitely try this out if you want something different but not too out there.  Thanks sueb.  A sure winner here.

I made this different, delicious cornbread to go with our New Year's Day dinner.  I had a small container of opened pumpkin in the fridge, so I made a half batch and baked it in the toaster oven.  The pumpkin added a nice dimension to the cornbread.  It was moist, but yet still had the cornbread texture.  I think this would make a wonderful bread to go with soups and chili.  I served this with 'Oven Roasted Ribs' and 'Classic Texas Caviar' both from AR.  Thanks sueb for sharing your recipe, we enjoyed it!

The cornbread turned out well as far as texture and consistency but the flavor was a little flat. Because I'm a pumpkin lover I would make it again but increase both the amount of spices and pumpkin.

I'll try to make it again. The pan I used was too small so it was too thick and didn't cook all the way.

Came out extraordinarily moist - more like a souffle. Husband loved it though.

Submitted sour cream for Greek yogurt and added more cinnamon and allspice.....next time will remove the oil and do a can of pumpkin. These where really good! Moist and good flavor, nice change for the regular cornbread.

moist but otherwise weird tasting and needed sweetness to complement the pumpkin.  Had to throw most of it out as no one wanted seconds

Very moist and sweet.  I added 8 teaspoons of sugar instead of the agave juice, which tends to upset my stomach.
