Okay, I only used the beer cheese portion of this recipe and made it with "Buttery Soft Pretzels" also from this site. The cheese part is AWESOME!! LOVED IT! I think it could make any pretzel taste great!! Maybe it was the beer I used but next time, I won't use the garlic powder...I didn't think it was neccessary b/c the combo of cheese(s) and beer was good enough!! The cheese makes ALOT!!! Will be making this for many parties and events to come!! Thanks Doreen!!(PS-next time, I'll try and find that dough referred to by the submitter.  I tried to find it in my grocery store but couldn't..thus I made my own pretzels. Anyone know a good brand I should try?)

This recipe is great.  I've taken it to family functions and parties with friends several times.  It's always been a real hit.  Instead of mixing the cheese dip in a food processor, I cook it all on the stove and serve warm.  It's very good and goes well with the warm pretzel.

The guests at our party really liked these - we did them in the shape of the first letter of the two guests of honor. I thought that the cheese sauce that went along with the pretzels was EXCELLENT and bought frozen pretzels to eat with the leftover sauce.

Ended up with a fun appetizer, but wasn't sure how thick the "roll" was supposed to be to form this pretzel.  Agree that the dip is great and is good with other dippers too.  Anxious to experiment with other cheeses and beers.

I took this to a party and got rave reviews. I used someone's suggestion of melting the cheese sauce in a mini crock pot rather than using a food processor - worked good.  I also shaped the dough into breadsticks and then cut up into more bite-size shapes after baking and put in a basket alongside the dip.  Will make it again and maybe experiment with different beers.

The bread was so good.  Everyone loved it.  It was fairly simple to make. The dip was good and I think would be great with other dippers beside the bread.  It had just the right flavor and was different than anything I've ever had.  Overall both were a hit!

Whereever I take this it is so popular.  I have made it 5 times since October.  And I keep getting requests for the recipe.  The best part is you can really get creative with the shapes of the pretzel.  And the dip is awesome!!

This was good, but the second day the leftover pretzels weren't so whoopy.  There was a lot of dip left over, and it was excellent on crudites.  I'll make this again, but may try a traditional pretzel recipe instead of the hot roll mix pretzels.  It's a great appetizer idea, though...not likely to wind up with two of these at a potluck!

I just made the dip portion of this recipe, but it went over very well at a party recently.  I actually used 1/2 processed cheese and 1/2 shredded sharp cheddar cheese in addition to the cream cheese.  Also, I made it hot.  I placed all the ingredients in a microwave-safe bowl, heated it, then poured it into my mini crock pot to keep it warm the rest of the night.  I served it with regular pretzels and soft pretzels that I microwaved and ripped into smaller pieces.  You will get requests for this recipe!

I didn't make the pretzel, but the dip was very, very good served with Pillsbury garlic breadsticks.  Very easy and quick to make.

I cannot tell you how many times we have made this dip! The pretzel is fine (easy to make) but this dip is just outstanding. I have to make two batches because my family just loves this. Any type of bread (or even crackers) would work here. As for the dip, I have never changed or added anything and I never will. It is perfect as is! YUM!

Make things easy on yourself and use breadstick dough in a can and twist it into a pretzel shape. The dip is sinfully good!

Everyone raved about the pretzels and the dip.  The dough was sticky and I tried adding extra flour but it became a mess.  I just ended up stretching it accross my cookie sheet and baking, then cutting it up.  Very good and fun to make.  I used Miller High Life beer.

The dip is wonderful.  So smooth and creamy.  You definitely have to use a food processor though- don't try to handle beat.  We served with a dollop of Rotel (diced seasoned tomatoes) and served with nachos and veggies to dip.

I only made the dip portion of this recipe, but I still feel the need to rate it. We LOVED this dip. It was fantastic with sharp cheddar and a Sam Adams. I can't wait to try it with other cheeses and beers. Every bit was eaten!

I haven't made the pretzels in this recipe, but I've made the dip - a LOT.  My husband and I love it - we just made several batches to take to the beach with friends!  We serve it with hard sourdough pretzels and it's wonderful!!!

I just made and served the dip portion of this recipe, but everyone loved it. I put it into a little crock pot and took it to a party, but I put it in too early - it congeals pretty quickly so I had to keep stirring it. It would have been fine if I put it in less than an hour before serving. Looks kind of gross but still tastes delicious. Fortunately the guys in the group didn't care what it looked like!

I only make the dip part of the recipe and I buy soft pretzel chips from a local bakery.  The dip is awesome and I have tried it with many different beers since my husband is a beer enthusiast.  My favorite to use is Chili Beer-a light beer bottled with a chili pepper in it.  It gives a little spice to the dip.  I have also tried throwing a habanero or two in the blender-this makes it extra spicy.

Yum!  I use this recipe for the dip only, I have a tried and true pretzel recipe that I use.  The dip is excellent-I warm it up on the stove and serve it from a mini crockpot.  Really nice flavor, so much better than just a regular cheese sauce.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

this was just okay.  not really pretzels, more like breadsticks.  We didn't really care for the dip (I tried it hot) but the bread dipped in pizza sauce was good.  Thanks for something different to try, but I probably won't make this again.

OMG! Heated both cheeses and garlic on the stove and let it sit to room temp while i threw store bought frozen pretzels in the oven for 4 minutes ... this was the best cheese dip we have ever tasted - bar none.

I did not make the pretzels because I had another recipe to use for those.  I did, however, make the cheese dip which I included in a basket of pretzels with different dips.  It was perfection!

The first time I made this I made the bread part of it into a round loaf of bread, no shape.  It is pretty tasty but the second time I made this I took french bread, sliced it very thin, sprayed with some spray butter and spinkled with some herb/grated parmesean cheese and baked them for about 8 minutes a side.  They were MUCH better with this dip.  This dip is the better part of this recipe, it is a very tasty basic cheese spread.  I too heated the ingredients and served it warm.  It was just as tasty chilled the next day though.  I also added some ground ancho chile powder to the dip too.

DELICIOUS!!!! I have already made the recipe 3 times and handed out the
recipe to at least 5 people since downloading. There is generally enough dip to
serve with 2 pretzels or with other munchies.

I made the cheese dip only. It is less labor intensive as my previous recipe and superb! I added some Frank's hot sauce for body and a touch of cayenne and served with club crackers. Wonderful recipe!

Did not make the pretzel part--bought pretzels to serve with dip. Did not like dip at all--had virtually no flavor at all--it's like everything cancelled each other out. Consistency was like cheez wiz, only not as good. No one at the party liked it. Sorry.

I didn't have time to make the pretzel - so I used frozen. Heated the dip ingredients on the stove vs food processor and served with the hot pretzels - was DELISH!!! Love this dip - followed the recipe exactly. BE CAREFUL putting in a mini crock - it will curdle.

I just made the dip portion of this recipe. We took it to the second of two parties we were attending one evening; kept it in a cooler for a few hours and then reheated in the microwave when we got there, and it was still great! Just had a request for the recipe yesterday from someone at the party. We'll definitely make this again!

This recipe definitely needed some help.  Great base, but I had to add many things to it.  I added green  onion dip mix, green onions, extra beer, and marinara sauce.  Was able to save it, but would look for another recipe next time.

I have made this many times for parties and it is always a hit. I find I need to bake longer than called for, and I serve with Cheez Whiz, as I do not care for the dip in the recipe. Easy and suitable to all kinds of parties!

I simply made the dip part of this. 
Husband liked it, but I didn't think it was anything fabulous at all.  Way way too much garlic.  That's all I could taste, even when I used a stout beer, extra velveeta and cheddar. 
Will not make again.

Very, very good - but not really pretzel-like.  More of a warm bread and dip, but still definitely worth making and eating.  You'll need to add flour during the kneading & shaping process, which isn't mentioned in the recipe.  I added a few drops of red food coloring to my kosher salt and shaped the dough into linked hearts for a valentine's effect.  It was big hit with my friends!

holy  this dip was awesome! I made it to go with 'buttery soft pretzels' recipe from this site. I threw 8oz neufchatel, 8oz Velveeta, 1/2 c Shock Top Twisted Pretzel Wheat beer, and a glob of minced garlic in a pot over medium/low heat. Once it all melted I transferred it into a serving dish. Going to make this exclusively now on for pretzel dip thank you so much OP!!!!

Yummy recipe! The pretzels turned out more like breadsticks but they were delicious! Brushed the bread with butter right before they were done. Baked the dip for twenty minutes. My husband loves it! Will be making this again!

I only made the dip as I was recently given some homemade German pretzels. This was a bit difficult to make in the blender as air pockets kept developing at the bottom of the blender. Once I got through the process, however, the dip was quite good. The recipe makes a lot of dip, so be prepared to have people over.

This is a pretty good dip recipe, but it is salty. The beer gives it a smooth liquidy texture. I'd use fresh garlic next time.

I made the dip and served it with the little square butter pretzels. Took it to a party and it went quick. Very well liked by the guests. Have made it twice now and will make it again. It does make quite a lot so consider halving it for smaller gatherings. It keeps well in the fridge for a few days also.

This review is for the dip only. I loved it. I used my own homemade pretzel recipe and it paired great with this dip. The beer really makes it. I used Michelob Ultra Amber. I think the food processor is a must but will try making it on the stovetop next time to see if it is easier that way.

I really liked this recipe.  The dip was so easy -and delicious!  My dough was so sticky though, so I had to add some flour.  Tasty - but still looking for a better pretzel recipe.

Everyone in my office was so impressed by this!  I used Killian's Red, and you can taste the difference!  The additional plus is that it is so easy!
