10.1.16  Spent the day doing yard work and didn’t feel much like fussing with dinner.  I served this BBQ sauce over half a toasted English muffin with a grilled ground beef patty topped with the BBQ sauce  and caramelized onions...hubs and I both really liked it!  It sort of reminded us both of a "steak sauce" served this way, but I think this would be excellent on grilled chicken or pork tenderloin or even incorporated into a cold Asian noodle salad.  We're not really into sweet these days, so I did cut back the brown sugar by about 25%, but that's personal taste.  Put your thinking cap on because it’s more than a “barbeque sauce,” very versatile.   Kelly Joy, we enjoyed your recipe

Added about  1/2 teaspoon chili paste for a bit more heat.  Overall, good stuff!
