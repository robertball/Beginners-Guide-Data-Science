This recipe is not only most odorous, it is most VOTEROUS too!  And by that I mean the preparation time is insultingly long, and the sheer amount of eggs is too much; my arm got tired from cracking them.

Here's an idea although the Calif. Egg Commission won't like it. Leave the eggs out. I don't eat eggs but I love kalamata olives so I tried this without the eggs and it was very good. Also, you can replace the non fat Italian dressing with something a little more elegant like a light balsamic.
