Hey guys, this is my recipe. When you mix the last sauce, add the water but make sure it is HOT so the honey is mixable instead of sticky. And I just put fresh mango's in the juicer to get the nectar. Enjoy! IMPORTANT juice your mango once its nice and soft, it's sweet when it's soft, and has a more sour taste when it's still a bit firm

I've made this now a few times and I prefer it with a few changes. I substitute about 1/4 cup of Thai Sweet Red Chili Sauce for the honey and lemon juice, and I puree a fresh mango in the food processor instead of using juice or nectar. After the chicken cooks, I set it aside and stir-fry some broccoli, then add the chicken back in with the sauce. At the very end, I toss in some fresh mango slices, just to warm them. I garnish with sliced red onion and chopped cilantro. Served with basmati rice, this is a delicious meal!

Just finished preparing this for my family and it was a hit.  I did make a few adjustments. I doubled this recipe.  Instead of garlic powder I used 6 cloves of garlic and added them skillet along with some sliced baby bellas while I was browning my chicken.  Also in lieu of mango nectar I used a mango smoothie that i found in a bottle in the cold juice aisle, it had lemon juice in it so I omitted that from the recipe.  I served it with Jasmine rice and sliced mango. My husband and 8 year old daughter both loved it. Will definately make again.

Rotisserie Version:  I used 1/2 a rotisserie chicken (chopped up), so I just skipped the first part.  I made the sauce, added the chicken, brought to a boil, and then let it simmer for 10 minutes.  I served it over brown rice.  I did use 1/2 cup balasmic dressing instead of straight vinegar and decreased the water to 1/2 cup.  Also, I just chopped up 1 whole mango.  I liked the chunks.  It's different, but in a good way. :)  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This was very good. I used pork chops instead of chicken.  I made a few of the chops plain (for the kids) and the other with the mango in the egg mixture and I honestly couldn't tell much difference in the breading between the two.  But, the sauce...it was great.  A little too sweet maybe for my taste, I want to try it again with some red pepper flakes.  
All in all, this is a great recipe!  Thanks for posting it!

I made this a few days ago, after my husband found a good deal on chicken breasts.  It was absolutely delicious!  There was nothing that I would change here.  It was great with jasmine rice.  My husband said "this chicken died for a good cause" :)  Thank You greatfoodaddict!

This recipe was very good and very different.  I couldn't find Mango Nectar so I used Peach Nectar (I had trouble finding this in the store - but finally did find it in the international isle - near oriental foods).  I bought 2 cans and it was more than enough.  I didnt' change anything about the recipe except for using the peach nectar.  As other reviewers noted - there is enough sauce for way more than 2 chicken breasts.  I used 6 whole breasts (thin sliced) and still had too much sauce (for coating the chicken).  Instead of simmering the chicken in the balsamic on the stovetop, I put in the oven to heat through and it came out fine.  I just left it in the oven for probably 20 mins or so at 350 while my sweet potatoes heated.  This recipe was very good, very sweet - a good change for a chicken recipe.  It won't be on my regular weekly menu, but definitely great for company or a special occasion where you want something a little different.  Next time I will try with the Jamine rice that everyone refers to.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

The chicken was great, but we thought the sauce was merely ok.  I served it over Jasmine rice.  The recipe made alot of sauce, so if I made this again, I would probably half the sauce recipe.  Like others, I didn't really taste the mango in the chicken coating.

The coating fell off the chicken and into the broth.  Way more sauce(broth...never thickened) than needed for 2 breasts or even 4 as I used.  Broth was too tart...no body or depth.  I would say that the chicken was tender and juicey, but nothing more appealed to me.

Soggy chicken, anyone? Not for me. I followed this recipe exactly and it produced a soggy chicken piece and even after using 4 mangos I could barely pick up the flavor over the soy sauce and balsamic vinegar. I had really high hopes for this recipe but it just did not deliver. AND it made a lot of dishes, to boot!

I wish the coating would have stayed crispy, but I had to simmer much longer for doneness. Chicken was very moist and flavorful.

This was ok, not as sweet as I though it would be, mine was a bit too salty/zingy for my taste.  This could be because of the type of honey I used or the mango puree instead of mango nectar, next time I make this, I'm def. going to use nectar!  I learned my lesson to follow recipes :)

Family LOVES this dish.  I find that I could marinade 6 pieces of chicken (instead of 2) with the egg mixture sauce.  I actually did this overnight just to save some prep time.  I doubled the balsamic mixture because it is so good!  I served it with a salad that had mango slices in it and it was the perfect compliment to the dish.  Have shared this recipe with many friends already.  THANKS.

First time I am commenting on a recipe and that is because this was so delicious.  Served it with jasmine rice cooked in coconut milk and spring salad mix with a homemade ginger dressing.
Can't wait to make it for company.
I have to add that I made it while visiting my son and daughter in law.  Best compliment was when she asked for the recipe.

This is a fabulous dish!! My boyfriend & his finicky 93 year old father loved it!! I did make a few changes. Instead of lemon juice I used pineapple juice. I also used a low fat balsalmic vinegar dressing & at the end added chunks of mango & pineapple!! Served it with a jasmine rice!!
Thanks for the recipe!!!

Was ok, the ingredient proportions were inappropriate and wasteful.  I adjusted to 4 servings and wasted 2 cups of mango nectar to dip 4 breasts, then threw nearly all of it away.  All the ingredients were just too much.  And it didn't recommend draining the oil after cooking the chicken ( which i should have known better to just do, but i didn't)- so the sauce was too heavy/greasy for my taste.  Great idea for a recipe- but cooking again I would alter it considerably.

Very yummy, but couldn't taste the mango.  I would be more likely to call it balsalmic-mango chicken as the balsalmic was the dominate flavor.  Again, still delicious (and even my 9 year old ate it without the usual complaints!)

made exactly and I'd have to say you could cut the ingredients by half as I had enough for 8 and I made it for 4. The flavor was ok but the balsamic was over powering. Sorry but I will not make this again

good - but I think your flour measurement is off which throws off the calories for this recipe.  You may use 1/4 cup of four and still have a bit left in the dish.

Delicious! Followed the recipe, but used fresh mango instead of nectar, and my husband loved it! I loved it too. The flavor is amazing.

I made some changes so gets a 4 as is/5 with tweaks.  I used 3 chicken breasts: The amount of flour mix was about right for that but there was enough marinade for about twice that. I cut the chicken in smaller pieces to cook more evenly and I did them in my fryer to get them nice and crispy; made the sauce separate on the stovetop and served over the chicken so the chicken didn't just soak in it and get soggy like many of the complaints were. My main complaint is that the sauce had too much bite (balsamic vinegar) overwhelming the mango flavor. I ended up having to add and extra cup of mango nectar to balance out the vinegar, then it was too thin and had to add more cornstarch to thicken the sauce...ended up wih  total of a 1/4 cup of cornstarch. That was much better but still missing something....added one diced fresh mange then it was perfect. served over Jasmine rice and it was a big hit.

this was interesting.  I think it has potential, but the sauce was way to much it made the whole thing really soggy.  so maybe next time i will cook the sauce alone and then pour over chicken when done.  Also the four with garlic and pepper could have used a little somthing else.  I think it was just ok, but my husband ate it and hes really picky.

This is a keeper. I didn't have mango nectar so I purred a mango with a little bit of lemon juice. It was wonderful. I served it with the Asparagus, Avocado Medley found on this site and a sweet potato. The only change I made with the Asparagus Avocado medley was the addition of pine nuts and crumbled blue cheese. Wonderful blend of tastes. Absolutely will make this again, especially for company. Great combination.

its ok but this is not piccata at all is not like a piccata sauce with a mango hint no way. this is a mango sauce and is not bad. and I think is cheap to cook with garlic powder just used minced garlic on this.

Great flavors.  My take on this is that I had way too much flour mixture for coating and too much sauce for dipping before browning.  It seemed a shame to throw out that lovely mango sauce that I put through the food  processor. Next time i will save it for the sauce over the chicken.  Served with coconut jasmine rice--yumm!

All of us loved it.  Tried this recipe after viewing her video.  Used fresh mango.   I also used a small food processor to mix wet ingredients.  I cooked it too hot so it was a little too dark brown.  I was cautious about using so much lemon juice but it had a unique sweet and sour taste to it.  I will make this again and use a lower temp to fry.

Great flavor.  I think I will use smaller pieces of chicken next time though, making it more like orange chicken.
