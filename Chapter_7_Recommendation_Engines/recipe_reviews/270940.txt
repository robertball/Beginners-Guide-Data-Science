I am still trying to win the war with my air fryer, but this recipe gave me hope for its future!  I tried a piece of eggplant before adding sauce and cheese (which I did in the regular broiler because I was picturing mess in the air fryer) and I loved it.  Actually liked it more without the sauce and cheese!  Next time I will probably made them and a dip instead, but will definitely make them again.  That was also my first time making eggplant, so thank you for the inspiration!

This recipe turned out great. The only I did was spray the coated eggplant rounds with olive oil cooking spray. They were fantastic and you could have ate them  just as they came out of the air fryer  without even adding the marinara or cheese. I plan on using the coating and method to make zucchini fries.

I never would have thought you could cook eggplant in the air fryer. When I saw this recipe I knew I had to give it a try. OMG I'm so glad I did. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out soooo good. Even my husband who thinks he doesn't like eggplant tried a piece and then went back for more. And this was really so easy to make. What a great dinner with some garlic bread.I will definitely make this again. Thank you for such a great recipe. My air fryer is my new favorite toy so I appreciate new recipes to try. This one is a keepa!

This was awesome!  I love eggplant parm, but I hate the mess and the time it takes to make.  I just got my air fryer today and tried this recipe and am SO excited that it's so quick and easy (and much less fat without the oil).  I actually just used Wegman's seasoned bread crumbs (comes in a resealable bag), instead of doing all the seasonings, but otherwise followed the recipe for times, etc., and it was just wonderful.  I used the rack that came with my air fryer to do two layers at once, which made the process go faster.  Also topped with heated sauce and broiled in the oven so that it was all ready at once for the family.  
I did not peel the eggplant, but may do that next time.  Will most definitely be making this again!

I grew oriental eggplants in my garden and because they are so slender I couldn’t execute the recipe exactly as stated.  I found a small baking dish that fit in the air fryer and made the eggplant parm the usual way.  It came out great.

This was great, and not messy at all with the air fryer. My husband got seconds even though he doesn’t like eggplant. I melted the cheese in the broiler so I could do them all at once.
