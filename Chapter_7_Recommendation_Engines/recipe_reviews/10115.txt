These were a huge hit at the office.  For anyone who is having issues with filling falling out, I would suggest pushing the chunky parts of the filling to the outside of the circle (leaving the cinnamon/sugar mixure in the middle) before rolling.  This way you can squeeze the raisins/nuts in as you roll.

Also if you don't want to make the crescent shape, you can use this recipe to make roulades (exactly the same cookie, just a cinnamon roll-like shape).  To do this, roll the dough out either into a rectangle or circle.  Then add the toppings.  Roll the dough with the filling.  Then cut into 1 inch pieces.  (Note: If you rolled into a circle, you'll need to cut a 1/4 inch piece off of each end before cutting the 1 inch cookie pieces.)  Place seam side down for baking.

I have tried many Rugelach recipes, this was the easiest and came out the best. One note, the rugelach is always rolled out in a sugar cinnamon mix never flour if rolled and turned once it is covered in sugar, it is no problem to roll out at all. Mine was never sticky I chilled for 24 hours.  NEVER use table james or jellies for fillings, use Solo fillings which are specifically made to handle the hot temps of the ovens and they dont liquify as much. I used apricot and choc chips, I put nothing on top of them and they came out WONDERFUL. Company said they were stupendous, and when my company left and I finally went to have some for myself they were already gone. They lasted sbout 2 hours.  Too much work to give out on platters but a nice treat for company or for family. Will truly make this again.  Bakeries charges up to 7 or 8.00 a pound for these gourmet treats.

Thank you, Jackie! Great recipe!! I made each of the four quarters of the dough differently, just to experiment.  One with cinnamon, white sugar and walnuts, one with rasberry preserves, one with chocolate ganache and walnuts and one with walnuts heated in a simple syrup (and then cooled). Brushed all of them with beaten egg white and sprinkled a little white sugar on top. I found that 20 minutes produced a rugelach that was lightly browned and was very flaky and tender when cooled. By baking them just two minutes more, they were a little crisper. Both ways are wonderful, and I'm sure I'll come up with other filling variations. Thanks again.

Absolutely the best rugelach recipe that I have tried and I have tried a lot of them. Very easy to do in the food processor. I followed the recipe exactly. I chopped the walnuts and rasins in the processor also. The filling stayed put when rolling the cookie by simply pressing it onto the dough as the recipe stated. Most rugelach I have made leak all over the pan giving the cookie a burnt look on the bottom, but these did not do that. The flavor is wonderful! Definitely try this recipe! It is a gem!

I can't say enough about this recipe.  It is my new standard holiday gift.  My son and I found that we could easily get 64 cookies out of this recipe and still have decent sized cookies.  We made three varieties: raspberry all fruit jam and chocolate chips, Apricot all fruit jam and almond paste, and Trader Joe's Apricot Orange preserves with chocolate chips.  I like them all equally, however my co-workers enjoyed the raspberry chocolate best.  Since making our first batch around Thanksgiving, we've made no less than 300 cookies!  I found that the easiest and fastest way to make them is to roll the dough out into a rectangle shape and brush with your jam or sprinkle with your sugar mixture, add a line of the chunkier ingredients (chips, nuts, chopped fruit) as you roll.  That is, roll the rectangle as you would a jelly roll and after each turn flatten it a bit while laying down a line of the chunky ingredients along the edge of the roll.  When finished, cut with a pizza cutter for the perfect shape and size.  This shaved at least 15 minutes off the prep.  I made the first batch according to the recipe and then replaced all of the cream cheese with Neufchatel and the sour cream with 0% fat Greek yogurt.  This did not change the texture or taste at all.

Jackie, this Rugelach recipe was fantastic! The only thing you didn't mention was to make sure and throw some flour on the rolling surface and rolling pin to prevent the mixture from sticking and to help it cut and roll better. I made a batch of 48 for Christmas (I also added cherry jelly + crushed almonds as filling) and they completely disappeared. On New Year's I doubled the recipe and they vanished again! Next time I know better and will quadruple it. Thanks.

I rolled the dough out into rectangles instead of circles because I wanted more of a square shape for my rugelach.  Then I spread a thin layer of apricot jam, before sprinkling on the nut mixture.   Using a pizza cutter, I cut the dough in half horizontally, then into 7 vertical pairs.  I then rolled them up log fashion and put them seam side down on the cookie sheets.   I did refrigerate the dough disks overnight and then kept the prepared rugelach in the fridge at least an hour before baking.  I think that this gave them almost the quality of a puff pastry.   I thought this recipe to be quite a bit of work, but after tasting the results, I would use it again.   I like my rugelach a bit on the moist side and this was just the best.

This was my first attempt at rugelach.  Even though the recipe has a few steps, I found them very easy.  The dough was a cinch in the food processor.  After making a few batches, I learned to roll the crescents tighter.  I used the original recipe and everyone loved them.  The second time I used Nutella spread and mini chocolate chips.  Those were the biggest hit with the kids.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I have never had Rugelach before...actually I don't even know how to pronounce it but it's fantastic.  I did change the recipe a little. I don't have a food processor so I used my kitchenaid mixer and a pastry cutter to make the dough.  It took a little while but it worked.  One thing I learned is that you really have to flour your surface and the rolling pin before you try to roll out the dough.  It was hard for me to roll mine because the wedges stuck to the wax paper. I still have 3 more disks to roll out so I will know how to do it tonight.  For my filling I used sugar-free apricot preservatives,  sprinkled it with some brown sugar, then put about 1/4 of a cup of white sugar and 1/2 a tbsp of cinnamon.  I added raisins to top it off.  Baking them for 22 minutes was perfect.  When I make the rest of mine tonight I think I will chop up the raisins so they fit better.  Besides that I don't think I am going to change a thing.  I wasn't sure how the dough would come out...it was light and flaky.  My brother-in-law thought it was a french recipe because it was similar to a  croissant.  He was surprised I had made it from scratch.  This recipe is awesome.  It's a little time consuming but totally worth it in the end.  Thanks for the recipe.

**I brought these for dessert at Christmas dinner and my father couldn't believe I had made these, he was really shocked.  He loved them. **

This recipe is great. After making the dough, I thought it was going to be too wet, but it ended up rolling out perfectly with very little flour. I filled some with Nutella (chocolate hazlenut spread) before adding the fillinng from the recipe. They are really rich and flaky.

My dough came out sticky not crumbly in the food processor. Double checked-ingredients correct. I want to make a few more batches. What did I do incorrectly?

This is absolutely yummy! I made it on Christmas Eve and then again on New Year eve. I made 4 different types. 1. Nutella, 2. Cranberry walnut and raspberry jam, 3. walnuts, raisins and raspberry jam and 4. walnuts, chocolate chips and raspberry jam. Was was good but the favourites were the first 2. The second time I made it I found some ways to be more efficient. Follow the instructions exactly, roll out in the circle on wax paper, spread the jam then the cinnamon sugar then the rest of toppings and press lightly. Then lift and place on a plate and refrigerate until the dough firms up a bit. That way its really easy to cut and roll. Then egg wash and sprinkle or roll in cinasugar and refrigerate again. Final tip be sure to remove from baking tray as soon as its finished baking because if not it will fuse to the paper and its difficult to remove.

These were so, so good! A little time-consuming to make but worth every minute!  We don't like raisins so eliminated those and was very liberal with the cinnamon sugar--in fact--probably doubled the amount added to each--inside & on top.  Used pecans and experimented with orange marmalade & strawberry preserves(liberally)as well--both outstanding!  Was making these while people were around and could hardly keep any to store for Christmas gifts!  I had to keep making more!  I found serving them warm is the best.  Never got around to it but I want to try these with sausage or bacon & different cheeses.  Who knows...they may be a hit too!

Excellent recipe.  I did not like the way the pie shaped slices rolled so I shaped my dough as a rectangle  and cut strips.  I like the way that rolled and baked much better. I posted a photo so you can judge for yourself.

This recipe is great!  I had never made rugelach before.  Just a little labor intensive but worth it!  I put the sugar, cinnamon, walnuts and raisins in my food processor and processed them all together until fine.  Save a lot of time chopping.  The chilling of the dough and the filled rugelach is very important.  I also mixed cinnamon and sugar and dipped the cookies before they were baked.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Never heard of Rugelach before, but these are delicious. I don't have a food processor but chopped up the ingredients needing chopping with a small slap-chop style chopper and then the dough easily mixed together with a spoon and additionally by hand. I found a 9 in. plate to trace out my circles after rolling the dough out and they all came out perfectly sized and even. I did notice that my second batch, which was chilled longer, was an easier dough to work with and flour helped. A crisp, flaky treat that is very versatile!

Excellent, authentic recipe, just like you get on the East Coast. MAKE IT EASIER! 1) SKIP 2-HOUR CHILLING! Instead, I sandwiched a ball of dough between 2 pieces of saran wrap, rolled to 9" round, peeled off the top layer of plastic, placed fillings, cut with pizza cutter and was ready to go! 2)FRESH ANYTIME: This dough refrigerates VERY well so you might as well make the whole recipe, refrig until needed, and then bake as much as suits your household. OTHER TIPS: 1) Choco filling: 1 cup chocolate chips (chopped) tossed with 1/2 cup white sugar, fill as usual. 2) after making your rolled crescents, chill for 10-20min in the fridge so they maintain the pretty shape while baking. this is optional, but easy if you skipped 2h of chilling.

I had cream cheese and sour cream, but no eggs so I found this recipe and decided to give it a try. Delicious! I chopped up a huge Hershey's Kiss for half the batch and used raisins in the other. I even made a few with only cinnamon/sugar and those turned out to be my favorite! Will definitely make again!

It worked!  Made this recipe for my Jewish mother in law and the family was very impressed!  I spread Nutella on the rounds and sprinkled the ground nuts and cin. and nixed the sugar.  I will make these again and again!

These were awesome! The dough is a little tough at first, but if you use it straight out of the fridge and have everything ready to go so you're not handling it too much, it'll come out perfectly! Plus, it may take a little clean up at the end if you're using a cuisinart, but the ingredients are sooo easy to put together and before you know it, it's ready to go!  I cut rectangular strips instead of triangles, so they could be more squared off. And instead of using this exact filling, I played with fillings like apricot preserve with toasted sliced almonds, 4-berry jam with chocolate chips, blackberry preserve and pecans, and cinnamon with chocolate chips and walnuts.   The family has requested these as part of my christmas bake-off arsenal :) Thanks Jackie! Perfect recipe!   PS......I had a few packages of dough left, and because the dough is not sweet, I rolled them out and put par-cooked (with cumin, coriander and smoked paprika) spinach, mushrooms over a layer of soft goat cheese. I cut the dough into large squares and folded the ends upwards and crimped them together to make little packages. It came out so good! Think of the flavor possibilities!

Oh my goodness!  I'd never tasted rugelach before I made it, and it's absolutely wonderful!  This recipe made flaky, tender, just-the-right-sweetness pastry I've had.  I shaped mine differently.  I divided dough in half before refrigerating.  Rolled out rectangles that were about 18 x 10 (or so), spread half the filling on each side (minus raisins), cut the rectangle lengthwise, and then rolled into two logs.  With a knife, I cut the log into 10-12 pieces and then baked as directed.   Everyone loved them at the Russian tea I took them to.  I will be adding this recipe to my permanent collection!

This recipe was wonderful! It was not difficult to make or roll for me. I rolled the dough into a rectangle then cut the rectangel in half length wise. I then cut the halfs into several strips (vertically) and added the filling. I used strawberry jam with walnuts in half and chocolate chips cinnimon and sugar in the other half. I could not decide which ones were better. They were both great. These were just as good if not better than rugelach I have had from the bakery. One helpful hint that I have is to use parchment paper to line the cookie sheet. A lot of the jam filled rugelach filling came out while they were baking but with the parchment they still came off the pan with no problem and no mess to clean up since I could just throw the paper away. Also, I baked the rugelach on a baking stone to keep the bottoms from burning and it worked great.

These were soooo good!!  I didn't have a food processor so I actually completely mixed the dough into a ball and it turned out fine.  I barely used the sugar/cinnamon and used a lot more raisins and nuts than the recipe called for.  I also used orange marmalade. If you do wipe the dough with a jam I don't think you need the sugar.  Just sprinkle some cinnamon on the jam before you add the raisin/nut mixture.

I wish I could give these 10+ stars...they were incredible!  
While yes they are a little time consuming due to having to chill the dough, all in all they are really very easy to make and definitely worth the wait!  
They were so flaky they just melt in your mouth!  I liked these better than the ones I pay a fortune for at my local bakery!

I've been making rugelach for a few years now and each year they get better. This one is a surprisingly forgiving dough - not as temperamental as regular pastry. 

Lots of reviews suggest using jam as the filling, but every time I have done this the jam burns and ruins the cookies. It doesn't matter how thin I keep the coating - they burn. So the best version by far is the one outlined in this recipe - cinnamon sugar with raisins and / or nuts. 

I plan on trying poppy seed one day, because that's what I used to buy and love at the Jewish bakery (Solly's) in Vancouver, BC.

They keep really well (freeze or store in an airtight container) and since I don't do a lot of holiday baking the extra time it takes to roll them is worth it, because they impress everyone that tries them. :)

I literally just made these with my daughter both decent cooks.  I followed many peoples advice because I have never made these.  I have this advice this is one of the best cookies ever!  But...do yourself a favor flour lightly two sheets of parchment and roll out very chilled dough in rectangle put filling on top pressing into dough and roll up cookie roll fashion chill again and slice and bake.  They will come out perfect.  The taste is unbelievable whole family raving!!!

Man, these are awesome.  I made the basic version with the addition of 1/4 c. white sugar to the dough and they came out beautifully.  Also made some with dried cranberries mixed into te basic filling and they, too, were great.  Thank you so much for the recipe!

Very good recipe. I cheated - I like a sweeter cookie, so I added 2 T. 10X sugar (could go to 1/4 c.). Invariably, some of the sugar/nut filling falls out during the cutting/rolling process. I just brushed the tops of the cookies with beaten egg, and then spinkled them with the spilled sugar/nut mixture, and then chilled for 20 min. I also made the chocolate variety, no raisins. Tip: Invest in parchment paper. Makes cleanup a breeze, as there's a lot of butter and sugar, which could caramelize and burn your cookie sheets. Yum. Time consuming, but cheaper than the bakery! Worth it.

Was surprised how easy the dough was to make and how far the dough went. I got about 70 rugelach out the dough. They were a huge hit and I'll be making them again and experimenting with fillings. I made half with cinnamon/raisin/hazelnut and other half with raspberry jam (heated in micro with 1 tbsp sugar), dark choc and hazel nuts. And I definitely recommend doing an egg wash on the rolled rugelach otherwise they look dull.

Fantastic!!!  But be sure to keep the dough cold and I found it easier to roll it between two sheets of wax paper.

Amazing texture and flavor.  My husband couldn't get enough of these and he doesn't say much about cookies.  These he did... "Keep them coming"  

I made part of the dough with raspberry   
preserves and drizzled w/melted milk choc when cooled.  

I made my daughter apricot with a can of Solo apricot fruit.  She loved them.  We did not like the mini choc chips in this recipe.  Thanks for sharing.  A new favorite in our home...

I really liked this recipe, they were a nice change from my usual cookies.  I didn't bother chilling the dough at all, either before or after rolling them out, and they turned out fine.  These are not the kind of cookies you can just "whip out", they are a little time consuming, even if you don't bother to chill the dough, like me.  However, they did turn out very tasty and are very pretty on a plate of assorted cookies.

Excellent recipe but don't skip the chilling before baking.  I forgot with the first tray and they spread too much.  I realized my mistake before I put the second one in.  Also, much easier to bake them on parchment paper.  Easier clean up.

Awesome recipe; my only change (third time around) was to use chopped chocolate chips in place of raisins, and to roll them out as rectangles rather than rounds. The roulade shape allows all the filling to stay contained in the rugelach -- it tends to fall out when prepared as the recipe suggests. I shape the dough into rectangles before chilling, then roll out to about 4 x 12 inches, top with filling, roll into a log and cut into 12 small cookies. These took about 24 minutes to cook entirely. The dough is easy to work with and cooks to a lovely flaky finish.

These are delicious!  I didn't have a food processor big enough to make the dough, so I did it my stand mixer and it worked out great.  Make sure you keep the point on the underside of the cookie, to prevent it from unrolling during baking.  Definitely worth the time it takes to bake these!

Very easy and good recipe,just made few changes,I did roll the dough in a sugar instead of flour ,that came amazing
I used chocolate for the filling that I mixed and it is  non sweet  Cocoa  with cream, powdered sugar and vanilla and that was a hit .
And brush it with egg wash before put it in the oven 
basically it tasted the same as my mom use to buy it from the market when I was little

Very good.  I rolled mine jelly roll style then cut 1 inch wide sections to make pinwheels.  It's a very tender, rich and flaky dough due to the cream cheese.  I'v also used chopped toasted almonds with success.  This will keep if it's tightly stored in a container.

I made these this past weekend. Oh my god.  48 cookies gone in 2 days! They were a huge hit. I added some mini chocolate chips in and cut down on the amount of walnuts and raisins to compensate. I also sprinkled the tops with cinnamon and sugar as suggested. They were moist and flaky. I will definitely make these again!

This recipe is truely amazing.  Totally delish.  I rolled mine in powdered sugar as it did not say what to roll then in and they were just the best.  I made a few different fillings but the original is the best. Thanks for sharing.

I used salted butter (it's what I had!) and I omitted both the raisins (we're out) and the white sugar as I spread the dough with apricot preserves and sprinkled liberally with brown sugar. I only did a light sprinkling of cinnamon (both my husband and daughter are mildly allergic), and I did three different types: ground walnuts on one quarter, chopped honey roasted peanuts on another, and ground honey roasted peanuts with white chocolate chips on yet another. The last quarter I made into plain crescent rolls to test it (tasty, but too buttery-flavored!). :) They all turned out amazingly flaky, but I think cutting each quarter of dough into 8 pieces instead of 12 pieces worked out better. Oh, and using the food processor made it a snap. One more thing: they took more like 30 minutes to bake, but they are so fabulous! Try apricot with white chocolate! Thanks for sharing, Jackie!

This was the perfect recipe!  I am going to make it again.  You need to make this for people that KNOW rugelach and how it differs in texture from cinnamon roles....Otherwise they might eating expecting a different consistency....hard to explain - but it has a crumbly - break apart in your mouth feel...and is not a chewy as a cinnamon roll.  I loved it  - but I also grew up eating it!

Great recipe!  I followed the recipe as written with the exception of the raisins.  Instead of raisins I spread the dough with apricot preserves before adding the sugar/cinnamon/nut mixture, which was very tasty!  The dough is phenomenal though!  Flaky and buttery and just as it should be.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Nice addition to our Xmas selections. I made them without jam and with Orange marmalade. Both were equally tasty. I also made them as crescents and rolled up and cut out sprials. Looks great on the plate. Thanks

I faintly remembered how good rugelach cookies were, but actually didn't know the name of the cookie type until I did some research and stumbled upon this recipe.  As soon as I saw the picture I knew it was the cookie I was looking for.  I've made these multiple times, and they always come out amazing!  I use tiny choc chips I found and bought especially for this cookie.  They are hands down my favorite.  I can eat the whole batch, which says a lot since I rarely eat the stuff I bake, I just like to bake it!  Definitely time consuming, and that does affect how often I make them, but when I do I enjoy every single bite.  They keep very well too.  Thank you so much for posting this!  Usually it takes me a while to find a recipe I like, I always try different ones and tweak things a bit, but I settled with this exact recipe right away.

After I made 2 of the disks, I didn't like the way the sprinkled cinnamon and sugar looked on the finished product, so I finished the last 2 disks in a way that I read in a different recipe.  Combine 1/2 C sugar and 2 T cinnamon and spread over rolling area.  I used a pastry cloth and spread it on that.  Then roll the disk out on the cinnamon/sugar mixture and finish as the recipe says.  It looks very nice when baked!

Absolutely delicious! Very flaky dough which almost reminded of baklava with its texture.It's also very similar  to puff pastry ,but tastes much better.I used the original filling for half of the dough,which turned out very good.For the other half ,I made a batch with Nutella and shredded coconut and the rest with raspbarry jam, walnuts,and coconut.The great thing about this recipe is that you can  use pretty much anything you want as a filling, as long as it doesn't spill over.Overall,this recipe is definitely worth the work involved ,even though it wasn't as hard as it sounds.Just a bit of organization and the results are perfect! Thank you for posting this recipe!

I added 1/4 cup sugar and 1 pouch of vanilla sugar to dough. 
I made the dough by hand and added about 3 tbsps more flour as it was really sticky.
Apricot filling, used 1/2 lb dried apricot chopped finely and 12 ounces apricot preserves, cooked over med-high heat stirring constantly for about 5 to evaporate extra fluid, allow to cool thoroughly makes a nice thick spread that barely leaked from the rugelah.
Nice texture to pastry, next time will divide into 8 balls and cut into 8 pieces to make 64 cookies, a better size for Christmas gift giving.

I really liked this recipe and will make it again. We waited the full 24 hours and also the 20 minutes before baking and it worked well. We did a brown sugar walnut and also an almond paste filling and both are great. Thanks.

Yum! This recipe has about 1/2 the sugar per serving of the others we looked at and we didn't miss it!  Mine stuck a bit to the cookie sheet so I wished I had used a Silpat or parchment paper.  The dough is just elegant - almost like a puff pasty.  I used unsalted butter and I think I would like to add just a wee pinch more salt to the dough. I know we will make them again!

This was a good recipe, but recommend glazing them with an egg wash just before baking to help them crisp up and become a little more golden brown...

I used this recipe to make rugelach for the first time.  It was time consuming -- but not difficult.  I got great results and everyone raved about how good these were.  I filled some with Nutella and others with raspberry preserves, but everyone's favorite by far were the ones with this recipe's filling (substituting mini chocolate chips for the raisins).  Outstanding.

I am totally bummed about this recipe because I had sooo many problems with it.  First of all it says to mix the ingredients with a food processor which I assumed that a blender would work, it absolutely will not!  It only mixed the bottom half which became very sticky and thick while the top half was still powdery.  After mixing it by hand I formed my disks then chilled them overnight.  When I tryed to roll them they just cracked leaving gaps all over the place and the more I rolled to try to smooth out the gaps, the less manageable the dough became.  I ended up with less than 10 cookie from 2 disks and threw the other two away.  Maybe I am just a really inexperienced baker but this recipe was vey difficult for me.

Before I say anything about this recipe - you need to know I do not like raisens or nuts in ANYTHING (cookies, cakes, fudge, etc.).  Having said that - this recipe is great!  I had trouble rolling it up so they did not leak, but will work on that next time. The nutella was a great addition.  This is a keeper in my recipe book.

Great recipe for rugelach, everyone in my family loved them. I put extra sugar/cinnamon filling in, which really adds to the taste & texture. No need to chop the raisins.  Sugar/cinnamon to the rolled up rugelach before putting on cookie sheet is nice for appearance and taste. Butter is a must for taste.

This was soooo good. I tried it with the Nutella spread, white chips, pecans, and then the cinnamon sugar mixture.  It was surprisingly easy to make- I was expecting it to be more difficult.  This was by far the best.  I also tried the cherry jam with chocolate chips, but those were messy and the jam came out.

These are so delicious. I didn't have raisons so I decided to use Apricot jam in the nut mixture. They turned out great. I'm not sure if this was a major faux pas but it worked for me and I am making more tomorrow for our BIG family party.

Made these yesterday, my first time making rugelach.  Everyone loved them and said they were possibly the best they've had.  I used chocolate chips instead of raisins.
Update: I've been using this recipe for 5 years and still love it, it's become my holiday coookie exchange staple.

Delicious.  I made these exactly as directed (and tried a batch with apricot jam also great and easier to stick the filling to the dough) and they were fantastic.  Mine left a fairly large grease slick on the bottom of the cookie sheet, so I had to remove them right away to cool on wire racks.  I think I didn't get the butter and cream cheese cut small enough before adding the other ingredients.  Didn't effect the flavor or presentation though.

These are super good!  I just got done baking a double batch and swear I ate the whole first batch.  A few tips I'd like to contribute after reading other reviewers problems: 1.  Definitely chill this dough and roll on a lightly floured surface.  I would imagine a marble cutting block would be ideal.  I used a Wilton Roll & Cut mat for fondant;  worked perfectly.   2.  Roll your circle to about 8".  Then put your nut/ raisin / cinnamon / sugar combo on the dough.  Cover with a papertowel and finish rolling to 9 inches.  This worked perfectly for me.  I didn't get very much mixture spilling out after rolling it into the dough.  Careful though... you don't want to roll so hard that the mixture pokes through the front of the dough!

I first made these for a Sunday school celebration.  We were discussing Hanukkah.  Everyone loved them and I saved the recipe.  I have made them for Christmas and other occassions since then.  They are always devoured.  I use the variation of apricot jam.  They are just delicious!

Yum!  I never realized rugelach was so difficult to make.  I moved from Los Angeles to England and I miss being able to pick it up at the market and local deli/bakery.  Thank you for the great recipe.  I found working with rectangles worked better for me than circles.  I rolled the dough on parchment on a glass countertop protecter and put it in the fridge to chill for about 20 min.  Then I cut the rectangle in half lengthwise and cut each half into 6 rectangular slices.  If it is not perfect, after it has chilled again you can use a knife to spread it better and cover up tears.  After spreading on the filling I used a knife to help me roll each piece.  The knife made it easier to get the dough off the parchment.  I also cooked the rugelach on parchment paper.  I made 3 variations:  raspberry walnut with nuts on top, apricot and nutella with choc. chips.  I blended some choc. chips in my small blender and put the choc. powder on top of some of the rugelach.  The hardest thing is resisting eating all the rugelach up in one go!

Great recipe, these were a big hit with the family at Christmas, already got special requests for more. I was a bit worried they weren't going to come out since the directions said to use a food processor until crumbly, I only have a hand blender and it was very doughy and not crumbly at all. 
I rolled out the discs and spread with apricot jam and sprinkled with brown sugar before covering with the filling. Then i cut the discs in half and then cut rectangular strips and rolled them. 
I had a difficult time with keeping the filling inside (think i had too much filling in the first couple batches). about half of them came unrolled in the oven, those i kept for myself.

first time they did not come out great...second time I was pressed for time so I put the cubed butter & cream cheese in the freezer it worked so well and I was able roll in out right away. I also rolled it out like a log (thick)added the filling and cut into 1.5 inch pcs. you yield less but its worth it! so much easier and still tasty!

Excellent recipe, and I've tried many. Much better than the one I used to use from Martha Stewart. Tender dough, effortless!

I just made these and the dough is a dream to work with.  It rolled out so nicely and to make sure that I was making a 12 inch circle; I rolled it out and used a pot cover that was 12 inches and went around that with a pizza cutter.  I did mine exactly as the recipe stated and using the food processor was a snap.  Next time I'm going to experiment a bit with the mixture I think for our tastes a tad sweeter would be nice and I want to try some raspberry jam in them as well with some white chocolate.

I love the taste but the dough is a bit hard to handle. It always melt on my hands. Otherwise, I will make it again and again for many years to come.

This was my first time making this and I was pleasantly suprised.  I subsituted Splenda for the sugar and I used a mixture of Splenda, cinnamon and ground walnuts for the filling.  My stepkids and husband loved them!

This recipe was great!  Most recipes don't use the sour cream, but it really does add a new depth of flavor to the dough.  One of my favorite variatins is coconut.  Try it with chocolate chips or macadamia nuts.  DEEElicious!!

I made these rugelach for Thanksgiving they were delicious. A great improvement over my prior rugelach recipe which was made with sour cream only, not a mixture of sour cream and cream cheese.  This recipe will definitely replace my other.

This weekend I tried various rugelach recipes and this was the worst.  The dough was too wet with the addition of the sour cream.  There are definitely better recipes out there.

I misplaced my original rugelach recipe & stumbled on this one.  I was not disappointed .. the pastry dough was very tasty.  Next year I plan to try the suggested variations (with the jam), but the basic recipe was excellent!!

I found this recipie in a magazine 2 years ago and made it for that Christmas for the family. Everyone loved it. The creamcheese makes the cookies so rich and creamy and the kids love to sprinkle the sugar and spices on the rolled dough.

OMG!  Just discovered Rugelach at Carlo's Bakery in Vegas.  Decided I had to make these at home and found this recipe.  Substituted chocolate chips for raisins, and I swear these were better than Carlos Bakery!!  Now if I could stop eating these like popcorn!

I have been making this for years and can't believe I've never reviewed it. I will admit that the first few times I made it, it was very messy and difficult to do. Once you figure out what works best for you, it's a breeze. If you follow the instructions exactly as stated and use cold ingredients, the dough comes together in about 5 minutes and is very easy to handle. I use a dusting of flour to roll it out into a rectangle. I only make about half the filling. I make some with different flavored jellies and also use mini chips. I make different ones for each disc. One of my favorites...

Great recipe! Can anyone help with one small problem I had? These were delicious! The only problem was that before the cookies browned and got flaky, they seemed to melt and flatten on the pan in the oven. My daughter had the same problem, what did we do wrong?

This calls for 2 cups flour, with 1 cup of butter, 1 package of cream cheese and 1/3 cup of sour cream, and the dough is supposed to be crumbly?  It was very sticky!  I ended up adding another cup of flour! Then more to dust the pastry board.  I probably almost doubled the flour amount.

DELISH! I've made them with a) sugar/cinnamon/walnuts/mini dark-chocolate chips, b) Solo apricot filling/walnuts (or almonds)/cinnamon, c) Solo raspberry filling/dark chocolate chips.  (A) and (B) are *wonderful* --- wasn't crazy about (C).  Also, after the 1st time I made this recipe, I stopped cutting the prepared dough into wedges and rolling --- now I just roll the entire thing into a 'log' and slice into pieces about 1 1/2" wide.  This works *much* better for me and the filling doesn't fall out!  I brush the top of each piece with beaten egg and drop into either a sugar/cinnamon mix or into crushed nuts before baking.

I don't generally write reviews but I just pulled these out of the oven and they are amazing. My exact words were "Holy Macaroni!". I would say I am an intermediate baker. I can cook without recipes but I am just starting to get a feel for proportions and the effects of different ingredients in recipes. I saw these and thought it looked a bit like a pie dough in that you need to keep everything chilled and not overly mixed so I expected flaky-ness. The term "laminated dough" popped into my head also. Well these came out like little croissants for me. Exceeded my expectations. I haven't read the other reviews but I definitely agree with all the stars for this recipe. I am making them for Christmas and they are a nice addition to the mix of cookies. 

I used european butter, mixed with my hand squishing all the ingredients into odd shaped, flakes and chunks. Filled with 1) cherry pie filling (pureed in blender)/pecan 2) Nutella 3) chopped raisin/brown sugar/walnut.

This was the best recipe ever!  Very happy with the results.  I also made a few different fillings like some others.  Next time I will roll the dough into a log like someone else suggested.  It will definitely save time, and I think there will be less loss if filling.

4.5 stars from me.  They were very good.  I don't think I followed the directions exactly, b/c I was going back and forth btn this one and the Contessa's recipe from FN.  Anyways, I had the cream cheese and butter almost at room temp when I started, so it was basically smooth when combined.  This did not affect anything.  For my filling, I did toasted crushed almonds, finely chopped dates, and a layer of sugar free apricot preserve (applied with brush before filling).  The two chilling steps were crucial.  Rolling was not that difficult afterwards.  I did not have liquid jam everywhere as one reviewer did after baking.  Ina rec'd 2T of preserves.  I think I did 3T-4T with it not running.  I did do an egg wash to improve the appearance (1 egg beaten with 1T milk).  I don't like overly sweet desserts, but I think it would've been fine to roll the pastry in cinnamon sugar before baking.  Baking time:  22min for my oven was too short.  So I just left the rugelach in there for another 10-15min til it reached a deeper light brown.  I think next time I will add vanilla to the batter to give it more flavor.  Like I said, I don't have a sweet tooth, but I know that these can stand to be sweeter.  Regardless, I like these a LOT, and really, really enjoyed making them.  This was a great new learning experience!  And did I mention these are oh so ADORABLE?!

I am searching for a good rugelach recipe.  This was the second I tried; the first was better.  My food processor could not handle this much dough so I changed to my KitchenAid using the dough hook.  After more than 2 hours of chilling, the dough was too soft to handle easily.  Even after pressing the filling into the dough with a rolling pin, a lot of the filling fell out.  The dough is a nice consistency but, if you don't roll it in sugar, it's not sweet enough (I omitted the raisains).  If you cut in rolled rectangles instead of crescents, the pieces may fall over during baking.

Very good! I used apricot jam spread on the dough and sprinkled them  with the cinnamon sugar mix before baking. Next time I would increase  the amount of sugar and nuts spread on the dough. As good as I remembered from a bakery in N.Y.C. Need to make a second batch they went so fast.

Only problem I had was the dough was so soft and hard to roll.  I needed to patch it up a bit, but the end result was to die for!

well i decided to give these a try. I've never had or even seen a rugelach in my life and i wanted to start trying some tradional dishes. I don't have a food processor, so i used a fork and knife. It really took less time then what i thought to make coarse crumbs. I also used what i had in the house 1/3 less fat cream cheese and light sour cream. They didn't puff out like many people stated then stayed the same size i rolled them. Also working the dough less and not worring about getting it super thin worked better for me. I used a sugar reduced jelly. They turned out really good. My bf really loved them. He asked me when i'll be making these again. I'm sure he'd give them five stars plus the fact they're prettty diabetic friendly.

This recipe took a lot of work and ingredients and time (and a big mess to clean up). But it was delicious. I put white chocolate chips and walnuts instead of the healthy stuff and it was a hit.

The good news:  These were fantastic.  I didnt do the fruit filling instead I spread it with nutella and sprinkled with walnuts.
The bad news:  This dough is REALLY difficult to work with.  I had it in the fridge overnight, and honestly, its alot of work, I dont know if I would make it again based on the big effort alone BUT they were delicious!

I'd never heard of Rugelach in my life and I stumbled onto this recipe when looking for something to make to get rid of some leftover sour cream.  I'm so glad I found this recipe and it introduced me to such a yummy and addictive cookie!

The best rugelach recipe I've found to date.  Easy and fun to make.  I spread a thin layer of apricot jam on the dough, and added the sugar, cinnamon, nuts, and of course, mini chocolate chips!  I did have to bake them a few minutes longer to be golden, but that's probably my oven.  Excellent recipe!

Could not stop eating these! I used vegan versions of butter, cream cheese, and sour cream and they were wonderful! The dough was a bit sticky when rolling out, so I sprinkled the counter with cinnamon sugar and flour and it was much easier to work with and tasted yummier! I made some with raisins and some with chocolate chips. The kids loved the chocolate chip ones, but I thought they were all delicious!

It wasn't as difficult to make as I thought it would be.  I used raspberry jam and placed 3-4 chocolate chips inside.  I served them for Hannukah and everyone loved them.  Very rich tasting w/ the cream cheese in the dough.  Will make them again.

Made the recipe as listed but also brushed them with egg white and sprinkled sugar on top. These are quite a bit of work but very much worth it. I rolled out the dough in between sheets of wax paper. Baked them on parchment paper. They baked to a pastry golden brown.

Although I'm not Jewish, a few of my good friends are, so I thought I'd surprise them with a Chanukkah sweet. This recipe was a fantastic success; my friends (and my family) loved it. Two of the friends I made it for are allergic to nuts, so for theirs I filled the rugelach with chopped white chocolate and dried cranberries (craisins). Delicious. Thanks for a great recipe.

I found this recipe years ago and make it almost every Christmas.  A family favorite.  I also add mini-morsal semi-sweet chocolate chips to the cinnammon sugar mixture which really adds a new dimension to these great cookies.

I don't have a food processor so it was a time consuming process.  This recipe was well worth the time!  My first batch was a nut-free and I used raisins and organic apricot preserves.  The second I followed the exact recipe.  They were gone the next day.  My family loved them.  I have borrowed my grandmothers food processor and will make some more soon!

Good recipe.  I've never had rugelach before and these were pretty good.  Didn't keep super well after the first day, so I'm only giving it 4 stars.

The rest of the family and friends, keep asking me for the recipie!!! Gorgous!!!

I made this recipe yesterday for a cookie swap and it was a hit. I used seedless raspberry jam in half and semi sweet chocolate chips in the other batch. Also, I had to bake mine for 30 minutes and they came out flaky and crispy. Excellent recipe.

My husband gave this recipe a 10-star rating.  These were very much fun to make, een if a bit time-consuming with having to chill the dough twice. They came out perfectly with a very flakey consistency.

I made these last week. The only thing that isn't mentioned is that the dough itself uses NO SUGAR..so it is not a very sweet cookie. I personally perfer teh sugar version that gives just a Hint of sweetness..but my mom...RAVED about this dough..she doesn't have a sweet tooth like I do though...
oh and I used black cherry allfruit spread w/ walnuts...and it was VERY good..I would add a tiny bit of sugar though..the filling was a bit tart..but good!
I also added 2Tbs of milk because it was soo dry...worked great!

This is a great recipe, and while a little time consuming, it's not difficult at all.  I liked the comment about rolling out in a sugar mixture.  I was worried about the ragged edge when rolling the dough out, but that takes care of itself.  Also, I did part of them with apricot spread from Whole Foods and it helped the mixture stick to the dough.  Also, I put a piece of waxed paper down and rolled the mixture lightly to press into the dough.  I will chill the rolled dough longer than 20 minutes the next time.  My second pan, which chilled for 30-40 minutes came out better.  I also baked the cookies for 24 minutes.

I have made these for the past 40 years and they are always a big hit for the holidays.  I do, however, roll them out on Cake Flour, this helps keep them from getting too tough from rolling them out on regular flour.

This is the best of the best, easy and the results are great. When my son comes to my house he is always looking for  them, I have tried so many recipes, however this is the best of all.
I make them twice a week everybody loved them, wish I could give it 10 stars

These were excellent.  The dough is very sticky at first.  Put in the fridge as directed.  I broke into 4 parts and refrigerated.  After rolling it out with some flour, I sprinkled sugar on one side, flipped it and added filling.  Mini chips, apricot preserves and raspberry jam for each kind.  Might try Nutella with chip next time.  It wasn't great warm out of the oven but were great after they cooled.  I got lots of compliments at the party in brought them to.

My daughter is in the musical, "Fiddler on the Roof" so I decided to make rugelach for the cast. This recipe was perfect! Easy to work with and delicious. I did add about 1/3 cup of granulated sugar to the dough ingredients because I thought it needed just a touch of sweetness. I filled one batch with mini-chocolate chips and powdered sugar and another batch with cinnamon-sugar, to make it more "kid friendly." It's really important that this dough is cold. You need to work fast from the time you take one section out of the refrigerator and roll and fill it. The dough got easier to work with the longer it was in the refrigerator. Really good recipe. Thank you!

This recipe is amazing. I decided to make 4 different fillings with the base filling (sans raisins). I had apricot preservers and brown sugar, chocolate chips, dates and then plain.  All of them scrumptous.  The recipes was so easy! Really yummy!

Although my mother always made rugelach with butter and sour cream, obviously I can't do that if I want the cookies to be available to my kosher grandkids even after a meat meal. So I replaced the butter with margarine, the sour cream with Tofutti brand's Sour Supreme and the cream cheese with their Better than Cream Cheese. And although the rugelach didn't taste exactly like my mother's, they were spectacular and gone in little more than a minute!

not bad, but to improve the batch ,each round should be rolled out, butter added and envelope fold twice, this brings it more to a pastry  and less of a solid lump

Loved them.  However, cookies normally disappear quickly in my household, and these were still around after a few days.  They freeze well (after being cooked) and taste yummy frozen or thawed.  Good to have on hand for company/a needed dessert.

Very good recipe.  I found that the rugelach came out a little on the big side, so I cut each circle into 16 pieces to make them a little smaller.  They were great!

really good dough, because I thought I screwed it up & it still came out super-duper flaky.  I did use a food processor for the dough & let it rest for 2 hours.  I filled the rugalach with a processed paste of: roasted almond, cocoa, prunes, raisins, orange zest & a little agave nectar.

Jackie, thank you so very much for sharing this magnificent recipe!  Everyone says it is the best rugelach they have ever tasted.  I believe the apricot filling is the magic ingredient.  I am now asked to make these for every family event!

These definitely have 5-star taste, but they are a pain to make. I used dried cranberries and pecans, no jam.  I might try some chocolate chips next time.

this was fantastic. It is light and can be served for breakfast, brunch or even dessert. It is not super sweet pastry so it is hard to stop at just one! I made this for Easter and one of the guys ate 9 of them for dessert. I found the dough in went from crumbly to mushy when made in the cuisinart- but it did come out perfect in the end. I used the filling suggested. Next time I may try other fillings for a change.

Awesome.  Oddly, I tried several variations and actually liked the traditional apricot, raisin and walnut combination the best, even though I don't particularly like raisins, apricots or walnuts.  The pastry was incredible.

These unfortunately didn’t turn out for me.  The dough never settled enough to be handled despite refrigerating for over 24 hours.  It was so sticky that even rolling it between parchment paper didn’t help.

This is my second time making these and i love them. I do seem to have a little problem with mixing the dough in the food processor because when i add the sour cream it gets all sticky and goey and not crumbly like the recipe says, not sure why. But, it does come out wonderful and the dough rolls out nice. It is a little time consuming but worth it. I make an apricot/almond filling and the walnut/raisin filling as in the recipe and the rasin filling is my favorite. I do brush them with egg wash. I make 2 batches at a time and freeze them.

Yummy.  My first batch didn't cook all that well, so I upped the temp to 375 degrees and cooked in 2nd to top shelf only.  Worked well.  I baked in a confection gas oven in case it makes a difference.

Really yummy though.  Look impressive enough to give for gifts.

This recipe was simply excellent.  The dough was very easy to roll out and assembly was easy too. The cookies turn out nice and flaky and are very rich.  They were a hit with my family  so I made another batch for our cookie swap at work.  They were a big hit there also.  Everyone thought they'd be difficult to make but I assured them the recipe nearly fool proof.

Alright, I had a problem and I have no clear idea as to the source.

The first time I made the dough, I had to thaw the butter. I also used a slightly-too-small processor (the blade jammed). Still, the dough came out fine.

I got a new processor and made this 3 times with butter right out of the frig. The dough looked crumbly, but rolled horribly, with sugar or flour. The more I tried to fix it, the worse it turned out. Another recipe suggested doing a bit of kneading before dividing, but that didn't help. I chilled it longer than 2 hours, to no avail.

I saw that someone thought that the dough was pulsed too long, so I wonder if the more powerful processor is the source.

I'm open to suggestions.

Oh, regarding raisins, I found a tip that said to dust them with flour before chopping. That worked like a charm.  Then I put the filling items in the processor and that came out even better!

Oh, boy!  I love making Rugelach, and this recipe is a winner!  I didn't have sour cream, so I substituted plain Greek yogurt.  I had leftover homemade almond paste, so I rolled it into two large discs for filling half of these dough circles, and added chopped almonds.  For the remaining two dough discs, I used the traditional cinnamon-sugar mixture with chopped walnuts.  I have always brushed my dough with melted butter before adding nuts and cinnamon-sugar, and I noticed this recipe doesn't include that.  No matter... these baked up beautifully and I love the tips about rolling the cinnamon sugar into the dough and then chilling the filled rugelach before baking.  Awesome!  This will replace my old tattered Rugelach recipe from now on.

I make them a lot smaller than what this says only because it makes a perfect bit.  You could eat a dozen of these they are so good and so flakey.  I have even thought this would make a good pie crust.

I took the advice of brushing on a small layer of apricot jam first.  They aren't as good as I was hoping they would be.

I made and treated the dough as written.  The only change I made was to brush it lightly with apricot jam (first puree the lumps out!) before pressing the walnut/spice mixture into the dough.  This  is an excellent recipe.  Thank you very much Jackie!

Love this recipe. It's well detailed & gives great instruction for doing all the prep necessary especially the part about refrigerating the dough is a must so you can work with it. Lots of variation on fillings. My personal favorite is apricot & raspberry jam. The only tweek I made is to do an egg wash

I’m not sure where I went wrong... maybe my butter wasn’t incorporated  enough, because I refrigerated my firmed rugelach for a couple of hours prior to baking and they were swimming in butter when I took them out of the oven.  Haven’t tasted them yet - I’m sure they’re good - but I’m not sure why they’re just swimming in melted butter.  :(

These are exactly like my Czech Grammy Novak makes each x-mas only she uses pecans, no raisins, and liberal amounts of powdered sugar to roll these out.

Never thought anyone could improve on my mom's recipe but this one is actually better. Here is a tip for rolling out the dough. Instead of using flour to keep it from sticking, we usually use a mixture of sugar and cinnamon. It is messy but it works and enhances the recipe.

I made this and I am no cookie maker. FANTASTIC, gave some to my neighbor friend and he swears by them. Just follow the recipe. I noted that chilling was the trick. And use SOLO product. It is the best. I used Almond paste, then sprinkled with cinnamon and crushed pecans. Heavenly! They are addicting. I also made with Solo Apricot filling and Solo Raspberry filling. Taste just stupendous.

Taste great but don’t look great. They look like the doggie got to them. The dough was a little sticky and I could not roll them tight. I will try a little flour on the next batch  to see if that will work. I’m not giving up because  they’ll wonderful little cookies . Made them again they came out great and used flour so dough would not stick

I made this recipe for Rosh Hashana this year.  The only downside was that I felt like it was very time consuming but in the end, they came out absolutely delicious!   Minor changes that I made were that I added about 1tsp. of Vanilla to the dough.  Also, when adding sugar to make the filling, I used an equal combination of brown and white sugar.  I also made some of them with a dark chocolate and walnut filling using melted Hershey's Special Dark chips and a combination of walnuts and sugar.  I will definitely make these again!

i replaced sour cream with 1/4 cup sugar. The dough turned out too soft instead of crumble. I don't know the sugar could make that much different? I kept the dough in fridge over night and baked it the next morning. I brushed on the apricot jam before sprinkle the filling, and added on chocolate chip. It turned out well and still super yummy!

I bake cookies every summer for college baseball players who come to Anchorage for summer ball.  I made this recipe for the first time and it was a struggle and time-consuming but I have never ever received such high praise as I did for the rugelach.

The recipe fails to say that you need to put something on the pastry board before rolling the dough.  Fortunately, I had read several other comments and was forewarned.  I used sugar and cinnamon instead of flour and it works just fine.


This week I will experiment with some jams and see what happens.

This was great both times I made it. Table jams and jellies work just fine! I'm not sure what the issue is about that! I used BlackBerry jam and no filling and both were just wonderful. Next time I'm going to try honey!

Love, love, love this recipe! Takes a little time to prepare but truly worth the effort! Apart from being addictive  for dessert pastry lovers,  these  yummy treats will win over any dessert sceptic- no matter  their age. I've made these for years for family, friends, work colleagues and sometimes just for me... I can devour a batch in a matter of days! Remember not to handle the dough too much, refrigerate, refrigerate, refrigerate and be creative with your fillings. In addition to those suggested in the recipe, try unsweetened desiccated coconut, chopped dried cranberries, raspberry, pineapple or strawberry jam... Options are endless, so bake on!!!

I made no changes to the recipe. Perhaps people who had an issue with the dough pulsed it too long in the food processor, as that could happen. I am a caterer, and had a request for Rugalach from a friend. After I found this recipe and made them for her, she told me it took her back to her childhood! She just closed her eyes and the memories returned. That to me was the ultimate compliment! I tried another recipe from a different source, but this one, using sour cream, was the best. Yes, sometimes the filling will be difficult, but work with it, and you won't be sorry. I made mine with apricot jam and pecans only, no raisins or currants, and sprinkling more sugar and cinnamon than the recipe called for. They were delicious.

I followed the recommendation to add a layer of apricot jam and brown sugar.  Oh, the filling variations you can do!!  Just thinking of all the different kinds to make!  Great pastry too.  Very flaky!  Can't rate this high enough.  Thanks!

Addicting! Would certainly make again! Rolled first batch the wrong way...started with point rather than ending with it. Did not  effect the taste :) "Variation"  indicates using jam before adding filling. I can see how that would help hold filling in place. Rolled them out on cinnamon sugar as is traditional. Worked nicely.

I don't think I'll make this recipe again. My food processor bowl wasn't quite large enough to do a good mix. There was so much butter and fat in the dough, it ran out on the cookie sheet. Followed recipe exactly.

The only thing is I will never get 12 out of 1 dough ball - 8 is a good size. Other than that - very easy to make & delicious!

Made these for the first time. They were delicious. Also made some with raspberry filling and blueberry filling.  Fun cookie to experiment with. Didn't have a food processor so used a hand dough blender to cut in the butter and cream cheese (just like I would make a pie crust).  It worked fine.

Got this recipe in my email and thought "that sounds good"  so I made a test batch this week in anticipation of taking to my daughters house Christmas morning.

I'm too lazy to make the dough, and after reading about cutting the disks into wedges, I thought "canned crescent rolls" will make an easy substitute, and they did!

I combined white sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, and chopped walnuts and set aside in a small bowl.  Opened the crescent rolls, and sprinkled them liberally with the sugar/nut mixture.  On a few, I spread some peach preserves.

After baking about 14 minutes, I cut each roll into thirds and these little treats were fantastic.  These were gobbled up by 3 of us in 15 minutes!

Can't wait for Christmas morning.

My dough was sticky, not crumbly so I added 2 more cups of flour.  Dough was great after that.
Delicious! I made three different  fillings and ended up with a nice variety for my sweets platter.

Very good, BUT Im not sure if Im doing something wrong. The butter melts all over the cookie sheets so they end up too greasy, though delicious.
Hoping to find some advice in the other commentaries.

After reading the other commentaries I think next time Ill add more flour, and chill the dough for 24hours instead of just 2 hours. Also, I might try chilling them more than 20 minutes before putting them into the oven.

This dough recipe is awesome!!! The best I've ever tried. Love the filling too and the chocolate one. Endless ways to use this dough. I am going to try it on the next pie I bake.

I really loved this dough.  Using plenty of flour when rolling out is key.   I used a simple cinnamon-sugar filling and drizzled white icing once they were cooled.  Like little cinnamon rolls!  Delicious.  This recipe is a keeper.

Absolutely fantastic! I loved this recipe and could not believe how flakey the dough came out. I made it with homemade candied chestnuts (I had to do something with them) and cranberries and they are now one of my new favs. I reviewed them on my blog too so other people will try them. Thanks so much!

Super easy recipe, I brushed the dough with Apricot jam before sprinkling on nuts and raisins. I couldn't keep the tray filled fast enough. I baked half for Christmas eve and put the other half in the freezer for New Years.

These were okay.  A lot of work for a so so taste.  I tried the first 1/4 of dough in the traditional crescent shape but too much of the filling spilled out so I then did pinwheels for the rest it worked much better.

This recipe worked beuatifully from the food processor to the over. Keeping these babies chilled is critical to success. In this recipe youu can replace half of the white flour with whole wheat flour. Add a bit more sweetner and vanilla to accoomodate your sweet tooth.

I was skeptical while making these about how they would turn out (due to the trickiness of rolling out the dough and making the individual rugelach), but the final result was extremely well-received: out of 48, I left a party with only 8 left! I replaced the raisins with mini chocolate chips to make it more dessert-like. Excellent recipe, and a new addition to my collection.

I made these for a holiday party at work and they were a big hit.  The only reason I gave them 4 stars is that they are a bit messy and difficult to put together.

I love the dough for this recipe - I have yet to mess it up.  I have tried variations with the filling, and like to leave out the sugar, use pecans, and apricot and orange fruit spread (from Trader Joe's), and golden raisins.  I also rolled the dough into rectangles, and rolled the dough, then cut into slices, and covered with egg wash and demerera sugar.  Yum!  As good as these cookies are, they don't last - 3 days at the most.

I'm not sure what good rugelach should taste like, but I didn't care too much for them it seems. The batter tasted too "dairy-ish" for me. Although I did make two kinds: One with raspberry jam, and one just like the recipe said. I did like the original recipe best. It wasn't bad, it just wasnt my favorite either.

Although the end product of this recipe is delicious, I found the dough extremely hard to work with.  It seemed to tear, even though I had chilled it for 24 hours.  If I made these again, I would definitely brush the pastry with butter before putting on the cinnamon-nut mixture.

This recipe was first attempt at rugelach (I wanted to make something familiar for my Jewish father-in-law who was attending our Christmas celebration).  I used chopped white chocolate chips as well as nuts and cinnamon and it was a big hit.  I'll be making this again for the Holidays.  Thanks!
