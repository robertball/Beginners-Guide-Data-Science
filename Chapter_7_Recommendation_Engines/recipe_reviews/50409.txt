VERY GOOD! Our family loves pork chops and I must say these have been the most tender and tasty chops I have ever had on the grill.  The pickle juice marinade gives it a unique taste and were they were enjoyed by all.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars for innovative thinking and surprisingly good results. I still think it needs a little black pepper, maybe some chili flakes - but I'm not going to harp on it. The whole time this was marinating I thought I may have finally gone too far left in the weird recipe category and would end up tossing 4 pounds of pork loin, but we were ALL very impressed with the finished product. Afer thawing and marinating in the pickle juice (I also used some pepperoncini juice - same diff - as I ran low on pickle juice) for about 20 hours, and cooking on the indoor grill for about 7 minutes total, this pork was super-tender, flavorful, delicious. And not nearly as pickle-in-yer-face as I thought it was going to be. I have a little leftover that I'm going to make cold pork sandwiches with on french rolls. Little mayo and black pepper (possibly a pickle or 2) and I will be in business. Thanks for the recipe!!

Absolutely scrumptious!  My friends couldn't guess what our pork ribs were marinated in!  I grilled them, but didn't use any other kind of sauce on them.  Didn't turn green, as one reviewer said...rofl.  I, too, used Clausen's dill juice, which I'm not above drinking right out of the jar!  Highly recommend whether one likes pickles or not.

So I found this recipe earlier today and decided to give it a try.  It seems most of the pork chop recipes I found on this site and many others consisted of soy sauce and brown sugar. I was happy to find something different & low carb (with great reviews).  I was very pleased with this recipe.. but there was no WOW factor.  Dill pickle juice was a very unique marinade idea.  I did add a jalapeno, garlic and red pepper flakes to the pickle juice marinade.  And the porkchops did come out very tender and quite good...but it wasn't the be all end all. But I will make it again when I have used the last pickle in the house. For the newbie culinary folks this is a great recipe.   I would suggest roasting a pork roast in a cooking bag with the pickle juice.  Very impressive!  Just add some extra herbs and a little salt. And I agree with others  when they suggest not to tell your family or friends how you flavored the meat.  They will be pleasantly surprised to find out the flavor came from pickle juice.  But the pickle juice is only the base.  There is extreme room to enhance this recipe.

Wasn't quite sure what to expect but I thought I might give it a whirl and am I glad I did. I used claussen's Kosher dill brine for the marinade. I checked the reviews and some said the chops tasted like a dill pickle. Well I suppose so with a hamburger dill brine. I found the claussen's to be milder and flavorful without over powering the pork chops. I grilled my chops and they came out juicy and tender. Will definitely make this again.

Who would have thought, pickle juice.  This was awesome!  I only marinated for a couple of hours, but it still had the best flavor, and very tender.  If you're like my husband and only like pork chops a little, you have to try this (even if you don't like pickles). It's a whole new experience!  Can't wait to try this with other types of meat. The secret is out, thanks for sharing Karen!

I was looking for chicken marinades and saw this. I tried this with chicken breasts. It was so yummy. I will definitely try again and also try with pork chops. We always have pickle juice- Claussen. We love pickles!

I used 5 pork chops sliced off a tenderloin and added the pickle juice in when I froze the meat.  When I cooked them, I pan fried in olive oil to brown on both sides then deglazed the pan with water.  Placed all in a baking dish, baked at 350.  My guests raved over it and couldn't believe that plain ole pickle juice gave such good flavor.  They were the most tender chops I've had.

I really liked these!  I marinated them in the pickle juice (didn't measure, just dumped to cover the meat) all day and then grilled for a yummy easy dinner!  These had a great dill taste, kind like a Dill Pickle Potato Chip. But w/pork.  And not crunchy.  Good stuff!

I BAKE OR GRILL MINE RIGHT IN THE MARINADE THEN USE IT AS A "SAUCE" WITH THE CHOPS. I ALSO ADD EXTRA GARLIC. I SUBMITTED THIS RECIPE ALSO AND WAS DENIED BECAUSE I USED PRETTY MUCH THE SAME RECIPE. NEVER THOUGHT SOMEONE ELSE WOULD USE PICKLE JUICE ON PORK CHOPS I DID IT FOR MY KIDS BECAUSE THEY LOVE PICKLES. FOR THE LONGEST TIME THEY WOULDNT LET ME MAKE THEM ANY OTHER WAY.

Absolutely LOVED this recipe!!! My children frequently ask for pickle pork chops for dinner and because we are all huge pickle fans, I never have a problem succumbing to that request.
I have to say, I am totally shocked at the amount of comments people have made regarding the pork chops tasting like pickles!! The recipe is called "Pork chops with DILL PICKLE marinade" What did you expect it to taste like?!?!

My chops were thin ones & I only marinated for about 8 hours.  They were delicious, you could taste the pickle but it wasn't over powering!

I tried this receipe after reading the reviews.  I added powdered garlic, fennel seeds, smoked pepper and a healthy splash of tabasco sauce to the pickle juice.  When I added the marinade to the pork chops, I also added a sprig of fresh rosemary and tarragon (because I had grown these fresh herbs and needed to use them).  I pierced the chops with a fork and ended up marinading them for two days in the fridge.  When I grilled them over low heat, they ended up wonderful!  They were very moist and flavorful.  When using this marinade, you do need to adapt it to your own personal taste.  It's probably not the best choice for those on a low-sodium diet, as the pickle juice has a lot of sodium, but I will definately do this again.  I'll never discard my pickle juice again either!!

This was great! I have some new dietary restrictions that prevent me from eating many seasonings (including garlic and onions!) so I was happy to find this.
I used kosher dill pickle juice and marinated the chops for about 20 hours (my chops were a little green). I put a little evoo on the chops and seasoned them with salt, pepper and basil, before cooking them in the oven. They came out moist and delicious!
Thanks!

Karen, You did it!  You are one of the few that have gotten a 5 star rating from my husband.  He said these were the best I have ever made.  I marinated thick cut butterfly porkchops for around 24 hours.  Browned them on both sides in a skillet and then baked them at 350 until done.  I did add lots of chopped garlic and dried red pepper flakes to the marinade.  I, like others, thought these would have a dill pickle, vinegar taste but they didn't.  Just a tiny hint that made you say HU-M-M-M what is that flavor?  Good, Good, Good.  Thanks!

Added minced garlic and crushed red pepper flakes. Marinated for 6 hrs. Sprinkled with pepper and adobo before grilling. Moist and delicious. Definitely not over dilly.  Did NOT taste like you were eating a pickle as other reviews stated.

I made these pork chops, but whisked 6 Tblsp ketchup and 4 Tblsp yellow mustard into the pickle juice before pouring it over the chops. The sauce, if thickened slightly with corn starch or flour, is good enough to serve over thick amish noodles.  My family loves it!

Never thought to marinate pork chops in dill pickle juice.  I used a little less than a cup since I didn't have a full cup.  It certainly doesn't need additional salt, but I wouldn't say they turned out salty.  I added a touch of garlic, mustard, ginger, and pepper.  They were great!

I did not care for this recipe. Keep in mind here that I LOVE pickles. They were a comfort food to me growing up, drinking the juice and all! But my pork chops turned green and weren't moist. :( VERY disappointing

It was ok.  Reminiscent of porkchops and sauerkraut but saltier.  Probably won't make it again.

Really easy and really good.  Didn't bother measuring the vinegar from the pickles, just poured it over the pork and left it.  My husband liked it but couldn't figure out what the flavour was, despite loving dill pickles.  Was surprised when I told him.  Will definitely do this again.

Yep, it sounds crazy but it's great, and couldn't be easier.  It definitely looks unappealing while marinating in a ziploc, and I would not recommend telling people what it is until after they eat.  But it was simple and produced a great flavor, more complex than just pickles.  Thanks Karen!

This recipe sounded interesting but we didn't care for it at all (and we love pickles!).  The pickle juice did absolutely nothing to enhance the chops flavor or tenderness.  And the little bit of fat around the edges turned the most unappealing green color!

I was very leary about trying these, but I'm glad I did. I dumped the pickle brine(I use polish dill pickle) over top of the pork chops(no measuring) the night before. Because I was worried about the dill taste being overpowering I drained the brine the next morning. They were grilled as stated and the end result was a very juicy tasty pork chop!

Amazing!  I never would have thought this would be so good.  Even my extremely picky husband could not say enough about it.  Of course, I waited til after he tried it to tell him what it was.  I never have any store bought pickles so I used my homemade dill pickle juice and it was fabulous.

Pretty good pork chops.  Points for taste and ease of marinade!  I added some red pepper flakes but otherwise did as directed.  Bf tried to grill outside but ran out of propane, so he grilled them inside on the grill pan.  Worked well enough.  Thanks for the recipe!

These have got to be the juiciest pork chops I've ever made! I liked the flavor, as well. It wasn't an overwhelming pickle flavor like I was worried it may be. I marinated for 18 hours or so. I sprinkled some garlic powder and pepper on the chops while grilling. Thanks :)

Surprisingly good and very easy.  Even my picky kids ate this one. I didn't have any problems with the green color that others have complained about, and marinating for so long makes the meat extremly tender.  I'm not nuts about pickles, so I was skeptical, but it's good!

They were pretty good. They had a nice taste, and next time,  but I cooked them a bit too long as I had other things in the electric skillet with them. They also weren't as thick as they should have been.  Next time, I will cook them alone on the stovetop.

I've made these twice now and will definitely be making them again!  They are so simple and yet so very tasty, do not be put off by the sound of using pickle juice-I use a popular refrigerator brand- and would suggest you do the same. They have a great unique taste that will have your guests mouth's watering for more!
I did add some garlic powder to the marinade the second time but, otherwise followed the recipe.

I made this last night with the "keep refrigerated" type of pickle juice and nothing more. Came out very good, thinking next time I will "bam" it a little with some jalapeno and red pepper flakes as another reviewer said she had done. Most definitely will make this again!!!

I really wanted to like this recipe, but just ok. DH could not guess what the ingredients were. I wish the pork was  a little more moist. Pounded the pork flatter with the knobby side of the marinator and let the pork sit for 6 hours. DH grilled.

01-01-16 ~ We always have pork on New Year's day. Always had it as kids growing up and have fixed pork in some fashion all my adult life on NY's day. I had a jar of pickle juice in the fridge and decided on these boneless chops. It was too cold and windy to grill, so I browned in the pan and deglazed the pan before baking. I added some sliced onions, and the drippings from the pan and baked at 350° for about 40 minutes. The result were tasty and moist pork chops, but not a strong pickle taste, at all. A nice way to use some juice that I normally throw away.

I love dill pickles, but this was too much for me. I was surprisingly disappointed. I marinated overnight, so maybe the key is less time. I recently made chicken that included pickle brine in the marinade, and the chicken came out much, much better than this, great in fact, but maybe it's because there were other ingredients and less time in the marinade. I won't make

We were excited to try a new, unique recipe. It's so easy how can you not try it? Pork chops were tender and juicy. The only thing it needed was some additional spice so we added garlic pepper and it was perfect. Without it tasted too bland for our liking. I like that the dill flavor wasn't too strong.

The taste was good. I was shocked this didn't have a stronger dill pickle taste. Not sure if I would make this again though. I served it with buttered corn topped with parsley & cheesy scalloped potatoes.

This marinade made the pork chops very moist and 
flavorful.  I am not a big fan of pickles so I only marinated for 6 hours so the chops would not be "too pickle-y tasting".  I thought they were delicious and would make them again.

All right. Marinating a porkchop in dill juice has been around for ever. I decided to go slightly different. I used the juice and the hot peppers from a jar of Wickles original pickles. These pickles are sweet and spicy, think sweet pickle relish with red chili peppers. I went a full 24 hrs. You do need to season it with salt and pepper. It's not over powering like the dill juice can get. I enjoyed it, but it might not be for everyone. Flash fried on medium high, 3 minutes a side, then finished in the oven at 350 for eight minutes on a 1" thick bone-in chop. Adjust as necessary to hit at least 145 degrees.

It's a great recipe and a good way to use up left over pickle juice. What I think some don't understand that is saying it's not much flavor in the meat is that you need to season your meat still. Any time you are using just salt and pepper to season something you gotta know it's not going to be like WOW! Use some lemon pepper seasoning or add some herbs or some Lawry's. When you are cooking you change whatever you want in a recipe and make it your own by adding a little flare to it!

I made it as “directed” marinated the meat over 24 hours; I will add garlic next time but garnished with dill pickle slices, sprinkled with parsley & dill!

Did not have much flavor, did NOT turn green like a few people said theirs did. It might have been more tender though. Still looking for a great chop.

I used dillibeans and pickles. Would have been even better with a more classic dill pickle, what I chose had significant red pepper and not enough dill flavor.

But overall it was great with only an hour's marinade.

I love zesty flavors with meats, and I often use dill in my cooking, but my family and I thought this recipe was terrible. The dill pickle flavor was overwhelming and unappetizing. (I recommend the Lemonade Pork Chops recipe on Allrecipes. It is tangy and savory, and tenderizes the meat beautifully).

I wanted to try something different to help on chops that weren't very tender so thought this would be a good idea. It did not help to tenderize at all and the chops tasted like I was eating  pickle. I was looking forward to the salty briny taste but it was too powerful. Sorry not for us, the whole family disliked it.

These were very good - the brine added a salty twang to the meat. I liked the fact that you use the pickle juice instead of pouring it out when you are done eating the pickles! We will be making these again!

Marinated 24 hours. Had to grill twice as long as chops were very thick. They still came out very tender and tasty. When hubby does not pour on extra sauce of some kind, I know they have to be good.

Made it just like it called for ...marinaded for 3 hours in home-maid  pickle juice. I also put some seasoning on some other chops that I had marinaded also...I could not believe the marinade only tasted  better than the ones with seasoning on them!

I thought the dill flavor was too strong.  It just gave me an odd feeling tasting dill pickle when I was eating a pork chop.  On the plus side, it was very tender.

I wasn't sure about pickle brine and pork chops, but was pleasantly surprised at how this turned out.  The pickle flavor was a subtle enhancement to the pork and not overpowering like I thought it might be.  Also, super simple to make, just marinate and grill.  I served it with rice pilaf and a fresh romaine and tomato salad.  Delish!

This was a mega hit in our house. My 10 year old son ate every bite, and I can’t remember the last time he did that without being told to. :) I marinated them about 6 hours, and grilled them in the George Foreman for 6 minutes. Perfect and just SO good!

I used pepperoncini brine juice, sort of the same concept, but with a bit of a kick, I also added fresh minced garlic, black pepper and herbs de Provence as a dry rub after 24 hrs. in the brine. did them on the grill, yummy!

I have also done this with chicken. You really don't need to salt the meat if using pickle juice as marinade as there is enough salt in the juice.  The meat comes out very tender.

I love pickles so this had a good pickle taste. I marinated it overnight and seasoned with salt, pepper, and a little north woods fire, which has a bit of spice.  My husband and I will definitely eat this again.

These were ok, but not something I would try again.

I thought this was a refreshing, new marinade for chops.....I wasn't sure about this at first, but I really did like it.  The dill is not overpowering, but just right....a slight hint of dill pickle flavor.  I've used this on pork tenderloin as well....I recommend butterflying it first.

We really enjoyed this.  It gave the pork chops a wonderful and powerful flavor.

My husband thought these were perfectly spiced and perfectly cooked.  I grilled them.  I thought it was a little odd, but tasty.  I used a cheaper pickle, but am curious to try again with Clausen's next time I empty a jar.
