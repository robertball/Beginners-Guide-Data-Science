There's no seasoning - salt, pepper!!!  Could be really good with the right herbs and spices...

I found it very dry when the rice was mixed with the saut√©ed meat and vegetables so I added a can of cream of mushroom soup and sour cream. Not a lot of flavor, but filling on a cold winter night.

Way too much prep time. No taste whatsoever. There's alot of base missing here. I reached for the Chicken Sauce right away but that did not help. help. This would have done a lot better with a half pound of bread crumbs in a turkey. Don't waste your time without serious modification.
