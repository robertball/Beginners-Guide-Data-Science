We ate this as a main dish instead of an appetizer.  It served two people with a little left over.  It was wonderful, sweet yet spicy at the same time.  It makes plenty of sauce, which you can use over side dishes.  The veggies and couscous we ate with it tasted great with the sauce!  Highly reccomended!

I changed up this recipe a lot, but the result was delicious! I added fresh green beans, garlic, onion, green and red bell peppers, cayenne pepper, sesame seeds, and crushed red pepper to the recipe, and served it over whole grain rice. I also used twice the amount of pineapple that the recipe called for. It was fantastic! my dish turned out perfectly balanced between sweet and sour, but with a little bit of a spicy kick. i will definitely make this again soon!

I made this for my dinner club's "Fruit Night" theme as a main dish.  It was awesome!  I added some crushed red pepper to spice it up a bit, but other than that, it was perfect and everyone loved it!!

I made this the other night when my boyfriend and I had another couple over and it was a hit! I served it as a main dish over white rice and it worked very well. It was VERY spicy, it may have been the chili sauce that I used. The boys said I shouldnt change a thing but we girls decided another chili sauce would be better next time lol. Loved it, just had to have a lot of water on hand!

Expected to love it...it was "okay." Served as main dish on rice. Don't sell "chili sauce" here but used tomato sauce and added garlic and vinegar as substitute. Might depend a lot on the quality of your preserves and chili sauce.

I added a 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper and a couple of tablespoons of toasted sesame seeds to give it just a little bit of kick.  It didn't last long at our party.

This was tasty.  A little sweet, but tasty.  Went over well at a party.  Mixed leftovers with some rice and corn for a quick meal.

So easy and very delicious - one of my family's favorites!  I cut down a little on the strawberry preserves so that it is not too sweet, and my family and I like it best when I go heavy on coarse pepper.  I serve it with a favorite rice dish for a main dish, and always double the chicken because the leftovers are great, too.

I decided to make this for a Superbowl party. The chili sauce & preserves combo sounded strange but I thought I would try it anyway. Well I am impressed. I doubled the amount of chicken & pineapple & used 1/2 strawberry & 1/2 apricot Polaner All Fruit. There is still plenty of liquid in it. I also mixed the raw chicken chunks with garlic powder, a pinch of ginger & about 1/4 cup of juice from the canned pineapple. When it was fully cooked I added a little black pepper & red pepper to the pan. It's absolutely delicious.

I made this as a dinner last night over white rice with a side of sugar snap peas. It was good, but not amazing and I agree with others that it was a lot of sauce. I added a bit of red pepper flakes as well for an extra kick. I will probably make again sometime in the future.

This was a good recipe.  My husband really liked it.  I added crushed red chili peppers (after taste testing the original recipe) to give it the sweet and spicy taste.  It was great!  The pineapple really went well with the sweet strawberry and hot chili pepper flavor!  I did cook the pineapples in a skillet for a few minutes before I added them to the chicken mixture (I think cooking them by themselves first brings out their flavor).  I also added onions and peppers to the recipe and served over rice.  Wonderful!

I used this dish for my dinner club (aphrodisiac theme) and was excited to make it. My guests liked it, but i wasn't overly impressed-mainly because the sauce and the chicken tasted very separate. I think it could use some more seasoning. i think i bought the wrong "chili sauce." the only chili sauce i saw was for hot dogs, couldnt be that. so i got some chili sauce intended for sandwiches (though i wouldnt put chili on a sandwich). anyway the recipe was easy to follow but like another reviewer mentioned, it makes a lot of sauce. Had i known that i'd use more chicken, or let it thicken up.

I made this as dinner last night & my kids just loved it! I'm so glad I threw in a sliced red pepper and added 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes as another reviewer suggested - it really made a difference! There was a lot of sauce and I'm not sure toothpicks are the best way to go unless you halve the jelly & chili sauce and reduce to a glaze. I just ladeled the whole thing over a bed of white rice and it presented beautifully. Overall, quick & easy to prepare and the flavors blend really well. Thanks for sharing...

Served this as a main dish I used veg. oil for higher cooking temp and light flavor. I didnt have chili sauce so I used enchilada sauce. Added a little juice from canned pineapple Cooked a little longer so sauce would thicken. served with rice and green beans. It was great will make again. Tastes like Sweet N Sour Chicken. Maybe some green or red peppers would be a nice addition.

Incredible! The flavor contrasts were amazing, I used a very spicy chili sauce. I also added green bell peppers and served over jasmine rice. Delicious... the best recipe I've tried in a while.

Excellent.  I made this as an appetizer for Christmas Eve.  The next day, we had leftovers over rice as a 'main' dish.  Very easy.  Will definitely make again.  Next time, may add some peppers and onions as others suggested.

I made this last night, but tweaked it based on what I had on hand.  I used frozen strawberries cooked down with the juice from the pineapple.  I added a little sriracha sauce to the mixture instead of chili sauce.  I also added agave syrup to sweeten it up a bit.  Served over coconut cilantro rice.  It was delicious!

I made the recipe as is except that I added one green bell pepper and did not add the juice from the pineapple (there was already a lot of liquid). I would recommended adding another can of pineapple without the juice.  Served over brown rice.  It was a good, fast and easy meal!

I teach a Foods class in a high school and one of my kitchen lab groups chose to make this recipe.  Like stated before it's sweet with a little spice and tastes like sweet and sour chicken.  You get a nice reddish glaze. Would go really well with rice and some stir fried veggies.
