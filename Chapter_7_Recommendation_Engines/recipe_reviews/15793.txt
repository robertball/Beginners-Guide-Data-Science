This was a delicious pie.  Don't make the same mistake I did however.  I made the crust ahead and froze it too long.  When it was time to slice it, the crust was difficult to cut through.  If I make it ahead again, I'll set it out to thaw slightly then fill with ice cream.  YUM!

I made this for my boyfriends birthday and he absolutely loved it, now he wants me to make every year for him.  It's very easy and you can change the ice cream flavors each time.

Very good.  I solved the hard crust issue by placing the pie plate in a pan of hot water before cutting - (like loosening a jello mold).  I made with 2 flavors - 1/2 with my favorite flavor and 1/2 with my husbands favorite flavor.  We were both happy!

This was so yummy and easy.  I made it for a dessert for a family party.  I am always looking for yummy and different desserts that are gluten free for my mother-in-law who has celiacs disease.  It got rave reviews from everyone.  We used banana ice cream, death by chocolate ice cream and cherry vanilla ice cream.  So good!

My family loved this and it was so quick and easy to make, but looked really good.  Delicious, will make again.  I did use chocolate chips instead of sweet German chocolate.  Only took 5 minutes to set the crust. I made it after dinner and served immediately.
