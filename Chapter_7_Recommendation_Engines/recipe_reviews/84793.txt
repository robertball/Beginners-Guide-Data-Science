We've been making a drink like this in my family for 3 generations.  We do the tea, 1 gigger of whiskey or bourbon, honey and lemon in place of the milk.  Absolute divinity and has become a comfort drink--especially when you're under the weather!

My stomach can't take the idea of whiskey & milk right now, but subbed with lemon juice this is my idea of a perfect cold & flu season toddy.  Definitely enough whiskey to make it count, but after the first sip so smooth and silky and comforting.  I made mine with the first teabag I grabbed, a Chai spice, and it's just awesome.

I made The McCuddy for me and my husband for Father's Day, 2008.  This drink has alot of strength. I broke out in a sweat. Serving The McCuddy in a large glass helps vetilate the fumes from the whiskey.  This drink gives a strong awake and tastes delicious. I used soy milk for milk intolerance and it stood up well to the Scotch.  This is not a drink for the faint of heart.  My husband said, "If you drink ten of these you won't be drunk, you'll be Scottish!"

Wonderful drink!  Great mixture of everything wholesome and good in the world.  The trick is to drink it in a large glass.

I was nursing a cold on a cold dreary day and thought this drink might hit the spot, and boy, did it!  This is my new hot toddy.  The slight amount of milk imparted a silkiness that smoothly bound the other ingredients together, making it easier on the tummy.  Wonderful.
