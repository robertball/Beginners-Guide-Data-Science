I made this the second time I've ever cooked, and something went wrong. I put it in the oven for the specified amount of time, but it didn't turn out very well. I think it would be better to cook the crust completely or RIGHT on the verge of being complete, and THEN add the mashed potatoes and cheese, and just bake until the cheese melts. 4 minutes w/o the toppings wasn't enough for me, and if I left it in for longer than 5 minutes w/the toppings ON, the cheese would burn. I think this is a great recipe though! I'm going to try it again w/a few changes. Oh, my fiance loved it (even though it wasn't done in the middle!).

I decided to search out a Potato Pizza Recipe after missing my old pizza place in my old town. 

This recipe was very close! I decided to use fresh dough from Publix (already made in a ball). I baked it at 450 for 7 minutes until it was a little brown. Then I changed the temp to 400 and baked for 15 minutes and it came out perfect. I think one of my potatoes was a little too big as there was quite a few on there which seemed to dry it out a little. 

Next time I might try and cut the potatoes like scalloped potatoes as that is how it was at the restaurant. Husband says it needs more bacon - but he loves bacon! 

Will definitely make again!!!

Very good.  I used a tortilla for the bottom instead and put it in a frying pan.  I tried a little salsa on top as well.  Yummy!

Delicious!  My boyfriend makes this meal for us about once a week - it's one of our favorite meals.  He uses real bacon, instead of the bits.  The instant mashed potatoes taste great with all of the ingredients (he makes mine without cheese because I don't like it).  It's very important to pre-bake the crust so it's not doughy.  Also, he makes extra potato topping for his side dish and extra broccoli for mine.

This was very good.  I changed the recipe a bit because I do not like instant mashed potatoes.  I cut up 4 medium potatoes added 3 tablespoons of butter and a 1/4 cup of milk to the potatoes.  I also made my own homemade pizza dough in a bread machine.  This is good with salsa on the side.

This was okay, but not quite as good as I'd hoped.  I've had potato pizza at Pizzaria Uno's, and loved it, but this just wasn't as good.  The crust ended up too mushy, I think next time I'll try a homemade crust instead of a refrigerated one.

I added the photo above and as you can see I added broccoli to the pizza as well as lots of seasoning on the dough. We used the dough from publix in the bakery section, real potatoes and fried up some bacon. it was awesome.

A definite hit in our house. Not very spicy, but my picky five year old twins devoured it, and my husband said with cajun spice it was five stars! That is definitely something I will be making again for a quick and easy meal. Be sure to use real bacon bits (Hormel), the fake dry salad ones are really salty and too overwhelming for this dish.

We love this pizza! I usually use real mashed potatoes that are leftover from a previous meal and cooked and crumbled bacon. When I have time I'll even make my own dough. Either way, this is really good! If you've never tried it, you should! :)

I made it in two  8" round cake pans. Used garlic flavored mashed potatoes.

My family loved it. We make it for all our parties and TV night.
Yum yum

This was really good. I used a super thin store bought crust. I substituted crumbled turkey bacon. Everybody loved it.

Loved this recipe! We used a pre-baked pizza crust because we don't like canned pizza crust. Otherwise followed the recipe,great week night dinner with a salad.
