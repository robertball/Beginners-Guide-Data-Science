The name speaks for it's self. I cut the butter and the oil to 3/4 cup each and found out that by adding a tablespoon or two of milk the batter came together much better. Will make more of these.Definitely a five star plus cookie.

This is the second time I have made these and they are wonderful!  They are a light, crispy cookie with a good sweet, but not overly sweet, taste.  I used 1 stick of butter and 1 stick of "ICBINB" margarine and followed the rest of the recipe as is.  Between the cup of shortening and cup of vegetable oil, no need to grease the cookie sheets (allow them to cool for a minute for easier removal).  For easy dropping on the cookie sheets, I used a teaspoon size (probably slightly larger) cookie dough scoop which created nicely shaped, even proportioned cookies.  Please note that both times I made these, the recipe made a lot more than the noted 4 dozen cookies, so they are great for sharing and freezing as well as eating!  Definitely a keeper!

this is the best ever cookie I have ever made.  It is very crunchy. It has a taste of its own.

This cookie is fabulous.  Straight from the oven, its texture is delightfully crunchy AND soft.  I like to substitute sliced almonds for the pecans.

A little presumptuous to call it the world's BEST cookie, but it is a great tasting cookie. It took about 3 cups of whole cornflakes, lightly rolled over a number of times with a rolling pin, to make 1 cup of crushed cornflakes. I used a heaping soup-spoonful of dough, pressed firmly, which made 47 cookies, each about 2½" to 2¾" in diameter. I used a non-stick cookie sheet, and there was no need to spray it first. 15 minutes baking time was fine, with no burning.
Sept 2017 update:  I have made these a couple more times since my original post, after noticing that the recipe states that it should make 24 pieces. I therefore use an ice cream scoop (size 16 in the culinary world?) and  it produces 25-27 cookies. I up the baking time to 17 minutes and they still come out fine with no hint of burning. Let them cool in the pan for at least 10 minutes. They freeze well too.

They turn to dust when you try to take them off the cookie sheet.  If they didn't, they would probably be really tasty.

Uses a great many ingredients.  They are crunchy and do last as promised.  I used a 1" cookie scoop to measure and got half as many.  Overall, the name is a bit optimistic.

I have made this cookie recipe before, although not from this recipe site. I sent them to my daughter's charity bake sale at her school and decided to try using broken pretzel bits to replace the nuts for those who are allergic to nuts. It really worked out well.

Double this recipe at your own peril - I did and had to find a HUGE bowl to finish mixing the dough (and had to sort of knead the dough).  On the other hand, they're delicious and I'm hoping that they'll freeze well.

These cookies were too  dry for my taste.  I cooked them for 12 minutes. The real test for me of how to rate a recipe is whether or not I would make it again.  I'll pass on this one and keep on looking for that perfect cookie recipe.

Agree... little presumptuous to call it the world's BEST cookie.  Dough is great!  Cookie is ok.  Be careful to not overbake this cookie.  My big 1.5" scoop goes for 12 minutes, my small 1.25" scoop only for 10 [oven runs true temperature].  Bottom edge just barely turning light golden.  If wait until they are golden brown, then overbaked - which I did on the first pan full.  Doesn't make the cut for my Christmas Cookie production of 14-16 types, but could see where this would be an enjoyable cookie with coffee or tea.  I'm certain my dad would love it.  Yield: 2 dozen of the large scoop plus 6 dozen of small scoop cookies from one batch.

I thought these were delicious! I loved the crunch of the corn flakes. I used all the butter called for, and used 1/2 C coconut oil and 1/2 cup oil. I also added about 2 T milk because I didn't want them dry. I didn't crush the corn flakes very much--just used my hands.

Recently retired, been baking a lot.  Made a batch of these with another recipe and these were the favorite by far!  Nice and light, a definite keeper.  Followed another's suggestion and reduced the oil but still used 3/4 cup oil and added water to make a cup; cookies worked out fine.  Thanks for the recipe!

These cookies are very good and easy to make.  I used cookie scoop to drop them and went very fast.  I also added a cup of dried cranberries because we like them.  I had to bake them 18 minutes but they are worth it.

I added a combined cup of choc. chips and dried cranberries to the dough.  I used a little less oil, as some suggested---about 3/4 c of canola and coconut.  

Maybe these changes were the reason I only found these cookies to be barely edible. They tasted chalky,  had little flavor and the oats didn't soften---could a lack of 1/4 cup of oil have this much of an effect?  I won't be baking these again.

I followed the recipe. Has a texture similar to a pie crust. Very flakey. After all the oil, butter, and add-ins, I can still taste the flour. Will not make again.

This is a good cookie, I don't know about the worlds best.  I didn't find it to be overly crunchy, but it is a little crumbly.  I added 1 tsp of salt and I used almonds for the nuts.   This makes a large batch of dough.

I couldn't wait to make these cookies and made them exactly according to the recipe.  The batter was scrumptious so I couldn't wait for the finished product to come out of the oven.  Sadly, they were incredibly dry and crumbly.

I found these cookies to be dry and the taste to be kind of boring. If you make them be sure to drop the cookies not roll them or else they will come out hard like rocks.
