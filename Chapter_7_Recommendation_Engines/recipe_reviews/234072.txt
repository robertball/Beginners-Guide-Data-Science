Awesome flavour !  However I would highly recommend NOT using a blender to puree the soup.  Especially if the soup is still hot.  Even at half full the soup exploded out of the lid.   We simply could not hold it tight enough.  We pretty much had the entire kitchen covered in soup.
I would suggest using a hand blender in the soup pot or mashing the soup first before pureeing. This soup would also make an excellent sauce for a Thai Chicken dish over rice or noodles.

The flavours are very nice but I felt that it came out way too thin. Next time I would probably do 2 cans of coconut milk and cut out the extra quart of water.

This is a wonderful recipe! I saw the previous reviews about there being too much liquid, and it being hard to puree so I made some changes. I roasted the squash and carrots so I could add them to the onion mixture then blend to a puree with some stock for moisture. Once pureed I added 1 can of coconut milk (I think I'll add 2 next time) and 2 cups of stock. It must be much thicker than originally called for but I like thick soup. The chili moritas are wonderful and I will be looking for ways to use them more! I love them so much I'm going to add 4 next time.

I followed the directions as well as I could. I substituted fresh jalape√±o peppers because that is what was available. Everything else I did pretty much as directed except I used vegetarian soup stock to keep it vegetarian. I simmered the soup for an hour before I added the coconut milk then used an immersion blender. It was nice and thick. Great flavor!

I made a few changes because I didn't want to go to the grocery store, so take this review with a grain of salt: used 1/2 tablespoon chili powder instead of fresh, subbed leeks for celery and omitted the water because I like thick soups. It was really good! I will definitely make it again, and I suspect the fresh chills will take it from 4 to 5 stars.

Great recipe. Didn't have the peppers so I substituted 1/2 a Tb of chili powder.  Perfect winter soup.
