I used fresh local peaches and blueberries, but the frozen would work well out of season.  I did double the topping because it seemed skimpy as written.  Very nice.  Thanks, Meg&Mom!

I really liked this recipe a lot and will make it again.  After reading the reviews, I doubled the topping which was scrumptious!  I used fresh blueberries and peeled local peaches cut into bite-sized pieces.  I poured the fruit into an 8" X 8" baking pan (after spraying with butter cooking spray) and sprinkled the fruit with a little lemon juice, 1 TB of flour and a couple of heaping teaspoons of sugar (I got the idea to do this from another blueberry peach crisp recipe on this site).  Then I mixed them together and topped with the topping.  I baked it according to the directions and it came out perfectly.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  This was luscious - both hubs and I really enjoyed it!  I've never made a crisp before and now would definitely make it for company.

I thought this recipe was great. I used fresh blueberries and fresh peaches. I used abou 1 1/2 cups of each. I don't know if it would be as good with frozen, but with fresh fruit I rate it a 5. Easy to make, can whip it up quickly, a relatively healthy and lower calorie dessert (not low cal, but lower than many desserts). Many reviewers wrote that they doubled the topping but that seemed like a lot of sugar and butter to me so I increased the topping by 1/2 and thought this was plenty, and I think even going with the topping as written would be enough. Got rave reviews from family and made it twice in one week due to family request.

My Mum & I loved this! I used fresh fruit instead of frozen (4 medium peaches & about 2 cups of blueberries) and doubled the topping as others have suggested. I also added a bit of ground ginger to the topping because I like cinnamon, nutmeg & ginger combination. Had it with a bit of ice cream for dessert and it was delicious. Excellent use of the very ripe peaches I had on hand. Will definitely make again!

Excellent, but I agree; double the topping.  I used pecans instead of almonds as I like them better.

Very good. I disagree with the reviews here to double the topping. It is too sweet and unhealthy with all that topping.  I would have rather done 1.5 of the topping or just what the recipe said.  The topping is overpowering when doubled.

I only added 2T brown sugar. Left out the white sugar. Used canned peaches, frozen blueberries, fresh blueberries. Increased cinnamon and nutmeg. 
I increased ingredients over all to make more. Need to increase oat mixture next time.

I doubled the topping and used fresh fruit (2.5 c blueberries and 5 small peaches) and it was the perfect amount. I also added zest from half a large lemon. I also baked at 375 fan for 30 minutes and then let it sit in the oven for 15 minutes with the oven off and the topping was perfectly crunchy and not burnt. Great recipe!

I'm not sure of my peach and berry amount since I had them unmarked in my freezer.  It turned out really good.  I like that it wasn't too sweet.  I will make this again since I didn't feel overwhelmed by many ingredients.  Quick, easy, and good!

This is simply delicious. I followed some advice on here and doubled the crisp topping. It really wasn't necessary, but it's still really good. Next time I will just follow to the T and I know it'll come out great.

Light summer dessert in less than an hour.  I used fresh Michigan blueberries and Starfire peaches.  Doubled the fill and topping from the recipe.  Baked in Corning Ware casserole dish. 
Added fresh whipped topping.  Turned out wonderful!

Very good!!  Did have to juggle my amounts of fruit to fit what was on hand.... My store-bought peaches weren't ready yet, so used a can of peaches, which I cut into bite-sized pieces.  Used the juice to help juice up the mixture.  Doubled the crisp.  Vanilla ice cream on top and it was all yummy!!

I didn't double the topping but I did add extra oatmeal and like others, I used fresh peaches and blueberries as they were in season.  Loved it! My only question is who came up with the idea to mix it all together in the pan?  Other recipes do this as well.  It seems really hard to keep the mess in the pan.  I would rather dirty one mixing bowl than my counter top!  Just personal preference.

My family loved this recipe. I doubled the topping ingredients as others suggested. I also used fresh blueberries and peaches because they were in season.  Very happy  with the flavors!

Super yummy. I had read someone else's review stating she had doubled the oat topping-I did the same nd I'm glad I doubled it because it felt better proportioned. Served warm with vanilla ice cream. This was really easy and a hit-we used hone grown

8.10.16 ~ I made this using fresh peaches and fresh blueberries, and it was delicious. I weighed the fruit to make sure I was using the same amount of ounces. That was a nice mixture of fruits. We liked that the topping was crunchy the first day, but it does get soft the second day.

Perfect summer desert. We picked fresh peaches from our tree and black berries from the berry bushes. Easy fast and tasty.

This was delicious. I used fresh blueberries and peaches. I didn't have almonds so I did without. I dotted the topping with extra bits of butter. It browned beautifully and was crunchy, I served it with whipped cream. Yummy!

Everyone loved it.  Used frozen strawberries, blueberries n blackberries.  Ground fresh cinnamin n nutmeg, couple dashes of bitters, topped w/homemade whipped cream.  Doubled the topping.
