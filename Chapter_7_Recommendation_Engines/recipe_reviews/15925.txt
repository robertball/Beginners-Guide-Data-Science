I'm constantly asked to make my version of this recipe.  Here's what I do differently that I think makes it better.

1. No onions.  (I think they just get in the way of the potato and cheese flavor)
2. Make extra cheese sauce (I think an extra half recipe of sauce will do it)
3. Put extra cheese in the sauce.  (at least an extra half cup, but to your taste)
4. Layer cheese sauce between layers of potatoes.  (make sure to grease the pan well or it's hard to get off after baked)
5. Sprinkle bread crumbs on top for extra crispiness.

I made two huge pans of this for a party with 30+ people and it all went.  Definitely a favorite of mine.

Made exactly as directed, only change being mincing the onion instead of rings, as I don't like the texture of onions in large chunks. One reason I chose this recipe was because I prefer whole, natural foods (avoiding processed cheese and cans of soup, for example), and it fit the bill for that well enough. Verdict: it's quite possibly the best cheesy-potato side I have ever tasted. Some reviewers have called it bland, but I prefer to term it comfort food. It's a creamy, cheesy, potato side dish. It doesn't have to have a special bite or kick to it, or evoke any particular area of the world. I adore all sorts of cuisines—Thai, Middle Eastern, Italian, Spanish, Japanese, you name it—but once in a while a lightly seasoned dish that lets you taste the potato, the cheese, the simple flour-and-milk sauce...once in a while that simplicity is the pefect complement to your meal.

Can you say.......disappeared faster than a speeding bullet?  I just made this as a side dish to my Christmas ham.  I doubled the recipe...used a lot more pepper than expected....used Cracker Barrel's Vermont extra sharp white cheddar ..... sauteed the onions with some garlic and butter before adding to layers....and slow cooked in crock pot (oven was full of ham).  WOW!!!  This recipe rocked.  I loved that it was so user friendly and easy to cook in the crock pot.  It is a must have to choose side dishes that can cook in a crock at the holidays.  Thank you 1,000 times over!!!!!!!

I thought this recipe was very, very good.  I will not make Au Gratin Potatoes from a box mix again!  I'm rating it 4 stars instead of 5 because I feel a few simple changes are needed.  I would mince the onion and mix it throughout the potatoes.  We did not care for the big, slimy rings of cheese-covered onions in the center of the dish, although we did like the flavor of the onions.  Also, a 1 quart casserole dish is too small for this recipe, use at least a 2 quart.  Another tip, which I'm sure many people are already aware of, is to spray the foil with a bit of cooking spray before putting it on the dish to keep the potatoes and cheese from sticking to it.  Finally, we like our potatoes to be golden brown on top, therefore I removed the foil for the last 15 - 20 minutes of cooking time.  Thanks for a very good recipe that we will enjoy many times over!!

I was hesitant to make this but all the raving reviews had me curious.  My family of 5 raved about these potatoes all through dinner, my husband said they're the best he's ever had! I added extra cheese as we are cheese fans.  I usually make mine by just adding shredded cheese, onion, flour and milk and bake which is delicious but these beat it!  Also a great tip, this is the same cheese sauce my family uses for homemade mac n cheese, if you use this recipe and pour it over cooked elbow macaroni and add extra shredded cheese on top then bake just a bit to melt, it's the best mac n cheese you've ever had! You could make a double batch and have the mac the next night with baked chicken.  Thanks Cathy

This was easy and delicious! I sliced then microwaved the potatoes for about 8 minutes to cut down on baking time. Then poured the cheese sauce over top and mixed with potato slices, then bake.

Good recipe, nice as a side w/baked ham.  Modified slightly by sauteeing onions 1st w/a bit of fresh/minced garlic for 4 min to reduce "raw" onion taste B4 adding to layers. Also agree to remove cover 15 min B4 serving to get a little crust or add a little buttered breadcrumbs to get a light topping. Convert this side dish recipe to a "one meal" casserole by adding left over chunks of ham (from a previous meal). This casserole is then yummy as brunch, lunch or supper.

Creamy, saucy and delicately flavored potatoes which are the perfect accompaniment to more robustly seasoned meats. Would be better, however, with onions chopped rather than sliced, and to uncover for the last 20 minutes to brown the top.

My husband and I loved this so much... My makin them out of the box days are over... I made just a couple changes... I sprinkled garlic powder on both layers of the potatoes...I also used marble cheddar and after I  poured the cheese mixture over I also topped it off with a bit more shredded cheese... I baked it covered like it said but uncovered it for the last 10 minutes and it gave it just the right amount of crispiness, just the way we like it... and for my husband I added just 1 more sprinkle of cheese to his on his plate... These are also great the next day served with eggs for breakfast...   
Kiki (Brampton,On,Canada) P S.. I wanted to add that I just made this again today (Oct 4th) and topped it off with some cooked and crumbled turkey bacon and sliced green onions.. Fabulous!!!

This was pretty good.  I have a habit of making high fat recipes into low fat ones.  This one was ok but not great using low fat cheese.  For some reason the cheese burned on the bottom.  I baked it in a glass dish.  If I had used full fat cheese I'm sure it would've been fabulous.  I save this recipe for special occasions and use the right cheese.

These were very good au gratin potatoes and I liked the fact that they didn't call for canned soup or Velveeta, because I didn't have either one on hand at the time.  I cut the potatoes MUCH thinner to speed up the cooking time (mine took about an hour), added an extra 1/2 cup of cheese, used half and half instead of milk for more creaminess, and added some minced garlic to the cheese sauce (I sauteed the garlic in the butter before adding the flour).  For those of you who are ending up with lumpy or greasy results, you're not heating and/or blending your cheese sauce enough before adding it to the potatoes and onions.  Use a whisk to incorporate the milk a little at a time until it's all mixed in, then be sure the cheese is completely melted and the sauce is smooth and creamy before pouring it over the potatoes.  Use a fork to move the potatoes around a bit so the sauce can work its way down to the bottom layers and you won't end up with plain, bland potatoes at the bottom of the dish and your cheese sauce won't bubble over the top (I filled my pan FULL and didn't have one drop bubble over).  I also removed the foil for the last 10 minutes to get that nice brown crust on top.  I'll definitely make these again, but next time I think I'll add a little cayenne pepper for a bit of a kick.

I was planning on making this for dinner, but forgot to look at the recipe until about 1hr before dinner time.  I started to panic, but I decided to improvise, and I may just use these short cook time directions from now on!  I sliced the potatoes and boiled them for about 10min.  While the potatoes were cooking, I choppped the onion and sauted them in the butter, then finished the cheese sauce as written.  I put the potatoes and sauce together and baked for ~30 min at 350F.  Turned out perfectly!

Good overall, but on the bland side. Found the onions sliced into rings changed the overall texture and appearance of this dish.  Also, potatoes sliced at 1/4 inch were not done at 1.5 hours.  Perhaps diced onions vs sliced would have been a better fit which is why I am only rating this 3 stars.

These potatoes are the real thing...brought me back to my childhood and pot luck suppers at the church...I mutiplied the recipe for 30 people and added ham for a main meal dish...nary a disappointed soul in the lot...makes me chuckle a bit when reviewers say that they were bland so they added this and this and this...like saying a peanut butter and jelly sandwich is a little bland so they added bananas, cinnamon, and raisins...folks, this is how au gratin potatoes are SUPPOSE to be...

This is a classic French dish that is a great comfort food.  As for anyone who thought the taste was bland, you should know that you cannot use a mild or even medium cheddar with any Cheddar cheese sauce or it will be bland.  You have to use a sharp/old cheddar to get the cheddar flavour to come through.

I've made this recipe MANY times and although it is good as written, I find it a bit bland. For people who like very plain food, make it as written. If not, add a lot of seasoning. I sprinkle saesoned salt, onion and garlic powder and pepper on top of each potato layer. Also, I've mixed 3/4C chive sour cream into 1-1/4C 2% milk and slowly mixed it into the roux and it came out VERY good this way. I like doing a swiss/cheddar mix too and prefer it with red potatoes, but I use whatever's on hand. I'll usually make it several hours in advance and leave in the frige until baking. And although 1-1/2 hours seems like too long to bake, it's actually just right- take the foil off last 20 mins or so. One year for X-mas Eve, I did this in the slow cooker (maybe 5 hours on med.) with Gruyerre and Havarti in between each layer and that was the best ever, but was expensive, time consuming and calorie-packed so haven't done it again since. Next time I think I'll add spiral ham and Jalapenos for a one dish dinner, with a salad. I would consider this a 'Very Good Basic Recipe' but for our taste, needs to be jazzed up. Bonus: Re-heats well too.*****UPDATE: I added a layer of chopped broccoli florets in the middle and it was really good. Probably too long to cook broccoli, it was really soft. Reminded me of broccoli cheese soup, in casserole form.

I love this recipe!  I use this cheese sauce for everything now!  When I used it for mac and cheese, I especially noticed that the sauce was kind of grainy.  After mentioning it to a few people, I was informed that it was because I used the bags of already shredded cheese (they are covered with a powdery substance).  While it's not as noticeable in this recipe, I did dig out my cheese grater.  I am all about short-cuts though, so I did still use the frozen sliced potatoes and frozen chopped onions.  It cuts the prep and baking time by a lot!  I also like to take off the foil for the last 10 minutes of baking, add more cheese and crumbled bacon.

The flavor in this was wonderful, but I hope my review will help some others out!  I followed the recipe for this exactly, except that I doubled it so we'd have enough to serve all our guests for Christmas dinner, and omitted the onions because my family just doesn't really like onions.  I put it in a glass casserole dish and baked at 400.  An hour later, I opened the oven to put in the other side dishes, and saw that the cheese sauce was burning on the top and bottom of the dish!  Fortunately, the cheesy potatoes in between the burnt parts was delicious, so we were able to salvage about half of it.  So, please learn from my experience.  First off, either make sure you don't use glass, or if you do, reduce the temperature at which you bake it to 350.  Also, make sure you cover the dish with foil for the first hour of baking.  Remove the foil for the last 30 minutes.  One of our dinner guests was a culinary specialists, so he gave me these tips.  :)  I will be attempting this again, and will update if I can.  But in the meantime, I hope my review helps save someone else from burning and/or ruining their potatoes.

I really enjoyed these potatoes. I decided to follow the modifications some previous reviewers used by sauteeing the onions with a little garlic before adding them to the casserole. Wow! The aroma and the flavor this simple step added was well worth the little bit of extra time. I also added 1/2 cup parmesan, and cayenne pepper in the cheese sauce for a little heat. Make sure your pan is high sided enough or the filling will leak and fill your kitchen with smoke. Also, if you're using an aluminum foil pan, it's good to seal the bottom well with some aluminum foil, that way no filling will leak out of the bottom, and if it does it will be caught in the foil wrapper. Another good tip is to place your potato slices in a bowl of cold water until you're ready to layer them so that they don't oxidize before you're ready to use them (just drain them into a colander when you're ready). Thanks for this recipe, I use it all the time now.

I took the advice of most others and sliced the potatoes very thin (the lowest setting on my slicer).  
I also sauteed the chopped onions with pressed garlic in butter before adding to the potatoes.  
I had three layers of potatoes and added extra shredded cheese and the onion mixture between each layer.  
I made sure the milk mixture was thick and creamy prior to pouring onto potatoes.  (I used 2 cups of cheese instead of 1-1/2.)
As I poured the milk mixture, I gently lifted the potato layers so the mixture could seep down between the layers.  
I still had some bubbling over in the oven but not much.
This dish was tasty and went well with the ham I cooked in the slow cooker.
This is a good base cream sauce to use in other dishes as well.
Make sure you add salt/pepper to your taste otherwise it can be bland.

Ten stars!! Wow....these are so much better than the boxed au gratin potatoes could ever be. Served these potatoes with a pork loin and "pan-fried asparagus" (also found on this site) for Easter dinner. Fabulous...family raved. I made a few changes to the prep of the casserole. Recipe called for 4 potatoes...I cut 2 thinly and layered them with the onion and salt/pepper for the first layer. I then poured half of the cheese sauce over it and added a little more shredded cheese. Repeated with the second layer of potatoes and onions and sauce. Covered and cooked for 1 1/2 hrs at 375. I then removed the foil and cooked for another 20-25 min to slightly brown the top. Heavenly....will make again! Thanks Cathy for a delicious recipe..a true keeper!

Hey wait! This is my world famous recipe for scalloped/gratin potatoes! :-D
Trust me - this is a never fail recipe.  My husband HATED all potato dishes (He's Irish, go figure!) until I made this the first time. He was very hesitant to try it. Fortunately, he adored these. The key I have found (and from what I have deduced from eating my mother-in-law's)is the cooking time. If the potatoes are even remotely hard, the whole dish will flop. As a result, I ALWAYS cook my potatoes an hour and a half, sometimes two, depending on the density of the cheese mix. I understand that some parboil first but I find that is one too many steps and one too many pots. Don't be intimidated by putting together a basic cheese sauce. It is like gravy -once you figure it out, it will be the easiest thing you will ever make and you will never understand what all the fuss is about. My criteria for when I make this dish isn't always when we are having ham for supper but usually when we have too much, expiring-soon cheese. This is a fantastic way to use up whatever left over cheese you have in the fridge. I just throw them all in -it always works, even when using some rather offbeat cheeses (etc, blue brie!)I rarely give five stars, but would this time since this dish is very easy, inexpensive (especially if you were going to chuck the cheese to the garbage anyways)kiddie (and Wolseley) approved and an absolute classic.  You will never use a bagged mix again!

I made this recipe for the first time today and after reading some of the reviews beforehand, I made just a few adjustments. I had read that some thought it needed just a wee bit more flavor so I added 1/4 tsp. pepper, 1/4 tsp. garlic powder and 1 tsp. of dried mustard to the sauce in the pan.  Wow!  If there was a sixth star, I would give it!  Tips or reminders would be to make sure you cook the butter, flour, salt, milk mixture until it has thickened before adding the cheese and I added the extra seasonings before the cheese as well. Another tip would be to remind that it says onion "rings" so you want to separate the slices into rings by pulling them apart. I also added some freshly ground black pepper to the top before baking. 400F for an hour and a half sounded a little too high so I baked it at 350F and it was done to perfection at an hour and a half without burning or over-cooking.  This recipe will definitely be on our favorites list and I know my husband is just going to love these tonight!  Thank you!

I agree with other reviewers to make half-batch more of the sauce.  I, like others before me, also pop the potatoes in a steamer and steam them in the microwave for about 8 minutes.  It reduces the oven time to about 40 minutes.  I have been making this recipe for several years, so that says how much we enjoy it.  Every special occasion it is served in our home.

The best au gratin potatoes I've ever eaten or made.  I did add about 1/2 c extra cheese to the sauce, and substituted onion powder (1/4 tsp) instead of the onion rings.  I used the thick slice grater part of my cheese grater to slice the potatoes thin, since I don't have a mandolin.  Were just the right thickness for my liking.  I think next time I'll either bake these for a shorter time, or on a lower temp, because the edges and bottom were quite browned.  I took the foil off for the last 20 min, and it browned nicely.  Will add this one to my collection.

I think some of the difference people experience in making this recipe is because of the potatoes.  I live near Idaho and the Russets that I can buy are probably twice the size of those in other areas.  When I used the number of potatoes called for, I didn't have enough sauce.  It might help to know the amount of potatoes in pounds instead of quantity.  I used whole wheat flour for the sauce, less cheese, diced the onions, and added more milk to stretch the sauce.  I used the slow cooker on "low" and it was ready in 3-4 hours, which was exactly what I suspected with 1/4" sliced potatoes.  All in all, we loved the simplicity, yet versatility of the recipe...it can be morphed into a thousand other recipes with a few simple changes.

My version is different than this - but both are good! I never use onions , nor do I make a cheese sauce.Instead rub a garlic clove around the dish.Layer potatoes,  cheese (and I use gruyere,)and CREAM alternate, ending with  cream . This is how the french chef made it in the restaurant I worked in.

Sometimes simple is better as is the case here.  I agree that a few simple tweaks might be beneficial such as adding a little more cheese and browning the top during the last portion of baking time but over all this is a great dish!!

I've made this multiple times now and have played around with the seasonings...honestly, it's good as is. My husband prefers the onions diced, i like them sliced in thin rings...either way yields the same results. I usually add a bay leaf to the rue while it's thickening. I've also par-boiled the potatoes to shorten cooking time, otherwise the hour and a half stands. . And i usually bake at 375 with whatever else i'm making. Delicious!

delicious, loved the hint of onion flavour & aromat. Goes really well with braais & roast dishes. Mmm. (don't make too much extra cheese sauce though). I tried adding breadcrumbs like one of the other reviewers suggested, and it burnt horribly, I don't recommend it. I would try putting the breadcrumbs just before removing from oven.

I wanted to make this for Easter so I have been testing it for the past few weeks and it has been a let down every time.  I can make a white sauce, but this ends up lumpy and not at all creamy after I get it out of the oven.  I have tried three times now and it just isn't working out.  I am trying again this week, with some modifications.  Hopefully it turns out but I have a back up potato recipe on stand-by.  I saw that another reviewer had this problem as well.  Any suggestions....?  UPDATE:  Still didn't work out.  I am giving up!!!

These were absolutely fantastic!!! The few changes I made were to use a 2 qt. casserole dish, sliced the potatoes a lot thinner which cut the cooking time to just under an hour, 2 cups of medium cheddar cheese and I diced and sauteed the onions (not a huge fan of whole or crunchy onions, just personal preference) and added to them to the cheese sauce before I did the layering. I had 5 layers and after adding the sauce to a layer, I would move the potatoes around a bit with a fork to get the sauce evenly distributed. I also let the potatoes cook for the last 10 minutes without the foil. I will make these again and again! Next time will try the breadcrumbs. You have to love user reviews!

This was my first try at Au Gratin potatoes and they sure came out great! I only changed two things about this recipe. One, I chopped the onion up pretty good, I'm not a fan of the large slices. And two, which I was pretty nervous about, was I used my crock pot instead of the oven. It worked great! I set it on high and I was so pleased! Not only did my husband and friends LOVE them but my hubby and I enjoyed frying the left overs up the next day with some eggs and sausage. Thanks so much for sharing this!

We really enjoyed this.  Like others, I diced the onions, increased the amount of sauce and added extra shredded cheddar between the layers of potatoes.  I've also, at times, added different varieties, other than just cheddar cheese and it has always turned out very well.  I like to make homemade bread crumbs to add to the top for a little texture too.  Thank you for a great recipe!

These were okay, but they were bland and just didn't have the flavor I thought they would.  The sauce was very watery while preparing; not what I expected.  I did wait until it was thick enough to coat the back of the spoon, but it didn't get any thicker than that.  I recommend using a larger baking dish than suggested since the sauce filled the entire dish to the rim and started overflowing slightly while baking.  When I took it out of the oven the top was very watery, but I mixed it together and it thickened.  All in all, they were decent au gratin potatoes but I don't think I'll make them again.  It wasn't worth the time and effort.  Thanks for the recipe.

Anyone who thinks the boxed version of these are better than this recipe has gotta be outta their mind...either that or they did something wrong b/c these were fabulous!! EVERYONE raved about these potatoes. I added a dash of garlic/onion powders when I added the flour/salt and used sharp cheddar cheese. For some reason, mine were done in 1 hour but all the sooner we can eat these great potatoes!! I guarantee these will appear on my dinner table again!! Thanks Cathy!!

This recipe was very, very good.  However I modified it just a little.  I added two cups of Kraft Sharp Chedder instead of a 1 1/2 cups and I also seasoned the potatoes with Lawry's season salt.  I cooked the potatoes for 2 hours because they were still hard at an hour and a half. This was very easy to make and tasted delicious!!!

The best Au Gratin Potato recipe ever! Made this last night and LOVED it! Like other reviewers, I medium diced the onion and used 1 1/2 times the sauce recipe. I doubled the cheese to 3 cups. I also added 2 tsp. of dry mustard powder to the sauce. I used about 2 pounds of potatoes, and a 9X13 well-buttered baking dish, since the increased sauce would mean it wouldn't fit into a one quart pan. I baked it, covered with foil for one hour at 375 and then uncovered it for another 20-30 minutes. It browned really nicely. Planning to make this again for a family Easter dinner next week! Perfection!

This is almost exactly how I have made my au gratins all my life. I agree with the previous comment, there is a difference between au gratin and scalloped potatoes. If there is cheese in them, they are au gratin, with plain white sauce they are scalloped. I use red potatoes, sometimes precooked first. I chop the onions small, and never layer, always mix the cheese sauce completely with the potatoes and onions before baking it.

I made this recipe for an early easter dinner, everyone raved.  I only made one change.  Instead of the sliced onions I sprinkled minced dry onion between the layers of potato.  It gave the dish the onion flavor w/o turning my children away from trying it.
Thanks for a great alternative to mashed potatoes

Very yummy, but some reviewers are right..add just a little more cheese.  And if you're worried about the potatoes being bland and want to reduce bake time, soak the sliced spuds in cold salt water for an hour or so and them put them on the stove to parboil (same water).  That gives much more flavor that a salt shaker on the table just can't handle.  I also used fresh potatoes from my garden; reds, whites, and blues for a neopolitan effect.  Very pretty.

So Good!!  I made these potatoes for a party and everyone loved them!  I baked them for 1 hour the night before and finished them off the day of the party (45 minutes without the foil).  I followed the recipe as written with one exception.  I made a triple batch but I did not triple the onion.  It looked like enough with just one onion.  
I sliced the potatoes thinner than 1/4 inch.  I used my food processor so it would go faster.  The thin potatoes worked just fine.  
I used two 9 x 13 pans with a triple batch.  I will definitely make these again. MMMMM.

Absolutely delicious! I made 8 servings (the original recipe is 4 servings) so that I could have leftovers for the week, but there were no leftovers! They loved them and raved about them. I made them exactly as described, except, like others i added a handful of cheddar cheese and left uncovered the last ten minutes of cooking. I served it with the herb rubbed sirloin tip roast (also a recipe from this site) and my family hardly said two words at dinner...they were too busy eating!

There are traditional Au Gratin Potatoes.  Even though they are a lot of work since you have to make a roux, they really are worth the effort.  i will make them on occation as a special treat, but I do usually cheat and use an easier recipe if I am in a hurry.

I've made this recipe twice so far, and it's great! It's savory and satisfying and easy to prepare. It takes a while to cook, but it's worth it.

Excellent dish.  Only change is I would chop the onions and sauté them before mixing in with potatoes.  Otherwise 10 stars!!!

I thought this was pretty tasty and everyone seemed to really like it.

I made a few changes: instead of onions, I simply sprinkled each layer (2) with onion powder. I used 1/2 & 1/2 to richen it up, instead of just milk. To the sauce I added some garlic, black pepper and cayenne pepper. I put the cheese sauce between layers.

Next time I think I'll experiment with cheeses...perhaps make half of it gouda. Also maybe sprinkle the top with some paprika.

I had to use a 13x9 pan because there was no way 4 sliced potatoes were going to fit in anything smaller. Obviously better than a boxed mix but there is work involved. Made the potato slices real thin, sprinkled on garlic powder and sauteed diced onion. Delicious.

Great recipe - bit hit with the hubster. This can come together much more quickly if you slice the potatoes and onions in the food processor (separately).  Faster still if you keep the skin on the spuds - which I do when we aren't having guests! I also find that this dish cooks more quickly than what the recipe states - usually 45 mins of bake time and it's nicely browned on the bottom.

Solid recipe. The cheese sauce is creamy and good. Like previous reviewers I diced the onions instead of making rings. The only other change was I added more salt,pepper and garlic powder. Just good old fashioned comfort food !!!

I have made this recipe several times, all successful.  I do prefer the diced onions and I like to use heavy whipping cream instead of milk.  I have used both sliced and diced potatoes with the same results.  If you follow step 3 and have made cheese sauce before, you can gauge if it's going to be soupy or not and adjust with extra or less cream/milk and cheese as needed.  If you have not made cheese sauce before, it has to warm slowly and be thick (gravy-ish) before adding the cheese and sometimes I have to add a little more cream once I do add the cheese. If you heat it too fast and curdle the milk, you will get the globs of cheese everyone has talked about. It does separate a little in the oven (though far less if you make the cheese sauce correctly), as you can see from the photos, but it's cheesy goodness and my family has never complained.  I just use whatever cheese I have on hand, sometimes blending several together, and have never had a problem.  Parmesan adds a nice flavor.

I have made a similar recipe in the past using 1 can cream of mushroom soup mixed with 1/3 cup milk and black pepper,  layered with shredded cheese, potatoes & onions and it was a million times more tasty.  This recipe lacked flavor and the cheese is lumpy.  Looks unattractive.

De-lish! Made these last night for my boyfriend's family and everyone loved them! Took suggestions from other viewers (thank you) cut potatoes thinner, boiled them sliced for ten minutes, used half and half instead of milk(much creamier) layer sauce on top of the first layer and then the second. Put onion powder, garlic powder and cayenne between layers, cooked bacon bits on top. Cooked for 40 mins at 350 and removed foil with 20 mins left and that's when I added the chives. Thanks for a great recipe!

excellent side dish - simple to make but a crowd pleaser. the onions really enhance the dish, so mince them if you are feeding people who 'think' they don't like onions.

These are great potatoes that definitely beat boxed au gratin potatoes any day.  They are very easy to make, especially if you have a food processor that slices the potatoes for you.  The only reason I gave this recipe 4 stars is because if you make it as is they tend to be rather bland and dry.  I added a local seasoning we have in my area called Raven's seasoning and freshly ground pepper to each potato layer.  The Raven's is basically a seasoning salt.  I didn't double the cheese sauce and I thought they were too dry, especially the next day.  Next time I make these I will either double the sauce, or put in one and a half the amount of sauce.  Great basic recipe though.

These were great and easy to make.  I never took the time before to make au grautin potatoes from scratch.  I did double the cheese and also used more milk.  I substituted part of the milk with cream.  Yummy!

I made this recipe almost exactly a written.  I used only a half of an onion as that's all I had, and 1 cup cream, 1 cup milk, as my milk was low and I found some cream in the fridge.  I also sprinkled extra pepper on the top after adding the cheese sauce.  
It was AWESOME.  My husband and I both loved it, and I will definitely make this one again.  I took the tin foil off after the 1.5 hours and let it brown, and the potatoes were done perfectly.  I used regular cheddar, and I didn't find it bland at all.
Thanks for posting this keeper!!!

I was so excited to make these, as i love au gratin potatoes. I finally made these last night with meatloaf and sauteed string beans.  The taste was good, as i seasoned through each layer, however, i just wasn't found of "all" the sauce, i thought it was a bit much.  But my main issue was the buttery film and residue that arose to the top of the dish.  Ewww, i didn't like that at all, but i didn't notice anyone else mentioning that problem.  Overall, it was ok, just unsure if i would try it again.

I made this as written and was totally turned off by the whole onion rings.  Since then I have made these creamy potatoes many times, just substituting chopped onions for the whole.  You can change the flavor by using different cheeses.

This is delicious!! Solid comfort food its really hard to stop eating it.  I made mine in a crockpot cooked it on high for 4 hours.  Definitely layer the potatoes onions and cheese sauce!! I chopped my onions instead of slicing them into rings. Also, doubled the cheese sauce and added more than double the cheese. DELICIOUS!

This is a classic dish.If you are concerned that your potatoes won't get done, drop them in boiling salted water and bring them back to boil for a minute or so. Drain, and continue.  Another good tip that I've been doing is use a can of Cream of Mushroom soup (10 OZ) and the remainder of the milk (3/4 cup) to make a very rich, creamy sauce.  Use a good extra sharp cheddar and avoid the packaged shredded cheddar from the dairy case.  This will give you the most decadent comfy dish ever.  Just give the sauce a taste and you won't be able to wait to bake it and get it to the table!!!  Enjoy

This is by far the best base recipe for Au Gratin Potatoes. I get asked for this dish all the time. I have since made a lot of tweeks to it. I use half cheddar and half swiss, I use half & half rather than milk and I process my onions into a pulp for a more creamy sauce before cooking in the butter. Those people picky about onions have no idea there is even onion in it! Its also a yummy sauce for mac n' cheese as well.

YUM!  Thats all I can really say.  My potatoes were small, and then I sliced too much so I ended up doubling my recipe.  I followed others suggestions and I chopped and sauteed my onion first, then added my cornstarch (didn't have flour).  It all fit nicely in my lasagna pan and was OH SO GOOD.  I also added some heavy dashes of garlic powder, onion powder and black pepper to my cheese mixture, as other reviews said  it was bland.  Will make again.  Goodbye boxed au gratins!  Thank you Cathy!

These really were creamy and flavorful. I followed the instructions and the sauce came out perfectly with no lumps,just the right amount of milk and cheese. The only thing I'll do differently next time is to leave all the extra salt out. My sharp Cheddar had plenty of salt in it to make this dish tasty.Don't season until the very end, you may not need to.

Very good recipe. I never make changes on the original recipe the first time. I see no point in rewriting a recipe that someone else has submitted unless there is a ingredient you don't like. Bottom line  I would make again with no changes.

This is a great recipe, but I assemble a bit differently. Typically I double or triple this recipe. I assemble with three layers and do not add the cheese to the cream sauce. I layer a third of the potatoes, sauce, chopped onion (rather than rings) and sprinkle with sharp grated cheddar cheese. I repeat with a second layer of potatoes. Lastly I place the third layer of potatoes on top and pour the remaining sauce on top of the potatoes. Then I shave some butter and dot the top layer with the butter. I use between 1-3 Tablespoons of butter, depending how many potatoes I have made used in the recipe. We prefer using redskins to russets. This recipe is a hit at our Easter and Christmas dinners.

Great all-purpose recipe for cream based dishes. The potatoes were awesome! I boiled the potatoes first for 10 min. as well to cut down on baking time.. Worked great. I've used this same "recipe" before for Mac and cheese.. The first time was great. The second time was unsuccessful. The problem? Do not use cheese already shredded in the bag! It has a higher oil content and will not melt properly causing clumping and overall nastiness! Break out your cheese grater and use a good quality cheese. It makes all the difference! Hope you all enjoy the recipe. I did. Going to use a sharp white cheddar and Swiss cheese blend next time.. Happy eating!

I had a little trouble with the sauce since the instructions weren't really clear to me, but the end result was good.

Pure comfort food.  I used the food processor to slice the potatoes and onions and shred the cheese which made this an easy side dish.  Only deviation I made from the recipe was to add some of the cheese sauce to the first layer of potatoes and sliced onions.  I then poured the rest of the sauce over the second layer of potatoes.  I did take off the foil at the end of baking to allow the potatoes to brown for about 10 minutes.  Very nice recipe.

These were wonderful!  I used about half velveeta and half mozzarella cheese in this, it was very creamy.  I also added some garlic powder with the salt and pepper, then topped it with crumbled bacon.  Thanks for sharing.

I prepared this as directed.  Still not sure why it was so bland but my family has requested that I not make this again.  My fiancee said that the au gratin potatoes out of the box have a better taste.  What a shame, this recipe looked so good and was such a disappointment.

I've made this several times, but the last time I did something a little different that everyone loved, I caramelized the onions first in a saute pan with butter and kept the rest of the recipe the same.  Something about the sweetness of the caramelized onion really added a nice extra flavor to this dish.  Still a keeper!

Followed recipe EXACTLY as written, all I got was giant burnt on mess, and a curdled cheese soupy-undercooked casserole. My suggestion- try another recipe. I have no idea how this could have turned out so terrible.

I didn't have enough cheddar cheese for the recipe so I used half cheddar and half velveeta.  All of my kids loved it!  The leftovers I simmered with milk on the stovetop until the potatoes cooked apart.  I added chopped bacon and sour cream...topped with more cheese and we had loaded potato soup!

like most things i cook i tweeked this.  I was making this for 18 and it called for over 5 cups of cheese.  I am far to cheap to buy 5 cups of shreaded cheese and far to lazy to do the shreading myself.  So i added one cup of shreaded chedder cheese and two cans of Cheese Soup from that famous maker.  I sent this with my husband for the guys and everyone of them LOVED it.  I was greatful i kept some aside for myself.  Very Very Simple to make and very very tasty.  I will make this over and over and over.  A+

I'm making this tonight, and I can already tell this is going to be a winner.  I will be adding a pinch of nutmeg to the sauce, as I do with all white sauces, to make it "pop".

This came out awful. The cheese curdled up, and I wound up dumping the entire batch in the trash. Next time i will use a creamy cheese sauce base or soup and add cheese and onions to it.

I wanted a creamy restaurant style potato and that's what this recipe is.  Very good.  My changes were to omit the onion and instead add some onion powder to the bechamel while it is thickening.  I used about a cup or more of colby plus 1/2 cup mozzarella but this would be good with a variety of different cheeses.  Also, I prefer Yukon Gold potatoes since they have a creamier texture to begin with.  I used 6 Yukons for this recipe.  I layered the potatoes and cheese sauce in a 9 x 13 pan to bake.  Fantastic!!!

This is an excellent recipe!  I make the same dish with the following changes. 

I changed the amount of cheese to four cups of sharp shredded cheese.  I also add more cheese to the top of the dish.  

I finely chop the onions instead of slicing.  The onions seem to incorporate into the dish better when they are chopped.  

I use ground white pepper instead of black pepper.

This is a great recipe. My husband and teenage boys really enjoyed it. I will make this again.
( Remember to put your sliced potato's in cold water while you are preparing the cheese sauce so that the potato's don't turn brown. Be sure to drain all water off the potato's and pat dry with paper towel before you put the recipe together)
Enjoy.. We did.

Having never made this from scratch, I experimented with different cheeses as suggested (Kraft Triple Cheddar). Not a good move. The Vermont and Sharp Cheddar didn't melt well, which I should have known, and the sauce was gritty because of that. The flavor other wise was definitely there. I would definitely use just a mild Cheddar or other soft cheese next time. Also a larger baking pan. Mine ran over and what a smokey mess! I will definitely hold onto to this recipe and make it again. Beats the boxed stuff and not really hard to make.

I cooked the potatoes, peeled them while warm, refrigerated them overnight, cut them in slices. The onions I sauteed in olive oil with some all seasoning until charred but not overcooked. I followed the rest of the instructions on the recipe but cut the baking time in half. Last 10 minutes I broiled and got the golden crisp edges on the potatoes that made them so provocative. Served as a side dish with glazed ham, quinoa salad and ceasar's salad. Excellent meal.

Very easy and tasty, thanks Cathy. I just want to share one slight modification I have made...I sauteed the onion rings in olive oil before adding them to the potatoes, which gave them a nice flavor and a softer bite.

I made this with sweet potatoes and caramelized onions. A few leaves of freshly chopped sage and fresh nutmeg add "fall" flavor to the sauce.

I make cheesy potatoes every Easter and the recipe is essentially the same, except I do mince the onions and I also add a few dashes of red pepper and thyme for flavor.  I also take off the foil and let the top get good and brown. My hubby's favorite side dish!  Also, do add cut up ham or cooked sausage etc. for a one dish meal.

I didn't care for this recipe at all. It tasted fine but the cheese sauce just sat on the potatoes and it never really came together like the many other au gratin recipes I have made. It was easy to put together though.

I can't say enough about how fabulous this recipe is ! They are creamy and rich and oh-so-yummy, my boyfriend hates onions but he couldn't even tell they were in there! I will DEFINITELY be making these again, and I think I will add some crumbled bacon to the top as suggested by other reviewers. Also, I parboiled the potatoes first as well, it definitely cut down the baking time, i only had to bake them in the oven for about 25-30 minutes and they were cooked perfectly. Thanks again for a wonderful recipe that we will enjoy many times !

I thought this recipe was a good base.  I added tabasco and mustard powder to the flour mix before adding the cheese.  This may be the missing flavor viewers are looking for.

The recipe is good but needs one change. The flour needs to be weighed not just measured. For a roux to work properly it needs to be equal parts fat and flour by weight not by volumn. So the flour should be 1.5 ozs. That way the roux will look like wet sand in the pan, which is what it should look like. With that adjustment this recipe is fantastic. Will deffinatly make it again.

Delicious! My husband also loved the leftovers in the morning with his eggs. Definitely use a bigger casserole dish...at least a 2 quart one. Thanks for a great recipe!

I have been making this recipe for several months now and have modified it slightly to our tastes.  I carmelize the onions in butter which adds a mild sweet taste.  I also add two cloves of minced garlic to the cheese sauce.  Another variation I have used is to add horseradish to the cheese sauce.  I frequently make this for guests and get rave reviews each time.  Excellent for buffets too.

If you have a recipe then post it. It takes just as much effort to post as it does to rate and you will get the credit and recognition you so clearly think you deserve (but probably don't). I made this as directed and it was fantastic!! All crdir goes to the original recipe poster.

This was perfect. Follows everything exactly as listed. I happen to really like onions so next time I may add a few more. For those of you who need to prep ahead of time, I put all of this together the night before but did not cook it until the next day. I was a little worried about the ingredients sitting in the fridge over night but everything came out great.

Ok, I am lazy, and there is no need to go to all this trouble.  I mixed the flour in with the milk, and then just threw it all in a pan, mixed it and stuck it in the oven.  I didn't melt anything, there's no way I'm going to mess with a saucepan of melting cheese.  I just stirred it every half hour while it was baking.  It was great!  I will never buy one of those Betty Crocker mixes again.

When making the cheese sauce, add garlic powder (couple smacks on the back), salt and pepper. 

I used 3 russet large potatoes

USE PAM ON THE PAN or it will stick!! I added garlic powder, salt, pepper in the cheese sauce and only a handful of cheese. I HIGHLY encourage you to dice the onions, don't leave them as rings.  When you begin to layer, begin with one layer of cheese sauce, followed by a later of potatoes, layer of diced onions (all or 1/2), layer of cheese, then layer of sauce. REPEAT.  don't add salt to every layer because the cheese sauce has enough salt already. just add pepper to each potato layer. End it with a cheese topping.  Also it took me over about 1hr 50 mins of baking in the oven.  400 degrees covered for the first 1:30 minutes and uncovered for 20 minutes to get a nice browning on the outside and get the cheese sauce to thicken nicely.  (PS I USED REDUCED FAT SHARP CHEDDAR CHEESE---WORKED AWESOME!) This was a major hit with no left overs! No one even knew it was reduced fat cheese. =) I will most definitely be using this recipe more often!!

Absolutely love this recipe! as per other reviewers I minced about 3/4 cup of yellow onion, and sauteed in a little butter. I salted and peppered every layer also adding the sauteed onions to each layer, then sauce.  I did get 3 layers. I used two large russet baker potatoes sliced on my cheap mandolin slicer.  I used my Le Creuset stoneware baking dish (1 1/4 quart size) size worked perfectly.  I sprayed the baking dish with olive oil spray, other reviewers mentioned that the cooked on cheese sauce and potatoes were very hard to get off of the pan. with this pan the cheese sauce that baked and burned onto the top of the pan, I was actually able to just rinse off with water. came right off!   once I added the three layers of potatoes, and all the sauce it was quite full.  I sprayed the foil with olive oil as other reviewers suggested, covered and baked for 1 hour, uncovered for the last 30 mins.  I will uncover sooner or bake slightly longer next time (for my oven) I thought the sauce was going to be too much and was going to be soupy.  after coming out of the oven and letting it set for about 15 minutes.  it was Perfect.  I absolutely will  make this again and again.  I used Sharp cheddar, topped with a little extra.  Will not buy boxed again.  YUM!  thank you for sharing your wonderful recipe.

Need to look out for the salt. I made it too salty. Beside that, it tasted delicious :)
Cook in oven for 1 hour, then 10 min without the foil. Gives a more firm top.

I made this last night for dinner along with a ham - it's real comfort food. The only alteration I did was to add some dry mustard and nutmeg. Also chopped the onion up in a food processor per some of the other reviews. Just a thought - if your potatoes have been refrigerated, it might be best to pour half the sauce in when you've layered half of the potatoes. Otherwise, the sauce seems to congeal and sit on top of a completed dish, although it eventually wends its way downward once it's exposed to heat. I ended up with a little extra sauce which I put on some homemade sourdough bread and snacked on. Kind of a cardiologist's nightmare, but, my, it tasted great.

These potatoes are fantastic! I've made it twice, once with chopped raw onions, and once with lightly sauted onions.  We really preferred the sauted onions.I put them ino the cheese sauce when it was done cooking.   Not such a strong taste, but still add nice flavour.  Be sure to take your time with the sauce, adding only a 1/2 cup cheese at a time, stir and make sure it is completely melted. Use only Old Cheddar, layer the potatoes, add some sauce, layer again and more sauce.  That way the potatotes are coated well.  My family also likes spice, so I added 1/2 tsp each paprika, pepper and nutmeg.  YUMMY

I've never made Au Gratin before and was surprised how easy it is! The taste and texture is so better than the boxed kind and cheaper too (if you don't go adding extra cheese!!lol). I read through the reviews and increased the sauce by 1/2 and glad I did as it would have been too dry other wise. I used 1c of heavy cream and almost a pound of extra sharp cheddar. I also finely diced and sauteed the onion and put that in the middle of the potatoes along with about 1/3 of the cheese sauce. Topped the dish up with extra spuds and poured the rest of the sauce on top. Baked covered 70 minutes and 20 with the cover off. Looked marvelous! Wish I had remembered to take a photo! Everybody at the beach potluck loved it!

These were pretty good.  I would definitely recommend using a very sharp cheddar for flavor.  I think I would like these better if the cheese was sprinkled between the layers of potatoes.  The cheese flavor seemed to disappear somewhat in the final dish.  I used chopped onions and sprinkled them throughout each layer.  I'll probably continue to use this recipe, but I'll do some tweaking for our tastes.

I like this recipe because I always have the ingredients for the cheese sauce and it doesn't call for a "cream of" soup.  Nice, smooth, creamy, cheesy sauce.

Is there a way to give this 10 stars?! Seriously, it was the best part of our Thanksgiving this year! I chopped the onion finely and sauteed it in butter to mellow out the flavor of onion (my hubby doesn't like onions) then layered them in the middle of the potatoes. I also sliced my potatoes smaller than 1/4 inch the day before and stored them in a bag in the fridge (one less thing to do on Thanksgiving!). I also had about 1/4 cup grated cheese left over so I sprinkled that and a handful of parmesan on top - DO THIS!! It gave it a nice layer of goodness on top. Also, when I poured my sauce over my potatoes, I worried about it getting all the way to the bottom, so I jiggled the casserole dish a lot before putting it in the oven. And finally, I had to pull it out 15 minutes before time was up (I mean, I had to get the rolls in!) and it turned out perfect! My potatoes were perfectly cooked, not mushy at all! Overall, it was a perfect side dish to redeem my overly dry ham. :)

this is an awesome recipe! i substituted 1 1/4 cup of heavy cream & 3/4 cup skim milk vs. 2 cups milk & added approx. 1/2 cup more cheese (sharp cheddar)-other than that i followed the recipe exactly; it turned out rich, smooth, creamy, and flavorful, in a word-Yum!

I thought this one was going to be a hit, but it just came out greasy and bland for me. Next time I will use low-fat cheese to cut down on the grease.

Oh my, these are YUMMY! My husband and I polished off almost an entire pan. I considered omitting the onions because I really don't like cooked onions. But I wanted the flavor. I'm glad  I left them in, they cooked up so soft I couldn't even tell they were in there, but I could taste them. Did I mention these were delicious? Thank you!

I think I made my cheese sauce a little thick, because it just sat on top of the potatoes. Actually, this turned out to be a pretty good thing, because my boyfriend can be pretty picky - and not like things that are completely coated in cheese sauce (I know. I don't get it either!). He did love this, though. I took the suggestion of another reviewer and microwaved my potato slices first. Next time I might consider sauteing the onion slices a bit first or microwaving them with the potatoes - they were still a little crisp when everything else was done. It came out of the oven in about 30 minutes. Awesome with the pot roast I made!

I made this pretty much as written--I did dice the onions, though, and used Gruyere instead of Cheddar. Awesome! Served this with a pork roast. The next morning I combined the leftover potatoes with some cooked breakfast sausage for a quick breakfast. So good I may next add some scrambled eggs and serve as a holiday brunch item! I will forever "step away from the box". Thanks!

As published, I did not really care for these potatoes.  The only change I made was to mince the onions rather than slice them.  I used medium cheddar.  Short and sweet, the potatoes were bland.  They need a lot more salt, less onion, more cheese and probably sharp cheddar for more flavor.

Followed this 'as is,' which I believe is essential to rate it for what it offers. No changes to the ingredients, I only want to add some tips: a) Halve, slice and saute the onions in a bit of oil or butter before making the cheese sauce. Cooking them adds more flavor to the potatoes; slicing them avoids big cheesy rings. b) If you find the potatoes bland, you can up the Cheddar to 2 cups and add a pressed clove of garlic. c) Know your oven. My potatoes were done after 1 hour; cooking them 1.5 hours would have made them mushy. And, as reviewer Emily says, I use the sauce between layers but that's a personal preference. Wonderful recipe, which I will be using in my regular rotation.

EXCELLANT! I chose this because it had good ratings and seemed easy with few ingredients. The dish came out wonderful. I did make changes, I used low fat milk and we didnt need another dish with so much cheese so I put 1/2 cup of feta cheese, also I added sautee onions and mushrooms to the middle and the top. Next time I will try it with the Cheddar, I was happy I didnt need to add the richness of regular milk. I will make this again.

What makes all the difference with this recipe is the CHEESE!  I have made it with several brands of cheddar cheese and it sometimes tasted a bit bland.  I have found the best one to be Tillamook Vintage White Extra Sharp Cheddar. Like other reviewers, I also sauted the onions in the butter first and added garlic salt.  I also removed the foil about 15 minutes before the potatoes were ready to let the top get nice and crispy. This is a crowd-pleasing dish.  Thanks for posting it!

DH cooked tonight and made these alongside steamed asparagus, and his own special recipe for meatloaf.  All was delicious, including this.  He forgot to add the butter, but we didn't miss it, and something else he did that was interesting and tasted good, too, that I wouldn't have thought to do in a million years and that was to add some fresh lemon juice to the au gratin mixture.  Thanks for the recipe, Cathy!

The BEST au gratin potatoes ever!  The only thing I found wrong about this recipe is that you need a 2-qt dish to fit it all-unless you halve the recipe.  The first time I made this I mixed the cheese in at the same time as the milk- this caused it to separate and come out kind of chunky.  But everytime I've made it since, I've followed the recipe exactly and it has come out AWESOME!

This is a good recipe--I used sharp cheddar to give it some more flavor. I also used fresh cracked black pepper, and it was pretty good. I would also suggest anyone making this boil their potatoes before slicing them to cut down on the baking time--it takes way too long otherwise!

I followed the recipe exactly and served it for Easter Dinner to rave reviews- and no leftovers!  I prepared it the day before, and baked for one hour and refrigerated. I let it sit out the next morning to come back toward room temperature, and then put in the oven at 350 for one hour to reheat.I think I could have cut the reheat time to about 40 min.  Great recipe, and a good make ahead.  Thanks for sharing!

These are fabulous! This is definitely not the dish to make if you can't really cook and are uncomfortable with your seasoning ability or aren't willing to spring for good-quality cheese, as I think some of the earlier reviews demonstrate. I sauteed finely minced onion with a little garlic and mixed it with yellow potatoes for the base, and then I added a little rosemary to the sauce and applied it in layers. Sooo scrummy!

Super tasty! I used garlic butter rather than regular butter and two types of cheese (old cheddar and gouda) and it was fantastic. I simply wonder how incorporating mushrooms would better this dish...

Loved it. My husband and children loved it as well. Will try sauteeing onions next time, but was fine as stated. The only thing I would definately do different is pouring some cheese sauce over the 1st layer, after the onions. The cheese did not go all the way through the potatoes.

I followed the advice of others and added more potatoes, uncovered for about 20 minutes until the top got crusty.  I'm still stuffed and need to make room for dessert!  Great great great recipe...I'm already looking forward to eating the leftovers tomorrow!

This was awesome!!  I sprinkled garlic powder and salt on every layer of potatoes, sauteed the onions with garlic before adding them, and added more cheese than was called for.  I sprinkled cheese on top, cooked, then uncovered and broiled for the last 5-10 minutes to brown a bit on top.  Yummy!

I've been looking for a good Au Gratin Potato recipe and I found it!  I made it and loved it but next time I would like to leave out the onions and add some parmesan cheese to the cheese sauce for just a little more flavor. I also added some garlic powder and onion salt.

I made this for x-mas.  Followed recommendations of many others.  Sliced about 4 lbs. of potatoes (dbl. what the recipe called for) and doubled the sauce - there was PLENTY.  Used sharp cheddar (a must).  Added the chopped onion and garlic powder.  The dish was a hit!

The first time i made this i left out the onion so my teenager would eat it. Everyone liked it. The next time i added the onion and garlic salt and parmeson cheese on the top. I lowered the heat to 350 and removed cover last 15 min. and it came out great. I even put them under broiler so top would be brown. Will be making again

Great recipe, the only suggestion I would make would be to use a larger casserole dish than called for in the recipe.  My casserole dish overflowed slightly.

I've made this a few times now, and I have to say it is pretty bland as written.  I decided to make it again the other night and it came out FANTASTIC!  We had company over, and everyone, including our toddler, loved it!  BUT...I made a TON of changes.  However, I will follow my changes from hereon out whenever I make these! Here's what I did if you want to give it a whirl: Sauteed chopped onion and a little minced garlic in 1 TBS or so of butter for a few minutes until the onion began to soften.  Added the remaining butter, melted it, then continued step 3 buy adding the flour and so on.  For the cheese, I used a blend of SHARP cheddar and a shredded parmesan/romano/asiago blend, adding more cheese than called for.  I layered a little sauce in the bottom of the dish, then a layer of potato slices (I like to make them thinner than 1/4", and boil them for 5minutes first, then I don't have to bake them as long), spread another layer of cheese, and so on.  I also made a panko/melted butter topping and added that at the last few minutes of baking, uncovered.  YUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!

This is excellent. I also make a double portion of this recipe and cook it in a 9x13 pan because it just flies off the table so quick. I did find that cooking it at a lower temperature (325-350) without aluminum foil will bring it to perfection better than putting it in at high heat. I know it is done when the cheese is browning about 2-2.5 hours. I have made this recipe many times both ways. I have a DCS oven though so the temperature intense.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was very good resulting in the above rating.  My better half really liked it a lot, but we decided to increase the sauce by 1/2 as suggested by other viewers. I live at 5500 feet.  I have not been making this type of recipe since the potatoes always tasted a little bony.  I got around this by microwaving my potatoes for 3 minutes and let them cool before slicing.  I use my mandolin to slice my precooked potatoes as I find that there is more even cooking.  It was very good.  The second time I made this, I added some chopped green chili and some cut up ham.  This made an awesome dinner for the two of us.  So yummy!!  I plan on trying it in the crockpot as others have suggested.  One last thing...I make my cheese sauce in the microwave.  I melt the butter in the container for 1 minute, add the flour and seasonings, whisking the butter and flour together.  I then microwave that for one minute.  Lastly I add the milk and slowly whisk that in.  I then microwave this on high at 2 minute intervals for about six minutes until nice and thick.  I then add the cheese and stir to incorporate.  If the cheese is a little slow to melt, I will stick it back into the microwave for about 20 seconds.  I do this in a large 4 cup microwave safe measuring cup which allows me to pour it onto the sliced potatoes.  If you want to cook your onions, add them to the melted butter and microwave for about two minutes before adding the milk.

This recipe was easy. I simply just diced up the onions instead of the ring suggestion. Turned out great. Had that home cooked depth I was looking for with the side dish.

Very yummy.  Made a couple of changes.  In the saucepan, sauteed 5 finely chopped cloves of garlic before adding the rest of the ingredients.  Used 1 1/2 cups milk and 1/2 cup sour cream.  Sprinkled grated cheese over before baking.  The garlic and sour cream added a little extra flavor.

I scaled the recipe for 6 potatoes since I wanted to use them up. I used my mandolin to slice the potatoes thinly and evenly which reduced the baking time to 60 minutes. I sauteed a finely diced onion in the butter, omitted salt since I am on a low sodium diet and cheese is salty, used a mixture of swiss, cheddar and mozzarella cheeses that I wanted to use up. Seasoned with onion and garlic powder, parsley flakes and my homemade salt free cajun seasoning, really tasty.

Really simple, really good. I parboiled the potatoes and reduced the baking time to 45 min. and they turned out great. I also added some garlic powder and cracked peppercorns to the sauce. Don't skimp on the onions... they make all the difference!

Tons of great flavor! Rich and fabulously decadent!! I used half aged white cheddar and half Swiss.  Also added fresh chopped rosemary and diced green onions to the butter (instead of the rings of onion).  Love this recipe and will be making again!

Love this recipe!!! Use the cheese sauce for many other things...Mac and cheese, over broccoli....only thing I do differently is I use a good sharp cheddar and make sure my measuring cup is crammed full not just loosely packed. No complaints from anyone definitly a keeper!

I made this as directed except took the other users' advice and sliced the potatoes very thinly, and also diced the onions first.  It cooked perfectly in 1 hour so I had to keep it warm for half an hour and then broiled the top to give it a nice golden brown colour.  Making it again in a couple of days for Easter.

Love this recipe. Thought I would share my small changes.  I use American cheese in the sauce. Just tear up the slices and drop in, stirring constantly. About 6 slices. I chop the onions, and add bacon bits to the layers (I do 3 layers) also used a little garlic powder in sauce. Topped with the shredded cheddar n uncovered last 20 minutes. Delicious !

Terrific.  Have tried a bunch of these...  best Rue of them all so far.  Onions add a good flavor - I sautéed.  Last time I made it, my oldest son ate the whole thing in one go.  Luckily had enough for a second batch...  love that... and so will you like this recipe.

It was very good, but a little greasy.  Maybe that was just the kind of cheese I used, don't know.  I'll try it again with maybe a mix of cheeses, some low fat cheese in addition to the regular.

My family loves these, the only thing I do different is peel potatoes, slice them, boil them to tenderness, do not over cook or you will have mashed potatoes, then I bake in oven for approx. 20 min. on 400 degrees instead of baking for an hour an 1/2.

We were reduced to grunting.  As soon as it was out of the oven and was close to being cool enough to eat, my husband I stood there taking bites and grunting to each other.  I could not compose as hearty a recommendation.

This was a great recipe, I made it spur of the moment one night and added panko crumbs to the top for an extra crunch!  I also hate onions so I used onion powder and added a dash a cayanne pepper.

For added flavor, I used half chicken stock and half milk for the liquid.  I think this gives an added depth of flavor along with a few favorite seasonings, such as a smoky paprika and garlic powder.  Taste the sauce before you pour it over the potatoes and see if it needs something.

Very easy recipe that tastes great. About 15 minutes before it was finished, I removed the tin foil so the top got brown, and then added a little more shredded cheese just before I took it out. Nobody believed I made it from scratch! :-)

Very very  good, but I had a few issues.  I too chopped up the onions and saute'd them first because we don't like a strong onion flavor.  I add 1/2 more cheese sauce like others suggested and was glad I did or else it would have been dry.  I put into a large dish, more like 2 1/2 quarts and was glad I did...I can't imagine it fitting into anything else.  Most importantly, it took MUCH longer to cook than stated.  Next time I will microwave the potatoes first to get them cooking a bit, before I put in the oven.  They were delicious and I will def make again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great basic recipe... I doubled sauce portion, and only used 4 BIG russet potatoes, also used equal portions 1/2 and 1/2 and milk, sauteed onions, garlic in butter, added mustard powder and paprika. Salt and pepper on raw potatoes that I soaked in water first.  Baked for time listed, but took cover off to brown top.  yum yum... I guess this makes this MY recipe...but like I said....great starter.

Made this last night I made 1 ½ of the cheese sauce 4 med size potatoes and put it all in a greased 8x8 inch pan. There was a cup of the sauce left which I put with the left over’s. I also put some chives in the cheese sauce but did not use the onions. I don’t see the need to layer with the potatoes and cheese sauce as it does find its way between the potatoes fine but I’m sure it could not hurt. It was yummy (4 adults) but I think it could still be kicked up a notch but for kids I’m sure they will lick their plates clean, thanks for posting this for us.

This was so good! I baked it in a 2 1/2 quart casserole dish instead and that was the perfect size dish for this recipe. I also salted and peppered each layer of the potatoes and onions to make sure the whole casserole was well seasoned. I took the foil for the last 30 minutes or so to make the top brown nicely. Thanks for the great recipe!

I make this recipe atleast 4 times a month.  My family loves it, and often requests it.  I don't change anything and it turns out great every time.  My husband, who rarely eats leftovers, says it tastes even better the next day.

This was very good!  To speed things up a bit, I cut up the potatoes and put them in a flat dish with enough water to cover the potatoes, before putting them in the microwave with for five to six minutes.  After they were half way done, I proceeded with the recipe as written.

We really enjoyed these potatoes.  The sauce was really creamy.  The only issue I had was that a 1 quart casserole dish was definitely a tight squeeze.  Next time I will go  a bit larger and put some of the sauce on top of the onions before adding the last layer of potatoes.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for a get together with my husband's family. They all love potatoes and this was a huge hit! The only change I would recommend is to dice the onions instead of slicing them. Otherwise a really great recipe.

WOW really good so much better than any au gratin from a box.... I agree with other reviewers that the cheese sauce would be great over macaroni... because it is certainly fantastic over these potatoes...

So delicious! This recipe exceeded my expectations. I left out the onions and instead, I minced a large clove of garlic and added it to the butter as it melted. Rather than simply cheddar for the cheese sauce, I used a half cup each of cheddar, mozzarella, and parmesan cheeses. I baked it for 2 hours at 350 F and was sure to place a foil-lined baking sheet under it so that the cheesy goodness didn't spill in the oven. This is a winner!

These potatoes were incredible! I haven't made au gratin potatoes before, but have eaten my fair share ;-) these were possibly the best I've ever had! So yummy! I finely diced the onion since we prefer it that way, and added a bit of extra cheese, and I threw in some asiago with the mozzarella. Yum! I made them in a slow cooker since my my oven was being used for something else (I slightly par-boiled the potatoes first, then cooked in crock pot for about 2 1/2 hours on high)  and they turned out perfectly! This one's a keeper, it will be a new holiday side-dish staple in our house! :-)

Obviously more effort than the boxed version, but well worth the extra time spent.  My family raved.  The flavor is different from the boxed version.  This is not a copy-cat recipe.  After having this, I feel like the potatoes in the boxed version are not real.  This is real food and it is super yummy!  Make the effort.  You won't be disappointed!  
*note-I did follow some of the other reviewers tips, like chopping the onion and layering the sauce and adding a little garlic.

Simply Perfect!  Like other reviewers I would recommend and extra 1/2 cup of cheese.  (I prefer x-sharp cheddar.)  Also, microwave the potato slices for 8 minutes prior to baking as another had recommended.  Allows the mixture to be creamier w/ less cooking time.  Lastly, remove cover to brown top, as someone else advised.  Combined all 3 recommendations and it was Simply PERFECT!

I tried this recipe last night, and I have to say I was very disappointed. After finding this recipe and how well it was rated, I thought would be a hit. Unfortunately, it just tasted like onions. Nothing else, just bland, with over whelming onion flavor. No one ate the serving they took. I gave this 2 stars because the cheese sauce was easy to make and tasted "okay." If I ever make this again I will not be using a whole onion, thats for sure, and it needs a lot of doctoring up in the flavor department.

Excellent, I kinda sliced my onions thick, but I really. Think the onions make this, I followed recipe exactly, except incovered for the last 20 minutes to put cheesey crust on top. Very good thanks for recipe

Comfort food all the way! I followed the recipe exactly and it was creamy and delicious. I did have to bake it about 15 minutes longer. I agree with other reviewers that it was a touch bland, so next time I will add a little dry mustard, nutmeg, and cayenne to the sauce (these are standard additions to my mac n cheese sauce). I might also cut the onions into smaller pieces, and I will definitely use a bigger pan - the size stated was just barely big enough. I might try a 9 x 13 pan, and uncover during the last 15 minutes to get the top browned a little. These are minor tweaks though and this recipe is a great place to start.

These were good, but bland. I added 1 Tbsp onion powder instead of fresh onion. Stuck to my pan really bad, too.

Excellent!  I doubled the recipe and layered the potatoes, onions and cheese rather than just pouring the cheese on top.  When I first took it out of the oven I was worried it was too liquidy, but after sitting a few minutes, the excess liquid absorbed into the potatoes for the perfect consistency.

This recipe was delicious! It has a very classic taste and my husband and I loved it with our Christmas dinner this year! My oven was being used all day so I just layered this all in my crock pot and cooked it on high for one hour and on low for about three--so easy! Will definitely make again! Thanks!

Great recipe...recommend a little thyme and lots of pepper.  Also, this recipe is great for your leftover ham after the holidays.  Just slice ham thinly and add between the layers of potatoes.  This makes a full-meal recipe and the ham is delicious when included with the potatoes and cheese.

I doubled the recipe and its a side dish for Xmas. I chopped the Onion and used Half & Half. I used White Sharp Vermont Cheddar cheese and added more for extra creaminess. I poured some of the sauce between the layers and added chopped fresh parsley. The last 10 minutes I removed the Aluminum foil and let the top brown slightly. Everyone loved it! Thanks for the keeper recipe..

These potatoes were absolutely as fantastic as everyone said. I used recommendations from Emily91183, so I increased the cheese sauce by 50%, and then added an additional 3/4 cup shredded cheese to the mix (for a total of 3 cups of cheese). I diced the onion (probably used about 1/2 cup), instead of slicing it into rings. I also microwaved the potatoes beforehand for about 8 minutes, this helped reduce the cooking time (great recommendation). Instead of seasoning the potatoes with salt/pepper, I used Seasoned Salt. Excellent recipe, everyone raved.

A nice basic recipe.  I added a bit extra cheese and I like to pair all that cheese with nutmeg, black pepper, and a hint of cayenne pepper.  I also microwaved my potatoes in advance and sauteed my onion to reduce the cooking time.  Works well in a crockpot as well.  Thanks for this ticket to Yummy-Ville=:)

I followed the recipe exactly and this dish was good.  However, next time I'll follow the suggestions of some other reviewers.  I'll mince the onions instead of slicing.  I'll mix them with the potatoes, instead of layering. I'll double the sauce and add more cheese to it.  And I'll layer the sauce with the potatoes and onions intead of just pouring it on top.  Again, this was good as the recipe is.  But, for me, these small changes will make it great!

It's good, the flavor is good it's simple enough and its cheap to make,  I will make it again but with two slight adjustments, I will add 1/4 cup  cream cheese to the cheese sauce, and I will shred the potatoes instead of slicing them.

Did not cook in the time allowed, cheese sauce separated and globby even though I cooked exactly the way the recipe called for!! Overall it just made a mess. (Fortunately I had the foresight to put a pan underneath my au gratin dish...) Really unimpressed with this one. NO idea why this has so many rave reviews.

This is  a great, easy recipe.  I cut it in half to try it out.  I scrubbed the potatoes, chopped the onions, and added two minced garlic cloves to the melted butter & flour.  Used 3 T butter, 2 T flour, 1/4 tea salt, 1 cup milk, but used 1 3/4 cup Cheddar cheese.   I buttered the 8x8 pan before putting the potatoes in , next time I will also use a no-stick spray. Covered them with foil, they were done at 45 minutes.  The garlic really makes a wonderful difference!

Absolutely the best ever!  Recipe made 6-8 serv instead of 4.  Next time I'll use three avg potatoes.  Worried that I didn't have enough sauce - but there was plenty.  Took the advice of another and added about 1/4c sour cream.  Removed foil and browned up nicely last 10min. Sprinkled bacon on top before serving.  Yum!

This was just ok.  We skipped the onions and was the only change made.  If I make again I will also leave out the flour as we could definitely "feel" it in the sauce texture.  Would up the cheese by 1 cup to compensate.

YUM. The sauce was great. I hand-sliced the potatoes very thin (wish I had my mandolin to make it faster), did not bother to peel the potatoes (I like the texture, vitamins and flavor of the peel), and finely chopped the onion instead of slicing into rings. I didn't think I would like the consistency of big rings of onion. I didn't salt the sauce, I thought the cheddar was salty enough plus I'd be seasoning the potatoes. I wish I would have salted the sauce as the recipe suggests. I didn't measure, but I think I used a bit more cheddar than the recipe suggests. Could use even a bit more I think, probably depends on how sharp/good your cheddar is. Also, since the sauce is thick I added some to the first layer instead of adding all of it on top. I planned to uncover during the last half hour of baking and top with more cheddar, parmesan and bread crumbs; I forgot so it didn't look all that appetizing. Still very delicious and perfectly baked after an hour and a half in a 9x13 inch baking dish.  I seasoned with Lawry's Seasoned Salt and lots of black pepper. That worked very well, but next time I want to try Worcestershire in the sauce!!  Served with baked ham, steamed broccoli and french bread. Perfect! This will be a staple in my house.

Awesome! The only changes I made were adding half a cup of mozzarella cheese to the sauce mixture, a little garlic salt over the potatoes and I used chopped yellow onion, sautéed before adding to the dish. Also, I used a 9x13 pan to make more, smaller, servings... it fared well at a pot luck with 10 or so people, everyone got to try it without having to add a notch to their belt buckle. Next time I am going to make it with low-fat/non-fat ingredients.     Nom!

I did mine in the slow cooker as others, but once they were done cooking all the butter/grease rose to the top and was really unappealing looking.  I scooped it off using a spoon as best I could.  It still tasted good and I got a lot of compliments, but I wish it wouldn't have gotten so greasy.

These were the stuff!  Only recommendation I would give is to sprinkle salt and pepper in between each layer - just not on the very top.  I think this will relieve some of the taste 'issue' others have encountered.  Will keep around... thanks for sharing!

These au gratin potatoes are excellent. I made them on Thanksgiving and everyone loved them so much, I'm making them again for Christmas. I made some modifications based on the other reviews. I sauted my minced onions and added some minced garlic. I made 1.5 times the cheese sauce and added my onions and garlic to it to test the flavor. Then, I mixed the sliced potatoes in a big bowl with the cheese sauce to fully integrate all of the flavors. I'll do a few things differently this time. First, I won't saute the onions and garlic b/c after they cook for 90 minutes, they are too soft and you can't taste them as much. I'm going to try adding buttered panko crumbs on the top to add a little crunch. I've tried many au gratin recipes and they are tons of work and the dish isn't that good. This recipe is awesome and the end result makes the peeling and chopping totally worth it. :)

We thought these were just awesome! Like everyone else, I did make a couple of changes.  I minced and sauteed the onions in the butter for the sauce, added 2 tbsp onion powder and 1 tbsp garlic powder, 1 tsp mustard powder. I added 1 cup more milk as I like my potatoes saucy. Little cheese and parm/bread crumbs on top and browned for the last 25. ABSOLUTELY DEVINE.  Also, I put a pan under the dish to prevent spillage. ;)

These are delicious! I use the slicer attachment on my food processor to slice the potatoes thinly and then layer half the potatoes, pour half the cheese, then layer the rest of the potatoes and then pour the rest of the cheese. I do put a little more cheese in the sauce because we like it cheesy. My only issue with these have been that the cheese burns around the edges - I reduced the cooking temp to 350 and cooked for 1.5 hours and they were perfect. Removed foil for last 20 minutes or so to get a nice golden brown crust on top. YUM!

My family LOVED these!  Normally, I like to try the recipes as written, however I was running short on time, so I parboiled my sliced potaoes to reduce the oven time.  I also salt/peppered between layers or potatoes and threw in a decent amount of garlic powder and a few red pepper flakes.  I also recommend using a mix of cheese as regular cheddar can be somewhat oily.  I used about 3/4c of colby jack and 2c cheddar (I had increased serving size to 8).  Also, I stirred the sauce down into the layers to make sure the potatoes on the bottom were covered.  Overall, very easy and tasty.  Thanks for this recipe - it's a keeper for me!

These are really good Au Gratin potatoes.  I made them for the first time a few months ago following the recipe exactly.  I made one change thought tonight- I made them on the stove-top.  I wasn't sure how it would turn out, but it turned out great!  All I did was, in a large pan saute the onion with some minced garlic, add the thinly sliced potatoes and fry them for a few minutes at medium heat.  In a small bowl I melted the butter in the microwave and then added the flour.  I stirred that into the pan and slowly added the milk.  Once it was all heated I added the cheese, stirred it and let simmer for about 20 minutes.  I scaled the recipe down to half because it's only my husband and I.  It was just a quick way to do the potatoes.

Not a bad recipe, excellent base. I felt they were a little blah, I needed to add more salt and fresh cracked pepper to them to give them flavor. I would make these again.

Thank God somebody knows the difference between "Au Gratin" and "Scalloped"! These are absolutely delicious. Followed suggestion of nuking taters first. Fast, easy and a regular addition to our menu.  Thanks for sharing!

Wonderful potatoes!  Used 1 cup skim milk, 1 cup fat free half and half, and upped the (sharp) cheddar cheese to 2 cups (it's what I had in the 'fridge).  Oh, and I did mince the onion, just because I'm not used to onion rings in au gratin potatoes.  Perfect comfort food.  I had to cover mine for the last 40 minutes of cooking because it was getting too brown on top, and it cooked perfectly!  YUM!

Disappointing . . . I was really in the mood for potatoes in a creamy cheese sauce.  What I got was an oily, clumpy sauce.  Will not repeat.

This is the ultimate creamy, yummy comfort food! I omitted the onions, and added garlic powder in between the layers and on top. Very good... my fiance couldn't get enough of this! I can see how others would think this was bland, but I think it's more that it's just simple. Simple and good! Thanks!

These were the most delicious au gratin potatoes we've ever tasted.  Only change I made was to use chopped onion instead of rings.  Didn't change a thing other than that.  Served this with spicy fried chicken and baked asparagus...yum!

I followed the recipe and was a little disappointed. The sauce was very rich but lacked flavor. I would would make it again cut back on the sauce and add white pepper or a touch of cayenne.

just okay. very good ratio of ingredients but way too bland. Needs some garlic or onion powder, and more salt (you really can't put in on the potatoes "to taste" when you can't taste it at that time (who tastes raw potatoes?).

This came out great!  My roux became lumpy when I added the room temperature milk, so I just strained the milk out and used cornstarch to thicken.  It worked great.  I also used evaporated milk, and some 2%.  I precooked the potatoes and chopped and sauted the onions before assembling the dish.  I also used fresh rosemary in the milk cheese sauce.  It gave a great flavor.  I was able to cook the dish at 350 for 45 min and then uncovered for 10 min since I had precooked the potatoes and onions.  It was a hit!!

These potatoes were very good... easy and came out rich and creamy. I made a few variations by adding some crumbled bacon and some chives and sprinkled grated parmesan cheese on top and uncovered for the last 20-25 minutes to make a crust on top. My husband and I enjoyed this recipe and I will make it again for sure!

My husband LOVED them!  Read the reviews first and and made the following substitutions- used bacon grease instead of butter and sauteed the onion and garlic in that, then added milk and medium cheddar.  Topped with breadcrumbs and took cover off last twenty minutes per other reviews.  The bacon gave it a nice smoky flavor and this is definately a keeper

This recipe is easy and quick to put together and tastes much better than anything that you could get out of a box.  However, it makes a LOT of sauce.  So much so that its almost flowing out of the pan.  I would make the cheese sauce, but use about 3/4 on the potatos and save the rest for broccoli or something.  I also diced the onion and layer with the potatos.  Instead of dumping the sauce over the potatos that are already in the pan, I suggest making a layer of potato and onion and  then pour some sauce on and repeat until the pan is full.  I found that I had to try to force the sauce down into the pan when I just dumped it over.

Only caution would be to make sure the potatoes are sliced thin so they cook through.  Was worried it might be bland but it tasted great.

We thought these were pretty good.  Could have used less milk/flour and more cheese.  Definatly needed more salt.  I added a dash of cayenne, b/c we do that with everything.  Very good and golden brown crisp around edges (best part)!  Just dont make the mistake i made.  I thought "Hmmm this sauce was so good, i'll cook macaroni and use it for baked M&C"  Dont do it.  Makes a curdled like sauce, gets very very dry and tasteless against all the pasta.  Even with more milk and cheese.  Just dont do it..... :)

I planned on making this low fat, so in all honesty I didn't expect it to be that good. It turned out well, to my surprise! I used skim milk and a little fat free half and half, margarine, and 2% cheddar-jack cheese. Instead of layering the onions in the mix, I diced & sauteed them with the butter. I also added minced garlic to the butter, and a dash of paprika to the cheese sauce. I took the aluminum foil off the last 10-15 minutes to get some color/crispiness. Great side dish.

Hard to go wrong with this.  Have made it muliple times.  I experiment with different add-in flavors (garlic and basil are our favorites).  I usually double the recipe so we'll have leftovers later in the week.  [It's almost better the next day...]

Excellent.  My husband even gives them a rave review.  I used American cheese and replaced the onions with onion powder, just because that's what my family likes.  I'll be making these again and again.  Thanks!

These were very easy to make.  If you follow the recipe by adding the milk at intervals and stirring until thickened, they won't be lumpy or runny.  I used a sharper cheddar for taste and put an extra 1/2 cup of cheese sprinkled on top to add extra flavor & crispness.  You can use some parmesan on top as well for flavor. I will make these again for sure!

This is a very tasty but heavy dish.  Good to couple it with perhaps grilled fish or chicken and some steamed veggies to lighten up the meal.  To reduce cooking time, slice the potatoes, place in casserole dish with some water, and microwave for about 6 minutes.  Then you really only need to bake long enough to meld the flavors - about 30 minutes.

Nice change from the usual mashed taters I make w/ roasted pork loin.  I sliced the potatoes a bit thinner (probably why 1.5 hrs was enough time) and did not cover them at all.  It came out beautifully brown, and the onions were nice and soft.  My bf doesn't like long thin slices of onion, so I may mince those next time just to appease him.  This one is a keeper (both him and the recipe)!  Also, I added more seasoning into the cheese sauce mixture (seasoned salt, pepper, parsley flakes, cayenne, thyme), and I used a 1.5 qt ceramic dish.

Wow! I followed this recipe as written - ok, with 2 exceptions, I layered potatoes, onion and cheese sauce 3 times and after baking I sprinkled with more cheddar cheese.  Yummy - served with steak - Rave reviews, no leftovers. Definately *****

DELICIOUS!  I too used a combination of sharp and medium cheddar equaling 2 cups, sauted some minced garlic in the melted butter, and I substituted a bit of white wine (about 1/3 cup) for some of the milk.  My mandolin made slicing the potatoes and onion so easy.  Also added some fresh cracked black pepper.  It was superb, and I see so many variables that could be added, diced ham or turkey, some broccoli, etc.

I think I did something wrong. I know for the next time to use a stronger cheese and let the sauce cook for a few minutes longer in the saucepan. Other than that I could get where the recipe was going and should have gone, so, I will try again next time. Hope this helps someone!

Was very good but needed a little more milk as it was kind of dry.  I used mild cheddar cheese and the next time I will use sharp cheddar for a little more flavor.

These potatoes turned out great! They take awhile to cook, but they make the house smell so good while they are cooking, and my husband loved them! The ingredients were simple and all things I had in my kitchen. I only added 1/2 an onion, (my husband doesn't like them) and added some garlic salt on the top. They turned out wonderful!

What a tasty side dish!! I would use more salt and definitely add some pepper, as it didn't have the spice without it.  Very easy to make and lets you cook your main dish while the potatoes are baking!  Wonderful recipe!

I thought these turned out horrible!  The cheese seperated, the onions were not cooked enough.  I won't be making this again. ***Update*** 3/3/13 - I gave this another try using my mandolin to make the slices very even.  These turned out creamy, delicious but they do need more salt.  Other than that, I'll make this again.

This is AWESOME!!  I substituted the cheddar cheese with Montery Jack.  I also uncovered it for the last 15 minutes and it got a nice, brown, crunchy, delicious rim around the edge.  My fiance and I were fighting over it!!  :-)

Terrific recipe -- the best we ever had!   For those who found the sauce too runny, I suggest that you are not cooking the roux long enough to allow it to thicken.  I doubled the recipe, and used 2/3 sharp cheddar and 1/3 asiago cheese, and it was fabulous!  It's worth the work, and I'll probably be making it for every family dinner from now until forever!

This is my go to recipe as it's so consistently delicious. I've made it for Easter and for other occasions  and it never fails to get rave reviews. I agree with others that it's best with the onions chopped up rather than the rings. If I make this for Easter, the next day I  I chop up the left over ham a bit and gently mix it in with leftover potatoes, warm it up,  you have a yummy breakfast casserole. Topped with some hot sauce or salsa and served with tortillas and eggs, you have  perfection!

This recipe is wonderful! My pappa (who was a chef for 40 years) told me to use just a touch of beef base to the sauce. It cuts the milk taste and adds a unique wonderful flavor! I have made this recipe for 20+ years, but added my pappa's touch - and there is never any left for the day after! I even double the recipe!

This was a family favorite from the first time I made it!  Although I followed the directions exactly the first time, I had to tweak it  for subsequent preparations.  Instead of cheddar, I use at least 8 oz. of Monterey Jack with jalapenos, substitute half and half for the milk in the cream/cheese sauce and uncover for the last 20 minutes.  It takes the recipe to a much better place.

Lovely classic recipe. I use a garlic/herb salt instead of regular salt and sprinkle with parsley to add color and interest to this recipe. I finish by broiling for that yummy browning cheese look.

It's delicious. I tripled the recipe, sliced about 12 potatoes thin with my food processor, and chopped 2 onions with the mixing blade, and chopped a pound of white cheddar and 1/4 pound of Swiss. I softened the onions and 3 garlic cloves in butter and alternated layers of potato and onion with some cheese sauce halfway through. Then I poured the rest of the cheese sauce on top, which filled a 3 quart lasagne dish, with a small amount of everything left in an 8 inch dish with chopped ham for later.

I've been making this recipe for many years!  My mother-in-law gave it to me as it was one of my husband's favorites.  I do chop the onions as well and I add one teaspoon of ground mustard but otherwise it's the same. I also started mixing the potatoes in the sauce before putting them in the baking dish as I wanted them to all be well coated with the cheese sauce.  I didn't have my recipe with me at our second home so looked here for one and am so thankful I did!  I love 
allrecipes.com!!!

I really love this recipe!  The cheese sauce was the perfect consistency.  I  don't like the texture of whole onions so I diced the onion and sautéed it in butter with some minced garlic, I added that to the cheese sauce and it flavored it up nicely!  For my topping, I crushed some sour cream and onion potato chips and removed the foil the last 10 minutes of baking so it could brown.  Thank you for sharing this recipe, we really enjoyed it!

With the exception of using 2 cups of cheddar instead of a cup in a half,I followed the recipe. If was very tasty and simple. I like no fuss recipes like this one, so while I understand all the variations I would not go overboard since is had enough flavor for me.  I would make the following changes to bring it to a five star.  I did not like the rings of onions but I liked the flavor so instead of rings I would dice the onions and distribute throughout. Maybe add a dash of cayenne pepper.  Simple and delicious, thanks to the person that contributed this recipe and as always I am a huge fan of Allrecipes, it's like having a cooking coach.

Just made this recipe and it has ZERO flavor. Cheddar cheese is not the right kind to use, as it does not hold any flavor. I think gruyere cheese or Asiago might be a better choice. I also think cream or half-and-half might be better than milk because I thought it tasted more like flour than cream.

Oh my!! Thank you for the recipe. Delicious. I only changed the cut to chopped onions and increased the sauce (may have been too much), plus I used an extra sharp cheddar (and extra of that, too). Family raved about these. They used rolls to sop up the left over cheese sauce. I will definitely make again.

Excellent cheese sauce. I use it for chili cheese hot dogs, nachoes and Mac and cheese. Minor adjustments for the nachoes. Best cheese sauce I have tasted. Oh I also use it for French fries and au gratin potatoes.

Very good recipe, but this is THE BOMB if you use Cabot Buffalo Cheddar! It has that wonderful flavor but is not too spicy. Sprinkle the top with paprika, to sex it up.  Also, if the potatoes are nice fresh/new ones I leave the skin on so as not to deprive us of the nutrients and the fiber.

I love this recipe, it is super easy to make, I add whatever kind of cheese I have on hand and it is always fantastic. I always saute the onions with garlic and I slice my potatoes and boil them in a pot of  water with salt until about halfway done, drain and then layer in the dish.  This always cuts my cooking time and eliminates any uncooked potatoes.  I also use this same recipe with the butter, flour, milk and cheese to make lots of other dishes..ex. using mozzarella and Parmesan, layered over Italian Sausage and Pasta, makes a mean pizza casserole!!!  Thanks for the recipe!!!!

I made this exactly as directed, using a pre-made mixture of cheddar and Monterey Jack cheese. Quick and easy to make, and it reheats nicely. Just add a little milk or cream to the leftovers, cover and bake at 350° for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally to blend the milk in with the cheese.

I made this recipe. It was great and easy to make. I didn't have cheddar cheese so I used colby jack and it was fine. Definitely a keeper.

I wanted to love this recipe as potatoes and cheese are two of my all time favorite foods. I found it to be a lot of work for the bland and fairly oily result.  I made this recipe exactly as stated.  Used the food processor for nice thin, even potato slices.  It took 2 hours to cook and the oil from the cheese separated and was on top.  After stirring the oil mixed back in.  I generally make everything from scratch but in this instance I think the Cheesy Potatoes recipe that uses frozen hash brown and cream of chicken soup outrank this recipe by 1000%.

I have made this recipe for the last 3 years to go with our Christmas Ham Dinner. I have used many other recipes in the past but this is THE RECIPE! The only change is that I make 12 servings instead of 4 servings. There are 8 of us and it is all gone.

Very yummy. I diced the onions instead of slicing them, as other reviewers suggested. Also, I made about 1.5X the sauce.  I suggest using a high quality, aged cheddar. That makes it extra cheesy and indulgent. I uncovered it for about the last 20 minutes of cooking so that it would get all bubbly and golden brown on top. Fantastic!

I made this with the ingredients exactly as written but I did change the technique a bit. I minced the onions very fine instead of using rings as called for. I also put some of the cheese mixture on when half the potatoes were in the pan and then added the rest after all potatoes were in the casserole dish. It was easy and excellent. No surprises at all. My husband loved it and I will make it again soon.

A nice change from regular, everyday potatoes.  I bet adding chopped, cooked bacon would really make this dish a "10".

This was great!  I chopped the onions instead of slicing them according to reviews.  Everyone loved it!  Personally, I think I would like it without the onions (even though I normally love them) but everyone else said they liked them in it.  I will definitely be making this again!

This was sooo good. My only suggestion is to use a good cheddar cheese. I used a mix of Yukon Gold & Red potatoes and Tillamook Sharp Cheddar cheese.  
I will definitely be doing this again.

Really great recipe! I followed this as written and really liked it a lot. I used a very wide dish this time and the cheese mixture didn't cover it. I think I would recommend using a small casserole dish and probably doubling the cheese mixture. You can't have enough cheese!

I make this recipe often, only changing a couple of things.  I much prefer diced onion to the large rings.  I also use SHARP cheddar cheese instead of regular cheddar.  I do not like sharp cheddar cheese plain but once cooked into the sauce it doesn't have a sharp flavor.  The regular cheddar cheese makes a sort of  bland tasting dish...still good, but sort of bland.  The sharp cheddar is a definite improvement!  This is also excellent with left over diced ham in it.

Wonderful! I took someone else's advice and sauteed my onions in a little butter and garlic. I prefer sweet onions, and it turned out delicious. I will definitely be making this again. And it's so easy, made with things you always have in the house, which is my favorite kind of recipe.

Added 1 small jar of sliced pimientos (4oz jar with juice)when adding  onions...also 1/2 teaspoon paprika before adding cheese.

These potatoes were beyond wonderful.  I used Yukon gold potatoes, did not peel them.  I sautéed onion ( chopped instead of rings ) in a small amt of butter and oil, one tablespoon each.  The dish was amazing

So good and creamy!!  I added minced garlic to the cheese sauce and pepper.  I prepared this in layers: potato, onions, s&p, cheese sauce, potato, s&p and cheese sauce.  In the last 10 minutes I took off the foil and turned the broiler on and added some grated cheese in the last 3 min or so.  Can't wait to make it again!

Really good! I served it with pork tenderloin. The only modification I made was using small red potatoes instead of russet - mainly b/c russets can be mealy.

Excellent dish heres what I do different,
 I use a round glass cooking dish, butter the entire this I make a layer than sprinkle salt and pepper on each layer with a few sprinkles of butter, I fry some bacon and place crumbles through out it with chives and continue layers, I also sparingly put a little sprinkled cheese through out the layers than after the onions I whisk 2 eggs and pour over it than pour the cheese on top and let it settle. It is the most amazing dish ever!! when I pull out of oven I sprinkle the top with some chives YUM!

Made this for Christmas dinner.  Not a hit.  Doubled the recipe, and as suggested by other reviewers, I used sharp cheddar cheese and diced the onion between layers.  Even added a bit of garlic powder and cayenne pepper to kick it up a notch.  What I pulled out of the oven was a BLAND, runny, slightly curdled casserole with undercooked potatoes.  It was edible, but only barely.  I think my guests ate a helping to be polite.  I MAY be able to salvage the leftovers (and there are lots) by adding more cheese on top and running it under the broiler (also may add more garlic and cayenne).  It's in desperate need of flavor!

Yummy, cheesy, goodness. A huge hit at our Easter brunch. I used a lot of cooking spray as suggested. And I didnt have the half-and-half so I used half whipping cream and half milk.  A total success!

I am surprised by the reviews because I just did not find this dish flavorful at all! I used some spices and quite a bit of salt along with sharp cheddar and it was flavorless. Quite pasty and unappealing actually. I wish I could find what cheeses would be best for a dish like this, but sharp cheddar is pretty, well....sharp and had me thinking it would work. Epic failure on this one.

This was so good.  I don't even really like potatoes and we loved it.

I would recommend baking it in a deeper dish because it bubbled over and made a huge mess in the oven.

This is a good easy recipe, I followed it as directed, however I butter the dish, and layered it with onions first, then the potatoes, use salt and white pepper, paprika and red pepper flakes, then i layered it again till i had three layers ending with potatoes. when it came to the cheese I used cheddar, but also added a blend I use when i make my quesadillas... the blend is manchego, provalone, pepper jack, mozzarella,cheddar and I season it with cumin, dash of paprika, chili powder.. this is my blend that i keep in the freezer..  It gives a unique taste rather than just cheddar cheese......  it wont disappoint!

Loved this! Used 1/2 an onion b/c we aren't big on onion flavor and used original flavored almond milk.  Fabulous even the next day for left overs.

This recipe is awesome, although the ingredient measures are ambiguous.  I used four russet potatoes, but they were apparently twice the size of the ones the author called for.  I figured this out after slicing the potatoes and seeing how they filled my 2 quart casserole to the brim (the recipe calls for a 1 quart casserole dish).  And so I doubled the rest of the recipe and also cut up a ham steak and tossed that in as well.  It was utterly deicious.

This took an hour to prep (with disrtactions) - keep in mind it takes 90 minutes in the oven so this needs to be started 2 1/2 hours prior to dinner. Put a ham layer in the middle instead of an onion layer. Forgot to salt and pepper the potatoes. Thanks!

This was very good! My boyfriend loved this dish when served alongside my baked salmon with ginger and brown sugar glaze and fresh nectarine slices.

I modified as follows: Remove the sliced onions. Substitute 1 part shredded mozzarella and 1 part shredded sharp parmesan for the cheddar cheese. Increase the cheese to 2 cups. Top with french fried onions and sprinkled cheese. Uncover when ten minutes remain to allow top to crisp in oven.

Too bland for me so I will not make this again. It wasn't horrible, just ehhhh.  I like onions but I did not like them in this recipe.  Cheese sauce should be layered in with the potato slices.

I LOVED these!  I have had a bad experience with au gratin potatoes back when the husband used to make the one's from the box (yuck) and I would eat them to be nice.  Finally got around to making these, and proved to him homemade is SO much better than that boxed junk.  I added a little extra cheese on top...delicious!

Made these the other night. It was a great potato dish. I tripled the recipe and added extra cheese. The sauce thickened up nicely. I will definitely make these again.

Definitely will make again, this is a great recipe!  I also omitted the onions, and sprinkled some breadcrumbs, parmesan cheese and a dash of onion powder on the top.  Next time I will probably remove the foil for the last few minutes to brown the top a bit.  I would suggest while making the sauce to keep heat lower, using a medium flame on my stove almost scorched the butter and cooked the milk too quickly.  A low flame worked better, and the sauce turned out great.  I made this with Famous Butter Chicken
by HAULBUR, delicious combo.

Really, really good and easy, didn't use quite as much onion but that is only according to your taste, because these are truly terrific.  I had this with glazed baked ham, green beans & mushrooms and deviled eggs.  Yum!!!

I loved this recipe. It was actually pretty easy to make. I had trouble getting the sauce to thicken up, so I kept adding more flour until it got a little thick. I also used 2 cups of shredded cheese. I put in a 9x13 pan and baked for an hour and they turned out great!

Outstanding! I read several of the reviews and noticed that most of them had "tweaked" the recipe here and there. I decided to make the recipe exactly how it's listed out and the potatoes were magnificent. I sliced the onions into rings, but sliced them on the thin side and they cooked away, so it doesn't matter how you cut them...they are strictly for flavor, not texture. The next time I make them, I think I will offer toppings, such as chopped bacon, chives, etc., but it's great without it as well!

One thing I have learned about making this as well as other au grating potatoes is that I can save the step of making the sauce by adding the flour to the grated cheese and layer it with the potatoes.  Then I pour the milk......or sometimes I use chicken broth and really like it that way too....over the potatoes.  It all cooks up and is just creamy and wonderful.  I also like to mix up the cheeses with muenster being a favorite at our house.

I make a similar recipe to this but I use heavy cream instead of the milk and I add pressed garlic with each layer. Cheese ruins the impurity of the dish. This recipe comes from Le Bec-fin of Philadelphia. I am a very experienced cook!

These are the easiest, most delish, potatoes.  Whenever I have cheese to use up I make these.  I will mix cheddar and pepperjack, or add a handful of romano, a dash or two of hot sauce.  Always comes out great!

Took the other reviewers suggestion and chopped the onion then sautéed with two large cloves garlic. Used 2 cups sharp cheddar (to finish off a pre-grated bag). Uncovered and topped with bacon crumbles, crushed buttery round crackers, green onions and a sprinkle of paprika for the last 20 min. Used a 9x13 glass pan. Seemed like too much for a 9x9. Fabulous!!

these are not what i thought they would be. They came out dry and bland with almost no flavor. This recipe has good reviews so maybe it was just a mistake made by me. I would not make these again unless i adjusted a lot of things. Thanks for submitting!

Yum! The onion gives it such a nice flavor. It was pretty safe to tweak the recipe too. I doubled it and sliced the rings into smaller pieces. LOVED IT!

These were creamy and delicious.  I used half-n-half instead of milk because it's what I had in the fridge, otherwise followed recipe.  Excellent flavor and texture!

I made this recipe GLUTEN FREE by substituting 3 tablespoons of cornstarch instead of the flour.  Great recipe!

This was ok, but not enough for a 4 star.  Needed a little more of something.  I couldn't decide on this or scalloped potatoes.  I should've went with scalloped.

This recipe is probably the worse recipe I have found on this site. For one thing, the "sauce" wouldn't thicken... it took about 20 minutes to get thick enough. Then not only that, when it was done there was no sauce even left, and it was burned! I had to throw it out. What a waste of money! The cooking time was obviously too long/hot. I suggest adding and making waaay more sauce than this, and possibly using heavy cream with the milk. Don't add onions, but add garlic to butter and saute and add to the potatoes. Sprinkle some cheese on the top or breadcrumbs and brown it. That's what I'm gonna do next time...

I made this to go with honeybaked ham for Easter dinner.  Wow.  Everyone LOVED these potatoes!  Almost everyone had seconds.  My brother even pointed to the serving dish and said, "best ever, that's REALLY good!" high praise from him!  One caveat though, it calls for a 1 quart dish, I couldn't fit all the ingredients into a 1 quart so used my oval dutch oven.  This is definitely a 2 quart dish recipe!  I didn't change a thing in the recipe either. I think if one used very small russet potatoes it might have fit in the 1 qt. dish.  But there was no mention of size and I went with medium sized russets (frankly my store didn't have small russets, only medium and huge!).  Someone said they had to layer the cheese but as I said I followed the recipe exactly and poured the cheese sauce over the layers of potatoes and onions and the sauce found its tasty way into all the nooks and crannies!   Thank you for a terrific potatoes au gratin recipe!

Very good, when cooking a large amount be prepared for using alot of extra time for baking, like double the time.

This is a really tasty side dish. I always leave out the onion rings - it's better without. I'm definitely going to try this recipe with different cheeses.

The bf, who is very picky, loved these. Instead of doing reg onion I chopped up 1/2 a red onion, then added 3 bell pepper/onion frozen veggie mix. Was delish but very much a comfort food and not heavily spiced. The one thing I'd really recommend to anyone who makes this is use a lot more salt than you think you'll need... The potatoes just suck it right up.

I doubled the sauce, added more cheese, and diced the onions. I would recommend uncovering the dish for the last 20 minutes of baking time, checking occasionally to prevent scorching. A good comfort food side dish.

Made this for dinner tonight.  I sliced my potatoes thinner than 1/4 inch by using my cheese slicer on them.  Cooked it in a 13x9 inch pan on 420 for 35 minutes until it was golden bronw on top.  After reading some of the other reviews I left out the onions too but replaced them with 1/2 teaspoon of tapatio hot sauce which gave it a nice kick.  I greased the pan with Olive Oil spray because it's healthier.  Nothing stuck and the dish was amazing.

I used this recipe last weekend and it turned out great!   I was so happy to find this recipe, especially since it did not call for a canned soup loaded with MSG, or a processed cheese, and it came out very creamy and rich.  We did add extra cheese, but I do for most recipes...a personal taste : ) Thanks!

EXCELLENT!  I did make my onions a little smaller.  The onions between the potatoes allowed the cheese sauce to get all through out the potatoes.  YUM!  I used red potatoes as that is what I had.  I am not a big russet potato person.  I would also use Golds in this recipe.  I will make this again and again and again!!!

I used 2 large red potatoes, 1 large yukon gold and 1 large russet potato, and Sharp White Cheddar (yum!).  The cooking instructions were easy to follow- however my roux never really thickened until I added the cheese...  I chopped up my onions pretty small and did everything in 2 layers. I think if I ever make this again- I will add more cheese to the sauce and probably double the sauce as well.... these just didn't turn out as moist and cheesy as I was hoping.  Overall they tasted good though! Thanks!

I made these potatoes to go along with our spiral honey ham and they were very good!  The only change I made was to dice the onions and carmelize them before adding them to the potatoes. Oh, and I also doubled the cheese sauce, which turned out to be too much, which wasnt really a problem because it was SO DELICIOUS.  We ended up spooning the cheese sauce onto the cauliflower as well.  Great recipe that I will be using again and again!

This is so good! I minced the onions and sauteed them with some garlic before I mixed them with the potatoes and also used an additional cup of cheese. I think I will try using two different cheeses next time. My whole family gobbled them up!

Very delicious! I did make a few changes to the recipe. I used an italian blend of cheeses instead of cheddar and I also minced the onions instead of slicing as someone else suggested.

Pretty good, although I did make the following changes.  First, I diced the onion.  Then, I added 1 clove minced garlic and 1/2 t. hot sauce to the cheese sauce.  I also added the onion to the cheese sauce.  I made the cheese sauce from 1/2 sharp cheddar and 1/2 monterey jack.  I alternated the potato and cheese sauce layers until finishing the top with the sauce.  I think that next time I will increase the garlic to 2 cloves and add more hot sauce (1 t.). I used the given amount of butter and cheeses...did not get a greasy dish like some other reviews.

This recipe is amazing.  I love my mom's au gratin potatoes- but this recipe takes the cake!  I sliced my yellow gold potatoes and sliced them a little thinner to reduce baking time... added extra salt and pepper (based on reviews)... on the top I added extra cheese and bread crumbs.  Delicious and plenty of flavor!

I just made a "test" batch of these to experiment with before my meal tomorrow.  Here are some changes I made and some things I will do different.  I microwaved the potatoes for about 6 minutes before slicing.I layered the potatoes and sauce adding salt, pepper, and a little garlic powder to each layer of potatoes (best to salt them while they are warm). I also minced the onions and added a few over each layer of potatoes and the remainder I put in the cheese sauce. I added more cheese and more milk to the sauce along with a salt to give it more taste.  I cooked as directed, but removed foil near the end and added buttered cracker crumbs and cooked under broiler until slightly browned.  After removing from oven, I crumbled bacon on the top.  Next time, I will double the sauce and maybe add less flour to the cheese sauce as I felt it ended up too thick (that's why I added more milk). I'll also pre-cook the potatoes a little longer as the longer they cook in the sauce the dryer it dish gets.  Update:  Made these with double the sauce... Don't do it!!  The potatoes came out a greasy mess.  Had to to throw them out.

Simple and delicious. The only things I'd add would be 1) a few dashes of hot sauce to the cheese sauce; and 2) Remove the foil after an hour so the top browns nicely. But those are just personal preference nitpicky thingies. This is great just the way it is.

This recipe is great. Slightly time consuming but really delicious. I followed the recipe for the most part although; I used red potatoes (what I had on hand) and shredded extra cheese that I broiled on top of the potatoes for the last 8 minutes of cooking. It gave them a nice crispy, golden brown topping. Definitely super-yummy comfort food!

This dish tastes  way better the next day.  The first day was just so-so, but the next day was really delicious.  I will make this dish a day early the next time.

these were amazing! i never thought it'd be that easy to make!  i minced the onions and layered it as some reviewers suggested. i did cut down on the cooking time buy slicing the potatoes thinner & i microwaved it so it becomes half cooked. do rmbr to cover w/ aluminum foil to keep the heat w/n WARNING: it gets quite greesy but hey it's comfort food w/ cheeese can't escape it! for the last few minutes i did broil the top so it browns on the side & crispy on top! i will make this recipe on every special occasion possible! or when i crave comfort food =)

The sauce BEFORE baking was to die for, I just wanted to use it as a fondue on bread, heck I was just eating it off a spoon.  After baking though, it separated a little bit and didn't coat all of the potatoes.  I was expecting more from this recipe, but I will try it again.

Wow, these spuds are awesome! I added some spices to the potatoes before topping with the sauce (salt,pepper,paprika and garlic powder). I added extra cheese to the top during the last 20 mins of baking but don't recommend doing that, it was much better without the extra cheese. Will be making this a lot more!

1 1/2 hours wasn't nearly a long enough bake time for me.  I used a 8x8 or 9x9 square pan and used a slicer for my potatos so they were much thinner then a quarter of an inch.  Maybe I should have used a larger pan.  I ended up baking an additional 45 minutes uncovered and it turned out very good although it may have been a little too brown on the bottom for some tastes.  I served topped with green onions.

These potatoes seemed to only be good just after they were coming out of the oven. But, prep was easy as there was no pre-cooking of the onions or potatoes. Layering the potatoes and thinly sliced onion rings also made the potato dish seem a little more elegant.  The ingredients are ones I also typically have on hand. But, for some reason they tasted really oniony and a little bland the next day. So, if I make again, I will make enough for just that evening.

My husband requested Au Gratin Potatoes for his birthday dinner last night.  My daughter found this recipe and it was a huge hit!  We left out the onions, but next time we'll saute them with the butter.  We made 1-1/2 recipe of the sauce and put it in the microwave for 15 minutes then convention baked it for 30.  So easy, and delicious, thanks CathyM.

Great recipe! I tripled it and it was a hit with the whole family. I only made a few simple changes.  I added salt and pepper to the potatoes as I layered them instead of at the end as the recipe says.  I also took the advice of another reviewer and precooked the onion a little, and I took the foil off toward to the of baking to let the dish brown.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made this tonight, I doubled the sauce!  Fabulous recipe.  Double the sauce for sure. I liked the flavor, but next time I might add some tabasco sauce to liven it up.  I also removed the foil 30 before the end to make the top brown.  Thank You!

Good recipe, I made it as written but without onions -  I have onion allergy. I added a pinch of cayenne pepper flakes and 1/4 tsp paprika to the sauce instead, and used a shredded tex mex cheese blend. The spice made up for it I think. I also seasoned the sauce with salt and pepper to taste instead of the potatoes to have more control over it, because some reviewers said it was bland.  I gave 4 stars because I thought the cheese sauce was too thick. I added about 3/4 cup of milk and it was good. I took the foil off for the last 30 minutes and added some extra cheese for a nice brown crust. You also definitely NEED to use a 2 qt casserole, there's no way this will fit in 1 qt. To reviewers who had lumpy sauce: add milk to the roux slowly, whisking like mad as you pour. Then make sure you heat the sauce on the stove until it bubbles and thickens.

These were DELISH, very rich and fattening but delish!! lol I did make a few changes, but I always do when cooking... I used half cream and half milk for the sauce with an old white Cheddar (you can use less cheese if it has more flavour), layered the potatoes with crumbled bacon (makes these potatoes over the top kind of delicious!!) finely diced onions and pepper. I also added some of the sauce to half the layered potatoes and think that buttering the dish was unnecessary. Served them with honey and apricot glazed ham for Easter, and now can't wait for another special occasion to make them again!

I tried this recipe and it turned out pretty nice. I think however, you should add that it takes the mix about 15-20 minutes to thicken properly and it's not going to be super thick. Also, I agree with a previous review that this sauce on Macaroni & cheese would be perfect, many said the potatoes needed more seasoning, even though I added moe than the recipe called for & the cheese was over-powering but overall it was great! Next time will make the sauce with some pasta for Mac & Cheese!!!

Very Good!  Definitely creamy in my opinion.  I cooked these for dinner, for me and my hubby after I had been having a craving for them for a long time.  The way that I had intended to fix them were totally different than this recipe and I know the result wouldn't have matched up.  My husband even went back for seconds.  I found myself nibbling off of them everytime I went in the kitchen.  To the person that said they were bland, (this is not meant to seem rude but) you probably under seasoned the potatoes during the preperation process.  Mine didn't turn out to be bland at all, especially since there were onions.  I suggest you give it another try!  Good Luck.  Von

This was a good and basic side dish as is. Is great if you are showcasing another part of your meal (steaks, chicken, etc). Didn't find it bland at all. Just cheesy and creamy. However, I love that if I wanted it to be the star of the show I wouldn't have to alter much. Just change the cheeses used (bleu, goat, white cheddar, gouda) add in more garlic, maybe some rosemary.. the possibilities are there.

delicious - I added parmesan cheese as well to the sauce mixture and made in the crockpot.  I made the sauce on the stove and layered the potatoes and onions in the crockpot and cooked on high for 4 hours...It needed the entire 4 hours in the crockpot

FINALLY.  I think I've made about 2 frillion scalloped, au gratin, cheesy potato recipes and have never been very happy.  This one did it.  I used Tillamook extra sharp cheddar and about 1/2 cup of Asiago thrown in.  I followed other reviewers' advice and added cheese sauce to each layer.  The trick for me was to keep tasting for salt while I was melting the cheese.  Knowing that the potatoes would 'dull' the dish, I let the cheese get a little salty.  Loved this.  I also uncovered it for the last half hour because I love that smoky, crispy cheese layer on top.

Like an idiot, I read the reviews after I had already put these in the oven.  I got worried about consistency and cook time.  Reviewers' cook times varied quite a bit.  My oven cooked the potoatoes perfectly at 1.5 hours.  I just took the foil off after 45 minutes and lowered the temperature to 375 for the last half of cook time.  When I put this in the oven, it looked like it might come out very runny.  I used skim milk and couldn't get my sauce to thicken on the stovetop.  In spite of this, they turned out perfect!  I think removing the foil let some of the moisture escape.  I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe (except the cook time).  The way I cooked them allowed the potatoes on top to brown slightly and get a little crispy, just the way we like them.  The flavor was great!  I added parsley at the end as a garnish, and these potatoes looked like a restaurant-quality side dish.  I will definitely make these for company in the future! My husband and I were impressed.  Thanks!

These were delicious!!! I brought these to Thanksgiving dinner at the in-laws. My mother in-law is a stellar cook and I was so excited to serve these. They were a hit. My only modification was adding a layer of cheese to the first layer like some others did... Delicious!

I made this recipe as is and it was very good!  My husband and I both really liked it.  My 3 year old daughter, who does not like potatoes no matter what way they are prepared, ate these up!  She loves cheese, so that should say something about the taste.  I think I would use a little more cheese next time and maybe combine a couple, but as is, this recipe is great!

This was a great recipe, but I can never follow any recipe exactly without making my own additions.  I chopped the onions and sauteed them in the butter with some fresh pressed garlic...garlic makes everything better!  Then I made it the rest of the way like it says in the recipe.  Everyone who ate them loved them!!

Just perfect!  I was in a rush and took the advice of earlier reviewer and partially cooked the potato slices in the microwave first.  I used sharp cheddar and was very pleased with the results. Will keep this recipe for future use.

This recipe is great. It is so easy and delicious. I can whip it up about ten minutes and then bake it whenever. Some people don't seem to like the onions so I think I'll start leaving those out.

Awesome! I sliced the potatoes in a "scallop" style and used red potatoes. I also added more flour to the mixture (about a teaspoon more) and also added salt and pepper to the mix. Also adding salt and paper between the layers is important. Lastly, the last 10 minutes in the oven I took the foil off and sprinkled some plain bread crumbs on top to give it a nice crust on top. It was so yummy, my husband who usually doesn't like this style of potatoes raved about it all night.

I decided to make try this recipe based on the great reviews. Like many cooks I tweak most recipes to make them my own. I added 1/2 cup more cheese as another reviewer suggested. I omitted the onions and added 1tbsp of garlic powder and 3 tbsp of fresh chopped chives to the cheese sauce. I also used unpeeled red potatoes. DELICIOUS! My husband and I loved it. Definitely butter the casserole dish, it makes for easier clean up. Enjoy!

I gave this 4 stars because it was super easy and quick to put together.  However, I would recommend a larger crock.  1 quart was way too small.  The only thing about this recipe is it is a little bland.  It's really all creamy cheese.  I'm trying to think of a good additive to give it more punch.

These were very bland and the cheese didn't get onto half the potatoes. I won't make these again.

I loved this recipe.  Thanks for sharing! A couple thibgs to address previous comments.  First, cut the onion in half and slice thin to half moons, they cook nicely.  Second, add a touch of garlic powder and italian seasoning to the milk/cheese - by the way this is a bechemel - I always add some fresh gtaed nutmeg before the cheese.  Go with two cups of cheese, I used cheddar and four cheese mexican (this helps offset the oily-ness of cheddar) and make sure you salt and pepper each layer.  Last, uncover for the last 20 minutes, then remove and grate romano over top, put back in oven for about 15 more minutes..  This brings the time up but gives nice color and a nice extra touch of cheese..  I'm going to post a pic of how mine came out as a way to thank the poster for a great recipe!!  In case you wonder, I nver give a five unless the recipe is totally orgasmic!

I made these for my boyfriend and he love them.  The changes I made are as follows:

* Layered half of the potatoes, added half of the cheese mixture, layered the rest of the potatoes and then the rest of the cheese mix.

* chopped up the onions into large pieces and sauted them in butter; then made the sauce as the recipe calls.

* Added an extra 1/2 cup of cheese to the sauce per the advice of other members.

As a non-potato lover, I tried this recipe because my husband was craving potatoes au gratin.  I also sauteed the onions and added garlic, but also added dill, LOTS of black pepper, cayenne and a pinch of nutmeg to the "bechamel" sauce.  I used extra old white cheddar and baked for 75 mins.  During the last fifteen, I uncovered and grated fresh parmesan on top, then broiled it for 2-3 minutes at the end to bring out the nuttiness of the parmesan cheese.  We loved them and I think I may have found a new sidedish to bring to family gatherings!

these were popular at Easter dinner.  I cubed them instead of slicing them, and cooked them in the crockpot on high for about 6 hours. They were good, but very watery - maybe should have taken the lid off for the last 30 minutes or so.

I forgot to butter the pan and they did stick a bit, on well, sometimes the burnt on is the best tasting.  I added Garlic Garlic from Tastefully simple ( I add it to almost everything)  I did add the bread crumbs to the top, but they kinda got buried in all that cheese, but I bet a cracker crust would be good on top of it.  Very good homestyle recipe!!  Update, I doubled the recipe for Easter this year, doubled everything  except used only 3 cups of milk.  YUMMY!!!  Uncovered the last 15 minutes to brown the top.  Excellent.

These are CREAMY! And delicious, I must add. I took PMCKAY1717's advice and sauteed the onions, which I had diced, to tenderize them and mellow their flavor a bit. Next time, I may cut back on the flour, just a bit. Thank you Cathy!

I tried this with zucchini (from my garden, its the season...).  It was good!  Added garlic, orageno & basil.  The last 20 mins of cooking, i took off the foil & covered with mozzerela & parmesean cheese.

This is a nice potato side dish that I used a slow cooker to make so it was "out of the way" while making a large multi-course Easter dinner. Although I went back and forth between "low" and "high" on the slow cooker, I think 4-5 hours on low will work fine.

I went searching for a great recipe for these potatoes, and decided to try this one because of the ratings. I gave 4 stars, because it's not quite what I was looking for. I made this as is, and doubled the recipe, I used white potatoes, and diced up the onions, and using 2 C of 1/2 & 1/2 with 2 C milk. Maybe next time I'll add in some sour cream and green onions as well.

We felt that this dish was missing something and will try adding some more spices next time, but it was definitely excellent.  I followed the recipe except for using fewer onions and the sauce was creamy, firmed up nicely and browned at the edges (best part!).  We will be having this again.

The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 was because the potatoes were cooked and had a great texture. However, the overall concoction was a horrible mess. I made this to go along with our Christmas dinner and needless to say it wasn't embraced at all. I even cut back on the butter as suggested and it still came out far too buttery. The cheese sauce was also too grainy even though I do know how to create a creamy cheese sauce, so I know it wasn't my doing in that aspect. All in all, I will not be making this dish again and hope to find one more suitable.

followed directions exactly, except I don't like onions so i chopped them rather than leaving them as rings, i love cheese so next time i might put a little more in, but these were excellent 
Update: after giving this recipe to friends some have had problems with it spilling in their ovens perhaps put a pan on the rack below the potatoes

These were great.  I added a couple more potatoes and put it in a larger baking dish.  There was still plenty of sauce.  Chives were a tasty addition to the cheese sauce.

Absolutely wonderful!  I served it with a pork tenderloin, and it was such a great complement.  I had only 1 cup of cheese on hand, so that's all I used, but actually, I think it was the perfect amount!  As for "salt and pepper to taste," as I layered the potatoes and onions, I just sprinkled salt and pepper over each layer.  I ended up needing only 3 1/2 potatoes instead of the entire 4, and everything just barely fit into a 3-qt. casserole - not sure how it would have fit in a 1-qt. casserole, as the recipe suggested.  I loved this dish, and will be making it again and again.  Thanks for the recipe!

What can I say but YUM!!!  I made these last night as part of my husband's birthday dinner and they were WONDERFUL!  I took the advice of some of the other reviewer's and while making the sauce I added some minced garlic to the butter stage....and then I use 2 cups 4 cheese classic melts (shredded cheese) and then added a cup of extra sharp cheddar cheese....and while assembling I layered it....putting potatoes (6 yukon gold) and then sliced onion, then sauce and repeated it...twice.....I could have sat and ate the whole dish!!  They smelled awesome cooking!!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was a yummy and easy dish!  I used about 7 potatoes, but mine were pretty small.  I increased the cheese and milk by 1/2 cup.  (Used organic skim milk and Tillamook sharp cheddar.)  After a little over an hour of baking, I checked the potatoes and they were pretty tender.  I'm glad I took them out then, because the bottom was starting to burn.  It didn't actually burn, but formed a really yummy layer of crusty cheese sauce on the bottom of the pan.  Served this with Simple Savory Pork Roast from this site.  Dinner was really good tonight!!

I eliminated the onions completely because neither my bf or I like them and instead added onion powder, minced garlic, and garlic powder to the sauce and potatoes.  I didn't have just Cheddar but used a bag of mixed cheese and it worked well.  My sauce didn't thicken in the pan but it thickened later so it was fine.  I thought it turned out well--not bland like some reviewers stated--maybe because of the garlic.  Mine almost burned  a little on the bottom but did so probably because I used a glass baking dish and the parts that almost burned were actually still pretty good.  Overall, it was fairly easy and we both liked it so I will probably make it again.  **Update:  I make this frequently because bf often buys too many potatoes and he really likes this, so I've gotten the trick of thickening the sauce.  Just wait until it boils, and it will thicken.  Obviously, I have to watch it carefully and stir frequently, but once it boils it thickens beautifully for me.

Maybe my potatoes were too small, but I felt the end result was too saucy for my tastes.  It had good flavor, and the potatoes and onions were tender, but I don't like my au gratin potatoes spreading sauce all over the plate.  I'll probably try again with some modifications.

My husband enjoyed this.  I didn't mind it but felt that something was missing. It was a little on the bland side.

Update, this recipe was better the second day.  I am giving it four stars!

This a is great base recipe!  It adapts well to changes for personal taste.  I don't put in the onions. To the roux I add onion powder, garlic and cayenne pepper.  You can use different types of shredded cheeses as well.  I have tried cheddar, parmesan, jack and smoked gouda all with success.  I also only cook at 350 so the potatoes cook without having the cheeses burn.  If you like that golden look remove the foil the last 15 minutes of baking.

I doubled this recipe as I was feeding 8 people at Easter(one of them being my Mother in Law who is VERY picky!). It turned out excellent and the dish was almost licked clean! The only thing I did differently was to layer the potatos and onions, salt and peppering each layer. The rest of this recipe is great just the way it is and will be the one I use from now on!

Very good!  After reading the previous reviews, I made the following changes:  added crushed garlic cloves (3), minced onion, and made the cheese a mixture of sharp cheddar & mozzarella.  I baked it an hour covered and a half hour uncovered to brown the top.  Delicious!

Made this to go with my Easter ham, and everyone just loved it!!  Of course, had to modify, and so:  sliced potatoes with my mandoline thinly (rather than the 1/4"); when making the cheese sauce, used 1/2 stick butter and 1/4 c flour, 3 cups of 1% milk, and 4 cups of sharp cheddar cheese; used greased 3 qt casserole dish and when layering, topped each layer with extra shredded cheese.  Of course it bubbled over in the oven, had to put foil under it.  Also uncovered after 1-1/2 hrs, and continued baking for extra 30 minutes.  It was truly delicious.  Need to make it again but try and cut some of the calories.  EXCELLENT!!!

This is the best Au Gratin Potato recipe I've tried.  Potatoes are cooked perfectly and the sauce is very creamy and plenty cheesy.

I agree with a lot of the other reviews.  The amounts do need some serious adjusting.  I used all ingredients verbatim besides an extra 1/2 cup cheese and knew by instinct it would not fit into a quart dish.  I used a 2 1/2 quart to be safe but that still wasn't enough!!!  It barely fit and I couldn't remove the cover the last 30 minutes to brown like I wanted because it would have boiled over.  Next time I will only use 3 potatoes or pick something smaller than russets.  One other reviewer said not enough cheese sauce in relation to potatoes and I agree with that as well so cutting to 3 potatoes should benefit there too.  The sauce was a bit bland but I like pure sauces at times and this one was good.  I did layer it instead of putting it all on top.....sauce, potatoes, onions, sauce, potatoes, etc.  Next time I think I will put even more cheese (for nice stringy quality between layers, not more in the sauce) in between layers.  Maybe also some butter.  The first day it was good but I wasn't raving about it.  The next day I reheated in the oven with cheese and butter on top and served with sour cream and it was EXCELLENT.  So a *great* recipe, but may need some tweaking.

I rated this one with 5 stars, not only because the flavor was good, but also because of its ease to put together with ingredients that most of us have on hand.  I thought the sliced onions added a nice touch of variety as well as flavor.

This was the perfect potato recipe for me.  I loved the creamy sauce, the soft, sliced potatoes, and the onions completed the flavor.  I cut the potatoes a little bit more thin so cooking time was just an hour.  Great recipe!

My potatoes had plenty of sauce, so I think doubling the sauce as some have suggested would have made mine soupy. I added garlic powder, cheddar and a bit of cream cheese to the sauce; and I sprinkled a little parmesan on top of the whole thing. I uncovered it for the last part of the baking to get some of the cheese nice and brown. Yum!

Have made this a few times now using all kinds of cheeses. Works well even with gorgonzola. Reheats really well! I add a bit of nutmeg & or cayenne pepper if I'm using a mild cheese. An excellent recipe- so easy, creamy & comfy!

Very good potatoes, with a very subtle flavor of onions. I made this for an intimate dinner with steak and salad and it was definitely a hit. I will make this again. If I make it for just myself and my boyfriend though I will add a couple of cloves of garlic to kick it up a little. Not that it needs it, the flavor is subtle and delicate, but we love garlic!

This recipe was great!  I took the suggestions of adding garlic salt and will probably add some extra sauce next time.  Also, I'll chop the onion instead of slice it, my husband liked everything except for the big pieces of onion.  I'm intimidated by complicated recipes and thought the sauce would be hard to make, but it really is a simple recipe.  I'll definately make this again!

Very good au gratin recipe.  Next time I will decrease temp of oven and bake longer to avoid burnt bottom.  Also, will consider diceing the onions as my family doesnt care for long strings of onions.  Other wise the perfect au gratin recipe

I used to have to go to a restaraunt close to my house to get the best au gratin potatoes in town.  Now I just have to go in my kitchen, Thanks to Cathy Martin!  This recipe was GREAT!  My husband loved it!  I just made them and he wants to know when I will be making them again.  I have given Cathy's recipe to many family members and friends.  If I could give this recipe 10 stars, I would.  But I will have to settle for 5 stars instead.  Absolutly Wonderful.  Thank You Cathy Martin, for sharing such a wonderful recipe with the rest of us.

Very good.  I didn't want to bake it for 1.5 hrs, so I boiled the potatoes in salted water while I made the sauce.  I chopped the onion and cooked it in the butter for  about 3 minutes before adding the rest of ingredients for the sauce.  Do not omit the onion, it gives a lot of flavor to this dish and is an important ingredient.  I added a little garlic to the sauce in addition to 1 chicken bouillon cube.  I baked it for 35 minutes.  Using a little sour cream to the sauce in place of some of the milk also gives the dish a little more zing.

I thought this was a very tasty dish. I followed the directions as written and had no issues. Everything was written out clearly and was easy to follow. I didn't feel that the onions were overpowering, especially if they're sliced thin. The leftovers were pretty tasty the next night. Before you decide to follow someone else's suggestions, follow the recipe as written. You may find you won't need to make any changes. After you've made it a few times, then make it your own by adding or taking things away. I feel it's unfair to the person who shared their recipe to give a 4 or 5 star rating based on a bunch of alterations. I saw on here someone wrote out all the changes they made based on a recipe they use. They should've just posted their own recipe and then we could all fairly critique it. Anyway, thanks for letting me vent. You won't be disappointed if you try these au gratin potatoes :)

I've made this a few times and it goes over really well. What drives me crazy about this recipe is the "4 Russet Potatoes". It's  tough to gauge the potato to sauce ratio without a weight on the potatoes.

Great recipe as written. As others mentioned you may have to cook a bit longer if your potatoes are sliced thicker. We like to add real (pre-cooked) bacon pieces in the last 10 min. We make this quite often as a main dish because no one can stop eating it!

Turned out great! Made a 1/2 batch as there is just the two of us, only added 1/4 t of garlic powder to the sauce and a sprinkle of garlic powder to the top before baking. Was a huge hit and no left overs.

Very yummy recipe. I did make a few changes. Rough chop on the onions and saute in butter with a tad of chopped garlic til lightly browned. Also added a bit of parsley and thyme to cheese mixture. Light coating of panko crumbs on top to add crispness. Used sharp cheddar, Colby/jack, and 4 cheese Mexican blend. Butter butter butter the casserole dish and cover the first hour of baking. Uncover for last 30 mins. This one is a keeper: }

This is my favorite go-to recipe. I’ve been making it at least once per month for almost 2 years now. I only gave it 4 stars bcuz I think the sauce isn’t enough. I double it but it would be good if you just made another half batch of sauce. Either way, even with it as written it’s still 4 stars. I also like mine to be cooked longer but I guess that’s personal preference.

I don't know what I can add to over 3,000 reviews, but these were wonderful, and I will certainly make them again. I halved the recipe because it is just two of us now. I was thinking the onion might be too much, but it really just kind of melted into everything and really added to the flavor. I can't improve on this recipe, but I can see where some people added more cheese, etc. I will stick to the original recipe because it is absolutely delicious as is.

Very good recipe everybody loved it. The only two changes I'll make next time will be more cheese and pour some on top of the first layer with the onions then place the second layer of potatoes and pour the rest on.

Loved this! The only thing I did different was to add cooked diced bacon to the dish. I happened to have bacon that needed to be used up. 
Thanks for this wonderful recipe, I will be using it again and again.

I made this with my Christmas ham dinner and it was delicious! The only thing I changed was using chopped onions instead of sliced. I agree with Gerilynn-will not go back to the box mix again!!!!

Simple and wonderful. I cut potato slices thin--1/8 inch. Instead of onion slices I used dried onion bits and when you want to make an outrageous cheese sauce substitute 1 cup of Beecher's Flag Ship cheese. Make sure to remove foil and slightly brown the top before serving!

I have made scalloped potatoes for years! Have always covered with foi1, to keep it from curdling. This is the first recipe that I have made, shoved it in the oven, w/ foil for 1-1/2 hours & NEVER looked at it till ready to come out of oven! To my SURPRISE, it did not curdle at all! I got several complements on how good it was!

I layer ham on top of the onions. I add a little salt to each potato layer. I add ground mustard, pepper, and a small amount of liquid smoke to the sauce.

Really good!  I used 1¼ cups cheddar, ½ cup swiss and 2 ounces of cream cheese.  Maybe it was because I added the extra cheese, but I needed to add a lot more salt (at the table) to make the flavor come alive.  Will definitely make these again though.

Great dish!  The last time I made this, I used mild cheddar.  If you like cheese, don't do that; the cheese flavor wasn't nearly strong enough.  Also, a 1-quart dish isn't nearly bit enough; the thick cheese sauce tried to run off the sides and mound in the middle because it that was the path of least resistance--the dish was already full to the brim with potatoes and onions.  Also recommend dicing the onion instead of leaving it in rings; it adds a nice sweet flavor, but you don't get much of that flavor melded in with the potatoes if you're taking a massive bite of onion by itself.  All in all, though, one of my favorite ways to eat potatoes!

There is no reason to buy the box stuff ever again!  These came out fabulous.  I chopped the onions instead of leaving them as rings.  I also seasoned with salt and pepper on each layer instead of just the top layer.  I baked it for an extra 1/2 hour since my onions were still a little crunchy.  I think I might sauté the onions a little bit first (as another person suggested) so that they soften  faster in the oven.  I found no need to make extra sauce or to layer the sauce.  There is plenty and by the time you cut into the dish, the cheese sauce is distributed throughout.  This is going to be a new family favorite.  Thank you for the recipe!

My family of 7 and I love anything potatoes, and I jumped at the chance to never cringe at the ever rising price of boxed au gratin, which I have ot buy 3-4 of for just one dinner, and that's just one "side". This recipe knocked the boxed Au Gratin out of the park, I was so pleased hearing all my children's "mmm!"s and "ooh!"s I did follow the advice of other reviewers by mincing my onion, especially because my kids THINK they don't like onion. I added about a half cup more cheese and the roux is similar to mac n cheese sauce so in the similar fashion I slightly oversalted my sauce and it came out so wonderful. This would work with whatever your favorite cheese is provided that it melts well, and for people who say it's "bland" I do see that really depending on the kind of cheese you use. Try sharp tasting cheeses. This has earned a permanent place in my dinner repertoire, heck, I might even make it again tonight.

Review this to make it 75 shy of 3,000 reviews!  I made recipe almost exactly as written.  Chopped the onion and ended up with 3 layers so I baked for 2 hours instead of 1 1/2 hours.  Can't wait to taste it! Update:  They were very, very good except the potatoes really stuck to the pan.  Next time I'll grease the pan better.

These were really really good! I did chop the onion and used extra cheddar. I had red potatoes so I sliced 4 cups. Perfect quantity. Covered in the oven until last 30 minutes. I find microwaving the potatoes for about 8 minutes with some water  cuts the oven time down to about an hour. Drain, then layer.

These were quite good. Following others' reviews, I finely chopped the onion and added a little garlic.  They baked nicely and were a good side to the lobster tails we had for NYE.  {I see how the cheese sauce would be perfect for mac-n-cheese, I will be trying that soon!}

I made this recipe for Christmas Eve dinner to go with ham.  It definitely could have used some spicing up.  I had added a dash of red pepper and topped it with Paprika, but it still didn't have much flavor.  I want to try it again - different cheese perhaps, or maybe different potatoes. I'll have to think on this some more!

It was good but a little greasy on top.  Will try this again with less potato, stay with the 2 quart casserole and allow the milk and cheese sauce to cook a little longer before pouring over the potatoes and more salt and pepper.

These were blah and very soupy.  Took much longer to cook and you must remove the foil at least ½ hour or more for top to brown.  I also chopped the onion and added fresh garlic but still blah.  Like eating mac and cheese but with potatoes.  Just not a mac and cheese kind of gal.

I made these for Christmas dinner to go along with our ham.  Since my family and I like cheesy potatoes I decided to add in a can of Campbell's Cheese soup.  That was the only thing different, as well as like tripling the recipe, that I changed and I think this made all the difference.  I will definitely be making these again and again.  In fact my 12 y/o and I snuck down for more later that evening for a midnight snack!  This will be my go to au gratin potatoes recipe from here on out.

Excellent recipe for Au Gratin potatoes. DH doesn't like onion but I like the flavor it adds so I grate 1/2 a small onion fine and sauté it in the butter till soft and then proceeded with making the sauce as instructed. No large pieces of onion are in the dish which makes him happy but it adds wonderful flavor that makes me happy. I like to use a couple types of cheese such as Cheddar, Havarti, and American. Wonderful recipe. Thanks Cathy for sharing!

I made this twice, the first time following the recipe and the second tweaking it to my liking. I'm rating it based on following the recipe. It was good but a little bit lacking in flavor and I didn't care for the onion rings, because I didn't like the chunky onion pieces and a whole onion was too much onion flavor for me. Also, it wasn't fully cooked after 1.5 hrs. But overall it was tasty and I am making my second batch right now(in the oven as I type). Here is what I did this time and I think it will be perfect. I cut the potatoes thinner so that they will(hopefully) be fully cooked. Only used half of an onion and I diced it small instead of rings. Added about 3/4 cup more cheese, and a diced garlic clove to the cheese mix. And then along with the salt and pepper on top of the potatoes I added a tiny bit of garlic powder and paprika. And I poured about 1/4 of cheese sauce on the bottom layer of potatoes and the rest on the top. Mmmmm I can't wait!

This was good, but I found that it didn't brown on top like I hoped it would.  I put it under the broiler to brown.  Next time I will put a little cheese on top to get that cheesy brown that I like!

We absolutely love this dish. I used peeled red potatoes once and unpeeled yellow fingerlings the second time from my garden. I always empty the partial bags of cheese with a little processed cheese and freshly grated Parmesan when I make my cheese sauces. I plan on making a large dish of it to go with the Christmas ham this year.

I used this recipe and loved it! I made just a few changes. Instead of using all milk, I used half milk, half heavy cream. And, I didn't have cheddar cheese, so I used an Italian cheese blend. All I can say about it is yummy! I can imagine that's good sharp cheddar would be wonderful in this, whereas the Italian blend was a little more subtle. I might try that one time, but the Italian blend was so good, I might just stay with that.

These are delicious!  I did half the recipe, as I didn't need a huge amount.  It was just the right amount for one night!  The only thing I added was bread crumbs mixed with melted butter to the top!!  I am going to make them again tonight for dinner!  Thanx for sharing!!

I have been making this recipe for a couple of years now, and i never get tired of it..absolutely just yummy! It is always a hit and even my picky 12 year old who will only eat potatoes if they're fries loves this dish! i usually make as recipe is indicated, but have substituted whatever cheese I have had on hand at the time...swiss and cheddar make a great pairing!

I run my onions through my chopper, much better than rings. Also while saute'ing add a bit of garlic powder or garlic paste.  I slice my potato's through my Moulinex.  They are paper thin.
I boil my potato's salted, half salt/half celery salt.  The celery adds a very nice flavor. Bake covered, last 5 to 10 miutes uncover for browning. Since boiling, cuts down on bake time, and I bake at 325 for 1hr. I double the recipe, AWESOME leftover dish. 
Since the potato's are so thin, they are very cheesie.
Have eaten these this way for 50 some years.

The only change I make is to saute the onions first and also add a garlic clove (sauteed with onions).   Wonderful potato dish but also make only occasionally because it is so rich.    Never any problems with people complaining!!

I made these today. They were very good! Instead of leaving the onions in rings I just gave them a rough chop. I also minced one clove of garlic and cooked it with the butter and flour before adding the milk. Otherwise I followed the recipe and everyone loved them. Will make again!

This is the best potato recipe I have ever used. It is quite adaptable as well.
For example, my husband is gluten free, so I substituted gf flour. 
I needed to use up some sour cream so I added it to the "add cheese" step.
Adding an additional half cup of super sharp cheese works wonders.
I don't always add onions, but when I do I always dice them because large onions aren't popular around my house.
I cover with foil the first half of baking, then uncover so the taters can brown.
Delicious.

Great recipe. I followed the recipe exactly. As per other reviewers I added a little extra cheese and diced up the onion fine instead of rings. I didn't use half an onion only a slice to give the potatoes a hint of onion which compliments the cheese and potato flavors. I baked the full 90 minutes and like others I did have some burnt potatoes on the bottom. (I used a glass pan so I should have reduced the oven heat as someone else recommended). Great flavor, easy preparation and husband loved it. I will be making these again. Next time I will add some garlic as others have suggested to kick it up a little. Hubby rated this recipe over Ree Drummond (The Pioneer Woman's) au gratin potato recipe which has been my go to recipe.

This recipe was very good, but I did feel it could use a little more spice.I would also put the potatoes in the oven a half hour before putting the cheese mixture on it Even so it was very tasty.
It also seem more like a meal in some ways instead of a side dish, I think it could easily be turned into a one dish meal perhaps by adding some type of meat or fish to it.
My family enjoy it and we decided it was a keeper and that we would have it again.

This was a big hit.  I've done it in the oven and the crockpot - both great results.  Only minced the onions because of finicky onion eaters at home. I will make this again and again!

These were awesome. For the last 5 minutes of baking, I covered I took off the foil, covered the top in a layer of cheddar cheese, and turned the oven to broil. It gave the potatoes a nice crispy crust of cheese on the top.

I liked the recipe but I also added 1/2 cup more of cheddar cheese, 1/2 more milk, 1/4 Parmesan cheese (sprinkled on top with buttered bread crumbs), 2 TSP of sour cream and substituted light almond milk (since I didn't have regular milk.  I also sliced the potatoes thinner so I only cooked them for 1 hour and the last 10 mins without the foil.  For seasoning I diced and sauteed the onion with garlic and also added dill and paprika.  It turned out extra creamy and cheesy.  Yum.

WOW! They were amazing! Decadent! It was like mac and cheese, but with potatoes instead of noodles :) My tweaks were: 1) I used mini yukon golds, left the skin on, used a mandolin to slice evenly.  2) doubled the sauce like other reviewers mentioned. I like it saucy. 3) I added some parmesan, maybe a half cup in addition to the cheddar. 4) cooked covered for an hour, and then removed the foil and it got golden brown the last 30-45 mins.  YUMMMMM!

I never like the boxed au gratin potatoes, but my husband loved them. I figured maybe I just didn't like the boxed ones so I figured I'd try to make them homemade and I'm so glad I did because they were delicious and my husband never wants boxed au gratin potatoes EVER AGAIN! thank you for this great recipe!

I chop the onions and layer potatoes, onions, potatoes and onions. Makes for a better mix. Add a dash of cayenne pepper to the sauce.

These potatoes were a hit for Thanksgiving!  I used extra sharp cheddar & added 1/2 tsp ground mustard because I like how it works with the sharp cheese flavor.  My dish boiled over & made a big mess.  Next I'll just use a deeper dish.  I also followed the recommendation of others to increase the sauce by half.  This is a terrfic recipe and I will definitely make it again!

Made this for Thanksgiving. Not such a good idea. It was just okay. My husband liked the dish but the rest of us (including me) did not like it. The sauce was too cheesy tasting and the consistency was not good, in my opinion. I think this recipe would be better without the cheese and with more spices. Definitely will not make again.

This was a big hit! I just made them for an early Thanksgiving dinner and my family loved them! Just the right amount of cheese and the suggestions to take off the foil for the last 10 minutes made the cheese on top delightfully crisp! Will definitely make again!

We've been looking for a great Au Gratin potato recipe and finally found it!  Per Emily91183, we doubled the cheese sauce and added the cheese sauce in between the layers of cheese...naturally, we also added bacon - turned out fantastic!!!

I've made this twice so far. The first time i picked up mozzarella cheese by mistake but decided to use it anyway. It was so good, nice and creamy! I made it again tonight with cheddar and i've got to say i actually kind of like it better with mozzarella cheese. There was also less fat on top with the mozzarella, I think because it's naturally lower in fat. Good either way though.

WE LOVED IT! Next time I would make less roux (2T each butter & flour, instead of 3 & only 1 1/2 cups of milk) to make it taste a little less like gravy and more like cheese. And take the foil off the last 15 minutes to brown and crispy up the top. Be sure to let it cool off and firm up a little before serving. This will be a regular in our house!

This is so good!  The dairy ingredients turn it into something very creamy and custard-like, but I think the onions are what put it into the 5 star category.  The onions baked this way are so delicious, I think I'd like to try making it with fewer potatoes and more onions.

This recipe was a hit for me and my family. I served it with a baked Ham and am happy to say there were little to no left overs. I did read some of the feedback and precooked the onion before adding to the mixture. All in all it's a great recipe.

This is a simple, easy to make, excellent recipe for the American version of Potatoes Au Gratin - the French version is quite different, and lighter.  I've made this twice now, with some slight tweeks.  First, instead of buttering the casserole, I used spray on vegetable oil and nothing stuck.  I skipped the onions because I was in a hurry and added a little bit of cayenne pepper to the cheese sauce but otherwise followed the recipe, and it was delicious.  The second time,I chopped a large onion small and sautéed it in a tablespoon of butter on medium heat until it was translucent and beginning to caramelized, and then added it to the cheese sauce, which I then added to the potatoes in two batches: I laid down half of the potatoes, poured half of the sauce over, added the rest of the potatoes and topped with the sauce.  It added depth to the flavor, but took more time.  I'd recommend both methods, but I wouldn't put raw onions in to 'stew'.  That's a recipe for an off, harsh taste, and heartburn. I recently began gently pre suateeing the chopped bell pepper and onion for meatloaf because of heartburn and the results were shockingly good.  It had a depth and richness I've never tasted before.  With or without the onion, don't forget the cayenne.  It brightens it considerably - just a shake won't add any noticeable heat but helps you avoid the bland.

I have made this recipe for years. We prefer our onions diced for texture but otherwise no changes. I think the potatoes need quite a bit of salt when you layer them. If you are short on baking time you can give them a quick par-boil in cold water on the stove to give them a start. My family loves these! They go great with the Easter ham, anything barbequed, meatloaf, or any weeknight dinner. They are great to put in the oven before church as well. Use your imagination and your family will not be disappointed!

We also like left-over ham slices added to the layer of potatoes, bakes so tender and adds a little extra flavor to this very nice recipe...

This is the first time I have ever cooked, trying to impress my husband. Thank you for making it easy enough for non cook ppl like me to make it. Taste really good, made me look like a wizz in the kitchen.
Just FYI guys not everything is meant to be spicy - I hate spicy food and am glad there's is food that doesn't have your 'kick'.
I'm super picky with food, this is my type of food simple, filling, taste great. I did leave out the onions basically because I can't stand them.

I have made this recipe several times.  It is delicious and reminds me of my Mom's recipe.  I did not add onions (didn't have any on hand) and they still turned out great.  Definitely should use sharp cheddar for the best flavor.

I used to love these kind of potatoes from the box when I was younger and I lived on my own, but after 10 years of mariage to a woman who does do packadged food, I have longed for some Au Gratin Pottoes. Well I made these (simple recipe) to the T (except I used yellow potatoes) and all I can say is THANK YOU! These where a wonderful addtion to our short ribs dinner and now the whole family wants me to make them again really soon. Needless to say, this will be made again in our household... VERY GOOD. -JOSH

Very good receipe! To make it more into a meal, place several (1/4" to 1/2" thick) slices of ham steak on the bottom of the pan-add your 1st layer of potatoes on top and continue from there, my daughter's favorite!

These potatoes taste great, however - making them twice both times the 350 temperature were too hot. I had a lot of burnt cheese. The first time I did not cover the dish in the oven. There was quite a lot of burnt crust on the top. I simply pulled it off. The second time - I baked in a casserole dish having a top. The edges and bottom were burnt. SO the next time I’ll reduce the temperature to 300 and see how it turns out.

Disappointing results.  The cheese separated into pools of fat on the top of my dish.  I think the listed temp(400) is too high at least in my oven.  I took the potatoes out 20 min. early because of the above problem and they were done.  Also this is too much sauce for amount of potatoes listed.  If I try this again I will lower the oven temp. and increase the number of potatoes.

Omg this is absolutely amazing! I made this with some baked parmesan chicken. Next time, I will omit the onions and possibly add some bacon or chives with it. Overall, I'm so glad I tried this recipe. Thank you for sharing!

Gosh i wanted to love this, it looked awesome when done, great texture but for some reason it was sweet. I thought maybe I used too mild of a cheddar but i went back to check and it was a 4 blend of cheddars, 3 sharps and 1 mild. Didn't alter recipe at all, I didn't use sweet onions and just used regular milk and even added extra cheese and yet the sauce was just too sweet. I was hoping to end my boxed au gratin potato days but perhaps not. I'm surprised at the overwhelming high reviews. Maybe it's our latin tastebuds that like spice/spicey, I think my Mom gaves me salsa in my baby bottle! But anyway, this was just not good and only 1 other person in family could finish their small serving of it, besides me since the guilt of so much left made me eat more than I cared to. Even then there was more than half still left over, and we're a family of 6! Sorry, i guess I'll keep searching later after the fear subsides.

I altered it to be dairy-free with almond milk and Daiya brand cheddar cheese.  This was fantastic and I will be making this again!

I made one change....microwaved the au gratin for 14 minutes then put in the oven for 45.  This is very good and now will be my staple for potato scallop.

my recipe is much like this one. I only use 2 tbsp flour though and 1 1/2 cups milk. after baking in the oven for as long as this recipe needs i find that the sauce really thickens up and using too much flour can ruin it. I increase the cheese to 2 cups. instead of all cheddar though i use 1 cup parmesan and 1 cup cheddar cheese. Then in the last 1/2 hour of baking i put a layer of Parmesan cheese over the top so that there is a nice crispy cheese layer.

I used chopped onions as suggested in another review. I added minced garlic and used skim milk. Make sure you use a whisk. It is the key to a smooth cheese sauce.

I made this for a Christmas party and made everyone my guinea pigs.  It turned out perfect and got a bunch of compliments. I trippled the recipe, except for the butter... only used 3 TBSP, and omited the onions.  I layered the potatoes and cheese sauce adding a little salt and pepper with each layer. I sprinkled the top with some extra cheddar cheese and added some parmesean.  I covered it with alumimum foil (spraying the foil with Pam so cheese doesn't stick to it) and baked it for 1 1/2 hours, then removed the aluminum foil and continued baking it for another 30 minutes.  It had a nice golden color on top and tasted heavenly.

This makes a nice side dish for fish dishes as well. Very good, I only rated it 4 stars because of the onions. I omitted the onion because I don't like onions in my Au gratin potatoes. I halved the amount of potatoes in this recipe but kept the cheese sauce ingredient amounts the same as the full recipe. I used 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese and 1/2 cup of shredded Gruyere cheese. I used about 2/3 of the sauce to make the Au gratin potatoes and saved the remaining sauce for making Chef John's Crispy Mac&Cheese recipe later in the week. I topped the casserole with about 1/4 cup of grated Parmesan cheese before baking it. I also removed the foil from the casserole dish for the last 20 minutes of baking time so to brown the top.

Tip on the potatoes: I use an old Presto Salad Shooter® with the smaller slicing cone for fast and consistent slicing of the potatoes. I also pared only half of the skins off of each potato for fuller flavor and for appearance.

Tip for making the cheese sauce: Turn off the burner that you have the sauce pot over before adding the cheese. Doing so will prevent the cheese from separating and making a gloppy mess.

I made this recipe for a potluck dinner I was attending. Everyone raved about how good they were. And they were quite easy to make too. Foolproof, really. The only downside is the time and effort it takes to peel and thinly slice the potatoes. Other than that, it's a breeze and provides solid and reliable results.

I really liked this recipe. I did change it a little though. I diced the onions as another reviewer suggested. I cooked up tiny slices of bacon sauteed with 4 cloves of garlic and spread that over the top layer. I also changed the cook time from 1.5 hours to just an hour since I sliced the potatoes very thin. I removed the foil 15 minutes before they were ready so that the top could crisp up a bit.

I liked this recipe as-is. I think the blandness may come from too much roux or too bland a cheese. In that case, I would suggest adding a little salt and try a medium or sharp cheddar. Good recipe!

Just made this and it is delicious! I did add some fresh spinach between layers and I added allspice and nutmeg to the cheese sauce. I liked the additions. I read another review that said they didn't like the onions. I disagree. The onions add texture and flavor. Loved it.

I thought this recipe was fantastic!  I didn't have any onions on hand so I used some onion powder in the cheese sauce and it gave it a lovely flavor without overpowering the cheese.  The last 10 minutes of cooking time, I took off the foil and let the oven get the tops of the potatoes a little "toasted" and crispy.  Fantastic side dish!

My kids really love these scalloped potatoes!  I slice them very thin, and add in some garlic powder and white pepper, and use 1% milk, and white Cooper sharp cheese.  It turns out very creamy and cheesy!

I have made this recipe for the 3rd time and each time everybody just loves these.  I doubled the recipe and added 1/2 to 3/4 hour cook time. One time I added chunks of ham, mmmm good eating.  Now the family wants me to make this dish every we have ham.

The potatoes are delicious. I doubled the recipe, used almond milk instead of regular milk (we're a lactose intolerant household...this is a cheese loaded recipe and I wanted to eat SOME of it), and added some gruyere to the cheddar cheese. 

I baked it for an hour the night before, let it cool a bit, put some paper towels over it and covered it, and put it in the fridge. The next day at the party we popped it in the oven for 30 min more and it came out perfect.

This was excellent and very easy! I omitted most of the onion (my DH hates onion) and used fat free cheddar cheese and skim milk to make it somewhat healthier, and this was still delicious.

This was wonderful!  I only made a few small changes.  I used red potatoes and added about 1/2 cup grated ham (which I had on hand from another meal) at the same time I added the cheese.  Everyone had seconds.

This was good :) I made the mistake of taking others advice and tried the crockpot.. I left the potatoes in there for a good 3 hours, and they were still pretty hard. I ended up having to cook them in the oven for about another hour. Follow the directions, stick to the recipe and you will not be disappointed!! The only change I made was to chop my onions instead of slice. I'm glad I didn't listen to one reviewer who recommended leaving the onions out, I feel like that would have made this more on the bland side. I loved all of the delicious onion flavor. I wouldn't recommend using an entire onion for the 4 servings, though. I used only one onion for 12 servings and that was still plenty onion. I sprinkled some french fried onions on half of this, but it was tasty without them. If you don't use any, you wouldn't miss them. Also, YOU DO NOT NEED TO DOUBLE THE SAUCE. This makes PLENTY of sauce! Just my two cents, but I think this recipe is perfectly fine the way it is. Stick to the directions given.

If you are preparing this for a big group, you will want to double it. As written, it won't go very far. I doubled the recipe and had plenty. Feeling a little decadent, I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk, which of course made this delicious dish taste even richer. This was one of our side dishes for Easter 2012! Great stuff, Maynard, or I mean CathyM!

I have never made au gratin potatoes from scratch and looked at about a dozen recipes before deciding on this one.  I'm so glad I did - these were so good!! I followed the recipe exactly except for adding some finely minced garlic to the cheese sauce. This will be my go-to recipe from now on!!  Thank you for sharing such an amazing recipe!

Yummy!  I minced the onions and used half sharp and half extra sharp cheddar...no lack of flavor here!  Next time I will probably bake it at a lower temp since the bottom got a little more browned than I liked.  I also may try adding a buttery crumb topping...

It presently in my oven bubbling all over the bottom. Fortunately, I placed a cookie sheet underneath so the cleanup won't take me 5 hours . Only 1. I am having a houseful of guests in a few hours. I doubled the recipe and followed the instructions to the letter. I placed in a 2.5 Quart casserole and had to much sauce left over. Do not use recipe doubled. I can't  presently comment on the taste .Sure hope it isn't burnt to a crisp as it has 8 minutes to go.

great! I have made this multiple times and every time it turned out great. Don't skimp on the sauce or it won't taste as good.

Really enjoyed it.  Next time I will try sharp cheddar cheese as I had to get the medium one.  (It's Good Friday and the supermarkets are closed so I got whatever they had at the corner store).  Will rate it again then.  I did follow it to the letter.

Good potato recipe. Very easy to make. There is no reason to add any salt as the cheese itself is very salty, makes it a little healtier! Thanks for sharing!

The creaminess and cheesiness are there, but it needs some more flavor depth. Thinking about adding some other seasonings next time.

My boyfriend wasn't too excited to try this because he hates the boxed kind but he quickly changed his mind and got thirds! I added more spices, a little chicken broth, lemon juice, bacon and 2 cups of cheese instead of 1 1/2 it was delicious...I can't wait to make it again.

Recipe is very easy and quick to make.  After following the recipe twice I began to make additions such as adding cooked bacon the sauce mix just before pouring in over the potatoes and topping the potatoes with bread crumbs.  All versions were a huge hit!!

I found that 1 1/2 hrs was not long enough because my thinly sliced potatoes weren't cooked and had to cook longer. Also, I think more cheese is needed because it wasn't "cheesy" enough. This recipe is very similar to my mac & cheese dish which we all enjoy. Maybe the onion overpowers the cheese? I will probably try again and add more cheese.

Made pretty much as outlined but I always use way more cheese and I carmelized the onions first and used local gold/yellow potatoes from my CSA.  Very well received at a large family dinner- everyone loved it, lots of compliments.

My wife belongs to a group called "Project Linus", where they make sewn or crocheted blankets that are donated to needy children.  Every so often, this group has a "pot luck".  I made this recipe for Diana to take to the lunch, and it was a big hit!!!

I doubled the recipe and made one large, and one small casserole (So I would have some :-))

I will be making this one again when the grandkids come to visit!!

I made this the other night and we loved them.  The flavor is simple but delicious.  I used Mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar and followed suggestions to take the foil off early.  Fantastic easy dish!!!

This is the best ever!  We use skim milk so I put 1 1/2 cups of skim and 1/2 cup of half and half as a substitute for 2 cups of milk.  My husband loved it!  AND easy too!!

Creamy, rich, cheesy, PERFECT! I made as written although I did use a 2qt. casserole dish and it fit perfectly. I might chop the onions next time and just add a small amount. Flavor of the onions was great but I wasn't crazy about the large pieces. I'm afraid I'll have to throw out all the leftovers to avoid eating the rest for lunch tomorrow.

Very good, but dish size is incorrect. Next time I will layer finely shredded extra sharp cheddar cheese between the potatoes. I am considering making the onion rings just slices & layered in amongst the potatoe slices & cheese. Then pour the hot cheese sauce on top. Ham bits & sauteed mushrooms may go in as well, just for kicks...I may make a half batch more of the sauce as we like saucy "all rottens" -as we've jokingly called them since childhood whenever we make the dish. Great dish to play with to suit your family's tastes & preferances, or may just be perfect as is, but use a bigger dish. 2 1/2 quart was perfect for my last preparation of this recipe.

Great recipe, I did however make some changes to it just depending on what I had on hand. 

6-8 small-med. red potaotes skin on
thin sliced onion rings
3 cloves garlic diced
1 cup shredded swiss
1 cup shredded old cheddar
1/8 cup parmesan 
1 tsp. Clubhouse Vegetable seasoning

Because I was cooking other things at the same time I baked covered at 300 deg. for 1 hour then turned up to 400 deg. for another hour and they were melt in your mouth. Delicious

Like others recommended I chopped the onions instead of having the rings and added fresh garlic. I also removed the tin foil and added shredded cheese to the top for the last 20 min in the oven. These potatos were amazing!!

These were so good!  I'm a novice cook and used some Yukon Gold potatoes and preshredded cheese that was a labeled "Mexican Cheese" mix...a mixture of white and orange cheeses.  I was unsure until after it baked for the full 90 minutes.  Wow! Yum!

This is a great recipe to bring to a pot luck as they do really well in a crock pot.  This will not replace my favorite Au Gratin recipe but I will definitely make them again when I need to serve the masses.  I use basically this same cheese sauce poured over bow tie pasta for a really good no-bake mac & cheese too.

Easy to make, crowd pleaser.  It may not be 'sophisticated' but a great, comfort food. I did saute the onions down to mellow them out some.  I added a touch of dry mustard to the sauce.   Loved it as a hearty side.

these were awesome! such a good flavor and really simple to make. Next time I think I will slice my potatoes a bit thinner, but that is a personal preference. The cheese sauce was great!

This was pretty good indeed. I layered the potatos and then cheese and then potatos and so on until it was all down. I also added at least 1 extra cup of cheese, may do 2 next time. Also, I didn't add enough salt so they were slightly underseasoned but I would rather under salt than over salt! Thanks!

This is a great base for au gratin potatoes to customize. I add lots of garlic and fresh rosemary to the cheese sauce and sprinkle bacon over the top prior to cooking. Garnish with fresh chives an it's perfection!

This is an amazing recipe! I used a slow cooker instead since I had a pie in the oven. I used soy milk; and also sauteed some mince onions and garlic before mixing it up with the pototoes. Delish!

Dy-no-myte!  The best hint for me was partially cooking the spuds in the microwave for 8 minutes prior to placing in baking dish and cooking in the oven (which shortens the baking time).  First rate grub.

This is just great.  No other way to say it.  I did add garlic to the sauce, along with basil and oregano.  Turned out great  loved the creamy flavor.  Also I used green onions and layed the dish.  Used a cheese blend in the layers.  Wow. Tastes great and easy to make.

Good, added extra cheese, minced onion instead of slices. Added additional pepper (family pref) Hubby loved it would make again for him. Im not a big fan of this kind of potatoes, but they were good.

Really good! I chopped up the onion and sautéed with some garlic in butter. I also used white cheddar cheese since it was all I had on hand. It was delicious, I think next time I will try bacon in it!!

This dish is AMAZING!  I made it for Thanksgiving and it was the best part of the meal for me!  It seems like such a simple recipe, but it really comes out just amazing and so full of flavor!  The only thing I changed was just to dice the onions instead of leaving them in rings, just personal preference!  Thanks for such an amazing recipe!

I grew up eating Betty's Boxed Au Graten. These are great. While the wife dosen't rave over food at all, I did notice her second round was larger than her first. This dish will be a regular at our dinner table from this point forward.

Great recipe, although I did make some personalizations - I used one large scallion in place of the onion, used 3 cloves of garlic, roughly chopped, a mix of 3 cheeses (cheddar/smoked gouda/romano), and whole cream instead of milk.  RAVE reviews!!!

I made this the first time for my BFF (who, incidentally, is a better chef than me which is saying a lot) and our families, and have had to beat off the repeat requests with a meat tenderizer. It truly is fabulous, and the simple ingredients are the best.

I make a couple adjustments .... I use yukon gold potatoes instead of russet; potato flour instead of wheat flour; white pepper instead of black because I hate black specks in light-colored food, and white pepper is more subtle in flavor; and I substitute 1/2 cup buttermilk for 1/2 cup of the milk ... it makes the sauce a little thicker and adds a different dimension of flavor. And I love buttermilk almost as much as I love my hubby!!

Finely ground almonds (or almond flour, which is really just super-fine-ground almonds) sprinkled lightly over the top before the last 5 mins in the oven adds an optional pleasant crunch and lovely layer of flavor.

I followed some of the reviews and it came out pretty good: Mince the onions, layer the potatoes with the cheese sauce, and make extra cheese sauce! I also microwaved the potatoes to save time, but I'd like to try baking them the whole way if I have more time in the future.

This is a great recipe! It's a fav in my family. I don't use onions, and add extra cheese. Make sure you spray the dish before baking, 9x13 works great so the potatoes cook all the way through. I add some mustard powder, and sometimes cooked bacon. So good!

I've now done this recipe twice - first time (per the recipe) was good...tho..(for my taste) the potatoes were a bit hard and bland.  I just made them again, tho..this time I followed a few other reviewers suggestions and parboiled the potatoes in salt water - chopped and sauteed the onions - layered potatoes, sauteed onions, crushed bacon (leftover from breakfast) and cheese sauce.  I also added a couple dashes of crushed dried green tomatoes and basil in the cheese sauce - as well as additional season salt on the potatoes (per my taste)   Either way...depending on your own taste...this is a great recipe...shape it as you please...works every which way !!

Terrific and easy recipe!  My boyfriend loved it!  I took the tip to dice the onion and also to uncover the last 20 minutes (although next time wiwll do last 30 minutes) and I used a 2 quart casserole dish that was almost too small.  I also used salt, pepper, garlic powder, and cayenne seasoned on both layers of potatoes and used part of cheese sauce in thee middle and the rest on top.  I am putting this recipe in my box and will most definitly be making exactly the same way again!!  One tiny downside was that I ended up with a lot of butter that settle on top.  I'm not sure why, could perhaps be because I had to use lactose free milk??  I just scooped off top though and all was awesome!

My husband said this was the best augratin recipe I've fixed.  I tweaked it a bit by adding a bit of garlic salt & a touch of sugar & prepared over my luch hour so it would be oven ready when I got  home from work. I also layered the pre-cooked potatoe slices & cheese mixture. I wasn't sure there would be enough sauce to my liking, but it turned out really well.  Will be fixing this one again & again:)

I've been making potatoes this way for years.  Only differences:
1.  I use SWEET POTATOES instead of onions
2.  Extra cheese (probably a little over 2 cups in total of shredded cheese. 

Can't get enough of these, they are so amazing!

This is practically out of my mother's own recipe file!! 
For a casserole style dish, add some diced ham (or even spam!)

I microwaved the potatoes for 8 minutes until almost tender in my baking dish wiht butter melted on the bottom. I then added cheese mix. I used whole wheat flour. I found the sauce didn't want to thicken well. The flavor was ok, but I wasn't overly impressed.

Yummy yummy!
Using light cheese and taking out the onions makes this recipe very light, and easy to digest. I added ½ cup of cheese and while preparing the cheese souse I had the potatoes cut as recipe says to boil in hot water for 15 min. Like this by the time you prepare the cheese souse you have the potatoes half cooked then you put it in the oven with the cheese for 30 min. 
You save a lot of time and you can have this recipe ready in 1 hour instead of 2 hours.

This recipe has replaced my usual recipe for cheesy potatoes.  I ditched the onions and simply used onion powder.  I also use american cheese in addition to what is called in this recipe.

Read over the other versions here.  This is what I did with some Hammm.

Doubled the recipe by 8 Medium potatoes, Chopped corsely yellow onion instead of rings, added onion to the melted butter to soften. 

Microwaved the sliced potatoes (I used a slicer 2/8") for 10 min in a casorole glass dish with water taking out the more done ones half way through.  

Arranged potatoes in a regular size lasagne glass dish alternating potatoes, sauce with Medium Chedar block that I shreded, then some diced up left over deli honey ham i had left.  I bet a just a little bacon bits on top would be an idea.

I also put a cookie sheet underneith, may have slowed the cooking down but it was a good idea to catch the spills, cooked it for 1hr 20 min. at 400 as directed.

Very Good!  Family of 5

Really good and creamy. I sauted diced onion and add to the cheese sauce with salt and pepper. I also poured some sauce after the first layer and then the rest on top. Last, I uncovered for the last 15 minutes to get golden brown.

Very easy and VERY good!!!  We don't really like onions but I knew it would need it for flavor so I left them in there expecting to pull them all out but they were so soft you couldn't feel them at all while eating them and the flavor was perfect!  Even my husband who is incredibly picky, especially about onions, ate them.

Everyone loved this! I sauteed onion and garlic in the butter before adding sauce ingredients. I doubled the recipe for more people and added sauce in between layers of potato and poured rest of sauce on top. Very good!

Best scalloped potatoe recipe yet! Very simple, fairly quick, and amazingly delicious. I followed some suggestions and added a small layer of grated cheese between the layers of potato & onion, as well as on top. I also sprinkled some breadcrumbs over the top for a crispy finish. I also took the tin foil cover off for the last 30 mins to make sure the sauce thickened & that it was crispy to my liking. Other than those small adjustments, I followed the directions as listed- turned out amazing with grilled pork chops & a side of corn, will definitely make this recipe again!

Super.  I used 5 cups milk and 4 cups cheese to make it saucier as others suggested.  My husband thought it was a little too cheesy but we both agreed that was better than not cheesy enough:)  I would also use a little less butter next time.

It was very good.  I did use more than the specified milk amount because it was too thick.  I cut and boiled my potatoes before baking them.  I also sauteed the onions before baking.  That way I only had to bake for 25 minutes.  I made the potatoes with baked mayo glazed salmon and was able to bake both the salmon and the potatoes at the same time.

I had only ever tried Potatoes au gratin from a box. This recipe was absolutely flawless. The onions added the perfect amount of oniony flavour known in potatoes au gratin, and was so creamy and cheesy. I used skim milk mozzerella and it was delicious! Any cheese would work for these. This is definately going on my families favourites! I didn't change a THING on the recipe except the type of cheese.

I cant say enough about this recipe, great!!!!! My bf said they were the best hes ever had. So simple and all common ingredients on hand. The only change I made was to chop onion and omit one potatoe added extra cheese, we like them more soupy. I was very impressed with the outcome for its simplicity and so pleased it did not have fake cheese food in it, will make these again and again definite keeper for me.

Very popular. Make double the sauce and put some between the layers of potatoes. Also add 8 oz cream cheese to the sauce for the best taste.

These were easy to make, and turned out really good.  I mostly followed the recipe as is, except I used only 1/2 onion (it was a big onion).  I did not have 1 1/2 hours for baking, so set the oven on 400, and baked the first half hour uncovered.  Then covered with foil for the second half hour. The potatoes were cooked and tender at this point. Added some extra cheese on top, and baked until this melted.  We really enjoyed this, and will definitely make again.

File this one under "Sinful"!!  Sooo good!  I used heavy cream for one of the cups of milk and used 1/2 grated cheddar and 1/2 grated pepperjack cheese.  Also added pepper, onion powder, and a bit of basil.  My husband and I ate more than 1/2 of what I prepared!!  Served with smoked pork chops and green beans!  You gotta try this one!

Great recipe!  To make this a "meal" I cut up and cooked some chicken sausage and onion.  I layered the sausage and onion among the potatoes and then poured the cheese sauce over the potatoes, sausage and onions.  Baked as suggested and my family loves it!

This is a great recipe. I only changed the type of cheese used since I made this as a side dish to go with stuffed peppers. I used mozerella and asiago cheese instead of cheddar. Easy recipe and very good outcome.

LOVE this recipe!  Taste delicious!  I usually double up the recipe, but don't double everything...just eye what I think.  Love the flavor and so easy.  I just melt some butter in the microwave and mix some flour, pepper, and milk, and pour over top.  I don't use the full amount of cheese as we add some velvetta cheese for flavor.  Would recommend this recipe.

Cooked the onions first and then added some garlic to it (then turned that into the roux).  It was really good!

ive made this about 4 times already and my hubby keeps asking for more!! the only changes i make are parbaking the potatoes in the microwave to shorten baking time, used seasoning salt and cracked pepper in between layers for extra flavor and sauteing the diced onions in butter before layering with potatoes.
otherwise this recipe is super easy, reminds me of mac n cheese recipe too.. i like to use medium cheddar and it tastes super delicious. oh yeah and also topped with more cheese and panko breadcrumbs and uncovered for last 20 minutes for a nice crispy crust.

I never made these from scratch before, but wow, do they beat the boxed version!  I chopped the onion (used 1/2 and that was plenty) and mixed it in with the potatoes.  I used mozzarella instead of cheddar because that's what I happened to have on hand.  There is no way 4 potatoes would fit in a one quart baking dish unless they're tiny; I had to use a 9x13 dish.

Was great with a few alterations. I added chopped onions as well as green onions. Then I added crushed garlic to the sauce and added the cheese at the end and let it melt. Took of foil during last 20 minutes to get crispy. If you do decide to place cheese in sauce, make sure to butter or grease bake dish well because I did not, and now I will have to soak dish. Will make again!

These were delicious, and I had enough for leftovers. I have to say that they were even better when I reheated them the next day when the flavors had mixed a little more!

REALLY good!  I had about 1/4 cup of heavy cream and about 1 cup of fat free half and half so I used that and 3/4 cups skim milk.  Not sure if it made any difference, but wanted to use the cream and 1/2 and 1/2 before it expired.  I did use a little more cheese than the recipe called for and I even sprinkled some on top for the last 10 minutes of cooking.  Also added a little salt and a little pepper.  The one other thing I did differently was to use a bag of Simply Potatoes brand "homestyle slices" since I had some on hand.  OH! and I left out the onions because they don't agree with a member of the family.  GREAT comfort food!

I make this every time we have guests for dinner and are having steak or ribs.  I leave out the onions since my husband is not a fan of them.  I do garlic, salt, pepper, and put chives in the potatoes before adding the cheese mixture.  I like to add cheddar, parmesan, feta, and gruyere cheese to the mix.  I also like to do a mixture of both potatoes and cauliflower.  It adds some nutrition and takes away lots of the starchiness!

I added a lot of extra cheese, both in the sauce and on top.  Maybe an extra cup or two cups.  I also sprinkled bread crumbs on top, although I don't know how much that did for it.

Huge hit, to make it lower in fat I used nonfat milk & EXTRA SHARP cheddar cheese.  I also love onions (diced)  so I added more and sauteed them in the butter.  Will make again.

I did chop the onion and pretty much followed the rest of recipe.  It was very good although I like my potatoes cooked a little more so would cook it a little longer than reciepe calls for next time.

Most of the family loved them, I thought they were a little bland.  I tried to make them in the crockpot (as mentioned in several reviews), but after 6 hours and 30 minutes before all the other food was done, the potatoes were still raw (cheese sauce was nice, though).  Luckily, there was time to move them to the oven, split between two dishes so they'd be single layers, and they were done in 30 minutes.  Moral: Don't know how others did it, but I'll never try these in a crock pot again.

Tasted delicious, but I think next time I'll add some cornstarch to thicken the sauce up a bit.  I took the advice of some of one reviewer and increased the sauce by half, and added double the cheese.  For some reason, the sauce was very runny.  Still, the flavor was amazing!  I minced the onion and sprinkled garlic powder in the middle layer and over the top along with some pepper before adding the cheese.  Everyone loved it, even though it wasn't very pretty.

excellent although I did triple the recipe for holiday dish, so instead of 6 cups of milk i used 4 cups and about 2 cups of half and half. I also sauteed some onion and garlic in butter before topping the papas! Sharp cheese of course!!!! KEEPER in my cookbook.

These were really good, but I think they can use a little tweaking. 1-I think that sharp cheese or a mix of cheeses would taste better than just the cheddar. It would give it more of a bold flavor which I like. 2- Also more salt and pepper is a MUST! I followed the recipe and felt it was under seasoned. 3- I took the advice from other another reviewer and did an extra 1/2 recipe of the cheese sauce. 4- After they are done cooking, let them sit for a few minutes before serving. In the oven, mine looked really runny. After they sat for a few mins they thickened up and were great!

I just finished preparing this recipe.  I doubled the amount and added 1/2 cup bacon and  3 small garlic cloves to it for a nice touch.  I also used a 3 cheese blend of vermont white cheddar, sharp cheddar, and mild cheddar.

Delicious!  This was much better than I anticipated, what with such simple ingredients. It was so tasty.  I used spelt flour (because of a wheat allergy,)diced the onions and layered the cheese sauce in the middle as well as on top. I also put a sheet pan under my casserole dish because of cheesy overflow and was glad I had! The rest was just as written and it was yummy.  I'll make this again and again.

I will give this 4 stars because it was a great. Since It didnt call for canned cream of anything. But what I did differently was....I chopped up some onion, minced garlic, and mushrooms, added that with the butter...then made my creamy/cheese sauce. Dont be afraid to add SALT! just when you think its enough...add just a pinch more. It wont be so bland as some people thought it was.

This was good, but I thought it needed a dash of some kind of seasoning.   I followed the recipe as it was written, if I try again I'll add a dash of something like cayenne or mustard powder.  Just needed something to jazz it up.

I made the recipe as written, and it was pretty good. As is, I think that it makes a great base recipe that needs some extra customizing.

This is a great basic recipe. It does lack in flavor slightly. I suggest adding garlic powder or sauteing a couple of cloves of garlic and adding that to the sauce. Also, black pepper is a must. This recipe is so basic that it gives plenty of leeway for experimenting with different flavors.

Very Yummy - I will never buy boxed au gratin potatoes again!  I was pinched for time, so I sliced the potatoes very thin and baked a little hotter - they finished in just about an hour.  Used cheddar and monterey jack mix for the cheese sauce.  Topped with panko bread crumbs and parmesan cheese for the last 10 minutes.

Yep, these were good!  I doubled the recipe to accomodate dinner for 10 people.  The only changes I made were to dice the onions and mix them with the potatoes first.  I also mixed the sauce with the potatoes before putting it int he baking dish.  I also used Sharp cheddar cheese, which gave it fantastic flavour!  Thanks for a great recipe!

We did not enjoy these at all, and we normally love au gratin potatoes.  We thought they were pretty bland, and didn't reheat well.

This is an awesome recipe but if you are a cheese lover, as we are, add another 2 cups of shredded. I made the rue like in recipe and added about 1 to 2 cups of cheese than I layered tators, sauce, and a good handful of the cheese and I did it again for the next layer and added some shredded parm to the top as well. Mine always take a little longer to cook cause the tators aren't done in 1.5 That may be my oven so I an gonna preboil the tators while I am making the sauce next time. But it is a keeper!!! family loves it!

We liked it a lot, but I didn't want to give it five stars because I made a few changes.  I omitted the onion and sauteed a clove of garlic in the butter when making the sauce.  I made it in a 1.5 qt. dish, but next time will make it in a bigger one (9x9 pan)--we like it thinner and browned on top.

The flavor was very good. I didn't like the idea of onion rings being bigger than the potatoes so I cut them in half moons. I didn't even have 1/2 cup cheddar.  So, I added a can of cheddar cheese soup.

I was going to give these four stars until my husband and kids started fighting over them!  Promised them I would make them again soon and this time double the recipe... that made them all happy.  Only thing I did different was add 1/2 cup of cheese more than recipe calls for.  So nice to make everyone happy for a change :)

Bake UNCOVERED for about 1 hour and you can more easily time the other parts of your meal.  Uncovered also allows the cheese to blend with the potates and makes a crust which enhances presentation.  Layer 1/2 of the potatoes, then 1/2 the cheese sauce.  Place balance of the potatoes over that and the remaining cheese sauce.  This allows more complete coverage of the potatoes with the sauce.  Onions should be condidered optional, we don't care for them so I just left them out.  If you sprinkle some extra grated cheese on top instead of bread crumbs, it will brown nicely and look better when served.  Bake time is mostly determined by the thickness of the potato slices.

This certainly doensn't need another review but here goes.  I saw these as the recipe of the day, and decided last minute to make them.  Only trouble was, I didnt have 2 hours, it was more like one hour.  So I cut up the tators and diced some onions and put them in the casserole dish and covered with water, and then into the microwave.  While that was cooking, I was able to get the sauce going, to which I added some chives and I used a Mexican blend of cheese.  After I drained the tators, I was able to spray the dish before returning the tators and sauce.  Then I finished it off in the oven.  It was very very good.  Thank you for sharing.

Great recipe. I have been making it for 40+ years. If I am really in a hurry I just cut up some ham and throw it into the sauce. You have a whole meal in a dish. It is whole food..no additives and very tasty. The onion really gives it nice flavor. Pepper is a good addition too. It is pretty much fool proof.

This is virtually indistinguishable from the ones I've been making for years.  I just chop the onions up, add garlic and saute them before adding the flour to make a white roux before adding the milk.  A real crowdpleaser!

Tasty recipe for this great comfort food dish. I thought it needed a little more salt or some kind of spicy kick, though. But it's a great base recipe and I will continue to make it for my family.

In a word, DIVINE!  Made these TONIGHT (with a slight adjustment), and when my husband tasted the first spoonful - which caused his eyes to roll back in ecstasy - I knew this was a winner!  The slight adjustment is just that I chopped, then sweated, the onion in about a Tbs. of butter; covered saucepan, med. heat, while I was getting the sauce together on another burner.  Once onions were softened and slightly golden, I removed the lid of the saucepan and let the onion caramelize a bit further, which added such depth of flavor to the dish!  And, as other reviewers have done, I layered it:  potatoes (seasoning each layer with S&P + dash of garlic powder), onions and sauce; repeat., finishing with sauce.    Should probably have been very liberal with the butter on the bottom of the dish (Pyrex - 13X9X2 glass), since the potatoes did stick slightly.  But we'll just have that much more fun picking, scraping and eating the burnt bits from the bottom and sides!    Thanks for a LOVELY recipe!  I will make this again -- probably tomorrow night -- and can't wait to share the recipe AND the food with friends!  :D

Have made this 3 times now. I agree that this doesn't need to be overly exaggerated. It's just a side dish - like mashed potatoes or vegetables.  The second time I made it, I got the best result. Instead of cutting the potatoes I grated them using the side of the grater with 3 blades. It sliced them perfectly. I put a layer of sauce between the two layers of potatoes and a layer of sauce on top. I also added a bit more salt to the sauce (as the cheese wasn't salty). The last trick was something my French buddy told me - a sprinkling of cinnamon on top. That really made it great.

I used onion powder instead of onions, layered the potatoes, seasoned slightly, sauced and repeated. Good flavor, sauce was grainy for me. Thanks CathyM.

Three thumbs up! According to my children, anyway.  I needed to find something using potatoes, other than baked/mashed.  I didn't have time to bake it in the oven, nor did I want to heat up the kitchen, so I did it in the microwave for 15 min.  It was wonderful!  Thanks so much.  Definitely will be doing this more often.

These were a hit! My only suggestion is to uncover them for the last part of baking so that the top is nice and crispy. It also helps the sauce thicken a bit.

I've made this dish twice and it's delicious! Here's what I did differently: -No onions. -Sliced potatoes ultra-thin with a mandoline. -Topped with breadcrumbs on top the last 15 minutes of cook time. It is worlds away from the boxed stuff. My boyfriend loves it!

This was delicious!!  I cut the onion into finer pieces, and added a tsp. of mustard powder (basic rue recipe).  Also, took the foil off wayyy earlier to get the top golden brown and crispy.  I will never make box potatoes again!!!  And will share this with my family members so they won't either! :)

Made these for Easter, and they tasted great!! I would have like it if the sauce was a little thicker after baking- next time, I'll add corn starch as recommended by another reviewer. But it didn't seem to bother my family- the entire 9x13 inch pan disappeared!! Got lots of compliments- thanks so much for this recipe!!

Wonderful! I made the recipe for 16. The only change I made was to mince the onion and sauté it w/ garlic. Yum! Just as a note, don't worry if your sauce doesn't get really thick--you can add a bit of corn starch if you are really concerned--but, as it bakes the dish that you thought was a soupy mess comes together just great. :)

These are really good and easy to make... I didn't add the onions as I wasn't sure how crunchy they would be at the end. I also would recommend salting between the layers.

We all really enjoyed this as a side dish. I left out the onions because nobody likes them. I also sliced the potatoes a bit thinner than 1/4 inch, and added a bit of salt and pepper to each layer of potatoes in the pan. I sprinkled bread crumbs on top before baking, and left the pan uncovered so they would brown. Delicious!

First of all, CathyM, thank you so much for making an Au Gratin Potatoes recipe without "Cream of xxxxx Soup"!  I only made one little change.  I minced the onion.  I love the taste of onions but the texture of slices in au gratin potatoes isn't something I want.  I layered everything in the pan including the cheese and baked covered for 1 hour and uncovered for the last 1/2 hour.  Wonderful.

Great recipe. I used a mandolin slicer to get the potatoes really thin. It cuts the cooking time in half and I love the crispier texture on the top. I gave it four stars instead of five because it was a little bland but I didn't add a lot of salt and pepper to taste. I would definitely salt and pepper each layer. I used a monterey jack, cheddar, swiss cheese blend, but next time I want to just use cheddar and see if that will add more flavor to the dish. I also wanted to try it with crumbled bacon next time to make it more palatable to my kids. But it is a good, easy recipe with a lot of possibilities.

This recipe is phenomenal! Of course, like most, I can't just follow a recipe verbatim. I added 1 tablespoon of garlic and 1 tablespoon of pepper to the milk and flour mixture. I sauteed the onion in a tablespoon of butter, until they were lightly caramelized. I, too, did a potato, onion, and cheese layer rotation. Like other reviewers I sprinkled a little cheese on each layer. The results were fantastic! The flavor of the onion was spot on! It really kicked the dish up a notch. This is definitely not your every night side dish because of its rich, velvety, high caloric "taste so good" nature, but I plan to make this for my family again!

These were good, but they needed something...probably garlic.  They were very easy to make and I will make them again with some tweeking.  I ran short on time, so I cooked them for 1 hour @ 425 and then uncovered them for about 10 minutes....you definitely need to uncover during the last 10-15 minutes of cooking.

Loved this! The simple subtle flavors were great. In this world of over spicing everything til you can't tell what it is anymore a nice homey, simple dish is awesome. My family loves this and asks for it often.

Made this for a Christmas side dish and was disappointed by the lack of flavor. Read the reviews and added more cheese (mix of colby and cheddar). Sliced the potatoes thinner for a more Au Gratin taste not a casserole. Overall was ok but will work on this recipe.

I was looking for something other than plain scalloped pototes to go with the ham I was making. I decided to try this recipe and I am happy that I did. It was very good and the sauce was nice and creamy, however, I did chop the onions because I didn't think I would like big pieces of onion in it. I also added bread crumbs to the top. I will make this again.

My kids and father in law loved this dish! The only changes I made to the recipe were to add about 1/4 cup minced red onion and I used 1/2 a block of Cracker Barrel cheddar cheese (I had it on hand). It was awesome! I also cooked this in the microwave because I knew it would take too long in the oven. Cooked about 20 mins on med-high power and last 10 on high. Perfection!

Easy, yummy...delicious! Following recommendations of others (and personal preferences) I diced the onions and breifly sauteed them, rather than just slicing and adding with the potaotes. Since I had some half/half to use up, I did 1c of that and 1c milk. Served with ham and veggies. --The recipe stretched way beyond what it yields (1 potato per person... no one ate nearly that much with other things on the table to round out the meal...)

I love this recipe. I have made this many times just as is.  I have also read others reviews and made some changes like adding more cheese or taking the foil off the last 20-15 min and adding breadcrumbs.  This last time I incorporated some diced smoked ham and let it bake.  It smelled so wonderful and my stomach wouldn't stop growling until I had the first bite!  I paired it with some broccoli on the side.

OMG! This is rich, cheesy, oh so full of flavor. The onions really heighten the cheese flavor and reduce the starchy taste that potatoes can sometimes give. This is a keeper !

Very good.  Oddly, the bottom got very brown but the top didn't.  I would probably stop the cooking time about 5 minutes sooner and instead broil the top.

This is an awesome recipe.  I doubled the recipe & put it in a 9X13 dish.  I placed the dish on a cookie sheet covered in foil & I am glad I did.  It bubbled over.  Next time I'll put it in a deeper dish.   I minced the onions & sauted them in some olive oil before adding them to the potatoes.  I layered the potatoes, onions then cheese.  I had 2 layers then added bread crumbs on top.  This is definately a keeper.  I might even add it to our Christmas menu.  Thanks for posting it.

I needed a quick recipe to use up some extra baked potatoes my over zealous boyfriend made and this worked perfectly!  I left out the onions, as we didn't have any, but it seemed just fine. I also didn't have enough cheddar for the 1 1/2 cups, so I put in what I had and then tossed in some cream cheese and romano as well. Absolutely fantastic and I'll be sure to make these again!

I am re-reviewing it now that I've had a few years of cooking under me belt! I used about 1.5x the cheese, and it was a mix of cheese-ends from a cheese counter and an extra hunk of red liciester (think a flavorful, nutty mild cheddar). Needed an ounce more milk. Because it was halved, cooked in about 75mins. Chopped the onion, added garlic, added salt, cooked in a glass casserole with a lid on the entire time. Perfect and delicious.

Yummy recipe.  I, too, made a few slight changes.  Like many others suggested, I diced the onions instead of slicing them.  I also softened them in the butter along with one clove of fresh, minced garlic before adding the flour to make the rue -- I added 1/4 tsp of black pepper to the rue for added flavor.  I used a 2qt casserole, layered 1/3 of the sliced potatoes and topped with 1/3 the onion/cheese sauce, and repeated this step twice.  I, too, removed the foil with about 30 minutes remaining in the cooking time and topped with buttered bread crumbs before putting it back in the oven for the final 30 minutes.  Loved this recipe!  Next time, I'm going to try a "grown up" version using Gruyere cheese!

I made these potatoes today and I think they were the best that I have ever made. I used Velveeta instead of shredded cheese and it turned out so creamy.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great comfort food. I omitted the onions because we don't do onions. Make sure your main dish has great flavor as this does not have a strong taste. I use sharp cheddar. Don't try the microwave shortcut with the potatoes unless you absolutely know what you're doing -- it made my cheese sauce fail to be creamy (separated). Also, doubling the sauce recipe may cause you to spend more time heating the sauce than you think is necessary.

So here's what I did. I sliced the potatoes and the onions very thin - this reduced the cook time to about an hour. I used more butter and more cheese than the recipe called for, resulting in very tender potatoes and onions - perhaps this is why I didn't have a problem with the onion rings as so many others do - they were completely soft and I barely noticed them! I say add spices to suit whatever your tastes are - I seasoned the potatoes with seasoning salt, black pepper, garlic powder and cajun seasoning, and also added garlic powder and black pepper to the cheese sauce. The result: The best potatoes I've ever had! I will definitely make these again and again. Deeee-lish!!

My family LOVED this recipe!  I did make some small adjustments to the recipe.  I cooked the onions in olive oil so they would be fully cooked as the kids do not like raw onion.  I also added approximately three ounces of cream cheese to the cheese sauce.  The end result was a very creamy, cheesy potato dish that my family gobbled up quickly.  Thank you KathyM!

This has become a staple in my household. I have made this many many times now. The first time I followed the recipe exactly. Turned out fabulous! A 1 quart casserole dish is NOT big enough though. Over time I have made some changes. I use 6 potatoes, dice the onion, use 3 cups milk, 3 cups shredded cheddar and add diced ham. I mix everything together first, then put it in a 13x9 pan, sprayed with cooking spray. Like another reviewer the spices change. I usually omit the salt (the ham adds plenty) but do add pepper, garlic powder and some red pepper flakes to the milk mixture. The last 20 minutes I take the foil off so it browns. I serve it with a salad and some crusty bread. It's an absolutely wonderful meal!

Absolutely the creamiest au gratin potatoes I have ever had.  Just a real good comfort food.  It is the right balance of potato and cheese flavor.  Would definitely make it again without changing a thing.  My family loved them.

I agree with other reviews that the onions should be diced but this recipe is excellent!  Adding a little nutmeg just prior to pouring the sauce on the potatoes is a real treat too!

I wanted to make absolutely sure that the onions would have no crunch, so I chose to saute them with some minced garlic and some butter over medium heat first. It came out great. I'll definitely be making this for my family again and again.

This was a nice recipe to have instead of the box version.  I always worry about the chemicals, additives and preservatives used in pre packaged foods.  I used mild cheddar but may use sharp cheddar next time.  I also used 1/2 a small onion.  We were having meatloaf and didn't really want to have a complete onion meal.  Next time I may use no onion at all and add cornflakes or bread crumbs to the top.

My husband told me he didn't really like au gratin potatoes but he ate two helpings of this!  Very yummy.  I did saute some garlic and the onion and added a little nutmeg to the bechamel sauce.  This one is going in my permanent file.

So good! So good! I made these last night for dinner and just had the leftovers for lunch! They were even better the second day. Don't skimp on the cheese or onions. I used green onions because that is what I had. I like the flavor of green onions in potato/cheese dishes anyways. This is easy to make and went well with our pork entree.

good serviceable recipe, not sublime but very good indeed. It takes a long time but most of it is spent into the oven, so not so much work for you. The onions gave the necessary twist, and the bechamelle sauce is quite the thing: I was afraid it would be too runny but it served to cook the potatoes nicely. Good comfort food

Exactly what the title describes. I changed nothing at all, and enjoyed a wonderful comforting cheesy dish. You can certainly jazz this up more, but with good potatoes and a tasty cheese of your choice, this is sure to make you go 'mmmmmmmmmmm' all the way down to your toes. Thank you to the poster, its a lovely recipe.

I made these for Easter dinner. I doubled the recipe using dehydrated chopped onions, and more cheese than the recipe called for. I used a Vermont white cheddar and a Wisconsin extra sharp cheddar. I baked it in a 9x13 pyrex pan on a rimmed jelly roll pan lined with aluminum foil. I baked it a 300 degrees along with my ham for the same amount of time, about 2 hrs and 45 minutes. Uncovered and topped with extra cheese for the last 45 minutes. It was fantastic. Smooth creamy and delicious. Well worth the time.

I have been using this recipe for a couple years, and realized I should log a review to tell everyone how awesome this is!  The potatoes and sauce are indeed addictive, and I've caught my family eating the leftovers cold out of the fridge with a spoon -- it's that good!  Sometimes I slice the onion and layer it, sometimes I dice it and add it to the sauce mixture (depends if I'm feeling lazy or not), but besides that, I make no changes.  I loveloveLOVE this recipe!  Thanks so much, CathyM!

I am about to make this for our Easter dinner.  Really sounds good to me.  And far better than that cardboard stuff from the box!  I'll post later if it was a winner or not with my familiy.  But I have a problem with Emily.  Granted it was 3 years ago, but jeez, Emily.  If you have a better recipe, JUST POST IT!!!!  Don't trash another's recipe, just because you do it differently.  Your's is a unique recipe, post it.  Don't put down or "this is how I do it" type reply!  Totally puts me off...if you're so good, post it.  If not, shut up!  Sorry, but I have a problem with folk who take an original recipe and say it's great EXCEPT...then submit a totally differently recipe.  Sorry if I offended, JMHO!  Will let you know how this turned out!!

These were the best au gratin potatoes I ever had!  I made them almost exactly as directed except for cutting the onion in small pieces and adding some more cheese.  It was a lot for 2 people but we ate the leftovers too!

Simply to die for. I've made this at least seven times in the past two months (for potlucks and such, not just for myself). Very easy, inexpensive, and delicious!

Yum, yum, yum!  I've not eaten au gratin potatoes in years and years.  This recipe is exactly how I expected au gratin potatoes to be.  Just don't even bother looking at the cals and fat - ignore them and don't bother with any substitutions either because these potatoes are so worth eating as written - ultimate comfort food.  Served with gammon, green beans and corn.

Everyone knows I don't like potatoes.  I hate baked potato, I'll only eat a small amount of mashed potatoes if it's swimming in gravy, and I'll only eat curly fries.    But even when dinner was over... i kept getting up during the movie to get "one more bite" of this!!!  deliciousssssssss!!

This was fantastic -- my family loved it! I used a bit more cheese than it called for (can never have too much cheese), and I made sure to cut the potatoes and onions as thin as I could (also helped with the cooking time). Only suggestion that I have is to make sure you use a stronger cheese. I used mild cheddar, and it didn't quite have enough zing for me. Next time will try medium or sharp.

Using 4 potatoes is vague, I apparently used 4 very large potatoes (that is all the store had) and probably needed to have doubled the sauce.  I will try again but I'm not convinced this is the recipe yet.

I made this dish for New Years. Love it! 
Really easy to make. I cut the potatoes and onion up thin. I would make a layer, put salt/Pepper and onions. Keep doing those steps over and over. I didn't put salt in my butter cause I was using salt though out the layers. So I didn't want it to be to salty. Everything came out great! Would make again.

This was great!  Be warned that throughout the process, you'll keep thinking to yourself "it's too liquidy..it'll never bake down!"  Don't mess with it! :) I kept thinking it wouldn't thicken up but it turned out perfectly. The key is to let it sit after baking for about 5 minutes to thicken up.  It was the perfect consistency, cheesiness & yumminess!  My husband is purely a baked potato guy.  He hates mashed potatoes & thought this concoction would be too much like that but he loved it!  I highly recommend this recipe.

I really liked this recipe, however I did modify it. I sliced the potatoes thinner than 1/4". I diced the onions and sauted them. I also roasted some garlic, aboout 5 cloves. When they were done, I removed the skin and pushed them through a strainer. I followed the direction to prepare the cheese sauce. I did add extra cheese. While I was whisking the sauce, I added the onions, roasted garlic, 1/2 tsp caynne pepper, parsley, garlic & onion powder and salt & pepper. I put the slightly cooked potaotes in a large bowl, poured the sauce over the potaotes and mixed carefully. I let it sit  and then layered the potaotes in a casserole dish, poured the sauce on top and baked. I added more cheese on top about 15 minutes before serving, baking it uncovered to melt/brown cheese. My husband absolutley LOVED it. I thinkt hat the next time I make it, I will mix everything the night before and let the flavors fuse together.

We love this recipe!  I do add more cheese to it though...  It is super easy and a winner with everyone!

Increase cheese to 2 cups; use 1 c. sharp cheddar, 1 c. gruyere or swiss or any combo of cheeses.
Double the recipe for potlucks and use a 3 qt. pan.

Very good recipe.  I used very large potatoes, so doubled the cheese sauce (used 1/2 mild cheddar and 1/2 sharp cheddar) and baked in a 9X13 glass pan.  Also thinly chopped the onion/large mince instead of slices.  I took others' advice and removed the covering for the last 30 minutes of baking.  Came out great; however, it was so full of grease that I needed to use a turkey baster/syringe to suck up a whole cup of grease that was pooling on top when it came out of the oven.  After that...tastes great!  I will definitely make again.

These were the best potatoes! I made them for my picky neices, and they told me this tasted just like mac & cheese, but with potatoes, and they were right.  Easy, and a hit with the kids.

WOW.  These potatoes were great.  The only change I made was to dice the onion.  The cheese mixture is delicious!!  I think I'll use it for other recipes, such as mac & cheese.
Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!

I've made this for two thanksgivings so far and everyone loves it! I suggest boiling the sliced potatoes for a bit before moving on with the rest of the recipe if you want to cut down on baking time (really helpful especially if you're making this for the holidays and is short on time). I didn't boil them the first time I made it and it took forever to cook and ended up with slightly raw/crunchy potatoes. I also omitted the onions since some of the people I was cooking for don't like them.  Also added an extra 1/2 cup of cheddar so it'd be extra cheesy. All in all a great recipe that I will continue using!

Very easy and delicious! I made some slight modifications - used 2 cups of cheese, chopped the onions and added bread crumbs on top for the last few minutes of baking. I will make these instead of a box mix from now on!

I just finished a serving of this and can't wait to go get more! I used a 2 qt casserole and could only fit 3 potatoes. I ran out of milk so I used 1 cup milk and 1 cup sour cream. Also added some dried chives to the milk mixture and topped off with seasoned bread crumbs. Very good!

Creamy is right! This recipe is delicious! When I made the cream sauce, I used old cheddar cheese and mixed diced onions right into the sauce. I used just a pinch more on the salt, with pepper and a hint of thyme. The potatoe slices weren't cut too thick and it was ready in 1 1/2 hours. This recipe is a keeper.

Very good and creamy. To save time I buy pre-cooked and peeled new potatoes in a can. It cuts down on the prep time and no one can tell the difference. I also omit the onion slices and use onion powder instead.

The best au gratin potatoes I've ever served!  I doubled the recipe and used my mandoline slicer for the onions and potatoes.  Using speed-bake, even the double recipe was done in just over an hour.  I removed the foil for the last 12 minutes or so for browning.  Next time, I may add garlic and/or precooked bacon pieces, and, following Joy's idea, I may precook the onions and potatoes (separately) in the microwave to speed it up even more.  It's a lovely recipe as is, but I love to experiment, so...

This was delicious! I added my onions to the butter, flour, milk mixture and microwaved my potato slices before putting them in the casserole dish...instead of cooking the augratin for an 1 1/2 hours I only cooked it for 35 minutes and it was done!

These were very good. Lots of creamy cheesy sauce and even though it was just poured over the top layer, it did get all the way through the dish. The onions added a nice flavor too. I used a cheddar/american cheese blend and it turned out fine. I should have used a little more salt though as they needed it. Cheese sauce was simple to make just time consuming. I cooked this in a countertop convection oven and it was done in 45 minutes. I did have to let mine stand another 40 min though since I had the meal timed to be done when these were supposed to be ready. They were still hot and tasty even after standing all that time. Thanks, I enjoyed this dish a lot!

THE best.  We Irish love potatoes, but this is Nirvana!  Will have to find an excuse to make them with every Sunday dinner from now on.  Added both garlic and onion salt, and was more generous with sprinkling on pepper as well. Doubled the recipes to assure that there would be leftovers and added at least 1 cup of extra sharp cheddar, turning on broiler for the last couple of minutes to get that great color on top..mmmmmmmmm.  Thanks for a wholesome, perfect recipe.

These are delicious, I made them for family and everyone insisted I give them the recipe. Someone actually said they wanted to eat a huge bowl of these as their entire dinner! I made a couple of changes, I added salt and pepper to the sauce before stirring it in with the potatoes and onions. I also sauteed the onions, cut into smaller pieces, with a couple tablespoons of butter to cut down on the raw onion flavor. I would also suggest mixing the onions, potatoes, and sauce all together and definitely uncover these for the last 20 minutes. Great recipe!

This is a keeper.  Better than most Au Gratin recipes because it's relatively easy and straight forward to prepare. I took the advice of others and used minced onion instead of rings.  We grated extra sharp cheddar from a large block we had in the fridge and I actually ran to the store for whole milk since we usually only use skim.  I did end up removing the foil within 15 minutes of the completed time and even broiled it for 2-4 minutes at the very end.  Nice side dish!  Good enough for company.

I make this dish fairly often and I highly recommend it. I generally use less onion just because my family doesn't care for onion, but if your family likes onion don't cut back. :)

I feel weird giving this two stars since so many people gave it rave reviews.  I just didn't like this recipe.  It took FOREVER to make and just as long to cook!!  Then the it was bland.  It wasn't anything that tickled my fancy.  I guess I'll have to keep looking for an Au Gratin Potatoe recipe.  :(

This recipe was terrific served next to homemade pizza and green salad. One issue I have with it- surely the casserole dish must be larger than one quart. For me, the potatoes and onion barely fit into a two quart dish.

I was disappointed in this recipe. I'm not sure if I cooked it too long, or what, but it turned out bland and too crispy around the edges.

These were delicious!  Everyone loved them!  I was afraid to try homemade Au Gratin Potatoes but this was easy.  Mine were cooked within an hour, but I sliced the potatoes very thin.  I also added bacon cooked very crispy (the bacon that is already cooked, threw it in the microwave).  I added sour cream as well...I put in 1 3/4 cup of milk and 1/4 cup of sour cream...I didn't add the sour cream until after the cheese melted.  If you don't like onions, you will need to replace them with something else because they really add a great taste to this dish.  Don't forget to let the milk thicken when adding to the butter & flour or it will come runny.  Mine also browned on the bottom (but I liked the taste), I did move it up to the top rack and I took off the foil the last 15 minutes, I think that this helped to thicken the sauce as well.  I will be using this recipe for a long, long time...thank you!

This is a really really tasty recipe, wow.  Comfort food to the max.  And the sauce is a good cheese sauce, I've used just that for other things.  I'm thinking of making this again and putting in chunks of ham or sausage and maybe some corn- more of a main dish all in one.  I added a little pinch of paprika to the sauce after the cheese, I like the flavor it gives. I'm sure this would have been perfect without it.

This was good, I too changed up the recipe, per suggestions, and sauteed the onions with some garlic.  I split the recipe into two batches, I baked them both at the same time, but ate the second one the next day.  I did change the second one a bit after having the first one.  I put some corn chip crumbs on top of it and baked (from cold) for about 15 minutes.  The second day potatoes were much better than the first.

I made this last night and as usual, the first time I made it per directions. My family enjoyed it, but my husband and step son both said that the onions needed to be chopped or diced instead of in rings, I think so too, also I had to add more salt and pepper. The ease and flavor were right on, and the time of cooking was on, (usually I have crunchy potatoes).  More salt and pepper and diced onions and it is a five.  Thanks for a wonderful dish.

Very nice (side) dish! I made it with mozarella instead of cheedar, and I added garlic powder to my potatoes. I double the recipe and also added some extra milk in the pan after I had all the ingredients in because I wanted to get rid of it. It came out great. And with a sprinkle of mozarella on top it looked great as well. I didn't count how much time I had it in the oven though, but probaly a little bit more than the recommened by the recipe so as it thickens more.

Pretty darn good. The boyfriend is picky but I thought it was good. Like another reviewer said, it's comfort food; it doesn't have to be out-of-this-world with salt or seasonings to taste good! If your taste buds are used to more flavoring then stir in a little onion powder or herb of choice along with the cheese.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I've made it numerous times and it seems like it tastes better every time.  I leave out the onions but sometimes add a couple of dashes of onion powder.  I also use two cups of cheese, and take the foil off for the last 30 minutes to brown the top a little.  Thank you so much for posting this delicious easy recipe for creamy comfort food!

These were awesome! I have tried many different Au Gratin Potatoes Recipes and could never find a recipe that I liked. These will be my new Au Gratin Recipe from now on.  I used 1 tsp of Onion Powder instead of a onion (I just don't care for consistency of onions but I like the taste they give so I prefer using onion Powder or Flakes.) I also added 3/4 tsp of Garlic Powder and 1/2 tsp of Italion Seasoning. (All of the seasonings I added to the butter as it was melting. Then just poured the cheese sauce over the potatoes. They were so amazing thanks for a great recipe!

I made this to go with Christmas ham and it was very well received.  Per other reviews, I minced and sauteed the onion before adding it to the layers and used additional salt and pepper.  I also used a combination of cheddar and asiago cheese because it's what I had on hand.  As others have commented, I recommend removing the foil 15 minutes before removing the potatoes from the oven- the top became golden brown and crispy around the edges.  YUM!

This recipe made me a Kitchen Goddess over Thanksgiving! We're a military family and we often invite over airmen who can't go home for the holidays and I was thrilled when this came out exactly as advertised! Also it was easy to put together. The only change I made was to cut my potatoes in thin circles and then layered them into the pan.

Mechanically speaking, these potatoes were pretty good. Like other reviewers, however, I found them mighty bland. I will probably make them again, but they're so ho-hum that I'll use low fat cheese (won't notice the difference) and lots of savory herbs that will build a more robust flavor like rosemary and thyme. 

Also, I made this in my slow cooker (high, 4 hours), and I wish I'd known beforehand that cheese doesn't do so well in a slow cooker. It separates into a kind of greasy goo, but it's not altogether bad at all! :)

I went thru other reviews and I just do not understand why I seem to be the only one who's potatoes scorched in my pan!  I believe the temp of 400 must be too hot.  My range is brand new, and everything else I have been baking seems just fine - nothing is over or underbaked.  If it weren't for the fact I believe the temp is too high, I would have given this 5 stars because after I took the potatoes what did not harden on the bottom of the pan out, it was tasty.

These were great! I did make some changes based on what I had on hand - I used about 10 red potatoes, sliced to about 1/4 inch thick. I did saute about a tsp of garlic with 3/4 of an onion with a little bit of olive oil. I tossed this and some sea salt with the potatoes in the casserole. For the sauce, I used 2 cups heavy cream (naughty, I know), and 1 cup fat free milk, mixed that in with the roux, then added grated Monterey Jack cheese and quite a bit of black pepper. I cooked covered for 1 hr 15 minutes, then uncovered for 15 more. Fantastic! So, so creamy and delicious - delicate flavor, so maybe not for those looking for something bold...

EXTRA SHARP CHEDDAR!!!!!!!!!!!  You have to use extra sharp.  For those of you saying that "something" was missing - I bet you used mild cheddar.  Cabot's extra sharp white cheddar is awsome in this (& any cheese sauce, mac-n-cheese, etc.) and it's cheaper per ounce than Walmart brand.  I too diced the onions so my family wouldn't complain.  Also added parsley, a few shakes of nutmeg, and smoked paprika.  Great recipe.

Yum - comfort food!  The only thing I changed was to dice the onions instead of slicing them.  They were excellent alongside grilled, smoked sausage and are perfect for leftovers.

I made these for our Mother's Day dinner (10 people), and they were a BIG hit. Everyone loved them and it was enough for all of them. I dig add crumbled bacon on top for a little extra crunch and flavor. I did as other reviewers suggested and uncovered for the last 1/2 hour of baking for a crispy top....soooo yummy!

So very yummy!  Only change I made was removing the aluminum during the last 1/2 hr so the top layer of potatoes/cheese would brown.

Just as good as the reviews suggested!  Very easy to make, even for the cooking challenged such as myself.  For added flavor I include garlic powder and we ommit the onions as my husband doesn't care for them.  You can also make this by not adding the cheese to the milk mixture and instead layering the cheese, milk mixture and potatoes in the casserole dish.  I end with a layer of cheese.  I also remove the cover for the last 1/2 hour to get a nicely browned top.  This dish was a big hit with my picky kids and even pickier husband.

So easy and delicious.  I like the simple ingredients.  Served for Easter dinner and had to make copies of the recipe to share with my guests.

I doubled this recipe for our Easter dinner and it was a hit. The only thing I did differently was to add some Swiss and Parmesan cheese along with the sharp Cheddar, since I only had about 1 c. of the Cheddar. All together I had about 2 c. of grated cheese and that seems like plenty. I added garlic powder to the sauce and next time I think I'll do the minced garlic as other reviewers have suggested. It really gave the sauce a great flavor. I'd also chop the onion next time rather than leave it sliced. Just easier to eat I think. I made this the night before Easter and then took it out of the fridge in the morning and let it come to room temp. At dinner time I reheated in my oven for about 40 min. at 325F. It was perfect! Thanks for a keeper!

This recipe was delicious!  I took the advice from previous reviews and chopped my onion into small pieces and sautee'd the onion, plus a little minced garlic, before layering with potatoe slices.  Also, in the last 5 minutes of cooking, I added some grated cheddar to the top of the potatoes!

This is a great base recipe. I did make a few changes though. I boiled the potatoes before so I could cut the oven time down to 30-40 minutes. I also only used 1/2 an onion and sauteed it in the butter then followed the recipe except I added pepper. I then put half the mixture over the first layer and the rest over the second layer. I then put some shredded cheese on top and took the foil off for the last 5 or 10 minutes to brown it. My kids loved it and they are picky eaters.

I found this dish to be very bland.  I sauted the onions with garlic in some olive oil and then added them to the dish.  The only thing that helped was the use of bread crums on top for the final uncovered 15mins.  I even tried putting in more pepper and salt to liven it up.  It needs something else, to bring out the cheese more.

I followed this recipe pretty closely, but added dashes of paprika and garlic powder.  I also added a pinch of grated nutmeg and increased the cheese to two cups.  It was okay, but not as good as I hoped.  It was king of bland, as others have said.  I think next time I will increase the salt and the cheese. Unlike some others, I thought the amount of sauce made by this recipe was perfect.

This is the second time I've made this, and both times I found it to be a bit bland, though I think the blandness comes from my own fear of over-salting the dish. But after salting on plate, we all liked these potatoes.

My husband said this was the best way he's ever had potatoes.  This recipe was so simple, I will definitely make it again. I disagree with others that it was bland. There is nothing bland about that cheese sauce - yum!  I inserted vertical sprigs of thyme to garnish

This was a pretty good recipe. I made it for a church dinner and it went over pretty well. What I changed, reduced the butter and flour to 2 Tbsp each, reduced the cheese to 1 cup and added some spices to the uncooked potato slices to add some flavor since it was lacking some the first time I made it. I also kept the peels on and lightly broiled the tops after cooking to make it more presentable. With these changes it was a 5 star recipe. Thanks for sharing!

This was awesome! I used velveeta because that's what I had on hand. Also added leftover cubed ham. Made a great dinner. Because of time constraints, I started this in the microwave, then finished in the oven. The leftovers were great the next day.

Great delicious recipe.  I hate boxed au gratin potatoes but these were delicious.  And easy.  Followed recipe exactly except did not cook the full hour and half because of time constraints - I cut the cook time by 30 minutes and I took the foil off and broiled for a few minutes until top was lightly browned and they tasted great.  Thanks for the recipe.

Perfect.  Don't change a thing.  I've used the cheese sauce on steamed veggies too.  Try it!  We've changed the name to "old rotten potatoes" but only as a joke.  They're a weekly fav!!

I used half the potatoes for a super-saucy recipe. This is exactly what I was hoping for when I went searching for an au gratin recipe. Excellent.

Yum! Instead of onions, I used 1 tsp onion powder and one tsp of garlic powder. I used a mixture of mozerrella, jack and cheddar cheeses and topped it with cheddar for a crust. Very, very good recipe. Tastes like the au gratin at Morton's.

*Excellent recipe!*  I modified it just a bit:
- Made the recipe for 10 servings and used a 9x13" pan.
- Sliced potatoes into 1/8" thick slices.
- I did not use onions (my family doesn't like them).
- I made 2 layers and sprinkled salt, pepper and onion powder generously on each layer then added cheese mixture.
- Used Velveeta for 1/4 of the cheese (this made it creamier).
- Cooked for 1 hour, removed foil, stirred.
- Added shredded cheddar cheese on top and returned to oven for another 20 minutes until cheese on top browned. 
This was *PERFECT!*

Great easy idea but overall I didn't care for this. The potatoes were way too thick at 1/4" and there was not enough cheese in the sauce. I'd try again using very thin slices of potatoes and using at least 2 cups of cheese in the sauce.

..as is, this is a little bland and raw tasting?... The second time I made this I sauteed my onion with garlic in butter before layering and used at least 3 cups of sharp cheddar cheese in the sauce with a pinch of cayenne (EXCELLENT SAUCE) and also layered with more cheese (aprox 1 cup) and topped with MORE cheese. This baked up beautifully and didn't look as anemic as it did the first time...my hubby loved this one...:)

I wish I would have read the reviews like I usually do before making these. I would definitely double the sauce, and add some spices (garlic, paprika, whatever). They were just good, nothing special, for me.

I use a swiss cheese sometimes instead of cheddar.  Either way very good, but be generous with the onions!

These were really good! I added some nutmeg to the rue and used cheddar and monterey jack cheese. Take the cover off for the last 1/2 hour to brown.  I will defintely make these again!

Made this recipe as a side dish for our Thanksgiving family dinner for the first time... and it was delicious.  The consistency of the sauce was thicker than I wanted so I may add more milk, or less flour next time.  I also added garlic, and garlic salt for more  flavor.  I'd definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

These potatoes were absolutely wonderful.  I added 1/4 tsp. crushed garlic to the butter when making the white sauce, and only 1/2 a small onion cut into slices for the onion layer.  The edges were very brown, though- next time I might try a lower temperature, or check more frequently for doneness.  Still, this is my new favorite potato recipe.  Thanks!

This is the first recipe that I have tried from this site and it came out very good.  I can also see a lot of potential with this recipe such as using a blend of different cheeses, adding pieces of diced ham, etc, so I will never get bored with this recipe.  The only thing that I will do differently next time is to decrease the cooking time from 1 1/2 hours to 1 hour so the potatoes don't get to soft.  And instead of using 1 1/2 cups of shredded cheese, I used 2 cups.  Hey, what can I say? I love cheese.

This is an excelent base recipe.  You can combine any sort of extra ingredients and cheeses to make this dish over and over without it getting old.  Use swiss and add steak and mushrooms for Philly cheese steak potatoes; or bacon and ham w/ sharp cheddar (the favorite at home), even some breakfast sausage, scrambled eggs and bacon for a breakfast dish.  I have friends beg me to invite them over whenever I make them.  They're a winner in my book.

This recipe is the best!  I chopped the onions  instead of making them into rings, and cooked it uncovered at 350 for 45 minutes, then took it out, put a topping of melted butter, breadcrumbs, and Parmasan cheese on, then put it back in for 30 min.  It was perfect that way.

OUTSTANDING. I made these last night with BBQ chicken and they were wonderful. I did not use any onions, but added some onion powder and a little garlic salt to the roux. Also, a tip on the potatoes: they need to be sliced very thin. Not quite paper thin, but think about how thin the potatoes in boxed mixes are...that should give an idea. Also, cooked these at 350 not 400 and they still got just a little bit brown on the bottom (not a big deal). I added a little more grated cheddar combined with Italian bread crumbs to the top when they were done and let the cheese brown under the broiler for about 4 minutes. Highly recommend this recipe.

Very good. Made these to go with grilled pork tenderloin when having company. Everyone went back for seconds and some for thirds. I did bake at 350 and uncover the last 30 mins to brown as some had suggested and salt and peppered each layer of potatoes. My guests all agreed - keeper.

I used sharp cheddar and skim milk.  The taste was excellent.  I would definitely make it again with the following revisions:
I would chop the onion, remove the foil for the last 15 minutes of baking to get that golden look on top, and I would either bake at a lower temp or bake on a cookie sheet because the bottom of the potatoes were burned.

Mmm. Mmm. Good.  When I made this I did make some changes.  First no onions, they don't fly with some around here especially a whole one sliced.  Second I used sharpe cheddar which I think added depth of flavor and third I added a buttery crackerbutter crunchy topping.  And everyone said mmm, mmm, good.

The taste was good but I don't know what I did wrong...added the milk slowly but once I cooked this in the oven it separated & curdled & was watery.  My son wouldn't even try it but my husband said although it looked awful, it tasted pretty good.  It needed some seasoning so I added season salt & a little paprika in addition to the salt/pepper/onion.

This cheese sauce is quite easy to make, I was apprehensive about cooking milk on the stove.  I have a tendency to boil it over!  Anyhow, my personal preference is for a cheesier sauce, so next time I will add more cheese than the recipe calls for.  I also recommend saucing the bottom of the dish instead of butter, I had a burned layer on the bottom.  And finally, I doubled the potatoes, but made the sauce per the recipe and still had enough sauce for the whole dish.  Very good!!  Easter update:  I made this again, this time I used Crisco on the bottom of the pan, which worked better than butter.  We also added minced garlic, salt and pepper to each layer of potato and onion before saucing and it was even better than the last time!

Delicious!  I made these for the first time for company for Christmas Eve dinner and I was hoping they would be good.  They exceeded all of my expectations!  I used 4 different types of cheese - yellow & white american, cheddar, monterey jack, and mozzarella (I was using up little bits of leftovers).  I sprinkled a little of the cheese on top.  I also had to remove the foil and bake for another 1/2 hour to brown the top, but by that time the bottom came out a little burnt - so I would recommend taking off the foil after baking for 1 hour.  Overall an outstanding recipe!

Great Recipe, easy prep too!  I used frozen chopped onion because I hate to chop onion, I also added diced ham that was left over from a spiral sliced ham, it was an excellent meal!  Just added a fresh salad and a loaf of hot french bread.  I also took the foil off for the last 10 minutes to brown the top layer.

Great dish.  The only adjustment I made was to add 1/4 cup cubed Velveeta cheese to the flour/milk/shredded cheese mix.  The Velveeta seemed to make it much creamier and provided more of the cheese sauce.

I love the recipe as is.  I have been making CathyM's version for the last few years.  In fact, it is in the oven right now.  My favorite is the very bottom pieces where the cheese gets browned!  I made this one time without onions because I was out, and I didn't think my husband would notice.  Boy was I wrong!  I will never alter anything in this recipe again!

This was my first time making au gratin potatoes, and they turned out very tasty!  I doubled the recipe, and used 2 9x13 glass dishes.  I sauted the onions in butter & garlic before layering.  To my surprise they cooked very fast, 50 min!  The cheese sauce was to die for!  I highly recommend these to everyone.  Thanks Cathy!

I made this for my husband, who said that it was the best potatoes he'd ever eaten. I then made it for my brother-in-law (who doesn't each very much potatoes) and his family, and he LOVED them.

This recipe was ok, a bit bland.  I will make it again, but add my own spin to it by using different seasonings & cheeses.

I served this for Christmas Dinner with Ham and everyone asked for the salt, it was pretty bland. However the next day we ate the leftovers and I sprinkled Garlic Salt on them and they were much better. Not a bad recipe, just needs more seasoning.

This a great recipie to start from. But it does need some improvement. Try changing the milk into heavy whipping cream and adding 8 oz of velveeta cheese. You can also add 1/2 cup of sour cream more, and cubeing the potatos. After these small changes it is a superb meal!

This an excellent recipe, and so easy, it was a big hit at my table, i just added a couple of slices of onion instead of a whole oinion. This is a keeper at my house and even shared it with my friends!

I really enjoyed this receipe.  I substituted with fat-free butter and skim milk to cut down in fat.  I would suggest adding a tad more salt and some minced garlic.

Good although I thought it needed more salt. I diced onions instead of rings.  I read other reviews that suggested garlic powder so added that; maybe next time I make this I will add garlic salt instead of garlic powder...

This recipe was wonderful!  I'm ashamed to say that I've always used the 'box' for au gratin potatoes.  This recipe is heaven.  The ONLY thing I did a little different is that I browned the flour and butter (to make a dark golden roux) a little longer than called for.  I do that also with my homemade mac/n/cheese.  This recipe is definately a keeper, thank you!

This is a great recipe, if you like onions. I have been making a dish similar to this for years, substituting broccoli for the onions! To make this dish (similar) and even quicker, try STEAMING the potatoes and broccoli (or onions, or both)and pouring the sauce over it. And, as always, I add more cheese. I found that EXTRA SHARP cheddar is excellent. I make this for family and they always rave.

THIS IS SO GOOD!  A must make- well worth the effort (which is minimal).  This is the absolute best cheese sauce.  I used shredded sharp cheese and it was delicious.  I WILL make it again and again.  I only baked it for a little over an hour and put slices of ham between the potato layers.  Great meal!

Because I needed it done faster than an hour and a half, I par boiled the potatoes.   When melting the butter, I put my onions in that.   Then continue making the cheese sauce the same way.    I put about half the potatoes down, then layer of cheese/onion sauce, then potatoes then the rest of the cheese sauce.    Only had to cook about 35 minutes in the oven - no foil so the top gets nice and brown.

Overall a great recipe. I read the reviews (always!) for different tips. I added cayenne pepper, used sharp cheddar and smoked Gouda. Also added a pinch of celery salt. I took the tip from others by microwaving the potatoes a bit so it wouldn’t take so long to cook and to avoid the sticking. Will definitely use this again but will add some bacon and chives.

Frozen onions can be used when you want to save time. Make sure to not let the sauce thicken too much before pouring it over the potatoes and onions. Definitely cover the potatoes in tin foil so they won’t dry out!

Love this recipe. Added a few things. Added garlic and used 1 1/2 times the cheese. Wise to either put half the potatoes and onions in dish then pour half the sauce on and repeat or do as the original recipe says but tap dish on the counter top as you would cake batter before placing in the oven, this allows the sauce to settle evenly between the potatoes. I used aluminum pans and in place of the oven I used my smoker. It maintained a temp of 250 and the potatoes cooked perfectly in three hours with rest of the meal. Hint of smoke flavor added to the delicious recipe and was enjoyed by all.

It was very easy to make. The potatoes were soft way before the 1 1/2 hours. Maybe I just sliced them thinner. After 1 hour and 15 minutes, I took the foil off and used broil to get the top a little brown. Instead of cheddar cheese, I used Colby/Jack. This recipe will definitely be one of my favorites.

Make all the alterations you want. I'm a garlic and black pepper freak. Or just follow the recipe and enjoy cheesy, flavorful, cheesy, moist , cheesy, tasty, cheesy potatoes not from a box. And really, they're quite... uhhhm… what's the word... oh, cheesy! (buy a good, sharp cheddar for this recipe)

Great base recipe!  I omitted the onions, and used half mild cheddar and half sharp cheddar.  I did not use butter on the bottom of the pan,  thinking that cooking spray would suffice , but that only made the bottom layer brown up and I lost about 20 % of the potatoes in the crust that resulted.  I will be trying this again with herb and garlic seasoning and different cheeses, however, this recipe is great as it is!

This was a massive hit and something everyone always asks for. Since my daughter doesn't like onions (that she can see lol) I sauteed the onions and sprinkled them over each layer. I also salted, peppered, and put a sprinkle of paprika on each layer. I also topped with cheese and baked uncovered for the last 20 mins. I was one of the best comfort foods I have ever eaten!!!!

This is a family favorite that I make for holidays.  It is so simple and delicious!  I found a bag of mixed shredded cheddar (added 2 bags) and use Yukon Gold potatoes.  So yummy and creamy!

I make this for every holiday and it's always a hit. I chop the onion and I double the cheese sauce. Make sure to use good quality cheese. It makes all the difference.

Very good potatoes. I’ve made this dish several times and it’s always delicious. Minced, dried onions works in a pinch, too. I will be making this on Easter Sunday.

I made this recipe this past weekend.  They were delicious. I did chop up the onions and saute them a little bit before layering them in the potatoes. I was a bit generous with the cheese and used a larger casserole dish. They turned out great!   I think they could have used a little bit more cooking time so make sure you plan for that.

Followed recipe exactly and 4 medium size potatoes  barely fit into 1 1/2 qt vintage  oblong casserole  dish.  Next time I will remove foil half way thru cooking time as we liked it browned on top and use a higher sided baking dish.

Delicious! Easy. Ingredients and amounts are perfect,; very glad I found this recipe. If you don't have 90 minutes to bake, just boil the potatoes for 10 minutes before doing the rest of the recipe, and you only need to bake them until they are bubbly. They actually turned out more creamy when I boiled them as opposed to the time I followed the instructions exactly.

Took the foil off the top and there was a bunch of oil sitting on top of the potatoes, I'm guessing from cheap cheese.  

Next time I do this I'll look for some better cheese to use

Excellent taste!  I agree with the recommendation to chop up the onion if you don't want to deal with thick wet rings while sinking your teeth into the cheesy potato slices.

I used 4 russets and used a mandolin to cut them very thin and layered them.  I used what I had on hand.  I did not have any fresh onion so I used sliced dried onion. I used Mexican cheese blend and half and half instead of milk using the same measurements. Make sure you use enough salt which I have a tendency not to use enough. I thought these came out great. Will make again.

This was a great recipe, but a little bland.  Some changes I would make next time: add more cheese to the sauce, it wasn't cheesy enough. After baking, add another lay of cheese and broil it.  Saute the onions first, and add some bacon and possibly chives.

Excellent base recipe! Sticks to the basics and doesn't get overly fancy. Love the roux and béchamel base for the cheese sauce, can't go wrong with the staples.

Though I altered this recipe a bit I think it looks fine as written as well. I omit onion entirely, season my béchamel with salt, pepper, white pepper (and have experimented with a dash of nutmeg) and layer the potatoes with the sauce (seasoning the raw potatoes with salt, pepper and paprika as I go) then top with cheese.

This recipe lends itself well to modification, definitely one of my go-to's from now on.

This is a great recipe!  I did make some changes though.  First I used a 9x13 dish because my 2 qt. was in the wash.  I also used onion powder instead of onions and added garlic powder.  I followed the other reviewer's advice and did 1 1/2 times the sauce.  Lastly, I uncovered the dish for the last five minutes to get some brown on top.  We loved this recipe and I'll definitely make it again!

Simply put, THIS IS SOOO GOOD!! I have a wonderful neighbor who brings us fresh produce, and we ended up with an abundance of potatoes. I didn't want them to go to waste and thought "hey, I've never made au gratin potatoes" and this was the PERFECT recipe!! All simple ingredients I already had on hand, and was really easy to make. SO YUMMY!! This is definitely going into the regular rotation!

I have made this recipe three times.  Here is what I recommend:  Saute the onions with a single small clove of garlic as it adds a depth of flavor; add a drip pan and lower the heat to void ending up with burnt/crusty nonsense on all the edges/bottom; slice the potatoes as thin as you can (a cut like a mandolin or food processor blade slicer is what you are looking for).

Lots of others have recommended more cheese, but if you use sharp or extra sharp cheddar you are fine.  Some store-brand cheeses have lots of grease in them, so beware.  Throw in any other old non-italian cheeses that you have in the refrigerator if you want creaminess/pull-apart goodness.  

I also made this with a crock pot with nearly equal result - but it took about 5 hours on high with my admittedly ancient crock pot - so be sure to give yourself plenty of leeway in terms of time.

Finally found a potato recipe to rival my mom’s! Easy and delicious, this is a keeper. I did as another reviewer, and sautéed onions in butter prior to assembling. Looking forward to trying again with different cheeses!

This was so good.  I doubled the recipe, like other reviewers I sauteed the onions, added more cheese and cheese on top after baking for an hour and a half.  Then I added fried onions that you put on green bean casserole.  Everyone loved that. Will definitely make again

I made this recipe based on Emily 91183's review. Excellent! I did use about 2 tablespoons of diced onion for a little more flavor, and per Emily's suggestion increased the cheese sauce by about half, then doubled the cheese. Probably should have added a little more salt, but husband is on a salt restricted diet. This will be my au gratin potato recipe going forward.

The recipe would stand well on it's own but I was looking for a dinner I could use my left over ham in, so I added about 2 cups in the layers. I also added extra cheese on top the last ten minutes with green onion for  garnish. It disappeared and there were only three of us. Will for sure make again. Maybe as a side next time we smoke another ham.

My family loved this dish. It's time for me to go grocery shopping and I had to do multiple milk substitute because I was out of milk. I used 1/2 cup of almond milk, 1/2 cup of coconut milk, 1 cup of half & half and finally a cup of chicken broth. Then I realized that I was out shredded cheese so I substituted the cheese with grated romano cheese. It turned out excellent.

This turned out really good.  The only changes I made was to take the foil off with about 30 minutes to go, and I cooked it longer (probably an hour and 45 minutes to 2 hours) until the tops of the potatoes were browning.  I will definitely make it again.

I made these for the first time tonight and followed the recipe exactly after watching the video.  It was a very easy recipe to follow and make, and all basic ingredients I had on hand. They turned out perfect!  I thought the sliced onions might be a little stringy, but they were creamy soft and melted right into the potatoes. In fact my grandaughter, who hates onions, had two helpings and found an onion in her last bite.  I baked them ahead of time and left them covered with  foil and ate them about 30 minutes later when the rest of dinner was ready.  I think this gave them time to set and continue to cook.  Will definitely be making them again without any changes except for maybe a sprinkling of crispy bacon crumbled on top.

I didn't have an hour and a half to bake, so I boiled water and soaked the sliced potatoes for a few minutes.  (used a mandoline for slicing)Then I drained and put in the casserole dish. I just put everything in, and didn't even stir. Baked for 30 minutes and they came out great. I also didn't use a whole onion, and I cut very thin and diced.

The first time I made this I followed it exactly and pretty much as I feared the raw onion did not cook through and leaked quite a bit of liquid which sort of split the sauce around it.   Tasted nice just the same but not great looking.   The second time I thinly sliced the onions and caramelized them by cooking them in butter low and slow.   This took maybe 45 mins to get that rich brown sweet onion taste but I started them first and by the time I peeled and sliced the potatoes and made the cheese sauce I only had to wait a little while to get the onions right.   You can cook them less and it works but I just love the caramelized onions and it makes it worth the time.  Like other reviewers I find it works better to layer the potatoes and sauce as this helps stop the potato starch making the potatoes stick together.   This is a really good basic recipe that only a few small tweaks turns into a more flavorful rich yummy dish.

This was my second try at this recipe. The first time I made it as written and didn't care for the large pieces of onion and thought it was bland. I took the advice of other reviewers this time around and minced half of a small sized onion instead of cutting it into rings. I used a mandolin to slice the potatoes and sprinkled a little salt, pepper, and minced onion between every layer. I used half of a cheddar/colby blend and half of a mozzarella/provalone blend of pre-shredded cheese because I had those left over in the fridge. I also added a little nutmeg to the finished cheese sauce before pouring over the potatoes. I took the foil off the last 10 minutes of baking so the top would brown nicely. I really liked this dish with my changes and will definitely make it again. It gets 4 stars instead of 5 because the recipe as is wasn't enough seasoning for me and I didn't like the large rings of onion. Also, the recipe says to make this in a 1qt dish, but 4 potatoes plus the amount of sauce the recipe called for filled my 2qt rectangular dish to the top.

This is great as written. Second time I did change it up a bit. I made the sauce and and added 1//2 tsp dried mustard and 1/2 hot sauce. I did not put the cheese in the sauce. I put a layer of potatoes in the dish, poured 1/3 of the sauce over it and put 1/2 of the cheese on top. Then another layer of potatoes etc. Repeated 2 more times. Uncovered the last 30 minutes for a brown crust.

I rate this four stars because I found the seasoning to be severely lacking. This needs major help of salt and pepper. I do think the portion of cheese sauce to potatoes to be good even though others have said more is needed. It has a good amount and consistency was great! I did spray my glass pan with pam and would recommend doing a butter instead because mine turned out a bit greasy. I blame the pam not the recipe. Worth a try but be prepared to season season season.

These are the perfect Au Gratin potatoes.  And so quick and easy to make.

I layered onion on only half of my potatoes, and with or without them these were absolutely delicious.  Unfortunately I did not have any leftovers to enjoy for tomorrow's lunch.  I am making them again for Easter dinner and I know to make more than necessary.

I made this tonight as a trial run for Easter.  It was pretty good but like others have said I'll definitely chop the onion next time.  Probably use less too...and I love onion but it just seems like it doesn't quite go with this flavor.  I'll  probably throw some garlic in too.

Have been making these for years.  Great recipe.  I always double it for company and add a teaspoon of dry mustard.  This time I partially cooked the potatoes and onions in the microwave for three (3) minutes before adding the cheese sauce, to ensure their tenderness.  I also add another cup of shredded cheddar to the top about 20 minutes before done.

It was a big hit, but I modified the technique like some others did. I cut the onion rings in half so they would spread more evenly and be easier to eat. I also sprinkled cheese as I  layered, potatoes,onions,cheese. Made sauce as directed and baked. I plan to make more often because it was easy to do and everyone loved it!

Took the cover off to brown the top of the cheese the last 15-30minutes.  Used green onion instead of regular and was absolutely delicious! Smells so good while it's cooking in the oven!

I loved it!!! Very good and very easy to make! Will definitely make it again. I added a few more potatoes since I wanted to use up me potatoes. However, I wasn't sure how much more cheese or milk to add. I added another 1/2 cup of milk and almost two cups of cheese. Came out great!

Oh My Goodness... A-Mazing. 1st time making potatoes of this kind and I'm overjoyed. This kicks the back-end off supermarket versions. It's Fantastic! Tender potatoes, yummy sauce. I only added a bit of nutmeg and all-purpose seasoning to the sauce because of my own tastes and diced the onions as others recommended. I will never buy shop-bought ready ones again. This is also a fraction of the price. Cathy M, Thank You so much - you are the Gratin Queen!! :)

i made this exactly as written, with the onions.    But i let it sit on the warm stove top for about 2 hours before serving. and it was perfect consistency, the onions had basically dissolved into the dish giving the perfect flavor

Made this with New Year's Eve ham.  Chopped the onion instead of rings. My husband loved it! He did ask to omit the onions next time however, which I found odd coming from an onion lover. Go figure LOL. Will try different cheeses next time too. Thanks for sharing!

Very simple and very tasty.  I used onion flakes and added more cheese and it was well received by guests.  I served with smoked BBQ ribs and salad.  Family all loved it as well.  I took foil off top and broiled last 10 minutes to get some crisp on the top.

Cook at 350/ 400 is too hot. Cover with tinfoil for the first 30 minutes, then uncover for the rest. Check often after the hour mark to check and see if it is done.

I've made this many times over the last 10 years, but for 12-14 people:  I use 42 oz peeled russet potatoes (12-14 small-medium) 14 oz Vidalia onions (about 1 1/2 medium) and 14 oz Dubliner cheese (Two 7-oz packages), and double the remaining ingredients.  (Note the 3-1-1 ratio by weight) A batch of this size is about as much as you can make in a 2 1/2 quart sauce pan.  You'll need a bigger pan for baking too, of course.  I use a 6-quart dutch oven with plenty of room to spare.  Working alone it takes me more like 60 minutes to prepare, not 30.

Outrageously awesome. This is heaven in a dish. I see a lot of complaints about the potatoes not cooking. I have a fix....When i get a bag of potatoes, i boil half of them with skin on, cool, store in refrig. They stay good in a large baggie for weeks! Using these precooked potatoes, the cooking time was 35 minutes. I used  smoked cheese  for part of the cheddar and topped with crispy, double smoked bacon bits

I've made this several times and it's  always a hit!  It's starting to become my "signature" dish! This time I'm quadrupling the recipe! I want plenty of leftovers. I do add a pinch of nutmeg to the cheese sauce and a little garlic powder too.

I thought this recipe was wonderful. I layered the potatoes with slices of ham rather than onion to make a one dish meal. I did add a little more cheese to the roux because my husband loves cheese! I also added some garlic... again hubby's favorite. I only changed the recipe to what I know my husband loves. Awesome and easy recipe. Thanks for sharing it!!

Yum, Yum.  So good and so easy.  The only change I made was to use some dried minced onion instead of the fresh onions. I also sprinkled some onion powder and garlic powder on each layer of the  potatoes.  Could not stop eating this.  Cannot wait to make again.

I had a little trouble figuring out the right ratio of potatoes to liquid.  I ended up only using about 2/3 of the milk/cheese and even then it was really soupy. Once it cooled though, it thickened up and tasted good.  If I make this again, I will try using a more quality cheese. I used store brand shredded cheddar and found the finished product to be just okay.

Excellent recipe..I saw previous reviews and sliced potatoes about 1/8" thick, that solved the undercooked review. used red onions...but not a whole onion...come on now!!! Add onion to your liking  in the center layer. And added thinly sliced ham in the center and on top before adding cheese sauce. I must say...one of the best dishes I've ever made!! Its a meal on its own. My wife thinks I'm a better cook than her now! One other thing is I used extra sharp cheddar freshly grated...I think that resolved the "bland" taste that someone else said on here. Let me know what you guys think! ENJOY!!!

I made this and it was delicious but it needs a little modification.. I made it with 1 cup of milk and 1 cup of cream.  Also, the onions are alright but just make sure you do not too much. Just a couple of slices on each layer is fine.. And don't forget the nutmeg.. It made all the difference in the world.. And be generous with salt and pepper

It was great, I did make some changes only due to the ingredients I had  in the house.   I used some grated swiss and some cheddar.  ( grated both of them in my food processor . I used red potatoes.  ( just got a new food processor and love  using it)  I put in  1 cup of raw spinach.   I sauted my very finely chopped onion and one clove of minced garlic.  just for about a minute.    I then followed the instructions. (my mom who was a great cook told me to grate the onion for scalloped potatoes.   (I did chop them very fine) Sorry Mom.  I must say a one quart casserole would be way too small.  I used a two quart and didn't worry about it overflowing.   I'm sure  if you follow the recipe it would be great, just more salt  and pepper and garlic.  MY DH loved it.  I served it with a spinach salad and grilled pork chops, and spiced peach's.   I have to admit, it was spectacular.   Try it.

Now I made these a second time .  This time for company and a Christmas dinner.  They were bad.  But, not the recipes  fault.  I doubled the recipe.  The problem was, I believe, were the potatoes I used.  I used Russet, but   they were not good russets.  I  made mashed potatoes with them  a few days  before  and when I mashed them they were real soft without  adding any liquid .  I think these potatoes held a lot of water in them  ( I drained then really good) and because of this my  Creamy Au Gratin were very soupy and the flavor was not good.  I did use very good SHARP Cheddar as I always do,

Delicious. A few things I changed, though. I sliced the potatoes as directed (I used about seven medium sized red skin potatoes) then I boiled them for about seven minutes to get them going. After boiling, I drained them and followed directions, except for the cheese. I didn't have cheddar so I used 2 cups of Velveeta, cubed and melted. I mixed in the potatoes and tossed in the oven for 20 minutes on 400 degrees to get that nice browned crust on top. My 3-year old had three servings (without bribing!).

Best potatoes ever! Made at least four times. I always double it. Only difference is I use only half of the onion called for, and saute in a little butter until translucent. Sometimes I use a little heavy cream as part of the milk measurement. I remove the foil for the last 30 minutes to allow the top to get a little more brown. I use coarse ground black pepper and add a dash of cayenne for just a little more zip. Always delicious!

Love this recipe! I sauté the onions in Olive oil first before layering between potatoes. I also like to remove foil at the end to ensure a browned top.

Very flavorful and definitely better than the boxed stuff.  I have made this twice and have found a 1 qt. casserole to be way too small,  There is no detail on how many pounds of potatoes to use but the size of 4 russet potatoes could vary greatly.  I used only 3  with chopped onion and the potatoes ended up piling higher than the top of the pan.  Trying to pour the cheese sauce over was a disaster and there was way more sauce than would fit in the pan.  I dumped it all into a 2 qt. casserole & mixed it around. Baked covered for 1 hr, 10 mins, then uncovered for 20 mins.  Wasn't brown enough for me so I stuck it under the broiler for a couple minutes,  i did find that both times I made this, the sauce stuck to the bottom of the pan & became brown and crusty.  If you can manage to scrape that crispy crust off when you are serving the potatoes, it is delicious. Recommend it and will make again.

These are very good, but very time consuming.  I opted to chop the onion as opposed to slicing into rings and I mixed the onions into the sliced potatoes as opposed to layering it all in the middle.  I also increased the cheese to two cups.  Very good and very well received.  Thanks for sharing, CathyM!

This is a very good and easy recipe as is. The first time I followed it exactly. The 2nd time I added a couple of dashes of cayenne pepper to jazz it up and added a layer of onion on top of the potatoes before the layer of sauce. Sprinkled paprika on top. Uncovered for the last 20 min. You may want to double the sauce.

This is BY FAR the best  Au Gratin  recipe out there...I followed others advice and  did 2 layers of potatoes and added sauce on each  layer.  I added 1/2 cup more cheese to sauce and  did another 1/2  recipe of sauce ingredients. This is a must..made a huge difference!

I followed the recipe as written and it was outstanding. My 18 yr old granddaughter, who hates onions, loved it and said, she loved them in this! Sometimes I par cook the potatoes if I'm rushed for time.

It was ok, kind of bland.  I added leftover ham so it did give it some extra flavor.  I will try it again and spice it up a bit.

Very tasty!! I intended to cut down the cooking time since I had a hungry toddler. I steamed the potatoes for 8 minutes and then put it in the 350 oven for 25 minutes, then broil for 4 minutes. It came out fine. I also added an extra teaspoon of flour to thicken the sauce, and use less milk (only 2.5 cups). My picky eater daughter loved it and kept asking for more. Thank you!!

Used what I had in my fridge.  In addition to regular potatoes, I sliced two yams.  And instead of regular milk, I used 1.5 C soy milk and .5 C labne.  Talk about comfort food!  Yum yum.

I lived in France and orignally wanted a French au gratin recipe, but I decided to go with this American version, which is a Midwestern standard.  I used an extra sharp Wisconsin cheddar.  It seemed to be a big hit during this year's Christmas dinner.  A great traditional side dish

Great, simple recipe. Don't be afraid to put different cheeses in along with the cheddar. We like it with 1/3 goat cheese; gives a great tang.

I made these potatoes a few days ago for a dinner party. I've made lots of cheesy potato dishes, but this is now my favorite. Everybody loved them. I offered to give them the recipe, but they said they like it better when I make the potatoes. They were yummy &hI enjoyed every minute of making them.

I have made this recipe several times. It is a family favorite. Usually I double the recipe, preparing one half as written but divided into two portions one I doubled the cheese, diced and sauted the onion and added a couple of dashes of ground red pepper. The other half I doubled the cheese again but half of the cheese I replaced with Gruyere and added Herbs d'Provence. Could use thyme.

This is quite nice; my partner really loves it, and he's definitely a potato man.  I slice our potatoes really fine and pop them in the steamer for a few minutes, first, but otherwise follow the recipe pretty closely.  It's a favorite, for us.

Followed the recipe plus did the following:  Add extra cheese plus cayenne for flavor to the cheese sauce.  Dice the onions and cook in butter before adding to dish.  Consider using 2 onions for extra flavor.

Can i just say OMG! My family loved this recipe and I'm definitely making it again.  It's rich and creamy.  I used 1% milk because that's what I normally have in fridge and it was fantastic.  I took the suggestions to chop onions instead of rings since I like a finer texture and used old and medium cheddar cheeses since I already had them.

Would give a 5 star rating but changed the onions, left them out and used  French Fried Onions on top instead. A great base recipe to experiment with!

Came out great! Grill/smoked a chicken on the big green egg. What a great side dish. I will say, adding jalapeños puts this dish on another level!

The proportions are way off here. I had to use a 5 quart casserole dish, there was no way I could have fit more than 1 potato sliced in my 1 quart. Also, I needed twice the cheese sauce, probably more.

Okay I kind of used this recipe, but added to it. 
I used my heavy steel casserole dish so instead of following quantities I layered the pot with potatoes, salt pepper and spanish onions (4 little ones slices thinly and broken apart into rings) until it was full.  I then made the sauce, using not cheddar but strong hard cheese. The quantity didn't look enough so I melted 1/3 tub Philly cream cheese in the mixture and made a smooth paste of 1Tbspn cornflower and milk, then added another cup of milk to the cornflower and added it to the pan. I poured it over the potatoes and added parmesan cheese on top.

The onions should be chopped, not sliced to add flavour without affecting the texture.  I had to use a 2 quart casserole to hold the recipe for 6 persons and it still bubbled over.  Be sure to place your casserole dish on some foil for easier clean up.  I also added the sauce intermittently as I layered the potatoes to ensure the sauce gets down to all the potatoes.  I like the idea of removing the top foil for the last 20 minutes to get some extra browning.

Loved this and my hubby did too! I made just a few changes I made the sauce in one and a half servings and layered it with the potato's and didn't use any onions. I let them cook for the 45 minutes which according to mybhubby was slightly not enough time. Then I pulledbthem out 15 minutes before they were done and added cracked pepper garlic powder and a small handfull of cheese. Smash!! 
I also used whole wheat flour but that do not hurt the taste at all :) thank you for the idea!!

I made this as written and loved it! Then I went back to read the reviews, to see what others thought. I was fine with the onion rings until I read everyone saying how slimy they were, now I think I'll be mincing mine, too, in the future. lol I had a heavy hand with the cheese and thought it was really good!! This recipe will make it to my table again, it was delish!

I have made these several times now.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly.  Now I change up the cheeses here and there depending on what I have on hand.  My family loves them.  My 14 year old son asks for them at least once a week.

I've made this recipe many times and feel the cheese type/quality is key. I use 3 cheeses that I shred by hand off a block - very sharp cheddar, smoky cheddar, and a little parmesean. Like others who have reviewed dicing the onions is a better texture than rings and try alternating the sauce and potato slices instead of adding at the end. Sometimes I blacken some smoked pork chops, cut them into pieces and add that too.  If you pull the foil off for the last 20 min the top will get a nice browning.

I tried this recipe because of Himself's fondness for a similar dish in an upscale steakhouse in our area, and he likes this even better than theirs! I used a blend of five cheeses, and the only changes I made were slicing the potatoes MUCH thinner and adding a couple cloves of grated garlic to the cheese sauce. This will be our go-to special occasion side dish!

Overall a great dish.  We like  a lot of flavor  so  depending on the  meat course, I have added  spices.  When  making  with roasted chicken  I always  add rosemary to the rue.  Awesome!

This is a great simple recipe that anyone can make. It's the perfect accompaniment to all kinds of meat. I do occasionally switch it up a bit with green onions or different cheeses - and sometimes dill, which brings out the flavors of the cheese and onion. Of course, bacon or ham is fabulous too - just chop and cook it before.

Oh my goodness!! So good! I followed the recipe pretty closely except I used about 8 red skinned potatoes instead of the russet and added a bit more cheese to the sauce. This will forever be my cheesy potato side dish of choice!

I made this for a potluck my dautr Hannah was having at work. They were so awesome! I added cheese to only half. I want to try Gerilynn's suggestion to saute onions for a few minutes first and with some garlic. I love garlic, onions and cheese. YUMMY! Gonna make these tonite with a nice picnic ham on a rainy spring evening.

I had my doubts about this recipe, thinking it was going to be bland, but it was everything I wanted it to be. I made it according to the recipe, because I think that's a good starting place for trying something new. It was creamy and delicious, without being overbearing at all. I quadrupled the recipe for our Easter dinner and it came out perfect.  Great recipe to accompany a delicious ham.

More like 3.5 stars.  It was easy to make, but it was a touch on the bland side.  I'll probably make it again, but tinker with it a bit.

I did a layer of potatoes, then onions, then large shrimp, then salt, pepper and creole seasoning, then another layer just like that.  Then I made the sauce and poured it over the top then topped it with the rest of the cheese in the bag.  Then I covered it with aluminum foil and cooked it on 375 for 1 1/2 hour.  It was a one dish wonder!!!  You can also add a layer of fresh spinach leaves to each layer to make it even more healthy or you can do a salad on the side.  AWESOME!!!

Great recipe. Only change I made was using half of an onion, and chopped instead of in rings.

Just WOW.  I made this as a side to an everyday dinner and it knocked the socks off the whole family.  I nixed the onions and added more cheddar cheese between layered potato slices. I also topped with seasoned bread crumbs.  I did take another reviewer's suggestion to microwave the slices for a few mins to cut down on bake time.  I cooked on 400 for an hour and pulled off foil for last 10 mins.  Will make again and maybe add bacon crumbles or ham.

I have made this several times and it turns out delicious every time, didn't change the recipe other than I didn't measure the cheese so I probably added more than was called for. I also remove the foil for the last 15 mins.

The texture of the cheese sauce was thick and unpleasant. I didn't expect an outrageously cheesy flavor, but this dish had no flavor at all.

Tips: saute onions and add minced garlic to onions. After adding cheese- add tablespoon of bacon grease and tablespoon real bacon bits. With these changes it comes out wonderful! I also baked in mini 1 1/2 cup pyrex dishes- cooked for 35 min at 400 with lids on! came out perfect!

I made this fior he first time for a dinner party, and everyone raved about them.  Really easy to make, and very delicious!   The recipe doubles easily,  it is a creamy delicious cheesy flavor, you just won't get from a box. A family favorite now, especially when served with baked ham.  MMM

I needed more time for these to cook all the way through...the taste was good and the recipe is simple.

Update:  I made these again for Christmas dinner but had to cook them in the crockpot due to an unfortunate oven malfunction.  Cooked for about 6 hours on high and they were just about perfect.

These were VERY good.  A bit time consuming, so probably not great to tackle on a weeknight, but definitely a great dish for the weekend!  All the family members loved it :)

My whole family loved it.  For once the cheese sauce came out very smooth and yummy.  I will definitely make it again.  One reviewer said to make extra sauce, so I did because I like things extra cheesy, but now I have a ton of sauce leftover because it was too much.  It's good, so I will use it for broccoli/pierogies/baked potatoes or something.

The dish turned out really well!! The only changes I made...

I diced up the onion instead of slicing it.
I made some extra cheese sauce.
I added bread crumbs to the top.

No need to double the cheese sauce. Pretty darn good otherwise. A nice sharp cheddar works wonders.

This is a real solid recipe. Tried it for Christmas Eve this year and it was wonderful. I doubled the recipe and sliced the potatoes thinner than a quarter inch. I also cooked it for the first hour with the foil covering it, then i removed the foil, covered the top with panko & crumbled bacon and cooked uncovered for the last half hour. Delicious!

I loved this recipe.  I made it for the first time, and it was a hit.  I substituted sharp white cheddar so that it would not be grainy, and I uncovered it and put it under the broiler for the last 5 minutes.

My family loves Au Gratin potatoes.  I don't like serving them processed foods so I'm always looking for good fresh recipes.  This one is a winner!  I followed the recipe exactly and the dish turned out perfectly!  We have it all the time.

Delicious!! I left out the onions, sautéed a little garlic in the butter before I added the flour, grated a bit of fresh nutmeg into the sauce and used sharp cheddar. Everyone loved them.

I made this twice and it was good except when I used red potatoes instead of russet it turned out better. I'm not sure exactly why but the red potatoes tasted better. So I will make again and use them. Beside from that wonderful recipe and will make again and again.

I have to say this recipe was a great start point for an amazing scalloped potatoes dish. I was a little hesitant, since i am not a big fan of scalloped potatoes. Any i have had in the past have been bland and soupy. I liked this recipe because of it's simplicity. I modified it very little.
 
I did butter the glass dish i used to baked these VERY well, the potatoes came out easily. i used an 8x11.5x2

i used 6 large red potatoes. first a layer of potatoes, that i cut a little thinner than 1/4inch. 

I did use onions, I sliced them the same way i did the potatoes, only into thinner, 1/8th inch discs. i then separated the layers of the discs and placed them in a sparse layer atop the potatoes. I used roughly 1 1/2- 2 of the four slices for this layer. I wanted the onions to just add flavor, not to play a major part of the dish. 

then another layer of potatoes, which i topped with salt and pepper

then a layer of provolone slices.

i started my layering over. Atop this i added sharp cheddar slices, not provolone.

a sauce that uses milk, WILL break and separate if you are not careful, i took my time. 

3 cups of milk, let that WARM, then add about 1/3 cup of flour to which i added a VERY healthy dose of Garlic & Herb Mrs. Dash, I let this thicken some then added 2 cups shredded Colby Jack cheese. i continued stirring til the cheese had completely melted, the sauce thickened nicely. add to the potatoes until sauce just covers them.

Mine were done in time and very tasty. Enjoy

This was a very good side dish the first night we had it, but as leftovers it was spectacular!!  I would only change one thing and that is to chop the onions and saute them before adding to the sliced potatoes.  Great suggestion to microwave the sliced potatoes for 8 minutes to cut down on baking time from JMGINGRICH.  I did that, because I had to put it in the oven with the ham and couldn't bake it at 400°.

Cooked it for Christmas dinner; used sweet vidalia onions; did not have enough milk, so used half & half.  They were outstanding.  Make sure you use a really good cheddar cheese.

Used Lactaid milk which usually makes no difference. They turned black while cooking. Took over 2 hours to cook and tasted like nothing.

I absolutely love this recipe with a few modifications. I, like others, diced my onion, and minced a couple of cloves of garlic & sauteed with the butter before adding the flour. I also added a sprinkling of thyme & dry mustard to the mix. I like my potatoes diced instead of sliced, which I added to the cheese sauce before placing in my baking dish so every little piece gets nicely coated. I topped with extra shredded cheese and paprika for color. Before serving I sprinkle with either parsley or chives. Try this recipe - you will not regret it!!

i and everyone that eats this recipe LOVES it!  I made it as the recipe called for the first time - it was great!  I changed a few things the second time and continue making it with the changes.  I dice the onions, sauté them with minced garlic and layer them with the potatoes.  i also add 1/2 cup more cheese to the sauce.   cook covered for 1 hour and uncovered for 1/2 an hour.  I've used all types of cheese with this recipe.  they're all amazeballs!!

Instead of using onions, used onion powder, and velveeta cheese which makes a creamier sauce. Layer the potatoes and then sauce.  Did not cover with tin foil as we like the crusty cheesy topping.

This is a family favourite.  I find it a lot nicer if you part boil the potatoes first and use green onions or what we call shallots in Australia.  If potatoes not part cooked it takes too long.  Don't waste time making white sauce just pour over a carton of cream.  Less prep time and no pot to wash!

This was a hit with spiral ham!  Made a lot of food and this was eaten the most!  Wanted to do something different with ham other than mashed potatoes....went great!  I followed other reviews and chopped the onion instead, added a little minced garlic with the onion in the in between layer.  Also, added almost half cheese mixture in between layers.  I covered for 1 hour then the last half hour left uncovered to brown the top!  It turned out great.  After the first hour I also stirred it a bit before uncovering and browning.  I forgot to spray the bottom like other reviewers said...wish I did...stuck a bit but helped stirring after 1 hr.  Will make again!!

I added ham to this recipe, but otherwise followed the recipe. It turned out truly amazing! It tasted like I had tons of cheese in it and heavy cream, but I used skim milk. It was so decadent!

Tried this recipe and added some velveeta slices. I wasn't sure if it would be good but my family said it's one of the best dishes they ever had with potatoes and cheese sauce. I'ts not too cheesy so you can appreciate the potato flavor as well. I will keep making this dish and get creative with bacon, ham and other additions for a change! Super easy and really good!

This dish was fantastic and so easy to make.  I doubled the sauce recipe because I wanted it really creamy and used red skinned potatoes.  I also used chopped green onions since it's what I had on hand.  Definitely cheesy and good!

We love comfort food, at my house. This definitely fit the bill! I do change it up, every time I make it. For example, sometimes, I crush up my favorite croutons and sprinkle them over the top then cook for the last 15 to 20 minutes (uncovered). Other times, I have added sliced up kielbasa, carrots, broccoli...really, any veggies I have on hand. So many variations. Delicious!

I don't like potatoes (and must be the only person on the planet who doesn't) but have FINALLY found a recipe I like! Had to use cream (as the boyfriend had thoughtfully drank up all the milk "to save it from going bad" only 30 mins before I started to cook) but if anything the recipe was tastier, albeit unhealthier. Cream makes everything taste good!!

This is one of the first if not the first time I have posted a review for a recipe. It was so Unbelievably good I couldn't help but comment. First off I almost always make a recipe exactly as written the first time. I will alter per my family's personal tastes. I used diced red onion because that is what I had and I added 1/2 C. Cheddar to my sauce. As predicted it took 2 1/2 hours to cook properly. I knew it would from experience with potatoes. I don't mind the extra time involved but next time might go with the suggestion from earlier views. Personally I think it needed a lot more salt or salt like seasonings. That is something that can be added at the table as peoples salt preference varies so much. Wonderful recipe review worthy!

This is the best I have ever had. I just made it for the second time in two months. I made it exactly as written and did the step by step exactly. At first I thought there wasn't enough liquid but I thought with all the good reviews just trust it and it was perfect. In the past I always had too much liquid and it would bubble over. This was so delicious, my husband mentioned several times how much he enjoyed it.

Fantastic - really tasty, and leftovers work really well reheated in the microwave!

A few changes - aren't there always?

- Didn't butter the dish (forgot)
- No onions (didn't have any)
- 2 cups of cheese (overenthusiastic grating)
- Took it out 15-20 minutes early (everything else was done, so I took a chance)

It was perfectly cooked, with the sauce bubbling and just blackening nicely for maximum cheesiness - a real comfort treat that everyone loved!

Family loves! Since I double or even triple this recipe I boil the sliced potatoes for a minute or two. As per other reviewers I also dice the onions and sauté in olive oil before adding.  I use white pepper instead of black and add a dash of cayenne.  Make sure to generously butter the dish and the foil before covering. Delicious comfort dish!

This recipe was easy to make and absolutely delicious.  The only thing I changed was to dice the onions as suggested by several reviewers. I did add a bit more cheese.  I used mature cheddar. I had a few extra potatoes so I went ahead and used them too.  Essentially, I made a double batch.  Cooked one one night; the other, the next (that's how much we loved them!). With the second one, I forgot to cover them so ended up just putting some foil over when the top was browned to our liking. Both versions were delicious though.  I will definitely make these again. This cheese sauce will make excellent macaroni and cheese too. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Like other reviewers I chopped the onion to make it easier to eat.  I also used olive oil instead of butter in the sauce to make it a tiny bit healthier since I used full fat white cheddar & added garlic salt instead of plain with lots of white pepper.  I did slice my potatoes a bit thinner as someone suggested & used a large, low sided dish & left it uncovered for the last 15 minutes because we like lots of brown crust on top.  The second time I added some red pepper to give it a little kick for an all adult dinner.  As someone else said I tried this for baked mac & cheese & it turned out great, too.  Thanks for a recipe I'll use over again!

Absolutely delicious. I did make a couple changes. My husband hates onions so I skipped on those and I added bread crumbs like one of the reviewers suggested. It came out great. They should have added "scallop potatoes" to the name.

My husband has asked me over and over to make this again. I was going on vacation without him, and I made him 3 large pans before I Left! Needless to say, he loves it! It's a very simple recipe that doesn't need extravagance. I decided to not use onions and it was perfect! Thanks for a great recipe

I tried it just at written hence the 4 stars.  It is good but I don't like the soggy onion rings in it.  I reduced the onion to half of an onion and chopped it up.  I also added 1/2 tsp dry mustard powder (which this recipe definitely needs!)

Everyone had seconds...will never buy boxed again. Easy recipe and so good. Replaced the russet potatoes with double the amount of red potatoes...they don't fall apart and get mushy like russets.

Very good. You need to make extra sauce with more salt and pepper.

Read the reviews… was apprehensive about using onions… Glad I did though!! To anyone that is thinking about not using the onions... Please do!! You can’t even tell that they are there but it gives it such a good flavor!  This was by far the best Au Gratin potato I have ever had!! And the first time making from scratch!  My husband LOVED it… says I have to make it all the time! ?

My husband loves au gratin potatoes and these were my first attempt at making them from scratch.  They were a huge hit.  I left the onions out because he hates onions....instead I added a little onion powder to the cheese.  This was easy, and it tasted delicious!

Well I had to improvise on this recipe due to not having some of the ingredients. I used cajun seasoning on my potatoes and celery, everything else the same. It came out so good. I plan on making this again but this time I am going to use bacon bits instead of celery and and maybe some chives.

This is a solid Au Gratin recipe, my family really enjoyed it over the holiday.  My husband and I both felt that it was missing some punch...maybe some extra cheese and some garlic.  Also I wasn't into the onion rings so I sautéed some diced onion and mixed them in with the potato I also mixed the sauce in with the potatoes and put bread crumbs on the top.  I think this bumped the recipe up to a 4...maybe.

Awesome flavor! It is wonderful to find a recipe for this and not need to buy it in a box. Have tried other au gratin potato recipes, but this one tops my flavor charts. Thank you CathyM.

I tripled the recipe for a 9x13 (3 qt) pan, but only doubled the sauce and it was perfect.  I sauted the onion and added two minced cloves of garlic, but will definitely double that and add some oregano and parsley next time.  I think a touch of cooking sherry might kick the sauce up a notch.  I also removed the foil and topped with fresh breadcrumbs before putting it back in for a final 10 minutes.

Fabulous! My husband and I hosted my parents for a BBQ dinner last weekend. He smoked a pork loin roast and I prepared the sides. Not only did this complement our meal nicely, everyone RAVED about how good it was! :) Many reviewers commented that this was a tad bland. I agree and disagree at the same time (is that even possible lol??!!?!?). Yes, this is a no frills recipe. But that doesn't mean this is bland. There IS a difference between seasoning and flavoring. Seasoning enhances a food's natural flavor (i.e. s&p). Flavoring on the other hand, is the introduction of a new flavor in a food by altering or modifying its original flavor (by adding garlic or a specific spice, for example). This recipe should be enjoyed for what it is - a simple, basic treatment for potatoes. And for those of you who didn't add onion, you're really missing out! Slice it VERY thinly and you won't even notice its there. :) Play around with this. Add a different cheese or substitute a cheese blend instead (FYI, this is especially good with Sargento's 4 State Cheddar blend!). I just can't say enough about this! Thanks for sharing your recipe, Cathy. I'm adding this to my keeper file for sure! :-)

Perfect. I've made something similar before and it's always been great.  I made a little more cheese sauce than I needed but it was fantastic with a baked ham and asparagus for Easter.  Will make again.

I made this as written first and liked it but needed a couple of changes. First, the potatoes weren't cooked thru at 1 1/2 hrs so I tried par-boiling for 5-6 minutes depending on the size of the slices which allowed me to reduce oven time to 1 hr. Second no one cared for the large pieces of onion so, I diced them and cooked them in the melted butter for a couple of minutes before adding the flour for the cheese sauce - distributes the flavor without having to eat a big string of onion. Cook for 45 minutes covered then 15 uncovered to add a little browning to the top. Works with all kinds of cheeses but our favorite is gouda and cheddar.

This is a great side dish. The easiest way to make cheese potatoes. I didnt use onion, just added onion seasoning to cheese sauce. I thought these were just right in flavor. They had just the right amount of cheese flavor and the onion seasoning gives it alittle something if you dont want the pieces of onion. This is good for a family with littleones like myself. Cant wait to make these for other family members. I know they will love them. thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe was easy enough to make. It started off like the base for homemade macaroni and cheese, which I made for Easter a few days ago. I omitted onions and used cream instead of milk, because that was what I had on hand. I also added about a cup more cheese. They came out wonderful, but there is no chance in heck I am getting the remnants out of my glass pyrex dish. I buttered it, but it's still stuck on pretty well. I recommend covering your dish with foil or getting something disposable. Also, the potatoes were done before the 1 1/2 mark.

Tried this for Easter dinner and it was great.  Doubled the recipe as I had lots of company. Cooked it with the ham at 350 for 2 1/4 hours and the potatoes were done. Everybody liked it. Thanks!

Very good.  I actually used a 50/50 mix of mild and sharp cheddar as that was all I had in the fridge.  The one major thing I do not agree with is putting salt and pepper directly on the raw potatoes "to taste" as there is no way to know what the taste is.  I actually seasoned the sauce directly since I could taste that and purposely over salted it slightly, as once on the potatoes it would taste significantly less salty.  The reason for this is that you get an even distribution in the sauce where you would not if just sprinkled.  The other thing I did was to dry the potato slices with paper towels to help with the sauce to stick better.  

This would be a great make-ahead dish, just soak the potatoes in water with a little vinegar (prevents browning), drain but do not rinse and dry with paper towels then prepare dish as usual and refrigerate.  Bring to room temperature (at least two hours) before baking.  I used a standard 9x13x2 Pyrex glass pan and it took exactly 6 servings.  Perfecto!  

The only issue I had was that since I use whole wheat pastry flour in my kitchen and not white I had to almost double the amount of roux needed.  Not the fault of the recipe, just an issue with whole wheat flour.

Very good recipe.  I too sautéed the onions but instead of onion slices I chopped the onion.  Also before pouring mixture onto potatoes, I added some crumbled bacon.  Will make again.

I doubled this recipe because I wanted to use up the potatoes I had on hand.  So glad I did...my family of four devoured this and I can't wait to nibble on the leftovers tomorrow!  When I make this again, I will make the onions slices smaller or chop them (picky kids may not notice smaller pieces).  I also added a little parmesean cheese.    After making this, I was looking at the unfavorable reviews to see what possibly would make someone not like this dish.  My conclusion is that they may not have had the patience to complete the steps according to the recipe (ie. allowing the cheese mixture to thicken on the stove to prevent "curdling").  This is a very good recipe, but one that can't be rushed!

Maybe the best French au gratin recipie I have used. This recipie doesn't need much in the way of changes. For the best result use a mandolin to slice your potatoes and onion. Some reviewers complained of large chunks of onion but if that's the case the onion was cut too thick. If done correctly the thin onion rings will almost melt away leaving a nice subtle flavor. Make sure to season with salt and pepper (not too much salt) as you do your layers. And you will get a perfect French au gratin dish.

These potatoes were easy to make and awesome! Even my picky toddler loved them. I did follow other suggestions and put in half the potatoes/onion and then added half the cheese sauce. Followed by the rest of the potatoes and then the rest of the cheese sauce. I put them in a 2 qt. dish and the cheese was bubbling over midway through, so I would definitely increase the size of the baking dish the next time I make these. I will definitely make these again! YUM!

I found this to be a very good "foundational" recipe. Though I was raised a "meat and potatoes" person, over the years I've expanded considerably to love and cook Indian, Peruvian, and Chinese cuisines, among others. Therefore, I usually jazz up more traditional recipes, including this one.

For starters, I found the onions indispensable, though I used half rings. They cooked very tender for me. Moreover, I sprinkled a generous amount of garlic powder over the potatoes once I have arranged them in the casserole dish. To the sauce, I added a teaspoon of paprika and dill weed.

It came out delicious with a very complex flavor (more than simply potatoes and cheese).

I've made this twice, first to the letter, then 2nd time, per other reviewers, added a bit of velveeta (in addition to the sharp cheddar) & some spicy mustard. Also only baked an hour. Loved it.

I made this for my family's Christmas Eve dinner to go along with our spiral cut ham.  It was a big hit!  I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions and modified the recipe by dicing the onions and adding more cheese.  I also added breadcrumbs to the top 30 minutes before the potatoes were finished.  I will definitely make these again!!!

I steeped a flattened garlic clove in the milk for about an hour before making the roux.  I was worried that my cheese was bland, so added a few splashes of beer to thin the roux a bit (best roux I have ever made!).  It added a nice tang to the sauce, white wine would work here too.  Also, I topped it with slivered ham after removing the foil to make it a main dish.  Next, I think I will experiment with sun dried tomatoes and kalamata olives, or maybe salami...sooo yummy and comforting!  Can't wait to make this again!

Made this tonight and it was delicious!! Used a 50/50 mixture of white and mild cheddar, and a bit more than the recipe suggested. I also parboiled the potatoes first to speed up the cooking time. I sauteed the onions with some garlic and herbs in there as well, they turned out great! Will definitely make this one again!

This was absolutely delicious! I made as written and it turned out perfectly, I chose this recipe because it skips parboiling the potatoes, which was so much simpler to me! I have previously made a cheesy potato casserole (the one with canned cream of chicken soup and sour cream etc.) when I'm craving something potato au-gratin-y, but this will be my new go to recipe, it uses simple ingredients that are not processed, and was absolutely delicious! Not light on the calories though, but moderation in everything - my motto "there are no poisons in life, only poisonous dosage", so don't eat the whole panful, but enjoy and indulge!

This is very tasty.  The potatoes needed a little longer in the oven, but couldn't wait because everything else was ready.  Chopped onion instead of slicing into rings.  The sauce is rich and cheesy.  I used sharp cheddar which was delicious.  My grandmother was scooping up all the sauce to eat with her dinner.  Will make again.  Easier than one would have thought it would be.

My families new favorite comfort food.  I made this with just minor alterations after reading some positive reviews.  I used 1 cup milk and 1 cup half-and-half.  For the cheese I used Sargento's 4 Cheese Blend (which has both sharp and mild cheddar in it).  I diced my onion (but did not need to pre-cook).  And I used just a bit of cayenne.  It came out beautiful like in the picture and was delicious.  
For those that said it was runny, I think that it is important to make certain to cook and stir until the mixture has thickened before adding any cheese.  I did used pre-shredded cheese and as long as you cook it long enough to entirely melt it, it should not come out grainy.  This was so good, we are having this again today with our Thanksgiving dinner.

Yummy!  Dropped the fresh onion for some sprinkled in dehydrated (kid trick =).  Used 5 potatoes (which was overkill...4 would have been fine). I was short on time, so I put the potatoes in the microwave for 5ish minutes and then sliced them..peel & all.  Totally cut the cooking time down to 45 minutes, which was perfect for my meatloaf.  This potato will go into rotation as they are easy & tasty!

This is a great recipe-  I made a few changes, starting with a larger baking dish, I used green onions instead, used sharp cheddar and Colby very generously.  I added crushed garlic and a can of drained jalapeños to the sauce just before the cheese and baked for 90 min.  Everyone had seconds.  Delish

Bland!  Added a bag of frozen peas, doubled the amount of cheddar and diced the onions to make them easier to eat.  This dish needs 2 hours to cook to avoid coming out raw.

Yummy, yummy comfort food.  Made this tonight and am looking forward to a repeat!  ABSOLUTELY GREAT as is, and should be a fantastic foundation for other "versions": with ham, or kick it up with cayenne pepper, chives, bacon...whatever.  Yummy, yummy....warm and cheesy in the tummy!

Yummy, though I would recommend that instead of salting your potatoes, that you salt your cheese sauce to taste. I added half a diced Onion & half a large Red Pepper and sliced the potatoes thinner. I also baked it uncovered, makes a more crispy top.

I gave this 5 stars for the recipe exactly as written (except I minced the onions).  I've made this many times & it's terrific!  Tonight I used the same recipe, but I made it into 3 layers and added ham, swiss cheese (cuz I had a small leftover piece), and a sprinkling of frozen peas, garlic powder and s&p to each of 2 layers then topped with the last of the potatoes & the sauce.  It was a fantastic, one-dish, comfort food meal And I froze half of it for another day.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I liked this recipe except I added 1/4 teaspoon dry mustard for flavor. Also I cooked mine with bag of frozen hash browns and it was Great! Also diced the onion(so the kids wouldn't notice) the kids and husband cleared the pan. Great and faster if you use hash browns I baked it only 30-40minutes

Absolutely delicious and extremely easy.  I followed the recipe almost exactly as is, only I took the foil off for the last 20-30 minutes so the potatoes browned nicely.  Used skimmed milk and a sharp cheddar, plenty of pepper and it was not bland in the least.  My Husband is Indian so he is used to heavily spiced and flavored dishes and he LOVED it.  Think I will make for Thanksgiving, looks so nice in the dish also :-)

This was pretty good, much better than the box mixes and none of the mystery ingrediants of the powdered cheese. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of chopping and sauteeing the onions instead of using the raw rings. I thought it was just a tad bland and will try using sharp cheddar or maybe add a little swiss cheese next time for extra flavor. I loved another reviewers suggestion of using this same recipe as the base for mac and cheese.

Made this for an easy side dish tonight, and everyone loved it! Only things I did differently were saute the onions with a little garlic before adding them to the potatoes, and sprinkle some paprika over the potatoes and onions when I salted them.

I have always wanted to try an Au Gratin Potatoes recipe, but could not find one easy enough for my hectic work schedule.  This was delicious, the only changes I made were: used 1/4 of an onion, sliced and layered between each potato layer; I also layered the cheese sauce; finally, I followed some of the suggestions and uncovered my dish the last 20 minutes.  I will definitely keep this one handy.  PS...The only potatoes I had were red potatoes, I used them -unpeeled, delicious!  Thank you so much!

I prepared the casserole the day before and stored it in the fridge until ready to bake. I used yukon potatoes and they baked up perfect. The cheese sauce was delish! Everyone at the party love the potatoes! I will make again.

This is where I learned to make Au Gratin Potatoes! This was so good, creamy and tasty. Very simple and I use this recipe all the time. My cousin's boyfriend who hates onions didn't even notice them and loved the dish.

Oh wow.  This was better than I expected.  I was also worried not enough flavor but I made sure it would not be bland by: using provolone cheese, adding 2 slices of American (which does not melt well, but still tastes pretty good), 2 tablespoons of whipped cream cheese (the REAL secret- gives the sauce a really creamy texture), & garlic salt.  I ran out of onions so just skipped them altogether.  My husband had already cooked the potatoes expecting to make mashed, but for something different, I decided to turn them into au gratin.  Once I made the sauce, I poured it over the sliced potatoes and baked at 400 deg for 25 min.  Then browned the top by broiling for another 5 min.  These were truly delish.  I had to stop myself from eating any more or I would have eaten the entire dish and my family would get none. I will try this  with onions and fresh garlic for Thanksgiving!!

Thank you for posting this recipe.  VERY EASY!  It is time consuming but the result is so worth the time.  These were the best au gratin potatos I've ever had.  I've made them a second time and added a layer of bacon crumbles and it was good.

My husband disproves of potatoes in this fashion, but this recipe has him 'tolerating' such a dish. This is a definate keeper and one that can be adjusted easily to accomodate dietary demands or picky eaters.

These were amazing!  However, I did add a bit more milk, a bit more cheese and omitted the bread crumbs (we don't like them as a topping).  I also added cayenne and nutmeg to the cheese sauce.

Great as is.  Perfect starter recipe - variations are truly infinite.  I added dried minced onion, garlic powder, and parsley.  Making it again tonight with dill.  I like it crispier so I reduced it down to 3 potatoes and baked it in two 9 inch tart pans.  I also sprinkled some cheese and panko crumbs on top.  I also recommend layering potatoes and sauce, starting with a small amount of sauce on the bottom.

I didn't think you really needed a recipe for this dish and just through stuff together. I used this recipe and realized the recipe is much better than when I wing it. It is very tasty. I would never use the boxed version after eating the real thing.

This is a FABULOUS dish! I make this frequently, the only thing I changed was greasing the bottom of the dish with a bit of oil rather than butter/margerine. It stops it from sticking to the bottom better.

I really love this recipe and I only make a few slight additions. I add about a dash of mustard powder, quite a bit of garlic powder and paprika. I add these seasonings to taste. My family really likes it when I take boneless pork chops also seasoned with salt and pepper and add them to the last 15 to 20 minutes of cook time. (at 400 even thick pork chops cook with in 20 minutes so definitely adjust the time accordingly.) I take the aluminium foil off for that last little stretch and sprinkle the top with breadcrumbs.

I replaced the usset potatoes with sweet potato.  I have done this b4 so I know it is really good with sweet potatoes.  However, this recipe was bland so it was normal but not exceptional.

I have been making this recipe as is for several years now and it's the only Au Gratin Potato recipe my family will eat! As is this is a five star recipe and very easy to make. Be sure to watch the video too if you are hesitant about adding the flour. I know many new cooks are afraid because they think it will just be lumpy but if you view the video it will ease your fears. Enjoy!

Finally made this but with tweaks though. I added garlic and omitted onions (per reviewers suggestion). I also added a quarter cup more of sauce and half cup more of cheese.

Cathy! Try putting two chopped up cloves of garlic, one in the potatoes and onions and one in the roux before stirring in the milk! It made it so amazing! I finally made this last night! It was delicious and ill be eating it for lunch today. This is my first review ever and I'm just excited that I was able to cook finally :). Of course I always put my own twists on it I also put italian herbs, a garlic salt pepper (very light) and chopped up chives on the very top. I cooked the potatoes for about 20 minutes on medium heat just to soften them so I could cook them for only about 45 minutes in the oven. Towards the end I took the aluminum foil off so I could let the top bubble and brown! We had it with asparagus and delicious steaks

I HAVE MADE THESE SEVERAL TIMES. EACH TIME I MAKE THEM EVERYONE SAYS THEY ARE THE BEST AU GRATIN POTATOES EVER!  I'M NORMALLY NOT A BIG FAN OF CHEESY POTATOES BUT MY HUSBAND LOVES THEM.  BUT I HAVE TO AGREE THAT THESE ARE DELICIOUS AND THE BEST AU GRATIN POTATOES I HAVE EVER TASTED TOO!

I found these very greasy, even though I substantially cut down on the butter. Also, they were pretty bland; definitely needed something else. I'm disappointed because I was so sure I was going to love this.

Awesome! Just like momma used to make!  (Grandma was good at lot of cooking, but she could not do things baked with cheese...  nor Italian but THAT'S another story.  :)  ).  I didn't change anything – I don't usually the first time with a recipe.  I can tell tho that these would be good with cooked bacon added or to combine with cubed ham (good way to rejuvenate holiday leftovers).  Five Stars!

We microwaved the sliced potatoes for a few minutes first to cut down on oven time.  That worked well.  I, personally, did not think this needed additional cheese sauce.  I recommend adding ground thyme to the sauce and sprinkling the top with some bread crumbs before baking.

Very yummy!  Here are my recommendations:  definitely use sharp cheddar cheese!  Decrease oven temp down to 350 and check after about an hour and 15 minutes; they tend to burn on the bottom.  A big hit with the whole family!

I enjoyed how easy this recipe is but I thought the potatoes turned out pretty bland.  I followed the recipe as written and used sharp chedder cheese.  It needs some seasonings I think.  My husband thought they were just fine though.  I think I'll look for a different au gratin potatoes recipe and if I don't find anything else decent, I'll come back to this one and try to spice it up.

AMAZING!! Eventhough I eliminated the onions and doubled the recipe, the final product was a hit! The potatoes were not over cooked and the cheese sauce was mouth watering. The kids even loved it! I will be making this regularly. Thanks for the recipe!!

This was AWESOME!!! We absolutely loved it! I only made a few minor changes. I minced the onions as other reviewers suggested, and I added a few dashes of garlic powder, along with some McCormick original chicken seasoning (which makes everything better). I also cooked it closer to 2 hours. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this tonight for the first time and will use it again and again.  I left out the onions and added cubed ham.  It was out of this world!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  It's definitely a keeper!

i LOVE these!!!  i made them for easter dinner and everyone DEVOURED them!!  i did make a few changes though.  first, i used 2 bricks of cheese (just shredded it in my processor), and then i added hormel real bacon bits (not the crunchy ones).  i made them for dinner tonight and added 4 slices of american cheese between the layers just for a little more cheese (you can never have too much cheese imo! lol)  

and, they are AMAZING as leftovers!!!  if you have any that is!!!

It didn't occur to me what was wrong with this recipe until I automatically grabbed my dry mustard for the cheese sauce and then looked at the recipe to see how much to put in, only to see that it wasn't an ingredient!!! So, I added roughly 2 tsp of dry mustard to the cheese sauce. Improved the flavor substantially.  I also sauteed the onions like other reviewers.  I didn't put the sauce on the bottom, and my bottom layer of potatoes turned crispy hard.  Ick.  I will put sauce on bottom of pan first, then alternate layers.  

But it was really good, and my family loved it.  So, definitely 4 stars.

The kids and husband liked these fine.  I thought they were ok, but agree with the reviewer who said to skip the onions.  I put them in thinking they would really enhance the dish.  They didn't.  I'd like a creamier sauce too.  I did appreciate no processed ingredients were used.

I thought this was a good comfort food recipe.  I made it for Easter dinner and actually did 1 1/2 times the recipe.  I found it slightly too oily (I ladled off some butter on the top towards the end of cooking) but that may be from me trying to increase the recipe by half.  I diced the onion and pre-sauteed it which I think was a good idea and I did remove the cover for the last 25 minutes to get some browning on top.  The leftovers are just as good as the day of.

We LOVED this dish!  I made a large recipe so it was a bit time consuming in the prep, but so worth the effort!  Based on other reviews, I really took my time with the cheese sauce and I made extra.  It turned out perfectly.  I used dry, minced onions and some jarred garlic between layers (instead of the fresh onions). With the help of my food processor, the slicing of the potatoes and shredding of the cheese was a quick and easy so it made assembly a breeze.    Everyone raved and they were actually better when we reheated them today.  A definite keeper!!!

I nade these as written except that I used a cheese blend that I had on hand that had cheddar in it.  They did not have enough cheese flavor even though I added extra cheese. Way too bland (tasted like milk).  I would definitely use sharp cheddar next time and add extra cheese.  This definitely has possibilities.  Also requires lots of salt and pepper. Did pour half sauce over potatoes after one layer. U made enough for large flat casserole and made 1.5 recipes of sauce which was right amount.  Thanks.

These potatoes were great!  I only changed chopping the onions.  Everything else was the same.  The family loves it.  I have made it for a couple of family get togethers and I think it is everyones favorite now!  It's a keeper.

Divine. I've made this for Easter for the past two years. After reading reviews, I made exactly as written but increased sauce by 1/2. I took the foil off after an hour so the top would brown a bit and even put it under the broiler at the very end for more brown patches on top. Served with ham and deviled eggs.

I would recommend adding a little nutmeg to the cream sauce, and a little extra s & p.  I also used yukon gold potatoes and added a little minced fresh parsley.

Good basic recipe that needs tweeked just a bit if I may. I love onions, but not in this dish. Just not necessary. The cheese and potatoes are the stars, so let them shine alone. I add 16 ozs. of freshly shredded cheese - sharp cheddar works great. Also, a 400 degree oven is much too hot for this dish. 350 degrees is perfect. Cover the dish for the first hour then uncover and bake for 1/2 hour more. Stir thoroughly and you'll have perfect cheesy potatoes!

Very tasty!!! I did add a bit of paprika (family tradition for au gratin potatoes), and also par-cooked the sliced potatoes in a big glass bowl to speed up the cooking time for a weeknight meal. These were a HUGE hit!

I thought these were delicious.  I loved the addition o the onion which gave it all the extra flavor it needs. Sure, you could doctor it with different spices or mix-ins, but this is really quite good as it stands.

I have done this one with parmesan cheese, or none at all.  I have also done it with almond milk instead of regular milk, and the results came out fine.  Pretty tasty, but I leave out the onion, because it doesn't seem to belong in there to me.

I only had 2- sweet potatoes and 2- regular so I used them and I sauted bacon and onion and placed some over each layer.  This recipe was amazing!!

Excellent! I swapped the onions for some garlic powder (to get a similar flavor) and my man and I were both pleasantly surprised! Super delicious!

This was delicious!  I made extra cheese sauce and it was perfect for a side on Valentine's Day.  Definately a rich dish for the everyday meal, but a great treat for special occasions.

I prepared the recipe as written and found it to be very nice and creamy. We really liked the texture of the potatoes. Served with pork steak and asparagus for a nice winter meal. I also prepared a second batch to freeze to which I added about 3/4 cup diced ham.  My only problem with the dish was to warn people to use a larger dish than called for as it did bubble up and spill over.

Love this! I add garlic to the cheese sauce as another reviewer did. It adds extra flavour. Also depending on what I have in the fridge, I add sliced mushrooms and thinly chopped salami or turkey bacon in the layer with the onions. My husband loves this.it freezes well too. If my husband likes it then its definitely a keeper, he's picky and won't eat left overs but will for these .thanks for sharing!

These were delicious! I just used half an onion since we are not big onion fans. Still fabulous! I like the simple ingredients, too. Everything already on hand. These will now become a staple at our house!

Everyone loved it. I didn't cut the potatoes in 1/4 inch slices, just slightly thinner and I still thought they were too thick. I would of liked it better if they were cut into 1/8 inch thick slices. Next time I make it I will try it like that. I topped it with planko bread crumbs, but the cheese ended up bubbling up over the top and soaked up the crumbs. I won't add the crumbs next time. As others suggested I added the sauce in between layers. I think it turned out better this way then just having it all poured over the top.

Increased this to 12 servings accordingly, and removed the foil the last 30 min to brown and crisp the top, rave reviews from everyone at our party.  Will make again !

This did not do well for us.  The sauce looked good when cooked in the saucepan, but, even though the directions state 400, we used a lower temp and the sauce was curdled-looking.  Edible, but the potato lovers in the family did not go for seconds or eat the leftovers.

For some reason my "scalloped' potatoes never seem to turn out; dry or not cooked enough. I made minor changes only because I needed more than 4 servings. Used Pyrex lasagna pan 13x9 and about 12 potatoes, enough to fill the pan. Didnt change the cheese recipe and it covered the potatoes to about 1/4" from top. Cooked for 80 minutes and potatoes were cooked perfectly! Salted and used onion powder instead of onions, nicely tasted and odd enough just enough cheese taste. NOW...trial and error will be to be eaten the next day in a crock pot Want to see if this dish can be cooked day before and kept warm in crock pot- if YES then this is a winner! Always never have oven space. Let's see!

I skipped the onions and added an extra half cup cheese. Also added 1/4 tsp black pepper and mustard powder for more flavor. Removed the tin foil at the end for a nice crunchy top. Got rave reviews from the family and will definitely make again.

Over-cooked on the bottom! And I shortened the time in the oven. 1 1/2 hours would have burned the bottom! The cheese sauce was excellent, but I need to make some adjustments to this recipe. It is a good starting point.

I made these potatoes a few years ago to bring to my  extended family's large Christmas dinner. The dish was such a hit that I'm asked to bring them every year (I'm 'not allowed' to bring anything else!). The dish is amazing; very simple, creamy and decadent. I leave the onions in rings (have had no problems with an over-powering flavor or slimy texture) and even family members not crazy about onions still love the dish. The only change I make is to add about 1/2 cup extra cheese to the cheese sauce, and I usually use either half heavy cream and half milk (1 c. cream, 1 c. milk) or half/half instead of just milk. If I could rate this dish higher, I would. Thanks Cathy!

MMM.  Very good!  I cut the potato's thinner and used a bigger casserole dish, so I only had to cook them for about 45 min.  I followed the sauce recipe exactly but I followed other reviewers and would layer the potatoes then add some shredded cheese, salt and pepper than pour sauce.

Am I the only person who found this recipe to be incredibly bland? Will use again for technique but I will definitely kick it up with garlic, salt, white pepper, maybe tabasco..something and it should be cooked for max time to ensure the onions breaking down.

I did not like this at all.  The sauce is more like a cheesy somewhat pasty sauce.  I'm assuming it's like that because of using flour which made it more like a gravy than cheese sauce.

Made as directed. It was okay - certainly not bad, but needs SOMETHING. Next time I make I'm going to add a bit of dijon mustard to the sauce, and sprinkle with crumbled bacon. Maybe a touch of garam masala to the sauce... haven't quite figured it out yet :)

Wow this was DELICIOUS!!  I only made two changes.  1) I minced the onion and sauted it with the butter and 2) I added jalepeno sausage to it and used it as a main dish.  It was wonderful and would be great as a side dish to.  We will definately have this one again.

Excellent!!! I didn't use the onion and I used Velveeta instead of shredded Cheddar.  Also added a little garlic salt.  I layered potatoes & sauce to make sure all were covered.

Everyone loves this!  A few reviews called it "bland."  Check your cheese.  You HAVE to use SHARP chedder to get the kick!  Also, you may have to add more cheese for your taste and depending how it was shredded, will affect the measurement.  

 I did not add salt to this, as it seemed fine.  I also have used this same recipe, using julienne potatoes instead of sliced.  Comes out better than the Betty Crocker box julienne potatoes!

Rich and tasty! Fairly simple to prepare. The only changes I made were to chop the onion instead of using sliced rings, and I used sharp cheddar to add a little zing. Yum!

These are addictive!! These have been made countless times, and there are never any leftovers. The recipe has been exactly as is with one exception – the onions are diced and sautéed in the making of the sauce instead of as a layer of rings. Chopped onion allows serving the potatoes easier. Occasionally a couple cloves of minced garlic is added to the sauce just for a change up, and is quite yummy that way as well. This is an all around great recipe!

I used Gruyere cheese instead and coated the top with little of it aw well. I took the tin foil off for the last 10 minutes to brown the top.

This recipe was very easy and tasted great. I didn't see the part about covering with aluminum foil, and instead covered the casserole with shredded mozzarella (we only had mozzarella and romano to work with--the sauce featured both) and baked for 30-40 minutes at about 350 or 375 (not 400; I didn't want the cheese on top to burn). We only had a few small potatoes to work with and I used a smallish square dish to cook them in, so for ours it didn't really need such a long cook time. I agree with other reviewers about the onions; I chopped mine fairly small and thought it worked well that way. Great recipe; I will definitely be making this again! Thank you!

I used sliced sweet potatoes instead of white potatoes, and made smaller pieces of ham and onions. It tasted delicious! The orange really added to the presentation, too, especially as tomorrow is Halloween.

This was excellent!! The only changes i made were adding about a tsp of cayenne to the flour mixture, and extra 1/2 c of cheese in the sauce and cheese on top, i used yukon gold and it turned out perfectly! took the foil off for the last 20 mins of baking as per other reviewers suggestions and the top browned nicely, i will definitely be making this over and over, so easy and so good!

DELISH! I added broccoli (I defrosted 6 min in the microwave them put it on top of everything. Next time I will put in the middle, between two layers of potatoes). Chopped and sauteed the onions first, put them on the bottom, and followed the recipe. I used mexican blend cheese cause that's what I had. I served with Orange Cracker Apricot chicken leftover from the they before. Add salt and Pepper, don't skimp. 20 stats!

Made this last night as a side to pork chops.  Hubby and son loved it, and everyone agreed it was delish!  There are a few things I would change, though.  I would skin the potatoes first, as this instruction is not listed in the directions.  Also, I would add another 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon ground pepper to the potatoes.  We had to add extra salt and pepper at the table, as it was really bland.  You might want to think about using EXTRA-SHARP cheddar, too, as this may bring up the cheddar flavor a bit.  All in all a great recipe, though!  Thanks CathyM!

My whole family loved this recipe. I would like to find a cheese that's not so oily next time and maybe the oil won't sit on the top-super good taste. I used Yukon Gold and that type of potato doesn't need to cook for as long as stated. It was about 40 minutes...great flavor though for something that seems so simple.

This was a great and easy recipe that my kids and husband really loved!  The only thing I changed was the onion. I pureed my onion and spread it on with a basting brush because my family doesn't enjoy onion pieces even if I cut them very small.  I will definitely make this again!

This is a great base recipe! Thank you! To make it into a one-stop meal, I tweaked it a bit by adding ground beef and corn. For the cheese sauce I used marble cheese and jalapeno havarti cheese (cut up into chunks to melt, as it was a bit too soft to grate). I also mixed in some dried parsley and paprika...more for colour than flavour. I also layered everything: potatoes, beef, corn, cheese, repeat, ending with potatoes and cheese. Delicious!

We made this for dinner last night and it was awesome.  I was not sure if I was to use salted or unsalted butter, so I used unsalted since I peppered and salted the potatoes before adding the cheese sauce.  I also used sharp cheddar cheese.  They only took 1 hour to cook in my oven. They were perfect.  Will definitely have these again, especially when trying to impress guest for dinner.

I thought this was a very good recipe.  I know that this was the classic way of making au gratin potatoes, but I need more flavor in mine.  The first time I made it, I made it according to the exact recipe.  It got "eh" reviews from hubby and son.  The second time around, I added nutmeg, and a little paprika for color.  I also shredded the cheddar with some Gruyere, and doubled the butter.  With the modifications, we absolutely loved it.

I made this dish for the first time. It was so creamy and tasty! I changed a couplt of things: I chopped onion and fried them with a part of the butter to get them transparent and add rest of butter to melt, and followed the directions. Also as previous reviews, I sprincle PANKO over the top of the dish to bake. Creamy and crispy!  We loved it!  I will make this again for Thanksgiving!

I doubled this recipe and baked in a glass 9 X 13 pan.  It was wonderful and so easy.  I didn't care for the way the oil from the cheese pooled up on the surface but maybe that says more about the cheese I used (preshredded packaged sharp cheddar).  I only used 1/2 the onion called for but next time I will add the entire onion as it added great flavor and getting a bite with onion was a treat.  I liked using a large, shallow pan since it created more "browned bits" on the bottom which were tasty.

Excellent recipe. I added a chicken bouillon cube to the cream sauce instead of salt and followed the remaining directions. Let's just say, I can no longer make this recipe and leave it at home. I will have to take to a potluck instead. This recipe is a winner!

Very simple to make recipe.  This is a great side dish for fish.  The only changes I made were using Yukon Gold potatoes unpeeled and Gouda cheese.  The potatoes came out perfect.  It was even better the next day.

Pretty yummy!  I liked the sauce, maybe add a tad more salt if you like salt.  I did add quite a bit of pepper, love pepper.  Definitely uncover the last 20 minutes and chop the onions.  I doubled the recipe and used a little less chees and it was pretty good, Im not into tons of cheese so I use less and maybe even would have used even less.  All in all, really tasty and easy.  Will make this again!

I prepared this dish for my family and it was a hit.  To speed up the process I boiled the potatoes for a few minutes before placing  them in the baking  dish .

unless you really don't like onions add the onion. Its accents the potato's and cheese. I do chop then instead of rings. This is great.

I left out the onions as they'd be better if grilled first and I didn't want to bother this time.  DELICIOUS without!  Made with potatoes from the garden and a little extra cheese (Mexican blend from Costco) - disappeared shortly after it hit the plates.  Thanks for the great recipe, we've used it over & over again!

Wonderful recipe as-is (I only left the onions out and used onion powder in the cheese sauce instead). Our guests could not get enough of it! I followed the recommendation of one of the reviewers though and made more sauce (1.5 portion) and sort of regret it: potatoes were swimming in it. So next time I will do as the original recipe says.

This is a new favorite. I can't wait to make it again.
I made this as directed except I diced the onions and I subtituted some leftover cream for a portion of the milk.

Easy for a potatoes au gratin virgin. Only thing I messed up on was the milk. I think I needed a little more. It was still ultra tasty still. I used the things I had lying around at home. Red potatoes, jalepeno cheddar, sweet texas onion, and I added dried sliced garlic. I will make it this way from now on but with more milk. I think the key is the jalepeno cheddar. SUPER TASTY with a little kick. I'm sure it would taste good according to the recipe, but you guys should try it the way I made it.

I made this recipe exactly as stated and did not find it to be too oily at all.  It had a wonderful creamy flavor that everyone loved, it was one of the first dishes to be gone at a family gathering we had.  Never buying the boxed stuff again!

Delish! I only changed the recipe to include a 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg for a little more depth of flavor.  May also try another cheese next time.  Maybe a Gruyère cheese next time.  Overall, this is very good.

I modified with no onion, 3/4 cup half and half, 1 1/4 cup fat free evaporated milk and added extra cheese between the layers.  The extra cheese was a mistake as the potatoes got greasy but every one loved these potatoes - especially the crispy bits along the sides.

This recipe is delicious! Everyone I serve it to aboslutely loves it. One thing my sister suggested is try putting frenches fried onions or bread crumbs on top to add a little crisp factor. I have to say its really good and right before its done take off the top so it gets crunchy on top. Yummy!!!

I made this with lowfat milk to make it healthier and the sauce was very watery and not creamy at all. Next time I will use either whole milk or light cream and see how it goes.

Wonderful recipe! Instead of the onion rings, I diced my onion along with a diced red sweet pepper and 2 cloves of garlic and sauteed the three before adding to the potatoes. I reserved about 1/4 of the oinion/pepper/garlic mix to sprinkle on top before popping in the oven. It added a little more flavor and made the dish pretty.

As others mentioned, I doubled the cheese sauce. It was excellent. Took it to an Easter dinner and everyone was fighting over the leftovers! Cooking time is much longer than written. I even boiled my potatoes for ten minutes ahead and it still took longer than the time listed. But a wonderful recipe!

I've made this dish a few times now, most recently yesterday for Easter dinner. Delicious every time! My only issue seems to be that the bottom burns a bit, and I haven't figured out how to change that, but otherwise it is a perfect dish.

My husband usually doesn't like au gratin potatoes, but he loved these!  I also chopped and sauteed the onion before layering.  I  used a mix of sharp and mild cheddar.  Wonderful.

This dish is very simple, but incredibly good. I doubled the recipe to serve more than four and it still came out fantastic. This is comfort food meant for the Gods.

I have a hard to please man. It's rough trying to find something he'll eat. This is going to be a favorite. He's tried the boxed versions before and was totally dissatisfied. Said we weren't to eat it again. After eating this recipe he actually said we were having this again in the future. So thank you for helping me out. He makes my life a living migraine when it comes to food and this recipe has eased my pain.  Lots of smiles!!!

Great Recipe and easy to make.  I Add more cheese and diced up hatch green chili.  Its a little more spiced up, but my family went back for seconds on potatoes instead of finishing off the tenderloin that was there.

Delicious dish.  Very creamy and cheesy, but not overpowering.  One slight change is that I used half an onion.  Even my husband liked this and he's usually not into potato dishes.

I am not a very experienced cook but I like to try new things and this one turned out lovely! 

It was very easy to make. 

The only change I made was I put courgettes instead of onions because I ran out of onions that day! It was delicious, i might put some other veg in next time like cauliflour or broccolli to save me cooking veg seperate as a time saver.

Thanks for adding this recipe :)

I made this for me and my fiance, his mother and his mothers boyfriend. After hefty servings and even seconds, there was still a lot left. This recipe was delicious, and I will definitely be making it again. I did two things differently, I used a 3qt casserole dish, and i diced the onions instead of slicing them into rings. I used the 3qt dish because I doubled up the recipe, but not the onions.

To cut down on baking time, I preboiled the sliced potatoes for a total of 8 minutes (I had a hungry hubby who specially requested potato gratin). It cut the baking time at least by half. For the sauce, I substituted Gouda for the cheddar (cheddar is expensive in Germany and hard to find in the area I live in), added a 1/4 tsp of garlic powder, and added a few dallops of sour cream to give it some tang. This turned out really well. Will definitely make again. My husband also made the comment that next time I should add sliced salami or ham.

My family ate all of it and enjoyed it, but even though I greased the baking dish, it burned around the outside and stuck to the dish.  If I make it again, I will add more sauce and check on it more often, maybe not cooking it as long, or lowering the temperature of the oven.

I thought these were good. However, if I were to make it again, I think I would double the cheese sauce, or possibly just another half recipe. Also I thought it was too much onion... so I think I would skip that. Other than that, it was really good!

Made this for a Potluck...everyone Loved it!  Easy to make, creamy, good flavor.  I took the foil off and actually cooked it 10 minutes longer to brown the top.  Will make this again for sure.

Really good!  I will use this recipe from now on when making au gratin potatoes.  I will, however, shorten the cooking time to 1 hr since after 1hr 15mins it was burnt on the sides and bottom.  I also diced my onions instead of using rings and I added garlic powder.  Definitely better than the processed box kind and not as salty.  Love it!

this was a fantastic roast accompanyment! I made a few slight changes- I used 3 minced shallots and cooked them in the butter and omitted the onion that the recipe called for to mellow out the onion aspect. I used 1 cup of sharp cheddar and 1/2 cup of mild cheddar/monterey blend shredded cheese and it was the hit of the dinner! I will definitely repeat this one again!

Oh lord, these were amazing. I made them last night as a side to some steak. They were amazingly creamy, my family ate them up quickly. I took the advice of another reviewer and microwaved them for about 8 minutes before baking, and then baked for half an hour. They came out perfectly cooked. I also added two chopped garlic cloves to the cheese sauce because my family are garlic nuts.

My mother in law (who's been making au gratin potatoes for years) said these were the best she has ever had!  No changes at all to recipe.  One tip I would recommend warming milk in microwave before adding to butter/flour.  It will cut your thickening time in half!.

Overall this was very good. I did make some changes because I've been experimenting with bechamel sauce lately (which is essentially what you're making with the butter, flour, then milk added later). I let the butter/flour mixture bubble for about 5-6 minutes, stirring constantly, so that the flour flavor would cook out, and mixed in cold milk once the roux was a light brown/beige. I let that come to a light boil whisking the whole time again, then reduced the heat to let it simmer with some garlic powder and salt for about 15 minutes. This evens out the bechamel sauce and makes sure that there is no grainy-ness or flour taste. Then remove the pan from heat to stir in cheese.
While all that's happening, I had the less than 1/4" sliced potatoes and diced onions pre-cooking on 400 with the smallest amount of olive oil to coat each slice, for about 30 minutes, then reduced temp to 350 (I did this out of concern the cheese sauce would separate at too high of a temperature). After another 15 minutes I stirred in the cheese sauce with the potatoes, and finished off for about 15-20 minutes, adding parmesan in the last 10 on top. YUM! 
This is a great basic recipe, I was disappointed a bit in how the cheese flavor seemed masked by the roux/milk sauce. Next time I'll try the sauce with 2% milk instead of whole which is all I had. I read somewhere that too much fat can mask the cheese flavor,  but not enough and the cheese won't melt very well.

I used some delicious organic butter colored red potatoes (no idea the variety but garden fresh).  I sauteed the chopped onions with garlic  and butter first before adding the flour and liquid.  Made the cheese sauce with around 1 1/2 cups milk and a little heavy cream.  I added garlic powder, onion powder, paprika and a little cinnamon to the sauce.  Also, I slice the potatoes first, then boil them until almost done.  This speeds up the cooking in the oven.  Result was delicious.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I made some alterations to suit our tastes, but nothing major. Like some others suggested, I diced the onion instead of leaving it in rings. I also added a bit of cheese between the layers. I will definitely make this again!

Definite traditional comfort food. Just what I wanted to serve with my homemade honey baked ham for Christmas dinner. I took a few tips from other reviews, such as sauteing the onions in the butter first. I also layered the potato slices and the sauce. Topped it with cheddar cheese. YUM!!!

My hubby absolutely loved this and I will agree that this is much better and probably healthy than the processed stuff.  I did not mind the onion rings.  Actually  couldn't tell that they were there besides the flavor.  This is a keeper!

This recipe is a great foundation to an awesome dish. One thing that I noticed on a lot of reviews were there was some complaints about the dish being dry or bland, yet stating that the onions were not included or cooked prior to placing in the dish.  This may be why the dish is bland and dry. The onions, when placed raw in the dish sweat while they cook adding moisture and flavor! Also, keeping the dish covered is important and uncover the last 1/2 hour if you want. I minced my onions, because I don't prefer large pieces. I added a different combinations of cheeses: cheddar, cambozola, and some parm. In the end the dish was good, it seemed there was a flavor missing, so the next time I make it I will tweak with it a little. But like I said this a great foundation, allowing modifications to ones' own tastes. This is the first time I made Potatoes Au Gratin homemade, now I think I will always make it at home!

These potatoes are outrageously good.  Made them for Christmas day and served them with a baked ham.  I've always had problems with the potatoes being fully cooked so I took a suggestion from another recipe and steamed the potatoes first, then peeled and sliced them. This worked.  The outcome was so delicious, my husband is going to throw out all the boxes of Betty Crocker Au Gratin Potatoes I have in the pantry!!!!  Never again will I use a box mix.  Thanks so much for sharing your recipe.

This recipe is AMAZING! I made it just as called for and my family LOVED it. This is also a recipe that you can add your own personal touches to. I have added a little nutmeg, another time I put in a little curry powder. It just depends on your personal taste.

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was so good that I made a new batch three days later with leftover ham mixed in. The cheese sauce was very easy with the tips provided to make it smooth. I am planning on playing with Mac and Cheese and vegetable sauces with this as a base.

This was a little heavy, but was very flavorful. I agree with another reviewer's comment that the sauce would make an awesome home made mac 'n' cheese sauce. Next time I make this I will try to make it with white cheddar cheese - the bright yellow color was a little alarming for this dish. I'm use to a more white au gratin.

These tasted okay but took forever to get done! I also chopped the onions and layered. My tip is to make sure to cover so the top doesn't get too done and to slice the potatoes thinly. I used a 9x13 in. pan to bake this in and mine took an hour longer than the suggested cooking time. It was good but I don't know if it was worth the wait. The sauce however made a great base for broccoli cheese soup so I guess it wasn't a total loss!

This is a holiday and everyday staple dish. Everyone likes it every time. It's perfect the way it is, or get fancy with the cheese-which I layer in instead of just putting on top. I slice the potatoes a little thinner and put in about a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg.
My preference is to use gruyere and swiss cheese and only about 1/2 onion so the cheese is not overpowered. I baked it a bit longer than they suggested, so consider it might need a bit more time than suggested. I also took off the foil for about 15 minutes at the end to brown a little.

Wonderful side dish. I boiled the sliced potatoes for about ten minutes and bake for almost one hour. I also we'd half & half. Wow...this was outstanding!

Good recipe, here are some changes I made. I diced the onions and sauteed them in a pan with some crushed garlic, butter and about an 1/8 cup of sugar for a few minutes. Then i added the potatoes and sauteed everything for an additional 15 minutes.    For the sauce I used 1 cup milk and 1 cup of heavy cream. I also used 1 cup of mexican 4 cheese mix and 2 cups of sharp cheddar.    Before putting the potatoes in the casserole pan I mixed a little bit of the cheese sauce evenly throughout. Added half to the pan, added a light layer of the cheese sauce and some grated cheddar followed by a light sprinkling of a grated romano and bread crumb mix. I then repeated that with the second half of the potatoes but with a slightly thicker layer of cheese sauce and the bread crumb mix on top. Then I covered with foil, baked for 20 min, removed the foil and baked for an additional 15 min.     This gave it a great combo between the bite of the sharp cheddar and the sweetness from sauteeing the onions/potatoes with some sugar. Next time I plan to add some sour cream to the cheese sauce to see how that works.

Great recipe, I have made it 3 times now as a side dish to go with my dinner. Everyone loves it, its creamy and yummy. I used onion flakes instead of the rings, I'm not a huge onion fan, and I added a little garlic powder, it was very good. I love em'.

Very simple to follow and very good.  This is how I handle the onion thing:  I grate the onion and then add it to the cheese sauce.  This way you get all the flavor of the onion and the onion itself "disappears"

I have 2 ways of making this exact recipe that I have experimented with over time to "improve" the taste and flavours. 1) instead of cheese sauce, use cream of chicken/mushroom soup mixed with a can of creamstyle corn and pour over potatoes, then top with cheese (this way you use less cheese but still get the flavour and gooey-ness!) or 2) mix 1 cup heavy cream, sauteed mushroom, creamstyle corn, salt, pepper and a pinch of chilli and pour over potatoes...delicious! If you have less time on hand, slice and pre-cook potatoes in microwave (6 min for 4 potatoes) then arrange in casserole and top with sauce. This way it only needs about 20-30min in the oven to brown.

Delicious!  But I used less potatoes and more cheese.  I only had enough room for potato slices from 2 1/2 med/large potatoes in my 8x8 pan.  I used the same amount of sauce, except I added an extra 1/2 cup of cheese.  It was very cheesy and creamy - not dry at all like some other people posted. (I also used a blend of Mild Cheddar. Monterrey Jack, and Mozzarella cheeses.)  I also used whole milk.  I wanted to save time so I sauteed the onions in a little butter before I added to the dish - and I cooked the potatoes (whole) in the microwave for 10 min on high.  I still had to cook the dish for about 90 min to get the potatoes to the right texture.  So keep that in mind.    The onions and a little extra salt gave it the flavor it needed - it seems like a lot of onions when you're making it, but I'm glad that I used them all.  Next time, I might cut the onions into smaller pieces.  Overall, I was very pleased with how this came out!    Otherwise

THis is the first recipe I have used that actually worked for au gratin or scalloped potatoes. I have used it a few times, I hate onions with a passion so for others I grate them so fine even I can't see them, and I mix it all together and do not layer potato then onion but mixed altogether it is quite nice.

I agree with Shiny Cooking.  I really like the recipes that call for whole foods and not all the canned soups, soup mixes and gray mixes.  They cost of these mixes raises the cost of the recipe and adds a lot of unnecessary ingredients.  Sometimes less is more and definitely more healthy.

This is very good! I used fat free milk to cut down on fat but needed to make a little extra rue to help thicken it. The Cheese sauce would be good with elbows for mac adnd cheese like other readers suggested. I will keep that in mind! Very good and I will make again!

We liked these. As ashamed as I am to say it, I think I still prefer the taste of the boxed potatoes, but I'm going to try to tweak this recipe until it wins hands down. I cut the potatoes pretty darn thin, but for some reason they still took almost twice the amount of time in the oven. I thought they tasted better the next day, reheated. I got scared halfway through because it seemed like it was starting to separate a bit. Overall I'm glad I tried it, and very glad that my boyfriend will eat anything when he's hungry enough. I'll certainly try it again sometime.

Everyone loves this recipe. Instead of salt and pepper, as I layer the potatoes I sprinkle Old  Bay and top with Old Bay before putting it in the oven.

Microwaved the potatoes (whole) for 10 minutes before slicing.  Saved 30 minutes of baking time.  This was delicious!!  Only change was used the whole bag of shredded cheddar & diced the onions.  MUCH better than the box version!!

Like others, I dice the onions.  I add a tablespoon or two of Dijon mustard to the cream sauce - it gives it a little kick (forget the salt, add some pepper).  I sprinkle parmesan cheese on top, too.  Great recipe.

Very good recipe, time consuming but to be expected with au gratin potatoes. The onions were still a little firming then I preffer after baking for 1 hour. Next time I will saute the onions and add some bacon. The flavor is good but, need a little something extra......that's where the bacon and sauted onions will come in. Will make again with some adjustments.

These were really good.  I minced up the onion (as per others reviews) which I really liked.   I also took the foil off for the last 20 minutes and added bread crumbs.  I used 3/4 cup sharp cheddar and 3/4 cup mild cheddar.   Next time I will use all sharp cheddar to give a fuller flavor.   Thank you for the recipe!

This was good, but not spectacular.  I think I will add some more flavorful cheeses next time.  And I will use a 2 quart baking dish since it bubbled over my 1.5 quart dish.  Otherwise the instructions made perfect cheese sauce and perfectly cooked potatoes.

Update: These seemed to become more flovorfully delicious as leftovers.

These were good, but I felt the recipe was a bit off. I also finely diced my onion and let it brown with some diced fresh garlic. I also used only 1/2 an onion, as I am not a fan, but wanted to follow the recipe. I added some velveeta, as I only had exactly 1 1/2 cups of shredded cheddar, and I wanted to take the advice of other reviewers and add to the cheese flavor. Next time I will just use more cheese and not velveeta (but thats all I had on hand). I poured some cheese sauce on each layer of potatoes. I found there was not enough sauce to my liking, so next time I will make double the recipe of sauce. I seasoned each layer of potatoes with salt, pepper, and garlic salt before pouring on the cheese sauce & added the onion and garlic mixture to every other layer. I sprinkled extra cheese on the top before placing in the oven. I also agree, as other reviewers have said, that a 1 quart casserole dish is just not big enough, I used a 2 quart and it was perfect. I cooked these on 400 for 1 hr 10 minutes, then removed the lid and cooked uncovered for another 20 minutes. Very nice flavor and potato texture. Next time I will try and cook this in the crock pot, as another reviewer suggested. This was great with my baked chicken, which I stuffed with veggies.

Didn't have the 1 1/2 to bake, so I sliced the potatoes using the mandolin and boiled them for 5 mins, then drained them and put in the casserole dish.  It was a real time saver. I put a little minced garlic on the potatoes and when the sauce was done, I poured it onto the potatoes and then gently coated the potatoes and baked for 20 minutes. It turned out great.

I have made this recipe a few times, but have not had good luck with it. It is too dry. There is not enough cheese, even when I add another 1/2 cup. Also, I find it too bland.  Next time I plan to add gruyere or fontina cheese as well, cayenne pepper.  (My neighbor makes this with Velveta cheese instead, but I don't like Velveta). Also, the onion is better if minced and not cut into rings. I like the onion flavor, just not the texture of big rings.

My husband can't eat cheese so I make this all the time with just the onions.  Sometimes I put a little bit of milk in it (1/4 c. or so) for moisture, salt and pepper, cover and bake.  Awesome!  Lowfat, too...

Great recipe, I have made them this way for years and very simple but mightly tasty. My preference is using red potatoes because of the wonderful flavour. I love my meat but can make this a meal on its own.

This is a great comfort dish.  Simple, cheesy goodness.  My only problem with this dish was the amount of oil it produced, but that's to be expected with something so cheesy and so high in calories.  I did bake it for about 15 minutes without the foil on top, which gave the potatoes a nice golden brown crunch on top.  This is a great recipe for those days when you want something simple, familiar, and soothing.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great side dish.  I also diced the onions and added some sourcream as many suggested.  I  used a mild, sharp, and a white cheddar mix. Only because the supermarket was out of the regular cheddar brand I like.  I also added a minced clove of garlic and topped it with bread crumbs for some texture.   My husband loved it.  I would make this again in a heartbeat.  I love a side dish that you can forget about in the oven for over an hour while you prepare the rest of dinner.

We LOVE this recipe!!  I microwaved the potatoes to cut down on oven time, added some garlic and cajun seasoning (we like some kick) and it was awesome!  I have used this sauce for mac and cheese and it was great!  Thanks for sharing!

I sliced the potatoes to 1/8th of an inch and microwaved them for 20 minutes to reduce the cook time to 30 minutes. I diced the onions and cooked them with garlic powder in olive oil until soft. I added the onions and a dash of nutmeg to the sauce. I also used mexican blend cheese and parmesan cheese instead. I poured the sauce over the par-cooked potatoes and stirred it up, then added more cheese and bread crumbs to the top for a crust. It was really good!

I am a young teenager just starting to cook and made this recipe. All my family and I love this dish. I minced the onions b/c I don't like eating large pieces.

I though recipe was very good. The only thing I changed was, I layered the cheese on top potatoes instead of mixing it into the roux.

This is a wonderful recipe that I have made too  many times to count! The only thing I do different is saute the onions in some butter and add garlic. I also sprinkle shredded cheese on top prior to baking. Comes out fantastic!

Excellent!  I've never made this before & it turned out ridiculously great.  I cut the recipe in half since there is just 2 of us here.  I also took the advice of another member & removed the foil the last 15 minutes of baking.  This resulted in a brown crispy crust that was awesome!  Thank you!

I was not a big fan of these.  It was VERY dense and heavy.  I know that au gratin potatoes are supposed to be like that in a way but this was just very greasy and one I won't make again.

Great comfort food!  I used 6 medium sized potatoes and left the sauce measurements the same.  I baked this covered for an hour and then baked for another 20 minutes uncovered so the top would brown a little.  Creamy and just oh so good!

I truly love this recipe. I do add some of my own little touches.I do the first layer of potatoes then onions as described then a little salt and pepper and then some crumbled blue cheese. The rest of the potatoes are then layered on. I make the cheese sauce with half and half for a creamier taste and add a little garlic powder to the sauce as well. When it is baked and cut the blue cheese is the perfect little slightly tangy,gooey surprise in the middle. Delicious and it gets rave reviews every time.

I microwaved the potatoes to cut down on baking time, sauteed diced onions in the butter for the roux, and cooked these in my toaster oven until they were bubbly and browning on top. So easy, and just the thing to warm the bones on a chilly Spring night.  This is company-worthy!

I followed what another poster did and omitted onions and added bread crumbs. I also decided to slice the potatoes with a hand slicer (similar to a mandolin) so they wouldn't be chunky.   It was okay. The recipe didn't crisp like I get at restaurants but it was not bad. Make this recipe and it will be enjoyed by all.

This was great, made for Easter dinner.  I did saute the onions before putting in and used a little less onion since I had some non onion lovers.  Will make this again!!

I gave this 5 out of 5 stars for being what it is, a homey, comfort food sort of dish. I used swiss cheese instead of cheddar (more traditionally French) but I think I would have liked the cheddar better. Also, I highly suggest you use a mandolin to cut the potatoes and onions, which results in perfectly paper thin slices with two minutes of effort. I added small amounts of thyme, salt and pepper between every layer of potatoes  and used half the amount of onions because I was a little skeptical how they would taste. Don't be afraid of the onions! They really made the dish great and I regret I didn't use the suggested amount. I also used extra cheese, which this dish doesn't really need. It's incredibly rich already!

You need to double the cheese sauce and cut down on the onions for this to be better, in my opinion. Next time I will use sharp cheddar instead of mild.

The idea and base of this recipe is good, but when I made it per instructions it turned out bland. I will definitely have to do some tweaking to this recipe to get it to have flavor.

Excellent recipe!  Tripled it and took to Easter dinner - got rave reviews!  Took advice of other reviewers and carmelized the onions first; used equal parts shredded mozzarella and sharp cheddar and then put in about a cup more of a shredded tricheese mix in my fridge.  Layered it in 3s and baked the last 30 min with lid off.  Really a winner - thank you!!

These came out really good and reminded me of the potatoes my mom used to make.  I followed another recommendation and diced the onions.  Next time I think I will put the sliced potatoes in a bowl and season w/ salt and pepper before I layer them.  My husband loved them and I am sure I will be making them again.

OK, this has to be THE BEST au gratin potato recipe ever!!! I changed 6 things:  I used Yukon Gold potatoes instead of Russets.  I added minced garlic (3 cloves) to the butter rue before adding the milk.  It added a little more flavor to the cheese sauce.  I also omitted 1 onion and 2 Tbsp of butter.  I also added an extra cup of cheese.  The cheese I used was a 3-cheese cheddar blend (Sharp, Mild and White Cheddars).  OH YEAH - One more thing I changed was INSTEAD of layering the potatoes and onions, I mixed them in a large bowl and poured the cheese sauce over the mixture and blended it - then poured in a casserole dish.  It turned out perfectly. It was an AWESOME Easter meal and my family loved it!!! P.S.  I doubled the batch for leftovers...I can't wait until tomorrow!!!!

Very good!!    And pretty easy as well.  Like others I'm using the cheese sauce for my home made mac-n-cheese for now on!    The only thing I did differently was to use the Steam bags to steam the potatoes.  I did everything else the same except I used the crock pot.   Since the potatoes were cooked, I just put the crock on high for 1.5-2 hrs and it was perfect!   thank you for sharing!

Really enjoyed this.  I served it tonight to my teenaged daughter and her boyfriend and they loved it.  I also omitted the onions as recommended, but next time I might add some small bits of diced onion.  I did also layer the cheese as suggested.  Will definitely make again.

This was very, very easy to make. And so delicious to eat! Rather than slicing my onion, I grated it. It was perfect!

I made this mostly as you suggested, however, I left out the onions and I cut the slices in half to make them more "bite friendly".  My husband and stepson (10) loved these! I will make these again for sure! Thanks!

These were good. I skipped the roux to make ours gluten free, by using corn starch dissolved in milk. Was very yummy. I cook ours the last 30 mins uncovered and would probably go longer uncovered, too.

This is a wonderful recipe!  My husband and I LOVED these potatoes.  I was looking for an all natural recipe for au gratin potatoes and this dish is so delicious!  Thank you for a great recipe that I will make again and again!

These turned out good.  I liked the cheese sauce a lot but I think it would be even better as a macaroni and cheese sauce.  It kept reminding me of that as I ate the potatoes.

These are the best potatoes I've ever had. We added a lot more cheese, though. We doubled it, I think. And added some of that amount to the top. We let it cook uncovered for the last 20 minutes and it was perfect!

Really good! Made with organic potatoes, which have a sweeter taste because they have no chemicals, so I doubled the cheese.  Added breadcrumbs tossed with salt, paprika and a drizzle of olive oil, sprinkled on top and baked. Delish!!

I made this recipe exactly as listed and it was pretty good. Next time, I would definitely dice the onions, and probably add in some garlic. For some reason, the texture was also better when we reheated it a couple of days later. It was somewhat greasy right out of the oven.

This recipe is amazing, very straight forward and easy. I dont like the taste of raw onions so I sauteed my onions in the butter/olive oil until golden with 1 clove of crushed garlic and added guyere cheese. Very yum, it was gone before the main course.

Use plenty of salt and it's fantastic!  I also dice the onions, add a couple of minced cloves of garlic, and sometimes, a few slices of cooked bacon chopped up.  Only problem is, we have to eat this only on special occassions because, let's be honest, it's a load of fat and carbs, but sooooo good!

My gang said this is a keeper.  That's a big complement.  I did use a medium/small onion, diced, and 4 large potatoes.  I added a little garlic powder to the sauce. I add the potatoes and cheese sauce in layers.  Oh yeah, I used a 9X13 baking dish.  The crusty top was the favorite part.

Ok I followed the recipe EXACTLY with the exception of the onions. I hate onions. I don't know if that flavor is what makes this dish or what but it turned out sooooo bland I didn't even finish what I put on my plate. It looked and smelled so good, I just don't know what happened...

Yummmmmmmmm!!! Pure. Comfort. Food. I added dried onion flakes instead of onion slices (purely out of laziness) and used Tillamock sharp cheddar cheese. Oh. My. I cooked it at 375 for a little over an hour... next time I will take the foil off towards the end to give it that nice brown color on top.

No wonder D.H. loves this recipe. It's wonderful! I did cut back on the amount of flour, as to let the oils from the cheeses be the star. And I layered it much like you would a lasagna. Potato, onion, sauce, repeat. This recipe is sooo versatile! It was garlic night, so I sauteed some garlic in the butter before making the roux. Garlic is quintessential on garlic night, it goes into EVERYTHING. I can't wait until Thyme night! Doesn't Creamy Au Gratin Potatoes w/ Fresh Thyme sound decadent? Thanks Cathy! Your a keeper!!!

I made this for New Years.  I omitted the onions and added extra cheese as suggested.  Mine turned brown almost burned.  I think the 400 deg for 1 1/2 hours is far too long.  Next time I will change temp to 350 and cook for an hour.

I think it was great, but with a few changes.  More cheese for sure.  I added thinly sliced mushrooms to the onion layer. Then I added thinly sliced tomato over the top.  I then added panko crumbs.  It was great.  I know I changed a lot but I am having a blast actually trying to cook well.    Take care and enjoy!

Oh my gosh good!  I went out on a limb and made this to take to a potluck at work.  Never a good time to try a new recipe, but this was a hit!!!  I didn't use 3 onions like the recipe said to after I scaed up for 12 servings.  I only used one and it was plently for 10 large potatoes.  I also added extra cheese in the sauce and salt and pepper between the layers. Mine was done cooking after 1 hour in a convection oven.  And I did add some cheese on top to brown.  Read the other reviews and get some great tips!!!

nothing is better than au gratin potatoes...great also for fennel root if you can find it-the sweetness of the fennel with the saltiness of the cheese is a great contrast

Perfect. recipe is simple, no processed ingredients. Excellent nutrition. A good recipe is a springboard for myriad adjustments, and this au gratin receipt gives one many options. Here's a suggestion/dialogue with Cynthia's offering:  Having scaled the measures up by one third, I:   - Replaced one third more potatoes with One cup (dry) red quinoa. I cooked the quinoa in a touch less water as required, added the cut/scrapped bits of potato and onion to it, then laid quinoa on as a middle layer, between the two sets of potato/onion layers.  - Used Yukon Gold variety instead of Russet, as the slices seem to crumble less, and maintain their shape.  - Used two types of onion: 1/3rd Western Yellow, 2/3rd Northern Red. More for nutritive balance then for colour.  - Rubbed garlic onto bottom and sides of baking dish.  Sauce adjustments:  - Used dark Rye flour in sauce. Again, this was done for the nutritive benefits of Rye. Don't worry, is doesn't turn the sauce brown. Rather, one gets a more rich and less bright orange colour.  - Being out of milk, I whisked two eggs into 1 cup of 33% (pouring/whipping) cream, replaced the rest of the milk with water.  - Added half a tablespoon of fresh-cracked black pepper, and one heaping tablespoon minced garlic to the sauce (after cheese is added).       A beautiful base recipe. I have already given Cynthia's to a friend, who has always used processed ingredients. Now they know an old french dish, done simply, has alot of appeal.

Good basic recipe. I minced the onion instead of making rings. Taste was bland - needs more seasoning.

Just what I was looking for! I took some small suggestions from other reviews; diced onion,  pouring sauce in layers, and the addition of garlic. The result was spectacular! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

We loved these potatoes. I diced the onions instead of slicing them and mixed some cheese with a little bread crumbs to add on top. I also took the cover off for the last 15 minutes to brown it up. Delicious!!

1st time I have ever made Au Gratins from scratch and they were perfect! 5 stars because: this recipe was easy and called for ingredients I had on hand plus it was "company worthy." Definite keeper.

Good recipe.  My only mistake was adding extra cheese on top (my mistake, not the recipe), which made it a little greasy.  Overall very good though!

I make this all the time now...it's great.  The only change I made was to chop the onions, instead of the larger sliced rings. It will look a little greasy and runny when you pull it out of the oven, I just stir it in the dish and that quickly goes away.  I also had no cheddar cheese tonight and made it with shredded taco cheese blend and it tasted the same...whew!

This hit the spot!  There is no way this would all fit in a 1-qt casserole though.  I used a 1 1/2-qt and only 3 potatoes and it was filled to the rim.  I did add some black pepper and garlic powder to the sauce...my preference.  Otherwise, just what I was looking for.  COMFORT FOOD!

Made a few changes as per other reviews. No onions (my boyfriend isn't a big fan) I doubled the sauce and added extra cheese. I used some freshly grated parmesan in between the layers, added a little fresh rosemary and fresh ground pepper so it wouldnt be bland as others had complained, and crushed cornflakes on top for a bit of crunch. My boyfriend loved this recipe and he isn't a huge potato fan, he is excited we have leftovers for tomorrow. Will definitely make again!

This was so incredible! I am used to the boxed version of this dish, so making it from scratch was a huge treat. I did not change the recipe at all, aside from removing the foil about 15 minutes before the potatoes were done. That way, it developed a golden-brown top. The dish was creamy, cheesy and delicious!

This recipe rocked! I didn't have cheddar on hand, but I did have 4 cheese Mexican blend. And it still came out awesome. I removed the foil within the last 10 minutes and sprinkled with a little extra cheese and chives. WOW!!! WE'LL BE DOING THIS ONE AGAIN.

Delicious and easy to make. I sauteed 1/2 of a chopped onion in a pan before making the cream sauce. Added a little flavor without the onion crunch. A great side dish recipe.

I make this dish all the time for family gatherings (especially during holiday season).  It's delicious!  The only changes I have made is I add a little more flour for a thicker sauce and more cheese (my husband is a huge fan of extra cheese).  Great recipe!

These were VERY good.  Had them w/ some steaks and a salad.  I took some advice from a few other reviewers and I sauted the onions and some minced garlic butter.  I also took the foil off during the last 12 minutes.  I will definitely be making these again!

These were good. I served with ribs and a green salad. Was perfect together. It wasnt what I expected however, but that is only because of my Russian heritage. Most Slavic weddings we go to serve these delicious potatoes. They are cubed and in a really creamy, a little garlicky sauce which I have been trying to find the recipe for. When I saw this recipe and the picture of it, I was sure this was it. It was not. But I really like this recipe a lot and will definately make again, thanks a bunch!

Great! Slice the onions very thin or saute them a little bit first...otherwise they may be a little undercooked.

Oh, so yummy by far.  It did cut out the onions though and just added onion powder.  I also added in some fresh dill and garlic powder too. My husband is hovering over the leftovers now.

I made these potatoes tonight and they were awesome. The whole family loved them. I did change it up a bit. I added minced onions along with the sliced and cooked the potatoes in a little boiling water for about 7 minutes to shorten cooking time. Didn't want them too done to where they would fall apart. Then added some garlic powder to the cheese sauce and a little more salt and pepper. Also I put in half cheddar cheese and half american cheese. Also I realized I was out of flour when making these and just used 2 tablespoons cornstarch to the milk before adding it to the pan of cheese. Worked great!!!

Doesn't get any better than this!  I did layer the cheese sauce in between each layer instead of just on top. Super cheesy and wonderful.  Did take a long time to bake, but was well worth the wait!

Very good comfort-food recipe. I much prefer 'chopping' the onion than rings, and adding extra sauce to make it really creamy/cheesey. I often add chopped ham and a little cream cheese.

I love this recipe but I do change it just a little. I leave out the onions as my children don't like them and instead of 1 1/2 cups of cheddar cheese, I add one cup and then also add some American Cheese (Using Kraft singles is quick and easy). It adds creaminess and turns out really great!.

Wonderful!  The grandkids loved it.  Even my husband (who doesn't care for potatoes) said it was a keeper.  I used 2 cups of cheddar because we like things cheesy.  I also added diced, cooked ham for a one dish meal.  It was great.

This is good recipe that I made a few minor changes to. The first change that I made was to dice the onions instead of cutting them into rings. The second change I made was to add diced Jalapenos. Before you judge let me explain. If you d-seed and d-membrane the Jalapenos, it cuts the heat factor way down and adds an awesome flavor. I got the idea from a dish that is served at a local steakhouse. Other than those two changes I made them according to the recipe. Highly recommended.

I doubled the recipe for a group of twelve, using 5 lbs. of potatoes & two onions.  Next time I will add garlic to the cheese sauce... this time I sprinkled cayenne pepper on the top & would do that again for the extra flavor.  They were a huge hit!

I made these last night as a side dish for grilled marinated chicken and fresh green beans.  My family and I enjoyed it but I think I had a problem with the oven temperature.  I used a 2 quart 8x8 glass pyrex dish sprayed with cooking spray and my potatoes burned on the bottom.  It did not affect the taste of the dish, but there was a thin black crust on the bottom and around the edges.  The potatoes were creamy and tender and the sauce was easy to make.  The only change I made was that I sprinkled thyme along with the salt and pepper on both layers of the potatoes.  I will make this again adjusting oven temp to 350 degrees.

This side dish was very tasy! I did not use the onions though, as I thought they might overpower the dish.

My family and I liked this dish so much I made it twice in one weekend. It's very easy to keep the sauce smooth and creamy by adding the milk slowly (as should be done for all creamy sauces), and if it gets to thin I just add a touch more flour.

Delicious! I will certainly be making this again. To cut down on time, I threw the potatoes in the casserole dish, covered with water and microwaved for 8 minutes. It cut the cooking time in half!

I thought it was a good base recipe, but it really needed some zing.  Maybe a little pepper jack, or a sharper, more flavorful cheese.  I almost tasted like mac and cheese with potatoes.  I will use it as a base again, but will make some upgrades!

Sorry but I won't be making this again. The only thing I did differently was reduce the amount of onions. The dish was burned on the bottom and up the sides, and the cheese curdled giving it a grainy texture, which is not what I expected from the title. It was also a bit dry. Maybe I'm just cursed when it comes to making cheesy recipes. Thanks anyway!

The only changes I made to this was adding some extra cheese (about 1/2c to the sauce and a bit extra sprinkled on top)and a bit of garlic to the sauce. I decided to make them in a greased 9x13 pan instead of a casserole dish - will now always make make potatoes that way - much more even cooking and nice browness on the bottom) I removed the foil about 15 minutes before they were done to get that yummy golden top. These are great comfort food, can't wait to have the leftovers in my lunch tomorrow. Hubby actually had 3 helpings at supper!  Will definitely be making these again!

These potatoes are soooo good.  I did alter the recipe a little. I added 1/2 tsp more salt, because to me, potatoes always absorb the salt, so I added alittle extra.  I followed the recipe the way it is printed.  I noticed that when I added the sauce to the top of the potatoes, I had to shift the potatoes alittle so the sauce would not run over the pan.  I also used the reynolds non stick foil, (good move) and also put the dish on a cookie sheet so I wouldnt have a mess (glad I did).  Next time, the ingredients are perfect, I'm glad I doubled the salt, however, I will layer the potatoes with the onion, but I will put some of the sauce over the potatoes, then do another layer of potatoes, then top with the remaining sauce.    These were the best homemade au gratin potatoes, my boyfriend 2 helpings and said they were the best.  Leftovers microwaved, just as creamy.  Try them

I gave this three stars only because it was too much onion in there for me. My husband however loved it! He thought it was quite good with the onion. lol. Next time I make it, I'll trim down on how much onion I put in there. :)

This is the best potatoes au gratin scratch recipe I've ever tried. With some recipes, it can be hard to get the right consistency and texture for the sauce, some recipes make lumpy, thin or overly floury sauces but this one nails it.  It's a cheese sauce, but it's more creamy than cheesy.  This helps it hit the right balance of flavors.  It's not flashy or spicy, it's just good, melt in your mouth comfort food.  You can add more cheese if you want it, crumble bacon on top, or add some chopped chives, garlic or green onions.  You could make a crust with bread crumbs or corn flakes.  It's perfect just the way it is, or it's a great starter recipe to personalize!  I love it!  The only downside is waiting for it to come out of the oven!

Very very yummy!  I halved the recipe and a 1 quart dish is just perfect for half.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe itself, but when layering the potatoes and onions I also added 1/2 the cheese before doing the second layer.  I also sprinkled a little extra sharp chedder on the top for good measure.  When there was about 10 minutes of cook time left I removed the foil so the top could brown.  Next time I will add some garlic...or bacon...or both for a little twist.

These are nice, mild-tasting, cheesy potatoes. Because I can never leave well enough alone, I layered in some sliced tomatoes and added a pinch of garlic powder. The bottoms of the potatoes browned a little too much despite being on the top rack, so I would suggest decreasing the oven temperature to 350. Went well with barbequed steak and a fresh salad. If I were to make this again, I would definitely add in a 1/2 cup or so of sour cream after the cheese to give it a slight tang that I felt was lacking. Thank you for an easy, cheesy! base recipe.

Delicious potatoes. I grated the onion, as I have a family member who doesn't like to find it in anything, but otherwise followed the recipe almost exactly. I was roasting meat at a different temperature, and since I lost the argument over installing double ovens when our home was built, I had to adjust the cooking time accordingly.

Can I say NEVER, NEVER, NEVER buy boxed au gratin potatoes again!  These were outstanding!! The best part is I had everything in my kitchen!  My husband immediately went back for seconds and my son, couldn't get them out of his mind so he ended up eating the tiny bit of leftovers a few hours after dinner.  I used about 7 med - small potatoes, and only changed the sauce by adding about an additional 1/2 cup of shredded cheese.  I really didn't think the potatoes would cook in an hour and a half, nor did I think the milk would give the potatoes enough of a creamy taste but glad to say I was wrong, they were fabulous!  Will definately make again and again.  Thanks for a recipe that is so easy yet better than most!

Creamy au Gratin Potates were an excellent side for a Ham dinner.  I did not use all of the cheese sauce as it would not fit into the casserole dish.  This may be because I used a mandolin to slice the potatoes and there was no room for the sauce to get between the paper thin slices of potato.  I had cut the potatoes so thin, thinking it would ensure they would cook thoroughly.  Next time, and there will be a next time :-) I will do as others suggested and "layer" the sauce onto each layer of potatoes. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this recipe with the "cheese and a half" sauce suggested by a reviewer and without the onion.  The texture and taste was good but the sauce was slightly flour-y.  Next time I make it I'll do a cracker or bacon bits topping and up the seasoning to include garlic.  Otherwise, tasty and satisfying.

This is the best recipe I've ever tried, and I have cooked up many a dish of au gratin potatoes.  I tinkered like many, sauteed the onions prior to pairing with postatoes, and cut smaller slices, quarter rings.  I added one additional cup of cheese and poured it over each thin layer of potatoes.  I added the bread crumb topping and cheese on top.  It sounds like a lot of changing but it isn't...the base recipe is fantastic!

This turned out great! I made it for an Easter gathering and it complemented the ham nicely. It was also gone quickly! I doubled it and made it in a 9 X 13 pan. I had to put a pan underneath it because it started to overflow a little as it cooked, so will probably put it into 2 separate pans next time. I used 11 medium sized potatoes for doubling it, and I also chopped my onions instead of keeping them in rings since my kids are sometimes picky about onions. This is a great side for jsut about any meal! Thanks for the recipe.

Yes, indeed, this IS how AuGratin should be.  I used Red potatoes, and left the skin on.  Mixed the sliced onion with the Potatoes rather than layering. Put in half the mixture then covered with half the sauce, then again ... this IS yummy. Thank you!

By far my son's favorite!  When he was little, he wasn't a fan of finding onions in his food, so I would grate the onions.  It still smelled and tasted great, and he loves them still!

I followed the reccomendations of cooking the onions first and adding bread crumbs as a topping. Love this, it goes over great whenever I make this. A keeper for sure since I make this regularly.

This came out good, but you must use REALLY small potatoes!!!  I used only four, and 1-1/2 times the sauce, and my TWO quart cassserole was full to the top!  It also wasn't quite done at an hour & 1/2.

Made this last night and loved it. Used EMILY91183's suggestion and upped the cheese to 3 cups along with adjusting the milk and flour. I just need to make sure to put a little sauce on the bottom before potato's so they won't brown so crispy. Will make again and again.

My family loved this recipe, however, I added garlic powder to the sauce, as well as the salt and pepper. Also, after I put the first layer of potatoes and onion in, I poured half the sauce over it; the othe half went on top. After 1:20 cooking, I removed foil and sprinkled more shredded cheese on top and let it brown for 30 min.

Don't change a thing about this recipe!!!PLEASE! The cheese sauce is what sets this recipe apart from all the others. Keep the onions, no need for bread crumbs, it has just enough sauce and cheese. This recipe has changed my life, never will another au gratin taste as good as this. It's been a given at every family function for years, that if I didn't bring it I would probably be banned for life! The only thing I might add on occasion is some garlic powder or paprika to the cheese sauce. Use four very large russets, or 6-8 smaller potatoes.

We just about ate the whole thing in one sitting! I started my potatoes and onions w/o sauce in the microwave to speed up the process, about 10 minutes. Put tin foil on top for first 30 minutes to not get overdone, then took it off to let brown. Added some paprika on top, AND YUMM YUMM!!!

Quite tasty but I'm looking for a stonger taste. Maybe next time I'll double the sauce and add some sour cream, garlic powder, onion powder, minced garlic, butter crackers on top, and/or French's Fried Onions. I think these additions would make the flavor that is more desirable for me and my family.

This dish was tasty, and sooooo easy to make.  My family loved it, so I will make this again.  I did make two changes to the recipe.  First, I did not use the onion, since my husband dislikes them.  Instead, I used 1 teaspoon onion powder and added it to the cheese sauce.    Second of all, instead of the 1 1/2 cup cheddar, I used 1 cup shredded cheddar and 1 cup shredded colby/jack combination in the cheese sauce.  I baked as directed, and it turned out marvelous.    I

I have now made this dish three times and have always been happy with the results.  This last time however, I decided to give the dish a kick by adding in hot sauce to the cheese mixture (I do the same with my home made mac and cheese) and the dish turned out even better.

This gave me multiple mouth orgasms. Man. The time it takes to bake is well worth it. Added salt & pepper & garlic powder for spices on the potatoes. The cheese sauce was a mix of sour cream & milk, heated up until blended, add cornstarch to thicken, then add cheese. SOOO GOOD. I'm gonna go have seconds now.

This is fantastic and fantastically easy!  I'll be making this again, for sure.  Only change I made was I didn't use as much onion as called for.  My shredded cheese was a 2-cup bag of "casserole mix" shredded cheese.  Yum!  The sauce was good enough to eat all by itself.

Shallots people, shallots!  When you don't want a big onion texture or taste, use shallots intead of onion and slice very very fine!  YUM!  This is a hit for all!  I have some guests who don't eat meat but love cheese and they made this a meal.  Good tip to remove foil at the end and bread crumbs add a little texture to the top.  I will make this again and again.  ( I never did buy the boxed au gratin since I knew it wouldn't be as good as scratch, call me a food snob)

1 onion, finely minced::::

Oh my gosh, this was the best I have ever had!  I did a couple of things differently - 1) sauteed some chopped garlic, onions, and bacon in butter and added to the layers, 2) as someone else recommended, I made an additional 1/2 amount of the sauce (1.5 x recipe), and 3) boiled the potatoes about 2 minutes to cut the cooking time down to about an hour.  I took the foil off and sprinkled more cheddar, parmesan, and paprika to top off.  It was delicious!

These were a big hit at Christmas! I added a little more shredded cheese (I used sharp cheddar) & sauteed the onions in a little butter before layering in the pan. Yum! Thank you!

I omitted the onion and used a sharp cheddar cheese. The dish took more like 2 hours to bake before the potatoes got tender, but it was well worth the wait. I also sprinkled Parmesan on top and cooked uncovered for the last 10 minutes or so.Delicious and my family thanks you CathyM!!!

I get compliments on this dish EVERY time I make it.  It has a nice mild and comforting flavor that goes great with anything, but if you want something more intense, try a more intense cheese like sharp cheddar, or irish dubliner.

We made this recipie with olive oil instead of butter and it turned out great and did not miss the butter.  Also we used white cheddar, yellow cheddar, swiss, and panela cheeses.  Instead of melting the cheeses in the sauce, we layered the cheese with the potatoes.  Awesome!

Easy AND delicious - what could be better?  Afterwards, I realized that (for the future) one could add a pinch of cayenne OR a pinch of rosemary...ham, whatever.   This is a great recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

This was amazing! For those saying that it is bland, use flavorful cheese!  Since there are so few ingredients in this recipe, every ingredient counts so if you want a flavorful dish, you have to a) use flavorful cheese and/or b) add spices.  If you want to just use cheddar, maybe try adding some cayenne.  I think that this is an important thing to keep in mind.  I made more sauce than listed as I thought that I had more potatoes.  I guessed on the cheese and used some left-over tex mex mix, parm and a hard smelly cheese.  It was delicious!

This was perfect!  Not too cheesy, just right!  I only had one potato and was cooking just for me and my daughter so I rescaled the measurements and it was the perfect amount. I also boiled the potatoes and sauteed the onion in olive oil ahead of time because of time constraints.  Thanks for the recipe!

I just used this recipe for a side dish on Thanksgiving.  It went over very well.  I took some reviewers advice and made some changes.  I minced 1/2 the amount of onion and sauteed it with some butter before adding it.  It was just enough without adding an onion-y taste.  I also added a small amount of crumbled pre-cooked bacon to the layers of potatoes.  About 4 slices were perfect

My first attempt at homemade! They were wonderful and tasted better than my granmother's.  THANK YOU! I did add a little extra cheese and microwaved the potatoes first, and they were wonderful. Thanks for sharing the recipe. Definitly a keeper.

This is worthy of 10 stars!  Only changes were to add garlic powder and to chop the onions instead of slicing them into rings.  Oh, and I added a small amount of Velveeta cheese, not that the sauce wasn't cheesy enough, just experimenting, I guess.  Thank you for a fabulous side!

Very good...nice and cheesey and hot, just like comfort food should be. I also minced the onions and sauteed with garlic, then added throughout the potatoes. It was delicious that way. Oh, I only used 2 large potatoes, but the same amount of sauce mixture, and it was really good and cheesey. I think it might be a little dry if I had used 2 more potatoes as the recipe calls for.

Very very yummy!  If your family doesn't like onions, leave them out!  They are very prolific in this dish.  My family doesn't like onions so after dinner there were piles of cheesy onions on everyone plates.  They do give a nice flavor, so if you want that mince them.  Delicoius and comforting!

This is a great comfort food dish.This creamy, cheeses potato goodness, bring's you back to the home cooking your grandma use to make for the holidays. I usally dice the onions and tried adding some fresh garlic, but the recipe really doesn't need the extra flavor. The simple ingredients make this dish great comfort food.

Wow! I wish i could give this six stars!!!! These are the best potatoes I have ever had! I can't wait to serve them at a party or potluck! The only thing I did differently is dice and saute the onions prior to adding them to the potatoes and I added garlic powder while cooking them. I also cut the potato slices thinner because I like really soft potatoes. These are great, great, GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!

Very tasty! I omitted the onions and added some garlic and onion salt, cayenne pepper, and parsley. I doubled the recipe and had plenty of sauce for my eight small-medium potatoes-and I like my potatoes saucy! Baked in a 400 degree oven for 45 minutes covered, 30 minutes uncovered. It gets four stars because it still needs a little *something*, but I'm just not sure what. I'll definitely be making these potatoes again to find out, though!

Tip: Buy a mandoline to slice the potatoes! They are relatively inexpensive and will save you LOADS of time!

This one is a great "starter" recipe.  I made it for 15+ people and tripled the recipe.  I added finely chopped onion, nutmeg and garlic o the cheese sauce, and layered the sauce and the potatoes. It needed a lot more salt than I anticipated.  Note to sefl-more salt next time.  I baked for 45 with foil on top, and then 25 more to brown without the foil, worked like a charm!

Recipe is great as is, but I substitute 1/3 of the milk with half-and-half, add a shot of hot sauce and 1 tsp garlic powder to the sauce.

These potatoes were great.  I made them almost exactly as stated in the recipe and YUMMY!! I changed it up by adding some monterey pepper jack cheese with the cheddar. My son liked them so much he was licking the casserole dish afterwards.  This was a hit with the kids.  Thanks for the recipe!!

These came out wonderfully.  I used my stand mixer with slicer attachment to cut the potatos.  I did use a little velveeta with the cheddar to make it extra creamy.  I don't think I will ever make the box kind again.

Great recipe. It turned out really well which is saying a lot for me. I have trouble getting Au Gratin potatoes to not dry out in the oven. I left the onions out based on another review and I have to say that was a mistake. I gave the recipe 5 stars because I think if I had added the onions it would have been perfect. With out them its only a 4.

Great recipe, very simple in ingredients. I chop my onions and sautee with butter and fresh garlic. I layer the sauce in between layers of red russet potatoes and add black pepper and bacon salt! YUM! I also let it broil on the top for a crusty cheesy delight!

It was my first time making homemade Au Gratin Potatoes, and they turned out absolutely perfect! The only things I changed were sauteeing minced garlic with chopped onions (instead of rings), and added more cheese...I think total I added close to 3 cups, and it was great! My boyfriend definitely wants me to make these again :)

I love this recipe with a few changes that I just my taste. I leave out the onion and add a half of a teaspoon of cayenne pepper. We like our food with a bite to it. However this is great as written.

I thought this recipe was delicious!  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because it needs something a little extra.  I added garlic powder and fresh parsley, but I think some bacon or broccoli would have made it even better - not as traditional, but very good!

A good family friendly recipe.  Kids loved them: "best potatoes they've ever eaten." I thought they were a little bland so I added some Montreal Steak seasoning to my serving.  Will make again but will experiment with add'l spices.  I agree with the other reviews: better on day 2, would remove foil for last 10 min to brown the top, and recommend chopped onions instead of rings.  I used the food processor to quickly slice potatoes thin and also chopped onions in there.  Made for quicker prep.

This recipe turned out absolutely wonderful. The sauce was thick and creamy, and did not separate or get runny as some other have said. Toward the end, I sprinkled the top with extra shredded cheese and took it out of the oven once the cheese browned (you can never have too much cheese!)

I kept kept the recipe almost exactly the same, except that I let the sauce simmer for quite awhile and also added just a small amount of extra flour (heaping tbsp).

I will definitely be making this for the rest of my life!

My family loved this recipe. However, I did change it slightly. I minced the onions (we are not big onion lovers) and I also added a parmesian cheese and italian bread crumb crust. I just mixed half parmesian cheese with half bread crumbs and then added about 3 tablespoons of melted butter to give it a golden look. I put the mixture on top of the potatoes for the last 15 minutes of cooking. I also used colby and monterey jack cheese for the sauce (only because I already had it shredded), but it tasted great. Thank you, It was a hit!

This was my first attempt at making Au Gratin Potatoes and was surprised at how fast and easy it was.  I used a different mixture of shredded cheeses and a dash of garlic powder.  So yummy and comforting--better than I expected!

I made these to go with my ham for Easter. They were very tasty. I used a sharp cheddar which I thought worked out perfectly. My only complaint, which was my fault and not the recipe, was that they were a bit too salty.

I have made this several times over the past few years - without changing anything - and we love it. I would only clarify for first-time makers - if you use 4 LARGE Russet potatoes, like I do, you'd better use a 2 qt. casserole dish, or it won't all fit. I also place the dish on a cookie sheet in the oven, in case it bubbles over a little. This is a great recipe! Thank you...

Very good - initially made exactly as listed, but became worried it would be too bland.  Added some hungarian hot paprika and Italian style bread crumbs to the top to add a little flavor.  My husband gave it the thumbs up and requested I make it again.  May try other reviewers suggestions of adding Worchestershire and/or garlic on the next try.  Though I think it might be a little bland for my family's taste as written, I realize people living in my region (the Southwest) tend to like more spice than other areas of the country, so I gave it five stars.

I made some changes. I always feel weird reviewing a changed recipe, but I don't make many recipes as they are written. So I don't know what to do about that. 

I minced the onions, added da garlic claove and sweated the onions and garlic in a Tablespoon of butter. 

I mixed the sweated veggies in with the cheese sauce at the very end of making it. 

I added some Crushed Corn Flakes over the edges of the top in the last ten minutes of baking and a little paprika for color. 

This is delicious and my family loved it.

This is an amazing dish!  I made a few slight changes: I use 1/2 cheddar and 1/2 pepper jack, add minced garlic, add ham chunks, and use dry minced onion because everyone in my family dislikes fresh onions.  FANTASTIC!!

The only change to the recipe I made was mincing the onions, and I didn't add salt or pepper.  The sauce wasn't as smooth as I'd hoped, but that could have been my doing.  
Next time I make this, I'll be halving it, as there's only my husband and I to eat it.  The full batch lasted us four nights.

I made this exactly to the recipe and it turned out great.  When I was putting in the onion I was thinking it was too much, but it cooked down great and actually added a bit of sweetness.  I will definitely make this again.  I think it'd be great with some bacon or chopped ham added to it.  A good basic recipe that could be changed around a lot depending on what you want to do with it.

I followed most of this recipe but only difference I made use 1/2 of an onion and chopped it instead of using onion rings, I also added 1 chopped garlic clove.  This was pretty good but just a little bland, my husband kept saying that it was missing something.  If I were to make again I would add some different spices or maybe bacon pieces.

This was very easy to make. It was a nice change from my usual mashed potatoes. I also took the advice of others and sauteed the onions before adding them in. I added some garlic powder and topped with breadcrumbs. Next time I will probably add some grated cheese to the top as well. My husband loved it he would give 5 stars. I rate it at a 4 it wasn't amazing but it was good. I will make again.

This recipe was exactly was exactly what we were looking for. I followed the directions of other reviewers and diced the onions, added a little garlic, sauteed them and made a roux and then a cheese sauce for the potatoes. I thought the dish had a great subtle flavor, complementing the main dish of our meal instead of overpowering it. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

i usually always give 5 stars from the recipes ive tried, but this was so so. honestly it was a great starter recipe. maybe green onions would be better. towards teh end of cooking i took the foil off, added bread crums and parm cheese. made for a nice crispy top. Wont make again though.

Very simple.  the prep took me a little longer than anticipated... i always hate peeling potatoes;).  But worth EVERY minute!!  they were delicious and i will make them again.  I did add some garlic powder and next time i will scatter onions throughout because i like the flavor.  Thanks!!

Can't get a better stand-by au gratin recipe.  The food processor made quick work of slicing those potatoes.  I doubled the recipe and used a 13x9 Pyrex dish.  I added a tsp each of garlic powder, cracked pepper and dried parsley to the cheese/milk mixture before pouring it over the potatoes.  I did overfill the pan and the cheese bubbled over and onto the bottom of my oven... and is now a huge mess, but that's not the recipe's fault! :) You will enjoy these, so give them a try.

Easy easy easy, yummy yummy yummy!  I dice the onions instead of slicing them (I don't like to watch my guests struggling with their manners trying to slurp up limp, cheesy onion rings), these potatoes turn out perfect every time, I've made them to go with everything from pork chops to roasted chicken to Sylvia's Ribs from this site. A definite keeper!!!

I saw this recipe and was in a bit of a panic when I saw 1 1/2 hours of cooking time when I needed mine to be done in less than half an hour!  

So, I modified.  I "baked" the potatoes in the microwave.  Then, I added 1/2 t garlic powder and 1 t onion powder to the sauce to save some time.  Also, a few grinds of fresh pepper and 4 dashes of salt.  I sliced the potatoes, then covered them with sauce and sprinkled an extra 3/4 cup of cheddar on top.  Placed it in the oven while I was baking the glaze for our ham on just to lightly brown the top.  Everybody loved it and I was very happy I modified this recipe to meet my time constraints.

I made this side dish to go with baked ham yesteday.  The flavor was WONDERFUL and what a nice change from baked or mashed potatoes. 
I agree with another reviewer, the sauce did take some time to thicken but well worth the wait. I used 5 medium sized potatoes and the dish was very creamy.

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was delicious! I didn't change very much. I chopped the onions and sauteed them with a little minced garlic before layering it on the potatoes. I also steamed some broccoli and layered it right along with it. It was gone in no time at all!

I rate this one five stars because the end result was delicious. I sauteed my onion (finely chopped) in butter before adding it to the potatoes and used only half the amount called for in the recipe because my hubby is not a big fan of onions. I think this helped to mellow the flavor somewhat. The sauce took a very long time to thicken but turned out great in the end. These were a big hit with Christmas dinner and make good leftovers too. Thanks for sharing.

This was by far my best attempt at Au Gratin potatoes.  I did change a few things as other reviewers had suggested.  I used 1 cup whipping cream & 1 cup milk and I added 1/2 tsp. onion powder (since I omitted the actual onions) and 1/2 tsp. garlic powder to the flour. You will def. need to use a 2 qt. dish.

So easy, so good! I made it the night before and cooked it for an hour, just leaving time to heat up the next day.

Slight variation: added a bit of parmesan cheese, and stilton blue cheese!! DELISH.

Served it with a glazed ham, and a candied pecan pear and blue cheese salad.

Easy, great, and all natural ingredients.

I made this for 20 people in a roasting oven. It was amazing! I also sauteed the onions with garlic before adding them to the potatoes. I also added 1 cup of 3% milk to make it more creamy. Everyone loved it.

I've been looking for a good au gratin potatoe recipe for a long time. My family loves them.  I slice the onions into 1/4 rings or smaller instead of rings.  Great recipe...worth the little bit of extra time it takes to prepare.

Wow!!! These were excellent. I think they may even go in the holiday recipe box! Next time, I may mix the cheese mix in with all the potatoes instead of just pouring on top. Also, you need a little bit bigger casserole dish than a 1 qt.

These are the BEST Au Gratin Potatoes i've ever had! I've made this six times already, and am making it again tonight. The only changes I make are to mince the onions and add a dash of cheyenne pepper for a slight kick. I never have leftovers on this one. I will never make any other kind again!

I love this dish! I too minced the onions instead and I sauteed them with a little bit of minced garlic. I also added a handful of fresh cauliflower and brocolli florets in the middle. I will be making this one again!

According to my boys these were AWESOME!  I don't know why so many people said they were bland, my family loves spicy foods but I've always thought that au gratin potatoes were supposed to be cheesy not spicy.  I would suggest using a cheese that you really like.  We used colby jack and it was great.  For a little spice try adding some pepper jack in with the cheddar.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were excellent. I made them when we had company over for dinner and was proud to serve them. The only extra I added was some sour cream. They may be a little on the bland side, but some salt and pepper does the trick.

This recipe was very good.  I'd probably rate it a 4.5. I used cheddar and colby cheeses. It was very easy and came together quickly. Make sure you salt the potatoes before you put them in the oven.

The first time I tried to make this, we were having problems with our oven... and these never made it to the dinner table.  New oven now in place... I decided to try again. I cut down the recipe because I only had 3 small potatoes in the house... subsituted the onions for onion powder and crushed garlic... and these were SO yummy!  A great comfort food!

The best potatoes au gratin recipe ever! I have made this at least 50 or more times in the past 9 years since the first time I made it, so I decided to update my review.  You just cannot go wrong with this comforting dish.  I have served it as a main dish to vegetarians, as a side dish with meat, at parties, and at regular-old weekend meals.  Children love it, as well as older people, and everyone in between.  I never use the onion, but otherwise pretty much follow the recipe.  I do usually adjust the recipe to make 6 servings, so that everyone gets enough.  I just eyeball the cheese rather than measuring, and it's probably a little bit more than the recipe calls for. If I don't have enough cheddar on hand, I often use a bit of monterey jack or pepper jack in addition to the cheddar, which makes a very creamy sauce.  Using a mandolin to slice the potatoes means you can get this dish from start to into the oven in about 15-20 minutes.  It's a winner and has definitely gone into my family "archives"!

So my fiance and I had this amazing potatoes au gratin dish at a local restaurant, and my goal here was to find a recipe that sounded as if it was pretty close to what we had there. This recipe is pretty close, having the same really creamy texture. I followed the recipe exactly this time, but next time I make it, I will definitely add more cheese. I also think that a sharp cheddar would serve better than the mild that I used this time. Also, I hate that it says salt and pepper to taste. I won't know the "to taste" part until after it's cooked, and this time it had nowhere nearly enough salt. I did add in five pieces of bacon crumbled mixed into the layers. That was tasty, but next time I think I will add more bacon. Great basic recipe though.

This was just the recipe I was looking for. I wanted something without processed cheese. I used green onions instead of the yellow rings and i did pre boil my potatoes and slice them chip style. I also added garlic. Very very good

These are excellent au gratin potatoes!!  Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the extra step of making the white/cheese sauce.  But honestly that's what made it special.  Diced the onion instead of slicing and used slightly fewer than the recipe called for, but they were really good!  Will definitely make again!

This is the first time making gratin potatoes.  The recipes calls for ingredients I had on hand so it was very easy to prepare.  

We enjoyed it immensely.  This dish had enough flavor and you can taste each ingredient, the potato and onion kept its texture but was soft enough.  

I thought that adding chopped bacon would give this dish extra flavor and might try it next time.  

The waiting time is the hardest part of the recipe--you have to smell the dish cooking in the oven with the aroma swirling in the room.

OH MY GOD!!!  I doubled the recipe due to my larger family and even with as much as I made, it was gone before the end of dinner!  I have to say this is the best au gratin recipe I have ever come across!  I followed the recipe although I added an extra cup of cheese and diced the onions.  EXCELLENT!

Tasted good- but was a bit bland.  I took the suggestions of a reviewer and sauteed the diced onions with garlic.  Next time I will add paprika and maybe other spices to kick it up a bit.

easy to prepare with items I always have on hand. I made this ahead of time, kept it in the fridge and put it in the oven when the time came.

Absolutely perfect, exactly what i was looking for! i was trying to make them like the ones i used to get from Bill Knapps, so i cubed the potatoes instead of slicing them. I also used 2 cups of cheese and sprinkled the top with bread crumbs. sooooooo good! my family fights over the leftovers :D

Excellent!  I added a bit more cheese (we like things very cheesy) and topped it with paprika.  It was delicious!  I did read the reviews and uncovered it for the last 20 minutes and it was perfect!  Thank you very much!

My family really loved this recipe!  I added a little more cheese than called for since we like things cheesy, but other than that I followed the recipe and it turned out great.  I didn't quite cook it 1 1/2 hours though and it done and getting dark on the bottom.

Make sure you thinly slice the potatoes so they all cook evenly. I found the sauce a little runny. Overall the flavour was good.

Very good. I had to leave it in an extra 10-15 minutes. Also removed the aluminum foil the last 15 minutes. Turned a gorgeous brown.

This recipe was very easy to make and it tasted really good. I should've read some reviews (I usually do) before I made it, but I was in a hurry. It did seem to be missing something - more salt, for one. Plus, I think extra sharp cheddar plus some garlic powder and maybe seasoned salt would've also helped. I will definitely make this again, with those additions. Overall, very good. Family loved it. Barely any left.

AWESOME recipe!!! I had a recipe like this years ago that was given to me from a friend's grandmother and i had lost it and I have been searching for this recipe for many years!  Thank you so much for submitting the great recipe and I encourage everyone to try it, and to use Sharp Cheddar like another person said - it makes the potatoes!once you try this recipe you will never use any other Au Gratin recipe again!

These were really good, but I would recommend increasing the oven temperature so they don't take so long to bake and taking off the cover during the last 20 minutes or so to let the top get brown and crusty.

I have the Allrecipes cookbooks and mistakenly made this dish before reading the reviews online.  I would definitely take the foil off at the end to let the top brown, otherwise you end up with a unfinished looking dish. I used the Kitchenaid slicer attachment for my stand mixer for the potatoes and it worked great. Also, if you heat your milk in the microwave prior to adding it to the roux, the cheese sauce comes together very quickly.  It was good enough, but the husband likes others better.  It's probably just a one-hit wonder for me.

It was good but a little bland, as mentioned before. I used mild cheddar cheese, & I think the switch to sharp would've brought out the cheesy flavor a bit more.

Made this las night for dinner and it was a hit. I did not have russet potatoes so instead i used 5 large red potatoes and I also added bacon and buttered bread crumbs to give it some added texture. Other than that I followed the recipe just as stated. It smells SOOOOOO good while its cooking :)

This is a really good potato recipe.  I served them with ham as part of our Easter dinner and they were a big hit.  I doubled this recipe to make sure that we had enough to feed 8 people and we had way more than enough.

These were good and easy to make, I just felt they needed more flavor, more pizazz.  In the future I might try adding garlic or something.  Still, they were tasty.

This was yummy, but mine came out a little soupy, perhaps because I changed the number of servings on the recipe.  Also, I think the recipe calls for large potatoes.  If your are smaller, you may need more.

Had this with Easter dinner and it was great. I took a few liberties, though to spice it up a little: Doubled the recipe, minced one onion, and sautéed with two cloves minced garlic, and mixed with potatoes. Added some thyme, some dried mustard, and a dash or two of cayenne pepper. I also added more salt. It was cheesy, creamy, and delicious.

Added 3 cloves minced garlic to butter and flour when making sauce (which I think made all the difference).  Also, sauteed onions before adding. I doubled the recipe but I didn't double the cheese and it was perfectly fine.  I would definitely make again.

I made these potatoes for our Easter dinner. They turned out wonderful! They were definitly better right out of the oven. I made these ahead of time, since i had to get the ham in the oven. When i tried to reheat them, they didn't look as nice. But i will definitly make them again! The only change i made, was i used 2 cups of shredded cheese.

I had last minute guests for Easter and I used this recipe as a guide to create my own recipe (as I did not have the exact ingredients).  I doubled the recipe and used the same amounts of butter, milk, flour and salt.  I used a bag of shredded cheese (6 cheese blend with asiago, provolone, cheddar etc).  I also added an 8oz block of cream cheese.  It came out WONDERFUL and got tons of compliments.

Followed the recipe pretty much, minced my onion, and did add crumb topping the last 15 minutes of cooking. Was nervous abut the 1/4 thick potatoe slice being completedly cooked, but they were fine.

Wonderful recipe; everyone loved it and some asked for the recipe.

Only change I made in the recipe: I didn't have a fresh onion so I used minced onion from a jar.  I'll try it with a fresh onion next time.

I wish I could give this 10 stars!  I had delicious leftovers.  I also mixed up the chopped onion throughout.  What is nice about this recipe is that it's creamy and delicious without being too rich, I've tried other potato recipes before that were just too salty and cheesy.  This is light, mild, and perfect!!

Tasty.  I chopped the onions instead, and added about 50% more sauce.  Great side dish.

Very good with a few changes.
Chop the onion and add 3 cloves of minced garlic. Saute these in a little bit of olive oil.
Once these are opague add your butter and flour.
I also added some asiago cheese to the cheddar prior to baking and when the potatoes were done to add some additional flavor and color.

These were fantastic!  I did finely chop the onions before I put them in the dish and I mixed them in with the potatoes.  This was so easy and so delicious!  I will be making this one a lot!

These are the best Au Gratin potatoes I have ever had.  The sauce has a nice creamy texture.  Family loves this dish!  Goes great with chicken or meatloaf.

Just OK, not worth making again. It was too bland, as others have said, even though I added a good amount of pepper and garlic powder to pep it up some. Even my potato-loving husband said it wasn't that great (first time I can remember hearing that from him about any potato recipe).

Takes a while to cook, but it's pretty tasty.  I normally love onions, but next time I think I will omit them from this recipe.

Despite some rave reviews, our family felt that these were just okay. I tripled the recipe and baked as instructed. They ended up needing 2.5 hours and STILL were a little watery, not creamy! They also didn't taste very cheesy - the potato flavor was predominant. We won't have these again, as they were definitely not worth the effort.

This recipe is reliable and very good. It does take a bit of time, but it is worth it. I tossed in some leftover diced spiral ham and fresh peas for an easy one dish meal.

Very good recipe.  Great basic cheese sauce...nice & creamy.  I'll make this again, but will probably tweak a little and add some herbs or something to kick it up a notch.  This would be great with chopped ham & veggies as a main dish casserole.

Great side dish for a holiday roast. I say holiday because it's a bit on the high fat side, which probably explains why my family was practically licking their plates!

I have made these often, only I have never used the onions, I will next time after reading the reviews, I just slice my potatoes, then I par boil them about 10min to cut down on baking time. I make my cheese sauce as stated, using sharp and mild cheddar,I use more cheese than this recipe calls for at least 3 cups, I pour the sauce over potatoes and then bake. During the last ten mins of baking I top with cheese. Very simple and very good.

Magnifique!  I went looking for a homemade Potatoes Au Gratin and found this one a few weeks ago.  My family went crazy over it.  (add some mustard and you can make amazing mac and cheese.)  I just came back on to refresh my memory on how to make and had to review what we experienced last time I made this.  Nothing should be changed BUT maybe letting the top crust up under the broiler for a few moments.  Other than that, it is perfect as is!!!

If I could, I'd give this recipe 10 stars!  Easy to make, perfect flavoring, and my 11 year old extremely picky eating daughter absolutely loved them!  And, I love the leftovers!  Thank you so much for this recipe -- it's a regular in our home.

I have lots of potato/cheese recipes that are great but this is the only one that I would call "Au Gratin Potatoes".  It has the right flavor.  I used Gold Rush brand sharp cheddar.  It has a stronger taste than others, I think (which we like).  I mixed 2 T. parsley flakes in the sauce for color (might try chives, also).  Been looking for a long time for an au gratin recipe for potatoes.  Thanks!

We really loved this recipe! My fiance' never wants the boxed stuff again. I did make a few changes. I saw some reviewers complain about uncooked potatoes...easy fix. STEAM the potatoes first. I had new red potatoes, monterey jack, medium and sharp cheddar. I also added cayenne, salt and pepper IN the sauce. Layered already cooked (steamed) potatoes, onion, sauce, extra grated sharp cheese...and repeated until dish was full and topped with sharp cheese. Baked long enough to reduce sauce and brown top. It turned out GREAT. I will definitely make this again.

This was ok, kind of bland though.  I added extra cheese to the sauce and omitted the onions, as my finace doesn't like them.  Maybe thats why it was so bland.  He liked them.

Yum.  I had to use less onion than called for because it wasn't fitting in the casserole (a 2.5 qt for 8 servings), but it was still fantastic.

My husband and son loved this dish.  I did modify it some - I divided my potatoes into thirds and used two layers of sliced onion rings.  I sprinkled each layer with garlic salt and pepper.  Very yummy.

This was a great recipe. Big hit at the table! The only thing I did that the instructions did not say was to remove the pan from heat and then stir in the cheese. I used finely shredded which worked great.

These were quite plain. They were creamy, indeed, but I've had au gratin potatoes before that were much better than this. I think I'll try another recipe next time.

This recipe was pretty good. I used less milk then called for because I wanted a really thick cheese base. I also used a combination of aged cheddar, and McCormics cheddar, the one that come in that red tub. It was really good. Had a nice strong cheese flavor. I also used about 2tblsp of Dijon mustard for a little zing. Very good!

We really enjoyed these potatoes. They went really well with the ham. Left overs tasted great too.

i made this classic au gratin potato dish with grilled steaks as part of our valentine dinner. no changes made aside from using sharp cheddar & heating the milk in the microwave before stirring it into the roux. my potatoes needed the full 1 1/2 hours to cook through. thanks for the yummy recipe, cathy!

I doubled the sauce mixture, per other reviews, and also sauteed the onions with some garlic.  I took the foil off about 15 minutes before, but could probably take off even sooner, as my husband likes it more burnt on top.  Excellent recipe, and will definitely make again!!

I read some of the reviews before making this so I sped up the process by precooking the potatoes in the microwave first.  I also removed the foil for the last fifteen minutes and the potatoes were a beautiful golden brown.  Besides being a little too watery, I thought the taste was pretty good.  My husband, however, thought they were just OK, too runny and bland.  I had leftovers the next day for lunch and I thought they were even better than the previous day.  Perhaps the trick is to let them sit for a while before serving to see if they will thicken.

These were really good. Followed the recipe to the letter. Only one problem they took way longer than the 1 1/2 hrs allotted. Someone help me out here. I doubled the recipe. Should I have doubled the time too? Do they need to be in a shallow dish? I will definately make again but maybe use a 9 x 13 pan.

So easy and really good. I was looking for something easy to use on frozen shredded potatoes that would please my kids and this is perfect.  It only took 20 minutes using the frozen shredded potatoes from the bag.

My family loves these potatoes.  I used my food processor to slice the potatoes.  Definitely a time saver. I followed others advice and used a mix of cheeses.  Definitely a keeper.

Great recipe! I used a sharp cheese like another reader suggested and only used 1/2 an onion, chopped instead of sliced. I used 1/4 cup of heavy cream with the rest of milk and it still could use a bit less liquid and a bit more cheese, but overall a great recipe!

These were good, but nothing special. It seemed to be lacking a little something, but I couldn't quite place what. More spice, maybe I needed more pepper. Still, we didn't *dislike* these potatoes, and they were made a lot better when we mixed in our baked beans. We were full afterwards, so that counts for something.

I am not unaccustomed to Potatoes Au Gratin, but I've never followed a recipe before.  This was fantastic.  I made sure the roux was thick enough before pouring it over the potatoes.  

I served it with prepared horseradish on the side, which was received very well.

Yum and delicious! I was looking for some recipe to get rid of the 20 pound bag of potatoes my boyfriend bought on sale and I think we found it! He had grilled steak while I had vegetarian meat loaf with this and a nice big salad. It was great! Thanks so much for the recipe.

Delicious.  I sliced the potatoes and onions thin on a mandolin, which reduced the cooking time to 30-45 minutes.  Also, I used parano cheese to make the sauce, but any sharp or pungent cheese would work well.

this dish was excellent, not bland at all. i made sure to put enough salt and pepper. the creamy sauce with cheddar cheese was more than enough flavor and bubbled up wonderfully, making this dish look professionally made!

Read 30 reviews before trying this recipe and was happy I did. Definitely will be bland if the following additions are not made: 1)sauteed onions/garlic before layering on top of potatoes; 2) use mozarella and mild cheddar cheese together; 3) add chicken boullion; 4) add dill or fresh parsley. I baked at 350 w/ rectangular glass container for almost 1.5 hrs before removing foil and baking for another 1/2 hour. Was a hit at the potluck last night! Don't forget the salt and pepper. I maybe will consider boiling potatoes a bit before baking to cut down on baking time.

I had family over for dinner tonight and I tried this recipe out for the first time. Everyone said the potatoes were really good and I thought so too. It seemed to take forever for the butter, flour, milk mixture to thicken but I figured it was because I used skim milk. I just added a little flour to thicken it.

I really enjoy using this as a base recipe - I add fresh crushed garlic, lots of pepper, 1/2 tsp chicken bullion and a dash of cayenne to the milk mixture. I do not add the cheese to the milk mixture, rather I top the recipe with cheddar and parmesan cheese and a sprinkle of paprika for a greast presentation.  For extra flavor add cubed ham or fresh parsley. Its a great recipe!

I made this last year as a side dish to bring to my family's Thanksgiving dinner.  It's now the night before Thanksgiving and I had to come back to AllRecipes to get the recipe again, because I was told weeks ago that "YOU NEED TO BRING THOSE CHEESY POTATOES AGAIN!!"  :)  These potatoes are seriously delicious - I used sharp cheddar cheese, and it gives it a great bite.  Chopped fresh parsley on the top adds a bit of freshness and tastes great.  I was a little unsure of the onions when I had initially made it, but it "makes" the dish - it's so savory and delicious.  A sidenote:  if you're concerned about the calories, try fat-free milk and reduced fat cheese.

You'll love this if you like extremely rich, mild flavored dishes. It's a great basic recipe and I'll use it again but with modifications. I'll definitely ditch the onion altogether, reduce amount of milk and spice things up with curry or dill or ground coriander. And for crispy crust I'll sprinkle some cheese on top and bake it uncovered for last 10 minutes. My husband love it the way it was though and asked for more;-)

They were good and I would make them again, but there was nothing about them that would really want me to make them again and again....

Awesome...I loved it.  I added fresh parsley (I grow my own because I use it so much) just for some color and to cut way down on the cooking time, I cooked the potatoes ahead for about 10 minutes!  Then I only had to cook the dish for about 30 minutes!

Not too good. I added extra cheese, which may have part of the problem, but it had no distinctive flavor. I even added extra salt and pepper 15 minutes before it was done, but it was still ordinary. I used an 8x8 glass pan and the bottom was getting overdone. It takes too long to prepare for everyday eating.

Really good! Make sure you let the milk/flour/butter mixture get as thick as heavy cream before adding the cheese.  I used 2 cups of mozz/cheddar mix and the sauce tasted like stoffers mac and cheese sauce.  Definately use a 2 quart casserole.

UPDATED!!!

I made these again not realizing I had made them before and didnt like them.  The only thing I did different the second time was that I used half velveeta, half cheddar - this was an amazing side for Easter!! So glad I didnt realize I had made this before and disliked it! I must have really messed it up the first time!!

I thought this recipe was great, with a few changes.  I used leeks instead of onions- makes it better for the kids.  Also, I added chopped parsley for color, red potatoes mixed with the russett ones, and used a bit more cheese.  Warning- do not prepare the night before and then cook- is very soupy!

Delish!  Next time I will use less onion, or use a sweet onion; the onion flavor seemed a bit overpowering to us.  Also added some red pepper flakes and garlic powder to the cheese sauce for some extra zip.  I will be making this recipe again, and often!

I made this for Easter last weekend and it was great.  I added a bit more flour while cooking the cheese sauce to thicken it and used extra sharp cheddar cheese.  It was wonderful - everyone had seconds and I've received many requests for the recipe!

These were really simple to make and turned out great. I did have to uncover the dish for the last 20 minutes inorder for the cheese sauce to thicken and not be quite so oily looking.

Delicious!  I had made one dish excluding the onions.  And one with the onions.  The dish without the onions, was good, but seemed as though it was missing something.  So, even if your not an onion eater, this dish is so good, you won't even notice the onions.  I think they added just the right touch to make this recipe perfect.  I served it with Easter Ham and buttery glazed carrots.  Extremely good, I will definitely be making this dish again.  I think it would be great with Pork Chops.

I give this endless stars. Extra sharp cheddar with a heap of garlic and some real bread crumbs makes this dish. Time consuming but absolutely worth it.

This is especially good using Sharp Cheddar Cheese.  Everyone asked for seconds.  I've made a lot of Au gratin potatoes and it's the Sharp cheddar that makes it especially good.

This is still in the slow cooker cooking, but if the way the sauce tastes and the smell are any indicator, this is going to be yummy.  I sautéed the onions with 2 cloves of garlic before adding them and I added some fresh basil I had on hand to the sauce.  I think I added more cheese than called for too.  The little taste of sauce I tried was heavenly.

WOW! I thought this recipe was going to turn out awful because when I was making the cheese sauce it never really thickened up. However, this was one of the best "can't mess this up no matter how hard you try" recipes! Thanks Cathy!

Interesting the way reviews recommend this recipe but also propose to change it.  It's good for that -- start here and edit to your own taste.  I would reduce the onion by a lot.

I made this recipe for Christmas dinner and it was delicious and fast to make. I used our food processor to slice the potatoes and onions (what would I do without it?). I used grated Cheddar/Jack Cheese and crumbled some leftover bacon from breakfast into the potatoes. The cheese sauce was a little bland for my taste. It needed a little something, so I added some nutmeg which made a big difference. Next time I will experiment with different cheeses. Taking the foil off earlier to brown the top was a good idea.

Easy, delicious and now a special, holiday favorite of ours.  This recipe has become a Holiday staple in our home.
I start with frozen cubed potatoes to expedite prep time.  I use sharp cheddar to enhance flavor.  No onions needed in this dish, it just seems to take away from the flavor instead of improve.  I do, however, add garlic to the cheese sauce.  
I layer the potatoes, sprinkle with less than 1/4 cup of shredded cheese, top with some sauce, add another layer, more shredded cheese and then sauce and then repeat one more time.
I'm often tempted to increase the servings but I know the more we have the more I'm tempted to eat.

Thank you for the few years I've already been enjoying this delicious dish.

12/10 - peeled and mic'd a few potatoes, whipped up the sauce and tossed in the potatioes before baking so every potato is surrounded with that savory, cheesy yummy good sauce.  :-9

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner and it was a big hit!!  I chopped the onions fine and used 2 cups of finely shredded cheddar/monteray jack cheese.  I will slice the potatoes thinner the next time. I would also recommend taking off the foil around the 1hr mark. If you let it sit for a while after it is done, the sauce thickens up!  Very easy to make...will definitely make it again!

This is a tardy review, but we made this for Easter with a ham recipe and it was delicious.  It is a good compliment to any meal and so very easy.  With a a house full of people, we had time to visit and enjoy the day!

My whole family, including the 2 year old, loved this dish! I made just a few additions to suit our preferences. I used Tillamook sharp cheddar cheese, put salt and pepper on each layer, and added a little garlic salt to the cheese sauce. I used 4 smallish russets and had plenty of sauce, but it definitely needed a 2 qt. casserole. About 15 minutes of baking without foil helped give the potatoes a finished look. They were great hot from the oven and also reheated the next morning. I will definitely be making this recipe again! Thanks!

I rated this recipe 4 stars because I feel the cheese sauce is a little too bland.  I followed the directions exactly as Cathy wrote them; I also took the suggestions of others and added some garlic powder, onion flakes and more salt & pepper to the layers of potatoes. During the last 15 minutes of cooking time I added precooked bacon bits.  I will definitely make again but will try to season the sauce with extra salt, pepper, maybe some garlic and a little white wine. We all liked these potatoes but agreed that the cheese sauce could use some pepping up. OH...I doubled the recipe, cooked for 1hr 45 min and the potatoes were perfectly done. Thanks for a good recipe, Cathy.....

Yummy!  I will definitely make this again, but I plan to use one less potato than the recipe calls for...so that there is more sauce to go around for the potatoes.  I also add chopped fresh chives.  Thanks Cathy. :)

Very good.  I doubled the recipe, omitted the onion (my dad hates them), and added a little cayenne for a kick.  Even though they take a while to cook, the prep is still pretty quick and easy,so definitely a keeper!  Thanks!

Excellent!  It takes a long time to cook...but its well worth it.  I'm in Louisiana, so I added some cajun seasoning (Tony Chachere's--mandatory down here) and it was great!

I doubled the recipe and used a larger casserole dish.  It took the same amount of time.  This was really good and very easy.  I will definately make this one again.

Very good! I use extra sharp cheddar cheese and lots of fresh ground pepper to give it an added kick.

I sliced the onion very, very thin for those in my family who don't care for it and they didn't even notice it was there.  We had it as a side-dish to fried chicken and mixed vegetables and it was perfect.  The recipe also made enough that I'll be able to refrigerate the leftovers and have them for lunch tomorrow.

Absolutely delicious.  I added cooked turkey bacon (crumbled) between the layers and it just added more flavor to an already wonderful recipe.  Thanks Cathy

I used Kraft 2% Sharp Cheddar cheese...the dish was very bland. I'll try again with real cheese and see if that helps.

I've been looking for a really good au gratin recipe and now I've found it!  I took the advise of other reviewers and used sharp cheddar for a little extra zing and added garlic and onion powder to the sauce.  It was great!

Thanks for a great recipe!  I made them for Thanksgiving and again for Easter, they were a big hit with all of the guests.  I wouldnt change a thing and will definitely be making them again.  I have 2 small children who are extremely picky eaters and they too loved them.

These turned out very nice, and went over well at Easter dinner today.  Kids and adults ate seconds.  I did have to leave out the onions to please all the picky eaters in the family, and I really think they would have tasted good in this.The only thing I will change is next time I am going to put more cheese in it.

Easy to make!  Boyfriend loved them!  I will take suggestions from others and use other kinds of cheese and maybe some garlic and spices.  Good flavor, but I would have preferred a little more "cheesiness"?

The preparation was very easy, it's the baking that takes a while.  My husband and I had this for dinner and it goes so perfectly with fried pork chops.  A simple but delicious dinner altogether.  We didn't change a thing.

I left out the onions, because none of us like onions.  Before putting the potatoes in a dish, I tossed them with garlic, pepper, and a bit of cayenne.  The sauce was just perfect for the amount of potatoes.  I will be making this again and again.

I liked these, boyfriend did not. I added generous amounts of garlic powder and salt, Tabasco, asiago, cheddar, and jack cheeses. I substituted buttermilk for the milk--and my boyfriend still thought they were bland. I thought they could have used additional seasoning, on top of what I had already added, but they were edible.

Update...2017.  These continue to be a favorite. We use the Mexican bkend of shredded cheese and cook in the oven for several hours.  Taste is great.

Wow!  There were only three of us at dinner and they were all gone.  Truly like they had baked all day.  Thanks for a great recipe.  It is a keeper!

Definately a keeper!  The husband was a HUGE fan.  I added a little cheese on top at the end.  Thanks for the great recipe.

These were good - a bit bland.  Maybe some garlic powder in the cheese sauce.  I did like them though and will make again... with a few additions.

These were the best au gratin potatoes I've made.  Very easy and turned out wonderful.  I made them with bbq chicken and they were a good combo.  This is a keeper.

I increased this from 4 to 6 servings & served it to family & friends with a tender brisket cooked on the grill.  Everyone loved it!  I will indeed serve these potatoes again.  Very good mellow flavor with just the right amount of onion.

These were delicious!!!!! I made them with my Easter dinner and they turned out fabulous. My only complaint was that I left them in too long and the top got a little burnt. But, I will chalk that up to high elevation cooking. It was "operator error" on my part and not because of the recipe. I will definitely make these again and again.

Delicious!  I chopped the onion and added a touch of green onion for color.  Also, I added cubed ham (leftover from Easter dinner) to make it more of a meal.  I just can't imagine going wrong with this recipe.....but DO use a bigger dish!  Can't wait to try it again with a different type of cheese and maybe take another reviewer's suggestion on using red potatoes.

This was a very good recipe. I omitted the onions (children won't eat anything with onions) and added some garlic powder in it's place. I also used more pepper. My husband and children loved it.

Very easy and quick--
It makes a lot---and doesn't cost much to make.
It also warms up well for leftovers too.
I also used a mix of sharp cheddar and monterey jack cheeses and cooked it longer for more of a top crust--great results!

I used leftover boiled potatoes and leftover ham
sharp cheese and white onions doubled the recipe
and cut the cooking time in half.everyone loved
it, add veggies and you have a complete meal, so 
easy it should be illegal.A great way to use up
your left overs and good enough to impress your
guests

This is a great recipe, I have been making a version of it forever. To bump it from a side dish to a main I add 1 package of chopped keilbasa. Every male that I have ever cooked it for has begged me to show them how to make it!

This is a great recipe.  The onions layered inside, along with the cheesy sauce make this dish incredible.  I found it easy to prepare and even easier to eat!  My boyfriend has already made me make it 3 times in less then a month! Thank you!!!!

This was really tasty and easy.  Even my finicky kids liked it.  However, it was A LOT of sauce for 4 potatoes.  I cut the milk down to 1 1/2 cups, the butter and flour to 2 tbsp. each and it was still pretty saucy. Next time I will use either an extra potatoe or bigger potatoes.  Great family recipe.

My boyfriend and I LOVED this dish!!!  We used 6 vs. 4 potatoes and nearly ate the whole thing.  I rated it 4 (just to leave room for something that MAY be better) but my boyfriend was 5+++.  WIll definitely be making this again and experimenting with more, different types of cheese and possibly meats, broccoli etc.

This recipe was a little to creamy for me, the sauce didn't seem to thicken at all. Maybe a little more flour would help. It still had excellent flavor.

These were delicious, mild and creamy potatoes.  I didn't believe that they would take 90 minutes at 400 degrees and tried to remove them from the oven after on hour.  They potatoes DO need the full 90 minutes to be cooked to the right soft texture.   Note: Cute the potatoes on the thick side, and the onions on the thin side.  Next time, I may combine in another type of cheese as well as the cheddar (i.e., smoked gouda, or monterey jack) for added flavor.  Overall, this one is a keeper. Will definitely make again and again.  I think it would be great with ham or pork. I made them with orange honey garlic chicken (the recipe on this web site - also delicious!)

Delicious recipe! I had to make it in a 2 quart dish though. Tweaked the recipe a bit, added an extra 1/2 C of cheddar cheese, 2 minced garlic cloves, and a dash of chili powder and paprika.

This turned out very well. I used a 2 quart casserole dish and I am glad I did. There is a lot of cheese sauce.

I modified this recipe  trying to tailor it to one of our favorite side dish from Killkenny's Irish Pub in Tulsa, OK.  First, I parboiled the potatoes. Next when making the roux it is always an even mixture of butter and flour. I went 6 tablespoons of each. Then I added approximately 2 cups of milk. Then I slowly stirred in two cups of KerryGold Dubliner Cheese, added about a dash of garlic powder, a dash of cayenne, and salt and pepper to taste. Once my sauce was done, I poured over the potates which I had previously chunked up and folded the sauce into in. Covered dish with aluminum foil and cooked at 400 degrees for approximately 30-40 minutes. BTW, I did add about 3 tablespoons of scallions. Nothing over-bearing.

I was really hoping to find a recipe that tastes similar to the box. (I know its lame) But there is something about those cheap potatoes. They do taste good just not what I wanted. If I make again I will use onion powder instead of the slices. The onion flavor didn't make it all the way through.

Comfort food at its best!  This was so close to the Au Gratin potatoes that my mama made back in the day.  I had some leftover ham that I added in, and it was so good!

I made this recipe with all ingredients suggested except I cut it back to about 75% which fit into a 1.5 qt. casserole dish to perfection.  I was tempted to add more cheese but I stayed in the author's lane within recipe guidelines and the taste was absolutely delicious. I did cook at a slightly lower temp at about 75% of time required, then let the dish sit on top of the stove along with the glass cover while my bbq ribs were getting close to a wrap while cooking low and slow for about 30 mins.  Placed back in the oven at 400 for 20 mins then lifted the lid to get a browning effect for an addt'l  15 mins. Let me tell you, this dish turned out great and the onions cooked down to where they simply enhanced the flavor of the dish. I will be making this again for certain.  It's that good and the advantage over store-bought-packaged is control over sodium which makes it a hit for a carb-based side dish with a reasonably small amount of cheese plus I used non-fat milk. No guilt and hands-down comfort food that is safe to consume within reasonable portion control on a fairly regular basis.

Easy to make, and really delicious.  I made a smaller portion than the recipe and kind of winged the measurements, but it's hard to go wrong with such a basic recipe.

NOt full of flavor, but very easy and fine for a weeknight.  My purpose in commenting is that I always wonder when people post recipes for some number of russet potatoes.  Russet potatoes come in a large range of sizes.  You hnave to apply an amout of common sense and guessing to come up with the amount of potatoes.  I feel experienced to be able to get it close enough, though I did think I had too much sauce. Something wrong with weight for potato measurement to help getting the sause ratio right?

Delicious!  I agree with others who recommend chopping the onions.  Another suggestion:  while melting the butter in the saucepan, measure the milk and warm it in a microwave oven.  This step speeds the process of constantly stirring until the sauce thickens.

Great recipe!  I did make 2 changes.....  I added 1lb.  of diced ham and increased the shredded cheese to 2 cups.  I layered the potatoes, onion slices and ham at least 4 times in a 4 quart casserole.

I made this recipe but after reading everyone’s comments I changed it quite a bit. First of all I doubled the recipe and  used Yukon Gold Potatoes.

I read it was bland so I added herbs, mustard, Worchestershire, garlic, a little chicken broth and bacon. 

I read that the onions we’re a little much so I sautéed them in butter until they were well cooked. I sprinkled them between the potato layers. 

For the cheese. I used sharp cheddar, Parmesan, Romano, Asiago, Provolone and Cream Cheese. (Only 1 cup milk total)

I sprinkled Panko on top for the last 10 minutes of cooking. 

I cooked it at 350 degrees  for 2 hours and 15 min.

IT WAS PHENOMENAL

This is a excellent dish. I did make a small adjustment by replacing one cup of whole milk  with one cup of heavy cream. I wanted the cheese to be very creamy and it work perfectly. Definitely a keeper recipe.

This is my go to recipe for au gratin potatoes. Of course I made a few tweaks. I chop my onion instead of the rings. I also add a rope of Kielbasa cut up as well.  1/2 cup more milk and 1/2 cup more cheese :) yum

This is great, turned out perfect. I used three medium red potatoes and one medium white onion in a 1.5 quart casserole dish.  buttered the pan and lid, layered potatoes, onion, salt, pepper and parsley, some sauce, then another layer of potatoes and then the rest of the onion and sauce. for the last 20 minutes I topped it with some plain panko bread crumbs mixed with butter, olive oil and salt. baked at 375 until the last 20 mins, I turned it up to 425. put some extra cheese on top in the beginning. perfect! so good. next time I will take others advice to dice the onions, the rings are too much.

Made this exactly as written, and loved it.  Only thing is, do NOT put it in a 1 qt. casserole.  I put it in a 1.5 qt. casserole, and the cheese sauce boiled over.    Hot cheese sauce on the bottom of a hot oven is not a good thing... but at least I know for sure now that my smoke alarm works.

I really like this recipe. I LOVE onions so I keep them in but I slice them into small slices, rather than rings, and layer them with the potatoes so they are more incorporated into the dish. Also, I season every layer with salt and pepper. The only problem I am having is that the bottom always burns. Overall, it is a good dish with good cheesy flavor!

When the ladies in the neighborhood come up to you and tell you how much they love the scalloped potatoes your wife brought to the potluck, you know you have a hit.  They know I do the cooking in the house.  

I pretty much followed the recipe, but I used 5 large potatoes instead of 3.  I also seasoned it with coarse black pepper because I like the look of the pepper speckles in the potatoes and I also sprinkled a lot of coarse black pepper on top for presentation.  

Big hit!    :-)

This was a great recipe! I had to make it gluten free due to allergies in the family.  So, I used cornstarch mixed with cold water (instead of flour) and whisked it into the melted butter. I also skipped the onion. Everyone loved it!

Used a mix of a little cheddar (1/2 c) in the rue and grated about a cup of Jarlsberg and sprinkled it between potatoe layers and on top.  Super yummy!

I made this for a holiday party and received compliments on it.  I sliced the potatoes on a mandoline using a very thin setting. I also added ham and nearly doubled the sauce.

I was skeptical thinking it wouldn't have much flavor but was pleasantly surprised. My oven runs hot so I baked the potatoes at 350 but followed the ingredients exactly. I only had to bake for an 1 hr and 10 min before testing the potatoes. They were tender. I turned the oven off and added a cup of shredded cheese to the top. My husband loved them and ate two large portions. Will make again.

Really good! First time making potatoes au gratin and it turned out great. I might just make a 1/4 cup more of the sauce to make it more saucy but it was a hit & my parents loved it, especially my dad, as he is a potato guy. Followed it to the T,  and it served well with our prime rib. I’m going to make this potato dish a future staple. Thanks!!

It was good, but not amazing. I feel that it’s missing something, to me it’s almost bland....or like a very one dimensional flavor. It’s probably just my palate...I don’t know how else to explain it. However I gave it 4 stars because the recipe did turn out well :)

This side dish was a hit for Christmas dinner with ham. I made a few changes based on other recipes for a little more flavor. I sautéed onion and 1 minced garlic clove in butter and added to each layer of potatoes. I also used white sharp cheddar and 1/4 cup Parmesan for cheese and topped with bread crumbs. YUMMY!

Christmas potatoes to go with rib eye roast. Perfect. Used 6 yukon gold potatoes.  Diced the onion and added in the sauteeing before the cream and roux. Made the cream sauce with 2 1/2 cups of half and half, a stick of butter.  Used up the leftover cheddar and then grated 1/3 lb gruyere from fridge. Baked two hours with roast and took off aluminum foil for the period the roast was resting for a toastier top.  Young and old loved it - possibly more than the roast!

This recipe turned out amazing. I made a few changes. I omitted the onions and added powdered onion granules to the roux. I also made an extra half portion of the roux for a more creamy effect. My roux did turn out super thick so I added a good bit of whole milk to make for better consistency. All in all it was a super easy recipe to follow and I will add this to my special occasion side dishes.

This was a winner for the full family.

Edits:
cracker barrel extra sharp yellow cheddar, block cheese - grate before use

sub heavy whipping cream for milk

add salt, pepper and paprika while making cheese sauce. Add a bit at a time and taste as you go. 

sautee onions with olive oil. cut onion to your own mouth feel preference.

Add layer of cheese after first layer of potatoes and onions. Then add remaining potatoes and pour over remaining cheese.

add minced chives and chopped bacon on top, just before serving.

Slow-cooker directions: double recipe, easy on the salt, cook on high for 4 hours.

I made as described, but I used heavy cream because I didn’t have any milk on hand. That made it incredibly creamy, so it was a happy accident.  I also sautéed the onions before adding to the casserole because we don’t really like onions. Great recipe and we ate it all!

Great basic ingredients, my changes: 
#1 No onions, used onion powder 
#2 Used seasonall salt & pepper (I used liberal amount)
#3 Sharp cheddar cheese & used extra to top dish
#4 Added sauce between each layer of potatoes
#5 I baked at 375 for 1 1/2 hour covered  (spray foil with cooking spray so it doesn't stick). Then 30 to 45 minutes uncovered till golden brown. It is worth the extra time!!
Excellent.... creamy, tons of flavor & wonderful as a leftover!

I made for a holiday meal and people had 2nd and 3rd helpings until there was just a tiny bit left. 
I modified as follows- Tripled the recipe, precooked the sliced potatoes by boiling 10 minutes, added 1 tsp garlic powder and 2 tsp dried mustard to cheesy sauce.

I've made this before and its always a hit. Great way to use up leftover holiday ham or anytime you want an easy dinner.  I like to use onion powder or puree my onion because I have picky eaters who think they don't like onion but when it's not present they don't like the food.  haha!

These were delicious but I should have listened to the reviews about the onions - while I love onions, the rings made it very weird (that is the only way I can describe it) Next time I will try slicing the onions up into small pieces as I am sure they help add to the flavor, but the rings did NOT work in this dish. Other than that we all loved the flavor and creaminess :)

I have made this twice now. The first as written, which we didn’t care for the sliced onion. The next time I just Finely  diced a half an onion and sprinkled it in layers. Much better.
I also used half cheddar half Swiss! Delicious

Sooooo delicious. I seasoned the potatoes lightly with salt, pepper and garlic salt.  I used a three cheese blend of sharp cheddar, mild cheddar and white cheddar.  I baked it at 375 for an hour and a half and it was perfect. Yum!!

I made these last night and followed the directions except for using onion powder instead of onions -my husband can't eat onions.  I followed someone's suggestion to pre-cook some in the microwave to cut down on oven time. These were excellent and I will be making again.

I agree with other reviewers that onion rings are too big—better in these potatoes when diced. Also, if I make again, I would double the cheese recipe and layer it in the middle and the top. I found the bottom half of potatoes to be pretty bland.

Not sure if I'm missing something, but it turns out pretty bland and the sauce part has a weird lumpy texture to it :-( Tried 3 or 4 times now since it had such good reviews, but I'm moving on to a different recipe now.

I will make this again.  It was very good.   I used half and half instead of milk.  Only change for next time is that I would add cheese to each layer with the onions.  Other than that, all good!

First time to make gratin and it was great.
The only thing I changed was to chop the onions instead of the rings so my kids can eat it :).
Also I added mix of cheese and not only cheddar and it was great.
We loved it!!

I diced my potatoes and mixed the milk with some half and half because I needed to use it.  I mixed the cheeses for the same reason.  It was wonderful!  I will definitely make it again!  Thanks for the recipe!

A good recipe, but I made a few changes to add flavor. I used 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup milk vs 2 cups milk. Also added 1 tsp dry mustard, 1 tblsp Worcestershire, 1 tsp salt and 1 tsp pepper to the mix. Also added 1/2 cup of Monterrey Jack cheese. It turned out yummy.

Only reason for the four stars is because I followed recommendations made by other chefs. I diced the onions instead of leaving them in rings. I also layered the sauce in between the potato layers. I added additional seasoning to fit my family’s taste. I added garlic, fresh minced. Sautéed them with the onions prior to putting them on the potatoes. Also added a pinch of cayenne. Took this dish to a Banquet. Brought an empty dish home. Everyone raved about it. My family made me promise to make it again just for them.

Pouring the creamy cheese sauce over the top all at once worked fine. It worked itself throughout the dish in baking.

This was okay. Didn’t really care for the onions in the center. I would have liked cheesy texture throughout. Thought it would seep through or something but it really didn’t. First time making this type of potatoes. Bottom burned. Will change a few things or try a different recipe. This I s not a favorite for presentation but flavor wasn’t bad.

You can do so many things with this. One thing I do is I make a middle layer of chicken and broccoli and marijuana. Then top with the rest of the potatoes and pour on the milk and cheese and onions. Da Jam! Totally da bomb!

I made a couple of tweaks.  I thinly shaved some the white part of leeks.  For a garnish I used the green part of the leeks which I sauteed until tender.  

Used rice flour for a lighter mixture and used a compilation of cheeses,

Loved this!! I like a bit of a spiced kick to mine so add a dash of nutmeg and smoked paprika, really gives a great depth to the flavor! Also finely diced the onions as others had said... and used extra sharp cheddar. Regular cheddar is much to mild for me!!

I sliced  potatoes very thin let them soak in water for an hour to make them less starchy. Added 1/2 potatoes to pan, then 1/2 the cheese then repeated this to make sure sauce reached all the potatoes. I also doubled the cheese. I stuck with aged cheddar. So yummy we all loved it.

It was excellent and a simple recipe to follow. To kick the sauce up a little I added a little mustard powder and a little cayenne. It is definitely on my list to make again

Great Flavor! Easy to make. I did have to bake it longer than the recipe called for. I had three layers of sliced potatoes in a 11x17 glass baking dish with minced onions, and I doubled the cheese sauce and poured it over each layer. I will definitely make it again

Totally bummed. I followed directions to the letter. I prefer milk recipes as they don’t cuddle like cream. The 90 minutes at 400 left me with burned top and not sure it’s cooked inside.

I had 2 large potatoes and a large onion so the 1 qt  casserole   dish wasn't even close.  I started with a 1 1/2 qt  and soon gave that up for a 2 qt casserole. 

I  followed the recipe exactly and  my daughter and grandkids loved it. They are both picky eaters so to see them get second helpings made grandpa proud.

It's still in the oven. Sauce was very east to make. I used Velveeta and provolone cheese, topped with apple wood bacon. It smells delicious. I decided on bacon wrapped pork filets and homemade applesauce to round out a meal that my cardiologist would provoke him to drop me as a patient. I don't splurge that often but my husband travels a lot and wanted comfort food and home cookin'. He'll  have to get to cookin' after dinner for me. I will update after we eat for a pat on the back I will undoubtedly receive LOL! If for nothing else except he won't have to dine out. My husband likes Velveeta but I talked him into using real cheeses next time. I will use a combination of cheddar, provolone, and shaved Romano. I think that it would add better flavor when using real cheese. Overall this was a good recipe. I would just tweak the ingredients a bit.

I used extremely thin sliced opinions instead.  I was also out of cheddar cheese, so I used Kraft cheese slices with a dash of garlic  powder to give the cheese sauce extra flavor.  Next time I will add the cheeses sauce to each layer like another reviewer suggested.  Overall a good recipe.

My family loves these potatoes.  I added some minced garlic to give them more flavor.  Also be sure to slice the potatoes thinly if you want them to be ready in 90 minutes.

Absolutely awesome, my wife and I ended up skipping the rest of dinner and just having two helpings of this.  I always try to stay with the recipe instructions the first time.  Although I did some things not mentioned in the recipe, 1. I used White Irish Cheddar which I grated by hand to be a mix of mild and sharp.  I LOVE Irish White Cheddar, and I don't really think that is a variation.  I also used a stoneware dish so it developed a nice crust on the sides and bottom, and I removed the foil for the last 30 minutes so the top got browned a bit.  Next time I will use two onions because the onion was kind of lost in the rest of the recipe ingredients . Thank you Cathy!.

I doubled the recipe (doubles nicely), I added a ham steak to one half. It was creamy and tasted good, the family liked it.  I will make it again but I will play around with some spices to kick it a notch.

This tasted fantastic! I did sub half of the potatoes for sweet potatoes and sauteed my onions in the butter before I added the flour and made a little extra sauce and it turned out great!

Great recipe.  Slight changes.  I made two different pans.  One pan I added sour cream, bacon and green onion and it was so good.  That pan disappeared first.  I made it more cheesier and creamier in both recipes and added sauteed onion and garlic.  I normally do this with the box version but wanted to try with fresh potatoes.  I also added a little Velveeta cheese in my mixture when cooking over stove along with five different cheeses.

I used red  potatoes and layered half an onion  thinly sliced. I love the gouda in this recipe. The cheese sauce keeps this dish moist and creamy.

Easy to put together. I sliced my potatoes on a mandolin, sliced , onions really thin. Added a bit of garlic powder and some parsley to top it off. Will add more after the family tries it!

Wonderfully easy to put together, minus the darn potato peeling, and was probably one of the tastiest recipes for au gratin potatoes that I have had.  I increased the amount of the sauce relative to the potatoes but that's because I'm a sauce hog!  I then found mixing various cheddars was even tastier, as simple as mixing mild with sharp or go wild and try your ideas out.  Loved it!

This is a delicious meal.  I would suggest par  boiling the potatoes as they weren't done in 1.5 hours. I also minced onions and used 1/2 cheddar and half velveeta cheese.

Pros: Simple, easy and cheesy lol 
Cons: Needs more seasoning 
I added paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper and sour cream to the cheese sauce. 
I also bake mine in a sheet pan. That way every slice gets sauce and it cooked way faster. I simply lay the potato slices in rows, salt and pepper them, then cover with the sauce. Yummy!!!!

I doubled this recipe for Easter dinner. I cooked it for 90 minutes are 400 degrees, the bottom was burned and my potatoes were raw still. I would suggest cooking them at 350 and cover them for the first hour with aluminum foil. Also, I added way more salt then it called for and everyone add salt at the table.

I made it and it was very nice and tasty!  I made it again today and I added some flavoring which made it even better!  I tried to post the recipe with all of the additions but couldn't see how on the site to do that.  I used 5 organic medium russet potatoes. To the butter, flour and milk in the pan, once it was hot and thickening, I added: 1/2 tsp. Himalayan salt, 1/4 tsp. white pepper,  1 1/2 tsp. dijon mustard and a pinch (about 1/8 tsp. of nutmeg.  I was baking it in a separate dish with a small smoked ham at 325F for 95 minutes  in the oven, so the potatoes went in a casserole dish with the lid on and when the ham came out to rest, the potatoes went back in the oven without the lid under a low broiler for about 10 minutes so the topping was all golden brown.  The flavors all blended for the most delicious, scrumptious, creamy  au gratin  potatoes that I have ever tasted!  So, my rating is 4 stars without the seasoning and a definite 5 with the seasoning added!

I made this recipe for Easter dinner and everyone enjoyed them. 

They  were cooked in one hour so I'm glad I checked them or they would have been over cooked. 
.
I followed the recipe but added bread crumbs to the top for a bit of a crunch.

I will be making these again. Thanks for sharing recipe.

It tasted very good. I was worried about salting to taste, since I might be a little heavy on the salt, but my guests raved about the potatoes. I did use a little more cheese and chopped the onions. Next time I will try the slices.

Multiplied everything by 1.5 (except the onion) and it filled a 2 quart dish. Sprinkled extra cheese on top. Removed foil after about 1 hour 15 minutes, and increased time to 1h45m

Really good! I added rosemary. Used almond milk instead. I boiled the potatoes beforehand so i only put them in the oven for 45 minutes. Probably only needed to be in there 30. It was perfect.

DELISH!  Made for Easter brunch today and people LOVED it...such a winner dish!!! I took a few of suggestions and did the following: 
-onions - instead of rings, chopped them up to about an inch and a half, and sautéed them in butter with 2 huge cubes of minced garlic until mildly translucent. And then used them in between layers of potatoes. 
-cheese - white sharp cheddar, and used 2 full cups instead of a cup and a half.
-Pepper - I added a good amount of pepper in between potato layers and then I put salt and pepper on top before I added the cheesey top layer. 
-Definitely use a 2 quart dish, if not more.  We still had 1 1/2 potatoes that we didn't use.  
-Before going into the oven, added a medium/light layer of panko crumbs on top. So pretty! 
-Took the tin foil off for the last 25 minutes so it got some color. It was gorgeous.  (also, I put spray butter on the foil so it wouldn't stick to the top).

Perfect the way it’s written. But-I do chop the onions finely to make it kid friendly in my family and sometimes mix my cheddar (sharp, regular and medium).

Everyone loves these potatoes. We don’t use regular milk, we use almond milk, so that’s all I had when I made these. The almond milk does something extra yummy to these potatoes!  That’s the only thing I did differently and not on purpose. Delicious!

This was so good! I used chopped onions instead of rings and added garlic powder, but otherwise followed the recipe. It was a big hit with everyone who tried it. Will definitely make again and as another reviewer mentioned,  I will be using the sauce recipe with macaroni too.

Made as directed but left the onions out. This was a personal preference. I like the versatility of this recipe. You could change up the kind and amount of cheese added to the white sauce as well as easily adjust the amounts of potatoes. I would recommend using lots of sauce if you adjust amounts of potatoes be sure to adjust the amount of sauce. This comes together easily but be sure to allow the full amount of cooking unless you enjoy crunchy potatoes.

I buttered my dish really well. Still burned on the bottom. My husband liked it but It was just ok to me. If I made it again I would use extra sharp cheddar and wouldn't cook it on such high heat.

I made the recipe as instructed. The sauce, for me, was too thick. Potatoes are a natural thickener so next time I will use less flour. I added a little paprika for flavor and they were pretty good.  A quick, easy recipe.

Would absolutely make again. Maybe some more cheese and less milk but still a 5 star side dish.

This is a fantastic recipe!  A person feels like they're eating at fancy French cafe instead of at their humble abode.  I was short on time, and knew 1.5 hours cook time was not going to work for my famished family, so I microwaved the sliced potatoes and onions for 8 minutes before adding the sauce and baking in the oven.  It was done in 50 minutes and so good.

this is my go-to potato dish anymore. Do yourself a favor and make the roux with wondra flour.  

I don't modify much except I do substitute various cheese blends for different flavors; mozerrella and mild cheddar is a good one, colby-jack works well too. Also I've used heavy cream, buttermilk and lowfat milk as well as evaporated milk, but I think Promised Land whole milk is the best choice for the proper creaminess.

I followed the recipe exactly, it was good, but could definitely be improved upon. 
I think adding extra salt, onion powder, minced garlic and other spices would really jazz up these potatoes.

This was so easy to make!  Not sure why I wanted this long to do it. Loved by everyone and has a nice flavorful cheesy taste to the potatoes.  I needed to add additional salt.

Amazing. I was concerned about the onion rings vs diced onions, but fear not! It turned out excellent! Wish I had read how long it would take to cook, though... slight oversight, I guess.

This recipe serves as a great  base. My family & I prefer more flavorful dishes. I use 2 cloves minced garlic to the butter before adding the flour. I also add about 1tsp ground sage, 1/2-1tsp smoked paprika, & pepper to taste. I have omitted the onions for 1tsp onion powder. With these changes my rating goes to a 5.

So tasty!

I used red potatoes. I think I had about 5 cups of sliced potatoes. I added a little more butter and flour and used 3 cups of milk and about half a cup of water and 2 cups of cheese and some garlic pepper. I put half the potatoes in and the onion, used about half the sauce, then added the rest of the potatoes and the rest of the sauce
I baked as directed.

My husband and I loved it!

In typical fashion I neglected to see if I had all ingredients before I started.  I did not have enough heavy cream or cheddar cheese.  I thought I had both of those.  I used the tip from "Comforting Scalloped Potatoes" and pre cooked the potatoes for 5 minutes in boiling water which cut down on baking time by 30 minutes.  I started with some Velveta and Munster cheese found the combination was a little bland.  I found some Queso Fresca in the fridge and added that.  It turned out really good. Since I was using some Velveeta I did not use any flour.  I had about 1 cup of cream so used 2% for the extra cup.  I basically changed the whole recipe, Sorry :(

These turned out great on my first try. My husband initially was not enthused but then he tasted them and really liked it!  Apparently he had only tasted the box mix ones before. We both really enjoyed how tender the potatoes were. I used a mandoline to slice the potatoes and I chopped the onions rather than slicing them.

I used yellow Yukon  with the skins on because that is what I had. Just  decreased the cooking time about 15 minutes. Much better than adding  flour, butter, and cheese separately. Best one I've used.

I made this for the first time for a family dinner and it turned out really good! Of course I made a couple of very minor adjustments. First I sprinkled a little salt and pepper in between each potato layer to insure it was seasoned throughout. Then I diced the onion rather than cut them into rings. I used two full cups of cheddar in the sauce. Then, when it was done I sprinkled the top with a little extra cheese and broiled it for a few minutes for a nice cheesy crust. I’ll definitely make these again!

Added ham cut into bite size pieces.  Layered the dish:  potatoes and onions, pepper (no salt since we have cheese and ham), ham bites, half the cheese sauce, and repeat.  Good cold weather food!

did not cook this long enough, so the potatoes in the middle were still a bit crunchy.  Definitely follow the time frame for cooking this dish.  The flavour was really good though, so would make it again.

My husband and I just love these creamy, cheesy delicious potatoes!!!!! I have done the quick version,(making layers of potatoes and onion, but in a microwave safe pan with greased pan and plastic wrap. 10 minutes later I just lift out the plastic wrap and put it in the oven uncovered. Half hour later and they’re done.

I precooked the onion (chopped) and a minced clove of garlic first in some butter, because I wanted to be sure the onion was cooked.  I live at nearly 7,000 feet and always have to "play" with au gratin or scalloped potatoes to make sure the thin slices all get done.  This recipe worked well for me by keeping the dish covered with foil for about  1 1/2 hours at 350, then uncovering for an additional 30 minutes at the same temperature.

Thanks!

I made this and it was OK.  I think the issue is there is too much milk for me.  When I make it again (and I will!) I will add 1 3/4 cup of milk and a little bit more flour.

Otherwise, this is great.  I used medium cheddar cheese but next time will use sharp.

Always a success!  Though I made it the first few times with just the sliced onions (even family that doesn’t like onion slices or rings didn’t mind the slices because they were so soft from the oven time) I have started chopping the onion and pre-sautéing with a little garlic to add more subtle depth.

super easy! Few changes next time I make it.  I would use 2 different cheeses, like cheddar and maybe parma cheese, I'd dice the onion and I am going to add garlic.  It cooked up beautifully and I sliced the potatoes thinner so it would be done in an hour - it was perfect.  I gave it 4 stars because we felt it was bland as the recipe is written.

Traditional dish, I believe, doesn't call for onions.  To my taste, au gratin should be more cheesy so I add about 1/2 to 1 cup more cheddar cheese.  Cook the dish longer for soft potatoes, maybe 2 hours.  If you make a thinner dish, you could get away with 1.5 hours, but a deep dish requires more cooking time.  Leave the tin foil off for the last 15 minutes to brown the top - will provide a wonderful flavor to the dish :)

Just made this dish in my Dutch oven for the first time and it is now my husband's favorite. My kids loved it too. I didn't really follow all the recipe because I felt it would turn out too bland. I sliced my potato very thin, so it only took 40 minutes to cook. I layered potato, ham, onion spirals. I kept going until I ran out of all the above. I then put salt, pepper, smashed parsley, onion powder and garlic powder. pored the cheese sauce on top (I used more butter, and more cheese)After it was done cooking, I sprinkled more mild cheddar on top and put it under the broiler for a few minutes until browned. Soooo good. I will definitely make this again in the future.

Made this for Christmas and really tasted fantastic. Husband and brother liked it very much. I used red potatoes for no reason except I had them. They were also great as leftovers fried up for breakfast.
One thing to add - use white onions instead of yellow.  Yellow tends to be more watery.  Plus I chop them instead of making rings

Absolutely delicious. I sautéd the onions in butter, garlic, salt & pepper. I also only used about half the onion the recipe called for but maybe because my onions were very large. I also chopped them instead of using the rings. Soaked the potato sliced in water until I was ready to use them. For the cheese sauce I substituted about a quarter of the recipes milk for heavy whipping cream. Put salt and pepper and sautéed onions in between each layer. Baked for 80 minutes covered and 30 minutes uncovered afterward. Note, I also made this for 10 people so I increased the recipe. So many compliments on this dish. Will definitely make again.

I used Yukon gold potatoes because that’s what I had on hand. I used a 1.5 quart dish, and it still bubbled over in the oven. Maybe I just used too many potatoes. But it’s a delicious recipe. We had it for Christmas dinner, and everyone loved it.

Love this recipe but knew i had to make some adjustments:
Want a quicker cooking time? Boil the potatoes longer prior to putting them in the oven. I hate Crunchy potatoes so I have To do this. 
2. Dice the onions, this is important because who wants onion rings in your potatoes yuck
3. Add more cheese 
4. Add more pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and chipotle.

First time I followed the recipe as is but this year (2018) on Christmas I used milk and cream and topped each layer with cheese. I am in NZ and I must say people loved it. Thank you for a great potato recipe ??!

It went beautifully, however, I do recommend making a little extra of the sauce.

my family loved this! I left out the onions and spread the cheese sauce between each layer to give an even amount of coverage - in short there were no left overs. thanks for the recipe!!!

No idea how anyone could get 1 onion, 4 potatoes, 2 cups of milk and 1.5 cups of cheese into a 1 QUART Casserole unless it's like the T.A.R.D.I.S. and it's bigger on the inside.  I filled a 2 quart to the brim.

Omitted the onion slices and opted for organic onion powder and organic garlic powder (to appeal to the young children who think onions are icky).  Added Havarti cheese to cheddar.  Very easy recipe and it a big hit at family gatherings!

Delicious and simple recipe. Being the cheese lover that I am, I almost doubled the recipe for the sauce and cover both the first bed of potatoes as well as the top one. I also replaced one cup of cheddar cheese for Gouda. My husband ate these like it was the last day on Earth. Success!

My husband has texture issues with onions, so minced them. Since I was warming a 10 pound ham at the same time at 325. So I let par boiled the potatoes for 10 minutes. They turned out amazing.

This is a nice recipe but I used a 2 quart dish and I sliced potatoes on mandolin 1/8 inch thick. They cooked much faster. Instead of onion rings I put them in mini-chopper.

Loved it! Very easy recipe.  I substituted the flour for almond flour. Also, I substituted one cup of milk for almond milk and the second cup of milk for sour cream. For cheese, I used a blend instead of straight cheddar cheese.

I made the recipe as written, and it turned out great!  Classic au gratin potatoes.  I used a mix of cheese that I had on hand - some cheddar and swiss - and it turned out really well.  I will make this again in the very near future!

I followed someone's suggestions in the comments, and chopped and sauteed the onions, and added some fresh garlic (also sauteed).  I made it in an 8"x8" glass baking dish.  I have made it several times, and every time I take them anywhere, this dish is a crowd pleaser!  Love it!

I made this for company and it was so creamy and delicious! I doubled the recipe, and made it exactly as written.  The only thing I would do differently would be to add a third of the cheese sauce to each layer before adding the next layer.  I poured it all over the top and had to lift up sections at a time to get it all in there. Because I doubled the recipe, I increased cooking time to two hours.

This was a big hit! I used extra sharp cheese and a little velveeta as well. After an hour in oven, I topped with crushed ritz cracker/melted butter topping. Returned to oven to finish baking. I loved the layer of onions. Top was nice and crunchy. Family loved it. Will make again!

I've made this recipe a lot. I use probably two to three times the cheese. I also add real bacon bits to the cheese mixture. I also sprinkle some on top along with some parmesan cheese. Depending on where the dish is going I may or may not include the onions. Very well received every time.

I didn’t have onion or I would have chopped it and cooked it with the potatoes. I used generic pre-shredded cheese and it still came out ok but it would have been way better to shred the cheese from the block. I did microwave the potato slices for 4 minutes and only baked for an hour. I added garlic powder to the sauce, layered the potatoes and just poured the sauce over them to bake. The flavor and texture was good.

My family LOVED these potatoes and my husband (with a very discerning palate)  said that they were the best he as ever had... I did par boil the sliced potatoes for about 7 or 8 minutes because undercooked potatoes have always been the nemesis of my potato casseroles. I omitted the onions because I wanted the grandkids to eat them.  It was perfectly done and very cheesy! Will definitely keep this one in my recipe arsenal!

Excellent. I’ve tried many scalloped potatoes This is the ONE,  yes, make an extra 1/2 of the cream sauce, yes chop and pre-sure the onions with at least 2 garlic. If you cut the potatoes less than 1/4 inch it will be done in 1&1/2 hours. LOVE

Maybe we just have Texas-sized potatoes down here but 4 potatoes was way too many for a 1-quart dish and as a result there wasn’t enough cheese sauce. Tried to salvage them and wound up throwing out half the potatoes and onion I’d cut up. We’ll see if it’s any good taste-wise, but I’d at least double the cheese sauce recipe for 4 potatoes. Almost ruined Thanksgiving.

I've made this recipe many times and taken it to pitch-ins. It's always been a big hit. The only changes I made were to: preheat the oven to 350 degrees instead of 400;  use a bigger casserole (I use 2 quart instead of 1 quart) so there is no spillover; to sprinkle the top of the potato mixture with paprika before putting in the oven (which helps brown the potatoes, which I like); and to bake for 1 hour instead of 1 1/2 hours. The last time I made this, I left the skin on the potatoes (after scrubbing them with a brush). Yummy!

Definitely mix in a bowl before you put in the casserole dish; for some reason Iayered potatoes and sauce. Feel free to mix your cheese; a previous reviewer was right about adding half a batch more of sauce!

This was a great and pretty simple recipe. I had to laugh when it said to put four russet potatoes in a 1-quart baking dish. That just wasn't happening. I put it in a 3-quart and it worked out perfectly. I kept the onions in rings, as the recipe suggested. I think I should have flavored the potatoes a little more; however, I was worried about the salt in the cheese. Next time I'll definitely add more salt and pepper.

Great cheese sauce recipe; use sharp cheese for flavor. I used less potatoes than it called for. Also added sautéed onions and garlic.

I left out the onions, I was out, and used mexican shredded cheese.  I added minced garlic and powdered onion, good flavor and needed an additional 1/4 cup milk  as the sause was very thick and had some oil pooling from all the cheese after baking...will make again

Great recipe! I used white cheddar and added about half a cup extra of it just to make it really cheesy - came out perfect. Yes will definitely make again, possibly for Thanksgiving.

Better than expected!  I changed the serving size to 6 and made it exactly as listed.  I read many reviews beforehand about cooking the onions and people adding garlic so I did take some of those suggestions.  I minced the onions (suggestion from reviews) and cooked them very little with half a clove of garlic.  I then piled them

Good basis.  For more complex flavor try this:  I sauteed chopped onions (skipping the sliced onions altogether)  in the butter and added a few thinly sliced mushroom, then a little minced garlic before adding the flour.   After pouring the cheese sauce over the potatoes, I topped it with dried bread crumbs and parsley flakes before baking.  Good enough to add to the holiday menu!

This recipe may take longer to cook than some other recipes but it’s worth the investment of your time.  (Baking time after prep is 1 1/2 hours). I added ham and it turned our great but it would be great without it too, The potatoes were perfectly done and the cheese sauce was creamy and delicious. Will make this again.

This is a good recipe to go by. I mince the onions instead of the rings. I also add garlic powder, extra pepper and salt when I am making the cheese sauce. I also remove the aluminum foil the last 30 minutes. I found that adding a bit more milk will make it have a creamier consistency.

Seriously so delicious! First time making this and I’m a huge fan. I did make minor changes though. I chopped the onion which I sautéed with 4 cloves of chopped garlic and a little title paprika. I also used a 2 qt. dish and even then it almost bubbles over. I did also take the foil off 20 minutes before to get a nice bubbly brown top.

I added minced garlic to both the potatoes and sauce and I think it worked well. Next time, I think I may add bacon and a little more cheese. Very nice all the same.

No good at all.  Way too soupy, potatoes weren't done after 1 3/4 hours,  and terrifically bland. I love onions, but these were just odd with the potatoes.
This recipe could be fixed so it would work, but there are so many good cheesy potato recipes out there - best to just skip over this one completely.

This is not hard to make and I turned it Gluten Free by using cornstarch instead of flour. I also added cooked bacon. Everyone loved it.

Fantastic! I tweaked just a bit. 
1. I diced onions,,slices seemed too big
2. I layered 1/2 potatoes and onions, then poured 1/2 the sauce over. Rinse and repeat one more time.
3. I chopped up frozen sour dough bread and added garlic and butter and kinda made croutons. I covered the whole thing with these.           O M G!!!

Made recipe and it was fabulous.  I did have some slight separation with the butter, it still browned up slightly.  I cut the potatoes thinner, trying out my new mandolin.  I managed to get them 1/8" thick--sliced the longish way.  I added some sauce after 2 layers and repeated.  I was running short of time, so I omitted the onion--not that big a fan of onion to begin with.  I kept it simple and used Kraft Triple Blend Cheddar.  What a glorious comfort food--delicious to the last incredible bite.

I basically made this dish. The outcome was probably the same. I used four white potatoes and 1/2 an onion, sliced and diced. I cut the milk in half and simmered the sauce for close to 20 min while I parboiled the potato slices with the onion for about 7 minutes....then drained and placed in a greased casserole. I added the full amount of cheese (cheddar, white cheddar, cream cheese mix ), (maybe more) to the sauce and stirred till beautifully smooth. I added S&P, mustard powder, garlic powder and nutmeg at the end. Then folded into the potato slices. Cover for 45, uncover for 15 at 350. I like a thicker, cheesier mix so this was pretty good for us. A crumb topping could be fun, any variety of cheese to suit tastes is easily adaptable. Thank you CathyM!

Very good recipe. I omitted onions and added onion powder instead. Used 1/4 c Swiss and 1 c Cheddar. Baked on 425 for 1 hour. Next time I will add a little extra salt.

Followed recipe but did make the following changes;
sauted onions in butter with garlic
cooked for 8 hours on low in crock pot. 
Came out very tasty. Have a lot leftover since it's just my DH and me but will freeze them for later.

Very good. Layered sauce so it would absorb layers well. Used a larger casserole dish than suggested. Enjoyed them and the onion was a nice flavor/richness enhancer.

Too much cheese sauce!  And the bottom burned.  Used a glass pan...maybe that’s why?  Will adjust recipe next time and not use a glass pan.

Turned out great! The recipe looked so simple that I didn’t think it would have any flavor. I was definitely wrong. Everyone loved it!

Only things I did differently from the recipe is that I chopped and sautéed the onions before adding them to the mix. I used shedded sharp cheddar cheese and mixed potatoes with the sauce in a big bowl so everything would be covered with sauce. I also put a layer of cheddar on top. Took longer to bake than stated but it turned out great!!

I made this recipe following the very simple directions and my family ate it all. They even scraped the sides of the pan. The only change I made was substituting pepper jack cheese. I believe in using what I have on hand rather than making another run to the store. Great recipe!

These were great. The only change I made was adding chopped chives instead of onion (not a fan of onions.) I also  sprinkled on some shredded cheese toward the end of baking because I love cheese. As long as you like onions, this recipe is great as written.

This turned out deliciously but I did make a few adjustments the second time. I swapped chopped chives for the onion, coated the bottom of the pan with olive oil and for the cheese I used 3/4 mozzarella and 1/4 part cheddar. I also added a little paprika and mustard to the cheese sauce. Adding bacon to the top after it’s finished baking was also a good addition.  I doubled the recipe too because it gets devoured quickly.

Everyone had seconds. This was amazing. I used medium-aged cheddar as the cheese. Might try old cheddar next time. And there will be a next time.

Awesome potatoes, followed other reviewer's advice, put in a 2 qt. casserole and stirred the cheese into the sliced potatoes to coat all slices.  I sliced the potatoes thinly with the Cuisinart, chopped the onions with 2 cloves of garlic and sweated a bit then layered with the raw potatoes, increased the grated sharp cheddar to 2 cups - was amazing, making again for July 4 - family loved them!

Following the advice of another reviewer, I sautéed the onions with a bit of garlic to introduce another flavour into the dish. I baked the dish covered for 1 hour 15 minutes, then uncovered for 15 minutes to brown the top of the potatoes. 

Overall a pretty great dish!

Did it without onions, used shredded Sharp  Cheddar and half and half instead of milk.  Turned out wonderful, received lots of complements. Thanks.

These were fantastic.  Made a double batch and layered in a 13x9 casserole pan.  Only changes were added 1/4 tsp garlic powder and 1/4 tsp pepper to each single batch.  My Mother-in-Law, who fancies her Au Gratin stated they were far better then hers.  Will definitely be making these again.

Of course I had to add garlic and top it with some more cheese.  It was very good. We will definitely be having this again. There'sso many possibilities to add on with this recipe. You can make it different each time making this .... Ummm next time I'll try to make it a little spicy ??

I doubled the recipe. Minced some garlic, grated the onion and sauteed them in butter prior to mixing with the potatoes and adding the roux. Great recipe. Definitely will be making it again.

This was very good, but I couldn't fairly give it 5 stars. As written, the recipe calls for 4 russet potatoes and 1 onion. Since russet potatoes and onions in my grocery stores can range from the size of baby's fist to the size of a large adult's foot, it is frustrating to try to follow this recipe. It would be very helpful if the quantities were given in weight, or at least, in size description. I ended up guessing how many would be required. My russets were small to medium sized, so I used 7 of them. I decided to use a medium-sized onion and worried that it was too much, but it was just the right amount. Instead of slicing the onion, I minced mine and sauteed them for a few minutes. I also minced 3 cloves of garlic and added it to the onions after I turned off the burner. I mixed the onion/garlic mixture with my sliced potatoes and added them to my buttered pan. For my roux, I added a teaspoon of mustard powder and a dash of Worcestershire sauce. I also used an extra 1/2 cup of freshly-grated sharp cheddar in my sauce. The amount of sauce ended up to be more than enough. I took the foil off the pan for the last 20 minutes of baking. After my timer sounded, I took it from the oven and let it sit for 10 minutes to set up a bit. Everyone thought it was delicious, so this one will go to my "make again" recipe list.

I've made this several times over the years for dinner and special holiday dinners. It has always been a hit and people have thought it was made from a special family recipe. I have altered it on occasion by adding sliced leeks to it, when available - sometimes with the onions. My wife loves the leeks added to it and it adds a nice savory flavor composition to it.

Instead of just using 1 1/2 C cheese, I used a small 4 oz velveeta cheese which made the sauce super amazing. I then topped the dish with cheddar cheese.

Delicious!  I  cooked some  diced-up onions in butter to
soften and then spooned a little over each layer of potato.
Also used original creole seasoning in place of salt & pepper.
This is an excellent recipe, thanks!

This recipe is super easy. I made on Mom's Day, as a side dish. I did a half recipe, and between two of us, there was nothing left.
Changes; along with salt and pepper I used ground sage and rosemary in the layers; grated sharp cheddar and parmesan for the sauce.
It will be the go-to for au gratin.

I made this,  but made a couple changes.  I sprinkled salt, pepper, shredded cheese and garlic powder on each potato later.  I also added some ground mustard and cayenne pepper to the sauce to pep it up a bit.  USE EXTRA SHARP CHEDDAR.  I also added some gouda in.   Use a fork to move the potato slices around a bit after you pour the sauce on.
For those who said the sauce separated and/or got grainy, be sure you take the sauce pan off the heat immediately after you add the cheese, and stir until it melts.  

It took FAR longer to bake than was stated, closer to 2+ hours and I turned it up to 425 when it was apparent it wouldn’t be done on time (and yes, I use an oven thermometer, and used a mandolin to slice the potatoes very thin).  My dish was smaller but deeper, and this may have affected the cooking time.

It was very well received at the dinner I brought it to.   Will make again.

Cooked potatoes at a higher temp for a shorter time since I didn’t want to wait. Came out perfect - creamy and soft. But he dish lacked flavor, needed a lot more spices and seasoning!

I really enjoyed this recipe! It was easy to make and very delicious! I made a few modifications though that I think make the recipe even more tasty -
1.) I diced the onion instead of cutting it into rings. That gives a better texture in my opinion
2.) I chopped up a few garlic cloves and put them in the onion layer as well which added some needed flavor to the dish
3.) I cut the potatoes up a bit thiner and they cooked perfectly in the 1hr, 30min time
4.) I took the  foil off during the last couple minutes and set the oven to broil and allowed the cheese layer on top to brown a bit
5.) I cooked the butter a little bit more before adding in the flour so that it became brown butter (gives more flavor!)

This is my husband’s favorite meal, along with meatloaf :) I have made this many times and have been trying to perfect it because it always seemed like the potatoes weren’t getting done. I would suggest boiling the potatoes for about ten minutes before cooling and layering. They cook all the way through and sometimes break apart but when you cover it all with cheese, perfect slices don’t matter much lol. Another suggestion would be to dice instead of slice the potatoes, but this takes time if you don’t have a diver.

I also use 1/4 of an onion and cook it in the butter and then add the cheese, as my husband likes the taste of onions as long as they’re not overpowering and rings seemed like it would be both overpowering and awkward to eat.

He requests this about once a month and it’s always a huge hit!

Made this yesterday for side. Went very well with ham and green beans. Excellent flavor. I’m sure you can change it up for your taste buds. Good starting point for your own recipe. But, husband and I loved it the way it was written. I will make this many times in future. I highly recommend you to give this a try

This was a great find. I used sliced red potatoes and left the skins on and diced onions. It was a huge favorite at dinner. I will definitely make it again.

This dish is so good that people eat a lot more than typical serving size.  I usually double, or triple, the recipe for 8-10 people.

I followed this recipe as provided and only added about 1 c of crushed “Texas Toast” cheese and garlic croutons with a sprinkle of cheddar cheese on top about 5 minutes before the timer went off. Delish!

My husband grew up with the Betty Crocker style. I grew up with homemade. This last Easter I decided enough is enough and I used this recipe. My husband was impressed! I didn’t have a fresh onion so I used dried minced onion. This was a good substitute although, I’m sure fresh would have been better. My husband suggested that I put in leftover ham to make a casserole. So this is our next meal! I’ll let y’all know how it turns out!

Key is to SLICE the potatoes and onions very THIN. Also, I added 3x more butter. It felt insufficient in the sauce. It can definitely use MORE CHEESE for the flavor. I also added a layer of bacon and shredded chicken in between the potatoes becuase this was a main dish. It turned out GREAT!

I altered the recipe slightly.  I used more cheese- to make it cheaper, I asked for cheese ends from the deli counter.  They don't charge much plus you get a variety of different cheeses.  I also minced the onion, added minced garlic and sauteed them together.  I added this to the cheese mixture along with bacon chopped into bite size pieces,    My family loves this recipe.

I added bacon bits and it was good. I made a little too much cheese sauce for the amount of potatoes in a 2 quart dish. I will make this again with some minor changes.

excellent! Will not hesitate to make again however 400 degrees for 90 minutes too HOT, too long! will reduce time in oven. cheese sauce melted to the bottom, a good thing but then burned, leaving a "tray" of burned cheese. did not affect top layers of potatoes however which were soft and tasty with a nice cheesey top!

This dish makes it nearly impossible to stick to a carb-less diet! I omitted onion as my kids would not have eaten it. I also made 1 1/2 portions of the cheese sauce and sliced the potatoes quite thin. Served with our honey-glazed ham for Easter. Simple, but delicious.

It was easy and delicious. The only thing holding one star back is I like it super cheesy and these potatoes seemed a bit dry. I'd double the cheese sauce portion of the recipe. But that is also a personal recommendation.

Other than that, I'll be making these a lot more often.

I never change a recipe the first time reason being that I trust the person who first made it , if I find something that I would add or change I probably would do it the second time , I have made this recipe 3 times so far and my family loved it èach time , therefore I give it 5 stars.

I have made this a couple times now and it's always great. I will say that no matter how thin I slice my potatoes, 1.5 hours is not long enough of a cook time. It's at least 2 hours for me, specifically if I am cooking other things in the oven at the same time, which I usually am. I do layer the potatoes and onions with the cheese sauce and if I have any bread crumbs handy I will throw those on top as well, but I don't necessarily go out of my way to do so.

I make this atleast five times a year. It is so good. A few changes in this recipe, I use REAL butter, unsalted butter that is. Anytime a recipe calls for butter, it want you to use UNSALTED butter. Don't just use salted anytime you feel like using salted, otherwise you risk the chance of that food becoming too salty especially if it calls for salt. I just eyeball the ingredients when making this, I don't measure. Cinnamon, I add a few dashes of cinnamon to the mixture. I also sprinkle some cinnamon on top of this dish after I pour it into a Pyrex dish. It kicks it up a notch. Also, with the use of bread, dont cut the bread into cubes, tear the bread into peaces and you may or may not need to adjust the amount of white bread. You do not want the mixture to be too soupy but not too dry.

I added spinach. The onion I fried with butter and a bit of oil, I also added cumin and turmeric (super foods I add in everything), and I used Parmesan cause I didn't have cheddar; I used extra cheese. It was delicious!!! Thank you.

Skip the onion slices; this is an awesome side dish and reheats well. I put down one layer of potatoes then covered with 1/2 of the sauce, followed by second layer of potatoes, the remaining 1/2 of the sauce and topped with shredded cheddar cheese. Excellent dish!

These potatoes were absolutely delicious! Easy too!  Au gratin potato recipes usually have mustard in them.  I was eager to try them and I was not disappointed.  I will make these again and again.

To keep baking time down to 30 to 45 minutes, I par boil the potatoes  for about 15 minutes. I also us3 velvetta and cheddar.If it is for a special occassion I add sour cream and cream cheese. Just micowave with the other cheesr and milk products. We do not add onions , that makes it scalloped potatoes. I am making this tonight and I will try cooking the potatoes  in the micowave. I do that when I bake potatoes.

Sooo good! I just changed a few things. First, I minced a quarter of an onion and two cloves of garlic together. I also made a half a recipe MORE of cheese. After my first layer of potatoes, I put HALF of the onions and garlic over the top with salt and pepper, then half the cheese sauce. I did the same thing with the second layer and they turned out perfect! Made them two nights in a row! Bonus: cook some chorizo and sprinkle it over the top before cooking for some added flavor!

So creamy... delicious ... it's a keeper!   I used a mandolin to slice the potatoes so they were sliced much thinner then the recipe called for ... they were cooked perfectly! Made it as per the recipe only I chopped the onion and minced 1 clove of garlic, mixed them together and then topped the first layer of potatoes.   I had 35% cream on hand so I changed it up a bit with a 1/2 cup of cream and 1/2 cup of milk (I know this is sinfully not a calorie wise decision, just simply wanted to use it up before it spoiled) but I'm sure with just milk on it's own, it would of been still just as good.  I'll be making this one again!

With tweaks.  A touch more salt (1/4 tsp or so), about 1/8 tsp nutmeg, and 1 tsp dijon mustard in the sauce. A sprinkle of paprika as well.   I sliced my potatoes with a mandoline, so they were very thin, and so the dish cooked more quickly.  I did 1 hour covered, and 15 min uncovered to get brown and bubbly. I leave out the onions b/c hubby doesn't like onions and cheese together.

The ingredients are perfect. I just wanted to speed up the cooking time and add a little extra flavor. Preheat oven to 375. Put the potatoes in the microwave with water for 4 minutes on high, then drain well. Caramelize the onions, thinly sliced with a mandolin, in a skillet in 1 tablespoon of olive oil, salt and pepper.  Set onions aside, add 2 tablespoons of butter and saute the drained potatoes, sprinkled with paprika, salt and pepper, until a little brown around the edges on both sides.  Follow recipe, putting ingredients in a casserole dish. Sprinkle some cheese on top. Bake in the preheated 375 degree oven, uncovered, for 30 minutes. Let rest for 10 minutes before serving.

We love these potatoes. The only reason i rated them a 4 is because they need spiced up. Ive made these several times. Each time i use a mixture of cheese i have on hand. I always add garlic and some ground mustard. A few shakes of hot sauce is a fantastic addition. And a topping, bread crumbs, crackers, smashed croutons. Very good base recipe. Thank you

I was recently asked to bring scalloped potatoes for Christmas. I have never made them from scratch so I was a bit intimidated, especially since I recently tried  (Reser’s Main st. Bistro Baked Scalloped Potatoes) from Costco. They are the BEST I ever had. I have been interested in attempting making home made scalloped potatoes although I was doubtful I would be able to compete with store bought. Crazy to say because 
I am admittedly a home-made & from scratch snob. The thought that I would bring something  store bought was not my norm. So I looked on line through a lot of reviews for a recipe from scratch and this one seems to have the most consistent 5-star reviews and the same tweaks. So I tried it and it seems I too, am among many who feel that it needs more seasoning.  The basic recipe is good I am even going to keep it for a reference for mac n cheese. I found it rather bland and wasn’t satisfied with added salt and pepper. If anyone reads this and has recommendations I am grateful for your input. OH and guess what I brought to Christmas ....I transferred the Reser's store bought into my casserole disses and everyone LOVED THEM!!  I even  let them think I made them. Sometimes ya just gotta do... what ya gotta do. LOL

I made this for dinner I kinda made a small switch I cut up a Pork shoulder into cubes and fried it in Olive Oil I used Crazy Jane's mixed up salt for the pork. I Prepared the Potatoes and onions as the Recipe instructed.
Before I put the final layer of Potatoes on top I put the pork on the first layer of onions and Potatoes....Then finished I used the Italian blend of cheese into the milk mixture also cooked it just as instructed and it ROCKED!!!!!!! 
The flavors of the pork added a special taste and Dinner was done I made a Salad it was all gone I used Sweet onions also Bravo this Recipe is A Hit ...........
Tip: I used Yukon gold potatoes and added a few more I think it's your personal preference on how much you want to make

Very good.  I did not have an onion so I used a bit of garlic powder on the potatoes.  The taste was good but the potatoes looked much less voluminous than in the picture (which was fine by me).  If you are someone who likes a good bit of spice in your foods, you may want to include a dash of cayenne, fresh garlic, and some extra salt.  Also, a food processor is perfect for slicing the potatoes.

I made this recipe tonight and was very disappointed. With the exception of reducing the amount of onions and chopping rather than slicing them, I followed the recipe exactly. What came out of the oven was a very bland dish. The sauce was not creamy, but somewhat curdled, grainy and oily. I would rather have the box au gratin potatoes - they are more flavorful and much creamier than these.  I will definitely not make these again!

Excellent recipe, definitely a keeper. A few notes: 4 average, med-large russet potatoes (approx. 1/2 lb each) will not fit into a 1 quart casserole, nor even a 1-1/2 quart casserole. You really need a 2-quart dish to avoid boiling over. Rather than slicing the onion into rings, I French-cut the onion, which works nicely with this dish. I also micro-grated a clove of garlic plus a bit of nutmeg into the sauce, both of which add special nuance to cheese sauces.

I've made this recipe several times for special get togethers, and my guests always love it.

I'm not a huge fan of the onions, so I reduce the amount by around half. I would leave them out all together, but the onions add so much  flavor to the potatoes, and I'm generally making them for others who like onion, so I include them at a reduced amount.

The cooking time usually takes 30 minutes or so longer than what the instructions indicate, but I like tender potatoes, so I bake them longer. I'm not a fan of semi-hard potatoes.

The last time I made these, I sliced the potatoes very thin, using a vegetable slicer, and then baked them in my convection oven. After 2+ hours, the potatoes still were not cooked through. I don't recommend cooking by convection because it takes so long.

No matter how much I prepare my baking dish, the potatoes always stick to the bottom of the pan.

Overall, a delicious recipe, and my go-to recipe for special occasions.

Delicious! The change I made was to parboil the potatoes after slicing for 3 minutes. It cut the cooking time in half.  I also sprinkled cheese between the layers of potatoes and no onions! My husband hates them!

Delicious and creamy. Be sure to use a block of cheddar cheese and grate it yourself. The already grated cheddar cheese has a coating on it that can make the creaminess a little gritty.

Very good recipe. I did dice the onions rather than slice, as other reviews suggested. I also made a larger batch (1.5 times the recipe) and used extra sharp white cheddar. I also took the foil off for the last 10 minutes or so, however, my dish didn’t get that crispy brown top that is so good on potatoes au gratin. Maybe you could accomplish that with sprinkling a little extra shredded cheese on top when you take the foil off and/or cranking the heat for the last 10 min.

Excellent dish. Made primarily as described with exception of sautéed onions prior to adding them as some other users recommended. Some things I might try next time: dab dry potato slices as the sauce might stick better for more even sauce distribution.

I doubled the recipe and it fit nicely in a 9 x 13 glass pan.  I chopped the onions instead of slicing them.  I layered potatoes salt and pepper a handful of the chopped onions and cheese sauce 3 or 4 times.  Family loved it!  Will make these again!

I made this for Christmas lunch today. Since I didn't make the recipe as-is, I can't rate it fairly, but it was well-received and several people went back for seconds. I doubled the recipe, used half the onion that was called for, and I used gluten-free flour. If I made it again, I would a) slice the potatoes thinner, b) use even less onion and I would chop it instead of slicing it, and c) I would bake it for 2 hours instead of 1.5 hours. The potatoes weren't as soft as I would have liked, and it was a bit too oniony for my tastes. I think adding some garlic salt and maybe some bacon crumbles would make this even better. Still, I think this is a good recipe.

This recipe was simple and that's exactly what Iove.  It's a good base recipe where add ins can be added. I love adding bacon to this recipe.  But I did make it as directed and it was good as is! Will be making this over and over again.

I peeled the potatoes and sliced as thinly as possible. Instead of slicing the onion, I diced it and sauteed with some minced garlic in butter before layering with potatoes. I didn't salt enough so added some Parmesan to the top. I cooked with foil on for about an hour, then took foil off and finished it off for half an hour to get a nice texture/look to the top.

I made it exactly like the recipe stated with the exception of cutting the potatoes and onions a bit thinner and my husband loved it!  I've made au gratin potatoes many times over the years, but decided to go to a basic recipe.  I will be using this recipe over and over again!  Good job!

I made this with the exception of a few changes!  I make a rue with butter/canned milk/flour. Mixed melted butter with flour then added milk SLOWLY until it thicker. Added Sharp cheddar cheese until melted to the “gravy “ sprayed dish with *pam. Added a layer of  potatoes topped with cheesy gravy then added shredded cheese repeating over layers of potatoes.  Added milk to 3/4 of the pan.  Topped extra cheese on the final layer of potatoes

Add the seasonings  separately from the flour. Also I use a mandoline slicing my onions thinner and I season the potatoes and onions a bit on each layer, I usually use salt, a pepper blend and a bit of garlic powder, NOT garlic salt. I never use a low fat cheese. for this dish . When I am using equal amounts of flour and butter to thicken a dish I use soft butter and make a paste of the two,  then stir it into the liquid with a whisk , it dissolves smoothly and thickens beautifully, then I pour it over the potato and onion layers.

Added some bacon bits, but that was all. Followed the directions and had to use Vanilla Soy Milk. I was a little concerned about the vanilla flavoring but it was excellent.

My mom's Au Gratin Potatoes and her Baked Macaroni & Cheese were the same recipe... just swap out the main ingredient. I love this -  minus the onion. And I love onions ... but not in Au Gratin Potatoes.

I was running late for dinner, so I took the advice of another reviewer.  I sliced the potatoes using a mandoline and put them in a pot of water for 10 min and drained them from excess water.  I also sautéed the onions in butter.  I added garlic powder and salt and pepper.  I found the milk/cheese/butter very runny and used a little extra flour.  Cooked for an hour -- sides got a little crispy, but it turned out really good.

Okay.  Half the family did not like this (kids are ages 5-18), so I won't make it again.  Much cheesier than I'd anticipated  -- very much like a homemade mad and cheese sauce.

With these changes, this dish turned out great!!! Very creamy, cheesy and perfectly done after an hour and a half. I cut the potato slices about 1/8th of an inch. I used 2 cups of cream instead of milk, gluten free corn starch instead of flour, added 1 tsp. dried parsley for color and added garlic salt to the cheese mixture to taste. Also, omitted the onion and added shredded cheese in it's place. I sprinkled 1.5 tbs. diced green onions on the top, after it was done cooking for a pretty presentation. Really yummy!!!!!

Made this in an 8x8 dish using about 5 gold potatoes. I put one layer down and poured some sauce over and then the last layer. Only had time to cook for an hour with the foil off for the last 15 minutes. The potatoes were cooked through but a little longer would be nice.

turned out perfect!! I did not use onions, however.. and I varied the ingredients a little. First I used a teaspoon of onion powder and mixed it in with the flour with salt and pepper.

Almost followed recipe...I hate onions, but used onion and garlic powder, and pinch of nutmeg. Used a cup of shredded mozzarella and cup of cheddar. Next time I make these (and I will!) I'm adding a bit more cheese, because we like cheese.  It was a great recipe, and if you like onion, I'm sure it's great too.

I made this recipe and I LOVE it. I've only ever made au gratin potatoes from a box before tonight. 
I made 4 small modifications... 1. sliced the potatoes quite thin (I didn't have time to cook them thicker!!), 2. increased temperature to 425, 3. added a pinch of red pepper flakes to the cheese sauce with the salt & flour, and 4. Used an all-purpose gluten free flour   

I used extra sharp white cheddar and look forward to trying again with each of my favorite cheeses!

Note: served with some seasoned grilled chicken, and zucchini sautéed with tomatoes, artichoke hearts and a scoop of capers.

A good basic recipe. I think a blend of other cheeses may have made it a little better but I always try to go by the recipe as written the first time I make it and when I review it.

Made this for TG dinner. It was all gone.
A little bland but used chedder cheese and maybe a different one may have made a difference.
Easy to prepare. I diced a few onions not sliced.
Liked to sauce and not using soups as this probably cut down a few calories
The thinner the potatoes are cut the faster the cooking time.
Will keep this on file for next time

I knew after reading the ingredient list that some additions would have to be made, just to add more flavor, but it is a good start off point (just MHO because we all have different tastes).  I layered potatoes and onions inbetween cheese sauce.  I also saute my onions till translucent then add fresh minced garlic and S&P.  To the cheese sauce I add freshly grated nutmeg & S&P and add additional cheese (sometimes using different cheeses or a mixture of cheeses).  A good cheese to add is Monterey Jack or PepperJack cheese.  Best tip I could give is that I make a huge pot of cheese sauce and once cool, I divide it up into smaller containers to freeze.  That way I always have cheese sauce on hand, to add over broccoli, cauliflower, etc or to make my own Mac n Cheese.  To reheat it, I just thaw in the refrigerator or in the microwave.  If using microwave, make sure you are stirring it up every 30 sec. to 1 min. intervals or it will boil over.  You will know when it is fully heated when the texture is smooth.  I hope this TIP helps someone as it is a definite time saver for me.  Thank you for the recipe.

Delicious!  Left out the onions simply because I forgot them, but they were still great.  The cheese sauce is rich (I used 2% milk) and cheesy.  The recipe is easy.  The hard part is waiting for them to finish baking because they smell so good while they are in the oven!

I have made this twice for different potlucks and did not have leftovers either time. I am going to two more potlucks this weekend and plan to make it for both.

To save time, I boil the potatoes first.

Would use a cheese blend in the future but it was simple, relatively quick, and delicious. Makes a great side or a lunch.

The recipe was perfect as is.  It may be my spouse's new favorite too.  i just used a taco cheese mix that i had on hand and it was delicious.  The roux was easy to make and I will also use for mac n cheese.  thank you

I read the reviews first and noticed that most took out the onion. I minced the onion and carmelized it first adding a small handful to each 2 layers of potatoes. I also added a sprinkle of Tony Chacheres to the cheese mix. Everything else remained the same. It turned out AMAZING!!

This is the only way to make Augratin potatoes! The only thing I do different, I take the French fried onions an layer across the top that last few minutes of baking. I also use half an half instead of milk for a richer sauce. You can change it up by using different types of cheese.  Oh an I also cook in the microwave 5 minutes just potatoes an onions then add my sauce on top shake the dish side to side an then bake.

I made this because I wanted cheese and potatoes, but not as a casserole. I followed the instructions rather than any improvising. It turned out great!

Easy to make and tastes amazing. I cooked up some bacon slices, chopped them in to bacon bits, and added them to the dish, which turned out to be a great idea for a little extra flavour. This will be my new "go-to" recipe for scalloped potatoes.

Even with skim milk and some wheat flour, omitted onions, and a little extra cheese, these were fantastic!  Even my husband who normally doesn't like "all rotten" potatoes liked it!

I halved this recipe (2 potatoes), but forgot to account for that when I baked them... so they overlooked a bit, but they were still really good.

I always read a few comments before I try a recipe, so I did change a couple of things. I was pressed for time so after slicing potatoes I boiled them for a bit first. I also sautéed the onions diced with some garlic.  I added fresh bacon crumbles on top with ritz crackers crumbled and tossed with melted butter. This recipe is just awesome! My family loved it. I recommend that you do not attempt to double this recipe because you will end up gorging yourself and eating every last bite!

These were so easy to make and very good.  I didn't add onions simply because I don't eat them (heartburn), but I used a little onion powder.   Otherwise I followed directions and they easily make my top five potato recipes.

Substitute buttermilk for the whole milk and it gets a LOT better.  I also put onions in between each layer of potato.  Also skip the tin foil, I find it is not needed.  Finally, the potato slices should be less than 1/4 in thick.

This was very tasty but it needed something. I am going to make it again but use extra sharp cheddar cheese instead of just the sharp and use a bit more salt and pepper. It is a very easy dish to make.

I love this and it's my go-to now.  My favorite thing about this is that you don't have to pre-cook the potatoes. The only change I made was to use 1-2 tablespoons of cornstarch instead of the flour.

I made it with a few variations. I like portion control and cooked these in two small dishes.  It was delicious! I chopped and used 1/2 a small onion and in a small bowl mixed it with the potatoes. I poured the cheese sauce on top as recommended. This caused the sauce to not make it to the bottom of the dish. I recommend add a layer of potatoes, a little sauce, layer of potatoes, the more sauce etc... Then finish off the top with a nice layer of cheese. Last thing, instead of cutting the potatoes a 1/4 inch I sliced them very thin. They cook faster and absorb the flavors better. Cheers!

I am in the process of making this dish now but my cheese sauce did not stick in the way it was supposed to even though I followed the directions exact.  Not sure if this is going to turn out especially for the fact that I did not have russet potatoes so I use the smaller honey gold but still slice them and I'm cooking for less time.   Has anyone used a different type of potato besides the russet?

I've been making this recipe for awhile now and it's always delicious. I use whatever cheese I have on hand, I made it with garlic jack tonight and the little bit of cheddar I had and it was the best I've ever made even my husband said it was the best I ever made. I put a little Vidalia onion in the layers and honestly u can't even taste it. I also put a little cheese between the layers even though it is not necessary at all.

I cut the onion into quarters before slicing it, and add ham slices cut into strips laid across the top (enough to cover), before the cheese sauce is poured on. Left-over ham from a baked spiral-sliced bone-in ham, stored in the freezer, is an excellent addition to this recipe. If I have an abundance of left-over ham, I make a double recipe, and freeze the left-overs for easy meals.

Quite good, though I had to add some spices. I tend to add 1-2 tsp per cup of cheese to any cheese sauce of: Paprika, Mustard Powder, Cumin, Garlic, Onion Powder (I didn't have an actual onion to add). As well as a few dashes of hot sauce, and about twice as many of worcestershire sauce)

my wife and child loves this recipe it's super easy to make and it's not a messy item to make. this goes great with some pork chops and a simple veggie. I would suggest that anyone who likes potato and cheese to give it a try. next time I'm adding some chopped broccoli to the mixture.

Pretty simple recipe, and good basis for making your own customization to account for taste preferences.  I dice instead of slice onion, make 1/5 times the cheese sauce, don't layer but mix potato and onion together and then add cheese sauce as I fill the baking dish with the potato mixture.  I also limited the add in  salt but maybe over shot the target.  But It gave me the idea to maybe add some lardons on my next cook.

If I could give it 4 1/2 star I would! I omitted the onions (personal preference) and used extra-sharp cheese.  I suggest removing the foil for the last 15-20 minutes for a browned top.
I applaud the chef for giving us a classic recipe! Casserole potatoes are no longer on my list of "hmmm, how did my grandmother do this, exactly?"

Simple and fast, and begs for a couple of tweaks. I caramelized diced onion and added two minced garlic cloves for starters. Also, I used sliced parsnip for some of the potato. This added a sweetness that went well with the onion. Having read others say the 1/4 inch slice was too thick to cook in the time given I sliced closer to 1/8 inch and it worked nicely. Again, as others have said, use an extra cup of milk and add more cheese accordingly

I made this exactly as the recipe calls, with the exception of mincing my onions instead of slicing. It is the best au gratin potato I've had in a long time! Very basic, but that's a good thing, because it's very easily tweeked to add your own personality to it, or just to eat it as is. Delicious!!!
I've seen some reviews say that their potatoes were still very hard after 1 1/2 hours, this could have been the type of potato used. I used russet, and they cooked up just fine. I even doubled the recipe. 
This will be my go-to au gratin recipe for sure!

Oh my!! I made this as printed the first time. and it was really good! The second time around I added dijon mustard to the bechemel. It adds another layer of flavor.  Also, if you add yellow mustard it gives it a nice color. I played around with the cheeses the second time around just because I like to play. There are so many things that you can do with this because the original recipe is wonderful. It's a dish of delish! Thank you for posting it!

Delicious! I changed the onion (I used sweet onion), cut it into chunks n sauteed them in the butter until transparent. Also added garlic powder! Adds a lotta flavor!

I used this as the basis for a cheat I made.  Wanted to prepare this at work where we have a kitchen but no oven so I cheated.  I sliced and boiled the potatoes and then put everything else as stated in a clay pot and cooked it for 10 minutes in the microwave with an extra 5 minutes with the grill on to finish the top off properly.  It worked perfectly and I would consider doing this even at home now if it saves so much cooking time.

Regards ingredients, I diced the onions and sweated them off a bit before adding them - I liked the additional flavour they provided.  I might st some point try some more flavouring in addition to the salt and pepper - maybe some powdered mustard to the sauce would give it a nice tang - but I was pleased with the result.  I used cheddar cheese but I have in the past used some Camembert in with it when I've done cheese sauce for other dishes and that makes it lovely and rich.

Followed the suggestion of another reviewer and made extra cheese sauce (1.5x the recipe, and 2x the cheese) and omitted the onions. My bad that I didn't cook the sauce long enough to let it get thick for the first layer, but by the time I got done spooning it over the first layer and setting up the second layer, it had begun to thicken.  So I waited to spoon over the second layer until it got nice and thick!  My wife raved! Thanks!

I followed the recipe word for word, and it turned out exactly as expected which was, delicious. I understand why some naysayers have called it bland but I agree with the reviewers who say this is a comfort food dish! Lots of ways to change the recipe, and leeway to add spices to your taste.

I have made this a million times. I have found, when I'm in a crunch for time, that boiling the potatoes until they are soft when poked with a fork and then peeling them and slicing them and adding the cheese ingredients it saves on time. However they are not as cheesy as the regular method, however they are still yummy!

I'm giving it 5 stars because it formed the foundation of my recipe that I of course modified.  I saw a recipe that recommended boiling the potatoes in the half & half (which I used instead of milk), salt & pepper on a low simmer for 10-15 minutes.  Then after removing the potatoes to a casserole dish, you can add the cheese and whatever other cool stuff you want to the cream.  The potato starch thickens the sauce without flour.  I added cayenne, garlic, parsley and a pinch of nutmeg, along with a half a block of cream cheese, and medium cheddar.  I sprinkled parm between the layered potatoes and poured the half& half mixture over the top.  It was yummy

I did tweek the recipe slightly,
I left out the onions but put chives in the cheese sauce. I added diced ham, and used a slicer blade on my grater/chopper to make chip thickness slices. Then i mixed the cheese sauce with my own sauce which is basically milk, butter, cheese, and sour cream to help give it more flavor. It worked cause even my picky kids loved it!!

These potatoes were delicious & easy to make. I the recipe is also very versatile as you can sub in different cheeses and spices or other additions such as bacon crumbles. I used onion powder in place of an actual onion & it was perfect!

I used my food processor to slice the potatoes and onions so both were super-thin ... which we liked.  I also decreased the onion to about 1/4 an onion and sautéed it in butter before adding.  Added just enough flavor without being too much.  Per other people's suggestions, I made 1.5 times the cheese sauce.  While the potatoes seemed quite "saucy" the day I made them, they were perfect as leftovers.  I look forward to making them again and adding bits of other cheeses to see what I like best.

Not as good as hoped.  Way too cheesy for me, and as much as I love cooking with onions, those onions in the middle just made the flavor off a bit.  If I make them again, I will probably reduce the cheesy sauce a bit and omit the onions (in favor of onion powder perhaps).

Absolutely delicious.  I  read several reviews and made a few adjustments.  Layered my potatoes and put salt and pepper on each layer along witn a small amount of  chopped onions.  Then made the sauce and made sure I  added some to each layer as well, topping with plenty of dauce.  Served with ribs and it was absolutely delicious.

This was my first time making au gratin potatoes from scratch.  (All my life, I have used the instant boxed version!) I don't know why I have never made them from scratch, they are so simple to make.  I made exactly as written.  My husband obviously prefers this recipe than the box.  I now include this as one of my side dishes for all the holidays.

My kids love cheese so I added grated cheese on top of the potatoes before adding the cheese sauce. I also baked it after the said time, without the foil covering the dish, until the top turned a beautiful dark golden brown. My family loved it!

I've made this numerous times and it has always come out perfect. I don't change any of the ingredients; however, I do chop the onions and sauté them in a little butter before putting them on the potatoes. I have tried so many recipes for this that did not turn out very well, so was especially delighted to discover this very delicious recipe.

I didn't have any onions, so I used onion powder instead. I made 1.5 of cheese sauce. It came out very dry, nonetheless. Next time, 350* instead of 400*, and cook it a little longer. I seasoned with salt, pepper and onion powder on each layer of potatoes, and it came out very tasty.

I made this potato dish, doubling the quantity, for our Easter dinner and all 8 of us loved it!   Only change I would make next time would be to cut the onion into much smaller pieces which I think would improve the texture.  The flavour was delicious , the perfect accompaniment to a ham dinner with green and yellow beans.  I will definitely make it again!

Everyone loved it at Easter with the Ham. Yay
I did use heavy whipping cream with the milk and chopped up the onions. AND most definitely par cook the potatoes first as they will be hard. FYI

It was so good, there wasn't a single morsel left!
we doubled the recipe, added more cheese but  kept the liquid portion the same. took a bit more time to thicken, but was sooo worth it!

Worked out great using Pillsbury Gluten-Free All-Purpose Baking Flour Mix. My only issue was that I added Rosemary to the dish and then wished I hadn't.

These tasted good but I didn't get a very smooth sauce. I also thought the cooking time was a bit too much. I'll watch more closely next time. I took others advice and chopped the onion and mixed throughout. Also, uncovered for the last 15 mins to brown.

Yummy!   After reading multiple reviews, I made a few recommended changes and it turned out wonderful.  I sliced the potatoes very thin to ensure they cook through.  I cooked the onion in garlic and butter.  I sprinkled seasoned salt and pepper between the layers.  And I added 1/4 tsp garlic powder and 1 tsp dried mustard to the cheese sauce.  I put it in a large baking dish to avoid overflow and took the cover off for the last 20 min.  This was my first time making potatoes au gratin and it will grace my table many more times in the future!

I made this for Easter dinner.  It was easy to make, especially since I could change how many servings and the ingredient amounts automatically updated, no calculating! Everyone was scraping the pan trying to get the last bit of the potatoes. Very delicious and will definitely be made again!

No onions. Par boiled with garlic. Definitely added more spices. I subtracted 1 star cause I had to bake much longer than state, and added more seasonings.

My overall opinion of this recipe is favorable.  I only had one issue:  There was tooooo much cheese sauce!  So much that none of the potatoes got crispy because they were drowning in it.  (Yes, I could've not used the whole batch of cheese sauce, but I honestly try to make recipes without changing them too much so I used the entire amount of cheese sauce.  Now I know for next time.)  The flavor was good, though.  I sent an onion through the food processor instead of cutting it into rings.  I can't say I've ever had Potatoes Au Gratin with rings of onions in it so I ground them up and spread them on the first layer of potatoes instead.  Turned out just fine.

These are very good. A little bland, but good. I sprinkle a bit of cayenne pepper into the cheese sauce and sprinkle paprika on top.

I sautéed the onion for about 5 minutes with two teaspoons of garlic. Don't be stingy with the cheese either- use sharp cheddar!

I have made these potatoes several times now and I will making them today for Easter dinner tomorrow.  The only thing I change is the onions - I don't like them sliced into rings, so I mince them.  Otherwise I follow the recipe exactly.  I always make them the night before I need them, and then bake them the next day. They are always a crowd pleaser.

I made these  for last Sunday dinner. They were very good. Only change was that after slicing the potatoes I cooked them a little bit with a tiny amount of water in the microwave. So I baked them for maybe an hour......they were delicious. Thanks for the recipe

Excellent recipe, but I'm so glad I read the reviews before trying this. My sauce also wouldn't thicken at first, so I made about half the recipe amount more roux in a separate pan and added it to the roux/milk mixture and it thickened up beautifully. I sauteed chopped instead of sliced onions and added them to the sauce with the cheese. It was a little bland so I kicked it up with Old Bay seasoning, a little cayenne powder, and pepper. (I didn't measure, sorry.) Perfection! I used a heavy ceramic casserole dish and took the foil off for the last 30 minutes and it was perfectly cooked.

I love how easy and yummy this dish turned out! The only change I will make next time is to use a bigger dish... mine made a mess in my oven!

This is a good recipe, but needs a little bit of tweaking... first, I would recommend not using large onion ring slices. It entirely changes the texture of the dish, and the onion rings do not fully cook layered between the potatoes like this. It ended up being large chunks of half-cooked onion rings throughout the dish that ultimately made  it hard to cut through with a fork after being plated, and just a weird texture/taste with such large chunks. I would suggest either dicing the onion or cutting into smaller pieces. Onion powder/minced onion would not be a bad substitute. But with that, along the lines of seasonings, sprinkling with salt & pepper AFTER layering the prior ingredients only leaves the seasoning/flavor on the top of the dish, so everything layered beneath is pretty bland. I suggest tossing the potatoes in salt/pepper/onion powder (whatever seasonings you are using) PRIOR to layering in the dish, or seasoning on top/between EACH layer, to ensure you will have the flavor throughout the dish. The majority of the recipe is delicious and very easy to prepare! Tweaking the onions & spices makes this much better. I will definitely keep this on hand, just with my own personal modifications that make it a bit more edible & flavorful.

This recipe was delicious! I did make a few changes based on other reviews:
1) used 1/2 cup of diced onions and microwaved with the potatoes for 8 minutes, stirring halfway through. This reduced baking time by 45 minutes. 
2) after each layer of potatoes, I sprinkled a layer of cheese and a dusting of garlic powder.
3)I added pepper when making the roux for extra seasoning
4) after pouring the sauce on, I lifted some of the potatoes up a little to make sure the sauce penetrated all layers.
5) after 45 minutes of baking covered, I uncovered it and sprinkled panko on and broiled for 5 minutes to make a nice crust. 

It was great! My husband had thirds!!

We loved this just as it is!  The second time,  I  parboiled  the potatoes after I cut them to size,  so it would not take so long to bake.  I mixed the (shredded) sharp  cheddar cheese in the potatoes,  instead of melting it in the sauce.   Added  4 slices of  (cooked) crumbled bacon to the potatoes.  I did dice the onions, and I added  an extra 3-4 tbls. butter cut up and put in the potatoes.  Before it went into the oven I put some crumbled bacon and a bit of shredded cheese on the top,  just for looks.  It turned out great.  (...The bacon lover in my house said I could have added more bacon).
This baked at 350 for 35-40 minutes because the potatoes were hot and almost  cooked before hand.  
Enjoy!

This is probably the best au-gratin potato dish I have ever tasted. Like others, I too chopped the onion preferring that over rings. Some labeled this recipe as bland but I dare to disagree. I found this a classic, simple, rich and creamy comfort dish. My new favorite potato recipe.

I made it as the recipe is written and I thought it was pretty bland. Maybe some different kind of cheeses might make a difference. I use a similar cheese sauce when I make mac and cheese but use more butter. This recipe just seemed like it was missing something.

I made this recipe as it was written. It was very good! I give it 4 stars because I don't think it was something out of this world, but I was very pleased with how tasty it was. And it was super easy!!!! Often, I have found some of the recipes on this site to be a bit bland, or plain, but this one, for as little seasoning that the recipe calls for, was very flavorful. This is one of my husband's favorite dishes, and he loved every bite. This recipe is definitely going to be part of our family's regular dinner menu rotation.

so I had to use several small yellow potatoes because its what i had on hand. My family loved the potatoes and was perfect with an easily cooked smoked sausage link and salad.  They, the family, will request these again.

I recommend using a larger than 1 dish because I had some cheese sauce bubble over onto the oven floor. The recipe was great and I will make it again. Do be sure to use sharp cheese and plenty of salt.

I went exclusively to the letter on the recipe, and it didn't turn out well.  The cheese sauce was separated due to the oil from the cheese.  Maybe a broil at the end, some breadcrumbs on the top, and a lower fat cheese...

I made this exactly by the recipe the first time and it was really good.  This time I'm skipping the onions because they detracted from the yummy cheesiness of the potatoes.  I layered the potatoes with the cheese sauce as it didn't seem to penetrate during cooking the last time. The potatoes just sort of clumped together, locking out the cheese sauce. 
This time it was amazing! putting a single layer of potatoes, then cheese sauce then repeating until done did the trick. So so good!

So good. Only used 1/2 onion. A whole one seemed like it might be too much.

This is a GREAT recipe! Some folks said it's bland. Be sure to sprinkle each layer of potatoes with salt and pepper. I prefer to use sea salt. Also, it's not healthy, but substituting half and half for the milk is outstanding!

I thought that 1-1/2 hour was definitely too long to bake at 400 degrees.  The potatoes burned somewhat on the bottom.  Next time I'll cook for 1 hr or drop the temp

Cooked as per recipe.  I used my mild cheddar cheese and still loved the flavour of this dish.  Served it with ham .  The onion was just the perfect hint of flavour; it went so nicely with the ham!

This recipe is wonderful.  I chopped up the onions,  used 2 cups of our homemade cheddar seasoned and aged  with dill in it,  added a few seasonings to taste: smoked paprika,  parsley,  garlic powder and onion powder. While I cooked the sauce  I preheated the potatoes in the microwave for 12 minutes also and then layered the potatoes,  onions and sauce in thin layers til pan was full. .  Baked for only about 30 minutes since my ingredients were preheated in the microwave.  It was sensational.

These were good, but I would add twice as much salt, even though I hardly ever add salt to a recipe and used extra sharp cheese. I really liked the proportion of onions to potatoes. They complimented each other very well.

This is a great alternative for when you don't have any cream in, and therefore probably healthier.  I found it far more subtle to dice the onion rather than slice.  I cook for 2, so only use 2 large potatoes; however, still use the same amount of other ingredients and it tastes beautiful, plus, when cooking for 2, the 1.5 hours is ample, but check with a fork if unsure!

Yum.  Excellent recipe.  I did what others suggested and sliced and boiled the potatoes prior to baking.  It cut way down on the baking time and ensured that the potatoes were cooked through.

I doubled the batch and it was a hit! An important step is to be sure to butter the dish, that way the bottom potatoes get crispy too. Next time I may add some bacon and top with green onions but really the recipe is perfect as is.

This was a great basic au gratin potatoes recipe. I did make some small changes to this recipe:  chopped the onions instead of leaving them in rings, used mixture of asiago and sharp white cheddar, and used gluten free all purpose flour. It may just be my oven, but after about 20 minutes I had to turn the oven temperature down to 375 and I put some foil over the top at that point to keep the top from burning.

Tasty and easy. However, I needed 9x13 (3 qt.) dish. My Russets were average size, maybe CathyM had much smaller ones. Next time I would split the sauce between layers so it's more evenly distributed. I cooked 45-60 minutes at 350 covered with foil and they were perfectly done, a little browning on the bottom and edges and potatoes all soft. I believe 1 1/2 hours at 400 as the recipe directs would be risky. I cut  onion in half then slice "rings" so they weren't to much hassle to pick up with a fork, and they added a nice flavor and texture. Will increase salt next time.

Great recipe - just a couple of things I do to make it better:  

1) Saute the onions until just soft before they are added
2) I double the cheese sauce amount 

It's a family favorite!

I'm asked to make this side dish all the time. I feel the recipe is perfect how it is. The kids won't eat sliced onions so the only change that I have made is  that I dice up onions and garlic and sprinkle them over the top of the first layer and put shredded mild cheddar cheese over the first layer then do a second layer with the sauce.

Made this at Christmas to go with a honey baked ham - an excellent combination. I doubled the recipe and, even though the potatoes were cooked through, I realized I should have left them in the oven longer to brown more on top. The next day, I put the leftovers in the oven and they "browned" like they should have the first time - much better. I really liked these, but somehow found them to be bland. I would love to know what spices to add next time to make them perfect!

This is a good basic recipe. I like cheese so I use different kinds to give it a richer flavor. Also, I increased the cheese to 2 cups. 1/2 cup of Cracker Barrel white cheddar, 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese, 1/2 cup of Gruyere yum! and 1/2 cup of Parmesan.  I layered half of the potatoes and sprinkled with smokey paprika, salt, pepper, and onion powder instead of onions. Pour 1/2 the cheese sauce over potatoes. After the second layer  of potatoes sprinkle again with seasonings. Pour the rest of the cheese sauce.  I baked it for 1 hour 15 min. Mixed up some butter with bread crumbs and put on top for an additional 15 min. Very yummy! Also, spray your pan with non stick spray. Helps with sticking and clean up.

Made this a couple of times.  Once as written except no onion and extra cheese.  Very good and creamy.  Second time made with a half cup sour cream mixed in.  The sour cream added some tangyness to the sauce which was good too.

I made several changes, some accidentally.  I'll try again and pay closer attention to the recipe next time.  First I doubled the recipe and pre-boiled the potatoes for 10 minutes after slicing and added 4 smashed cloves of garlic and 1 tsp. of salt to the water.  I didn't use sliced onion, didn't sound good to me, but I did dice 1/4 of a medium onion and sauteed in butter before making the rest of the sauce.  I added 1/4 tsp. each of nutmeg and cayenne pepper, and 1/2 tsp. of paprika before adding the flour to the sauce.  For the cheese, I used what was on hand which was 2 parts Colby-Jack and 1 part Swiss cheese.  Was out of milk so used one 12 oz. can evaporated milk with the same amount of water to make 3 cups.  I also added 1 c. half n' half.  I added pepper but no salt to each layer of potatoes when I put it all together...already enough salt in the recipe. I then topped the dish with 1/4 cup Italian bread crumbs and dotted with butter before baking.  I baked at 350 degrees by mistake instead of 400, covered for 40 minutes and uncovered for another 30.  I think the higher temperature would have been better because the top wasn't very brown and that makes a big difference in flavor.  By the way, I always pre-boil my potatoes because I never seem to have much luck if I don't.  Saves on time and doesn't dry out the dish.

Awesome recipe. Followed exactly except I used heavy cream instead of plain milk.

Rich and delicious. Remove oil an put nder broiler to brown the top a little and it's perfect

At an hour and 20 minutes the bottom potatoes burned. I only used a little less than 1/2 an onion because my family doesn't like onions and they said it was too oniony.

First time making this recipe. I had about a half of a large container of Ricotta cheese left from another meal I needed to use up, so I added it to the cheese sauce prior to adding the shredded cheese to the sauce.  I also used a mandolin to slice the potatoes thinner to approx an 1/8" for even cooking. I generously topped the dish with more shredded sharp cheddar cheese before putting it covered into the oven. After about an hour and 10 minutes, I removed the aluminum foil cover,  sprinkled unseasoned Panko bread crumbs over the entire dish and returned it to the oven uncovered to continue baking for the remaining 20 to 25 minutes.  

The extra added creaminess of the Ricotta cheese and the crispy Panko bread crumb topping made for tasty side dish.

Made it in the slow cooker on low for 4 hours, and chopped the onion finely instead of into rings. Turned out great!

This is a great base line recipe. The only differences I made was lessening the butter and using low-fat cheese. I have also made this with ham, in place of scalloped potatoes.

I used a mandolin to get the potato slices thin. I probably used less onion that the recipe required, but I also used the mandolin. The thin onion slices are virtually undetectable to the picky eaters.  I liberally salted and peppered every layer. And I used gruyere as the cheese. It was delicious. I served it with tenderloin on Christmas day, and it was a huge hit! People were negotiating for leftovers!

Left out the onions but added chives. Cut the salt down a bit and added extra cheese. As a base recipe this is excellent, I have already thought of many other dishes this will work well with.

Four stars for the original recipe. Five stars with my alterations. I've made this 3 times now. The first time as written and the next two times changing it up a bit. This last time for Christmas and it was by far the best dish on the table. I didn't have any onion this time and used onion powder in place. Extra sharp and sharp cheeses about half as much more than the recipe calls for. I also added a layer of partially steamed broccoli in between potatoes and cheese sauce. Wow!

Kicked up a bit with some Frank's hot sauce in the cheese and added a layer of gluten free bread crumbs to the top for the last 15 minutes. I could have taken them out about 5 minutes earlier as I had some scorching on the edges. Overall a great recipe, easy to make and very easy to eat.

I really liked this recipe, but I made modifications based on several reviews I read before I prepared the dish such as : cooked the sliced potatoes in water for 45 minutes in medium heat before. Did not add onions, used sharp cheddar cheese, made sure to grease the bottom of the pan very well before adding the 1st layer of potatoes and added bacon bites in the middle and in the top, removed the aluminum foil 15 minutes  before it is done to make a crispier and golden crust on the top. My family loved it and I will not make Au Gratins from boxes ever again!

This is the recipe you want!  Dice your onion, and precook the potatoes (about 10 mins in boiling water), and you will have success every time!  I never liked putting this dish together the way my mother did, with raw potatoes and sprinkled flour and pieces of butter; that just never worked well for me.  This recipe is much better, with the small changes I mention.

I prefer a browned topping (like in photo) so did not cover with foil. I also do not like onion rings, so added diced onion to butter before making roux, which made a nice flavor without the interruption to the potatoes.

I followed the recipe.  I did, however, substitute Mexican blend cheese for cheddar because trying different cheeses was recommended buy the poster of the recipe and I didn't have cheddar. I'm giving it four stars  because, as others have stated, it would be better with diced onions. It also begs for a pinch or two of garlic powder. I did uncover the dish toward the end of cooking to brown them. Even as is, I highly recommend giving this recipe a try.

Delicious and easy. Made a double recipe for my husband's birthday dinner and it was devoured completely. My family has informed me that this recipe is a keeper. Even my step-son, who hates onions, ate every bite that was on his plate and went back for more. I used a combination of sharp white cheddar cheese, colby jack and parmesan (the block cheese, not the shaker bottle) for deeper flavor.

Love this recipe. I made it for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it and have asked for it again. The only changes I made were to double the cheese sauce, and add two egg yolks to make it richer. I've made it with and without onions - it was great either way.

Good basic recipe, but I agree with the other reviewers...needs a little kick up and some minor changes. Takes it up to a WOW! First change --  I diced and sauteed the onions with some olive oil and garlic. Second -- I put one layer of the potatoes on the bottom of the dish, then covered with onions and topped with half of the cheese sauce ( I adjusted the seasonings with the cheese sauce as I made it with salt and pepper). I then put the remaining potato slices on top, and then another layer of cheese. I baked it in the oven for one hour covered. After removing the cover, I put another layer of finally shredded cheddar on the top and popped it back in for 30 minutes more uncovered. Keys...make sure you really get all of the flour stirred in the cheese sauce, clumps and such will cause the sauce to break when cooking. Slice your potatoes thin...1/4" is too thick for this baking time.

This dish was horrible!  The potatoes did not cook and I cooked them a half hour longer, also, the sauce did not go all the way through  I agree, no onions might have been better.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out pretty well. It did take a little longer to bake than the recipe says though. I used Cabot's Seriously sharp cheddar; flavor was very good, but that cheese is pale in color and the dish might have looked prettier with some orange cheese added too. I used 1/4" slices, but another time I would try cubing them. Yukon golds are a favorite on mine, I might try it with those next time also. This recipe is easy to make; my sister-in-law told me about her recipe - it would take way too long to make for me!

The "4 russets" is misleading.  What size?  How many pounds?  The ratio to potatoes/sauce means success or failed.  Now that I've made it, I can adjust to smaller potatoes.  But it would have been good to know for the first time.  Other than that, it was good.

Very tasty and easy to make!  I followed some of the other reviewers in cooking for a bit longer and broiling to get a browned top.  I also split the salt between 1/4 tsp truffle salt and 1/4 tsp rosemary salt.  I also sprinkled the bottom of the 9x13 pan with rosemary salt after I sprayed it with Pam and before I put any of the potatoes in.  The flavors were subtle but just enough to add a delicious flavor and not overpower the meal.

I made this today and it was awesome! Here is what I did different. I used about 2 potatoes but the same amount of sauce. It was very nice and moist. I used half and half instead of milk. In terms of spice, I omitted the pepper and used some nutmeg (fresh nutmeg grated) along with one clove garlic (crushed) in the sauce. I put a layer of sauce on the bottom of the pan which created a brown layer which everyone in my house likes. Overall wonderful recipe! Thank you.

Par boiling the potatoes was definitely needed; used chopped onions instead of rings...very well received with ham  for Christmas dinner this year!

I used white cheddar cheese this time would try again with Gruyere and some nutmeg next time and just a touch more salt and pepper. I used shallots instead of onions for more mild flavor.  But I like the cheese sauce for better coverage of flavor throughout the potatoes.  Very yummy.

This is the best and easiest Potato Au Gratin recipe that you will ever make.  I make this every Christmas along side a ham and Cesar salad, and everyone loves it.   This is the only time I pull out my mandolin, but it makes slicing the potatoes a breeze.  I follow the recipe very closely.  The only change I make is to finely dice the onion, and I probably only use about a half of an onion.  After I pour the cheese sauce over the top, I lift some of the potatoes to let the sauce get down through the layers.   Tip:  If you are running short on time and don't have over an hour for the potatoes to cook in the oven you can jump start the process by putting them in the microwave for 5 minutes before adding the cheese sauce.  This cuts the oven time in half and they still turn out perfect.  I also like to remove the aluminum foil during the last 5-10 minutes of cooking to let the edges and top brown a bit.

Excellent recipe.  I chopped the onions after reading other reviews.  I have used different cheddars for variety.  Also, I remove the foil last 15 min for a slightly browned top.

I have made these before and continue to use the recipe. They are delicious. However, my understanding of 'AuGratin' 
Indicates the use of Sour Cream.  So my own recipe tends to vary. I not only use sour cream in my au gratin's but I also use a little cream cheese to jazz it up even more! After I have thinly sliced the potatoes and sautéed the onions to soften, I add half of them and add half the sauce.  That way all the spuds get covered! And, they always turn out a little different each time – but they're always delightful! Thanks for a great base recipe! And Merry Christmas!

I  made this according to the recipe. Seemed bland to me it was creamy, but needed more spices.  Another thing that I didn't care for about this recipe, was with the cheese it made it very greasy.   I did leave out the onions though, just don't like the onions in my au gratin potatoes.

I have made this multiple times, and I am planning to make it again for Christmas.  Was refreshing my memory on the recipe and was shocked to read that the onions are just sliced and layered in.  I could have sworn it was caramelized onions, which is how I cook it.  I guess I must have just read the recipe the first time and thought  caramelized onions sounded better.  So that is my suggestion, because it is delicious.  Caramelize your onions in olive oil or butter before you layer them in.  I also use several different kinds of cheese instead of just cheddar (Cheddar, Parmesan, Romano, Asiago) for more depth of flavor.  Also, as other reviewers have suggested, I make 1.5 times the cheese sauce and layer it in the potatoes. It is delicious.  Anyway, I have had this recipe pinned in my email since March of 2013 (I guess I must have made them at Easter the first time), and it will likely remain the only recipe I keep pinned in my email. Delicious.  Have I said the word delicious enough?   Delicious.

I followed the  recipe but added cubed pit ham, used less salt, and 1/4 cup chicken stock with the milk. I used a gouda, mild cheddar, and sharp cheddar combination - it turned out beautifully. One of my hubby's fave meals this week

A bit bland even though I added a bit of other cheese. Will make it again adding some additional flavor (nutmeg or  maybe a little fresh thyme) also will up the percentage of other cheese. Lastly, no matter what you do, take the cover off the last 20 minutes or so. Or, take the cover off and turn on the broiler for about 10 minutes.

Following the directions for this only made a "luke warm" response. Maybe too much onion and not something else. It was good, but lacked what my Mom use to make. Open for suggestions to enhance the flavor.

it was exactly what 3 stars say, okay. I like to try new recipes verbatim at first before tinkering and I stayed with this one other than the thickness of the potatoes and onions. Recipe calls for 1/4 thick but as my mandolin does not adjust, they were both cut closer to an 1/8 and I believe this also affected the cooking time. the potatoes were more mushy than I felt they should be for au gratin and the onions seemed to be too much. And though I did add a bit more cheese than called for they just didn't seem all that cheesy (or creamy for that matter). I also had to put under the broiler for a couple minutes to help the aesthetics . Not sure if the thickness of the ingredients was the issue but would definitely tinker with recipe is used again

I followed a number of the tweaks, including chopping and sauteing the onion first, making additional cheese sauce, and adding some cheese sauce between the layers. I cooked it covered for 1 hour 10 minutes and then uncovered for another 30 minutes. It was a hit at a holiday party!

I made this by the recipe given and although it was good it was a little under seasoned for our taste.  Next time I'll add some  more s&p and maybe some bacon. Also I'll split the cheese sauce and layer it in the potatoes.

Made as is. The trick is to slice the onion paper thin. Everybody's oven is different.  If a knife doesn't poke into it like soft butter, its not done yet and leave it in longer.

Very yummy! My family absolutely loved it. I used a pizza blend for my cheese and topped it with smoked paprika and parsley flakes. I also uncovered it for the last 20 minutes of cooking to get that beautiful golden look.

This recipe is almost exactly like the one I have used for years.  Except - I dice the onion and use a red onion; I also use 1 Tablespoon of Mrs. Dash Original seasoning  and use a 2 quart glass or ceramic casserole dish.  I just layer every thing and dot the layers with chunks of butter. and of course salt, pepper and Mrs. Dash.  I also use the Mexican Blend shredded cheese - about 2 cups total.  Then, because my oven is usually full with either turkey, ham or prime rib - I pop the dish into my microwave for 25 minutes.  That way I am also assured that I have no under done potatoes ever.

I am surprised at all the rave reviews this got. I read a lot of the comments and diced the onions instead of using rings as many suggested. I also used a 2 qt casserole. I don't know how it could have fit in a 1 qt dish. I put half the potatoes in the dish, seasoned with salt and pepper then put the rest in and seasoned them again, then poured the cheese sauce on it. Took the foil off the last 20 minutes as others suggested. When I pulled it out of the oven it seemed to be swimming in oil.  Some seemed to be absorbed back in after it rested but maybe it calls for too much butter. I don't know. The flavor just wasn't there either. We both prefer the box stuff to this.

I made it. Chopped the onions fine instead of rings and used Gruyere cheese. Delicious.

Like other reviewers have said, sliced at 1/4 inch my potatoes weren't done in 1.5 hours. I like a pronounced cheesy flavor and added an extra cup of cheese to my sauce. It was a little thicker but still creamy and tasted oh-so-good. I used Tillamook Sharp Cheddar, which gave it great flavor. Also, note that if you buy your potatoes by the bag from Costco like I do, that 2 of their giant russet potatoes is probably sufficient for this recipe. I had A LOT of leftover sliced potatoes! I also thinly diced onion and  put some of  the cheese sauce between potato layers, and used one cup of 1% milk (what we drink in our house) and one cup of heavy cream for the creamier texture in the sauce.

I made this to go with a baked ham, and it turned out perfect! I didn't change the recipe at all and I will be making this again and again. It's worth the 90 minute wait for baking.

This recipe eas phenomenal! I mean fingerlicking good. Totally a hit. Did this for a side in thanksgiving this year and it was the bomb. Everyone loved it there were NO leftovers in my house this time. The only thing i did differently as one reviewer mentioned is added way more sauce and did it like a lasagna (one layer of potatoes, one layer of onions, salt /pepper, then the sauce, and continued doing the same till i reached the top of my caserol) i also used the brioler and added some more shredded cheese and parmessan at the top and viola ! Delish !

I followed the recipe as written with the exception of uncovering towards the end to let things brown up - and I thought it was absolutely perfect!  Will definitely make again; this was quite simple and so much better than the boxed - although make sure you have plenty of time, this took more than 90 minutes to get the potatoes to my liking.

I used a little more than 3 pounds of potatoes to feed 8 people. Then I increased the milk and cream to about one third more than the recipe states. This turned out great, and was almost completely devoured at the dinner party at which I shared this dish. Most importantly, it was a breeze to make, assemble and cook. Highly recommend!

Very similar to how I make my cheese sauce for Mac and cheese. To make it more if a main dish I added chicken. I think ham would be good too...maybe ill try that next time.   Great recipe!!  Saved to my favorites....

Tasted awesome, the only change that I made to the recipe was that I seasoned the potatoes and the onions before putting them in the baking dish cause I wanted it to be properly seasoned throughout and it turned out just awesome! Great recipe and pretty simple to cook as well!

I followed the recipe as is and did not find anything wrong with it. The only thing I added was a pinch of nutmeg, because I like the mild flavor that it gives to a gratin. As for everything else I did not find this recipe bland at all. I adjusted the salt to my liking and did not use much pepper.  I may switch to swiss cheese or gruyere instead of cheddar to see how it goes. As an overall is very good!

I have been making this dish for years and it is always a big hit. Sometimes I use the food processor to chop everything up, but the best results come when you hand chop the potatoes. I also don't do rings of onions, I opt for diced onions. I add a bit of extra cheese, and layer the onions, potatoes, cheese like a lasagna. On each layer I usually add some type of mild seasoning like fresh thyme, crushed red pepper, salt and pepper, garlic etc. Last night I put some bread crumbs on top and at the end of the cooking process, removed the foil to brown the top. Best yet!! Thanks for the recipe!

These were simply delicious. Skipped the onion because I have never heard of onion in au gratin potatoes.  The only complaint is have is the whole bottom layer of potatoes burnt to the bottom of the pan. My oven must be hotter. I'll do an hour next time. But the burnt just peeled right off it wasn't a mess to clean (spray the pan) my kids ate 2 helpings each, which is kind of a big deal. 

Will be making these to go with our Christmas ham. 

Thanks!

This is a great recipe but I made a few changes for my own taste preferences. I also took some advice from other reviews.
I omitted the onions during the cooking process. I thought doubling the sauce would be too much so I just added another 1/2 which was perfect. I also used a 2 quart casserole dish and removed the foil the last 15 minutes. My husband loves bacon, so when I removed the foil, I sprinkled on a few slices of bacon that I fried and chopped. Another nice addition since I removed the onions is to add some chopped green onion just before serving. Everyone just loved it. I will never buy boxed again.

I have been making my version of this recipe for a while, to rave reviews, so I thought it only fair that I finally write one of my own.

This is such a great recipe and use of a lovely cheese sauce.  In my humble opinion, nothing is better as a side dish than scalloped potato and this recipe allows the cook to experiment with ingredients without ruining its essence.  

Here are my tweaks, in case anyone is interested:
1. as others have noted, onion can overtake the flavor and I found that the additional water in the onions can throw off the sauce balance, if you're not careful.   instead, mince fresh garlic (4-5 cloves, more depending on taste) and sprinkle it on the first potato layer, 
2. let the butter brown and clarify before adding the flour, 
3.  let the roux get very brown and fragrant while constantly whisking and before adding the milk;  I sometimes substitute a cup of milk with a cup of cream and have been known to add well-cooked bacon crumbles to the sauce, yum!, 
4. double the sauce recipe and make sure you shake the pan well to fully cover the potatoes before putting in the oven

I made this as posted and while the flavor is very good the timing is way off. You MUST parboil the potatoes or the will be firm/hard. More credit to the flavor than the instructions.

Followed the recipe and it turned out really good! My family was using boxed au gratin potatoes which I hate so I always offer to bring this instead. I get compliments on it every time. Very moist and cheesy.

Great recipe! Will be doing these again. They are perfect, creamy, but not too creamy/heavy. Followed almost exactly but added some mustard and Worcestershire sauce to the sauce, also some crushed chili peppers,  took this idea from a mac and cheese recipe ... As someone else mentioned the sauce would work for mac and cheese, this works great for me since my son does not eat potatoes.

This recipe is a keeper. The only things I did differently are; Instead of the "1 quart" casserole dish called for, I used a 3 quart (9" X 13") casserole dish. Unless you are using some really tiny potatoes, there is no way to fit all the ingredients into the smaller dish.  I also added about 1/2 cup of shredded cheese directly on the top of the casserole and cooked it under the broiler for the final few minutes. This improved the appearance and gave an additional toasted cheese flavor.

Pretty darn good next to ham! I read other reviews and sautéed the onion with minced garlic. Doubled the recipe and added more sharp cheddar with a splash of whipping cream. Uh, so delicious!

Really liked the simplicity of this dish.  My husband loves the flavour of onions so left them in raw slices.  I sliced the russet potatoes very thinly with a mandolin and they were all even but felt that the dish could have done with a tiny bit longer cooking.  The potatoes were only just cooked.  The cheese sauce I added a little mustard to.  The cheese sauce is a slightly thinner version of my Mac and Cheese recipe and came out very well.

This really is delicious! I had to make this in a slow cooker instead of the oven (due to a ham cooking at a much lower temperature). 2-2.5 hours on high with slightly less milk does the trick! Delish! And truly the best cheese sauce I've ever made!

Well, thank you!  I did a little of this and a little of that.  Added some fresh rosemary and a touch of fresh thyme.  Used less cheese than recipe called for.  Probably a cup or so.  And only had Colby Jack, so used that.  Eyeballed the milk.  And used a bit less onion than recipe called for.  I would say all in all, stayed true to the recipe and it was fantastic!!

Incredible! I used the leftover sauce in macaroni and cheese. I loved this recipe. We did use a 2 quart pan instead of a  1 quart pan. We chopped the onion up really well instead of doing big rings. I think this was the way to go. It really was a delicious dish!

Great side dish!  Great flavor! Made exactly  as written except used 2 cups of cheese just because  most bags of shredded cheeses are 2 cup bags.  I was thinking about why people were saying that the dish was bland and maybe it's because we eat so much processed food (boxed potato/rice side dishes) that we think that that's what our food should taste like but it's not the amount of sodium in those things is killing us.

I made this last night as a guilty-pleasure side to a main-course salad meal. I made a few changes: 1. I used shredded Gruyere cheese instead of the cheese listed; 2. diced the onion instead of slice; and 3. Added 4 strips of cooked chopped bacon to the top before cooking; and 4. Added chives after cooking. I also made this gluten-free by using a gluten free all purpose flour. It was delicious!

This was my first time making this. And it was oh so delicious! It was gone in less than 5 minutes. LOL. I should've made a lot more. Just like what the other mentioned, I also did NOT put onions (but it's up to you). I made extra sauce and put layers of sauce and put extra cheese on top of it. Also, when I made it I didn't have cheddar cheese. So I used Velveeta Mozzeralla cheese instead since that's what I have in the fridge. I was concern how will it turn out at first since I used a different cheese. But I'm glad I did. It was soo good!!! Everyboday loved it and finished everything in less than 5 minutes. Thank you for sharing this recipe! Planning to make it again.

This turned out excellent. I followed the recipe exactly. Recipe filled a 9x13 pan. I had doubts the bechemel would be enough, but in the end it was delicious. Very creamy and cheesey. Everyone at dinner raved about it. Next time I'm going to play with the cheese type.

Delish! I added some garlic powder to the potatoes along with the salt and pepper, sauteed the onions before mixing in, and upped the sauce by 50% per reviewers' suggestions. Turned out great! Also took the foil off the last 15 min or so to help brown the top a smidge. Thank you!!

Very good but next time I will try to thicken it up a little. UPDATE: I made this again using an extra half cup of shredded cheese, it was perfect! I also made it in the crock pot, cooked on low for about 4 hours, quick and easy!

I used 8 thinly sliced russet potatoes (no need to peel), made the white sauce in microwave using  3 T butter, 3T flour,  1 1/2 c milk, also added garlic, seasoning salt and a bit of Montreal steak spice.  Added 1 1/2 c grated cheese and once put together topped with 1/2 c grated cheddar and some Italian breadcrumbs.  Baked at 350F for 1 hr 15 min. Need longer time if making larger batch.

My family loved this. After reading other reviews I did not use the onions called for in the recipe. I added onion powder instead. I also sliced my potatoes very thin with a mandolin. Big mistake! Have never had this happen before but my potatoes turned ugly gray color. Family ate them anyway and loved the taste. Next time I will follow the recipe and slice 1/4 inch.

I doubled the recipe for the number of people I was serving.   Made as written except diced the onions and scattered throughout the layers.   Didn't have sharp cheddar on hand so added a few dashes of Worcester sauce to the cheese sauce,  along with lots of pepper.   Everyone loved it

I did make some changes to add a bit of flavor. I minced the onions and sauteed with butter before adding flour. I added 1/2 tsp garlic powder. I used 1-1/2 Cups milk plus 1/2 Cup sour cream. I increased cheese to 2 Cups and mixed in some extra sharp cheddar.

I have made this for Thanksgiving for a number of years, and my family loves it! The only thing I do differently once in awhile is to use onion powder in the sauce as opposed to slices of onion when cooking for family members that can't stand onions. :)

As for the negative reviews, you're supposed to season to taste, so do some tasting! If you know you like something spicier, add a little kick, but don't down-rate a recipe simply because you didn't add enough seasoning. 

There is nothing wrong with the recipe for the sauce. You do have to make certain you maintain the proportions of fat, flour and liquid, and prepare it as described.  If you deviate significantly from the procedure, it will not be right--but that's the basics of gravy/sauce preparation. If you can't make gravy, you'll have trouble making a good sauce.

Delicious!  Used Yukon Gold potatoes from the garden and sliced enough to fill 1-1/2 quart Pyrex covered casserole dish.  Lightly coated the potatoes with salt and pepper before layering them in casserole dish. Finely diced the onions and layered them with potatoes. Added 1/2 tsp minced garlic and 1/2 cup extra cheese to sauce. Baked covered at 375 for 1-1/2 hours. I've never made a cheese sauce before so I stirred it really good before pouring it over potatoes and then poked the sauce around to coat the potatoes/onions. My husband loved these and had seconds!

This was super easy and  super yummy!!! I used a mix of American, cheddar and swiss and cooked it on the grill at 375 for an hour and a half. (It cooked with a pork roast) Everyone loved it and I am making it again this weekend!

We love this recipe. Although, I only make it as a special treat because it is high in calories and other things. But it is the best I have ever tried.

Wow.  This was delicious.  I've never made augratin potatoes other than a box :) so this was my first time.  I'll never make them any other way again.  Made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it.    I bumped up the recipe for 6 people but I only ended up using 5 potatoes because it all wouldn't fit in a 3 qt dish.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and tried to move around the potatoes a bit after pouring the sauce over, to make sure some sauce can get down to the bottom.  It worked ok, but I think next time I'd just pour a little of the sauce over the potatoes and onions before adding the 2nd layer of potatoes.  I also sauteed the onions a bit before putting them in.  This recipe is a keeper!

Good recipe! I've made this twice. First time didn't turn out as well, the sauce was a little too thin and it was runny. The second effort was much better. The measurements seem a little off to me though, so that's why the four stars.

I was not really a fan of these then again we always had the box kind as a kid. My husband & kids liked this recipe a lot. I diced the onions and reserved 1/2 cup of cheese to top the potatoes the last 5 minutes of cooking. The potatoes took longer than 1.5 hours and I personally felt they were rather bland.

I made this last night for family & there was no leftovers. I did use some of the other s suggestions. I made extra sauce (3cups of milk instead of 2) and 1/2 cup more cheese.  I made bacon for the top.  I cut the onions & added garlic.  I sautéed them in bacon grease and layerered with potato. And covered in sauce.  When they were done,  I sprinkled 1/2 cup cheese,  bacon crumbled &  some green onions and put the lid on.  They rested 20 min and were still pipping hot & delicious.  This will go into my favorite recipes.  Thank you very much for sharing.

Followed the recipe and it was a success! My entire family loved it :D I did however, poured the creamy cheese sauce in the middle (potato, onion, potato, sauce, potato, sauce) and I sprinkled lots of black pepper powder in between too for extra taste. Perfect!

This was easy to put together and the result was perfect. Creamy, cheesy, onion-y... everything I want in an au-gratin dish.  

I did cut my potatoes considerably thinner than 1/4 inch (which I personally think must be a typo). I cut mine to about 1/8 inch using a mandolin, and the dish was ready to serve in just under an hour.

Be sure to season well, or this will be bland (I had to add just a bit more salt to this first attempt after it was on the plate).

I'll be making this again and again for sure.

DELICIOUS! We loved these and will make them a permanent side dish in our menu. I did make one alteration: Instead of raw onions, I sauteed the onions in the butter (just until they were translusant), then I added the flour to the onion butter mixture and followed the rest of the directions. It was delicious!

Very good recipe--light touch up.  Wife is allergic to yellow cheese so used a 5 blend white cheese.  Had to make a double batch of sauce to cover but used 1.5 qt baking dish.  Used  garlic powder to spiff up too

Au Gratin potatoes are my number one fav for potato side dishes.  This recipe is a good starting point.   I didn't give 5 stars because I had to modify it to suit my tastes.  The first time I made it, I followed the directions exactly with the exception of the onions (since I don't like them)  It was much too dry.  I like  au gratin potatoes to be nice and creamy.  I've made it a few times since then, modifying it slightly each time and it's now closer to my preferences.

I followed the recipe exactly - except I used cheddar jack cheese because my husband isn't a strong cheese lover.  It was a little bland so next time I'll go for sharp cheddar for more flavor.  Otherwise, very tasty and simple to make.  And I got to use my new mandolin to slice the potatoes and onions - Fun!

This was the first time I have made potatoes au gratin from scratch, and honestly I don't see myself going back to that crappy boxed kind anytime soon.

 I made the recipe as instructed, but left out the onions because there are picky eaters in my household. It didn't matter though, because the dish was just as good without.

Another change that I made was changing the amount of potatoes and cheese that the recipe called for. Someone in my household impulsively bought potatoes and they were on the verge of going bad, so I just used as many as I could. That means that I had to stretch the rest of my resources and kind of improvise. Without measuring I want up with too much cheese, but again I hold that against myself and not the poster of this recipe.

Next time I would like to try it with less cheese and maybe a sprinkle of coarsely chopped bacon.

I have made this over and over again.  It is awesome.  I only made a few changes:  I diced the onions up really finely, and I tossed the potatoes in the cheese sauce before I layered them and the diced onions into the dish.  It does make a mess of the dish.  Definitely use cooking spray in the pan first.  My husband and in-laws loved it.

Great recipe. I diced the onions instead of slices and added more cheese. The potatoes I sliced much thinner than 1/4". I used half and half instead of milk. Rich and creamy everyone loves them.

I think it was too cheesy.  Other than that I kinda made mine too saucy.  I was trying to be equivalent to the potato size because I did not have russet.

Fantastic!! This was my first time making Au gratin Potatoes from scratch and they were a hit!! I omitted the onions because my kids hate onions and I followed some other reviewer's advice. I increased the recipe by half. I seared and seasoned the potatoes first with onion powder, garlic powder, salt & pepper, Italian seasoning, and paprika to taste. I used fresh sharp cheddar and Parmesan and grated it myself for a smoother and flavorful cheese sauce. I also added crumbled up bacon on top and put aluminum foil over the dish for the first hour and then added Italian bread crumbs and left uncovered for the last 30 mins. I will definitely be making this again!!

Delicious! I made it just as the recipe reads except that I added a little more cheese. (we LOVE cheese in our house) I shredded in some parmesan and added some extra cheddar on top. A big hit with the entire extended family as well!

I used to make au gratin using a can of cheese soup.  Those days are so over.  Making my own cheese sauce tastes a million times better and it's much easier than you'd think.  Great to make on a chilly day to help warm up the house with a lovely aroma.

Per other reviewers' suggestions, I omitted the onions completely.It's much better without them. To cut down on baking time, I boiled the sliced potatoes for 15 minutes before putting them in a casserole dish. I used a 2.5-quart casserole dish, which was perfect. A 1-quart dish is too small. I baked them for 40 minutes, removing the foil for the last 15 minutes of bake time. With modifications, it is a good base recipe.

To avoid any chance of the sauce not getting through the potato layers, I mixed the potatoes, onions and sauce all together in a bowl and then put in my baking dish. Worked like a charm. Will definitely make again.

The first time I forgot to cover and the cheese got nice and brown but the ham I put on top burnt.  I also split in to 2 pans because I didn't have a big enough one.  The first time the potatoes were done.

Last night I did this again.  I covered it this time.  I pan instead of 2.  The potatoes are not done.

I really think that this needs to be uncovered for a certain amount of time or needs to cook longer.

It might help to say lbs of potatoes instead of 4 because not all potatoes are the same size.

My family loved them. I left skins on. Used more cheese including velvetta and after they cooked about 60 minutes, I sprinkled more velvetta on top and some toasted panko bread crumbs. Left foil off for last 30 minutes so they could brown. Came out wonderful and I will make again. Next time I will use red pototoes.

Very good and flavorful.  Easy to make for a holiday. 

Only suggestions/comments:
-It is much less messy in a 2 quart container-- it doesn't overflow.
-Dice the onions if you do not like a lot of onion in one bite.  
-Personal preference: A little less onion.  2/3 of an onion is plenty.

Read other comments first, and used the idea of chopping onions and putting some sauce on each layer.  To keep sauce from being "too bland,". I added 1/2 tsp of paprika.  As it was very thick, I added 1/2 cup white wine.  I thought it was terrific -- 2nd time I made it, but made changes only this time.

I only gave it four stars because the recipe calls for four potatoes which in my family is NEVER enough.  I used 9 potatoes and kept the rest of the recipe the same (well okay I may have added a little more butter) and I cooked it in my crockpot on high for two hours (I also added about 1/2 cup of chicken stock while it was in the crockpot to be sure there was enough moisture to cook the potatoes) and then finished in the oven to brown the top after our roast was done for about 15 minutes.  It was wonderful!

Love to make this for Easter dinner. The only thing I added is 3/4 c bread crumbs mixed with 3/4 cup parmesan cheese. Put on top of potatoes before baking. Yum!

Really 3.5 stars.. I made the recipe following some other reviewer's advice - sauteed diced onion in butter and garlic, used 2 cups of sharp cheese and sliced the onions on the largest grater setting. I also did them in the slow cooker for 5 1/2 on low.  Still, I found this dish to be bland which I understand is the way scalloped potatoes are but, I've definitely had better. It just wasn't worth all of the calories, fat and sodium. Oh well, I will continue to look for an alternative to mashed potatoes!

It was very good.  I omitted the onions because they bother my stomach.  I loved how cheesy they were but my husband said he would rather have less cheese.  This is a keeper with my changes.

I made this just as written, but doubled it and took it to a large dinner party.  Everyone raved about it!    My only suggestion is to use a little less milk, as it was a bit soupy.  Leftovers, if there were any, would have been better than if there were less milk, though.  Your call.

Delish! My guy loves potatoes.
He is always buying the box au gratin potatoes. I hate them.  So I decided to do this recipe. We don't like onions. But, I did add  onion powder& garlic powder with seasoning salt and Zatarins pepper which I use above black pepper any day. I also added some Parmesan cheese I had on hand. I thought it could have used more cheese. But my guy said it was perfect. He ate 2 helpings and leftovers the next day. A keeper

I added a little more cheese and also used a Velveeta type cheese, was really good. After I got all ingredients mixed I put it in my smoker for about 30 minutes. Then brought them in and covered them and put them in the oven. Came out great! Little smoke flavor everyone loved them...

I thought this was a great recipe that went perfect with ham!  I gave it 4 stars mostly because I needed a larger dish to put it in, and I also had trouble knowing when the sauce "thickened". Also- I would make sure you put a cookie sheet a level beneath your dish in the oven- I had a bit of sauce bubble out of the side of my dish and was glad I had one underneath to catch it.  Great taste!

Excellent! I precooked the potatoes and onions due to time constraints, but ratios and flavors were spot on.  This is my new go to recipe. Thank you! Oh, 1 alteration... I added 2 cloves garlic to the roux...

I made this last night and it was good, but I learned a few things. Next time I will turn the temp down because the cheese burned. Also, when I took it out of the oven I had pools of grease/butter all over the top. It was so much that I needed to ladle it off. Also, my sauce separated because of so much grease. I'm going to cut back on the butter next time and maybe use a lower fat cheese or a mix of regular and low fat. I also diced the onion so the flavor would be distributed throughout the dish. Overall, the dish was good, but it was just too greasy for me. I will work fixing that.

Delicious only thing I changed was I used a little under a quarter of an onion instead of a whole onion and used about 8 small russet potatoes. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious. Used foil over a  glass dish and it cooked in an hour.  Replaced onion with diced shallot and one clove garlic. I am very wary of raw onion but it was fine with out a pre-saute.

Best au gratin potatoes I have ever made! I used 3 yellow potatoes and baked only for 1 hour and they were done. It was delicious, certainly not bland. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Made the following changes. Diced the onion and did not use more than 1/2 cup. Used 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup whole milk. Cooked for 2.5 hours. 2 hours with foil and 1/2 hour uncovered.  Potatoes were not done a 1.5 hours. Used 1 cup cheddar  and  1 cup smoked cheddar. Added a clove of crushed garlic to the butter after it was melted then added the flour. It was good but a bit dry. Think I will try 2.5 cups of milk/heavy cream next time. My family liked it so I will try again

This was the first time I've made a rue and it turned out great! This is a great dish. I usually make scalloped potatoes but didn't have the right ingredients so I found this. The cheese is wonderful and I will try it with macaroni too. The recipe was easy to follow and I had everything needed. I sliced the potatoes with my mandolin, so they were uniform which helped the recipe work well. This recipe is a keeper for us!

I loved the way it turned out. It was super easy to make but I suspected it would be a bit too bland for my taste. So I added lots of garlic and a pinch of red chilly powder in the sauce and seasoned it with dried oregano before popping it in the oven. The onions tasted good but next time, I might do away with it. Maybe I will replace them with cauliflowers. I will definitely try this again when I need to whip something up quickly and want to eat something sinful.

Good, simple recipe. I used mild cheddar and a TBS. of onion powder (my wife won't eat onions). I will be making this again but, will try a stronger cheese. Maybe try the sharp cheddar, like mentioned in other reviews.

Yes,  added fresh garlic and onions.  When cooking it put aluminum foil over it, shiny side. down.  Cooked for 40 to 45 minutes.  And then cook uncovered to brown  and add crispness.  My kids loved it.  I cooked it in 1 hour.

Super easy and delicious!!!! I only use half onion, and chopped to small pieces. Potato sliced thinner than suggested. I put alot more cheese for the white sauce (i use Bega extra tasty), and topped with mozarella after.  Used 2 small ramekins, and done in about 1 hour and 10 min. Thank you for sharing this recipe! Absolutely my favorite!!

These were extremely delicious. I would probably leave out the onions as my son is kind of picky but will definitely be making again. I love making homemade cream/cheese sauces.

These were pretty good. A little bland, but just needs salt and pepper. Will make again, will try to add some crushes croutons or bread crumbs on top.

This was super good as a side dish for steaks, but we probably won't be making it again unfortunately. I followed the recipe minus the onion, and my husband loved it... too much. He ate so many that he had an upset stomach. Now he can't stand the idea of eating them again, argh! So warning to those of you that love cheddar potatoes: eat in moderation! The cheese mixture is very rich, so don't take too big of a helping unless you can handle it. Otherwise it's a great recipe, and it's got a lot of room for changes and experimentation.

Made two changes 
Sautéed onions in garlic and few drops of olive oil.
Added dry English mustard to the cheese sauce for an extra kick.
Otherwise delicious as a side or main when added left over ham chunks .

A great recipe, potatoes are nice and creamy and rich.  I omit the onions and add extra cheese though.  The potatoes don't have much cheese flavor as written.

Very good!  Incredibly simple, and delicious.  I keep a can of Wondra flour handy and use it for making white sauce.  I makes my roux fool-proof.   I also cut my potatoes thinner than called for, baked it at 350 degrees for 45 minutes, then the last 15 minutes at 400 degrees.  Simple and delicious!

These are the best augratin potatoes I've ever had!  I didn't change a thing, except adding more cheese. To make things easier and faster, I first microwaved the sliced potatoes for 4 minutes. Then I layered them with sauce between layers. I also diced the onion instead of slicing.  A good sauce-making hint, if you want onions in your dish, saute the onions in the butter, then add the flour and stir for a couple of minutes, then add the milk. Thanks again for the recipe. My husband now wants these once a week

This recipe is so easy and so good, I will most certainly be making it again. The only changes I made were to add a little more salt & pepper and more spices in general; garlic & chili powder and some red pepper flakes, but that's just a personal preference.

Yes.  Used chopped onions instead of sliced.  Added onion to butter and flour mixture to soften onions.
Delicious.

Very good! I used onion and garlic powder because it blends better.  I also added more cheese, as per reviews.  Followed the rest and it turned out great.  Family liked them and this will be included in my recipe file.

I loved this recipe and am about to make it again.  I like that it is a recipe that does not use processed items like canned soup.  I did slice my potatoes a lot thinner and I mixed the sauce and potatoes rather than layering.   It's delicious!

We loved it. However, next time I will cook it about an hour and 15 minutes rather than an hour and a half. Or lower the temperature. The bottom and edges burned a little. It didn't affect the dish but it wasn't fun cleaning the casserole dish.

This came out great! I did do a couple of changes. Chopped the onions and cooked them in butter just to translucent and then tossed them with the 8 min. Microwaved potatoes that someone else suggested. So cook time was 45 min. Took off foil last 15 mins. Turned off oven with 10 mins left. Was great will do again for sure everyone loved them.

I made it as printed and it turned out wonderful. I used extra sharp cheddar so it had a little bite. It was a little on the bland side but the cheesy creaminess completely made up for that. I put crumbled bacon on top and my brother scooped those up right off. I made a large casserole of it and was a little hesitant to add more milk but just added more cheese and made more rue. (used a whole stick of butter) Fantastic, great simple recipe!

I made it differently. Made sour cream and onions. I diced the onions and for the  cheese sauce I added 2 cups of sour cream and add white cheddar instead of the regular cheddar. And added the sauce after each layer of potatoes and onions and top it with more cheese on top. And afte it's done top it with green onions. It's was family's favorite

Absolutely delicious.  I made this last night with broiled salmon and asparagus and it was a hit.  I used 2% lactose free milk instead of whole milk, 8 oz bag of triple cheddar Kraft mix and I greased the casserole dish with butter flavored Crisco.   Definitely will do again.

I followed the recipe exactly, although I may have sprinkled a bit of extra cheese on top to make it pretty afterwards ;) It was soooooo good. I'm already making it again, three days later.

In addition to following some advice in the comments (sliced the potatoes thinner, used more cheese, skipped the onion, have layers) I also added some more seasoning- it is initially on the bland side. I love garlic so I added some minced in the first layer. Parsley can also work, and for me shallots and chives would mesh better with the potatoes. 

The next time I make this I may use less butter as well.

Oh, one more thing: the milk. The recipe called for two cups, but I ultimately ended up using no more than 1c, possibly 3/4th. Then again, I had fewer potato and had to scale accordingly. I'd recommend adding the milk til you have your desired consistency- you want enough to be just below potato-level, at most.

Thought this was great. Made the recipe exactly as is. Layered half the potatoes on the bottom, did the layer of onions (didn't leave the onions in rings...cut the rings into halves), sprinkled generously with salt and pepper, spread half the cheese mixture, and then did the last layer of potatoes and topped it off with the remaining cheese sauce. I used butter russets and they turned out great. I also used the kitchen aid slicer attachment for the potatoes and it made everything very easy and fast. Delicious!

This is a new favorite. I diced half a yellow onion and sautéed in a little butter before adding back to the sliced potatoes. My slices were more like 1/8". I added a fair amount of salt and pepper to the mixture, and then mixed everything together instead of just layering to get all the cheesy goodness throughout.  Will make again for sure.

I substituted Yukon gold potatoes and probably used 10 potatoes and 3 small onions. I made an extra half of the sauce mixture because I thought I had more potatoes than the recipe called for. It still only took 1.5 hrs. In the oven and was delicious! Everyone at dinner loved it.

I microwave the potatoes for about 4 minutes, let them cool enough to handle, then slice them.  I also used chopped onions (maybe 1/2 cup) which I sauteed in the butter before adding the flour, etc. to the sauce.  Per Emily's suggestion, I added cheese between layers and topped with panko crumbs.  Only had to bake for about an hour since the potatoes were slightly pre-cooked.  Delish!

I don't like scalloped potatoes nor cheese myself, but found a way to make a one portion version for my husband.  Just used one potato, half an onion, and just made enough sauce to cover it all.   Added a lot of garlic (as he loves garlic) and cooked covered for 1 hour, then another 25 uncovered.  He loved it!

I double it (using a 3 qt shallow casserole dish).  I also dice the onions & add some cooked ham.  I also slice the pototoes as thinly as possible (thinner than 1/4 inch thick) with a heavy, sharp knife.  With the pototoes cut much thinner, I only have to cook for 70 minutes.  :)

These were wonderful. I made a double batch for a party. I also added a bit extra cheese because whoever said you could have too much cheese.  They were a huge hit. Definitely a do over.

I've always enjoyed au gratin potatoes and making them myself with this recipe was awesome!  Absolutely loved them, and will definitely make them again.  Only thing different I did was check them just after an hour and they seemed to be good to go already.  About 70-75 minutes was all it took for me.  Try this recipe out if you like au gratins!  It's delicious, plus very simple to make!

Family favorite. I added a little garlic powder and smoked paprika to the cheese mixture to bump up the flavor a little.  Delicious!

This was a big hit with my family.  Everyone had seconds!  The changes I made and would not make:  1.  Keep the onions.  I thought they were a little distracting at first, but most others said they added a flare to the taste and i agreed after i changed my expectations.  2. Keep the onions sliced, not minced.  This made it easy for the one guest who didn't like onions to remove them! 3. Reduce cheddar by a half cup; replace with 1/4 cup parmesan and 1/4 cup pizza cheese, which has some spices in it.  4.  Double the recipe for a perfect 9x13 size that feeds about 10.

Excellent recipe. Creamy, delicious, and the golden brown top makes a great presentation. I did use whipping cream as I didn't have any milk, and I forgot to spray the dish so I ended up pouring it all in a bowl and then dumping it all back in, but it came out great anyway. I'll make the same mistakes next time!

Fabulous taste! The only change I made was I used green onions instead of sliced white onion. The recipe is simple and easy to follow and very easy to make. Crowd pleaser!

Love this recipe! I too add a bit more cheese and put the sauce and a bit more cheese between the layers. I caramelize the onions (we like that flavor with the cheese and potatoes) and add more cheese to the top after it comes out of the oven. This recipe lends itself to a lot different interpretations which is another reason it is so great.

This is a great recipe!  takes some time, but worth it.  I used a cup of sharp cheddar cheese and a half cup cheddar to give it a little more flavor.

I rated this 4 stars because I changed it a bit. I was already planning to make another potatoe recipe and changed my mind at the last minute. I already had the ingredients for that recipe which included Gruyere cheese. I used smoked Gruyere instead of the cheddar. I had to giggle at the debate between those that thought it bland and those that felt that it's comfort food and doesn't need lots of spicing up. I ended up adding some chipotle flakes. This tasted great, but will definitely make it with cheddar cheese for more of that comfort food feel.

Made this for Christmas. The cheese sauce is perfect and was simple to make. I needed my oven for ham so I put this in the slow cooker in layers. I also chopped up and cooked the onions first. I did 2 and 1/2 times the sauce with double the potatoes. I could've just doubled the sauce but wanted to be sure. I also used medium sized potatoes. The slow cooker worked great. I set it on low for 4 hours and they were fine but could've cooked a little longer. Will definitely make again!

Love this recipe...I did dice my onions and sautéed with some a minced clove of garlic. I cooked it in the crockpot on low. I doubled the recipe and had a ton of left overs so I turned it into ham and potato soup that was amazing. Making the recipe again as we speak.

I omitted the onions and used four very large potatoes and perhaps that's why there wasn't enough sauce but i ended up adding more milk, 1/2 -1 c milk to the layered potatoes, cheese, and sauce (alternating).  Be sure to season potatoes well before, there wasnt enough salt from 1/2 tsp added to sauce and cheese. Sauce was very thick but with added milk it seemed ok.  Sauce bubbled a lot when i took it out of oven and thickened as it stood.  I added 2 c cheese, swiss and cheddar but maybe one or other would be better.  I made it in a ceramic dish and the bottom was almost burned at 1 h 20 so maybe a lower temp for longer would prevent that.  Also, removed foil last 20 mins to brown top.

Was absolutely delicious.  Added more cheese and mixed the triple cheddar cheese with the colby/Monterey jack cheese and added more onion...liked the flavor and texture of the onion and it was great.  My family couldn't get enough!

Really good and super easy to make.  I've made this several times and it never disappoints.  The only thing I did differently was chop the onions rather than slice into rings.

I have made  this numerous times.  I've made a couple of slight changes.  I like onions, so  I chop the onions and make one layer.  I also layer the potatoes and sauce as I assemble it.  I've found that it works better that way.  It's turned out great each time.

Overall very good with a few changes we loved it.  Used 1/2 2% Milk & 1/2 Heavy cream.  Added diced onions (I'm sure the rings would not go over well with the teens).  Also added crunchy dried onions with panko crumbs mixed with melted butter for the top.  I also diced the potatoes rather than slicing.  Everyone ate it up, this is a keeper for holiday meals.

This turned out delicious.  I made a few minor modifications.  First, I chopped the onion and sautéed it slowly.  I added a little bit of ground nutmeg and a little bit of dried rosemary to the sauce.  I put the potato slices in the microwave for a few minutes before adding the onion and sauce to make sure they would be cooked through.  Thanks for the recipe. I will make it again soon.

This was a huge hit with my family on Christmas Day as a side to the smoked pork we served.  I doubled the recipe and it worked very well, I just had to cook for a bit longer than the recipe called for.  I took the tips of others and diced the onion, added some salt and pepper on the potato layers, and used fresh grated, organic cheddar cheese.  We will make this again and again, I'm sure!  And the little that was left over tasted extra good reheated!

This was just simply excellent. My brother-in-law, who is a modest eater, had generous seconds, as did nearly everyone present. I have tried au gratin and scalloped potato recipes twice before and neither was too impressive so it's been a long while since I even tried. So glad I did.

I read a few reviews and this is what I did. 1) increased the sauce by half again as much but did not end up needing or using the extra (as-written is just right). 2) added a crush crouton/breadcrumb topping in the last 5 minutes (yummy). 3) used half the amount of onion and chopped it up. 4) added some dried thyme to the cheese sauce. 5) used medium cheddar and about one more cup of it, spread in the layers.

I will definitely make again and aside from sticking with the standard amount sauce, I will do the exact same thing next time.

I followed the directions but, I completely forgot the onions last minute. Today, was just too chaotic. My picky teenage son liked this so, I will definitely make it again. Without the onions it was still very good. Thank you for sharing.

Made this two Christmases in a row because it's just that good the only change I made was I used a mandolin to slice my potatoes thinner than recommended to cut down on cooking time and added dry thyme to milk cheese mixture took under an hour to cook my way. I'll give it a five star review because I made according to recipe last time and it was just as good. I call them my Christmas  potatoes. My husband and family love them

Cooked at 400 degrees F for three hours and the potatoes were still hard as a rock.  Followed the directions to the letter.  Nothing like Christmas dinner with rock hard potatoes.  Had to microwave the casserole for 25 minutes to get the potatoes to a point to eat but had little flavor.

Delicious!  Increased the cheese sauce by half, sliced the peeled potatoes to 1/8 inch slices, left out the onions, made it in a dutch oven.

Tweaked the recipe based on other reviews.  Followed  the measurements. but used a mixture of heavy cream and milk--equal parts. On the cheese used  one cup of guyere and half cup of cheddar.  Used a OXO mandolin for potatoes and onions on the 2 setting. Also, used a clove of garlic to season the bowl post butter.  Key thing is I cooked 6 small russet potatoes in an oven at 350 for an hour and then put in the frig for 5 hours prior to assembling.  I was cooking a Prime Rib 5 and half pounds, I put in the potatoes at 350 and cooked for 2 hours.  I did remove aluminum foil for the last 30 minutes.  Awesome.

Some minor tweaks: 1. Used mandolin on onions to get them really thin. 2. Need to season every layer. I think the past comments noted the recipe was a bit bland. It doesn't call for enough salt so the bottom layers turn out under seasoned. 3. Spray dish with cooking spray or grease so the bottom layer doesn't stick. 4. Leave out some cheese to top it. Then put under broiler until browned.

I diced the onions very fine, added 1/2 cup of extra shredded cheese, and made these in the crock pot. They do take about 8 hours in the crock pot unless you precook the potatoes a bit. I ended up cooking them on low for 5 hours and high for the last 3. They turned out very good, nice flavor and texture. Next time, I will try them in the oven just to see the difference. It was nice having the oven free to cook a ham and other smaller dishes.

A good basic recipe! I had some leftover sautéed mushrooms and onions which I mixed in instead of the raw onion rings. Also upped the cheese to 2 cups and used half sharp Cheddar and half a smoked Cheddar. You can definitely make this your own by using different cheese combinations.

I made it per the recipe.  Second time I added half-again-more to the ingredients to the sauce in order to make it cheesier/saucier.  Really thought that went well.  Recipe is a definite keeper

This was excellent and far better than the usual Scalloped Potatoes recipe.  I was unsure what size potatoes were used and mine were on the small size.  One reviewer suggested making more cheese sauce so I just used my 4 smallish potatoes and next time will add one more.  I also added ham and diced the potatoes rather than sliced.

I made this for a potluck gathering, so I doubled the recipe and substituted a tiny bit of onion powder for the onions. It was a hit! My husband has asked me to make it again very soon.

I thought this recipe was super easy to make, and very good. I  used a blend of swiss and gruyere cheeses. I thought this recipe needed a little more "savory" component. Maybe nutmeg or chives. I really liked the hint of sweetness the onions added, I thought it was a nice and unique touch.

I made exactly as written except I took the foil off for the last 30 minutes because we like the brown, crusty cheese. It was one of the best potato dishes I ever made. Thank you! Will be making this one again and again!

Threw in chunks of ham, served with fresh peas and thin slices of baguette (perfect for mopping up cheese sauce left from the potatoes!).  Everyone had seconds with no thoughts of leaving room for much loved peanut butter pie.  Terrific recipe to turn to for comfort food moods, looking forward to trying my own variations.

I served this last night with Easy Slow Cooker Ham and it was an excellent pairing.  I used part extra sharp cheddar and part smoked provolone, minced the onion rather than sliced and plenty of salt and pepper.  I removed the foil the last 30 min and topped with buttered bread crumbs and parmesan mixed half  each.  Very nice presentation.  Next time I would reduce the amount for flour in the sauce by 1/3 as we thought the sauce was a little too thick.

We loved it!  I have been searching for the perfect au gratin potato recipe, and this is it!  The proportions are all thought out ahead for you, so you don't have to "wing" it -- just go ahead and make the cheese sauce separately, already, and be done with it!  I made a couple of changes  -- added a couple squirts of prepared mustard and a couple grinds of red pepper -- to give it a little zing. SUPER GOOD!

This is a delicious recipe. I added a little more cheese and used soy milk instead of cow's milk. Turned out great. (Yes I know cheese is dairy--that's not why I didn't use regular milk)

It was the favorite at the Thanksgiving dinner! I just can not follow a recipe! I used a 10 oz block of cheese shredded in the proccesser (way more than 1 1/2 c shredded), added some dry minced onion before i found i had some, used the proccessor to slice the potatoes and used medium cheddar. Cooked on a high rack for 40 minutes then low for forty more cause it was taking so long.

Make this recipe all the time. I never liked Au Grain Potatoes until I made these for my dad. Now I love them as much as he does and cringe when someone suggests boxed ones. I use 1 cup milk & 1 cup Heavy Whipping Cream. I up the cheese to 2 cups and sprinkle Parmesan on top after they come out of the oven. Huge family favorite.

Needs more salt, more pepper and it's missing something to liven up the flavor, which I found fell a little flat. Maybe blending two cheeses together would help it a bit and definitely adding chives would kick it up. Feedback from guests was it was good, but I found the sauce much too thick. I'd definitely cut the base with more milk and use less flour for more of a creamy, light texture. Overall, not bad.

And straightforward to make. I did all the prep in advance and then did the baking at dinner time with the rest of the meal and it worked out perfectly!

I always make the recipe as written the first time. Like many others said, the onion flavor is way too much but the entire dish is pretty uninspired other than the onion overload.  I would leave out onions for sure and spice it up somehow.  Im still looking. and cooking time way WAY too long.  It would have been a crispy mess if cooked more than 60 minutes

This tasted like a knock off version of some freezer section mac and cheese.   What a waste of my time and ingredients…

This was amazing!! I would halve the onion and definitely dice it. I added about a cup more cheese and added more on top. Need a two quart dish for sure.

I am not the cook in my family, my husband is. I never learned how growing up as a child, and only now at 25 am I learning. I made this last night and found it pretty simple to follow. The only difference is that I used pepper jack cheese and added some parmesan and paprika on top per my husband's request. He gave it a 9/10.

The absolute best Au Gratin Potatoes I have ever had. I changed the recipe slightly by subtracting the onion and replacing with 4 slices of bacon chopped then cooked until just brown, not crisp. I also added one can of cream of potato soup to the cheese sauce. I pre soaked the potatoes for 4 hours in cold water with 3 tbsp of salt and then rinsed thoroughly before placing them in casserole dish. If you pre soak the potatoes, then do not use any salt for seasoning, you will get plenty of salt from the bacon and the pre soaked potatoes will retain some of the salt after rinsing.

My husband LOVES this recipe! I bake it without foil since it takes a long time to brown the top in our electric oven. I have a couple modifications: (1) slice the potatoes thin, around 1/8"; and (2) substitute dehydrated onion flakes on top of the first layer of sliced potatoes since hubby won't eat "real" onions"; (3) as is, the seasoning is a bit bland, but I always skimp on the salt and pepper till after it's baked anyways since its easier to add seasoning than take it out. We usually end up adding additional salt and pepper on our individual servings; (4) more cheese! I usually add about 1/2-1 cup extra in the sauce. Turns out great. This is our go-to cheesy potato recipe; leftovers don't last more than a day or two.

1- Minced onions and sautéed them before putting on potatoes
2-  put 1/3 of cheese sauce and some onions over bottom half of potatoes 
3-  covered with bread crumbs to make it crispy and added freshly grated Parmesan cheese over it. It melted into bread crumbs making a delicious topping.

OMG these are heavenly! I used about 8 med. red potatoes (that is what I had on hand) and doubled the cheese sauce. I omitted the onion (personal preference)  There was still a lot left over after our family was done.  I have reviewed a lot of 4 star recipes on this site but this is the first time i have rated anything 5 stars!

This was excellent but I just had to add a few things
Into the sauce a touch of Cayanne pepper and a little dry mustard .   Next time I'll cut back on the cheese (looked greasy) and use extra sharp cheese with a little med cheese mixed in for flavor maybe cut down on the butter too as it seemed like a lot!

I too turned the oven to 350 
Last 20 minutes uncovered @400

Loved this recipe! The only change I made was I finely chopped a half onion and mixed it in the cheese sauce in saucepan on stove. We have sensitive bellies in our house so too much onion sometimes isn't good! The whole family(including 2 kids) gave it a thumbs up!

Amazing!  I cut them much thinner and cooked at 415 for 90 mins and the still weren't done, but I let them sit in the oven for a while more and they were do e enough.  My husband and I both think these are fantastic!  Well worth the wait!

So I make the roux and microwave the milk to preheat it. Then when I ad it to the roux  and whisk it, I have no lumps. Its faster too. This recipe came out fantastic. I used golden potatoes, and sliced them on the slicing edge of a box grater.

I wasn't a fan of this recipe. It needs more seasoning and it wasn't creamy as I like it. The onions needs to be diced and cooked with the butter in order to get the tenderness.

This was a traditional au gratin potato recipe.  I skipped the onion, added some season salt for taste, sliced the potatoes 1/8 inch thick and only used 3 medium baking potatoes with skin on.  I used a round 2 1/2 qt glass casserole dish, and sprinkled 1/2 cup cheese on top. Covered and baked for 90 minutes but potatoes were not quite tender, so I left dish in the oven for another 30 minutes to finish baking. I thought it was very good.

I liked these.  For some reason they got really dark on the bottom, on this side of burned.  I didn't mind it much but they didn't have very good plate appeal.  I diced the onion instead of rings.  I put some sauce between the layers and I cooked uncovered for last 15 minutes.

Used about 6 medium potatoes and increased sauce by 1 and 1/2.  Chopped onions and added garlic powder.  Very good but quite a bit of work.

mmmmm... I added garlic powder also.....very good! Would also be good with ham for a complete meal...i especially loved the addition of the cream/cheese sauce- i added this about half way through - I added milk and cheese, along w/ the other ingredients, then added the cream/cheese sauce when it had about 40 minutes to go....delish!

Great recipe used everything but the onions because I didn't think it will mix well with the other ingredients. I used a 3 cheese blend and I the dish came out perfectly.

Wonderful!!! My family loved this dish. They all said this is a keeper. The only thing I did different was to leave out the onions and I sliced the potatoes thinner. Give this dish a try you will not be sorry.

This is almost exactly like I make my Au Gratin Potatoes and they are great.  Only difference is I chop the onions up and slice the potatoes thinner.  I alternate adding the potatoes, sauce and onions in the dish.  I also add a garlic clove only because I add garlic to everything!  And don't leave the onions out as another person said:  they do not "get in the way of the potato and cheese flavors".  Only leave them out if you don't like onion.  This is a great recipe!

I made this for a family gathering. It was amazing! I was only able to get about a spoonful. So I made it again the next day just for me. I will definitely continue to make this. I followed the recipe exact. Only difference is once it was done cooking I broiled the top and then before serving I topped with parmesan cheese and parsley. Amazing!

This is an excellent starting recipe. I had an idea of the dish I wanted before starting, which was less like scalloped potatoes and more like 'potatoes-smothered-in-cheese-sauce'. My changes included sautéing a small chopped onion in the butter before adding the flour then omitting the onion layered with the potatoes. I added half milk and half vegetable stock simply because I had stock in the fridge. After the sauce had thickened, I pureed it in the blender. Instead of cheddar, I used smoked Balderson cheese, once again, because it was open.

We could not believe how velvety, cheesy and smoky the finished au gratin was! Just delicious.

It was ok.  It was a little bland.  I added extra cheese and even bought old cheddar for more flavour.  I also cut the potatoes extra thin so I wouldn't have hard potatoes and they were still a little hard after 90 min.  Not sure if I will make it again.  Certainly not without changes.

This is the second time I have made this. The only thing I do differently is I remove the foil and top with a little more grated cheese  (to brown) during the last 15-30 minutes.

Awesome! Super cheesy and creamy! I used about 5 lbs. of potatoes and par cooked them the night before I made the dish for about 15 minutes (they were large potatoes). I sauteed a large onion and layered it in between the peeled and thinly sliced potatoes. I also layered the cheese sauce between the potatoes. I used 1 1/2 the ingredients for the cheese sauce and then doubled that for the large amount that I was baking. By increasing the recipe, I needed 6 cups of milk so I used 4 cups milk and 2 cups heavy cream & added a few sprinkles of nutmeg.  I used white cheddar that was high quality and a lot of extra of it! I covered it and refrigerated it till the next day when I baked it for 2 hours and maybe an extra 10 minutes or so until it was nice and brown on top. I also uncovered it the last hour or so.

Really yummy, and very easy to make! I did add a little extra cheese, because my hubby really likes things cheesy. I also diced the onions, and added some diced ham. Perfect for a main dish! Add a veggie and you've got a great casserole.

This was yummy. I followed the recommendation to mince the onion, and I'm really happy I did because the onions were soft and added great flavor. I'll definitely make this again.

Love this recipe.  I make a few changes to it to help it cook faster. First I slice my potatoes with a salad shooter using a slicing blade.  I also place the sliced potatoes in a microwave safe bowl, cover with plastic wrap, poke holes in it and microwave in batches at about 6 min stopping it about every 2 to stir them. Continuing just until they are starting to get soft. While I'm microwaving the sliced potatoes I soften my (diced) onions in a sauce pan with a little bit of oil. When they are soft I add my butter and flour to the onions and make my rue (spelling? )  and then cook the flour for a min or so then slowly adding my milk seasonings and when sauce is thickened the cheese. This ensures that your sauce is not clumpy. I then add the sauce to the potatoes that are softened, stir together and add to casserole dish.  I top with cheese and only need to bake about 45-60 min checking about every 15 after the first half hour. Hope this helps save others some baking time!

This was delicious I doubled the recipe (except the onion stuck to just one, for flavor), added left over sliced ham. For the milk I did half milk and half heavy cream turned out sooo good the family loved it :)

I have made this recipe 3 times  .. first 2 time exactly as written except for mincing the onions ( to hide them from some of my family that do not like onions) and it was delicious ! This last time I had a Smithfield (the only brand to buy) ham steak in the frig and was feeling a bit lazy about what to do for dinner so I decided to cube it and include it by layering it along with the potatoes and onions.  I also crushed a clove of garlic into the rue.  OMGosh ... DELICIOUS ! Everyone loved it !

I did as another reviewer suggested and chopped the onions. Also, I added a tad more cheese to the mixture and cooked it for an extra 20 minutes. It turned out great!

I did not add onions as I wanted the cheese and potato to really come through. I used a store brand cheese regular and medium cheddar. Next time I will use a better grade of cheese....it does make a difference. Will definitely make again, thanks for the recipe.

Very good. I didn't put in the onions, and I added cheddar on top and some parmesan. The parmesan really kicked up the taste, I will use that instead of cheddar next time.

I made the following changes: 
I used Yukon Gold potatoes;  
While I made the sauce, I microwaved the layered potatoes  and onions on high  (3 minutes) to give it a head start; 
I baked on convection roast for 45 minutes (uncovered for the last 10);
 and I used Gruyere cheese.  
You could see the onions between the layers of cheese, but they melted in your mouth when you ate them.  This is the best au gratin potatoes I have ever made.  I can't figure out why other reviewers felt they needed to chop them up or  saute them ahead of time.
My husband and I absolutely loved it.

Great! I made the cheese sauce ahead of time and reheated it when I was assembling it. This is a little bit more work than the box stuff but SO much better.

This recipe is fantastic. This was the first time I made au gratin potatoes and they didn't disappoint. I made some changes suggested like sautéing the onions with garlic. I also used 1/2 cup of whipping cream and 1-1/2 cup milk. I had 2 servings left over and I served them with eggs the next morning...delish! I will definitely make these again.

The first time it turned out absolutely brilliant, the second time - it was too runny and the cheese was curdled a bit.  

What was the difference? The white sauce. Make sure when you mix the flour and butter together, you have a fairly thick roux. The first time, I added a bit of extra flour to accomplish this - the second time, I followed the recipe exactly.  I added the milk and stirred and stirred - but the white sauce never got as thick as it should, and then couldn't hold the cheese together once it was baking in the oven.

I'll be making this again - with minced onions and keeping an eye on the consistency of the flour and butter mixture - because it's a great basic recipe for au gratin potatoes.

Dinner party loved it.  Doubled recipe except for milk & roux (4tbsp).  Plus sprinkled some cheese then panko on top.

Good overall, but a bit bland...I agree with other reviewers that I would omit the onions as they do take away from the lovely marriage of potatoes and cheese.  I used an extra sharp cheddar and grated it myself instead of using pre-grated cheddar.  There was quite a bit of butter floating on top and I used the amount stated in the recipe...maybe due to fact I didn't use bread crumb topping as I do in my own recipe...or maybe it was the yellow potatoes I used instead of russets...at any rate, I don't think I'll use this recipe again.

Love this recipe. The only thing that I do differently is saute the onion first and it really adds a nice flavor to the dish. Super easy to make and very crowd pleasing.

I chopped and sautéed the onions with one clove of garlic in olive oil first, then added this to my cheese sauce after sauce was done on stove top.  I peeled, and sliced the potatoes, and boiled them to heat them through to reduce time in oven.  I put half the potatoes in my bake pan and then put a layer of BLEU CHEESE CRUMBLES (4 OUNCES)over the layer of potatoes, then put the other half of potatoes on top with more cheese sauce to cover. It took about an hour in the oven.   DELICIOUS.

One of my husband's favorite dishes. Made just a few changes though. I used red potatoes instead of Russet and made the layers thinner so that the potatoes were not stacked on each other but on the onions in between. Also used 2 onions (I like onions) and made several layers of that too. Very yummy. I do add more salt and pepper to my portion as my husband is not a big salt fan and our little is not a big pepper fan and I love both. Thanks so much for this awesomeness!

It was excellent, but does need a few slight "tweaks". I made this exactly as written, and maybe it's because I live near Idaho and we get HUGE russets, but I could barely use 3 in a 2 qt. casserole dish. We like the crispy parts the best, so next time I'll use an even larger dish for more surface area. Also, adding bread crumbs and extra shredded sharp cheddar is a must, both for texture and design.

Followed many suggestions such as greasing pan and foil thoroughly, chopping onions and removing foil last 20 minutes for browning. Made 1.5 portion  (6 potatoes) of recipe and it fit well in a 9x13 pan. Used half and half and sharp cheddar and it turned out rich, creamy and tasty. Easy clean up. Will definitely make again!

This is in the oven now.  If the sauce is any indicator it's incredible.  I used 1/3 sharp cheddar, 1/3 Monterey jack and 1/3 Amish Swiss (what I had) and added a few finely chopped sprigs of fresh Rosemary.

Added ham for a meal and rough chopped and caramelized  the onion in the butter before adding the flour and then the milk and cheese. Delish!
I use yukon gold or red potatoes. They only need one hour.

This is a wonderful recipe and I make it all the time! I use 1 cup of Asiago cheese and 1 cup of sharp cheddar for a stronger flavor. I also add 1 T Worcestershire sauce and 1 tsp prepared mustard. I mince the onions, too. I do not cover it as my husband likes the crispy parts on top!

One word!!!!!! "AMAZING" I changed the recipie a little by adding chopped green onion instead of white, and pepper jack cheese instead of cheddar! Yummy! It was a hit in my household. I'm happy at how easy the dish was to prepare too!!! :)

Made a double batch today….and my teenage boys inhaled it….barely rescued some for my hubby to have for his lunch tomorrow.    I did make a couple of the changes that previous reviewers mentioned….chopped and cooked the onions in butter with two pressed garlic cloves.   I didn't double the cheese, because I wanted more of a creamy white sauce flavor.   Partially cooked it in the microwave (to speed things up) and then put it in the oven to finish.   Definitely will make this again!   Thanks for posting it!

Very good. Made without the onion though. My husband seriously dislikes onions! Will definitely make again. The 2 hour prep and cook time is not very weeknight friendly though. And there is no way that 4 russet potatoes fit in a 1 quart dish! I used  a 2.2 quart dish and the juices still bubbled over.

CREAMY GOODNESS!  This was so easy to put together that once I watched the video, I didn't need to read the recipe.  I did use red potatoes and Velveeta cheese as that is what I had available.  I served it as a side dish with Baked Teriyaki Chicken from this site.  This is a recipe that I will be making again.  Thank you Cathy M for sharing!

This recipe is great as is!  I love the onion and find if I cut them in similar round shapes like the potatoes, but cut the onion half as thick as potatoes, that works best. I also mix it together in a big bowl before cooking, and mix it once during cooking to get the perfect cooking technique for this dish.

The sauce was so tasteless.  Tried much more salt and pepper, garlic powder AND chopped garlic and as a last resort, added a cup or more of chicken broth.  Nothing helped -- absolutely tasteless.

This was amazing! I doubled the recipe using a bigger pan and chopped the onion. I sprinkled some garlic powder and onion powder over the potatoes, sooo yummy!!!

Delicious...I made two different versions for Easter- this recipe and another on this site.  This one was simpler and much better.  Keeping this recipe.

Easy enough for me to make my own, rather than using a packaged instant. I did layered cheese between each layer of potatoes as other reviewers recommended. But other than that, followed the recipe. Very good. Potatoes were very soft and cheesy. If I want to go with more traditional way, I would omit onion. A plain Au Gratin Potatoes without onion should work just fine in my opinion. Try the cheese sauce with sliced bread, it's so good :)

Have made as listed and it was delish. Had to use bacon the second time 'cause I was out of butter; just crisped up 3 pieces of bacon in a skillet, removed pieces, and used the remaining bacon grease in place of butter. Superb!

This is a very good recipe as is, and an excellent one when tweaked a little. The technique of making the roux and cooking the sauce seems to be the key to a smooth and creamy result. As others have said, it's better with a little more sauce. I added an extra cup of half and half and a little extra cheese. Skip the onion. Try a combination of Gruyere and sharp cheddar. Cook sauce on low til nice and smooth. Add to potatoes in layers so all potatoes are fully covered with sauce. Mine cooked a bit quicker than 90 minutes and the cheese began to brown on the glass bottom (maybe the Gruyere?), so keep and eye on it after an hour.  As an added kick, although not really necessary, I added some crumbled crispy bacon to the layers.  These were the best au gratin potatoes I have ever made.

This was quite good - but another deviation! I sautéed the onions (diced) in the butter and then added the flour, cheese, etc. Also, I diced up leftover Easter ham and put that between the layers of potatoes. Served with green beans and a white wine --very good! Using another cheese along with cheddar would be a great addition - maybe pepperjack! Will make GREAT leftovers!

Great template recipe for potatoes au gratin. I used sharp cheddar cheese, added 1 T yellow mustard to the cheese sauce, used sauteed red onion, and topped with a sleeve of crushed Ritz crackers. It was really, really good. My SIL swaps out some of the potatoes for sliced mushrooms or bell peppers and just increases the baking time a little to account for extra moisture (just peak under the foil after 90 minutes to see if it looks too liquidy in the middle). I made this fully and then refrigerated it for a day and reheated for 45 minutes at 350--it was perfect.

Excellent!  Perfect as is.  I chopped the onion simply because I don't like sliced in my potatoes.  I also topped with buttered bread crumbs as someone suggested.  Outstanding, easy and I will make again and again.  Thank you, Cathy M!

Because I wanted a spicy version of this I made some changes.  after reading all the reviews I sauteed the onions which I chopped. I also sliced the potatoes fairly thin less than 1/4"  and par-cooked them...Brought them just about to a boil and then drained. Before I heated the milk to make the roux, I tossed in two jalepenos (seeded them) Just before the milk boiled. I put aside and let the jalepenos infuse. I used cornstarch instead of flour to thicken and added another 1/2 of cheese. I can't imagine the potatoes being cooked enough without cooking them part of the way. at 1 1/2 hours (with par-cooked potatoes) it was just right.

It came out rather bland and a little much liquid for my tastes. I will adjust and give it another go, for it's a good base, but I had a lot of cheese sauce slopping round the potatoes.

I quadrupled the potatoes, and tripled the sauce to go with our Easter ham. Our company raved about the potatoes more than any other part of the meal! I will make these potatoes every time with ham. I did put the onions in the microwave with a little water for 2 minutes and baked them a little longer in a 12x13 glass pan, but I didn't make any other changes. This recipe is excellent. The photo is upside down.

Very yummy! People raved about it. Be very generous with the amount of salt and pepper, and probably a good idea to mix all of the potatoes and cheese mixture first, and then add it to the pan. I cooked for the last 20 minutes with the foil off.

Great basic recipe......everyone will have their little twist on it due to taste preferences.  I used red bliss potatoes and did not peel them.  Also used scallions instead of onions and Gruyere and a blend of cheddar cheeses.  Since I made this to go with my Easter ham I used CREAM instead of milk and a hefty dose of pepper, flat leaf parsley and one of my favorite herbs Summer Savory.  It was delicious

I've made this many times, sometimes with half sweet potatoes, always sauteing the onion first.  This last time I used shallots, which were very nice.  I also used spelt flour, which took longer to thicken but worked just fine.

12/14: christmas dinner.  great with ham.  i doubled the recipe for 5 lb bag of russet pototoes.  left out onions.   took a long time to bake and bubbled over, so put a baking sheet underneath.  much better than mashed potatoes. also no gravy needed, just different types of mustard.  also, take cover off the last 20 minutes to brown, needs extra pepper and salt.

I ran out of salt and had no onions, so I sprinkled about 1/2 onion soup/dip packet over first and second layer.  Just enough to lightly dust but cover all potatoes.  Added a bit of garlic salt on top layer along with pepper.  I also used Hawaiian salt in the sauce with 2 cups of cheese.  It turned out delicious.

I have made this recipe two times as written with good results. The potatoes really absorb the cheese sauce, so your potatoes may come out drier than you want. When I make this recipe again, I will double the cheese sauce as other reviewers have suggested and see if that helps.

I found the overall taste too bland the last time I made this. This time I changed it up. 1 cup milk ,1- 1/2 cups 10% cream. I heated the milk/cream alone and added 2 whole garlic cloves, 1 tsp sage, 1 tsp thyme and let it warm up gently for about 20 mins then strained the herbs out and let it cool. I used the onions but caramelized them ahead of time. when layering the potato/cheese sauce I added some jalapeno Havarti and about a tbsp parmesan on each layer. Amazing!

I made it with two cups of cheddar, left out the onions and sliced the potatoes with my mandolin slicer. Perfect! I also broiled it for 3-4 mins on high at the end to get a crispy topping. Excellent!

This was really good. I didn't use onions, as the family and I are not fans, but I did use garlic. I very gently cooked the garlic in the roux until it was a light golden color. The potatoes turned out great, and everyone helped themselves to seconds (sometimes thirds). Will make again.

I loved this recipe! I've made this dish with many different recipes but this one was by far the best. To speed up the cooking time, After I cut up the potatoes I cooked them in the microwave for 3 minutes. I also added GARLIC!!! Boyfriend was impressed ??

Used everything but the onions. I also used a cheese grater slicer to cut my potatoes evenly since I read reviews that the thickness and consistency threw off the cooking time. This made about 4-5 layers of potatoes and cheese. My husband couldn't stop eating it and almost half of it was gone before he say down to eat dinner. It was a bit greasy because of the amount of cheese (I'm sure I used more than the recipe called for) but it was worth it (plus with baked chicken...it evens out, right) :)

My husband and I are in love with this recipe. I tweaked it only to add a bit of pepper and garlic powder in the onion layer, and I left out the salt, and it was absolutely amazing. It's his new favourite dish and he asks for it all the time!

This was really fantastic. I chopped up the onions very finely in order to hide them from my kids instead of using rings. I did use tons more pepper, but we are a peppery family.

I dished it all out to the 4 of us, and my husband immediately asked if there were more, just based on the delicious baked cheesy smell. This will be in the regular rotation for sure. Eventually I'll try to make it healthier but not right now. :)

I make this with Velveeta Shreds - the entire 2 cup package, and we can't get enough!  I also take the aluminum foil off for the last 15-20 minutes because we like it browned.

Wow! This came out truly amazing! I added all the ingredients to pork chops that had already been cooking in the oven. I took the previous suggestions of cutting up the onion, putting the cheese sauce between potato layers, and adding one more cup of that oh-so-yummy cheddar cheese. My tummy is so happy! Thank you for this recipe!!!!

These potatoes were fantastic!  My family loved them.  Unfortunately I cut my finger on the last potato slice on the mandolin slicer and had to go to urgent care.  I have a food processor that I have never used and will see if it has a slice function so that I can get rid of my hand-held slicer and keep myself safe the next time I make these :)

Keep coming back to this wonderfully easy recipe. I omit the onions and add about an extra cup of cheese and use a 2qt baking dish. Easy no fail recipe!!!

Whole family enjoyed it.  

To save time, I used pre-sliced potatoes from market and steamed them for a few min in microwave while preparing sauce.  Added some cream and sour cream to sauce (I was low on milk).   For those who want it less bland- I also added Italian herb seasoning to potatoes, and a pinch of sage and dash of nutmeg to the sauce when adding the milk.  Yum...   

Don't forget to grease the casserole dish like I did :-/.   Baked uncovered for the last 20 min as others suggested.

This was great! I did play with the ingredients a bit.  I used red potatoes, minced red onion and added 2 tbsp minced garlic to saute in the butter,completely omitted the raw onion, used almost a lb of 2 year white cheddar and about half a lb of smokey sharp cheddar. this recipe definitely needs more cheese than the original calls for.  Add bread crumbs at the end and boom you've got yourself a recipe you'll use over and over.  This was a huge hit for my boyfriend and friends.

Easy and delicious.  I omitted the onion and layered in crumbled bacon instead (4 strips cooked thick cut, crumbled).  Topped with another 1/2 cup shredded cheese, crumbled bacon and chives.  Baked uncovered.

I followed the directions exactly, but thought they were a little bland.  Next time I would definitely add more cheese.   I would also like to read through some of the suggestions in other reviews.

I used this recipe as a guide for how much of each ingredient to use. I didn't have milk, so I replaced the whole white flour sauce process with a 16 ounce jar of store-bought alfredo sauce. Heated it up, added the cheese, then prepared as directed. It turned out really rich and wonderful!

Made a single potato in a 1.5 cup baking dish.  Two servings, easily.  I had trouble scaling the roux, but it worked out in the end.  Following JMGINGRICH, I nuked the potato for 2 mins before assembling.  Baked 30 min, uncovered: perfect.  A bit bland, could have stood some serious garlic and hot sauce; those were added at table. :)

Very scrummy indeed! I just added more cheese and added double cream and a pinch of dried rosemary and nutmeg. Then the last 15 minutes I removed the foil, and added breadcrumbs and parmesancrumbs. Absolutely Heavenly.

I made these for Easter this year, and when they came out of the oven they were beautiful, however, I then had to cook the ham, after I cooked the ham, I was going to 're warm these right before dinner, when that time came I looked at them and the beautifully golden potatoes were pale a weary looking. They tasted wonderful! Just be prepared to serve them right out of the oven!

The only changes I made were to add more cheese and less onions.  I would have preferred more cheesy sauce, so next time will make a bit more and I only used two russet potatoes, but they were the baking ones, so they were really big.  Otherwise, a really good & solid recipe.

I made this using the exact ingredients as listed in the recipe.  The only things I did differently were (1) chopped sweet Vidalia onions in the food processer and sprinkled on each layer of potatoes; (2) parboiled the potatoes in the microwave for 10 minutes before assembling casserole; and (3) added about 1/4 tsp of garlic powder, 1/4 tsp of onion powder to cheese sauce.  I've made it twice this week, doubling the recipe each time.  My husband thinks it's the bomb, his absolute favorite new dish!!

I had some potatoes left and was wanting to use them up, but I didn't want to do the usual mashed or baked potatoes. I decided "hey I've never made au gratin potatoes before so I did an Internet search and this recipe popped up. I figured what the hell if it tasted bad I wasn't out anything but a few about to expire spuds. It was PHENOMENAL!!! Like previous raters I will never make boxed au gratin again! The only thing I did differently was I used Morton's season all instead of regular salt, diced the onions and cooed it at a lower temp for longer because I was making it with a meatloaf. I also took the foil of for the last 45 minutes to get some of the cheese to burn. If cooked at 400 degrees that may not be needed.

I really enjoyed this recipe! I didn't have an hour and a half to bake them so I boiled the potatoes for about 10-15 minutes before I sliced them, then changed the bake time to 45 minutes. But the rest of the recipe I followed exactly. They came out perfect!

followed recipe exact, except I sliced potatoes slightly thinner then 1/4".  These were a big hit in our family.  Very tasty! I didn't think that the sauce would work its way down all the layers of potato and the onion...but it did.

This was very good. However next time I will omit the onions, since we don't particularly like them in this dish. I also plan on playing a bit with the seasonings, since it was a little bland. But overall it was really good and great as a side dish

Delicious!  Recipe as written serves at least 6.  Not complaining though because the leftovers are excellent.  I had to move to a bigger casserole dish.  I made it exactly as directed.  Only suggestion would be to salt and pepper generously and perhaps uncover for the last 15 minutes.  Also let stand for at least 10 minutes before serving.  My guests loved this recipe and I will make it again.  Doubled it would be a great addition to a potluck at church!

I made this recipe yesterday for the first time for Easter dinner.  It was absolutely delicious and everyone raved about them. I doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan and it fix exactly. I will definitely make this again. I made no alterations except for doubling the recipe.

Amazing dish!! Just made it last night for an Easter supper and it was devoured! :)  I doubled the sauce for the potatoes and added extra cheese it came out just perfect in a 9x13 pan.

These are excellent.  I agree with some the onion rings seem a little big.  So maybe chopped instead?  I took the foil off for the last 15 minutes so it browned on the top. Yum!

I make these all the time and they are the absolute. Best! I boil the potato slices for a minute so the cooking time is reduced to 45 minutes and they are done all the way.

Delicious.  I ran out of cheddar cheese, so I used a parmesan-mozzarella mix for part of the cheese mix and they still tasted great!  I also used part onion and part onion powder, and added some garlic and garlic powder and pepper.  My family usually has boxed potatoes for holidays and these tasted much, much better.

Good but needs more salt. I made this from my aunts birthday (gave you credit) and it turned out good. I added more salt. But I'm playing with it a bit for Easter different cheese and some more protein.

This was good.  I did saute the onions before adding, and then made two layers of potatoes, onion, cheese sauce.  Since I had it in the oven with a ham, I baked it for two hours at 325 degrees.  My family liked it, even two who told me they didn't like au gratin potatoes!

Very nice side dish, I made it exactly as stated except I cut the onion slices in quarters to get better coverage. I had it as a side with pork chops, and it was both filling and a very tasty side dish. I will make this again for sure. It was very easy to put together in about 30 min.

These tasted SO GOOD! My sister and I love our cheesy potatoes (which is what we call these). Most people make them as a side but we eat so much of it we consider it a meal within itself. The first time I made these I tripled the recipes and made a big batch of them. They turned out SO good. My husband and I couldn't stop eating them. Made exactly as is and perfect!

Did not have my usual recipe with me while visiting my daughter. I found this and it was a hit! I needed to  put a ham in so I cooked the potatoes at 400 for 45 minutes, then lowered to 350 and cooked another hour and 45 minutes as the ham cooked. I also sprinkled with bread crumbs and more cheese on top. Yum!

As with most recipes I always follow exactly as written the first time then tweak to my personal taste after that. As is, we didn't care for the large rings of onions and the onion taste was a little strong. The next time I made it, I left out the onion completely and added cooked, chopped bacon instead. Also added more cheese to the sauce. The family loves it with the bacon!

Like others, I used this as a jumping off point. Sliced and boiled 3 potatoes 'til tender; sliced and sautéed one onion.  Cut the cheese sauce recipe in half, and since DH is gluten intolerant, I subbed cornstarch for flour in the cheese sauce (note: use half as much cornstarch as flour or you'll have cheese-flavoured spackling compound!). Layered potatoes / onions / potatoes, and poured the sauce over. Baked at 350' for 30 minutes late in the afternoon so the toaster oven in my summer kitchen was free for baked chicken (which takes an hour and fifteen minutes itself, so many thanks to Katie K. for the par-boiling time-saving tip!). This would make a brilliant breakfast casserole with sliced mushrooms and crumbled sausage!

My family loves this recipe. It is one of those that the left overs actually get eaten. Never sits in the fridge long. I did find it to be a little bland so I added 2 teaspoons of chicken base to the milk. It really made the flavor pop.

pretty good.  I used a mandolin to cut the potatoes and took the time to nicely line them up in the pan.  Not all that necessary since its hidden under the sauce.  I should've used a smaller pan or watched it closer because the bottom layer got very dark and crispy (not in a good way).  I'll omit or finely mince the onions next time because although I like them, I hate watching people pick them out of their dinner.  I used 3 kinds of cheese - provolone, cheddar and mozzarella, just because its what I had on hand.  Will make again.

The potatoes turned out great, the only thing I had to do was put them in the microwave to get the potatoes to soften more after being in the oven for 90 minutes. 
I paired them with meat loaf and it was a wonderful dinner.

I made this dish as part of our Christmas dinner. While it wasn't a complete disaster, I must have done something wrong. After removing the potatoes from the oven it seemed most of the cheese sauce was just floating on top of the potatoes. It also appeared rather curdled instead of creamy. No less, it tasted ok, and even better the following day when warmed up in the microwave. I will try another recipe next time.

This is a great recipe.  I find it takes too long to cook so I put it all together and then microwave it for 15 mins before finishing it off in the oven.

We really liked this recipe.  I only rated it 4 stars because like other reviews I did not like the onion slices in the center.  The next time that I made it I thinly minced about 1/2 of a large onion and mixed throughout with the potatoes, and added a cracker crumb topping to the dish before I baked it.  The mix was just 3/4 cup crushed Ritz crackers with 3Tb melted butter.  For the last 15 minutes I removed the foil to brown the topping.  This is an easy and great side dish with any meal.  Thanks Cathy !!!

I just made this to go with roast chicken and sautéed Swiss chard.  I made some changes based on tips from others.  Used 3 Yukon gold, 2 cups shredded cheddar (needed more cheese), and I sautéed the onions before adding.  Used a bigger 1.5 quart pan and covered with foil that I sprayed with Pam (great tip, btw!).  It is in the oven now and smells great.  Will take foil off 15 minutes early to brown the top.  I expect it will be great.

So yummy! I doubled the cheese sauce and used diced shallots instead of onion. After, I sprinkled Panko on top and cooked uncovered for an extra 10 minutes.

Update:  After my initial review I reread the recipe and realized I'd changed the ingredients per the reviews.  NOT the recipes fault that it didn't turn out as expected.  Since then I watched the video & will try it again using regular yellow cheddar.  We might like that better.  Plus I used 1 1/2 recipe of the sauce.  Probably because someone said it didn't have enough sauce.  The reheated leftovers tasted better than the day I made the dish but I still want to prepare according to the directions given.  I'm sure that will elevate it to 5 stars.

These potatoes are always a hit; really a nice comfort food.  I found that I can really cut back on the cooking time by microwaving at 60% power until the sauce starts to boil, then finish in the oven.  They'll look and taste the same including the browned crust but in much less time.

This had a great taste and my hubby loved these. However, I went the way of the crockpot - because the oven was completely full - and the crockpot required several more hours of cooking than what I planned. All together I think they cooked 6 hours on high. If you are cooking these in the crockpot - be sure to allow enough time, so your meal can be ready on time!

Made this for Christmas and it was a big hit!  As someone else suggested, I omitted the onion and made extra sauce with more cheese than the recipe.  Yum!  No one missed the Mac and cheese that we traditionally prepare.

This was generally good.  The underlying taste was nice.  However, it needed a little salt.  I was concerned about adding in salt because some cheeses tend to make some dishes too salty.  Also, the recipe does not call for any salt.  So I decided not to add any.  Big mistake.  I think I will try this again but with some salt, and I think I can give it a 4-star rating or higher.

The only reason I am giving this a 4 star rating is because of the difficultly, time and mess it takes. Is it worth it it, YES. One other review said homemade, comfort and I agree. Nothing too fancy but just right. I did tweak this quite a bit. I boiled my sliced potatoes in salted/seasoned to tastet water for about 5 minutes to absorb the seasoning. I also minced onions and sautéed them in the butter until translucent then added flour etc. the rest was the same. I also took cathyM advise and used 3 different cheeses only because that is what I had on hand. 2 cups mix of cheddar and 2nd cup of Mexican blend cheese. I also topped with French fried onion. Only had to cook for 1 hr. You may want to cover if you don't want French fried onions to burn. Perfect! Will do this again.

Very good and easy recipe.  I sliced the potatoes very thin and it took over 1 1/2 hours so I think I'll try microwaving for 10 minutes or so before baking.  I will be cooking this again!

Easy & very good!! Husband loved it. Changes I made-  minced onion & sprinkle between layers- added 2 Tyme stems & 1 minced garlic clove  to cheese sauce  while simmering, let steep a bit. Adds great flavor.  Remove stems before adding sauce to potatoes .- added bread crumbs & uncovered it  last 20 min. Set casserole dish on cookie sheet to catch any drippings. I'll be making this again for  Christmas dinner!!

I tripled the recipe for 10 people and it was wonderful! I used russet potatoes, but will try Yukon next time.  I used less onion, but added a layer of chopped up arugula in the middle and bacon pieces in the middle and on top.  You can't go wrong, it was cheesy and delicious.

This was delicious.   I even used almond milk instead of regular milk and it turned out very creamy.  Also used more pepper than salt and low fat cheese.  Added more cheese at last 10 mins  and removed tin foil.  It made a nice crust   This will be on the menu for my Christmas dinner this year. Will go very well with ham

These are awesome.  Make a lot and I froze what we didn't eat and have reheated for other meals.  Will plan on making again for Christmas dinner.  Highly recommend.

This dish was alright I made extra sauce as recommended and used extra cheese on top of that.  I also added granulated garlic and parsley to help season.  On top of all that, they were still on the bland side.  My husband usually raves about my cooking but said "umm...they were alright", which means yuck.  I took them to a dinner, and noticed hardly anyone took any because even with all the cheese in the sauce, they still looked like potatoes in alfredo sauce.  They were just alright.

Really, really tasty. I doubled the cheese sauce part and diced the onions. I also did several layers in the pan, switching between potatoes, onions and cheese sauce.

Just made this for the first time.

Changes I made:
• Doubled the amount of cheese sauce - Though I think 1.5 times would have been plenty...twice as much was probably a little excessive.
• Used about 1/4 tsp of minced garlic in the cheese sauce. Sautéed it with the butter before adding the flour.
• Used half the salt it called for.
• Used about 1/3 more cheese than the recipe called for (so an extra half cup for the single cheese sauce recipe). Used sharp cheese.
• No onion (though I'm sure that would have been tasty if diced).
• Boiled the potatoes after slicing them while I was making the cheese sauce to cut down on cooking time. Also sliced them a bit thinner than called for in the recipe. The potatoes were fully cooked by the time I finished the cheese sauce. So we only baked it for like 15 min to basically let everything mix together a bit.
• Sprinkled some bread crumbs on top.
• Didn't cover with foil since we were cooking it for such a short time.
• Don't know what a 1 quart casserole dish size is...but I used my 9 x 13 glass dish.

I also think this would make an AWESOME casserole with some diced ham and peas. Might try that next time.

Not bad. Tasted better than the usual "boxed" scalloped potatoes. I did layer the potatoes and added more cheese. Baked at recommended time, but I thought the potatoes were not quite done. Some parts were, some parts won't.

Good basic recipe although I agree with previous reviews, the potatoes should be layered with sauce. I also prefer to eliminate onions altogether or grate a small amount into the sauce. Great using yellow cheddar or a combo of white cheddar and gruyere. As with any dish, it can only get better with the addition of fresh herbs, I like thyme.

This recipe is great. I do a few things a little bit differently.  I dice the onions and add them to the saucepan after making the rue. Once they start to turn clear, I add the milk.  I also use a half cup of extra cheddar cheese and about 2 ounces of grated Parmesan.  Absolutely delicious. Also agree with others that you should double the sauce recipe.

This was a great starting point to which I added bread crumbs for a top layer and substituted 2c of milk for cream.  Felt that it could have used more flavor, but I might not have used enough salt.  Next time I will cut the potatoes thinner than 1/4", and add pan toasted shallots, or crumbled bacon on top.

This was very yummy, but I really thought I'd miss the crunchy top of bread crumbs, so I crumbled up some buttery crackers and sprinkled on top for the last 20 minutes. It was really good!  Also, next time I would add a little more salt.

This is a good base recipe. I'm not a fan of onions, so I omit them. Also, in reading other recipes, I came across a short cut as 1 1/2 hours of cooking time is just too long for me. I par-cook the sliced potatoes in boiling salted water for 3-4 minutes, drain them, then layer them with salt & pepper between the layers, then bake for about 45-50 minutes. The best was when I used Emmental cheese, it was fabulous! I've also used this recipe with par-cooked cauliflower when I want something with less carbs, but with that I add a pizza chain packet of red peppers for a bit of a kick. Really good eats.

MAde these a couple of times, my boyfriend loved them, and I loved them too. 
Great to stick in the oven and cook with a baked chicken so they may be done around the same time while you clean the kitchen. Makes a great cheese sauce.

Very good, family and some friends just loved it. However, as stated by other reviewers, you need to make more of the sauce.And, I would suggest you sauce between layers, otherwise the potatoes at the bottom are dry. Overall a great recipe!

2 stars as written because its a good base, 5 stars with changes. As others noted, the idea of giant slimey onions in the middle did not sound appetizing, so I did the following: finely chopped one red onion with 4 cloves of garlic in the chopper, then melted 3 T of butter in a pan, sauteed onions and garlic. Added 3T of flour to this, then added the milk and cheddar/montrey jack mix as well as fresh grated parm [about 1 c. of the cheddar and 1/2 c of parm cheese], one chicken buillion cube, a dash of red pepper flakes, juice from one half lemon, 1 tspn white pepper, 2 T black pepper, and 3/4 tspn salt. This was my sauce. I placed half the potatoes in a 2 quart buttered dish, then poured half the sauce on top, topped this with some bread crumbs. Added another layer of potatoes, the remaining sauce, and topped with buttered bread crumbs. baked covered, then uncovered the last 15 minutes to brown. I realize this is basically a different recipe, but I did use this recipe as a base and so I rated it as written.

This was a very yummy cheesy dish. The flavor is excellent and my family loved it! I used 6 potatoes instead of 4 and it still had lots of cheese sauce.. And since my family doesn't like onions, I chopped them up small and sautéd them in the butter.. It gave the dish that extra flavor without onion rings :) this is a keeper

Very good, easy to make.  I would cut the onions in pieces instead of rings...rings were difficult to eat. I can see adding prosciutto or ham to make this a one dish meal.

Love this!  I was concerned about the onion rings, so I caramelized diced onion til brown and added some grated garlic to the last few minutes of cooking the onions and sprinkled them between the layers instead.  I think the amt. of cheese is great as is. I used a fork to gently lift layers of taters to let cheese seep everywhere.  It's delicious with ham, pork, chicken, anything really!  Excellent cheese sauce for mac and cheese (i do a similar one, but this is better somehow) too.  I made one batch of the sauce for 16 oz of egg noodles (was out of elbow) and at first it looked like it would be too much sauce.  I used it all anyway, because I didn't want to waste it and it was wonderful.  I will use elbow or another heartier noodle next time though.  Thanks CathyM for a great recipe we will enjoy for years.

Very easy to make.   I followed the recipe exactly except for two alterations: 1 - I used pre-packaged "Mexican" cheese (a blend of cheddar, asiago, and a few others) since I didn't have cheddar, and 2 - I used 6 potatoes instead of 4.  Even then, the potatoes came out cooked, creamy, and delicious!  This was super easy to make and well worth it.  Thank you!

I've made this recipe a couple of times now.  It's quick and tasty.  However, I do suggest a couple of alterations.  Like other reviewers I'm not keen on the texture of onion rings in my gratin, but don't omit them.  They add a nice flavor to the finished dish.  Instead, dice then and sautée with the butter when making the cream sauce.  Also, I slice my potatoes a lot thinner then 1/4".  It helps the dish cook quicker.  Mine was done in under an hour.  I layer my potatoes with the sauce to make sure the sauce is evenly distributed throuout the dish.  Finally, I add a bit more cheese then called for and reserve a little for sprinkling on top.  As CathyM says, you can use a variety of cheeses.  Try it with gruyere.  It' amazing!  Thanks Cathy!

Very, very good. I sliced the potatoes thin with a food processor and layered as directed. I am going to make this again, but increase the cooking time to 2 hours, as the potatoes seemed to be just a bit underdone. Despite that, there were NO leftovers!

This was so good, and I am not an au gratin fan.  I used red potatoes and red onions because that's what I had on hand.  Ended up using two cups of cheese and layered the sauce between the three layers of potatoes.  Sprinkled a liberal amount of bread crumbs over the top.  Even my husband loved these, and he doesn't like cheese (I know, what's wrong with him).  Thanks!

Excellent cheese-potato side.just as the recipe directs.  Still, I decided to kick it up a bit, and also test a second version to have at the ready to accompany fall cookout grilling events.Thoroughly mixed in a hefty quarter teaspoon of cayenne red pepper to the cheese sauce before pouring it over the potatoes and onions, as well as a half cup of finely chopped fresh cilantro. We've become such great fans of Thai and Indian cooking that the slightly spicey version seems a lot more natural to our palettes now. We like the onions cut as directed, so that there is some visual evidence of them in the final product.  Finely chopped, they just disappear.  Remember to spray the baking dish before assembly; removing the lower food layer and cleanup will  be greatly enhanced.

family loved this one. Creamy and well flavored. I added a little seasoning salt and pureed some broccoli to add a vegetable content to it. Easy to make, but very rich, so its a sometimes recipe.

This is a blank-slate recipe it can be adapted any way! I carmelized the onions first, changed up the cheese to a mix of blue, fontina and parmesan and because of dietary restrictions of some guests, used gluten free flour. IF you use GF flour, beware that it doesn't act like real flour, but the results are perfect. I had also multiplied this recipe to easily feed 16.

Good easy recipe! I only had havarti cheese on hand so I used that instead of cheddar. Also diced onions as other users suggested and it came out great.

Tried this tonight and it's really yummy. I sauteed the onions a bit with some garlic first and I like them, but I think I might take the advice of mincing it next time. I think I also will make extra sauce to pour on the layers of potato. I put some bread crumbs on top but didn't really like the way they came out. Overall, really good. I'll probably experiment a bit with it, but I'm sure I'll make it again.

I made this recipe last night and it was ok, not awesome like I was expecting. It didn't have much flavor. I would try this recipe again but with some modifications, I would put extra cheese between layers and on the top, more salt and pepper and no onions and when it's done I would put a little bit of chopped green onions on top.

Very good! For the most part, I followed the instructions exactly. The only change I made was cooking the potatoes and onions on the stove first and then I put them in the casserole dish, added the cheese sauce, etc. This significantly reduced the amount of time it took to bake this dish and my potatoes were crispy on the outside and quite tender on the inside. Thanks for this delicious recipe!

This recipe called for everything I had on hand. The only change I made was I sprinkled dried chopped onion in between the layers- about a tablespoon. Everything else was the same. I made 6 servings instead of 4 and it only took about an hour.  This is a fantastic recipe!

This was awesome but just a little too creamy. It is bland but if you pair it with something with lots of flavor then it works well so it doesn't over power the main dish.

I read a few of the reviews of this recipe and based on some reports that it was a bit bland, I added garlic powder, onion powder and a pinch of nutmeg to the cheese sauce.  Other than the addition of those, I made the recipe as directed and it was an absolute hit at my friends potluck dinner.  I found this recipe to be very easy to make and the results were absolutely exquisite.  I highly recommend this recipe and its a definite keeper.

Loved this recipe but time was short, so I started the potatoes on the stove in melted butter and a little veggie oil.  Basically built the recipe then stove-top, and finished in the oven at 350 for about half an hour.  We ate ever bite!

Really yummy!  The only thing I changed was the onions.  I used chopped green onion instead of onion rings.  Ok, and I added more cheese.

Good. Halved in square glass dish. Added seasoning salt. Made whole batch using 5 or 6 big Yukon gold from farmers market. Added 1/2 tsp seasoned salt to liquid sprinkled seasoned salt and remaining cheese from bag over top. Don't forget aluminum foil. Really good.

This recipe is comfort food and went really well with our Easter ham and pineapple sauce.

I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9 by 13 casserole dish. Like another reviewer recommend, I cooked the diced onions with the butter from the sauce. I did a layer of potatoes, then cheese sauce, then potatoes and so on and so forth. I did added an extra cup of cheese to the double recipe.
The texture turned out great, and they were quite yummy, but it was lacking in the flavor department. Next time, I'll add some spices to add some dimension to the dish.

We had this for Easter. I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9x13 pan. I also carmelized the onions instead of placing them in uncooked. Everyone really loved this dish, especially with the addition of the carmelized onions.

This was awesome for Easter. A big hit. Had a problem with oven half way through so finished on the gas grill. Now I know they can be made there too and get nice and browned.

Delicious. Taking into account the comments about a strong onion flavor, I sautéed the onion first.. It added a nice caramel flavor. I also diced the onion, which made spreading much easier, then sauteed in the same sauce pan that I used to make the cheese sauce to save on cleanup.

followed the recipe except for dicing the onion- otherwise my children wouldn't eat it, but the potatoes were bland. I think garlic and bacon grease would give it more flavor. I used sharp Cracker Barrel cheese and to be honest it looks funny on my potatoes- almost like cottage cheese but not quite.  My Cracker Barrel cheese doesn't taste sharp eithet. I don't think I'll make this exact recipe again. I'm not sure if it had too much milk, but ithis dish definitely needs more flavor.

I doubled the sauce per some reviews but didn't really need too ( maybe 3/4).  Use more salt than you think.  Over all very good.  I used butter potatoes and minced the onions!

These potatoes were delicious.  I have struggled to make good homemade scalloped potatoes, but these will be my go-to recipe.  I do agree with others who said that the onions sliced weren't very appealing.  My family are not big onion fans so they did not like the slices.  I like that you can experiment with different cheeses.  I will definitely make again!

AMAZING!  #1 side dish for today's Easter brunch!!! I followed the tip of preparing 1&1/2 the recipe amount for cheese sauce.   Using a block of cheese vs. packaged  shredded cheese is a must in order to avoid a grainy cheese sauce.  I also sprinkled garlic powder and onion salt (i omitted the sliced onion)on the potato layers before adding the sauce. Must use a 2qt dish!

Made this for Easter dinner. Added a bit of dash and garlic to the potatoe mix.
It was delicious. My whole family loved it and I must tell you that I have two excellent chefs in my family.
I found it good as well, but presentation left some to be desired. The sauce was not creamy, but grainy. Maybe I was expecting something creamy like scalloped potatoes, but it did not happen.
All in all, the taste was worth a five, but for presentation I rated it with a four star.
Thank you for sharing.  Will try it again but unfortunately it will no longer be low fat and that totally defeits the purpose of cooking for that one person on a special diet.

Chopped the onions and added them to the cheese sauce instead of doing the slices.  Good recipe and the potatoes were delicious, even though they looked a little grainy.  No one seemed to care and they all got eaten!

Be warned! Recipe called for a 1 qt. dish and the dish is currently spilling over into my oven despite the fact I used a 1.5 qt dish.  2 qt would be sufficient. Not happy about all the smoke and oven cleaning.

I found that this was a great and easy recipe. The only thing I did was double the recipe due to the number I had for Easter Dinner.  Good thing as not much was left after I was told that they were the best. I would however spray the foil to keep it from sticking and remove it for the last 15 minutes or so. I would also chop the onion into smaller pieces rather than rings.  My husband claims he never liked scalloped potates but will eat them done this way anyime. I would give them a five star rating.  Thanks for a grate dish.

This is my favorite AuGratin recipe.  My change to it was because I had only 1/2 red onion in the refrigerator which I minced because I do not like stringy onion with soft potatoes and when I made the cheese sauce I added about 2 big TBS of minced dried green onions and 1 tsp of granulated garlic powder.  
This dish beats out the AuGratin dish served at Morton's Steak House for $10 a pop!
I made this last year to accompany my Easter Ham and I just made it again for today (Easter 2013).

I was disappointed in this recipe.  The oven temp. was too hot, and there was a lot of waste burned onto the baking dish.  I would pre-cook the potatoes slightly next time and cut down on the amount of milk when making the sauce.

Loved it as well as my family, though I changed a little.  No onions, extra cheese sauce and added bacon bits to the top.  Wonderful, no more box Au Gratin potatoes for this family...

pretty good. i probably needed to add a little more salt.It was a little on the bland side. but I'll make it again. Maybe with extra sharp white cheddar would give it a little more tang.

These were really good au gratin potatoes!  I ommitted the sliced onions, but added some garlic powder and onion powder to the cheese mixture which made for really great flavor!  I also sprinkled extra cheese on top for the last few minutes.  This dish was cheesy, creamy, and delicious!

This dish turned out great! However i decided to mince half an onion and mix onions into potatoes Next time I will just use a fourth or less of onion and increase the cheese by another cup.  My kids love this dish.

These were very good. I made 1.5x the amount of sauce per other reviewers' comments but will try it the regular way next time since they ended up very saucy. Tasty with bacon crumbled on top.

Definately a kid pleasing dish. The husband and I found it to be too cheesy, not quite flavorful enough, and it over-flowed the 1 qt dish, making quite a burnt mess. It would be an easy side for a big meal, but it isn't something we'll make again.

This is a 5 star recipe!!! Easy and perfect just as advertised. I cooked it at 375 instead of 400 for just a bit longer only because I wanted to cook my meatloaf at the same time. Great comfort food!!!

Excellent dish!  Since I'm one for shortcuts, this is how I make it. I layer the sliced potatoes with diced onions, salt & pepper, sprinkled flour, shredded cheese and pour a bit of milk.  After the last layer, pour more milk and slightly move the ingredients so the milk can penetrate. I also add a few 1/2 slices of bacon on top- optional. The aroma is wonderful while this is cooking and everyone devours it.

So very wonderfully yummy! I'd tried making these years ago from a different recipe, and it was so disastrous, that it's taken me this long to want to try again. This one was amazing! Easy and tasty! Definitely going in our "favorites" collection, as I see us making this very often for many years to come!

I've made this at least twice now.  Recipe is simply wonderful as-is.  Don't skip the onions, they add SO much, but do make sure your slices are nice and thin.  Also, in making this a second (or third) time, I've added a tiny bit (.5 tsp?) of dijon and a dash of red pepper flakes to the roux to add some depth.  You'll need larger than a "1 qt" casserole dish for this recipe, also.

We're often asked to bring this dish to fall and winter family gatherings, though we have always spiced it up a bit. We add some extra pepper jack cheese along with extra sharp cheddar, and depending on the accompanying dishes may spice it up additionally by adding a tiny pinch of red pepper flakes (or light "salting" of cayenne pepper) to the cheese sauce. 

Can also morph it for other root vegetables, and if appropriate shift the sauce a bit by adding a little mustard with the pepper and an appropriate complimentary cheese. 

Delicious!

Super Easy and tasted great.  Left out the onions because my husband doesn't like them and added a little more cheese and they came out great.

Absolutely delicious! I minced the onions instead of sliced, and sliced the potatoes thin. Next time I will add the full 2 cups of cheese, (8oz. = 2 cups = 1 bag), & there will definitely be a next time! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

I have never attempted homemade au gratin potatoes, and now I am wishing I would have put forth the effort years ago.  This is so easy, so tasty, and WAY better than the boxed stuff.  I used my food processor to slice the potatoes in about 30 seconds, diced the onion with a press-n-dice thing, and mixed the onions up with all the potatoes rather than creating a separate layer.  The cheese sauce was delicious.  I wan't sure I was doing it right because it seemed to take a long time for the milk to start thickening, but eventually it did, and it tasted wonderful.  (I did make a little more cheese sauce than the recipe called for since I'm a cheeseaholic.)  I also microwaved some turkey bacon until crunchy and crumbled it into the potatoes once they were done cooking to add some extra flavor.  Next time I will probably microwave the potatoes for a bit to cut down on cooking time.

Very easy! I used my mandolin slicer for the potatoes and onions.  I added garlic and garlic butter though to give it more flavor and it came out just perfectly!

I read the reviews after popping the potatoes into the oven, and was worried by the varied comments. But the worries were undue. It tasted yummylicious. First dish to be wiped out at a potluck dinner. I used sharp red cheddar. The recipe, as a base, needs no change. I will try adding bacon or sausage the next time.

This recipe is BLAND!  It is a good starter, but it needs some flavor.  I added 1T of Thyme and cut the amount of onions in half, and it made a huge difference.  Good base recipe though.

Great recipe! Unless you use really small potatoes, you'll need larger than a 1 qt, more like 2 qt. It's best to use a slicer so you have consistent thickness and the potatoes cook evenly.

I made this potato dish for Christmas dinner and it turned out great. The only thing I added was garlic powder after every layer and used sharp cheddar cheese.

This was just okay. Too much butter and cheese that doesn't result in much flavor, plus the sauce bubbled over the pan & caused smelly smoke in the house. Make sure you use an oversized pan & line the oven thoroughly before cooking.

Very very good, although there were too many onions for my taste so I used less than the recipe called for, and I wish I had done what several reviewers suggested and removed the foil for a bit in the oven to get a nice golden brown top. The ratio of cheese sauce to potato/onion seemed high, but maybe it's because I used significantly less onion. Will make again with some tweaks to these things. My boyfriend, btw, loved this as I had made it.

First time success.  I did amend the ingredients to the joy of everyone:

Added a layer of gorgonzola near the top for additional complexity.

Sprinkled some cooked bacon in the middle.

Used some grated 3-cheese mix for the top to help form a crust.

A few splashes of tabasco sauce gave some pop to the sauce.

Cutting the potatoes uniformly and thinner with the food processor ensured even cooking.

Cool - thanks!

This was pretty easy to put together with the help of my food processor to slice the potatoes.  Might be good with a dash of nutmeg or couple pinches of cayenne.  Great dish for Christmas Dinner!

I made it exactly as written and it was wonderful!  Took the foil off for the last half hour so the sauce could thicken and develop a nice crust.  Make sure you use a pan that leaves plenty of room on top or it will bubble over.

I was tired of the basic Baked or Mashed Potato side and I wanted to try something different. The only thing I did differently was to dice the onion instead of slicing it. My husband thought they could use a little more salt and pepper but you can always add that after cooking. I thought the recipe was great and so easy. I used 3 large baking potatoes and actually had enough leftover for 2 more dinners.  I think next time I'll cook it a little bit longer so the cheese browns a little... I love that!

This recipe has been a favorite in my house since day one.  As a matter of fact, I have been asked to make it for a family gathering today.  I use provolone cheese along with cheddar cheese to add a little extra flavor and I do the bread crumbs on the top.

My family loved these potatoes. I added 2tablespoons of onion soup mix through the layers of potatoes and it tasted and came out fantastic.

added 1 more cup of cheddar in. We love cheese and this dish was awesome. My family loved it perfect. Had to leave out the onions due to certain tastes but yummy.

i used the cheese sauce for mac 'n cheese too (with 8 oz of cooked macaroni noodles). Man, is this ever good! Left out the onions and just added a little onion powder when I added the salt.

I made this for a grill party and it turned out very good. I just used chopped onions instead of ring ones and used salted butted for the sauce and omitted the salt. I didn't have cheddar cheese so i used simple shredded italian cheese (1 cup) and still it tasted very good. Also as one of the reviews said i poured the sauce on every layer instead of pouring it all at the top. Thnx for the recipe

My family loved this dish! I've made it twice now and both times they couldn't get enough of it. The second time I added polish sausage and spinach, for a bit of variation. Next time maybe broccoli, cauliflower, and ham. Perfect side dish for the holiday meals coming up. Thanks for the recipe CathyM

I never rate recipes because we all cook differently and have different taste preference. I made this recipe tonight with teriyaki pork chops. I wanted some good ole comfort food.... Well with all that said. This stuff was amazing. My son did not like the onions, but what normal kid does. My husband and I on the other hand Loved it. I have already printed this recipe to add to my menu rotation.

I was worried about the cheese sauce poured on top rather than mixed in so I layered half the potatoes then poured on half the sauce, topped with the rest of the potatoes and sauce.  Next time I will mix them even more.  The sauce never made it all the way to the bottom of the pan, so some spuds on the bottom didn't cook correctly, while the sauce- sitting just on the top half- was runny. I will make these again but I will layer the sauce all the way through.

So tasty. Better slicing the onion really thin if you like your onions well cooked.1h20 min of cooking is enough.

Yum! I used a Cheddar/Monterrey Jack mix because that is what I happened to have on hand, otherwise I followed the directions exactly. My only problem with this recipe is that I couldn't stop eating it.

Made this last night and after reading the comments I made some adjustments. I added minced garlic to the butter to give it more flavor and I minced the onion and layered it in with the potatoes and cheese. As others stated, the cheese curdled after being in the oven. It is way too oily but tasted really good. I also sliced the potatoes as thing as I could and they came out tender. next time I will use alot less butter but otherwise I have no idea why the cheese curdles.

Six kids, six empty plates, one happy Mom.  Trust me there are so few things that everyone loves but this has definitely made it to the "love" list.  Just yummy!  I did use half and half instead of milk but I am sure that the milk version would rock too.  Thank you for this one!

This recipe is a keeper...Delicious. The changes I made were to chop the onion, added chunks of leftover ham, I used 3.5 c. of sharp cheddar cheese and I uncovered for the last 1/2 hour and topped it with panko bread crumbs and Kraft 3 cheese (parmesan,asiago, romano). Incredibly yum yum good!

This was my first experiment with Au Gratin Potatoes. I made them because I have 20 pounds of potatoes and wanted to try somthing besides baked or mashed potatoes.
I had 2 crying kids, phone calls from my MIL, and a husband coming home in 1hour. I had 1/2 the cheese the recipe called for, and I completely messed up the layering and ended up mixing everything together and dumping it into a baking dish. It still turned out really yummy. Even my husband who HATES dishes with milk and LOVED IT and asked me to make it again...but with bacon!

Easy and delicious.  I also chopped the onion and mixed it in.  Also added some diced ham and made it a meal.  Baked for 55 minutes covered and 15 minutes uncovered.

Awesome recipe!  I did make a few changes based on other reviews.  I dice the onions and saute them butter with a clove or two of minced garlic. I also prefer mixing everything together before putting it in the casserole dish.  Tastes great with a mixture of cheeses too (in case you run out of cheddar, like I did).  Made it into a main dish by tossing in some left-over ham.  Delicious!

Very good but I had to let it cook way longer than it said, maybe it was because I was in Florida (lower altitude?) I don’t know but other than that it was sinfully rich and yummy

What a delicious and simple recipe! I used a cheddar-jack cheese blend and used the extra cheese as suggested by a reader as well as made 1.5x the sauce (3 cups 1% milk and 3 cups shredded cheese to the 4 russet potatoes.) Nice to be able to put a layer of the sauce in the middle of all the sliced potatoes as well as on top. That was a good tip. Did not use the sliced onions either...don't think the texture would have appealed to me. Got 6 big servings out of the recipe.

This was great!  I sauteed shallots and garlic in the butter as it was melting.  Did not use onion.  Also added an extra 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar.  This heats up really well the next day too!!

I was very happy with this recipe!  The ingredients are things I usually have in the house, it was tasty, warm, filling and best of all, my family loved it!  They loved it so much that I am making it again tonight and adding just a pinch of nutmeg to the cheese sauce.  Mmmm.

Really great recipe - made it as written except put some sauce between two layers and removed foil for last 15 minutes. Really yummy and not runny at all. Will definitely make these again. 2264 reviewers weren't wrong! Thanks!

These were very good. I used 3 potatoes instead of 4, and it took a bit longer than 90 min, but they were delicious.  Definitely a keeper!

This was pretty good... If I did this again, I think I would chop the potatoes into bigger chunks rather than slicing them. The thin slices cooked and softened so quickly that when it was time to serve, it became more like a big mushy soup...

This recipe was easy and perfect, even the first time I made it!  The sauce was a lot easier to make than other cheese sauces I have tried, as it didn't stick to the saucepan or thicken too quickly.  The only change that I made was a bit more cheese in the sauce and I put mushrooms between the two potato layers along with the onions!  Seriously delicious :)

This was very good.  I doubled the recipe and left out the onions.  I think next time I make it, I will include the onions.  It was just a touch bland without them.

it was great but i had to make  a few changes. I added more spices like oregano and basil and parpreka to add some spice, it came out nice and full of flavor. Will use the reciepe again in the future.

I thought, when I picked out this recipe one evening, that it had to be too simple. It was too few ingredients.

 How could something tasty be this simple and have that few ingredients? 

The only thing that swayed me was the sheer number of delighted reviews.

So I tried it. And it took a while, but it was easy. And the brown spotting on top looked fantastic.

It was delicious.

And everyone loved it. It is now a family staple-and my older brother's new favorite food. I'm sending him the recipe right now! Thanks CathyM!

This is a good base recipe but, I like flavor. I doubled the sauce  used 2 cups of cheese & I seasoned the sauce. I added  Mrs. Dash , garlic powder, & more salt. Iam not a big fan of onions but, think it always gives flavor so, I minced it into the sauce. I alternated the potatoes and sauce layers into 2 in a 13x 9 in pan & added breadcrumbs to each layer. I also sprayed non stick spray before buttering the pan for easy cleaning.

After making this last night, I will never buy boxed potatoes au gratin again.  They were very easy and very delicious!

I made this recipe last night and it was delicious! The only change I made was dicing the onions instead of slicing them. This recipe went into my favorites file!

My husband absolutely loved this! Followed the recipe exactly except I did put the cheese sauce in between the layers and I put bread crumbs on top to make it crispy and baked for the last 20 minutes uncovered. Added a lot of salt and pepper and red pepper flakes. Came out perfectly!

Yum! Easy recipe, quick to assemble and everyone enjoyed it! My husband said I could make that anytime. I added a little garlic to the mix. I layered the potatoes and cheese sauce. I did bake with the tin foil on but removed for the last 10-15 minutes and that helped get a golden edge and top. Thanks! A keeper!

My Mother asked me to find a cheesy potato recipe to accompany our Christmas dinner ham.  I found this.  I followed this recipe almost exactly, but used half cream half milk for a richer flavor.  OMG!  This is so fantastically good, there no words!  The whole family raved and I think this will become a regular at family gatherings.  The recipe is simple and turns out great.  It is far from healthy, but if you are in the mood to indulge, it is wow!

My husband begs for this recipe for special occasions. I follow the ingredients exactly but I dice the onion instead of slicing it into rings.  It's a great, classic Au Gratin Potato recipe.

This came out great. I cooked it at the same time as a pork roast on low and slow, and I let it cook for several hours at 225, then uncovered it and turned up the heat when the roast came out. Everyone raved! I used a combination of Monterey jack and pepper jack. Yum! This one is a keeper!

Had to double the cheese sauce just to cover the four potatoes. Could have used two potatoes instead. Cheese sauce was oily and the dish was overall not very flavorful...even after adding garlic, paprika, and bread crumbs. Would not make again.

I have been making this recipe for years.  My version can be served as a main dish.  Here's how I do it: I chop up a ham steak and thinly slice red potatoes.  For a quick meal, I throw mine in my Princess House miracle dish (heats food perfectly in the microwave.) I leave the onions out.  I make the sauce as this recipe describes, but I make more of it.  Season with salt and pepper and pour the sauce over the ham and potatoes.  Cover dish with lid and into the microwave for 30 minutes.  Voila!

This was one rich, tasty Au Gratin Dish!  Family loved it.  I may have added too much butter-after baking, the sauce seemed "curdled"-but definitely did not affect the flavor.

Super easy and great tasting.  I made this exactly as the recipe directed.  I had all of the ingredients ready in prep bowls just like the pros so the process went smoothly.  Definitely will be making again for Christmas dinner.

We love this recipe.  I don't make it often because it is a lot of work, but it's worth the effort.  The only change I make is to use gluten free flour instead of regular all purpose flour in the sauce (I have Celiac); still comes together fine.

My husband and I love Au Gratin potatoes, but I had never found a recipe simple enough to try and make them... until now.  They were great! He almost licked the baking dish!  Only a few changes: I had to add more flour to the sauce to thicken it, used Colby & Cheddar (what I had), minced instead of sliced onions, and took out the foil for the last 15 min.  Thanks CathyM!

I used half 2% milk and half skim milk, no onion, a little garlic powder and it was delicious!  I did remove the cover for the last 30 minutes to allow it to brown per the other reviews.  This is definitely a keeper!

I made this for a finicky eater, so I excluded the onions.  I also used less salt because cheddar is such a strong cheese.  This dish was a hit!  Creamy and delicious, the potatoes cooked just right!

ETA: when I later made it for myself, I used the onions and added peas.  The onions really don't taste strong once they're baked with cheese, so my finicky eater might not have minded them after all!

This is incredible!  My family inhaled it tonight, and I ate more than I should have LOL.  I can't believe how simple it was and the fact that I have never made this...my 10 yo son kept asking me if I really made it LOL!!! The onions added a nice taste and I would not remove them as other reviewers mentioned.  I did slice the potatoes a bit thinner to try to cook it faster and it worked out. This is definitely a keeper and most likely will make it on the Thanksgiving table!!!! Enjoy!

These are awesome! I cooked mine at 410 degrees for an hour to save time. There is just enough cheese, the sauce thickens while baking. I sure wil be saving this as a favorite.  Delicious!

This recipe did not turn out as I expected. I baked the potatoes for an hour and a half at 400 degrees and the potatoes did not come out done enough for my taste. Like many others, I added more cheese than the recipe called for. I also did not use onions.

I did make some slight changes to the recipe. I reduced the salt to 1/4 teaspoon, added 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder and 1/4 tsp granulated chicken boullion. Also instead of following the directions on making the sauce, I made a traditional bechamel. I made the roux first then  I heated the milk to a boil then added the roux in with a whisk stirring constantly until it was thick. I took the bechamel off of the heat and added the cheese. I think next time I will slice the potatoes even thinner and bake it a little longer and will use velveeta cheese.

Excellent.  I added 1/4 cup crumbled blue cheese.  Also uncovered last 5 minutes and topped with additional 1/2 cup shredded cheese blend.

Delicious! Just needed to extend cook time to over 2hrs so potatoes were tender. Removed foil for last 30 minutes of baking to brown the center too. Next time I will decrease temp to 350 or 375 so edges don't get too browned during last hour of cooking. Yummy!

Fabulous recipe! The only change I made was dicing the onion and sauteing in a small amount of butter. This is a dish I will be making over and over again.

Oh so good.  This is real comfort food at its best.  We had these with broiled cod fillets and green beans last night.  I went back for seconds on the potatoes and my husband loved them.

The "most helpful review" here (basically "more cheese more sauce") is obviously wrong. Of course, adding more fat makes everything tastier, that's a universal truth! Cook the butter with the onion for a few minutes to soften the onion and give the butter a beautiful aroma and taste. The blandness many experienced is because cheddar is not a salty cheese, so add salt. Also, add nutmeg (because it's awesome with potatoes) and a bit of clove if you have. I let the potatoes simmer in the sauce a bit to cut down on baking time. It was amazing!

Fantastic!
When I do this recipe again I will chop the onions instead.
I also added a 1/4 cup heavy whipping cream to this recipe and extra butter.

It turned out awesome!
Give yourself extra time when making this recipe.

If I could I would give it 10 stars:)

this recipe was very delicious and creamy.  I had it for dinner and breakfast and lunch the next day.  The potatoes are good with scrambled eggs and bacon, a sandwich, or with a steak or meatloaf.  Yummy!!

I make a vegan version of this recipe that my family loves!  I substitute with almond milk, vegan "butter" and Follow Your Heart vegan Cheddar.  Instead of making the white sauce on the stove, I use my vitamix (takes about 5-7 minutes to thicken) and then I add the cheese at the end and blend thoroughly to make a smooth cheese sauce.  Once it comes out of the oven it is gorgeous - gooey, delicious and creamy.  It is so good.  I always double, sometimes triple the recipe because it is so popular at my house.  I also chop the onions into small pieces rather than rings.

Diced onions instead of slicing - Baked for 1 hour with foil on and 1/2 hour with foil off - Stuck to the bottom of the baking stone dish badly, even coating with butter - Added diced ham - Great after Easter meal

Very delicious..and rich! I made a slightly larger portion to serve 5-6 people and used 3 (very large) brown potatoes. I had to adjust it...

2 cups cheddar
5 tbs butter
5 tbs all purpose flour
1 tsp salt
3 cups milk
1 onion

I didn't mind the onions being cut into rings. Some prefer it chopped--either way works great.

No casserole dish available, only had a 12x9 metal pan that is about 2 inches deep. I read that if substituting w/a metal pan, you should lower the baking temp. I baked the potatoes at 375 degrees F for 1hr 45mins, and left it uncovered for the last 12-15 minutes to get a golden brown on top.

*I used unsweetened soy milk in place of regular milk...it still tastes really good! BUT, if you're not a fan of soy milk, use the regular milk as suggested.

Made this for Easter Dinner.  Everyone liked it.  The casserole started to burn and the potatoes were done before the suggested time was up.  Next time, I'll bake it at 375º to see if I can avoid those problems.  I'll also measure how many cups of potatoes, because there are all different sizes of potatoes.  I covered the casserole with a glass lid which allowed me to see the cooking progress without opening the oven.

Made this for Easter dinner side dish to ham.  Family loved it. Tweeked it a bit.  Microwaved potato slices for 8 minutes as others suggested.  Used 1/2 c. diced oninion, which I sauted in butter until translucent.  Added 1/4 mustard & 1/4 nutmeg & onion to cheese sauce.  Used a 13x9 casserole dish, sprayed with Pam.

I made this yesterday for Easter.  Since dinner was going to be for 22 people I increased this recipe x7.  (This would have actually been enough for about 35-40 people if having other sides.)  I skipped the onions & added a bit more cheese.  I also sprayed the sides of the pans with cooking spray instead of butter & had no problems.  It was delicious! 

For x7 the recipe I used about 16 lbs of potatoes, 21 TBSP butter, 21 TBSP flour, 3 1/2 tsp salt, 14 cups 2% milk, & 10 1/2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese (although I probably put about 12 or 13 cups in because I added extra.)  I bought a stack of foil trays from Sam's Club.  I used four "Half size deep" steam table foil pans size 12 3/4 x 10 3.8 x 2 9/16.  I put about 3 layers of the mixture in each pan.  It was a perfect size.  I had them in the oven for about 2 1/2 hours with the foil taken off during the last 1/2 hour.  It turned out great!  I'll definitely make this again!

My family loved this dish!!! The only changes were extra cheese and I used 1 cup of buttermilk with 1 cup of regular milk, and a little extra butter in the sauce. Creamy and wonderful!

A bit labor intensive for a side dish, but very tasty!  I doubled the batch and extended the cooking time by 30 minutes (with the foil off for the last 30 minutes) and they turned out perfect.

Amazing.  My fiance and I made these to go with a ham, and they were absolutely delicious!  Today, we're taking a triple batch to Easter dinner.  Can't wait to see what the family thinks!  Also, we used the cheese mix for mac n' cheese a couple weeks ago.  Thanks for the great idea!!

These were pretty good. I agree with another reviewer who said to skip the onions. I had chopped them and sprinkled throughout, but still wish I had skipped them.

I have been looking for a recipe to taste like what my grandma made me as a kid and this was spot on. Only thing I might change is a bit more cheese the next time. THe 1 1/2 cups didnt seem to be enough. I did however make it exactly the first time minus onions since my daughter helped and doesn't like them

Very good. Only thing I did different was instead of layering the onions with the potatoes, I sautéed them in the butter and mixed in with the cheese sauce while cooking. The sauce is very simular to a Macaroni and Cheese dish I make.

This recipe was fantastic; easy, fast prep time and really tasty. We do not eat any boxed or preprepared food in my house, so au gratin potatoes have been sorely missed from the menu. The husband loved them and they will definitely make the menu rotation.

These were delicious! I used 2 GIANT baking potatos sliced them and put them in the microwave for 5 minutes. I did not have 1.5 hrs to wait, this way it only took about 45-50 minutes. I made the sauce as directed, my potatoes were very large, but I would double the sauce for more potatoes. I diced the onions, layered the potatoes, added additional salt and pepper to each layer and shredded cheese. This recipe says salt and pepper to taste, but it definitely needs more S&P. Will definitely make again!

I added diced ham to make a meal out of these potatoes and it was pretty good. Next time, I will make this in a bigger dish than the recipe says. I had a big problem with the sauce running over in the oven!

A fantastic recipe! I will never again make au gratin potatoes out of a box! I made a few little changes- I omitted the onion, but I sprinkled the potatoes with onion powder, garlic powder, and salt as I layered them in the pan. I also used closer to 2 cups of shredded sharp cheddar cheese in the sauce. I shredded the cheese from a block because I personally think it tastes better! I also took the advice from other reviewers and uncovered the potatoes in the last 20 minutes of baking to get them nicely browned. Try this recipe- I KNOW you will love it!!

Simplicity at it's best! Some have stated this is bland, but one can know in advance by the required ingredients that there isn't much spice or seasoning in it. If one wants a dish with more zing then add it or look for one that has such ingredients. These are fantastic comfort food potatoes, just like great grandma use to make!

Very good, basic flavors.  We cooked this in a dutch oven with Red Potatoes and Cream instead of milk.  I also added a little bit of Jack cheese.  Very good.

Great recipe to start, though I made a few changes. I finely chopped my onions and sauteed in the pan with butter and a little garlic. I buttered my baking dish generously and started making layers: first potatoes, then onions, and then cheese sauce. I made three layers like this and topped the whole thing with a little more shredded cheddar. I baked it the same amount of time, but removed the cover for the last 20 minutes or so. Served with prime rib roast for Christmas dinner. Very good!

I have made au gratin potatoes out of the box for years, but never again!  This recipe was good - I made some changes such as dicing the onion so that it wouldn't be so obvious and I used a cheddar that had a smoked flavor to it.  Also, spread cheese and onions and garlic salt on each layer.  I sliced my potatoes a bit thinner to reduce cooking time and because I like them on the thinner side.  Very good recipe!!

I made this last night for a dinner party and it was a hit.  I did revise a little.  As per previous reviews, I added more spices, paprika, garlic, etc.  I also added some parasean cheese and increased the cheddar.  It looked a little dry so I made another 1/2 batch of the sauce.  Everyone loved this and a couple asked for the recipe.  This will be a repeat for us.

I just made this, and  it was great. Thanks a lot for posting this! I didn't end up using all the sauce, I had a bunch left over- not sure what happened, they were completely coated. I also added some extra grated cheddar on the top, which was good.

This recipe turned out great. I did hold off on the onions and substituted 1 cup 1/2 and 1/2 and 1 cup milk. I also sprinkled with Parmessan and broiled for the last 5 minutes. My wife and kids loved it....

This is so easy to make and it tastes delicious! The last 10 minutes of cooking, I took the foil off, and added extra cheese on top. My kids loved it!

Delicious! Made it for Christmas Ever dinner and got rave reviews. I give it 4 instead of 5 stars because I'm still on the hunt for the perfect au gratin potatoes.

These were awesome.  I did make a couple of changes, I had some half and half that I needed to use and substituted that for the milk.  I also had some precooked bacon that I needed to use, so I sprinkled that between the layers.  It was absolutely delicious and so easy....especially since I used the food processor to slice the potatoes and the onion.

very tasty, upped the servings to 10 and sliced the potatoes thinner so they would cook faster (finished in 50 mins, then 5 for broiling). I also did multiple layerings of potatoes, onions, and sauce (added a little paprika to the sauce, used sharp cheddar and monteray jack for the cheese) and topped with bread crumbs and parm.

Tasted just fine, the cheese turned out well but there wasn't nearly enough of the sauce for the potatoes. If you are using larger potatoes you may want to increase the sauce by a third at least. I just grated extra cheese over the top since I didn't have time to make more.

This is an awesome recipe may I say.  I live in Bogotá, Colombia and we don't have chedder cheese nor any other type of american cheese available here.  But we do have "queso doble crema" and it's fresh and natural. So I substituted it for the recommended cheese from the recipe.  It turned out DELICIOUS. My husband is now addicted. My first time and it was a hit!

This is just WOW! I didn't have russet so I used Yukon Gold and I also added a bit of garlic salt and powder. I did top off the entire thing with grated parmesan. I wanted to make sure this was a good recipe for Thanksgiving and boy was I pleased!

Excellent recipe-I used Yukon Gold potatoes instead of Russet and I think that made a big difference in taste, absorption of the butter etc. I also used 1% milk instead of whole milk. I also topped the potatoes with Panko mixed with parm. Husband went crazy for it.

this was really, really good! but...way too much butter! there was a layer of grease on the top of the potatoes when I pulled them out of the oven! I will make this again, however, will use 2% cheese and decrease the amount of butter used. Great taste with little effort.

VERY good! Love the fact that it uses natural cheese versus processed. Family gobbles this stuff up. The only suggestion I would make is to eliminate the fresh onions (and add onion powder instead).  I also used a bit of garlic salt.  This recipe does benefit from a bit of your own flavor (spice) because it can be bland otherwise.  Also, I used fresh grated parmesan sprinkled over the top insead of cheddar. YUM!

I made this as a 'special dish' for Thanksgiving.  It was so delicious, I have made it a hundred times since!  As suggested, I minced the onion,added bread crumbs and broiled the top.  I plan on trying it with macaroni next, and see how it turns out.

These were EXCELLENT! Very easy to make - my family raved about them which means I will be making them again. Next time I will work on trying to get them a little healthier - less butter and cheese.

I've made this recipe twice now. It was really good both times, but even better with diced ham added in (about 1 C.) Can't wait to try it with bacon next time.  Also, I used onion powder instead of real onions and it still had a good taste. Overall, a definite keeper!

I love the recipe yet I made some changes.boiled sliced potatoes until they were tender enough to eat.this saves a lot of the baking time.I layered the potatoes in the baking dish and covered with sliced raw mushrooms instead of onions.added all the sauce on top(was creamy and not so thick so it doesnt dry out)and added shredded cheese and panko bread crumbs.baked for 15-20 min and broiled for 3 min.it was awesomeeeee.I'll definitely be making it more frequently.

This was excellent.  I modified the recipe by using presliced potatoes (Simply Potatoes brand) and about 1/4 diced onions, and baked it about 45 minutes.  Everyone in my family loved it!  It was very creamy and had a nice cheesy flavor.  This is a recipe definitely worth keeping.

Wonderful. Following suggestions, I chopped the onion and sauteed it with bacon bits and mushroom slices, and swapped the cheddar for mozzarella, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and got a delicious, comforting, easy side-dish!

I make it without the onions for my husband and tonight is the third time in the last week he has asked me to make it! I also some times slice up a little ham and serve it as a main dish. Great for a lazy night dinner.

I left out the onion because i didn't want to take away from the cheese flavor but then it ended up being too bland for me. next time i'll use a sharper cheese.

I minced the onions like others suggested, and threw them in a bowl with the sliced potatoes with some salt and pepper then mixed it all up before putting it in the baking dish to make sure everything was evenly seasoned. The onions seemed to melt into the sauce and was so delicious.  After it was done I put it under the broiler to brown a little more, AMAZING!

I just made these potatoes, but with a few changes.  I also cooked my onions (diced) in a little olive oil and butter with about a tsp of minced garlic.  I added the flour to this and then the milk.  I also added a sprinkle of both thyme and celery seed and some salt and pepper.  I used sharp cheddar and parmesean for the cheese.  Layered the sauce with the potatoes and baked for 1 1/2 hours and then removed the foil and sprinkled some additional parmesean and baked another 15 minuted.  Turned out flavorful, golden, bubbly and cheesy.  Best potatoes ever!

This is a very good recipe for Au Gratin potatoes.  I followed the recipe as written.  But I think next time I will use 1 part cheedar, 1 part provolone and 1 part mozzarella.  All cheedar seemed to have made it too cheesey and a little salty.  But it was a delicious dish...very creamy.  Will definitely make again.

kinda blah, I took the advise of other reviewers and added more cheese. I think next time I'll try adding more salt and maybe some hot pepper flakes?

Needs more of the cheese sauce and seasoning. Will try again by doubling sauce and salt. Update: Five starts with double sauce. With each layer of potatoes, salt and pepper liberally and ladel cheese sauce over. This creates the well seasoned and bubbly cheese sauce you are used to from restaurants like Ruths Chris.

Excellent recipe!  I did saute the onions with 2 garlic cloves in butter, and I didn't layer, I just put everything in the sauce and poured over the potatoes and it was delicious!  No leftovers unfortunately, but family begging me to make it again.  Thanks Cathy, great recipe!!!

Made these last nite and they were great!  I did double the sauce and when layering, threw in a layer of cheese.  These did need to cook longer than stated.  I will be making these again!

Great start to a tasty dish but can be amped up a little.I have friends/family whenever I come to their home or they come to mine request my Au Gratin Potatoes.  I generally have to make them in roasting pan.  DO add the onions however mince them otherwise they come out like strings when cutting and eating.  For the amped up taste add shredded swiss 1 cup and 1/2 cup Velveeta cheese cut into cubes(makes it creamy)or 4 or 5 cheese slices from a pack.  This in addition to the cheddar, which should be at least medium sharp.  You may also need to add about 1/3 cup more milk.  You can pour this over the potatoes but be sure to use a utensil to wiggle the potatoes around so the cheese sauce gets down between the layers.  Btw skip putting any bread crumbs on top, you will not get the gorgeous brown bits of cheese all bubbly and gooey on top.  I promise you will never make them any other way.

Thank you for a great comfort food recipe.  There was a too much sauce for 4 potatoes, however too much sauce is better than too little!  I gave it four starts for flavor. I think that it is a little bland with cheddar.  Next time I will play around with a stronger cheese.  Overall nice!

Fantastic!  I omitted the onion because husband hates them (although I can't wait to make w/ some tender diced onions another time!), added some chopped cooked bacon (it was part of the meal anyways, so why not?), and voila!  Fabulous!  Definitely grease the pan a little, this baby will stick... but very good, much better than the stuff in the box!

These are so.......... good!!!  I chopped the onion instead of the onion rings because I was worried the grandkids wouldn't eat but it was delicious with the chopped onion.  This recipe is a KEEPER!!! Thanks for sharing.

Overall this is a pretty good recipe.  Some found these too saucy, but I found that I could have used more sauce.  I may use one less potato next time.  I also added garlic powder to the cheese mixture, as it is somewhat bland by itself.

Very good recipe.  Super creamy and tasty.  Next time I'd probably cut back on the sauce - a little too much for my family.  But, I'd definitely make it again.

I make a quick version of this for my family occasionally.  I boil the sliced potatoes until soft, then drain.  Create and cook the sauce in the microwave, then mix with the potatoes.  I don't use onion in my version.  My family will eat these until they are all gone.  I suppose you could stick my version in the oven after mixed for a bit to give it the baked touch.

This is exactly what I was looking for in an Au Gratin recipe! I can add to it or leave it as is as I please and I like that! The only thing I do do differently is I layer the sauce between the potatoes! LOVE IT! THANK YOU!

Very very good and easy.  I followed directions except made 1.5x the amount of sauce and also used part cheddar part mexican blend just to get some extra zest.  There is no way mine would have fit into a 1qt dish--made in a 2 qt.  Was excellent and everyone loved it.

These were fantastic.....about as good as comfort food gets! I doubled the recipe for a dinner party, also increased the sauce by another half and used half sharp and half medium cheddar. They were gone  in a flash.

This has become a special dish in our house.  My husband loves these potatoes.  I make them every Easter, and find other special times during the year to make them as well.  They are delicious with ham.

This was very creamy and *very* rich so I can understand the popularity of this dish. I made this as written except for chopping the onion. For my tastes, I found this dish greasy and a little too heavy.

I made these to go with my rosemary pork chops and they were a huge success only one thing I did different I chopped the onions small (only way to get my son to eat them) and next time I'm going to add bacon.

So easy!  I actually don't ring the onions, I finely dice them and scatter among the potatoes and I add twice the cheese to suit our family's taste.  Perfect and easy!

Made these for a family Easter Dinner and everyone asked for seconds of this...and then the recipe! Perfect recipe. Be sure to grease the sides of the pan before adding the potatoes as it does stick alot! We did not use onions as some of my guests do not like them. Was really skeptical of this recipe, but it was great!

Okay so it was good, I followed some suggestions, some were good, some I could have skipped. I sauteed the onions and garlic which was delish! It would have been much better with a sharp cheddar or a blend... gouda maybe? I also increased the sauce which was unnecessary, I have a lot left over. I'll probably make some mac and cheese with it. I microwaved the potatoes for half the time my microwave said it would take for them to be done, to cut down on the cooking time, and still cooked it just over an hour and it could have used a little more. It was nice not having them mushy though. So that's it, don't know if I'll ad it to the list but I did bookmark it.

Followed recipe fairly closely but took another reviewer's suggestion and made a little more sauce and poured it on half way through layering the potatoes. We used an Irish Cheddar cheese and cooked it on the barbeque (indirect heat) and it cooked really well. Very yummy and tasty!! Will definitely be adding this to my favorites.

Great results. I will use a sharper cheese the next time I make this. The only thing I changed was that I diced the onions, instead of slicing them. I think big slices of onion would be a little weird in this dish.

We made these tonight to go with our steaks and thought they were absolutely delicious. Like many other reviewers, we diced up our onion and sauteed it in a pan before layering it in with the potatoes. We also used 2 cups of cheddar and added in onion and garlic powder. With about 20 minutes remaining we removed the foil and turned on the broiler to get a crispy layer on top. These tasted great with green onions on top! Mmmm.   Our only complaint is that with all that cheese, there is quite a bit of oil in it. Not the healthiest meal, but very very good. I'm sure it will taste even better when reheated in the oven later this week!

Everyone loved this recipe!  To speed things up I microwaved the potatoes in advance so they wouldn't take as long to bake.  I also used nonfat milk and they still turned out great!

This is our new family favorite side-dish. I live in Cusco, Peru and have to stock up on cheddar cheese whenever we travel through Lima, Peru. And most of that cheddar is dedicated to the special occasions when we make this dish. Excellent. We leave out the onion, but if you're an onion-lover, keep it in - we just don't care for onions. Everything else we do just the way it's called for. I give 5 stars.

I've made these about three times now and they definitely require low and slow cooking.  I don't like raw onions - cooking low and slow allows them to cook and blend with the dish.  I also layer everything.

This is a great basic starter for au gratin potatoes. I made it basically as directed except I diced the onions and I took the foil off the last 20 min or so to brown the top a little. I thought it was very good and creamy, but it is on the "bland" side as far as salt level.  I'm trying it again today with a mix of cheeses including some parmesean for more saltiness. But, as I said, it's a great starter recipe to add your own touch to.

The first time I made this I cheated and used campbells condensed cheese soup, the 2nd I decided to try my luck and attempt a cheese sauce (I haven't been very successful in the past, but it turned out great, I prefer it over the soup mix! 
Edit: I now make this with red potatoes and cut the onion into long strips and carmalize in butter, it really adds to the flavor. I've always layered potatoes, onion, sauce, repeat, then potatoes and remaining sauce. def one of my fav dishes!

Really good! I'm giving it 4 stars because I had a problem with the cheese burning on the bottom. I left out the onions (not an onion fan) and used galic powder instead of pepper. :)

I love this recipe! I had to make a few changes to it so that myself and my family can eat it. I make it lactose and gluten free using soy milk and gluten free flour, and I dont use the onion, I sub dried minced onions..but it comes out fantastic!

Good but I used this recipe only as base. I added homemade chicken broth plus some vegetables I had on hand carrots, leeks and brocoli. This will definetly become a staple in our house!

I will definitely use this again.  I used my apple peeler/corer to slice the potatoes, microwaved covered for 15 min then baked for 15 min.  I caramelized the onions and didn't care for that so will probably omit them next time or use onion powder.  I used 1 cup each mild yellow and aged white cheddar cheese.  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because it didn't reheat the next day as well as I would have liked.  I also like that there is no soup in it.

I made two batches of this, in 8 by 8 pyrex dishes. For the first I used aged cheddar, and after reading the reviews, added a tsp and a half of horseradish for some kick. Debated red pepper flakes, but went with the horseradish. For the second I used swiss Ementhaler, and some nutmeg for flavour; next time will add a little white wine as well. I followed the recipe for amounts and baking instructions. Both were delicious with baked ham, but the critics all liked the cheddar with horseradish best. Today, I layered the ham on the bottom with the taters on top, and had a super left-over dinner. Yay!

I chopped the onions and browned them in the butter. I also added some garlic. I wish this recipe stated the potatoes in pounds since potatoe size vary so much. So, I went with bigger ones. Definitely take the foil off the last half hour of cooking. Mine looked really soupy. Good flavor, but my sauce looked lumpy and unappetizing. Not at all creamy. So browning the top helped make it look better.   I made three times the recipe in an 11 x 15 and came home with no leftovers. So I guess they liked it.

I made this along with a honey and pineapple ham for Easter dinner and me and my boyfriend absolutely loved it! It was so creamy and delicious!! The only difference I made was I chopped up the onion instead of slicing it and added more cheese between the layers of potatos and onions to give it that extra cheesy taste!

This came out really well, nice creamy texture.  At the suggestion of a few of the folks here, I microwaved the potatoes a bit before I sliced them (about 8 min for 4 whole russets), and I used 2 cups of sharp, white chedder.  It can come across as a bit bland, but we served this dish with smoked brisket, so it complimented those flavors well.

Nummy!  I added some diced ham and a bag of broccoli.  (And I couldn't resist adding some extra cheddar!)  I topped the whole thing with Italian breadcrumbs, thinking they would add some crunch (they didn't).  Since there are just two of us, this made for a lot of leftovers - which made my mouth water every time we heated up another batch! Awesome recipe!  Thank you!

Hubby and teenagers LOVED IT!!! I used 2 cans evaporated milk, dried thyme, parsley, and paprika in the sauce along with some sour cream and half stick of melted butter. I let dish bake for 45 min then removed foil and put sharp white cheddar slices on top to finish baking.

This was average at best. Not cheesy/saucy enough for my taste and i thought it was a lil bland as well. I will experiment with other recipes and most likely not make this version again.

In all honesty, this was rather dry with not much sauce to speak of. Taste was just ok. It would need a lot of tweaks before I'd make this again.

This recipe is another example the keeping it simple is always best!  Easy to make and absolutely delicious!  I used half and half instead of milk because that's all I had and it made it even richer.  I also browned pork chops and put them on the bottom of the pan I used and covered them with extra sliced onions.  I then layered on the potatoes, onions etc.  It was so "naughty" Blithe Beck would blush!

All but perfect... I down sized the recipe to two potatoes.  I did adjust the cooking time to 1 hour but I had some burning on the edges.  Otherwise, just perfect!

This took a lot of time to peel the potatoes, and I just didn't think the result was worth all the effort.

Very good. Rave reviews from guests. I liked the onion diced a strong onion can overpower this dish. My mother taught me how to make this dish 35 years ago. The only difference was she used velveeta. Using the shredded cheddar is cheaper, easier and I think more flavorable.

I want to give the recipe benefit of the doubt b/c I did change a few things. The taste of the sauce was GREAT, but it was very watery. I made the recipe for 10 people, I also used Fat Free milk, b/c that was all I had.  I am assuming that was what made it watery.I cut up the onions as well. I also used NEW potatoes (red), and for some reason they were still al little undercooked even after 2 hours.  Used Parsley to garnish. They were very tasty to me, I didn't mind the very slight "hardness" of the potatoes, and they tasted even better the next day. So if using fat free milk, I would decrease the amount used.

Very good. I have made these several times and they always come out great. Husband loves them! Also, you can make this a one-pan meal by adding boneless chicken breast or pork chops on top of the potatoes and onions. If you do this, use a metal 9x13 pan, and cook for one hour.

Tried to recipe on Christmas, I loved it.  The cooking time was a little longer than what was instructed.  Then again, the serving size was increased.  I thought the recipe was good but I think the next time I try it, I'll add more cheese and a little less milk.

This was okay in flavor.  Definitely do not use onions.  They are over powering.  Use a sharp cheese for more flavor and add more cheese.

This recipe tasted great!  I've only made au gratin potatoes from a box and these are much tastier.  I used skim milk and low fat cheddar cheese to cut down on the fat.

This was really easy to make and there were no leftovers for Christmas dinner.  I read another reviewer's change of alternating the potatoes and cheese layers and it worked really well.  Great flavor and not too cheesy.

This recipe was a little disappointing. When I cooked the sauce, it was thick and creamy. After baking the dish, it was runny and thin. Not exactly sure what occured! I baked the potatoes for an additional half hour uncovered, this did the trick the sauce thicked! Overall, it was a delicious side dish! I just wish it di not take 2 hrs to bake!

Very good. The only problem I had was a little grainy-ness in the sauce but I think cooking it just a little longer will eliminate that.

These are really good. I sliced my potatoes really thin with a food processor, so I only baked it for an hour. However, I do think they could have been better had I baked them a bit longer. I put about 1/2c more cheese in it, also. I also added more salt, pepper and some Lawry's seasoning salt. I will make these again for sure! Very tasty. Oh-the only thing I forgot to add was the onions. I think it would be good like some others' reviews to saute some diced onion first, then put it in with the potatoes and sauce. I will try that the next time.

Yummm...Love it including my boys. I don't fancy too much cheese and reduced the cheddar cheese to about 1 cup. Still good, nonetheless. It is definitely a keeper. Thank you for sharing.

This dish was OK. It was easy to make overall, but felt tired after peeling and cutting all those potatoes (I made it to serve 10). The sauce came out way too salty, I might try to skip salt next time around.

I guess I like my potatoes with more flavor.  I understand the need for a mellow comfort food at times, but these were boring and bland.  I was very disappointed with all the great reviews and wanted to say they tasted great...Sorry!

I really enjoyed this dish, even though it's not super spicy full of unusual flavors. It's just a nice, simple, comforting potato dish, and I'll never make au gratin from the box again!

Very good recipe, but use a bigger dish. I used a 1 1/2 quart glass dish and it was filled to the brim.

Okay so i didn't put as much cheese, and I needa double the sauce next time. They are a very good bases for au gratin poatoes.. I put rosemary, paprika, garlic and a huge onion in the tators.. and it was great.. I love spices.. I recommend not just basing something on chz (hint the 499 calorie count) and upping the flavor with spices (which are 0 calorie count).... But over all GREAT RECIPE.. i have tons of left overs and wil make more again!!!!!

I thought that this recipe was great! But my family doesn't like onions, so I left out the onion. They are great without the onion. My family loves them! Great dish! I plan on adding this to my Thanksgiving Dinner menu. Amazing!

I quadrupled this recipe and added ham to make as a main dish.  I put about a teaspoon of garlic powder in the sauce and used mozarella instead of cheddar because cheddar isn't available in the Andes Mts. I also sprinkled onion powder over each potato layer instead of fresh onion - to make it more appealing to my children.  Very delicious.

I thought this was very good. It was super easy to prepare and turned out good. It was a bit runny so I may have done something wrong but I will try it again. Even if it turns out runny, I'll still eat it because it was really good! ;)

As delicious as this sounded to make, I was SO tempted to bake it without the foil covering for the last 20 minutes or so, and maybe I will because my family LOVES a crispy coating on potatoes au gratin, but just as it is this is an outstandingly good and easy to prepare receipe.  YUMM!!!

It was a little bland a bit too runny to way this recipe says to make it. We tweeked it a bit and OMG! I suggest you try or tweek it to what you would think sounds good. We cut the milk amount in half and the other half was replaced by heavy whipping cream, for the thickness and creaminess. We also used 1/2c. of medium cheddar and 1/2c. of sharp cheddar, makes them amazingly rich, but not too rich. You'll still want to go back for seconds. After the dish is finished baking we removed it fom the oven, put crumpled lays potatoe chips on top and put in broiler until browned and a bit crispy. Great crust and just finishes off the dish perfect. Not a fan of those chips but in this recipe wouldn't have it any other way. My husband should market his recipes, I swear! This one gets *****!

This was very good, there was no left overs.  I will be experimenting with different chesses (as we all love chesse in my house).  I am sure every time I make it, it will get better and better.  Thanks!

I have made this recipe 2x so far, I can only stress how important it is to use russet potatoes (first time I had butter potatoes to use up and it came out blech).  The 2nd time I also, like others, chose to increase the amount of the cheese sauce but added slice leeks and diced ham in the layering, it was a total meal and delicious.

this was my first time making this recipe and I took it to a potluck. I used a mixture of Italian blend cheeses and sharp cheddar and it came out really well. The only change that I would make would be to add a little more salt and pepper. potatoes are like salt sponges, they soak up all of the salt and made it taste a tiny bit bland. I added xtra salt and pepper on my serving, and it was perfect. Everyone enjoyed it! Also, for any meat-eaters, adding ham would be great as well.

Everyone loved it! Like others I minced onions, layered potatoes and seasoned each layer with salt, pepper and a little grated cheese. When dish was half full I i poured in some cheese sauce and continued layering. When dish was full poured on additioanl cheese sauce and topped with crushed seasoned croutons. I doubled cheese sauce recipe and used left over sauce for mac and cheese. Little ones loved it!

I really like this recipe. I usually don't attempt to make Au gratin potatoes since I can't get most of the ingredients here in Europe. I loved this recipe because it's truly homemade. Also it seems so versitile. It would be super easy to add some chives or garlic. Maybe some prosciutto. Thanks for a great recipe!

YUMMY!!!  This is similar to how I make my regular scalloped potatoes, but adding cheese to the sauce.  So tasty!  My husband wouldn't even touch them to try them, but I thought they were great.  Unfortunately, that means I won't be making these much unless I want half of it uneaten.  Can't please the man!

Great stuff.  I followed the lead of another reviewer and placed the potatoes in the microwave for 8 minutes.  Never had a doubt that potatoes would be done after cooking in the oven as directed.  Thanks Cathy.

My husband hates au gratin potatoes but he LOVED these! They were so creamy and so cheesy. I was out of milk so I used heavy cream and I think that may have made a difference for us. I also used some parm and asiago cheese with the shredded cheddar. My family loved them.

I added some garlic powder, onion powder instead of chopped onion cause my husband doesn't care for the texture of onion, and black pepper. I would add more cheese next time and boil the potatos a little before baking next time to cut down the baking time.

This is a favorite at all gatherings. The only change we made was dicing up the onion & then mixed it in with the flour & melted cheese. It was awesome. We tent foil over the the top & remove it about 20 mins before done to get a crusty cheesy top. Looks & tastes great. Be careful it always overflows a little.

found this particular recipe to be on the greasy side due to the liquids from the cheese. To compensate and add additional texture to the dish I added breadcrumbs and baked for an additional 15 minutes. I feel that this would be better with a ritz cracker topping but alas, the cupboard was bare. Great taste otherwise.

When a recipe has over a thousand reviews and nearly 5 stars, why even bother reviewing and rating it yourself?  That was my thought- until I made this for the first time.  Now I'm compelled to jump on the bandwagon praising the tasty virtues of this dish.  Like many others, I opted to finely chop the onions, but that was the extent of my tinkering.  All of the flavors perfectly complement each other, and although it's rich and satisfying, it still makes you want to go back for seconds.

really good... i also mixed everything together before cooking.  just make sure to make the sauce heat completly through and stir constantly or it will be a little gritty.

Very rarely do I get a "this is awesome" comment, throughout the family, on a recipe.  GOT IT WITH THIS ONE!  This will for sure be a recipe used for family dinners for many meals to come.  AND I ACTUALLY MADE IT EXACTLY AS THE RECIPE SAID, that never happens with me!

This is a keeper.  I used a few more potatoes sliced thin, a 2 cup pkg of sharp cheddar cheese, and sprinkled a few onion flakes between the layers instead of raw onion.  I also poured some of the cheese mixture and added salt and pepper on the first layer and on top.  Very creamy and yummy.  Served with the Brown Sugar Meatloaf recipe on this site and green beans.  Great supper!

My hubby and I loved this dish. Here's what I did differently.  1. I skipped the onions. (I think they just get in the way of the potato and cheese flavor) 2. Make extra cheese sauce (an extra half recipe of sauce) 3. Put extra cheese in the sauce. (at least an extra half cup) 4. Layer cheese sauce between layers of potatoes. (make sure to grease the pan well or it's hard to get off after baked) 5. Sprinkle bread crumbs on top for extra crispiness.

The first time I made this my husband didn't care for them, now I chop the onion fine and he loves them.  No more box potatoes for us!  I usually play around a little with the spices, depending on what I am pairing these with

I made these a couple of weeks ago and and served with pork chops. The cheese sauce was very simple and easy to make. They were delicious! Will make again. A really family comfort food.

DELISH!!  These spuds are a little more saucy than what I had been used to in au gratin potatoes (but maybe that's bc I had been using the boxed stuff all this time!) but they are wonderful.  I did cook the potato slices in the microwave on high for about 5 minutes to cut down the cooking time in the oven....90 minutes is a long time, and I didn't catch that when I started cooking at 5PM!  So very good.  I will keep this as part of my regular potato rotation.

This recipe was very good and I would make again. My milk mixture didn't seem to thicken very much. I was worried that it may be too soupy even after it baked, but it thickened up pretty decent after cooling a little. My boyfriend also loved it!

Exceptionally easy and tasty Au Gratin Pototoes recipe!  I will never buy the box mix again.  This is wholesome ingredients and so simple to make.  The only change that I made was using minced onion because I don't like onion chunks.  A great side dish.

my family loves this dish but i precook the potatoes for 10 minutes in the microwave thus cutting the oven time by about 45 minutes.  that really helps with time and when it is to hot for the oven to be on a long time

This was delicious!  Will make this on a regular basis.  My potato hating child actually gobbled these up.  I diced the onions though.  Make sure not to fill the dish too close to the rim because it will bubble over!

These were very good, made them for Easter dinner and everyone loved them!  Just be careful your casserole dish is big enough...I cut it too close and wow what a mess in the oven!  Duh!  Will make these again and again (in a bigger dish!).  Thanks for the recipe!!

These were only OK.  Kind of bland.  I did add some extra seasoning but maybe not enough.  Nothing wrong with these potatoes... just nothing great about them either.

I made this for company and the dish was scraped clean.  I followed the recipe to a "T" and it's great as is.  My favorite part?  No soup needed in this easy to make, no frill but absoluty yummy, Au Gratin Potato recipe!  Try it!

These were good. Definitely worth making as opposed to using those dried/packaged au gratin potatoes. But something was missing for me. I think I'll try to add some sour cream or chives (or both!) in and see if I get that "wow" factor the next time.

Very good! I followed the recipe as is and there were not any leftovers, it was a big hit with the whole family. My two year old loved them!

This is a great recipe, but I only gave it 4 stars because I changed it a little bit. I use 2 cups of cheese as opposed to 1 1/2. I mix the 1 1/2 into the roux and then use the extra 1/2 cup for topping. I mix some melted butter and italian style bread crumbs and top the potatoes with that, then sprinkle the rest of the grated cheese on top before putting in the oven. I use extra sharp white cheddar. I also skip the onions. The roux can be a pain, once the butter is melted I remove it from the heat completely until the milk is stirred in, then I continue stirring on low heat. Made with no onion and the buttered breadcrumb/cheese topping these are very similar to my mom's macaroni and cheese. Delicious!!

Scrumptious! Perfect recipe. I cooked 6 medium potatoes and all was perfect with the amount of liquid. Mine was a bit salty for me. Perhaps I was too distracted cooking while talking on the phone...will have to watch that for next time, especially because I have never made Potatoes Au Gratin. These also made great leftovers in a scrambled egg and bell pepper Frittata.

Sweet fancy Moses these were good!  I followed the recipe exactly just sliced the potatoes very thinly and it cooked in only 35 minutes.  I am a dessert lover but after these I didn't want dessert- just more cheesy potatoes.  They are addictive!!!!!

this is great, the reviews are spot on. only thing i would change next time is decrease the cook time cause my convection oven over cooked it with the suggested time, so check after 50 min. to adjust. but, u will not be sorry if u make this recipe.

These were great. Followed the recipe exact except I diced the onions and layered them in with the potatoes. It was nice and creamy, I used a medium cheddar. Will make again!

I make au gratin potatoes quite often as a side dish and forgot how long to cookand what temperature, so voila I use the same recipe except that I chop the onion and mix thoroughly and I add some worcestershire sauce.  I also add worcestershire sauce to my mac & cheese with bread crumbs on top with rave reviews.

The flavour of this dish is great and preparation is easy. The issue I have is with the directions in terms of the size of the dish called for. There is no way all of this would fit into a 1 qt dish. I used a dish much larger (probably 2 qt) and the overflow in my oven made the whole house smokey. Also, the temperature is, I think, too high, as the pottom of the potatoes was burned. The upper layers were delicious, thoug, and I will definitely make this again in a bigger dish at a lower temp. thanks!

An excellent basic recipe as is or for adaptation.  For those who think it is too bland, use an extra sharp cheddar &/or a dash or more of hot sauce.

This was really good. I made a few changes. I did not use any onion since I had none on hand and used 1 cup of skim milk and 1 cup of evaporated milk. Still turned out great. I will definitely make this again, hopefully with diced onions.

Yummy!  I was worried that these would lack flavor without any additions but these were PERFECT!  If you wanted to cater this around a main dish, you could add stuff such as herbs, or bacon but trust me, they're great on their own!

I would make this recipe again, but will probably try to flavor up the cheese sauce next time.  This is a pretty bland dish if you make it as is, despite the large amount of onion it calls for.  Like many other reviewers, I chopped my onions rather than leaving them in rings.

Not a fan.  Mine ended up tasting just like a baked potato with some bland cheese sauce.  Nothing special.  My husband actually said he prefers the box kind!

this recipe was awesome. I made this with leftover ham. I sprinkled onion powder on each layer of potatoes and then the ham slices. I also added dry mustard to the sauce just a little and it really gave it a great flavor. I will make these again. The best au gratin potatoes ever!

good, definantly needed to salt and pepper more once done.  I wasn't really excited about the onions so I used onion power directly on the potatoes.

These were pretty good but not as good as I was hoping for.  I would call them a little bland.  I left out the onion because I'm not a huge fan.  I may make them again but I'll try to think of a way to spice them up a little.  We had them for Easter dinner with Ham, Green Beans, Crescent Rolls and Strawberry Trifle.

really good recipe. It's a great all natural dish if you're concerned with boxed products full of ingredients that are hard to pronounce. I will probably play around with seasonings until it's just right for our tastebuds! Thanks for the great recipe!!!!

I give it 4.5 stars.  It will get a 5 star when I make it again and add more cheese to the sauce.  It's a keeper.

I lightened this recipe by using fat free evaporated milk mixed with skim milk & 2% milk cheeses.  Pretty good.  I needed a little more salt but overall tasty & cheesy.

I am SO not a cooker, so I have a silly question:  Am I supposed to cook/boil the potatoes BEFORE I do this recipe, or am I just supposed to peel/slice them for this recipe and they COOK in the oven for that hour and a half?   Curious, because my sauce was AWESOME and I peeled/boiled the potatoes beforehand and THEN put them in the casserole dish and put the yummy sauce over it, but I didn't think it needed that long to cook.........I guess I'm wondering because once I added UNCOOKED potatoes to a similar recipe and they were so GROSS because the potato starch made them bake weird.  Thanks for your help!  And sorry I'm such an idiot not to know, but it doesn't say in the recipe! :o)

These potatoes are great. We love cheese, so I added one more cup of cheese to the sauce. This side dish was a great companion to our Easter ham.

Doubled the recipe, nixed the onions (in honor of a few young eaters), and added 1/4 cup of cooking sherry and a few dashes of garlic powder. Yummmmmmm.

Great recipe and one where you can fudge the measurements and have it still come out yummy. I usually add more potatoes and onions than the recipe calls for, and I've even been short on cheese, but it still tastes great.

Just finished making this for dinner and it is wonderful!  I did substitute dried onion for the fresh onions and added a little pepper to the sauce.  The potatoes are nice and soft and the sauce cheesy. Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

A little time consuming vs the box stuff but so worth it. I only wish I made a double batch because there wasn't any leftovers.

We really enjoyed these potatoes.  I minced the onions rather than leaving in rings, it just did not appeal to me.  Otherwise followed recipe exactly.  I will use this recipe again and again.

It is bland comfort food, but I'd rather have good comfort food. Reminded me much of au gratin potatoes from the box. If you really follow the directions, 4 russet potatoes is not enough for the amount of sauce (I guess it depends on their size though), if I had used a 1 qt dish it would've overflowed (used 1 1/2 qt and it was to the top), and my cook time was more like 2 hours. The sauce was not as thick and creamy as I would have liked and needed more cheese. I have a few Au Gratin Potato recipes I like to use, this won't join that collection.

Very good recipe.  I do agree that you need to use a larger dish, 2 qt. would work. And I would have made more sauce.

These potatoes were delicious!! The only thing I changed was I diced the onion and sauteed it with some garlic and pepper then added the flour and milk. Everyone loved them and they were maybe even better the next day.

Awesome!  Will definitely make again and again.  I used a cheddar cheese blend with bacon bits and it was great!  I had to remove the tin foil in the last 30 minutes so that I could get that crispy top!!

Not bad, but it does need a little more flavor as is. I sauteed the onions with garlic a little and didn't salt the potatoes. I also added fresh basil and some dried oregano on top of the second layer. I also used red, yukon and russets, a few more potatoes so I added another half the amount of cheese sauce. It took a while to get the sauce to thicken, I didn't want to scorch the milk, but it worked out to cook out the flour well. It did get nearly burnt around the sides and on the bottom (as if the cheese traveled down and bubbled to nearly fried), but it was still good. My husband said he's tried this recipe before and did not like it as is, but my variation was quite good. Just subtle flavor additions, nothing overwhelming. Oh, and I served w/ fresh chives on top.

This was okay. I think it was way to creamy. If I would make this again I would put in more potatoes or less sauce. Also the sauce was very oily.

This was very good. I did add some extra spices, dried garlic, thyme and tuscan mix I had in the spice cabinet. I backed it for 1 1/2 hours and then took the foil off to brown.  20 minutes later it was beautiful an brown on the top. Make sure you let it sit for about 10 minutes or so before you cut into it. I will make this again!!

I've tasted better. The cheese sauce needs work as the flour did make it go lumpy-ish and kind of dry after I pulled it out of the oven - it was fine when I put it in. The sauce needs to be creamier. This was an average potato bake, none one exclaimed over it, but most ate it.

These potatoes are a family favorite! I did finely chop the onions and cooked them in the butter before adding the flour.  Now one day I just HAD to have these potatoes, and didn't have the 1 1/2 hours to bake them, so I put the potatoes in the microwave for 8 mins. then finished baking them in the oven with the sauce for 30 minutes and they turned out perfect!!  Thanks for posting this recipe.

if ur using 2% milk, add an extra 1/2 tb to the flour portion for a total of 2.4 TB to the recipe or it won't thicken up very well.

I like this recipe but I did something different. I don't like the regular potatoes I use the sweet potatoes and it gave it a different twist to the favor.

It's really good! My 1st time to make potato au gratin and it was enjoyed with complete silence and nodding heads! I also made some changes with mine, i.e. cook the chopped onions in the butter cheese sauce instead of placing sliced ones with potato, made extra half portion of the suggested recipe so that I had enough to have a layer of sauce on top of each layer of potato, added some garlic and onion powder into the sauce, used cheddar and gruyere cheese mix and finally sprinkle extra cheese on top to make it brown and crispy. I baked it for 1.5 hours and then extra 30 mins in the end under grill to brown the top. Everyone couldn't believe how tasty it was and we had it with a bbq!

This is exactly the recipe I was looking for!  I noticed some people were saying that the sauce was missing something.  I usually add 2 things to the roux (flour and butter mix):  garlic powder and mustard powder.  Very good recipe!  Thanks!

These got rave reviews from everyone at dinner.  9 people in total.  I even forgot to add the onions and didn't remember until we were all eating.  I can't imagine them being better, but next time I will try adding in the onions.  Excellent easy recipe. Thanks

I liked it but I should have cut them a little thinner. Next time I will also add more cheese sauce to them. I added ham and served it as a main dish, with a salad.

Very rich and delicious. Needed a little more seasoning for us. The sauce to potato portion was a little too much, so you don't have to pour all of it on the casserole. Very good, will be making it again often.

I really did love these potatoes, the creamyness [I think I spelled that wrong] of the sauce was wounderful. I tried to go with what 'Luminous' wrote [and she is right] and stay with the simple ingedients, but.. I do think it does need alittle bit of spices. I am diffently going to make this again, but maybe just a little bit more of a sharper chedder, and some spices. Thank you for a great recipe.

I thought there was way too much cheese mixture for the amount of potaoes in this recipe and it resulted in a large amount of grease on top.  Not too appetizing, but the taste was ok.  Maybe I used the wrong cheese???  I just used the shredded cheese that comes in the package in the dairy isle.

This was a fabulous dish. I sauteed the onions with some garlic and butter, then added the rest of the ingredients, and finally, layered the potatoes and sauce. After adding generous amount of cheese to the top, this came out perfect. I think I added a little paprika at the end to give it a little more flavor. Definitely try! Yummm.

These are excellent! I cut my potatoes super thin and added a bit more cheese. I sprinkled potatoes with salt, pepper and onion powder. I also added cayenne to the cheese mixture. Left out the onions too. Don't care for them.

I made this for a dinner party last night, alongside pork tenderloin, and it was a big hit!  I doubled the recipe and sauteed some onions and garlic before layering them with the potatoes, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  We only had one spoonful left at the end of the night.  So, I made another batch tonight for dinner with my family!  This will be a regular in our house - Thanks!

Good recipe but a little bland. I had to add some spices after it cooked because it was to bland for my taste. I recomend some garlic and red pepper flakes. I think it would be better with french fried onions.

Very good.  I wonder, though, if it would work to layer the milk and cheese without boiling it first, since cheddar tends to separate when subjected to high saucepan heat.

I used the calculator to adjust the servings to 6. Then added minced onion and garlic powder to the roux. Tossed everything together with "new" potatoes and baked! Bliss!

I followed what other reviews suggested and left out the onion.  But other than that this is a great recipe!!  I will never buy au gratin potatoes in the box again!  Plus I added some left over ham from Christmas and threw some broccoli in and made it into a casserole. Viola!!

Delicious!  I made this as a side dish for our Christmas feast and it was a hit!  I followed the recipe to a T, except for adding an extra cup of cheddar cheese since I wanted it nice and cheesy!  I definitely recommend this!

I made as directed, except used half the amount of potatoes, but still made the full recipe amount of sauce. Sprinkled some bacon bits on top as well. Turned out tasty, but very rich. I should have halved the sauce to match the halved potatoes.

My friend loved this recipe. Next time I'll chop up the onions and layer the potatoes and onions rather putting all the onions in the middle. I'll also pour the sauce between the layers rather than all on top so the potatoes get soaked with the cheese sauce.

Very easy and quick...the only suggestion I have is to use a 2 quart dish so it does not take so long to bake. And remember: the thinner the potatoes the quicker they cook:)

In all my years of cooking cheese potato casseroles, this was the best recipe and family loved it at christmas brunch with ham.  I used one bunch of green onions, andjust enough of the green part to add a little color as didn't want to overwhelm the sharp cheddar cheese. The calculator is a huge help for figuring ingredient amounts to serve more than four persons.

Such good comfort food. I didn't use actual onions, I did onion salt, but still, so good. Just simple and good. If you like potatoes and cheese, this is for you. I left the skins on for some added nutrition.

This is a great recipe for year round occasions.  I diced the onions, which I think adds to a better texture. You could put diced ham in this for a casserole.  This recipe is much like making traditional macaroni and cheese.

great recipe.  i also did the sauce x1.5 but could've gone with not 1.5-ing the salt if that makes sense...the cheddar adds so much flavor that you don't really need that much salt!

I eliminated the onion and used onion powder instead. 

About 45 minutes through the cook time, I took the potatoes out of the oven to see if they were almost done. I tasted them and found them a little bland, so I added some ground thyme, oregano, ground black pepper, and salt. I stirred it up really well and put it back in the oven uncovered for another half hour. I was nervous when I tasted it - it was bland and pretty soupy - but it ended up being very good. I took it to a girls' night and my friends gobbled it down.

Pretty good for gratin, recieved compliments when we made it for Thanksgiving.  One recipe makes more than four servings - more like eight, at least.  Maybe we'll add chives next time.  I loved the onion but my husband didn't.

Delish!  I added some chopped, spiral honey ham, left out the onions and added a goodsized handful of blue cheese crumbles, it makes the cheese taste even cheesier.

I only had white cheddar, next time, I will use orange, I think it looks nicer.  But it didn't matter cause it was very good

This is a fool-proof recipe for comfort food that is a bit bland (which is how I like it). Use Vidalia onions if they're in season and add plenty.

I love this recipe! It was super easy to make and didnt require many ingredients. I used a 2 quart dish instead and it worked out really well. I uncovered the potatoes for the last 5 minutes to broil them a little. I was really surprised how well it turned out and how great it tasted.

COMFORT FOOD....for sure. Doubled the recipe and took it to a family gathering. Even family members that aren't au gratin potato fans, liked it. Made a couple alterations. Sauteed the onions and a little minced garlic in some butter prior to adding to potatoes. Also, added some garlic and onion powder to the layers of potatoes. Also, added a little cayenne pepper to give it a small kick. I added quite a bit of black pepper and some fresh parsley. Very good recipes...thanks. Perfect compliment to baked beans and steak. 5 star

This was really great. My husband was really impressed. After seeing other reviews, I chopped the onions instead of slicing them. Make sure you use a bigger dish for it, though. My 2-quart dish worked well.

A perfect and simple recipe.  My husband loved it and it will be made again. I used sharp cheddar cheese, lowfat milk,and lowfat margarine because that is all I keep and how we eat. We ate it with grilled steak and salad - wonderful. This is a real Au Gratin recipe.

Absolutely fantastic!  Make sure you use something bigger than a 1 quart casserole though because that is definatly not big enough!

Really good. Not a ton of flavor, but the appropriate amount for this classic dish. I made these for a funeral and used shredded hash browns in place of sliced potatoes. I also diced the onions rather than sliced and reduced the amount. I used evaporated milk (ounce for ounce) in place of fresh milk. Since hash browns were used rather than sliced potatoes cooking time was reduced to 1 hour.

Yum!  This is exactly what I was looking for.

Very easy, very cheese-y and my kids gobbled it down.  I'm not sure if I messed up my roux, because my sauce was a bit "grainy", but it was still great.  So good that I keep eating it cold out of the fridge!

This was good, however, much of the cheese sauce ended up just falling off the potatoes and burning at the bottom of the casserole dish.  This was also my fault, granted, as I scaled the recipe to serve two and then used a bigger casserole dish than I should (all I had).  Consequently the cheese was kind of blended into the potatoes but it lacked that nice soupy texture.  Next time I will toss better with the potatoes before baking.

As many of the reviews state: this recipe is great! I used some of the others' advice and did not add rings of onions, but rather mined onions, which was good. I added more cheese than it called for to the sauce, which was good for a cheese lover like myself. I didn't end up cooking it for the whole hour and a half - maybe because I was making only two servings not four. You will not regret making this recipe! Try it and see!

I was impressed with the simplicity of this recipe, even though it was very "homemade". If I'm going to follow a recipe, I prefer not to start with a can of soup!  Anyway, I substituted about 1 cup of milk with buttermilk, and I used whole wheat flour for the rue, and it turned out perfectly.  I also skipped the step in which she added the cheese to the milk gravy.  Instead, I just sprinkled it on top of the 'taters and poured the milk gravy on top.  This was DELICIOUS.  It should be noted that the reason I used buttermilk is not because I thought the recipe might need it, but because I had some I needed to use!  Same with the flour.  I've got wheat flour on hand, so that's what I used!  I think this is the sort of recipe that you can "tweek" and make your own, and just about anything you do will still come out wonderfully well!

Great recipe! I changed it a little by leaving out the onions (I'm outvoted 4-1 against the use of onions in my cooking), but my family loved it, even my picky 3 year old! Now that's saying something! Try this one, and you'll have a really happy family!

This is the first time I have ever made Au Gratin Potatoes that wasn't from a box.  Oh my goodness....I didn't realize how easy it would be and they taste awesome.  Very Creamy and the onions just give it the right taste.  Make sure you make extra because the leftovers are just as good if not better.

This was good, a bit bland, but basically a nice dish. Next time I will uncover the last 10-15 minutes so the top gets that pretty browning effect. I'll also chop the onion into smaller pieces instead of rings, my kids were able to pick them out as rings, if they were chopped they would not have noticed as easily.

Fabulous ! I made it pretty much as is, minced onion instead of slices. I didn't have russets, so I sliced some red potatos, not knowing how much potato they would yield. I ended up with more sauce than potato, but nobody complained ! I'm looking forward to trying this again with others' suggestions. Thank you !

My husband and I thought this was great.  The only change I made was to use dried minced onion since I didn't have fresh.  I used an extra sharp cheddar and it had good flavor.  The only thing I would definitely do next time is to make sure all the potatoes get coated in sauce-otherwise they stick together and don't cook completely.  There was a slight grittiness to the sauce but that was due to the cheese.  This will become a staple in our house.  The nice thing about the recipe is you can vary the cheeses to get different flavors.  I might try a fondue cheese for part of the cheddar next time, but like I said, tasty as written.

Added ham and 2 extra potatoes- was still saucy enough,also added some garlic and red bell pepper, personal preferance. The last 10 mins added parmesan and bread crumbs to the top. This made a perfect main dish. Great flavor.

Delicious!  If you want more "bite" just use freshly ground pepper and a fair amount and be sure you are using good extra sharp cheddar.  It is easy to put together ahead and bake later for dinner.  I will make it again and again.  ***Update: Not remembering I had made this before and even rated it, I made it last night.  I used about double the cheese, about 3/4 Swiss and 1/4 extra sharp cheddar.  I put three large, chopped garlic cloves in the sauce while cooking and about 4 dashes of nutmeg (not enough--would try two additional dashes the next time).  When layering the potatoes and onions, I seasoned each layer with salt and pepper.  Also, once the sauce was put together, I added at least 1- 1/2 cups more milk to extend it so it would cover the potatoes and onions well. (Used a medium sized glass Pyrex pan, about 9" x 11")  I did use Namaste gluten free all purpose flour to thicken (step-daughter coming to dinner) the sauce.  This in no way changed the flavor or texture.  We are having leftovers tonight with steak!

Why do mine turn out so runny? I have tried to make this twice. The first time I was a little rushed so I though it was my fault. The second time I paid extra attention to the cheese sauce. I made sure it was as thick as it would go. I even broiled it in the last couple minutes which did make the top crispy and delicious. I added green pepper to the potatoes amd added garlic powder to the cheese sauce for some flavor. For the amount of time this is I don't think it is worth the work. It also tasted like it was missing something.

I only gave this recipe 3 stars because I hard sort of a hard time with it.  My only modification was to chop the onion.  My potatoes came out pretty dry, but it may have been my fault.  They just didn't seem very cheesy to me.  If you want a delicious cheesy potato recipe that is simpler, try the Baked Potato Salad I recipe on this site.

They were very good, but I've had better. But I will make them again because the ingredients are ones that I usually have on hand.

I have no idea what went wrong. I followed the recipe without any changes. The cheese mostly separated from the milk while in the oven. It thickened a little upon standing, but overall the texture was slimy. They were edible.

I made this for Easter dinner and it turned out wonderful, I chopped the onions finely and I also added some paprika to the potatoes before I baked them, It was simply easy and tasty!  I think my family will disown me if I go back to the boxed ones

These are great.  I cooked them in the slower cooker also from a previous comment.  If you choose to do this cook them slow and for a long time so the potatoes get done.

I am very adventurous when it comes to food and flavors! Not to mention, I'm Italian, so I never had anything like this on holidays growing up. But sometimes you need a delicious, simple cheesy potato. And this is it. I prefer to avoid canned soups which is why I chose this recipe. I have to say, it was excellent and incredibly well received on Easter! I didn't change a thing. Thanks a bunch.

I was looking to make something homemade to go with our ham on Easter Sunday - everyone loved these potatoes!  We did need to add a bit more salt to them on our plates, but next time I know to add more to the dish.  Like other reviewers, I sauteed minced onions.

Definately a keeper!

I was disappointed in these- for as much fat they had, they were bland.  I have read some call it "comfort food" but they wasnt savory- like the difference between unsalted and salted butter on bread.  In fairness, I have never made au gratin potatoes from scratch before and I think a lot of recipes look similar, but I have to say I prefer the box version and I'm shocked to say it.    I also sauted the chopped onions and added a little garlic until carmelized before adding them in and that was the only thing in there had really had flavor.

Excellent! Reduced cooking time by 5-10 minutes, my potatoes were starting to burn on the bottom of the pan-Also uncovered during that time to allow a little browning. Delicious, you'll never use box potatoes again!

Great recipe!
Very easy to follow and tastes great.
I skipped the onions b/c my husband doesn't like them. I used the 4 cheese mexican blend (that's what i had at home) and added a little grated parmesan for a "zing".  i also sprinkled a little more parm and italian breadcrumbs on top (just a little) which gave it a nice taste. i uncovered the pan the last 15 minutes of baking to give it color.  
This is a SUPER easy SUPER tasty recipe. Guaranteed hit.

These were good, but I think I had my mind set on a slightly different taste.  I made the mistake of cooking the onions a bit to lessen their strength, but I think the more raw onion taste would really have added a bit of the missing flavor.  I was not crazy about the consistency of the cheese sauce, either.  Overall, I think this was a good comfort food recipe.  I would have given it 3 stars the way I prepared mine, but I will give the original recipe the benefit of the doubt and rate it a 4.

It's simple au gratin potatoes! Great as is when you don't want complicated tastes to overwhelm your other dishes served, or change up the cheeses and spices to add dimension. A welcome addition to my recipe box.

Absolutely fantastic dish, and also extremely easy.  I didn't have onions to use, and I used a "Mexican" blend of cheeses rather than straight cheddar but it still turned out really well.  I'll make this one again for sure!

This is AWESOME. You will never buy those dry potatoe packets again. I always sprinkle some sharp cheddar on top too just before it goes in the oven.

I have limited kitchen utensils so this dish was perfect. I substituted Gouda and Brie cheese for cheddar but it was still delicious, I think it's one of those recipes that is virtually impossible to mess up.

this is a great recipe without the processed cheese. with a food processor the slicing of potatoes goes quickly and makes this an easy recipe. i dice the onions and add garlic, then i saute those before adding to potatoes. add some red pepper flakes for a kick. very easy and delicious.

This was so good and I was even missing the onion.  I sprinkled about 1 tsp of onion powder in the middle where the onion normally would have been.  I also added 1 tsp garlic powder and 1 tsp onion powder to the sauce.  We only had mozzarella cheese and that worked and tasted great.

Followed recipe exactly when I first made these:  perfectly delicious.  Also as delicious today when I made without the onion but addition of onion powder, garlic powder, a little extra cheddar and about a half to three-quarters cup of freshly shredded parmasean.  Today also added some breadcrumbs on top and put under the broiler at the end for an extra crunch crust.  Very good!    I think next time around I might even add some roasted garlic paste to the cheese sauce.

I made this for my workmates. They are my testing ground before I take the recipes home to cook. Their variety of tastes help me to adjust for my family. Making this as stated made a wonderful tasting dish...not very pretty, but excellent taste. Making this with some cream of mushroom with roasted garlic gave it some zing plus using two types of cheese (Cheddar and provologne) after the potatoes were done to spread on the top and lightly brown made a very attractive dish both for work and for homw. Thank you.

This recipe was amazing! I cooked it for my boyfriend who said he didn't like potatoes au gratin, and he loved every bite of this! I took user suggestions and sauteed the onions in garlic for 5 min before adding. I also topped it with Ritz crackers and Parmesan cheese for the last 15 minutes. I have been trying to find a recipe for "cheese potatoes" that my mom used to make, and this is the closest I've come.

These potatoes were super yummy and creamy which was a surprise considering they had no heavy cream.  I did use whole milk though.  I am also not a fan of whole onions so I sprinkled 1 tsp of onion powder over potatoes as I layered them.  I did sprinkle on a bit of garlic powder too.  In the last 10 minutes of baking, I removed the pan and added a little extra sharp cheddar cheese on the top and stuck them back in the oven.  DELISH!

The potatoes were so creamy, i can still taste them! I took the other users' advice and sauteed the onion in a little butter and garlic.. just till soft. that added immense flavor to the potatoes. this dish was a hit with my husband. Will definitely make it again.

Yum! A tiny bit bland before I poured it on the potatoes, so I added 1/2 cup more cheese. And the sauce was a little thin. But my friends raved about it and went back for seconds and thirds!

This is soooo easy to make.  I added mozarella cheese to the recipe and used a mixture of colby and monterey jack cheese in the sauce.  I also sprinkled a little of the shredded cheese on top of the potatoes.  It came out great and tastes wonderful.  Next time I am going to try adding a little garlic powder as others have mentioned on here.  Thank you so much for this recipe.

WONDERFULLLLLL!! I added a little extra cheese and would recommend not using a whole onion. I only used a few onion rings and it gave it plenty of flavor

I have always wanted to make au gratin potatoes and finally did!  After reading a few of the reviews, I did make a few additions.  I sprinkled minced garlic, pepper & parsley flakes on top of each potato layer.  I followed the directions for the cheese sauce but added fresh grated nutmeg as I do for all my "cream" sauces.  This casserole turned out very good!  Even picky DH who said he hates au gratin potatoes ate seconds!  This is a keeper!

Absolutely delicious. I added the salt and pepper for taste, but don't put too much cuz I think this was meant as a plain, kinda bland dish. I'd also suggest cutting the potatoes and onions into smaller pieces. Dicing the onion and smaller 1/4 inch potato slices would be easier to scoop up and eat. Overall really good, and I will probably make it again.

Really good.  I tried making it in the crock pot, but moved it to the oven, then kept warm in the crock pot.  Used the tip and made with cracker barrel cheese.  Went over very well for Christmas.

To be fair, it could very well be my fault that this did not turn out as well as I had hoped. I ran into a few bumps in the road, and it's likely that they may have caused the taste of the dish to suffer.

Still, I'll try a different recipe the next time I decide to prepare potatoes au gratin.

This was creamy and good.  I forgot to add the salt so I tried to sprinkle it on...I won't forget it next time!  I may even add a little extra next time.  I never add extra salt to my food but this one needed it!

This recipe was great!  It was my first time making Au Gratin potatoes.  Everyone loved them and they went great with the ham too.  I adjusted the recipe serving size to 10 and used 2 cups of chedder cheese and 1 cup of mexican cheese.  Our friend from Sweden said it reminded him of a dish he has in Sweden.

Made this for Christmas.The only onions I had were green onions so I used them and they worked great. I doubled the recipe and used a 2Qt casserole dish. Not a good idea cause I had too much cheese sauce for the dish.  Next time if doubled I will use a 9x13 pan.  A definate keeper.

These were delicious and nothing was leftover.  I took others advice and sauteed the onions with garlic and then sliced the potatoes very thin and layered the onions and potatoes about 4 times, ending with potatoes.  I also used cream and milk combined with some garlic powder mixed in.  It was heavenly!

I could not believe how great these potatoes were.  I only made a few changes-- I had some heavy cream that I wanted to use up so I used it in place of milk, also I finely chopped the onion instead of slicing like several posters suggested.  Best au gratin potatoes I have ever had.

Awesome!  I mixed in some minced garlic with the onions and used a combination of Colby Jack and Pepperjack cheeses as that was all I had.  I would make this one again in a heartbeat, thanks!

Definitely lives up to it's name - these were very creamy potatoes. Great texture and not excessively heavy or rich. I too used minced onion, though only half an onion seemed to do the job for me. Also added in additional shredded cheese directly to the potatoes, prior to adding the sauce. Great with my Christmas dinner. Holla!

Fantastic !!!  I made this today for Christmas dinner.  It was such a big hit. I made it exactly as written, except removing the foil the last 20 min & sprinkling additional cheese on top. It came out brown & crispy on top, creamy & delicious on the inside.  This is a real winner!!!  Thanks so much.

We added extra cheese and it was good.  The second time we made them we added ham.  They do seem a bit soupy when they are done, but if you have any leftovers you certainly need the extra liquid. All in all these were great!

I made this tonight and it was delicious. I also added sour cream to the sauce and used 12 ounces of Velveeta, as I did not have any cheddar. This one is definitely a keeper!

I made this recipe a couple of days ago largely because it didn't contain anything processed.  I also went into this knowing full well that there wasn't going to be anything "exciting" about this dish.  It is just plain humble fare.  This dish would pair well with something that does have a lot of flavor--ie) bbq'd meats or grilled veggies.

I followed the recipe exactly and added some chopped green onions in addition to the sliced onion to add some color and interest to the dish--they did lend a small bit of flavor in the end.  I cooked it in a glass casserole dish for 90 minutes as suggested and I found that all the fat had separated out of the dish and rose to the surface--Bonus!  I was able to spoon it all off very easily--there was AT LEAST a quarter cup of mostly saturated fat that we didn't have to eat!  

I mixed up everything afterwards and although I didn't much care for the bland flavors myself., my teen daughter seemed to enjoy its humbleness.  The recipe works well but it is exceptionally high in carbohydrates and saturated fat and as such, I would only serve it very rarely.

Excellent starter recipe. As mentioned before, saute some onions and garlic to place between layers of potatoes. A diced chipotle pepper and a little of the adobo sauce mixed in with the cheese mixture makes for a nice twist. The recipe as given is a keeper, though.

Everytime I make this recipe, I add something: hamburger meat, chicken, ham. I can make a meal of it in itself. Better than any Hamburger Helper, I can decide the amount of salt. It is also good alternitive to the traditional mashed potatoes you have with meals. A keeper in my family!

These were pretty good. Definitely creamy. Sauce set up nice and thick.  Made for just my husband and I (we don't have kids).  Will make again, when my niece and nephew are over,  I don't think they could object to anything in this dish as there are no strong flavor profiles...just a simple creamy potato dish, which they should like.  I would spice up some or use a stronger cheese if making again for just my husband and I.

Yum, yum and yum!!!  This was great! Hubby loved it too!  The only change I made was to the cheese.  I put in one cup of sharp chedder, and   one cup of horseradish chedder.  Definitely added to the flavor.  Since there are only two of us, we have been eating leftovers for 3 days, but neither one of us is tired of it yet!  Can't wait to make this again.

This was a great recipe! It was easy to follow. I added crumbled bacon with the onions, and substituted horseradish cheddar for about ¼ of the cheese. Everyone at the party raved, and there were no leftovers.

Excellent! I added more cheese like some of the other reviewers suggested and removed the foil for the last 15-20 minutes. 
A definite keeper.

This was a perfect au gratin! I took others' suggestions and sauteed the onions in butter and garlic, and used sharp cheddar. I was wondering whether the sharp cheese would be too tangy or take away from the creamy consistency, but the flavor was just right. And browning the dish in the last few minutes really helped the presentation (it doesn't look quite as appetizing otherwise). I'll definitely add this to my repertoire.

I had some left over par-boiled potatoes that I had used the previous day, so I used those & I only had to cook it in the oven for 35 min.  I also sauteed the onion w/ some garlic before I put it the potaoes, used more cheese than called for & took the foil off & let the cheese brown the last 10 min.  It turned out great & my boyfriend loved it.

I minced the onions as suggested and upped the cheese sauce by ½ and used a combination of swiss and cheddar.  We did like it but it burned a little on the bottom.  The next time, I'll try to microwave the potatoes first and reduce the cooking time.

I was disappointed with this recipe.  I pictured the potatoes being creamy and they weren't.  I added some crumbled bacon to the top after I took it out of the oven.  I would have only given 3 stars because it wasn't worth the effort to me, but I gave it 4 because my husband actually loved them.

Yummy!!!  The only changes I made to this recipe was to remove the foil the last 30 minutes of cooking to give the potatoes a nice crust and I cut them slightly thinner than called for.  Several people suggested sauteing the onions beforehand, but I feel this step is really unnecessary.  This is a fantastic sidedish that is super easy and very inexpensive to make.  Thank you so much Cathy.

This was good, but I had to add garlic salt for more flavor.  Maybe some other seasonings would do it well also.  To make sure it was done, I baked my dish at 350 for 2 hours instead of 1 1/2 hr.

This is a really good base recipe, but it needs a lot of work to be 5 stars.  I will make it again, but next time I will slice then quarter the potatoes, peel them, dice the onions (it was really awkard to have huge rings of onion in there) and I will add bacon for sure for more flavor.

Thanks for the recipe!  It certainly gives me something to play with.

WOW!  really good.  I used slightly less milk and a half cup more cheese.  Extra sharp cheddar is the key.   I added corn. Oh yes, I made this in the crockpot by slicing the potatoes and onions (sautee the onions first) and just let those cook in the crockpot.  thirty minutes before it is done add the cheese sauce and corn.

WOW!!!  I always found homemade AuGratin potatoes to be runny and bland but this recipe ROCKS!!  I layered the cheese sauce throughout the potatoes and onions and made three layers instead of the two mentioned in the recipe.  I had more cheese in my sauce because I just shredded a 8 oz block (looked to be 2-1/2 c. once shredded) but that was a good thing.  I also added some mustard powder and garlic powder (about 1 tsp. each) to the cheese sauce to bump up the flavor.  I suggest buttering you dish really well or maybe lowering the oven temp to 375 because the bottom of mine was burned.  I will definately be making these again and again and again!!!

These were so delicious.  A great addition to our Easter ham.  Very creamy.  Like other reviewers before, I chopped the onion.  Great balance of taste between the cheese and the onion.  A definite keeper.

I made this for Easter and it was a BIG hit.  I added some bacon and sauteed the onion and some garlic in a little of the bacon drippings.  I also added a bit of parsley flakes for color.  This dish was fantastic and so easy to make.  It is definitely on my "must have" list now.

Having never made scalloped potatoes before, the sheer number of excellent reviews of this recipe made me confident enough to serve them for Easter dinner to about 20 ppl. I increased the serving size.  I finely chopped the onions (insted of slicing into rings) and used a little less milk than called for, but still found I had at least 4 cups of sauce left over and the potatoes were already covered to the top. (Will have to remember not to fill the dishes as much next time, as the sauce boiled over the side, causing the smoke alarm to go off during our party!) I was really pleased with them.  Would probably remove the tin foil after an hour next time to brown the top. Loved the way the bottom and sides were browned - that's the best part.  Perfect traditional comfort food. And seemed even better reheated the next day.  Would love to try it sprinkled with green onions and crumbled bacon or maybe add a little garlic. I'm sure I will make this again many times.

So, It turns out that I just don't like scalloped potatos. I say that because I thought this recipe was kinda bla, but others at my table RAVED about it during the meal and in thank you notes afterwards. I used a mixture of cheeses (cheddar, montery jack, parm, and even a little cream cheese) - cooked it the day before (which was good, because the sauce bubbled over and made a giant mess) and simply reheated the next day. I woulld probably not make this again for me, but will have to the next time I have a dinner party!

Great basic recipe.  Although I added salt when preparing the dish, more needed to be added at the dinner table.  Also, the sauce was VERY thin.  I'm going to work on that next time.

This was simple to make and very yummy.  I omitted 1/2 cup of the cheese (for fat's sake), and it was still great.  I just needed to add quite a bit of salt.  I took others' advice and sauted onions with garlic (in olive oil) before adding it to the potatoes prior to baking.  I should have chopped the onions instead of leaving them in rings.  It made it a bit messy, but the texture was good.  My husband and I both enjoyed it, and it went great with our "Tangy Honey Glazed Ham" for Easter.  Thanks for this recipe!

This is awesome!!!  I also diced the onions and mixed them with the potatoes.  The last 15 minutes I added seasoned bread crumbs and removed the foil to get a crust on top.  The rest of the recipe I kept the same.  This will definitely be added as my "special" potato recipe.

These were really tasty!  I have to admit to making the box kind just because of time during the week, but I decided to make them special for Easter and was quite pleased.  The only changes I will make the next time I make them will be about 10 minutes before completion, I will pull off the foil and allow the cheese to get a little brown.  Otherwise, there really wasn't much about them not to like.  While not a quick potato and better left for a night that you have time to make them, they are worth the wait and nice to have with that special dinner :)

An excellent meal! As others did, I sauteed the onions in smaller bits before added to the dish. I also tossed in some honey smoked ham and some peas. My wife and I loved it and we're both somewhat picky eaters. The only two downsides to this recipe are thus: A. A 1 qrt dish really is not big enough for the ingredients. I ended up omitting half an onion and a whole potato and I still had sauce running right to the rim. B. The term comfort food is well applied. After eating this, you will be unable to move as you'll just want to sit happily stuffed in a comfy chair.

This was a hit at our house!  I didn't have russett potatoes on hand, so I used Yukon gold instead - since they were smaller, I used 8 of them and it was perfect!  Will definitely make this again and even for company!

So good.  I've never made au gratin potatoes before b/c I thought it would be too time consuming but not at all.  These were super easy and great.  Wouldn't change a thing.

I loved these potatoes !  I didn't have the sharp cheddar so I used Velveeta instead which worked perfectly.  They were mild and tasty and I will make them again -  many times ! They also worked well as a left over, microwaved - make a big batch and use them again.   Thank you for the recipe.

Wonderful! Love it! I added 3 extra potatoes, and placed in 9X13 glass baking dish. I also added ham to middle layer with onions! For last 15 mins w/ the foil off, I also added about 1/2 cups grated cheddar for the perfect touch! Thank you for the recipe! Our favorite now!

I made some changes: used a combination of cheddar and monterey jack cheeses; skipped the onions and added garlic powder and onion powder to both the potatoes and the cheese sauce.  I also used skim milk and it didn't detract from the cheese sauce at all.  Only cooked it for one hour covered, then about five minutes uncovered, and I let it cool for about 7-8 minutes before serving which made it "set up" and taste much better.  I also sliced the potatoes into 1/8 inch thick slices.  Overall, great recipe and hard to screw up.

This was really GREAT and super easy!!!! I am pregnant at this moment... and I add something to EVERYTHING depending on how I am feeling or what I am craving, so I didn't actually make this recipe completely the way it was written, I added curry spice to the milk/salt/butter/cheese part... and instead of actual onions, I used the green kind, and actually added chicken cut into strips so that it could be a complete meal, rather than a side. Oh, it was SO good!!!!

This was so tasty! Even my four-year-old who doesn't eat potatoes loved it (she didn't even notice the onions). I wanted more of the potatoes but made myself finish the pork chop I made to go along with it  :) Great recipe!

The potatoes tasted good, but the cooking time was way too long for me, and in results the potatoes burnt a bit. It didn't make much impression, sorry!

Very good. I used 1 cup shredded cheddar and 1/2 c. velveeta.  I really like a lot of pepper in this.  I think I will fry some onions and mix in at the end.  Either way it would be good.

The sauce smelled great and the consistency was prefect but it just didn't have enough flavor to me... seemed a bit bland.  Maybe I should've added more salt.

Well, I converted this recipie to 10 servings, and it was ok.  Next time I would use less milk, because the sauce was a little runny.  Also, I got a lot of oil pooling on top!  Next time I'll try a higher quality cheese than Kraft.  I would give this a 3, but my husband and guests loved it, so hence the 4.

Changed the recipe to 2 servings and this dish was ready in about 45 minutes. (It seems Allrecipes’ “Customize This Recipe” function will adjust the amounts of ingredients used in a recipe, but not the time it takes to cook.) Also removed the foil and added a little extra shredded cheddar during the last 15 minutes of cooking for a crunchy cheesy topping. Yum!

These were delicious! My daughter usually won't touch au gratin potatoes, but she actually asked when I'll make them again! Thank you!

Awesome recipe Cathy, thank you.  It was easy and for a change I used colby/montery jack cheese.  A favorite of my guys.

I didn't add the onion, and they still turned out super tasty.  I left them in the oven for about 2 hours.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is delicious. I assembled the layers of potatoes and onions as instructed, then stuck it in the microwave for about 7 minutes while I made the cheese sauce.  It was finished after 70 minutes in the oven. This was the only modification I made.  I did think it was really good, though next time I will add some garlic to give it more zing.

This was okay.  It would probably be a lot better if I wasn't in the-middle-of-nowhere-Japan and could get a hold of some decent cheddar cheese.  As is, it was pretty bland.

My husband thought this was great!  My children did not care for it beyond just a few bites. In order to make it less "fattening" I used cooking spray to grease the dish rather than the butter indicated, and used skim milk. I still thought it turned out good and will certainly make again. I do think it's quite a bit more than four servings though.

This was very good but its certainly not low cal, low fat or low carb! I was not sure whether to use salted or unsalted butter in the cheese mixture so I used Unsalted since the recipe called for adding salt later. It did seem to need more salt after it was cooked. I found that it was cooked within the time listed(though the prep time took longer for me) and I, too, removed the foil 15 minutes before the end. I also found it got a little brown on the bottom (Burnt?) but it was delicious nonetheless. I will definitely keep this recipe as I dont like boxed potatoes because you just don't know what you are getting in the powder mix. My fiance loved it despite the onions (he hates onions).

I had to cook them for 2 hours because they were not quite done after 1.5 hours. I took the foil off the last 15 min. to brown the top of them. The cheese was very creamy. Great recipe.

This was pretty good.  We had this for Christmas dinner with roast beef.  I used Yukon Gold potatoes.  I added garlic and pepper.  I didn't use as much onion and I cut the onion in half and then sliced it.  I added a little more cheese.  I used a mix of monterey cheese and sharp cheddar.  The time was right and I took the foil off for the last 15 minutes for it to brown on top.  I'd make this again.  Much better than the box version.

This is very easy to prepare and pretty basic comfort food.  I only used half an onion and found it to be enough.  Good recipe.  Will make again.

This recipe was great. My family usually makes mashed potatoes on Christmas. I offered to bring Au Gratin Potatoes. I had never made them before. I got the recipe from All-Recipe and they loved it. The cook time does take longer. I also doubled the recipe and cooked for about 2hrs and 15 mins. I will use again and again!  cbs

Pickey husband couldn't stop picking at more and more of this!!!  I used minced onions instead of real to make it more appealing to the family along with garlic seasoned salt and in the layers included some of the spiral sliced ham diced up which pushed this one completely over the top!

The recipe IS very easy...it just didn't have a lot of flavor, and I used sharp cheddar. I think it needs a little extra something to give it some zip. Over all it was a 3 star for me.

Great comfort food.  I like a touch of nutmeg and crushed red pepper flakes. I also minced & sauteed the onions with 2 gloves of garlic then added to cheese sauce. My husband says I can't make this enough...

Well I just got finished shoving the last forkful of this wonderful and easy recipe into my mouth and I all I can say is thank you.  I followed the recipe to a T perhaps using a bit of extra black pepper for taste and oh wow my wife and I have each had seconds and we never agree on food.  As for the time it takes I didn't mind at all I had an 1hr an a 1/2 to fix the rest of the dinner and help the kids with homework

These potatoes were the bomb! The only change I made was to saute a little fresh garlic in the melted butter. I really wasn't expecting to enjoy this dish as much as I did. It seems so simple and straight forward. The simple and straight forward dishes are usually the best though. My family thanks you Cathy.

OHMIGOSH!  We loved this (myself, husband and 3 yr old son).  I will absolutely make this again.  I used 1 & 1/2 cups milk and 2 & 1/2 cups cheese (mix of sharp cheddar and mozzarella).  Forgot to saute garlic w/butter, so I just sprinkled potatoe slices w/garlic powder.  Was delicious and easy to prepare.  Only drawback is that you need min. of 1 hour to bake, so you can't rush it.  Otherwise, FABULOUS!

My husband hates onions so I left them out, thinking this would make it bland I was pleasantly surprised how delicious it turned out.  And my husband and I loved every bite of it.

Very good recipe!  My husband LOVED it!  I omitted the onions and used more cheese then was called for!  But very good!

I make these all the time--they are my husbands favorite. I only make a few changes.... first I add a two cloves of crushed garlic (we love it) and add a little more cheese than called for. I often use tillamook extra sharp white cheddar. It's amazing.

I made double this recipe and took to a family reunion.  Everyone loved it, and it was gone quickly.  The only thing I did differently was omit the onions since I didn't have any on hand.

We loved this recipe!  It was creamy and cheesy and much better than the boxed version.  Instead of the onion, I used 1 teaspoon onion powder and added 1/8 teaspoon of cayenne pepper and 1/2 teaspoon of dry ground mustard.  I used the shredded 4 cheese "Classic Melts".  This has got to be a 5 star recipe.

My husband loved these potatoes.  However, I though this recipe was just ok, not great.  Like others, I found it to be too bland...but with just a few improvements--a mixture of different cheeses, perhaps some garlic--it could easily be 5 stars.  I will probably make this again but with the changes.

This is a great recipe, I've been making it for years.  Only difference is I boil the milk first for about twenty minutes with half an onion that's studded with cloves (don't put any onion in with the potatoes) and then make the sauce, which I also season with white pepper (black is great, too).  This isn't THE best recipe out there, once I made a recipe that was to die for but then I lost it.  But this one is good, too.

I have never had Au Gratin Potatoes. When I came across this recipe it sounded good so I thought I would give it a try. Boy am I glad I did. I loved this dish. My husband and 7 year old daughter both really enjoyed also. My husband grilled some chicken and we used this for our side. My husband said it was as good as a reasturant.

I thought the texture of this dish was very nice, but the flavor was bland.  I would suggest adding garlic and thyme to kick it up a bit.

These were *good* ~ not great, though. They were rather liquidy and quite oily, in my opinion. My husband, however, loved them! I don't think I'll make these again ~ gotta search for the *perfect* recipe!

Very easy to make. In the future I would like to try different cheeses (I used med. cheddar). My husband loved the onions and I am not a huge onion fan so in the future I will try green onions instead.

I was disappointed when I made this.  It was cheesy, but almost too much so.  I would like to experiment with using green onions instead and swapping some sour cream for some of the cheese.  It was a bit too rich.

Fabulous!  I did preboil the potatoes but only cook for 5 minutes - I cooked mine too long and they were more mashed then scalloped but they tasted great anyways!  I did add 1/4 tsp of Tabasco Sauce to the mix to give it a bit more flavor.  Everyone loved it, will make again!

I followed the recipe apart from the fact that I did not have cheddar, I used Edam and a small amount of parmasan instead. I took it out of the oven after 1hour 15min and took the foil off. The potoatos on the top were perfect. I then for the last few minutes topped it off with crunched up taco shells. The dish was perfect. It went really well with the grilled white fish we had. I will definitly do this again. Next time with more onion. It could take it no problem.

I really love this recipe!  It is a Christmas tradition, that I make with the "Awesome Slow Cooker Pot Roast" found on this site.  I like to add extra cheese (I am a cheese freak), but the sauce is slightly grainy if you add too much cheese.  It is stunningly delicious and flavorful, but I chop the onions finely rather then have rings, so there is the flavor without so much onion texture.  I highly recommend trying this!

The best tasting au gratin potatoes I've tasted.  And so easy.  I always add more cheese than a recipe calls for but I'm sure if you follow the recipe exactly everyone will love it.  I did not have any leftovers.

This recipe was a huge hit at Christmas dinner.  I did chop the onion as recommended by others.  Added a dash of ground red pepper and some garlic powder to the cream sauce prior to adding the sharp cheddar.  Delicious!  My husband is still asking for more....

Great recipe!  Easy to follow and turned out awsome.  Even my "picky" eaters loved it!  We used sharp cheddar and it was perfect!!

This recipe was just ok.  Pretty bland, if I make it again I'll definitely add more cheese, seasoned salt and pepper.

This recipe was fantastic.  I did not put in the onions and I used Asiago(like parmesan) instead of cheddar.  Turned out delicious.

Also with this recipe (or simular ones) you can also add sliced (not frozen) ham into the mixture.  I have found that you have to bake it a little longer- like 5-15 min. Try it!

Hands down the best au gratin potato recipe I've found.  Yes, the potatoes get brown on the bottom, but my family loves them that way.  The only change I make is I use minced onions instead of rings.  Great recipe!

I've made this a couple of times now and it was a hit at Easter dinner.  I chop the onion finely instead of slicing it to make it more kid friendly and I grated another cup of cheese to top the dish.   The first time I made it I used up all the bits of cheese in my refridgerator so it had swiss and jack as well cheddar.  Either way it was delicious.

I was really happy to find this recipe!  I had never made au gratin potatoes before and was very pleased with the way these came out.  It was just what I was looking for.  I sauteed the onions in butter before adding them and used skim milk and sharp cheddar cheese.  I was afraid it would be too runny with the milk difference but it turned out great.  I really liked it with the sharp cheese, it has a great flavor.  I can't wait to make this for guests!  Thanks again.

I cannot rave enough about this recipe.  The flavor is great, with just the right balance of creamy sauce and vegetables.  It really is easy - there is no excuse to make au gratin potatoes from a box.  I used 1% milk and reduced-fat shredded cheddar, and it still had excellent taste and texture.

Very good.  I liked this recipe more than other
au gratins I've tried because it did not have too much cheese in it - you could taste the potatoes too!  I will cut down on the butter and milk next time - may be in half because it had a lot of liquid so I had to scoop out the potatoes.

This is very good though I, like many others, made some changes.  I used six rather small, regular potatoes (which I had on hand) and extra-sharp cheddar, an eight-ounce brick (about 3 cups), which I shredded myself.  Also, I used 2% milk because that's what I had (about 1 3/4 cups) and the rest half-and-half.  And I added imitation bacon bits and paprika to the top of the casserole.  I also meant to use some sauteed garlic (two or three cloves) between the layers and in the sauce, but I forgot.  The dish cooked quickly, in a little over an hour (at around 350 because I had a ham in the same oven), there was just the right amount of sauce, and it looked great.  I agree that this recipe needs to be punched up a little, but it's a fine basis.

We all loved this dish.  With our food processor, cutting the potatoes was a breeze.  I kind of did my own thing since I needed more potatoes and then didn't have enough cheese to double it.  That's OK, it was still fantastic.  I used a cheddar jack and then added some colby jack to it.  Great combo.  It appeared as though I was burning the bottom but that was the part we fought over.  It was yummy!

This recipe was easy,and delicious.  My husband said it was the best he ever had.  It was thick and cheesy.  Make sure you thicken the milk enough.  Add other cheesses to it also.  Great recipe.

The recipe provided was pretty good the first time I had it but I thought it could use some improvement. The second time I made it, I layered the dish with potato slices, finely chopped onion, ham cubes, salt & pepper. I added 2 cloves of fresh chopped garlic to the sauce along with extra cheddar cheese, mozzarella, and fresh parmesan. Before placing into the oven, I sprinkled more parmesan over the top. Remove the cover for the last 30 minutes. Yummy!!!

These were pretty good.  Reminded us more of a potato soup than a gratin.  next time i'll stick it under the broiler for a few minutes to brown the top.

This would have been a five star if I had used sharp cheddar.  Colby just doesn't have enough flavor for us.  When I make again, I'll use sharp cheese and more of it, too.

This had a good flavor.  I added broccoli.  The only problem was that the pan was entirely too small.  It was a big mess.  Overall a good, easy recipe.

I only gave this 3 stars because after reading the reviews I made some changes.  I used 4 tablespoons of flour, 1 teaspoon of garlic salt, and sprinkled in some cayenne.  Also, I used sharp cheddar.

It was very tasty. Made it just as given. I only found the sauce a little more than required. Next time I shall reduce the quantity of sauce. The roux was the best I ever made though. Excellent recipe.

I absolutely love this recipe!  Every time I make this dish for someone, they can't believe how good it is.  I can't wait to have other people try it on this Thanksgiving.  For anyone who's hesitant to try this recipe because it takes a long time to make, it's totally worth it!

Very nice. I added more cheese on the top. The onions are a good touch. I also add fresh ground mace (about 1/4 tsp to taste) to the cheese sauce.I have made it twice and will again.

This recipe was okay.  I hate onions, so I added lots of roasted garlic as well as swiss and gruyere cheese for an added kick.  Even with the additions, I found it slightly bland tasting.  My boyfriend raved about it, though and wants me to make the dish again.  Yet another case of varying tastes...

i thought this was really wonderful.  next time i would make it in a bigger dish though because a 1 quart casserole dish turned out to be a little to small...

Big hit at Easter dinner!  We found after experimenting with the recipe (didn't want to make it for the first time for company) that sharp cheddar works well.  Very easy to prepare and re-heats well, too.

The cheese bubbled over and made a mess in my oven.  I ended up finishing it in the microwave, then browning it for a few minutes under the broiler.  I recommend microwaving for a quicker dish and using a larger casserole than indicated.

Just not impressed with it. Flavor was bland, maybe I'll give it one more shot with different cheese.

This is a great recipe for au gratin potatoes.  I'ts good with steak and a salad.  I've made this with sharp cheddar cheese, too.

This is the a wonderful recipe.  I love the creaminess of the potatoes and cheese.  My husband and daughter absolutely loved it.  I used only 2 large potatoes in this recipes and it turned out great.  Also, I baked uncovered for 10 minutes.  Enjoy eating this dish; I know I will be making it quite often.

So much easier to prepare than other 'au gratin' potatoes! And the taste is still
great - even if you forget to cover the dish with aluminium foil and bake it for only
one hour... The cheese sauce does the trick!

Great recipe.I diced the onions-doubled this for a big family dinner and it was all gone. I did add a little more flour to thicken the sauce. Will make again. Very good!

This is a really great recipe. The thickness of potatoe slices gives this dish a nice change of texture.  Although, I wasn't thrilled with the rings of onions, I think I will dice them in next time, as well as reducing the amount.  I also added more potatoes and removed the aluminum to give it a nice browning the last 15 minutes. Terrific aroma!

Excellent! Simple to make, wonderful creamy cheese sauce, and everyone loved it! I've made this several times, good with broccoli but I preferred onion. I will make this one again and again! Thanks Cathy

Wow, what can I say?  It was delicious; I would highly recommend this dish to anyone who loves creamy cheesy stuff!  The cooking time is a little trying (especially with the aroma drifting throughout the house), but, in the end, very well worth the wait.

This was very good, but next time I may parboil the potatoes. For some reason they did not cook in the time alloted. I also took up the suggestions to add extra cheese and fresh minced garlic...yummm!
