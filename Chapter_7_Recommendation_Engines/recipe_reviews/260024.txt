DELICIOUS.  Everyone loved it and the only change I made was to take the drained eggplant, brush it on both sides with olive oil, and bake it in a 350 degree oven for about 30 minutes instead of frying it.  This dish takes time to make but it is amazing.

Instead of frying, I baked it in a 350 oven for about half an hour. I lightly brushed it with EVOO before baking. Delicious!

This recipe was so delicious and surprisingly easy to make. I didn’t change a thing except I only had dried basil which I used by eye balling.  It tasted better than that famous Italian restaurant chain!  My meat lover husband said this is a keeper!

I brushed the eggplant with olive oil, sprinkled some Italian seasoning on both sides, and baked it for 30 mins (rather than frying it) on parchment paper to save some calories.  Then followed the rest of the recipe--it's a winner!

This would be 5 stars if the eggplant was dredged in flour (or corn starch), dipped in egg, then coated in bread crumbs before pan frying.
