I am from Maryland, born and bred. This is the way to make crab cakes except they are typically fried in a lot of hot oil or broiled. Of course, the essential ingredient in this recipe is the crab meat followed closely by authentic Old Bay. The crab should be blue crab from the Chesapeake Bay region, Florida, Louisiana or other Gulf of Mexico states.  I live near Atlanta now and there is only one place to get great crab. Believe it or not, the alternative is Paramount Preserve Premium Lump Crabmeat from Sam's Club. This company is headquartered in my old stomping grounds of Glen Burnie, Maryland. The crab comes from the west coast of Mexico. It is not blue crab but is very, very close. Much better than crab from Asia packaged by Phillips (a Maryland company) and others. I mix the ingredients then refrigerate for a couple of hours when there is time. It is a good idea to refrigerate the crab cakes after they are formed for 30+ minutes but it is not crucial. It helps them stay together in the pan. Enjoy this recipe from the Land of Pleasant Living!

Tasty! I like my crab cakes with more meat than filler and this has lots of meat and great flavor.

Waaay too salty. I added the full amount of old bay and a little sprinkle of  salt. I thought it'd be okay based on previous reviews because we like things a bit salty but wow,  they weren't kidding.  Since the description says that healthy dose of seafood seasoning I can't really complain but to those making this recipe,  take caution.  I'm sad because otherwise the recipe would have been excellent. I'll try again with less old bay and no added salt. I also baked for 15 minutes and broiled for 10 to get top crispy. Made 6 nice sized cakes.

Seriously, do NOT put this much Old Bay in your crab cakes - it ruined the $19 of crabmeat I bought! The rest of the recipe was ok. I pan fried in a little butter, rather than bake, but either way would be fine. This Marylander is deleting this recipe asap!

Way too salty. We could even eat them. We had to throw all of the crab cakes away. I may try to make these again and use 1tsp Old Bay instead of 1 1/2 tablespoons.

These were amazing. I enjoyed that they're baked. I did double the amount of lemon and seafood seasoning. Absolutely delicious and easy to make.

Very good recipe, mostly meat with not a lot of fillers!  Way too salty for my liking; next time I would cut the Old Bay seasoning in half and possibly omit the extra salt to taste.  Maybe the Old Bay was supposed to by 1 1/2 teaspoons not Tablespoons? I will be making these again and hopefully find the right amount of saltiness. Thanks for the recipe!

I made no changes. These were so simple and delicious. I agree with another review of putting too much old bay in. They we r e a tad bit on salty side. I took the leftovers and made an alfredo. The seasoning was so good. I didn't need to change it. Tasted similar to Olive Gardens.

I have tried several crab cakes recipes and this is the best by far. Easy to make and tasty. I did make double and added a bit of worcestershire sauce. My family loved it.

These were very good, I think I may have put too much Old Bay Seasoning though.  They tasted a bit on the salty side. I will definitely be making these again, and maybe cut back the Old Bay to one tablespoon.

Awesome!!!!  This was the first time I have ever made crab cakes and it was a big hit!!!!!  I did have trouble making the patties stay together but I managed to make it work. I doubled the recipe and had friends over, they were impressed and everyone loved them!!!!
