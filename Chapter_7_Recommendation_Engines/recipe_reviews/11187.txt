These are really good butter cookies and the icing really compliments them. But I think there is a typo in the description. These make really good cookies cut-outs. The shapes stay the same and the cookies do not change size when baking so you can cram a whole bunch on the cookie sheet. But it does not hold a STAMP well. I will make these every Christmas!

This the 2nd year that I have made these cookies.  They are just great.  I double the recipe and roll them into balls, flatten them and sprinkle them with colored sugar.
They are the best tea/christmas cookies.  We love them!!!

Great cookies! Perfect butter cookies with just the right mild buttery flavor, especially if using frosting. But they're good alone as well, and not bland at all! This recipe is a keeper.    I also switched vanilla for the almond (nut allergies in the family).   Doubled the recipe and made cut out hearts for Valentine's Day. They held their shape beautifully. I did have to bake them quite a bit longer though, almost 20 min, in order to get them lightly golden around the bottom edge.

Okay, we just finished making these and my husband said I owe him two sticks of butter.  These were very bland. Not enough sugar or extract.  I know you can add to this, looks like most people added sugar or something.  But at least these should TASTE good all by themselves, and sadly....they don't.  They don't cut out well and we ended up using a press to shape and cut with a knife.  Very disappointing.

This was my first time making butter cookies and wanted a fun Christmas Day activity to do with my boys. I doubled the recipe but followed the recipe exactly as is. To my dismay I didn't have access to a mixer so I attempted to make them entirely by hand. From creaming the butter to mixing in the flour it was definitely work. Following the baking time as listed yielded cookies slightly too doughy for my taste, so I up-ed the baking time to get the crunch/softness that I preferred. The flavor was tasty and subtle - perfect for icing. I will make again & again in the future... but definitely with a mixer.

I added some flaked coconut and vanilla essence, and a teeny bit more flour. The cookies came out excellent, and I ate 3 straight away.

This was the first time I made butter cookies with my kids. They were Great! Not to sweet and just the right amount of butter flavor. I let my kids cut out stars for the holidays and decorate them. Easy! I will make them again and again and again.

I loved these cookies. They are not too sweet so they taste great with icing and marachino cherries on top.

I just made theses cookies today. This is a good base recipe. I added about 1/4 of a cup more sugar, and an extra teaspoon of almond extract. I pressed them with a potato masher (to give then a cute pattern) then put 1/8 of a teaspoon sugar on top of each, before baking. 
I think they turned out great this way. 

I also tried to make choclate chip, wallnut cookies with this recipe....
That did not turn out so well, they wouldnt cook in the middle or get brown. Also they tasted sadly bland, these are good butter cookies, but don't add any fillers it will be a disapointment.

I have made this recipe for holidays for a couple years now. I also make it as a special treat for my husband, he LOVES these cookies, calling them the best he has ever had. I follow the recipe exactly and they keep perfect shape while baking making them easy to decorate afterwards. These are loved in my home!!

These are ok. My children liked them. They are good but would be better with a cookie press as the dough is super soft.

I tasted the dough before refrigerating it, and I then added a little more almond flavoring.  It was better with that but was still lacking a little in sweetness for my tastes.  I added a little frosting that I had on hand to make it sweeter.  I appreciate that probably people who don't have sweet teeth like I do would like this more than I did.  Thanks, though, because I know that there is always something out there for every type of taste!

It was very bland, and it was for a class grade, which will most likely not benefit us because of how tasteless they were. Could have had more sugar, and not many people in our class seemed to care for them and neither did we.

With an added teaspoon of cinnamon and a drizzle of melted chocolate chips, these taste almost like a cappuccino.

I thought these were really good, a little tricky for me as I didn’t have a mixer. Not too sweet, they seem like a perfect addition to coffee or tea. Will probably be making again (once I get a mixer). :)
