This was good, but very mild flavored.  The quality of the balsamic vinegar drizzle makes a huge difference!  (More for the money is NOT better when it comes to a quality, aged balsamic!)  I think the next time I would add oregano or thyme to further enhance the flavors.  This recipe is a great springboard on which to build.  Serve with a green salad. 
 Thanks for sharing.

The feta overwhelmed the other flavors. I will not make this again but if I was going to I would use goat cheese or brie, and bacon instead off prosciutto.

This was great!  We added a sprinkle of Parmesan as well.
