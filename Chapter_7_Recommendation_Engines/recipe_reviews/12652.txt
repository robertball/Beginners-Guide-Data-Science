i eat a lot of melon and thought it would be a good way to use the rind.  this is definitely different and not bad.  you have to like a crunchy type pie with the rind, nuts, and dried cranberries.  flavor is good, just didn't care for the texture. i would chop the rind even smaller and less nuts if i made it again.

This pie reminds me of a meatless mincemeat pie, taste and texture is almost identical.  I'm not a huge fan of mincemeat unless it's chopped real fine.  If I ever made it again, I would definetely chop it up alot smaller and cook the rind alot longer.  Taste test the rind, to see if it's to your liking.  I think it might be even better if the skin was peeled off too.

This was just not to my liking, mainly because I don't like this kind of pie. It would be great in Fall (I made it in August), and is a great way to use up watermelon rind. In my family we eat up a lot of watermelon. I would recommend it if you liked fruitcake. That is what it reminded me of.
