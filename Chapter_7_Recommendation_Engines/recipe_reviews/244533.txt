These waffles are so easy to put together and DELICIOUS, but I wouldn't mistake them for funnel cakes, IMO. I did wish they were a bit crispier on the outside, but the flavor more than makes up for that. I did check the original recipe from the submitter's personal file, and I noticed that she listed oil in the ingredients, but butter in the directions, so I'm wondering if you were to use oil in the batter if that would make them crispier? Also, keep an eye on them, as they did not take 10 minutes to cook. In any case, the family LOVED these and I will def be making them again~YUM!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is a good recipe, takes some planning ahead, but the kids enjoyed them.  The best part is how crispy the outside of the waffle got.  This recipe makes A LOT- approx. ten full sized waffles.

We really liked theses waffles! the only changes I made were to reduce the butter and sugar by half. Then I had to add almost 1/2 c more  water in order to make it thin enough for the waffle iron. The cooking time is way too long - makes them really crunchy. The last couple I only cooked for a few minutes, and we liked them better. I got 26 waffle squares out of these recipe

Very good waffles! They are exactly like they say.. light and crispy. Not overly sweet and I found it to be perfect. Served with strawberry compote and cool whip.  Followed recipe as written.
