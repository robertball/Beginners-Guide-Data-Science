This is the best cornbread! I did make a few additions. I made the cornbread as directed, omitting the pimentos, and I added a 1/2 can of creamed corn and a can of diced rosted chilis (mild ones). 
I poured half of the batter in a 9 X 9 pan, put a layer of shreadded cheese and about half a lb of cooked sasuage. Poured the rest of the batter on top and sprinkled with alittle more shredded cheese. Cooked it at 425 for 25 minutes, and was it YUM!!

Excellent, moist cornbread. I used plain yogurt in place of the sour cream and it worked perfectly.

If you like a cakey cornbread ,this is an excellent recipe.  I'm not too crazy about the overall texture, but that can easily be fixed by changing the proportion of cornmeal to flour (or even substituting masa harina for the flour). Also I needed to add more liquid to my mixture.  I actually ended up using this recipe for the Corn Dog Muffins on this site.  I omitted the pimentos and substituted onion salt for onion powder.  I really liked this recipe alot, but as I mentioned before I will add more cornmeal and less flour next time I make it...and there will certainly be a next time.

I have been looking for this! This recipe is quite versatile. Omit the onion and pimentos and add an extra T of sugar and you have a great sweet cornbread that is moist and delicious! Thanks for this one; it is a keeper!

Oh Yes! This is fabulous! I omit the onion and pimento because I like to mix honey and butter and serve it along side.

Very moist - served it with chili and it was delish.  Based on the reviews I adjusted the flour to 3/4 cup and the corn meal to 1 1/4 cup and omitted the pimientos and onion.  Will definitely make again.  It's also a good recipe to make with kids - my 8 year old helped; not a lot of ingredients and easy to measure.

Great cornbread!  I added a couple of chopped jalapeno peppers, 1/2 cup of fresh corn kernels, and some shredded cheddar cheese.  Delicious!  My husband said it was the best cornbread he's ever had.

Moist and delicious.  I added a little frozen corn to give it extra texture - and put a some grated cheese on top after I took it out of the oven.

Other than doubling the sugar (we like it sweet), I followed the recipe.  As soon as it came out of the oven, I put a Tbsp or two of butter over the top and let it melt.  This is a keeper! Thanks for sharing the recipe!!

Good dense cornbread. Didn't use pimientos & couldn't taste the onion at all. Will add more if making again.

Beautiful, moist cornbread. I didn't add the pimentos or onion and the flavor was quite plain tasting - next time I was thinking of adding some cheddar cheese for more flavor.  Thank you!

Very Good!  My husband loves it but being from the south he wants to have it cold with his buttermilk so I do leave out the onions and pimentos. We both enjoy it so thank you.

Delicious and super-easy! I skipped the pimentos and added a bit more onion and a dash of garlic powder. Hubby like it so much he says I can make it everyday if I want. Nice to hear from the other reviewers how versatile it is, for more savory or more sweet versions. This one is more than just a keeper - it may become a staple around here, especially since it converted into gluten-free really easy.  All I had to do was sub in the rice flour instead of all-purpose, and increase the milk from 1/3 cup to 1/2 cup.

I left out the pimento and onion, and now I am wishing I had left them in, because it was a little bland.  However, even though I overmixed the batter, it still came out moist and with a good texture.

Omitted pimentos and substituted dried minced onion for onion salt. 

Perfectly light and fluffy, great mild flavor that paired beautifully with taco soup-would be great with chili too!

I made this and omitted the pimentos and onions because I didn't have any on hand.  I added some shredded cheddar cheese, 1/2 cup of frozen corn (defrosted), chopped fresh chives and a pinch of red pepper flakes.  I found the overall texture to be denser than I prefer and I'm not sure if it's because of the changes I made.  Still, I found myself eating and eating and eating this... I guess it grew on me!

I like my corn bread sweeter and with more cornmeal.  This is more of a savory corn bread recipe.  I didn't use the pimento or minced onion.
This is more cake-like, maybe i will use less flour, mor cornmeal and more sugar with this recipe.
UPDATE:  I didn't want to waste this cornbread... So, the next day I made a sweet cornbread pudding and the sour cream cornbread was perfect for it!  I'm not a big bread pudding person, but this recipe was really yummy and drizzle honey or agave nectar when you serve it!  Here is the site that i found the recipe on http://www.examiner.com/cooking-in-houston/sweet-cornbread-pudding-thanksgiving-dessert-recipe

Super moist and yummy! I substitued the pimientos with diced green chilies and substituted the minced onion with about 1 cup of sauteed fresh corn and diced yellow onion. Cornbread tasted best after it cooled slightly. This was excellent served with chicken tortilla soup.

I made this to get some sour cream used up, and at first, thought it wasn't too bad...different... my husband did not like it at all, which left me to eat the rest of it myself, and that turned into a chore! I won't be making this one again.

Moist, tender corn bread.  I did not add pimento and onion but would have been good in this savory bread.  Or corn and hot peppers.  I will make this again.

I liked this cornbread better the next day, since the flavors seem to have mellowed and melded better. I used crumbled bacon, rather than pimento. I do like the texture -- again, better the next day. I prefer sweeter cornbread, since I like it with honey. Good, but I'd probably use less sour cream, if I made it again, and increase the milk.  I DID add about 1/4 cup extra milk, since the mixture seemed dry. The rest of the family didn't care for this one.

This is fabulous corn bread! I added a handful of frozen corn kernals for extra texture..yummy. I didn't have pimientos or dried onions so I omitted that part...I'm sure it would be great whatever you throw in there!

Wonderful cornbread! I added an extra tablespoon of sugar and about 1/4 cup more milk. I also omitted the pimientos and onion. Like another reviewer wrote, I served it with butter and honey mixed.

Solid, simple recipe.  Good for using what is often at hand.    Texture is pretty dense.  I prefer lighter.  It's also not as sweet as I am used to.

This is a nice, moist corn cake. The texture isn't quite what I think of when I want cornbread, but it's good even so. I actually forgot the salt entirely somehow, guess I spaced on that, and it was still tasty served with "Black Bean and Salsa Soup" from this site. Mine came out a little pale because I used a glass baking dish and thus had to drop the temp by 25 degrees--that's not the fault of the recipe and didn't adversely affect the flavor at all. We did like this however I probably won't make it again as I can think of other things I'd rather do with sour cream as a general rule, because "Homesteader Cornbread" is still my favorite :) Thanks for the recipe, as always it's fun to try something new :)

I increased sugar to 1/4 cup because we like a sweeter cornbread. It was moist. Good recipe.

Terrific! I only had 4 oz of sour cream and made the recipe with more oil and milk.  Remember to have a batter the consistency of pancake batter than cake batter and you'll be fine.

I made these into muffins, because I thought the kids would like them that way. I left out the pimentos and minced onion. These were great and not that much more effort than the boxed corn muffins.

What a wonderful recipe!  I omitted the pimentos, and added some diced green chile (a small can, drained) and 1/2 cup canned corn kernels (I smashed them up a bit, because I wanted to use creamed corn per another reviewers suggestion, but didn't have any).  I poured half of the mixture into the baking dish, layered some shredded cheddar cheese and topped with the remaining mixture.  It cooked up perfectly and is delicious!  Thank you for sharing!!!

nice texture, but unless you get a bite with a pimiento there is no flavor.
