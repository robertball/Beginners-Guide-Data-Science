I have made this twice now - second time with some changes that were recommened in previous reviews. (1) Re: the flour.  Just lightly dust chicken in flour seasoned w/ salt & pepper.  No specific amt - just what it takes to dust chicken. Fry in some butter & olive oil and put aside. Then gently fry the mushrooms and garlic- adding a tad more olive oil and butter and, yes, I added about 7 chopped garlic cloves.  This mixture can be put in the frig until your ready to make the gravy!   (2) Re: the gravy - the receipe uses waaaaaaaay to much flour - which is why others had to add more beef stock and Marsala.  You only need 2T. flour to each 1 cup liquid - so base your broth & wine accordingly (more gravy requires more flour and liquid). AND, 2T flour requires 2T of fat (butter/oil combo).  Once the flour has been blended into the fat over low heat, stir until smooth and bubby - add liquid, salt and pepper to taste, stirring constantly.  I did NOT use any browning liquid. Add chicken/mushrooms/ garlic, cover and put in 350 oven for 25 minutes! Your company can be eating their salad during this time. Delicious!!!!! Need more spices - just add what you like.  I took the suggestion of adding basil.
3: Some also said the entree was bland - I took the suggestion of soaking the thin spaghetti noodles in the spice/oil/water combo prior to boiling - FANTASTIC!
The nice thing with this dish is that most can be made ahead - as the restaurants do! This is a keeper for me since we do a lot o

I loved this recipe but after reading all the reviews I "tweaked" it a little. I used 6 garlic cloves and 2/3 cup marsala wine. I know that sounds like a lot but we like garlic and it made it absolutely wonderful.

I made a number of changes most significantly with the cooking method and ultimately was left with just a fabulous superior dish 5-star quality being an understatement. I did not use chicken only because I had pork tenderloin to cook tonight. This recipe is suitable for either and whether you use chicken or pork tenderloin both are lean tender meats that require brief cooking. I saw no need then to bake this and I didn t. I sautéed the sliced Portobello mushrooms in olive oil. I removed them from the pan added a little more olive oil and butter and BRIEFLY cooked the flour/salt/pepper dredged meat a few minutes on each side. (I cut the pork tenderloin into medallions) I removed the meat from the pan and kept it warm while I made the sauce: I again added a little more olive oil and butter to the pan and BRIEFLY cooked the garlic before deglazing the pan with the marsala then added a slurry made with a SMALL amount of flour and beef broth. Browning sauce was not necessary (see my posted photo). I served this over spaghettini with garlic butter and olive oil. The meat was moist and tender the sauce rich and flavorful the Portobello mushrooms the perfect complement to both just a beautiful dish. I rate this 4 stars rather than 5 because in my opinion the large amount of flour called for is not only unnecessary but excessive olive oil is more appropriate for this dish than vegetable oil browning sauce is not necessary nor is the baking step.

AMAZING! I omitted the browning sauce and I browned garlic cloves with the mushrooms (like 7-10 cloves). I also use cooking marsala wine...and anyway it's simply FABULOUS I'm addicted to Macaroni Grill's Chicken Marsala and this is the ONLY recipe I've found that even comes close. I also substituted White mushrooms instead of portobello ones and didn't even notice any flavor difference!

I made this just as listed except I did not have any browning liquid so I used a dash of Worcestershire sauce. The chicken tasted like it came from a restaurant. Very good.

It looked fantastic and the sauce had a nice consistency but it was a little on the bland side. I would make again but add more marsala wine and other spices.

I "LOVED" this recipe. It was easy to make and was a huge hit at my party. The only confusing part was the flour so what I did was use half for the sauce and half for the chicken.

If I can make this anyone can. Not only was this easy it was Delicious! It tasted like the one at Macaroni Grill Restaurant. The only thing I did not like about the recipe was about the Flour part. It states you will need cup of flour divided. Not sure what that meant. I had flour left over. Other then that this recipe ROCKS! YUMMY! I ve passed this recipe to all my friends.

Just finished dinner and this dish is phenomenal! Made it just as written. Would not change a thing. It is going to be only an occasional dish as it is far from low cal. I have been looking for a good marsala sauce for a long time and honestly this is the best I have found so far. Served ours over homemade mashed potatoes. Thanks for sharing.

I REALLY wanted to LOVE this receipe, but I can only say that to me, it's just "ok."  I keep eating it thinking that something was missing, I just couldn't tell what. I would try this recipe again and perhaps use a bit more marsala wine.  The overall flavor of the dish just wasn't as robust and I hoped it would be.  I think it's because I'm comparing it to the chicken marsala that I do love at the Cheeskecake Factory.  The other thing I don't like about this recipe is the instructions for the flour.  Yeah, it tells you to have flour on hand, divided, but when it tells you to add flour to the sauce, it doesn't tell you how much to add.  I just had to wing it.  I didn't like that.  Other than that funky quirk, it's an easy recipe to follow and produces a nice, rich sauce.  I doubled up the sauce recipe thinking I'd need more, but I didn't have to.  Again, decent recipe, but didn't have that robust taste I was hoping for.

This is a very tasty dish but like the others said I think there is to much flour. I had to add a bit of water and more beef broth but it turned out great. Thanks for the recipe:)

I thought this was great! I didn't have any beef broth on hand so I used beef bullion instead. Also used 2 mushroom caps instead of 4. Great flavor will definitely make again!

I thought this recipe was awesome! I'm new to cooking with red and white wines so this was a nice springboard for me. Sadly the man I cook for isn't into mushrooms (he has simple taste buds) so I ended up swapping them out for broccoli (his favorite) and it still tasted great. I did take a few suggestions from other people who suggested adding seasonings and more Marsala wine. I sprinkled some Oregano and added a dash of Basil to the sauce after adding the broccoli. I served it on top of thin spaghetti noodles which were soaked and boiled in water with basil oregano pepper a little salt onion powder olive oil small slice of butter and some Thyme. I think the seasoned noodles complimented the dish well. Like most of my sauces I still had difficulty making it thicken. But that's me not the recipe. _ Thanks for posting this! I really appreciate it! My boyfriend loved it and I can't wait to share it with his family. Thanks again!

This is the best Chicken Marsala I have ever tasted. My entire family loves this recipe. I would suggest trying Wild Pheasant breasts in place of chicken breast you will be equally pleased with this recipe. I also on occasion use baby bella mushrooms they are more mild and my husband does not like Portobello mushrooms and the baby bellas are a hit. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

This is a really great recipe but I had to tweak it a bit to my family's liking. We love Macaroni Grill's version and this was close. I ended up doubling the amount of boullion and Marsala (sauce was too thick and to make more sauce) and browned about 12 garlic gloves some sliced some whole (they way they do at the Grill). When I tasted the sauce it was missing something. I added about 3 T of honey to sweeten it up a bit it worked! Family loved it. Also to speed things up I was browning the chicken while cooking the sauce.

I made this recipe last night and my husband and I loved it! I will say the browning sauce was hard to find (because it didn't clearly state what it was). The flour totally threw me off like most. At first I ended up with a mashed potatoes lokking flour mess. I had to go back to the grocery store and buy more flour broth & garlic (because I had just enough for one time). I didn't use Kosher salt. I used Lawry's instead (sparingly so it wouldn't make it to salty). I used it with egg noodles and a salad! Marvelous with a little tweaking!

This is absolutley delicious. I gave it 4 stars because I used all the tips from Debbie's review. I also added a little worchestershire sauce because I'm a nut for the flavor however I do think it competed with the marsala and will leave it out next time. Also we aren't big chicken eaters so I used pork sirloin instead. Thanks to Debbie and the original recipe poster. Addendum: With the Pork Sirloins I've also used a Merlot instead of the marsala wine. We love this recipe and have it a couple of times a month.

This recipe was very good. My husband liked it a lot. The only thing I changed was...I did it on top of the stove. Instead of assembling everything and putting it in the oven I assembled it in the frypan covered it and let it simmer 15 min. It was wonderful and very tender. Our gas oven heats up the small kitchen a lot and the a/c was having a hard time keeping up. That is why I chose the stove top.

Fantastic! I added a 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper and also upped the garlic a couple of cloves to add some more favor to the sauce. My family loved this. Many dishes but it was really not as many as I would have thought. It was well worth it!!!

I liked it wasn't as good as Macaroni Grill but very close. The flour I just threw in a handfull just to thicken the sauce. Nixed the browning sauce and added about 2 more cloves of garlic. I dirtied alot of dishes doing all the separate frying. Added italian bread crumbs to my flour also.

This is a great recipe. It was everything I was looking for. I did follow the suggestions of others and increased the garlic and decreased the flour. I also used Worcestershire sauce instead of browning liquid because it's what I had on hand. I doubled the recipe for the sauce and would recommend doing so if you plan to serve it over pasta. I served mine over angel hair pasta with extra sauce. It was a winner with my whole family and they are hard to please with new things!

Fine recipe with a few adjustments: 1) DO NOT buy into the statement that there is waaayyyy to much flour in the sauce. The amount was perfect for a nice simple roux and a medium density sauce. 2) Sauce is bland as noted by several raters--added rosemary more salt and fresh ground pepper and it picked up. 3) Finish the sauce (did not see this recommended by other raters) by deglazing the pan in which the chicken was cooked and stirring in a tiny amount of flour--then stir into the sauce. Significant extra flavor for almost no effort. Family loved the dish and will definitely do again.

Absolutely awful! One star because the chicken did come out tender. But as several others reported - it was a unappetizing stodgy mess! It needed MAJOR tweaking in an attempt to salvage something of the meal. Very disappointing and unlike any marsala I've ever eaten!:(

yummy! I had some white zinfandel wine that I used instead of the Marsala since I did not have any and it was really good anyway. Have no clue what the browning sauce is so skipped that. Did not matter. Served it with rice pasta and sautéed broccoli with garlic in olive oil.

I love chicken marsala and this is a great recipe. Only one suggestion: I add 1-3 T of sherry and that makes it perfect!

I made the recipe exactly how it is written. It was easy to make and smelled delicious. It was good but I felt like it was lacking something and I was craving a more deeper richer taste. The Flour on the chicken also turned kind of soggy when it cooked in the oven in the sauce which I did not care for. Not horrible but not what I was hoping it would taste like.

I prepared as instructed except that I used Worcestershire sauce instead of browning sauce. Loved it and will definitely make again.

It was definitely a restaurant quality dish! I added a small amount of heavy cream to the sauce and whisked that in along with the browning sauce. After I cooked the chicken I deglazed the pan with some more Marsala wine and warmed the mushrooms up again before adding them to the sauce. Excellent meal!

Everyone loved this recipe. I had never heard of browning sauce before. I think it enhances the flavor. The portobello mushrooms went really well with the sauce. The only change I made was I cooked the chicken on the stovetop and served the sauce separately.

Family loved the dish. Wife was upset there were no leftovers. I followed the previous reviews to use less flour. I made 2 cups of sauce for 1 pound of chicken with chicken broth instead of beef broth and six cloves of garlic. Will definitely make again. Thanks for the recipe!

Wow! Delicious. my 4 yr old twins and husband gobbled it up. I only used half a stick of butter for entire recipe since i thought 1 1/4 sticks is way too fatty. Nevertheless it was super good!

Be sure to pound out the chicken first to make it a fabulous dish.

Delicious and easy!  I followed the recipe closely, only substituting chicken broth for the beef broth, using baby bella mushrooms (probably more than called for, but extra deliciousness!), and more garlic than called for.  I, also, didn't need nearly as much flour as called for  in dredging, but did add a little extra flour to thicken the sauce before pouring it over the browned chicken.  I also substituted Worcestershire sauce for the browning sauce (since I didn't have any) and added a little extra Marsala wine.  The chicken was very tender and flavorful with the sauce and we will definitely make it again.

I tried this recipe as posted but was not satisfied until I made a few alterations and it then turned out very good. First of all the recipe called for way too much flour. I needed to add quite a bit more liquid (water and Marsala) to make a gravy consistency. Also I added about twice the amount of garlic and twice the amount of mushrooms. After cooking and combining and adding salt and pepper there was still something missing... I sprinkled on some lemon juice and finally got the taste I was looking for.

I made this as written sans the browning sauce. In its place I used a spoonful of savory brown gravy. My husband and I both enjoyed it but next time I think I will add some dehydrated gravy to make it more savory as it was a little lacking for our taste buds. I served it over thin spaghetti that I had tossed with Tuscan herb olive oil. These flavors paired very nicely. As did the steamed fresh asparagus that I served with it.

my girlfriend and i cooked this recipe turned out great at the end but in this recipe it is unclear how much flour to use to make your rouxe so our first try we had to scrap garlic broth and marsala wish it was more clear had to go back to the store second try it turned out great the 3/4 cup of flour is not all for the sauce. lol after all we had a good time experimenting.
