This is a great cake pop recipe and it's what I use every time. I use different flavors though. Red velvet cake + cream cheese icing is my fav!

My 8 yr old liked the taste.  However, we made these on a hot day so we should have left them in freezer, longer.  They were falling apart in the warm white chocolate.  We substituted
white chocolate chips & melted in microwave.  You have to immediately decorate because the chocolate sets (hardens).

Good basic recipe  but they turn out way too sweet and I like sweet things.  I read a blog that said add frosting to your liking and look for the consistency of a dough that sticks together and rolls nicely.  I tried that - half a can worked perfectly - and was delicious.

I made this but used confetti cake and  I have to throw them out and try a different approach. Maybe I shoulda stuck with yellow cake. They were too soft and just fell off the sticks.

These turned out great! The only thing I would do different next time would be to keep the cake pops in the freezer for 45 minutes instead of 15. When the cake pops were dipped in the melted bark the first time, it fell apart.

Mine turned put terrible.but I blame myself..I'm just not good at making cake pops.  I'd say thus is the most traditional recipe for making can pops but mine fall off the stick and my chocolate never melts smooth enough to get a nice coat.   I also refrigerated my dough before rolling into balls because it just wouldn't roll well.

1 star for creativity and 1 for effort
Other than that these are a pain in neck and elsewhere to make. The taste of the cake was soggy, grainy, and looked unappealing.   Then everyone has an opinion.

Made vanilla cake and homemade vanilla frosting with chocolate bark and rainbow sprinkles. I would add less frosting to the cake crumb next time. It was a little too moist. Otherwise AMAZING
