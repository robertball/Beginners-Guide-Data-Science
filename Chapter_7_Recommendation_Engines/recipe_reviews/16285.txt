Delicious! I catered a grilled fajita lunch for 50 people today using this recipe...it was a hit! Several asked for me to share this recipe. Wish I could take the credit for it. The chipotle peppers are what give it that great taste! Served it with grilled multicolored bell peppers and grilled onions. Also guacamole, salsa fresca, refried beans, limes, chopped cilantro, sour cream and cheese. My mouth is watering as I write this!

This is great-but try using one small package of Sazon instead of the 2 tablespoons finely chopped canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and adobo sauce. It results in a much milder taste with a great color. You can find the Sazon on the Ethnic food isle near the adobo sauce. Also, add a little dried Adobo (Goya, of course).

Amazing marinade.  I have used this recipe with sirloin steak; pork chops; shrimp and chicken breasts--all with excellent results.  Have my daughter hooked on it & am sending to my son.  I always make up the entire can of marinade & keep in refrigerator for the "entree of the day".  Equally delicious on the grill or inside on the grill pan!  Thanks Tracie--this a keeper.

For juicy fajitas, I use a flank steak, marinating it overnight before grilling.  It may not look or smell pretty, but the flavor is fantastic and the meat comes out incredibly tender.

What a wonderful surprise.  The marinate didn't smell very good when i mixed it.  I didn't add quite as many chiles as called for.
After  marinading it still didn't smell very apetizing. But wow, after the steak was grilled it was wonderful.  It will be one of our favorites from now on.  It must be tried!!!

Yummy!  I will usually make this with london broil, as we have a family of 5.  I use 2-3 chopped chipotles and 3 Tbs of adobo sauce (the kids aren't crazy about spicy, hubby and I are), and marinate overnight.  The best part of this recipe is the leftovers for lunch the next day wrapped in warm tortillas with cheese and sour cream!

This recipe was fantastic. Easily put together and very unique flavor. Not too spicy and definitely not dull. The lime adds a lot of flavor, don't leave it out. Adobo sauce is not hard to find if your grocery store has ethnic foods.

OMG! This was SO good!!!  I generally don't follow the directions exactly, but last night I did. Only thing I would change for next time would be to add more chipotles (we like it hot) and let it marinate longer than 1.5 hours (all the time I had). I bet it would be delicious on a pork tenderloin as well!  Served with a black bean salad and grilled corn. Light meal, didn't have to turn on the stove, and left the grilling to my husband!

This is delicious!  I have made it twice, once for fajitas, and once for kebabs.  The 2nd time I marinated it overnight, and it was even better than the first time.  This one is a keeper!

I made fajitas from this.  I cut it into strip and cooked it with peppers and onion.  My husband said that it was the best fajitas that he had ever eaten.

I did this as a slow beef roast! Nice change from the ordinary! Smoky hot flavor to start then mellowed out to a nice flavorful chipotle dish. Served with Jasmine rice and steamed brocolli.

I expected this to be REALLY spicy.  I actually used a bit more chipotle than called for and it was a nice tingle on the lips when you were done eating.  I added some olive oil, cumin and onion powder to the marinade.  I also left it in the refrigerator for almost 24 hours.  Awesome recipe, thank you!

I used this marinade for my fajitas...this is my second time using this recipe because it was THAT GOOD!  Initially I didn't like the smell of the chipotle, but once it was cooked into the meat it was totally different.  I used skirt steak instead of sirloin, cut into fajita strips, and only marinated at room temperature for about 30 minutes.  Also, I sauteed it at high heat instead of grilling.  I just sauteed up some bell peppers and onions separately and made some guacamole and voila!

I halfed the chiles and adobo sauce, and doubled the amount of lime juice. With some grilled onions, bell peppers, and some avacado this did make some good fajitas.

This is good. Remember that chipotle in adobo sauce is HOT, so taste it for yourself before you get all willy-nilly on your marinade. I used the full amount and was fine with it (but, yow!). I agree with another reviwer about the lime getting lost a bit, so I would likely add more lime next time. Still great steaks, great idea. Thanks!

Fabulous.  Made as directed in recipe.  Just enough heat from the chipolte sauce to enjoy grilled on a warm summer day.  Served with Calabacitas Con Queso (Zucchini with Cheese) and a tossed salad.

This is so moist and delicious!  I try to not marinate for more than a day (morning to night) otherwise, the chipotle makes the meat a little funky.  I used it with Costco Flank Steak.  This is great with the Black Bean Couscous Salad!  I tend to cook for at least one or two of my batchlor neighbors, and they both agreed this would also make great fajitas the next day.I would definately make this again.

Yikes!  This was too spicy for us to eat.  My husband did not even like it.  The next day I felt like I had to eat the leftovers so I smothered it with sour cream.  It went from yikes to yum but probably not to healthy.

I rarely comment on recipes but I had to for this one: Tracie - Thank you for this recipe!  This is the first recipe I have found that produces fajita-style flavor & it is EXCELLENT!  Tried it on sirloin & round steaks & was very pleased.  Trying it tonight on chicken that I intend to use in quesadillas.  YUMMMMMMMM

I tried this recipe twice. Once as written & I loved it but I agree it was too much for a steak. I used the marinade with skirt steak for fajitas the second time around & I decided to follow Bobby Flays rule of thumb at times is to add a little honey to balance everything out. I loved it even better with the honey added - about 1- heaping tablespoon. YUM-O! I also marinated it for about 4-5 hrs.

This was really, really good.  I let it sit overnght and did the steak under the broiler.  It would have made great fajitas as has been suggested but the leftovers I was planning on having did not exist-we ate every bite.  Even the kids liked this steak. I served it with homemade spanish rice and a mexican style pasta salad and it was a terrific meal.

This was pretty good.  We used the whole can of peppers, so it was especially spicy.  It would be perfect for fajitas, maybe with a little cilantro added.  We'll be making this again.  Thanks!

Loved this recipe!  Used 2 limes instead of 1.  There is quite a kick to it upon swallowing.  Don't let the smell of the Adobo sauce turn you off.  It is yummy!

I was a bit disappointed that this wasn't a stronger flavour.  It was okay, but I marinaded half our steaks in this and half in a bbq sauce and couldn't tell the difference between the two once they were cooked.

I prepared this with boneless pork chops & it was excellent.  As pork can sometimes be dry, I made "Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce" from allrecipes.com to accompany this & it was a great comibination of flavors.

This really had the right mexican spice kick to it. That chipotle adobo is the way to go. Thank you for not using the typical overrated soy sauce for a marinade. I also switched regular sirloin to tri tip which tastes great.

Marinade was pretty good and would be good on fajitas for sure. The only knock is that there wasn't enough marinade sauce to cover all of the steaks.

My husband loved this recipe.  I don't know that it's the best, but I would agree that it's at least a must try.  Very flavorful with the cumin, even if you forget the salt and pepper like I did.

Excellent marinade!  I added a tablespoon of oil, since that enhances absorbtion, but otherwise followed the marinade recipe exactly.  Like one of the previous reviewers, I used this on flank steak, marinated the steak overnight and grilled the next day to make the best fajitas ever!  Served with an avocado relish, black beans and spanish rice.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was great!   My husband loved it.  It wasn't too hot.  I thought it would be but evidentally the heat cooks out a little or is cut by the lime juice.  Never the less, it was fantastic!!!  I'm fixing it again tonight!!!

Nice recipe. I doubled the sauce since I had nearly four pounds of sirloin and added a bunch of extra adobo sauce. Marinated for 6 to 7 hours. It wasn't hot enough. This was my husband's only complaint and why it didn't get a 5* rating. After grilling, I sliced each sirloin into small pieces, top with fresh cilantro and sour cream (try this). Also served with Mexican rice, Miss Betties Zesty Corn (from this site) and warm tortillas. Today we have tons of leftovers we will have fajitas.

I've made this recipe twice now, once with sirloin and once with fajitas.  Both times it was a hit, although I didn't feel like it made enough.  I more than doubled it for the fajita and we enjoyed it thoroghly on Mother's Day. The juice from the can of chipotle peppers is the key, especially if you like it spicy.  The more you put the better!

I made this several weeks ago but forgot to write a review. Guess that tells you how much...I did not care for it. As the others...I marinated overnight. I wish that I hadn't! It was way too overpowering and too too hot. Even my husband that loves spicy things said that it was way too hot. Maybe if I only marinated it for a few hours it would have been better but overall....we still did not care for the taste.

This was very good.  I made this recipe with flank steak and grilled it outside.  I didn't plan far enough in advance to get to marinate it for very long, but it didn't matter.  It was still very flavorful after only a half hour or so in the marinade.  As I grilled it I basted it with a little of the extra marinade.  I added some extra chipotles and adobo sauce since we love spicy food.  My husband thought it was fabulous.  He's a big red meat eater.  I can see why people say it would be great for fajitas.  Yum!

WOW!  This is an excellent recipe!  Thanks.  I tried something similar in the "Chili's" cookbook, and it didn't come out near as good... it was also much more complicated to put together.  This recipe was so simple and I had everything I needed on hand.  This will definately become a regular at our house!

Tasty!  We had it as steaks but I can't wait to try it as fajitas!  My only beef is that the amount of chipotle peppers in the ingredient list is different than what is actually used in the instructions so, be wary! Especially if you are not used to things being too spicy!!The next time I will marinade over night.

We loved it, the complexity yet simple flair with a kick was just what we were looking for. And, I don't rate marinades, I've never been convinced of the effects they have - I wanna taste and feel the impact to the texture.  This may be great for any type of steak - we used skirt steak labeled in the grocers fridge as "marinate."  We love it, and will use it again and again.

Really good!  Used the marinade on chicken breasts for fajitas.  Marinated for approx 24 hours.  I added about 3 tbs of olive oil to the marinade to help with sticking on the grill.   I also a mix of fresh & dry oregeno & extra cumin.  It is a do-over.  :)

4 of 5 because my husband liked it a lot.  I liked it ,but personally thought it tasted too much like fajita meat.  I will definitely try it as a marinade for fajitas.  Thanks for the recipe.

I used three small peppers and it was very hot, but we like it that way. We used this marinade for fajitas. After cooking the sirloin steaks in the frying pan, we added julienned onions and red and green bells and a little water. Perfect with charred tortillas, cilantro, tomato, avocado and for my hubbie, cheese. My husband said these were the best fajitas he has ever put in his mouth and I agree!

My husband and I really liked this one. Easy to make (just takes a little thinking ahead), easy to eat! My first time using chipotle peppers and adobo sauce and I have to say the flavors were just fantastic. We made fajitas with this and served with a side of home made guacamole. Definitely one we'll be making again.

I made this for my boyfriend and he really liked it - said it had great flavor and just the right amount of spiciness.  It was very easy - I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks!

Yummy! I added a bit more lime juice and probably tripled the amount of chipotles I used. I also used mexican oregano. Using fresh spices in this one is a must as old spices will get lost in the other flavors. It does make a great steak with a nice spicy smokey flavor. I will def be using this one again!!

I had bought a can of chipotle peppers and was looking for a way to use the rest of them when I found this recipe.  It is REALLY good on pork chops! I had half the meat the recipe calls for, so I halved the recipe. The only change I made was to use dried oregano leaves rather than ground, and I doubled the amount. I also used freshly ground cumin from seeds. I noticed that a few of the past reviewers have said the flavour was bland - I wonder if they were using old spices. When you use freshly ground spices it makes a HUGE difference in flavour. At first I was worried I wouldn't have enough marinade, but once you spread it around with a fork, and turn the meat a few times, it spreads out nicely. Keep in mind that it comes out more of a paste then a pourable liquid. I let the pork marinate for about 3 hours, then grilled it on a George Foreman grill. If you do not like things really spicy, than you may not like this recipe for meat as a main dish, however if you slice it up and eat it on tortillas with cheese, sour cream, guacamole, or some other spice absorbing condiment, then I'm sure you'll enjoy the flavour.

This was pretty good.  I wanted more of a marinade, so I added some chicken broth I had on hand and added one more pepper and a  spoonful more of adobo sauce.  Marinated for 6/7 hours, great flavor, not too spicy.

I added about 4 tablespoons of EV olive oil and used this to marinade shrimp.  I cooked them in a large skillet on the stove and made fajitas with them.  YUM!!  They were a little spicy for me, but everyone else loved it.  I'll leave out the sauce from the chipotle peppers next time to make it not quite so hot.  Really good on shrimp!

It wasn't my favorite.  I made these as fajitas.  Fried it in 2 tablespoons of corn oil.  The texture was great, though.  I only used a little bit of adobo sauce and it was still overpowering.  

Next time I think I'll just use my own mix of marinade.  Cut out the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce.

Very good, but a little salty for some reason. I used pork, but would be very very good on chicken, or maybe as a chicken wing marinade. Will definiately try again! Would be excellent for fajitas!! Dice and sautee a few of the leftover chiptoles with rice for a great side dish!

This is one of the easiest and tastiest marinades I've ever had.  Sometimes I add a little oil with the adobo sauce, just to stretch the marinade a little.  That also makes it stick to the meat a little better.  Let me tell you...this is awesome as fajitas, and it's way cheaper to buy a plain skirt steak and dress it up than it is to buy the bag of premarinated stuff.  In additons, you end up with less sodium and processed gunk.  Thanks Tracie for a great recipe!

This was very very good!!! I used a roast shoulder and cut it in half lengthwise to grill it and then sliced it into strips for us to eat on tortillas (like fajitas) and plain. Similar to other reviewers I added additonal chipoltes and sauce after grilling and squeezed some fresh lime juice on it. For those in my family who like to 'drown' their food (smile) I served strips with guac, sour cream, fresh salsa, and black olives. YUMMY!!! This was awesome and we will definitely make this again.

I made this tonight.  I doubled the recipe, probably added more lime than called for, I added more of the chipotle than called for as well. I marinated sirloin steaks and chicken tenders.  They both turned out awesome!   Excellent flavor and so easy to achieve.  I like things hot as does my family, so this was fine.  I can see some people might have problems with the hotness though, so be careful when first making it.

I made this with flank steak. Since I only like a little bit of spice, I left out the whole chipotle pepper and only used the adobo sauce. However, there wasn't really any liquid to cover the steak with. I guess it's supposed to be more of a rub than a marinade. I wanted a marinade, so I added 1/4 cup tequila and 1/2 cup of beef broth.  The flavors were good.

Just okay.  I marinated mine over night.  The lime and cumin seemed to overpower the chipotle.

This had some of my favorite ingredients, but just didn't produce the flavor I was looking for. Could have been I didn't marinate it long enough. Anyway, thanks for submitting the recipe!

Yummy! Spicy! Easy!  Versatile!  What more could you ask for. Made it with chicken breasts that marinated for a couple of hours.  Just delicious as a sandwich, on a plate as an entree or sliced up and put on a salad the next day.

Tasty, spicy and full of flavor.  Plus it tenderized the sirloin beautifully.  The only ingredient that I had to pick up were the chipotle peppers in adobo.  This received rave reviews from the guys who love spice but appreciate good flavor.  Delicous!

This came out pretty good.  When I make it again, though, it will have to marinate longer.  I marinated it for about 8 hours and it wasn't spicy enough.  (Even after adding more of the chipotle than it called for).  Thanks for the recipe, though - it will be something to "play" with!

This is OK, but nobody raved about it.  Have
lots left over to try in fajitas tomorrow.

P.S.  Made awesome fajitas with red, yellow and orange peppers sautee'd with onions with some of the Adobo sauce.  Served with grated Cheddar cheese and sour cream.

This was very good.  I marinated tenderized skirt steak for two hours. Not enough time (maybe because of the cut that I used).   I think the folks that don't like this receipe probably don't like the flavors in here to begin with.  I will definitely make this again.

HOT, but tasty. We grilled the steak after marinating, but made the mistake of "tasting the sauce" & so it was hard to get the real flavor from the meat when it was time to eat. We'll use 1/2 the chipotle peppers next time, but would make again. The meat would be good in chili & the sauce would be interesting in enchilada possibly.

I marinated our steaks in the whole can of chipotle chilies with adobo sauce. It was excellent!! The next day, I made more sauce and marinated some thick pork chops, then grilled them. They were good to. Will try next on chicken and ribs. This is a keeper. Husband and kids both loved. Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe. Will use it often.

My husband went wild when he tasted this. This recipe is a keeper.
I marinated a small roast in the adobe sauce (I used the whole can of Chipotle/Adobe sauce)for 24 hours. Then grilled it on the barbie with onions, and later the green peppers and mushrooms. It was fantastic. I had never used Chipotle peppers before and was a little leery. It reminded us of the food we had when we vacationed in Mexico. We loved it.

I'm pretty sure I used too much adobo; but I found it more HOT than flavorful. My boyfriend, however, LOVED it. He is a big fan of peppery food.

I have no access to a grill and do this sort of thing in the broiler. The couple-few charred spots on the steaks were fantastically delicious, and I'm quite sure this is beyond belief when done on a grill.

Next time I'll cut back the adobo.

Make this tonight with ELK steaks...I tweaked the marinade though. I added zest from 1/2 lime, juice from 1 1/2 limes, a tsp salt, and 1/2 tsp black pepper. Kept the 2 Tbsp chipotle peppers the same. I also used about 2 Tbsp grated garlic instead of minced. Overall, very tasty in fajitas! Will definitely make again. It was not too spicy, rather it had a nice, subtle taste of chipotle pepper. And I didn't think that the marinade smelled bad...I thought it smelled good. But I cook with these ingredients all the time, so maybe I am just used to the smell.

A fantastic marinade for flank steak for fajitas. I did add about a 1/4 tsp granulated onion, 1/2 tsp kosher salt, and 1/4 cup packed cilantro (leaves and stems) to the ingredients. I blitzed it all in a mini processor adding a little oil to make it come together, then put the steak in a zip top bag, added the marinade, squished it around to coat, and let it sit in the refrigerator for a couple of hours. Mighty tasty!

Made this for my husband, who likes steak and spice and it was exactly what he wanted. I couldn't find chiptle chiles in adobo (not very common in Ontario, I think), so I used a smoky chipotle salsa instead, and it was great. Thanks!

Great marinade!  I added extra chipotle on mine. I made kabobs with sirloin steak tips, onion, and yellow bell pepper.  I served it over rice pilaf.  A pound of steak tips left plenty left over for lunch.

I love this recipe.  I usually triple the marinade amount, then make two days' worth of steaks, because the second day, I slice up the steak sand make fajitas.  This recipe must be allowed to marinate at least overnight, though, to get the full flavor.  I eat this with the Spanish Rice II recipe, and it is fabulous too!

I feel bad giving this only 3 stars when most other people seem to love it, but I just didn't think it was that great. I followed the directions exactly and it still seemed a bit bland. You're probably thinking how could it be bland when there are peppers in it?? Yeah.... I don't know either. It's not bad, but not great either. Won't make again, sorry - maybe it was just me??

So easy and very yummy!  After reading some reviews, I wasn't sure if this would be way too spicy, so I opted to only use one chipotle pepper minced with a bit of the adobo sauce (rather be safe the first time and not ruin the entire steak!).  I was marinating one piece of top sirloin (just under a pound) and we loved the smoky flavour.  The result was not too spicy, so I could add a bit more next time.  As others noted, I am sure this would be fantastic with fajitas!  Thanks for sharing.

Good but not great.  The spice was definitely there so if you like spicy things you will like this.  However, this isn't like a traditional marinade it's more like a paste.  Although the flavors are good, I don't think there is a lot of depth to them to use this on a stand alone entree.  I think this would be better used if making it for fajitas or something like that.  If you want to use it for a stand alone I sugggest adding a little red wine or some beef broth and cut back on the lime and, to balance the flavors, I would add a T. of honey or molasses.  I won't use this recipe again (as written) for a stand alone sirloin entree.

VERY GOOD AND SPICY, PROBABLY BECAUSE I USED 2 OF THE PEPPERS AND ALL OF THE SAUCE FROM THE CAN. I MARINATED THE MEAT FOR ABOUT 3 HOURS.  NEXT TIME I WILL USE THE GRILL LIKE THE RECIPE SAYS, BECAUSE THE MARINADE IS SO THICK THAT IT KEPT BURNING IN THE HOT PAN. I WILL ALSO DOUBLE OR TRIPLE THE RECIPE BECAUSE I ONLY HAD ENOUGH TO COVER ONE POUND OF STEAK.

I absolutely loved this.  I only had half the amount of sirloin, but did not halve the amount of marinate just to see what it made.  I'm glad, it turned out fantastic using all of it, but I like it hot.  Too cold to start a grill outside so I broiled the meat and ate it like a good steak.  Leftovers are good too!  Can't wait to try this marinate on other meats.

This recipe produces a great flavor, but we felt it would be better served with something like fajitas rather than as a stand alone dish.  The flavor was good, but not right for plain steak, and my family that didn't like hot things didn't care for it plain either.  I do think it would be excellent as a spice for your fajita mix though.

This is absolutely the best steak I have ever made at home.  The marinade gives it a good smoky flavor, but is not overpowering, and it makes the steak tender and juicy.

Great flavor -- WAY to spicy. I love hot food, but I went overboard on the chipotle and adobo and seriously regretted it. Otherwise, great recipe.

This made a very flavorful marinade. Be cautious with the Chipotle chilies ... they packed a serious punch. Be sure to taste the marinade before adding a second chipotle chili.  This recipe is worth making again.

We tried this last night with tri-tip steaks and declared it a "keeper". The second thing out of my husband's mouth, the first being "WOW!", was that he couldn't wait to try it as fajitas. The marinate is just perfect, and made the steaks very tender. I will say that I was leery of using the whole can of Chipotles, until I read the rest of the recipe. That part was a bit confusing. But oh, what flavor!! Thank You!!

Excellent! We marinated overnight with entire can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, grilled steak 24 hours later. This had flavor & spice, but reviews that say it smell bad and/or dish is too spicy must not be used to southwestern flavor & spices. We considered this dish "mild" for Arizona tastes and wonderful!

It's true - the marinade smells pretty rank, but the end result is amazing!  I halved the recipe, and used two large peppers and 2 tbsp of adobo sauce for our 1 lb of meat, and marinated about 2 hours.  Now, I like my food spicy enough to make me cry (or at least sweat a little).  But this was a little too hot for even me!  So if you're not into food that makes your mouth numb, cut down on the sauce and peppers!  BTW, my husband says that this steak, along with Carnation Mashed Potatoes from this site, are his new all-time favorite meal.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

I agree with you all this was a hit with my family. I used the canned chipotle peppers with adobo sauce already in it, next time i may just cut up one pepper and add it to sauce. But it was yummy.

Easy and tasty, rolled the meat up in a tortilla and topped with avocado, cilatro, cheese and salsa.  The meat was a tad bit chewy, might double the marinade next time.  Thanks for sharing!

I'd never cooked sirloin before, plus after reading reviews, I was apprehensive about the spice in this recipe being too hot.  I love it, my husband doesn't.  So I made it following the recipe, using 3 small peppers and a small amount of sauce from the can for the marinade.  It was delicious!  Not too spicy even for my husband.  I'll make it again and add more peppers.  thanks!

Super easy recipe with awesome flavors and medium spiced. Will definitely be making this recipe again. 

Due to really crappy weather outside I wasn't able to BBQ.  So I pan-fried /sauteed  it,  still great.  I can't wait to try it on my BBQ.

Made  this recipe  using venison round steak. Then, separately fried up some peppers, onions, and mushrooms for a fabulous meal of fajitas. My family thought it was excellent and that I should definitely make it again.

I am not a big red meat eater so this is what I did. I used 2 skinless chicken breasts. Put all the ingredients in a gallon plastic bag, add a little a splash of chicken to make a marinade. Left in fridge for a few hours and grilled it. Had a little leftover so I kept it for pizza. This is a very spicy recipe.

This was Really good!!!! I would not use it on a really expensive cut of meat like rib eye, The sauce would overpower the meat but I made this with sirloin and I think it would be great to marinate a large London broil, Definitely a tri tip when they are on sale.....we live in Cali so tri tip can be $6.99 a pound (we have relatives in Michigan that never heard of tri tip until they visited the west coast) it is really cheap there. The only thing I did different, I really didn't mean to, Was apparently my local Mexican market has something called "Chipotle salsa" It comes in the same 7oz blue can that I always buy my Chipotle peppers in adobo sauce in, only difference is the little title. Well I accidentally bought 2 of these cans along with my regular stock up on Chipotle peppers. I grabbed a can tonight, opened it and no peppers???? looked at the label and it said "chpotle salsa" I tasted it and it is basically pureed chipotles in adobo sauce!!!!! used that for the marinade! It was perfect! Going back to buy more LOL! Other than my Ooops I followed everything exactly! My husband and son both really liked this! We like spicy! but I don't think it was too spicy for people that like it a little milder, it was not burn your mouth spicy, more like a nice smokey heat. I will be using this again on different cuts of beef and probably chicken and pork too. Would probably be good on shrimp with a short marinade time.

A little too hot, but still good.

We got a keeper! To avoid using our charcoal grill I decided to bake it. Seasoned as directed. To make it juicy I dissolved 1 Maggie in hot water (enough water to barely cover beef) & poured it in the baking pan. Put it in @ 400 for about an hour. Came out delicious! saved lil juice for a light gravy and the rest I poured into making rice w water. Yum Yum

I added 1/4 cup red wine to the marinade, let it sit over night and then cooked it as a fajita dish using ranch steaks.  While cooking, I added about 1/2 tbs of sugar and 1 tbs dried ranch packet.  It really added a lot of flavor to the recipe.  I added onion, green and red peppers, sliced tomatoes as well as onions to the mix and it was fabulous.  It was really spicy, but as left overs a lot of the spice diminished. Next time I will add a some cream and more adobo sauce to give it more depth and flavor.  Over all, it was a pretty good start to a great dish.

Holly Moly! This is good! I only marinated my flank steak for about an hour and a half, then grilled the meat. I sauteed peppers and onions briefly, then added the cooked, sliced flank steak to blend the seasonings from the meat with the vegetables. The meat had a good flavor and was spicy and hot just like I like it!! I will be making this again for sure and plan to marinate the meat longer next time for the full flavor intended.
