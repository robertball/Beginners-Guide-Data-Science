Normally I wouldn't review a recipe I changed so much but I hope my changes will help someone else, because this recipe really has a great foundation of flavor, the quantities just needed some tweaking for me! Ok, only had 1 very large chicken breast to use up, used 6 boullion cubes to 8 cups water, doubled ginger and garlic, used 2 tablespoons soy, left sesame oil the same. For the vegetables I used 1 large can baby corn,  8 oz can water chestnuts, cup of broccoli florets, cup shredded cabbage, 1/2 red pepper, 5 green onions, 1 medium zucchini and a small can of mushrooms. Some sprinkling of salt and pepper after simmering for a while and it was really delicious! Even my husband ate a big bowl and he hates soup.

I have to admit. I put ALOT of hope into this soup! The broth smelt so good and all of the veggies made me smile but I went to eat it and the broth taste was not anything like it smelt :( It was too watery. I even later on added more cubes, soy sauce, sesame oil and ginger when first tasting it because it was so bland. If someone came up with a solution for fixing the broth the soup has potential to be amazing!

I gave it 2 stars because the napa cabbage in the recipe overwhelmed all other flavors. I was looking forward to tasting the fresh garlic and ginger but all we could taste was the napa cabbage. I even kicked up the amount of soy sauce and sesame seed oil. Next time I would omit the nappa cabbage.

I love Chinese cuisine but this is not that! If one went by the recipe, it would be as bland as plain water. The soy sauce needs to be much heavier as does the sesame oil. And the times for cooking, especially the chicken, is for someone who has a much hotter stove top then I.
Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed.

Excellent soup.   I did use a little more soy sauce and bouillon than the recipe reads and also used some white pepper and teriyaki sauce.   I prepared my veggies so that when eaten they were still a little crunchy, yet fully cooked.   Exactly what I was going after on this one.   This was well received and requested to be made again.

This recipe does have a good base for flavor...just needs an extra kick. Used lots more soy sauce, probably 4 tablespoons. Added a spicy garlic sauce. I used chicken broth 4 cups and 2 cups water. Double the garlic. Double the ginger. All the vegetable amounts seemed perfect. And after adding the vegetables, make sure you're not cooking too long because you do want them just a bit crisp. In the end my 5 year olds loved it...and that's saying a lot for a bowl full of vegetables.

Family loved it! I added shrimp and less chicken. Will definitely make again. I added more bullion and more veggies. Next time I'll use "regular" cabbage instead of Napa. Shrimp and no chicken...

I loved this soup!  It's just wonderful for being light and yet hearty enough to serve for a meal.  I didn't get too hung up on what veg and how much, I sort of loosely followed the recipe and added whatever needed to be used from my fridge (like a couple of small potatoes!).  I agree with others' reviews that the flavor was a bit bland so the BIG change I made is adding a bunch of soy sauce (too taste, you'll have noticed I don't do measurements by now?). I think that adding fish sauce would be a good addition too.

2nd time I've made. Absolutely LOVE it. My husband likes broth soups not creamy thick soups.  This is his FAV. I did use Bok Choy instead of celery. Do not skip using the toasted sesame oil it makes this recipe. LOVE IT LOVE IT.

This is a PERFECT start to a recipe. I added like 9 bullion cubes instead of 1, and I threw in alot of extra veggies. But this is a great place to start and this is almost a  good proof recipe, just about anything tastes great in here.

Great soup! I added miso for more flavor.
