This recipe was perfect. My hubby had been craving his mother's Bierocks and had talked about them many times.  I called her with this recipe and she gave me the lowdown on what to do and what NOT to do:

1. Prebake the bottom crust for about 10 minutes.
2. Brown beef, onion and ADD some seasonings (we just added seasoned salt and fresh pepper).
4. Then add sauerkraut (rinsed, drained, blotted) OR fresh cabbage that is shredded for coleslaw (as the original bierocks calls for fresh cabbage).  You will just need to cook it until softened.
5. As for the 'binder' to keep the meat together some other reviewers had mentioned adding a can of creamed corn or cream of mushroom soup!  Yikes! This made my mother-in-law shudder at the thought.  Just sprinkle the beef mixture with 1-2 Tablespoons of flour and add 2/3 cup of water to make your own 'gravy'.
6. Put the cheese ON the meat and NOT on top of the crust.

Anyway, my hubby loved it and it satisfied his craving for the bierocks of his youth.  Great recipe.

Wonderful casserole, Kathy. Just a few additions to spark it up though:Used 1/2 pound spicey pork sausage in place of the extra half pound ground beef; added extra half cup of Cheddar to the ground beef mix; added 2 cloves garlic, minced to ground beef mix; added 1 cup grated cabbage to ground beef mix (along with sauerkraut); and added 2T Dijon mustard to ground beef mix. You'll find that these changes really liven up this dish. I had no problems with the crust getting soggy. This is a quick, easy and stick-to-your-ribs dinner. Thanks for sharing.

This is truly delicious!  Per others suggestions, I added a can of Cream of Mushroom Soup (fat-free) to act as a binder. Added garlic and other seasonings to the meat. Also added a little more kraut and baked approx. 15 minutes longer. But it very simple, tasty and makes a lot!

My family enjoyed this, and I will make it again, but it needs more flavor.  One piece of advice for others: be sure to season the meat mixture to your taste.  As the recipe is written, the mixture just tastes like plain cooked hamburger.  Next time I will use pepper, garlic powder, etc., but I think it needs something else to give it some kick.  I'm not sure what that is - I'll have to experiment.
By the way, I served this with sour cream and applesauce.  That's more a Russian thing than a German thing, but it worked great with this, and gave it more flavor.

Quite good, easy and not traditional bierock, but a nice fix for a small amount of time. Two things, I did add the soup and feel it is a necessity. I baked the bottom layer of rolls for 15 minutes and it came out just right. Finally, next time the cheese will go inside. It's just too heavy on top and too salty in conunction with the soup. Great recipe!

A big hit in our house! Reminds me of the pasties that you find in Northern Minnesota.  I followed other's advice and added a can of cream of mushroom soup; also added garlic & celery salt & some hungarian paprika for spice.  I put the cheese on the inside which worked well.  Finally, I baked this in a 13 x 9 pyrex and the dough came out perfect, though others have mentioned some probs with doughy-ness.  I think this would also be good with carrot & potato chunks mixed in with the meat.

EXCELLENT!! I made a few changes per others reviews.  I used 1/2 head of fresh cabbage and steamed a little then added it to the ground beef, onion and seasonings (I used garlic powder, seasoned salt and pepper).  I also sprinkled the ground beef mixture with a few TBS of flour and 2/3 or so cup of water to make a gravy.  I then  prebaked the bottom crust for about 10 minutes while I was putting the meat together.  After putting the beef into the crust, I put the cheese over the meat, then the top crust.  It was delicous! I couldn't believe my ULTRA picky 7 year old ate 2 servings!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

This was so delicious, will be a mainstay in my household!!  And by the way, why do so many misuse the rate/review feature?!!  People, you're supposed to review Kathy's exact recipe.  IF you change hers with your own special tweaks, then it's not her recipe any longer, but an altered and therefore different recipe.  Enter it as another recipe, graciously giving Kathy a mention, and go to town with whatever you'd like to tweak it with.  That way we can have many different individual Bierock recipes  to choose from, and Kathy can - as well as others, be judged on their own personal recipe without all the clutter.

This recipe was sooo easy!  My family had mixed reviews.  My husband really liked it, but my children and I thought that it tasted too much like saurkraut and not enough like bierocks.  I will make this again, but next time I am going to use plain shredded cabbage instead.

we thought this was very good.  I added 4 more oz of sauerkraut and had no problem with it being dry.  Also added some onion and garlic powder to meat while browning and a few splashes of tabasco.  Did not add the cream of mushroom soup.  I baked the bottom layer of bread for a few minutes before putting the meat mixture in as other people had had problems with doughiness.  I should have cooked just a little longer, maybe until just starting to turn golden, as was still a little underdone.  Next time I think I'll try half ground beef half sausage.  Was very good on a cold day.

I just adore this casserole!  so simple yet so good.  The only thing I have done on a few occasions is to add french onion soup mix to give it a different flavor.

Terrific recipe!  I make Bierocks quite a bit, so was thrilled to find this a great time saver.  Mixed a pkg of dry onion soup w/a teeny bit of sauerkraut juice & added to meat instead of using regular onions.  Hubby loved this!

Bierocks are Runzas! Only this is way better than the ones I had at college in Nebraska! This was a quick, easy, filling meal. My husband & I scarfed it down, my 18mo son loved it, but my 5yo daughter wavered back & forth. I don't think we used enough cheese (we shredded our own & didn't know the equivalent), so next time we'll put in more. We used the suggestion of baking the crust first and making "gravy". Only problem is that it's not nearly as good leftover, so eat it while it's hot!

I decided to try this recipe because the ingredients reminded me of the "Hamburger Pies" that my grandma made when I was a little girl, and I never thought to ask her for her recipe before she passed.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that this Bierock Casserole tasted just like my grandma's.  I know that my grandma did not use prepared crescent rolls, but I don't mind saving time, especially when the taste did not suffer in the least.  Thank you so much to whomever submitted this recipe.  I can't wait to make this recipe for my dad, he will be thrilled.  Also, all of my children loved this casserole.  I definitely rate this recipe a five!

Interesting idea....sauerkraut overwhelmed the cheese the first time I tried it so I switched to a sharp provolone and added a layer of frozen mixed veggies.

We loved this at my house!  I did make a few changes though..used prepackaged colesaw mixture instead of sauerkraut and sprinkled the cheese on top of the meat mixture and just a little bit on top crust.
This one's a keeper!

This is quick and very good.  I also added cream of mushroom soup and layered cheddar cheese on top of the ground beef mixture before putting on the top crust.  Prior reviews were right on the money!

this is super fast and very yummy.  Two things though - I substituted 1/2 head of chopped cabbage for the sauerkraut and baked the bottom cresent roll "crust" for ten minuntes first, otherwise is soggy.  I also blended my cheeses - using 1/2 chedder, 1/2 mozzerella and added nutmeg and seasoning salt.  It was wonderful!

My husband is a very picky eater.  He made this recipe and loved it.  The only thing we changed was we didn't put the crescent rolls on top.  And, of course he added more cheese.  We loved it.  We will be eating this again and again.  Thanks

Was great - wife and baby loved it.  Used whole onion and diced red potatoes.  Will add more saurkraut next time.  Didn't have cheddar so I used mozerella - was okay, but cheddar would have been better.  Make sure to drain well or else crust will be too soggy.

When I first saw this recipe, it sounded boring and bland. After reading the reviews, I decided to try it anyway. I'm glad I did. It was extremely easy and very tasty. My husband and 13yo son loved it, but my 11yo daughter(who doesn't really care for pickled things)made herself a pb&j sandwich and was just as happy. I will definitely make it again.

Made just as it called for. This was just "meh". I was warry of cheddar cheese and krout combo, but really was fine. I prob wont be remaking this anytime soon. It was fairly bland really needed a lot to kick it up.

We have never had Bierocks , but like all the ingredients  , so gave it a try.  Method was simple . Taste was way under seasoned for us .  We thought the filling needed some kind of moisture .  Had no problems with the crust being doughy .  Will try again with some adjustments.  Thanks for sharing .

I had to give you five stars Kathy! For one, cause you live in Salina (I'm in Wichita :) And second, because I've been making this for years, but with cabbage instead of sauerkraut. I'm not a fan of sauerkraut and the bierocks I remember from back home (Moundridge) always had cabbage. My friends and I are still making this casserole today. You cannot go wrong!! :)

I liked this casserole. it did have a very tangy taste due to the sauerkraut, but my hubby and I liked it very much. I only made 1/2 batch by pressing the crescent rolls out thin in a 8x8 pan. It probably would have been better with more bread, but I didn't want to spend that much on two cans of crescent rolls, being a cheap cook!.

Kind of odd, but tasty. I followed earlier suggestions about baking the bottom crust for 10 minutes, adding some water, flour and spices to the beef mixture and letting it kind of make a gravy, and mixing the cheese in with the beef rather than sprinkling on top. It was good, but we couldn't finish it all as it was extremely filling. I would probably make again with lots more tweaking.

Although we really loved this dish, I'm only giving it three stars because as written, it would have been fairly bland. I used ground turkey and added a lot of seasonings and worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture. Do yourself a favor and use bagged sauerkraut instead of the can. (much fresher taste) Also, using plain sauerkraut from the can or the bag doesn't do it justice. While browning my meat I put the kraut in a sauce pan and added crumbled cooked bacon and onion. I also added some caraway seeds. Cooking the kraut for a good thirty minutes makes a huge difference. I put the shredded cheese on the meat and seasoned my top crust with garlic and onion powders. Although I did enhance this recipe quite a bit, I certainly would never have thought of turning Bierocks into a casserole dish Cathy. Thanks so much for a great start!!!!

This is a little bland.  I added worchestershire sauce and I also put most of the cheese UNDER the top layer of croissant.  I think the next time, I will add some black pepper, garlic, diced tomatoes and diced green pepper.  I realize that this really makes it stray far from the "authentic" recipe, but it's just too bland as it is.

This is one of the "new recipes" I've tried that my husband has asked for again. Plus my daughters and a friend of theirs that don't like sauerkraut really like it. I took other reviewers suggestions and add mush soup to the beef along with some spices.  I also put some cheese under the top crust.  Next time I will try with about 1/2 pound sausage.  It's even good re-heated.

Very easy to make.  Tastes very similar to the real thing.  The first time I made it I used cresent roll dough and added 6 pepper blend seasoning to spice it up.  I also used packaged shredded cabbage.  Everyone loved it.  The second time, I adjusted the recipe based on suggestions from other reviewers. I add cream of mushroom soup and bread dough.  My family liked it better the original way.  The soup was overpowering and made the crust doughy.

This had great flavor although I did use some of the reviewers suggestions to liven it up.  It was a little dry for my taste so next time I think I will try making a sauce maybe from some of the saurkraut juice,white wine, water and cornstarch just to make it a little juicier.  I'll let you know how it turns out.update  I used breakfast sausage instead of hamburger and made a gravy out of a little of the saurkraut jusice, water and flour.  It was very good.

My whole family enjoyed this one. I felt like while making it it needed mushrooms. I added pepper, and hot sauce to the meat while browning. This wasn't cheesey enough for my gang, so next time I will add a layer of cheese in the middle with the meat.

We really liked this recipe. The dryness of it was not that bad, really. I made it as called for and all of us loved it. Even my 2-1/2 yr old grandaughter. We liked it sliced cold and took it along for our snow picnic. Great !!

I took a lot of the advice here.  I used the cream of mushroom soup, and I didn't add the cheese until halfway through the baking time.  I highly recommend both those things.  Also, I seasoned the meat while it was browning with some salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  And (only because my family loves it so much) I added extra sauerkraut.  And everyone loved it!

This was delicious! The only things I changed was adding half ground beef and half sausage and substituting cheddar cheese for swiss.  The flavor of sausage and swiss went better with sauerkraut in my opinion.  Very tasty and really easy!  Thank you for sharing!

my goodness, this was just so delish. definitely one of my favorite recipes on this website! i went along with others suggestions and put the cheese on top of the beef mixture, i also used only a 1 lb. of beef which was plenty. thank you, thank you for this recipe :)
oh yeah, i didn't add the mushroom soup because i think that changes the recipe too much and would take away from it. instead i added a tablespoon of flour and a little water to the meat mixture to help the consistency and keep it together when baked.

This is a very homey and fulfilling recipe.  I added seasonings to the meat of garlic powder, a little basil, and salt and pepper.  I used about 1/2 cup of sour cream and 3/4 cup of cheddar cheese in the filling for a binder.  I, personally, really liked the cheddar cheese on top of the roll topping.  I would make this again.

This was really good after a few modifications.  After reading some of the other reviews, I browned my hamburger with a couple cloves of garlic and some onion, then seasoned it with garlic salt and black pepper to taste.  I baked the base crust for about 10 minutes before topping it with the meat mixture.  I also opted to mix 1/2 of the cheese with the meat mixture, sprinkling the remaining cheese on top.  Next time I think I'll wait to sprinkle the cheese on top until the last five or so minutes of cooking, as I did not care for the crunch it created by cooking it the full 25 min.  All in all, it was a yummy dinner and my husband said it was a keeper.

Wonderful recipe!!  My husband's from a German family and this recipe was like a trip down memory lane for him!  I prebaked the bottom crust as suggested in another review, along with adding shredded cabbage instead of sauerkraut.  Just added a little garlic powder for another layer of flavor.  My husband said he could eat this casserole every week!!

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe.  I thought it would just be okay and I liked it enough to make it frequently.  Can be dipped in ketchup if you find too bland.

This was very good. I prebaked the bottom crust and seasoned the meat as other reviewers suggested. I didn't use a top crust at all (forgot to buy 2 cans of crescent rolls). I also used packaged kraut instead of canned. My family really liked it. I will make this one again.

Eh... It was ok. The idea is great, but it definitly needs something. I don't have enough experience to know what to put in it, but it needs more kick. I'll probably make it again, but I'll have to figure out what should go in it. Bacon? Worchestershire sauce?

UPDATE: I made this stuff again, but this time I added a lot of pepper and garlic powder. I also used Worchestershire sauce and put half the cheese UNDER the cresent rolls. But the things that made the BIG difference were the 1/2 c each of sour cream and "salad dressing." I've never had Beirock, so I don't know what it is supposed to taste like, but it seems to me that pasties should have creamy filling. The sour cream and salad dressing really did the trick.

My husband and I took great liberties with this dish, substituting crumbled canned corned beef for the hamburger and using Swiss cheese.  We also added a few strips of finely sliced dill pickle.  We had a Reuben casserole, which was delicious.  We ate the whole thing.  Thank you, Kathy, for a very successful recipe, quick to fix and economical.  We will prepare it again.

I thought it was delicious and very filling.  I switched the ground beef for shredded chicken, but everything else I did the same.  It was very yummy!  My husband doesn't even really like sauerkraut, but he liked this.

This idea, putting a filling between two layers of premade crescent dough, is a good one, and I think it could be adapted for other flavors.  I made this with some of the suggestions for jazzing up the taste--dijon mustard, worcestershire, etc, and we all had seconds.  I think it would also be good with canned or leftover corned beef, the sauerkraut, Thousand Island dressing, and Swiss cheese--fast reuben casserole.  Good idea, Kathy!

I tried the receipe using half sausage and half hamburger. I didn't use the soup suggestion. I really liked it! However, my picky son and husband did not. They are pretty much basic meat and keep the veggies seperate eaters. I'll fix this for friends and I'm sure it will be well received. Thanks for the recipe!

I enjoyed this recipe...I made it for my family tonight and they loved it. We used biscuts instead of the cresents because we did not have them on hand. The only problem that I encountered was that after the 25-30 min bake time the biscuts were not done all the way. I am not sure if this was because we chose the biscuts instead of the cresents. Other than that it was real good...will do it again.

Based on reviews posted here I did not follow the recipie, but I thought the flavor combinations seemed great. I sauted beef in onions, salt, worchester etc, and added cream of mushroom soup. Then I put it in a homade pie pastry. Topped it with hot German mustard, sourkraut, sharp cheese and lots of dill pickles and baked it up. Turned out great, so thanks for the tips!

Even after following the advice of others by using spices and mushroom soup, my family of 3 adults did not like this dish.  My very frugal mother didn't even demur when I said I was tossing out the leftovers.  Sorry!  It's not even close to a bierock, nor particularly tasty.  I won't be making it again.  (By the way, I baked it 10 min. longer in a 9x13 pyrex dish and the crust was fine.  Also, I added the cheese halfway through, but it was still overcooked.)

I made this last night for my husband and I and reading the reviews it didn't sound too good but I tried it anyways. We loved it!! I did add some salt, pepper and garlic powder but other then that everything else was the same. Next time I think I will try the Cream of Mushroom soup, it will help it stick together more. Thanks for this recipe it's great!!!

I love all of the ingredients in this recipe, but was very disappointed with the end result. It was very bland and dry. I didn't read any of the other reviews/suggestions before I made it. I'm sure I won't make it again. It's too bad it tasted gross, because it was quick and cheap to make. Oh well.

We tried this recipe because we wanted an easy main dish casserole for dinner.  This was perfect!  It has very good flavor and our kids (ages 14, 11, and 2 1/2) liked it alot, even though they won't normally eat sauerkraut (we didn't tell them it had sauerkraut in it until after they tried it and asked).  The toddler ate all of his and the two older kids both asked for seconds!  Good choice.

Like previous reviewers, I added one can of cream of mushroom soup to the beef mixture, and cooked the casserole for an extra ten minutes.  The meat mixture was good and the overall flavor was good, but even with the extra ten minutes of baking, the bread dough was still not cooked all the way.  Probably won't make this again.

I am a huge sauerkrat fan so I loved this recipe. It was very quick and easy to prepare.  I would recommend cooking it ten minutes longer b/c in thirty minutes it was still a little doughy.  I would also wait to put the cheese on top until half way done cooking.  I also added a can of mushroom soup to give it some conistency per previous suggestions.  My three year old cleaned his plate!

Overall, I liked this recipe in that it was quick, easy and a little unusual.  There should have been another ingredient in the meat mixture to hold it together and make it jucier, because the meat was too dry and crumbly.

My family really liked this recipe. I adapted this recipe because I didn't have crescent rolls. I used my bread machine for the "crusts" and it worked well. I did add some mushroom soup as a bind for the meat and sauerkraut.

I found this recipe about 1 month ago and have made it 2 times already!  The WHOLE family loves it.  AND it is so fast.  I really like the very slight tang the sauerkraut adds to the dish.  You could also just add shredded coleslaw mix to the hamburger and cook till tender for another taste.  I will keep this recipe handy!  THANKS!

This was OK, but I guess I was expecting a taste much more like real bierocks.  The crescent rolls made this too sweet.

Not good enough for me to make again.  Can't think of anything to improve it either.

Not worth making again. Needs some kind of seasoning. The only thing you taste is the sauerkraut. My toddler ate it though!

I haven't had Bierocks in ages. I always loved them when we lived in Kansas, but haven't found them since. A friend of mine's husband made his version the one time I visited. So I figured Allrecipes had to have something, I was so glad I found this. Changes I made: I didn't use sauerkraut. I bought pre-shredded cabbage and I cooked that first and let it set to the side till I was ready. I used the grillmates Montreal steak seasoning and salt and coarse pepper to the meat and onion mixture. I also used an extra flaky crescent dough that I purchased. Turned out a little too doughy and would scale back on that next time. I will definitely make this again. So easy. I had some for dinner, then took some for lunch and got home to find out my parents had stopped by and ate the rest. Even though they weren't sure what I was talking about when I described the bierocks, they loved the recipe! Thanks for adding!

I made this for just me+leftovers in a 8x8 pan. I used a whole head of cabbage to be more runza-like and only 1/2 lb of ground beef to be healthier. I only had red cabbage to use up, but it all tastes the same to me. Also, added a couple of beef bullion cubes to the hot mixture to add some beefy flavor without the calories. Laced in some swiss cheese and voila!  The only thing I would change would be using frozen french bread dough next time to be more like the favor I'm used to. The cresent rolls didn't do it for me!

We did 2/3 ground beef and 1/3 spicy brkfst sausage; added diced green pepper & celery along with kraut and simmered until soft; seasoned meat with garlic powder, lemon pepper, black pepper, caraway seed & a splash of worchestershire sauce; stirred in cheddar/jack & mozzerella cheeses (about 1-1/2x the recipe amt).  Baked bottom crust first, just til getting golden, and stirred in a bit of 1000 island dressing just before adding meat to casserole dish.  Topped w/butter flake crescents (on hand) and sprinkled with grated parmesan cheese - then baked as directed.  Hubby - who hates saurkraut - loved it!

Wow thanks!  MY grandma used to make Bierocks for us when we were kids but I am seldom in the mood to make the dough and assemble them! This tastes just as good, is MUCH less mess and makes a bigger batch!  I did season my beef with my favorite steak seasoning and garlic pepper but not too much. I wanted to make sure the sauerkraut shined through.  I drained my sauerkraut but did not rinse it, I LOVE the taste of sauerkraut!  This one is a keeper!

Used luv2cook's suggestions and altered the recipe accordingly. We did enjoy it but felt it could use more flavor.  I will make this again but I am going to use the saurecraut in place of the fresh cabbage and use more seasonings in the ground beef.

This recipe really helped me mix up the casseroles that I try to make on Sundays. It was very easy and I added a ton of seasoning and some mixed veggies and it really completed the meal for us. I also took the suggestion of adding the cheese to the inside of the dish too.

This was pretty good.  Instead of using ground beef I used a shredded beef roast that I slow cooked all day first.

I was looking for a good venison recipe.  This fit the bill, although I modified it by adding a 27 oz can of kraut which I chopped up a bit and 8 oz of cream cheese.  I originally had planned on adding sour cream, since this is a Polish recipe, but I had the cream cheese on hand.  I think it would have been too thin had I used the sour cream.  Also, next time, I plan on just trying a regular pie crust.

Followed the recipe exactly and then realized that the cheese probably should have gone inside the casserole instead of on top. The flavor was good, so I'll most likely make it again that way instead.

This recipes was good. I did make some minor changes, though. I did not squeeze the kraut dry, I let it simmer with the beef mixture for a few minutes to reduce the the liquid. I also used pizza dough rather than crescents, wich gave the dish a chewier texture and less "chemical" taste that crescents can have. Next time I might try a more coarsley ground beef, or possibly even pork.  Thumbs up!

It was very easy and turned out great, next time though i think ill mix some plain cabbage in with the can of sauerkraut, because it was a bit too vinegary for my taste.Good when you need dinner in a hurry. Oh and I made it healthier by substituting beef with Yves Brand ground beef substitute, and it was great!

Just found this recipe yesterday while I had some down time at work.  Was curious to try it out!  Took some other poster advice and pre-baked bottom crust for 10 minutes, then added cheese inside.  My fiance and I loved it!  He added some thousand island dressing to his, but said he liked it equally without it.  I did season my ground beef with lots of garlic (which we love), salt, pepper, and a dash of Cavenders seasoning.  I'll definitely make this again!

Sorry, but I will never make this again. My husband ate mine because I couldn't stand to eat anymore. No flavor and way too dry. I had to cook it 10 minutes longer just to try to cook the crescent rolls all the way, and then they were still doughy. Two thumbs way down!

This was sure an easy recipe! Very quick to put together! My husband really liked it, but it was just so so for me. I think it had to much sourkraut. If I do make it again I will only add half the amount. I did add a can of sliced mushrooms because he really likes them.

Yum!! I followed other reader's advice and baked the bottom crust for 10 minutes. I tossed a little fresh garlic, lawreys salt and sage in to the meat and onions as well to add some flavor. Very different if you're tired of the same old, same old.

This was a good recipe except for the cresent roll part. I felt that the buttery flavor from the cresents made it too rich..  Pie crust would have been better....I made 1/2 of the dish with kraut and the other 1/2 with cabbage to see which was better... I prefer the cabbage in it..  I also did not add the cheese as per other posters reviews.  May make again with the above changes.

This recipe was a good base for someone to do their own thing to, but not so good as it is written. I would recommend using some different breading, since the crescent rolls give it a funky taste. Also, definitely bake the bottom crust for a while before putting on the toppings or else it gets really soggy.

this recipe is awesome.  Because the sour kraut is cooked, just a hint of the sourness remains, which is a perfect compliment to the beef.  I would recommend adding some spices though, I added a pinch of caraway seed and some seasoned salt.  But overall, the recipe is outstanding.

My husband loved these! He eats his with Salsa and Fat-Free Sour Cream and I used ketchup, so it wasn't too dry for us. We froze the leftovers and took them to work as lunch and they were just as good (put a papertowel under them when re-heating so the bottom doesn't get too soggy). This recipe is a keeper!!

Nice "different" type of casserole. East to prepare. This casserole would be good with left over corned beef and a little splash of thousand island dressing over meat also. Took advice from reviews & added fresh garlic & ground black pepper to meat mixture,( thought the garlic & onion powder would make it to salty w/ the basic salty taste of sauerkraut) & put cheese on top of meat instead of on top of dough. I used sauerkraut in the bag & drained and squeezed in paper towels till very dry so dough wouldn't come out doughy. I'd make again.

Excellent!  I thought this was so good and easy, which is always a plus!  I added Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, seasoned salt, and pepper to the beef while it was cooking.  I also put the cheese on the meat mixture like some of the other viewers said they had done.

This didn't taste good to me.  My family wouldn't eat it. I can't think of anything that would make it taste better besides totally changing the filling.

YUUUMMMMMMMMMMMMY! This is a family favorite. Other than adding Worch. Sauce and spices to meat mixture and placing the cheese on top of meat, it is an awesome recipe!

This was a great fast recipe.  I loved it and my husband loved it.  My 9 year old had a problem with the sauerkraut, but my 3 year old ate it.  I will fix this again in the future.

It's ok if it is eaten with some dijon mustard.  That was the only way.  Fairly bland otherwise.  Might make it again, but I will jazz it up with some spices.

I loved this meal and so did my husband.  I took some advice of past reviews, when I made this.  When I made the hamburger and onion mixture, I added salt, pepper, garlic powder, and worcestershire sauce.  I browned the meat and then drained the mixture in a collander and then mixed it in a bowl with a can of mushroom soup. Then proceeded with the rest of the directions.  I baked it at 400F for 30. My oven is real weird, so you might just want to gauge how your oven works.  It came out great and nothing soggy about it.

This was wonderful.  I used swiss cheese instead of cheddar and served it with mustard.  My husband loved it.  I also cooked it on a cookie sheet and didn't have any problem with it being too doughy.

I'm sorry  to say my son and I really thought this was gross. It was very easy to make, and my bottom dough cook thru just fine. But will never make again. My husband didn't mind it.....but he eats anything. I think i will try a chili type meat or mexican, using the top and bottom crust, that would probably be very good.

Great recipe. Easy to fix and very filling. My husband ate 2 helping which means
he liked it.  I think I'll try it with the mushroom soup next time to help bind the 
hamburger. Definitely will use again.

This is a great recipe! The only tweak I would make is adding just a bit of seasoning. I like Bavarian style kraut, so I'll probably use that nest time or toss some caraway seeds in when I'm cooking the ground beef. And there WILL be a next time! It was a quick, easy crowd-pleaser at my house!

We liked how easy this recipe was to follow and prepare. I thought the hamburger was a little bland tasting, but everyone else who ate it liked it. We all added a little mustard on the side. I also think it might be better to put the cheese under the top crust.

Love the concept of this recipe and a what a time saving option to satisfy this Kansas girl's craving for bierocks!!! After reading the reviews I decided to go with the Kraut Bierock filling from this site that uses cheese, fresh cabbage, onion, ground beef and sausage with seasonings. I also throw in some shredded carrots. We really love the way the cabbage tastes and can't imagine using canned. This is one of the most requested recipes at my house, thanks for the idea!

Definitely make again. I'm not wild about sauerkraut all of the time but had a taste for a Reueben. Had ground beef on hand & this sure filled the crave. Love it when a recipe is delicious with the simplest ingredients. Olive oil, Onion, garlic (I use with everything lol), brown meat, adding only salt & pepper. Needed to use up some mushrooms so I added them & cooked down, along with the little bit of liquid from adding the kraut, it was awesome! Precooked the bottom a bit, didn't seal anything,  still looked presentable. Used buttery croissants for the top. Served with a side of thousand island (per my preference, Idk how this dish is traditionally served) & it hit the spot! Great EASY change up & will keep in my "go to on a whim" menu. :) P.S. As I was cooking it, I got a hankering for  a beer with it & that was a great choice as a complimentary beverage! Enjoy!!!

Good basic recipe I added  2 cloves minced garlic salt & pepper to taste and 1 can cream of mushroom soup and 1/2 can  of water I drain some of the juice from sauerkraut but not all for top flavor but never ever rinse  next time I think I'll add some sharp cheddar cheese  Thank you for sharing this recipe

Used Luv2Cook's recommendations, except for the cheese. Didn't need it at all. Used fresh/refrigerator sauerkraut that was rinsed. Hubs LOVED it, and it was so easy to make.

I remember watching my mother make bierocks years ago. I also remember how long it took her and how grouchy she got!  But they were delicious!!!  I wouldn't say a casserole can beat the traditional bierock, but oh my sanity thanks me for sure.  I did alter this recipe by adding a can of cream of mushroom soup and  cabbage... OF COURSE! I steamed the cabbage with a chopped onion for 10 minutes while I mixed the sauerkraut, browned/drained hamburger w/ another sauteed onion, cream of mushroom, cheddar cheese and salt and pepper.  Topped the bottom layer of crescent roll with cabbage, sauerkraut and beef mixture. Then topped w/ crescent roll sheet which I topped that with more shredded cheese.  Baked about 20 minutes @350 and pastry was golden brown.  Kids all loved! Sauerkraut. Onion and ALL!

This recipe is a great recipe to make your own.  I followed another post and baked the crust for 10 minutes before I added the meat.  I used 2 lbs of ground beef, added a packet of brown gravy mix and seasoned the meat with Tony's Chacheries and garlic.  I only used about 3/4 of a 14 oz can of kraut and sprinkled the meat mix with celery seed before adding mozzarella cheese.  Then I sprinkled garlic powder, salt and pepper to the top crust.  Thanks for posting!

we love this recipe & make it all the time. I love making it for new mothers - I usually get a lot of compliments.
the only thing I do differently is add 1/2 tsp minced garlic & 1/8 tsp red pepper flakes to the meat/onion when cooking it. 
thanks for sharing!!

My husband and I really liked this.  The first bite was kind of a miss but it grew on us.  I made some additions after reading suggestion from other reviewers.  I added a can of Cream of Mushroom soup, 4 cubed red potatoes (steamed), and 6 cloves of garlic, that were grated, were added to the meat as it browned.  Personally, I would reduce the amount of sauerkraut by about half.  It throws off the texture a little.  I didn’t have any onions so those were omitted.  I would definitely make this again though and maybe experiment with other things to put inside.  Maybe make it like Shepard’s Pie with mashed potatoes on the inside.  Mmmmmm.

Very, very good.  I did as the other reviewers suggested.  I added 1/2 jar of canned Sauerkraut and then some fresh, cooked cabbage.  I also added 2 tbsp of dijon mustard the the hamb. mixture.  Added a few tbsp of flour to the hamb. mixture too with 1/4 cup of water just so it combined better.  Finally, I added most of the cheese on top of the hamb. layer and sprinkled a bit on top of the pastry layer before baking.  
My mom is german and I made this for her.  She loved it!

I just made this this weekend and really enjoyed it.  I didn't read any of the reviews and the only modification I made was to use frozen chopped onions which really speeded up the preparation process.  I had leftovers the next day and still thought it was good though I did dip it in ketchup.  I love ketchup.  I liked this recipe as is but I also could see modifying it in the future to give it a little more pep as other reviewers suggested.  Thanks for the recipe.

I've never had the traditional version, but this was great! I did make sure to bake the bottom layer of dough before. Other than that, didn't change a thing and absolutely loved it!

I loved this recipe!!!! My sister and I both agreed it tastes pretty close to the real bierocks mom used to make when we were kids. I did follow the other users comments. I prebaked the bottom crust, added seasoning to the meat (pepper and Mrs Dash's garlic blend), and I put the cheese under the dough. It came out perfect. I am self proclaimed non-cook who has just decided to learn to cook and it was so easy for me!

My family looked at me like "you're kidding" when they cut into it and tasted it. Everyone thought it was unimpressive and a bit bland. My husband took leftovers to work and said it was much better with a dollop of cottage cheese mixed in. Not terribly bad but don't think I will make this again

I had very high hopes for this dish as I like all the ingredients.  Unfortunately, the results were far from what I expected.  I managed 4-5 bites, but my husband and kids stopped eating after the first bite and went out to eat instead.

I tried this recipe because it sounded interesting.  Unfortunately it was horrible.  I couldn't stomach it and my husband said it was the worst thing I have ever made.  But on the flip, my two year old finished most of what I put on his plate and told me he liked it.

I would have to give this a 4 star. I don't know if I did something wrong or not, but mine came out kind of dry. I loved the favor, but I made brown gravy and poured it over it and it was fine. I would probably make this again, hoping it comes out right. Nice and Easy to make. Thanks

This was wonderful! and so quick  and easy. I did add the saurkraut juice to the meat and onions while they were cooking and added some garlic,salt & pepper and tobasco for zip. The extrea liquid cooked off and left more flavor to the meat. We definately will make this again!

My husband grew up with this only they were folded more like calzones.  After searching for 7 years for something like his grandmother's, I think I found a winner.  He loved it!  I am not a fan of sauerkraut, but it wasn't bad.  Will be making again.

Very good. Next time I will add a few spices to the meat mixture and put the cheese on top of the meat instead if the crescent rolls. Tastier as a leftover.

This is a delicious alternative to plain-old casserol. My family loves sauerkraut, so this went over well. I always rinse sauerkraut before cooking with it to get out a lot of the tanginess. I added salt, pepper, garlic powder, and red pepper flakes to the s.kraut, and I put the cheese on top of the meat. The crescent rolls were easy and worked really well in this dish.

Yummy, espcially reheated the next day.  I put half the cheese under the top crust, and the other half on top.  I think it helped hold it together a little better.  The flavor was really good.  I added some spices to give it more flavor.  Next time I'm going to try rolling the crescent dough to make little beirock hot pockets.  Yummm!

Wonderful recipe, after reading some of the reviews, I did add a little Worsh.sauce. I think the next time I make this, I may add some cubed potatoes as well. My husband and I both loved it, and will make this one of our regular meals from now on. Thanks Kathy for sharing a great easy recipe!

Husband and I found this pretty good, but a bit bland.  We didn't think it really needed all that cheese, but it was good.  The crust is very soggy in leftover form, but we did eat the whole thing eventually, even with just 2 of us.  I might try it again with more spices, because it's definitely a nice change from the same old thing, when you're looking for something new to do with ground beef, and you like sauerkraut as we do.

I thought this was a great recipe, although I did change a few things around...one, i used some salt and black pepper while cooking meat for some mild spice.  I added about 4 oz sharp cheese to the 8 oz cheddar to give it a little kick plus take care of the not cheesy enough problem. I put most of the cheese on the inside but did also sprinkle the outside with cheese. I also added 1 can of creamed corn in lieu of the soup...worked well as a binder, kept it moist and also added flavor while balancing out the sourness of the sauerkraut.  Very Yummy!!

Excellent dish. Jazzed it up with some dijon mustard and some of Emeril's Southwest seasoning. The crescent rolls add a touch of sweetness that balances the tartness of the sauerkraut. A perfect compliment, IMO, to this dish is German potato salad.

I love saurkraut but this recipe was a little too much for me.  My husband loved it.
