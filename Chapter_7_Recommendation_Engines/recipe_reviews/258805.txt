It's difficult to get excited about a salad, but this one was a winner when I made it for my sous chef mother-in-law and her highly discerning palate. Her daughter loved it too. :)

I followed the recipe to the letter — no changes or additions whatsoever.  I thought it was awful, and couldn’t even finish eating it -- I tossed out the remainder.  The sharp and acidic dressing coupled with the sharp cheese was just too much.  My dinner guests didn't like it either.  Dill and tarragon are great on their own, but combined are AWFUL.

I doubled the dressing recipe and used half to marinade chicken breasts for a couple hours in the fridge, then sautéed in a nonstick pan over medium until cooked through, sliced and added to the salad. It was delicious, and the chicken made it a filling dinner. Also added a few shakes of dried tarragon in lieu of fresh and skipped the salt and sugar on the toasted pecans, didn’t miss it.

I've brought this to several family functions, and I've walked away with an empty bowl every single time. Unfortunately I've never tried it with tarragon (I've never seen it in a grocery store here), but it's still amazing without it. One of the few salads that's still tasty on day 2, even if the salad is a little wilty.

I love Dijon mustard.....but  I was worried this might be too much Dijon even for me.  But it was fantastic.  I didn't use all the dressing at once, so I have tried it on different greens, spinach, rocket, leafy green and it's great on all of them.  I will also make the salty/sweet pecans for other salads.

I love this salad.  Made it with blue cheese instead of cheddar and added some green onion and a few dried cranberries.  Added a little sugar to the dressing but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Everyone enjoyed it immensely!

Delicious. I only used half the dressing so made a spinach Brutus the next day. It was good too.  Be sure not to skip the herbs, they really add a lot. *Update*. Try this with Chef John's pork tenderloin Diablo. Perfect fall flavors, yet light enough for warm Indian Summer days.

I did not make any changes and it was the hit of a dinner party. The combination of ingredients were perfect. The men and women loved it. I will defiantly make it again.

It was good as is, but the next day I made it again, adding chunks of chicken I made using this recipe for dijon mustard honey chicken and cranberries and it was the best salad I've ever had in my life.

Perfect. I even found Little Gem lettuce--very pricey and I think with all the sharp tastes, romaine would do just fine. I let my guest dress his own salad, which is probably safest.

Delicious! Unfortunately, I did not have fresh herbs so I added 1 tsp dried dill weed & 1 tsp dried tarragon leaves. Will definitely make again with the fresh herbs.

I might add a bit more sweetness next time. It’s fairly tart with the vinegar, Dijon and apples... but overall it’s good! I liked the pecans. Yummy.

I've always loved cheddar cheese on apple slices, so this was a must try. It definitely didn't disappoint. So many wonderful flavors in this salad!
