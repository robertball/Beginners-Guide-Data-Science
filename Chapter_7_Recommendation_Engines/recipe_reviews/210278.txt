Pretty good recipe. Don't microwave the sauce, rather heat it in a skillet.

This was not cheap to make the Chinese spice was $3 alone. The peanutbutter sauce is VERY bitter and salty.

This is a favorite in our house.  I bake the chicken at 350 for 15-20 minutes rather than frying it.  I always steam carrots to go with it because the sauce goes very well with them also.

To my surprise, we thoroughly enjoyed this.  I tasted the peanut sauce coating and thought OMG it has too much seasoned salt, but you know what...it didn't.  I wish there'd been more of a coconut flavor in the chicken, so I'll probably add more to the breading mixture in the future.  We were not disappointed in any way with this recipe, and I will make it again.  I don't fry often, but felt this one was worth the indulgence.  Very easy recipe to prepare with nice presentation...and let's not forget TASTE.
