Egg white powder is dried egg white (pure albumen). It can be reconstituted by mixing the powder with water. The reconstituted powder whips like fresh egg white and, because it is pasteurized, can be used safely without cooking or baking it. Dry egg products can be stored for 12 months and are a terrific source of nutrition. They are usually sold along with supplies for cake baking and decorating. 
Just incase you wanted to know.....Great shake by the way!!!

Sounds Great, just wondering where the heck you buy powdered egg whites at though :(

This recipe was so amazing, so yummy, yet so easy! I skipped on the powdered egg whites because 1) I hadn't heard of them, 2) I didn't have them, and 3) a reviewer said it was $11!! I wouldn't say it's necessary because it is delicious without it. It's a classic recipe anyone can tweak to his or her desire. I added an extra quarter cup milk for a smoother milkshake. On one serving, I also added about a tsp of the white chocolate caramel powder coffee mix for an interestingly different and delicious taste! Be creative and enjoy!! =]

Very good milkshake. Powered egg whites were $11/can at my local Kroger, plus $3 for the Nesquick, and $3 for the ice cream. That equals a pretty expensive milkshake. I hope I can find something else to do with those egg whites. If you're trying to save money and don't already have the egg whites in your pantry, skip them. I think the shake would be just as tasty.

Very good! I skipped the powdered egg whites because I had no idea what those. The shake was fine without them so I don't think they're necessary.

My grandkids loved this for a Pajama Party sleepover; used BunnyTracks ice cream instead of vanilla -- & I added more milk, since I had a banana that needed to be used up!  Paired up with a movie, popcorn, & pizza.  They were Happy Campers...

Yum! This really hit the spot. I didn't add the powdered egg whites because I couldn't find them at our grocery store but I doubt this could have been better. Now I have to pick up more ice cream so I can have more. :)

This was really good! I left out the egg whites and just used 1 hot coco powder packet with 1 tsp of liquid syrup. It was really good with they right amount of "chocolatiness." It did melt kind of fast.... but that can't be helped.

Very thick and creamy!  We added 2 T of chocolate syrup just to make it super-chocolatey!  It would have been fine without it.  We just loved the consistency of the shake.

This was excellent!  As for the powered egg white, I buy mine from the bulk food stores in Amish country.  Not expensive at all.  I use them to make meringue when I don't have egg whites, or to add bulk to the egg whites I already have.  I have seen it at confectionery stores where they sell candy making supplies.

The ratio of ice cream to milk is perfect! The chocolate mix tasted good in this. Instead of powdered egg white, I used 1 whole farm fresh (pastured) egg.

I'm not sure if it was because I halved the recipe but the shake wasn't very thick. Smooth and flavourful though! I'll definitely be making it again but I'll make a full batch as directed (minus the egg white powder) and if it's still too runny just blend in some chopped ice because the taste of this shake is going to keep me coming back!

I loved this so much. I made one some and enjoyed it enough that I went to make more and found that all the ice cream was gone! I used to drink a chocolate shake similar to this and I thought it couldn't get better. It was amazing! I highly recommend this recipe to everyone who loves a good old chocolate shake.??+??=awesomeness!!!!!!
