For a lighter version of this soup, I copied everything off this recipe except only added 1 Tablespoon of the Heavy Whipping Cream.  Really I could have gone without the whipping cream all together.  I modified this soup so it would be lighter in both fat and calories.  I thought that the flavor and smooth texture was not compromised at all by reducing the whipping cream amount.  My husband and I found this almost as good as the gourmet pumpkin soup that we at at Sandals in St.Lucia.

This is an excellent recipe for pumpkin soup!  I have been using it for about two years and my whole family loves it!  Even kids will eat this soup!

Sometimes I replace the heavy whipping cream with 1/2 cup (or more) sour cream for a different twist.  This recipe also freezes well and doesn't change consistency when thawed for use!

Tip:  When creaming the soup, use a handheld blender (like a handheld smoothie maker) and just put it directly into the pot instead of transferring everything back and forth to the blender!

Loved this soup - but I made it for vegetarians with vegetable stock, added a tablespoon or so of peanut butter, some freshly ground black pepper, a bay leaf and I used canned pumpkin. Instead of blending it I used a hand blender in the pot - perfect. I will omit the whole peppercorns next time - I think one of my guests nearly swallowed it and started coughing. Other than that - not a single drop was left over!  Even the guest who was coughing on the peppercorn finished every little bit of it!

Really good.  I made a few changes that others made.  First, I cooked my pumpkin in a glass dish at 375 for about 90 minutes (cut in half, cleaned out, cut side down, covered with foil).  I cooled and scraped out the pumpkin.  I then sauted onion and garlic in a little olive oil.  I then added broth, mashed pumpkin and seasonings ( I substituted 1/2 teaspoon pepper for the pepper corns).  Simmered for about 20 minutes, pureed the mixture with submersion blender (hand blender)and then added just a little 2% milk to make a little creamy.  It was really good.  I might play with the seasonings next time.  I might forgo the thyme and season with curry or pumpkin pie spice.

This soup is not only easy to make, but incredibly good!  I didn't have whipping cream - just used what I had on hand - skim milk. Flavor was still great and felt better because it was less fattening.

To the previous post, yes, you can use the canned pumpkin, it is just pureed pumpkin, the same (almost)as if you cooked and pureed your own pumpkin. Delicious soup.  More people need to try it.  Think people's brain's go to "pumpkin pie" and think it will be sweet.  Nope, it is a wonderful, savory soup.  Good for you too!

Based on other reviews and personal preferences I modified this recipe as follows: 6 cups reduced salt chicken stock  1 1/2 teaspoons salt  4 cups pumpkin puree  1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley  1 cup chopped onion 1 chopped red pepper  1/4 teaspoon dried thyme 2 clove garlic, minced  1/2 cup heavy whipping cream Â½ tsp fresh ground pepper Dash nutmeg  I pureed the peppers and onion with a bit of stock prior to cooking. I added the parsley and nutmeg prior to simmering for the last 30 minutes. This soup was so delicious that even the biggest skeptics helped themselves to more. I have made it twice and served it to all ages 2yrs to 85 yrs and everyone LOVED it! So yummy even for people who do not like the taste of pumpkin.

My whole family loves it! I started with raw pumpkin and added 8 cups of raw cubed pumpkin instead of 4 cups puree, and it worked great! I just pureed it later on before adding the cream

With added cinn, nutmeg, and celery this soup is excellent, it is good made according to the directions but I needed a little more flavor.

Super yummy and super easy. I added a shake or two each of ginger and nutmeg; not enough to be able to taste either spice, but just enough to intensify the flavor of the soup. I also added the cream to taste, which was about half of the listed amount. This soup would be excellent for company. I'll make this one again; thanks for the recipe!

This was great! A bit of nutmeg really sets the flavors off, but do it at the end and just add small amounts at a time or else it will overpower the soup. I would also recommend adding an extra clove garlic as it really brings out a bit more flavor. Serve this with a good quality french bread stick (should be very hard on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside).

I must say, I am quite surprised by all the stellar reviews.  Some have said that they are not fans of pumpkin, and they loved this, so, perhaps that's the issue.  I love pumpkin!  For once, I followed the recipe exactly, and I found the soup to be quite watery and bland.  It tasted more like chicken stock with cream.  I attempted to thicken it with a potato, cornstarch in water, and, finally, canned pumpkin.  It tasted fine, but, not great, and I couldn't get over the thinness.  If I were to play with this recipe, I would definitely do two things differently:  I would cut the stock in half and add more if I thought it necessary, and I would roast the pumpkin (as opposed to boiling it in the stock) for a more robust pumpkin flavor.

This is a good cold day soup ! I really enjoyed this. It reminds me of potatoe soup in consistency. Anyhow,I will definitely make it agian. I used light cream instead of heavy cream, b/c that is what i had, and it worked out fine. Very tasty !

Decided to make this recipe, but didn't feel like going to the grocery store.  Luckily, I had two cans of pumpkin.  I just minced my onions super fine since I wouldn't be blending the soup.  Also, I had to sub half & half for cream.  Turned out delicious.  I had some zucchini bread leftover from the day prior that I sliced and toasted.  Made a great topper for the pumpkin soup.

Neither my wife or I like pumpkin but I know it's good for you so I have been looking for a way to have and like it. Finally, here is the answer. We both really loved this soup and our 4 year old liked it too.

I will definitely be making this again but I will probably be making twice as much next time.

This was sooooo good. I thought it was yummy and my mom absolutely loved it. It was very thick and creamy. Easy to make, except removing the seeds from the pumpkin..I loved the fact that the recipe called for fresh pumpkin, though. I added red pepper for a little kick. Highly recommended, especially for cold, rainy days. Would be delicious with grilled cheese sandwiches, but definitely enough on its own for a filling meal. Yum yum yum

A very nice soup!  While the recipe is great as is, I have made variations of it for the past 3 years.  Guests are always pleased with the results as am I.  The one thing I have found is that the flavours come out really nice when the soup is left overnight to "marinate" before the second boil and simmer.  Thank you for sharing.

This was a great recipe. I halved the recipe and it yielded about 4 servings. I did my own thing with the spices, though. I added 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves(for half a recipe) and 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg. I used about one teaspoon dried parsley in the base of the recipe and did not add thyme (I didn't have fresh parsley or thyme). I used black peppercorns but did pick them out of the soup before serving based on a previous reviewer's experience. Next time I think freshly ground black pepper would be fine.

I also added about 1 TB spoon honey to bring out the pumpkin's natural sweetness. This did not make the soup sweet but did deepen the flavor.

Never having had pumpkin soup I was interested in trying this recipe, although I did make a few minor changes.  I first sauteed the onion in garlic in a bit of butter until soft; then added the parsely and thyme (I also added a bit more of these than listed).  I used 4 cups of canned pumpkin.  Instead of the peppercorns, I used white pepper to taste.  After simmering 30 minutes, I used my immersion blender to blend until smooth.  At this point I would suggest adjusting salt and pepper to taste.  I loved the taste of the soup without the cream; if you cannot or do not use cream, don't hesitate to make this recipe, it is terrific without it!  I did add the cream and heated through at the end of the 30 minute simmer.  This recipe was a huge hit here for both adults and kiddos alike.  Thank you for the delicious recipe!!

I had lots of leftover pumpkin after Halloween last year and I was determined not to let it go to waste. I looked around for recipes here and decided to try this one. Glad I did! It was delicious and heated up well. I know I'll make this again next year.

Great base recipe.  Made the following changes  - roasted my own pumpkins - used 4.5 c vegetable stock instead of 6 c chicken stock - used 3 cloves garlic - stuck the onion and garlic in the blender before cooking; much easier to work with than blending the whole soup after cooking! - used only .25 c heavy whipping cream - added a dash of cumin and a heavy helping of curry powder - skipped the whole peppercorns

Very delicious! My room-mates and I gobbled it all up! Like another reviewer, I did not bother with the second blending after simmering the first 30 minutes.. the soup still came out silky and delicious. The cream added a wonderful texture and milkiness to the overall product that really sealed the deal I believe. Also I substituted regular course ground pepper for peppercorns.

I just made this soup tonight. My 5 year old ate a whole bowl full (without the parsley) and she's a fussy eater. I loved it and will make it again. Yum !

I served this soup for Thanksgiving this year and it was a huge hit with all 11 people!!!  Compared it to a five star restaurant quality style soup.  I used all organic ingredients, homemade chicken bone broth, and fresh pureed pumpkin (not canned).  Also, for a dairy free version for my hubby, I substituted canned organic coconut milk for the cream and it came out wonderful!

Great soup!  Just a little helpful suggestion.  If you have one of those submersible wands you can avoid the tedious task of running this through the food processor 1 cup at a time.

We had a butternut squash from our garden which I wanted to make something savory from, and I chose this recipe.  I am really glad I did - I really enjoyed it and my remaining family members found it good as well.  We are only three, so there are some leftovers, and I am hoping they are even better as some reviewers said.  Although I followed the recipe quite closely, I did add spices as recommended: garam masala, dried thyme (no fresh available), and ginger.  I made the puree by halving the squash and baking it in the oven for 1 hour with a little water in the pan. I then cooled it, scraped it out of the skin and processed in the food processor until smooth - so easy and much tastier than canned. Next time I will omit the water, rub the surface of the squash with olive oil, and bake for 45 min.  As the puree was very moist, I reduced the broth to 4 cups.  The texture of the resulting soup was perfect.   I did not add the cream due to lactose intolerance, but didn't miss it.

Very good!  I used canned pumpkin instead.  I halved the recipe and used one can of pumpkin (15 oz I think).  My friend had some too and liked it a lot.

This is such a simple soup to make - and healthy too!  I did make a few changes but think it would be great the way it was written.  (I just can't help making changes!)  I used two boxes of chicken stock - which is probably closer to 8 cups instead of 6.  I did probably closer to 6 cups of pumpkin.  Did 1 1/2 C of onion, 4 cloves of garlic, dry thyme, and also added ginger and garam marsala (?) - probably about 1/2 - 1 1/2 t of each.  I didn't have heavy cream or half & half - so I did add a little bit of cream cheese - not much though - about 1/5 of a package - and I added it before putting it all in the Cuisinart because cream cheese needs to be pureed. This is really good now...can't wait to have it tomorrow when it has had some time to sit.  *oh - and because I didn't read the directions - I put the fresh parsley right into the soup and pureed it along with everything else.  It was fine - and didn't change the color.

I've made this at least 6 times since fall.  Initially I used just a splash of cream or evaporated milk, but honestly, it's super delicious with no cream/milk.  I chop an onion, saute with pumpkin, add chicken broth only and follow cooking directions as written.  I add cumin, curry powder, black and red pepper.  So, so good (and good for you)!

Love this recipe...I've made it several times! I love to serve it to my guest when I host Autumn gatherings! They are always surprised if they've never tried it...Not Sweet like pumpkin pie but more buttery tasting like squash...really smooth and velvety!  Goes great with little Turkey salad sandwiches! (talk about Fall Festive!

This was sooosoo unbelievable!! I sis some tweaking and sauteed onions and garlic with slightly boiled pumpkin diced. I then blended the whole soup after it cooked. I also omitted the cream and it still had an amazing texture and taste! My husband and I loved it and then served it the next day to guests-who also raved about it! This will definitely be a keeper! I'm addicted to this soup!!

This is a fantastic soup. I added 1/2 and 1/2 cream because it was what I had on hand, and added  approx. 1 1/2 red pepper and freshly graded pepper instead of peppercorns after reading the reviews. I also used dethawed fresh pumpkin i had previously frozen cubed. As a final point , I did puree the pumpkin and garlic prior to adding it to the chicken and vege stock. Excellent!

This is really good. I ony gave 4 stars because I doubled the pumpkin, otherwise it looked too thin to me. I used 4 cups salt reduced chicken stock, 2 cup of plain water with one teaspoon of bouillon, a sprinkle of ground black pepper instead of peppercorns & 1 teaspoon of salt. The cream makes it taste outstanding.

I picked this recipe because of the lower calorie/fat content compared to most soups of this nature. I followed the recipe except for one thing...I used fresh butternut squash instead of pumpkin. We only get pumpkin from India here and it's not as nice. I served it with a swirl of whipping cream and parsley on top. I then cut circles of a small baguette and made a notch in them to sit on the edge of the bowl. The ladies at my luncheon all enjoyed the taste and appearance.

If you are using real pumpkin, this recipe is a little time-consuming, but well worth it! My husband and I absolutely love this soup! Creamy and flavorful. Definitely e-mailing this to friends. A great soup for holiday entertaining.

This soup was alright.  I needed to play with the spices quite a bit...I doubled, maybe tripled the parsley, used vegetable stock rather than chicken stock, and soy cream in place of dairy. We actually found that a dash of cinnamon in each bowl was really nice! I will make this again, but will play with the spices a little more.

I added some fresh butternut squash in with the chopped onion and garlic to pureed pumpkin from a can since I had both in the house.  For spices, I used some rosemary, a little cinnamon and ginger (did not use thyme or parsley) but used ground black pepper instead of the peppercorns.  I then added about 1/2 cup of fat free half and half.  Came out delicious!

The soup was a bit bland, and I couldn't taste too much pumpkin.  That could be because the pumpkin I used wasn't very flavorful.  Instead of thyme, I added cinnamon, ginger, and curry.  It wasn't bad, but it didn't win over my husband.

Excellent soup, and a good way to use up home-cooked pumpkin that came out, well, soupy.  I added half each of red bell and poblano peppers simply because I had them, but the soup would have been fine without them.

I'm making this recipe for the second time today because it was such at big hit last time!! The only thing I did different was to add nutmeg and a little bit of honey just because I love sweet things. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

Yummy, comfort food type of soup.  So very easy to make too.  I had lots of fresh pumpkin so decided to whip this up Thanksgiving Day.   I enhanced with a few sprinkles of cinnamon and clove and a touch of nutmeg when serving.   Mmm mm

The second time I made this, I wanted it to be thicker so I reduced the broth to 5 cups, and added a little more pumpkin. My mother simply adored this soup. She is asking for the recipe. Thank you so much for sharing.

This was a great soup! The only problem I had was that it was too peppery for our taste.  It was almost spicy there was so much.  I will make this again, but cut back on the pepper next time.

This was "OK" but kind of bland. I toasted some pumpkin seeds and sprinkled them on top for presentation which helped. Probably will not make again.

I don't understand the bad reviews this recipe got, it almost made me not try it, but i'm glad i did!  It was delicious.  I used canned pumpkin puree and basically followed the recipe. I tasted after I added the first bout of seasoning and then just added more.  I also used dried thyme.  I didn't bother to puree it.  I poured in some half and half for the cream until I thought it looked right and it tasted great!  We had it for a main dish although you probably need something else...we had some honey oat bread.  try this!

Excellent once adjustments were made. I added nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves.  The flavour really was better the next day, after the spices had melded. The original called for too much onion- the flavour was overpowering so I kept adding spices to delete the onion flavour. It was a big hit at Thanksgiving! thanks

This was really good, my whole family loved it! I made sure to use low sodium broth and I used less salt than called for. I also added about 1/4 tsp. of curry to help bring out the flavor....
Great recipe!

I really enjoyed this quite a bit, with the exception that it was a bit too salty.  If I make this again, I will wait until the end to add any salt (if needed).

This soup was amazing.  I have never had pumpkin soup before and I was pleasantly suprised:)  I used milk thickened with about a tablespoon or so and flour because I didn't have any cream in the house.  Thanks for the recipe!

I cooked this recipe for a party of 15, and everyone loved it!  I chose not to use whole peppercorns, and I did not puree it (I liked it a little chunky).  I had at least 5-6 people ask me for the recipe!  Very easy,a nd tastes like it simmered for hours!

This is great soup! It was the first time I attempted to make Pumpkin soup. I altered it slightly based on other reviews. I added pepper, 4 garlic cloves, a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg. The extra pepper and garlic adds a little zing. I didn't add any whip cream to keep the calories down. Very Yummy!

This recipe is great - I added nutmeg and cinnamon- subbed the whipping cream for half and half. I used shallots in stead of onions. Supper yummy!

This was the first time I had ever made pumpkin soup, and I was not disappointed!  What a great recipe!  My husband and I loved it.  We're planning on making it again this October.  He carved a jack o'lantern,  and I roasted the seeds and made the soup.  :)

Yummy and simple. No cream needed! The pumpkin alone makes this seem thicker than I figured it would.  I added cooked quinoa to itand it was a perfect consistency with that extra protein and filling-ness!

This is a great soup but needs more garlic (I used 4 cloves, seemed about right) and also added a 1/2 tsp. of curry powder and 1/2 tsp. of cumin and a dash of cinnamon which gave it some flavor. I sauteed the garlic and onions (and added a stalk of celery because i had it) with the spices and then added the rest. This worked well. I also used 1/2 and 1/2 to reduce the fat content. yum!

It doesnt have a very strong pumpkin flavor, but that is ok.  I like that this recipe isn't sweet.  We enjoyed this a lot.

Wonderful soup. I doubled the amount of pumpkin, used ground black pepper, dried thyme, and green onion. Fresh parsley didnÂ´t improve the flavor of the soup; itÂ´s better leaving it creamy instead of having little herb pieces to nibble on between spoonfuls.

This was a nice change to try and I will make it again. I made a slightly different version: 4 cups chicken stock & 2 cups chicken boullion, 1/2 cup vitamin D milk instead of whipping cream (to make it lower fat) & 2 small cans of pumpkin. Even when using the canned pumpkin, be sure to blend in the blender. It helps the onion blend into the soup and not be so chunky. This seems like a great recpe to freeze in a freezer bag, so I did! :)

Lovely! Scrumptious! Filling!  I added 1 tbsp of curry powder to spice this up some more along with half a can of mixed vegetables. Quite good. If you love curry, try adding 1/2 to 2 tbsp as desired. I sprinkled 3 dashes of ground nutmeg during the second simmer.   Good stuff!!

I added a chopped potato and a small chopped carrot without increasing the amount of liquid.  Also used a bit of whole milk instead of cream - it didn't need much.  Last of all, added about half a tablespoon of chopped ginger and half teaspoon of cayanne at the blending stage.  Was amazing!

Very impressed with the excellent flavor. I would not have thought to use thyme but it adds a great note to the soup.  Once you get past peeling the pumpkin, not my favorite kitchen task, it is easy-peasee to make.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Simple hearty flavors make this pumpkin soup. I was looking for something that wasn't the typical cinnamon/nutmeg/sweet spices. This was right on target and the recipe is VERY FLEXIBLE. I added some extra garlic & red pepper flakes, left the salt out, and for the second half of the cook I added some chopped vegetables with a little more pumpkin (would have added other squash also if I had some). It turned out delicious and my husband would even eat this (he normally shies away from all veggie dishes)

I thought this soup was way to salty, and I followed the recipe exactly.  I'm not sure what the problem was -- next time I'll leave out the added salt!  It seems to have potential, though, so I'll make it again!

For vegetarians - substitue coconut milk for the cream.  And if you don't want to puree the entire pot of soup - it helps to puree the onions after you sautee them.  I didn't find in necessary to puree anything else.  Serve with a rosemary baguette.  Delish!

DELICIOUS! i cooked this soup for my boyfriend and his roommate, who was skeptical to taste it.  he ended up eating two heaping bowls!  i had to beg them to save me some leftovers!  i baked the pumpkin in the oven first, so it would be easy to cut.

Super easy to make and very good!  I didn't puree it and it still came out very smooth and creamy.  I used ground pepper instead of peppercorns and onion flakes instead of chopped onion.  I will definitely make this again

Absolutely delicious! My dad and husband who are very picky keep asking me to make it again. I used a hand held smoothie mixer right in the pot instead of the blender and it saved a lot of time.

I have to say at first the sound of pumpkin soup did not appeal to me at all. But the more I heard of people making it, the more curious I became to try it. This recipe was so easy to make and it tastes so good. It is now one of my favorite soups.

I love anything pumpkin and have been looking for a pumpkin soup recipe - mmmm, this recipe is so easy to make and has such a savory taste.  I sautÃ©ed the onions and garlic and for personal taste I added a pinch of ground ginger and cinnamon. Definitely a keeper! Thanks so much for sharing!

I love this savory pumpkin soup recipe. I also like to add rosemary and a dash of red pepper. Sometimes I'll use greek yogurt or sour cream and some milk or half and half instead of the heavy cream to make it tangy. I also learned that it's easier to get the pumpkin from the skin if I half or quarter it and put it in the oven at 350 until it gets soft enough to easily peel.

Sometimes I'll use greek yogurt or sour cream and some milk or half and half instead of the heavy cream to make it tangy. I also learned that it's easier to get the pumpkin from the skin if I half or quarter it and put it in the oven at 350 until it gets soft enough to easily peel.

Great recipe. I sautÃ©ed the onions, thyme, peppercorns, and garlic before adding the  chicken stock and pumpkin puree. My fiancee, 14 year old, and six year old loved it!

This is a great recipe for pumpkin soup, although i did make some adjustments to my personal taste. It was DELICIOUS! I halved the recipe and used 3 cups chicken broth (from bouillon cubes, did not add extra salt), i minced some onion and red bell pepper and sauted it with the garlic before adding the broth and pumpkin (probably used about 3 cups pumpkin puree). also added 2 bay leaves, some ground ginger, and cayenne pepper to up the flavor, before i did i thought it seemed like it still needed something.  I also used milk instead of heavy cream and it was the perfect consistency. I will definitely make this again!!

From the beginning I knew I was going to add hot sausage to this soup. I had never had pumpkin soup, so I tasted it before adding the sausage. Then I tasted it after adding the sausage and liked it so much better! This will be a great fall and winter soup for my husband and me. (I did use dried thyme.)

I added 3/4 cup of brown sugar to bring out a little sweetness. I think I will be serving it the month of October in my restaurant.

I added a little chilli powder, and also some cinnamon and nutmeg.  Those flavor did really nicely in this dish.  I also left out the dairy (being lactose intolerant) and it was still superb.

Great dish. I pureed roasted pumpkin not completely smooth and added a little canned pumpkin. It deepened the color. I used ginger, thyme,black pepper, salt ,nutmeg and cayenne for a little kick. I like the way it felt in the mouth. Wonderful.

I grew sugar pumpkins in order to make pies for Thanksgiving. Unfortunately, they didn't ripen in time. . . So, I now have pumpkin to use for other things. We've never had pumpkin soup before. This is an excellent -- smooth, rich and flavorful . I did change it up a bit (inspired by Craig's a Pumpkin Soup recipe)-- I sauted the onion and garlic in a pat of butter and small amount of olive oil. I added grated carrots and potatoes and sauted about 5 minutes. Added the stock, thyme, salt and pepper and simmered for about 20 minutes. Added cooked/purÃ©ed pumpkin and dash of nutmeg until heated through. Blended, simmered, added combo of half & half and 2% milk.  Delicious !

I modified this recipe for today's Thanksgiving meal and it is yummy!!!!  I didn't add any cream and it definitely doesn't need it.  I added two medium sweet potatoes, a cup of water, extra thyme and two extra cloves of garlic.  Delicious for Thanksgiving or any cold fall or winter night.  I also sauteed the chopped (yellow) onion, garlic, and thyme before adding it to the chicken stock. I also make my own chicken stock.  Since I knew I would be using the stock for this recipe, I added half of a bunch of thyme to the stock.  The depth of flavor in this modified version of the soup is wonderful!  The soup is rich, creamy and flavorful.

My husband and I really liked this soup! A lot of the low reviews say that it is bland, we didn't find it bland, but its flavors (other than the pumpkin) are subtle. Also, its a good idea not to use this as a main course because it is a bit light; we paired it with homemade bread and that worked well for us but we were hungry later that evening. 

I made a few modifications: I added about 1/4 tsp nutmeg, I only used 1/3 c heavy cream, I added an extra 1/2 cup of onion and 2 extra cloves garlic (because we love onion and garlic) and the onion and garlic still did not overpower the pumpkin. I also added 1/2 a tbsp of sugar. I would NOT add the sugar again, we aren't a fan of sweet soups and this addition brought it close to our sweet level limit. If you give it the time the recipe recommends to let the garlic and onion cook down in the broth it'll give nice flavor and release the sweetness in the pumpkin. One more note! I used an emersion blender instead of spooning it into my food processor. Its so much easier, if you make a lot of soup I highly recommend investing in one!

I will make this for my family when they come visit for the holidays. =)

This recipe was delicious. I don't normally like anything pumpkin but this smelled so good I had to try some. I think I may have written the recipe down wrong cause it came out really really watery so I chopped up a few small potatoes and threw them in to cook. Once cooked I used a immersion blender to puree it a second time and it thickened up nicely.

this was great!  much better than our previous pumpkin soup.  I did add 1/2 t garam masala as per other reviews, and it was prefect.   Also, skipped the whipping cream and added a dollop of sour cream to each bowl.  warm and filling.

Love love love this recipe! I have been making it for the last three years or so and its a wonderful and super EASY way to have pumpkin! I always use fresh pumpkin (3.5-4 cups chopped) and you can freeze it and make again when you can't buy the little pumpkins! 

I use a little extra garlic (3 cloves), use 4 cups of chicken broth ( a carton) and add two cups of water with a cube for vegetable broth. I usually use dried thyme/parsley.  I've tried it with both coconut milk or skim milk and its turned out great..  To turn it into a complete and HEALTHY meal.. I add about a cup (maybe a bit more) of white kidney beans just before adding the milk and blend it with the hand blender.. now thats clean eating!! :)

This recipe was not to my liking.

Like other reviews said. The Garlic and Onion overpowered this, even though I coulded down the onion and garlic clove first.

I used fresh homeade chicken stock, I looked at some of the suggestions from other people who made this, added ginger and Nutmeg, tried adding cinnamon and even some maple syrup.

We do not like this recipe.  We used a "Chickenless" stock that has been very, very successful in the past.  We followed the recipe.  We added the bay leaf and the peanut butter as per the comments suggested.  The soup did not taste good.  We tried adding various spices and sugar for a pumpkin pie flavour, but that didn't work.  By the time we added curry and cumin--our usually successful resuscitation of all soup recipes--it just tasted bad.

Go with what some of the other reviews said.......sautee the minced onion and garlic in some EVOO or butter BEFORE adding it to the rest of the stock.  


I followed the recipe exactly and the onion and garlic were completely overpowering the flavor of the pumpkin.  It tasted like raw onion and garlic.

I think the best part of this soup is how easy it is to make. And by being so basic it allows you to add a variety of seasonings to give it a multitude of flavors.  I gave it 4 out of 5 just b/c I felt it needed a little more seasoning.  I added some kosher salt to taste, fresh grated nutmeg and ground black pepper (rather than whole peppercorns) to the thyme.  The other change I made was substituting half the pumpkin puree for steamed sweet potato which worked really well.  A very tasty and versatile soup! I will definitely make it again.

I found this recipe last year on my first exploration of Allrecipes via Google search for pumpkin soup.  I had a big pumpkin for Halloween decoration and didn't want to throw it away. This is an excellent recipe and had to find it again for this Thanksgiving.  One out of twenty guests didn't love it!  My 10 year old daughter asked me to make it again this year so here I am, joining.... so that I can save the recipe where I'm sure to be able to find it again!

It was OK.  Not the best I've ever had.  I've had fresh, organic pumpkin soup from a very reputable gourmet food company and it was literally "to die for".  I couldn't keep my husband and his friend from hogging it all.  This recipe did not hold a flame to that.  My husband and his same friend had zero interest in this soup.  I will keep looking for a pumpkin soup that will get me closer to heaven.

Just made this soup and it is very delicious!  Mine turned out kinda brown cause I used homemade chicken broth to which I had added onion skins for flavor.  I made 2 changes to the recipe due to what I had on hand.  Did not have heavy cream, used 1/2 large block cream cheese.  Also added 1 teaspoon of Garam Marsala, just cause it was recommended by others and had never tried using it in anything and had it on my spice shelf waiting for just the right recipe.  This soup is very unique and lovely, warm and fragrant

Very easy, tastes amazing! I left everything the same except no whipping cream because I do not eat dairy. Instead I soaked 1 c. cashews for two hours and blended with the soup in the food processor then cooked with the soup for the remainder of time. Love this recipe, thank you!

A good side dish. Don't think I'll make it again. Too much effort for something so light. I did only put 2% milk instead of heavy whipping cream, so maybe that was the problem.

Loved this pumpkin soup recipe and will definitely use it again. I added one carrot, cubed and about 1/4 cup chopped fresh celery root because they were hanging around in the fridge in with the pumpkin etc. Lovely!

I made my own chicken stock last night and then wanted to finish this soup before I went to class this morning. Just a tip if using a blender, NEVER try to blend hot liquids if your blender manual says not to (I have some burns and a mess in my kitchen to remind me) I put the spices in my chicken stock so all I had to do was add the pumpkin, and since I only had 1 can of pumpkin puree I halved the recipe. I also didn't have any heavy whipping cream on hand, but noted that several reviewers said it was ok to do without it. Overall, a good recipe, but really would've been nice to get a caution on the blender

Wonderful recipe.  I did make one change.  I pureed the onions and garlic before I added them to the pot and didn't puree anything afterwards.  I makes for a nice thick soup.  Great for a cold autumn day.

This is delicious!  I made it for Halloween and I think it will become a tradition!  I did make a slight change.  Instead of cream I used half and half.  Also, at the end of cooking I added browned ground Italian turkley sausage to the soup and boy did that give it a power boost!

Very good soup!  I would recommend using the original recipe.  I halved due to the 9 servings, but was making for lunch so it was more like 4 or 5 bowls. Hearty and easy to make.  I garnished with some toasted pumpkin seeds and ground black pepper.

I've been making this recipe for a while but I make it a tad bit better. Add a pinch of ginger powder. it makes it kind of asian tasting pumpkin soup. REALLY yummy. Everyone wanted seconds when I made this.

The basic recipe is ok, but it really does remind me of potatoe soup, like another reviewer said.  I first added the cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger, as recommended by other reviewers.  Still not satisfied and after doing a bit more research, I added brown sugar and vanilla.  Fabulous.

This soup is easy to make and tastes like it is out of a gourmet restaurant.  I added an extra clove of garlic and since my pumpkin was already mashed I just added it in as is - the full 3 1/2 cups.  Served with homemade bread it was a perfect lunch.

After reading how great this recipes is I was shocked when I actually tasted it.  To salvage the soup last minute I added a can of cream of chicken soup, about a pound of brown sugar and large amount of cinnimon, this made it ALOT better

A great base soup.  I changed a little... I mixed butternut squash and the pumpkin and added a touch of cayanne for a little kick.  Very nice and the texture was great!

I'm not sure I can honestly review this recipe, because I left out a couple of spices and I used cream of chicken instead of broth. I also don't really like soup much, but I liked this a LOT. Since the cream of chicken made it so thick, I watered it down a little. Also, since I didn't have all the spices on hand, I just added more of what I did have. I wasn't sure I'd like this soup, but I had to try it! I never knew chicken and pumpkin flavors actually blended well together. It's so warm, creamy, and flavorful, it would make a great meal on a cool autumn night.

I only used a quart of broth as I didn't want a very thin soup. It was perfect! Rave reviews from all the moms and three of the kids (3-5 y/o). 

I also used a mix of baked acorn squash and sugar pumpkin. I used red onion & sauteed it first to soften it. Omitted the salt.

Definitely will make again. Glad to find such an easy and great recipe to use up some of my winter squash & pumpkins.

We had a "something made with pumpkin day" at work and I brought a crock pot full of this delicious soup in as a treat for my co-workers, I can't remember how many copies of the recipe I handed out.  People who don't even like pumpkin loved it.  Great job!!!

This soup was delicious and perfect for fall. I did cut out all the salt. The chicken stock already has enough salt in it for me. 
I added more parsley, thyme, onion, and garlic. I used about half of the whipping cream too since it didn't really need too much. 
I added about a teaspoon of ground ginger, nutmeg, and ground cloves as other people suggested. I also added half a tsp. of cinnamon and some garlic powder, onion powder and pepper too. I think this added a lot of flavor to the soup. 
I also didn't cook it the extra 30 minutes since it didn't seem like it needed it. I then topped it with blue cheese. In the end, the soup was awesome, and I'll definitely make it again. It went really well with the cranberry walnut slaw recipe on this site.

It has potential.  Made it per the directions, but it turned out too salty.  I ended up seasoning it with honey, garlic powder, onion powder, ginger, and extra fresh ground pepper.  Still wasn't impressed. 

If I make this again, I will be omitting the salt completely.

This is great! Next time I'll try some of the spices and a little peanut butter like others suggested, but I followed the exact recipe and I love it, eating it with a sandwhich for lunch right now.

Good, satisfying, easy soup! It can be "skinnied up" by substituting skim milk for the cream if you like. It's very tasty and savoury either way.

This soup is just right!  I have to admit that I didn't have time for the second 30 minutes of simmering, and it worked out great just the same.  Unlike other pumkin soup recipes that I have tried, this really cooks down--by almost half, I would say.  I made a half recipe, and barely managed to get three servings out of it.  The other changes that I made were to use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth (I'm a vegetarian) and dried thyme (half of the amount of fresh called for), because that's all that I had on hand.  I also garnished with a dollop of sour cream, which worked well.  I will definitely make this recipe again!

We loved this soup.  Wasn't to sure about it at first but it turned out great.  Be careful with the amount of salt you put in because the broth has salt in it also.

I was so impressed by all the reviews of this recipe that I thought that I would give it a try; I used canned pumpkin and a boullion cube--perhaps where I went wrong--and the soup came out with too much salt and too little pumpkin flavor. The cream helped on the salt end of the problem, and the croutons I made to accompany it made things a bit more exciting, but still, not the best I've had.

For several years I have made a similar version of this soup,  and it is always a family favorite.  I find that using an immersion blender is preferable to transferring the soup to a blender or food processor, which is generally messy.    After pureeing the soup, I add  a small package of smoked sausage or Polish kielbasa, cut into bit size pieces and the heavy cream then let it simmer for 30 minutes.  Serve with a hot, crusty bread.  Perfect autumn meal.

Great soup! will do it again for sure, ii was my first time making this soup and was so impressed on how delicious it turned out. I didnt have whipped cream or heavy cream, so i just added a bit of cream cheese which helped thicken and didnt modify the flavours at all.

Guys - I don't understand the good reviews.   Do you have to use fresh pumpkin or something?  I used canned & did not care for this soup at all.

Great soup, but needed more flavor--I added plenty of ginger. Made it two days before Thanksgiving and was able to simmer it for a few hours before serving (added cream later). Used fresh pumpkin--and learned that with fresh you need to DOUBLE (8 cups) the pumpkin in order to get the desired density. Fresh pumpkin is so watery! Will make this often, it was a hit with all the guests and family!

I couldn't find my thyme but found this a bit bland. I added chili powder and increased the salt (used low sodium broth).  If I make it again, I will saute the onions in butter, add garlic at the end of the saute, and then add the remaining ingredients.

I love pumpkin everything but have never found a pumpkin soup recipe I like until now. This is what I believe pumpkin soup should taste like. I used evaporated milk instead of cream and black pepper instead of peppercorns (because that's what I had). Next time I'll cut back on the thyme just a bit. Really very good.

This was delicious!  Definitely keeping this recipe.  We used a combo of red onion & shallot as well as upping the garlic. We used fresh pumpkin puree as we grow pumpkins and it is so easy to make.  You just cannot compare fresh to canned IMHO  :)  
As we were already pureeing the pumpkin, we just added the onion, garlic, parsley & peppercorns to the processor so we just had to add it to the stock avoiding the 2nd step.  First time we topped with crushed croutons and the second time with some grated cheddar & parmesan cheese.  
Will make again next fall when the harvest is ready!

Delicious! I followed the recipe; except I added two small onions and several garlic cloves. I roasted the onions and garlic in the oven prior to adding them and it made them super sweet. This is very similar to my pumpkin soup recipe. So simple and basic, but completely delicious.

I made this wonderful savory pumpkin soup but left out the cream. It was so yummy! I'm making it again very soon! I did add some ground bay powder to the recipe (ground up a medium bay leaf in my herb (coffee) grinder).  I'd love to find some other savory variations.

It was a good soup and easy to make. No need to puree the soup. It was good enough. I made it for Halloween dinner. Next time, though, I would like to eliminate the heavy cream. Most recipes for pumpkin soup do call for it. The coconut milk suggestion is excellent and healthier. Will try that next time.

SOUP-er yummy!

A few things to change:
~ SautÃ©e the onion in a Tbsp of oil before adding other ingredients. It adds some sweetness.
~ De-stem & mince thyme before adding. It will blend better, and add more flavor throughout cooking.
~ Bloom garlic and thyme before adding other ingredients. It brings out the flavor.
~ Don't bother with the peppercorns... just used freshly ground black pepper. It will blend better.
~ Add some shredded sharp cheddar cheese when serving.

I used fat-free Half & Half instead of the whipping cream.  I also did not puree it- my family likes things thicker/chunkier.  I also added about 1/4 cup of barley for a little more texture, and a pinch of cinnamon.
Great!

Made it as per recipe, cream and all! Skipped peppercorns and added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg.  It was terrific!

Only thing I changed was I used canned pumpkin and garlic powder. I did also admit the peppercorn because I'm not a huge fan. The soup was pretty bland. I wish I'd had some pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon to add. Looked deliciousâ¦ But the taste left something to be desired. All I could taste was the chicken stock.

I made it as posted, but I roasted some sugar pumpkins instead of using canned pumpkin, then I added two tablespoons of Franks Red Hot, and a pinch of cumin to give it some kick.  Also, U used an immersion blender to puree the soup before I added the cream.  sprinkled a few chopped chives and the top and served with crusty bread.  It came out awesome.. The kids loved it and  so did my wife.

My only issue with my soup versus the picture of the soup on this website, is mine did not look as thick.  With no potatoes or other thickener, I'm not sure how to make it look as thick.  

I used sage instead of thyme because I love sage and it's such an autumn herb.  I finished it with coconut cream to keep it dairy free.  It added a wonderful flavor to the soup

We found it a bit bland as written.  I added ginger, Garam Masala and cumin to get a flavour that we really liked.  The flavour boost after the addition of the cream was significant.  This is a great base recipe that can go many directions.

I made this per the directions in the AR magazine.  I used 1 - 29 oz. can of pumpkin puree and 1/8 tsp. ground black pepper.  I added a couple shakes of nutmeg and ginger, and I added brown sugar to taste at the end with the heavy cream.  I added an extra splash of cream just before serving.  Also, I served this with Ginger Thin cookies, very tasty.
I will make this again, it is good both hot and cold.  I think it tasted better the next day.

I used an immersion blender so I didn't have to remove the soup from the pot.  I followed the suggestions in Allrecipes Magazine and added a few shakes of ginger and nutmeg after blending and 2 tablespoons of brown sugar after adding the cream.  I also added a few shakes of dried parsley and garnished with pepitas.  Next time I will try using 1/4 cup of cream instead.

3 tbls butter; 1/2 can beef broth, scant amount of white pepper (didn't use peppercorns), ginger, cinnamon and nutmeg.

Was making this for a neighbor who has cancer and needed nourishment and calories.  He couldn't swallow whole foods.

I did the lazy girls way of making this. Combined 1 can purÃ©ed pumpkin, 2 cans chicken stock, 1 tbls each of salt, parsley, onion powder, and garlic powder. Whisk all together over medium heat (whisk occasionally while cooking ) and let
It boil off long enough to get as thick as you would like it then add in a couple spoonfuls of sour cream (that's what I had on hand). 
It was delicious! The only thing that would have made this better would have been some pumpkin seeds added to garnish and put some chunk into the bites.

Yummy and easy to make. Used one can of pumpkin puree which was 3.5 cups and reduced chicken broth to 4 cups. I garnished the soup with cinnamon toast croutons.  This was a trial run but plan to make it again for Thanksgiving.:)

I used this as a base. I did add the thyme but next time I think I will omit. I'm trying to produce a soup like Egg Harbor's Autumn Pumpkin. I sautÃ©ed the onion, 3 good size garlic cloves and 2 chopped celery stalks and a little shredded carrot, then added the pumpkin and low sodium chicken broth. I also added fresh ground mixed pepper corns, white pepper, cumin, curry, a bay leaf, ground sea salt, a touch of cinnamon and coriander. After simmering for a bit, I used an immersion blender. I let the soup cool and then reheated later for dinner. I did not add cream or milk as I didn't think it necessary.

The PERFECT fall soup recipe! Savory, sweet, creamy, comforting! I omitted the parsley (not a fan of parsley) and added a tablespoon of ginger paste, and a little extra garlic (my family would eat it raw if I would let them!)... Everything else the same. My kids now BEG for this soup! Thank you for this recipe! The subtle thyme, ginger, pumpkin, creamy goodness is the perfect warm up dinner for a snow day or the best get-everyone-to-the-table fall after school before sports dinner!

I made this under the assumption that it probably wouldn't be great, because its such a simple recipe. But I was happily wrong. This is a very savory recipe, and its delicious fresh and leftover. 

Alterations: I added a bit less thyme than the recipe calls for, because it started smelling more like a sauce than a soup. Also, I don't think heavy whipping cream is necessary for the success of the recipe. It may make it a little richer, but it did little to the consistency that I could tell.

This is simply delicious.  I sautÃ©ed the onions, garlic, and thyme in a little butter first then added everything to my Vitamix.  I didn't have peppercorns so I just used regular pepper.  I also omitted the cream.  It's a keeper for sure!!!

We had enough fresh pumpkin puree leftover from making pies that we used it in this soup. I don't know if it was the fresh pumpkin that made this so special, but even with the bother of roasting and preparing the pumpkin I would definitely make this again. Very special.

It tasted more like thickened chicken stock soup, which wasn't bad, just not enough Iike pumpkin soup. I'll keep trying recipes.

What a great recipe!  I prepared this for Thanksgiving and the family demanded it again for Christmas Eve dinner.  I tripled the minced garlic and added freshly ground pepper, rather than peppercorns.  By utilizing canned pumpkin puree, which contains nothing but 100% pumpkin puree, there was no need to utilize the blender or food processor.

Did not taste like pumpkin at all even though I used more pumpkin than the recipe called for.  Was very salty tasting...I think omit the salt if you're using salted broth.

Really tasty! I've wanted to try pumpkin soup for a while and glad I chose this recipe. I didn't have fresh herbs and I sauteed some celery with the onions and only had half & half on hand.  Really tasty.  Did I say that already?  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I just made this recipe for my hubby.  I almost forgot the heavy cream! He loved it and had two huge bowls.  I added an extra can of Pumpkins Puree for a total of 3 cans. Also 1/2 tsp. of red pepper flakes for a little spice.  Easy and quick. I will be making this each fall!

I loved this soup, but I made a few changes.  I added about 1/2 cup of apple cider to soup after puree process.  I also added pumpkin pie spice.  Instead of cream I added 1/3 of a can of fat free evaporated milk.  The recipe was simple but very tasty!

I like to add a dollop of plain, nonfat Greek yogurt for the "cream" part of the recipe. This basic recipe  is good, and my tweaks were minor ones.

Pretty good. Simmered for 30 minutes. Any longer and it would have turned back into purÃ©e. Will sautÃ© veggies first next time. Recommend not leaving out cream. It's only one tablespoon per serving anyway and it adds a lot of flavor. Nice for lunch or an easy dinner.

This was pretty good. I let mine reduce a bit, as is I found it a bit too thin for my taste. Using pureed pumpkin I found the blender not necessary. 

A tip I use to get "roasted" flavour out of canned pureed pumpkin is to spray a 9x9 glass dish with Pam, then put the puree in it and pop it in the oven for about 20 minutes until the edges get as browned and bubbly as you like, then throw it in the soup. Yes it's an extra step but it takes nothing and you can do other things while its baking. Scrape all the little browned bits in, it really makes a difference. Canned pumpkin is still an excellent product, and much easier to handle.

I have made this soup in the past with RAVE reviews.  I made 3 gallons of it for a large Thanksgiving and barely got to have a small cup of it for myself. Most people were leery of it but tried it anyway and loved it. I added sage sausage and dried sage and curry as well. I have also made it with 4 tablespoons of DiSarono added and that was the biggest hit of all. This is a staple of our Thanksgiving dinner.

This was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except I replaced the heavy whipping cream with cream of coconut to make it dairy-free.  Instead of peppercorns, I just sprinkled in some ground black pepper.  I will definitely be making this again!!

I used homemade pumpkin.  I added red pepper flakes, cumin and substituted 3 ounces of light cream cheese instead of the cream (I didn't have any in the house). I just used a hand mixer and left it a little chunky.   I also added about 1 cup of cooked diced chicken. Served it with homemade bread.  My husband thought it looked "funny" but said he liked it!!

This is an absolutely delicious recipe! I used 3 cloves of garlic instead of one, 8 cups of raw pumpkin like another reviewer suggested, and five new potatoes, diced. The garlic helped the flavor a lot. And I left out the milk for lower calories. It tasted buttery even without any butter.

I've now made this recipe twice from fresh pumpkin and feel it's missing a bit of body. So, I added extra black pepper and garlic, Madras Curry Powder, 1 t fresh ground ginger, Cholula hot sauce, butter and pumpkin pie spice. Cholula is more sweet than hot but does give the soup a little kick. Delicious!

The timing listed is inaccurate as it doesn't account for the time it takes to puree the soup in small batches. Also, if you're using fresh pumpkin, it will take time to cut, cook and puree (I just use a potato masher).

I have had a 10-year-long craving for pumkin soup ever since I tried it on a cruise in 2001!  I had been meaning to try and make it myself, but thought it would take too long.  I finally tried it and it wasn't too hard afterall.  I thought that the soup was delicious, although not *quite* as good as what I remember it being.  I added some allspice, cinnimon, and nutmeg to this recipe, but I think that I might have gotten a little bit carried away on the amounts.  To try and tone it down, I added more half and half.  Unfortunately, my husband (who is lactose intolerant) got sick everytime he ate it.  Oops!  At least that meant more for me. :)

I can't say that I like the recipe as is as much as I thought I would, which is why I gave it 3 stars.  After reading some of the reviews and trying some of the suggestions that were given I think I may have found what I like. Ginger gives it a little heat, which tastes very good. (I was gonna try cayenne next if the ginger didn't work...that seems like it could do the trick as well.) Cinnamon does something nice to the soup, too. I tried putting a little brown sugar in, too...just a little though, because I don't know if too much sweetness would help. Cumin...not really for me. I like cumin alot, but it didn't seem to work in the soup.  So for me, ginger, cinnamon, and a little brown sugar really helped. I tried sour cream, too. That wasn't the ticket.

Not fond of this soup.  I used canned pumpkin puree--maybe that was the taste issue.  Not planning to make this again, but if i do i will buy a fresh pumpkin.

I agree with those that used less stock.  I used 4 cups for a smaller, thicker batch.  Simple, tasty recipe!

My husband loved this. Enough for me to make for a cold winter lunch. This is rich and I may try to use lighter cream next time. WOW!!!

This soup was really bland,  I think I maybe should have tweaked it but I wanted to try the recipe without messing with it.  Maybe next time I will add more thyme.  The cream made it soooo smooth and delicious...but still bland.

1st time I made this, it was a disaster; way too salty, way too thick, and no pumpkin flavor.  It must really depend on the exact items you use.  The second time around I used vegetable stock  instead (and cut back on the onion to compensate) and only added a 1/4 t of salt.  I also ended up adding at least an extra cup of water.  It came out perfect!

I did a smaller portion and I already had pureed pumpkin...I simmered 2 cups of pureed pumpkin, 4 cups of chicken broth, with sauteed onions and garlic (in olive oil)  I added the spices in the recipe to taste - plus I seasoned with the nutmeg to taste as well.  I brought to a boil, and then simmered for 30 minutes, at the end  I also substituted the heavy cream with non-fat condensed milk- it turned out great and made it lower in fat.  It is really a great recipe!  Very savory with the taste of pumpkin throughout

I had a lot of leftover pumpkin innards after halloween, so I thought I would give this recipe a shot. I did a few things differently- sauteed the onion before adding pumpkin and stock, used half vegetable and half chicken stock, and added extra garlic and peppercorns. It is absolutely fantastic. This is definitely going to be my official after halloween use-up-the-pumpkin recipe. :-D

I found this recipe to be very good!  EXCEPT I did not follow the recipe exactly with the spices, and I wish I had.  I didnt use real peppercorns either just regular pepper.  Mine turned out too spicy because I did not follow the recipe but still very good.  I did not serve this to anyone else because of the spice but I did enjoy it.  Also I only put in 4 cups of chicken stock and 2 cups of heavy whipping cream and it turned out delicious and creamy!! Follow the recipe for the spices!  =)

This recipe is awesome if you enjoy creamy potato soup but would like to switch it up a bit. The pumpkin taste is only slightly noticeable. If by any chance you're apprehensive about trying this recipe because you worry you'll feel like you're eating a pumpkin pie or heck, a watered down jack-o-lantern for that matter, you've got nothing to worry about (I myself can't stand pumpkin pie, but I love this stuff!). My fiance and I both agreed this recipe is awesome, but might be even better if there were cubes of potatoes added in at the start of the 2nd simmer to give this a bit more substance and something to bite into.  If you don't have plans on using the other 1/2 of your pumpkin or the other 1/2 of the pint of whipping cream, it'd be in your best interest to double this recipe to save more money and possibly have left-overs for later if your family doesn't eat the whole pot in one sitting. I only made a single batch because the recipe writer claimed this made 9 servings (HA! The max for a single batch is 4 servings in my opinion). In addition to using vegetable broth in place of the chicken broth and totally eliminating the salt, I also used a potato masher rather than pureeing the soup in a blender. This gave the soup a little bit of texture and meant fewer dishes for me to clean later. ;)

This is very good.  I had to make my own veg stock, instead of chicken and otherwise, did it like the recipe said.  It is yummy.

I did not care for this at all although I did like the creamy texture.  I followed the directions exactly but I used fresh pumpkin puree and that could be the reason for the awful taste.  I hate to waste food so I tried to salvage it by adding brown sugar and cinnamon.  That made it edible but it still tasted bad.

I wasn't judicious enough with my seasoning.  I put in 2 bay leafs briefly before rethinking it in favor of about 3 shakes each of cinnamon and nutmeg.  Also, used 2 tbl of the heavy whipping cream and whole milk for the rest.  It was good and I quite liked it, but it was not the best pumpkin soup ever.

I have been making this every year for Thanksgiving.  Everyone initially says "yuck, no thanks". But then they try it and love it, even the kids.  Instead of the fresh pumpkin I use two cans of pumpkin (not pumpkin pie filling).  And instead of transferring it to a blender I use an emulsion blender right in the pot.  A lot less messy.  Make extra for the next day!!

Super good and easy recipe!  I was lazy and substituted dried minced onion, garlic powder, dried thyme, dried parsley, and ground pepper and it still turned out fabulous!  I pureed the pumpkin in a blender instead of a food processor.  I bet with fresh ingredients it's even better!

Easy to make.  I actually left the tiny onion pieces whole without processing them.  They came out perfect.  I too added a little nutmeg and used fresh cracked pepper instead of peppercorns.  My boyfriend and I loved it.  Was good heated the next day too.  The thicker soup was nice.  Not runny.  Heart and savory.

You can make this soup with any winter squash and it would be good. I add in roasted garlic and a seasoning blend instead of the thyme, and I do saute the onions until they're just browning. I have high blood pressure and must cut down on salt; I use low sodium stocks or broth. Winter Squash and Pumpkin can be bland without some salt, but a few extra shakes of black pepper seem to help a lot. I also don't add in cream, it seems thick enough without it--this also helps cut down on fat content. 
This soup can easily be doubled or tripled, it's freezes well. It's a great soup that can be made adjusted for sodium or fat restricted diets, you can adjust the seasoning to suit yourself, and it can be made in large batches. And most important--it's really easy to make!

Simple, warming, great taste, everything a soup should be. 
The only thing difference I made was not to puree it as we liked the texture.
Thank you

Very good pumpkin soup.  I think it could have been a bit creamier, but the taste was delicious.

This was the first time I made pumpkin soup. I would have given it 5 stars up until I added the cream. As the broth/pumpkin mixture was simmering, it tasted awesome. I would have never guessed that onion and garlic would go with pumpkin. Once I added the cream, the taste went kind of bland. So I added some brown sugar and pumpkin pie spice. I didn't really like the flavor this added. I will however try it again with less cream, maybe curry, more onion/garlic and maybe even other veggies like carrots or squash. Since I didn't have enough chicken broth, I added 2 cups of water with 2 pkg of veg. boullion.

Easy and delicious.  I used fresh pumpkin, left out the thyme, added ginger and curry powder, and didn't blend because it was already smooth.  I recommend this recipe if you have a lot of pumpkin you want to use up!

Very good recipe, but I agree with other posters that it's a bit bland. However, this is a great recipe for a base on which you can get creative. I added strips of chicken in the original cooking, fished it out, and THEN blended the remainder. After adding the cream, I put in a good amount of fresh ginger (a little less than a tablespoon) and a 1/2 teaspoon of good high-quality curry. I then re-added the cooked chicken and cooked it down at simmer for another 15 minutes. Made an absolutely wonderful think soup that sticks to your ribs or even could be put over rice and served as a pumpkin-curry chicken. Definitely a keeper recipe, but only after some futzing. Go ahead! Get creative on this one!

I've never attempted pumpkin soup before, but the reviews prompted me to give it a go.  The changes I made were to add 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon, & nutmeg as so many reviewers suggested.  It was still a very bland soup.  One of my kids liked it, the other 5 disliked it so as far as kid friendly... I thought it was just ok, but my husband really dsiliked this.  We all like pumpkin, but this soup was just flat.  It needs something...  We had rolls for dinner and decided to not attempt this recipe again.

Hello all.  I have a question about pumpkin Soup.  Does anyone know of a recipe that uses canned pumpkin?  The recipe above is excellent; however, I need something quick and easy for a large dinner party.

This was exceptional.  My family loved it and we were impressed with the ease of the preparation.  I will probably make this soup often.  I made homemade croutons with some left over french bread, which turned out to be a great addtion.

Gut a pumpkin from neighbor. Asked me to make pumpkin soup for her. Found this recipe, small adjustment based on what I have at that time; I used two onions, two chicken cubes, 4 cups water and one table spoon cooking cream. Easy to follow and yummy. I roasted the pumpkin with olive oil, some pepper, thyme and cloves of garlic. Thank you!

I enjoyed this soup but adapted the recipe for me. I used can organic pumpkin and used vegetable stock instead of chicken stock since Iâm vegetarian. I also just let it cool in the pan and used an immersion blender because it is so much easier and makes for quick clean up. Good soup for fall.

There is ZERO reason to puree this soup if you use canned pumpkin (which I did)  unless you like extra labor and more cleanup (I don't).  It lacks depth and complexity  so I added some ingredients to it.  Some vegetable base and some roasted garlic base, onion powder, a bit of sage, a couple bay leaves and a touch of cayenne to slightly warm the tongue.  I also topped it with roasted pumpkin seeds.  I ground the peppercorns as well.

Creamy, delicious, and very easy to make! I used canned pumpkin purÃ©e and looking forward to trying with fresh pumpkin. The only modifications (based on other comments) was to add a dash of powdered ginger and to garnish with crumbled bacon plus drizzle of olive oil. Also blending (high speed) in the Vitamix for ~1min was key to get the creaminess.

Based on other reviews, I tried using less stock, so I used 5 cups instead of 6.  Had a slightly strong chicken taste, so next time Iâm going to try using vegetable stock instead.
It was really good and we all enjoyed it.  Thank you.

I had a partial bag of baby carrots in the fridge that needed used, so I tossed them in.  Probably around a cup and a half or so, and then used my immersion blender to blend it all at the end.  Also put in some bay leaves and red pepper flakes.   Delicious!

Delicious pumpkin soup recipe.  Iâve cooked this more than a dozen times.  Turns out wonderfully if you just follow the recipe.  I accidentally used red onions once instead of white, and the flavor was ever-so-slightly richer, but not in any way fundamentally different.  I was worried it would be too sweet, but no.  Red or white onions:  use whatever you have.  Also, this soup pairs very nicely with toasted sourdough bread with butter...or San Francisco Boudin sourdough bread untoasted.

Comes out great each time; I love how time is allowed for the flavors to blend. I follow another user's suggestion and sautee about half the onions and add after using an emulsion blender. The little chips of browned onions are a nice addition!

The taste of pumpkin was a little too strong for me. I like pumpkin soups that have other ingredients to tone down the pumpkin flavor.

made this for a party and served it in a hollowed out pumpkin. it was a huge hit.  I did tweak the recipe a bit.  used a bit more garlic and one cup of heavy cream.  I used an emersion (stick) blender to puree the soup.  this recipe will be added to my list of favorite soups.

I love this soup. I've been making it for years.  A couple things I've learned:  you can use 6 cups of broth or stock or 6 cups water and 4 bullion cubes. 
I use a whole roasted pumpkin. Its probably about 4 cups but no need to measure.
I also make a rue between the puree process and the second boil. To do this I puree the soup and put it into a large bowl. I put 3-4 tbsp butter with 2-3 tbsp flour in the bottom of the pot I was cooking with and stir as the butter melts. I add the soup back slowly, about 1/3 at a time mixing completely each time. This thickens up the soup considerably.

Have to rate this soup because I have served it so many times.  The broth and cream make it not so 'pumpkiny' as other pumpkin soups, and I always serve it with roasted pumpkin seeds and croutons to sprinkle on top.  
Pureeing the entire batch of soup is messy and a little annoying, so I've simplified it by leaving the pumpkin out of the first step. After the onions are soft, I just strain them out and puree them separately. Then I put this puree back into the broth, add the pumpkin to simmer the second time.

I used vegetable stock instead of chicken stock to keep with the earthy, vegetable type flavor palette. I also used basil instead of thyme because I didn't have any. I omitted the parsley, because it's basically useless as it just garnishes the top to make it look fancy. Oh yeah, I only had 4 cups of the vegetable stock. That's probably way better than the 6 cups that the recipe calls for, which contributed to its thickness. I saw another user's review about it being too thin and watery with the full 6 cups of stock.

It was my first time making it. This recipe was very easy to follow and super easy to actually make. I've never tasted anything so good in my life, I think! I will DEFINITELY be making this again!

Delicious, delicious, delicious. Iâve made this sr real times, including for holiday and dinner parties. It never disappoints. Since itâs it something that can be made ahead, I donât add the cream until I reheat the base shortly before serving.

Very Tasty!  I added a small amount of fresh ginger like 1/4 tsp. and 1/4 cup white wine. Served it with a dollop of sour cream and cracked pepper.

Great with fresh bread!

I tried it as written but the taste wasn't there so I added 1 TSP of poultry seasoning and 1 TBS of brown sugar. I crisped sage leaves in brown butter and used them as garnish along with a dollop of creme fresh.

Surprisingly good!  I wasn't sure If I would like pumpkin soup.  I love pumpkin but associate it with warm spices like cinnamon and cloves.  But this soup proved me wrong.  I used fresh cooked and pureed pumpkin.  The only other change I made was using ground thyme instead of fresh.  This soup is delicious!  After making it, I realized that using the peppercorns instead of ground pepper was ingenious.  The taste was there, but you didn't have all the little black flakes to ruin the beauty of the soup.  I just strained out the peppercorns so no one ate them.  Beautiful, warm and luscious.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Simple recipe that tastes great. I made it twice! Both times I even skipped the post-boiling pureeing because I wanted to simplify the process and avoid making more dirty dishes.  If I had pureed it, the onions would have been smoothed out, so this would have been a little creamier, but the flavor and texture was still very good.  This recipe is a keeper because it is a great way to make use of pumpkin!

Easy with canned pumpkin. I used 1 28 oz can and 32 oz of chicken broth because that's all I had on hand and it's delicious. Considering a teaspoon  or so of sugar next time, but don't want to make it sweet. Great the way it is.

This was OK and probably will not make again.  I was able to use up some pumpkin that needed to be used.  Thanks Lea

Bland. Mediocre. We completely followed the directions. We then added some curry powder. It was a little better, but it was nothing to write home about.

I found this recipe to be way too complicated and time consuming  for the end result. As my husband and I ate the first few spoonsful, we decided it needed some cinnamon and ginger, which I added, and which helped the flavor, but the overall taste and texture was not appetizing.

My whole family loved it! Shouldâve doubled the recipe. Followed the recipe with a few changes: added 1 peeled and diced Granny Smith apple, 1 Tbsp maple syrup, 1.5 times the spices and a pinch of apple pie spice. First I sautÃ©ed the onions, apple, and garlic so the onions would caramelize and give a mildly sweet flavor. I proceeded with the rest of the recipe as written, and toasted up about 1/4 cup of pumpkin seeds for a garnish (the green ones from inside the white pod) and they puffed and crisped up nicely! Put 4 or 5 seeds on each cup of soup. So good, warm, and mellow for an autumn meal. Last comment: if you want to cut calories, put in half the cream...it tastes good even if you leave it out completelyâbut I love it, so it stays in mine!

I had a billion pumpkins sitting around from Halloween, so I grabbed one, cut it in half, scooped the âgutsâ out, then rubbed the flesh with bacon drippings, salt and pepper. Put cut side down on a baking tray and threw it in the oven on 400 for 50 minutes. Came out GREAT, and used the flesh from both sides in the soup. That and a dash of nutmeg added after blending the soup up were my only changes, and even my tremendously picky 4 year old ate it.

Pretty good but not the best ever. Maybe I was looking for more pumpkin flavor or seasoning. If I make it again I would probably throw in some pumpkin pie spice.

I love Pumpkin so I was excited about this soup.  Something about it, however just wasnât great.
Was missing something.  My husband had the idea of adding Sherry.  We tried and it maybe helped a little.  
I will continue to look for a pumpkin soup recipe.

Not a bad soup but could have been better.  After making it and tasting it, I added fresh grated ginger.
POW!  What a difference!  Now that's a soup!

I am giving 3 stars for the base soup (husband gave 2.5).  I thought the base was bland as written. I had to find another recipe (used Cream of Pumpkin Soup from this site) to go find some ideas for adding spices and flavor.  After adding several spices,  and some brown sugar to taste, my husband and I thought it was a good & more flavorful soup.

I made this as written, because I always think that's the best way to go BEFORE casting a review - using ingredients like soy milk, then giving it a single star because it tastes awful doesn't really make sense to me.   When I gave it the first taste test, it was somewhat on the bland side, and needed...something.  I added some additional salt, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg in small quantities until I got the balance right.  The result was still savory, but with more depth of flavor - and of course those flavors always enhance pumpkin.  We had this with turkey provolone sammies for a weeknight dinner, and it was fantastic....it's a great base recipe, and I'll definitely make it again!

I made this as written, minus the heavy cream (lactose intolerant). Although it was edible we really didnât care for this. I wonât be making this again. We will stick to the pumpkin in a pie instead. Sorry.

I used canned pumpkin and doubled the recipe. I ended up using 10 cups of canned and used half vegetable broth for the recipe. The texture was great but this was the most tasteless pumpkin soup. I added dried cloves, nutmeg, red pepper, allspice, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, sherry, brown sugar, more salt, dried thyme, onion powder and probably some things I have forgotten and it was delicious. I wouldn't recommend this recipe as is.

Amazing!! I of course made a few alterations.. I cut the stock down to 4 cups, as it was just going to be for me. Iâm not crazy about pepper, so I left the peppercorns out. Cut the onion down by about half, and used a vidalia. I put in three medium red potatoes, and mashed them near the end. I also added fresh minced garlic, garlic powder, dry minced onion, cumin, coriander, roasted red pepper seasoning, a teaspoon or so of bacon fat, and a half a stick of butter. I used dried thyme and parsley. I did not add the heavy cream until the next day, when I heated up individual servings, as I hate the texture of milk products after theyâve been heated and reheated. Came out perfect for me. If you omit the cream you are definitely missing something. It completes the soup. I added salt and pepper to taste per serving also. I ate every serving within two days so I definitely making this soup again ASAP, hopefully I recreate it perfectly.

I found it bland. The texture is nice. I used half and half instead of heavy cream, and my pumpkin was from fresh pumpkin, not canned (but had been frozen.) Luckily my son is great with spices and we added a curry mixture, cumin, a small pinch of cayenne and some other herbs and spices. It turned out well, but I'll never remember what we did!

This soup was great! My husband and 5 year old also really liked this soup! The only changes I made was to add almond milk instead of cream, because my son can't have dairy. I will definitely make this again!

I did not know it took an hour of simmering when I started and we were hungry. So I kept it at a low boil for the first 30 minutes.  This helped reduce it some. After I pureed it I added half-n-half instead of cream. I let the mixture heat up and then served it without cooking 30 minutes more. We enjoyed it very much and I will make it again.

I used fresh pumpkin but dried parsley. I really liked it but made way too much. I'll see how it holds up after freezing.

Made this soup Allfresh!  Used fresh cooked pumkin & it was perfect.  Followed remaining recipe to the T & pumkin purÃ©ed perfectly.  Made a few cups without sour cream for guests with diary issues.  Soup was the right texture!

easy recipe with lots of flavor.  I made it vegetarian, with vegetable stock and a dollop of peanut butter.  Of the several soups at our fall pot luck, it was the favorite.

Soup was good. First time we've had Pumpkin Soup. We didn't know what to expect. I think the flavor was better before adding the cream.

I doubled the recipe and followed it exactly. I found it very easy to make. But I was very disappointed at the end result as it's a very thin soup consistency not thick at all which is how I imagined it. Next time I make I will reduce the amount of stock. Other than that I found it tasted pretty good.

I sautÃ©ed the garlic and onion in olive oil before adding them to the pot. I added 2 tsp of fresh, chopped cilantro instead of thyme, and added 1 1/2 tsp of ground black pepper instead of peppercorns. It was spicy, but very good! Especially with tortilla chips to dip in it.

This was good.  I also added a carrot and red pepper as my pumpkin seemed pretty flavorless,  I also added a little less broth to acquire the consistency I like. This was a nice change but I have to say I prefer a butternut squash soup.

I had never tried pumpkin soup before and wanted to give it a try. This was amazing. I didn't have fresh pumpkin so I used a 29oz can of libby's pumpkin puree instead and it turned out fine. I also used vegetable broth to make it vegetarian and added a piece of fresh ground turmeric root for extra color. Next time I want to try replacing the heavy cream with canned coconut cream to make it vegan. This was a great recipe and I didn't expect to like it so much. :)

So creamy and delicious!  Made some minor changes,   I Added more garlic and used Rosemary rather than Thyme.  Also I garnished it with paprika and drizzled fresh olive oil over it.    Loved loved loved it!

Yum! My first time making pumpkin soup and it was delicious! I didn't use heavy cream, I used half and half. I just added a little at a time until I was happy with the taste.  I also didn't use the food processor. It wasn't necessary.

I truly loved this soup...my whole family loved it! This pumpkin soup hit the spot and it's easy to make. I didn't use the can puree, I roasted and pureed a pumpkin to use for this soup. It was delicious!

I have never made pumpkin soup but we carved up and gutted our pumpkin so I decided to try this with fresh pumpkin. I followed the recipe , with the following alterations: I added some curry powder and did not have peppercorns so used regular pepper. I did not have heavy cream so I used a little evaporated milk. I thought this was pretty tasty overall. I will make this again, it just tastes like the fall to me. A nice "comfort" soup if you will. YUM.

I rushed to find a pumpkin soup recipe for Thanksgiving weekend because my mother had just had dental surgery and was unable to bite into anything. This soup really picked her spirits up and was enjoyed by everyone. The thyme really shines in this soup. Next time I will try to make it a day before because I have a feeling that the amazing flavours will come out even more if left for a day.

Not a bad little soup. I would say, if you have the means of cooking and purÃ©eing a real pumpkin using a pie pumpkin, do it. It is sweeter, and lighter than the canned stuff, and appears to yield more liquid than the canned variety as well.  Also, if halving the recipe  for smaller batches. Half the cook time as well.  It becomes more of a light paste or pumpkin sauce if allowed to cook longer. Overall not too bad. I would tweak it maybe with a little more peppercorn, and reduce the thyme a bit.

I made this exactly as written except for adding the Whole Peppercorns, or Parsley because I don't like it... and it was AMAZING!  I could live off of this soup! Oh I also used mostly vegetable broth, since that's what I had on hand, then opened a new chicken broth.  SO good!

This is one of the most wonderful new recipes I've tried recently.  I've made it with pumpkin and several types of squash.  I add a pound of browned sausage or seasoned ground pork.  It's delicious fresh or a couple of days later.  When I run the pumpkin or squash through the blender, I don't do it again after adding other veggies.

I just finished making this soup today and it is very delicious and smells great!  After reading a lot of reviews from this site and looking at other recipes, I made a few small changes.  First, I decided to roast and puree two small (whole) pumpkins that were left from Halloween (why let them rot?).  Then, I sauteed the vegetables before adding one 32oz of vegetable and one 32oz of chicken stock.
Using ingredients from another recipe, I chopped a handful of baby carrots and fresh rosemary and sauteed with the onion and garlic (4 cloves). After all the negative responses to the thyme, I thought rosemary would be better.
After sauteing, I followed the instructions as stated in this recipe.  I have to admit it was a lot of work; but, the house smells wonderful!

Excellent soup! My husband and I loved it. This is the first pumpkin or squash soup we've made. Made it from fresh pumpkin. Added a little extra onion, garlic and thyme because we like those seasonings. Very happy with the creamy texture and delicious flavor. We will make it again!

Sadly I was not overly excited by the end result of this recipe. I followed it word for word but it seemed not quite right. The thyme was too over powering and I think I wasn't thinking about the fact that this is a savory soup. Next time I will try it with cinnamon and brown sugar.

Before you make this, visualize what it will taste like with the excess amount of chicken stock it calls for. This soup is not creamy.

Excellent recipe!  I've got a very high power blender that also has a heating element, so this was ready in about 12 minutes total, I used fresh pumpkin as well. I also skipped the cream and used whole oats (pureed with the soup as well) as a thickening agent. The oats were an amazing touch and I highly recommend you try it. Definitely an easy way to make the soup more filling and nutritious.

This recipe is amazing. I made my own veggie stock in the same pot insted of the chicken. It is so good if you add a bit of nut meg and cinamin. when i put my pumpkin in i paniced because it wasnt getting soft and mixing with the soup. I found out its just perfect when you blend it. I seved it with a pinch of curry powder. That was amazing. You can also make this out of old jack'o'anrterns after Halloween if their still good, insted of throwing them out or putting them in the compost pile.

I didn't want to go the store to buy the chicken stock, therefore I have used oyster sauce(only 1/2 cup). The end result was excellent.  I have also used 1/4 cup of non fat milk and 1/4 whipping cream. Added a tablespoon of butter towards the end. The soup was creamy and rich in flavours.

Came out thinner than I expected. I added extra cream. Taste was so-so. I doubled the batch and didn't have enough chicken broth, so I put in vegetable broth. I think the latter added an unwanted flavor.

This is an easy to make, flavorful, soup.  If you'd like to make it ahead simple stop after pureeing the soup and store.  When ready to serve reheat the soup, add the cream, and wha-la!

This is an easy to make, flavorful, soup.  If you'd like to make it ahead simple stop after pureeing the soup and store.  When ready to serve reheat the soup, add the cream, and wha-la!

This was bland and had a weird texture. Maybe it was because I used baked and mashed pumpkin instead of fresh, but no one liked this soup.

We thought this soup was delicious! I doubled this recipe I used chicken broth (what I had on hand)and also added fresh nutmeg and just added more pumpkin (because people said it was watery. I took some and froze for pumpkin chili and then I cut up 1 Goya Chipotle pepper (in adobo sauce)and added to the remainder, removed as much seed as I could and added cooked gnocchi at the end. A nice spicy pumpkin soup it turned out to be!

This recipe was very good. My entire family enjoyed it, even those that were leery of a soup with pumpkin in it! I did tweak a few things to suit my family's tastes and to use what I had on hand. Here are the things that I adjusted: used regular pepper, added a chicken bullion cube, and cut the salt and garlic in half.

I usually have very good luck with recipes here but not this time.  I made only 1/2 the recipe to see if we liked it.  Not sure what I did wrong.  All the reviews were great but hubby & I did not care for it. So sorry but this just was not to our liking.

I had a hard time cubing fresh pumpkin. I might have gotten a really hard pumpkin though. Just obtaining the pumpkin took me almost an hour. The peppercorns did not get ground up during processing and I had to fish them out so nobody would swallow one. In the future I would just use ground pepper. When I first tried the soup, it just tasted like glorified broth, but after sitting in my bowl a few minutes it tasted better. I had some leftovers today for lunch & it was really good, better than last night.

If you are looking for a great tasting soup with complex flavors then this is not the soup for you.  I was so excited to try this soup because of all the great reviews but I was sadly mistaken.  This soup is very, very bland.

Too much pepper. And no real flavor. I was expecting strong pumpkin taste. But it is boring!  In the end I added 2 tbl honey too help cut the pepper.

Ummm jury is still out on this one. I too made it with vegetable broth but doesn't seem to be much flavor. I keep adding salt. Also not adding heavy cream as I don't do dairy either.  I think its going to have to grow on me a bit.  I soooo wanted to love this too!

Something was missing. I used canned pumpkin purÃ©e not sure if that was it. But it lacked flavor and I prepared it just as the recipe called for. I definitely would not make this again ... The amount of work was not worth the end result :(

Oh yes, very simple & very tasty! The little dash of nutmeg at the end - as another reviewer suggested - was the perfect finish. Also used fat-free half and half instead of heavy cream. I had white pumpkin frozen in packages, so it was easy, and instead of using the traditional blender I used my favorite kitchen tool, my hand blender, right in the pan, so clean-up was a breeze.

I don't cook much but tried this and it was the best. I tried it with the veritable stock and the scoop of peanut butter I also added ground cloves and cinnamon second time I left the peanut butter out and put two packets of Splenda it was great both times. Even my parents liked it.  Oh I also used canned pumpkin purÃ©e.

Really yummy soup with some additions.  I added several healthy shakes of nutmeg, roasted some pumpkins seeds for the top and drizzled with balsamic reduction. It was tasting a bit "pumpkiny" before the garnishes.

Really yummy soup with some additions.  I added several healthy shakes of nutmeg, roasted some pumpkins seeds for the top and drizzled with balsamic reduction. It was tasting a bit "pumpkiny" before the garnishes.

This soup was so easy and tasty! Really good!! so smooth and creamy. I made this soup for my family and my grandmother thought I added saffron to this soup, that's how good the color was! They all loved it! I'm not a fan of pumpkin but this recipe changed my mind lol

Really amazing! Sauteed onion & extra garlic ahead of time, then put all but the cream in a microwavable bowl since I wouldn't be home for supper. Used white pepper, dried thyme. Instructions were: Simply heat, add cream, & eat. (*sigh* kids add too many crackers - but loved it) Easy for my young daughter to serve up for the family. I personally love pumpkin, & was looking forward to tasting a new pumpkin soup. However, when I finally had some of this soup, I was surprised to find that I couldn't taste any of the pumpkin. That was an added blessing since hubs does NOT like pumpkin. HE LIKED THIS! (he liked our modified version of Stuffed Shells 2 from this site better the next night - it turned into a modified lasagna-lite, but who is going to make anything as complex as lasagna every nite???). Served this soup w/Pear & Blue Cheese Salad from this site, which hubs utterly loved (adding a touch of sugar to the dressing), & Italian Wheat Rolls (also from this site - using 70-75% whole wheat rather than as directed). This made a really lovely fall meal which he actually enjoyed (perhaps especially because of the salad & rolls, but he liked the soup fine). That little menu is going into our fall rotation as of now. Thanks so much Allrecipes & Lea, for yet another success story in our kitchen! Oh, & later, when I wanted a snack in the evening, I finished off this soup!  Yummmm.....!!!!!! Next time, might try: 6 tsp. chicken bouillon crystals, 2'sh C water, 4'sh C soy milk.

Edible, but bland.  I thought I would like it since I really like squash soup.  Thyme did not work for me here.  I rescued the soup with hot chili sauce and curry powder.  It was better, but not great!  I'll eat it because I like soups, but will not use this recipe again.

2 people in my family, so I halved the recipe, worked great.  I left some of the pumpkin chuncky when I processed it.  Also, will cut stock to make soup a little thicker next time and add a little more cream.  Very good soup!

This was very close to a great pumpkin soup served at a local gourmet restaurant. Way too much sodium and fat however so I skipped the salt, used low sodium chicken broth and bumped up the spices. Fresh thyme and extra garlic make a big difference along with just a hint of cinnamon. I used 1/2 cup evaporated skim milk instead of cream. To make this more of a meal I added 2 cups of shredded carrots and six lean sliced chicken sausages. My family loves this soup including my picky teenagers.

Hearty and yummy. I added potatoes as someone suggested and they seemed to overpower the pumpkin flavor...I may try it without next time.

Sadly this soup was not well received. Tasters said it was "bland, missing something". There were some folks who thought it was okay, but had tasted better versions.

I'm sorry, but as is, I found this really kinda gross.  Maybe it had something to do with using fresh made pumpkin puree, or maybe with the stock I had that I made from scratch. I think it would be better with vegetable broth vs chicken stock.  I ended up adding 1/4 c brown sugar, couple teaspoons pumpkin pie spice, and 1/4-1/2 vanilla yogurt to finally get something I found creamy and edible.

I substituted evaporated milk for the heavy cream and I also added a touch of cumin, cinnamon and a little brown sugar.  The idea of a cup of onions seemed overwhelming so I added a tsp. of onion powder instead.  This creamy soup was very good!

I like this recipe very adaptable.  I made it as a first course for my wine dinner and used fat free half and half.  No one knew it should be any different.  I have also made it for my friends for a luncheon and made it with silken tofu for protean.  That was a hit.  I also added carrots and used canned pumpkin.  So much you can do with it.  Tried apple cider once.  It was sweet then.

I made this for my parents and they just loved it.  Instead of processing it in the Cuisinart I used my VitaMix and that worked out great.  I followed the recipe to the letter and it was fool-proof.  A definite "make again", perfect for fall.

I have never made or tried pumpkin soup before, so I thought I would give it a whirl. The soup was good, I found it to be great comfort food served with warm bread on a chilly fall day...but for some reason I didnt expect it to taste the way it did. The after taste is a little different, but overall a good comforting soup.

I thought this was good but my hubby did not.  I added some curry, ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon.  Hubby thought it was too spicy!  It was very bland without any of those spices added though!  My kids ate it fine.

I doubled the quantity of peppercorns, crushed them, and for a lighter version and more interesting flavour add light coconut milk instead of cream.

My family tends to like spicy food so I also added a teaspoon full of Thai curry paste.   Add a tablespoon of lemon juice just before serving.

You will get rave reviews.

My family gives RAVE reviews on this! I make it when we all agree it's "Fall" enough- sort of as a welcome fall treat. I make enough to send home with my parents. As soon as it's gone, they are asking for more! Most of the time though, I just chop everything very fine, and skip the blender part. No one seems to mind, and it still tastes amazing!! Can't wait to make it this year!

A very good and filling soup. I made a half recipe of this because I only had 2 c. of canned pumpkin. Also I replaced the heavy whipping cream with evaporated milk to save some calories. Don't skip the fresh herbs (if you can get them) that really added to the flavor I thought. The soup tasted even better the next day.

My whole family loves this recipe and it has become a regular item on our menu.  We live in SE Asia so I use the local pumpkin called calabasa which is available all year.  It gives the soup a slighly different flavor from the typical varieties of pumpkins grown in North America.  I did make a few small changes.  I add about 1/2 the recommended cream and doubled the garlic, thyme and parsley.  I don't have regular access to fresh thyme, parsley and other herbs so I have to use dried.

This is my first attempt making pumkin soup. I used fresh pumkin and it was so much work to peel and chop, so I will try using can pumkin next time. It is a very hearty soup. Thank you.

Wonderful soup! I only had enough pumpkin for one serving, and it cooked so thick during the first 30 minutes that I didn't cook it again after blending. I also added whole milk instead of cream. It's one of the best things I've made! It's very creamy and thick.

Only ok. A lot of work for a pretty bland result. The pumpkin was everywhere because of the 1 cup processing. Don't think I will do again.

This recipe is awful...it tasted like dishwater- bland, soapy, and flavorless. I tried to spice it up with extra seasonings and curry as someone suggested, but after awhile I just gave up and threw it down the drain.

Amazing! This is the most simple soup recipe and very delicious to top it off!! There is also a lot of potential for additions with this recipe as a base. Never thought to make a pumpkin soup before this. Last night I made the soup and also baked a chicken with stuffing and potatoes. Today for lunch I brought to work the soup with chicken and stuffing mixed in. It was even more delicious than last night. I chopped the onions very small and sauted them in a bit of butter with the garlic to soften them and then added the rest of the ingredients. I also skipped the puree because the onions were so small and soft. I simmered straight for a full 50 minutes. Came out amazing and other than stirring here and there was no work at all. Thanks Lea!!

I didn't add the thyme to the entire pot, just in a little dish on the side & decided to season it differently as it seemed "bland & blah". I tried ginger, cinnamon & 1/2 cup applesauce. It was different, I've had much better squash soups that were sweeter-tasting. It seems like it was still missing something, but we enjoyed the flavor, probably won't make it again...

Even my husband who doesn't eat anything with the word squash in it, loved this soup! One warning is to look how much salt is in the stock you are using - my soup turned out a little too salty because the chicken stock I was using was already salted and added more salt as the recipe says.

Hubby said it was good, I liked it very well, but the kids weren't so sure.  Three of the four ended up eating it but the oldest (pickiest) of my children was not pleased.  Oh well, you can't please everyone.  I will make this again!
