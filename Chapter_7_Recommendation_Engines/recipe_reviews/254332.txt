I only used 1 can of cream of celery soup (we don't like mushrooms).  I added chopped onion and minced garlic.  Used Nature Season, garlic powder,  beef bullion granules and Worcestershire sauce.   We liked it quite well this way.  I think it would have been too bland without the extra seasonings.

Very good dish. I added some mixed frozen veggies, a handful of shredded cheddar, and some parsley and it was delicious. You do kind of need to add some additional seasonings for flavor.

tried this recipe,  I tweaked it just a little for my household's taste and it was amazing.  excellent recipe to follow, whether following exactly or just adding a bit of extra spice like I did. very delicious. sorry  no picture, it was being eaten before I had the chance.

Turned out good. I substituted the ground beef with beings on steaks cut up similar to stew meat.
