I used Trop 50 orange juice in this cocktail. Not bad. I didn't think I'd like orange juice and whiskey but it took me by surprize.

I liked this. It was easy. I also like to mix in Cranberry Juice.
Thanks!

Good, easy drink.  Not anything I would order at a bar, but great to make at home.  I added a cherry too - just because I had some.
