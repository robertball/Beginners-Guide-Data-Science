Superb !   Wish I could give more than a 5 rating.  Needed about 1 hand of flour when forming them into a ball for 2nd. rising.  I never tasted a better roll. ! ! ! Nothing like these 'old time' recipies.

Strong suggestion, you double the water input.  I use butter flavored Crisco as shorting, and so much nicer and lighter. Much nicer roll.  Made several times already.

I made these on a whim and brought them to my   mom's for Thanksgiving. This makes a LOT of rolls, and they were all gone before the end of dinner. They taste very homemade, yeasty and rich. I thought that they were an easily made recipe. I thought (myself) that they didn't brown up in the time given in the recipe, but that might be just my oven. I would definitely recommend these to someone looking for a really good comfort food hot roll recipe!

Excellent recipe!  The rolls turned out delicious and "pillow-soft"!  The recipe was very easy to follow.  I only made a few changes.  I used 3/4 cup water and butter flavored Crisco (from a previous review).  I added an egg wash (egg whites and a dash of milk) to the top of the dinner rolls before I cooked them and, to add a bit of sweet flavor, I brushed them with a melted butter and a dash of sugar mixture.  I put rolls into a muffin pan and cut an “X” on top of each of them before I cooked them.  I cooked them for 20 minutes brushed them with my butter sugar mixture then cooked them for 5 more minutes.  PERFECT!!  I will definitely cook these rolls again.

After cooking, these freeze and defrost nicely when you just need a few at a time.  I used real butter rather than the shortening and also doubled the water following another reviewer's strong suggestion.  My husband,usually not enticed by bread, gives this two thumbs up!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This is such an easy recipe. I followed it exactly and it turned out perfect! They taste the best right out of the oven! You can also make the balls of dough and wrap them in cling wrap then freeze them to make at a later time. When you take them out of the freezer, thaw on the baking pan, until the dough rises double, then bake, yummm yummm!

These were what they stated pillow-soft but they were also lacking a little in flavor for us. I don't know if it's because we normally eat wheat or an actual fault in the recipe. Still good and sill make again maybe subbing some of the all purp flour for wheat. Also, the less flour you add the better my dough was a very soft dough (think still mostly sticking to the bowl) and the texture of these rolls was amazing.

While my rolls raised well each time and the dough was tasty, the final product was not what I thought it would be.  I seldom use shortening, but I wanted to make as written ... they were drier than I would have expected.  A friend made them after I did and she used oil ... hers are not dry.  To do a floured surface, I used a floured cookie sheet ... really contained the mess! :-)  I might try these again after I experiment with other rolls.

These were simple to make and absolutely FANTASTIC!  I brushed them with melted butter right after baking and my family wouldn't wait until dinner to eat them!  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

I loved the texture and the "softness" of this roll.  After taking these out of the oven and tasting I thought they were  a little tastless. I melted some butter and added some garlic salt and spread on top of each roll.  I returned them to the oven for 3 minutes and they were so much better.

I made these rolls to pair with my homemade Cauliflower Zuppa Toscana. I cut this recipe in half. I only made one change and that was using melted butter instead of shortening. I used my Kitchen Aid mixer to make this recipe. I proofed the yeast in the mixer bowl with the sugar, warm water and warm milk for ten minutes, then added the butter and egg, then the salt and flour. This dough needed almost a full cup to get it into a solid ball so I could knead it with the dough hook. Even then, it was a "wet" dough. I kneaded it with the hook for five minutes, then set the dough ball to rise in a greased, covered bowl on a warm heating pad for an hour. I then formed it into 1/4 cup balls and set the individual balls in greased muffin cups. I got 11 sized balls out of this recipe, not 12. I let them rise in the muffin tin, covered with saran wrap, on the warm heating pad for another half hour. I baked them at 400* for exactly 12 minutes. The texture of these rolls was really good but I think it could use a little more sugar. It's really a nice basic roll recipe, like something you'd eat at a church dinner or at Grandma's house. I'll make this again but I'll double the sugar. NOTE: I did not measure my yeast. I used one envelope of yeast for a half recipe. For the whole batch, you'll want two envelopes.

I've made these rolls twice now, the first time I changed the servings to 15 instead of 24, and both times they tasted wonderful! They were a little more dense than I wanted, maybe I did something wrong, but they do taste great and it's an easy recipe. I also brushed them with butter when they were done.

I've been making bread for 30 years and have made a *LOT* of rolls. This recipe is one of the very best I have ever used and makes the type of rolls our friends love the most. I don't have a mixer; I just make them by hand. The key is to resist the temptation to knead in too much flour. As the recipe says, the dough is sticky.

Easy recipe to follow, I used yeast for bread machines and it worked very well.  Light and fluffy, beautiful golden brown tops (I used an egg wash as well).  I think I'll increase the salt to 2 tsp next time I make these.  Definately a 'keeper'. The rolls were also a generous size, perfect for company.

Bread is usually a disaster for me, but these rolls turned out perfectly. The only recipe deviation I made was using butter-flavored Crisco. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. I made these for Thanksgiving and the smell and taste of these rolls had my dad and uncle close to tears from memories of their mom and grandma - both awesome bakers. My dad said these rolls were better than my great-grandma's. That was one of the best compliments I've ever received. Thank you for posting this recipe!

These were SOOO good! I did make a couple changes though... First off, I halved the batch as they were just for me and my hubby. I got 6 BIG (hamburger bun sized) rolls out of them Instead of regular milk, I used canned. My mom makes THE BEST white bread, and this is her secret. I also increased the butter to 1/4 cup for the half batch, so it would be 1/2 cup for the full batch.  Lastly, I brushed them with egg whites before putting them in the ovem.n, and then rubbed the tops with butter when they were hot outta the oven. AMAZING!

Made these roll for the first time for our family Thanksgiving dinner. I read - and I mean read all of the reviews, adjusted the sugar to 1/2 cup, increased the salt to 2 tsp, added the egg wash five minutes before the end of baking time and then brushed with melted butter before serving - followed the rest of the directions exactly. I felt the dough was a perfect consistency - not too soft or runny. They were perfect! My entire family loved them and we were only left with three rolls once everyone had packed their care packages of leftovers. We put those into a zip lock bag and warmed them in a 350 degree oven wrapped in foil three nights later. Can't say there were any complaints! And it was the first time I've ever made bread products outside of a bread machine! Don't know what those who gave a bad review did incorrectly, but I'm pretty sure it was user error!

This was a good, basic roll dough recipe.  I did cut the recipe in half since I only wanted a dozen, but the recipe makes it very easy to do that.  Also, I used half butter AND half the shortening called for in the recipe - it made the rolls richer.  I also did not proof my yeast and added it with the flour.  The reason I did this is because I replaced the water with warm buttermilk - SO GOOD!  I used my KitchenAid with the dough hook and kept the dough sticky as possible without adding too much flour to dry out the rolls.  Brushed with butter after baking, these rolls are amazing.  I served with a Honey/Butter and they were very good.

I have made these dinner rolls 3 times now, and the first two times, I made them exactly how the original recipe called for, and I thought that they were kinda bland but I loved the texture of them.  Today (Easter Sunday 2011), The only thing I changed was I used 2 cups of canned milk (instead of regular milk), 4 Tbsp of shortening, and 2 Tbsp of butter (instead of 6 Tbsp of shortening), brushed the rolls with egg white just before I popped them in the oven, and then when they came out of the oven, I brushed them with melted butter.  I also used fresh Fleischmann's Active Dry Yeast (not the Rapid Rise; also make sure it isn't expired).  They came out absolutely amazing, and were NOT bland anymore!  The next time I make them, I plan on using Stevia instead of sugar, so I'll let ya'll know how they turn out!

These were amazing!! They came out quite a bit bigger than expected, so you could easily make double the amount stated and have smaller, yet good sized, rolls to serve a crowd. I melted some butter and mixed in some minced cloves of garlic and spread it on top as soon as it came out of the oven. Marvelous!

I halved this recipe and after mixing together the wet ingredients, decided it was plenty and could do without the egg, so i left that out, but OMW, the dough was soft n lovely, then i rolled the balls and left to rise again and it worked beautifully. If you are short on time, skipping the extra risings still gives you lovely rolls! Amazing warm with butter, pop in the micro the next day for 10secs :)

While I loved the texture and softness of the rolls, they were lacking in flavor.  I plan on trying the recipe with butter flavored crisco or possibly with butter to add a little something...

Wow these were really amazing!  I even kind of messed it up a little (by not letting them rise fully) and they still turned out absolutely perfect.  What a great recipe!!!

These are wonderful! I followed the ideas other people suggested, added about 50% more sugar, a little more salt, split shortening and butter, and instead of plain water, added buttermilk powdered mix to it. I made half a batch and used one envelope of rapid rise yeast. (15 minute rest followed by shaping and a full rise) Added just enough flour to knead well, but still somewhat sticky. Brushed on melted butter after baking. I'm eating one right now. This is the third half-batch I have made. (upon request!) They are definitely soft, yet dense in texture, heavy in the hand, with a superb aroma. Reminds me of an egg bread or a potato bread with a slight wispy scent of pretzel somewhere in the background. Hard to describe here. A thin crispness on top when baked fresh that develops into a nicely even perfect texture from top to bottom the next day. (Definitely better the next day!) You barely have to chew them. We may have slightly underbaked them, which actually makes them even better, we think. All they need is a few seconds in the microzapper and a bit of butter for full enjoyment. Considering how big of a hit they are so far in this house, I am sure we will be making them far into the future. Thanks for sharing!

I made these last night and they are awesome! I increased the water to 3/4 c. at another user's suggestion. I mixed the wet ingredients first minus the eggs and let the mixture stand for 15 min. All bread makers will tell you that they all do this. The dough was so perfect, although I only used 6 cups of flour and maybe 1/2 c when kneading. I also used oil instead of lard. I find it makes for a moister bread. And lastly, I cooked the first batch (12) for the time mentionned, but the other batch for much longer because my DH wanted them really browned. When I put them away this morning I found that mine were still perfect and his were kinda hard so don't cook them too long. I will make this again and again. It's a definite keeper.

I halved this recipe and used my bread machine on the "dough" setting.   I got 12 huge rolls, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, which were a big hit and perfect for our sloppy joes!

Absolutely delightful!  It did need a lot more flour than recipe called for and if your not baking for an army I do recommend cutting it in half.  We actually stuffed our dinner rolls with onions and cheddar cheese and then topped them with cheddar cheese before baking.  We used the left over dough to make hot dog rolls!  It was amazing!

These are the easiest, tastiest, dinner rolls I've ever made.   I usually cut the recipe in half, make them into smaller rolls and freeze them for future use, they freeze very well.  No tweaking necessary, they are delicious just the way this recipe is.   My husband loves them, and so does everyone that ever has them.  Thanks for the recipe...

Incredible texture! Minus a star for the taste, which as other reviewers noted is a bit pretzel-y. But!!! I've made this recipe several times and have a few minor revisions to improve the taste: an extra 1/4 c of milk (this means only 1/4 c water), reduced salt to a rounded 1/2 tsp, and added an optional rounded 1/4 tsp powdered sage, just for fun. Makes a soft, springy, marshmellowy dough, absolutely amazing to work with.

These tasted more like pretzels than dinner rolls.  There was way too much salt for our liking.  But they were soft.

These rolls tasted really good, but they weren't as soft as I thought they would be. They were gone at the end of the night though. Will have to mess around with the recipe a little.

I couldn't ask for a better recipe! The directions were easy to follow and the rolls came out so moist, light, and fluffy! I usually have a hard time with bread making and end up with dense brick-like rolls, but not this time!! There will be no need to search for another roll recipe after you try this one!

I made these rolls twice. The first time, I followed the recipe exactly, and they came out beautifully. The second time, I was out of white all-purpose flour, and so I used 100% whole wheat instead. They were rock hard, and very gritty. I'd like to try this recipe again, and maybe used 2/3 white flour, 1/3 whole wheat. I am adding this to my list of dinner "regulars".

Used butter cuz I had no shortening, but all else was the same. They were a bit bland but the texture was lovely. I will definitely up the salt next time, but I will make them again and again.

Yikes!  Something went terribly wrong with this recipe!  I'm an avid bread baker and followed the recipe to a T.  I definitely would not call these "Pillow-soft".  The taste was just okay and they were more like a crusty kaiser than a soft roll, which is what I craved.  The dough is super sticky (beyond anything that's workable!) and needs more flour than what is written.  Without the added flour I was not even able to scrape everything out of the bowl OR even form a ball.  The dough stuck to everything...what a mess!

DELICIOUS. I doubled the water as another reviewer strongly suggested. These lived up to my expectations of a soft, tasty roll. They had a beautiful brown exterior but remained soft. For dinner, I topped them off with melted butter and the flavor was awesome! There were just three of us so I halved the recipe and then froze the extra rolls by wrapping them in saran wrap and putting in a freezer ziploc bag. Looking forward to thawing those and also making this recipe again!

Very good recipe! I never thought that I would be able to make homemade rolls but it was easy. It wasn't as quick as the total time that it says it takes but it definitely took faster than most of the other recipes called for.

This recipe made a very soft roll.  I cut the recipe in half, used unsalted butter instead of the shortening and used my bread machine on the dough setting.  After the first raising, the dough was very sticky but a light dusting of flour helped.  I formed the dough into 36 balls.  I greased a muffin pan and added 3 balls to each cup.  I allowed the dough to rise another 40 minutes before baking at 350 for 15 mins.  Then I brushed the tops with an egg wash and continued to bake for another 5 minutes,  The results were beautiful but I think they lacked flavor and next time I will add more salt.

Wow, when these were baking, they smelled delicous! I think the hardest part was kneading the dough because it was SO sticky! But the end results made it worth it. I did make a few changes though. I cut the recipe in half because I did not need much and then I used unsalted butter instead of shortening because I do not like usually shortening in my foods much. I also added a small amout of ground cinnamon and a little bit of almond extract! they turned out AMAZING! WILL MAKE AGAIN!!

These are so good, but there is way too much liquid for the amount of flour called for. I had to add over a cup of extra flour just to work the dough. The next time I made them I left the water out and only used the milk, and the liquid to flour ratio was perfect. Mine were done in 16 minutes, but my oven runs hot.  Five stars and highly recommended!

These are good, but they were even better with butter flavored shortening. I think they are a little bland with plan shortening. The texture is wonderful though.

These rolls are fabulous!  It was thought that I bought these from a bakery, they turned out perfectly.  I did use my BOSCH mixer to do the kneading for me.  Will definately keep this recipe.

Made these for Thanksgiving dinner yesterday and they were a hit!  I too altered the recipe a bit, I used butter flavored shortening and 1/3 cup sugar.  I like my buns sweet ;-).  Also, I made mine in a 9 x 13 pan and lined them up closely so they would square up when baking. They were picture perfect in size and pillow-softyness.

Delicious, light and airy. Everyone devoured them at Thanksgiving. I rolled them out, spread with butter, cut and made crescent roll shaped rolls out of these.

Wow, what amazing rolls! Super soft and fluffy and just perfect. I did everything the same except that I used half buttermilk and half regular milk, butter instead of shortening, and cut down on the sugar to 2 TB, and they were even better that I could have hoped for. I used the garlic butter recipe from this site, and they were insanely delicious! The best rolls I have ever tasted. They rise A LOT, so give them room. I have added italian seasoning, garlic powder and onion powder and they turned out wonderfully as well, you can't go wrong with this recipe!

Easy and simple! The only thing was that they were a little lacking in the "dinner roll" taste. Was kinda like egg bread.

Excellent texture.  Found the taste to be bland.  Anyone have any suggestions for flavoring other than adding a little more sugar?

This is a very good recipe for dinner rolls. I substituted melted butter in place of the shortening and it turned out great. I can understand why other reviewers commented that it was a little bland, but I think it makes the recipe versitile (good base recipe). I think I might use this recipe to make monkey bread at Christmas time! :)

These are probably the best rolls I've ever baked. And while mine came out denser than I thought they would be its nothing to kick. Based on the other reviews I'm sure its something I did that made them much denser than the fluffy one's I were expecting.


Edit: I did a double batch for thanksgiving and they came out perfect!!!! Soft and puffy awesomeness!!! Everyone ate them up.

These rolls are awesome. They're so easy to put together. I didn't even get out the mixer. I was out of regular yeast and and to use pizza dough yeast instead. No problems with that substitution. Used White Lily bread flour. I formed all the dough into lots and lots of rolls (more than 24). Baked off six for the 2 of us and froze the remainder. This morning I took another six out of the bag in which they're frozen and let them thaw/rise for about 7 hours, and they came out beautiful. I'll never make any other rolls! Thanks for the post!

first time i made them and well the dough was very sticky.  first time i made bread, so i am not used to working with dough.  They tasted great and they were nice and light.  My husband loved them.  from start to finish though its more like 2 1/2-3 hrs.  waiting for them to rise once for about an hour and then about 30 min again.  worth the wait though.

I'm giving them 4 good SOLID stars.  Not 5...WHY?  They were good but there was nothing unique or new or different here.  BUT on the UP side they did made excellent bread pudding when they were day old!  If you are looking for a good, all-purpose roll recipe then this is IT.  Thanks for posting

This recipe is amazing!  I made these for my husband's family a couple nights ago and they were a huge hit!  I did end up using quite a bit more flour, but they turned out fantastic.  Everyone raved about them, which I thought was pretty good considering it was my first time making rolls from scratch.  I'm pretty sure this will become the one thing I am asked to bring to family dinners!

Awesome! Made 24 biggish rolls. I used bread flour. They had a lovely texture and fragrance. I had them on cookie sheets and next time I will rotate the top and bottom half way through cooking for more even coloring. I also put an egg wash on just before baking, which made them glossy and lovely.

I used to make wonderful rolls when we lived closer to the mountains.  Then once we moved to a flatter area, I couldn't make them anymore.  They kept turning out flat and tasteless.  After 7 attempts and failures with different recipes, and purchasing a bread machine (which was a waste of money) I tried these.  They turned out perfect, and they are better than the ones I used to make!

These are delicious! Pillow-soft is a very accurate description. I made just as stated and they turned out beautiful! A little butter on top made them shine--add a little honey and they tasted devine! I tried making a few into cresent-shaped rolls, but they just looked like weird, mis-shaped rolls. :) Worth a shot. Wonderful rolls!

In watching my mother many years ago making bread (she was tops), I never saw really sticky bread as she was kneading it.  I'm sure I must have added at least 2 more cups of flour because I couldn't get a good rhythm going in kneading the dough because of the stickiness.  And even when I finished kneading, it was still pretty sticky. I made these ahead for Thanksgiving and am freezing them.  I made this recipe exactly as printed and even though the dough was very sticky (as it did say in the recipe) they came out very well and tasted good (had to try one before serving you know).

My mom and her sister have taken a vacation and I was put on the spot to cook for both my family and my Aunt's plus another friend. Chose to make these rolls to go with the meal and wow was that ever a good choice!! Everyone raved about how good and light they were. I will say that if you only make 24 rolls they are going to be large ones. I probably will make closer to 30-36 next time. I also exchanged half of the shortening for margarine and will probably do all margarine next time. Other than that No Changes neccessary for this recipe. Love the fact that you can freeze them for later use. Also, if you make too many of them for one meal, use them as sandwhich rolls its delicious!!

I forgot to put eggs in & my dough didn't turn out sticky as Norma mentioned but rolls were still super soft!!  I also cut down on salt & added more sugar in; brushed some honey/coconut milk mixture on rolls after 15mins of baking then baked for another 5mins, they tasted just perfect!  Highly recommend - a definite keeper!  Will make them again & again!!!  Thanks a lot for sharing this wonderful recipe!!

OMG, these are the best rolls I have ever tasted. They make your taste buds jump. A suggestion is if you are into sweet things lay out the a little  bread dough and add melted butter and tons of cinnamon sugar and brown sugar to the middle of the dough. Roll it like a wrap and bake it like you would bake the rolls it tastes GREAT!!!!!This Recipe Rocks!!!

Nice soft rolls.  I did add some garlic and rosemary, increased sugar to 1/2 cup and salt to 2 tsp.  The dough was very soft and sticky, so I set the dough balls in 2 greased 9 x 13 pans, so they'd raise higher rather than flatten out.

I made some changes so it would be a healthier roll. I cut the recipe in half to make 12 rolls. I used less water than the recipe called for and I use 1 tablespoon of each in place of all the shortening, I used butter, oil, and shortening. And instead of all purpose flour I used organic brown rice flour. either the yest wasnt working well or it was the flour because I dont think the dough rose well but they came out great anyway. I also did an egg wash and a butter sauce from a previous review. I like to eat them warm with butter. For not using regular flour I thought the rolls came out great.

I'm rating this 4 stars because I did alter the recipe a bit, according to comments from other reviewers about the lack of taste.  I slightly increased the salt and sugar according to taste and then in place of the egg I substituted 1 Tbsp. flax seed + 3 Tbsp water.  The flax seed offered a wonderful rich earthy flavor.  I also used butter flavored shortening in the recipe.  These were quick, easy, and (as promised) pillow soft!  Will definitely make these again!

These were awesome! Thank you. I made my 1st attempt last night. I followed some user reviews and used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening and DOUBLED the sugar.  My entire picky family agreed to keep this recipe! Today I will experiment with the leftovers that seem a bit hard this morning, so around dinner time I'll see how they re-heat. I also have unused dough I'll try and make a batch tomorrow and see how the refrigerated dough holds up.
**** Okay, the rolls reheated nicely. I had the unused dough wrapped in plastic wrap for 4 days before I was able to make a 2nd batch. I found that they rose quite nicely on the counter as well as in the oven. The final product after 4 days was about 80% as fluffy as using the fresh dough. Still, very soft and delicious!

While these Were Easy To make and had a nice texture and Flavor, the The bottoms Burnt Within 8 Minutes in the Oven, so we had to Peel the bottoms off before they were even ok to eat. So with the exception of the baking time being a little wonky they were pretty good.

These were excellent. I pretty much cook/bake everything my boyfriend and I eat. I got this recipe and convinced him to make it, with a little bit of guidance. They were amazing! Especially good if you put a little bit of honey and butter on the top when still warm.

I realized I had run out of eggs AFTER I'd thrown in all other ingredients so i used 3 large tablespoons of yoghurt instead. I also used a cup of whole wheat flour instead of apf to convince myself it's healthier. Had some trouble getting the dough together but greasing my hands, the bowl i left it to rise in and the knife helped. Even though I've made considerable changes the recipe was amazing and i'm giving this all five which I'm sure it is as is also!

Turned out well. Crowd them together to raise thicker rolls or spread them out for flatter rolls, either way turned out well. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

These were exceptional! The only change I made was using 3/4 a cup of water instead of 1/2.  I used my kitchenaid as my arms don't work and kneading is no longer possible for me. I was able to make these quickly and with a clingy 16 month old.  I reduced the second rise by 15 minutes and let it finish rising in the preheating oven, turned out amazing. So soft! These would make great sandwich rolls too. This is my new go to recipe!

Well I followed this recipe to the letter.I give the texture a 5 
the easy in preparation a 5
and the taste a 3
Mine came out very fluffy with a crusty outside, just as I like it.
I had no problems with the preparation.I followed the step's as directed. adding two cup's of flour and beating till smooth. then mixed in as much as I could, them turning the ball out on to the counter and kneading in the remaining cups of flour.no extra flour was needed. I will be making this again, I would say the recipe need's a little more salt.but they are absolutely wonderful with my homemade honey butter. and would be even better with fresh herb's mixed into the recipe.

I made these today for our Thanksgiving dinner.  I made them as listed on here, except I used Wheylow instead of regular sugar.  I did find the dough was a bit liquidy and I had to add more flour during kneading.  I was afraid it would make them tough.  I was wrong.  They were excellent.  I made a little honey butter to serve with them.  I don't make a lot of recipes with white flour, I wonder if anyone has tried these perhaps with 1/2 wheat and 1/2 white?  Awesome recipe, thanks for posting this.

These are great for dinner rolls and for family gatherings! We have made these twice in one week and plan to bring them along for the holidays!! We mixed it in the bread mixer, then pulled it apart into roll sized sections and let them rise & then bake in the oven as directed!!

Made these for a family dinner and they were a big hit!  I thought the size was a little big but will just make more next time.

New note - My husband likes the big size so...

Best rolls ever and so easy to make. You can easily substitue some of the white flour for wheat as well.

I made these for supper tonight with homemade soup.  They were delicious.  I used an egg wash before baking, and brushed with butter when I took them out.  I loved them and will use this recipe again!  Thanks! :)

Nice rolls... But just didn't hit the spot for me. I'll try another recipe next time. They looked wonderful but there was just something lacking in the flavor and texture. The hostess liked them and so did the other guests. I think I'm just becoming a bread snob! LOL!

These were hearty, soft, and not too hard to put together!  A great homemade roll for so many purposes-- I made them to go with soup and salad for a light supper, and my husband ate half the batch!  I froze the extras and brought them out a few days later, defrosted them, and filled them with chicken and tuna salad to make small sandwiches.  STILL great, even after freezing.  These take a little advance prep with all the rising, but worth the planning, for sure.

My first time making rolls from scratch and they were pretty easy. It took a while for them to rise, but in the end they were very nice. A good way to practice making rolls, but in the future I will use a more buttery roll recipe I think.

These rolls were lovely the first day. The next...very dry. I ended up turning them into breadcrumbs. I think the recipe needs more shortening - 8 T. perhaps.

This recipe had been in my recipe box FOREVER. They were not quite as 'pillow soft' as I was expecting, but it could be because I got busy and forgot to let them rise the second time. I turned half of the dough into a loaf and realized my mistake. So the loaf DID have a second rise (but I haven't cut into it yet.)I did an egg wash on the tops of the rolls prior to baking (made them shine!) I also found that I had over a cup of flour left unused. My house was cold when I made these so I turned  the oven on low as it would go (170 degrees) and set the dough on a rack on top of the stove for the first rise. That worked well (but my mom said I ran the risk of actually cooking the dough.) The light from inside the cold oven would have been enough warmth for the rising. Overall, I am pleased with these rolls and will make them again. Time to edit...I just cut into the loaf. IT IS WONDERFUL!! Light, great texture and holds together well.

Texture was great, but needs a little more sweetener. I substituted butter for the shortening and honey for the sugar because of my allergies. Made great sandwiches out of these rolls. Thanks, will definitely keep this recipe

May daughter talked me into making these because she said they would make a good sandwich roll.  I made them according to recipe and as far as a sandwich roll goes, they held up well.  Not what I am looking for though.  There is a little sandwich shop in our town that make homemade bread for their sandwiches and it is the best ever. I am still searching for that perfect recipe, and they refuse to share their secret.  Anyway, my husband had these with butter and said they were very good, but I will stick with my ole standby for homemade rolls.

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  I did follow some of the other reviews and used 1/2 butter 1/2 crisco and the end result was AMAZING! "Pillow Soft" is the perfect description.  I have added this to my recipe box and can't wait to make them again.

Great, soft, and very simple to make. There is no reason to buy from the store. I brush them with a little egg white/water to give them a golden brown finish. 5 min before they are done, I brush with melted butter. I used vegetable oil instead of solid shortening.

This recipe was VERY disappointing.  The dough is incredibly sticky, messy, and difficult to work with.  I chose this recipe after carefully reading through the reviews, but will definitely never make again.  Although I followed the recipe exactly, it turned out flat and tasteless. I even brushed the tops of the rolls with honey butter, which was the only flavor the rolls had.  Save yourself the time and effort and pass up this disappointing recipe.

Great recipe.  Light and fluffy.  I used lard instead of shortening, and the rolls stayed nice and moist.  Next time I'll use 1/4 butter, for added flavor.  Will make again often.

I had never made buns in my life, but i thought it was time to give it a try. and this recipe was very easy. i wasnt sure what shortening was! and i only put 1 cup of water. and they still turned out really good. i put melted butter on them when they came out.
im trying again today, and put butter in as shortening. so im sure they will be even better today.

I MADE THESE ROLLS FOR SUNDAY DINNER AND THEY WERE PERFECT. I USED BUTTER INSTEAD OF SHORTENING AND I ADDED A BIT MORE FLOUR. THE ROLLS ARE SUPER SOFT AND HAVE GOOD FLAVOR. EASY TO MAKE.

I made these for Christmas. The recipe was easy, they looked great and were pillow soft, however I did not care for the taste. I was hoping for a roll where you could smell the yeast while baking and taste while eating and I didn't get that with this recipe.

These didn't have any flavor at all.  Maybe I did something wrong but they weren't all that soft and aside from that no flavor.

This recipe's a winner! As others suggested, I brushed melted butter over the rolls when they came out of the oven. I made the 24 rolls required by the recipe, but they were pretty big. Next time I might make 30 smaller rolls. I'll definitely make these again. They're simple, light and tasty.

Excellent texture, lacking in taste. Just needs some butter flavored shortening and more salt.

I have been making these rolls for many years now and in fact sell DOZENS of them for the holidays. The recipe is very versatile. I have made it multi-grain, honey wheat and the basic white rolls. Everyone that has had them from me loves them. I use real butter instead of shortening. I use molasses and sugar in the multi-grain rolls which gives you a rich color and flavor. I brush honey on the top of the wheat rolls. My dad actually looks forward to Thanksgiving just for the rolls. This is a definite must make.

We love these rolls (I've been making bread and rolls for years and years) these are wonderfully soft and stay moist for days. We do substitute butter or margarine for the shortening, and I always butter my hands when forming the rolls, otherwise we prepare the recipe as written. Thanks for sharing such a keeper!

for being farely new to the world of baking i've been intiminated by many recipes.. read all of the reviews first, they were so helpful. I used oil instead of shortening and also spread butter on the tops of the rolls before baking. Turned out super! I plan to serve them with a home made honey butter!

These were quite delicious. I did make a few bigger for sandwiches, but it still made so many rolls.  I think next time I make them I'm going to cut the recipe in half.  I think this is going to be the recipe for my Thanksgiving dinner though...Thanks Norma for a wonderful recipe.

Nice rolls for sandwiches.  Bf didn't complain they were hard, so they must be a hit.  I halved the recipe and I wish I hadn't made 12 rolls only bc I wanted them as sandwich rolls.  The amount of bread recipes I've made, I should know better.  It would've been better to make 8-10 rolls for sandwich size.  Ah, well, no sweat off the recipe's nose.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was the recipe I tried for making dinner rolls. I found these rolls very sweet tasting and a little heavy. They looked great! We ended up eating them all the same day so they weren't that bad! Next time I make these I will try decreasing the sugar and not mix for as long as I did the first time.

The dough was so sticky, and to prevent it from sticking all over the place, I had to add an extra cup of flour.  The taste was alright, but I'll stick with "unbelievable rolls" from this site.

This is such a tough recipe to rate.  The rolls turned out really well, but the dough was so runny befor I had to kneed it.  I had to mix 2 addition cups of flour into the mixer befor I could turn it out onto the counter, and I still had my husband standing with the bag of flour dumping more on top every minute or so.  They rolls were good, but I have gone over the recipe again and again, and can't figure out what I had done wrong.  I just can't imagine that is the way the recipe goes.

Halved the recipe and on the second rise followed the directions for the Garlic Bubble Ring on this site and baked in a 9 x 13 and it came out very delicious.  The only change I will make next time is to use butter flavored shortening per other reviewers, to punch up the taste of the rolls a little.  Love how easy these were to make.

So easy.  I took a chance and made these on Christmas day.  I followed the recipe as written, and they came out perfect.  Wonderful flavor.  One guest remarked that she could never go back to brown-n-serve after having these rolls.  Leftovers didn't last long.

3.5-4 Stars...I made these Thanksgiving day. I almost gave them 4 stars since they turned out very good, however it was a great deal of work for...rolls. I now know why my grandmother gave up on her homemade Italian rolls and started ordering from the Italian bakery. Time can be better spent on other great dishes..but if you have the time and want to make everthing from scratch-this is a good recipe!

Lacking some taste. As it was my first time making rolls, it could have been my fault, however they were not pillow-soft.

I made this recipe twice, and I made half batches both times, since I wanted fewer rolls. The first time they came out very dense and not very good, so the second time I used a half cup less flour (a cup for a whole recipe) and it came out good. I also brushed it with butter with sugar in it five minutes before they came out of the oven, like a review reccomends, and again when they came out. The second time they were much better. Overall, very good rolls!

These are just fantastic! I used double the water and butter instead of crisco! I added some parsley and thyme. I also tried them whole wheat, they were great also. Perfect the men love these rolls, asked for more! I made them, rolled them into balls.....par froze for like 30 min...then took them out and put them in a ziploc and have them ready when ever...just let em rise....and bake em! 
Super Recipe!

I halved this recipe and it still ended up making 16 rolls so it does make a lot, unless you are making HUGE rolls.  Very easy. I let rise for twice as long as recipe stated as the first time I checked, they hadn't risen much. Will make again for sure.

These were really good and definitely "pillow-soft". My only complaint is that I wish they had a bit more flavor. Still excellent rolls though-I will definitely be making them on a regular basis!

I was sorely disappointed in these rolls. I had high hopes when I saw the rating and read all the reviews...They were soft and very easy to make, but very blah. I will not make these again.

I give these 5 stars because they are easy and taste great.  They are not overly flavorfull,and I think that butter-flavored crisco would have made them taste better, but overall they turned out great.  I did brush the tops with an egg wash before cooking and brushed butter over the tops 5 minutes before they were done.

I made 26 rolls from this recipe and they were big enough for hamburgers.  This will be perfect for 4th of July or any cook out.

Made these for dinner last night.  First time to ever make dinner rolls.  Pre-occupied as I was with interruptions, I was worried when my yeast liquid was sure to be cold, and as I added the shortening and such, thought about tossing the whole thing out.  Optimisic, and curious about how it might do, I decided to give it a worthy shot and continuted with the recipe.  I did not remove the dough from my KAid and let it knead itself for the 6-8 minutes and as it nearly leaped out of my bowl, I took it out and found it to be very tough, even still I decied to see if it would rise.  Since my COLD dough needed some warming, I loaded it up(inside the larger oiled bowl) and let it warm up a bit, took it out to continue to rise on top the stove.  To my surprise they rose!  Ate them for dinner tonight!  Soft, and great texture!!  I would add a bit of seasonings, or sugar to spice them up just a tad.

The amount of time this takes is deceiving as it does not take into consideration the 90 minutes worth of rising time so if you are making these to be hot with the meal, plan accordingly.  I would also say to cook until lightly browned not golden otherwise they get too done on the bottom.  Taste was good.  Gave some away today and will be making more tomorrow.

I intended to serve half of these rolls with dinner and then freeze the other half. I didn't get a chance to freeze any, they just disappeared. They were beautifully soft and very easy to make. Many Thanks

Tried this recipe with mixed results. The dough rose very easily and FAST. Disappointingly, the texture of rolls was not what I expected with "pillow soft". It turned out more like cornbread. It would be better with the suggestion of the butter flavored Crisco and honey-butter on top. My famiy did not like them so I will not make it again.

Made these this morning.  They turned out very well and I followed the recipe as written, except used butter flavored shortening in place of plain shortening. I too made mine a little smaller and got thirty rolls.  Froze the biggest percentage for Thanksgiving dinner.  Thanks Norma.

I used butter instead of shorting, but these were still quite bland, but wonderful texture. The dough was very soft, and sticky, just to warn everyone. May make them again because they are so easy, but would add something for flavor.

These were soft, but a little on the bland side. My husband liked them, though.

My husband was in love with the JP Big Daddy Biscuit.  I made these dinner rolls one night and bam he has a new favorite. These turned out so well.  The only thing I changed was I put them into a greased cupcake pan to let them rise and cook. Worked like a charm and boy did they go over well. They travel well too.  I sent a batch from Michigan to my husbands family in Philadelphia.  I wrapped them right after cooking them and mailed them right off and they arrived via priority shipping and fresh as the day I made them. They all loved them and served them for Mothers day dinner.

These rolls are very good and easy to make.  I melted butter over them and sprinkled natures seasoning over them.
