These were easy to throw together. My family loved them. I think they were a little sweet for me so next time I will try using 1/2 cup of each sugar.

The only thing I changed was that I added 1/2tsp of brown sugar to the top of each roll. Make sure to spoon extra sauce on top.

This was an easy recipe. I made extra sauce so I May use the sauce on another batch of rolls. They're delicious and sweet.
