This recipe calls for too much butter, I'd go for 1 1/4 sticks or even just 1 stick next time. I used 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp almond extract to give it more of a marzipan like taste/smell. And I used more almond flour instead of the coconut flakes as I wanted it to be an almond treat. It was delicious, just richer than necessary to be so delicious. The baked crust was amazingly delicious.

So moist it's almost more like a custard than a cake. Absolutely delicious. Will definitely make again
