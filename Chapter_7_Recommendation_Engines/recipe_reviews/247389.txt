Amazing! I can't believe that the water from beans can make such a fluffy delight. The end result is a frozen mousse type of dessert rather than a heavy ice cream. It's decadent. Leave it out of the freezer about 5 minutes before trying to scoop it out, it gets pretty hard. Thank you for the recipe.
