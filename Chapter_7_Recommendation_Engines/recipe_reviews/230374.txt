Delish! .... but
To my taste there was too much fluff and not enough fruit. So instead of 16oz cool whip I'll use an 8oz tub and cut the marshmallow by half. Otherwise it's great. The pudding does give it an edge over other recipes. I added sliced banana and chopped up 2 apples and added raisins. I love versatile recipes.

I made a happy mistake when making Ambrosia Reborn, I used lemon pudding instead of vanilla. Delish!

Made this for  a party & it was a big hit!  I added grapes, which gave it a nice juicy, crisp, cold , crunch.  Definately a keeper recipe :)

I served it to over 125 people and got rave reviews and people wanting the recioe!  Great recipe and easy!  -- and I just put the coconut on the side for people to add their own since some do not like coconut (like me).  It was awesome without the coconut, too!

Excellent! The flavor and consistency was wonderful. You can add tropical fruit in addition to, or instead of, the fruit cocktail for a slightly different take.

The ambrosia was a hit at my church picnic!  It reminded me of my great Aunt Dorothy's ambrosia I had as a kid.  Love it!
