This was OK, flat out OK.  I was expecting more oomph, what with the bacon, Swiss, garlic, onion and broth, but it was lacking in flavor.  I added a bit of milk and changed the method of cooking.  Since it is 103 degrees today, I refused to turn on my oven.  I combined the potatoes, cheese, bacon, onion, and garlic in a large bowl and seasoned with the salt and pepper.  I sprayed my microwave safe casserole dish with non-stick spray and dumped the potatoes mixture in.  I added the stock and a bit of milk and then dotted with butter.  I microwaved on high for 5 minutes and gently stirred, repeating the process 3 times (for a cooking time of 15 minutes).  I can't believe that half of the family added more salt to their potatoes, but I admit, it needed more seasoning.  Replace the salt with seasoned salt and add some garlic/onion powder.  I will attempt this again once it cools down, but as it stands, I wasn't asked to make this again.  We preferred the Microwave Scallop Potatoes on this site more than this one.

Five Stars!  Excellent!  My only advice would be that it doesn't need the full can of chicken broth.  It really only needs 3/4 or so.

Fabulous and no milk needed! I used 2 cups of unsalted chicken broth instead of the 14 oz can, combined Swiss & sharp white cheddar cheeses, and lowered the temperature 30 mins in to 325F. This will be my go-to recipe from now on!

This is a very good recipe.  It is one of the very few that does not use milk.  I did not know what size potato were used for this recipe but I used enough to fill a 9 x 13 glass pan.   I also used about 2.5  cups of cheese and closer to 20 oz of broth. 
 I cannot imagine this would taste very good if cooked in a microwave but from the oven, the cheese and potato baked to a wonderful crust. Also I like my scalloped potato to have a little more moisture when fully cooked and did not cook it dry. 
Keep in mind this does not taste like other recipes that use milk but it is wonderful on it's own merits.   The second day, the leftovers are even better.

One out of the three of us liked it. It just tasted strange. A lot of work to make. Can't put my finger on what was odd, but I will not make it again.

The only change I made was that I halved the recipe (for 2 only) and it was delicious!  Will make this again.
