Very good! I added a pinch each of salt, pepper and garlic powder. I also added a small sliver of cream cheese. made this over the weekend. Might be cooked to add some bacon bits or bacon.

Didn't work out so well for me.  If I try again I will take the pot off the heat and just let them soak since four minutes of cooking left them too hard for my taste.  Also wondering if the mix needs something like raw onions or bell peppers.

Can't say that is was my favorite at all. I didn't look at other reviews at all to know what others thought. But not sure I'd make this again. I'm just on the fence. My daughter liked it but I was just so-so with it. It was rather simple, but not a wow-wee type of recipe. Sorry.

Made this for friends.  Could not be easier. I used frozen bay scallops.  They disappeared!

I made this dish for a New Years gathering, doing exactly as the recipe said.  Everyone thought it tasted "strange" -- not necessarily bad, but not really good either.  I had a lot left over.  You couldn't taste the scallops, all you could taste was the French dressing.  It may have been the quality of the scallops I used - they were frozen.
