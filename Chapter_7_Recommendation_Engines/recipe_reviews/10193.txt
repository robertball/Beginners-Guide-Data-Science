I made this cookie recipe exactly to the directions and the "balls" fell to regular flat round cookies. Taste was ok but appearance was not satisfactory

I used chopped pecans in mine and chilled for about 3 hours. I remember my grandmother making these, and she would roll them into little "logs" instead of balls. She also rolled them in the powdered sugar while they were still warm, forming a paste, and then again after they had cooled. That is what I did. Turned out ok. A similar recipe found in most cookie books is "Sandies."

I thought the previous review must have done something wrong, but I had the same results: flat, not round, cookies that were crumbly and the powder got sticky. I saved the situation by putting my cooling rack over the sink and sifting powder sugar onto the cookies while hot and again avter the first dusting got sticky.

I think the problem is that these cookies typically don't have eggs in them. It causes the dough to spread out. I'll try a more traditional recipe.

Made these for Christmas and New Years and they were a hit! I did not add any nuts and rolled in c. sugar before and after baking. I will make again with a twist adding lemon zest w/o nuts.

They tasted good but fell apart.
