First time I've logged on to review a recipe.   I'm giving it a 5!   So many times I make things from this site that call for cheese and you can barely taste it.   This is right for us cheddar lovers.   We really enjoyed it.   I did add some mushrooms as the author suggested and it was really good.  The only way I can describe it is as if someone took my baked mac and cheese from my childhood and made it into handy squares.   Was gone in a flash.    

Something else I really liked about it?   Didn't have to play around too much with it.   Directions were really easy to follow.   I guess my take on it is this,  if you are heavy duty cheese people leave the amount as written.   If you aren't well then, cut down on it.   I'm leaving it as is.

My husband love this as a side dish to ham!  If you use good quality of cheese you won't get the oily and congealed mess a previous rater mentioned. There are indeed times you need to skip generic products!

Great to make ahead and freeze for later.  Bake, cut into squares, place in container or ziploc w/ parchment or wax paper in between layers and freeze

This is a quick, easy, and tasty recipe. I made 4 modifications 
1) reduced butter to 2 Tbl so that it wasn't oily as some reviewers remarked and 
2) used 3 heads of fresh broccoli, because I wanted more broccoli than cheese
3) added 1/4 tsp dry mustard
4) omitted extra salt; the cheese has plenty.

This was really great as is!  I added just about two tablespoons of onion and served it hot as the main dish.  Even picky son ate a large portion.  Yummmm!

Great recipe. I used it as side dish. Little bit too salty but it's still okay. I find it is good warm or cold but I did not like it as much the next day ( thats just me ). Next time will make the recipe smaller.

This was cheesy to the point of being oily.  The oil was bubbling as I pulled it out of the oven and it congealed as it cooled.  I would cut the cheese in half, maybe even 1/4 and it would be plenty.

These make a great lunch for my toddler. I used 24oz of broccoli because I had two 12oz bags. I also added 8oz of cheese and decided another 8oz would be overkill - I can't imagine it with 16oz! Gut bomb! Sprinkled it with onion powder. I would cut back on the butter next time as the oil from the cheese is enough. After baking it at least 45 mins and letting it cool, I cut it to find the bottom mushy and eggy. Yuck. I inverted the whole thing onto a flat pan and browned the bottom as well.
