This is an amazing recipe. From the first time I went to make it, I didn't have all the right ingredients and found I could just about substitute anything, so long as I kept the dry-to-wet ratio the same. However, I have made one improvement, in my opinion, after having made this recipe at least a dozen times now: mix (or sift) all the dry ingredients in one bowl, all the wet ingredients into another (including the raisins and nuts) and then add the liguid to the dry. It requires less stiring this way, mixes more thoroughly and produces a more consistent result.

I was also able to reduce the cholesterol and calories with a few minor changes without changing the flavor or texture.

I used Enova in place of the vegetable oil, cholesterol free eggs (in the carton) and fat-free powdered milk (mixed according to the directions). No one could tell the difference.

I also found it's possible to substitute squash for the carrots or applesauce (1-3/4 cups) for the apples and even to leave out the nuts entirely and increase the raisins to 2 cups (my husband doesn't like nuts).

When using applesauce in place of apples, increase the cooking time by 5 minutes.


The poster of this recipe deserves my hearty thanks!

These are a great and very healthy muffin.  I made some adjustments:

No oil- not neccesary.  This recipe is from the back of a bag of flaxseed and they omit the oil in it.

I used 1.5 cups of shredded carrots

Used wheat bran instead of oat bran- didn't have any on hand

Most important: I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose- does not make a huge difference, perhaps a tiny bit more dense.

I made 12 medium sized muffins and put the rest of the batter into a round cake pan and frosted it with some leftover cheesecake frosting for a sweet treat-- tastes like carrot cake and delicious!!

Love! Love! this recipe! 
Besides the fact that they are super yummy and convenient (keep them in the freezer then pop them in the toaster oven in the morning for about 10 minutes for healthy hot breakfast muffins) the recipe is pretty flexible and hard to mess up so you can have fun with it. 

A few suggestions if I may: add shredded zuccini for a little more vitamin oompf, use applesauce and more carrot (or zuccini) if you don't have fresh apples, and throw in some fresh blueberries!!  I use whole wheat all purpose flour.

Remember that it's always better to get whole flax seeds and grind them in your coffee grinder (store unground flax in cool dry place). Flax looses its oh-so-darn-healthyness really quickly. But if you do buy ground store, sealed, in the fridge.

OMG! These are the most delicious bran muffins I've ever had or made. Super-moist and sweet and good for you, too! Here's how I tweaked the recipe based on others' suggestions:

3/4 c. spelt flour
3/4 c. whole wheat flour 
3/4 cup ground flax seed 
3/4 cup oat bran 
2 T. Miller's bran
3/4 c. Splenda
1/2 c. dark molasses 
2 teaspoons baking soda 
1 teaspoon baking powder 
1/2 teaspoon salt 
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 
1 c. buttermilk
2 eggs, beaten 
1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
2 tablespoons vegetable oil 
2 cups shredded carrots (preshredded, bagged)
1 1/2 c. organic applesauce
1/2 cup raisins 
3/4 c. chopped walnuts
1/4 c. sliced almonds

I baked them in Texas muffin cup papers so they ended up being quite large. I baked them at 350 for 25 minutes.

Serve with a tall, cold glass of cow juice!

Thank goodness! I've finally found something that Flax Seed tastes good in! We bought a 92oz (huge) jug of Flax seed that was being sold at a local home and garden show becase the salesman said it would help with lowering my husband's cholesterol.  Once we got it home and started adding it to food as suggested, my husband decided that he HATED the taste of flax and refused to eat anything else I tried to "poison" with the stuff.  He even threatened to bury it in the backyard.  Then I found these muffins...which have been a real life-saver.  We may get the rest of our flax seed eaten yet!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  Compared to everything else we've tried....they are truly excellent.:)(Eventhough my picky hubby also made me leave out the raisins and the nuts!)
They are super moist and great for breakfast on the go.

These muffins are amazing!!  They really are a whole meal in one!  They are also indestructible.  I tried some major experimentation with them as I was lacking in some ingredients and still got an incredible result.  I used whole-wheat flour and substituted buckwheat flour for the oat bran.  I used 1 cup of milk and only 1 tbsp of oil. I also used 1/3 cup of maple syrup instead of the sugar.  I really liked the combination of the buckwheat and the flour.  Thank you so much!!!

Maybe I'm just used to chopping things fast, but this was so fast and easy to throw together.  I made it after the dinner was in the oven, and had enough time to put these in for the last 15 minutes.  They turned out awesome.  I cut the recipe in half, and just filled the cups for normal muffins, got 12 out of it (just clearing the top of the papers). Also we didn't have oat bran and substituted whole wheat flour - I worried over that but shouldn't have. We also used half ground flax seeds and half whole, enjoyed the texture more.  As was said, this is a keeper!

These were really good, and the carrots made them very pretty.  I used honey instead of sugar, and not at much as the recipe called for.  I used whole wheat flour instead of white flour, but that might have been a mistake. (Too much fiber!)

Very delicious muffins.  I am back to print out the recipe again, because I had to give the original to a friend who was over when I had made them and wanted the recipe.

You wouldn't even know that they were healthy :)

Simply put, SPECTACULAR! You could easily dust these with powdered sugar or ice with cream cheese frosting and call them cupcakes. The texture is so moist with the carrots and apples. For those who found them to be lacking in flavor, try increasing the cinnamon by 50%, then add liberal shakes of nutmeg, cloves, allspice and ginger. I didn't have oat bran on hand, so substituted All Bran cereal and softened it in the milk for 10 minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients. Also used Splenda in place of the brown sugar to make them more diabetic-friendly. I'm trying several of the highest-ranked bran muffin recipes on this website and although I've found 2 others that I loved, this one is my favorite. It's packed with fiber and antioxidants, so just about as healthy as you can imagine. Say goodbye to empty calorie breakfasts! You can even eliminate the oil to save some calories and it will never be missed. What more can I say, but WOW!! Edited to add: In an incredible bonehead move, I forgot to add the flax! The texture is a little different, but I'm happy to report they still taste fabulous. It's the mark of a great recipe, to be that forgiving. Have now made 3 times, and have subbed sweet potato for carrot, added mashed banana, all with superb results.

I just made these recently and was SO pleased with the results. They are so healthy, yet without that "health food" taste. I feel like I'm doing something good for myself everytime I eat one and enjoying the taste at the same time.

I used 100% whole wheat flour in place of the all-purpose. I didn't have the right kind of apples on hand, so I used applesauce (almost filled a 3/4C measure, finished filling it with pureed prunes), left out all the oil, and these were perfect! After cooling, I wrapped and placed them in the freezer. Pull out one and microwave for about 10 seconds on high. So good with a cup of hot tea! Also goes well with a crisp apple and a cheese stick for a high protien, fiber-rich snack.

These muffins were (surprisingly) lacking in flavor and were way too moist, to the point of being pasty. With the amount of moisture the shredded carrot and apple add, this recipe could easily do away with the processed white flour for whole wheat instead, which would take care of the pastiness and add flavor. Definitely increase the cinnamon, to one or two tablespoons. It was barely noticeable.

I LOVE these muffins!  I've been trying to lighten up several recipes, with mixed results.  These are by far the best!

Edits:
-sub whole wheat pastry flour for white
-dropped to 1 Tbsp oil
-upped to 1 cup milk
-1 egg and 2 egg whites
-dropped to 1/3 cup walnuts (still adds bits of flavor)

Mine yeilded 17 at 180 calories and 5g of fat! (less the nuts - 165/3)

These were really good! I'm a health nut, so I made the following alterations: Used whole-wheat flour instead of all-purpose and 1 cup of honey to substitute the brown sugar. My arm was tired enough after grating the carrots, so I decided to chop up the apples and that worked out awesome. I loved having the little chunks of apple in the muffin; it added some extra texture. I also didn't feel like running out to the store to pick up some ground flax seed, so I used 3/4 cup of wheat bran instead and they turned out amazing. They are so moist, healthy and delicious. Thank you so much for the post Jane!

This recipe is great!  I started making these as a way to get some more fiber in my 2 1/2 year old's diet and he loves to eat these for breakfast in the morning.  I changed a couple of things and have had good success.  First, I took out the brown sugar and replaced it with a 1/2 cup of honey and a 1/2 cup of molasses (trying to avoid refined sugars).  Then I replaced the skim milk with 3/4 cup of plain pumpkin puree and added 1 tsp of ground ginger and 1 tsp of ground allspice in addition to the cinnamon.  Finally, I sometimes replace the apples with pears depending on what I have on hand.  Overall, these muffins are nice and moist, not too sweet, and the added spices really help the flavor.

I love these muffins. For those who need more flavor, spice and omega 3: roast 2 cups walnuts, toast and grind the flax, 1/4 tsp. fresh grated nutmeg, 1/4 tsp. clove, ( 1-2 tsp. Ceylon cinnamon NOT!!! CASSIA Cinnamon (China cinnamon) which is toxic to the liver and kidneys probably will have to special order it cause the FDA is letting them sell it now in the U.S cause it is cheaper ), soy milk, t, 1 cup raisins, leave out the oil, use w/w pastry flour. I fill 12 sprayed muffin cups till they are well over the top and cook 30 minutes. Works for me. I love this site. Thanks so much!

I wouldn't say I went into this with a bad attitude, but definitely a defiant one.  I thought there was no way these could be as good, and as adaptable, as everyone said.  So I went a little crazy.  Instead of all-purpose flour, I used half spelt flour and half whole wheat flour.  I used 1 3/4 c. applesauce instead of chopped apples.  I used craisins instead of raisins.  I lowered the quantity of nuts and upped the quantity of carrots.  And they turned out perfectly.  These are so exceptional!  You'd never guess they're healthy- even my kids, who can be picky little pains in the tush about grains, ate the heck out of 'em.  I did make an icing using mascarpone, powdered sugar and milk in case anyone found them lacking in sweetness, but they're terrific plain as well.  One last thing- these are super moist.  Now go make some!

I added some chopped dark chocolate, subbed the raisins for a mixture of cranberries and blueberries, added some unsweetened coconut, and for the nuts had a mixture of hazelnuts, almonds, and macadamia.  SO SO SO good! I think you can do a lot with this recipe!

Very good.  You can hardly tell they have a lot of fiber.  The amount of fruit & vegetables seems to make up at least 1/3rd of the volume, so they aren't mostly bread.  It took me a bit over an hour to create the batter, so I wouldn't turn your oven on as your first step.  I turned my oven on when the batter was finished.  It was heated up by the time I had the batter spooned into the muffin pan.  I sprinkled rolled oats on the top for a nice look.  I cooked mine for 20 minutes and even though the toothpick came out dry, they were not cooked all the way through.  They might even need 25--30 minutes.

I'm so glad I found this recipe. It's exactly what I needed. I was looking for something for my kids to eat before going to school in the morning. Something I could freeze and use when I wanted too, because let's face it pop tarts, cereal bars, toaster items are getting really expensive and they are nothing more than junk food. I feel good about sending them off with these in their bellies. I left the apple peel on since they always say that most of the nutrition is in the peel. Thanks for posting this recipe so I could find it.

I have made this recipe many times.  I have followed the recipe as written and exchanged and omitted fruits and veggies based on what I had in the house.  I have omitted the oil completely.  I have subbed wheat bran for oat bran when I was out.  They have always turned out great.  The only thing I have always done is use whole wheat flour instead of all purpose. This recipe actually makes 24 muffins and generally takes 20-25 minutes to bake.

I was actually just going to post this recipe, after trying it from the pkg of Bob's flaxseed. I found a huge line of his products at Big Lots at a great price. The only difference is there is 3/4 c. brown sugar, which I thought was still too much. There is also no oil called for. I made it exactly as per the recipe and though it took alot longer to bake than 15 min, they were amazingly good. I noted from reading the pkgs of his products that they stay freshest in the fridge or freezer, and that flax seed is best if purchased in the whole seed, then ground in the coffee grinder before using. I bought the bag of oat bran just to use in the recipe, but it also made fantastic oatmeal in the microwave.

This was quite possibly the most INDESTRUCTIBLE MUFFIN EVER!!!
I was rushed through the grocery store and completely forgot to get the flax seed and the oat bran, but I really wanted these muffins badly this morning. So I substituted wheat germ for the flax seed, ground up my own oats for the oat bran and sub'd 1 cup vanilla soy milk for the skim milk (dairy allergy in the family) and did not add nuts (nut allergy here also). The cook time was actually 25 minutes, not 15-20 like the recipe states.
My 6 yr old, 3 yr old and 18 mo old loved them and begged for more! I love it because without the nuts they are only 3 WW pts per muffin and these are some sizable muffins. Definitely a keeper muffin recipe. Maybe next time at teh store I will remember to get the ground flax seed.

I have made these three times now. After the first try, I double the recipe because they are SO wonderful. I do use half whole wheat(more fiber) and half spelt (more protein) flour instead of white and cut back on the sugar. This whole wheat version takes about 35-40 minutes in the oven.

Even after reading the rave reviews, I was still suprised by these tasty, healthy muffins. I took other's suggestions and used whole wheat flour in stead of all purpose, apple chunks instads of shredded and 3/4c of maple syrup in place of the brown sugar. YUM!

This recipe is AWESOME.  I just made them and ate 1 and half! (shared the other 1/2 with my almost-5-year old).  Based on the reviews/comments of others, I did the following:  used 1 C whole wheat pastry flour + 1/2 C all purpose;  reduced the ground flax seed to a little more than 1/3 C (40 g to be precise) and made up the difference with rice bran (50 g - again, about 1/3 of a cup).  I also used buttermilk in place of the skim milk, 1 egg + 1 egg beater (fake egg!), and didn't put any raisins or nuts, as my daughter wouldn't touch them in that case!  SO....I did make some changes, but these muffins are definitely a keeper.  Very moist.  I did only get 12, and cooked them for 21 minutes.  I probably filled the tin too full.  Thank you for the great recipe, Jane!

My grandma made these a lot during my childhood.  I always felt like I was doing something good for myself when I ate one.  Now that I’m grown up, I like to make them too, but with my own twist – I always chop the raisins up so they’re spread throughout the muffin more, and use pecan chips instead of mixed nuts.  To eat, I slice them in half, warm them in the toaster oven, and finally, finish them with a smudge of cream cheese.  Don’t let the name these muffins, or all the healthy ingredients in them, scare you away – if you didn’t see the recipe, you’d never know they had oat bran or flax in them, or that they’re low in fat and full of fiber.  Bottom line?  They rock!  I highly recommend.

Excellent and moist.  I used the basic recipe but had to change the add-in's in order to use what I had on hand.  Instead of carrots and apples, I added a cup of coconut and a cup of golden raisins that I soaked in pineapple juice in order to plump them up.  After filling the muffin tins, I topped the batter with pineapple and a struesel of melted butter, flour, brown sugar and cinnamon.  They turned out very moist and were a hit!

These are awesome. I used whole flaxseeds plus some chia seeds. Whole wheat flour, wheat germ and dates are the only other substitutions i made. Will definitely make again.

These are hard to mess up.  I didn't have oat bran so I used some leftover oatmeal and made up the rest with flour.  As a busy mom of a one year old I didn't have time to shred carrots and apples, so I used baby food instead (8oz applesauce & 4oz carrots) and it turned out great - and much easier! I didn't use nuts since I didn't have them.  This recipe is a great way to add flax to your diet!

This is the best bran muffin recipe I've ever made, and I've tried many!  Moist, sweet but not too sweet, chunky... I used a software program to determine the recipe- if made into 12 rather than 15 muffins- has 282 calories and 35 grams carb, perfect for a quick breakfast while driving.  I would like to boost the protein up a bit if anyone has suggestions.

i just made a half batch of these muffins and baked them in my mini muffin tins (made 18). They were very moist and they took more than 25 minutes to bake. I think I will up the temperature to 375 next time. The carrot didn't add much flavor, though. I think I will add diced apples instead of shredded also. Overall, they were tasty: not too sweet, had great moist texture and they fill you up!
UPDATE: I just made a second batch and used 1/2 cu coconut instead of the raisins. They are so delicious! I also substituted crushed pineapple for the shredded apple (used 1 cup only). I whipped the carrots with the egg and vanilla in the food processor. Took like three seconds and was so easy! I love these muffins!

A tasty high-fiber muffin, and I even used slightly less sugar (but slightly more cinnamon).  To avoid the work of shredding the carrots and apples, I simply blended them in the food processor.  (Used 1 large carrot and 2 medium-sized apples, peeled.) I also used wheat brain instead of oat brain.  Definitely add all of the ingredients, including raisins and nuts (I used chopped walnuts) for the ideal taste and texture.   They do stick to the muffin liners while still warm, but I'm guessing they won't once completely cool, as with most muffins.  They took 20 - 25 minutes to bake, not 15 -20.

This is really good.  I have not cooked with flax or oat bran before, but wanted a healthier quick breakfast muffin.  I was very skeptical, but it really is great.  I'm so glad I bit the bullet and tried it.  My 18-year old daughter admitted she liked them as well.  :-)

Absolutely fantastic.  I made this for my children and they loved it.  I only used 1/2 cup brown sugar and added 1/2 cup of splenda.  I added 1/4 cup of orange juice and substituted the vanilla for orange flavor extract.  I did away with the raisins because no one in this house likes raisins and it came out perfect.  I don't think you can make a mistake with this recipe.  You can play with this one and it will still come out right!

My 10 and 7 year old sons LOVED this recipe. I skipped the nuts (allergies) and the raisins (we don't like raisins in muffins), and used wheat bran instead of oat bran, as I already had some in the cupboard, but other than that left it as it. Was wary when I read some reviews saying they were dry, but mine were very moist. The apples I used gave just over a cup of shredded apple, and the recipe made 14 fairly large but not 'jumbo' muffins. Thanks, these are definitely a keeper in my house!
***I just made another batch and added blueberries, YUM!

Five stars for flavor, moist texture, and healthy ingredients!  I did have trouble finding ground flax seed; I ended up buying it online through The Bakers Catalogue. In order to "trick" my kids and coworkers into eating them, I made the batter (minus raisins and nuts), halved it, added chocolate chips to one half, and added the nuts and yellow raisins to the other half of batter.  I managed to get 12 mini-muffins and 16 regular-sized muffins out of the batter.  This is a keeper!

GREAT MUFFINS!!!  What a tasty way to get oat bran, flax, fruit & carrots into your diet!  I didn't add nuts, used half the cinnamon, grated the apple with the peel, chopped the raisins, used half splenda & half honey for the brown sugar, made them with paper liners and got 24 muffins!  Just took 18 minutes to bake and turned out moist and full of flavor!  This one goes right into the recipe box!  Thanks for sharing Jane!

I love these muffins! I have made them with the oil and without and there is not one darn difference so I leave it out.  I only use 1/2 C of white flour and use wheat flour for the remaining cup.  I add 1/8 tsp each of nutmeg and ground clove and use craisins instead of raisins.  Every now and then I will replace the carrots with zucchini and it works great.  Such a wonderfully versatile and healthy recipe!

Yuuuuuuum. Instead of muffins I did loaves (this recipe made two loaves and it was amazing. I did do apple sauce instead of apples like someone else suggested. These are really moist and just the right amount of sweet. Thank you!

Great muffins for being so good for you.  Tried substituting applesauce for the apples and it worked great.  I've made them several times now, sometimes with or without raisins.  Very good!  My 2 year old loves them with cream cheese!

Very good.  I also changed it up a bit.  I put 2 cups of frozen blueberries, grated 3 apples with peels on for extra fibre and 1 carrot.  They turned out a lovey purple colour and are delicious

Healthy and delicious, I cooked these a tad longer than 20 mins. because I filled the muffin cups pretty full.  Great recipe!

Absolutely the best!  Very moist.  Very tasty.  I make carrot juice a lot with my juicer and throw away a lot of carrot fiber.  Today I used the leftover carrot and apple fiber in these muffins and it was amazing.  I realized halfway into it that I was missing the flax seed, so I used wheat germ in its place.  I'm not sure how much this changed the taste since haven't tried it with flax.  However, it's my understanding that flax oil goes rancid / converts to free radicals at the slightest increase in temperature, and certainly shouldn't be stored after baking at room temperature.  So I won't use it in baked goods anyway.

I was looking for a recipe for filling, good for me muffins.  This fits the bill perfectly!  I love them as do most everyone I know who has tasted them.  I cut the sugar in half and was fine with that.  I also added in some poppy seeds just for fun.  You can be creative with these!  GOOD!

I am making these muffins for the FOURTH time!  My whole family (even persnickety husband and daughter) can't get enough of these muffins.  I am a firm believer of following the recipe on the first try, and it did not disappoint.  The next couple tries I made a few small changes: whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, dates instead of raisins, and flax seed oil instead of vegetable oil.  Even with these changes the muffins are still a hit.  YUMMM!

This is a great recipe! Most baked goods containing flaxseed or oat bran that I've tried tasted gross but these little muffins are delicious.   I followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of substituting 2 tbsp of veg oil for applesauce. Also the recipe says it makes 15 muffins but my batch made 24...you won't hear me complain about that though!

These are delicious!  My favorite bran muffin recipe.  I used half whole wheat flour, egg substitute, and used 1/2 cup honey and 1/4 cup brown sugar to give it a "honey bran" flavor.  I like the apples finely chopped instead of grated.  Omitted the nuts because I didn't have any on hand.  These also freeze beautifully.

This is such a great recipe. We have been making this at least once a month for the last year. My three kids (5,3 and 1) all love them and it's a great way to get some fiber in them. I use apple sauce instead of shredding my own apples to save time but do everything else exactly as stated. Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe is delicious!  I wanted to find a healthy breakfast and/or snack for my husband and this is perfect.  I used honey crisp apples because I think they have the best flavor.  Thank you, Jane!

These are ridiculously good. I use whole wheat flour in place of white flour, egg whites or egg substitute, and Splenda instead of sugar. 

The batch is fairly large, so I freeze them and that works great.

I used a grated pear instead of an apple and added some ginger. These were fantastic and had a great crumb to them, they taste a lot better than what you might think.

I came looking for a healthy flax muffin that would hopefully taste good too.  This one is it.
It makes a big batch and that's what I wanted so that I can freeze them to have on hand.
I used my sweetened soy milk in place of milk and it worked great.  I may cut back slightly on the salt next time.
I baked 12 of them in my jumbo size silicone baking cups (sprayed with cooking spray) and put a 1/3 cup (measure rounded with batter) into each cup and baked them for 30 minutes.  They are a perfect size, not too big or small.

I doubled the vanilla (homemade) and heated it then soaked the raisins in it. I also omitted the oil and used pecans for the nuts. Came out delectable!

Amaaaaaazing I have tried so many bran recipes this is by FAR the best. I used buttermilk and 1/2 cup whole peanuts and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts they were really nutty and filling. I got 18 good sized muffins which came out to 200 cal/each with my ingredients. A great source of Omega fats: flax and nuts and not overly sweet. It will seem dry when you are mixing. Remember to spray your muffin liners with pam so they dont stick.

I had a craving for something healthy (I am leaving for a cruise in under a month -- eek!).

These muffins are so versatile. I substituted Bob's 10-Grain cereal for the bran, and didn't have fresh apples so I substituted organic apple sauce and cut the vegetable oil to 1 T. 

These muffins are so filling and so absolutely delicious! What a great breakfast when you're driving to work. 

I got 24 out of the recipe, and will certainly make them again when these run out. 

Thank you!

I went a little crazy with this one and changed quite a bit.  Although I normally don't review things I change to this extent, I think the changes show the versatility and overall yummy-ness of the recipe.  I made the following changes because of the items that I had on hand:  First, I used white sugar.  Also, I replaced the two cups of carrots with 1.75 cups of peeled shredded sweet potato and .25 cup of unpeeled shredded pear.  Finally, I used 1 cup of chopped walnuts.

I thought the sweet potato might turn out really nasty and undercooked, but it's actually quite good.  Overall, I love that the recipe is moist and fruity without being too greasy.

These are really good!  I left out the raisins, used applesauce instead of oil and added nutmeg and ginger.  I'm not sure if you can buy flax seed in the store already ground since I live in Peru and never looked for it in the states, but I just ground it in the blender.  I also used pecans and almonds.  It made 24 muffins for me, but they were kind of small.  Super moist and flavorful!

I've made these twice. The first time I made it exactly as the recipe stated. Very good, but a 4 star.

Second time, I made some adjustments, and they're amazing. Used currants instead of raisins (a lot less overpowering), chocolate chips instead of nuts. Added 1 t orange zest (made all the difference!). As a shortcut, I stuck the carrots and the apples (skin and all) into a food processor and coarsely shredded them.

Also, used 1 1/2 c Red Mill High Fiber Hot Cereal with Flax Seed instead of the oat bran/flax seed. Much quicker!

All I can say is WOW!!  I used dried cranberries instead of raisins in one batch, and in another batch used frozen blueberries (which increased baking time a bit).  I also used pumpkin pie spice (cinnamon, allspice, cloves, nutmeg, ginger) instead of just cinammon.  Baked a total of 6 dozen for an office event.  EVERYONE loved them!  I can't wait to make more and put them in the freezer for quick breakfasts!!

These are awesome muffins!  Great flavor and texture.  Recipe is also on the back of Bobs Red Mill ground flax seed.  I like to use cranberries instead of raisins.  Don't need the oil either.  They freeze well also.

Mmmm! I love it! I omitted the oil as previous reviewers did, replaced the milk with buttermilk, cut the amount of sugar by 1/4 and added a bit of unsweetned applesauce for extra moisture. This recipe is so easy to work with and can be adapted/modified in many, many ways.

Excellent!  Moist and delicious and chock full of healthy ingredients.  I added 2 heaping Tablespoons each of wheat bran and wheat germ for extra fiber and nutrition and they still stayed moist and tasted great.  I also substituted Almond milk for the skim milk and I imagine buttermilk would also do well.

These are the BEST muffins!  I add blueberries or diced strawberries for a little extra flavor.  I also add a bit of nutmeg and 1 jar of baby food prunes with apples for a little extra moistness.  They freeze well too.

This recipe gets 5 stars, both for taste and nutrition.  You can make them healthier by eliminating both the salt and oil; the recipe really doesn't need either.  Also, I use buttermilk in place of the skim milk; I think it improves the texture. My yield was 18 muffins.

These are fabulous muffins! I used 2Tbsps of apple sauce as a few others had suggested and I used half whole wheat flour and 1/2 all purpose and I never would have known the difference!!
Very moist,  and you could pretty much subsitute many different things into this recipe. I may try a few chocolate chips the next time for a little different taste and sweetness!
Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe-It' definately a keeper!!

Not having married a "muffinman" (although he is definitely a stud-muffin), I put the batter into a loaf pan, did 350 for an hour, and Voila!  This bread was awesome and stayed moist and fresh in the fridge from heel to heel.  I also used "golden raisins & cherries" instead of just the raisins and found that the cherries made it even more delicious.  A definite keeper in our house.  YUM!

Awesome, Jane! These are absolutely perfect muffins. I recently served these at a breakfast meeting,and all the ladies loved these. Several went home with the recipe. Most people wouldn't change a thing about these, but my experimental nature must be creative. Next time I will try half orange juice with half the milk and a tablespoon or two of orange zest. Thanks for sharing.

At first I loved these muffins.....but on the second day the apples had molded. The funny thing is I made choc zuchini loaf the same day and was like, 'oh those green bits are just the zuchini - wait- no zuch in this!' Will try again minus the apple. Had stored in plastic container so am stumped as to why the apples turned green so quick, but still a good recipe.

I used garbanzo bean flour instead of oat bran. Not to replace the bran, of course, but to add a bit of protein. I also increased the milk with about 2 tablespoons since I live at 5,500 feet.
They are delicious, moist and not very sweet (which I, personally, prefer).

My poor little 18 month old has major constipation issues, and these were a huge help to him!  It's hard to find a low fat, tasty bran muffin, so thank you for this recipe!  I used coconut oil instead of the vegetable oil.  He loved them!

I found this while looking for something to do with my carrot juice pulp.  These are awsome!! I did not want to stray to far from the orgional recipe the first go round.  However i added some orange zest a dash of cloves and Ginger. Also increased the vanilla and dash more cinnamon.  My mind is bursting with all the things I can do with this recipe can't wait to add a little pumpkin to this.  My 11 year old loves these to. Thanx!!!

These muffins came out so moist.  You know you are eating healthy, but with the grated apples and carrots keeping the muffins moist, they didn't taste "healthy" at all.  We felt like we were indulging.  And they kept very well (no dryness) for at least 2 additional days.

Substituted same measurements of the following: wheat flour for flax, rolled oats for bran, and olive oil for vegetable oil.
I also didn't add raisins or nuts.

YUMMY! Will make again. THANK YOU!

This recipe came verbatim from the back of Bob's Red Mill package of Flaxseed Meal.  Joe') and 1/2 cup wheat flour (for more protein, low in carbs and sugar - watching the glycemic index; higher in fat but it's monounsaturated and heart-healthy like olive oil).  Turned out really great also.  Instead of raisins (my husband doesn't like them), I used blueberries.  You can substitute items to make it your own.  Enjoy!!

This was way short on cinnamon, 1 1/2 T would have been MUCH better. It was good, nice texture. I added 4 apples for a total of about 2 cups of apple. Seemed just right. Used 3/4 cup whole wheat and 3/4 all purpose flour. Also tossed in about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips since I will be feeding the to the kids :) I was going to toss in coconut but forgot, would have been really good in there too! The oil could have been completely omitted as well. Great recipe with some room for improvement.

new favorite recipe! here are the changes I make. Most of them are just based on preference. I use 3/4 c whole wheat flour and 3/4 c. gluten free flour mix. I use wheat bran rather than oat bran. Soy milk in place of the skim milk and coconut oil rather than vegetable oil. I only use 1 c. of carrot and one apple. Then I add 1 or 2 mashed ripe bananas. Then I prefer to use chopped pecans rather than mixed nuts.

These turned out pretty darn good! They got even tastier as they cooled. I thought these would have more of a fruit taste with the apples and raisins but its really just a slight accent to the bran. I squeezed out some of the apple juice when I was done shredding the apples because I thought it might make the batter too wet. Maybe it would have made it more flavorful? I don't know, I'll try it that way next time. These are good muffins. I made a double batch and froze most of them.

Wow, these are so healthy!  I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose.  Freshly ground flax seeds, and applesauce.  Delicious and they keep me full well beyond lunchtime due to all the fiber!

Really great tasting muffin, though I did make a couple changes because of what I had on hand.  Used grated sweet potatoes vs. carrots and added a little bit of dried fruit-dates and cranberries.  Very moist and flavorful-will be making these again, so thanks for this healthy rec!

I baked one batch at the recommended temperature and time, but ended up leaving them in for almost 30 minutes.  For the second batch I tried 375º for 25 minutes, and liked the results much better.  These are still incredible, though, and the recipe will definitely be a staple for me!

These muffins were great! Came out very moist and delicious. I used already-shredded carrots to save on prep time, wheat bran (because that's what I had in the cupboard), wheat flour to make them even healthier, cranberries (because my husband doesn't like raisins) and chopped pecans. My 16 month old son loves them and my picky husband who doesn't eat "health food" thought they were pretty good. Passed the recipe on to my in-laws and they love them as well. I ended up with 21 muffins so I froze half of them so they don't go to waste. I'll definitely be making these again.

These muffins are amazing! I made a few changes: omitted the vegetable oil, used whole wheat flour instead of white flour, omitted carrots since I did not have any on hand, omitted the brown sugar and replaced with 1/2 a cup of truvia sugar substitute. I also experimented with a few muffins... I cut up orange slices into small pieces (removed seeds) and combined that with the mixture. My husband thought those came out more moist. Either way they tasted delicious! For my second batch, I did use carrots in the whole batch and then also made a few muffins with cut up frozen strawberries and a few more with frozen blueberries... they came out even more delicious! These muffins are truly indestructible. A tip for the apples: I left the skin on them and cut up the apple into slices and put chopped them in my mini-blender.

As other posters have mentioned, this recipe mirrors the Bob's Red Mill Recipe on the back of the flax bag, which does omit the oil.  I followed the bag recipe and the results were moist, dense, chewy medium and mini muffins, that were a good balance of texture and flavor.  Couldn't quite give the recipe 5 stars, because the flavor of the eggs and flax were too persistent in this first batch.  Will have to think on how to remedy this.  However, kudos to the creator of this recipe.  As my boyfriend described, it is a bowl of muesli in a muffin.  Really great.

A great, healthy recipe. I love the texture the bran and flax gives these muffins. I substituted whole wheat flour, unsweetened applesauce for the apples, and instead of raisins I used craisins and chopped dries apricots. They are delicious and I'm especially glad I won't need to feel guilty if I cave and eat a few of them at once.

Too labor intensive. Good taste. Substituted freshly ground spelt flower and no nuts. I love bran muffins but these just lack something. Maybe honey or molasses instead of brown sugar.

We love these muffins.  Great for breakfast on the go! After making them a few times I've made the following changes: use 1/2 cup all purpose flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour, increase cinnamon to 1 tablespoon, increase raisins to 3/4 cup, replace eggs and oil with 1/2 cup applesauce. Bake for 25-30 min. Makes 24 muffins.

I was not convinced.  By the time I shredded everything I wanted to cry.  But, they taste fantastic.  I've used chopped dates instead of raisans as I'm not a raisan fan.  Next time I'm going to use my food processor :o)

Used 1 cup whole wheat white flour, 1/2 cup wheat bran, only 1/2 cup walnuts, sultanas instead of regular raisins, no oil, about 4 cups of zucchini instead of carrots and apples and about 1 cup of frozen blueberries. Yum!

Firstly YUM!  Secondly, WOW!  And Thirdly: Thank you!  First time made to the letter.  Hubby wasn't keen on nuts so second time made without nuts and went down really well.  I've tried substituting oil for apple sauce and sugar for a half measure of sugar substitute and works just as well making them fat and sugar free to boot (other than the natural sugars of the fruit that is).    I make these regularly now but also add 2tsp of mixed spice to make them even spicier and also sometimes do them with two bananas instead of apples.  They really are bootiful!  AND guilt free!!! :D

I must say I was really nervous on how these were going to turn out!  The batter did not smell like something I would want to dig into.  However, after they came out of the oven I put a little smart balance butter on one and ate it and OMG!!!  It was so so so good!  I did use wheat bran instead of oat because my hubby is on a high fiber diet and wheat bran is REALLY REALLY high in fiber.  I also used 1 cup wheat flour and 1/2 cup all purpose flour.  I will be making these often!  I want to make another batch just I can pass them out to friends so they can taste how good healthy can really be!

Great recipe.  I left out the carrots and substituted a cup of applesauce for the milk for more apple flavor.  In my opinion, it needs less sugar and more cinnamon.  I made it into loaves and it baked just fine (took a little longer).  One batch made one small and one regular sized loaf.  Very hearty but still great consistency.

Maybe my carrots just tasted different, but these turned out positively inedible! The carrots definitely were the downfall of these otherwise incredible healthy muffins.

Oh Yummy, I am eating these as I am writing this review and they are soo tasty! I used Scotdogs brown sugar splenda and 1/2 of wheat germ, I also used craisins instead of the raisin. The muffins are not overly sweet.  They came together quick.Perfect Thank You Jane, My new favorite muffin.

Surprisingly light and fluffy. I didn't add the raisins or the nuts, but I'm sure its yummy like that. Next time I will use some whole wheat flour! :)

Awesome muffins.  Healthy, full of fiber and all good things!  I make a batch of these every week. Last week, I made them with all pumpkin.  I fully replaced the applesauce, apples, carrots and raisins with the entire 14 oz can of pumpkin puree.  I also throw in some chocolate chips for fun not health!  I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of honey with good results.  I omitted the oil completely.  Finally, I used all wheat flour.  This is a fun, easy and versatile recipe.

These are perfect paired with a cup of coffee! I made a couple of changes-used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup all purpose, used eggbeaters instead of whole eggs, 1 cup carrots and 1 cup zucchini. and used all walnuts instead of mixed nuts.  Thanks for such a versatile recipe!!

I love this recipe. It's flavorful and healthy. I substituted for 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 regular. I had no oat bran, so used wheat bran...just a bit less. I doubled the recipe and just guessed at how much to add for fruit/veggies. I used 2 carrot, 2 apples and a small zucchini for the filling as well as 1 1/2 cups raisins. I also threw in some applesauce to have the right wetness. I made 24 regular sized muffins (17 min.) and 24 mini muffins (11 min). Thank you. I will make this again.

Great tasting muffins..  My husband has health issues and needs lots of extra fiber each day.  We loved the textures of the apples, carrots, nuts and raisins.  We took them camping, and my 2 year old devoured them, as did we...  I will make these for years.

Great recipe! I agree with the reviewer who said they're missing a little something. I omitted the raisins,used wheat bran instead of oat, applesauce instead of grated apple, increased the cinnamon to 3 tsp, and used toasted almonds. I think I'll double the cinnamon next time, maybe add more brown sugar? I also think I'll omit the oil altogether with the next round as these muffins are very moist and in my opinion get enough moisture from the flax oil, liquid ingredients, carrots and apple.

Okay, I had high hopes for this due to all of the reviews and the "healthiness" of it. But this just didn't work for me. Don't get me wrong, they baked up fine, it's just the taste of them. Maybe I'm just not used to them yet. I may try these again with some different flavors. Thanks for allowing me to try!

These were a hit at my office, home, and the boyfriend's office. I really like them too. :) Yay! The one thing I did different was up the cinnamon to a tablespoon. In the future for more moisture I may add a couple tablespoons of applesauce. To save some time, buy preshredded carrots. That's what takes the longest. Shredding the apples goes quickly.

These are very good.  They turn out really moist and yummy.  I have never made bran muffins before but am trying to include healthier recipes in my families diet.  These are a great way to do that!  Thanks for the great recipe!  I will be making these again!

Great recipe! I made a double batch from reading a previous review, and I'm glad I did. It's so true that this is a recipe you can play with and adapt for your own tastes. I used my own ground soft white wheat, wheat bran instead of oat bran, sucanat for the sugar and soy milk. I didn't add carrots, raisins or nuts for time's sake, but I did add some previously roasted apples. I gave some to a friend, and got raves a few minutes later along with a request for the recipe!

Excellent!  I love bran muffins and these tasted soooo good.  They were a little time consuming to prepare and I wish I had doubled the batch to save time in the long run.  Only alterations were - I used half whole wheat flour, didn't add the nuts and I did reduce the sugar to 3/4 cups which didn't really work.  This recipe really does need the sweetness.  So use the full cup unless you want to add some extra dried fruits like extra raisins, apricots, dates etc to bump up the sweetness.

Used wheat bran instead of oat bran and whole wheat flour instead of AP.  Read another review and used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup splenda instead of 1 cup brown sugar.  This did not work out well for me.  I should of just used all brown sugar.  There was a serious Splenda after taste.  Otherwise, it is moist and has a bunch of health stuff in it. It's disappointing that the nutritional break down lists that each muffin has 10 grams of fat.  That's too much for a little muffin.

This was sooo good. Moist and delicious. Made exactly as stated. Great snack (with 1/2 c. non-fat milk) or breakfast on the go. Tastes especially good warmed up.  The recipe made enough muffins that I will definitely be freezing some. I'm going to try pumpkin and cranberries next time!

Excellent! I've been looking for something healthy to eat for breakfast & these are it. Mine were very moist. I used my homemade vanilla (more than recipe calls for) and I only had oatmeal instead of the oat bran. Cranberries (hubbie doesn't do raisins) and pecans. Very good! Thanks.

These are the best high fiber, high protein muffins I've ever had.  They taste like they're right from the bakery.  It makes such a large amount that I make 12 muffins and a loaf too. I freeze them and take one out when I want a healthy snack.

Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe! Rarely do you find something so healthy that tastes so delicious! I used half white and half wheat flour, 1/4 inch diced the apples, soaked 3/4 cup of raisins in boiling for an hour before using them, 1/2 cup each of ground sunflower and pumpking seeds, added 2 tablespoons of molasses and used 3 tablespoons of coconut oil instead of vegetable (to make up for the seeds instead of nuts) and I added a couple of shakes of cloves, nutmeg and ginger. They are perfect and if it's possible they are better out of the freezer than fresh. What a treat!

Just made the muffins and had to substitute things.  I  ground cinnamon sticks and dried apples in a food processor, pulsed it, then added the brown sugar to it.  I took the mixture and added it to the other dry ingredients. I used  whole wheat flour and oatmeal. I omitted the carrots and added half walnut pieces. Twelve muffins cooked in 17 minutes. Wow!  They are perfect.

these muffins are so healthy and really delicious!  i substituted oatmeal+cornmeal+wheatgerm for the oat bran and whole flax seeds instead of ground flax seeds.  instead of the raisins, i added a handful of craisins and lots of chocolate chips... that's what gets my husband to eat them!

Love these! I made a loaf of bread instead of muffins, and kept a portion of the apple in chunks (really adds a nice juicy component to an already great recipe). Did not have oat bran, so used wheat bran instead, and subbed half the white flour with whole wheat. Who knew health food could be so addictive!

Excellent.  I used all whole wheat flour and  applesauce in place of the oil.  It is the exact same recipe as printed on the brand of flaxseed meal I use (Bob's Red Mill Organic).

UNBELIEVABLE!  I substituted whole wheat flour and applesauce; used 1/4 cup nuts to cut down on fat per other reviewers suggestion.  Don't even bother buttering these muffins - MOIST and delicious as is!  Wow!!  Who knew I'd be baking with flax?!  Note: use food processor for carrots and apple once peeled and cored.

Yummy.  I must have done something wrong because this health food actually tasted wonderful!  I subsituted applesauce for the oil per another reviewer's comment and was glad.  These are so good and moist. Thanks for posting this one!

The recipe is very good. However to make the muffins more 'fluffy' split the eggs and whip the whites before adding them to the mixture.
For the nuts I added Hazel-, Pecan- and cashewnuts...Wow...
Thanx for the great healthy recipe..

These are deliciously healthy, but I gave them only four stars because they lacked flavor.  I used hazelnuts & almonds, and cranberries instead of raisins.  And I used only one apple (all I had on hand), but added extra shredded carrot.  I also cut back the sugar to approx 3/4 cup - I prefer my muffins a little less sweet!

As previously mentioned, this recipe is from the back of the Bob's Red Mill Flax meal package with the addition of vegetable oil.  These are so fabulous, especially warm!!!  I used 1/2 cup unbleached white flour, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, and 1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour, dark brown sugar, 2 fuji and 1 granny smith apple, 1/2 cup walnuts, 1/2 cup coconut, and 1/2 cup dried fruit mix (golden raisins, cranberries, cherries, and blueberries).  This is a true winner!  Made 22 muffins.

Excellent!  I only substituted applesauce for the oil; otherwise I made them exactly like the recipe.  My picky husband and 2-year-old daughter love them.  Definitely a keeper, only next time I think I’ll experiment with the ingredients a bit.  Update- I've since experimented with the recipe.  Don't!!  They are fantastic the way they are and everything I've tried has made them worse.

These are THE BEST muffins!  Sooo moist and tasty.  And the recipe is so adaptable.  A few hints for those of you who don't like the grating - replace the apples with a tin of crushed pineapple (19 oz or whatever size), or dice the apples (this way you get chunks... yum!)  Also can trade the apples or the raisins for blueberries or cranberries.  And we always use whole wheat flour.

A lot of work (next time I'll try applesauce instead of shredding the apples), but worth the effort.  I skipped the oil and was glad I did - the batter was very moist without it.  Also skipped the nuts and still got the 15 yield.  I made some other changes as well (whole wheat flour, fewer carrots) the recipe seems very adaptable.  Thanks Jane, this is definitely a keeper!!

These muffins are great. I was surprised that for the small amount of fat, that they weren't dry!  I change it a bit, I used half whole wheat flour and half white flour, and since I didn't have any oat bran, I used 1/2 cup of oatmeal, and 1/4 cup of bran.

These are great muffins! I replaced the oil with applesauce because it adds moisture without fat. I have lost several pounds since I started replacing my previous sugary cereals with these muffins for breakfast each day. This recipe has converted me over to healthy muffins for breakfast. They are tasty, fast, and highly portable so that you can replace fattier/sugarier or less satisfying snacks. Best of all if you make a huge batch (4 times the original recipe's worth), they freeze very well. I seperate them into groups of 12 or so to freeze, then when I run out of muffins, I pull a new bag out of the freezer in the evening and by the next morning they thaw out beautifully. I pop them in the toaster-oven and two minutes later I have breakfast! If you keep these around, you don't have to cook anything for breakfast for a LONG time (unless you want to). I'm not a morning person. This is a great option for my usual bleary-eyed quasi-comotose morning condition. Also, my highly finicky 2 year old will eat them, which is always a bonus.

This is a hearty wholesome muffin.  For those with a food processor, I highly recommend using a fine shredding blade for the carrots/apple.  I took these to work and they were a hit, a nice change from overly sweet dessert like muffins.  P.S.  This exact recipe is on the side of the package to Bob's Red Hill Ground Flax seed meal available at Trader Joe's.

We LOVE these muffins! They don't last long at our house. I use my "salad shooter" for the carrots, apples, and nuts and it makes it so easy. I use smaller tins (cupcake size) and make around 23 muffins (for portion control.) I have found that they freeze well, so I usually double the batch and freeze half. 30 sec or so in the microwave and they're ready to go!

Absolutely delicious.  My husband loved them, he ate 5 in the first sitting and I had to tell him to slow down.  I would definately make these again.  They are so healthy yet you wouldn't be able to tell. Thanks.

These muffins are delicious! Even my kids loved them. I made a few changes due to a wheat allergy. In place of the all-purpose flour I used a substitute consisting of 2 parts white rice flour, 2/3 part potato starch flour, and 1/3 part tapioca flour. I used 1 1/2 cups of this mixture instead of the flour. I also used "Egg Replacer" instead of the eggs. These muffins are incredibly moist and freeze very well.

Huge success! Thanks Jane Massey for the awesome muffins... the LOW FAT muffins with all the natural fiber goodies. I went in search of foods to help my 11 year old son with medically necessary diet changes for a tummy condition.  He loved them! My mother-in-law loved them too.  Thanks so much for giving me another healthy option for my son. :)

Made these with a few adjustments based on other comments. The changes I made were: about 1 3/4 cup applesauce instead of apples, and just pecans since I didn't have other nuts in the house. Also increased cinnamon to 1 tbsp, and used whole wheat flour. AMAZING! They were incredibly fluffy even with the whole wheat, I think the applesauce balanced it out perfectly. Not overly sweet, but they don't taste like "health food" either - perfect for a quick breakfast with a glass of milk.

Great recipe, thank you!

I made this gluten free:
replaced the all purpose flour with 1 cup white rice flour, 1/2 cup cornstarch and 1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum. 
Replace oat bran with same amount ground flax seeds

Very, very good. I love the fact that it is packed with healthy ingredients and still tastes good. I made a few changes as suggested and inspired by others. I used 3/4 cups of each wheat bran, whole wheat and all purpose flour. I didn't have apples so I substituted with 1 3/4 cup of applesauce. I increased the vanilla to 2 tsp and omitted the cinnamon since I would be adding semi-sweet chocolate chips. I also substituted the carrots for zucchini. I separated the batter into two portions. One portion, I added chocolate chips and made 24 mini muffins (kids!). The second portion I added raisins and walnuts and made 12 regular muffins for the "adults".  Mini muffins baked for 15 minutes. Regular muffins baked for 25 minutes.  They turned out great and the kids gobbled up all that goodness!

Pretty good, the nuts give it a peanut butter like flavor and the raisins, apples and carrots keep things moist.

These are so delicious! I will be making these many times.It is a very flexible recipe. If I don't have a dry ingredient I substitute another dry ingredient I have on hand. Same goes for the fruit.

Excellent as-is!   But if you want to mix it up, add 1/4 cup of cocoa, 1/2 cup applesauce, and some chocolate chips.  You can also substitute baby-food prunes for the applesauce, and the cocoa will mask it nicely.  An easy way to get a lot of healthy fiber into your kids.  :)

These were very tasty & I'll make them again.  I had to make 3 substitutions: almond milk instead of cow milk, craisins for raisins and wheat bran instead of oat bran.  It made 12 super large muffins that took 20 min to bake.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I hoped they would have puffed up or expanded more.  The texture was more like a cake than I expected - dense but very moist. I used the food processor to chop the apples and carrots - perhaps that released too much moisture?  The flavors were quite good.  I'll definitely make them again.   My guy says they are perfect too eat before a work out.  Plan to freeze so he can reheat and take to work instead of buying muffins.

Need some fibre, these are good! Doubled recipe and made the following adjustments I used 1/2 honey for brown sugar, reduced salt by half, yogurt instead of milk, reduced carrots by 1 cup & apples to 2 and added 2 cups of blueberries instead of raisins and nuts. Based on a double recipe. Baked in convection oven at 375 for 18 min. in regular large size muffin tins lined they were perfect!:)

Delicious!   I used whole wheat flour and didn't have any nuts.  I added an extra half cup of both the carrots and raisins and were still quite good.   Didn't rise much though, think next time I will add more baking soda?

i tried this recipe it came out sooooo yummy. I used whole grain spelt flour 1 cup and 1/2 cup flour and Linwoods ground flaxseed (Flaxseed, cocoa, strawberries and blueberries mix) which gave these muffuns an exotic flavour. not only can i enjoy a healthy sweet high fiber treat i can stay well within my calories for weight management along with getting in my omega 3.

This is my first run at this recipe.  I like the combination of ingredients and the taste is okay but could use at least 1 Tbsp cinnamon with maybe 1 tsp nutmeg too.  Like some other reviewers, my muffins were too dry.  I was worried when I was mixing them and was hoping the carrots and apples would have made up for the lack of moisture but no luck there.  I did run out of milled flax while making this and needed an additional 1/4 cup.  I ran some flax seeds through the dry blender, but I'm not sure if that would account for the dryness or not.  I have a fairly dry and crumbly muffin that does not resemble the photos posted of this recipe.  Other than the flax, I followed the recipe as written.  I may try adding a 1/2 cup applesauce and see if that helps next time.

Good recipe. I didn't have flax seed, so I used 1 1/2 cups oat bran.  No raisins, so I added dried cherries.  No mixed nuts, only pecans.  All good substitutions.  I've added these items to my shopping list and am anxious to try the recipe as written. This is obviously a very forgiving recipe, dense but moist, great with milk or coffee. Should make a great breakfast or snack, and it will be easy to alter ingredients for a new taste once in a while.

I've made these twice. The first time I didn't have apples or carrots and substituted pears and yams and reduced the sugar by 1/4 because of the sweet potatoes and they turned out exceptional. Great recipe that you can tweak to your liking. I reduced the sugar by half and added a tablespoon of molasses the second time and they weren't as sweet but still good.  I wanted to reduce the sodium content so I used just a half tsp. of baking soda and 2 tsp of baking powder. Next time I will use buttermilk and that should help them rise even better. Great recipe! Thanks.

DELICIOUS! I did make a few changes: I changed 1/2 of the ap flour for whole wheat flour. I didn't have oat bran so I used 1/2 cup steel cut oats and an extra 1/4 cup flour instead. I used honey instead of brown sugar, coconut milk instead of skim milk, and coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. I didn't have raisins, and I used almonds, pecans, & pistachios for the mixed nuts.

I have made this by replacing the oil with applesauce to make them even healthier. Very filling.  They taste like carrot cake. I put about 1/2 in the freezer to help them last longer. They are still moist when I thaw them out and eat them.

I really enjoyed these! They were very easy to make and my husband -- for whom no muffin is ever quite moist enough -- loved them. I normally don't post changes I've made because then I didn't make the recipe, but I wanted people to know how flexible the recipe is. I used 1 c wheat flour and 1/2 cup all purpose, I combined flax seed and wheat germ, and I used applesauce instead of oil. I also didn't have any apples on hand, so I used zucchini. Delicious muffins that I will make again and again!

I just made these after having lost this recipe (and found it again here)...I do things a little bit different from this recipe---I add a half cup of coconut and a half cup chocolate chips along with the raisins (but omit the nuts).  I also use buttermilk instead of skim milk.  I also omit the oat bran and add 3 tbsp of whole flax seed.  I used to make these all the time, but lost the original recipe...found this one and kind of doctored it to the way I used to make them...at any rate---they are TRES yummy no matter which way you make them (but with my additions and deletions, they are really, really good)

I was a little nervous about this recipe at first, worried it would be dry and hard and tasteless, like many before it.  But I was VERY wrong!!  This is an amazing healthy muffin, that is delicious and moist and very flavorful.  I subbed whole wheat flour and accidentally forgot the nuts, but it was still awesome!  The only thing I found was that it was a little too sweet for me and I will probably halve the sugar next time. I even froze the muffins and have been taking them out daily and they are perfect.   I will be making this again and again.

I think these should be called healthy apple carrot muffins to make them sound more appetizing!  They are deceptively delicious.  I make them often, using almond milk and one tablespoon oil.  I use whole wheat flour sometimes mixed in with the all-purpose.  I've used different types of bran.  They're always moist and delicious!  My 2 yr old loves them.  Lately I omit the nuts.  Great recipe!

This is a very good muffin.  The only changes that I made were to use 2 cups of apple sauce instead of the grated apples and I omitted the nuts as well.  I thought the muffins turned out wonderfully moist and tasty.  I made the recipe for 15 servings and ended up with 24 small muffins.  This is definitely a recipe that I will save and use often.  Well worth the work and effort. Yum!

Halfway thru compiling the batter I said to my daughter "These muffins had better be fantastic because there are, like, 30,000 ingredients!"  I'm happy to report that I was not disappointed :)  These are moist and delicate and delicious.  Before baking the "batter" was mostly shredded carrot with bits of brown barely holding it together, but 22 minutes later they looked just like the picture.  I used extra carrot and sweet potato instead of apples, subbed wheat bran/germ for the oat bran, only 1/2 cup brown sugar, and omitted the nuts.  Honestly they taste like little carrot cakes!  I'll definitely be making them again.

Love these muffins.  So easy and so good.  I fill paper lined muffin tin with ice cream scoop and was able to get 20 perfectly sized muffins.  I ground my flax seeds and store in the freezer along with my bran and yeast containers.  And they do reheat nicely during the week for easy breakfast at work.

I made these muffins last night at they turned out delicious! a perfect snack with my morning coffee.  I found that 2 medium carrots made about 2 cups shredded.  I am sure these would be fine as is but I made a few minor changes, most of which are already mentioned in the other reviews.  I used whole wheat for half the flour (will cut out white flour completely next time), increased the cinnamon to 3 tsp (will add more next time), added a pinch of nutmeg and ginger, shredded one apple but left the other in chunky bits.  I also added a frozen raspberry into the middle of each muffin.  I thought with all the fruit, raisins, etc. I could cut back on the sugar next time as they were bordering on being a bit too sweet for my taste.

I love these muffins! I can't stop making them. I only changed a few things. I left out the carrot and put more apples in, also I put some nutella in the middle of the muffins before baking. Delicious!

2nd year I've made these for my boss (a health junkie & professional swimmer) and my husband (also a health junkie) and both years they raved about them! It's filled with tons of great flavors and you dont have to feel guilty about eating them!

This was my first time trying Bran Flax Muffins and they were really hearty and flavorful.   I used leftover applesauce and was really glad I did.  Husband raved about them also.   Thank you.

Tasty and moist.  I added a bit of nutmeg, and used whole wheat flour instead of oat bran.  :)

These were great muffins that I feel good about eating!  I make a batch for the week and re-heat each morning for breakfast.  They are also great mid-afternoon for a quick, filling pick me up.  Anyone doing weight watchers, mine calculated out to be 4PP, making 20 muffins.
Few changes I made: used quick oats instead of bran, omitted the oil and rasins, used almonds, pastachios and pecans for my mixed nuts, used 2 tablespoons of cinnamun, a pinch of nutmeg, could prob have used more!  
I like these because while they are a  little sweet, you won't find yourself overeating these because they are pretty dense.  It's a complete meal with whole grains, veggie, fruit, and protein.  Great find!!

I love these muffins. I seem to take a lot of time to shred the carrots, and I grind my flax right before use, so I always make a double batch and freeze them. The paper liners don't work for me with these, as too much of the muffin sticks to the paper, and I want to eat it all! They are great as a midmorning snack, freezer to microwave.

We love these muffins.  I add generous amounts of the carrots, apples, raisins and pecans.  I also substitute whole wheat flour for the white flour.  I bake them in 12 LARGE muffin cups.

Excellent!  Used pre-shredded carrots from Trader Joes and chopped walnuts instead of the mixed nuts.  Made as directed and came out with 18 regular size muffins.  Will make again and again.

I love muffins and am always searching for healthy options.  These are excellent!  I did change the flour to 3/4 cup of all-purpose and 3/4 cup of whole wheat.  I also only had walnuts on hand.  They were delicious and didn't last long in our home.

I make these for my daughter who is vegan.  I substitute soy milk and egg replacer or applesauce. I used unbleached white flour.  There is usually more batter than my large 12 cup muffin tin, so I use two Minnie loaf pans which stay in for five minutes longer.  Great and healthy!

Oh my goodness, these muffins are amazing!  I omitted the bran because I didn't have any and used 1 cup white flour, and 1 1/4 cup wheat flour, in addition to a 1/4 cup of almond meal and a handful of dried cranberries.  If the batter is not moist enough, add a tiny bit more milk or oil.  I also cut the sugar to 3/4 cup.    These muffins don't rise very much, but they are delicious and satisfying, especially with a teaspoon of orange marmalade!  Healthiest muffin I've ever made/ eaten!

I really liked the flavor of these. They were a bit heavy, but aren't most bran muffins? I think I messed up a bit by used rolled oats instead of oat bran. I also used 1 big apple instead of 2 which was plenty. I would definitely recommend using a non stick muffin pan instead of cups - I tried both and was so happy that I did. So much of the muffin got stuck inside the cups (at least in the version I made).

Delicious recipe. I needed a good-tasting fiber-filled recipe and found it! If you find it difficult to find ground flax seed, as I did, buy whole flax and grind it yourself in your blender. It was much cheaper and easier than buying a whole pound of ground flax seed for one recipe!   The changes I made were: omit vegetable oil, apples and nuts, and instead use about a cup of applesauce in place of the oil and apples. The next time I make this recipe I will add a little more salt as the muffins were bland without the nuts in them. I also might add a sprinkle of ground nutmeg and ground cloves to make the taste more autumn-like.

These are amazingly delicious! I'm always searching for a way to sneak in the good stuff for our meals and snacks, and this was a winner! I used 1.5 c applesauce in place of apples, increased the oat bran to 1.5 c, added half a bag of blueberries and left out the raisins and nuts. They were moist and yummy! I made one batch w/o blueberries and used raisins instead, they were a bit dry for me in comparison. But as one other reviewer said, as long as you keep the wet to dry ratio about the same, you're in good shape.

These muffins were yummy :) I finely diced the apple instead of grating it and I realized i was out of eggs only when i was making it lol so i whisked some soft tofu then added that instead. Will try again with eggs soon. The muffins came out a bit too moist and didnt rise too much but this is probably because of the no eggs :P i also added some cloves, ground ginger, and a bit of nutmeg because i like the flavour. oh and i didnt add any nuts or raisins. and it made about 16 muffins

This is a simple, tasty recipe.  I reduced the brown sugar by about 1/2 cup and packed in the carrots and apples.  I also used whole wheat "super flour" (add 1 Tb each soy flour, wheat germ, 1 tsp brewer's yeast to measuring cup then complete the cup with whole wheat flour) ) My three year old loves them.  Dense, moist, and deliciously healthy!!

These were moist, dense and delicious. When I made them the yield was nearly 2 dozen muffins. If you're making the muffins larger you should err on the side of overbaking them- 20min may not be enough.

Yum, so delicious and so versatile! I make these all the time for my family and every loves them! I leave out the oil. Sometimes I add a few tablespoons of peanut butter, sometimes a few of applesauce. I used half a cup of Splenda brown sugar mix, and I use whole wheat flour. They're still always delicious, and so variable. Definitely try this out.

I made these muffins with all whole wheat flour, applesauce and blueberries instead of the carrot/apple.  I didnt add any oil just extra applesauce.  I added extra cinnamon cause i love cinnamon flavor:)  Very healthy muffin for quick breakfast on the go:)

Delicious. I made a few changes just to suit what I had on hand...as one reviewer mentioned earlier, I think you can substitute as you see fit here - just keep the dry/wet ratios the same.  I used 1.5 cups whole wheat flour, and the other 1.5 cups of dry flours I combined using oats, ground flax seed, hemp hearts and wheat germ (to total 1.5 cups).  I used dried cranberries and a mixture of pumpkin seeds and walnuts.  I used 1/2 cup of apple sauce instead of the apples.  Really so good and so healthy too!

I have been making this recipe (one reviewer was right, it's from the back of a flax seed bag) for a couple of years and it is the best muffin recipe EVER.  It leaves a lot of room for experimentation of different veggies; squashes are excellent in it.  Thanks so much to the poster of this recipe.  I lost my copy and have been searching high and low.

Very forgiving recipe.  Cause I didn't have apples I decided to exchange them and the carrots for 3 Berry/ applesauce single serve cups and 2 mashed bananas.  Also, used whole wheat flour  instead of all purpose(about 1 2/3C)

Really, REALLY good! I made a few modifications but I loved them and my one-year-old gobbled one down too!  Modifications to "healthify" a little:  -subbed coconut oil for the canola oil -used 1/2 a cup of brown sugar only, then 1/8 c. maple syrup and 1/8 c. honey as sweetener--they are plenty sweet -used 1 c. unbleached white flour and 1/2 c. whole wheat flour  Mine made 18 muffins even without the raisins and nuts to bulk it up. I did add a few tablespoons of sunflower seeds, which were a great addition!

These are so much better than I expected - no grittiness from the flax or oat bran, and not rubbery (common with so little oil - the oil in the flax must make up for it). I make healthy muffins all the time, and these may take the place of my usual multigrain "go to" muffin! I left out the nuts, and got 18 muffins out of this recipe.  4 stars as written, 5 stars with more spice - I used 2 t. cinnamon, 1/2 rounded t. ginger, 1/2 t. allspice, 1/4 t. nutmeg. Could have used a little more cinnamon, IMO. A great recipe!!

Due to personal preferences, I left out carrots, chopped apple, mixed nuts and raisins and added chopped prunes, chopped walnuts and applesauce.  Very good to eat and very good for us.  No comparison to the commercial yuk out there.  I package two to a ziploc baggy and freeze. Then, a quick zap in the microwave to thaw starts the day the healthy way!  Thanks for sharing!!

A new family favorite!  Everyone from the 18 month old to my parents loved this muffin.  I didn't use mixed nuts, just some pecans & subbed wheat bran instead of oat bran...& it was still fantastic.  Great recipe!  Thanks!

Love em!  I did not have carrots and only had one apple, so added some applesauce...also I used All Bran cereral for the bran.  Forgot to add the nuts but they were still fantastic.  As another reviewer said, as long as you keep the wet/dry ratio appoimately the same they should turn out fine.  I made 12 medium sized muffins and saved some of the batter back for later...to that I will add some pecans, coconut and some dried chopped fruit (cherries, strawberries and blueberries).

These were yummy and healthy... just what I was looking for. I used 1 cup shredded carrots and 1 cup shredded zucchini, eliminated the raisins and substituted whole wheat flour. This made 70 mini muffins. I cooked them at 350 for 16 minutes, and they came out perfect. I also took another reviewers advice and kept the dry and wet ingredients in separate bowls and then poured the wet into the dry. Thanks for the recipe!

Kids and hubby rated it an A+!! We normally eat healthy but these are amazing for a healthy muffin.  I think they taste just like the Starbuck's version.  Give this a try! I did follow the recipe exactly except soaked the raisins for 15 minutes in warm water to soften them.  Did adjust for high altitude.

This recipe is AWESOME!!!  I did substitute the sugar for 3/4 cup of honey because my daughter has problems with sugar but they were still sweet and very moist.  They disappeared pretty quickly....Great recipe.  I can't wait to try is with zucchini and other items as other reviewers have done.  It will be a great base recipe for ANYTHING!

WOW!  These REALLY are the BEST healthy muffins I've ever eaten!  Very, very moist.  I used 1 t. ground cinnamon and 1 t pumpkin pie spice.  Also, instead of  vegetable oil I used coconut oil, increasing the health benefits, and soy milk in place of skim.  Incredible...incredible!

This is a very good muffin and after reading several other reviews incorporated some of the suggestions and made a few modifications myself.  I added the 2 T molasses as well as the soda, baking powder and salt.  I used 1 cup of applesauce, not 1 3/4 cup, and substituted Splenda brown sugar and left out the nuts.  This reduced the calories per muffin to 175.  Will definitely keep in my recipe box

I love ththese muffins. As my daughter is VERY active, I need healthy quick snacks to keep her going and these do the trick. I used half the sugar, and added a mashed banana. Next time I am going to add 1/2 cup of protein powder in exchange for flour to balance them out for an awesome high energy snack!!

My fav bran muffin recipe.  Instead of the carrots/fruit listed I use whatever I have on hand, bananas, apples, applesauce or even canned pumpkin.  I've found if I use overripe pears the muffins turn out wonderfully sweet.  Today I'm making pumpkin, since I've no fruit on hand.

I substitute whole wheat pastry flour for all-purpose and use whatever dried fruits/nuts I have on hand.  My coworkers gobble these up.  They are healthy and delicious!  I think you could successfully leave out the oil and nuts to reduce the fat...but nuts are good fats, so I leave them in.

The recipe is a little bland as it is, but because of its adaptability, I'm giving it 4 stars. I used oats instead of flax and more raisins instead of nuts. I used less sugar than called for, and twice the amount of cinnamon. The muffins have a great, moist texture, and needed a few more minutes to cook than stated, but  overall the recipe needs just a little tweaking: more spices and/or sugar, or perhaps honey. It will be good to use oats and flax in this next time, as well as walnuts. I think the raisins should be doubled no matter what.

WOW!!!  10 stars if that was an option!  Because my son is on a wheat & sugar free diet...I changed this up (after reading the reviews I knew it could handle these changes!) and they worked out PERFECTLY:  used Spelt instead of reg.four, 2/3 C honey instead of sugar, rice milk instead of skim milk...I added sunflower seeds because I had no nuts - awesome!  They turn green, but the kids kinda like that.  Healthy, awesome recipe thanks for sharing!!

Very Good.  I doubled the recipe and it made 36 regular sized muffins.  I also added a can (and juice) of crushed pineapple instead of the shredded apple.  I had no apples - and the pineapple added incredible moisture!

They were good! I personally didn't care for them, but my 2.5 year old ate all of them & that was what I was aiming for. I can hide his veggies!! Thanks!

The only reason I gave these 4 stars is because my DH didn't like them.  My son and I thought they were fabulous though and had no trouble eating his share! I didn't have any oat bran so I substituted wheat bran for that.

Pretty good. I'll have to make them again because they turned out a little too dry -- I think next time I'll add more applesauce/oil. Also, I spread some cream cheese on these and they tasted GREAT. I'm planning to fill these muffins with cream cheese next time.

Very good. My husband hates "health" food and he even likes the muffins. A little time consuming to make, but worth it.

These are delicious and packed with goodness.  My 6 & 8 year old girls devoured the first batch and asked for more.  I substituted applesauce for the oil on the second batch and they came out just as moist.

Delicious, healthy muffins for breakfast on the go.  I found these to be very moist and still sweet enough even though I used only 2/3 cup of sugar.  I also used whole wheat flour and subsituted golden rasins for traditional ones.  Putting the shredding blade on the food processor made preparing the apples and carrots very quick and easy. Thanks for posting this recipe.

These are really great. Moist, flavourful, not too sweet-and so much fibre. I had to substitute a bit according to what I had, so I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup oat flour, and instead of oat bran I used oats. I used dried cranberries in place of raisins and threw in 1/3 cup of raspberries/blueberries/blackberries for fun. The nuts I used were a mix of walnuts, hazlenuts and pistachios.

You get more than a third of your daily fiber eating one delicous muffin. Instead of raisins I used dried cherries and for the nuts I used macadamia and pistacio. I filled these muffins to the top and made 17 muffins. 12 of them were bigger sized muffin cups and the tops of them looked a little flat. The regular size muffin tins look better. Thanks for this recipe.

These muffins are so yummy that my 2 year old daughter gobbles them up, even my picky 3 1/2 year old son likes them, and my husband who is skeptical of anything 'healthy' tasting thinks they're delicious!  I used all whole wheat flour instead of white, wheat bran instead of oat bran, and 1 cup applesauce instead of the shredded apples - moist and delicious!

These muffins are great! They almost remind me of carrot cake..yum! I made a few changes due to what I had on hand. I didn't have raisins, so I threw a bit of shredded coconut in instead. I also just chopped up some pecans for the nuts. I used my food processer for the carrots and apples and made shredding them a snap! I will make these again.

Terrific muffins and a great way to use oat bran and flax meal.  I doubled the recipe for my family but didn't have enough carrots so I just added some unsweetened applesauce to round out the carrots and then of course the apples were in there.  I also left out the raisins and nuts to keep the calories per muffin under control (next time I'll try Splenda!), also I think I could cut back on the sugar.  The apples & applesauce make it sweet enough!  I found that I had to cook these longer than expected - about 25 minutes and the ones in my silicone muffin pan didn't cook as well as the regular metal one.  All in all this is a terrific muffin and we'll be making it regularly!

Wonderful muffins. I chopped the apple instead of grating, whick worked fine. And I used applesauce instead of oil.  These will become a time and time again muffin, I'm sure.

Excellent ingredients for a tasty, healthy muffin.  Well liked by adults & small children.  Have made the recipe twice and will continue to make it.
**2nd review - added chocolate chips and used applesauce instead of apples as suggested in reviews.  The chocolate chips take these muffins to a NEW level - similar to a $3.00 muffin we can buy locally!

This recipe is right up my ally.  Very healthy.  Grains, fresh fruit and veggies and nuts.
Very tasty.  My only complaint is that I would have wanted them to rise higher.  Maybe more baking powder would do the trick.  Or maybe just fill them higher and make less next time.
These are great muffins though.  Thanks!

This is definitely a five-star recipe. I used egg substitute and soy milk to lower the cholesterol. I also used only a 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of whole and also cut down on some of the raisins and carrots, because it seemed like too much. Only made 12 muffins. Delicious toasted with butter! Hearty and savory.

This is very similar to a recipe I use regularly--very yummy and addictive, and the fiber content is very high for a "bran" muffin. I substitute Splenda for the sugar with a small amount of molasses for flavor, which cuts the carb/sugar count way down (cuts out about 20g of sugar w/o the molasses).

These are the answer! A yummy, moist breakfast muffin that fills the need for fibre.  I gave these to a few people who desperately needed to "make fibre their friend", if you know what I mean, and this did the trick for all of them, my husband included.

I have made these muffins many times and I love them.  Without the nuts they are much lower in calories.  I also only use 1 Tbsp of oil and it is enough.  This week I made them with frozen blueberries.  Delicious!!

These muffins taste wonderful, but there is one main problem. In the directions, there is no cinnamon, baking soda and baking powder, so I left them out when I was following the directions, which led to very thick and not as tasty muffins. It takes a lot of time to shred the apples and a carrots, so its really frustrating to find youve left something out, it would be nice if that could be fixed. I substituted dried cranberries for the nuts, and they were still great.

Excellent.  I used 1 cup whole wheat pastry flour and a half cup white flour.  The recipe made 17 muffins that took 24 minutes to bake.

Excellent muffins for versatility and taste!  I used whole wheat flour, and with strawberry season here, I doubled the recipe and instead of carrots I mixed 3 bananas and about 10 strawberries to yield around 2 1/2 cups (this is for a "doubled" recipe), and omitted the oil.  Excellent taste and texture resulted.  Also, I noticed on the Flaxseed container there was a recipe identical to this one - but it omitted the oil.  The kids like the muffins warm with butter on it.

these are the best muffins I've ever eaten! they come out perfect every time and are completely irresistable. i use walnuts and always think that maybe i'll leave them out (to cut some of the calories and fat) but it's not worth it, they are what make these awesome. instead i just make them smaller, about 24 muffins. I should mention that i use the recipe on the package of flax, which omits the veg oil and uses only 1/2 tsp of salt. Also i go for the unbleached flour or whole wheat. I sometimes bake them in paper cups, but they come out fine if you just spray the muffin tin first.  they are, after all, the perfect muffin.

An excellent recipe. I subbed whole wheat flour for half of the white, and replaced 1/4 cup of the brown sugar with molasses, because I like a dark bran muffin. I used demerara brown sugar for extra flavor. The only thing extra I had to add was a little more milk, and a dollop of yogurt since the batter was a bit dry.
Will certainly make these again!

These muffins are so tasty!  We modify the recipe by taking 1 cup All-Bran Bran Buds and soaking them in the milk while preparing the rest of the recipe.  Use only 1/2 cup all-purpose flour with the dry ingredients and add the Buds and milk with the wet ones.  It seriously ups the fiber content in the muffin. Also, eliminate the vegetable oil, the flax has enough fat to keep the muffin moist.  Keep these on hand in the freezer for a quick healthy breakfast!

These muffins are awesome.  I have made them many times and have also passed on the recipe to others.  I always make the recipe as is except I substitute blueberries for the nuts and raisons.  A perfect healthy muffin.

I was disapointed in these muffins.  They turned out okay, but I was looking for a bran type muffin.  These came out with the taste and texture of a carrot cake muffin.  Probably won't make these again.

I'm glad these make a lot because we snacked on them all day!  I followed the recipe except I used half whole wheat pastry flour and half regular white flour.  They were great!  We didn't butter them or anything and the whole family liked them.

This is a wonderful recipe and it's hard to believe these muffins are so healthy.  Instead of nuts, I put a spoonful of a mixture of craisins, peanuts, sunflower seeds and cashews on top of the batter.  Not only delicious but gorgeous to look at.

VERY TASTY!!!!  I did not have a food processor, so grating the carrots
 and apples did take more time than the recipe stated.  But the time was
 worth it.  My kids even thought that the muffins were "OK". (Which is good,
 when you are talking healthy muffins like this)  A real winner!!!!!

I am trying to add some flax seed into my diet, so wanted to try this recipe. I used banana and apple sauce for the fruit and they came out really good. Moist and sweet and love the nutty taste the flax seed and bran adds. I got two dozen from this recipe. We will eat some now and freeze the rest for quick breakfast before work. You heat at 300 for 10 min and they are ready.

Amazing! I may not have followed the recipe exactly as I didn’t have raisins, apples or oat bran. I used dates, applesauce and bran flakes and ate two of them fresh out of the oven! The walnuts added a nice crunch and I guessed at the flax seed and ground my own so it was less than what the recipe called for. Definitely my new favorite recipe!

I made the recipe exactly, except I omitted the nuts. It took some time to prep the ingredients but it's well worth the effort. I had one as soon as it was cool enough to eat and felt it could be a little sweeter. But hold on, the next day I had another and it was perfect! I wouldn't change a thing the next time, except I'd still omit the nuts.

I was expecting sawdust, because I'm not a fan of bran muffins, but this recipe is really good.  I wanted a recipe with fat in it, so I changed the fat to 3/4 cup coconut oil, reduced the milk to 1/4 overflowing cup of coconut milk, switched the raisins out for diced prunes, increased the cinnamon to 1T, and then decided to go with 1/4 cup oat bran and 1/2 cup wheat bran.  I also used whole wheat pastry flour instead of regular flour.  I skipped the nuts.  You may think that's a lot of changes, but I wanted a lot of fiber for a camping trip.  I really packed the shredded carrots in tightly so I could use maximum amount and used large granny smith apples.  I used really good ingredients ( all organic).  The result is WOW.  A moist fluffy muffin.  Make sure to mix in the baking soda and baking powder last.   I immediately put the changed recipe in my handwritten cookbook, and I don't do that often.  So if you want a truly terrific bran muffin recipe, stop here.

I Loved this recipe, very interchangeable.  I only had one apple so I grated a small zucchini to replace the second apple.  When the recipe said mixed nuts, I used salad topping,(pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and dried cranberries).  I will certainly make them again.

They were great! I ended up only using a half a cup of shredded carrots and a cup of chopped apples. Was perfect for my taste.  I probably added a little extra cinnamon also.

I struggle with the prep time on recipes.  Sure, if someone had measured all the ingredients and shredded the carrots and apples for me, I could have assembled in 10 min.  These muffins took me about 75 minutes to prepare and 25 to bake.  I knew before I started it was more than a 10 min prep time based on past experience.  I bake a lot.

I am in love! I made this because another friend had them and suggested them to me. I don't bake often, so this was surprisingly easy to do. My only complaint was that I was unable to find oat bran in the store, so I just substituted in rolled oats and it seems to of worked just fine. Tastes WONDERFUL!

These were the best of two worlds-flavor and healthy!  My husband loved them, too.  I might try them with applesauce or a sugar alternative, but don't want to tamper with perfection.  I shredded the carrots more than usual so the muffins were a lovely texture.

As the other reviewer said, it is great to "fiddle with" keeping the dry/wet ratios.
I omitted carrots, but topped each with coconut which toasted nicely. Can also see it with an apple/date combo. Will keep as a go- to for high fibre muffins, especially no-fat as I used the applesauce option

This is a fantastic, recipe that's easy to customize. I'm looking for as much fiber as possible, so substitute oat flour for the all-purpose. Instead of two eggs, I use 2 TBS of ground flax seed to 6 TBS of warm water. I've used carrots, but instead have also substituted grated zucchini and another time an 8 oz. can of crushed pineapple in its own juice. I've added walnuts and pecans at different times and several types of dried fruit- raisins, dried cherries, orange flavored dried cranberries and dried blueberries. They taste great and keep well. Between my son and I, we go through them in about a week.

Delicious and healthy, this a great recipe!

I substituted whole wheat flour for the A/P , large flake oats for the oat bran, & dark chocolate chips for the raisins. The recipe halved nicely.

Great recipe - healthy without tasting healthy.  Great for using random ingredients in your fridge. I used light spelt flour and cut the sugar back to maybe 2/3 cup light brown muscovado sugar. I used 1/2 wheat bran and 1/2 oat bran and they turned out fantastic :)

Easy recipe and it tasted great. I used my leftover pulp from my cold juice press. Carrot, beet, apple, red/yellow pepper. My wife loved them as you can see in the picture.

This is a very nice, moist muffin!  I recommend baking for the full 20 minutes because I can see how underbaking would make them pasty.  I didn't change anything, and they turned out just fine.  This recipe made 24 muffins for me.  Perhaps making a higher quantity of smaller muffins made them less pasty, too.  I will definitely be making these again and experimenting with different ingredients!

I turned it coconut.  I substituted skim milk with creamy coconut milk ( Whole Foods 365), then top the muffins with coconut shreds.  I omitted nuts because of allergy.  Result:  a delicious tropical flavor.

This recipe is fantastic for added fiber and still tastes yummy. I ususally substitute whatever extra fruit there is around: mashed bananas insted of grated apple, extra carrots, pineapple. Coconut and chocolate chips are also good.

Love this recipe.  It's a huge hit with my friends too.  A couple edits I make:
- Fill muffin tins to the top.  It doesn't rise that much and you want them to have a rounded top.
- Bake for 25 minutes (at least in my oven); they need to go a little longer.
Also, I normally don't have "mixed" nuts in the house, so I'll use all pecans, sliced almonds, etc.

This is my third time making this recipe, and every time my muffins  turn out really nice. At first time I didn't have apple so I used  carrot only and I added a pinch of grated nut meg. My last attempt I added one apple only and still tasted amazing.  I used 1 and 1/2 cup of ready mixed grain(Hodgson Mill) which has oat bran, quinoa, milled flaxseed, untoasted wheat germ and cracked whole wheat. Next time I will use whole wheat flour instead of white flour, and I am sure will taste even better. Thanks for this DELICIOUS  recipe.

This is an excellent  recipe!  My 6 year old son who's a finicky eater absolutely loved them!  Did not have raisins on hand so I've substituted craisins instead and just chopped walnuts instead of mixed nuts.  Easy peasy!  Will be part of my rotational muffin lunch box treats!  Thank you for posting this yummy recipe!

I made these by substituting a very ripe mashed avocado for the oil and yogurt instead of the milk. I also added a handful or so of old fashion oats - just  because :)  Very good!

Really good! I like to make my muffins really flavorful, and so I added extra cinnamon and vanilla, as well as a tsp of cloves. Additionally, I added a scoop of Plant Fusion Protein Powder to increase the protein in them. I did not use any oil. And I only used 1/2 cup of milk, and then a 1/2 cup of water.

Great recipe.  Reduced the servings to 12 in order to fit into my muffin pan and quantity came out perfect.  Looked like it was going to be too sweet so I reduced the brown sugar to about 1/2 and sweetness was perfect for me.  Also, left out the oil and one apple and instead added one individual serving cup of apple sauce,  The wet ratio makes a dense muffin but that's the way I like them.  Its a keeper.

Very good, like another recipe I grew up with (morning glory muffins), but much healthier. I tend to add extra (chopped, not shredded) apples.

Took twice as long to bake because it was watery. As for taste it was not sweet and the texture was crumbly and fell apart. you can def. taste the flax which is fine - others may not like this, I shred my carrots finely which made this look very orange.  I have to eat this with a spoon. It is not tasty. I will have to try another recipe for a healthy carrot muffin. I followed this recipe exactly.

I love this recipe!! Everyone I made it for chose this over rice crispy treats and they rave about it. 

I just changed the oil to red palm oil (just to try it in a healthy recipe and it was wonderful)
And I used half brown sugar and half raw palm sugar because it's a  much lower glycemic index sugar for my diabetic peeps).

I was looking for a recipe so I could reproduce Trader Joe's mango/blueberry/cranberry muffins.  This one was really close and they turned out great.  I left out the carrots, apples and raisins and subbed in the mango/blueberries and cranberries.  They did need to bake a little longer than the original recipe.  This recipe is a keeper!

This was a great recipe.  I didn't have oat bran, used whole wheat flour instead.  I also didn't have raisins, so I used dates.  They froze great.  I will definately make these again.  Thanks.

Really great Recipe.  I made a few changes as usual.  I substituted 1/2 cup maple sugar for the 1 cup brown sugar and used whole milk and 1 tsp olive oil.  I also left out the nuts and rasins as they were made for my toddler.  Enjoy!

Darn good for such a healthy muffin.  I substituted 1/3 pure maple syrup for the brown sugar and apple sauce for the oil.  I also mixed the dry ingredients together (including raisins to keep them from sinking in the batter), then in a separate bowl the wet ingredients, then I put the wet into the dry and mixed, then added the carrots and apples.  Baked for 18 minutes.

For me, 3 medium carrots was 2 cups shredded.  Four medium apples was 2 cups shredded.  I used both red and green apples.  I got 21 muffins from the recipe.  With my modifications, each muffin is around 105 calories!

These are great fresh out of the oven.  I found they became very sticky by the next day.  Very tasty though, loved seeing my 4 year gobble one down.

These muffins are out of this world!  I made them in mini-muffin form and froze them (mostly to stop myself from eating the entire batch when they came out of the oven :)   I'd pop a couple in a ziplock bag and by the time I was headed to work on the train, they were thawed and absolutely delicious!

These were delicious!  I used white whole wheat flour, substituted dried cranberries since I don't care for cooked raisins, and increased cinnamon to 2 1/2 tsp.  Yum!

Great recipe. Omitted the sugar. I used applesauce instead. With dried fruit and applesauce there is enough sweetness in the muffin. I used whole wheat flour and whole wheat bran. Instead of the apples I used and applesauce. I also used dried cranberries and almonds. Cooked for 25 minutes in the larger muffin pans. This first batch tastes salty to me. Will omit the salt next time. But consistency and taste were overall great. Very moist.

These muffins are so good. I loved them. They are so moist.  I did make a few changes. I used spelt flour in place of the all-purpose flour, grape seed oil in place of the vegetable oil, almond milk in place of the skim milk, & evaporated cain juice in place of the brown sugar.

I think these are the best bran muffins I have ever had. This is it, I will keep this as my go to bran muffin recipe from now on. Usually when I have had bran muffins, they are dry and hard to swallow. These are chewy and moist yet dense with fiber and flax goodness. My kids gobbled them all up and had no idea how good they were for them, but I did. In fact, my kids called them cupcakes and that is fine with me! Thank you for sharing this recipe. I have emailed it to my entire family.

I am not sure what went wrong in this recipe but it took forever to bake the muffins and when they came out they did not taste good at all. My 1.5 yr old loves them and since they're healthy we're happy to give them to her but we didn't like them at all.

These were great.  The kids were in the mood for chocolate chips, so I made a few changes.  Here was my mix: 1 1/2 c whole wheat flour, 3/4 c ground flax seeds, 3/4 c oat bran, 3/4 c brown sugar, 2 tsp baking soda, 2 tsp baking powder, 3/4 c milk, 2 eggs, 1/2 c unsweetened applesause, 1 c chocolate chips (I split the cup 3 ways with organic semi-sweet, dark chocolate, and carob chips).  Thanks so much!

These are 5 star muffins as written, but I substituted in subsequent batches: whole wheat flour, less sugar, applesauce, and no mixed nuts. Lately I sprinkle some crushed pecans on top for a bit of roasted nuttiness.

I used 1/2 c WW flour, 1 c regular flour.  I didn't add raisins or nuts and that was a mistake. My rating is based on the way I made it, not the recipe. They came out okay.  Definitely moist and don't taste like carrot at all.  The fruit and nuts will add sweetness and texture which would make this a 5 star muffin.

Love, love, love these muffins!  I make them mini for the perfect size snack when I get the munchies.  I've also substituted 1/2 a banana for the eggs, and soymilk for regular milk to accommodate vegan friends - it turned out just as yummy!

I used 1 1/2 cups bakers bran since I didn't have any flax on hand, then ground some red cabbage up in my processor (figured the kids wouldn't notice 1/2 c. of it, weird thing...it turned GREEN when it cooked so they look a bit strange, but my picky kids are eating them hot out of the oven, sooo...) also 1 c. applesauce in place of the apples, and added to carrots, dried cranberries, and raisins and up'd the cinnamon to 3 tsp. Despite the odd color mine took from my experiment with leafy greens, they tase great. My 4 yr old dtr announced she wanted these "cupcakes" for her birthday...hmmmm...a tinsy bit of icing and voila! healthy birthday option? maybe!

I made these muffins to use some flax seed that I purchased on sale.  They are delicious and very moist.  The recipe does make 15 muffins so I freeze the left-overs in a zip-lock bag.  If you pop some out in the morning before work, they are thawed for a mid-morning snack!  Last time I made them, i added a little mashed sweet potato.  This is a good basic recipe.  I'd like to try it with the addition of cranberries.

Delicious!  I love these muffins.  I used ground up oats rather than oat bran.  They only took 12 minutes to bake in my oven.  They are super moist and I ate 4 in one sitting they were so good.

I've made these a few times and I love them because they feel so good for you. Sometimes I reduce the sugar if I want to be super healthy and switch up the nuts and dried fruit. I like them for breakfast.

So delicious!  I made these 2 nights ago and can't stop eating them. I used 1/2 white flour and 1/2 wheat flour instead of all white and used non-fat milk in place of skim. These are so good - I'll definitely make them again.

Yummy!  I used 3/4 cup whole wheat flour and 3/4 cup white.  Didn't have any oat bran so I just used quick oats.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly (minus the nuts) and these are sooo tasty.  My bake time was more like 25 to 30 minutes, though.

I am always looking for ways to get my son and husband to eat healthy!! This is a great recipe. I used wheat bran instead of oat bran. The muffins turned out so moist and delicious.  Thank you for sharing!

Perfect- not too sweet, not too "bran muffin". I absolutely loved them and keep them in the freezer- pop one out and zap it for a few in the microwave and it's breakfast on the go! Even though my 6 and 8 year old were not equally thrilled, I believe this recipe is a 5-star combo of tasty and healthy- kudos Jane!!

Doesn't really need the oil, just add a TBSP of applesauce. Also the sugar could be cut back a bit. It was super sweet, but so yummy! Its like a healthy carrot cake. I can't stop eating it!

Very good!!!  I replaced the Flour with Organic Kamut Flour and the Bran with Spelt Bran. I also eliminated the oil and replaced it with Banana, the muffins were extremely moist.

We sub'd cranberries for the raisins. Didn't have oat bran, used quick oats instead (probably alters the nutrition a bit) but was EXCELLENT!! & replaced 1/2 flour with whole wheat flour. I have to admit, I was pleasantly surprised with this one. They are moist, the kids even love them. I freeze the muffins and stick one as needed in the microwave for 30 sec. they are delicious.

Yum! Yum! Yum!  I live off these muffins!  Jam packed with goodness and hearty foods - enough to keep me full all morning long.  I substitute whole wheat flour for the regular and it works great!  Drizzle them with a touch of honey and you are set!

I really enjoyed these muffins. I needed something quick to eat in the mornings that was healthful and these are perfect. My boyfriend liked them and my mom said they were some of the best muffins she'd ever had. I followed the recipe and it worked fine, except I dropped the nuts and used pieces of dates instead of raisins. yum!

I agree with everyone, these muffins are amazing and foolproof! Nothing I can change ruins them! The biggest change I've made is cutting out the eggs all together (I started the recipe before I realised that we had run out), but they turned out great anyway! Really easy, healthy, and yummeh!!

Healthy, but bland. Many ingredients, but very versatile. This is a good recipe because it is so versatile. I did make this recipe exactly as read, but the flavor was actually quite disappointing. It's amazing, that with all the ingredients called for, it still comes out that bland. I always use fresh spice. I will most assuredly make these again, but it needs more pizzazz! I will add a teaspoon of nutmeg next time and I may also need to increase the cinnamon as well.

Delicious and healthy! One word of caution - do not undercook. These are very dense, so they might take some extra time... especially if you're making jumbo muffins.

But I will make them again (with slight adjustments).

This is a really good recipe, but I think that it is still missing something. It comes off as a bit bland. Perhaps some more cinnamon and/or some pumpkin pie spice would do the trick.

OMG!!  These are awesome!  I'm not a fan of raisins, so I just put in a couple of handfuls of homemade granola in instead of the raisins and nuts.  Absolutely awesome.  And the kids (5 and 1) love them too.

Made them according to the recipe (minus the raisins).  Flavorless and gluey despite good quality ingedients.

Absolutely love these!!  I like to add almonds and prunes to these to increase the fiber along with All-Bran about a 1/2 cup and use egg beaters to exchange the eggs.  Great recipe

I chose this recipe b/c of all the reviews that said substitutions would still yield a great muffin - that was so true!  I ground some oats and used that instead of the bran and they were just so good!  I also used a wheat-free flour blend and the consistency was still great.  My hubby and 5 yr old both loved them and I can't wait to pull them out for breakfast in the morning!

I substituted the raisins for frozen cranberries for a little extra tartness.  These are good, and high in omega 3.

Mine ended up a little too moist so I think I'll use smaller apples next time around('two apples' can really vary from recipe to recipe!). I'll definitely make them again, it's a great way to get my one year old to eat carrots! I used whole wheat pastry flour instead of all purpose and coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and sprinkled wheat germ on the tops before baking.

Wonderful.
I have a very similar recipe already from Novata Terra Inc. 
I used Kamut flour, and a 1/4 cup scottish oats to make up the rest of oat bran, also used 3/4 cups of raw sugar and walnuts for the nuts.
My teen boys are not so crazy for healthier baking anymore soooooooo I'm going to icing a few with cream cheese icing for them! My recipe made 22 medium size muffins. 
I will make these again ;)

These were pretty good but turned out a little dry for me.  The batch made closer to 22 muffins rather than the 15 stated so I froze some and after they thawed I thought they were much moister and tasted better then fresh. I don't think I will make them often since my picky kids and husband would not eat them, however, I thought they were very yummy.

Yummy Yummy Moist Moist Yumminess...  who knew so much fiber could taste so good and be so moist?  For the flour I used half whole wheat and half all purpose.  Can't wait to try fruit variations.  At the risk of being redundant, YUMMY!!!

This is a very healthy muffin full of good ingredients!  However, I only added 1/2 a c of sugar to cut down on the calories, and it's definitely not sweet enough so I might add 3/4 c next time.  Also, I used only one apple and 1 c. apple sauce, and 5 carrots.  I also added sunflower seeds, which was a good addition to the muffin.  All in all, it was delicious, and I will definitely make it again with the increased sugar.

Perfect muffins. Some reviews said to cut down on the sugar so I did, but found they weren't sweet enough. I used apple sauce instead of oil. Tasted fine, but they stuck to the muffin cups. I passed on the raisins but put the nuts. They came out so nutty and delicious!

Very good recipe.  I found it to be sweet, but then I substituted All bran cereal for the bran (which the cereal is sweet) and a can of well drained crushed pineapple for the carrots (I was out of bran and did not feel like grating 2 cups of carrots!).  I also forgot the baking soda, but the muffins turned out - a little extra moist- but good nevertheless.  My 11 year old son absolutely loves these, and would eat the whole batch if he could for a meal.  If I were to do the recipe again, I would probably cut the brown sugar in half and remember the baking soda, so the muffins would rise.  Also, I got 24 muffins out the recipe, but I'm not complaining!  The more the merrier!

These are awesome.  I didn't have any bran so I just blended up all bran cereal and it worked like a charm.  I also added an orange to the recipe, I put all of the fruit in my food processor instead of grating it and it was super easy.  I would also reccomend using 1 1/2 cups of rasins.

These were good although I made quite a few changes to make them healthier. Applesauce instead of apples, Enova oil, and splenda brown sugar blend. For being so healthy the taste was pretty good but not fantastic.

I followed the recipe exactly, but I separated the egg whites from yolks and beat the whites before adding them to the blended dry and wet ingredients. These are great, not too sweet. But I filled the muffin cups as described, and my recipe made 24 muffins, not 15.

These turned out well, but for some reason, noone felt like eating them after having part or one whole muffin.  I guess the taste could have been sweeter, but I guess that is to be expected of something so "healthy."

LOVE these muffins! They are healthy (good oil, from the flax seeds) and filling.  They also freeze wonderfully -- I make a double batch and keep them in the freezer for handy snacks and breakfast.

This is my new favorite muffin recipe.  These muffins are moist, delicious and healthy, and do not stick to the papers like many low-fat recipes.  I substitute 1 C of chopped dates for the raisins and 1-1/2 C applesauce for the chopped apples.  Thank you, Jane for sharing this wonderful recipe!!!

I love these! I took them to work and they are the new healthtastic muffins! I didn't have enough flax seed so I substituted the rest with rolled oats... and I only diced the apples and I was so lazy I got pre matchsticked carrots... they were still good and way better than getting a coffee shop muffin every day. I ended up with 24 muffins, but maybe my pan is small. Definitely making these again adn again! Thanks!

Substituted canola oil for veg oil.  Added extra spices, a bit of wheat bran, currants instead of raisins, and some coconut.  Very good - best bran muffin I have made.  These are great for a husband who tends to skip breakfast - much healthier choice than stopping for a doughnut!  I pack a few in sm freezer bags and pull out a bag as needed.

These are really good, very moist.  I used whole wheat pastry flour, rome apples,  and almonds.  I substituted a cup of buttermilk instead of the 3/4 cup skim and Sunsweet Goldens and Cherries instead of raisins.  I also put in an additional teaspoon of cinnamon and doubled the vanilla.  My recipe yielded 20 regular size muffins.

Yum!!! And so healthy, too!  I substituted whole wheat flour for half of the flour and they were still moist and good.  My kids, neighbors, everyone loves these.  Thanks for the great hit!

Anyone know how to reduce the sugar?  Dates perhaps?

This was a pretty good muffin recipe.  Next time I make these I'm going to try putting in some butterscotch chips or some chocolate chips.  Tasty!

Pretty good. I added a bit more spices, as suggested by another reviewer. Next time I would add even more. I left out the raisins, as we don't like them. If I make these again I will try dried cranberries. They are very dense muffins, as expected. I used Large size paper muffin cups: the recipe made 28 of these. Next time I will just use a non-stick muffin tin: if not completely cool, a lot of muffin sticks to the paper.

EXCELLENT RECIPE and excellent source of fibre!!  Next time around (and there will be a next time!) I will try adding some zucchini as I think it will add something.  I'll also add some more spices such as clove and nutmeg.  Thanks for a keeper!!

These had a good flavour, but were a little too small and heavy for my liking.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I used dark brown sugar and substituted applesauce for the apples and they were great!

Oh my gosh...these are DELICIOUS!!  I made them just as written and used the food processor to shred the carrots & apples very fine.  Very moist and just a little sweet...perfect!  Next time I may try to add a little nutmeg & clove to give it a little more of a "spice cake" taste.  I did plump up my raisins a bit by cooking them in a little bit of water so they would be soft...mine were a bit more dried out than usual to begin with.  I got 22 muffins using a regular cupcake size tin.  Rose nicely.  Great recipe.  Oh, and it is just a bit different than the recipe on the flax meal bag...they omit the oil.

I made these and took them to work. Huge hit! Even the non-sweet eater in our group loved them. Prep takes a bit of time, so plan ahead. The flavor and the nutrition is well worth it. Next time I will try using the already shredded bagged carrots These are good plain or with a bit of honey.
This recipe is a "keeper". Thanks Jane!

YUM! Followed the recipe almost exactly (left out the raisins) and it turned out even better than I expected. These are perfect for an on-the-way-to-work breakfast on a busy weekday. Will definitely be making these again.

These are really really great!  I add blueberries or other fruit sometimes too.  My husband is crazy about these muffins, and takes them to work, where they are greatfully received.  My 2 year old also gobbles them up with glee.

These muffins are low fat and very tasty.  The recipe is very easy, although the shredding is a bit time consuming if you don't have a food processor.  Overall they're really yummy!

this is a fabulous, healthy recipe!
but we do not have a food processor, so it took me a while to grate the carrots and apples.  
but they taste great!
