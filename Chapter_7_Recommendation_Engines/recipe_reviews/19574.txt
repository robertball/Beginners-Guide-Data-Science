I feared this recipe for a long time. Heather had been threatening to make it for several weeks, and each time I had been able to deflect her loaf-making frenzy.

But finally, on a night when I was tired and disoriented, she convinced me to put my feet up and read while she made the vegan nut roast for dinner. After a few hours in the oven the nut roast emerged an altogether different loaf. By the time it was done, it was less a nut roast than a simmering nut stew.

Heather took a bite, and I followed. I feined a smile for several seconds as I tried to ignore the flavor, but Heather rescued me with her angry admission that she hated it, and it was ok for me to hate it too. Forcing myself to swallow, I spilled out my hatred and said "I hate it. It's terrible and I never want it again,"

I scooped the wet loaf into a bag, where it sat, warm and disturbingly pliant to the touch. It hit the bottom of the dumpster with a thud and the unmistakable sound of thick nut roast escaping onto the floor. Now Heather and I are over the whole ordeal, although occassionally I wake up in a sweat, fearing I'll hear the sound of a mushy appendage squooshing against our window, begging us to give it a second chance.

THANK you Maryanne for the great recipe!

Made the recipe a few weeks ago and will be doing so again today. Use as much milk as needed to bind the mixture, not to drown it. If you do everything accordingly the loaf will come out firm and taste amazing. The only small adjustment i made was adding different nuts (walnuts, macadamia nuts, almond meal and i added some spicy pepper). 

As usual there is plenty of people who are very unimaginative when it comes to cooking. It even says in the description that you can experiment with different nuts and vegetables, you can even try more spices or different spices. The fact that you or your spouse can't cook doesn't mean you should leave bad feedback.

Five stars with my spice ad-lib, but this was a good start. My first time making a nut roast, so I changed a few things after reading the other reviews, and the roast became a thing of beauty!   Left out the bread crumbs because I was not sure they'd be acceptable to our visiting vegan. Added garlic, mushrooms and cashews, and changed the spice to hot curry powder (spicy hot Madras style), cumin and thyme.  Because of the 'too soupy' comments, I used enough soy milk to bind, and cut the recipe sort of in half. I think you have to trust your cooking instincts when it 'feels' like the right texture. Totally vegan, and the carnivores were fighting over the small bit that was left!! Will make it very soon again, and even keep it vegan.

My husband may not ever forgive me for making this -- and both of us are vegetarian! After realizing that our dinner was inedible (after preparing it over a 2-hour time span), we ceremoniously scraped the loaf into a garbage bag and tossed it outside in the dumpster. Maybe now we can begin to heal.

Ok, after reading all the reviews, I took the constructive comments from both sides and created what can only be called "heaven on earth" as a vegetarian family. My husband is a meat and potatoes kind of guy who has recently become a vegetarian and he LOVED it. We got Italian bread crumbs so they were already seasoned. Because of this, I just seasoned it to taste with a little more Italian seasoning, basil, and sea salt. We used almond milk instead of soy milk and only enough to bind everything together into a meatloaf type of consistency. Instead of using the loaf pan, we put it in a round 9 in. cake pan. It ended up tasting like Turkey Stuffing from my pre-vegetarian days. This was a huge hit in our home (even with my super picky son)! If you tried it before and it didn't work, give it another shot. I'm making it again today because we didn't have any leftovers!! :)

I was pleasantly surprised at how good this was.  My 16 month old son loved it!  Even my meat loving husband found it quite tasty.  Next time I will add mushrooms and bell peppers.  Mmmmmmm!

Fantastic.  I have served this to vegetarian friends who have raved, and to my meat-n-potatoes family who insist they have never had better.  I love this recipe!

As a meat-eater, I have to say that this is not bad for vegan food. :-P Pretty easy to make, too. Plus, you can make it ahead of time and refrigerate until you want to bake it.

Decent, not great.  Doesn't cook at all on the inside - after cooking for 90 minutes, it was still mush inside.  We spread it out in a 9x13 pan, which was better - got decently firm throughout.  Not exactly sure what kind of consistency it was supposed to have, but this worked out OK.  We added mushrooms and red peppers in place of one of the onions.

As I started making this loaf I realized it didn't look like it would set up too well and when I tasted it pre-baking, it seemed bland.

I made some modifications and since I am making it for Thanksgiving I turned it into stuffing. I doubled the basil and oregano amounts and added 1 tsp of thyme, rosemary and a pinch of nutmeg. I even sprinkled just a bit of garlic powder into it.  I used two cups of my own bread 'crumbs' but cubed and added about 1/2  cup cornmeal, 1/2 cup raisins, and one apple.  I used only 2 cups soy milk and I added powdered veggie bouillon to the the onions and celery to add some flavor.  Just add salt and pepper to your preference. Cooked it 30 min covered and 10min uncovered.

Lovely hearty meal. I made an onion gravy to go with it, and prepared it by frying in oil, not water, using coconut milk, not soya, and adding shiitake mushrooms to the shallot and celery fry-up. I will cook for family and friends with this classic dish time and again. Thank you All-recipes team.

This was delicious. I will keep this recipe for future! I used almond milk instead of soy since that's what I had on hand. I also used almond meal instead of pecan, since I was out of pecans. Husband liked it too! I added 1 T. Of flax meal as well. Next time I will add even more veggies, perhaps shredded carrots.

I substituted the walnuts with almonds and used flaxseed meal. Also added marinara sauce. I was very happy with the results and thoroughly enjoyed it. A very filling meal.

This is an excellent nut loaf. We've never had the opportunity to try one before, so I have nothing to compare it to, however we loved this! I did make a few changes, but not enough to make it a totally new recipe (in my opinion) and the original cook who posted this recipe did suggest that different vegetables and nut variations could be tried. So I pre toasted both the pecans and walnuts, just lightly, in a fry pan, before processing the pecans into meal and chopping the walnuts. I added an 8 oz package of baby bella mushrooms, chopped, to the onion and celery mixture about 1/2 way through cooking. I followed the recipe as is but adding 1 1/2 tsp minced garlic, some paprika and a touch of nutmeg and cayenne to the listed seasonings. I added just enough unsweetened almond milk (after all it is a 'Nut Loaf') to bind and hold everything together. I packed mixture into a round 8 inch cake pan that I had sprayed with vegetable cooking spray. It turned out quite soft in the center after 90 minutes in oven but the texture was not 'off putting' in my opinion. However, this loaf is so much better the second day! It even is scrumptious cold, straight from the frig! My daughter is vegan and she loved this loaf! I will definitely be making this again again! It is great with smashed potatoes and sauted mushrooms! Haven't tried but would be fabulous with a vegan green bean casserole!

Love this recipe! Was my first time cooking a nut roast and my partner and I were very pleased. I did substitute linseed meal for the sunflower seed meal,  added some mushrooms and also some veggie stock powder. I cooked it covered for 1 hour and then 30 minutes uncovered. Will definitely make again !

This came out great. I used a little less almond milk and added about half a cup of cheese to the recipe (I guess I made this into a vegetarian dish--I didn't have any vegan cheese on hand).  I didn't have pecans available so I substituted cashews. I cooked this in the oven for 80 minutes. I will definitely make this again.

Meh, it's a'ight. It's not as tasty as I would have hoped, so next time I make it (and I probably will because I'm always looking for something new and vegan), I'll probably increase the oregano and maybe throw in some other spices.

I tried this and was pleasantly surprised. I was afraid to try after reading some of the comments and I’m not the best cook, but I was proud of the outcome. I love bread and this is definitely one of my favorites. I love that I can experiment with different ingredients. Thank you for this recipe and thank you to the others that offered HELPFUL tips.

Too mushy.  Maybe change it so you add milk a little at a time until u get the right "meatloaf" like consistency.

I couldn't get this recipe to cook into a loaf or bread. After two and a half hours in the oven, it stayed a wet glop.
