Not a bad recipe for a quick weeknight supper or even a super busy weekend night. I used honey garlic sausages and it actually worked well with the added 2 red peppers in this recipe.Also i reversed the steps by mistake but that wasn't a major disaster. I actually boiled my sausages and then fried them and put aside.Then made the gravy with the pan dripping and put that aside.Fried up the onion and peppers and then  added the sausages and sauce and just warmed everything up.Served with boiled nugget potatoes.

As recommended I used ketchup for the tomato sauce and added some sherry.

This turned out to be one of those meals when I was sad to be full.  Terrific!  I didn't have Worcestershire sauce, so I used tamari, added a splash of scotch, four chopped mushrooms, and 1/8 tsp of chili powder for a little kick.  I used gluten-free flour for my hubby.  Oh, and ketchup instead of tomato sauce, since so many reviews said that worked and was easier.  Like others, I found 2 C of water worked well; even with the reduction, I ended up using some additional corn starch and simmering it longer to make the gravy thicker.   We had this over home-grown potatoes, mashed, with broccoli on the side.   We are all feeling full and cozy and ready to hunker down for a comfortable Sunday afternoon.

This was an easy, delicous main dish that tastes like meatballs in a hearty savory sauce.  I will definately make it again!

This was not what I expected.  I was very disappointed. It was ok, but I had to add garlic to spice it up.  The whole family just thought it was ok, but not a keeper. I definately would not make this again.

Very good!  I decreased the water to 2 cups and used ketchup as recommended from others.  That seemed to work perfect.  Thick gravy and not watery.  I added a few spoonfuls of sour cream at the end.  Very good.  Will make again

I had to substitute a few ingredients to avoid going to the store, but I think I still got the spirit of this recipe!  We had mild Italian chicken sausage, so I used that.  It was pre-cooked, so I skipped boiling it first.  I fried the onion with a pinch of salt, a grind or two of pepper, and a bit of sugar.  I let it carmelize, deglazing it with water, used chicken stock instead of water and bouillon, And I had to use diced tomato, not tomato sauce.  I didn't add any salt except what I put in the onion.  The flavor was good, but it was more like broth than gravy.  Next time I'll add less water/broth.

The gravy gets 4 stars - savory, delicious and quick and easy to make. My problem was with the sausages I used - they were gristly and not very flavorsome. Shame. I omitted the salt because I knew the beef bouillon granules would be salty enough. Also, I used some tomato ketchup because I didn't want to open an entire can of sauce for just for 2 tbsp. I will try this again with different sausage. Thanks, Marianne!

My husband loved this recipe.  I put it over wild rice, but I think I will try the biscuits next time.
The one thing that I did add to this was a splash of Sherry and it was a huge hit. The Sherry goes so well with the onions and sausage...it really compliments the flavors.

This recipe was okay to me. I wished that I'd doubled the gravy ingredients. I served mine over mashed potatoes yet the combination made the whole mixture too salty for my family. Will be again but will find ways to cut corners on the salt.

Hubby doesn't usually like sausage let alone ones that are peeled and chopped up.  I am pleased to say that he actually liked this recipe.  I used ketchup so the next time I will try it will tomato sauce.

Easy, tasty 'comfort food'! Like others, used broth - 2cups, v.s. water. Also Italian sausage & left on the casing(pers. choice). Optional: Stir in a little of your favorite frozen veggies. Also great as leftover. Just make a little more.
This from a 'novice, retired guy cook'!

Yum! Perfect easy supper. I had to substiture a couple of cans of chicken broth for the water and beef oxo cubes but it was still a great meal.

I substituted the pork sausages with Beef ones, used liquid beef stock instead of the water and cubes, and added frozen corn kernels at the end, and my 4yo daughter is STILL saying yum now! Definitely a hit with the kids, fussy husband is sure to enjoy it!

very simple to put together, with a very nice flavor.  quite different from what I normally cook.  I used this as a gravy for Toads-in-the-Hole I on this site.

Easy recipe and very good.  I replaced the regular sausage with lower in fat turkey sausage.  This recipe is perfect for it because it covers the usually unusual taste of turkey sausage.  Family loved it and there was plenty of left overs, perfect for freezing portions and reheating later!
