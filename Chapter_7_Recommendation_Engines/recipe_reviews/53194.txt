This is a recipe that my Oma made also. I tried it once and they did tend to fall apart, from the look of the dumplings I figured out the grate was too large. So I ajusted to the finest grate the second time and squeezed the grated potato's as dry as I could get them. I remembered my Oma wringing the grated potato's. First time was good, second try was excellent. I so think the grate needs to be super fine. Thank you.

This is nearly identical to our old family favorite. We always put in a bit of egg to hold it together. The size of the grate shouldn't matter, but you have to get ALL the water out and add flour until it won't hold any more.

We usually boil a ham shank for an hour or two, then drop the dumplings in with it. The next morning, we slice up the leftover ham and potatoes and fry them in butter. Mmmmm. 

The most interesting part to me was my Grandma telling me how when they lived on a farm, this was what they lived on at the tail end of winter. Only the toughest, saltiest cuts of pork were left, and some half-rotten potatoes, but it was enough to stretch just a little store bought flour into a family meal.

This is the recipe my mom and her mom always used. It's tradition in our family to fry the dumpling with cut up wieners and saurkraut. (so yummy)After my mom passed away, I didn't have the exact measurements, my grandma just told me, "some potatoes, some flour", so I was happy to come across this recipe. It's exactly the way my mom made them. Thanks!!!!

This is the potato dumpling that I grew up eating.  It seemed to me that my family was the only Czech/German family that used this recipe.  My gr grandfather said that this dumpling killed the tailor, meaning that someone who sits to work all day cannot eat like this.  He, being a blacksmith could.  One of my cousins called these "Sinkers", because they sink in your stomach.  So many people that I have talked to about eating potato dumplings say that they would have contests in their families when they were young to see who could eat the most.  They are the most asked for dinner for birthdays in my family.

This is the definitive, quintessential potato dumpling recipe I've been trying to find for YEARS!  All other recipes I've found in cookbooks involve COOKED potatoes, and the one thing I remembered about the dumplings Oma made were that they involved RAW potatoes.  THANK YOU, MAUREEN!

That's he secret....super fine grate and wring as dry as possible...I put the mix into cheesecloth and wrung dry that way.....these dumplings are also excellent layered in a casserole with cubed Velveta cheese and baked in a medium oven til the cheese is melted...I remember Mom cooking them that way

This is the long lost recipe my gram used for many years, except she always added an egg.  Her family moved from Hungary to Germany, then to the United States.  We never really had a name for the dish she prepared, but she would make these potato dumplings, then fry them with cottage cheese.  It never sounded (or looked) very appetizing, but it was oh so good tasting!  Extremely fattening, and off my diet plan, this is a birthday/special occasion treat.  Thanks for the memories!

I grated then pulverized the little taters in the food processor. Then I squeezed out as much water as I could before adding instant-blending flour to form somewhat of a dough. This is how our Babi prepared her dish called 'Haluski'. We'd fry up some bacon and mushrooms and sprinkle it all over the dumplings, letting some grated mozzarella cheese melt overtop. Delish!

Maybe my potatoes were bigger, or something, but these looked great going into the water. 
However fell apart and were VERY soft coming out. More flour? add an egg? Hubby and kids liked them
, but they need more spice like parsley. Not unedible, but need some work. I'll try them again.

Good, I strongly suggest using red potatoes. Red potatoes have more favor and less water.

Delicious! Dried parsley flakes and garlic powder amp up the flavor. I made a test batch before serving to my husband's family. The finished dumplings lacked visual appeal, so after boiling & draining, I pan-sauteed them in butter which made a nice, crispy coating. The second time I made them, I sauteed them in hot bacon grease (and drained on power towels) which added to the flavor, but sauteeing in butter made a nicer, crispier coating. They were especially yummy accompanied by an off-the-cuff whiskey-cream sauce that was also served atop grilled pork chops. Not a recipe for those watching their waistlines, but definitely one we'll be making for future family gatherings especially with the whiskey-cream sauce which I should re-create using actual measurements and post on this site later. The whole family loved these darling little delights! Thank you for this new spin on potatoes.

P.S. A favorite restaurant serves potato dumplings sauteed with artichoke hearts and served in Chardonnay cream sauce. These, as I prepared them, tasted just as good according to hubby :-)

After several years of eating at "Germany" at EPCOT, I deceided to make these!  I used too large grater, but still worked well.  I fried some onion in lots of butter and served that mixed w/ the dumplings.  GOOD!  I did use more salt.  Wonder if garlic powder would taste good?

These were delicious! Easy to make but messy, at least for me. I was worried my husband wouldn't like them, but he said that it was definitley a keeper!! I will make these again! I grated some onion and garlc in with the potatoes and added an egg to help it all stick together.  After they were done boiling I cooked in the in a skillet with butter garlic salt and pepper. So yummy!

I just happened to have a hankering for these and made them over the weekend.  Haven't had them in probably 15 or 20 years.  My grandmother's recipe calls for 5 medium to large potatoes, small onion, flour, egg, 5 slices of dried bread.  I processed the potatoes (shredded) and broke up the bread into small pieces.  Used flour accordingly (maybe 1/2 cup) to keep the mixture together.  Made 5 oval shaped balls (resembling russet potatoes) and boiled them for approximately 15-20 miutes.    I noticed that if I let them sit a bit or even cool in the fridge that they firmed up nicely.  I sliced them and fried them in a small amount of butter. Served them with a pork roast and poured gravy over them.  Unbelievably delicious!!!!! Wonderful memories!

Yummy, just like my grandma made.  She would strain the grated potatoes and at the bottom of the liquid is a layer of starch that you can put back into the potatoes to make them hold together better.  She would then fry the dumplings in bacon, onions and lots of marjoram.  The best ever.

These are just like my dad use to make!  Potatoes, flour & salt!  He taught me to peel the potatoes and cut them into small cubes, put them in a blender with just enough water to puree the potates.  After they are pureed, run them through a mesh collander, put them in a bowl and add other ingredients.  This is a lot different than grating them but since I don't cook much, and don't even think I have a grater, this works out perfect for me!  When I make the dumplings, I flatten them and add a few pieces of diced ham, then roll the dumpling back up.  Served with melted butter.  They look gray but taste great!!  Make extra so you can slice & fry them on the second day!!

This is the closest recipe to mine I have ever found. We always start early in the morning. Put a couple huge pots to boil w/ salt pork and onions and water. Let it simmer for a couple of hours. Add stew meat. Let simmer. Add carrots. Simmer. While this is happening we grate our potatoes (raw of course). Usually at least a 5# bag. Then we mix with flour and just a little bit of baking powder. I like to make small balls my mom likes them big. (Sorry no measurements) We bring the pots to boil. This is the best meal. Got me hungry for these again.

This is very similar to my grandmother's recipe, but we saute shredded cabbage and finely chopped onions in butter, and serve it over the dumplings.  An Eastern European recipe.

This recipe popped up by searching a dish my friends Ma used to make called ruskaballs.The potatos were ground in a meat grinder and cream of tartar was involved and the taters werent drained.Salt pork or bacon was stuck in the middle of the balls and then boiled.They were cabbage roll size and really dense.They were of Norwegian descent.Tried this one with added egg and the bacon and bigger they were good.If anybody knows about the ruskaball name Ive always been curious!

This has been a tradition in our family for years. I was taught how to make them and do not use a recipe. I never squeeze or drain the excess water. Just add salt and water until it is a dough like consistency. We used cubed ham, formed the dough around it and sealed them up prior to boiling. We would cut them up, slather with butter and serve sauerkraut on the side. We love them!!

Growing up as a Norwegian on a North Dakota farm, this was served in our family a lot! The only addition was to grate a small onion into the potatoes before adding the flour. I was told that the Swedish dumplings are from cooked potatoes and the Norwegians made them from raw. I don't know the actual country of origin for this recipe but it sure brings back memories from my childhood. Sliced and fried in butter for the next days breakfast is unbeatable.

I wanted these dumplings so bad yesterday.  I made them out of memory, but they turned out too soft.  My mother used to make these with cabbage instead of the usual noodles which I preferred.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe.  I will now make them again.

My mom used to make these using grated potatoes, onion, egg, dried bread cubed, parsley, salt and pepper and flour.  I have tried several times to duplicate, but altho the taste was there, they fell apart in the boiling water.   Why??  If anyone has an answer I would appreciate it.

This recipe is very similar to my Father-inlaw's recipe. He would grate the potato on the finest grater (I use a food processor). He also added an egg to hold it together. He would add just enough flour to keep it from running, salt & pepper, and than he would scoop it with a knife into boiling water. He would only boil them for a couple of minutes, and then drain. We usually had these fried with sauerkraut, but it is also good fried in butter or bacon fat & onions.

Very close to how my mom used to make them.  Soooo good!
I was raised on these, so they are my favorite.  I love to cut up the left overs into thin slices and heat them up in some butter and mix them with scrambled eggs for an awesome breakfast.
Thanks for sharing.  Only thing I'll add is play it by ear on the measurements, reserve the water from the grated potatoes in case you put too much flour in.   Pretty fool proof though!

My Mother made these passed down from generations. After making them, we'd pan sear pork ribs, then put the ribs, saurkraut, and dumplings in a slow cooker and simmer for a few hours. Served with a load of butter.

I first had dumplings similar to these at my (Norwegian) mother-in-law's house when my now husband and I were dating.  She always made them by simmering them in ham broth she made by simmering a ham bone or ham hock.  Her biggest instruction was to keep stirring in flour until you couldn't add any more.  She never measured anything.

If I make them only for my husband and myself I don't peel the potatoes - I just wash them well and put them through the meat grinder.  I also add onion (also through the meat grinder) and cooked sausage.  We feel that even though the sausage and onion aren't traditional, they  add quite a lot to the taste - especially if you don't cook them in ham broth.

My grandmother, and me always use raw grated potato. Only difference is we always let the raw grated potato sit for 20 or 30 minutes then ring them out with cheesecloth add an egg flour and salt. The egg helps bind them so they don't fall apart when you boil them. These are very good with a nice pork roast with caraway seeds and gravy.

This is how my husbands mom always made it and she always added sour kraut and wieners.  Seems like it's always better the next day.

Finally someone on here with a proper recipe!! However, we use ham broth to boil in. It gives AWESOME flavor!!! Also, if you happen to have a meat grinder try grating the potatoes with the medium grinding plate. It works like a dream!

My first attempt was a fail, but I think they would be great if I do a couple of things differently. Next time, I will actually remove the grated potatoes and pat them dry before adding the flour. I'll definitely be using more flour than the recipe calls for, and I will drop the dumplings into hard-boiling water to form and then finish by browning in a pan.

I have been wanting these for years. But never had a recipe. My wife never heard of them. I loved these when I was a child.But if I wanted them my mom made me grate the potatoes. It was worth it. I got the left overs to fry in butter.

Oh wow! This is exactly how my family makes dumplings.  We serve them every New Years day with braised red cabbage, sauerkraut,  caraway pork roast and gravy.   Other recipes I've seen always call for eggs or mashed potatoes.  They don't know what they are missing with these things :-)

Sounds a lot like a family recipe I've tried to replicate.  Saw my elders do it once.  They grated potatoes added wheat flour and rye and put a cube of salt pork in the middle.  They added the flour until the ball wouldn't seep through their fingers and then put in a broth they made with salted lambs breast. My husband jokes it looks like wallpaper paste which it does.  We called this Kumpa.  Never saw this any recipes. It is Norwegian based. Any body know the full recipe?

This recipe has been in my family for years as well.  We would fry bacon until it was very crisp and could be crumbled for adding tot he cooked demplings along with shredded cheddar cheese.  We would use some of the hot bacon grease to mix the cheese and bacon bits in the dumplings.  Very fattening but FABULOUS!!    Our dough recipe called for an egg and to get the dumplings right you need to get the right texture to the dough before boiling.  Its also important to drain the water off the grated potatoes.  We would use the same size of grating that we used for potatoe pancakes.
