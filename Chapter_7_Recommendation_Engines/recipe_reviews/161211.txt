This is the type of meal you prepare if you invite someone over and want to impress them... And it's easy to make! The aroma will have your guests' mouths watering from the moment they step foot through the door. I made it for my mother, and it is now her new favorite meal. I added carrots, onions, and a little extra rosemary.

Very good ! I browned everything early in the day and chilled until dinner time. Popped it in the over for about 25 minutes and it was delicious.  I used  polish sausage, 6 boneless chicken breasts sprinkled with garlic powder and added two vidalia onions the recipe, no vinegar, and added chopped chives for garnish and a little color.

I enjoyed this dish.  Very tasty.  The chicken was excellent!  It did, however, turn out just a little too salty and greasy.  That's an easy fix next time, though :)  Good recipe!

This recipe actually combines 2 recipes that my Italian mother made regularly: rosemary chicken with roasted potatoes and sausage and peppers ... it seems to work!  I never EVER cook sausages in oil. I pierce them with a fork (you must pierce or, like a baked potato, they will explode!), add a bit of water to the pan with the sausages then cover and cook for about 5 min. or so. (You do this so the insides get a head start on cooking and you don't have to over-fry them.) Then I drain the water and continue to cook (fry) uncovered until they are browned and well cooked. This should solve the problem of too 'greasy'.   As we are spice lovers we did indeed add garlic, onions that we caramelized and sweet peppers.

I served this to a group of six, and I only had some potatoes left over.  I used all chicken legs.  The browning process is time consuming, but recipe times were spot on.  I placed the potatoes in the bottom of my baking dish, then topped with the chicken and the sausage.  I stirred the potatoes and turned the chicken and sausage twice during the baking process.  I drizzled with real red wine, instead of red wine vinegar.  I think you can probably leave off the drizzle of oil, as everything is pre-cooked in oil, and mine came out too greasy.  I had to sop up some of the grease with a paper towel before serving.  Thanks for the recipe!

This meal is hearty and delicious.  It doesn't get any easier or tastier.  I used thighs and beer brats and I added sweet onions and garlic.  I threw this meal meal together pretty quickly and it appeared and tasted as I would have been preparing for it all day !  I love this recipe, definite keeper.

Mmmm... this was a really easy, delicious, and elegant dinner to make. It made our entire house smell wonderful - my friends couldn't wait to dig in! I added a bit of ground pepper to the chicken when browning it, with the salt, as well as some sliced onions to the sausage. I also threw in some whole garlic cloves, about six, to bake with the whole thing. The result was an occasional savoury bite of roasted garlic with the potatoes, which was really nice with the rosemary. Great recipe - I'll make it again!

Wonderful and a lot of fun to pour a glass of wine and cook. Smells great. Enough things to do to make you feel like you are cooking but little enough to not make you tired of cooking. And the end result was wonderful. I did add some minced garlic and onions when I browned the potatoes. Thanks OP!

Great dinner!  My boyfriend did add a small sliced onion to the brats when cooking.  It carmelized nicely.  This will be a staple in our house.

I thought this was a great idea.  I was bored with the idea of grilling or frying brats and someone pointed this recipe out to me.  I must admit, I skipped the part where you first fry the meats and taters on the stove.  I put the meat and potatoes in a 9x13 casserole and slathered all ingredients with the olive oil and spices and put the dish in the oven for 1 hour @ 375 degrees.  I turned the meat and taters once every 15 minutes to get a really nice roasting.  Worked perfect.  Thank you for a great recipe!!!

Absolutely awesome. Deserving of company in its presentation and flavor. As another has written, prepare everything in advance for a clean kitchen when company arrives, and then just pop into the oven and enjoy a glass of wine (and as one reviewer wrote: enjoy a glass while cooking -- this is a fun dish to prepare if you love to cook).  I added onion and carrot as per other reviews and I tossed rosemary into every browning process (yep, I'm a rosemary freak). No need to add ANY additonal olive oil beyond the first -- everything browns in succession from the remaining wonderfully blended flavors. If I found a restaurant that served this, I would be there every week -- it's that good!! And in my modest opinion, there is absolutely no substitute for fresh rosemary. Bliss I tell you, pure bliss.

This is a fabulous meal. I use Italian sausage and add red peppers, onion and mushrooms. The red peppers don't give me heart burn. I cook the sausage and chicken in a bit of canola oil and garlic. I don't use any wine because I never have it on hand. My family loves this recipe and it's one of our keepers. Thanks

I am giving this 4 stars since I made changes to the recipe - not by choice.  My lovely black lab decided the rosemary was for him so I used oregano as a back up. Based on others reviews regarding the amount of grease I made the following changes to the steps: I browned kielbasa (I didn't have bratwurst and the kielbasa actually added a nice flavor) without any oil. I then browned strips of boneless  chicken breast with fresh minced garlic and oregano in the remaining oil in the pan from the kielbasa. I added 1 TBS of olive oil for the potatoes. I added freshly chopped onions and more oregano to the potatoes. I placed these 3 ingredients on separate plates with paper towels to absorb any excess grease. This worked perfectly to reduce the greasiness others mentioned.  The chicken was dry so next time I make this recipe, if I use strips of boneless chicken breasts, I will place them in the baking dish raw or leave them in larger pieces. I will also closely guard the rosemary from the dog!

Very Good!  I used legs with thighs attached.  I used only about 2 TBS of canola oil for the whole recipe whcih was plenty.  Also, I used a generous amount of dried rosemary instead of the fresh.  As other reviewers did, I added whole fresh mushrooms but did Not add vinegar.  My family liked this, even my "wanna be a chef" son was impressed.

Very crispy and delicious. Watch the amount of oil you use (I used less than the recipe asked for) to keep it healthy. Instead of bratwurst links, I used sliced hot dogs. Goes well with zucchini risotto.

This is my recipe and I apologize to everyone for the amount of oil listed here!  I canNOT believe I ever used that much oil, but eh, it was so long ago, who knows?  I do know that now I don't use that much.  Just a little olive oil for the potatoes, and I spray the pans for the chicken and sausage.  And remember that I can't use onion or garlic, but if you want to, I'm sure it will only add to the dish!

Fabulous for my taste with a few changes...cut the oil in halfl, browned chicken and potatoes at high heat to get real crispy without overcooking.  After putting everything together in the roasting dish I poured the excess fat out of the pan and then de-glazed with white wine and white wine vinegar and poured that over the mixture before putting in oven.  I also cut back on the rosemary...1 TB was plenty.   This is one of those great basic dishes that you can have fun customizing (next time I am adding some vinegar peppers).

As a vegetarian option, I replaced the sausage with vegetarian sausage and the chicken with quorn pieces, and it worked fine. Had a lovely flavour.

only change I made on this recipe was to use red wine instead of the vinegar.  I am not fond on the flavor of any type of vinegars so I try to use the wine itself all the time.

Great recipe! I've made it with russet, red, and sweet potatoes. Best results came from dialing back the oil a bit, using sweet potatoes and subbing thyme for rosemary, as well as adding a bit of oregano and parsley. A crowd-pleaser, through and through.

I LOVE THIS - I made it without the sausage and carrots, just because I didn't have any at the time and used a whole chicken instead, covered it for part of the time in the oven and uncovered it towards the end, as well as adding some chicken broth to the bottom of the pan, YUM! it fell off the bone and the potatoes I added, (because of lack of sausage and carrots) were amazing. TRY IT!

Really tasty, but too greasy.  I would skip the oil altogether and just spray some cooking spray on a non-stick pan before cooking the sausage.  That should be all you need.

I've been making this one for years after seeing it on a popular Italian cooking show. Brown Italian sausage first...remove then brown chicken..then use red potatoes sliced and brown those. Place all in large casserole and top with some sliced fresh garlic and your seasonings. I use oregano only because I'm not a huge fan of rosemary. Cook on 350 for about 30 minutes, and then add apple cider vinegar and continue to cook for at least a hour & 15 min. until nice and brown, turning chicken at least twice. My husband loves this with spinach on the side..Yummy!

This was fantastic....  I used Italian sausage, and added zuchini and yellow squash cut into 1/4 inch slices, Browned the veggies in the oil and cooked with the rest!   I think would be great with quartered onions too.  A definite keeper!!

I made this tonight and it came out great! The only thing I would do  different in the future is to use MUCH less oil. I only used half the oil tonight, but it still was a bit on the greasy side, hence my 4 star rating. Next time I will add some garlic and onion and saute it with the brats until they are carmelized. With some tweaking this would be a much better recipe.

Very tasty!  I made as directed but I did think it was a bit greasy.  I will make again and maybe cut the olive oil in half and perhaps add some green peeper and onions.  The rosemary gave it an excellent flavor.  Overall a good recipe that can be tweeted to your liking.

I usually follow the exact recipe the first time but this time I added fresh mushrooms, an onion and some left over Italian sausage, delicious! Will definitely make again. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was excellent and the picky eaters in my house had seconds. You need to like rosemary (i LOVE it!) and we threw in a few carrots like the picture shows (but its not in the recipe) and it added another element of flavor that was fabulous.  I just reheated the leftovers at work and 5 people have asked me what I am eating because it smells so good!  I will make this again.

Delicious!! I used Beef Smoked Sausage and Chicken Breast Chunks, along with Onions and Garlic. My whole family loved it, even the 8 & 14 yr. old!! My daughter suggested I try adding sliced bell pepper next time, I think I'll give it a shot. A real hit, will definitely use this recipe again.

This was delicious.. I'm a newish cook and i never had a chicken come out as cripy or as tasty as this did.. Either the high temperature or the pre-frying it responsible for that.. Regardless i will be cooking it like this from now on! Thanks

Kinda bland.  Won't make again.  Try the "Crispy Rosemary chicken and fries" recipe instead.  That is excellent and a staple in my lineup

This recipe produced a dish that was "white"...no color to it, though I see the photo shows something orange? Maybe carrots?  It was more like oven roasted potatoes with some chicken and sausage.  Very disappointing.

I thought that this recipe was great as a whole. I used chicken legs for the chicken parts. My only problem with this recipe, and maybe it was my own fault as I used dry rosemary, there was just too much of it. I WILL make this recipe again and just not add all of the rosemary or use fresh and finely chop it. Yumy flavor! My husband said he really liked the sauteed/ fried brats which he normally doesn't. Thank you!

Delicious!  I used the Schneider's Grill 'Ems (precooked sausages) because I love the taste of them.  I also completely forgot to add the red wine vinegar and it was still delicious.  I'm going to make it today and will add the vinegar.  So simple and so good.

This was very tasty, although pretty greasy. It definitely doesn't need 1/4 cup of oil, next time I'll just use non-stick spray so the brats don't stick to the pan. I drained the chicken and potatos on a paper towel after pay frying, and there was still ample grease in the dish after baking (presumably from the bratwurst). Everyone really liked it though!

This is a great recipe, but has way too much fat.  This can easily be reduced by using cooking spray in a non stick frying pan and cutting out the oil all together.  Also, I used a turkey sausage with flavors such as italian, peppers, or cheese.  I used boneless skinless turkey thighs and cut out as much fat as I could.  Great dish after the fat reduction.

Added whole button mushrooms because I had them. Used Yukon gold potatoes as it was all I had. It was good, although there was a lot of excess oil. I may cut down on that if I make again.   It was easy enough, though, hence the 4 stars. Flavor alone, I would give a 3, it is pretty lightly seasoned for me.

This was a very tasty and quick meal to prepare! I think it's important to saute the sausage, chicken, and potatoes separately so that you can control the amount of fat and liquid that goes into the dish.   I did modify the recipe a bit.  Whenever I use olive oil in an oven dish, I will always add onions and crushed garlic for added flavoring.  It came out just as I expected it to.  I also used a seasoned garlic salt which only enhanced the flavors. Otherwise I followed the recipe just as written.  My guests are always impressed with my dishes; and it only takes a little tweaking here and there to call it your own!

The flavors are really good in this recipe. I added chopped garlic and it complemented the other flavors nicely. The only thing I would change for next time is use less oil. It was a little on the swimming side. :)

4.5 Stars: I prepped earlier in the day, then baked for dinner. The potatoes had browned even though the dish was covered, so in the future I would not add them until right before baking.  I think I baked it too long, too, because the chicken was a bit dry. I used no oil during frying. I browned the sliced brats first, then added a little water to the browned bits in the pan for the chicken and potatoes.  This gave the chicken a delicious flavor.  Chicken broth or wine would have worked well for this as well.  It's a great Octoberfest recipe. My husband thinks saurkraut would have been a great side.

This recipe is fabulous! The only problem I did, which has nothing to do with the recipe, is that I couldn't find fresh Rosemary, so I used the dried stuff. It was like little pieces of wood in there! Everything else was wonderful, though! I will be making this again, and I will definitely be sure to search for fresh Rosemary.

This was okay but a lot of work for just okay. I used italian sausage and had to use dried rosemary, maybe that was the reason it was jsut okay for us. MY husband loved the potatoes. I will try it again and use real rosemary and a different sausage

I just made this recipe yesterday... turned out great.  My only complaint was that it was a tad bit too greasy.

We thought this was very good.Followed the directions for browning. The only thing different I really did was throw a bag of baby carrots in, and had about a cup of left over beef gravy, I pored that on top. I baked for an hour, maybe a little more. Well make this again. Thanks.

I made this because my wife loves rosemary roasted potatoes, but i was pretty skeptical.  The flavor is good, but it's somewhere between a side dish, main dish, and casserole.  The only change i included was  the addition of 6 cloves of raw garlic before placing in the oven.  This was a big plus - next time i'll add 8-10 cloves.

Fried foods are not something which is good for people with digestive problems. It's all fried and dried: pieces of chicken, sausage and potato rattling around on a plate. The rosemary adds little flavor.  To me it does not come together as an entre. No imagination in this recipe.

This was really good! I couldn't find fresh rosemary so I used dried, added one whole onion some sliced garlic, red potatoes, beer brats and boneless skinless chicken. I think next time I'm going to toss everything in a little maple syrup part way through the cooking process just for a different kick, but this was great as is. It was a very satisfying meal served with sliced fresh tomatoes and crusty bread. Thanks for sharing a new way to incorporate bratwurst (one of my absolute favorite foods EVER) into my menu! :)

This was easy and had a good flavor.  I only browned the chicken breasts, not the potatoes and sausage.  Next time I make it I will marinate the chicken (it was a tad dry) and add some garlic.  I used less oil and the dish turned out fine.

This hit a home run with my family.  Cook for parents everynight, always looking for a new twist on chicken.  Used sweet potatoes instead of white. Used red wine in place of vinegar.  Added garlic powder with the rosemary also added some thyme. Thank you for this great meal .

I did not care for this at all.  I don't sausage, chicken, and potatoes compliment each other when prepared this way.  Will never make again.

This recipe is SIMPLY DELISH!!  In an effort to cut fat for me and salt for my boyfriend, I made this a second time with alterations.  This time I used 2-3 tablespoons of lemon juice(to suit your own taste) instead of salt and equal amount of canola oil instead of olive oil.  This second way reminded me of greek chicken and potatoes without the oregano.  Thank you for it!!!!

For flavor this gets a 5, but the dish was very heavy and greasy....if I make this again I will try to find away to cut out some of the grease.

One of my family's favorites!  I simply brown the cut up sausage and put in the casserole dish, then the cut up chicken in olive oil, dried rosemary and dried chopped garlic in olive oil, then add to the baking dish.  Do the same with the cut up potatoes.  Bake for 30 to 40 minutes.

turned out wonderful! I usually cut oil and sugar in recipes. I did the same with this one and it was greasy enough. I didn't add any oil. I browned the sausages, with the oil they released, i could brown the chickens and the potatoes. And there was no need to add additional olive oil. Oh I used chicken thighs though. As big pieces. Chicken breasts might require more oil. Anyway, it was perfect!

I used less oil and papertowl blotted some up, so I this may be why my chicken came out a bit drier than expcted.  But they taste of the potatoes mixed with the sausage was GREAT!  I will probably do the sausage and potatoes again with maybe steak or a different chicken recipe.

Can't say anything bad about this one.  "Clean-up" was super easy as there was nothing left but empty dishes!  I give this one 5 stars hands down!  Not something you can just walk away from though...it's a real hands on recipe but well worth it!

This was just ok for me. I used Chorizo instead of the brawurst.  The star of this dish were the potatoes.  I added some sauteed onions when I brown the chicken too.  It needed something like tomato sauce or even tomato paste would have added a nice flavor.

This was delicious! I didn't use the chicken I just used potatoes and sausage.  I added in some onions fried them with the potatoes and the sausage and threw some in the dish to bake came out with a great flavor. I also threw some shredded cheese over top of it and let it melt that gave it a good touch.  I will definitely make this again!

The chicken should probably be cut into strips or a bit smaller so as to increase the surface area to acquire more seasoning.  Otherwise a tasty, easy and delicious meal.

3 stars as-written but 4 stars for idea and potential. As other reviewers have stated there is way too much olive oil on the recipe. Idk how much I used (I just drizzle as I go I never measure oil) but 1/4 cup + 2 TBSP would be a grease bomb for sure. I used just enough for browning really.  Also you’ll need more salt and seasonings. Probably at least 1.5 tsp. I seared the thighs, then the brats whole (to retain their juices) and put both into a baking dish, slicing the brats in half as I went. In the same pan I sweated some mushrooms with salt and some of the rosemary. I didn’t see the point of browning the potatoes so I just chopped them into big chunks and tossed them with a little olive oil, salt and pepper, garlic and some of the rosemary then put those in with the meat, followed by the mushrooms and a sprinkle of baby carrots.  Next time I will use more rosemary and more salt and more garlic. I also forgot the vinegar but a little acid would have stepped it up a notch for sure - next time I’ll use it or squeeze a lemon over the whole thing. 1/2 was too much cooking time as well - chicken was a bit dry.  Lastly, this recipe creates a beautiful brown crust in the bottom of the baking dish and delicious drippings - remove the items from the dish and toss in some wine or stock over heat to deglaze for s nice pan sauce...don’t waste that stuff!! All in all I love this recipe bc I can wear it off and assemble the night before then pop it in the oven when I get home from work!

Excellent. Made with elk sausage and grouse. Next time I would put the grouse in a little later because it takes less time to cook.

I made this for my folks, following the instructions. The potatoes didn't get done enough, but it was good.  I think the serving sizes are off, though.   This recipe said it served six, but i fed three people and still have enough for 6 or 8 more.   Next time, i'll add carrots or red peppers or something colorful. It was a very white dish.

Really enjoyed this!  But made some liberal changes, based on other reviews.  Used boneless skinless breasts and thighs, smoked sausage (bc I already had some), added onion and red bell pepper and 2 cloves garlic to the potatoes during the browning process.  I didn't use the red wine vinegar.  I cooked it all for about 28 mins, turning the chicken 1/2 way through.  The thighs were great!  The breasts were a bit dry.  Made 2-9x13 pans, separating the breasts and thighs and splitting the rest of the ingredients between the 2.  Will pull the breasts out sooner next time.  Yum!

Like others, I significantly cut the oil.  Doubled the recipe and added peppers and onions (and took out the red wine vinegar) in one. The other I used balsamic vinegar instead because that's what I had.  It was FANTASTIC!  I cut the boneless skinless chicken breasts into bite sized pieces.  Wouldn't change a thing!

I went to make this recipe only to discover I forgot to buy the rosemary. So I made it without and it was still tasty. I added a mix of sweet potatoes and reds. I will make this again, next time with the rosemary.

Juice isn't really worth the squeeze compared to other one sheet dinners.  Kind of bland, even when doctored with onions and garlic.  I guess you could change the spices and the like, but the browning of everything separately kind of defeats the purpose.

This was good for my family as some people don't care for sausage so they can just eat the chicken and potatoes.  Fortunately, I prefer the sausage.  Next time I will add some kind of vegetable, maybe zucchini. I love recipes that I can use the rosemary growing in my garden.

I made this for my husband and 5 year old both of them loved it. I am giving this recipe four stars instead of five b/c I reduced the amount oil (Thanks everyone for the warnings) and added veggies and herbs  like broccoli, garlic, basil onions etc...  No need to spray the baking pan. Your food will have plenty of oil from the browning of meat and potatoes. I used rice wine and  added the broccoli  5 minutes before removing the chicken from oven bc we like our broccoli still crunchy. This was a very good starter recipes but you definitely need to have some fun and follow your own path.

Made it with olive oil (about half of what the recipe called for,) boneless chicken thighs, sweet sausage, gold petit potatoes, sea salt, fresh rosemary.
Made it 5 hours ahead of time, putting it in the frig until tonight. Planning to cook it in oven for 25-30 minutes.  Smells incredible!  Serving it with roasted broccoli.  Can't wait to eat it!

This recipe is excellent. Can be a little bland. I browned my bratwurst in 2 tablespoons butter instead of olive oil. Then browned the chicken in the butter, with 1/2 tsp of garlic, 1/4 tsp onion powder, and lightly sprinkled with salt and pepper. Added a little more butter (1 tablespoon) to brown the potatoes and again when I combined everything in the baking dish. Only used 1 1/2 tablespoons of the chopped rosemary leaves. Turned out great. Super delicious. Thanks for sharing with us.
