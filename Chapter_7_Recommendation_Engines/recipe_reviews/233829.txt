Fantastic flavorful soup.  I wasn't sure about a hot cucumber soup but it was great. The only thing I changed was that I used a full pack of sausage and omitted the vegetarian patties.

Worth the time to make it. Next time I will make a double batch. Everybody enjoyed it that tried it. Even better with Parmesan cheese but I am a mouse.
