My grandson liked, but my son and I did not. Check to add more water, ours was very thick.

It really does taste like a PBnJ in a glass. I used plain yogurt instead of vanilla. Using 1/2 cup of water did result in a very thick smoothie. I drank it with a straw with some resistance. I'll probably add a bit more water next time. Thank you for sharing the recipe.
