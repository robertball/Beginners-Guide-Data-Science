As the first reviewer of this recipe I had an advantage.  Except for the cinnamon and vanilla, which submitter lists as optional anyway, this is the same recipe as the wildly popular and 5-star “Fluffy Pancakes,” also from this site, with well over 5,000 reviews.  So I already knew these were going to be delicious!  I used buttermilk rather than the soured milk (same difference essentially) and, just as I learned and have been doing since I was a little girl, mixed the batter till blended but with some small lumps still remaining.  I did not add the optional vanilla or cinnamon.   Now here’s Hubs’ eloquent review of the day. “They’re good,” he muttered with a mouthful of pancake and pure maple syrup. How helpful is THAT? With my usual frustration I asked him HOW good.  “Delicious good,” he responded.  I don’t think it could be stated any better!  We haven’t had pancakes in several years and to be reintroduced to them this morning using this recipe was our win.  They are indeed fluffy and light, with just the right amount of lift.  The recipe is dead on with both the levels of salt and sugar resulting in perfectly enhanced flavor with no baking powder aftertaste.  Simply excellent, and just as is, without the additions of cinnamon or vanilla.  No doubt that would be good too, but I say if you’re only going to have pancakes once every blue moon, why mess with the perfect, classic rendition.

I have made this without the  cinnamon and vanilla numerous times and the pancakes are wonderful!  The pancakes are fluffy, moist, and have a wonderful texture.

I have a few warnings to those who are unfamiliar with this recipe:
1. do NOT add the vanilla. In my experience this negates the effect of souring the milk and the pancakes end up  flat.
2. DO mix dry ingredients and wet ingredients separately and then just barely combine immediately before cooking. This is not the batter to make in advance or let sit a while.
3. Do not over mix. Any mixing beyond combining takes fluffiness away from the pancakes.
4. Cook them low and slow. These will burn before cooking through if you don't use low, even heat to cook them. a cast-iron skillet works great.
5. Make a big batch once you have confidence. These will be popular. My family of three adult eaters and two children quadruples the recipe and ends up with just a couple single-serving leftovers for the freezer. But then, we really like pancakes.

For a little extra moistness, add 1/4 cup cottage cheese for each serving. This is a real winner with my whole family, including a couple kids who would never knowingly go near cottage cheese.

Enjoy!

Delicious pancakes - nice and fluffy.  My critiques are: There is too much vinegar in the recipe, and slightly too much salt.  I did try the recipe with the amounts of vanilla and cinnamon recommended & they were really good.  I added more milk because the hubs and I wanted a thinner pancake.  I think next time I'll try these plain, without the cinnamon and vanilla (and my adjustments above). Thank you for the recipe!

This is definitely a keeper!  My kids loved how big and fluffy they came out.  I did omit the cinnamon and vanilla.  I cut my white flour to 3/4 and put a 1/4  whole wheat flour, added 2-3 tb spoons of ground flax seed, eliminated the butter and added plain greek yogurt.  You can't tell the difference without the butter and this & plus the flax add lots of protein.  I did cook them on a lower heat because the batter is thick and takes longer to fluff up.  I did add a little more sugar to sweeten them up for the kids but you can't really tell.  I have made them 2x so far, and you can't tell the difference, so if you want to add protein try it.

This recipe is Alton Brown's and I use it routinely to make pancakes. The only difference is I use buttermilk not soured milk. You  will need to increase the buttermilk to 1 cup as buttermilk is thicker than soured milk. The buttermilk really makes for a lighter, fluffier pancake. I don't add the cinnamon or vanilla. 

I keep this mix in a jar on the shelf in my pantry so I don't have to stop and mix the dry ingredients every time I want to make pancakes. The mix recipe is- 6 cups all purpose flour, 1.5 tsp baking soda, 1 Tablespoon baking powder, 1 Tablespoon kosher salt, 2 Tablespoons sugar. Use 1 cup dry mix and add the liquid ingredients from the recipe (1 egg, buttermilk/soured milk, and butter). Having the mix already on the shelf speeds up breakfast.

These pancakes are so light and fluffy.  I added the vanilla but not the cinnamon.  Yes, they taste like cake without the frosting.  Delicious!

I made these as stated, including the optional cinnamon and vanilla. I'm not a huge pancake fan but I thought they were delicious. My husband and son love pancakes and they thought they were o.k. but they requested no cinnamon and vanilla next time. I gave this four stars because when you do add the cinnamon it makes the pancakes a very unappealing color. I was afraid my family would not even try them. Thankfully they gave them a go.

DELICIOUS!! Read a few reviews, omitted cinnamon but everything else exact to recipe as instructed. Everyone loved it, the kids ate leftovers as snacks. My husband was impress with the recipe and asked about pre-making dry mix to have on hands for future use. I did use fresh eggs (at room temp) instead of store bought, this makes a difference in a lot of recipes that calls for eggs. Definitely a keeper!

These are some of the best I've made! I changed only two things, I didn't have milk so I used half and half, and I only added one teaspoon of cinnamon. I cant express how good they are! This is going to become my "standard recipe!!

Mine came out flat, like crepes.  I see from other reviews that may have been due to the vanilla and over mixing. My family prefers fluffier pancakes.

I made this recipe when my "picky" grandsons had a sleep over!  I ended up making two batches, they ate them up so
fast, and my husband thought they were terrific.  Thanks for the save All Recipe.

I'm 76 & have been making pancakes like this all my 'cooking' life!  May I suggest melted bacon grease instead of butter (great flavour), and 2 eggs.  Also, I cook them on a griddle but a cast iron frying pan will do as well, just not as many..... cook them until the bubbles come up and 'pop', then flip over & cook the other side for a couple more minutes until a golden colour.  Vanilla and cinnamon really are not 'required' - just for personal taste & they make the batter 'brown-ish' which can be off-putting to some.  Otherwise, don't overmix.... slightly 'lumpy' is the trick!  Enjoy.

I made this for the kids I watch on a snow day. I added 2 chopped apples 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and a pinch of ground cloves. It turned out awesome and the kids all loved it.

I used the optional vanilla and cinnamon. The pancakes were fluffy, but all I could taste was cinnamon. I was looking forward to a tangy pancake from the soured milk, but it just didn't come through. I think I'll have  to try them without cinnamon next time.

This reminds me of my grandmother pancakes but love the addition of the cinnamon and vanilla. I like to cook them in extra light olive oil because it makes the edges crispy like grandma's. Yum!!!!!

Delicious!! I didn't have any butter so instead I used shortening. I used the same exact amount that it called for for butter. I also used both of the cinnamon and the vanilla extract. I used less than it called for for both of those ingredients. This pancake was delicious and rich!! This is one of those pancakes you can only eat a couple of. I also freezes the extras and heated them up for breakfast. They were still great! Definitely a five star!

This recipe was awesome.  The cinnamon and vanilla definitely enhanced the flavor, and in my opinion should not be omitted. I did cut the cinnamon back to 1 tsp though and added blueberries. Will make again!!

We really liked these pancakes! I only put 1 1/2tbsp of vinegar because I read the reviews that said they could taste it. We didn't taste the vinegar at all. I'll try it with 2 next time... I added the cinnamon and vanilla. Wow! I didn't really taste cinnamon much, but it gave them a wonderful smell. This is going to be my go to recipe from now on. Thanks!!

Just made these and they came out wonderfully! I substituted in almond milk and vegan butter, since I have a milk allergy, and they were fabulous! I did opt out on the cinnamon, and added a bit extra vanilla. Will definitely make again!

I'm not a pancake fan at all.  However, even I thought this recipe was great.  My hubby said it's a 5 star+!!   
I used buttermilk since I had some on hand.  My batter looked overly thick, so I thinned it down a bit with some milk.  
I left out the vanilla and cinnamon.  
Nice to have an easy recipe to make from scratch rather than resorting to processed store bought mix.  These are truly light and fluffy!!!

Usually I use a mix, but took the time with family visiting to make this scratch recipe.  It was well worth the time.  These pancakes were delicious!

Made these this morning and the hubby loved them.
I did not use cinnamon or vanilla but instead right before cooking them I put some in a smaller bowl and added thawed (and drained) blueberries just before putting that batter into the pan.
Then i made the rest of the batter plane.

Use low setting for sure or u will burn them. I forgot about that and almost burned the first 2 made. (Thankfully I saved them just in nick of time :))

I found the batter will almost look curdled when u mix the milk mixture with flour mixture but that's  normal... Just dont over mix to keep all the lovely fluffy goodness

Made these this morning for the first time. Everyone liked them. I chose to use the cinnamon and everyone requested to skip that ingredient next time. One person said they reminded them of cinnamon muffins when they first tasted them But The Pancake Flavor Was quick to come in. The cakes are pretty sweet so not much syrup was used at our table. Will make them again but with less sugar and no cinnamon.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!!

Just as the name implies, these pancakes are fluffy and delicious.  I used buttermilk instead of the soured milk and omitted the cinnamon.  I added frozen blueberries (habit) and they were wonderful.

WANTED A GOOD PANCAKE RECIPE AND THIS FULFILLED OUR BEST EXPECTIONS. MADE IT EXACTLY THE WAY IT WAS WRITTEN. I HAVE PUT CINNAMON IN BOX PANCAKE MIXES FOR YEARS, GIVES THEM A CINNAMON ROLL KIND OF TASTE. MAYBE NEXT TIME I WILL LEAVE IT OUT TO TASTE THE PANCAKES A LITTLE MORE. WONDERFUL!!!

My go to recipe. I have tried this recipe in many different ways but I think I now have it down packed.I've never added cinnamon but vanilla, yes. The vanilla left my pancakes with a slight bitter taste. I left the milk & eggs out for at least an hour to get it to room temperature. I found that by doing that, it makes the buttermilk curdle better. I also used a wooden spoon to "fold" the batter not stir. I let the mixed batter sit for about 5 minutes.

Great recipe.  Kept meaning to leave a review.  I added blueberries to the mix and they were delicious.  I also used apple cider vinegar and it added a good flavor kick.  They turned out beautifully.

I made the recipe as is (without the vanilla and the cinnamon). They were fluffy and delicious. We like our pancakes thinner so I tried a second batch with the vanilla and a little extra milk.....the best pancakes we've made so far. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe...it's a keeper!

Nice texture very fluffy.  I think these are my new favorite.  FYI aside from the optional vanilla  and cinnamon this is the same exact recipe as the "Fluffy Pancakes" Recipe by: kris.  Thank you for the recipe.

I followed this recipe as is and they turned out fabulously and were very delicious.  Next go round I might try some Nutmeg or Allspice to give them a little bit of a Christmassy kick...so many possibilities!

I have been looking for quite some time for a REALLY fluffy pancake recipe.... yay! I found it!  These pancakes are so fluffy.... and light which, in my opinion is a wonderful pancake!  The taste is absolutely great also. The kids loved them also... so make sure you make a double batch! I omitted the cinnamon, only because I don't care for it, and also the vanilla, only because of previous reviews.  I think I will add the vanilla next time just to see the difference. Also liked this recipe because these are ingredients readily available in my pantry, so little planning ahead was necessary.

This is my go- to recipe for pancakes.  They're easy and foolproof. I like the little bit of sweetness from the sugar and often eat them with just a bit of butter and no syrup. My daughter likes for me to add chocolate chips while they're cooking.

We absolutely LOVE these pancakes... and here are my secrets: I always cook bacon, first, on the griddle where I later cook the pancakes and cook them in the bacon grease (yum).  I use at least 1/3 all wheat flour - this gives them a slightly different flavor and more substance (yum).  We serve them with butter, fresh cut strawberries, hot syrup and the bacon (a whole lotta yum).  My mother-in-law claims it's the best breakfast she's ever had (better than yum).  I'm not going to argue with her... on this!  :-)

These pancakes really are fluffy and delicious.  I added a tablespoon of Flax seed meal and it gave them a little more moistness. I will definitely make them again.

These pancakes were really good and I'd definitely make them again. They are soft and taste like cake and are best served with syrup. I used vanilla but not cinnamon (both of which the creator listed as optional). My brothers love them and say that they want me to use that recipe every time I make pancakes. ??

Out with the old pancake recipe, in with the new one!  I've never made pancakes from a store bought mix for my family.  I've always made them from scratch.  But this one tops my usual go to recipe.  It will now be at the top of the list.  Thank you for sharing it.  (Added blue berries to the second batch YUMMMM!)

I love this recipe.  My kids and husband say it's the best pancakes.  Note, I only put in 1/2 tsp of cinnamon as last time 1tsp seemed a bit much.  Thx for the recipe.

Fantastic without the cinnamon and vanilla 
After reading that the vanilla causes the pancakes to flatten, I omitted both vanilla and cinnamon. Otherwise, I followed  the recipe exactly as written. Best I've ever had and family agreed. Fluffy, moist and excellent flavor.

Must say I've been making this recipe for 40 or so years, minus the cinnamon, and they're always a hit. Some variations are: use orange juice instead of the milk and/or add 1 tablespoon poppy seeds, use half whole wheat flour.  I never thought they tasted like cake.

Spot on with one of the reviewers suggested vanilla extract unfluffs these pancakes. I made these both with cinnamon and nutmeg and plain and were delicious. Next time imma try fresh vanilla bean.

I made these with adaptation for gluten and dairy—gluten-free flour (with xanthan gum) and almond milk (works fine with the vinegar). I also did include the cinnamon (just a couple of shakes) and the vanilla. That being said, the verdict was that these are probably the best pancakes ever. I personally feel they could use a bit more liquid, as I had to pat out the batter on the griddle because the batter was SO stiff. They also took forever to cook, I think for the same reason, even though the griddle was on high. I was surprised, therefore, when the finished products were so very light and fluffy, and the perfect balance of salty and sweet. I will definitely be making these again!

I used milk that  had soured on it's own in the Frig and looked for a recipe and went from there.  I  used Nutiva Coconut sugar which gave it  a  wonderful flavor plus 1 tesp. of cinnamon, and no vanilla.  Absolutely  yummy pancakes.  I will make them again for sure.   Sally  ;-)

Light and fluffy pancakes! The key is the milk with white vinegar (buttermilk) and the baking soda and baking powder add that extra that makes this incredible pancakes!

Once you make these pancakes, you will NEVER use a mix or eat them out!!  The only thing I do differently is no cinn. and I use buttermilk as I do think it tastes better than milk and vinegar. You can freeze buttermilk too for the next batch.  Also very IMPORTANT  after you mix everything together let it sit for 15 mins.  before you cook it.  I forgot my husband LOVES them!!!
Me too!!!

What the person who submitted the recipe left out of the recipe is dont over mix the batter and after you mix it let it sit for 10 or 15 mins you will see the batter rise some and you will see bubbles. After it sits do not i repeat DO NOT stir the batter again just scoop out some batter to make your pancakes (i use a 1/4 measuring cup)and continue with the rest without stiring the batter. Dont mash the pancakes down while their cooking either. If you restir that batter your pancakes will come out flat. I been using this recipe for a long time way before seeing it here and i have mastered it. This is an awesome recipe done right!

Since finding this recipe last week I have made this 4 times. Absolutely, hands down the best pancakes ever! My husband swears by bisquick and  begrudgely agrees these are way better. I followed the recipe as written with the cinnamon & vanilla and my children (ages 6, 4 & 1) went wild eating 3-4 pancakes each, no syrup needed.  Even with out the cinnamon this recipe is an outstanding base...To the base recipe I have added in fresh banana, berries, applesauce & they are always excellent! I always let the batter rest for 5-10 minutes and scoop out ~1/4 c of batter per pancake. Perfection, thank you!

Loved it! One suggestion- instead of 1/4 cup, try 1/2 cup of batter. Makes super fluffy delicious pancakes.

Even my son who does not care for pancakes, loved these. My dad who is a super picky eater was so surprised to find out that  I used spoiled milk to make it, if he knew ahead of time i know he would not have even trued them. So easy will definitely make again.

This is a great base recipe. I also omitted the vanilla.  I doubled the recipe.  Substituted 1/2 cup almond joy coffee creamer and 1 cup milk. Used lemon juice instead of vinegar and added a couple shakes worth of cinnamon. Didn't not get real fluffy but did get thick with a nice moist texture.  I put some slivered almond on mine with butter and syrup. Family couldn't get enough of them.

As another reviewer stated, this is the same recipe as Fluffy Pancakes except for the addition of cinnamon and vanilla, which is exactly what I like. Thumbs up for quick and easy pancakes from scratch. Bonus for not having to buy buttermilk. I always use the "sour milk" method.

I did not have the vinegar. Only item omitted. My husband is not big on cinnamon, but I am! So I added only 1 tsp. cinnamon. My son and I loved them and he is a picky eater.  Printing this one for my recipe binder.

These turned out fluffy and delicious. I even used 1/2 cup  whole wheat flour and they were still very moist and light.  I doubled the recipe for my family of 5 and I'm so glad I did because they ate them right up.

These pancakes are perfect!  Crispy edges and perfect thickness.  Sweet and savory.  My kids favorite.  I also freeze the left overs and can pop them in the toaster any morning for a quick breakfast for my kids.

I only used 1 tsp cinnamon instead of the 1 1/2 tsp it calls for, thought it might be to much But will try the full amount next time. Also will try with blueberries or chocolate chips sometimes. Yummy and Fluffy, my new pancake recipe!

This recipe was awesome. I did not have any vinegar, so I used 3/4 buttermilk instead. I did use the vanilla, but not the cinnamon.  The pancakes were fluffy and sweet, my daughter and I loved them! Will definitely be making these on a regular basis.

I make these a lot on the weekends for my family. They love them! I use cinnamon sometimes but they taste just as great without. If your used to buttermilk pancakes but don't have any buttermilk, using the vinegar mixture is great. I usually add an extra tablespoon of vinegar tho. And I always double the recipe. And once I added cocoa to make chocolate pancakes. Still the best!

I have tried numerous pancake recipes, and this is by far the best.    Always tried for the fluffiest pancake I can get, (kids love them fluffy) and these were perfect!  BIG 5 stars.

Easy to follow recipe, I have never used 'sour' milk before, so this was a new thing for us.  From the first one in the pan to the last, all came out golden brown and fluffy! We cooked them one at a time though over slightly below medium heat. 

We left out the butter, just because it has always made a denser cake for me. 

Loved it, will use this again!

I used buttermilk in stead of whole milk. I think the whole milk would have been better.

these are so good for those weekend mornings. I put most of the dry ingredients into ziploc bags and write the rest of the recipe on them. Then on Saturday morning I can just grab a bag from the cupboard and hey presto. delicious fluffy pancakes.

Excellent recipe, I  did it twice, but I had to add 1/2 cup of flour. The pancakes were really fluffy,  delicious and much appreciated. I have tried so many recipes before, this time I got the good one!

Hands down the most delicious pancake recipe I've ever tried! These pancakes are very light, fluffy, easy to whip up, and have a nice buttery flavour. I mix all the dry ingredients together and store them in a glass jar, that way when I want to make them it only takes a few minutes. Thanks for the submission!

Absolutely delicious!! So fluffy! I love the flavor the cinnamon adds and would not leave them out. They are a bit plain without the flavorings.

I made this today and didn't change anything except that I was out of baking power. It didn't call for much,so it was fine without it. It kind of reminded me a little of French Toast with the cinnamon,but they were good. I might not add the cinnamon and vanilla next time,but I still think they are pretty good!

I have made this recipe so many times and I absolutely loved it ?? my whole family did too, I love baking and cooking from scratch not from a box mostly because you know what your putting inside your food. From all of the pancake recipes I've made this one definitely beats all the others.

For this recipe I didn't have any white vinegar so I squeezed a lemon and used lemon juice as a substitute. The pancakes didn't taste sour or like lemons so it worked nicely.This recipe is really easy and fun to make. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do! ??

My family absolutely loves these pancakes! They will eat them for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. The best thing about them was all the ingredients were in my pantry! I didn't use the vinegar to sour the milk just used almond milk instead and it was still the best ever. Thank you so much for sharing.

it is indeed fluffy! The technique is do not overmix it as how all pancakes should be. it is okay to have lumps in the batter.  no need to buy store bought mixes, omitted cinnamon and vanilla.  thank you!

We found these disappointing — kinda flat, not very flavorful. If you want a really fully pancaked try "Grandad's Pancakes" from this site.

I just made this recipe and it was one of the best I've ever had! I was skeptical of some of the ingredients(sugar? vinegar?), but decided to try it as written. My family loved these so much that they didn't save me any and I had to make another batch:)

Fluffy, good flavor(I did not add cinnamon). Kind of a lot of work and my batter was extremely thick, so I added 2 Tbls of milk to make it "stirable". The flavor is good enough to use again, but it's not a quick workday morning type recipe.

These were great. We made a double batch with blueberries. I did use the vanilla but not the cinnamon. I think if I make them with blueberries again, I might cut a little of sugar. I really likes the texture of these and the whole family cleaned their plates!

Very good.  Try 1/2 club soda and 1/2 milk next time for the fluffy factor.

I have made this recipe several times after being in search of thick fluffy pancakes. This is the winner! I did change a few inconsequential things. I used buttermilk in place of the milk and vinegar (because I had it on hand). I added a tablespoon of malted milk powder and I omitted the cinnamon. Delicious!

Made exactly as written with no vanilla or cinnamon and it came out perfect, my kids loved! This doesn’t make many pancakes, maybe 4 that are 4.5” diameter (average size). You may want to double the recipe for a family of 4.

Used 1/2 wheat flour, and 1/2 almond flour. 
Subbed apple cider vinegar because I was out of white... worked just fine.
Reduced salt to 1/2t and cinnamon to 1 t. 
Added vanilla to warm (real) maple syrup since alcohol extracts can affect the fluffiness. 
Will make these again!

These were delicious. I used half and half because I didn't have milk, so I suspect that they were a bit richer than they should've been, but I loved them. I also substituted vanilla bean ghee for the melted butter which provided a mellow hint of vanilla.

I made no changes to the recipe. The pancakes were fluffy.   I did add some blueberries to some of the pancakes, just sprinkling them on top. Excellent uncomplicated recipe

These are the most amazing pancakes ever!  The first time I made them without the cinnamon and they were very good but adding the cinnamon really elevated them.  I ate the first one with nothing on it and it was delicious just that way. Of course adding toppings was even better. I put apple butter on mine.  My boyfriend added butter, syrup and whipped cream as suggested. I will make these over and over

I've made this recipe twice for my grandchildren. They are delicious and easy, no more pancake mix for me! I left out the cinnamon only because it's not a flavor we are used to in our pancakes,  but made recipe as written.

Light and fluffy. I read the reviews and suggestions. I found the reviews helpful. I didn't add the vanilla or the cinnamon and was careful not to over mix. They came out pretty darn good.

I left out the cinnamon and vanilla just to try this recipe as basic as possible. Do make sure your skillet or griddle is hot enough or you'll end up with flat discs...tasty discs, but flat. Other than my blunder, this recipe was amazing! Tender, perfect pancakes that my family devoured. This will definitely be our go-to recipe from now ona

The batter is very thick.  Pancakes take longer to cook because of it so  burning is inevitable. I would thin it out with more milk.
I also think the vinegar gave it an odd taste.

These pancakes were very fluffy and tasty 

I don’t like them too sweet so I omitted the cinnamon and vanilla.  I also cut the sugar down slightly.  

Great recipe!

I had buttermilk and did not have to use white vinegar. Changed butter for virgin olive oil.  These pancakes were great!!  Definitely a keeper.

The only thing different I did was I used butter milk instead of milk with vinegar.  Very thick, almost cake like.  Yummy!  I used a 1/4 cup measuring cup per pancake and it made exactly eight.  Since I live alone I will freeze leftovers and use the rest later.

I cut back on the amount of cinnamon called for in the recipe and it was still overwhelming (and I like cinnamon). I might try recipe again without the cinnamon, but I threw out most of this batter.

I made this once and now my family doesn't want any other pancakes. The batter is thick so we thought the pancakes would be heavy. NO WAY! These are the lightest pancakes we ever had. We set the stove to low medium so they would finish all the way to the center without getting too dark on the outside. You may want to experiment with your stove settings.

I normally put cinnamon sugar on top of my pancakes, along with syrup. With this recipe, I didn’t have to because it was already built into the pancake. Delicious!  And my husband agreed!  Recipe says it serves 4 but I’d say it only serves 2.

I followed the recipe exactly, but I did use butter in my pan instead of cooking spray. This batter was so thick that I wasn’t 100% about how they would turn out, but the pancake itself is so thick and fluffy that it soaked the syrup right up without making the pancake wet. The cinnamon added a delicious touch. My kids loved them!

I didn't have any milk so substituted with almond milk and left out the white sugar. I found the batter really thick and thus the pancakes were more like biscuits.

These were absolutely delicious! They were light and fluffy and went excellent with butter and maple syrup. I didn’t add the vanilla or cinnamon like other reviewers said and they were still yummy. I don’t think I will ever use box mix again! They did seem a tad tedious coming from someone who has never made homemade pancakes in her life but TOTALLY worth it. Will definitely make again.

Great recipe but be sure to read recommendations in reviews, ie not using vanilla, waiting to combine wet ingred with dry, etc. This made only 8 smallish, thick pancakes so next time will try to increase by half. But still excellent.

I didn't have butter or baking soda, so I used oil in its place and a smidge more baking powder. Still came out fluffy and delicious!

I just made these as an anniversary surprise for my husband along with eggs turkey breakfast links, and hash brown potatoes. These are the best pancakes I ever made. I doubled this recipe because my adult brother lives with us, and I felt I needed to double it. Any leftovers will be eaten the next morning.  I doubled everything in this recipe but not the vinegar. I felt it would have a vinegar taste that might overwhelm the taste of the pancakes. I did not add vanilla as I read other reviews stating do not add the vanilla, and I did not add cinnamon because I wanted a buttery flavored pancake and sometimes the cinnamon can take over.  I cooked them on low heat, and added a little amount of melted butter to the pan with every pancake. Also sprayed Pam to the pan before I started cooking.  I’m very happy with this recipe. It’s a keeper for me.

I didn't have cow's milk so I used some homemade almond milk and apple cider vinegar. My only regret was that I didn't double the batch! These are simply delicious!

I've made the recipe as is, and it turns out nice every time.  I've also made changes (reducing butter, and adding a mashed banana) and it turns out great too.  Very versatile recipe!

This is our new favorite pancake mix. I will double the recipe next time as it only made 8 medium to large size pancakes. I melted butter on the pan before pouring on the batter and it provided a nice crispy outside. Just like our favorite pancake restaurant!

This is my favorite pancake recipe.  Light fluffy pancakes every time.  I use a smaller pan and I cover it on low heat to allow the pancakes to rise without scorching the bottom.  I serve with fresh steamed blueberries and whipped cream on top.  Delicious!

This one turned out light and fluffy and tasted great!  I didn't add the cinnamon this time but put in some blueberries and they tasted great in the recipe.  I loved the flavor and the texture of these.   I would definitely make this one again!

Very easy recipe and wonderful results. I used the cinnamon but the next time I plan to use the vanilla and pecans

Recommend to do for breakfast any morning since it gets put together very quickly.

Delicious!!!  I have made these 4 times in the past five days because they are so good! The batter is easy to put together and turns out very airy and the pancakes taste just like a fluffy cake with crispy edges. I didn't try with cinnamon or vanilla yet since they are so good as is. This will definitely be a regular breakfast item at our house.

This recipe was fantastic. The first time I made it was a hit,my son asked me to make it again.  The second time was not as good, the batter was too thick. I tried to thin it with milk but I don't think it worked. I added the liquid to the flour mixture, maybe that's where I went wrong. I'll follow the recipe next time by adding the flour mixture to the milk instead.

These were indeed very fluffy and flavorful. I made them just as described with the vanilla and cinnamon added last. They need to be cooked immediately on Med heat. If you let the batter sit once you mix the liquid and dry ingredients the reaction of bakin soda and vinegar will reduce. There is no vinegar or baking soda taste if you folllow the recipe.

My modifications to the recipe were elementary:
Buttermilk in place of the milk and vinegar.
Brown sugar instead of the white sugar
Self rising flour in place of the flour and baking powder.
I also like to add other things like M&Ms or blue berries. Sometimes I will add other fruits like peaches diced finely, or applesauce. Another addition I use is peanut butter. Use your imagination.

I didn't make any changes and these pancakes turned out amazing!  Best pancakes I've ever had and my husband and daughter loved them, too!

This is by far the simplest and Best recipe I have ever made! I was hesitant because of the vinegar but figure what the heck, why not try it. My picky 2 year old absolutely loves it! Fluffy and cooks easily. Only problem is we want more!!! LOL

We excluded the cinnamon but added Vanilla and it was a huge hit! This will now be my family recipe to pass! Thank you so much for sharing this!

Fabulously light and fluffy! I've tried this recipe before using a lower acidity vinegar and they did not turn out as well as with the 25%acid. Also, I had to add half cup more milk so the batter would actually pour but once on the skillet, it was a breeze. This has become our favorite pancake recipe, hands down!
