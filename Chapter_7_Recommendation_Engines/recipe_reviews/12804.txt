This is a great recipe if you are having guests over for dinner. Easy to make, impressive to serve. I split the sauce in half -- the first half I kept as a finely diced salsa, the second half I pureed in a blender to make more of a sauce. I presented the scallops by first making a small pool of sauce, layering the scallops on top, and then finally garnishing the scallops with the salsa. It looked nice and added some nice flavor to the scallops (which I choose not to coat with flour before frying).

Like others, I skipped flouring the scallops and just seared them over medium-high heat for 2-3 minutes per side.  Also, as others suggested, I made half of the papaya mix into a salsa, and I pureed the other half into a sauce.  This recipe makes LOADS of the papaya sauce, so even if you halve it, you will have plenty to work with.   We really enjoyed this with Goldy's Special Salad (found on allrecipes.com).

This meal was absolutely delicious.  The only thing we did different was lightly simmer the papaya sauce for about (5) minutes to make it blend together.  Big hit.

I loved this recipe for how easy it was to make. I kept the salsa at room temp so it wouldn't "cool" the scallops too fast. I followed the suggestion of not using "flour" for the scallops.. I bought the big, Japanese jumbo scallops. Careful not to overcook.. they were sweet and a perfect combo with the salsa. To spice it up I changed the pepper to habanero, used regular sweet yellow onions (Walla Walla). I made some rice cooked in coconut milk.. and voila!! It even looked pretty on the plate! Great choice!

This is really good - however, it does make a TON of sauce!! (and really, what else can you use it for?? :) However, what really dismayed me was the cost of this meal!! It's a great meal but is definitely a "special occasion" meal! I made this along with Goldys Special Salad and I think I spent over $30 for the scallops and salad (for 2 people). I would probably try with smaller (cheaper) bay scallops next time and reserve half the papaya in the fridge to eat later.

I was very excited to make this recipe after reading all of the reviews, but I was a tad disappointed with it.  It was an easy recipe, but really didn't have a lot of flavor.  The onions are very overpowering, even after cutting the amount in half, and there was no "spice" at all - I even put in a full jalepeno pepper rather than the 1 tsp it called for.  I also think mango would be a better choice than the papaya.

I mixed this with chilean sea bass cut into small chunks.  Everyone loved it.  I can't believe how simple this was and how amazing it tasted.

This recipe was ok. I made it last night for Valentine's day dinner and I expected a lot more given the reviews. The "salsa" was excellent, but the sea scallops were a little bland and got cold too fast on top of the cold salsa mixture. The two just didn't go together that well and reminded me of some dishes I get in trendier restaurants that just don't turn out to be that good because someone was trying to be a little too creative. I don't think I would ever flour scallops again. I'd rather just pan fry them in some flavored oil. Part of the problem may have been that I did use the large sea scallops (which I was told have better flavor) rather than the small bay scallops. In my opinion, scallops just don't have much flavor in any form. I prefer Chinese scallop dishes a lot more.

I struggled rating this recipe since there were two of us eating this, each with different opinions.  First, the preparation:  Hubs did flour the scallops, under protest,  in the interest of experimentation and for purposes of rating the recipe as written.  He still prefers searing the scallops without flouring them.  You can use higher heat and he prefers to season the scallops directly.  I prepared the salsa, and as I was doing so, was not impressed.  Red pepper, red papaya and red onion provided little variation in color, therefore making it look particularly uninteresting.  Thank goodness for the flecks of cilantro and jalapeno for the little contrast in color they provided.  As for taste, you can't go wrong with seared scallops, really, unless you overcook them.  Hubs  did a good job.  Odd, he liked that papaya salsa much better than I did, and he doesn't care for cilantro!  He found it subtle in flavor, which he appreciated as it didn't compete or distract from enjoying the delicate flavor of the scallops.  I, on the other hand, found it relatively flavorless save for the cilantro.  Overall I found the dish ok,  I guess, but definitely not a "make again."  For a tropical salsa, I would prefer something brighter, fresher, and more interesting.   Mango and pineapple, or even just pineapple, would have been ideal additions.  Hubs says "a four," I say "a weak three."  I served this with fresh Florida sweet corn and Rick Bayless' Green Poblano Rice (excellent,  by the way).

Delicious!  I made this for the first time when company came over and it was a big hit!!  I followed others suggestions and did not flour the scallops, simply put salt and a little pepper in a ziploc bag and shook them to coat.  I also served over Goldy's Special Salad and it was YUMMY!!!  I will definitely be making this recipe again!

This was okay.  I chose to flour and fry the scallops, if I make this again, I won't.  I also used the smaller sea scallops, and I think it would of been better if I had used larger ones.  I also took the salsa and pureed and heated it up, that was very good.

I've used very small freezed sea scallops and it was really good.
Thank you.

Very good.  I made a double batch...but used 2 whole jalepenos.  I did  not flour scallops either.  I seared in olive oil that I had flavored with lots of garlic, pepper and lemon pepper.  Pureeed salsa was wonderful the next day over veggie omlettes

This was really really good! I didn't flour the scallops, i don't understand why you would do that to them. I pureed half and kept half as salsa. They were both really good, although I think we preferred the salsa better, so next time maybe I will puree a quarter of it and keep the other 3/4 as salsa. The flavours and the colours were both fantastic! I also served it with Goldys special salad. Perfect!!! Next time maybe I'll add a little bulgur... Thank you!!!

Just made this for a valentine's treat... Presents extremely well with lots of color. I didn't flour the scallops and simmered 1/2 of the salsa to make a sauce as previous cooks have mentioned. Definitely recommend doing both. The cooked salsa does really brings the whole dish together. I made this with the Gourmet Mushroom Risotto (also on this site).

I might experiment with this.  I thought there was WAY too much red onion....to the point of overpowering much else.  Next time I would cut the onion back to no more than 1/4 to 1/3 cup.  (Maybe we just have really big red onions here in Florida?? lol) This was not the least bit spicy to me either.  I prepared the scallops with the flour and thought they were very good.  I used the big scallops (ten dollars a pound).

Loved this recipe!! The mixture of flavors was truly outstanding. Reminds me of a dish one would eat on vacation in Cancun. The only thing I would change is I wouldn't put as much onion in it as the recipe called for.

It is a good recipe, though I cooked the papaya salsa because the onion was very strong.  I cooked the scallops, set them to the side, and then cooked the mixture in the same oil as the scallops. It helped tie the meal together.

FANTASTIC. Substituted the jalapeno with a habanero to give it more kick and served over rice. Kept extra sauce for salsa and/or fish tacos.

This was great. I hate to take a recipe and change it, but I just took it a step further. I had an extra jalapeno so I cut it into small slivers, coated it in some sesame oil and used the flour mixture and pan fried them. I served the scallops on a bed of instant potatoes (which I mixed in some of the papaya salsa) laid the pan seared scallops on top, dressed that with more salsa and topped each scallop with one fried jalapeno. We liked the flavor so much, I made it twice this week.   Enjoy!

Real nice recipe.  I skipped the flour and changed the papaya to pineapple.  It gave it a real nice and light taste.  Wasn't that spicy and I added a whole jalapeno.  I served it with uncle bens wild rice, which was a good compliment.  Defenitly makes a lot of sauce...as others...i would recomend keeping half as a salsa.  Which is great on salads or or even burgers.

Restaurant quality entree. I skipped coating the scallops with flour, which resulted in a much paler colored meat.
The salsa was awesome, I used mango instead. Had plenty left over for another meal.
Thanks Carla!

This is delicious! I used bay scallops this time and will try the big ones next time, as they will probably stay together better. The sauce was very tasty. On the suggestions of other reviewers, we paired this with Goldy's Special Salad and it was a beautiful, delicious, nutritious meal.

My husband first cooked this for me on Valentines day, and we both were so impressed with the presentation and flavor.  The vivid colors of papaya and red pepper make this dish so pretty.  The onion is a bit too strong, might skip it next time.  A lot of chopping for this dish, but quite worth it.  Think we'll serve it again for next dinner guests!

We really enjoyed this recipe, especially the sauce. I blended it up in my food processor to make it more like a salsa and that worked great for us. My husband has been using the leftovers in burritos, and thinks it is a great salsa flavor. Yummy!

I loved this recipe, all of the flavors mixed really well.  Next time, though, I will skip flouring the scallops and just fry them in a nonstick pan for better flavor.

This dish was delicious, quick and easy to make. However, it is not really a 'sauce', but a papaya salsa. I also agree with another reviewer in that there is no need to flour the scallops. They are better with just a pinch of salt and seared over high heat for a few minutes.

My fiance and I made this for Valentine's Day and it was delicious ! We actually pureed the sauce in a food processor and served it on the side. We also decreased the amount of salt just a bit .
Overall , a very easy and yummy recipe !

I served this to my neighbors. Everyone loved it. I pretty much followed the recipe. I did put in more than a teaspoon of jalapeño as I like my food spicy.  I did not bread the scallops.

The salsa was delicious. I used Panko breadcrumbs instead of flour, which added a nice texture to the scallops.

I did make this and it was good. My family prefers mangos so I do believe next time I will make it with mango and more jalepenos.

Yum! This meal was absolutely delicious. The only thing we did different was place the papaya sauce  on lettuce.  Along the side of  fried catfish.  Next time we add scallops.  It was delicious!

Yum! Made this for the squaw who love sscallops. Made the salsa, and doubled the pepper. (We both love spice). For the scallops, I added garlic, butter and then added fresh shrimp. Set the dinner on a bed of white rice, salsa and scallop and shrimp medley. Next time, I'll set the main meal on a walnut/spinach salad mix!

This was amazing.   I added fresh pineapple and used it as a topping for grilled pork chops minus the scallops.  We couldn't believe how delicious it was.   I will definitely make this again!

This is an amazing recipe. I made it for my family and they loved it! the one thing I would change is the breading because it wouldn't stay on, it fell off in the pan.

The flavors in the salsa just didn't seem to balance.  It was an interesting idea, though.

Great recipe.  We followed the advice of others and didn't flour the scallops.  We served it with a mix of rice and bacon.  Would definitely use this recipe for guests.

This is for the salsa only. I made shrimp with it instead.  We loved the salsa and just tweaked it a bit to our taste and what I had.  I added a whole jalepeno, and used lemon juice instead. I used my food processor to finely chop the peppers and onion. Excellent flavor.

I used this for a dinner party and it was a huge hit!  I also didn't put the flour or pepper on the scallops before cooking and they were amazing!

I used this recipe for the papaya sauce only as I do not like scallops. The sauce makes a lot, so we varied our dishes for it. Served over Tuna steaks (not bad), rolled in a tortilla with baked cod for a fish taco (pretty good) and ate as a dip with pita chips. I did refrigerate it for a couple hours to help the flavors blend, and it was better the next day. Doesn't keep long though.

I made this for my husband's birthday also!  Even though my husband is not a big seafood eater, he loved this dish as much as I did.
