The flavors are there and very delicious for a stuffing, but I've made this twice now and think the amount of stock needs to be reduced and that this should be baked. Maybe GF breads differ, but I used the Schar brand and it took 20-25 minutes to toast the bread cubes. The first time I made the recipe as written and it was a soupy and soggy mess. To save it I had to bake it. The second time around I used less stock (1 1/4 cup and thought it needed more so added about another 1/4 cup and then it was a bit too moist and again I would bake it). Next time I would cook the veggies as directed, stir that into the toasted bread cubes, slowly add the vegetable stock until cubes are moist, and bake for a little bit adding additional liquid if needed. I'll make this again, but with some tweaks. Thanks for the recipe!

I used gluten free baguette and sour dough bread to make the croutons. I had to cook them longer in the oven to completely dry them out. Because the croutons were made from GF bread, it required more vegetable stock to moisten them. I also chose to bake the stuffing as well. Delicious!
