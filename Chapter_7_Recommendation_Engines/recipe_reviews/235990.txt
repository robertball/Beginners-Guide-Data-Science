Love the flavor! I substituted chicken with pork and used cauliflower for veggie. Served on a bed of white steamed rice.

Very good recipe - so easy - and delicious. I actually had a cooked chicken breast in the fridge that I cut up and used it instead of the uncooked chicken. It has a nice flavor and the lime juice adds that little touch!! The provolone works well with this dish.

I used sharp provalone not smoked. It is incredible and reheats very well. No need to change a thing.

I made this quickly with things I had in the pantry and freezer and it was delicious. I used stewed whole tomatoes and their sauce. I added some garlic and cumin to the tomatoes. For the green pepper I found half a bag of "Manage a Trois" in the freezer. This is a pre-cut mix of red yellow and green peppers that comes in a bag at Trader Joe's. It's really inexpensive and handy to keep on hand. Because there were three colors of pepper plus the tomatoes the finished product was really colorful. I served it with white rice so the nice sauce had somewhere to go. The kitchen even smelled good afterwards.

This was easy and delicious. Although I hesitated to keep the chicken in the pan while cooking the other ingredients I am glad I followed the recipe as written. I served it over noodles with a small side of arugula which went nicely with the sauce.

I added a chopped garlic clove to the onion. I removed the onion/pepper mixture before browning the chicken and added it back in after. The lime is what gives this the wonderful flavor. My husband and I loved it it was easy to make and was delicious. I'll definitely make it again! Thanks.

This was very good and pretty simple. I subbed out fresh tomatoes and oregano for one 28 oz can of diced tomatoes with basil garlic and oregano. Also used juice of whole lime and service over brown rice.
