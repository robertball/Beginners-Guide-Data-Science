Way too sweet for my taste.  Couldn't figure out what to use it for.

I "tweaked" the recipe a little to give it more of a traditional salsa flavor...all it needed was jalapenos and cilantro! I also left out the additional sugar. VERY GOOD..thanks for sharing.

This was very good.  I did not add the additional sugar, as I thought it was sweet enough without it.  Served it over grilled red snapper and it was delicious!

I'm not particularly into peaches - I can take them or leave them - but I had some on hand, so I tried a random recipe here. I'd also never used crystallized ginger before - it's fairly expensive, I found. The combination with the green onions and marmalade was nice - my palate isn't sensitive enough that I really noticed the sugar, vinegar or ginger. I didn't eat this on grilled meats, as a previous reviewer suggested - that probably would've been good. I mainly just had it alone, like a fruit cocktail. I probably should've also tried a bit of it served warm, as suggested. It was a bit interesting, though, how some "juice" developed in the bottom of the bowl after the mixture sat in the fridge for a while.
In the end, I found this to be a fairly good dish. It didn't knock my socks off, since I'm not much into peaches. But I suspect that people who love peaches, and are a bit adventuresome, will probably give this a 4- or even a 5-star rating.

This salsa was really, really good. I would definitely recommend putting the sugar in last and tasting it before you add any sugar. I didn't need it at all because it ended up plenty sweet. I did add some salt and pepper and used some Tabasco sauce to give it a kick. It was excellent for dipping some tortilla chips in and I think it would be fantastic on chicken, beef, or fish. My husband absolutely could not stop eating this salsa. He had to tell himself to stop eating it but he couldn't. A definite keeping in my home now.

I REALLY liked this!  It was great as a dip for white corn tortilla chips.  The flavors probably would have blended together better had I let this chill before eating, but it smelled so good when I made it, I just couldn't wait...
