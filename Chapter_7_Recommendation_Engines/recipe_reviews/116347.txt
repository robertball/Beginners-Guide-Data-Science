I accidentally added a tablespoon of hot sauce instead of what the recipe called for, and the ribs still turned out great!  In fact, I liked the spicy kick and will probably make them the same way next time.  What's also nice about this recipe is that most of the ingredients are on hand, but the resulting flavors are delicious and different from regular barbeque sauce.

Very good and very easy!  It was a nice alternative to Souther-style or Chinese-style ribs...

My husband LOVED this, and he's usually not too crazy about anything with "sauce."  I left out the onions because he hates them, and used rice wine vinegar since I didn't have cider vinegar, but it still ROCKED!

This marinade was outstanding! I didn't used it for ribs though.  Instead I used it to marinate and grill chicken tenderloin kabobs.  I also brushed it on some vegetable kabobs that went along with the chicken.  It was fantastic and I can't wait to try it on ribs.  I think it will be equally fantastic.  I made very few modifications.  I didn't have celery salt so I used 1/4 teaspoon of celery seed and 1/4 teaspoon of salt. I also used dry ground ginger, halved the Worcestershire sauce and use 3/8 teaspoon of chili sauce (didn't have hot pepper sauce).  Delicious!  Thanks for a great marinade recipe.

Delicious!!  Made alot of sauce though but saved the rest to use on chicken.  Would add some garlic next time to give a bit more flavor.  I also cooked the ribs covered at 200 degrees till they fell apart.

My husband and kids liked them but I didn't very much.  I didn't cook them as long as was stated though after the sauce was on so perhaps it would have deepened into a richer flavour then.

This was super easy, and so yummy! I made this for me and my husband a few months ago, and he has been begging for me to make it again! o I'm making it again tonight! This was my very first ribs recipe, and I don't want to try any other ones now. They were fall off the bone good, and really juicy. I love the sweet and spicy kick. If you're considering this, you gotta try it! You can get other traditional ribs in any city, but this one is unique and sooo good!

We grilled this, rather than using the oven, which worked well.  It makes way more sauce than we needed for our rack of baby back ribs.  I reserved some for dipping and still had half of it leftover.  That will probably be used on chicken later in the week.  I'm not sure this will replace our favorite ribs, but I can see making it again, from time to time, for something different!  Thanks for the recipe!

We loved this sauce!  It's great to have a different twist on your every day BBQ sauce.  I didn't like how the ribs were cooked - will make again, but let the ribs bake at 250 for a few hours until tender. Then add sauce.

These were absolutely smashing! I prepared exactly as written.  Loved the sauce.  They were tender and delicious, a great alternative to traditional tomato based BBQ sauces.  A keeper & a do-over, thanks Joyce.

My mother got this recipe from the newspaper in the 1970s, it was one of her favorites. I forgot how good they were until I made them tonight. I use country style pork ribs. Served it with Easy Pilaf. Everyone loved them.
