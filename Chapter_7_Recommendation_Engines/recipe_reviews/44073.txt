I am Italian and we eat this all the time.  This recipe can use some help.... First - make it with alot less oil (3 tbs) then use chicken or vegetable broth.  Also, using fresh broccoli, fresh basil and some crushed red pepper makes all the difference.  I dont use mozzerella (no taste).  I finish it with Romano, parmiagano or feta depending on what we are in the mood for.

I added boneless chicken breast to the broccoli and garlic, just to make it a little more of a meal. My kids loved it, so for that reason it will have a space in my recipe box. In my opinion, this was good but a little dry. Maybe adding a can of cream of mushroom soup would give it the little extra moisture that it needs.

This was a great alternative as I needed a side without parmesan cheese with my Italian pork chops (I ran out...).  I used leftover spaghetti and added parsley (personal taste) and a couple tablespoons of milk (to help keep from drying out).  I think the milk wasn't so necessary as watching the dish.  I don't think it needs very much time in the oven.  The oven is what dries out the pasta and everything is already cooked, so it's best just to leave it in to melt the cheese rather than wait for it to be brown.  Covering with foil might be another option, too.  Overall - very good for a quick side!

I read the reviews before I made it and added about an 1/8 of a cup of milk while mixing it together...made it perfect...for a more filling meal I added Italian sausage which I cooked and then saut√©ed together with the brocolli (fresh) I also added about a test of Greek seasoning...and added an equal amount of cheddar cheese to the mozzarella (one 8 oz bag of cheddar and one 8 oz bag of mozz.)also I mixed the brocolli and pasta together before adding cheese and there were no clumps. It turned out absolutely amazing and to me and my hubby it solved all of the problems in previous reviews.

This recipe has great potential but was just alright as is.  16oz pasta for 6 people is quite a bit, so I stirred in just enough of the cooked pasta to be better balanced with the broccoli.  Quite a few other reviews said it was dry; I foresaw that and added in some butter, which helped but wasn't enough.  The cheese was in melted globs throughout the dish.  I think making a roux and creating a sauce would fix that.  I added Parmesan cheese too.  Really good flavors but I think making a little sauce would really help. Made for Western Region Allstars Faceless Frenzy July 2012

I thought this made a great meal.  I served it along side of a very meaty baked pasta dish for an "Italian Night" dinner party.  My friends are VERY picky eaters and they all loved it.  It was simple and good.  I don't think it was too dry at all - just make sure that you don't discard the oil in which the brocoli is cooked.  As the brocoli is cooking, it makes some water, a little bit of which can also be tossed in with the pasta.  All in all, I really liked this recipe and will definitely make it again.  I served it with some vegetarian eggplant marinara on the side for those who like things saucy.

This is my go-to "it's easy after work" recipe. Only change is that I saute the broccoli in about 1/4 cup olive oil, and add the remaining 1/4 cup as I'm mixing everything together. (Sometimes I need more, sometimes not so much.) I frequently saute a diced chicken breast or two with the broccoli, or grill some chicken beforehand and throw it in.  Thanks for a great staple!

Ingredients looked like I couldn't go wrong, but it came out very sticky with cheese, and dry - it needed some type of sauce, I think... anyway, I saved it by pulling the broccoli out and simply mixing it with some spiral pasta and butter and herbs...

This dish was great! The only thing I'd do differently is a little less oil, otherwise it was something everyone enjoyed. Also is good with a tad of spice (I used cayenne pepper) to give it a little kick.

I also added some chicken breast to make it more of a meal.  It wasn't too dry to eat, but I liked the idea of adding an alfredo sauce.

I thought it was too dry.  It works better as a side dish rather than a main dish.

This recipe definitely needs help. I found this to be dry and tasteless. I added Penzey's Pasta Sprinkle and that helped a lot. I also baked this covered so it wouldn't dry out. That helped a little, but I ended up adding quite a bit of half and half and a little butter.  This recipe could be saved  with a lot of doctoring up, but the original recipe is not one I would make again. Perhaps a cheese other than mozzarella or a combination of different cheeses would add flavor.

Not bad for an easy meal. Didn't make any changes besides using penne  pasta instead if ziti and vegetable oil instead of the olive oil since we had no time to run to the store. It is a very easy meal to make but it was very plain. I think it could use some kind of sauce instead of just the cheese to hold everything together to make it a five star recipe. 3 stars without any changes to the original recipe though. ^^

I added a little alfredo sauce and chicken to this dish and it was still way too dry.  I also added sundried tomatoes for a little extra kick. Keep in mind, the pasta needs somthing to absorb...the cheese alone makes it too dry.  Add a cream sauce and you'll be much happier with the end result.  Other than that, the flavors were great...it's a good base to start with.

I like ALOT of cheese so I did add more than suggested.  I also added a marinara sauce to it so I didn't have the 'dry' problem others have mentioned.  Chicken with the broccoli though would have been a great addition.  I served this with cheese garlic bread and it was awesome!!

This was very good.  I had already started making this  when I realized that I didn‚Äôt have broccoli, so I subbed in asparagus and instead of the oil used 2 tbsp of butter.  I will definitely make this again.

It was just ok.  I doubt I will make it again.  I followed some of the suggestions and used fresh broccoli.  I added chicken.  I added some milk in an attempt to make it creamier.  It was still pretty dry.

I made the recipe exactly as written.It was edible but kind of dry and boring. Needs some kind of white sauce to bring it to life. Removing it from my favorites.

I used multi color rotini, added pre cooked cubed boneless skinless chicken (saut√© step), and cream of chicken soup (during the tossing in a bowl step). Only needed to bake for 15 min (covered). Turned out great!

I enjoyed this recipe. It was tasty and very easy to make. I did cut down a little on the garlic, 4 cloves instead of 6 but it was great anyway. I added some crumbled bacon to the mix and it added a nice flavor. Thanks for posting a quick , easy and tasty recipe.

Very easy to make. Did an entire 9x14 glass baking dish. Plenty of left overs, just as good.

Could use more flavor. Made it with ham, fresh parsley and basil, still needed something.

Yep, I listened to others and kept it in the oven just long enough to melt the cheese. Also, I made it heartier by adding almond covered cubed chicken. Finally, I added halved cherries tomatoes to add color.

Tasty garlic-y side dish, and very easy to make! I used fresh broccoli, and blanched it in a steamer pot for a couple minutes while the pasta boiled below it. I also substituted half the mozzarella for extra old cheddar, used less oil, and added some extra spices (oregano, basil, cayenne powder).  I look forward to trying it again, next time with chopped red pepper and shredded chicken!

I made it with just the garlic, broccoli and pasta. I skipped the baking step. It was hot enough to add cheese just before serving. This way everyone could make it as cheesy as they like it.... saves better that way as well.

Followed the recipe as is. Pretty bland. My 8 year old granddaughter said we should try it with a different kind of cheese. I had to agree.

It was very dry and not much flavor.  I used fresh broccoli and added some left over rotisserie chicken.  I will add some vegetable broth and a more flavorful cheese to the leftovers.  should make a difference

My boyfriend and I enjoyed it. My teen daughter not so much. I didn't have olive oil, so I used butter to sautee the garlic and broccoli, and lots and lots of cheese! It was a little bit dry when I took it out of the oven, so next time, I will make sure to use olive oil. I made baked chicken breast on the side, and it was perfect together!

Great idea. I used broccoli florets instead of chopped. I'm not wild about mozzarella by itself, so I used half whole-milk mozzarella and half fontina for more flavor.

After reading some of the reviews, I decided to use a balsamic vinaigrette in place of half of the olive oil to saut√© the garlic and broccoli.  I also baked it for less time.  It was moist and flavorful--although my kids added an extra splash or two of vinaigrette after it was on their plate.  It was quick and well received so I would make it again!

As other reviewers stated, needs a little extra something. I added tomato sauce and some additional spices, as well as leftover chicken breast pieces. That helped, but still a bit dry. Will try again, but change up the recipe.

This recipe was just ok for me - but my family loved it.  I used extra garlic but it seemed as though something was missing.  As I said though, family loved it so it's in the rotation!
