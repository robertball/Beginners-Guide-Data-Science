Chef John, you have done it again! Created a mouth-watering recipe that my family loves!! For some reason, I always thought Braciole was a challenging, time-consuming dish to make but this is so easy and so incredibly delicious! (I love recipes that taste and look complex, but really aren't! This one fits the bill perfectly!!) I rarely tweak a Chef John recipe, but I did substitute basil for the oregano (simply personal preference, but I did add a dash of oregano as well) and I admit, I was tempted to leave out that pinch of red pepper flakes. I am so glad I didn't! It was just a tiny hint of "heat" that complemented this dish perfectly! Thanks for another fabulous recipe that my family has asked be put into the "regular rotation"! :-) And be sure to watch the accompanying video. Chef John gives some great hints and tips and talks about using other cuts of beef and how to cook them a bit differently for tenderness.

This is so flavorful! It is now part of my cooking rotation. I bake mine, with cooking sherry....filling is delicious.

This was OK. It just didn't have the flavour punch I was looking for. The raisins were the best part as they added a little touch of sweetness.

It was awesome.  Only change is that I used a pot to brown the meat vs a frying pan.  It was easier to get the sauce half way up the meat.  Also, I used white wine in place of the water.  The end product was spectacular.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made it.  I tried using toothpicks to hold the rolls together, but realized it would be impossible to brown the rolls in a frying pan, so we spent 20 minutes tying the rolls.  They were delizioso. I served them with a Puttanesca sauce. I made six using beef and six using pork. There were none left over!

Made it as written (almost) and it came out great! Used homemade tomato sauce. Forgot to put Parmesan in the stuffing (long story) so after I sliced it and shingled it on the plate I dumped the cheese all along it. Will most certainly be doing this more often, but will try adding  pancetta or bacon.  Thanks once again, John!

I was looking for a recipe for braciole as my Italian grandmother was out of the country and I had never gotten her recipe. This recipe came out very similar to hers! 

I would highly recommend this recipe, aside from my grandmother making it, I also worked in a very high end authentic Italian restaurant for 10 years that had excellent braciole. This recipe gave both a run for their money! I was surprised at how delicious it was, not only tender but rich and layered with spices that blended amazingly while still being able to identify the different flavors. 

I have since made other recipes from Chef John and he is an amazing chef! I, and the rest of the allrecipes community, are very lucky to have this gentleman contribute! Thank you for all of your fantastic recipes!

This was very tasty and tender.  I omitted the raisins because I didnâ€™t want a sweet flavor, just a savory one.  It was delicious!

I didn't add the rasins, but I put a slice of prociutto over the pounded steak before I stuff and tie it.  It adds another layer.

Really wasn't as hard to make as I expected ad I'm sure if tweaked a bit and practiced I could make it quite tasty. But with following this recipe I found the meat a bit dry. But it wasn't bad really, just not really a family fav either.

FANTASTIC!  DELICIOUS!!  This is the best thing I've made in ages!  And pretty simple too since I was able to purchase the meat already thin sliced and rolled from a German meat market in the form of Rouladen.  Other than that, I followed Chef John's recipe to a T and it was so, so delicious!  I'd suggest if you have the time,  I used fresh bakery italian bread dried in the oven the day before and hand torn into crumbles for the bread crumbs and I think that made it special rather than using packaged "bread crumbs".   I will be making this again and again!  Thank you Chef John!!
