I'm not gonna punish this recipe for poor results because I did change things.  I just want to let others know before they may waste ingredients trying to do what I did.  I was going for a lower fat, healthier recipe and subbed neufchatel cheese (low fat cream cheese) and splenda.  The result was awful.  Also used low fat sour cream in the topping with splenda and that turned out ok.  I used "Barefoot Contessa's" lemon curd and it was just awful.  I will never purchase that brand again.  Anyways...all I'm saying is that this is just one of those recipes that does not adapt well to low fat ingredients.   A lot of pricey ingredients to waste on this experiment - just trying to save others from the same results.

This is good, but if you serve this to anyone with a wheat or gluten allergy, you must cheack the ingredients on the lemon topping, as many of them use a food starch, modified food starch, or wheat starch, which takes it out of the gluten free group.

One taste to review, another to "make sure," it's not what we were hoping for. I agree with "tulips*n*truffles" review. The texture is not creamy but thick and eggy, almost grainy. The flavor is a very unpleasant fake lemon from the lemon extract.  This could have benefited with just the vanilla extract alone (or even vanilla and real, fresh lemon juice) and two less eggs - one egg per package of cream cheese is always a good rule of thumb.  Moreover, there was too much of the sour cream topping for the amount of filling.   Very disappointing, since I had covered it with a homemade Meyer lemon curd which had really turned out beautifully.

Delicious.  My entire family loved it.  I added a graham cracker crust because I love the contrast with the sweet crust and the lemon.  Next time I think that I will add lemon just to the sour cream mixture and fresh lemon juice to the cream cheese mixture.

I'm one of those people who sees a poor review on a recipe and believes the cook must have done something wrong. :-( This time, however, I'm certain I followed the recipe to a "T" - and it is just not good! The texture of the cheesecake is just awful, and there's no real flavor - at all. Not rich or creamy or anything! I'll make this again only to see what I did wrong - but after this first attempt...ugh. Just not good! Sorry!

My aunt and three cousins have Celiac Disease.  Since I am usually the dessert maker for family functions I made this so they have a dessert they can eat too among the pies, cakes, and cookies they can't.  They love it, and are so happy every time I make it.  It's become a regular now that everyone enjoys.

Delicious!--with just a few changes:
Change to 3 pkg crm cheese & 3 eggs. Add juice and zest from one lemon--save some zest for on top. Add Graham cracker crust--brush on egg white and bake 5 min before filling.

I modified slightly by adding 1 additional pkg cream cheese and using 3 eggs.  Fabulous!!  I'll make this often.  I made my own lemon curd (recipes on allrecipes.com, of course) which is easy and quick.  Wonderful!

Simply awesome -- had my doubts about the "no crust" part, but I was pleasantly surprised and so were the rest of the people at dinner.  Simple, no fuss and tastes great -- a definate keeper.

Eggs are out of proportion to the other ingredients. The proportions I've found to work best are: for every 8 oz package of cream cheese add 1/4 C sugar, 1 egg & 1/2 tsp vanilla. For a ready made graham cracker crust use 2 & for a spring form pan cheesecake use 3 pkgs cream cheese. 
Also, the double topping of sour cream & sugar (powdered sugar works better) and lemon curd is just too much. One or the other please. Same with the 2 extracts.

Excellent cheesecake - guests loved it. 

I topped it with fresh raspberries instead of the lemon slices, and the flavours went nicely together.

I have made this several times, but each time after the baking, and during the cooling time. the cake seems to shrink to about half it's height.  Anybody know what I'm doing wrong, or is it supposed to do this.  It's still great.

I hate to be one of the people who changes a recipe and rates it, but after I saw other reviews, I changed this to 3 bars of cream cheese and 3 eggs, and it was perfect.  I topped it with fresh raspberries, and it was really good!

I thought this was really good. I made it for an Easter dinner and it was a huge hit. Texture-wise I will use one less egg next time. Definately making again.

Very good! Took this to a dinner party for a friend who is gluten free and the group loved it! My husband said he could have eaten the entire thing. It wasn't the best cheesecake I have ever had but definitely a recipe I will make again.

If you like lemon...this is for you. I did however put it in a graham cracker crust and it turned out great!
