Replaced  margarine with melted butter of same amount since I had none. Added nutmeg and clove spices, each 1/2 tsp. to  spice mixture which is what I use normally for gingerbread recipes. I will try doubling some of the spices next batch for I like baked gingerbread goods with a spicy bite. 
Otherwise perfect recipe as a base to make whatever you desire like the stuff mentioned in this recipe.
