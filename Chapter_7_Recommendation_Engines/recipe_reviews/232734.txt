My first review on this site, that tells you that I was very happy with the crisp.  It was delicious, served it with vanilla ice cream which was a real compliment to the tartness of the crisp. Perfect, wouldn't change a thing.

For some reason I have bad luck with crisps, but this one is different, so I thought I'd try it. Success!   I was skeptical about putting the crumbly part on the bottom, thinking it would just be soggy, but it wasn't. I made a little extra of the crumb mixture, to put on top, but really it didn't make much difference and next time I will skip doing that (I'm about to make it again because my husband loved it so much).  Great recipe. Thanks for posting.

Didn't have any white flour, so I used all purpose whole wheat flour with quick cooking oats.  Turned out delish!  The sweetness of the sugars are complemented nicely with the tartness of the fruit and the whole grain goodness.  So easy to assemble and tastes like summer.

This is the easiest, best recipe I have tried for this.  I didn't have fresh fruit so I made these substitutions:
4 cups of defrosted cubed frozen rhubarb that I squeezed the extra liquid out of.  Thawed 1lb bag of frozen unsweetened strawberries that I put in a strainer over a bowl to catch the juices and pressed lightly on the berries to extract more liquid.  I substituted some of the water for the berry juice.  Since I used frozen fruit and it had more moisture content, I increased the cornstarch by approx 1 tsp.  I substituted some of the sugars for sugar substitute (totally optional but I try to cut back where I can.)  I put about 1/3-1/2 of the crumb mixture on the bottom of the pan and the rest on top.  It came out awesome.  I was glad I put some foil under the pie pan because it bubbled over a bit.  It also baked in 45 mins at 350 in my electric oven.

This was simply delicious!   I served it warm, with vanilla ice cream. I baked it in a 9x13 pan instead of a 9" round, and I did make the optional topping, using the same ingredients as for the crust, but half the amount, mixed it loosely, then sprinkled over the fruit.  I'm keeping this one!

Delicious!  Added crumb topping from a handful of the crust.  Placed in  my recipe box, and I'm sure I will be making this again soon (like by the end of the week) during rhubarb season.

I've made this recipe twice now and I love it!  I was concerned when I first read it that the crust would get mushy with the fruit on top, but that is definitely not the case!  The crust is perfect.  I added some cinnamon to the crust (I rarely bake anything without cinnamon) and omitted the sugar/cornstarch mixture on top.  It was great without it.  I made it for 4th of July and put blueberries in the corner and piped in cream cheese icing for stripes to make it a flag.  For my cream cheese icing, I mixed cream cheese, raw honey, vanilla extract and cinnamon.  It was delicious!  I tried to attach a picture; hopefully it worked.

Too much for a 9-inch pie pan.Created a huge sticky mess in a hot oven. I would recommend changing the proportions (like half the water).

I was really disappointed in how this turned out.I did exactly what the recipe said to do and read all the reviews from others comments and so I was really looking forward in trying out this recipe.WOW what a disappointment-I love strawberry and rhubarb so I want to try out all kinds of crisp and for this being the first prize crisp I couldnt believe it as I had tried other crisps and they were 10 times better than this one.So I was totally disappointed as I was really expecting this to turn out fantastic!!!

This recipe was phenomenal! I followed it exactly except I used frozen rhubarb. (My store didn't have fresh). No need to thaw or squeeze just toss it in. So good! Definitely going to make this again and again! Thanks for posting!!

This is a great recipe for fresh strawberries and rhubarb - my husband moved it right up his list of favorites at first bite!!  I tried it once with frozen strawberries, and it was way too soupy.  But, I have substituted other fresh fruit for the strawberries and rhubarb (peaches and blueberries were one alternative), and it is a real keeper!

This dessert turned out perfect.  I added frozen blueberries and the strawberries were frozen as well (rhubarb was fresh) so I kind of worried it would not set, especially after one person's comment in the ratings that it was a mess and didn't set for them..  However, it set beautifully and was a hit after a summer BBQ .  Thank you!  I will be making it again this summer!

I should have used a larger deeper dish. Crust was too thick and juices overflowed onto cookie sheet. If I made it again I would increase white sugar to 3/4 cup. Strawberries and rhubarb were very tart.

I thought this was good. I will try it again but probably add a little more sugar to the syrup mixture next time. It was a very easy recipe, and I have rhubarb and strawberries from the garden to use up!

Made a few changes, doubling the crumb mixture, however would not double flour next time.  I must say I liked having the bottom crust and I did grease the pan first generously.  Also saved a bit of the oat mixture for the top. I used 6 cups of rhubarb, half of which had been frozen so did not add the recipe amt of water. Used 2 tbsp of corn starch, 1/2 brown sugar and may cook a little longer too.

I was skeptical that this recipe would turn out, but I was feeling in a risk-taking mood. Boy, am I glad I did. I served it a la mode with vanilla bean ice cream. It was delicious and got rave reviews by all 7 of our dinner companions.  I doubled the recipe and placed it in a 9x12 glass casserole dish. My fruit combo was a little different: fresh local apple combo, frozen strawberries, from-the-garden rhubarb (frozen). And, I used Kudzu instead of cornstarch as a thickening agent. I didn't thaw or rinse frozen fruit. I cooked it for the maximum time. When it came out of the oven it seemed a tad liquidy. Once it cooled and was time to serve, it was fine. We will definitely make it again.

The strawberry rhubarb topping was good but the crust was so hard and stuck to the bottom of the pan that I could not get it out of the pie plate.

I added a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg to both filling and crust. I used a large glass pie plate with fluted edges so no problems with spillage. However, it was very difficult removing portions from the baking dish. Next time I'll try buttering the dish before I press in the "crunch" pie crust!

Very good, and a nice change from the regular type of fruit crumble.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I was a 1/2 cup short on the rhubarb.  I used a 9" glass pie dish, and had no trouble with boiling over.  My husband loved it, and finished it off the second day.  That's a high compliment from a guy who usually only wants chocolate.

Yes I will make again! It was delicious and so easy to make. I think maybe next time I'll use a bigger dish so it will get crispier as I only used an 8x8 pan. Great recipe!

This was amazing (the pie filling). I used a stoer bought pie crust and a crumble topping from this site adding walnuts to the topping. Awesome!

What amount of strawberries are used in this recipe?  I don't  see them listed in the ingredients.  I only rated 3 stars because of this.  I have not yet made this recipe.  If someone can tell me, I would greatly appreciate it so I can try to make this.  Thank you.  Uh... never mind.  I found it. 2c. strawberries.

Very easy to make and absolutely delicious. Note that it is easy to adjust the tart/sweet flavors by adjusting the ratio of rhubarb to strawberries.  
We like 3 cups rhubarb to 1 cup strawberries. It is a great contrast to the sweetness of ice cream!!

It was very bland. Not as good as a crisp recipe with the bottom on the top. The fruit mixture was very flat.

Delicious, made it for a friends bbq -everyone raved! I too, like another reviewer, saved back a couple of tbsps. of crust for sprinkling on the top.

Horrible mess in my oven. A 9x13 pan would be more realistic.

This recipe is great! My 12 year old son asks for it over and over. The "topping" on the bottom is a great surprise but it can be hard to get through but sooo worth it!

This turned out great. I added a bit of cinnamon to the crust and I liked the results. Thanks for the recipe!
