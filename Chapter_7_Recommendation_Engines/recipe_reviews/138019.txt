I absolutely love Sidecars - they are best when served with a sugar-rim!

Wonderful recipe! If you like a sweeter drink, then add a packet of Splenda before shaking.

dangerously delicious!  I served this at a party and my girlfriends and I loved it! Boy, do these ever go down smoothly!   I didn't think to tell them that there was quite a bit of brandy in the drinks and although they were very happy at the party, they told me they were not feeling so happy the next morning.

Very good recipe.  Sugar the rim would make it 5 stars!
