I was extremely disappointed in this recipe.  I served it for Christmas dinner and only one child liked it.  I ended up throwing most of it away.  I think that if I'd stopped after tossing the fruit into the cooked dressing, it would've been fine.  However, the whipped cream made it way too creamy. If you use marshmallows, I would advise cutting the amount in half at least. The whipped cream and the marshmallows totally overpowered the fruit. I will try it again, just using the cooked dressing and tossing in the fruit.

This was not a big hit with my family.  They did not care for the Poppy seeds

I don't know what I did right (or wrong!), but I'm pretty sure I followed the directions and it came out way better than the other reviewers say. I brought it to a bbq and EVERYONE loved it - kids, adults, my picky husband, and me.  My husband just asked me the other day if I would make it again just for him.

Thank you, Tami for submitting this.
I left my family recipe at home so I checked here - I'm sure that there are other names for it but I've always known it as 24 Hour Salad. However, mine is a bit different, I melt the marshmallows in the egg mix because it helps thicken the salad overall and many people are not fond of the texture of marshmallows. I added a bit more than it calls for as I go by taste.
No poppy seeds in mine! I also used a bit more whipping cream as well (maybe a quarter cup extra). Be extra careful when folding in the whipped cream to the rest of it or it can become sloppy. 
This is a hit every time.

With the recommendations listed above, this turned out to be delicious.  I skimped a little on the whipped cream and marshmellows.  I did not add the poppy seeds and I forgot the bananas too (although that was a mistake).  The marshmellows got nice and and plump.  I have learned with other marshmellow salads that cheaper store brand marshmellows don't plump up; gotta get name brand for this salad.  I will make it again.

This fruit salad has been a holiday staple in my family ever since I can remember.  It's wonderful!  The only reason I did not give it five stars is that I do remember not liking it as a child.  (Although my child absolutely loves it!)  As an adult,however, I adore it!  I will say that you must love creamy desserts to enjoy it, but apparently that's not a problem for our family!

My family has used this as a holiday dish for years.  We don't use poppyseeds, but feel free to use all fresh fruit and add the banana with the rest of the fruit.

I was so happy to find a recipe very close to the "24 hour salad" my mom and grandmother made for every holiday when I was growing up. It's kinda like a little dessert on your dinner plate. :) I had their recipe at one time, but lost it, sadly.  Don't add poppy seeds -- they don't fit this salad. Do be careful when folding in the whipped cream and fruit - just FOLD in slowly., and make sure whatever canned fruit you're adding is very well drained, otherwise it will get soupy. Add the sliced bananas (needs 2 bananas) right before serving per the instructions, so they stay firm.
