Great taste, but took off a star since the Bisquick mixture had a hard time sticking to the chicken. Next time I think I'd first dip the chicken in a mix of egg and milk.

Great recipe that's easy to modify.  I lined the dish with foil first - no mess at all to clean up.  I used bonelss chicken breast, omitted the salt and used flour, pepper, Mrs. Dash original and Mrs. Dash tomato/basil/garlic and paprika.  Wonderful & tender - better than fried!

Absolutely delicious!! I love crunchy, tasty skin on my chicken, and this recipe was perfect for it. I will be making this again and again.

GREAT recipe.  I actually used Jiffy Corn Muffin Mix instead of Bisquick and it gave it a sweet and salty flavor that was out of this world!  My husband and daughter LOVED it!  We'll use this one again . . . and again . . . and again . . .

This recipe is just OK.  I used chicken breasts, so I had to watch them carefully since it gets drier than chicken on the bone.  I really prefer coating my baked chicken with crushed cornflakes.  I didn't have any, and thought I'd give this a try.  I'll go back to the crushed cornflakes.

This recipe has changed my life. The reason this works so well and turns out like fried chicken is because of the fat in the mix. Do yourself a favor while you have the Bisquick out and make some biscuits; just stick them in the oven during the last 10-12 minutes of the chicken cooking.

Good recipe.  I used low fat bisquick alond with Emerils Essence.  Additionally, I used split chicken breasts intead of a whole cut up chicken.  The time and temperature were right on.  The chicken could have used some sort of dipping sauce but overall it was very good.

This was a very good, easy recipe.  I used chicken leg quarters for it.  The mixture didn't stick to the chicken very well; I'll probably use egg next time.  But it still turned out very tasty!

Really easy to make and delicious. The chicken was tender and very juicy. I used the suggestions from others about dipping the chicken in egg before the Bisquick mix, I also didn't use the salt in the mixture but I did sprinkle a little on each chicken breast. Will make again, very tasty.

My family loved it!    I dipped the chicken in a egg & milk mixture prior to dipping in flour mix (I did add a little Dash to flour mixture).  I bought a pack of thighs instead of a whole chicken ....the meat stays really moist and fits in pan equally.   I lined my pan with tin foil....easy & quick clean up!

I hesitate to review this because I was out of bisquick & just used flour but....I added lawry's just because I like it in chicken seasonings. We really enjoyed this! I was looking for something to entice my kids to eat some random chicken legs I had in the freezer. This did the trick for 2 out of 3 kiddos :) I had 6 chicken legs & halved the ingredients but used 3 tbl of butter in a 9x9 pan & it worked perfectly. No sticking & tasted wonderful! I'll be using this recipe again!

This recipe has become one of favorite go to recipes!  I make it every few months.  I love it because it is so easy and I usually have all of the ingredients on hand. sometimes I will just use regular flour if I don't have bisquick. I'll add a few of my own house spices and a little more butter than the recipe calls for. it is so good and tasty even as leftovers.

Have made this several times and it comes out great! On occasion I've tinkered with the seasoning, but last night my husband made it strictly following the recipe, but using only drumsticks, and we were in chicken heaven. He likes that it's easy. I'd give it 5 stars my husband 4, so consider this 4.5 stars.

I make this recipe all the time and it turns out nice and crunchy. I usually just use chicken thighs. It makes a  delicious BBQ chicken if you add your favorite sauce towards the end of cooking time. You may need to use a spatula to get under the chicken and turn it so none of it sticks to the baking pan.

So easy. And as always, how you season the mix is up to you. But my rating is mostly about the simplicity of the recipe and how tender it turned out. Great weeknight recipe.

We just finished dinner and I must say this was terrific! From door to dinner table just just over an hour. The coating was crispy and the meat was tender and juicy. I also used split breasts and cut those in half as well. I stayed with the temperature and mine was done in 55 min. No way could you substitute pancake mix - Bisquick is a baking mix. Also pay attention to placing the coated chicken in hot melted butter in a hot pan - it will sizzle. You can't go wrong if you follow the directions as given.

I love this recipe!!! The chicken was crispy on the out side and juicy in the middle. It tasted just like fried chicken and it was not all greasy. I can't fry chicken, it comes out soggy.

Beautiful color when done.  The bisquick coating is wonderful.  Added a tap of cayenne pepper for a little extra zest.

Been making Bisquick Chicken for about 20 years, had to go to internet because they took the recipe off the side of the Bisquick box. This is my go to chicken recipe, couldn’t be any easier, if the butter is hot then clean up is a breeze especially if you use a glass pan.

I did make some changes to the recipe. I used a trick that I do on spare ribs. I coated the chicken with mustard before using the Bisquick this allows it to stick better you don't taste the mustard after cooking also I used more garlic and added some red pepper flakes

I love this recipe. As other reviewers said, the mixture doesn’t really stick to the chicken on its own. I use cooking spray to coat the chicken before coating it and that works really well. The first time I made this, I realized I only had pancake/waffle mix (not regular Bisquik). I was feeling lazy so I just used the pancake mix and OMG it was delicious! It adds a sweetness, almost reminiscent of chicken and waffles. I have only used the pancake mix when making this recipe, it’s so good I think I would miss the sweetness if I just used plain Bisquik.

Really good and easy! I put the chicken pieces and flour mixture in a container and shook it. It coated and stuck to the chicken throughout the baking really well. We have some vegetarians and some meat eaters so dredged tofu in the flour mixture and copied the baking just as the chicken. Will definitely make again and highly reccomend!

I made this chicken today. This was very easy and very good. I followed the recipe with one exception. I used a garlic pepper mixture instead of just pepper. My daughter and granddaughter thought it was great. So I will make this again. 

Thanks for a great recipe.

I have tried several baked chicken recipes and this one is the best one by far!! My husband LOVED it. The only thing I did different was I used skinless boneless chicken thighs and cut down the times to 30 mins, then turned them, then another 10 mins. They were perfectly crispy and juicy. Delicious!!

I used 2 large breasts (about 1.3 lbs total) and put it in a 9x9 pan.  I used all the same amounts, but I also added a 1/4 tsp of garlic powder and chopped up 1 tbsp of fresh Italian herbs from my garden.   Be careful because it cooks much faster.  I did 30 minutes at 400 degrees flipping them after 20 minutes.  Next time I'll shave 3 or 4 minutes off.  My wife loved it!

Very yummy.  My chicken stuck to the pan a bit and the skin came off when I flipped it.  Otherwise followed the recipe as directed and really enjoyed it!

this was just OK.  Not very flavorful,but moist enough.  I had to bake it a little longer to get it to the right temp.  I'll keep searching for the perfect recipe.

This is the only way I will "fry" chicken from now on. It's tasty & delicious, and I don't have to deal with the oily mess/oil splatters that the task of frying chicken usually comes with.

Out of Bisquick, so I used 3/4 c flour, 1-1/2 t baking powder, 1/2 t seasoned salt, 1/2 t salt, 1/2 t freshly ground black pepper, and 1/2 t garlic powder. Put thinly  sliced Vidalia onion and thinly sliced lemon on each piece. Made it 2nd time with 2 T butter so I could baste it during last 15 minutes. Husband wanted BBQ, so added BBQ sauce. In shiny pan had to cook extra 7 minutes at end. Even better reheated in oven about 15 minutes next day. Family loved it.

This is really quick and good.  I'd cut the heat to 400, though. Gets done pretty fast, at least when using chicken thighs . Honey loves it. Cheers.

I love this recipe.  My mother made it years ago.  She baked the chicken and then pushed it down to one end of the pan, made drop biscuits and put peach halves with cloves on the chicken.  When the biscuits are done you have a delicious dinner.

I added a few more spices. Really wanted this to work since frying is so messy. But the breading would not crisp up on meat bigger than a drumstick. Soggy spots.

Highly disappointed with this recipe. I followed the instructions but used 3 large boneless/skinless chicken breasts. The coating stuck very well to the chicken, but it did not brown at all, the taste was absolutely bland, and cook time was waaaaay off. The chicken was actually done and very moist in 25 minutes, but I had yet to flip it over to "brown" the other side, causing me to have one side coated in soggy pancake mix and the other side caked with still-dried mix. ..... Simply awful.

This a delicious recipe and so easy.  I did use an egg wash to help the bisquick and seasoning stick.  It's a keeper!!!

This chicken dish was flavorful and the coating was crispy and delicious!!!! I read that one person said he/she had trouble with the Bisquick mixture sticking. I blended all the dry ingredients in a large plastic bag and put two pieces of chicken at a time into the bag and shook the bag until the pieces were well coated. I had no problem using this method with the coating not sticking! Each piece was evenly coated as well!

I have made and do a few modifications.  I use a 10 pak or family pak of chix thighs.  Ten fit nicely in a 13x9 glass pan. I rinse the chix in water just prior to seasoning, the seasoning sticks, without,  it does not stick.  I add other spices - to my liking so add you lemon pepper, or BBQ seasoning.  What ever your pleasure.  A few folks are watching their calories, so I feed the skin to the dogs.  Great Base Recipe TO LIGHTLY MODIFY!

I've been making this recipe off and on over the last few years.  The recipe has been on the back of the Bisquick box forever.  Chicken turns out perfect every time and I never have any trouble getting the mixture to stick to the chicken.  I put the ingredients in a plastic bag to mix them up and then I put a piece or two of chicken in at a time and shake.  I tend to use garlic salt vs. regular salt and also season salt.

So good! Great cooking directions. The hot temperature gives a nice crust and juicy inside. I used Rosemary "LiveGFree" gluten free crackers and some season salt to make it gluten free. Dipped chicken in egg then cracker which I turned to crumbs in food processor.

I used two tablespoons of Olive oil instead of butter. Also added a bit of garlic power and savory seasoning.  It was a good tasting recipe and not too much work to prepare and cook. One observation, the bisquick would pull away from the chicken and much of it stayed in the bottom of the pan after being cooked.  I wonder if flour would do the same  thing or if perhaps eggs and milk would make it stick better.

It was pretty good... I would definitely recommend seasoning the chicken BEFORE coating with the pancake mix. Also, if possible, place chicken on a rack when backing so air circulates and all sides cook evenly

The recipe should say Oven-Baked Fried Chicken. I was looking for a baked chicken recipe just for something different. I didn't feel like further researching when I reached the Bisquick step.  It's actually delicious. A new quick way to fry chicken. Make the coating ahead of time and the kids could actually do it. Fried chicken in no time. Those winger yes would be perfect. Next time I'll try tossing some wingers in some buffalo sauce.

I made this tonight for Wednesday Chicken Dinner night. It was delicious and juicy. The only thing that I changed was that I soaked my chicken in buttermilk for eight hours, rinsed and patted it dry before breading it. My husband always loved his grandma's oven fried chicken but I could never duplicate it, until now! I think the key is to put the chicken in the preheated pan with the melted butter. I had chicken legs because that's what was on sale. Eight chicken legs for $1.79  was quite a deal! I'll be doing this again and again, with my husband's encouragement!

I took the advice of a reviewer before me and mixed an egg with some milk to help the coating stick. Otherwise I made it by the recipe. The most important thing for me is does my family like it and will they ask for it again. The answer to both was YES!
Great taste, easy to make.

Not bad, always experimenting to make a recipe better.  This recipe is a good starting point.

Like a few others I like using the split chicken breasts.  Something I started doing a few years ago makes sure I never have dry white meat again and I thought I'd share it.  I always brine my chicken before cooking.  It's also an opportunity to infuse some flavors into the chicken itself, not just on the outside like a fry coating.  Just some kosher salt, water and whatever spices I feel like.  For chicken you don't really need very long but I am pretty lazy and usually leave it in the fridge overnight.  Hope this helps.

I used chicken drumsticks instead of whole chicken and I don't like the taste of paprika so I used basic chicken seasoning with onion and garlic powder. I also used Aunt Jemima pancake mix and the chicken was decent. I'm in college and it was a easy 123 step recipe for me and my roommate. Before adding the coating I recommend  beating an egg and coating the chicken with that before adding the flour mixture. Overall it was pretty good.

This was easy and very good! I love chicken just about any way you can make it. This was a little bland...not sure what it was missing for me. Next I will just experiment with some additional seasonings.

We love this, I make this every couple of weeks. I do dip the chicken in buttermilk before the bisquick.  You can vary the seasonings, we use a bit of chipotle chilie for a little kick.  Taste just like fried, only better for you.

This was a hit! I gave it 4 stars, because I did alter a little bit: I read other reviews that it was a bit bland so I substituted the salt for Lowery's seasoned salt 1 teaspoon and increased the pepper to 1 teaspoon.   Chicken was tender and the skin was crispy and yummy. You could probably decrease the amt. of butter and still be fine.

I made this recipe for my son who loves "chicken he can pick up." This five year old doesn't like spicy food so it was perfect for him. I did add a little dried minced garlic to the breading to zip it up a bit. I also found it hard to make the coating stick so I dipped my chicken in milk prior to placing it in the pan. Otherwise, the recipe worked very well. I served it with leek and potato gratin and fresh broccoli for a warm winter dinner.

An interesting texture and a lot healthier than deep fried, I still wont be making again.  I added a 1/4 tsp red pepper and it still wasn't very flavorful. We ended up dipping in hot wing sauce. Used 2 8in square glass pans w 1/2 tbls butter each, could've cut that in half.

Very simple, easy and delicious.  I added some garlic powder, and put 4 large bone-in breasts in a jelly roll pan.  They turned out perfect.

i only had Krusteaz pancake mix, and I think I'll blame the saltiness on that. My husband didn't like the paprika flavor, but I enjoyed it. Just a little too salty for me (which is rare, since I love my salt!!). I think if I try this again I'll definitely wait until I have Bisquick.

Fried Chicken flavor less fat. This is an interesting technique for creating crispiness. I used chicken breast and therefore cooked for less time.

Very good! I wouldn't have thought to use Bisquick to coat chicken, but it was a very nice surprise.
