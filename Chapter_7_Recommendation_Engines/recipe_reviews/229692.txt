If you like your sweet potatoes sugary and cinnamon-y this is recipe for you... my daughter and I do so we liked it but more so without the marshmallows.  *I did reduce the serving size to 2 to make the recipe... my boys do not like sweet potatoes and I didn't need 10 servings.*

Followed the recipe exact...
I could not give this more than three stars. It was way too sweet (and I have a LOVE for all things sweet!), and had an almost inedible amount of cinnamon. Next time I will be cutting the white sugar and cinnamon down by at least half! Other than that the recipe was good.

Cinnamon overkill and to sweet. Yikes. I made this recipe the first time exactly as directed. Never again. Even my sweet potato casserole addicted husband didn't like it.

The next time I cut the white sugar to 1/2c, the brown sugar to 1/4c, the cinnamon to 1/2T, and added 1t nutmeg. Much better. Oh, and I baked the sweet potatoes instead of boiling. Much easier to peel and give the end result is less dense.

I used one cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup sugar because I love brown sugar.  Also used regular marshmallows.  Came out great!

This was the first time in all my cooking years that I did this myself.  I followed the directions... (so easy)!  The only thing I changed was the sugar. I did not use any of the sugar in the recipe. What I used was Organic Blue Agave (abt. 2tbs). I do not use regular sugar anymore, and this is an excellent replacement, also low fat/low sodium margarine.  Everything else I followed to the recipe. Everybody LOVED IT!...so did I! Love your recipes, they are really so easy!..

I agree with the majority of reviews it was very sweet. But was excellent the 2nd day.  I think it's one if those recipes that taste better the 2nd day.

I reduced the sugar to two tablespoons, but kept all other ingredients the same.   Everyone liked it! I'll definitely make it again.

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it... I did take advice from other reviews & only added 1 tablespoon of cinnamon & only 2 tablespoons of white sugar. It was perfect, will make it again next year!

Funny enough, I added extra cinnamon, left out the white sugar, so so good, I didn't have marshmallows so I used pecans oats and brown sugar on the top....I may not share. I gave 4 because I think I can tweak it and make it even better.

As I was adding the sugars & cinnamon to the potatoes I decided to stop after adding half for what this recipe called for. Thankful I did! Even with half it was still pretty rich, especially with the marshmallow!
