This recipe was incredibly easy and a HUGE hit with my family.  I was in a hurry so I didn't measure most of the ingredients exactly- I eyeballed some.  It was DELICIOUS- by far the best dip of this kind I've ever tasted.  My family aren't dip eaters but there was none left.

Excellent!  Made a small change after reading the reviews. Used only 1/2 cup miracle whip and 1/2 cup of mayo.  Otherwise, followed the directions.    It was delicious.  We LOVED it!

We tried this out last night--Delicious!  Simple to put together and very, very tasty.  I might try a little less dressing and a little more cheese next time, but my husband said it was perfect as-is (we followed the recipe to the letter.) Thanks for the great new favorite!

I had been looking a long time for a good recipe for and Artichoke Dip and came upon this one and boy was I lucky. It is really good and easy to make. I made this to take to work and everyone loved it. Needless to say everyone wanted the recipe. I did make it twice the second time I omitted the Miracle Whip and used Cream Of Mushroom soup. Still tasted great. Will continue to use this recipe.

I made this recipe in my lilttle slow cooker so I could keep it warm during a party. By the end of the night it was all gone, that always makes me happy. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent recipe! I added a bit more cheese than the original recipe... I added an extra cup of Muenster, some Pepper Jack and some Cheddar. Instead of the Miracle Whip, I used Ranch Dressing.  Came out fantastic!  (I had to be the first to add a photo!!)  Thanks for the recipe.

Way too much mayo/miracle whip in this recipe.  It overpowered the artichoke, spinach and cheeses. Sorry, I've had much better.

I made this as written and it did not go over very well.  Had an odd taste.  I think it was the Miracle Whip.  Will not make again.

My daughter loves spinach artichoke dip, so I thought I'd try this recipe.  She loved it.  I personally like a little less spinach and a little more cheese, but that is just my personal taste and it can be easily doctored.  Think the next time I make it I will also put it in a bread bowl.  Will definitely make again!

This is AWESOME dip and really easy to make too!  If a guy that is all thumbs in the kitchen can make it for his wife and she REALLY LOVES IT, then you know it is good and easy to make!  Thank you so much for posting it!

A HUGE hit!  Everytime this is served, I'm asked for the recipe!  A few cloves of fresh-pressed garlic is also a nice addition....

This recipe is "amazing".  I also used half the amount of miracle whip and mayonaise.  It turned out perfect.

We did this dip for my husband's graduation and received rave reviews.  It was easy to prepare and very tasty.  I was asked by so many people for the recipe, it was amazing.

Didn't change anything, used ranch dressing. The best tasting artichoke and spinach dip ever. Better than any restaurant.

I left/switched out some of the cheeses and left out the miracle whip. I used diced red onion instead of the regular onion since it was all I had on hand. Also didn't have any artichoke so I left it out hoping it would turn out okay. It was AMAZING! I also added a little red hot (so the dip was barely pink) before baking and it added a bunch of flavor without being spicy.

pretty good. I used only mayo and not quite as much as it called for. I put it in a little slow cooker to heat it slowly and then it kept warm during a party.

This recipe was fantastic and a big hit at my party. Everyone wanted a copy of it.I did add Gruyere cheese -1/2 cup and hot sauce 1/4 teaspoon in addition to this recipe. It added an additional richness and spark of spicy that was to die for.

this was delicious and a hit! When I was first mixing it together I thought it was too much spinach but it wasn't. I did add some extra spices and did not use any romano.

I made this for the first time over a year ago for a  birthday party.  It was gone with in a half hour!  It is so good.  I get requests for almost any get together, and it will be a part of our Thanksgiving tomorrow.
