MY OPINION: Ditch the corn flakes and substitute crushed vanilla wafers and you'll like this MUCH better. Also... Use peanut oil instead of veggie oil since it has about a 50 degree higher flash point and you can fry these babies quicker at higher temp for less ice cream melt.

This was one of the best desserts I have ever made. I made "bowls" out of small flour tortillas by pushing the centers of them slightly down into muffin tins and spacing them out so they weren't touching. Then I sprayed them with cooking spray, and baked them in a 350 degree oven for about 10 minutes (when the edges started to brown). They held their shape and didn't crack. We enjoyed eating "the bowls" as much as the ice cream! I topped them with caramel sauce, whipped cream and a cherry. I will make this very often!

I looked and looked for this recipe.  Thanks for making it available.  I served this at a Tex-Mex dinner party, I must say it was a hit! However instead of plain Cornflakes I used Honey & Nut Cornflakes and tripled the amount of cinnamon.  I put the Cornflakes in a blender to crush them, (only took a few mintues).  I served it on a tortillas that were brushed with melted butter on each side, warmed in frying pan and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar.  Then I topped it all will Carmel and/or Butterscotch Topping.  Delicious!!! Best Desset I've had in a long time.

Since I moved to a small town, I haven't been able to get true fried ice cream. The Mexican restaurants here simply roll the ice cream in corn flakes. This recipe was so EASY and exactly as I remember real fried ice cream. I have been searching for this recipe and I am SO glad it was submitted! I do have one suggestion, though: buy the box of corn flake crumbs (it's next to bread crumbs in the grocery store). The crumbs are so much finer than you could make at home, and it makes a much better coating. I did dip the ice cream twice - you must have a really good coating for it to fry right. I will make this again and again and again......THANK YOU!!!

*** Crush the corn flakes in a blender and substitute about 1/3 volume with CRUSHED VANILLA WAFERS. It makes this 10 times better!

I enjoy fried ice cream very much. It is one of my favorite desserts. Although this recipe is very similar to what you would get at a Mexican restaurant, I've found a way to make this dessert without frying it and with much more flavor. In a medium heat skillet, I combine 1/4 cup butter, 1/3 cup flaked sweetened coconut, 1/3 cup chopped pecans, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon and 1/2 cup flour. I stir everything until crumbly and golden brown. Then, I let it all cool down. I make the ice cream balls and roll them in the crumbly mixture and put them in the freezer covered until ready to serve. Then, I drizzle them with honey. I think this way is easier and has a lot more flavor.

This is a great recipe!  I have had fried ice cream several times at a tex-mex restaurant and have been looking for a recipe that is like theirs'.  I've found it!  I recommend rolling the ice cream balls in the crushed flakes twice.  I also find it easier to form the balls the evening before and freeze them overnight before you roll them in coating.  My husband has never had fried ice cream and loved this!!  5 Stars!

Delicious! I've tried making fried ice cream so many times, and this recipe has turned out the best! Very simple, just make sure you let it all freeze for a long time - it makes all the difference! My hubby swoons over this dessert - thank you!!

Try using Cinnamon Toast Crunch Cereal instead of Corn Flakes.   Also, the reason why it fell apart for some people was because you didn't freeze the ice cream long enough.  The best way to make fried ice cream is to prepare it the day before you plan on frying it.  This way your cereal coated ice cream balls are nice and frozen.  Also do the egg dip/cereal dip thing twice.  Here is how it should be done: 1.  Freeze the plain ice cream balls for 1-2 hours. 2.  Dip in non-whipped beaten egg and roll in the cereal/cinnamon mixture.  The freeze for 1-2 hours. 3.  Dip in the beaten egg again and roll in the cereal/cinnamon mixture again and freeze for several hours (overnight is good) 4.  Deep fry the cereal coated ice cream balls for 5 - 10 seconds.   5.  Drizzle with honey and chocolate syrup.  Top with whipped cream and a cherry.

Yummy.  We fried tortillas, sprinkled them with cinammon & sugar, then served the ice cream on top with honey & fresh whipped cream.  A real treat, especially after making the tequilla lime chicken.

I had this great dessert about a million years ago while entertaining a client. I've always wondered how this was done and was thrilled to find the recipe. We used various flavors of ice cream and also skipped the middle step. Working quickly, we shaped our ice cream balls and then proceded with the dipping process. We then froze them for several hours as they really need to be rock hard before frying. My daughter made a suggestion to use pancake batter in lieu of the egg white. Next time we'll give it a try. Thanks so much Jeri for a really terrific and easy recipe!

I use honey instead of egg whites and double the cinnamon, then put them back in the freezer.   Coat the firmly frozen ice cream ball in honey, then roll in the corn flake/cinnamon mixture and put back in the freezer.  No need to fry. That cuts down on the mess and the need to serve immediately.

This is restaurant quality.  A couple changes here. I used Rice Crispies cereal instead of corn flakes and used chocolate ice cream instead of vanilla.  These are just what I had on hand and they worked perfectly.  I let this chill overnight and it was perfectly whole.  I went for the max amount of seconds, 15, and its way too much.  I found that it should be 10, if that, so that is the only difference I'm making next time. Also, I did no measurements.  Just poured plenty of cereal in a ziploc bag, sealed out the air and crushed with my hands til it was fine and sprinkled the cinnamon after frying.  Like anything being fried, I find that double or triple coating helps maintain consistency.  Last thing...a reviewer advised to chill after frying.  You should opt for this if you want a more firm ice cream but if you want it warm and slightly melted, eat immediately. It's good either way. Feel free to experiment as well! This was lots of fun and very yummy :D.  Update 10/20/09: 2 coats and 10 seconds cooks these babies to perfection and doesn't melt your ice cream.  Also make sure your egg is beaten well otherwise its a gloppy mess.  I will definitely be making these again and again, ty!

I used half corn flakes & half vanilla wafers & I did crush it in my food processor. I only made 4 balls & I froze my plate before scooping the ice cream into balls. That way, when you add the balls, the cold plate keeps them from softening for a couple of minutes. If you follow the directions & heat the oil up as specified, only fry one ball at a time (the coating came off when I tried to do two but I was using a small saucepan) & only fry for a few seconds ...they'll come out perfectly. Like JENNIFER72_00 , I made tortilla bowls but I sprinkled them w/ cinnamon sugar before baking. I drizzled them w/ white chocolate syrup, caramel syrup & toasted coconut after placing in the "bowls" & then garnished w/ whipped cream & a cherry. Lovely presentation & fantastic taste...was the perfect finish to a Mexican meal. Thanks for the recipe!

I'm not rating this only because it was my mess up.  This is by far my biggest flop of a recipe.  You need your freezer on suppppperrrrr cold setting.  The ice cream never hardened enough.  When I touched them to roll they melted almost instantly.  I coated twice quickly but it was a disaster!  I even froze them before rolling for almost a full 24 hours.  Moral of my ranting, deep freeze or coldest setting.  I will try again.

This was an excellent recipe--it tastes just like the fried ice cream at one of my favorite restaurants.  I made this for a casual dinner party, and put hot fudge and whipped cream on top.  Everyone raved about it.  I added a lot more cinnamon than the recipe called for, though, because I didn't feel that the stated amount was enough.  Although somewhat time consuming, I didn't think this was particularly difficult.  I agree that the scoops of ice cream are easily shaped into a ball when you are rolling them in the coating.  Also, the frying times turned out to be more like 5 to 10 seconds for me.  I will definitely make this again!

Loved this! Mine came out perfect tasting. Put a little more cinnamon than called for. Also made a tortilla bowl for the icecream.. In a small bowl, combine sugar and cinnamon. Coat one side of each tortilla with cooking spray; sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar. Turn tortillas over; repeat on the other side. Cut each tortilla into four wedges.

I used Bryers Natural Vanilla and got 16 balls out of it; and used Total Honey Nut Crunch instead of CornFlakes to give the crust a little more of a sweet taste. I also found that freezing the balls after frying was better because they don't pop out of the shell when refrozen!

I have never done fried icecream before so I was very happy to find this recipe - I let the balls set for several days before we fried them last night.  They came out good and I will make them again.  I will give four stars - only because they were not quite as good as the ones I have had when out to eat.  
As others suggested -  I trippled the cinn. and I also added some coconut

Absolutely delicious!  I've been searching for this recipe for so long as this is one of my favorite desserts.  Very easy to make, just a little time consuming.  I would say you only need about 1/2 the amount of crumbs listed and increase the cinnamon as you can barely taste it.  Definitely top it off with honey and whipped cream.  Your company will be very impressed!

This recipe is not for the   " lets make it now"... type of people.  Time is of the essence... the more you freeze and re-freeze the ice cream balls......the better they come out.. (less time to un-freeze - (if that's a real word.....lol)...
If you have the day before to prepare... they will surely come out much better...
Enjoy!!! 
PS
make sure your oil is really really HOT!!! And use a splatter screen to save your skin...!!!!

WOW!!! This is one good dessert. I've heard of this but never had it before and let me tell you it is good! I used Honey Nut Cereal instead of cornflakes because that's what we had and I omitted the cinnamon cause I'm not a very big fan of it. I've made it twice already, once with the egg white and once with light corn syrup. No difference at all. Also, as some other reviews suggested, I crushed the cereal in my processor. I had it topped with Sue's Hot Fudge Sauce (also found on this site) and I was  in heaven! Thanks for the great post!

This is one of my favorite desserts at one of the restaurants that we frequent.  I was a bit hesitant to make this...frying icecream.  I could really mess that one up.  It was amazing.  It wasn't as good as it is when I go to the restaurant...but much cheaper and I can have as much as I want.  It will definately work for me.  Thanks for the post.

I never had eaten or made this before, but it sounded delicious, so I had to try it- and I'm glad I did! Its amazing how simple ingredients turn out such a fine dessert. I gave mine a beautiful look by swirling carmel and honey over it. Will make again!

Served on top of homemade tortillas (sprayed with Pam, baked at 350 degrees for 10 min as suggested in another's review, and sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar), drizzled with chocolate or caramel syrup and topped with whipped cream and a cherry.  YUM!

Wonderful recipe!  I stuck the frozen ice cream balls on wax paper in my freezer instead of using a cookie sheet, and also substituted frosted flakes for corn flakes....the end result....fabulous!!

Haven't tried this recipe yet but it's almost exactly as to how we used to make it in a mexican restaurant I worked at (we just didn't use the eggs).  For a chocolate twist add some crushed orea cookies :)

Just like the dessert at Mexican Fiesta restaurant!  As reviewers suggested, I used 1/2 corn flake crumbs and 1/2 crushed Nilla Wafers, and did double the cinnamon.  Coated them twice.  Superb!!  Serve with a little hot fudge and Cool Whip... amazing!!  A+  Thanks for the recipe!

These are good, but it is so much easier to use finely crushed cinnamon toast crunch cereal, and roll the frozen ice cream balls in the cereal, then wrap in saran wrap and stick back in freezer for at least 2 hours, then there you go. Its delicious!!!!!

Loved this.  Crushed Frosted Flakes in blender with cinnamon.  Coated the ice cream twice for a thicker crust.  Served over tortillas that i heated in a pan with butter and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar.  Drizzled hot caramel over the top and whipped cream.

The only difference I made was using crushed graham cracker crumbs! That is how the Mexican restaurant in my home town made them!  Drizzled with honey and topped with whipped cream!

This was the dessert I served at the end of a Mexican themed dinner party.  My husband of 8 years proudly exclaimed that it his new favorite dessert recipe of mine.  My guest were very intrigued by the thought of frying ice cream. Everyone loved it.  The hardest part was scooping the ice cream fast enough that they didn't all melt. These are tips to make your fried ice cream a hit.  Line a cookie sheet to freeze the scoops on.  Make sure you have room in your freezer before scooping the ice cream.  Use a bag to toss them in the cornflakes instead of a bowl.  You can do steps 1 and 2 the day before you plan on frying them.  Have a well organized "fry station" set up and don't take the ice cream scoops out until the oil is hot enough (make sure it is at 375).  Don't forget the honey, whipped cream and the cherry.  Serve this quickly and proudly and you will be the dessert queen/king.

Absolutely YUMMY!!  Definitely 5 stars.  I was terrified to make this recipe at first, but it is so easy!  I followed everyone's advice and added a lot more cinnamon--4 times the amount called for to be exact.  Be sure to keep the balls in a deep freeze if you have one and only fry them for 10-12 seconds at the most.  Also, the first time I used crushed cornflakes and the second time I decided to grind them to finer crumbs.  I liked it that way better.

I WAS SOOO AFRAID TO MAKE THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME. BUT THIS IS EASY! A FRIEND AND I MADE IT FOR A DINNER PARTY AND EVERYONE LOVED IT. WE ADDED CARMEL AND CHOCOLATE SAUCE TO TOP IT OFF AND IT WAS WONDERFUL. WE WILL BE MAKING THIS FOR MORE OF OUR PARTIES.

I used coffee ice cream and coated it with
2 layers of corn flakes using 2 tsp. cinnamon. Coated it with caramel sauce then hot fudge.  VERY good!  Next time will also use chopped pecans.

This was wonderful! Any problems with it were not due to the recipe, but my lack of proper equipment. I don't have a deep fryer so I heated oil in a dutch oven. And I didn't test the temp. Now my house smells like a deep fryer! I fried flour tortillas in oil and sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. Added a spot of whipped cream as a sort of nest for the ice cream ball. I had frozen the ice cream balls for 3 hours as directed. I coated them with egg and them dipped them in the crumb mix (I used crushed corn chex). I did deep fry the balls but my oil was too hot and it just made it a burning, stinking mess! Once I turned down the heat, it was better, but still messy. So they crumb mix was only partially fried as I would dip quickly in and out and not get the whole ball fried. But they tasted delicious and my whole family loved them!

This recipe is great!  i used the extra cinnamon, too, and topped it like my fave restaurant: caramel sauce, strawberry sauce, and whipped cream.  This is definitely a keeper, for sure!!

This is a great recipe. A big hit at our house.  At first I couldnt get the ice cream into a ball shape but once you coat the ice cream with the crumbs you can create the ball shape you need. Thanks for the corn flake crumb suggestion (next to the bread crumbs at the market).  This is delicious.  I will make it a million more times!

Made this dessert recipe for our Cinco de Mayo party, it was a huge hit, I doubled the cinnamon and added about 2 tbsp sugar, also be sure you whip your egg whites well enough, it will make the cornflake mixture stick better, enjoy

The oil part is messy, but overall, not hard to make. I would use larger ice cream balls next time.

I really thought this would be a difficult recipe, and that it would take way to long to make in a night. I was wrong. I made it in about 5 hours with two coatings of cereal.

This was d-lish!  I served the ice cream in a tortilla that I had coated in cinnamon and sugar, and baked into the shape of a bowl.  Used a combo of cornflakes and graham crackers for the coating.  Will be making this again!

This was pretty good, but either the corn flakes soak up the oil too much or I left them in too long because it tasted a little too "oily".  I would definitely make again, but maybe try a different coating (another person used crushed up vanilla wafers - I might give that a try).

I followed this recipe and even added the vanilla wafter crumbs.  Unfortunately the crumbs didn't stick to the ice cream and just fell off when I fried it.  Maybe my oil was too hot?  The one (out of 15) that was eaten had a pretty good taste even though there weren't a lot of crumbs on it.

I love fried ice cream. Though I made my ice cream balls early that day and froze them. I aslo used my deep fryer and rolled them in frosted flakes (crushed well) and sweetened coconut flakes. When finished I topped mine with chocolate ice cream topping or caramel, my hubby perfers honey. Both with whip cream and  a cherry on top. With a baked tortilla brushed with butter and sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar on the side. (Try this with caramel ice cream too)

I'm sorry, but this fell apart faster than I could say stop. Then when I got then all together it started to stick, so I put it in the freezer and the it melted. It left overs were good though, so that is why I am giing it more than 2 stars.

This was so much work, I doubt I will ever do it again.  Also, I tried to do the coating twice, but most of it just fell off the secondo time.  Lots of work, and time, but it did taste good.

Taste just like the deep fried ice cream you get in Mexican Restaurants. Even better served like they do with fried (flour) tortilla triangles sprinkled with cinnamon-sugar and chocolate sauce and whipped cream.

Even though I had to modify the recipe a bit (by adding a LOT more cinnamon), I'm still giving this recipe 5 stars.  Simply put, it's the perfect fried ice cream recipe.  Since I don't have much patience when it comes to dessert, I only froze the ice cream long enough to crush the corn flakes, mix in the cinnamon, and beat the eggs.  It was just delicious as written, however I plan to add toasted coconut the next time I make it.  Thanks for sharing this recipe with us.

This was delicious, a huge hit with my friends.  I used graham cracker crumbs, and vietnamese cinnamon (the best).  I melted chocolate chips and poured it on top at the end.  It hardened and made it great.

You definitely need to add more cinnamon to this recipe- double/triple. We served it with baked tortilla strips drizzled with cinnamon and chocolate and caramel syrup. It was a hit.

This turned out okay for me.  I'll have to try it again.  Crushing the cornflakes in the blender was perfect.  Tripled the cinamon, but needed even more!  Next time I'll fry them for 3-5 seconds instead.

Excellent!  Would suggest crushing the flakes finely - will coat the ice cream better resulting in a great crust.

Loved it.  I did learn to make sure the ice cream gets heavily coated and is very firm before frying.  Watch carefully as it cooks or it will melt before your eyes!  15 seconds is too long!

Wonderful topped with honey!

Tried coating some with Cinnamon Toast Crunch rather than the corn flakes & cinnamon.  It was fantastic!

Will certainly make again.  Tastes just like Carlos O'Kelley's fried ice cream which is my favorite!

This is very similar to my recipe...I use a rich vanilla ice cream (no shortcuts there!) with the cinnamon, cornflake crumbs, & egg whites.  I do freeze hard, then dip again, then freeze hard again.  I use 350 degrees for 60 seconds...it always turns out SUPER!!  Don't do like some suggest & skip the frying.  It just isn't the same.  This is a fantastic recipe!  We drizzle honey over the finished dessert.

Really good easy recipe.  I added the Nilla wafers as some suggested and they came out fabulous.  I also tried making the bowls with the tortilla and found the 6" flour tortillas worked better than the 8".

The only thing I changed was to use Frosted Flakes to give it an even sweeter taste. And I also rolled them twice. My husband doesn't eat alot of ice-cream but he loved this

Absolutely wonderful! My husband and children loved this! We used crumbed vanilla wafers instead of corn flakes. We will now be purchasing a deep fryer just for this recipe! yum :)

We had this after dinner tonight and all I can say is, WOW! We loved it! I baked some tortilla strips brushed with butter and tossed in cinn & sugar to go with it, like the local mexican place does. It was so good. This is sure to be a regular treat around our house!

This tasted fantastic, but I think I will try adding some nuts or coconut next time.  I mixed cinnamon in with the whipping cream for topping, which was very tasty.

Better than I could have hoped for!!! I increased the cinnamon to about 3t and also made the baked tortilla shells like another reviewer did.  I topped with caramel, whipped cream, cinnamon, and sugar!!  FABULOUS!!!  I will definitely make again!  It was a great presentation and tasted wonderful!

Put simply, this didn't work. Frying it served no purpose except to make a mess and decrease the size slightly. I was hoping the cereal would form a nice, hot outer shell, but was severely disappointed.

Great recipe. Made no variations. I did start 2 days before I served it and froze the ice cream. Then I coated it the next day. I did two layers of coating, freezing it in between. Make sure the oil is hot, if not the end result wont be as good. Definitely trying again.

With some modifications, reminded me of the restaurant version I have had. Like others, I was hesitant to make (too difficult??) but it wasn't too challenging and was worth all the effort. Everyone enjoyed as a nice, creamy finish to our Mexican Fiesta Dinner!

I followed the modifications suggested by others. This is a challenging dessert because if it isn't frozen enough it splatters/pops in the deep fryer. With a little practice it could be perfect. It was pretty good. Close to the restaurant versions.

This recipie was fantastic!  And I was not expecting much as I figured it would be very hard to make.  Turns out this Fried Icecream is the best I have ever had, better than at the resturanuts.  And you get to pick your own Vanilla.  I used Edies Vanilla Bean.  I added the embelishment of Hot Fudge and Carmel on top and served it on a Fried Tortilla coated with cinnemon and sugar.  Delicious!

YUM!!!!!!! Excellent, just like Chi-Chi's Mexican Restaurant! I used a mixture of corn flakes, cinnamon (lots) and crushed vanilla wafers, and coated the frozen ice cream balls in corn syrup instead of egg whites before rolling it in the dry mix. The frying part only takes a few seconds - be ready to take them out right away. I drizzled each one with honey and topped with whipped cream, and got rave reviews from everyone in the family! This was a great recipe and I am very impressed with myself that I was able to make fried ice cream just like the restaurants do! :)

Wow!  These were terrific.  A big hit with my family.  I prepared the individual servings the night before so I didn't have to do anything after dinner but heat the oil and fry.  If your using your refrigerator freezer turn it down all the was to get it as cold as possible.

I love this dessert! It's so yummy. It takes some effort, but it totally worth it. I love drenching the ice cream balls in carmel and fudge sauce. I also love using other flavors besides vanilla.

This turned out great. I followed the advice of others and doubled the amount of cinnamon.  To crush the corn flakes I put them in a large storage bag and roll over them with a rolling pin.

This was absolutely awesome!  It's the only fried ice cream I've had that I've liked since I fell in love with one offered at an independent restaurant over a decade ago.  This is easy to do.  Be sure to refreeze the ice cream as directed.  I didn't change a thing about the recipe and it worked out wonderfully.

This recipe is fabulous! Its very easy to make,it just takes time for the ice cream to freeze back up.Your kids can help roll up the softened ice cream,they can crush the cornflakes & older kids can even fry it.We put some chocolate sauce & peaches with ours.This is a recipe we will make again & again. Thank you!

Easier to make than I anticipated. I pulverized cereal and rolled ice cream balls in egg then cornflake/cinnamon/cinnamon toast crunch mixture. Next, I froze them for a good hour. I then rolled them once more in egg, then the lightly crushed cornflakes and fried them. Finally, I topped them with caramel. No disasters, happy family. Kids have asked this one to be put in “the rotation.”

Sooooo good! Made for for Cinco de Mayo dessert last night & it was a hit!  I did 1.5 cups crushed Corn Flakes & 1.5 cups crushed Vanilla Wafers & 2 tsp. cinnamon instead of 1.  Fried in peanut oil. Drizzled with hot fudge sauce, whipped cream & a sprinkle of cinnamon.  Will definitely make it again!

Only thing I did differently was froze it overnight after adding cornflakes. Wanted to be sure frozen.  Absolutely delicious. My whole family loved it. I had made it for my daughter's birthday. A big hit.

We used peanut oil to fry in and rolled ice cream balls in corn syrup.  Both excellent recommendations!

I subbed a cup of crushed graham crackers for cornflakes. Added a few Tb of sugar to mixture. I had to recoat 3x to get a good seal for frying. Loved it with cinnamon sprinkled on top. Fried for 20-40 seconds. 10-15 was more of a raw exterior

A very easy and delicious treat. I didn't have cornflakes so I substituted panko bread crumbs and a little nutmeg, came out great.

This was delicious!  I followed the recipe, with the addition of dipping them in the egg and corn flake mix twice.  Froze them overnight.  Drizzled caramel and whipped cream on top, although kids did chocolate sauce.  Picky 12-year old ate 2!  So good.  Definitely a keeper!

Frying these gives that delicious double texture of crunchy fried crust with sweet cold ice cream. I wouldn't skip this step! Love them.

Made this exactly as written, and it turned out great!  I pressed the coating into the ice cream with my hands instead of just rolling the ice cream in the topping - this seemed to help keep the coating intact while frying.  Turned out great and all my dinner guests loved it!

I did use Cinnamon Toast Crunch rather than cornflakes because thats what I had on hand. I did freeze after scooping, double coated each ball, and put them in the deep freeze over night. I fried each ball for 20 seconds each and had no problems with excessive melting. The outer layer was nicely melted the rest was still frozen. We served in a cinnamon sugar tortilla bowl with chocolate syrup and caramel.

Simple, delicious and... CHEAP! This great combination will impress your guests and is a treat to make. *make sure to keep your oil at 375* and count a quick 15sec max. Believe it or not, you can burn fried ice cream! Make these balls a day in advance and keep them in the remaining flakes while they chill in the coldest part of your freezer (bottom). 
I have made these several times and packing solid scoops that are nicely round and solid make it much easier.

This is absolutely amazing. The only thing I would recommend is to add coconut to the concoction. It gives it added flavor. =)

Just like I remember!  I used frosted flakes for my coating (I dipped in egg twice, and ended up using 2 beaten eggs), haagen daz for our vanilla ice cream, and let them set overnight before frying and serving.  I didn't top mine with whipped cream, but did drizzle with honey.  My family loved it!

After reading through some of the reviews, I thought I would be more impressed with the results, but I wasn't. The only change I made when making these was to use frosted flakes instead of the regular corn flakes.  My husband and kids enjoyed it though.

Made once with regular cornflakes, then again with Vanilla Almond Honey Bunches of Oats. Eh. It was certainly edible, but I felt like it was lacking. I've had better luck wrapping the ice cream balls in plain white bread, then frying. The taste of the ice cream comes through more that way, as opposed to super crispy cereal.

This recipe surprisingly went very well.  (Considering your trying to deep fry icecream.)  I followed the recipe exactly, and the results were amazing.  Very similar in taste to what I have had at a favorite restaurant.  I do not have a deep fryer, so I use my electric skillet.  I fill it 1/2 to 2/3 full with oil and turn on the thermostat and wait for it to get hot.  Very delicious recipe, a great way to end our Mexican themed family dinner.  The kids were impressed!  Thanks!

I made this for my husband who has always wanted to get fried ice cream when we go out for Mexican food, but is too full by the end of the meal to be able to order it.  He absolutely loved this!  As others suggested, I added more cinnamon, and it was fantastic.  It would also be great with other toppings such as chocolate, caramel, strawberries, whipped cream, etc.
