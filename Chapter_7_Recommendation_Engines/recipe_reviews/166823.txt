Great recipe. However, no true Boricua would cook a pernil without the bone and skin left intact to make chicharrone. As a personal preference- I don't cover any of my meats. I simply slow cook this piece of pork (skin side up)in a standard conventional oven at 325 for 1 1/2 hrs every 10 lbs. Marinate with adobo, sofrito, fresh garlic cloves, and sazon at least 8 hrs before cooking. Watch how tender and moist this well seasoned traditional meat will be. The crisp skin will be an added treat to savor.

Loved the recipe! My husband asked for me to save this one "it's a keeper"!   I substituted dried oregano for fresh and used only 1/2 as much; used regular chili powder instead of ancho chile pepper; redwine vinegar instead of white wine vinegar and added a splash of margarita mix.      I cooked a 5 lb. pork loin roast so doubled all ingredients. It made it's own wonderful broth. I also ran out of time so cooked on HIGH for 4-5 hours. It was very tender and I served in slices rather than chunks.   This was very easy to prepare and my company and family loved it. I placed leftovers in individual containers and froze them for my husband to take in his lunch...he LOVES it!

ZERO STARS!!!    BIG, BIG disappointment!  Just made this last week, I ended the cooking in the oven because the meat was still raw at the end of 4 hrs cooking.   After cooking in the oven for two hours, the meat was dry.  I am old fashion Latin person and I am used to the old fashion way of roasting pork:  At my house ALL meats are quickly rinsed with lemon juice BEFORE preparing to cook (do not leave the juice on too long otherwise the acid in the lemon will start 'cooking' the meat).  The skin is first removed with as much fat as possible. The fat side is “crossed-scored” (this helps to bleed the fat off the skin) with a knife and use the rub on both sides of the skin.  Place the skin, used to self-baste, fat side down on the meat, as you rotate the meat, keep the skin (fat side down) on top, until the last hour of baking, remove skin, place besides the roast, fat side up.  A HOME MADE RUB MADE WITH PLENTY OF GRANULATED AND FRESH GARLIC, LITTLE OREGANO (OTHERWISE THIS OVERPOWERS THE TASTE), SALT, PLENTY OF BLACK PEPPER, PIMENTON (SMOKED PAPRIKA)   RUB THE MEAT, CUT MANY HOLES INTO THE MEAT AND ALSO 'STUFF' THE 'HOLES' WITH THE RUB, SLOW BAKE 325° F (FOR AT LEAST 4 HRS) .

This turned out great. Being Puerto-Rican myself, I've done the traditional method of cooking the pernil in the oven. I loved the convenience of using the slow-cooker instead, and it turned out just as good. I always cut into the meat and shove some of the garlic/pepper paste into it. Also, I put balled up pieces of foil under the pernil to elevate it a bit. This prevents it from sticking to the bottom and sitting in the grease. It came out very moist and delicious. Once you place the lid on it, leave it! Every time it's opened moisture escapes. I opened it after 6 hours and it was done. Remember pork is fully cooked at an internal temp of 170 degrees.

I've made this 4 times already. I follow the recipe as written and the result is a very flavorful and tender pork that my friends love and request when we have a get together coming up. I'm not a fan of the slow cooker but it works well enough. Having said that... I think this recipe is second best to a traditional puertorican pernil where the main ingredients are tons of garlic, adobo, oregano, white vinegar and onions.

This was wonderful. I was tired of the same old pork and apple combination. After reading the other reviews, I made a few adjustments.  I combined all the seasonings together adding Adobo and a cup of water as suggested by another reviewer. I did not have white wine vinegar so I used red wine and garlic vinegar instead. I also followed the recommendation to puree the seasonings and to stuff it into slits cut into the roast. I then cooked it in the slow cooker. Some of our family liked the roast with lime juice and some without.  I liked it both ways. The gravy was good on-top of rice. This was easy and everyone loved it. This one goes in the recipe box. Thanks!

I did not have fresh oregano and got confused so I used 4 tblsp of the dried (instead of halfing the amount of fresh for dried) and cooked according to directions.  It was still really good.  What I did was saute onions and garlic in olive oil, add a little mojo and shredded the pork into it and fried it until browned.  Served it with Maduros (fried ripe plantains) and rice with lime squeezed on it.  I thought I was at a restaruant.  Delicious!  If you want an authentic tasting spanish meal try it!

I did as suggested and added a ton of garlic, adobo, and sazon and it turned out fantastic.  This is going to be our New Year's tradition now!

I was afraid to make a Puerto Rican dish being that my husband is Puerto Rican and his mother is by far the best cook in the family. Well, he loved it! He asked me to make his family when they visit. It was a hit! Thanks for the recipe!

Made this after returning from spring break in Puerto Rico and missing the food (and weather!).  This completely brought me back to vacation - it tasted as good (or even better) than some of the food I had in Puerto Rico!  I made several modifications to the recipe based on others' reviews.  First, I used pork shoulder and marinated it overnight, cutting slits in the meat so the marinade could soak in (I followed the marinade recipe but added extra garlic cloves).  I layered the bottom of the slow cooker with sliced onions, put in the marinated pork roast, and topped it with a cup of orange juice and the juice of one lime.  After 6 hours, I shredded the meat and removed the bone, and added a TON of adobo seasoning and a good amount of cayenne, as I noticed the spicy raw garlic taste had mellowed a lot during cooking.  I let the shredded meat cook another half hour or so, then changed the setting to warm.  Served with yellow rice and beans (arroz con habichuelas), and had leftovers on rolls.  My family gave it rave reviews (even my dad, a pulled pork connoisseur).  I'll definitely make it again!

YUM, YUM, YUM!! This recipe is absolutely awesome!  My husband and I LOVED this pork!  Changes I made: used 1 TBSP dried oregano like many others. Also, I used a tsp of cayenne pepper because I had no ancho chile pepper.  The amount of olive oil I used was 1/4 cup, and I used 2 TBSP of vinegar instead of 1.  Will definitely make this again! Additional info....I made this a second time and used a sweet vidalia onion, BIG mistake!!  Using a yellow (strong) onion is the way to go!

Very good! My husband and I love this. Because it makes a lot we have 3 meals of this. The first we eat shredded over rice. The second we eat as tacos. The third is Cuban sandwiches! It is my favorite slow cooker dish.

This pork was awesome!  I had my parents over for dinner and they were in love with it as well.  The only adjustments that I made was to add some margarita mix to the slow cooker, and i just used regular chili powder since I didn't have any of te chili powder the recipe called for.  It was devine!  Oh, and I also cut slits in the pork and stuff it with some of the sauce as well.

OH MY GOSH!!!! 
Can't I rate this higher than 5 stars?!?
Just made a batch and I know I could eat it all right our of the bowl. I modified the ingredients a bit to what I had on hand, dried oregano, and reg. chili powder, added 2 jalapenos and some cilantro. It's in the crock pot smelling sooo yummy. I have some Spanish rice in the freezer from another meal & that will go into tortillas with the pork for burritos tonight. I can see this used in a dozen different ways; kabobs, shrimp, chicken... Oh I'm so happy! 
Thanks for the great recipe!

For the stupid person who said they had to finish the pork in the oven because it was still raw after 4 hours....You need to re-read your crockpot manual. The whole point of a crockpot is to NOT take off the lid until after the suggested # hours needed to cook, which for most meat is minimum 6 hours.

Recipe works well.  No you will not get the crunchy skin associated with traditional baked pernil but the flavors are on point.  Feel free to substitute red wine vinegar if white is not readily available.  Suggest adding Abodo and Sazon (both GOYA products) to your pork before cooking.

My original review is below and was done September 2011. It's now November 2016 and I'm still making this. I had to come back to give a recommendation. What I did this time was take out the pork with about a half hour left to cook, shredded it by pulling it with two forks, and then put back in for a half hour. This is probably the best it has ever come out and I highly recommend this step.  >>>>>

        

                                    Esto es fantástico! I've been following this recipe for about two years, and I'm happy every time. Today, I'm making it with pork loin chops (bone in) and this past summer I made it with a 13lb pork loin and slow roasted it on a grill. When I started cutting it, I sent someone inside to slice the limes, and by the time he came out there was almost none left. Like I said, it's a hit every time. I recommend serving it with yucca and I would suggest this recipe; http://allrecipes.com/recipe/cuban-style-yucca/detail.aspx Just adjust the cooking time, as 15 minutes is not long enough to cook yucca. Enjoy.

I'm puerto rican and have always woken up early to put the pernil in the oven and carefully watch over it until the skin turns nice  and crispy. Truth be told my waistline could do without the chicharones ! The bone does help to give flavor and keep the meat moist in the oven but I find its not necessary when you make it in the crockpot,  I love this crockpot version because its leaner and still packs all the flavor of the traditional dish. I did make some changes however-puerto rican food is not inherently spicy so I dropped the chili. Im sure that chili is what gives the pictured pork its beautiful color, if i ever needed that color im sure a packet if sazon woukd do just fine. I also used less cumin and more garlic and dried oregano. I added fresh squeezed orange juice along with the lime. I've made this dish with pork loin  and bone in pork shoulder and surprisingly I like it better with the pork loin. Also I cook the whole thing with a bay leaf. Overall this was a great base recipe that was easy to adapt to my families traditional pernil recipe.

This is great! I had a boneless pork cutlets, rather than a roast, and they turned out very well. I was too lazy to shop for fresh oregano, so I used dried, and it was fine. This is a keeper.

This is very good!  Used a 3.7 lb loin roast, bone-in. Don't have a blender, so I just whisked together all the ingredients.  The oilve oil part was confusing, so I just used a tsp or thereabouts.  Used 2 tsp white vinegar and 1 tsp red wine vinegar.  Didn't have ancho powder, so added a little chili powder and cayenne (my man is half Mexican).  Used 2 tablespoons of lime juice, since that's what all the sites say to substitute, and 1/3 the amount listed of DRIED oregano.  Dumped all ingredients on top of the fat layer and put it into the crock pot bone side down. Cooked in the crock pot on low for about 8-9 hrs.  Absolute perfection!  I was concerned with so little salt, but it does not need it.  Just falls off the bone.  Delicious!

I've made this several times already, following the recipe almost exactly (substituted regular chili powder for ground ancho chile pepper) and everyone loves it!  I slice the pork into chops and shred after cooking.  I usually serve this with mashed or roasted potatoes and a green vegetable.  Highly recommend!

This was delicious! I the only change I made was to use less cumin because I don't like it very much. I used about a 1/2 tsp. Other than that, I made it as written. It was moist and oh-so-flavorful! I served it over arroz con habicuelas rosada (rice with pink beans) and it was an awesome meal!

I did this alittle differntly. I went with one of the other reviews using vinegar adobo salt pepper sazon garlic and a little water. I marinated it over night and when I put it in the slow cooker I also glazed it with sofrito. I used about a 4lb shoulder so I cooked it for 8 hours. It was so juicy and excellent!

Great flavour! I would just half the salt next time i make this (or even less).  I made pulled pork tacos out of the roast and with the salsa i added to my taco, it was overly salty. Other than that, i didn't let it sit for any amount of hours and the flavour was just great!

This was delicious!  I did add about a shot glass worth of margarita mix, a packet of sazon seasongin, and a little adobo seasoning.  I used a pork shoulder instead and it was fabulous!  Very moist and tender!

This tasted so strange to my husband and I, we just couldn't eat it. The only thing I changed from the recipe was a dash of soy sauce instead of worchestershire, but that couldn't have been the problem. I guess we just aren't used to this blend of spices.

Absolute best recipe! So flavorful and tender. The aroma while cooking tells all. Will now be made often.
I use a 6 lb. bone in pork shoulder and changed serving size to 12, which says to use 2- 3lb shoulders. This still worked great. I put in slow cooker at 8:00 at night and it was perfect by 11:00 the next morning, so about 15 hrs. I just pulled bone out and put meat on platter where I pulled it with 2 forks then slipped it back into juices. YUMMY. Used it as is for sandwich on sturdy buns; over rice or noodles or then you can change it out by adding BBQ sauce to it :)

Absolutely perfect. Made it for a Puerto Rican party and everyone raved about it! Made it again the following week for my family and it turned out perfectly. This is a tried & true recipe and I would highly recommend it. Will be making it for the next 25 years! I served it with a Puerto Rican bean dish, rice, and a cabbage salad. Yummy!

I was hesitant to try this recipe because I've never had Pernil before and the spice combo is different, but it was FABULOUS!  I kept to the recipe except that I didn't have that kind of pepper so I substituted cayenne pepper and bit of red pepper flakes.  Next time I will cut back on the pepper because this had a bit more of a kick than my husband likes but we both agreed, the recipe is great and the pork was unbelievably delicious.  And the house smells amazing while it's cooking!  This is going to be my new go-to pork recipe.

Yesterday, I defrosted my chest freezer and found a very sad-looking pork shoulder roast at the very bottom. The wrapping was torn and it was a bit freezer-burned. I thawed it out overnight and put it in the crock pot this morning using this recipe. I didn't expect much. 

It was heavenly. Moist, tender and delicious. I subbed dried oregano for fresh; otherwise, I followed the recipe. My husband and I both loved it, and I'll follow another reviewer's advice: tacos tomorrow night and Cubano sandwiches the next. Thanks for the great recipe. I'll use it again and agai, I'm sure.

Loved it.  I would use less salt next time.  I used my pressure cooker to make this in 35 to 40 minutes, adding some water to the bottom of the pan.  Also tried the Puerto Rican Steamed Rice with it for fun.  The marinade combined with the water in the pan to make a perfect sauce for the meat and rice.  I sliced it tonight, and I will shred the rest to enjoy tomorrow in a bun or whatever.

I give this 5 stars because my husband has been talking about it for 3 days now.  I wanted to try something similar to carnitas, but being that it was stormy, I didn't want to run to the store for the ingredients I didn't have/couldn't substitute.  I decreased and subbed dried oregano for the fresh and 1/2 t. of 4 various ground peppers I had on hand for the ancho chile pepper.  The house smelled wonderful and the roast fell apart perfectly.  It was tender, moist, and flavorful on soft tortillas and alone.

This was amazing. We had eaten this dish in a Cuban diner in NYC and wanted to recreate it at home. This recipe was even better than the meal prepared in the commercial kitchen.  My guests all agreed that this is a great recipe.

Oh man was this fabulous.  Didn't have ancho chile pepper, so I substituted 3 dried thai chili peppers.  Didn't have white wine vinegar so I used a little white  vinegar along with some anjo tequila.  Also made mashed potatoes and the juices made a very tasty gravy.  Awesome!!!

This was awesome!  I did it pretty much as directed, except that I used a little more garlic, a little less black pepper, dried oregano instead of fresh, and cooked it on high for 4 hours.  PERFECT!  AMAZING!  Served it over white rice with sauteed green beans on the side.  YUMMY!

I basically stuck to the recipe, though used cider vinegar and dried oregano. The taste was great but I cooked it too long. I had 2.5 lbs. pork loin and put it in the slow cooker for 6 hours. Didn't realize the cooker wouldn't turn off when it finished but kept it on the warm setting. That being said, it wasn't completely dried out and the sauce added the needed moisture. I think it may have been a little heavy on the salt, but really great alternative to BBQ.

Used a pork loin. Did not blend ingredients - just minced the onions instead. Followed the directions except I added some ground coriander and had to use dried oregano. Cooked overnight on low. Moist, fragrant, tasty!

It was very good, however for 3.5 lbs of pork as I did, it needed possibly an hour less of cooking (I did it on low for 6hr 15min). Additionally, it didn't turn out as full of flavor as some reviews seemed to imply. However, since it was used as a shredded pork taco meat, it was still very good. I also added lime juice from a full lime to the blend before pouring over the loins as well as a decent chunk of cilantro. For those who don't like cilantro, don't do that as the cilantro flavor really was absorbed (but YUM!). I'm also obsessed with lime/lemon juice, so I'd recommend just a half lime squeezed unless you're like me. 
Overall, very good. Would make again but probably add more spices and more garlic.

This recipe is FABULOUS!!! I used pork shoulder instead of loin, and it came out so soft and flavorful! I think next time I won't add any oil to the spice mixture, since the pork was already marbled with a lot of fat, and I will also cut the meat into three pieces so that the spices can penetrate and coat it better. This recipe is definitely now a part of my permanent collection!

This was so quick and easy to assemble and resulted in a flavorful, tender and succulent roast. The whole family loved it and I shared it with about a dozen friends that I thought would enjoy it. I followed the recipe as written but did have to substitute dried oregano for the fresh. Making it again today! Thank you for sharing.

I love, love, love how easy and good this dish is. I leave out the anche pepper and stick with a more savory pork. It's a big hit whenever I serve it to friends and family. Add some black beans and rice and it feels like home.

Marvelous recipe!  I added a little Moore's marinade and some pork rub that I had in the pantry...cooked in on high in the slow cooker for about 3 hours.  Both kids and my husband absolutely loved it!  Very moist and delicious!

VERY tasty!  There are just two of us at home, so we ate about a quarter of this, and then I froze the rest, and have been using it in various recipes (casseroles, enchiladas, posole, etc.).  It has great flavor and comes out SO tender.

I think next time I'll do the same thing but roast in the oven to help the fat layer on top to crisp.  But the flavor was delicious!

I have made this recipe twice since finding it in the late fall. This is fantastic. I have tried it with pork chops and the suggested pork roast. Both ways come out perfect. Note: reduce the cooking time slightly for the pork chops.

Made it exactly as the recipe says and while it doesn't exactly taste like authentic Puerto Rican pernil in the oven, it turned out delicious. I'd definitely make it again, just don't anticipate it tasting exactly like authentic pernil. Easy and yummy!

I enjoyed through the last bite. The changes I made were from necessity. Didn't have fresh oregano or the chili powder specified. Replaced with dried oregano and gochugaru (Korean coarse red pepper flakes). Will cook it again.

Have made this numerous times and follow the recipe to the letter, except I use 1 T of dried oregano. Make sure you blend in the blender, don't try to shortcut it as I have tried before.  I shred this and use it to make carnitas and they are wonderful!

Made it exactly as written. It was terrible. Mealy and salty but none of that deep rich flavor you crave in a pernil. Inauthentic.

My family loved this recipe!  I doubled the spices and tripled the vinegar on a 4.5 pound roast, and the finished product had a delicious kick without being too spicy.  My kids ate the pork in tortillas (like street tacos), while my husband and I whipped up some pseudo-Chipotle bowls with lots on onion and fresh cilantro.  So, so good!

This recipe was AWESOME!! I had only made a few adjustments. I didn't have any garlic cloves so I used 2tsps of garlic powder. I didn't have any Chile pepper so I substituted those 2tsps as follow: 1tsp of cayenne, 1tsp of paprika. I used vegetable oil bc I don't own any olive oil. That I poured at my own discretion. And last, I added to the blender mixture 1 cup of water. Blended those ingredients and viola!! For the first two hours, I cooked it on low. And for the last 3 to 4 hours, I slow cooked it on high. I loved, my kids did too!! Thank u for sharing this recipe!

If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would.  I couldn't find ancho chili pepper powder so I used regular chili powder.  I also used 1 TBSP dried oregano instead of 2 TBSP fresh.  Served this pork with Arroz con Grandules which I made from following the recipe on the back of a can of Goya Pigeon peas.  Delicious!

YUM! I took the advise of many and used a shoulder roast, added adobo and sazon to the garlic/onion mix, and cooked it in some OJ and lime juice. Shredded it after 7 hours and then cooked it for another hour. I think I overdid it a little on the extra spices, or I should have not added the salt in addition, but it still came out VERY VERY good.

It was as good as pork at the Columbia Restaurant in Florida!  I tweeked it a bit.  Doubled the garlic, cumin and ground ancho chili pepper. The recipe does not state how much olive oil so I used equal amts vinegar/oil.  I also added 2 chipotle chili's in adobo (from the  can) into the mix for the blender.  It was FANTASTIC.  Made it for the first time new years eve for guests.

Pork loin is so lean, it dries out in the slow cooker.  I added a piece of pork shoulder that I had, and while the flavour isn't much better, the texture certainly is.  Even after marinating overnight, the flavour of this was still very bland.  I shredded the meat, added back some of the liquid in the crock and a lot more seasoning.  That seemed to help.

To serve this, I heated some bacon fat in a nonstick pan and pressed the shredded meat into it, letting it form a crust before flipping it over (in bits).  The crusty, brown flavour helped the overall taste of the dish immensely.

Excellent!  I used a mini food processor to combine the paste ingredients, and since there was no quantity for the olive oil I went with a tablespoon.  I think that was too much, so next time I'll just use a teaspoon or so.  Had extra puree leftover so I just dumped it in the crockpot.  Delicious! Moist and tender!

Made this past Sunday June 3 DELICIOUS  My husband loved loved it.  Cooked in crock pot 7 hrs on low.  Meat was so tender and juicy-fell apart as I was taking it out of crock.  I loved the liquid mixture so much, made another batch to use for leftovers and for chicken during the week as we used much of the original.  I also used some of the mixture for potatoes, which I quartered.  Just added a bit of flour to the liquid to thicken it up then put it over potatoes also DELICIOUS. 
Thank you for a great recipe.  It's def a keeper.

This recipe is sooooo... good.  I trimmed the fat from the pork before cooking, and doubled the garlilc (as an earlier reviewer suggested). I made the Cantina Pinto Beans (Allrecipes, also) to go with it. I topped both with fresh cilantro and lots of fresh lime.  Really, really good!!

I liked this recipe.  It cooked all day in the slow cooker.  I  had no trouble shredding the tender meat and it tasted wonderful.

The only change I made was dry oregano instead of fresh in 1/3 quantity.  The meat was dry and tough.  Stuck with lots of leftovers as my husband won’t eat it again.  Sounded good, but did not come out as described.

I didn't make i! Puerto Rican food rarely uses chilis in any form and certainly not on a pernil.  That's for Mexican food.

One of the tastiest meals I have ever made.  The combination of the seasoning and meat extraordinary.  Made it in a slow cooker and served on hamburger buns.  It was a hit.  A great change over the normal Pulled Pork recipes.

Made as written, subbing only dried oregano for fresh.  I have to say that this is the easiest thing in the world to make the flavorful puree and pour it over the pork loin and turn on the slow cooker.  After a few hours, a delicious result. Perfect to make on a busy day.

Very easy to prep for the slow cooker and the pork loin shredded like butter when done cooking.  Great for main dish served with warm tortillas and cool green salad will use leftovers to make taquitos.  A winner!

I made it just like the recipe, which is unusual for me, and it was perfect! So flavorful.  The leftovers make great hot sandwiches on a roll with melted pepper jack cheese and a few pepperocinis.

I tried this recipe because it sounded so intriguing to me.  I pretty much followed the steps for the recipe and did add some more cloves of garlic into the meat as others had suggested but I did forget some of the other suggested items some reviewers had added.  It was very tender and did fall apart and my husband and son were ok with it and so was I but I'm not sure if I will make it again.  If I do, I may seek some guidance from one of two my sister in laws who are Hispanic and they may be able to tell me where I went wrong.  It did smell wonderful while it was cooking so I'm disappointed in myself if I forgot to add something that would've made it be as it was described.    Any suggestions are welcome!

Made for Christmas! The only thing left was the bones!!! My family and friends loved it. Personal touch was that the last 30 minutes I put it on high and then put on the oven on broil on high for about 10 minutes (with the greasy part on top) to get a real Puertorican crunchy and tasty "chicharrón" on the outside and a tender and juicy pernil inside. Just perfect ??

This was very good.  The flavors worked really well, and minor adjustments (dried oregano) still worked out.  I sliced it for some of my picky family, shredded my portion, and everyone loved it!

Love this! My husband loved it too! Used chili powder instead of peppers because I didn't have any. Used red wine vinegar instead of white because that is what I had on hand. Cuban sandwiches tomorrow with the leftovers! Can't wait! Will definitely make this again. Great recipe for a crowd.

Family of five and everyone loved it.  I did make a few changes based on other reviewers suggestions.  I didn't have ancho chile so I used chili powder instead.  I also added sazon and about a cup of water.  It finished more like a pulled pork than sliced which was fine because we love pulled pork.  I made low fat cole slaw on the side and enjoyed a guilt free meal.

2/24/2017 - This recipe is so good! I didn't have fresh ingredients on hand and subbed with dried ingredients (just halved the amount called for in the recipe). Also, I used chili powder in place of the ancho chile (used same amount ancho chile called for in recipe). I used a 3.6 lb bone-in pork loin roast and increased serving size to 7 for ingredient amounts. After removing fat cap, scored the meat, and ensured the paste was rubbed in well. Roast was just at 170 degrees F and was moist, after 6-6.5 hours on low. We shredded the meat, which tasted great as is, and added it back to the sauce, of which the meat soaked in even more flavor. Served with steamed white rice and Habuchuelas Guisadas (from this site). Thanks for sharing the recipe! UPDATE: 6/17/2018 - Made this in the instant pot and just as described in my 1st review, but cut roast into 4 chunks and seared in batches. Cooked on manual for 80 min and let natural release. Removed pork and shredded meat. Discarded most of the liquid in the pot and added shredded meat back to pot and stirred to combine with the liquid while on keep warm.  Excellent flavor!

Flavor is amazing. 1 hr on high then 5 on low. It was perfect for shredding. It was a little dry. My husband added mayo to his sandwich which made it perfect.

Did it pretty much as stated on the recipe.  And just so my mom doesn't come back to haunt me I added adobo seasoning.  We Puerto Ricans love our adobo. It turned out tender and moist and delicioso. Served it with rice and beans and tostones.

My boys LOVED this!!!  I had a pork loin in the freezer that needed to be used, and I needed a slow cooker recipe cause it was gonna be a crazy week. This was super easy. I used dried oregano, I imagine it would have been better with fresh. I also didn't have Ancho Chile powder, so I used Chipotle instead ( I only used 1 TBS, but could have cut it back a little more.) I also didn't have fresh lime juice so used the bottled kind. My boys thought it was the perfect heat, but mouth was burning. Made it with rice and beans and it was a hit! One of my boys made a burrito out of it. Defintely a keeper!! Also, the pork loin I used was just about  2lbs, I didn't change the meaurements for the rub/sauce

Made this and my husband and son loved it!  I used red chile pepper and did not use oregano.  I also added 1 ½ tablespoon of sugar.

I will make this again, but cut the salt in half.  Overall, very good!  I also put some black beans in the croc pot too.  They soaked up the flavor and mixed well with yellow rice.

Served it shredded as sliders with pickle relish and cheese, other family members used BBQ sauce. Only change I made was using Apple Cider vinegar, because that's what I had on hand. Tasted wonderful!

I added 2 Tbs. Sazon Tropical to the roast.  One suggestion I have is that since it is such a large roast, to cut in half then place in the slow cooker. Also, I think that if it was marinated overnight with the mixture, it would be even more tasty. Defininity will make again- and pre-marinate! Delicious!

Except for using chili powder instead of ancho peppers because that's what I had, I followed this recipe pretty much as written. Cooked over night in the crock pot, was ready by lunch time.  Five stars from everyone in this house.

This is one of my favorite dishes and this recipe makes it much simpler than others I have tried. The flavors are all there. This is now a regular in rotation.  It is simply WONDERFUL. Best use of a pork roast. Sometimes I shred it and use it in tacos and burritos too.

I loved this recipe.  So flavorful and pairs well with Saffron Rice, Sauteed Cabbage and Orange Glazed carrots.  I did leave it in the slow cooker for a couple more hours than called for.  I made this for my husband and a couple of guest.  Everyone had seconds and raved about the meal!

Awesome recipe! I was looking for a slow cooker recipe for pork that was something other than barbecue and this was great! Wonderful flavor and super easy! The pork was extremely tender. Served this in lettuce wraps with thinly sliced tomato and it was sooo good.

Definitely worth the try. I made the mistake of searing the meat with salt and pepper before following the directions. The result left it rather salty. Other than that,  it was very tender and full of subtle flavor.

Oh my goodness! Made the recipe exactly as is, sticking my pork roast in the crock pot in the morning. Because it was a long day, I needed to cook on low for 10 hours, so I stuck the roast in while still frozen.  I covered it with the sauce and headed to work. Came home to amazing finished roast.  My family loved it. the juice had amazing flavor, just the right intensity of flavors. We had NO leftovers. (which I was hoping to shred and use for pork tacos later in the week)

I was worried that so few ingredients would equal minimal flavor, but I was wrong.  Tons of flavor, and I skipped the ancho chile.  I used a pork loin roast because that's what I had.  I should have used a shoulder or something fattier, because my meat was really dry.

Absolutely fantastic!  I couldn't believe how tender this was.  I used 2 lb. boneless pork roast, cut off the butcher's netting and opened the roll a bit, spread some of the mixture in the openings then retied with string (also makes it easier to cut when finished).  Marinated overnight, adding a packet of Sazon and a good sprinkle of Adobo as others recommended.  Didn't have ancho chile pepper so used 1 tsp. of cayenne - should have used only 1/2 tsp.  Since it was a little spicey, when meat was finished I took it out and added 2 packets of Sweet & Low to the juice, shredded the meat and returned to the crock pot for a little while.  Served with Zataran's Caribbean Rice - will DEFINITELY make this again!  Thanks Counntry Cook!

I tried the recipe and it was good and OK - just not my favorite.  I couldn't find the Ancho Chile spice and used 1 can of chipotle' adobo sauce with 2 chopped jalapeños.  It was very hot and spicy. I added vegetable broth just to add more moisture to pour over the pork and rice

 I shredded the left over pork and spread it over nachos. I liked the pork better over nachos instead of rice.  That was yummy.

This got 5-Stars from my toughest food critic...no, not my hubby or small children - my mother! I added a little extra garlic and saffron, as suggested from another Review, and1/2 the chili powder (it's not my favorite flavor) and it was really excellent, easy, & versatile! My entire family devoured it!

Except for the Ancho chile pepper (I used regular chile pepper), I followed this recipe to a tee. It was tender and well-cooked, but didn't have the flavor I expected it to have. I'll check out the other reviews for some tips, as it was very easy to make.

I don't know if this is authentic or not, and I don't care! This is amazing! I made it exactly as directed, except my blender quit working, so I just diced the onion, and tried to mix everything well by hand. Falling apart tender with great flavor! I will make this again and again! Tonight, serving over rice. Tomorrow in tacos!

Very good, however too much salt for us. I followed the recipe, except used a pork tenderloin (2x) instead. Pulled apart so nice after 5.5 hours on low. Will try again with 1/2 the salt.

This was super tasty!  I added a little too much salt (accident) so the pork wasn't quite as tender as I'd hoped but that could have been the cut of meat.  Note that if you are looking to taste the pernil you get for example in Venezuela, this ain't it, but it's a tasty dish all it's own.  :)

this was very good.. used the skirt off of a rack of spare ribs (about 12 oz) so i scaled it down to that.. used dried oregano and regular chile powder.. added a little more garlic and salt.. we're not puerto rican so we had no opinion on the authenticity of the dish.. it just tasted good.. ty for the recipe

My first Puerto Rican dish and it was wonderful!!!!!  Only had red wine vinegar and may have gone a bit heavier on the garlic but basically followed the recipe and we all loved it.  At six hours my 2.5+ pound roast was done, though not falling apart tender.  It kept nicely on warm until I prepared rice, which was perfect with the sauce, and black beans.  Lots of leftovers since there were only three of us so tonight I used them to make enchiladas which were also delish!

I just cooked it today. I followed the procedure step by step. It's my first time to cook Pork Pernil although I have tasted it several times in parties. My family likes it. We used hot sauce and lime juice. Will do it again .

I used dried oregano and regular chili powder and did not blend anything together (for time reasons) and it still turned out amazing!!!

Followed the recipe exactly with one small addition of one packet of Sazon and it was delicious. I was nervous that the pork loin wouldn't come out tender but it was so good. And not too spicy for my kids. We all loved it. Thanks.

This was amazing! I had a larger roast (4.5 #) than it called for so I upped the cumin, oregano (used dried), chili pepper, & salt by half. I also let it sit in the fridge overnight with the paste on it and then cooked it on low for 11 hours. Everyone loved it! Thanks for the recipe!

Made this for dinner tonight and it was fantastic!! I did make some adjustments I added green bell pepper, added the lime and used white vinegar instead of the white wine vinegar to the mixture that I blended. I also cut x's in the top of the pork roast and put adobo and sazon before pouring the blended mixture on top. I used the juices from the meat to make the rice and it was out of this world!!

Very good result for a loin roast (which I find to be a hard cut of meat t keep from drying out).  The paste reminded me of a pesto consistency, sans basil of course.
Will make this again.
