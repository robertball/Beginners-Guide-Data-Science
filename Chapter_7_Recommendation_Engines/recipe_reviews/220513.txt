I made this recipe first as a trial run for a new dip for Thanksgiving. When I made the onions for this dip, I actually chose to cook them until caramelized. Other than that, I kept to the recipe. This makes A LOT of dip. Like more than we could eat in one sitting. What I did was baked half of it in a small baking dish and refrigerated the rest. Honestly, we liked the cold version better! Not a bad dip but I think I would play with the amounts of the mayonnaise/sour cream when I make it again.
