This recipe get 5 stars due to how easy and delicious it was. My husband, who does not like cabbage, liked this recipe. We are both trying to lose weight so we have cut out pasta and other similar foods. I used 1 pound of ground turkey and 1 pound of ground Italian sausage. I used died tomatoes instead of getting whole and chopping them. It just made it that much easier. I also used ground red pepper instead of dried red pepper flakes and a bit more garlic than it called for. This recipe is so satisfying and filling it easily stood alone with no side dish needed. Great to fill that comfort food void that is left when you cut out pasta. This will become a regular addition on my menu rotation.

I vegetarianized this! Seasoning and preparation make this perfect! I used 12 oz. of veggie protein crumbles instead of the meats. I kept everything else the same 'til the simmering. I added one T of Splenda to balance the acidity of the tomatoes and a couple Ts of Mrs. Dash's Italian (Basil, tomato, etc.) to up the flavor. I also used fresh garlic. The Splenda definitely balanced the bitterness /acidity without adding calories. After these changes, it is a diet-friendly and delicious meal!

Very easy to make - I used hot sausage and I wouldn't do that the next time since it turned out to be VERY spicy with the chili powder added.  The heat that I created overpowered the cabbage.  But my guy loved it.  Would make this again.

Even as someone who just recently decided that cabbage is edible, I thought this dish was quite tasty.  The cabbage lightens up the meat very nicely.  I added 2 tsp ground cumin and 1 tsp caraway seeds, and served it with gold potatoes.  I'll definitely make it again.

I have made this several times now and hubby and I finally decided what it tastes like...  Do you like "pigs in a blanket" the kind you roll meat into cabbage leaves?  This is IT without all the work! Yummy and filling.

Great recipe!!  I used Jimmy Dean Italian Sausage (because that's what was in the freezer).  And I did season the ground beef with 1 tesp. of the "Taco Seasoning I" found on this site.  Everything else - to the T!!  I will keep this in the recipe book! (oh - I knew it would be too much for my 2-person household, so I halfed the recipe)

Is this missing something. Something to balance the acid of the tomatoes. I can't put a finger on it. Will have to work on it.
Then I will give stars

This was great, my husband loved it.  I substituted sliced bratwurst for the sausage only because I didn't have any.  Will definitetly make this again.

Gave this five stars!  Was looking for something with great reviews to make for New Year's Day that had pork and cabbage.  This was awesome, just like others said, even if you don't like cabbage, you will like this!  This will be our new New Year's traditional meal!

I prepared this without the chili powder and red pepper flakes because wifey and daughter don't care for heat and it still turned out great.  My wife, who rarely eats cabbage was wanting seconds.  Easy to make, taste great!

I loved it as well as the kids!  I used what I had available so I needed to make a few changes.  I did 1 and a half pounds ground turkey, used 5 tomatoes (peeled and diced) instead of the can of tomatoes.  I did 1 1/2 Tablespoons of Apple Cider Vinegar instead of vinegar and 4 cloves minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  I don't have red pepper flakes so I used black pepper when serving.  
It did need a little salt but everyone just added it to their own taste.  Because I didn't have the extra liquid from canned tomatoes, I covered it when it simmered and stirred occasionally.  It turned out great and I can't wait to make it again!

This was fantastic; however it did take longer to prepare than indicated in the recipe.    My husband loved it so much that he went back for thirds.  My nephew was here and he also went back for thirds.  We had everything packed up from kitchen cabinets (renovating kitchen) that I was unable to find my garlic salt.  Can't wait to try it again when I find the garlic salt.  Delicious and quick.

I'd serve this dish with corn bread, to make it more traditional Southern-style.

I think I will put this on a bun next time, it reminded me of spicy sloppy joe mix with cabbage, it wasn't bad I think if I make it again I will add corn or green beans.It was missing something....
