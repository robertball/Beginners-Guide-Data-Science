I tried these based on other reviews and I did not care for the sauce. I make french dips just like this, but with beef broth.  I think the taste of the french onion soup spoiled it for me.  Did not like the tart flavor of it.  If you want a good sauce use two cans of beef broth, chopped onion, 1-2 tbsp. worchestershire and 1 tbsp. soy sauce.  Just add all to a pot and bring to a boil.  Serve.

Absolutely to die for! The first time, I followed the recipe exactly. The second time, I took a frozen beef roast (salted and peppered it) and put it in the crock pot in the morning, then by afternoon it was tender and perfectly done. This I sliced and returned to the crock pot to soak up some of the drippings while I prepared the soup/worcestershire mix and split the French bread rolls I bought this time from the bakery section at my local super Walmart. I used a slotted spoon to add the meat to the soup, but wasn't overly concerned with the drippings getting into the soup either. Then, after it was heated, I used metal tongs to add the meat to the rolls and spooned on the soup. A half slice of provolone fit perfectly on these smaller rolls; it was a perfect dinner portion size too! Served it with pasta salad and baked beans.   So easy, delicious and much cheaper than buying deli roast beef, so I will be making it this way again and again.

Enjoyed this recipe however made a few tweaks and it was delicious. I used 1 can of French Onion Soup and a half of a can of Beef broth. I added 1 1/2 tbsp of worcestershire sauce, 1 tbsp of A1, 1/2 tbsp of Soy Sauce, and a few dashes of pepper. I also lightly buttered the rolls before adding the beef and provolone cheese. VERY GOOD... will definitely make again!

Excellent and so easy! Doubled the recipe-2 cans french onion, 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce, and 1-1/2 pounds roast beef. I added some fresh cracked black pepper to the soup mixture. Instead of pouring more juice over the sandwiches , I just served it in little cups for dipping. These were so delicious and we will use this often. What an easy meal, yum!

This recipe worked. The beef was so moist and delicious. I follow the recipe exactly but with one change. I toasted the subs first so they would not get smoggy. I also used Swiss cheese instead of provolone because the store was out. Still turned out great. The ladies gave it a big thumbs up.

My husband and I loved this! It was quick and easy to make.  I cut up some additional raw onions and sauteed them with a little olive oil and Worcestershire sauce and then I added the onion soup and simmered it for a little longer.  Along with some of the other reviews, I melted the cheese first and then topped it with my roastbeef and banana peppers.

Very yummy and so easy!  I used whole wheat hamburger buns vs the hoagie rolls and it was great too!  I boiled the roast beef in the french onion soup/worcestershire sause combo and then once I placed the meat on the bun I added just a small tblsp of soup/sause combo to the top of the meat then topped it off with the provolone.  I don't care for really soggy bread, so this was just enough for me.  5 min at 400 in the oven was plenty of time for toasting.  So great and easy!  10 min from start to finish.  I will be making this recipe often for sure.

We didn't exactly care for the flavor of the french onion soup for the sauce.  Next time I'll try to substitute beef broth instead.

I used 2 cans of french onion and 1 can of beef broth. I like to have extra dipping sauce to serve on the side and this gives just enough. I used more meat then callled for. I cut my meat into bite size pieces, just so it would mix a little better. Very good and simple meal.

5 stars for how easy it is...4 stars for it needs a little tweaking as it is a little boring as is. We added pepper & a little a1 to the gravy & it was much better.

I made this for my family. My dad said it was one of the best sandwiches he had. I added grounded peppercorn medley, a little bit of low sodium soy sauce, and some garlic pepper to the sauce. Another thing extra I did was I put the sauce on simmer and let it cook for with the meat in it for at least an hour. I also at the end sauteed onions, green and red peppers to add to the sandwiches taste. It was really good, and I plan on making it again soon.

I had this sandwich at a deli and they used black olives instead of peppers.  So if you want something different try that.  This is a great hot sandwich and the cheese melted makes it even better!

I used an entire pound of deli roast beef so I decided to add 1 cup of beef broth to the french onion soup and Worcestershire sauce and it was wonderful! One of my son's turned his into a French dip by using the au jus for a sandwich dip. I didn't realize I was out of the jarred peppers so I sliced up a red bell pepper and a yellow onion and sauteed them in vegetable oil. It was fantastic!

As a mom of 3 boys I'm always looking for good, easy recipes that are easy to make before sports practices (every night!). This was a great meal, and for my 2 sons that won't eat the regular version, I just kept some roast beef out to make plain melts.  Perfect!

Made as is for boyfriend, he loved it. I added mayo & spicy mustard on the roll for mine, yum! My 11 y/o son didnt want the french onion soup (ew, onions!) so I made his "plain". He tried mine and said he would have it have his next time with the soup. Quick, easy, delicious and sooo good on a cold afternoon.

Made this last night and it was FABULOUS!  The only thing I did differently was use ciabatta sandwich rolls (because I couldn't find hoagie rolls) and I served the juice on the side for dipping rather than pour it on the sandwich!  My whole family LOVED this!  I doubled the recipe and there was still NO LEFTOVERS!  GREAT recipe! :)

2 words.... Easy and Delicious!  I'm a chicken kind a girl and would never order this in a restaurant but to please my husband and teenage son, gave it a try.  It was a crowd pleaser!  Even my teenage dtr (also a chicken kind a girl)  loved it.  And again, super easy!

Absolutely fabulous! Used grass-fed beef cutlets sliced thin and threw in some thinly sliced onion - topped with pepper jack - husband wanted to know if he could take some for lunch tomorrow. - also, used French onion dip 'cause I had it on hand - good way to get rid of extra dip after a party.

This was so good! Our family tries to stay away from processed meats, so instead of using the deli meat
I roasted a lean cut of beef and thinly sliced it. Even my picky kids ate it which is saying a lot! Looks like this one is going to make its way into our regular menu rotation!

Would have been better with a whole roast.  Did not care for the deli  roast beef.

Been using this for years, but got tired of the mushy veggies.  I now cut up any veggies I have on hand, cut them in serving pieces, add a teaspoon each of thyme, rosemary and oregano, mix well and add olive oil to coat.  Put them in the oven and partially cook and add to the roast in the crock pot the last hour.  Really ups the flavour.  Also use two cans of soup and throw in a packaged gravy.  Yummy!

Delicious! Instead of using the sesame seed rolls, I used the Pepperidge sweet and soft rolls. Truly makes a terrific meal.

I added sauteed onions and bell peppers and of course garlic.  I've made it also with white cheddar and omg!! Yum. Thank you for recipe. New favorite and something different than just a French dip.

i made this but changed a couple of things.  Followed others who said to use beef broth,  i used 50 percent less sodium.  Also toasted the buns and cheese without the meat so the sandwich wouldn't be soggy and the meat wouldn't dry out.  Great sandwiches, easy to make,  and not expensive at all.  Will definitely make again.

I heat the meat & broth (save for dipping) in a microwave, don't toast the roll but rather steam them in a microwave bun warmer(My experience with toasted rolls is that when you bite down the ingredients like to ooze out!)Place the beef  onto a hot panini grill or flat top/frying pan on tin foil (no mess), place on cheese and cover and then assemble, enjoy!

Very good and easy. Be sure to add the worstershire. I also spread spicy Dijon and mayo on bread and toasted the bread in oven before adding meat.

Heating the beef in the French onion soup is the key. The beef stock really moistens up the roast very nicely. Crowd pleaser that is done and plated in 15 minutes.

I used leftover pot roast done in the crock pot (with plenty of seasoned onions, garlic, celery & carrots a couple days before). I warmed the pan juices instead of soup and heated the shredded beef, then followed this recipe.  It was a definite hit!

If you like French onion soup I'm sure you'd love this recipe. It's a great quick recipe but if you are not a big fan of the soup then I'd tweak it a little. We are for sure making this again but using beef broth instead as others suggested.

I used Boars Head rare roast beef, as I like the beef rare to med rare.  The beef cooked too quickly beyond my liking when I put in the au jus.  If you like the beef more rare (much more tender for these sandwiches) only leave it in long enough to heat.  Actually, it would heat enough in the oven - skip putting it in the pan with the au jus.

Loved this. Put my own spin on it since I'm a lady full of flavor. I added in some garlic powder, onion powder, pepper, and a dash of garlic vinegar. I didn't bother with the peppers. I also used horseradish cheddar cheese. All of this equated to one excellent, easy meal!

Ok for some reason they don't sell condensed French onion soup in Quebec, so I used a bag of powdered French onion soup, maybe 1/4 of the bag, mixed with one can of beef broth, and about one can equivalent of water. Added the worcestershire and it was delicious!  I did toast the bread (with just the cheese) before adding the beef so that the bread wouldn't get too soggy and it was perfect!  Thanks for this great recipe!
