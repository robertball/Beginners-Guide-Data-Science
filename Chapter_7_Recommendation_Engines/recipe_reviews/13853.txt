It was good, but we only did a third of the recipe and still had too much! Maybe it's because I went light on the toppings. I enjoyed it, but hubby who made the dish had problems getting the batter to stick to the zucchinis when frying them. It was very tasty.

Very good, but again, very fattening.  I used low fat sour cream, so that might help a little!

This was a little bland for my kids. I thought it was okay.

Good dish, but a touch on the bland side. maybe next time I will go with some sort of chili powder or hot sauce in the mix to just spice it up. This recipe makes a ton also, I might also 1/2 next time.
