This recipe is fabulous! I make it all the time for my family. It doesn't taste like salty spaghetti like the other review said.  I followed it exactly as the recipe says and it is definately a new family favorite!

This was delicious, even with the mistake I made.  I thought it said 1 1/2 cups of half and half and I was thinking that was too much so I put in 3/4 cup of half and half and 3/4 cup of milk, and then I realized it said only 1/2 cup half and half.  So what I did was not cook my egg noodles and put the uncooked noodles in the pan while everything was simmering and it turned out to work out perfect!  This is a new favourite at my house!

This was a great, easy recipe.  It was a little bland, so I added a couple dashes of Tabasco Chipotle Hot Sauce and it was absolutely wonderful!  This one's a keeper.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did use spaghetti noodles so it was more like a spaghetti bake.  It was a different take on serving spaghetti and it looked really good when it came out of the oven.  I didn't add salt because too much salt isn't good for you and I didn't use italian seasoning because I don't have it and lastly, I didn't use rosemary because I don't like it.  I seasoned mine with pepper, dried oregano, dried thyme and dried basil.  I just eyeballed it to what was equivalent of 2 total tsp. of seasoning.  At the end, I'm also pretty sure I put more than 1/3 cup of parmesan cheese on top.  I definitely plan on making this meal again and I feel that it is VERY kid friendly.

I always try to make recipes exactly according to the directions in order to rate, but I had to make some substitutions today based on what was on hand.  Overall, it was a definitely YUM!  Baked pasta always is!  It was an easy recipe with good taste. Thanks for the recipe!

Pretty good, but a little salty for us. my youngest wouldn't touch it, and he's normally all over anything with noodles in it.

This was good comfort food.  I followed the recipe. The only thing that I changed was I added shredded mozzarella cheese to the top before covering and baking.  I also baked it for 20 minutes because the natives were getting restless.  My family enjoyed it and I will make it agian.

Yum, the whole family loves this meal.  I love the creamy tomato texture.  I use ground turkey instead and it is wonderful.

We very much enjoyed this. I did, however, sub ground turkey for the ground beef; it needed to be used up. I didn't have half and half so I had to sub 1/2 T melted butter and milk to equal the 1/2 C called for.  Will do this again but I'd also like to use the ground beef as called for.

this sounded like a recipe my mom used to make and I never found her recipe for it.  I really enjoyed this as did my husband.  Only thing I would do is make sure to use a lean beef.  I only had 80% on hand and it was a bit fatty for my taste.  I did not add the salt and pepper (forgot) but it was fine, added a dash of salt at the table.  Also used egg noodles which was nice with this, glad I had them on hand from a pot roast I made I  can't imagine using plain spaghetti definitely a wider soft noodle works best.   Will definitely make again

This is a great base that is quick to make and easy to customize. It's also a great way to sneak more vegetables into dinner. 5 stars!

I would give this 4.5 stars with the changes I had to make. I relaized too late that I had no spag suce (how'd that happen??) So I had to use Cream of Tomato and more half-and-half. I also used fusilli because I had no egg noodles. The kids gobbled it up. I might like it better with the actual spag sauce the recipe calls for; I don't know. I made it for the kids, though, and they loved it.

instead of the packaged powdered gravy; i used canned beef broth and added 2heaping tblspoon flour to make gravy. and instead of spaghetti sauce; i used tomato soup  with 2 tblspoon water and i had no rosemary so i used thyme, parsley and oregano. and instead of egg noodles i used whole wheat spaghetti noodles
My children are allergic to dairy so i used soy milk at .5 of the half cup required for half-&-half - and there is also dairy in the powdered gravy packages too.

we loved this recipe. very easy. i didn't have half-half creme so i just used 2% milk and it turned out fine. yes, it's just like "hamburger helper" but hamburger helper tastes so fake and gross to me. this tastes homemade and we will definately make it again. yes, it takes a little more time than hambuger helper, but it's worth it.

My family just loved this recipe.  I used ground turkey in place of beef.  I didn't have any half and half, so used a splash of milk instead.  Forgot to add salt and pepper but it tasted delicious.  Will definitely make again.

This is delicious.  I made it with 1% milk, just a little under the 1/2 cup that it calls for with cream, and canned spaghetti sauce.  I had to use pork gravy as that's what I had in the cupboard.  I just pulled it from the oven and it tastes like spaghetti/lasagna casserole.  I can't imagine my kids not eating this.  I will find out tomorrow when I pack it in their lunches for school!

Thanks for sharing this!  This is going in my regular recipe box--a rarity for new recipes!

Update: Kids loved it!  Even ate the leftovers.

This was awesome... I made a few changes though. I only had a little over half a jar of spaghetti sauce so i poured some tomato sauce in it to fill it up & mixed it up, that turned out good I just wish I would have cooked it a little longer to thicken it a little more. I was out of onion, next time I will be sure to add that, as well some mushrooms, or even some sausage (that would've made it even better.) I also took another person's suggestion to add some tabasco sauce, that was a good choice. It gave this recipe exactly what it was missing. I'll definitely be making this again it was great everyone here loved it.

Any time my whole family will eat a dish without multiple promptings from the parents, it gets 5 stars!  My young children are very picky and they really enjoyed this meal...therefore as the mother of said picky eaters, I also really enjoyed this meal!

Made as submitted, I found it to be very bland. I liked the idea though. Next time I will try it with cream cheese and more spices.

No one in my family liked this.  We are not picky eaters but not impressed.  Lots of leftovers that were not saved.  Another reviewer stated it taste like Hamburger Helper.  We will take Hamburger Helper over this any day.  Sorry.

This was a hit! I used four cheese spaghetti sauce because that was all I had and I omitted the rosemary because I was out of it. My son cleaned his plate and my husband asked for seconds and said I should definitely make it again!

This was ok, but it tasted just like Hamburger Helper, with about three times as much work put into it.

My family really liked it.  I was curious about the gravy mix and spaghetti sauce together, but it worked. I wish I would have put the entire jar of sauce in though.

Easy and delicious! The only reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars is because this amount of food only feeds 4 people, not 6. It just wasn't enough even for 5.

I have made this recipe multiple times for my boyfriend and for company, everyone loves it! I usually double the recipe and make a huge casserole if I have a bunch of people coming over. I usually use ziti or penne instead of the egg noodles. The gravy cuts the acidity of the tomato sauce which is nice if you don't want a super strong tomato flavor.

I was expecting more than a typical marinara pasta dish, with the addition of gravy and cream.  However I thought it was rather bland.  Not a bad flavor, but tasted like a baked ziti recipe toned down, which was a little disappointing.  I felt the extra ingredients' flavors just got lost and were wasted.
