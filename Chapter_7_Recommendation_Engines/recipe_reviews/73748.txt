We love this in my house.  I think I have it memorized, I make it so much.  I use 1 lb of tofu since there's only two of us, and add 3 tsps garlic.  I also use ground ginger because it tastes the same as fresh (I made it with fresh ginger the first time I made it.) and I always have it on hand.

I make something alot like this. Instead we drain the tofu, cube it, heat the pan and add some olive oil, then saut√©ed the tofu for about twenty minutes, when its 5 minutes from being finished i add low sodium soy sauce about 2 inches or more of fresh ginger (i love ginger thats prob. too much for most ppl)and minced garlic and cook it for the last 5 mins. I always eat it over jasmine rice. Its a very similar recipe.

This was great!  I added sesame seeds for some additional flavor, and stir-fried veggies in the sauce that was left in the wok.  I will definitely make this again.

pretty bland as is , you really need to pan fry the tofu with onion then add carrots and some mushrooms. I then added chicken broth with some corn startch and had a great sauce.

This is a great recipe for beginners like me.  I had never cooked with tofu before and found this dish easy to prepare and delicious.  I topped the dish with fresh spring onion and also the dry fried version found at Asian grocery stores.  Thanks for posting this recipe.  I'll definitely prepare this again.

We enjoyed this but it was a little bland at first.  I added some garlic powder, extra tamari and about a tablespoon of peanut butter during the last 10 minutes of cooking.  I think this helped make it a little more flavorful.

We really liked this recipe. I used 1 lb. of tofu since there are only 2 of us. I used ground ginger and I added some honey (diluted in hot water) towards the end. Mixed with sauteed veggies over sushi rice - Yum! It heats up really well, too.

Great asian inspired taste of ginger and garlic, the lime added a lot, completing the dish. I liked it a lot but my husband rated it slightly less enthusiastically.

This was pretty good. My son is a football player, and aside from us trying to eat more healthy meals, we're trying to incorporate more good proteins in our diets. I made this last night and served it straight, along with stuffed squash blossoms and a chilled ginger fruit soup. It went together rather nicely. I think this a good base tofu recipe that can be used in/with many other dishes. Anything my son eats and says is good, is worth making again. :)

Rerally great!  Left out the tamari, didn't have any.  Also forgot to squirt with lime juice, and instead added soy sauce.  Sauteed exra ginger and garlic for more zing.  Only used 1 lb tofu, which made more than enough for a family of 4.  Served over cooked rice and stir fry veggies such as green pepper, carrots, mushrooms, onions, and pineapple.  I used this as the main course, with Easy Japanese Steakhouse Soup by Cooking kid for an "appetizer".  Yum, yum, yum, yum!

Plain.  Really, really plain.  
In order to not have to throw it out I made a lot of changes to the recipe.  I added soy sauce, more ginger, more garlic, some sambal olek, some frozen veggies (peas & carrots is what I had on hand), some chopped up water chestnuts and then some dashes of sesame oil at the end of cooking.  It wasn't amazing with my changes but at least we could eat it.

I give it 3 stars due to it being bland.  I followed the directions as is and then added extra garlic, ginger, and soy sauce at the end.  Once I tippled the garlic, ginger, and tamari, added a pinch of red pepper flakes, I LOVED IT!  I also used extra firm Tofu.  Served with steamed rice and vegetables.

The combination of garlic and ginger was amazing with tofu.  There a just a few things I had to change so that the dish actually had flavor.  I have found that when eating food with rice it needs a little more salt so you can actually still taste the protein.   I added a 1/2 teaspoon of soy sauce to add to the flavor.  I personally really like a little bit of sesame oil for all of the tofu dishes I make and I also added sesame seeds based on the recommendation from another reviewer.  I will definitely be making this dish again...or at least my variation of it! :)

My husband like this more than I.  I would give it 3.  Not bad, but I agree with others that it's a bit bland.  I only used one 14oz. container of tofu and used the full amount of everything else.  Next time I'm going to double the ginger, garlic and tamari.  I also added broccoli to the pan to steam for the last 10 minutes.  It's definitely worth another try!

If you are a tofu lover this easy recipe will be a staple in your house.  As I did not have fresh ginger, I used powdered, and I did not have tamari so I use soy sauce.  What is especially great about this recipe is you can really flavor it to taste.  I added scallions, smoked paprika, and some chili sauce as I like it hot.  This would be great served over noodles or rice.  You could marinate the tofu in the tamari for an hour instead of cooking it for 30 min for softer tofu.

We liked it. I only wish I knew why you cook the tofu for so long. I would think it would absorb the garlic/ginger oil imediatlly and and heat through in about ten minutes.

I followed this recipe exactly, except I only used 24 oz of tofu, rather than 32. It still turned out pretty bland, and did not look nearly as seasoned as the picture shows.  I ended up adding some rice I had cooked the previous day to the skillet with the tofu, and cooked some broccoli & baby corn to add to it. I also added a bit of basil, parsley, and black pepper and it turned out pretty nicely.  I would make this again, but only if I cooked it the way I did this time. If it was that bland with 24 oz of tofu, I can't imagine how it would be if I used the recommended 32oz.

Fabulous!! I will have to play around with this recipe a little because the tofu didn't cook like I wanted it to. I'm going to try to make triangles instead of cubes or maybe not try to cook so many at once. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I am giving the an average rating because it was only a piece to a larger (and absent) meal.  These need to be in "something" a salad, stir fry, or something else.  Also I would not recommend using store bought minced garlic (mince it yourself).  The store bought garlic took on a burnt flavor.  I put the ginger through a cheese grader instead of mincing it, and if I did the same with the garlic, I think it may have been okay.  Besides the minor burnt taste, I think the tofu was great!  Unfortunately, I ate all eight servings and was still hungry.

I'm not sure what I did wrong but this turned out tasteless.  I even tried more garlic, more ginger and tamari after I realized that it had no flavor.  I think part of the problem is I had no "juice" as one reviewer had mentioned.  I too halfed the recipe since I'm the only tofu eater.  Maybe if I had cut the tofu into smaller pieces?  Or added water? At least it was salvagable as it had no flavor, I just used it in another dish.

A nice gluten free recipe. Very good and easy. I did change it up a bit. I used sesame oil, then made a marinade out of the ingredients adding some chili peppers and baked it. The lime was a great addition, it goes so nicely with the garlic and ginger. Thank you Syd for your recipe.

Great tofu recipe! I also added onions as one of the comments recommended, as well as extra garlic. This is the first tofu I had my parents try and they loved it as well.

I would at least triple everything but the tofu next time. Cooking it in a cast iron skillet made the outside perfectly crispy

This is a great basic recipe for creating tofu stir-fry for dinner.  I have little experience cooking tofu- and this came out great.  I added snow peas and a spicy peanut sauce during the last 5 mins of cooking time.  Served over rice noodles.  Yummy!

I loved it! I didn't have any tamari so I just used soy sauce. It tasted just as great!

Loved this recipe.  It is much like the tofu I used to eat while living in Japan.  We made this recipe along with the Japanese Spinach with Sweet Sesame Seeds by another memeber and it was perfect.

Made it for the first time.  After reading reviews I decided to add sliced baby carrots, green beans, 1tbsp peanut butter and 1tbsp massaman curry paste to last 10 mins of cooking time.  Delicious!! Served with white rice.

This was my first time making a tofu dish - I'm trying to find ways to prepare it so that I'll actually enjoy tofu instead of plug my nose and swallow. I found that the ginger and garlic burned by the time the tofu was cooked (20-30 min) and by the time everything it was done, the dish didn't have much flavor. It smelled amazing all the way though but fell flat on delivery. Any suggestions for next time?

I don't know what I did wrong, but I had no 'juice' for the tofu to soak in for half an hour.  Maybe I needed to use a smaller pan?  I halved the recipe and only cooked the tofu for about 10 minutes or so.  I added veggies and hokkein noodles and it really had no flavour.  The reviews have been good for it, so I must have done something wrong.
