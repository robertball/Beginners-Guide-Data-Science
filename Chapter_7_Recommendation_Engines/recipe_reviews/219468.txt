This was a delicious sandwich.  I changed it a little but loved it.  Round steak is a tough cut of meat to use whole  so used a tri tip and sliced it.  Didn't like the thought of cold mushrooms and onions so I did not weight it down and just ate it hot.  Loved it.  thanks so much for posting the recipe

Amazingly simple but tastes so good. You donâ€™t even need the garlic but will try it next time.
