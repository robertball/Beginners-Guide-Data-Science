I actually made mine without raisins or walnuts and boy are they yummy! I made a quick caramel sauce to serve over the top and am considering trying apple pie filling as a "sauce" next time we heat some up. These freeze well, just make sure to reheat them by STEAMING (microwave/stove-top), because dry heat will dry them out.

I ate these in Mexico and was thrilled to see the recipe here!  They served these for breakfast and sometimes puried strawberries (very few..mainly just for the color and very mild taste) and added them to this recipe.  YUMMY!

My husband was pleased with these. I did use golden raisins with dried cherries instead of walnuts and raisins. My family was truly pleased. Goes great with a hot cup of mexican chocolate'.
