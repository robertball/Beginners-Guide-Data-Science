This is so fast and easy! I cubed my meat, used probably double the amount of frozen veggies which were stir fry mix (we love veggies), and i added 1/4 cup soy sauce rather than 1 T. Also added some sesame oil which added a nice flavor. I will make this over and over and it can be changed up as easy as replacing the type of meat or veggies. Cream soup is something i always have in my pantry.

I also used seaseme seed oil.. And to make this more "oriental" I added a 1/2 cup of peanut butter with the COC soup and sprinkled the finished product with seasame seeds... Yummy

I give this five stars simply because it was delicious and crazy quick to make. Albeit, I used leftovers to make it and canned chicken...it was still wonderfully delicious. Even my insanely picky 6 year old ate it (and he hates anything to do with rice). I admit, I used canned chicken and canned green beans...but I also used jasmine rice which really added a nice little background sweetness (I love jasmine rice). I totally recommend this, if nothing else...it is super quick.

This recipe was quick and edible, but it didn't seem oriental to me at all. My boyfriend and I agreed that this tasted like southern chicken and rice with soy sauce in it. This would probably be a good base recipe for chicken and rice, but the Asian ingredients made it taste weird to us.

This recipe was very bland. The only reason I didn't rate it with one star was because it WAS edible. I won't be making this recipe again though. I'm disappointed.

a little saucy for our taste so I added the extra sauce to some plain rice and the rice was quite tasty too.

This is the easiest meal I have ever made! I added some fresh broccoli, some garlic, & a bit of cornstarch (to thicken it just a little).  Yummy!

It was very bland,not enough sauce. Would make it again,but add some red bell peppers,pineapple or mandarin oranges. Might add some orange marmalade to make it more oriental. Definiately not a good recipe as written.

This was an alright meal. I served with asian noodles instead of brown rice. Also I used fresh veggies instead of frozen. I doubled the Chicken Soup (as one can really made it seem dry). Another poster mentioned using peanut butter, so I tried this. I liked it ALOT so did my toddler daughter (she loves PB). 
Might not make again in the future, but at least I tried it.

No french onion rings!? Lucky you!!! Great flavor and nice save! Ground ginger worked well. Good for you, if you go low sodium soup and soy sauce, but great flavor if you don't. You decide!!

Easy to make but no spectacular.  I am sure one can find something that is just as easy to make but also much more flavorful.

Very easy and tasty too.  I didn't have the ground ginger, so substituted fresh (used quite a bit, since we love the flavor of ginger), and used peas instead of green beans - it was very good.  It totally disappeared!  I love the idea of trying so many different things like broccoli, and sesame oil and even peanut butter to change the flavor - thanks to all for your suggestions!

This is a delicious and easy dish.  I used broccoli instead of beans.  Virtually any oriental veggie can be added.

My husband and I liked this recipe.  One out of two of my kids liked it.  It was an easy recipe to make for me and I don't cook a lot.  You can taste the ginger in it and the cream of chicken soup really made the chicken tender.  I will make this again for my family.

It was so easy to make and my husband really liked this! I did modify it a little, instead of cream of chicken I used Campbell's cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic and I used mixed frozen vegetables.

Will definitely be making this again!

Excellent recipe. I made it for my girlfriend. It was so easy, and it turned out delicious. Think maybe next time I would substitute a different veggie, or perhaps some mixed vegetables.
