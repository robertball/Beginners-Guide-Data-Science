I love this recipe.  I used my own pasta recipe (2 eggs, 1tbsp olive oil, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup all purpose flour - which I doubled for this recipe).  I used a food processor to mix and knead the dough and then let sit for at least one hour.   For the salmon mousse, I tried to follow the recipe as closely as possible but I did substitute Fat Free Evaporated Milk for the cream.  Nevertheless, it turned out delicious!!  If you are using fresh pasta dough, it is sticky enough to seal the ravioli closed especially if you press the edges closed with a fork - brushing with beaten egg just makes a sticky mess, especially if you are storing the ravioli in the fridge for a while.  Also, I only used about 3/4 of the mousse before I ran out of pasta.   I also noticed that, if there was a break in the ravioli dough, that the smoked salmon mousse did not leak out at all - it cooks beautifully inside the pasta and stays in!! Next time I will NOT seal the ravioli with egg, I will make more dough and I will roll the dough even thinner.  I would not hesitate to use the Fat Free Evaporated Milk again either.   Finally, after draining the ravioli, I brushed with a little olive oil and sprinkled a little shredded Italian cheese over and served hot.

It was easy to prepare and delicious. I did some changes. First, I used a different dough. Hudgson Mill has a pasta flour (a mix of semolina and durum
). At the back of the box there is a pasta recipe and it turns out very nice. Anyway, that dough worked very well but you will need to double that recipe for 1 lb of salmon, or vice versa. I substituted cream with half amount milk, I think it made the mousse lighter (in terms of fat). After all we enjoyed it :)

This is a wonderful alternative to the traditional cheese or meat ravioli. I made this recipe with out altering it. It was incredible. I come from a large Sicilian family and doubled the recipe everyone was more than pleased that night!!

The Guyere cheese sauce is excellent but the salmon mousse came out runny (recommend less cream or more salmon). Overall very tasty though!

This was a delicious recipe; although it was extremely rich, so pair it with a really light side dish or salad. I was short on time so I used wonton wrappers for the dough, which worked nicely.

Fantastic.  I had to make much more pasta dough than the recipe called for, which probably means my pasta was too thick.  It was still great, though.

This was good, but had a few things that compromised the dish overall. First of all, the pasta was awfully stiff, perhaps I didn't roll it thin enough, but I think there may be better pasta dough recipes available that would be worth a try. It is also a lot of work to make this recipe. The final product is very pretty, but very, very rich. I had an enormous amount of the smoked salmon mousse left over so I think I'll use it to stuff some pasta shells or something.

Oh soooo goooood.  It was fun to make the ravioli from scratch.  And the smoked salmon was perfect.  This is very filling so just add a salad for a complete meal.

This was OUTSTANDING!! Every bite was incredible!!! I didn't have time to make the pasta so I bought lasagna sheets, they didn't stick very well so next time I will make the pasta.  After filling the pasta, we sauteed the sauce on the stove with the ravilois instead of broiling.  One of the best I have EVER had!!

We had this for Christmas Dinner and my family ate so much that they didn't eat desert.  I made my regular pasta recipe 1:1 egg to cup of flour and oil.  I used this for the filling.  The Gruyere cheese was great.  We never had Gruyere before but I am sure we will get it again now.  Thanks for the recipe.

As I had no time to make the pasta myself I used some fresh pasta sheets.  But in doing this I found problems with making the pasta stick to itself, so I changed this recipe into more of a lasanga type dish and this turned out great.  Next time I'll just cook the pasta a bit beforehand so the salmon doesnt over cook.

Heavenly! I wasn't sure what kind of smoked salmon I could use. All I could find were the thin smoked lox. And the only Gruyere cheese that was left after the holiday rush was smoked. I was concerned that the salmon was too thin to use and there would be too much smoked flavor but it all turned out beautifully!
