The preparation of the eggplant makes all the difference.  I've tried other eggplant lasagna recipes, and they were disappointing.  The eggplant was either overdry and tough or gooey.  In either case, it stood out and didn't "pass" as well for pasta.

I prefer to peel the eggplant and slice it lengthwise into strips the approximate width of a lasagna noodle.  Start with the strips a little wider than the size you wish them to be, as they will shrink in the over. 

Other than using eggplant instead of noodles, you can follow your own lasagna recipe.  I like to mix thawed, chopped frozen spinach (which has been COMPLETELY drained and squeezed dry) into ricotta (or cottage) cheese, along with an egg and some shredded parmesan, to use as one of the layers.   I also like using Sargento's 6-cheese Italian better than straight mozzarella.  Less stringy and more depth of flavor.

I will not change the ingredients but would recommend changing some of the portions.  I gues it depend on the size of the eggplant though.  My family love cheze.  I ended up using about 2lbs of gr bef and about 6 cups of cheese all day.  Turned out great!

Great recipe! Huband -who is new to eggplant loved it. So its a great intro for people unframilar to eggplant. But watch that eggplant when your baking eggplant slices the oven I would cook half the time. Burn fast! But still good.

A decent, base recipe.  I added low fat ricotta cheese and substituted 1 lb. of sauteed, sliced mushrooms for the hamburger to make it vegetarian.  I also put all of the Parmesan cheese on top, rather than in the breading mix, to increase the "baked," crusty, cheesy top.

I loved this recipe, but made changes to make it gluten free.  Since I was cooking for only my husband and me I used only one eggplant. I coated the eggplant slices (sliced vertically) with the egg/water mixture and dipped them in ground pecans and parmesan instead of the breadcrumbs. I have been using ground pecans and parmesan to bread chicken and fish as well. Pecans remain crisp and lend a nice crunchy texture and good taste. I also used bottled spaghetti sauce and seasoned the beef with 1 tsp. each of salt, fennel seed, and red pepper flakes along with a pinch of ground black pepper. The fennel gives the beef an Italian sausage flavor.  In the lasagna layers I added a layer of ricotta mixed with one egg.  The result was wonderful and gluten free.

D-lish! I made a half batch of this the night before and popped it into the oven for about 20-25min (a little extra time since it started cold), until it was bubbly. It turned out Great. The flavors melded well and even my picky kids ate some. We'll definitely have this again. 

Half batch was plenty for us 2 adults and 2 kids ages 3 & 18mo.. We still had enough to take for lunch the next day for both adults.

Awesome! I loved the way the eggplant was prepared and so did my kids!! I pulsed some onion, squash, and mushrooms (whatever I had in the fridge) in the processor and added it to the beef. It is a dish I feel good about serving to my family and they absolutely loved it! We now call it 'Sneaky Lasagna' since it is packed full of vegetables, but tastes like traditional lasagna, only better!

This is a wonderful dish! And my family loves eggplant cooked this way so much that now I don't even bother putting the lasagna together - they eat the eggplant up before I can assemble!!!

First time I have tried egg plant.  Not bad........ I did make a few things, some of it to clean out my fridge.  Cut the egg plant thicker than 1/2", probably around 3/4".  Made the egg plant coating but used just enough to coat the slices.  Used the balance to sprinkle on top of the sauce on each layer.  With the sauce, added hot Italian sausage, some chorizo, and I had some tomatoes that were getting soft, (approx 4), so I chopped them, chunky, and added those as well. I also chopped up some mushrooms that I also had left over from another dish.  Added, parsley, italian seasoning, and salt and pepper to taste.

I tried this recipe for the first time last week and my family loved it! I gave it a bit of an East African twist .I love it because it is healthy and inexpensive! I made my tomato sauce from scratch using fresh tomatoes, onions, parsley, basil, pepper , soy sauce, garlic and Kenyan sausages. Since cheese is expensive in Kenya, I made a cheese sauce using Kenyan Highland's Cheddar cheese, milk, and flour. This way there was enough cheese to make two layers. On the top, I sprinkled cheese over the cheese sauce followed by home made bread crumbs. I also added E.African spices like coriander spice mix and dried chillies. The whole family went to bed satisfied and with a smile on their faces! That's what i love to call cooking from the soul!

I got the eggplant real crispy in the oven and it translated well when I baked everything.  My guests loved it!  The only thing that was off for me was the amount of bread crumbs and parmesan cheese - I ended up throwing out a lot becuase it was too much.  I would get really large eggplants and cut the parm cheese and crumbs size to half cup each.

This was delicious!  We added ricotta cheese and chopped spinach with the cheese mixture, and substituted ground turkey and a little Italian sausage for the beef. Yummy! We will be making this again.  Since my husband doesnt eat pasta, this dish really made us both happy.  Even if you dont care for eggplant, it's not real obvious.  I agree with the other reviews, the preparation of the eggplant is key.  It seems like a lot of work, but it really does make a difference.

Excellent!  My husband told me this is the best meal I've ever made.  I have to say, though, that this is best eaten right away after cooking.  This is definitely not a cook-ahead recipe.  The leftovers left a lot to be desired.

I have made this many times.  I slice my eggplant length wise like a noodle.  I also add cottege cheese and ricotta cheese just like you would making Lasagna with noodles.  Sauce on the bottom of the casserol dish and then the eggplant sauce cottege cheese, ricotta cheese and Mozz. cheese.  Then eggplant and repeat till it is just the eggplant and sauce and Mozz cheese on top.  My husband now likes this better than using lasagna noodles.

Excellent recipe! Seems like it will be bland but is very flavorful. Was concerned about not salting and draining the eggplant, it wasn't necessary. I did add some garlic to the sauce and some extra cheese. But those were really my only changes. Very good my whole family enjoyed it.

Loved it! Made a half batch for two of us- had plenty of leftovers! I used a jar of Bertolli marinara (highly recommend) mixed in with the meat. Only cooked for 15 minutes on first side and 10 after I flipped (olive oil on pan toasted the flipped side)

Two things: 1)If you use the Dinner-Spinner app to create a shopping list for this, it changes amounts. The list had me buy 3 eggplants instead of 2, and only 3 oz of Parmesan. I didn't notice the discrepancy until after I'd sliced up all 3 eggplants. Good thing we like eggplant; I'll just bake them up by themselves.
2) The prep time apparently assumes that the eggplants magically peel and slice themselves, as it took me a good 20 minutes just to accomplish this, slicing them length-wise to make noodle-like strips. (Admittedly, my husband had accidentally thrown away the good peeler, leaving me to use the one that bends out of shape if you push down too hard, but still!)
That said, it did turn out to be very tasty. I might try it again - after I buy a very sturdy vegetable peeler!

All right, this is a good starting recipe. A couple of tips. Dip the eggplant in flour first and then dip it in the egg wash and then the bread crumbs. The crumbs adhere better. Also wet or moisten the eggplant with a little water. That helps the  flour adhere to the eggplant.  Also I baked the eggplant for a 15 minutes but then I broiled it to make sure it was crispy. If you broil it makes sure you can watch it carefully.

I made this last night.  Super easy!   I substituted the ground beef for ground chicken and a package of Italian turkey sausage (casings removed).   Before cooking the meat I sautéed two garlic cloves to the skillet.  It was so good!  Even my eight year old loved it!!

Wonderful!! I subbed ground turkey as I'm not a big fan of ground beef and probably used about twice the breadcrumbs/cheese. If you're using 2 whole eggplants you'll probably need more as well.

I also sliced lengthwise as recommended by another reviewer and found it worked really well!

Delicious and my fiance loved it!

Best eggplant lasagna I ever made.  I made half the recipe (table for one please), added 1 layer of lasagna noodles for a base, added 1 zucchini and mushrooms to the meat sauce (food processed), used a big can of crushed tomatoes, and one small ricotta.  Yummy!  All gone.  No leftovers.  Me bad.

Absolutely delicious.  Breading the eggplant was kind of a pain but SOOO worth it.  We  love  cheese so  I doubled it but otherwise followed the directions exactly.  Next time I will skip the salt  because the cheese is salty enough.  A definite winner.

This was amazing! I made it gluten free by using gluten free breadcrumbs and omitted the parmesan and used my own sauce recipe. Better than regular lasagne as far as I'm concerned! Hubby loved it too. Thank you for posting this recipe. I will make it again and again.

Well I followed this recipie almost to it's entirety. For those who were wondering if you cut this lasagna into 8 pieces it has 440 calories a slice. Olive garden lasagba has double that. My wife and I are really cutting calories so this was the only way to to enjoy lasagna. I did completely omit olive oil it adds 300 calories to the dish. I instead used cooking spray. Honestly I wasn't expecting much because egg plant from what I heard was disgusting. THIS DISH TASTES BETTER than many real lasagnas I have eaten elsewhere. My only 2 compaints is the olive oil is totally not necessary and i used a 9x13 baking dish like the recipie said and berely had enough egplant for 2 rows. GREAT DISH

This is a good recipe. I made a few changes. I cut down the bread crumbs/parmessan cheese mix to half a cup each and it was enough. I used 4 medium eggplants instead of 2 large ones just because that's what I had at home. 
Finally, the cooking times. I read some of the other reviews that said the cooking times were too much, so I cooked the eggplants 20 min on one side and 10 the other side and it turned out just fine.
Other than that, this recipe is very good.

I loved this but unfortunately the picky husband and kids did not.  I think they were biased against the idea of eggplant more so than the taste though.  Only changes were to use ground turkey rather than beef and panko instead of regular bread crumbs (since I was out). I was particularly impressed with the texture of the eggplant after baking - not too soft or too firm - just perfect.

loved this recipe. I never had eggplant before so thought I would try it. I think the roasted eggplant was the difference between mushy and firm. I did not add the parmesan(to cut calories)but used drops of ricotta on middle layer then topped with a little parmesan after baking.

This is a great recipe and easy to adjust for vegetarians. I substituted veggie protein crumbles instead of ground beef. Next time, I think I will try a layer of assorted mushrooms instead of the veggie protein crumbles because I always seem to have those on hand. Mine was super salty, I'm unsure why. I plan on making it again for a Thanksgiving entree.

I took advice from some that posted - cut eggplant lengthwise and also used mushrooms instead of meat as my daughter is a vegetarian.  I also used a ricotta/cottage cheese, mozzarella, egg, parmesan cheese mixture as a layer.  My daughter spruced up the spaghetti sauce by adding some cooked garlic, onion & carrots with the mushrooms.  This meal was delicious!

This was very good! I did adjust to make it gluten free.  I used almond flour instead of regular flour.  I also added ricotta, frozen spinach thawed (squeezed of moisture). I also added onion and garlic powder to the meat while it cooked.  I also cut the eggplant into strips rather than rounds and used three eggplants instead of two so it made a larger amount.  Everyone loved it!

Followed recipe closely, using shredded romano instead of parmesan.  Sauce partly homemade... some canned spaghetti sauce, with some canned tomatoes with lots of garlic, some (less than 1 tsp. each) oregano, thyme, rosemary, tarragon, a bit of vinegar, some olive oil, some white wine, pinch of salt & pepper.  Recipe calls for 48 oz. of sauce, this recipe needs every bit of it!  On eggplant prep, change nothing; precooking eggplant makes it just right!

Absolutely delicious!   I actually prefer this version to the pasta version!

I absolutely love this recipe, and so did my family. They were arguing over who got to have seconds! I will definitely make it again, although I will say that the 20 minute prep time is only for an experience to chef. As long as I allow extra time for prep, everything else goes perfectly.

Made (almost!) no changes and it was excellent!  Cut the eggplant length-wise instead of in rounds, and added garlic powder and paprika to the breadcrumb mixture.  Also, since I made it vegetarian, I used soy "meat" crumbles and seasoned with garlic powder and Trader Joe's "Everyday Seasoning" (sea salt, mustard seeds, black pepper, coriander, onion, garlic, paprika, chilli pepper).  Tasted so good it was hard to stop eating!!

Outstanding! I did use my own meat sauce, since I already  had some made up and ready to go. The texture and consistency of the eggplant is perfect. No crazy pre-prep of sweating the eggplant and no slimy texture. Delicious and just as satisfying as traditional lasagna, minus the guilt for eating an extra slice. Definitely going in the rotation!

I also sliced the eggplant lenthwise. I only used one large eggplant but next time I will use two and make thicker slices, since they really do shrink in the oven. My only other change was to add 1 1/2 cups ricotta cheese and an egg that I mixed with the mozzarella. I used Hunt's Garlic and Herb sauce which is very low carb. The taste was great and so was the consistency. The baked eggplant absorbed more of the excess moisture than raw or pan fried eggplant.

This is a great recipe. I've only cooked an eggplant once before and it turned out awful but dipping it in the egg and seasoning and baking it was the trick to making this dish. I used crushed up rice krispies and Italian seasoning instead of breadcrumbs with the salt and pepper and cheese. Everything else was exactly as written.

This recipe was awesome!!! I used really lean meat and followed all steps. Kids and wife loved it! I cut up extra mushrooms and added it to the sauce while it simmered with the meat. Will definitely be making this again!

I loved it . I substituted a 1/3 of a lb.of ground meat with a 1/3 lb.of Italian sweet sausage.  This is a perfect recipe as is and easily adjusted to whatever taste you wanted

Loved this!  We added lasagna noodles.  I liked how meaty the eggplant tastes this way.  It took me a long time to make but there is enough for my family of three to eat for 4 different meals.  I'm betting this freezes well.  I will differently make this again.

I have been making this recipe for over a year now and the whole family loves it! I don't quite use two whole eggplants,  probably 1 1/2. I also brown hot Italian turkey sausage in place of the beef and it gives it a healthy and delicious taste! Instead of flipping the eggplant,  I turn the broiler on and it gets the job done.  A must try, even for those who aren't in love with eggplant.

I did a few spins on this, but the result was outstanding.  Instead of beef, i boiled and shredded chicken.  I also decided to cut the eggplant lengthwise so it truly mimicked lasagna pasta.  if you're not careful you can overcook the eggplant, so it's best to watch it.  I also found that I had to send out for an additional jar of marinara, there wasn't enough to fill my dish so I had to add some.   This dish is so good leftover, also.

Thank you for this awesome and creative recipe.  Takes some time to prepare but well worth it.  I have always enjoyed traditional lasagna, but I like it this way better.  I enjoyed the leftovers as well.  I did find that I didn't need the full amount of parmesan cheese and breadcrumbs....I would recommend starting with half a cup of each and adding on as necessary.

Egg plant turned out very crispy which worked well as it absorbed liquid from the sauce.  It didn't become soggy. I did add ricotta and mozzarella mixture and used chicken as the protein.  Lots of great tastes.  Will make again!

I lived in Italy for two years, and there was a restaurant that served eggplant lasagna. I have been searching for years for a recipe just like it, and I have finally found it with this recipe. This is the most delicious thing I have ever cooked.

This is a wonderful recipe for eggplant. The way it’s baked makes it delicious! I followed the recipe but added fresh chopped basil between the layers and sprinkled the left over crumbs on the top. Oh and used Italian sausage instead of ground beef! So flavorful! My new favor!!

Absolutely delicious! A real wow with the family! I must admit to adding ricotta cheese to the top layer and then covered with shredded mozzarella and a tad of Parmesan. Sooo yummy!!!

A wonderful recipe. I made in a large 9-inch square casserole using 2 medium eggplants and Italian sausage instead of the ground beef. I baked the eggplant slices on silpat which worked great. I also used fresh Mozzarella cheese slices and only made two layers. Would definitely make again. I would have added fresh basil if I had it available.

I love eggplant and I make a variety of casseroles with it. This dish was tasty and pretty easy to make. But I had a problem with the amount of the ingredients! The 2 large eggplants weren't enough to make even 2 layers in a 9x13 pan. I had to switch to a 7x11 pan and even then I was only able to make 2 layers. Because of that I had too much meat sauce leftover and less cheese was needed. If I make this again, I would either keep the eggplant amount the same , using smaller pan and cut down the pasta sauce and the cheese, or add another large eggplant, with more breading ingredients.

I made this sans meat, threw in some cabbage leaves and cottage cheese and loved it!  I had leftover Parmesan cheese and breadcrumb mix, which I simply threw on top of the uppermost layer of mozzarella cheese - which turned out wonderfully crusty!  Will definitely make again!

We were given an eggplant, but didn't know what to do with it. My husband had never had eggplant. I made is according to directions, and he LOVED it! Next time I will make it more like a traditional lasagna, having an egg and cottage cheese layer.

First time ever trying eggplant lasagna and I loved it. The only thing I changed was I used ground turkey instead of beef and added ricotta cheese. Easy recipe to follow and make definitely will be making more.

I don’t do reviews very often but this was absolutely worth it! I added thin slices of zucchini and did the same thing to it as the eggplant and added in Italian dried herbs to the bread. Dumb mixture and sautés garlic and onions in the pan before adding the beef. Cooked everything the same as directed. So yummmmmy!! Thank you

This recipe has become  one of our staples. I love making a pan of this lasagna for my husband and I. We always have plenty for leftovers, and it's delicious reheated in the oven! I am gluten-free, so I just substitute gluten free Panko for the seasoned breadcrumbs.

This was the best lasagna I have ever made, and the first time using eggplant!   I added some garlic and onions to my sauce but followed the directions otherwise.  I like the big, thick chuncks of eggplant.

I added chicken sausage and garlic to the tomatoe sauce for one of the casseroles.  I left one without meat.   
I didn’t have mozzarella cheese and substituted provolone and a cheddar mix.  My vegetarian and meat eating members really liked the meal.

Used my own spaghetti meat sauce and eliminated bread crumbs. Used more parmesan. Eggplant was delicious all by itself after roasting. Layered a half cup of Alfredo with the mozzarella. 
Keto frIendly and wonderful.  Thanks.

I recently had this dish at a local Italian restaurant and was in search for a recipe to replicate at home.  

This was absolutely delicious!  I made a few modifications.  

1. Cut it lengthwise and didn’t peel the eggplant.  Used the ends with the peels for the bottom layer—peel side down.

2. After browning ground beef added 1 clove of fresh, minced garlic and fresh mushrooms and simmered on low until mushrooms cooked through. 

3.  In between each layer, I added ricotta cheese (gotta have ricotta)—saved motzerella cheese for the top layer only.  

Delicious!

This was very good!  we used veggie meatballs instead of ground beef, and stuck it under the broiler for 2 minutes at the end to crisp up the cheese.  yum!

This was sooo good. I added onions and garlic and my own homemade meat sauce. The flavor is exceptional. Baking the eggplant first is a must. Watch it so it doesn’t burn. I baked at 375 degrees then flipped after 20 min. This recipe is a keeper thanks!

This was brilliant! The key is def the eggplant treatment per another reviewer. I once made lasagna with slices of raw eggplant and then tried to cook the whole thing to death. I distinctly remember the eggplant being tough as shoe leather and the whole dish was not cohesive and just a major fail. The roasted and breaded eggplant takes on a natural and pleasant sweetness and the texture was fantastic. The breadcrumbs also helped to bind the dish together nicely. Per my personal tastes and what I had in the cupboard, I used panko. Also added my 3-cheese filling of ricotta, lg curd cottage and mozzarella cheeses, egg seasoning and garlic. I also used Rao marinara to reduce sugar and added about 6 oz of ground pork sausage to my meat mixture for some added pizazz. There’s a lot of room for experiment and adjustment to personal taste. I made a big enough pan to eat off all week, however the family went back for seconds and thirds, lol. Huge win and has me wanting to try other eggplant dishes now that I know the “trick”.

I added a few garlic cloves to the sauce and added a pound of ground sausage to it. I sauteed some zucchini and put it in the layers of eggplant and I added extra cheese. in the end i probably came close to doubling it. 

It was amazing. will make exactly the same way again.

Use Italian sausage for more flavor, but less eat and less sauce- makes enough to freeze. A good jarred sauce with stronger herb flavor would be nice, and layer with spinach, zucchini slices etc. cut the eggplant no thinner than 1/2” and be sure the Parmesan is grated not shredded, and replace water with milk for best coating.

I cooked eggplant slices on stovetop, and added slices of delicata squash. Also, I added a layer of ricotta, mozzarella and egg mixture. And I baked it at 340F for about 30min. The result was amazing. Yes, I’ll make it again.

I made this last weekend and substituted hot Italian turkey sausage for the ground beef. Also added one layer of ricotta missed with a little Parmesan cheese and Italian seasoning. It was fabulous and makes a large quantity.

One of the tastiest recipes I’ve tried on this site.  So good.  I did change it until a little bit.  Since I don’t eat beef, I used one package of Morningstar grillers to substitute and I added some fresh basil to the sauce. When ready to eat I topped it off with a little part skim ricotta. Mmmm!mmm!

I did the thing I hate when others do it.  Changed the recipe and now rating it.  Sorry.  However, I bet however you make this it will be delicious. I doubt I'll ever make lasagna the "old fashioned" way.  My change was to combine the mozzarella cheese with a beaten egg,  a bit or ricotta cheese, a bit of dried parsley and basil.
I only made half the recipe thinking I didn't want to waste ingredients on something I might not like.  My mistake.  :)

I didn't tell my son it was made with eggplant as I knew he wouldn't even try it if he knew.  After eating he said it was 'awesome'.  A new eggplant fan!  I made it just as written, husband loved it also.  Felt good to serve a vegetarian meal that was so satisfying.  Would definitely make again.

Everyone loved the recipe, and the pre-cooking of the eggplant was very good.  In fact, I had trouble keeping enough slices for the lasagna.  Because I use a toaster oven instead of my big oven, I had to cook the eggplant in two shifts, so that was a negative.   Otherwise, it's a keeper!

Cut the recipe in half since there are only two of us.  Have plenty for a second meal.  Love the texture of the eggplant even though it takes a while to prepare.  The sauce that I chose was on the thick side so next time I might add some additional tomato sauce.

Basic recipe using a double baking of the eggplant slices versus frying the slices and then baking. One key note, make sure eggplant is well cooked to an almost crispy when baking the slices, otherwise the lasagna cooking will be off. Plan on using extra sauce than recipe calls for.

I would highly recommend making your own tomato sauce, rather than using Prego ??.  This is basically eggplant parmesan with meat.

This is a great recipe as is. I make it for my family as often as possible. Even my picky son loves it, and he is really hard to please. It can be a little bit of a process to do all at once, so usually I separate dealing with the eggplant and putting the lasagna together into two separate cooking sessions. It still turns out wonderfully.

We love this dish - it's one of our "go to" dinners.  The only additions are chopped onions in the burger and seasoned with garlic salt, and we use a favorite marinara - Mama DiSalvos.

I used to do eggplant lasagna with raw eggplant; from now on this will be the way for me. Every one at home loved it!

I love this recipe, however made changes. Did not add meat, it over powers the eggplant. Used less parm and bread crumbs when coating the eggplant slices. I also did not find a need to peel the eggplant. I also added more parm to the dish at the end. Maybe next time I will add mushrooms. My famiy loved it!

Delicious! I used ground turkey instead of beef and Paul Neumann's tomato basil sauce. I also left the skins on the eggplant and made sure the eggplant was baked nice and crispy. I had a couple extra eggplant slices and they were soooo good just on their own! My whole family, including my picky kids gobbled this up!

I made this recipe exactly as it was instructed. My son had asked me to make it and I was intrigued as I am diabetic and this would be a good alternative to the noodles. I loved it but my son (who is 14) did not like it. He did not like the breading on the eggplant. I think it needs more seasoning but I will make this again, even if it is just for me. I will add more garlic and some hot sauce to the egg mix to give it a kick. All in all I enjoyed this dish! The cooking time was perfect and it still tasted good a couple of days later as left overs. The eggplant was soft but it didn't detract from the taste.

I made this using Bilinski's chicken sausage (Spinach & Garlic with Fennel) instead of ground beef.  Also, I added low-fat ricotta.  It's amazing!  I'm not sure I'll ever go back to using pasta because this is so good.  I sliced the eggplant lengthwise as did some of the other reviewers.  We didn't have any breadcrumbs so I used whole wheat flour with the Parmesan and I'm not sure if there'd be a whole lot of difference with the sauce, cheese & meat dominating the dish. Thank you, GENKIANNA, for this great recipe!

I made it and would recommend slicing the eggplant into thinner pieces and be sure to bake the eggplant until crispy brown. It might be more delicious if I added more seasoning to the breading you dip the eggplant in. Overall everything turned out delicious!

Making sure that your egg plant is browned and crispy on the outside is key.  I used italian sausage instead of hamburger as that is what I had on hand and i sprinkled bacon crumbles on top just to add a bit of something to dress it.  This was phenomenal!  Definitely making it again and again

We've tried to make eggplant lasagna a few times but it always came out runny. With the baked preparation of the eggplant in this recipe, it came out perfect! It could be one of the best things I've ever made. We did make a few changes; we used ground turkey instead of ground beef and we put a thin layer of Siggi's plain greek yogurt in the middle layer of cheese. I would of used cottage cheese if I had it but Siggi's was the next best thing. I'd recommend trying this recipe if you're looking for a healthier alternative to traditional lasagna.

Girlfriend said she loved it. I added mushrooms, Ricotta and cottage cheese and some dill. I also used ground turkey instead of beef. It held together nice. She could be lying but she ate the whole thing in 3 days so I'd say it was a hit. I'll add spinach next time.

This tasted much better than I thought it would. Four stars b/c I changed a fair amount (and halved recipe): sliced eggplant lengthwise, added onion, garlic and red pepper flakes to meat; added fresh mushrooms and cottage cheese to mozz. cheese. Layered twice, final cover with mozz. cheese only. Didn't realize until too late that final bake is 15 min so mushrooms were a bit al dente, but very good dish overall.

My father said it's the best lasagna he's ever had. I made a few changes: used ground turkey- and spread ricotta on each slice of cooked eggplant using an icing spatula. 

This is something I'll definitely cook again!

It turned out great, I added red, green, yellow, and orange bell peppers to the sauce, which thicken and added even more flavor to the sauce.

This was just "meh" - not a keeper in my opinion.  It was easy enough but the sauce and meat overpowered the eggplant.  Likely won't make again.

This eggplant lasagna is simple and tastes phenomenal. The first pack of ground meat I laid hands on in the freezer was homemade italian sausage made with wild game, so I used that instead of ground beef. That's the only change I made. 

The quantities in this recipe are spot on -- 2 eggplants fit perfectly into 2 layers in a 9x13 pan for me, and I only had about 1/8 cup of breading/egg left over.

The lasagna turned out saucy and satisfying. It's great as it is, but it is basic so there's lots of room for creativity. Great recipe!

Substitute water-->whole milk, beef-->chicken. I also added sauteed mushrooms and steamed spinach. The second time I made it, I used steamed kale instead of spinach. Both were good.

I have made this recipe multiple times already, and it has been good every time. I have even made it with less, and even no, parmesan with no noticeable difference in taste. It did take me some time the first time, but I'm faster now (I even leave the seeds, no one notices).

My husband really liked it, but I thought the taste of egg came through too strongly. I would add more water to the egg mixture or change it out completely. I did a spinach layer and a mushroom layer like other reviews suggested, none of which used egg. Still, it overwhelmed the whole thing. I also ran out of sauce. I would use more than 48 oz.

The whole family loved it! Did not bread the zucchini. Just sliced, peeled, and layered like regular lasagna noodles. Added sauted peppers and onions, as well as sliced tomatoes.

Love this recipe. I sliced the eggplant longways in thin slices instead of the round pieces. To my ground beef I added 1 bag of frozen spinach with all of the water drained, mushrooms, and zucchini thinly sliced. I added seasoning since I like with a lot of flavour.  This turned out amazing. Everyone really enjoyed it.

Love this recipe! I like to slice the eggplant thinner than written and slice long ways instead of rounds. Also I mix half ground beef half Italian sausage.

This egg plant lazagna was amazing! It was a little labour intensive but worth every minute! Breading and baking the egg plant first made all the difference. We loved it.

Surprisingly, this held together nicely.  It only made a 9x9 dish but it was good, albeit salty.  Next time I'll cut back on the and Parmesan and salt.  Or just eat the eggplant after baking it, sauce on the side!

Recipe was delicious! I'll definitely be making this again. Portions on the breadcrumbs and Parmesan  were way more than necessary. I was able to make due with half, completely covered the eggplant and barely wasted any crumbs.

I made this during a snow storm.  So I changed the meat and used shredded chicken.    It went to gather fast and easy.  Baked and was wonderful.

I have never liked eggplant but this recipe has made me fall in love with eggplant. It's delicious! I did use a leftover homemade spaghetti sauce and put a layer of thick sliced mozzarella. Will definitely make it again

I had Mexican cheese mix. Halved the receipe. 
So good. My wife and I kept saying "this is so good."
One eggplant made four servings. We ate two and froze the other two. 
We will make it for guests. 
It is easier than I expected.

I'm already being asked to make it again. I made a couple of changes to tailor it more to our taste. First I cooked the beef with about 1/2 cup on diced onion and a couple cloves of diced garlic. Then, I added about 1/2 a container of 15 oz. riccotta and a thawed, drained package of spinach to the mozzarella layer because we LOVE cheese and I wanted to sneak in an extra veggie. The last thing I changed was that I made the middle layer with pre-cooked lasagna noodles, instead of eggplant, because my fiance is new to eggplant and I wasn't sure how pasta-like the eggplant would turn out to be. It was excellent and tasted just like lasagna! He went back for seconds - and thirds!

Great recipe! I changed things slightly based on my family's preferences.  I used crushed tomatoes to make my homemade marinara sauce (made of steamed vegetables that I puree, then add crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and about a cup of romano cheese).  I also used ground turkey instead of beef, and added grated parmesan/romano to the mozzarella that was sprinkled in the layers.  My kids had no idea there was eggplant in this recipe, they probably ate more vegetables in this meal than they have in a long time.  This is going in my favorites.

Very delicious. I salted the bread crumbs mixture with 1/2 tsp. salt but forgot to salt the sauce. It doesn't need to be salted the second time in my opinion because the cheese adds more salt. Also I didn't have chunky tomato sauce and used (2) 14 oz. cans of Italian stewed tomatoes which worked perfect. Next time I'll bake the eggplant the day before I assemble. Thanks Genkianna.

Delicious!  My family loved this.  I work and am always on the hunt for a "make it the day before" recipes, and this works! I put it together and refrigerated it overnight and baked it when we were ready to eat dinner.  It took more like 30 minutes to bake from the fridge, which makes sense since it wasn't from room temperature.  I used panko bread crumbs instead of regular and also added some panko/parmesan mixture to the top of the whole thing.  Definitely a keeper!

I may play around with this a little but it was so good.  Took closer to two hours to make for me. I don't bread stuff much and that took more time.  Worth the time.

I have never been a big fan of eggplant but tried this recipe for a card party. Even the pasta lovers thought this recipe was fantastic! I added 2 Tablespoons of pesto to the sauce and used chicken sweet Italian sausage in place of the hamburger. I even enjoyed the scraps of baked eggplant that didn't fit in the pan. I just may be an eggplant convert!

Made this with ground beef and pork ! (Also cut the egg plant length wise like lasagna noodles) Turned out amazing just try to avoid cutting the egg plant too thin or it will burn and get hard!

no need for ground turkey in less you want protein
used pepper jack cheese instead of motz.

I love it!! I usually pan fry the eggplants and it takes a while and messy. But I love this method. I skipped the meat and was delish. Enjoy!!

First time to try this. Takes some time, but very tasty. I used plain panko with some Italian seasoning instead of seasoned bread crumbs. 
Very good.

I made this tonight and it was by far one of the best lasagna dishes my husband and I have ever had.  Not filling and heavy at all.  I used panko crumbs seasoned with Italian herbs. I also used both eggplant and young zucchini since I did not have enough eggplant.  For the sauce I used ground turkey instead of beef and seasoned my sauce with garlic and Italian seasoning. I will be making it again and again!

Took a little more than 20 minutes to prep, especially with baking the eggplant rounds in a separate step, but it was easy to put together and delicious to eat. I used Panko breadcrumbs instead of Italian which added a better texture. Some oregano and basil would need to be added to salt and pepper for the breadcrumb and cheese mixture to compensate in terms of flavor.

I have made it twice now in-spite of how time consuming it can be. I make my own gluten free bread crumbs (rice chex, French's onions & Italian seasoning), left out the parmesan and subbed the mozzarella  with Mexican cheese (queso fresco). I also used ground turkey to better suit our families dietary needs. It was delicious!!!

My whole family thoroughly enjoyed this meal. I substituted veggie crumble (meat substitute) for the beef and added the leftover breadcrumbs and Parmesan cheese into the two bottom layers. It is really like a heavy pasta sauce so I cooked some pasta to go with it. I know this might defeat the purpose of going without lasagna noodles.

I have made eggplant lasagna using this recipe five times now.  This has become a favorite in my household. Not only is it lasagna but it's also gluten-free and just good for you. I will never make regular lasagna again. I substituted the ground beef for chunks of boneless skinless chicken breast which helps to lighten the meal without removing flavor.

If I were to do this over, I would use a quarter less sauce and prepare the eggplant differently. They were mushy, so I would probably broil for a minute or two to make more crispy. Not sure if it's worth the effort. Either make regular lasagna or eggplant parmagean.

A creative and delicious alternative to traditional noodle lasagna. Added a red onion, portobello mushrooms, and garlic to a spicy marinara sauce w/ ground beef. Just follow the directions, and you’ll have a very enjoyable meal. This one goes in the Make Again_Yummy folder. Excellent recipe GENKIANNA.

Good recipe. Omitted oil and used pan spray to cut fat, also used homemade chicken sausage, egg beaters, and fat free cheese. Used jar sauce to save time. Family loved it, and we were all first timers to eggplant. Saving this recipe, and putting it regular rotation.

Don't forget to PEEL the eggplant! I also skipped the meat and used ragu rather than tomato sauce. I'm sure I made other tweeks in the recipe but it came out good and healthy!

I thought this receipe was fine and a great way to use my CSA eggplant.  Although my husband and kids didn't care for it and basically left the entire dish for me.  I made an Eggplant Parmesan dish from this site that my family loved.  Although it was time-consuming, I'll go with that dish next time.
