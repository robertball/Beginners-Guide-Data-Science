These were very good.  Instead of rolling and cutting them as individual cookies, I rolled and baked each as a large nut roll.  Made wonderful hostess gifts when visiting at the holidays.

Great recipe to base full nut rolls from.  I did, however, make tons of changes so they turned out appropriately.  Halved the dough recipe and had to double the filling.  Omit the milk.  Didn't let the dough stand overnight and had it warm when rolled out so you can roll dough very thin. Bake for 30-35 minutes.  I ended up with 6 12-18" nut rolls that were wonderful.

I've been looking for this recipe.  After I moved over 23 years ago it was lost.  The lady  was unable to give me the recipe again as she was seriously ill. Thank you

This was the surprise hit of my Christmas baking this past year. I halved the recipe and STILL had a lot of cookies. They freeze well, and are a nice addition to my cookie trays.

These nut rolls are very easy to make as far as making nut rolls are concerned.  The texture of the dough is perfect and they are delicious.  My family and friends all raved about them saying they were the best they had ever tasted.  We are a cookie family, so that is a pretty great review.  I used the recipe exactly as written except I rolled the prebaked cookie in granulated sugar because I read the other reviews which stated they were not sweet.  My mother and her Italian friends did this with their nut rolls.  I think this made them perfect.  it does make a lot, but they freeze very well and you always have something you can pull out of the freezer when you get unexpected company.

I've rated 5 stars because technically, I never had a single problem. The recipe is perfect as it stands, even when making a half recipe. They look very pretty and inviting, but the problem is it's a nut filling rolled in bread. The description and ingredients fool you into thinking this is some kind of pastry, but it has the exact texture and taste of bread. Dividing the dough (1/2 recipe) into 8 portions will make 128 rolls which overflows 2 aluminum pie plates. I baked on a baking stone so the bottoms don't get so browned. ** Edit** NO ONE like them. NO ONE! Maybe they can be fixed with a drizzle of caramel icing on top...because there's still a huge amount left in my freezer. The idea was good but I won't be making these again unless the carmel icing idea goes over. I might use the nut filling somewhere else. Sorry!

Delicious.  Makes a BUNCH.  My mother in law always made these for Christmas gifts - she always made mini's, though. Great with tea or coffee - not too sweet.

Not sweet enough. Tried dusting with powdered sugar. Didn't work. Then rolled in white sugar. Still not quite right. Added 1/4 of brown sugar, bingo! They are more like bread than I thought they would be.

This is exactly what I was looking for.  This is a traditional old fashioned nut roll. Not too sweet.....great with a cup of coffee.  Perfect!
