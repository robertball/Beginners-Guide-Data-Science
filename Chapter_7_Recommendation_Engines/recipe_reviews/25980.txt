This cake was the best "chocolate" cake I have ever eaten.  I did use whole wheat flour inside of white flour.  It did not seem to make any difference.  The cake was moist and remained that way until the last piece was eaten!  (Which didn't last long.)  The frosting was another story.  This was not as great as expected and fortunately for me I did not add it to the cake.  I think maybe it needed some heavy cream... Again I highly recommend this recipe for the cake part.

This is a delicious carob cake.  It is moist and has the perfect texture and sweetness.  I did substitute applesauce for the butter to keep it low-fat.  I also used my own version of carob frosting (carob powder, milk, and powdered sugar).  I also found that I had to cook it for 20 minutes longer than the recipe stated.  I grew up eating carob cake every year for my birthday, and this is one of the best ones I have tasted.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

Great cake! I've tried many times to make a cake with frosting using carob (my son is allergic to cocoa), but they usually never turned out. This is a definite keeper - the cake is moist without being half raw and the banana adds a nice flavour, and the icing is tasty too. Next time I'll only make half the icing though. I substituted 1/3 of the flour with whole wheat, and sprinkled shredded coconut over the icing.

Goodness and Angels, this is a wonderful recipe. We were out of bananas, so I subbed with 2TB ground flaxseed soaked in 6TB water, and was low on honey so used 1/2c honey and 2 packets of stevia. Also used whole wheat pastry flour, and no frosting. The 2 diabetics in the house were excited about having this for future b-day cakes. No wonder other members were so happy over this recipe! We are grateful to have this recipe now too!

I made this recipe for my daughter's birthday party because she is allergic to chocolate.  The kids enjoyed it as did the adults.  I liked the frosting, but found the cake part a little dry, but that could be b/c I used spelt flour instead of regular wheat (I'm wheat sensitive : P  )  But still on the whole, it was quite good and very full-flavored.

Next time I will try agave nectar intead of honey.  I think it will taste more like real chocolate.  I wish I could give 4.5 stars.

i can't consume caffeine but had a few bad experiences w/carob. until i tried this cake, that is! i substituted the water/nuts with 1/3C almond butter and 2/3C shredded coconut. that made a really lovely and moist cake with a delicious flavor. will try w/o the almond butter next time to lower fat. maybe raisins.

My two year old came up to me and asked for chocolate cake. I don't let him have chocolate so I decided to try this recipe instead. Simply awesome. I used less honey and substituted with whole grain spelt flour. I also used canola oil instead of butter since he is lactose intolerant. He loved his "chocolate cake".

WOW! This is an AmAzInG cake.  So moist and really chocolaty!  It is the best warm, but cool is great too. Thank you for your recipe!  I haven't been able to eat chocolate, because I can't take the caffein in chocolate, so this was heavenly to me.  I did not add any water in the icing and it turned out thicker like a regular frosting and added dry Hazelnut creamer with the dry milk to add flavor.  Though the Carob cake doesn't really need the sweet icing, it's great by itself!  Thank you again!

I made this for my daughter's first birthday since my kids don't get white sugar.  The cake was very good and very moist.  The frosting turned out runny so I ended up adding an 8oz container of cream cheese to tighten it up. It turned out very well but without the modification the frosting would have been a disaster.  The kids and the guests really liked the results and I'll be making this cake for future birthdays.

I actually submitted this recipe a few years ago. And I don't think I have made it in that long of a time! I am glad that you people that rated it liked it. The first time I tried it I had never tasted carob, I thought it was chocolate. Not what I was expecting! But it grew on me. The banana accents the taste.

It was surprisingly GOOD! I used 1/3 cup honey and 1/3 cup molasses because my honey has a strong taste. I also added 1/4 cup of strong tea instead of banana. However, the frosting was a bit sweet to my taste... and the cake tasted great even without the frosting. Definitely will make it again!

This is an aswesome recipe! My family and friends didn't know its not chocolate at all! The cake is moist and it tastes so good with the carob icing, honey gives it a special aroma and I'm a honey lover! Its easy to make and definitely a great treat! One thing to note is to serve is warmed, never cold as it'll dry up. Thanks for the great recipe!

Awesome!  Made this cake for my mother's 80 birthday.  Followed the recipe as directed (minus the walnuts) in a 10" round aluminum cake pan.  It was exceptionally moist with just the right amount of sweetness.  It really didn't need any frosting, so just did a light dusting of powder.  This recipe is a new favorite.

I love this cake (so do my kids)! We have to stay away from chocolate, so this moist cake is just what we need. I didn't make the frosting due to lactose issues, so I can't rate it.

This cake is delicious!  I made it for my 23 year old son's birthday and everyone loved it.
