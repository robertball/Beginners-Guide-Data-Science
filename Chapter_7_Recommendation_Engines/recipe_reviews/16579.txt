This recipe marks a great change of taste for stuffed celery.  I decorated some of these with pecans, some with green olives, and some with caviar.  One item of note:  I believe the recipe should call for one 4-ounce package of bleu cheese, instead of one 8-ounce package.  I made these with one 4-ounce package and it turned out great.

This was excellent.  Took recommendations from other reviews and used half the blue cheese and added cayenne pepper.  Made half a recipe and was no problem.  Will make again and it is already on the list for holiday parties.

This is really good!  Though i omitted the bleu cheese.  I'm not fond of blue cheese but is great with olives!  I modified the recipe a bit, by adding a bit of tabasco sauce and cayenne pepper and was perfect.  It's neither too hot or too mild, gave it a kick! Would definitely make again!

After reading the reviews I made a few changes.  I halved the blue cheese (to 4 oz) and I added some extra hot sauce and cayene pepper.  I also put the cheese mix back in the fridge for about 30 minutes so it wouldn't be so soft and runny when putting it on the celery.  These were pretty good and were a nice change to the normal appetizers I usually make.  The cream cheese kind of takes on a weird color, but if you can get past that, they are good.

I really loved this ~ it added a little something to your standard stuffed celery.  My guests, however, are not open to 'change.' They ate a little of it (after every single one asked why the cream cheese was brown), but it was not a big hit.

I love blue cheese and really wanted to love this.  I took the advice of other reviewers and halved the blue cheese to 4 oz.  Even with this change the flavors did not seem well balanced.  The flavor of Worchester was too strong for my liking.

I made this at Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. It's a great twist on the plain cream cheese version. Thanks!

I followed the recipe exactly and think that there is WAY too much Worscheshire.... very overpowering taste.   I may try to make this again without it, or use just a 1/4 tsp.

I make this for the holidays every year. I omit Blue cheese and add feta. I also add a clove of minced garlic and 1 can of chopped black olives. I serve it as a spread for veggies and crackers. My girls love it!!

A good recipe. I added too much Worcestershire so I tossed in some sharp shredded cheddar. For a little variety, I also added 6 oz crushed pineapple. Yum. Thanks, Helen!

Everyone said it was "good" but it didn't get eaten and I thought it was a lot of effort for just ok.

I made this the other day and my husband and I enjoyed them. We are doing low carb and this was a nice change from the standard cream cheese filled celery.

Average at best.  Added tons more hot sauce and some cayenne pepper to make it more interesting, but I still will not make this again.

I think this definitely calls for too much bleu cheese.  I will try again with about 1/4 of it.

I personally really liked these, but not many of them got eaten at my party. I don't know if it was because there was too much other food or just that not many people like Blue Cheese. Also, if I made them again I think I would only put in 1 tbsp. of Worcestershire so the stuffing is not such a weird brown color.
