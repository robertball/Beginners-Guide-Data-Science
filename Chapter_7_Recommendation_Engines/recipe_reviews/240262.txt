The thick dressing is delicious, but the kale is so prominent, I feel more dressing would be welcome.  Funny, I usually go very light on the dressing, but this unusual dressing seems a bit skimpy, and I would like more apple, too.  B.t.w., I  had to use my stick blender, because the quantity of dressing stayed below my blender blades and wouldn't puree.  Thanks for the idea, I would never have thought of this combination!

Had to use honey mustard when I discovered I had no dijon. I grow the flat leaf lacinato kale that's a little milder. The salad was so good. Interesting way to dress it. Definitely making again.

I substituted almonds for walnuts, apple cider vinegar for red wine, honey mustard for dijon, and added craisins to the raisins, (all just 'cause that's what I had on hand). Still turned out delicious! The emptiest I've ever seen a salad bowl at a dinner party.

Really easy to make in a NutriBullet; a little goes a long way with this dressing.  Based on the ingredients I'd say it's fat free. The apples and flavor cut the taste of the kale perfectly.  Everyone  at the table enjoyed it.
