just an fyi for anyone who is going to be making this. I am the submitter ,and  when I make it I do make it with penne pasta.something a little thicker than elbows.And that way it wont be as mushy.You also have to watch it according to how fast your crockpot cooks it.mine is done in 3 hours ,so 4 to 5 hours is a guide. And  if using 
elbows it will be done sooner.just wanted to share some tips :)

I have tried slow cooker mac and cheese only one other time in my life and it was horrible...this was the total opposite of that! The cooking times are off though...mine only took about 2-1/2hrs. to cook, so keep an eye on it and be sure to stir it every so often, as instructed. I halved the recipe, and used my 2qt. slow cooker, which was perfect. I used mostly Light Velveeta(R) w/ some shredded sharp cheddar added b/c I have bad luck w/ melting cheddar cheese, lol. This was perfectly thick and creamy. Oh, I don't know if this makes any difference, but I also used Barilla(R) Elbow Macaroni (the ones w/ the ridges), they worked out great in this! I can't wait to play around w/ the cheeses, spices and trying it w/o the broccoli too. Thanks for sharing this YUMMY, EASY recipe, Linda...it's a keeper! :)

No fuss, that's the way I like it. Really minimum prep work. Place ingredients in crock pot, check on occasionally and it will get ready for you. I used fresh broccoli microwaved al-dente. My crock pot runs hot so at 2 hr 30 min the pasta was done. Let run on warm another 15 minutes. It will be a regular potluck dish I bring to church. Everyone loves macaroni and cheese!

Ok...I was very skeptical because of reviews, but very curious at the same time...I've been looking for a slow cooker mac and cheese that uses uncooked noodles so I just had to try it...so glad I did....I did make this way lower fat by using a whole wheat medium shell pasta which held together fine, fat free evaporated milk, skim milk, and low fat cheddar. I also used fresh chopped broccoli that cooked perfectly and still stayed very green. I threw this together at 4 in the afternoon, and on HIGH this was done by 7. So for me it was 3 hours on HIGH with stirring every 1/2 hour...which I honestly didnt see a problem with...I was home...no big deal to stir every once in a while. This recipe I would not make on a work day...for this reason. My family and I very much enjoyed this! Next time I think that I will incorporate some velveeta cheese for that smoother meltier cheese, the cheddar melted fine but with a bit more of a grainy consistency...all in all a really good mac and cheese and you will be surprised that all liquids do eventually disappear. Thanks!

I halved the recipe and it filled my small slow cooker which only cooks on high.  After two hours of cooking and stirring, I noticed the whole grain penne that I used was getting done so I took the lid off and covered the top with more shredded cheese.  Thirty minutes later it was done and ready to eat.  I am happy with the end result and wanted to let people know that this does work.  Just for my own tastes, I added a couple dashes of Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce and about 1 T of dried minced onion.

The pasta was a little mushy and I used fresh broccoli, I should have cooked the broccoli a little first so it was still a bit crisp. It's better than a lot of the other recipes I have tried though!

Mush to say the least, The concept is good,but the paste turned into glue. I will say the taste is there, but don't walk away from it. for a slow cooker meal I'll never make it this way again. That said, I'll make it on the stovetop next time

I used a variety of pasta, as I was cleaning out my pantry.  It turned to mush in 3 hours on low, and did not look appetizing, although it was edible.  I've tried a couple different mac and cheese slow cooker recipes, and I've come to the conclusion that this type of food simply isn't meant for slow cookers.  From now on I'll be using stove top.

I have tried mac and cheese in the crock pot with disastrous results.  Very happy with this recipe.  Tweaked by leaving out broccoli, added dash of hot sauce and used 6 cups whole milk instead of milk/evaporated milk combo.  Oh, and used penne per someone else's recommendation.  Very happy!!

It's edible. After reading some of the other reviews I added more macaroni so it wouldn't be so mushy. And it only took me 2.5 hrs to cook on low.

The flavors in this mac & cheese were good.  Our problem is that we are not usually all that precise on the timing of things when they are in a crock pot, and sho' 'nuf, we overcooked our mac & cheese, and the pasta sorta disappeared into a cheesy mash.  Because the flavor was good, we actually downed most of this, but because we are not precise enough with crockpot timing...., this is *not* the right recipe for us.  Too bad.  it would be nice to have a 'fix-it-and-forget-it' mac & cheese, but well, we forgot it too long.........  *sigh*

Used Barilla elbows and no broccoli. I think I might use some velveeta with the chedder to make it smoother as the texture of the cheese was a little grainy but overall great easy recipe. Cooked it on low for 2 hours and then 1 hour on high. Made the pasta come out great.

I used 1/2 stick of melted butter to coat the macaroni, and a pint of half anf half.  Also added cubed cheddar cheese.  Cooked on HI for 2 1/2 hours.  The skeptical hubby was impressed!

I should have read the reviews before I made this.  Like many others said my noodles turned to mush after just 2 hours on low.  Slow cookers are not made for mac and cheese.

Maybe I'm not a big fan of stovetop macaroni and cheese in general, but I found this to be just okay. Nothing to write home about. Needs more seasoning than salt and pepper.

I thought this recipe was great (and super easy)! As suggested in the submitter's note, I used penne. I also used fresh broccoli, but other than that stuck to the exact recipe. It really does require occasional stirring, but that was no big deal. Thanks for sharing!

Holy smokes! I had my worries about making pasta in a slow cooker but daaaang this was good!

Made a couple changes, based on the other reviews:
1.Used whole wheat penne pasta instead of elbows.
2.Subbed a block of velveeta for 2 cups of grated cheese
3. added some parmesan on top. Just because.
I'll be making this again!

This is first time writing a review but I felt like I needed to because of the split opinions of this recipe....I thought it was good and telly easy to make. I know a few people tried different kinds of pastas because the elbow macaroni got mushy sometimes so I used pastas shells and it turned out fine. Because of the grainy taste other people experienced, I used a block of velveeta cheese with a cup of Monetary Jack cheese and followed the rest of the recipe as written. I also cooked on high for about 3 hours and stirring every 30mins but I would suggest really looking after it at about 2 1/2 hours. This is definitely something you can put together in a Sunday afternoon and it's super easy and makes a lot to last the week. I'm a college student so I don't have much time during the week to cook so this is beyond useful.

Great for softball nights.  Picky kids eat it. :)  I used gluten free pasta successfully.  Added a little milk because I cooked it a little too long.

This just didn't turn out for me.  The noodles were mushy and it was very runny.  I used penne.  I used skim milk so maybe that was part of the problem but it really wasn't worth the effort.  I wish it would have been though.

excellent and easy; I never buy evaporated milk so I substituted for regular milk.  It's good with other additions too, like cubes of ham.

Have made this numerous times and my family loves it.  I also add some Velveeta to make it creamier.  Use fat free milk and low fat evaporated.  Have made with and without the broccoli and have also added some cubed left over ham for a really hearty meal, served with a waldorf salad.  I have also had the problem with mushy pasta and will try cooking a shorter amount of time and also a different pasta than elbows.  Thanks for this keeper!!!

I made this with penne noodles instead of elbow noodles as recommended by a commenter to prevent the mush some people got and my crock pot took 2.5 hours on high to cook it. My daughter(2) ate a few of the noodles and then gave up, and my son(4) tried one noodle and felt the need to spit it out. I really loved it. If you like broccoli and cheese, you will love this recipe! I will definitely make this again sometime.

The taste was very bland however the real reason for only one star was that the macaroni was total mush. I followed the recipe exactly.

Loved this, but hubby thought it was a bit bland. I added about 1.5 tbs of seasoned salt and a sprinkling of garlic to jazz it up, which worked quite well. Not our very favorite, but easy and leftovers reheat well.

instead of 4 cups of shredded cheddar, used 1 large block Sharp & 1 large block mild cheddar.

The texture was a little grainy with the broccoli. I think next time Ill just omit the broccoli and see if its any better.

This recipe was very flavorful, but very mushy as well. If I make this again, I will use a different type of pasta and keep an eye on it.

I used ziti instead of elbows and did 2 cups American cheese and 2 cups cheddar for a smoother consistency, my family enjoyed it! Next time I will add cooked chicken for an easy chicken broccoli ziti.
