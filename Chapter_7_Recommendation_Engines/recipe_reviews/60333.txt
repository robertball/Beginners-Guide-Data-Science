I'm always on the lookout for good recipes using substitutes for ground beef and this one really was a winner. Came out nice and moist and my kids especially loved the soy sauce/brown sugar glaze. This one's a keeper... I'll definitely make it again.

I have a question about this recipe. What advantage is the tofu? You're using 2 lbs. of meat so why?

This was a good meatloaf. I did change a few things based on other suggestions. I added only one egg since I only used one pound of turkey, I did use the whole package of tofu, since others had said that it was too salty I cut down on the onion soup mix(1/2pkg) and soy sauce(1/8cup). I added about 1tsp of Emeril's Asian spice mix and that gave it a real nice kick. I will make this again. Thanks for the recipe

My tofu-hating husband requests this dish over and over.  It's so easy and I just freeze the fresh ingredients in premeasured portions, the let them defrost in the fridge right before making it.

I used 2 12 0z bags of the ground morning star soy portein product instead of turkey and it was wonderful! Texture was just like meat? thanks

This deserves 5 stars!  What a great way to use tofu in a meatloaf and it DOES blend incredibly well...you don't know it's partly meatless!  I also agree that the sauce makes it it...I think it's worth doubling or even tripling.  I didn't think the sauce was too salty...keep it as is.  However, due to the other reviews abou the onion soup mix being too salty (and also the fact that I didn't have any on-hand), here's what I mixed the meatloaf with and it turned out perfectly seasonsed:  1/2 panko crumbs, 2 TB's teriyaki sauce, 1 small chopped onion, 1/4 tsp black pepper, 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper, 1/8 tsp garlic salt, 1/4 tsp Spike gourmet seasoning (or something similar).  I followed the recipe with the same amount of eggs and I did add the green pepper, but I used more tofu (19 oz. instead of 14 oz.) and used only 1 lb. of ground turkey.  Delish!  Will definitely make again!

Really yummy, although pretty salty.  I used only 1 pound of turkey, and twice the tofu, and it was great.  Next time I will try it with only tofu, no meat, and maybe a combination of spices rather than the super salty onion soup mix.

This was very good and very moist.  I had a few changes: used 1.25 lbs of ground turkey, one egg and no bell peppers (didn't have any on hand).  The sauce really makes it.  My husband said it was just OK, until I told him to spoon some of the leftover sauce onto the meatloaf: then he really liked it (although he knew there was tofu in it so he was a little turned off but still enjoyed it). My 4 yr old liked it as well.  A great way to get some soy into our diets!

A couple reviewers thought this was bland so I used the spicy tofu rather than the plain and it was good. Next time I would use the lo-sodium soy sauce. Very good - I'd make again and tweak it a little for personal taste.

I followed the recipe as instructed but doubled the sauce as others' recommended.  My husband found the smell of the meatloaf offensive but said it tasted okay.  I found the smell strong and the taste was okay.  My son refused to try it because of the strong smell (Lipton's Onion Soup and soy combination, I think).  The smell is very strong and the leftovers tainted food/water in the refrigerator.  I am not inclined to make this again given our unfortunate response to a healthy alternative meal.

So delicious!  The sauce really is key as all others have said (even though I used coarse dijon b/c I didn't have yellow)...Doesn't matter what protein you bake.  I used ground bison and seasoned it without adding the onion soup mix.  Also used panko flakes and forgot to mash the small cubes of leftover tofu, but no matter, it still came out looking good and yummy! For half the # of servings, it took about 45 minutes.

I didn't want to pollute this kindly vegetarian concoction with turkey so I added Morningstar crumbles. This worked very well, husband dug it and so did I. Doubled up the sauce which added plenty of good tasting lube.

I was starving and didn't want to wait for it to cook in the oven.  I sauteed up some onion and the tofu in a pan, then added the rest of the ingredients.  It didn't 'look' the greatest but it sure was tasty and quick!  Great high protein dinner with little fat and carbs.

This was surprisingly good! I had a package of ground turkey & a package of lite tofu & nothing in mind to make for dinner.  The recipe is also very forgiving -- add what you like, subtract what you don't.  We don't like onions or green peppers, so I used poultry seasoning, garlic and mushrooms. I just added the seasoned bread crumbs until it all stuck together nicely.  Great recipe, thank you!

Instead of dry onion soup mix, I used 2 teaspoons of chicken boullion, 4 teaspoons of dried minced onions, and a little white pepper.  

I also only used a 1.25lb package of ground turkey, one egg, and I doubled the glaze.  I mixed half of that glaze in with the meatloaf, and used the other half as directed.  There was a lot of glaze liquid in the pan with the meatloaf, so we served each slice with a drizzle of sauce on top.  It was a little on the salty side, but it had good flavor. 

I baked it in a 9" glass pie pan for about an hour.  

I served this with whipped cauliflower.  

It was a flavorful and healthier take on meatloaf and mashed potatoes, with a twist!  We enjoyed it.  My fiance ate almost half of it already!

I really liked this recipe.  I took the suggestions from others by using 1/2 of the soy sauce.  I used pork instead of turkey and it turned out really juicy.  I didn't use the green peppers, but I minced some onions and mixed it in.  I think next time I will add water chestnuts diced, to add a nice crunch to it.  It was very tasty.  Will definitely make this again!

Totally delicious. I used 1 lb turkey, 1 lb ground beef, and one package of tofu because that's what I had. Could not even taste the tofu. I think you could get away with 1/2 meat and 1/2 tofu and it would still be great. I made a little extra sauce which was perfect - like a recipe and a half.

Oh Wow, really good! I made this almost exactly to the recipe, except that I only used 1 pound of turkey and a 16oz block of firm tofu. Texture reminded me a little of a meaty quiche. Flavor is awesome. I didn't use the whole package of onion soup mix because I had read other reviews about salt. Was not too salty, just right. Still fit nicely in a 9" square pan, but I would say it definitely served less than 12 (keeping in mind I used less meat). Seems like it would work well with variations, too, so I'm excited to try it with different veggies and sauces.

We loved this recipe! I'm not a big fan of meatloaf, but the hubby is so I'm always on the lookout for something a little different. This totally hit the spot. I took others suggestions and only used one egg and only 1.25 lb of ground turkey. As others have said, the sauce is really what makes it and I doubled it. Served it over brown rice and we were really impressed with the flavor! Picky hubby (who actually knew about the tofu!) and 2 yr old ate it up. This is a winner and I'm about to make a freezer meal out of it for later :)

I just took this wonderful recipe out of the oven.  Absolutely great.  I didn't have bell pepper so I added green onions, cilantro and 1/2 of a jalapeno, turned out just fine.  It will be a regular at my house.

Like others, I made this with 1/2 pkg. of onion soup mix, low sodium Soya sauce, and Dijon mustard for an added kick.  Delicious.    Now I'm thinking next time switch the Asian flavours for Italian or Indian Curry....ahh the choices.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I'm always interested in getting more good stuff in my diet and this fills the bill.

made this recipe for a daycare- 80 kids and 20 adults and  it came out very well.  Looks a little funny but taste is good.  will make it again.  Just let the glaze reduce to about 1/4 of the liquids and you will have a nice candied glaze to apply on top.

My girlfriend and I love this recipe.  I only use 1.25 lbs of turkey and only use the green peppers if I have them on hand.  For me the sauce is the key ingredient, so I make double!

Wow, this is so good!  It's moist, flavorful, low fat and even better than a ground beef meatloaf.  Since I am diabetic I used 2 Tbls. of brown sugar Splenda instead of the 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  I also used oatmeal instead of the bread crumbs.  I'd give this a 10 if I could.

I accidentally mixed all the ingredients together and it was super yum!  Even our kids enjoyed it.  They didn't even notice they were eating Tofu.  It makes great salad toppers and sandwiches for the day after.

LOVE this recipe!  I halved it (except for the sauce), left out the mustard and used mushrooms instead of green pepper.  It came out great the first time, everyone loved it, and I'm cooking it again as we speak!  I like the mix of the turkey and tofu, though the tofu doesn't really have its own flavor.  Yum!!

My husband and I loved this recipe! It's healthy and tastes great.  I do like the sauce that is drizzled on top so I usually double the sauce.

I thought this was great. The tofu made the meatloaf moist and was a nice, interesting touch. My own personal revision was instead of green peppar I used carrots and people loved it. They thought the crunch from the carrot was tasty.

Maybe you have to already by a fan of tofu -- but this was NOT tasty.  It was weird.  Maybe I did something wrong?  I used only 1 lb turkey, as another reviewer said that was fine, but the tofu was still too apparent and seemed more like undercooked bits of scrambled egg than anything appetizing.  So far, in the lifetime tofu and I are not friends.

Niether my husband or I were big fans of this recipe.   The meatloaf was bland.  The sauce was good, but the two just didn't taste right together.

I really love how this recipe came out.  I leave out the mustard (personal taste) and usually never have peppers on hand so I leave them out as well.  Give it a try; I was someone that never would have thought to use tofu for anything edible before I tried this recipe, and since it's so mashed up, I barely even notice it.  I substitute ground bison for the turkey and the results are a really meaty tasting, really healthy alternative to my mom's recipe--that tastes just as good.

I used half the meat and used pork instead of turkey. I liked it, but my husband didn't (he hates tofu with a passion).

Wasn't sure what to expect before making this, but it turned out great! Followed the recipe for the most part but did make some changes. I only used 1 lb of ground turkey but still used the entire package of tofu. Instead of dried bread crumbs, I used 2 slices of wheat bread that I tore apart in to small pieces. I also used low-sodium soy sauce.  Wasn't too salty at all even after using a whole packet of onion soup mix! The only thing I would change next time is to cook the green pepper beforehand so the pieces are not so crunchy. Thanks for sharing!
