Delicious! Cheap and easy, and everyone will be amused with your resourcefulness! Feel free to add any spice you desire to the flour and salt/pepper mixture. I add cinnamon and sweet basil in place of salt and pepper and serve with hot fudge syrup or syrup of choice!!

My grandma made Fried Dandelions when I was young and they were always so delicious. Thanks for this recipe! Just like grandmas!

I have made these for a few years now, I found a similar recipe (I use oil, though, not butter) and tried it with my small kids as something fun to do. We went out for a nice walk in a nearby field and picked dandelions, then came home and fried them up. I wasn't expecting for them to taste DELICIOUS and for my three and two year old to beg me to make them again and again!! I always describe them as tasting like fried green beans, without the juiciness of fried green beans. These are just crunchy little bites of heaven. To this day the minute dandelions appear in the spring, my kids ask me to make them. I love the tip for soaking them in salt water to get rid of any bugs! Next time I will definitely do that.

This is outstandingly tasty and easy. One small point of confusion though in the ingredients list it says to use "unopened" dandelions which is not correct. You should use fully opened ones and the larger ones are better in my opinion. Also the next time I make it I might try to think of a dipping sauce to add more flavor. But it was great as it was. They are also best served immediately. I also used way less flour than the recipe said.

Good recipe ! never had tried anything from the yard before, was pleasantly surprised, I will say that I prob. had more than 80 heads and made half the breading mixture and it was more than enough.   Be careful  to shake off extra flour before frying it burned the butter to quickly, after cleaning the fry pan out I did a half butter half oil and it burned less but also had less buttery good flavor.

Really good!  Next time I make this, I'll only use half as much flour/salt/pepper, however.

I was skeptical but i made them tonight. Omg. So good. The kids went crazy for them.  I made a couple changes, used fully opened flowers and salt free seasoning, then fried them in olive oil because I didn't have any butter, turned out great. Definitely a keeper.

This is pretty good.  I also battered the opened yellow flowers this way, and the tiny, unopened buds found at the middle of the plant.

So good. My 2 year old and husband couldn't stop eating them. Seasoned using Tony Chachere's and sumac. Served with a Chipotle mayo.
