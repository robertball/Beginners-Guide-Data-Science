My first ever cake in a microwave recipe, 
And I made two batches in 10 minutes coz it finished soo quickly! 
The first time I followed the recipe exactly as above but didn't add the egg, because I didn't want to waste an egg, if the recipe didn't turn out right it would have ended up in the bin. 

The second time I also omitted the coconut and the almonds, I also put a little less cocoa powder and I think this second time round tastes waaay better! 
So no, don't add the egg, you don't need it. 
So try it out as a lazy dessert and enjoy! Because all my family members loved it!!

I just made this. It was my first "microwave" cake recipe. It turned out really well. I didn't have coconut so I omitted that altogether. I used the rest of the recipe as is. I topped mine with vanilla frozen yogurt instead of icecream.

I found that it needed a bit more sweetness in the cake itself but instead of adding sugar I'll be adding adding more chocolate chips and a maybe a tad bit less flour next time. Remember to mix the batter right before it goes in or the chocolate chips settle. Letting it cool is very important as it helps the heat distribute and finish up that cooking.

Tips:

Since you are making one at a time let it cool all the way and taste it. I added a bit of sugar to the batter before putting in my second one. You can adjust as you go based on your taste.

Cup shape MATTERS. Using a wide cup will lead to too much exposed surface area and a crusty overcooked surface. Use something that is more cylindrical. Also some cups change width a lot from base to top. They don't allow for even cooking. 

Finally remember: it may not look as good as Chef John's but it'll still taste awesome.

Let's hope Chef John comes out with a Brownie recipe too!

I'll give it this, it was a pretty good mug cake for the most part. The choc chips are totally unnecessary and made one of the cakes an oozy, nasty, undercooked, mess. I can totally live without this one.

This is the first time ever I have reviewed a recipe but this one is worthy of it! I am pregnant was craving a piece of chocolate cake without waiting 45 min for it. I don't know how all the ingredients come together so well in just 45 seconds but the taste and texture is so much like a "real" cake its mind boggling! A must try!

I applaud you, Chef John, for giving us a recipe for something homemade, chocolate, using ingredients we keep around the house, and finished in less than 10 minutes.  Maybe I shouldn't applaud you--I can tell you this will be made many times, and my waistline may protest, but with the ease and convenience of this cake, who cares?  Yum.

I was craving something sweet but didn't want to make something time-consuming.  This was simple to make and took 5 minutes (did it on a commercial break).  I followed the directions except I used white chocolate chips instead of the semisweet minis and walnuts instead of almonds b/c that's all I had.  I really wish I had the minis, because the large choco chips sunk right to the bottom and stuck to the mug!  This cake is chocolatey without being too sweet or rich and the milk added a nice creamy taste.  However, next time, I will use 2 or 2.5 T of milk, because I had just a bit too much liquid.  The cake formed, but there was a little "chocolate milk" liquid around it.  (Microwaved mine for just over a minute because I just used one larger mug rather than a few smaller ones.)  I'll probably make this again as it's a great cake to randomly make for 1-2 people.

This is my first recipe rating...and just had to say YUM! It appeared to have a lot of ingredients, but some are just add-ins. My seven year old daughter and I made this for a quick dessert, 
and will now be adding it to our family recipe book! I added walnuts, white chocolate and coconut...easy and fast! Thanks for sharing and posting the video as well.

I used half & half instead of milk (didn't want to open a new jug just for 1/4 cup!) and added a bit of espresso powder and just a big more vanilla and omitted the almonds. Espresso powder really intensifies the chocolate flavor! The texture was amazingly good and wasn't at all dry. They definitely are not pretty, but after the first bite, does it really matter? LOL We drizzled ours with just a touch of half & half instead of the cocoa/powdered sugar and ice cream. Really good when you just need a chocolate fix!

Loved this! Made it with my five year old as a quick fix when she requested chocolate cake. It was easy enough for her to make herself! I also subbed the milk with coffee mate 'Abuelita chocolate' creamer which gave this a great Mexican chocolate taste. My only issue was that it took longer than 45 seconds to cook, more like 1 min & 15s...although that may have been my error since I eyeballed my proportions and also used baking choc. In bar form. The baking choc turned out to be a happy accident though, because the extra choc sank to the bottom making it's own ganache. My daughter was thrilled!

OMG!  This is pure heaven! This sure beats any type of microwave cake make with box ingredients. I followed the recipe exactly. Nice and moist....melted chips in the bottom very very decadent. And I always make my own ice cream so I even added that on top....wow!  Only trouble is...I need to probably do "double time" on the treadmill. Do yourself a favor and try this. Thanks Chef John!

I've made this several times now and it's really an amazing mug cake. Some changes I made are I use 3 tbls coconut oil in place of the 2 tbls butter and 1 tbls veg oil. I also like to use about half light brown sugar and half white sugar to make 1/4 cup. I divide into two mugs and microwave it for about 1 min 45 sec. Add-ins are endless: chopped nuts, berries, chocolate chips, m&ms or other candies, a dollop of Nutella or peanut butter in the center.. Yum!

I've made this about 10 times in various versions and I have yet to find a reason to complain! I've made it with water instead of milk, and without the egg, almonds, or coconut and it becomes an awesome brownie (also only takes about 1 1/2 mins in the micro when you leave out the egg). I've made it with the egg and it becomes a good thick cake (think pound cake). I've made it with mini chips and milk chocolate chips, both awesome. I've made it in 5 different shaped tupperware containers (I don't have any coffee mugs at the moment) and found it takes longer to cook in a shallow rectangle than it does in a smaller round. It gets VERY HOT, so you definitely want to give it 5-10 mins to cool (I throw it in the fridge because I'm impatient). It's very rich, so it is possible to cut back the cocoa powder by 1/2 tbsp or so to make it a bit less rich. And my new favorite topping for this cakey awesomeness is to mix 1 tbsp powdered sugar with a tiny bit of water (about 1/4 tsp) to make a glaze to drizzle over it when it cools. DIVINE!

Great Quick Recipe! Came out tasting like actual chocolate cake.

Since I was really lazy (I happen to be a potato mood atm HAHAAH), I simply went with the basic stuff needed to make the cake (Flour,BP, Sugar, Salt, Oil, Milk, Egg, Choco Powder). Mixed it all in and pop it in the microwave for at least a total of 2 mins., I was suppose to half it to 2 servings but my cup was a size of a soup cup, so its pretty wide and big. With my lazy instincts, I poured it all in anyway and it left about 1/4ish the cup open, so im well assured it'll be fine.

 A sudden spur of imagination, I flipped the cup on a plate, lastly dusted it with PS. And i now have a fancy looking cake to eat while in my special corner!

Sadly, I wasnt able to take a photo bcs I couldnt wait any longer.

With all respect to the owner of the recipe for sharing such wonderful recipe :3

I made this with the Amazon 'wickedly prime' brand cocoa truffle spread instead of nutella and it literally melts in your mouth! I only used it because it was cheaper than nutella, but wow was i pleasantly surprised! I have made it twice (once without the egg, because I hurriedly forgot it and another time with coffee instead of milk) and both times it was good. I found it cooks better divided into two mugs than using one large mug. If you divide it into two mugs, cook each separately and only for 60 seconds, otherwise it will burn. For reference, I have a 1,000 watt microwave. The cake is very rich, sweet and chocolatey. Once I take it out of the microwave, I pour a little bit of cold milk over it (ice cream is good too, but it's already so sweet) to cool it off quickly and keep it from becoming crumbly.

AMAZING!!!!!! I'd made another chocolate mug cake on AR that was far inferior to this one!!!!!!! This mug cake was fluffy!!! Sweet, melted chocolate chips throughout! Warm....decadent....With vanilla ice cream, caramel sauce drizzle, whipped cream and a candle I would have this for every birthday!!!! This beats chain $8.00 end of meal desserts by a loooong shot!!! My daughter doesnt even EAT chocolate-let alone chocolate cake...that is until tonight!!! A+ recipe!!!!

I made this lower-carb by replacing sugar with Splenda, and skipping the chocolate chips.  I topped with whipped cream.  Definitely satisfied my craving for a warm chocolate treat.

Made lots of changes but recipe was great to start from.  I used 3/4 c of xylitol instead of 1/2 c of sugar.  I used coconut flour instead of regular flour and used coconut butter in place of butter and 2T of coconut oil.  Up the milk to 5T of coconut milk to allow for the coconut flour which needs more liquid. I added the reg. chocolate chips and unsweetened coconut.   Microwaved for 1.5 minutes on high (1100 power microwave)  Now I have a healthier version of this mug cake.  I have to do gluten free/dairy milk free so this is perfect.  Thanks for the recipe.

This chocolate mug cake is AMAZING! I follow the recipe exactly except I don't add nuts (just a matter of personal preference) and it always turns out perfect. Eat it warm topped with vanilla ice cream for a "brownies a la mode" experience. You can easily make this recipe gluten-free by using GF all-purpose flour, which can be found in most grocery stores. The gluten-free all-purpose flour I always use is Betty Crocker gluten-free all-purpose rice flour blend. Enjoy! :)

This is a great recipe! While it is quite tedious measuring out all of the numerous ingredients, it is SO worth it in the end. The end result is an extremely rich molten chocolate that is fabulous.

Seriously cake in 45 seconds!!! Moist, good, chocolate cake in minutes! This was my first attempt at a mug cake and I'm impressed. I'm pregnant and was looking for something sweet without spending an hour in the kitchen.  My 4 year old helped make this cake and within minutes we had dessert prepped for us for an after dinner treat. We made the cake exactly as written minus the nuts because I did not have any on hand. Exactly what we were looking for! Definitely will make this again!! Thank you again Chef John:))

We made this with some friends and it was amazing!! We even made it gluten free like half the people were allergic to wheat and it was soooo good! The last thing anyone would expect was to make cake in a microwave.

This is perfect if there is too much to do to fuss and wait, but you're craving chocolate or don't want to run the oven on a hot summer day! I used almond milk instead of regular and just a small swig over the amount of vegetable oil, regular chocolate chips instead of mini (all I had but worked out fine) and added a few edible pearl cake decoration candies instead of almonds because I didn't have any of them either (I didn't add many though), and I added a little coffee extract to the chocolate batter. It took a little under a minute and a half in my microwave. It was so moist and it rose real well and didn't collapse after taking it out at all. So good topped with Friendly's  butter crunch ice-cream!! Thanks Chef John, and you were right in the video...no hockey puck here!!

I tried something like this before and it turned out horribly, so I was reluctant to try. But I'm glad I did! I didn't add the coconut or nuts and I accidentally put the baking powder in the chocolate mixture instead of the flour and it turned out just fine (score! 2 less dishes to wash). I had to bake mine for a minute because 45 seconds "seemed" like it wasn't cooked enough. It was a little dry, so perhaps I overcooked it a bit. I would definitely make this again and with some vanilla ice cream. Thanks for sharing!!

It had wonderful ingredients, but was w....a....y   too sweet for our family.  Also it didn't firm up, as 'cake' in the 45 sec.  Neat idea tho.

Not bad... still not as good as a regular cake. The texture is impossible to get right in the microwave. If you don't want to add the chocolate chips, you might need a little bit more sugar.

I've never made mug cake before so I have nothing to compare it to, but this turned out pretty yummy and it definitely satisfied the cake craving. I didn't have coconut so I left that and the almonds out, and had to cook it longer in my microwave, but I'll definitely make this one again.

Really good when you need to satisfy that sweet craving without having a lot of cake laying around the house. 
Plus the cook's video had great humor to it. He's great

I have made this over and over again and my family loves it! It is a dessert in a jiffy. These are the ingredients that one always have at home so it is a perfect cup of happiness.

It feels warm and fuzzy when you st with your own cup of cake. I used coconut sugar instead of white sugar for baking and it tastes just the same :)

The almonds and coconut add some very nice texture, served this with some ice cream and it was delicious.  It doesn't make a lot of batter so I would suggest medium size mugs

I made this and it was terrific!!! Soooo easy to make and hits that chocolate crave right on the spot! The best part about this recipe though is that you can really do whatever you want, there’s no rules so it doesn’t even have to be chocolate.

This was really yummy I substituted sprinkles for the topping and skipped the almonds and coconut. I substituted gluten free flour. It didn’t rise as well as it might have because of that, but it had a great consistency.

I've tried mug cakes in the past, but this one was really super good!  I didn't have any chocolate chips or any almonds, but I did have some coconut. it was delicious. I sprinkled powdered sugar and cocoa powder on top and also topped with a small spoon of vanilla ice cream it was very very satisfying.  This one's going in the book.

The only things that I changed were these:no cocoa powder dusting on top(I did do the confectioners sugar, though), no almonds or coconut flakes(however, I did do the chocolate chips), and I added some caramel to the ice cream.

This was absolutely delicious & completely satisfying. Perfect amount for that chocolate craving, so no excuse for me to make a whole cake. lol The only thing I did differently is use dark chocolate since I'm partial to it. 100% sinful :)

For a mug cake it's really good, one would normally expect the final product to taste and look like some dry mud in a cup but it was surprisingly fluffy and tasty!

Made this cake with my Junior Girl Scout troop last night, and it was a big hit!  The girls (5th and 6th graders) easily followed the recipe and loved the cakes they made!  The cakes that included extras (like chocolate or peanut butter chips, toffee chips, etc.) did take a little longer (maybe 20 - 30 seconds) to bake, as did the ones the girls made in taller mugs.  A great starter recipe for beginning bakers!  And a great Valentine's Day treat!!

This was exceptional. My mistake is that I thought my 16 ounce mug was big enough to hold the cake in as it rose. It was not. I will use two mugs, as instructed, next time. 
My only change is that I included a sprinkling of cinnamon before the last stir.

My husband wanted something sweet to have with a glass of milk, and this recipe fit the bill perfectly. He was shocked at how quickly it was ready, and I was happy to be able to make a good dessert for just the two of us without using the oven or having anything leftover. Just perfect!

This is so much better then any other mug cake I have tried. Usually it is very bland and kinda gross.  I didnt have any baking cocoa so I used dark hot chocolate mix. I added less sugar since there is sugar in the hot chocolate mix.  Everything else I didnt change. I will make this again.

My first microwave chocolate mug cake..YUMMY I was making it for my son who of course didn't want coconut nor almonds... I also didn't have mini chocolate chips ??  So to somehow compensate for my lack of ingredient to add texture I  added a crust of Keebler chocolate sandwich cookie at the bottom ... According husband hat was the gourmet touch! I served it whipped cream.

This is so simple and delicious! I didn't add the coconut or nuts because I didn't have any, and added extra chocolate chips to the top before putting in the microwave and it made a creamy chocolate cover, delicious.

Delicious! Made recipe mostly as is except I substituted coconut and almonds with peanuts because I didn't have them on hand and this recipe turned out great. Very moist and chocochips added the right amount of sweetness. My microwave is old so had to nuke for 2.5 minutes.  A perfect chocolate fix. Hubby loved it.

This is a perfect recipe for two little cakes. The only change I made was to sub in coconut oil for the butter and oil, since that's what I had on hand, and threw in walnuts instead of almonds because I love the chocolate and walnut combo. Terrific recipe, I ate one cake and am trying to save the other one for my husband. He'd better get home soon!

I didn't have any coco powder, so I just used an equal amount of flour. I also just left out the coconut, chips, and any almonds.  It was an alright cake, a little 'wet' along the sides, but good.

It tuurned out great!!! I did not have almonds or chocolate chips so I added two tablespoons of coconut. I also used self rising flour so I excluded the baking powder. It still was great. This is the third time I am making this and I'll continue making it.

OMG this cake was amazing. I did as one user suggested and omitted the egg. I also left out the coconut and the almonds. I didn't have unsweetened cocoa powder, so I used instant Ovaltine instead, and changed the white sugar to light brown sugar. In place of mini semisweet chocolate chips, I used Andes mints baking chips. 

I didn't use a thick mug, but rather two Corelle tea cups, which are quite thin compared to your regular coffee mugs. 

After 45 seconds in the microwave, I popped them out, sprinkled on some powdered sugar, and topped them off with a halved strawberry. 

Great texture, moist and perfect for a lat-night snack!

I made this with peanut butter instead of Nutella since that's what I had on hand. Cake was super dry and crumbly. Don't know if it was the peanut butter or the recipe. I don't recommend peanut butter for anyone wondering!

I made this easy mug cake without the coconut and almond and came out really good, easy to follow and great flavor.  This is perfect for kids to make.

I used coconut flour, almond milk, & coconut oil.  I also mixed in walnuts & chocolate chips (left out coconut flakes, & almonds).  It's one of my favorites so far!  Although my cooking time was 2 minutes... (This could be because of the mug I used & the different ingredients).  Oh, & I topped it with a little Nutella ??

I have now made this two times. Followed the recipe exactly the first time but divided the cups three ways. Served with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. Yum. Even my son who isn't a fan of chocolate cake like this.  The second time,  I added 1 TBS more of chocolate chips, left out the nuts and coconut and divided into three mugs and set timer for 40 seconds. Still Yum:) Just make sure NOT to over-bake. FYI…for those counting, if you divide this recipe just two ways, it is over 400 cal per serving:|  Thanks

I've tried many a mug cake, and this one is the best. Great basic recipe and can easily be customized!

I made this as my first mug cake attempt ever last night because all the kids were gone, and a big cake for two people seemed like overkill. Just added coconut extract in place of vanilla and omitted the almonds, this was SO good! Didn't dust the top, and it didn't need it, so now I have a simple thing to fix tonight with my six year old that she can really do mostly on her own!

Moist, rich, delicious! In just a couple of minutes, too! I skipped the coconut and almonds because I didn't have any on hand, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

FANTASTIC recipe!!! However I did make a couple of small changes that, in the end, made the whole process easier. I cut out the almonds and coconut as I'm not a fan of either, and I also didn't add an egg due to other reviewers saying it wasn't necessary and it really isn't. However, making this directly by the recipe caused a few more dirty dishes than I wanted. I directly threw everything into a round tall mug and it came out perfect.

I was craving something chocolate and I didn"t want to run to the store, nor spend a lot of time making a cake. This recipe definitely fit the bill! I didn"t have almonds, but used walnuts  instead. Turned out great!

This was good, but not perfect (try Easy Microwave Chocolate Cake on this site for that). Like others, I doubled the recipe, but used only one egg. We don't like add-ins to our chocolate cake, so I skipped the coconut and toasted almonds, but used more chocolate chips. It took a little more than a minute too cook.

I had tried tons of mug cakes before this one and they all were like a "hokey puck". If you want an amazing dessert try this one. Although, they dry out fairly quickly. All I did was after it was cooked, I added a table spoon of milk to the top.

Love it.  I end up making it without the egg, just because I'm that lazy sometimes.  I also throw in chopped nuts on occasion.  I replace the oil with unsweetened applesauce.

I just blew my husband's mind.  Thank you Chef John!  I used 2 tablespoons of regular size semi sweet chips and cooked for 40 seconds in my microwave as it cooks hot.  I didn't have ice cream, but I had one weight watchers variety of snickers ice cream bar so I cut it in half and threw that on top.  I wouldn't like it without the ice cream, it needs that melty ice cream goodness.  Just perfect for that sweet tooth craving.

I made this gluten free and it was to die for! I used wholesome chow  gluten free, high protein pancake mix for the flour and used coconut sugar instead of granulated sugar. I cooked 45 seconds like the recipe says. It may look undercooked but after letting it rest it was perfect. Moist, chocolatey and addictive! I will use more chocolate chips next time. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Unfortunately this didn't rise in the mug whatsoever-which is a shame because the actual mixture doesn't taste so bad.

By fat the BEST cake in a mug recipe I have found! I used splenda sugar mix (2 tablespoons), rather than pure sugar, to cut down on some of the calories. I also didn't have the nuts or coconut or enough chocolate chips, so I just used what I had on hand. DELICIOUS!!! My husband even loved it. He said this would be perfect with a scoop of ice cream on top- which we didn't have any of either. All in all excellent! Defiantly a keeper. Thanks chef!

Perfect for one of those killer cravings or for a quickie dessert, but be very careful as to measure everything right or it will come out oddly, also be very precise when dividing the batter into the 2 cups. ENJOY!!!

This is a very nice mug cake recipe. I did not expect much from a microwave cake recipe. this one has to be one of the top rated in my book. Omitting the chocolate chips would be a bad idea they provide an additional lair flavor. I made this recipe in 4 inch ceramic tumblers, it worked very well for 47 seconds for the cook time. I serve them within 2 minutes of baking they were still doing and tasted really good with ice cream.

Really yummy! I tried other mug cakes and they weren't very good. I don't like shredded coconut, and I didn't have chocolate chips so I omitted those. I instead put in walnut chunks and the almonds. I also used a much bigger mug and it took about 75 seconds, but every microwave is different. Delicious!
