I have made this a few times and it is a big hit.  I use all chicken broth, lots crushed fresh garlic, and no salt.  I also cook it for 1 hour and 30 minutes.  I am horrible at cooking any rice.  I really wanted to find a way to switch to much healthier brown rice.  This has completely replaced instant and white rice for us and is so easy to make.  I love that I just put it in the oven and even I can not screw it up.

Great recipe! I read over all the other reviews and came up with the perfect combo: Use Low Sodium broths, this will eliminate the saltiness; Use garlic powder not garlic salt; Add 2 cut up green onions, 1 can of sliced mushrooms and 1 can of drained and rinsed chickpeas. I hope these suggestions make this even better for you.

I always use brown rice, it is just so much better for you.  And I always cook it in the oven, that way it comes out just right.  I had been making my rice with slightly less liquid (about 1&3/4 cups)and I use water.  Now that I've found this recipe I have adjusted my own recipe to include the stock.  The one thing that I won't change about my recipe is to COOK IT COVERED.  If you cook your rice COVERED it WILL be done in about one hour.  And it WILL BE creamy and perfect like it is supposed to be.

This a easy way to cook rice. I used 1 cup each of chicken and beef broth also an extra cup of water. (I used brown basmati rice and ratios were 1cup rice to 3 cups liquid) I used garlic powder and omited the seasoned salt. I omited the butter. In 2 tablespoons of olive oil I sauted chopped onions, sliced mushrooms and added this along with dried parlsey to rice. I baked rice covered and it turned out perfect.

I broke my own cardinal rule with this recipe - I was in such a hurry while making it, I didn't read the reviews beforehand.  Thankfully, I did read them while it was cooking - hence the high rating.  I did give it 5 stars because it was rather tasty, although, after the recommended cooking time, my chicken was ready, my rice was still super watery.  I popped it in the microwave for 8 minutes and that seemed to complete the cooking process.  I was a bit salty (as others had mentioned) but not horribly so (the only change that I made was that I used Low Sodium Chicken Broth because it was the only thing in the house).  In the future, I will allow the extra cooking time and I think that I will reduce the sodium by diluting the broth with water.  Was interesting cooking rice in the oven - prior to this, I had only done it stovetop.

This rice is very good.  Instead of butter I followed others advice and substitute olive oil.  Also use garlic powder instead of salt and reduce the season salt to 1/8 tsp.  I also saute mushrooms and chopped onion and add to the rice mixture, then bake.  Turns out fantastic although mine does take 1 hour and 10 minutes, but that may be my oven!

I subbed garlic powder for garlic salt and minced onion instead of seasoning salt, also used reduced sodium broths so this was not too salty for us.  I also added some shredded carrot, I'm sure diced celery and bell peppers would be great but didn't have 'em on hand.  Covered the pan with foil and it was done in an hour.  Made this with Teriyaki Chicken from this site as they both had the same cooking time and temp.  Great easy way to make flavorful brown rice - since I didn't have to prepare on the stove top, it gave me time to get on the treadmill while dinner cooked.  Gotta love that!

Great rice side dish. I added some chopped carrots and used olive oil instead of the butter. Did not have chicken stock so I used beef base. Placed a lid on my 2 qt. casserole dish.
The rice was cooked perfectly. 
This is a much better way to cook rice instead of on the stove top.

Very easy to make!  I used basmati rice but, I wouldn't call this a family favorite, needed some more kick to it.

This recipe is really great!  I generally only cook for myself, so am always looking for recipes that freeze well in individual portions... this is definitely one of them!! (I use Ziploc bags.) I switched the amounts of the beef and chicken broths around (1 can beef broth, 1 cup chicken broth) because it was what I had on hand, and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  This made my house smell AMAZING while it was cooking - I couldn't hardly wait to try it!!  It was worth the wait - very flavorful!  I'm glad I followed the suggestion of covering with foil - I'm not sure if it would have come out quite as well if I cooked uncovered.  This came out perfectly and it was SO easy!!  :)  (P.S.  I've now made this several times and have even passed the recipe on...it's that good!)

I'm the notorious kitchen-queen of ruining brown rice; typically, by having the rest of dinner ready, and the rice is still soupy or crunchy. This recipe saved my ability to now have brown rice on the table (and tasty!) at the same time as the rest of the meal! Alas, the recipe as written, was a 3-star, salty yawn-fest. Sooo for both flavor and some color, I made it again as follows: sauteed in 1 TB butter a minced garlic clove, and about a cups' worth of diced carrot, celery, and onion. Stirred that into the rice (1/2 c.) along w/ 1 1/2 c. beef broth and 1/2 tsp. dried parsley. Baked COVERED at 375 for 1 hr. 15 min. to perfection. Sprinkled the rice w/ a little hot sauce and some green onions, and BLAMMO! Very good indeed.

Great recipe!  I used regular broth but did not add any other salt. I also used olive oil instead of butter.  I added chopped garlic, dried onion and Italian seasoning.  Cooked for an hour and then added about 1/2 cup of water and continued cooking for another 20 min.  Perfect!

Followed recipe exactly.  Took over 90 minutes to cook it uncovered.  The rest of dinner had to sit and wait.  730 dinner time was blown out of the water.  Will try it again, but cook it COVERED and allow for the extra time.

As written, I can see why others found this dish so salty. So,I took the advice from others and I substituted 2T olive oil for the butter, used fresh garlic instead of garlic salt and added just a dash of seasoned salt. I also used low sodium broths. Simple ingredients with yummy results!

I didn't think this was tasty. Not only was it bland but it was way too creamy. Not how I like my rice.

Very easy to do. Make sure you bake it 1hour and 30 minutes and stir at least couple times, otherwise the top rice will be hard.

Pretty good. You have to add your own seasonings according to taste.
My rice came out fluffy & not dry at all, accurately cooked covered
at 350 for 1 hour (appeared to be done in 50 minutes, but I let it cook an additional 6-10 min per required) Was concerned about rice being crunchy, but was not at all. Did not use any beef broth & increased the chicken broth by just a smidge. Used low sodium broth
and didn't use any of the salts, but did use a little natural minced
garlic in the jar. The butter that was used was unsalted, seasoned with black pepper, just a tad of Lipton onion soup mix and sprinkled with a seasoning called Spike. Served with baked cornish game hens stuffed with veggies. A definite must have!!

The first time I made this it was a salty crunchy mess.  I wasn't going to give up on it so I made it again.  I used garlic powerder instead of garlic salt and just used a dash of seasoning salt. I also boiled the broth before it went in the oven...cooked in an hour and it was yummy.  It's a keeper with these changes.

We love this way of cooking brown rice! I have done it with all chicken broth or all beef broth or a mix. I even have made it with the 22.5 oz hot water mixed with a packet of dry onion soup mix when I was out of broth base. You can even create a one dish meal out f this! Saute up some chopped carrots, onions and green pepper in olive oil. Then add it along with leftover shredded chicken to the casserole and bake according to orginal directions. When its done add some shredded cheddar and pop it back in the oven to melt. We did this tonight and it was YUMMY! I love this recipe! Thanks so much. =)

This has the most delicious flavor. It was moist and beefy and went perfectly with our meal. I had to bake this an additional 30 minutes though as it was still like rice soup at that point. I did cut the seasoned salt to half as it sounded like way too much for us. We both loved this and I would have rated it higher had the rice actually been ready for dining at the time indicated. This will definitley be used again and again here. Overall, this is a great recipe and could easily become a favorite once I get the rice/liquid ratio straightened out.  Thanks for a winner!

This rice was fantastic.  We eat a lot of brown rice in my family and I've been looking for different ways to prepare it and make it more flavorful.  I did make some changes to this recipe to kick up the flavor and make it healthier.  I sauteed chopped onion and chopped fresh mushrooms in a small pat of butter and a little EVOO until tender and then added that to the mix of ingredients.  I also added a couple of cloves of minced garlic and omitted most of the butter and all of the salt.  Let me tell you how unbelievable the house smelled!! This recipe was very very good!  It isn't very quick but it is a good recipe in the winter when you're already roasting or baking dinner in the oven.

Usually when I make brown rice, even in the rice cooker, it always retains a crunchiness that I can't stand. This method, however, truly softened it up and made for an absolutely delicious sidedish! I actually omitted the butter - you don't need it. I instead added 1 and 1/2 cups of sliced mushrooms, and an extra cup of broth. It was moist and delicious. However, it took much longer than an hour to finish - at 350, it took closer to 2 hours.  But perhaps my oven needs to be calibrated. Thanks for the recipe, I will use it often to prepare brown rice.

I made this in my rice cooker using the suggested amount of liquid with the instructons.  I didn't have broth, so I used bouillon cubes.  As suggested by others I used olive oil instead of butter, garlic powder instead of salt, and I skipped the seasoned salt. Turned out really well, although I think I put a little too much oil in it.  I plan on making it again.

A family favorite with just a few revisions:
2 3/4 c. of broth, either chicken or beef (don't need two kinds), 1 T. olive oil (instead of butter), 1/2 t. garlic salt, 1 t. Original Blend Mrs. Dash seasoning. I bake covered for 50 minutes and then bake it uncovered for 10 more minutes.

This is based on my changes.  After reading reviews I used low sodium beef broth, only 2 tbs butter (did not melt just threw it in the dish), 1/2 tsp seasoning salt, 1/2 tsp garlic salt 1/2 tsp garlic powder.  And this did take 90 mins to bake.

This may be a great recipe, but after increasing the temperature and cooking this for 90 minutes the rice still wasn't done.  I did taste the (hard) rice and the flavor was good, but I almost broke a tooth.

i loved this recipe, really flavorful & makes brown rice more tolerable if it's not your thing:)  definitely need to cover this rice dish when baking or it will not be anywhere close to done in 60 mins!

Great recipe! I used Basmati brown rice, all chicken broth (low-sodium), a little less than 1/4 cup clarified butter, minced garlic, sea salt and threw in a few mushrooms. I cooked it covered since a lot of people did that and it took about 1-1/2 hours. But it was sooo easy and very tasty.

Delicious, I used long grain brown rice, added 2 cloves of minced fresh garlic(in place of garlic salt), fresh chopped onion, and a little shredded carrots and rest of ingredients in the recipe. Baked covered for 45 minutes, then uncovered and baked until liquid was absorbed, about 10 more minutes. Will be making this often.

this was fantastic! i prepared brown rice once before on the stovetop and was disappointed. this was much better. i served it with easy baked tilapia from this site so i added a little old bay instead of seasoned salt to compliment. keeper.

This rice dish was Fantastic!  I made a few changes as other reviewers suggested. I used 2 tbsp. olive oil and omitted the butter. I used 1/2 tsp. garlic salt and about a 1/4 tsp seasoned salt. I think with all the broth you could really leave the salt out altogether, although with the amounts I used it was great. I also chopped about 1/4 cup of yellow onion and crushed 2 garlic cloves and threw them in there. I then covered the casserole and cooked it for 1 1/2 hours at 350.  My whole family LOVED the rice and asked me to please double the recipe next time.  This from people who usually turn their noses up to brown rice when I try to serve it!  Thank you so much for the recipe!

I would agree with the keeping it covered part.  My whole family, kids included really enjoyed this recipe!  I did keep it covered and the end product was so moist and yummy!  I also just used chicken broth (no beef) because it was what I had on hand.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I read the reviews before making this one.  I use 2 bouillon cubes-1 beef and 1 chicken and 2 cups of water.  I use garlic powder instead of garlic salt. 
I also covered my dish with tin foil.  It came out great.  I did spray my dish  with Pam as well.  I just didn't know if this would be something that might stick!  I was really surprised how moist the rice comes out.  I will continue to make brown rice this way!  My 3 year old usually will not eat brown rice that I make on the stovetop, but he loved this!

We LOVE this recipe, but it is very salty if made with CONDENSED beef broth.  We just happen to like it that way and use it to offset more bland meat dishes.  If you don't want it so salty, you need to dilute the broth.  I also have to bake it longer than the hour...usually at least an hour and a half.  Enjoy!

I calculated this recipe for 2 people.  It took over an hour and 10 minutes to bake.  I finally put it in the microwave so it would get done.  Also, way too salty. If I do it again I will make sure the broths are sodium free.

this is my go-to vegetarian recipe. I use dehydrated carrots and mushrooms along with fresh onion and garlic. I also cook mine in the crockpot....it always took too long in the oven (longer than called for)

Absolutely delicious! I do add real garlic and onions because I prefer them. It's a simple side or a great base for a main dish. I've done it as is (with a little less broth), other times I've added grated zuchinni, carrot, and sqaush to it with seasonings of my choice, and I've used the technique with a brown/wild rice blend instead. I've also cooked it up with chicken breasts on top to make a complete one dish meal. Great versatility and great flavor! Thanks!

I followed this recipe to a T. The rice was not tender, it was still hard. What did I do wrong? Is it really supposed to be UN COVERED? I did this recipe twice, and it's really simple which is why I liked it but why isn't my rice coming out right?

This was really good!  Add a handful or two of sliced fresh mushrooms, skip the salt (the broth is salty as is) and cook with a lid on it.  You need the extra broth or the rice will dry out in the oven!  Thanks for a great recipe!

When I search for BROWN Rice recipes, I expected them to use BROWN Rice not white rice which is something else altogether! Perhaps this recipe while looking delicious might be re-named to represent what it REALLY is. Thanks

This was so yummy.  I used 1 can chicken broth, 1 chicken bouillon and 1 cup water (that's all I had).  I also used olive oil instead of butter, and used both garlic powder and 1 clove garlic, and pepper.  I put in the microwave for 10 minutes, then baked at 375 for 30 minutes, then had to nuke for another 5-10 mins to get rice less hard.  This was very tasty, hardy and healthy!

Super tasty and so easy!  I used garlic powder and onion and 3 cups broth. Snuck some lentils in there too.  Cooked as directed, and covered with foil.  needed an extra 15min uncovered to help get rid of extra liquid.

This is a 6 star recipe!  I make it with bouillion cubes when I'm out of broth, and it's still wonderful.  
All 4 kids and my husband are always asking me to make it again! However, I only use 1 cup beef broth and 1 cup chicken broth, with garlic powder instead of salt.  I also cook it covered.  It makes a big difference.

I sauteed finely chopped onion, celery, garlic and carrot in the butter before adding to the rice.  Left out the salt, since the broth had enough for us.  Ended up taking almost two hours for the rice to absorb the liquid and get tender.  Baked this covered and would not try it without covering the pan.  Taste was very good and would make again, just allotting more cooking time.

Yummy rice. I only used chicken broth, didnt use butter, used seasoned salt, and added diced carrots, a handful of frozen peas, diced onion and a clove of minced garlic. Baked at 350 for 80 minutes. Worth the wait!

This was easy and delicious, much better thatn your average stove top rice.  I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown because it's what I had on hand.  I used water instead of beef broth, and cut down on the butter and seasoning salt.  Great!

Yum, this was fantastic!! I used 2 cups homemade no-salt chicken broth. A bit of tone's beef base with 1 c water. We have to eat everything no-salt, but still found this flavorful & delish.

This is one of the best recipes I have EVER found.  I was looking for ways to add more whole grains to our diet, and this was the perfect basic recipe for brown rice.  I have made a number of adaptations; I often use vegetable or chicken stock or just water with chicken bullion.  I have added shredded carrots, fresh mushrooms, fresh basil, chopped tomatoes, (any or all) but my favorite addition is fresh garlic!  Yum!  It smells so wonderful when it is cooking!  Just be sure to use twice as much liquid as rice.  I generally put my casserole dish in the microwave for 5-8 minutes before putting it in the oven to be sure that it finishes cooking.  Great with grilled fish (or any other grilled main dish)  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Absolutely WONDERFUL and SOOO easy!

I sauted some chopped onion, garlic and a couple fresh carrots (very fine - for color) and added it to the recipe. I also used only chicken broth. It wasn't quite done in one hour so I will follow along with another reveiwer and cook it with the lid on. I may cut down on the butter - tastes great but we sure don't need all the fat. I will definitely use the recipe when I'm making rice - it couldn't be easier.

I made a few changes to this recipe.  I used garlic powder instead of salt, salt free seasoning, increased the amount of liquid by 1/2 cup and I added a can of cream of mushroom soup.  I baked it covered for one hour, then I sliced two leftover chicken breast thinly and placed in a single layer over the rice then I sliced cheddar cheese and layered on top of the chicken.  Left it uncovered and baked for an additional thirty minutes.  I have request for this at least once a week.

Very good simple side dish. I don't have  much luck with brown rice on the stovetop so this was definitely a keeper! I substituted a cup of skim milk for the beef broth (simply what I had on hand) and used minced fresh garlic instead of powdered, cooked for about 1 hour & 20 minutes. (I only gave 4 stars since the result is simply plain brown rice but it's Definitely a foolproof way to make)

The mix of flavors is good and the concept is good but the recipe as written is not so good. It was very salty and after 90 minutes the rice was still not done. We ate it partially crunchy. Someone needs to post a correction to this recipe.

Just tried this. I only used chicken broth and substituted water for the beef broth because I didn't have it. Used garlic powder instead of salt and 2T of olive oil instead of butter as someone else recommended. It was VERY good! My husband normally hates brown rice, but he said if I made it like this he would eat it all the time. Nice simple recipe, easy to add to if you wanted.

At 60 minutes the rice was still drowning in about a cup of too much liquid. Either it needed covered (which I thought I should do at first, but chose to follow directions instead)or it needed another 1/2 hour in the oven. But I had timed it to be ready with the rest of dinner so I ended up nuking it for about 13 minutes on high to finish the job. If I do this again, I will cover it and omit the beef broth.

I am trying to gradually wean my family onto more whole grain products, and this rice was a big success! I omitted the butter and didn't miss it (and we are a "Paula Dean" kind of family).  I also substituted fresh garlic for the garlic salt and added some mushrooms. As to the cooking time that some of the other reviews have mentioned, mine was perfectly cooked in an hour.   Will definitely be making this again!

Great way to cook rice.  Use low sodium broth and garlic powder instead of garlic salt to cut down on the saltiness of this dish.

I like the idea of baking the brown rice, but this turned out too salty. Next time I will use water and then see what it needs, I really want it for stir fry, If I were serving as a just a side dish then I would try this again with much less sodium. Just need to tweek this a bit. Its a good recipe , just needs a few changes

I used a few additional spices and all chicken broth instead of beef, so this review is based solely on the cook method - the flavor was really nice.  I cooked this as per instructions, and after nearly an hour and a half, I'd had to add extra water 2-3 times and my rice was STILL crunchy.  We ate all the rest of our dinner and waited for rice... and waited... and waited... I finally pulled it out anyways and just covered it immediately, hoping the steam would soften it up a bit more.  We ate it the next day.  It was edible, but still a bit on the crunchy side.  I've cooked brown rice many times before, so I KNOW it can get softer than that!  Bottom line - I can make rice that tastes identical in a pot on the stove (the baking didn't really do anything magical to the flavor of brown rice for us), in about half the time, and KNOW it will be done with the rest of my dinner.  Sorry, I won't make it this way again.

Has anyone tried boiling the liquids first before cooking?  I have a white rice recipe (done in 30 minutes) where you boil the liquid before cooking and the rice is fluffy and cooked through.  The boiling water would start the cooking process a lot faster and prevent 2 hours of baking.

I'll never make brown rice on the stovetop again. This recipe is absolutely foolproof. The rice comes out perfectly, nutty and light.  I added chopped scallions and sliced fresh mushrooms, once sautéed and once raw, and both variations were delish. 

I use olive oil instead of butter, garlic powder rather than garlic salt, and onion powder rather than seasoned salt as some have suggested.

Leftovers refrigerated and warmed the next day have even more flavour. 

Thanks to kayleew for a great,easy recipe!

I LOVE white rice but I've been trying to eat healthier.  I'm not a fan of brown rice but I tried this and loved it!  I used 2 1/2 cups chicken broth and 1/2 cup of water.  I also used several cloves of fresh minced garlic.  Yum!

this is surprising delish for a brown rice dish. I am not a brown rice fan at all, but recently i have been trying to incorporate it into my meals. this is by far the best recipe that i have tried by far. I followed the recipe except I halved the butter, finely chopped some celery, onions, omitted the garlic salt and used fresh garlic and green and red peppers. my only complaint is that it takes longer than an hour fifteen its more like 2 hours. this is def a keeper. thanks for getting me to eat brown rice, i feel healthier already, lol.

This is a great brown rice recipe. I used broth as written in recipe (I usually have chicken and beef base on hand at all times). I used some garlic powder and no salt. I just used about a tablespoon of butter to cut that back a bit. I used an extra 1/4 c. rice to make sure it was enough for 5, but only increased the chicken broth by 1 1/2 oz. and it turned out perfect in one hour!

OMG! I am WORLD FAMOUS for ruining rice. I've ruined more pots than most people own, burning rice to the bottom for ETERNITY. But thanks to this recipe, I MADE RICE!!! I even just called my mom to tell her! I didn't have any stock but I was determined so I put a few glugs of soy sauce and a few glugs of woostery sauce in a measure and filled the rest of the way up with the appropriate amount of water. Added butter, season salt, garlic and regular salt. Threw a few onion flakes in for grins too. Perfect texture, perfect flavor PERFECT PERFECT PERFECT.

Never really cared for brown rice before.   I added the trinity: carrots, onions, and celery.  I also covered it. It was so creamy and tasty.  I will always bake it in the oven.  Thanks for the great healthy recipie.

This was okay.  Way too salty and I even used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  Next time I would use unsalted butter and no seasoning salt.  Needed an additional 15 min. to cook.  This needs some mushrooms, onions or carrots added.  I would make again but with many changes.

I really liked this rice!  I used brown jasmine rice that I was lucky enough to find at the 99 cent store.  Because several reviewers said it was too salty, I substituted 1 cup chicken broth and about 3/4 cup of water instead of all chicken broth and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  The result was perfectly cooked, flavorful rice that my children and I really enjoyed.  I'll definitely make this again and again!

This is really delicious and easy. I covered it with foil for the whole cooking time. Also left out the seasoned salt and it was great. (sounded like too much salt!)My picky kids gobbled it down.

I give this a 5 star rating because it is simple and very good.  I do only a little tweaking to the recipe, mainly with the time.  I usually add at least 1/4 cup extra rice and bake for close to 1 1/2 hours.  So much better than "instant" brown rice.  We have added this to our regular side dish rotations.

I used a can of chicken broth, water in place of the beef broth, olive oil in place of butter, garlic powder, and ommitted the salt.  It came out great however the cooking time was 1.5 hours.

Wow, I've never been able to make brown rice edible and this is sooooo delicious! Melt in your mouth, thinking about it the next day delicious. I made it exactly as written and it was perfect! I think it took about 10 min. longer to cook in my oven, but it could just be a difference in oven temps. I used Organic California Brown Basmati rice by Lundberg.

Took A LOT longer to cook than recipe says. It also came out very salty and I used low sodium broths. It seemed to be a hit at the party but I didn't like it that much even though I made it.

My husband loved it!  Although it does take quite a bit longer than the cook time listed.  I tried the same recipe on the stove and it turned out the same.  My husband couldn't even tell the difference and it took the normal 45 min on the stove.

Good rice dish!  Baked COVERED with brown rice. CHANGES: Used olive oil instead of butter; garlic powder to reduce salt; and a herbal rub seasoning instead of seasoning salt.  Loved the fact that nothing stuck to dish.  Added just an extra 5 mins to recipe.  Will make again.

Very nice. Super salty as written - we used less broth and a little clear water sub and about 1/2 t less salt and still salty...but good. Subbed a pareve margarine for the butter to make it kosher. So soft and buttery, wouldn't have known it was BROWN rice. Took 1-1/2 hours to cook down for me, not a problem since I made it ahead. Would be good with added pine nuts or pecans. Will make again!

We love this recipe and make it at least once a week!  We add onion and use garlic instead of garlic salt. We also cook the rice covered.  Some people had concerns about the cooking time, but it comes out perfect for us.  The problem others experienced may be because of the rice.  We bought some organic brown rice (it had more fiber) the other day and it did not cook well in this recipe.  It didn't soak up the broth or soften up like regular Uncle Ben's Brown Rice.  It also had a gluey texture.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very Good!  I completely forgot the butter but it was still good.  I added some frozen peas and green onions.  It took about one hour and 20 minutes covered.  We ate about an hour later than expected but it held well in the over with it turned off.

Wonderful! This will become a regular for rice in our house. As many users suggested, I used garlic powder rather than salt and cut back on the amount of seasoned salt. Perfect!

This is really good and satisfying. I did tweak it a bit! Instead of butter I added 1/4 cup of lowfat milk to give it a bit of a creamy flavor without all the fat and calories. I also used more beef broth than chicken because I like it better and I only added the garlic salt and left out the seasoned salt. I used organic beef and chicken broth because they are lower in sodium and don't contain MSG so it wasn't too salty. I added chopped onions but the possibilities are endless! I am going to add some chicken and vegitables next time. One more thing, I cooked this covered for 60 minutes and it was perfect. This is such a good base recipe. Thanks Kaylee!

made some changes: added celery, onion, carrots, used low sodium broth and garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  did not have a problem with it being too salty.  i covered it after the first 30 minutes and it took about 1.5 hrs to finish cooking.

This recipe worked only because of everyone's reviews.  Added, chopped onion, carrots, celery.  cut out all high salt broths, It did take longer then an hour and 10 minutes to cook.  But it was wonderful.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Tried this for dinner party.  Good results...glad I read the other reviews before I made it.  Used brown basmati rice, low sodium broths, garlic powder.  Added sauteed mushrooms and shallots, and added 1/4 cup water.  It took about 1 hour  and 45 mins. (covered for 1/2 the time).  Would make this again.  Thanks!!!

This is a great recipe. Those who've complained about salt must have used concentrated broth or base... it's not a salty recipe. I added shredded carrots, mushrooms, and in the last 5 min., a handful of frozen peas. It turned out wonderfully. I have received several compliments, and passed the recipe on many times.

Holy Salt Batman, next time I will surely read the reviews before cooking it.  I had a lot of the same problems as some of the others did, crunchy, longer cooking time etc. but I think this recipe has potential and next time I am gonna dilute the broth and use garlic powder vice salt, and I will probably omit the seasoning salt and add my own mix of seasons.  All in all it wasn't horrible, just have to work with it.

Great recipe.  I bake covered for the first half of baking time, then uncover at the end.  I often make a double batch and freeze some for later. I use garlic powder instead of salt to reduce salt content.

The recipe was good but needs a longer cooking time with more water.  I used a medium grain brown rice and cooked it for 1 hour and 20 min.  Next Time I will 1/4 cup extra of water and probably cook it for 1 hour and 40 min or so.

This is a good recipe.  I added a little water as others did so soften it up and actually used 1/2 wild & 1/2 brown rice.  Dixiebell must have reviewed the wrong recipe.  This definitely called for brown rice.  I agree though that if you are looking for brown rice recipes all that should come up are recipes using Brown Rice not white.  Will use this one again

Pretty good overall.  Came out very salty and I had to use twice as much liquid as originally called for.  Easy to put together and let simmer in the oven while I worked on the rest of dinner.

Taste was good but after cooking for 1 hr 15mins it still had hard grains. Not really sure why cooking in the oven is considered easier since i made it on the stove a couple days later and it turned out perfect. Then you have a pan with burnt on pieces of rice that you have to clean. Ill stick to doing it on the stove....

Well the flavor was definitely there but way too salty for my taste. Will try this again but with the powder not the all the salt. It did take another 45 minutes at 375 for me to finish this off. Why can't it be cooked in the microwave? I think I will try that the next time.

As far as I am concerned - this is the only way to cook brown rice. It comes out perfect every single time and is delicious. As for the ratio of water/broth to rice - use what is listed on the bag then add a smidge more.

After an hour, there was still liquid and crunchy rice in the dish. It baked about 50 minutes longer and I had to add a bit more water to it. I've noticed that other people have said they had to cook the rice longer as well. Other than that, good stuff!

I do not care for rice!! With that being said I absolutely love this dish. I am on a certain eatting program and I am allowed to have brown rice so I tried to find recipes using brown rice. This recipe sounded easy and it had received alot of stars and compliments. Well this is a great dish and I have already had to share the recipe with family members. Thank you so much for the great recipe.

We make this all the time, but instead of cooking it in the oven, we just cook it in our rice cooker on the brown rice setting. Comes out perfect every time.

Not my favorite.  The rice was too wet for my taste.  I thought it was going to be drier, more like a pilaf.  Instead it was a mushy, sticky mess.  Flavor was okay, but a bit bland, even though I sauteed 2 cloves of garlic and 1 onion and added them to the mixture before putting in the oven.  I also covered the rice like other reviewers said, but maybe I will try again cooking it uncovered like the recipe states.

Also, after an hour covered in the oven, the rice was only about 3/4 of the way cooked.  I uncovered it and continued cooking for another 20 minutes or so to finish cooking the rice and to try to evaporate the extra liquid.  If I try it again and follow the original recipe more closely, I will update my review and rating accordingly.

O.M.G.... I love this recipe 2nd time making brown rice (1st time with this recipe) my hubby loved it!! I actually made it tonight just to try it out so that tomorrow I can have some type of knowledge since am having a little dinner party.  I will not look around for any other recipe. I will thought, try to tweaking this one a little so I can have a tender drier grain. the only problem I encounter was that after about 30 Min at 350 the water wasn't even boiling so I up temp to 400  and I gave it an extra 30 Min total 1 hr 30 min. I also did 2 cups rice and  a 14.5 oz of beef & chicken broth.

My family LOVES rice cooked this way.  Most times I fix it just like recipe...sometimes with a little chopped onion.  SO easy I never make it any other way.

This was very yummy!! I made some changes, I did use the brown rice, butter, garlic and seasoned salt but I also used water in place of the beef broth and low sodium chicken broth to try to make this a touch healthier.  It had to cook for more than an hour - about an hour and 15 minutes.  I also added some chopped vidalia onion and chopped carrots and that made it delicious!!  And just to get creative - we added some plump raisins (after having boiled them to get juicy) and my husband seemed to like that - though I prefer without!  So good though and very creamy!

I followed this pretty closely and have made it about 15 times.  I use fresh garlic and fresh tarragon with one shredded carrot and one diced celery stalk.  I only use one half tsp. salt  We were strictly white rice eaters before I tried this recipe and my kids always ask for this now. I had to up the cooking time to 80 minutes at 375 degrees (convection). Totally worth the wait!

VERY good, for sure a keeper. I added some diced carrots and frozen broc florrets (they turned out a little mushy, but oh well).. I took the advice of another review and used two cups of instant brown rice (I didn't have reg) and it worked out just fine. Also used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.. and used 1/2 the seasoning salt.. and covered with foil during baking. Next time I might add a splash of worcestershire sauce.. but over all, yummy!

I love this rice! It's foolproof, and it also reheats well. The flavor is perfect, and it's always moist. The only changed I make include covering the rice while it bakes, and also I use all chicken broth, and reconstitute it from a chicken base. I use about 3 cups of water and 2 1/2 tsp of the base (instead of 3). This cuts down on the saltiness some reviewers complain of. My toddler practically shoves his face in it.

This was the best brown rice I've ever made! I made some changes, though... instead of beef broth I just added water. I also omitted the butter. I added diced onions and carrots, and may try adding healthy ingredients next time. I just steamed it in a rice cooker instead of baking it in the oven. Thank you so much for the recipe!

Use this all the time and vary it by adding sauted mushrooms and onions.  I do always cook it covered, and it does seem to take more than an hour.

This recipe was BBBBBBoring!  We tried it using other reviewer's suggestions to use low sodium broth and reduced the amount of salt.  It tasted no different then when I make instant brown rice with chicken broth and took a lot longer to get on the table.  Other than the non-instant brown rice being less expensive, I don't see any advantage to using this recipe.

If you are using instant brown rice put 2 cups instead of one! I also added about 1/8 c of vegetable oil in the rice to keep it from sticking to the pan. I also covered the pan with tin foil. It was a little tough with out the tin foil.

I wish I could give this 4 1/2 stars, because its almost just right with all the help of other reviewers.  I used: 1 1/4 cups of brown rice, 2 3/4 cups of chicken broth, 2 T. EVOO, 1/2 tsp. garlic powder and a sprinkle of Lawry's Seasoning Salt.  I also sauteed up half an onion.  I ended up baking this covered for 90 minutes at 375 and stirred a couple of times.  This might sound weird, but to me it tasted like a really good, less salty "real" Rice-A-Roni type dish.  Served with Baked Teriyaki Chicken from this site and broccoli.  The only change I will make next time is to use a reduced-sodium broth.

Loved this recipe. Used 1/2 the butter with 1/2 evoo, garlic powder, no salt. I thought it was plenty salty and was concerned that dh would think it TOO salty, but he ate more than his share, and even had seconds! Thanks, KAYLEEW.

I loved this.  I normally HATE brown rice, but I decided to give this a try.  Used brown jasmine rice from trader joe's, olive oil instead of butter, sea salt in place of seasoned salt, low sodium broths, and garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  Cooked covered for 1 hr 10 minutes.  Served with steamed salmon.  Beyond delicious - I'll never cook white rice again.

After 1.5 hours in the oven, this was still crunchy! I then added over 2 more cups of broth and microwaved it for over 20 more minutes before it was edible. Once cooked, it was very good, but everyone was done with dinner before it was even close to being ready. I used organic brown jasmine rice.

I have never been able to get brown rice to come out right.  It never seems to get tender for me, but this recipe worked!  I followed it pretty closely, only I used fresh minced garlic, cut down the butter to 2 tablespoons and just a sprinkle of seasoned salt.  I baked it covered in a glass Corningware casserole dish at 375 and after one hour, it was done!  And done perfectly.  Thank you so much KAYLEEW.  I can finally cook brown rice!!

This was wonderful. I did make changes based on others recommendations. I doubled the recipe. (I will cut up some chicken and veggies in the leftovers for another meal)I used 4 cups chicken broth as I did not have beef broth and added 1 cup of water. I used 2 T of butter, 1/4 tsp of seasoned salt and 2 tsp of garlic powder. I baked covered in the oven at 375 degrees for 90 minutes. I did stir twice during coooking. My kids ate it and they normally wrinkle their noses at brown rice! Yeah! This will be a regular recipe. Thanks so much Kayleew!

I added some sauteed veggies to this dish and it was really delicious, however it took longer to cook than the recipe called for.  Mine came out rather soupy.  It was excellent the next day though!

I have made this several times.  It is seriously DELISH!!! My suggestions: (1) stir a time or two while cooking to get it done evenly.  (2) I also cook it at 375 and it usually takes just over an hour. (3) reduced sodium broth and garlic power instead of salt.   The amount of butter could be reduced (if you want to save cals/fat) b/c it IS very buttery.

I changed this just a little. I used 1 tbsp. of butter and 1 tbsp. of EVOO and sauteed some chopped shallot, celery and carrots until translucent, then added homemade beef broth and organic FRENCH ONION soup. I did omit the seasoning salt and used garlic powder, as we're trying to cut back on salt. I did add a little more broth to make up for cutting back on the butter. Noone noticed that it was brown rice except me, who thought it was even better than using white. I've not had a problem making rice before, when I used white rice. Working with brown is a little more work. For those of you like me who need a little help, you might want to add a little more broth. Mine was a little dried out, only because it just didn't seem to be done all the way as the time specified in the recipe. I seem to struggle with do I leave the lid on or off, because I was always taught to leave it on with white rice but brown dosen't seem to cook as well with the lid on. NOTE: I served it with Reunion Meatballs, which is also from this site, and steamed broccoli.

I will never make brown rice any other way, ever again!  It came out so creamy!!  I used only 2 cups of fat free, low sodium chicken broth, garlic powder (instead of garlic salt), and used olive oil instead of butter.  I also added 2 of the small cans of mushrooms.  My husband cleaned his plate!  I baked it covered in my Corningware for an hour....and it came out perfect!

I made this in the crockpot.  It turned out a little crispy, but that should be solved with a little stir every now and then.  Since other reviewers complained about the salt, I used minced garlic instead of garlic salt, and decreased the season salt a little.  The overall flavor was very good and I will make again.  Thanks for sharing.

This is the only recipe I ever use for my brown rice.  I typically cook it for at least 1-1.5hrs.  I also use whatever type of broth I have on hand.

I loved this recipe. Served with fish. The rice turned out very flavorful and tender. I ran out of seasoning salt so I replaced with a little chicken flavored seasoning salt and kosher salt. I also added a little parsley for color. Two more things, used low sodium chicken broth and baked covered.

I have to say, not my favorite. I eat a lot of brown rice, and prefer it on the stovetop.

So, I've made this twice. The first time I made it exactly, EXCEPT I forgot to add the butter. My husband found it in the micro. We thought it was ok, but the season salt overpowered it. The second time, YUMMY. I made it like the recipe stated, but just put a few dashes of the season salt. Then I added about a half of cup of onions and some dashes of worcestershire sauce. Next time, I might add some mushrooms. I recomend covering the rice for 60 minutes, and then taking it off and baking until the liquid is absorbed. That's how I cooked it the first time, and it took about 75 minutes to cook. The second time, I didn't cover it and it took way WAY longer.

Delicious, but I'll cut down on salt next time, and ours had to cook 2 hours before the rice was soft.

The traditional stovetop method of cooking brown rice does not work.
Brown rice should be baked in the oven.
Excellent recipe!  Thanks :)

This was great!  My husband loved it!  I just followed a few of the suggestions.  I used reduced sodium broth, cut back on the butter by about 1/2, and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. Oh, and I covered it. It did take a bit longer to cook... about 1hr 20min.  I will definitely make this again!!

Took me a while to find a good brown rice recipe. This is by far the best! I use all chicken broth, minced garlic and cover when it bakes..turns out wonderful. Last time I used 1 cup chicken broth and 1 can of fat free cream of chicken soup. My husband loved the creamy texture the cream of chicken soup added. Served with peas and baked chicken.

Used olive oil in place of butter and covered it. A tasty, easy way to get the nutrition of brown rice.  My 2 year old even LOVED it

We really liked the flavor but, as written, we found it too salty.  Using low-sodium broth plus garlic powder (instead of garlic salt) made it more palatable.

Absolutely the best brown rice recipe!  My family was so upset that I didn't double recipe (no way does it serve 8).  We aren't huge eaters and the rice didn't go far enough, so I definitely recommend doubling recipe.  The only thing I changed was the garlic salt to garlic powder.  I used my own recipe of seasoning salt and used real butter.  My kids ate every bit of this and fought over who had the most on their plate.  I will definitely be making over and over again - thanks for a fantastic recipe!

Great put it in oven and forget it, done perfectly everytime.
I also use orange juice and chicken broth instead of the beef broth for a change.  Really good.  Sue

I would of like to give this 5 stars but it took 1 1/2 hours to cook and I did cover it, also some pieces were still crunchy, but over all this is the best  brown rice we've had. I added 'no salt seaoning' a recipe on this board and decreased the seasoning salt to 1/2 tsp. Very good, I will try and do this on the stove next time. *Dont use a rice cooker they are made for white rice only!
*Update- I've made this on the stove cooking it for 40-45 minutes and it comes out wonderful. This is so much easier than cooking it in the oven. Now it deserves 5 stars.

I thought this was a really good, healthier alternative to white rice.  I cooked it on the stove top for 45 minutes instead of putting it into the oven.  Since we are trying to incorporate more whole grains into our diet, I will definitely be preparing this tasty recipe often for everyday family dinners.

The rice had wonderful flavor. I tried cooking brown rice in a rice cooker and it was still tough. This was a little better. I think I may try it next time covered with foil to see if I can get the rice a little more tender. I did add 1 teaspoon of garlic powder to the mix and it added a lot of extra flavor.

I followed the recipe exactly but the rice turned out so salty that we couldn't eat it!  I ended up throwing out the whole batch.  The only reason I gave it any stars at all is because I think this recipe has great potential and I will rate it again after I modify it a bit.

I make this with brown rice, wild rice, barley, etc.  Whatever the mixture I have on hand...except no white rice.  I add garlic, olive oil, no butter, and some seasoning salt.  This is so easy to make and it is healthy, plus it tastes GREAT.

I can finally make brown rice! Yeah! Okay, I think this recipe is a teeny bit too salty as is so I use garlic POWDER instead of garlic salt and then use the season salt as directed. Also add some pepper for a little flavor boost and some frsh chopped parsley for color after it is cooked. Over all a great jumping of place to get a nice flavorful brown rice.

This rice sure hit the spot!  I did have to cook it for 1.5 hours (covered) but after reading the other reviews, I allowed a little extra time.  I sauteed onions, mushrooms, and carrots in a little olive oil for 7-8 minutes.  When the veggies were soft, I added the cooked rice, a few peas, and 2 T. soy sauce.  This was the perfect combination to produce deliciousness!  My husband enjoyed it even more the next day.  Enjoy!

I thought this rice was very good! I used low sodium chicken stock, half a teaspoon of garlic powder, and I sprinkled season salt over the top when it was done. I also cooked it with the lid on, as everyone suggested, and it took 1 hour and 10 mins.

Bad. After a failed 2 hour attempt and the rice still being hard I vowed to always cook on stove top again. It was way to salty and buttery. Nothing impressed me. I would however cook it on the stove with a cup of chicken stock for a dash of added flavor. Save yourself sometime and pass this one by

I was dissappointed by this dish.  I cooked it covered for an hour as another reviewer suggested, and it was very soupy, so I cooked uncovered for an extra 25 minutes.  It was very salty, and I think there was too much butter.  I don't see how this is a healthy recipe when it has that much butter in it.  I would use half of the butter called for next time, although I probably won't be making this again.  It was almost.....greasy?

I don't know what I did wrong, but after 1.5 hours of baking the rice was still rather hard. This just didn't work for me.

This is a very good recipe. My husband and I are trying to eat less white rice and this recipe offers a great substitution. I did add mushrooms and used only beef broth since I was serving it with beef kabobs, and it came out great! Will definitely be making this again.

I am surprised at how much I disagree with all the other reviewers.  Our household is really trying to cut down on fat and calories and the 1/4 cup butter was just too much (400 calories!!!).  We also thought it made the rice kind of greasy tasting.  Instead of this recipe, I will continue cooking rice on the stovetop, using chicken AND beef broth (which is a GREAT idea, Kaylee!) and skip the butter, the baking time, and bunch of extra calories.

I forgot the beef broth so i substituted water in place of the beef broth and also added peas and green onions which another member recommended.  It came out delicous!!  I did leave it in the oven for about 1 hr and 20 minutes.  I also stirred the ingredients halfway through.  Great recipe!!

I changed this quite a bit but it made a great base, I would firstly reccomend cutting back on the salt maybe use garlic instead of using garlic salt.  I added 1/2 cup of green lentils.  I also brought stock to boiling point  and soaked the rice       and lentils for approx 20mins before actually cooking them. Then I added the butter covered it and put it in the     microwave for 30mins I also stirred in caremelized onions at end...it was lovely...maybe i should submit a new recipe!!

I should have read the reviews before making this.  It is very salty and after 2 hours the rice was still crunchy.  We won't be making this again.

This rice was very tasty.  As per other reviews, I used 1 cup beef broth, 1 cup chicken broth and 1/2 cup of water. I added garlic powder (about 2 teaspoons) and ommitted the salt.  It took my rice 1.5 hours to cook in the oven and I stirred it every 1/2 hour. So tasty! Thanks Kaylee.

I used a store bought "Royal Blend Texmati premum rice mix" (mix of basmati, white, brown, wild and red rices). It turned out great and was very easy to make. I baked it a bit longer to allow all the liquids to cook out and also because I like "crispies"!!!

I too had trouble with the cooking time. I did add more liquid and baked 45 mins longer. ALso, to reduce the high level of sodium, I used garlic powder, and low sodium broths. It does have good flavor, but I won't replace our famliy's favorite brown rice.

This was so good.  I fixed it exactly like the recipe only using low sodium broths and covering it.  I stirred it up, popped it in the oven and went out running errands.  Couldn't have been easier.

I really liked this recipe.  I read the reviews first and I'm glad I did. This dish was creamy and delicious.  Some changes I made:
sautee 1/2 onion chopped in 2 tbsp olive oil
add 12 ounces sliced mushrooms, sauteed
Add the rice, sautee 5 minutes, add spices and stir.  
Use 1 cup chicken broth, 1 cup beef broth plus 1 cup water.  Cooked at 350 for 2 hours stirring twice during cooking.

This rice has great flavor, but is a little salty for my taste.  It makes 2 1/2 C of rice, so I got five, 1/2 cup servings.  The recipe says it serves eight.  I think less than a half of a cup would be too small of a portion.  I might make this again, but will probably look for something else.  I am not sure how to solve the salt problem, but LOVED that I could just put the rice in the oven and walk away for an hour.

OK - quite salty, I suggest you use a bit of water (maybe 1/2 cup and reduce each stock by 1/4 cup).  You really don't need the extra table salt unless your broth is low sodium.  Half of my family, including me, enjoyed it; the other half really didn't.  It may have had something to do with our very old brown rice though!

I would have given it five stars except you really do need to cook it for an hour and a half instead of just an hour.  Brown rice just takes longer to cook.  Next time, I think I'd stir it every half hour or so as well since the sides and top were kind of crispy.  Very good though.

I followed reviews and used low sodium broths, diluted with water, only one tbsp of butter, no added salt, and covered the dish. It cooked perfectly and actually NEEDED salt so I ended up adding it at the end, which was fine!  Does cook perfectly in the oven with less risk of burning. I uncovered for a few minutes at the end to boil off the remaining liquid.

Sautéed garlic in butter added 3 cups of water with organic chicken bouillon brought to a boil.  Added one cup of white rice in a prepared casserole dish added  salt, pepper and Cayanne and bullion mix. Covered with aluminum foil baked at 375 for 45 min it was perfect! Thank you!!!

I made this. I subbed the garlic salt for garlic powder and seasoning salt for minced onion as per previous review. I also used all chicken broth. I cooked it uncovered for about 25 minutes at 350 degrees and the rest of the time at 400 degrees because the fish I was cooking need to cook at that temp. I cooked it for about 1hr 10 minutes. I was kind of sticky and slightly mushy. Not bad though. My husband is African and he didn't seem to have any problem with the texture of the rice. Any ideas on how to get my rice not so mushy?

I loved the flavor, however, I didn't follow the recipe exactly; 1.  because I didn't like the idea of garlic in my rice dish and 2. I didn't have either broths, so I used bouillons instead, so I omitted the salt as well.  Great way to cook brown rice and it's so much healthier than white, so I didn't feel guilty for wanting more!  I should have taken my picture earlier, because now there is no more rice.

This recipe sounds good to read! However, it is so salty, and takes much longer to cook! Did I mention that it is  so salty?! I tried pouring off some of the liquid at the end of the hour and added water. By the way, the rice was not done!  Then, I tried putting some slices of white potato in it,  because this should have absorbed the salt. Another reviewer said they used the microwave after the oven, did that. I put sliced white potato in it to absorb the salt,  that  didn't work! I tossed it, and cooked brown rice on the stove, using water and a dash of salt.
I think I'll find another brown rice recipe next time!

Finally....brown rice I can do. White rice has never been a problem for me, but my brown rice was always mushy outside and crunchy inside. Not anymore! Thank you. Delicious and easy recipe. I leave these ingredients out for my boyfriend to throw in the oven before I get home, so the whole meal is ready together.

This was outstanding! I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  Totally fool proof!!

I usually don't write reviews but I have to say that the rice tasted great. This is my first time cooking brown rice in the oven. I made a few changes after reading several reviews. I used the following: 1 cup rice(rinsed), 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth, 1 pkg Lipton onion soup mix(combine with 2 cups hot water before adding), 3/4 tsp garlic powder, 2 tsp unsalted butter. Stir ingredients well in the casserole dish, cover, and cook for 1 hour.

The best rice I have ever made. I have made four time in the past 7 days. I cooked a pound of ground beef and added a bag of frozen veggies to the rice when it was cooked. Very affordable and so good.

Good flavor and EASY..however, I had to turn up the oven to 375 after 50 min because I wasn't seeing anything happening. Then I cooked it for another 45 min and it still wasn't quite done. By this time we were starving and just ate it. I'll jack the heat up to 400 next time and see what happens. Not writing it off just yet though.

I used a box of Near East Whole Grain Blends, Roasted Pecan and Garlic and combined it with this recipe.  I used 1 cup beef broth and 1 cup of chicken broth, omitted the seasoning listed in the recipe and replaced it with the seasoning packet from the box then added the melted butter and baked it.  It was fantastic!!  Will make again.

Great recipe, I did lower the overall sodium content however, darn dietary restrictions...by using low sodium broths, unsalted butter and garlic powder instead of garlic salt as other reviewers had done. Served it alongside Broiled Scallops and Sugar Snap Peas. This was a wonderful way to dress up brown rice, thanks Kaylee for sharing your recipe!

Pretty good.  The time is a bit off for my oven; I had to bake an extra half hour, and the rice was a bit too soft for my liking when it was all said and done.  however, easy cooking method and not very time consuming (I don't mind long bake times--means I can do something else in the meantime!), so worth playing around with.  Flavorful, too.  Bf scarfed it down, and he's not the biggest fan of brown rice.  Thanks for the recipe!

I had gotten away from cooking rice when it was just my husband and I , but added it back to the menu after having kids.  I try to use the healthier, brown rice and this was a really good way to cook it.  Turned out better than instruction on bag.  I added carrots and peas to get veggies in and everyone liked it that way too.

This recipe was great!  All 5 kids said this was their favorite rice.  After reading the other reviews, I did use garlic powder instead of garlic salt, EVOO instead of butter and omitted the season salt.  Love that I can make it in the oven!  Thanks for the recipe!

Great Flavour! Used 1 cup of rice, 1 cup each of beef/chicken broth, butter and garlic powder.  Baked covered, at 350 for an hour and 15 minutes.  Worth the wait!

Rice turned out just right.  Took an extra 10 minutes for me, covered with foil.  I made it a main dish by adding a cup of broccoli, one chicken breast and some cheese.  Next time I will leave out the butter if adding cheese.

Made this for Sunday dinner - put it all together and set the oven on time bake.  Cooked it covered, when we got home there was still some liquid in the rice, so uncovered it and cooked it about 15 minutes longer.  Turned out perfect.  Great way to have the healthiness of brown rice without having to wait 45 minutes while it cooks on stovetop.  I doubled the recipe, and used all chicken broth rather than a combo of beef and chicken.  Used garlic pwder rather than salt.  Was liked by all at my table.

I'm a big rice lover and found this recipe so easy and delicious.  I added two cloves of garlic chopped and only used chicken broth.  Great dish for when you have guests because you can put it in the oven and forget about it.  It was in the oven for almost and hour and a half and I stirred it a couploe of times.  Yummy!!!

very good! we covered it until the last 15 min. Added some chopped carrots, and substituted the water for beef broth and used half brown and half white rice. Great as leftovers also---a bit of teriyaki sauce is a good add-on, too! will keep using this recipe, the best I have found for moist rice, without stickiness or overcooking.

I love this rice.  I added a little extra water, doubled the cooking time.  Instead of using canned broth I used Tones chicken and beef soup base  (the kind you can get at Sam's).  I make my rice in large quanties and then freeze it in baggies with 2 or 3 cup baggies.  This batch I used for an amazing chicken fried rice.  This was the best batch ever.  It had great texture and didn't get mushy in the wok.  I will be roasting all my rice from now on.  Great recipe thank you.

Never thought to put brown rice in the oven.  I used my microwave/oven and my covered baker from Pampered Chef - the best brown rice has ever turned out!  Also love the combination of flavors, again, wouldn't have thought of it on my own.

It's a really easy way to cook brown rice, but it should be covered, not uncovered. If you cover the rice it will turn out really soft and fluffy, just the right texture as coming out from rice cooker.

We love this!  I'm not sure what those who needed to cover did wrong but this is perfect just as it is.  I don't add additional salt, just some garlic powder and some green onion if we have it.  I think it would certainly be salty if I added it.

this is the only way I will make brown rice. If you want to cut fat you don't really need the butter.I do cover with foil before putting lid on and cook for 60 minutes let rest for 10 minutes before removing foil.

The last time I made brown rice was several years back due to the experience of eating what felt like small pebbles...This was abolutely the BEST brown rice i've ever had. It was definitely buttery, but DELICIOUS. Will plan for a weekly addition to replace white rice. (Note to self: cook 1.5 hrs and covered)

I used all chicken broth because I didn't have beef, and definiltey go with low-sodium (I didn't have any once and it was very salty).  I have gotten many compliments when I have made this recipe.  Yummy and healthy!

This took too long to cook! I read other reviews and thought I might be better off to cover the rice. I cooked at 375 for one hour and it was like soup still! I ended up cooking it for an addtional 20 minuites in the microwave! It was too salty as other have said. Perhaps leaving the lid off would have helped, but I wont be trying to find out. Sorry.

I tried baking rice once in the oven years ago and decided it isn't for me.  So, with this recipe I sauteed a large clove of minced garlic in about 1 Tablespoon of olive oil in a large saucepan.  Then I toasted the rice for a bit and added water since I didn't have any broth.  I also added the 1 teaspoon of seasoning salt but not the garlic salt.  After bringing it to a boil, I lowered the heat to let it simmer for about an hour.  It was so delicious and I am definitely going to make this a lot!

I own a rice cooker and have never cooked rice any other way. However, I was cooking Salmon with Pineapple Tomato Salsa and the oven was going to be anyway (highly recommend the salmon!). It took more than an hour (about 1.5) to fully cook however, but it was worth it. Light and fluffy! I also covered it with foil because I read reviews and didn't want crunchy rice. Will make again!

I have always hated brown rice until now. Delicious and moist. However I did have to cook it for 90 minutes also but it is well worth it.

O how I LOVE the helpful reviews on this site.  I added almost 1/2 cup more rice to the recipe so that all the liquid would absorb. (Worked out great for leftovers!) It still took over an hour to finish cooking. I kept the dish covered for the first hour then uncovered for 15-20 until the last of the liquid was absorbed.  Even with that short time being uncovered it got a little crunchy on top.    
I added steamed peas and a handful of roasted peanuts and peanut dust from the bottom of a jar before serving. 
The kids really liked this except one commented that it was "too buttery" so I'll cut back on that next time. 

I served it with a whole baked chicken. 
After dinner I pulled all the meat off the carcass, shredded it, added it to the leftover rice, froze the whole thing and now the sitter will be able to give the kids a home-made meal next week.  Yippee!! all the way around.

I just love this recipe!!  It just doesn't get much easier than this.  My kids werent too sure about "brown" rice since they are used to white- but they all loved it.  My husband is not a rice lover at all and he asked for seconds.  This is now a staple in our house.  Thank you for the "cook it covered" tip- it came out perfect.

Yum!! The only thing I could add is to stir around the edges halfway through because when mine was done and I stirred it and poured in bowl there were a lot of crunchy ones that got mixed in.  I added 1 Tbsp. of minced fresh garlic too.  But I will definately be making this for years to come.  Thanks for sharing.

We are trying to eat more brown rice so I tried this recipe.  It was very good but next time I will use a little less butter.  I will make it again.

This is a great recipe. I have made it twice. the first time, I used all homemade chicken stock and the second time, I used low-sodium chicken broth and then some of the drippings from a pork roast I had made earlier in the week. Both times it was absolutely delicious! It needs to be cooked at a higher temperature - the first time I think I did 375 and it was cooked more evenly than the second time (started at 350 and then remembered to turn it up to 365).  Other than that, I think the only change I make is to add three cloves of fresh, minced garlic to the pan before baking. So good!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I altered it following some of the recommendations here.  I added garlic powder instead of garlic salt, and added some onions.  Next time I would cut the butter in half as I thought it was too buttery, and I would try it with some of the other recommendations such as with mushrooms, a can of Rotelle, or maybe some brocolli or peas.

I use Brown Basmati rice, but most of the recipes I use are bland.  My family isn't too fond of rice (probably because the dishes typically taste so bad).  I used 2 cups of organic chicken broth, onion flakes, garlic salt, seasoned salt and butter. It was great!  Fluffy, nicely cooked and the taste was fabulous.  Even my non-rice eaters gave it rave reviews. Barely a small serving left over. I did cook it with my casserole lid on throughout the hour.

For the record, this makes six 1/2 c servings.  I took other's suggestions and used low sodium broths, unless I used bouillon cubes.  I also used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and only used 1/2 teaspoon of seasoned salt.  I turned up the oven to 375 and cooked for 75 minutes.  You can also switch the beef and chicken broth amounts if you have more of one than the other.  Good healthy and hearty recipe, even if you don't like brown rice.

Wow, I should have read the negative reviews on this one before I started.  I had the same experience over 2.5 hours in the oven and it still isn't done.  Plus way too salty.

I didn't have beef broth so I used one can of low sodium chicken broth and 1c of water.  I just guesstimated the seasonings and added some chopped carrots. Even with a cover, this took about 1.5 hrs to cook at 350 but it came out fluffy and moist.  So tasty.  Will definitely make again, I'll just start earlier next time!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I just made this using all chicken broth.. and while the flavor is good, it's way to salty. So maybe next time I'll take the advice of others and use low sodium broth or something. Also, it took an hour and a half to cook.

I'm so glad to finally find a recipe that makes brown rice taste good.I read the reviews & used a little minced garlic & less seasoning salt because I thought the broth would make it salty. I think it still needs the salt, though. I baked mine covered for 1hr 30mins, it came out great! I will make this again maybe with some additions(minced onion,celery,mushrooms)Thanks!

I was never successful at making brown rice correctly until now.  This was wonderful.  My son was weary at first given my history with brown rice, but he loved it.  It was a little too buttery so I may use less or no butter next time, but other than that it was great.

I cooked the rice according to the recipe (minus playing with the seasonings a bit), and it took WAY longer than an hour to be done. The flavor was good, although next time I'll probably use low-sodium broth (as others have recommended) and use a little less butter to cut down on the liquidity of it.

This is a great way to eat brown rice.  My husband, who doesn't like rice, even liked it.  My mother in law gave me a similar recipe that uses white rice.  I used garlic powder instead of salt since several other reviews said it was too salty.  Thanks for a great brown rice recipe.

I love this recipe as does my family! I keep it pretty much the same.The only thing I change is I use garlic powder instead of garlic salt and low sodium broths. The seasoned salt has enough salt in it imo.

Good. Sort of had the same flavor as Ramen noodles, but was a good basic rice dish.  I cooked it in the microwave instead of the oven to keep from heating up my oven.

My family has been apprehensive about even trying brown rice but I made this for them and they loved it!  It has become a fam fav. So much better than the typical white rice.

The rice tasted good but took 2 and a half hours to cook. Will probably use a rice cooker next time.

Thought this was GREAT but do take note to increase the cooking time.  I ended up going about 1 1/2hrs.  It really tastes good.

This was a very flavorful recipe.  I followed the advice of someone else and did all chicken broth and it was delicious! I would make one change however, I would cut the butter in half, as it leaves a greasy film in your mouth.  I normally cut the amount of butter in recipes down but thought I should try the recipe "as is".  My husband, who is all for enough butter in a recipe, even commented on how buttery it was and requested that next time we cut down.

the flavor was pretty good, instead of using chicken and beef broth i used bouillon cubes and dissolved them in water. i had to bake it for nearly an hour and a half, and it still came out crunchy. i probably wont make it again.

I'll give this a 4 because as is would be kind of boring. I added to mine and thought it was great. I didnt use the beef broth, used fat free low sodium chick and about 1 cup of some homemade turkey gravy I had in the freezer, so I left out the butter. I also added a clove of garlic, a handful of fresh herbs from the garden, a small diced onion and some finely diced grilled chicken-1 boneless breast. I cooked it covered and it did take more than an hour to absorb all the liquid, I served it with steamed broccoli. I salt and peppered mine at the table(my hubby doest use it)

I think I would have liked this if the recipe had been more clear on what kind of brown rice.  I used regular brown rice, not instant, and after an hour in the oven the rice was quite crunchy.  It had nice flavor, but it just didn't get done.

I liked the flavor, but my rice came out way too crunchy.  Not cooked and I cooked it almost 1 and 3/4 hours... still too raw for me.  I will try again, but this recipe did not turn out as easy as it sounds.

I made this last night to go with venison casserole and it was really good.  I used real garlic, only chicken stock (all I had) and normal salt.  I also use a mix of brown and wild rice which we really enjoy.  I cooked this covered for about 40 minutes, stirred it and then cooked uncovered for about 30 minutes.  It had a soft nutty flavour which I will want to use again.

because of this recipe I've fallen in love with brown rice. I tried other ways of making it, and very seldom did it turn out. This is perfect!! Brown rice is so much healthier and now we can trully enjoy it. thanks for such a great and easy recipe.

Wonderful! added no salt, used only chicken broth and cooked it covered for an hour then for an additional 40 minutes uncovered. The rice was tender, and had mild flavor. I might dress it up next time with some veggies, serve it with chicken or beef. A wonderful recipe for brown rice, despite the lengthy cook time.

I grudgingly bought brown rice at the store in an effort to improve my family's diet.  I was pleasantly surprised by how fluffy and flavorful this recipe was--soooooo much better than our stand-by instant rice.  Even my toddlers loved it.  I stuck it in the oven with tons of fresh garlic and pepper and forgot about it for about 40 or 45 minutes.  When it started to smell wonderful I checked on it and it was perfectly done.  This healthy whole-grain dish will be a regular on our table.

This is the absolute best brown rice I have ever tasted. Very flavorful. The first time I made it, like some of the other reviewers noted, it was a little salty. I'm making it a second time now without adding the salt (I think the broth has plenty of sodium). I don't usually have beef broth, so instead of adding a can of beef broth, I used 2 cans of chicken broth. I also cut down on the butter to 2 tablespoons (as I thought 1/4 cup was a little much). Also, using the suggestions of other reviewers, I cover the dish with foil. The rice practically came out perfect my first time fixing it (which is quite an accomplishment for me being such a novice cooker). Now that I know how to make great brown rice, I don't know if I can ever go back to plain white rice. This rice is definitely a keeper!

Way to salty.  Baked for 60 minutes and then microwaved for 20 and it still wasn't done.  If I make it again I will omit the seasoned salt and change the garlic salt to garlic powder and cook for at least 2 hours.

I'm  not sure what I did wrong, but my rice was no done in 1 hour - I had to extend cook time and increase heat.  It was also very salty.  I will try making again, with some adjustments b/c it's a convenient way to make brown rice.

I think this is the best rice I've ever had in my life.....LOL!  I told him this to my husband who just "tolerates" rice and his reply was "yeah right".  We ate the ENTIRE pan, just the two of us.  I cooked it covered, added minced garlic, and a cayenne pepper.  I served it with roasted chicken and a vegetable medley.

This was excellent! I made a few changes as other reviewers suggested. I used 2 tbsp. olive oil and omitted the butter. I used 2 Tbl. minced garlic and about a tsp seasalt. I used 2 cups of low sodium beef broth cooked it for 1 1/2 hours (uncovered) at 350. My family loved the rice, and I love a healthy alternative to white rice, and very simple. I served this with Super Spicy Mongolian Beef (from this site) and it was an instant hit.

The rice turned out very well!  I used olive oil instead of butter and covered the dish with a glass lid during baking. Thanks for sharing this recipe. :)

The rice was NOT done in an hour.  Perhaps covering it would help, but if you leave it uncovered be sure to allow at least an hour and a half.

Excellent recipe. I used dill in mine as someone suggested,as well as olive oil instead of butter and it came out wonderful. This will be the recipe I will use for cooking brown rice from now on. And its healthy to boot..

This is an easy dish to make when you are busy but want to serve a healthy side dish.  I like brown rice better than white and this is surprisingly tasty, even the kids like it.

The rice was a little salty but overall had a very good flavor. I also had to cook it covered for about an hour and a half to get it tender enough to enjoy. My brother is a very picky eater and he loved this rice.

This tastes great and is easy to make, but it definately takes longer than stated.  I cook mine for about 1 hour 45 minutes and cover it with tinfoil for the first hour.  With the extra cooking time it comes out perfect.

I give this 4 and not 5 stars only because we had to cook it for about 40 minutes longer than the recipe said- but the taste was fantastic!!  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I just made this and it is absolutely delicious. I put in a little more beef broth than the recipe called for.  And it took about 1 hour and 20 minutes for it to completely bake.  I also used minced garlic but overall, I think it is devine.

I have never cared for brown rice, but this recipe intrigued me.  It was wonderful!  I did cover it while it was in the oven, and it took about 1 hour and 20 minutes to reach perfection.  I then let it sit, still covered, for another 10 minutes, uncovered, stirred and served.  It was a huge hit!  A great way to serve brown rice.

This rice dish sounds delicious.  I gave it only one star because it has butter and beef broth and was recommended to make with chicken for a Yom Kippur meal.  Mixing dairy and meat is a no-no!  Whoever put this meal together, needs to be more mindful of the Jewish dietary laws (kashrut) before recommending meals to prepare.

VEry good recipe...please note: I had a lot of liquid after an hour, I covered the rice and let it rest outside of the oven for 10 minutes and that helped quite a bit. Some of the most flavorful rice I've ever made

Yum! I make brown rice frequently, but never thought to cook it in the oven. I did add some minced shallots and garlic... and it needed to cook waaaay longer than directed. But, it turned out very well. Thanks, Kaylee, for a great recipe!

I added in a can of mushrooms & a chopped up onion & that added lots of flavor. While this dish had a nice flavor, the rice turned hard in the oven. So flavor good, texture bad. Next time I would either attempt to make this dish on the stove top as you would normally make rice, or I'd add more liquid & cook till cooked, but still a little liquidy so as to not make it hard.

This recipe was really good but way to salty.  The kids loved it and it was easy to make.  Next time I'll cut back the salt by half and use one cup of broth and one cup of water.  Also, it took atleast 1 1/4 hours until all the liquid was absorbed.  Definately a tasty side dish!

This turned out way too salty....I think next time it needs less sodium broths and cut back on the salts.  It also was a bit cruncy, so longer  cooking time.

This tasted good, but I had to save it for the next nights dinner since the cooking time was too short and it was not done in time.  I finally put it in a pan on top of the stove to finish cooking.  It took over 2 hours to get done.

I wanted so much to like this, but when I pulled this out of the oven after one hour, it was not done yet. Also, it was very salty. Next time I make, I will cut down on the seasoning salt and bake longer.

I'm really not sure why I had so much trouble with this recipe.  I used vegetable broth instead of beef and chicken and along with leaving out the seasoning salt made no other alterations.  I checked my measurements and still don't know where I went wrong.  I had to DOUBLE the ammount of liquid (broth) and it took 2 HOURS to cook!!! My oven temp was correct, so I really don't know what happened.  I checked it after 1 hour (excited thinking it was done for dinner) ~ then added 1 cup broth and baked another 30 minutes, still not done, then added 1 more cup broth (4 total) and finally after 2 hours it was done.  The taste was fine, but we didn't eat it since dinner was way over.  Sorry but I would like a little better accuracy in a recipe, I noticed others (not all though) had the same problem I did.
