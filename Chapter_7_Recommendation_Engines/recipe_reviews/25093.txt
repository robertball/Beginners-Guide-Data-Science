These are great!!  With a cup of butter I don't see how the other reviewers thought they were dry.  Anyway,  it helps to make sure the marshmallow layer is completely cool before you spread on your frosting. I popped mine in the freezer for a bit.  I actually made a double batch of the frosting and that gave a nice thick layer of chocolate on top.  Yummy.  Don't worry about measuring the marshmallows exactly.  Just a nice covering on top is enough.

I really shouldn't review this since I made so many mods.  But, I just used a box of low fat brownies mix and baked according to directions.  Then added mallows.  Made fudge frosting with 1/2 c. butter, 1/4 cup cocoa, 6 T milk-heat and stir until boil.  remove from heat, add 4 c powdered sugar.  Top brownies with when cooled.

My grandmother used to make these, and I was thrilled to find the recipe to look and taste the exact same!  I followed it exactly, but doubled the frosting as one reviewed suggested.  They turned out great.  I let them cool in the pan for 30 minutes, then put the pan in the freezer while I made the frosting.  These were a hit at my family's Thanksgiving dinner.  Everyone remembered them and thought they were great.

These were not the marshmallow bars we thought we were getting. Be careful with the sauce to "spread over the melted marshmellows" Ours just smeared into one spot, removing the marshmellows from the top. If you make the sacue to spred over the top too soon, it will harden before you can do anything with it.  Once we remade the sauce, and  just poured it over the top, they came out pretty tastey.

These were awesome.  Only change I made was topped with 1/2 bag of marshmallows, not full.  There isn't a need to change anything.  Yum!

My kids loved this.  I reduced baking time from 30 to 20 min and it was still a bit dry.  If I made it again, I would use a moister brownie recipe for the bottom layer.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this on Saturday 03/12/2011.  I loved them, my whole family loved them but, they were even better the next day after I left them in the refrigerator.  So eat them warm eat them cold, do your self a favore just bake and eat them.

I thought that this was way too sweet, particularly due to the frosting. Also, the bottom part is more like cake than fudge. Even after cooled, it was difficult to cut because the marshmallows were so gooey.

The ONLY thing I did not like about the frosting was the fact that I should have sifted the powder sugar and gotten rid of the tiny sugar clumps.  My fault, this recipe ROCKS!

Love this recipe. My mom used to make brownies like this when I was growing up and she has lost the recipe and thinks she can dump ingredients and create the same thing. Which has not been successful. This was exactly what I was looking for. GREAT!!!

I agree. It was more like cake than fudge. I think I'd get better results with a brownie mix than using this recipe. Also, I wish I would have used the mallow cream instead. Finally, I used powder, but some more precise directions would be nice. Overall, it made my tummy hurt after eating a piece.

I was disappointed only in that there seemed to be at least a third too much marshmallows (I had to search for the right-sized package) and the frosting set up so quickly it clumped resulting in not covering the marshmllows sufficiently. The flavors were great!

I tried this recipe lastnight.  I had to being something in to work for the staff and this is what I picked.  I changed the recipe so that is was gluten free.  The staff loved it.  The only this some of us found is that the frosting was to sweet.  Next time I might try using a different frosting.

These were very difficult to cut because of the sticky marshmellow on top.  They were not very chocolately either.  If anyone is planning on making these I would recommend they add 1/3-1/2 cups cocoa.

I didn't think these were fudgy at all.  They were more like a cake than a brownie.  I would use a different brownie recipe next time and then double the frosting recipe.

Holy - so great.
I listened to other comments and I doubled the topping, and put the bars in the freezer to cool before topping goes on. 
I cooled the final product in the fridge, but take out for awhile before slicing, because they are hard to slice right out of the fridge.
Really, really delicious.

maybe it was the altitude (I live in WY at almost 7000 ft) but these turned out really bad the first time I made them.  16 oz of mini marshmallows seemed to be WAY too much.l..I ended up using about the amount from a 10 oz bag.  The frosting was so thick it would not spread over the marshmallow layer.  Any hints or advice would be much appreciated since the picture of this dish looks amazing...not at all what mine looked like.

Followed recipe exactly.  Chose this recipe based on ingredients on hand at home.  Not bad, but not a fan of the top chocolate layer.  It hardens and is very sweet.
