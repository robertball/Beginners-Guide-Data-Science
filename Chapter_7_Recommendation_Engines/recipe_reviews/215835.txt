Very good! The only thing is to be sure that you get all the extra water off the Zucchini. Other than that, I baked it a little longer, about 30 minutes because I like the cheese a little crispy. I can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow!

this was really good.  I made it exactly as instructed.  Feels like something else good be added, but good nonetheless.  Tastes almost like spaghetti.

This recipe is a great start!  My only complaint is that it ended up WAY too watery after boiling the zucchini.  Next time I'll make sure to dry the zucchini much better - but I will definitely make this again!

We LOVED this dish!  I tweaked it, but not much and WOW, did we love the original recipe with a few modifications.  I sliced the zucchini super thin and layed it out on the kitchen island on paper towels with paper towels on top covered with heavy pans on top of it to draw out the "water" from the zucchini.  I added red pepper flakes and black pepper to the sauteed onions.  Then I added prepared creamed spinach to the onion mixture.  All in all, this tasted like true parmesan.  Fantastic!  Thanks for a great recipe, Mary Jo.

Has anyone besides me noticed there's no Parmesan in this?  I added about 1/2 cup on top.  While I was sauteeing the onion, I drained the zucchini in a collander, and then I pressed it with several thicknesses of paper towels.  No excess moisture problem.  While it's not the prettiest dish, it certainly tasted really good, and I'll definitely make it again.
