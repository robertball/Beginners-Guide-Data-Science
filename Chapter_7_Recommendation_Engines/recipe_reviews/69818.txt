This recipe is very good however for best results soak the squid in 2 cups of buttermilk for 2 hours, it makes it very tender then drain in a colander, dump all of the squid into flour mixture but up the amount of flour to 2 cups and toss with your hands and then deep fry, I also don't add the oregano, don't really know why but I like it without.

Better than most restaurant calamari.  We added cayenne seasoning and Emeril's Essence to the flour mixture, and it gave it a great kick.

So light the calamari almost floats off the plate. I've tried many different recipes but now my search is over. This is one I'll engrain in memory and use from now on. Thanks for submitting it.

I made these last night for Superbowl and they were delish. The only change I made was to add some cajun seasoning. The secret to any calamari is too NOT OVERCOOK.

I made some changes to this recipe, first I placed the sliced calamari in the buttermilk and added some emeril's bayou blast and allowed it  to sit for 20 minutes. Then I took some flour and added some bayou blast to the flour. I dredged the  calamari in the flour mixture and sifted to remove the excess. Then I deep fried it until slightly golden in color, about 2 to 3 minutes. Then afterwards I drained it, and sprinkled about 1 tsp bayou blast, and 1 Tbsp parmesan cheese on top of it

Great recipe. Although I did alter it slightly. I took the advice of others and soak in the buttermilk. I also added cayenne pepper instead of the oregano. I used a deep fryer, which made it so easy. I believe it was a lot better than anything I have had in the  restaurants. Will definitely be making again!

Not a fan. . . The buttermilk cooks and burns too quickly in the oil and I am scared the squid didn't cook all the way through. On top of that, I like a larger compilation of ingredients to season my oil fried recipes (cayenne, worcestershire, lemon juice, tobasco, preferred seasoning salts, etc) and I don't usually care for certain recipes that don't use such things and in turn come out underseasoned. . .
I don't even think the aioli or dressing could have made up for it. . .

It was better than most restaurant calamari I've had!  I soaked the squid in buttermilk for 2 hours and used whole wheat flour instead of white....It turned out great!  We'll definitely make this again!

We all really enjoyed this recipe. It is moderately expensive because of the squid, but very easy to make. Who would've figured, buttermilk and calamari being good together. Subbed. olive oil for veggie, but that's only because we had it on hand. Otherwise this was followed exactly and it turned out perfect. Thanks for sharing!

I was surprised that this recipe came out so well.  Only 4 stars cuz the batter didn't stick so well to the calamari.  I did add in some extra spice seasonings to the flour and some panko too.  Great starter recipe and I can't wait to make again!!  Yummo!

Amazing recipe!  We took advice from another rating and soaked the calamari for two hours in the buttermilk.  I added paprika and salt and pepper to the oregano in the flour, and garnished with parsley when it was done frying.  Better than any restaurant calamari we've ever had.  We will be making this again and again!

We loved this recipe. I don't know if buttermilk is the reason, but the dough is very light and fluffy. I served with garlic-yogurt-dill sauce.

Not sure why everyone raved about this.  Needed to add lots more seasoning to the calamari after we cooked them.  Recipe had no flavor.

Doubled the S&P and oregano and added some paprika and some panko crumbs to the flour.  Still a tad bland but perked up after the lemon was squeezed. I let the rings rest for 10 after dredging then dredged again right before frying, didn't have any issue with coating staying put. For me the downside was they were crisp right out of the oil but didn't stay that way for long. Too much residual moisture from the buttermilk?  Maybe I should have drained longer?

"Talk Like A Pirate" party guests inhaled two and half pounds of this, and commented on it being exceptionally tender (thanks to the buttermilk?).

I soaked the squid for 2 hours, and added 2 Tsp Old Bay seasoning, and 2 Tsp Smoked Paprika to the 2 cups of Flour. Made it wonderfully spicy and smoky tasting. Squeeze fresh lemon wedges over it before you enjoy this great recipe!

These were okay... I used frozen calamari rings, defrosted then soaked them in buttermilk (milk/vinegar mixture) for 2 hours...they were very tender this way!!  But they tasted too "floury" & bland?   Needed more seasoning....

This is really great but I think I did something wrong. When I fried the squid, all the flour stayed on the pot! The squid was delicious put without any crunchiness... What did I do wrong?? Also, I replaced the buttermilk since we don't have it here by coconut milk! It was really good!

What is it that makes this so incredible? The buttermilk? The ratio of salt/pepper/flour/oregano? I've used the buttermilk and this flouring ratio on Squid, Tilapia, and Catfish - great each time.

Loved it!!  Soaked the calamari for 24 hours in the buttermilk and were they tender.  Will definitely make again.  Be careful not to over fry, they cook very quickly.

I found this to be very good, the only thing that I did was drege the squid pieces through the flour first, then buttermilk then the flour again.  I found the batter stayed on nicely.

A quick, easy, and yummy appetizer--a sure-fire crowd-pleaser! Even if the batter doesn't adhere as expected, it's a minor distraction from this tasty starter.

I didn't like the oregano in the calamari, and usually I love oregano. The calamari also didn't fry up like I would have liked. After 2-3 minutes, the calamari was definitely done, but the breading was not golden. Like other reviewers have said, soaking the calamari in buttermilk for several hours was a good idea.  Everything came out very tender.

Ok but not really exceptional. I'll probably make it again but I wouldn't serve it for anything but a weeknight dinner.

This was the best I've ever made. The buttermilk makesw the calamari tender and the flour adheres better. One note, be sure you allow the oil to come back to 375 before frying another batch. My guests were eating faster than I could make it and some were cooked at a lower temp hence some were not as crisp as they should have been.

Very tasty! This was my first attempt at making calamari at home, and I was pleased with the results. I soaked the calamari in the buttermilk for a few hours. I found that the flour stuck to the pieces quite nicely, even after being cooked. I think having the oil (I used canola) quite hot before you drop them in helps. Also, I would highly recommend cooking your calamari only a couple of minutes on each side (more or less depending on the size of your rings.) Even if the pieces aren't browned, I would remove them, otherwise you risk overcooking the calamari, and overcooked calamari is on the rubbery side.

This was better than restaurant calamari.  First time I made calamari too!  My husband thought it was outstanding, and he is very critical when it comes to food.  I bought very fresh calamari from whole foods, and it was not too chewy at all or rubbery.  It was very tender and just excellent really.  Thanks for this recipe!

Substituted buttermilk with 1 cup milk + 1 tbsp lemon juice. Leave to curdle for at least 5 min, stir before using. No oregano, so replaced with basil and sage instead. Squid turned out really yummy (did not become soggy when cooled) - next time will use oregano as well.

Very good recipe. I am curious as to why the buttermilk was used. I didn't notice any extra flavor because of it, but I marinated the squid for 30 min. before frying. I also added diced sweet onion to the finished product, and served it with tzatziki dip. Will add more seasoning next time, but highly successful and easy to make.

Very restaurant-like, although it is hard to keep the batter on during the frying process. A deep fryer (roto-fryer or fry daddy) might help with that.

This was great!  The regional market had fresh calamari for $3 a pound this past weekend so I was looking for something to make with it for our anniversary.  I followed the recipe exact except added some cayenne pepper to it.  Came out perfect even for the novice!  And considering we were going to go to a restaurant where calamari is $8 for an appetizer I saved a lot!

it's been a few years since ive had calamari, and that was at a restaurant. since that last time i got diagnosed with a condition that left me to follow a very strict diet. after finding this recipe, i had to tweak it a bit, and im sorry for those of u who don't believe in rating recipes if it's been messed with...but using this as a jump off point i was able to enjoy restaurant quality calamari again! i left the squid rings in the buttermilk overnight to marinate; i didn't have all the ingredients i needed and ended up coating the squid rings in arrowroot starch, no spices except a pinch of cayenne. they still turned out great! a few pieces were tough, but i think that could've been because the squid i had were the huge ones...that and i can only use olive oil due to the dietary cocerns. i thought this would affect the flavour -i really don't prefer the taste of oo- but it didn't! if i could i'd try this to a 't', but for those of u who can, definitely try this one out!

This was really good!  I took the advice of other reviewers and soaked the calamari in buttermilk for an hour ahead of time.  I also doubled the salt in the recipe and salted lightly after frying.  This worked really well in a deep fryer.  It took about 1-2 minutes to fry up a batch. Served with marinara sauce but would also be good with a garlic mayo.  Will definitely make again!

Perfect recipe if you change a few things like I did: I used a quartered chicken instead of squid pieces, BBQ sauce instead of batter coating, and I cooked it on a rotisserie instead of deep frying. Oh, and don't forget to skip the buttermilk!

I would lower the temperature of the oil to 360° and cook between 45 seconds to a minute and a half depending on the size of your cut.

Used two kinds of frozen calamari - I recommend the smaller rings  over the larger ones.

This was a good eat.  Most issues were probably all my fault.  In any case i found that the calimari tended to stick together, a lot.  This made picking them up to put in the fryer a real problem for me.  It got real messy really quickly.  Once through all that the final product was very good.  Next time i will be better prepared.

Super easy to make.  Make sure your local seafood place has fresh calamari or add time to thaw.  

Note on Oil Temp, we use gas stove and i couldn't get the oil to the recommended temp, got as high as 350 initially then was basically at 300 once calamari was added, so I had to keep them in longer, still came out crispy and not oily.

Thank you for sharing the recipe.  I made it for the first time on Christmas Eve and it was delicious.  Next time I will take the advice from the other viewers to soak the calamari for two hours.  This recipe came close to my husband and I's favorite Italian restaurant that serves fried calamari.  In fact, my husband said this recipe was better than the restaurant.

Do a couple of small test batches to make sure your temperature and time are good, nothing is worse than overcooked calamari.  Setting my deep-fryer to 350 and frying for about 1 minute worked for me. Also, let the calamari dry a bit after they come out of the flour in order to let the batter set. This recipe was quite good, but it's a messy, time-consuming affair. It can be hard to get those little rings evenly battered. It turned out far better than the frozen stuff (which is what a lot of bad restaurants serve too) but falls short of some of the high-quality restaurant fare I've enjoyed. I'm keeping the recipe, but it's going in my "special occasions only" file. Maybe for the annual seven fishes dinner at home.
