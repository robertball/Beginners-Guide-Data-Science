This smelled so good while baking! You know it's good when your picky 13 yr old boy tells you it's the best chicken he's ever had!! I used 6 bone-in/skin-on thighs. I rendered the fat off the skin in a skillet before baking, as I didn't want all the fat in the pan.(add the thighs skin side down in a cold skillet, turned to medium heat and cooked for 5 minutes until the skin was brown and the pan is filled with fat) I only used one Tablespoon of Greek seasoning for all the other herbs called for as I thought 6 Tablespoons would be way too much! 1 tsp. of pepper, a tsp. of garlic powder and the zest of a lemon. This cooked up in 40 minutes total. My store had no fresh green beans so I left them out this time, and served it with Greek salad, pita bread and tzatziki sauce! Yum! :)

Absolutely Delicious! Will definitely be making this more often! I used 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts, and doubled the potato/spice mixture. Although I don't know if I needed to quite double all of the seasonings, it was perfectly fine doubled & my family really enjoyed it! My mom wasn't planning on eating dinner until she smelled it cooking: and then she went for seconds! She liked it so much that she asked if she could review this recipe, too! (That's saying a lot for my mom-she doesn't bother with recipes, reviewing, baking, or trying many new food items!) Thanks for a great recipe!

Made this many times, being Greek! To kick it up a notch add a lot of chopped Garlic all over it. When done remove chicken and kick up to 450 and let the potatoes get nice and crispy, be sure to watch and not let burn!

I really wanted to try this recipe and I had the majority of the ingredients on hand minus the beans so I used carrots (my kids love carrots) and some greek seasoning from missingingredient.ca. Due to the heat outside I decided to wrap everything up into a large foil pouch on the BBQ. When I opened the pouch it smelled DIVINE and tasted even better!  I served it with a salad and balsamic dressing... definitely making this one again!!

I made this for the first time and followed recipe pretty much exactly the way it's written only I doubled it because there are 6 of us.  I did  use bone in/skin on chicken thighs instead of legs.  I halved the baby potatoes so they would cook faster and brown nicely.  Before I added the beans I broiled the chicken and potatoes for about 4 mins to get a nice brown.  Everything came out so very tasty.  I will make this again for sure!

I usually don't take the time to review things but this was such an amazing hit in my house that I had too. 2 teenagers and 1 hubby voted this the best chicken I have ever made. I made it as stated except found "Greek Seasoning" instead of Lemon Herb and used chicken breasts (family preference). Everything else was followed to the T... It was succulent, tasty, the smell was out of this world. The green beans were perfect in 15 mins and the chicken was moist. I will make this again and again. I also think it could be amazing served cold the next day on a greek or green salad, except it was demolished and I need to plan ahead to have leftovers!

I was skeptical of the large amount of seasoning in this recipe (I am notorious for under-seasoning), but I followed to a T & WOWZER, soooo good! My 10 yr. old said he'd like to invite his friends over this chicken!  YAY!  This dish is easy enough for a mid-week dinner, but I can totally see serving this for special occasions, too.  My only substitutes were that I did not have enough taters, so I did 1/2 taters, 1/2 baby carrots.  Also, had to skip green beans -- didn't have, but will def. try next time!  Thank you Chef V!

Not really a review, but more of an observation— the recipe says to take the temp near the bone, but that is not good practice. It needs to read 165 in the thickest part of the meat AWAY from the bone.

Well, wasn't this easy and delicious! I used Greek seasoning instead of the lemon and herb; two bone-in skin-on chicken breast halves that I wanted to use up; frozen green beans instead of fresh and tossed them in the oil and seasoning mixture while they thawed; and everything else as written. I just love the smell of fresh lemon juice, and it really made this dish. Such a tasty meal, and so easy to prepare. Thank you Chef V!

The chicken was great - I used chicken breasts (2) and all of the seasoning - I will cut back of the seasoning next time - or use the dry seasoning for sprinkling on vegies or salad. The chicken is very tasty when used with just a plain salad. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this in my slow cooker. There is no such thing as lemon herb seasoning where I live, so I used lemon pepper and excluded the pepper from the recipe. I didn't use any green beans. I cooked the potatoes and chicken on high for about 3 1/2 hours. I served it with "easy tzatziki sauce" from this site and  I thought it turned out fantastic!

*update* I have made this several times now, each time in my slow cooker. I have discovered that with the chicken on top of the potatoes you can drastically reduce the amount of oil because the chicken juices will give plenty of moisture to help them cook. The potatoes aren't crispy with this method, but are still delicious.

Yummmmmmmmmmm!  We used chicken thighs (9) and redskin potatos (chopped) with the skin on.  Left out the 1T (yikes!) salt and instead just sprinkled each thigh with seasoned salt and cracked black pepper.  Used fresh herbs instead of dried and for the lemon herb seasoning, we used the zest from the two lemons that were juiced along with a little rosemary, garlic, and thyme.  This was super easy to make, smelled great while cooking, and tasted wonderful.

I tried a version of this for supper tonight. I dont usually like to change things on recipes before I try them the for the first time..(how will you know if you like it or not) but I did use a Greek Seasoning that I recieved from "Missing Ingredient" instead of the mixture of spices listed. 
I served it with a lemon/mint yogurt sauce.
Overall, very easy recipe. It is one I will make versions of again in the future.

A meal we thoroughly enjoyed.  I reduced the ingredients to two chicken pieces and used a little less olive oil.  The bake time was perfect in my oven.  I did make tzatziki sauce as suggested by Chef V, using 'Easy Tzatziki Sauce' from AR.  The house smelled delicious while this was baking and the taste was delicious.  Thanks Chef V, for sharing your recipe.

I used chicken breasts, added about a tsp. of minced garlic, substituted grape seed oil for the olive oil, sprinkled  tumeric over the chicken, added Bragg's Sea Kelp seasoning to the lemon/oil mixture and sprinkled garlic powder over chicken and potatoes.
Since I used the chicken breasts, I lowered the heat to 375 after adding the drained, can of marinated (in the remaining mixture-added more lemon juice) green beans and cooked for approximately 15 minutes after the add.
My husnad said he felt like he'd eaten at a good restaurant!

Great chicken recipe! I did not have any green beans, so I served it with broccoli on the side. The potatoes and chicken cooked in about 35 minutes. I cut the potatoes in chunks so they would cook quicker. After I stirred the potatoes in the oil and spices I put the chicken in the bowl and covered the pieces in the mixture. I poured the rest on top of the chicken. It turned out moist and the skin was nice and crispy.

Easy and delicious. I used russet potatoes and chicken breast because that's what I had on hand. It looked bland when I pulled it out of the oven, but the taste was awesome. Sooo easy I will Definately make this again. Small red potatoes would have been much better.  Oh, and also threw in some whole garlic cloves yum.

Oh this is gooood! I took the Editor's recommendation and substituted the Greek seasoning, but will definitely try the lemon herb next time. We could hardly wait because it smelled so incredible! The lemon juice really made this recipe, I thought. And the crispy skin, the beans and potatoes made for a perfect one-pan meal. Yum! (I had a couple beets that needed to be eaten so I cut them up and added them to the potato mixture and they cooked in good time with the rest). Thanks for this great recipe, Chef V!!

This was pretty good but I did have to sub chicken breast tenders because that is what I had. I cut the pepper to 1 teaspoon because 1 tablespoon seemed like too much for our taste. I used nonstick foil so the ingredients wouldn't stick and the clean up was simple. Very tasty, even with the changes. Very nice with homemade tzaziki sauce and some greek salad. Thanks for sharing.

Made this last night at our Elks Lodge.  Made enough for 60 people and we had 56 attend.  Very easy to make.  Didn't realy change a thing except I added a thin sliver of lemon on top of each chicken quarter going out.  I received many compliments on the meal and requests for the recipe.  A keeper!

This was good.  I used ½ bone in breasts and they were really large, so I had to cook at 425 for an hour and the seasoning all kind of charred, as did the small potatoes, and the fresh asparagus.   Next time I would be tempted to sear dredged chicken first and fry for maybe 1O minutes, then transfer to oven and bake at 325 with potatoes for 30 mins and add green veg last for 10-12 minutes.   I would also try just using thyme and rosemary herbs.

Really GREAT recipe that is a hit every time I make it!!!!  No fail, very flavorful and super duper easy.  You can leave out the green beans or substitute with broccoli or asparagus, just adjust roasting time for the vegetable.  You can of course use different potatoes as well or even use parsnips or carrots or mix of all.

Delicious & fragrant! I worried that everything would be over seasoned, but that wasn't the case. Used (thin-sliced) chicken breasts instead of thighs/legs and reduced cooking time by 10 minutes.

My family loved the potatoes but the chicken was just ok. I wouldn't make this again. It wasn't terrible. We are it but we just went crazy about it.

Made as written in the recipe.  Very good.  Served alongside a greek salad, home made tzatziki sauce, and a really good naan-like bread.  Perfect!

Fully deserving of 5 stars! I will make this again! Everyone loved it. I used lemon pepper season instead of lemon herb (not easy to find). I aslo didn't have basil, so I just used the oregano. Thickened the pan juices with a little flour, white pepper and salt and poured over the chicken to serve. Delicious! Going to try this on the grill next! Thanks!

This was fabulous! Pretty much stuck to the recipe but used broccoli instead of green beans and Yukon gold potatoes. Loved that it was in one pan! Will definitely be making this one again.

I have been making this for years going back to my mother--you can also make it in a slow cooker or Instant Pot.  3/4 cup is way too much oil.  You can do this with 1/4 cup.  Don't need small potatoes, can cut any potato into large chunks.  Skip the basil and up the oregano.  Sometimes I add one onion, sliced with the rings cut in half.

This is awesome!  A very simple dinner that doesnt taste simple - this is truly easy enough for a weeknight if you have time, but also good enough for casual company.  I didn't have any problem with the chicken or potatoes browning  - they were a beautiful color!  Very good dish and an extra star for the clean up - one pan ;-)

It may have turned out better with garlic. As it was, serving tzatziki on the side was the only thing that saved it. The potatoes were not quite done but the chicken was getting overdone. I will use a different recipe to make a similar dish next time

Gotta love the one pan recipes. Easy to prepare and tons of flavour. This was a hit all around the table. We used broccoli instead of green beans. Other than that, followed recipe exactly. This one's a keeper. Thanks for sharing Chef V!

I used car iron skillets instead of a big sheet pan. I took the advice from a reviewer to render the fat on the chicken. It made such a mess in the kitchen, I won't do that again.. We left most of the liquid in the skillets anyway. It was moist and very tasty. I will definitely make this again.

Lax Mama - no offense, i've read some reviews you've left on others recipes, tried a few of your suggestions on those recipes and tried some of your originals. Your input and  taste is... lacking. I advise others not to listen to your input and not waste their time or money on your variations. Try not to leave negative reviews on others work if you are going to alter their recipes and come up with some original stuff of your own. Good luck out there and hone your skills before recommening changes and posting you own new recipes.

I loved the flavor of the lemons and herb seasoning.  The green beans and potatoes was the perfect touch.  I'm glad the suggestion was put in there to broil the chicken to get the extra crispy in there.  This dish was worth making, will make it again!  Thanks for sharing this.

Great flavors! I make this chicken all the time. It’s so good with the roasted potatoes soaking up all the juices from the chicken. My only change is that I don’t think you need to add oil to the chicken when you are using thighs and legs, especially if you’re leaving the skin on. I usually just lay my chicken pieces on a 1/2 sheet (12x18) pan w/1” sides I have pre-sprayed with olive oil cooking spray about an hour before popping in the oven, seasoning both sides with salt, pepper, garlic powder, finely chopped rosemary and dried oregano.  I sub rosemary because I don’t care for dry basil and only use fresh and I know it would burn.  Then tuck slices of fresh lemon all around the chicken pieces, toss the potatoes in olive oil & the same seasonings except lemon and pile them around the chicken. I like using Russet potatoes with the skin on cut in big wedges so they cook in the same time as the chicken. Then just roast all together in a 400 degree oven for a good 45 min and you have a delicious roasted chicken & potatoe dish with classic Greek flavors. Serve with your fav roasted veggies and wedges of fresh lemon to squeeze on the chicken for even more zesty fresh lemon flavor.

Really delicious!  I've made this 3 or 4 times now, and learned not to overcrowd the pan.  Liquid doesn't escape and it becomes a very different dish. I use a combination of boneless breasts and thighs, to please the different members of my family. The breasts can be a bit dry, so I think I would add the green beans sooner and shave a few minutes off the total time. Still loved it even so, and I bet the leg quarters in the original recipe don't have that problem.

This is probably one of the best dishes I have made in a long time. I substituted baby carrots in lieu of green beans. I use lemon pepper seasoning in lieu of the lemon herb. My family kept on commenting on how good the house smelled as thing was cooking. This is going to go on our list as as a go to meal. We love this recipe!

Really good except for it being way too salty.  Next time, cut back on the salt by at least half.  Otherwise, easy to put together, easy to clean up and quite tasty.

I have to admit...it is a bit oily...but the flavor was out of this world. My 13 year old son eats about everything that I make. It’s the Mrs. that is always picky. Even she ate it all up. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and I absolutely love this heart-healthy, one pan meal!  I'm making it tonight with chicken thighs, but the first time we decided to try it I used chicken breast tenderloins which became dry.  I'm sure it will be even better with the darker, juicier chicken pieces!  Thank you for the recipe-it's a hit!

This turned out great!  We served this along with Greek salad Tzatziki sauce and Key Lime pie for dessert to some friends of ours and there was almost nothing leftover.  Our friends really loved the chicken.  I think the vegetables where a bit undercooked but that was my fault, five more minutes in the oven would have taken care of it.  I used chicken thighs, skin on, bone in.  This meal was on easy on the budget and big on flavor.  It also made me look like a pro in the Greek food arena!  We will definitely have this again.  My husband and three children LOVED it, and our friends want the recipe.  Overall a really good meal :)

It takes a lot longer to cook, but it's delicious. I cover it with foil for an hour or so before letting it cook uncovered. Chicken dries out if you don't. I've made several times, adding more or less of the spices depending on what I had on hand and it turns out great every time.

This has become a go to meal for me. Great for company or an easy weeknight meal. When I have company over for dinner, I hate to be in the kitchen all night, with this recipe you can do the prep work before everyone arrives and just pop it in the oven. So easy and so delicious. I usually use chicken thighs with skin and bone on. Sometimes I add a little mustard to the olive oil, lemon mixture but you can't go wrong with the recipe as written.

Man!  How does it turn into the most tantalizing, fragrant dish ever made?!! By its pure simplicity!  I simplified the recipe even more by just seasoning with Greek seasoning, Oregon, basil and lemon pepper, and drizzling with olive oil and lemon juice in a well oiled baking sheet.  I did it in stages as the recipe indicated.  The chicken, veggies & potatoes were delectable with Greek & lemon flavors and the chicken was browned beautiful by just raising the rack to the top the last 15 minutes and flipping midway.  Definitely a keeper!

I’m a believer!!! My mother, husband & I are normally chicken haters, ESPECIALLY bone-in chicken (we skeeve - is that a term outside of South Philly?) but I was struggling with something to make that wasn’t red meat (blood pressure issues) so I decided to try this. At first I thought I should use breasts since we have that whole dark meat/ bone-in aversion but for some unknown reason, I decided to make this as written with only the necessary change due to BP issues regarding the salt (used lemon pepper Mrs. Dash in place of the salt, pepper & lemon/ Greek seasoning) but kept everything else pretty much the same except that I ran out of oregano while making so only used what was left. WE LOVED IT!!!!! All three of us could not get over how much we were enjoying this CHICKEN -on the bone, no less!!!! Thank you so much!!!!!

A very simple weeknight dinner! I used boneless, skinless thighs and doubled the sauce because I like extra sauce, and everything came out great. Chicken, potatoes, and green beans were all cooked perfectly. The sauce was tasty but light. Nice go-to dinner!

Love this recipe -- have made it a few times now. I add about five whole cloves of garlic. Can also be made with asparagus rather than green beans.

Absolutely delicious and so easy to make!  I have made this several times.  Definitely use all of the herbs per recipe...it sounds like a lot but it is what makes the flavors in this dish.

Extremely easy to prepare. I made it using a variety of chicken pieces: bone in split breast, leg/thigh sections & whole wings. I used a jelly roll pan lined with foil & sprayed with cooking spray for an easy clean up. I followed directions exactly as stated although I did add 2 minced cloves of garlic to the oil mixture. I thought the end result was good but I did find the chicken to be a little overcooked. Next time, I will add the green beans 10 minutes earlier & reduce the overall cooking time by 10 minutes.

I was so pleasantly surprised by how delicious this was. i didn't have high hopes, buy tried the recipe because it used simple ingredients I always have on hand. I used bone-in breasts and wings because my husband prefers white meat. The chicken was tender, juicy, and full of flavor, and the veggies were so savory and with just the right amount of acid from the lemon. This is s great one-pot meal that is quick to assemble and easy to follow. Be careful...you may just want to drink the pan juices...Yummy!

I made this recipe EXACTLY as the directions and it was FABULOUS! I couldn't find Greek spice or Lemon with Herbs in any of our local grocery store. So googled how to make the Lemon with herbs and made my own. The sauce with this dish made it to die for! It is on Allrecipes also (I used Chef John's recipe). It was perfect! (I did spray the chicken and potatoes with a little "Pam" when I took them out to giggle the potatoes after 30 minutes. I will cook this again............maybe every week. So easy and SO good!

This was such a flavorful recipe and my whole family loved it.  I used 8 chicken thighs - bone in skin on.  It turned out fantastic.  This is one of my new favorites to make for family and for company.  We actually fought over the left overs.  I served it with Tzatziki sauce and naan bread.  So good!!!

This is my family’s favorite Sunday dinner. The only change I make is to double the spices and use 1 whole chicken cut up + a pack of chicken legs. The leftovers are amazing heated up the next day in the air fryer.

Delectable!  Only change I made was a sprinkle of salt instead of a tablespoon.  Fabulous.  I followed some reviews which suggested finishing it off with a few minutes under the broiler.  Perfect as is!

Very good, but I recommend decreasing the salt to 1 tsp.  I did have to substitute frozen green beans for fresh, but frozen worked fine. Otherwise, I followed the directions as written.  All my kids liked it, and the family agreed the recipe is worth a repeat.

I've made many recipes from this site and never took the time to write a review, but this dish was such a hit in my house I had to. Even my three year old loved it and I thought it may be over seasoned for her, but she ate it up. I followed the cooking times exactly and the chicken stayed moist, the potatoes were just cooked enough and not mushy and the green beans were cooked through, but with a nice crunch. My boyfriend told me to make sure I save the recipe so this can become a regular in our home.

Fantastic and yes I will make it again many times!  Served it with my own Greek yoghurt, garlic and cucumber sauce--an absolute must with this dish.  Took it from "great" to "Fabulous!"  Everyone, even my picky mum loved it.

As usual I was looking for a recipe that would work with what was on hand so I had no choice but to make changes. I used skinless /boneless chicken thighs, frozen green beans , russet potatoes and used a squeezie bottle of lemon juice. I did everything else as written and although next time I will cut back on the salt and try to plan on using fresh green beans , I thought this was excellent. Than you so much for such an easy recipe.

This recipe is amazing. I used boneless skinless chicken breast and asparagus instead of green beans. Seasonings were perfect with a little minced garlic added and served with a little cucumber dill sauce. Just fantastic!

So easy and tasty.  Allowed me to put the meal together quickly and be able to sit to visit with friends instead of fussing over food preparations.  No leftovers from this meal to try with a green salad...Everyone at the table  took a second helping and wanted the recipe.  This one-pan-meal was a definite hit!    My own preference would be to decrease the oregano and basil and add some garlic.

I didn't want to rate this because i screwed it up, but to put notes on, I had to highlight some stars. Next time, instead of 2 T of pepper and 1 T of lemon pepper  seasoning, just try 2 T lemon pepper and NO pepper.

I used trimmed, boneless chicken thighs, swished them in the oil mixture along with the potatoes, then I poured the mixture over the top, reserving just enough to season a can of green beans (as I had no fresh ones).  45 min cooking time was plenty.

This is very easy to put together which is a big bonus for the busy cook, however it is smothered in way  too much oregano and basil really overpowering the whole dish.  Like the idea of the simplicity of it, but will not make this again!

I have made this a number of times.  I've substituted the lemon herb mixture with lemon pepper, and then cut down on the pepper that the recipe calls for.  I also like to marinate my chicken and potatoes (in separate bags of course) for a while prior to baking.  It is a huge hit, every time!

Total hit with my family!! Even tho I was forced to change the olive oil to 1/4 cup plus 3/4 cup Italian salad dressing..(wanted to double the sauce & just didn't have the oil!)& used chicken tenders + more peeled, chopped white potatoes...it came out FABULOUS!!It's been requested to make again & often! So I will...!! Enjoyed this ALLOT!!
(Due to the tenders piled on each other, & the large amount of vegies, I baked this 400 for 5min. more on each time.But it worked perfectly!)
PS....don't forget to serve w/ tzatziki sauce or oniondip style sour cream!! Adds the final touch!!

It seems like there's little room for error but my chicken was so dry and ugly, the potatoes were way too done on the outside before getting tender, and the green beans were tough and rather tasteless.  I won't be making again.

This was really good. My picky husband and my 8yo really liked it. I used Greek seasoning instead of the lemon herb and only used 1/4 cup olive oil for 6 drumsticks and 2 boneless chicken breasts. The chicken was done after 45 minutes so I had to cook the green beans in the microwave. After the 45 minutes, I took the breasts out and broiled the drumsticks and potatoes for a couple of minutes to crisp up the skin.

Fantastic for a family dinner.  I used bone-in , skin on chicken thighs so the cooking time was a little less and everything turned out fine.   Using thights I had two sheet pans and arranged accordingly.  Easy, great flavor and easy clean-up.  What's not to like?!

This was so good! Chicken stayed so moist. I didn’t add all the salt the recipe asked for, and it didn’t taste like it was missing, but kept everything else the same. I lined my baking sheet with parchment paper for easier cleanup. Will make again.

Made just as written, although without the tzatziki sauce. That would be luscious, but not available. Cooked up beautifully & tasted great. I did use Greek seasoning as I had a jar & it contained what I needed. Good meal!

This was delicious! I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and they  were a little dry so I'll use skin-on chicken the next time. I subbed lemon pepper for the lemon herb seasoning and omitted the black pepper - perfect!

I used 6 bone-in, skin-on thighs - about 3 pounds. The green beans didn't come in my food order, so I intended to halve the oil/lemon mixture, but the spice amounts seemed crazy high, so I dropped most of them to a teaspoon (pepper to 1/4 t), and that was PLENTY. I cooked at 425 as instructed. I poked at the potatoes 30 minutes in, and everything was done after another 15 minutes, so 45 minutes total.

We liked this recipe.  The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is that if I had used the whole 1/2 C. of lemon juice, I felt it would have overpowered the other flavors.  I used just 1/4 C and, for us, it was just right for our taste buds! Thanks Chef John for an easy, tasty recipe.

It was very tasty, I used only 1 tbsp of the dried herbs and that was plenty. Next time I will reduce the olive oil to 1/3 cup and add garlic. I might also remove the skin from the chicken to make it less greasy. The potatoes I cut in half and they got nice and crispy. I also added in asparagus and broccoli with the beans. Even without tzatziki it was very good.

This was SOOOO GOOD. I brined the chicken before cooking (which I usually do with non-organic chicken) so the chicken ended up saltier than I’d like, so next time I will either not brine or use less salt. The green beans were very tasty. The potatoes were probably the best I’ve ever made, so I recycled this recipe and tweaked it a bit for when I want just the potatoes as a side. They always turn out soft and fluffy and lemony and so good.

This was delicious!!  My husband and son loved it.  The only thing I did differently was reduce the cooking time as I was using boneless chicken breast.  I did cut some of the larger small potatoes in half.  Also in Canada our packaging doesn't come in ounces!  So I had to guess at the amounts.
I will definitely make it again!!

This came out beautifully. This was my first time making chicken legs and it was so easy! The skin came out slightly crispy and the veggies were cooked through. My only thing is... what’s lemon herb seasoning??? I used lemon pepper seasoning but I didn’t quite taste the amount of lemon I was hoping for. I’d totally make this again though.

I substituted Asparagus because green beans weren't available now that it's almost October.   Cook the Chicken and Potatoes a few more minutes before adding the Asparagus - due to the shorter roasting time..   When done, remove chicken and asparagus from pan, but brown the potatoes an extra couple minutes under the broiler..   Plate the Potatoes and then add Chicken Broth to the crispiest in the pan over medium heat till you see boiling around the liquids edge...  Ladle over all.  Enjoy!

I will make a few changes to this recipe.  First up: this was waay too salty, and I knew that reading the recipe. But I never deviate on my first try. That being said next time I will cut down on the salt, also the oregano and omit the basil.  I used chicken thighs with the skin and bone, also boneless breast with the skin. My meal was completely done in 35 minutes @ 425 degrees.  And I will add more lemon.

The one change I made was I marinated the chicken for about 6 hours and marinated the potatoes separately for the same amount of time. I then baked it in the marinade and it was delicious

Way too many spices for my taste - especially pepper. Without rice and tzatziki I wouldn't have been able to eat it. As is I'll wash off the spices with water before putting the leftovers away.

I loved this recipe! The flavors were amazing; the textures and tenderness were great too. I only had boneless skinless chicken thighs but using the time exactly they were not dry at all. I only used half the spices and it was fine. I like how you can tailor this recipe to what you have on hand. I added quartered onion and chopped garlic and sliced zucchini instead of green beans.

Both my husband and I loved it. I made some extra for the next nights dinner, I cut up the chicken, potatoes and carrots. Made a hash out of it, only had to spray the pan, with the oil in the fish in yes and I added red, orange and yellow peppers to the first dinner, they were roasted and sweet. Added them to the hash. It was great

This was delicious. I used chicken thighs instead of the leg quarters but other than that made it as written. Either my pan was too small or I had too many thighs (6) but I did not have room for green beans. The potatoes though were fantastic as was the sauce. I will definitely make this again.

This was really good. I did cut back the salt to 1 teaspoon instead of a tablespoon and halved everything else and it was still plenty flavorful. It is very similar to other recipes I have tried and will make it again. Love the idea of green beans with the potatoes.

I made this without the green beans,since I had none. I use Key Lime juice since I grow my own & freeze the juice! Delicious meal which my hubby declared yummy and asked for me to make again with the beans.

I made it with bone in breasts instead of leg quarters.  Next time I’m going to just coat the green beans in oil, salt and pepper so that it’s not so much of the same flavor. It was a little too much of the same flavor.  I also brined the breasts for about an hour in salt water and added 4 minced garlic cloves to the mixture. An hour was sufficient cooking time for the bone in breasts; they were tender, juicy and flavorful. Great recipe with these small adjustments.

Oh my- this was really delicious!  Like a few reviews I didn’t  have “ lemon herb seasoning”. So I added garlic powder, onion powder and a half tsp of turmeric.  I also used boneless skinless thighs and just watched the timing. Will absolutely make this again.

I have made this multiple times and love it every time.  My husband doesn't like green beans, so I have substituted carrots and occasionally have added asparagus (near the end of the cooking time to avoid it being mushy).  Not only are all the vegetables tasty from the seasonings, but it is also a  beautiful presentation.

This is one of my favorite recipes on the entire site. The flavors are amazing; it seems like you're using way too many spices, but it really turns out perfectly. I did use lemon pepper instead of lemon herb seasoning, as I couldn't find any of the latter, so the dish did come out ever-so-slightly too peppery. I also used six drumsticks rather than the four leg quarters.

 I did combine this with homemade tzatziki, which made it even better.

My first review. I almost made it exactly like recipe but used carrots and cauliflower....only vegetables I had. It was incredible. I can see rendering the fat from the chicken and playing with amount of oil but as written the thighs were crispy and tender. I used skin on, bone in thighs. So good I was compelled to review!

This was good without the lemon and tzatziki sauce.  I used a drained can of green beans during last 5-10 minutes of baking.  I will make this again.

Very Delicious! 
I used drumsticks not legs,
and it was finished within 30 minutes tops. 
i didn't do the green beans either. (food budget was cuting close, and i don't like veggies anyways, so i figured it be fine if i left that bit out) 
I do recommend making this!

Pretty basic, but the quick and easy was good. A little too much of the same flavor and perhaps asparagus would be better than green beans. The tstzaki (sp) sauce is a definite must to round it out.  I also would choose to make less next time as a lot got wasted.

Chicken was a little dry, but it tasted fantastic! I created my own sauce to top the chicken highlighting lemon and red wine vinegar tastes with a parmesan finish.

This was terrific! I used chicken legs and quartered whole potatoes. I made the dish in a cast iron frying pan in the oven and the chicken and potatoes browned up nicely without  using the broiler. I had no green beans so used halved cherry tomatoes that i put in for the last five or ten minutes. They gave a nice sweet tang to the dish. There are no lemons here so i used a lime. There's also no lemon-herb seasoning so i found a recipe online and made it. It's basically just several dried herbs, spices and and grated lemon rind (again, i used lime).  This recipe has a TON of seasoning but it's ALL good. Make a  simple green salad and enjoy a wonderful meal.

I love lemon and chicken together but this was way too oily for us. The flavors were good but I personally would cut back on the oil and put it in a pan with higher sides.

I served this to guests and everyone raved. The only thing I did differently was cut the drumstick/thigh apart before cooking. I also put it under the broiler for a couple minutes as suggested. Next time, I'd use more green beans because they were so good. There was enough flavor that Tzatsiki sauce wasn't needed. I well definitely make this again!

My whole family loves this, even my picky daughter.  I made only minor changes. I substituted about 1 1/2 - 2 teaspoons of dried lemon peel for the lemon herb seasoning .  I mix the seasonings, olive oil and fresh lemon juice in a bowl, then dunk the pieces in - Its faster than brushing on the seasoning and coats the bottom as well.  I do the same for the potatoes which I bake on a second sheet pan to avoid overcrowding.  I finish both the chicken and potatoes under the broiler to  get them nice and browned.

Great flavor, but needs some maneuvering so the potatoes are well-cooked. Use boneless breasts instead of quarters, which worked great when the cooking time is also lowered

It was/ is DELICIOUS! I would definitely recamend it!
The only changes I made was asparagus instead of green beans. Even if you dont have enough ingredients, it is still delicious. I made for my family and they loved it! I made it for my friends, and they loved it! All the people I made it for or mostly kids and adults, from 3 years old to I don't even know how old..... all I have to say is EAT IT!  Its great! P.S I also wanted to say you can use it with any kind of chicken. From chicken breast, thigh, leg, wing, quarter and any kind of chicken!

Awesome. I used chicken thighs (personal preference in taste) and no lemon herb seasoning, as I didn't have any. Using thighs cut the cooking time in half. The flavor was awesome, although I will probably cut the salt in half next time. Definitely a keeper.

Made this the first time following the recipe exactly and found it had too mich seasoning for us. Was still good. Tried it a second time with less Italian seasonings and was mich better and preferable for my family. Will continue to make as the veggies are really good and the chicken is moist.

I didn’t care for the potatoes. The chicken was cooked well and had a nice flavor from the herbs but the potatoes were way to lemon-y. I normally love anything lemon but this was too-too much. I also think it used too much oregano. I won’t be making this again.

We loved this recipe and I loved the ease of a one sheet pan dinner.  I couldn't find chicken leg quarters so I used bone-in skin-on thighs and the dish was delicious.  This is a repeater for me.

Loved this! The only thing I'd recommend is parboiling the green beans, adding garlic, and just tossing the chicken in the oil mixture. Otherwise, it was very tasty!

This has become a regular in our house every couple of weeks. I use 8 bone in skin on thighs and brown them in a skillet a bit to get rid of some of the fat.  I add minced garlic and use lemon pepper for the lemon herb seasoning.  It’s a winner.

We really enjoyed this! I was a little worried that the potatoes would be done before the chicken, but I followed the recipe to a "T" and they were perfect! I did scale this down to 2 servings for just my husband and myself, and used 2 dark quarters, and it was perfect. Will make again!

Loved this chicken! Very different from the food I usually make so its a nice addition to my recipe book. I was pretty concerned about the amount of seasoning used but I promise you it ended up yummy! I couldn't find the lemon and herb seasoning so I just did without it. I thought the chicken could have been a little more lemony but its probably just because I left out that seasoning. Ended up using 2/3 cup of lemon juice because I didn't have fresh lemons. Will probably replace green beans with Brussel sprouts next time.

I have made a lot of Greek chicken and potatoes in my 70 yeas and this was right up there at the top in flavor and ease in making. I didn't have Andy lemon seasoning , but it didn't matter. I will certainly make it again!

I made this with salmon instead of chicken, and goodness it was tasty! I adjusted the cooking time by baking the potatoes by themselves for 30 minutes and then added the salmon and green beans for 20 more minutes. Perfect! The lemon herb flavor of this dish is just sooooo good.

This was really good and I definitely plan on making again with a few changes. I don’t think 1/2 cup of olive oil is needed, will cut back to 1/3 cup. The herb and seasonings was very good and I think next time I will add the zest of one lemon. Using whole small red potatoes was perfect, I think if you were to use cut potatoes they would burn with the high temp and length of time needed for the chicken to cook.  The green beans were very good, we really liked the tender/crisp texture, I’d like to try with asparagus next time. Thank you for sharing!

Amazing, amazing, amazing!!!  I used Cavender’s Greek seasoning instead of the lemon seasoning called for in the recipe.  I used roughly 3/4 cup lemon concentrate instead of juicing two lemons.  I used 1 pound cubed chicken breast & sliced the potatoes in half.  I marinated the potatoes, chicken and green beans (used frozen Italian green beans w/ 1/4 cup marinade with extra squirts of lemon juice) in separate plastic bags for about two hours.  I then cooked the potatoes for 20 minutes  before adding the chicken and green beans and cooked for an additional 25 minutes.  It was so delicious and I love that it is  a one dish meal.  Two thumbs up ????

This was so incredibly delicious.  I made a few changes.  I doubled the number of thighs, and used half the basil, oregano, and lemon and herb seasoning.  Also, the thighs were done to the proper temperature in 30 minutes, so I through on the green beans, and cooked 15 minutes more for a total of 45 minutes instead of an hour.

Delicious! Used lemon pepper rather than lemon herb seasoning, but followed the recipe to a tee otherwise. We’ve had this maybe four times now, and it will remain in the rotation. Smells great cooking, and tastes even better.

I try and change up cuisines occassionally and stumbled back into Greek. I have made this several times now and forgot to set a review. This is really simple to put together and has amazing flavor. Of course now that I am all about the seasoning mix that goes into this dish its now impossible for me to find. Trying to find a recipe for a simular homemade spice blend because the husband and I both really enjoyed this one. Thank you for an excellent tasting and so very easy to assemble dish.

I really liked this dish! It was a great way for me to use some things up I had in the fridge. I used bonesless chicken breast (3), diced red potatoes, brussel sprouts instead of green beans, and used Greek seasoning instead of the lemon seasoning. I kept the other measurements the same (salt and pepper estimated) and the cooking time the same. My husband and I loved it. Will certainly make again.

Added a little more time (probably oven) but this was AWESOME!!  Added garlic (can't cook without it) … enough said.  Won't change a thing and this one goes on the favorite list.

I used 4 huge skinless chicken breasts and everyone enjoyed them. Next time I would omit the pepper, only because my lemon and herb spice already had enough pepper in it.

the sauce made that amazing tangy taste while eating the chicken, just make sure to get some sauce from the pan while eating and maybe marinate the chicken earlier before cooking.
all the timing and temperatures of recipe is correct made the chicken and potatoes well done. (I added mushroom)
recipe 10/10.
taste 10/10.

Followed directions, but did add minced garlic. It's good, but would be better if there was more flavor on the meat of the chicken. Will try a marinade first next time.

I used the seasonings for chicken I made in the instapot.  Shredded it and served over rice and veggies with crumbled feta on top.  Delicious!  Will use less pepper next time and add some klamata olives, fresh tomato and some fresh parsley.  Will also try this as is.

I'm not a fan of potato, but it's only through this recipe that I realized that potatoes - if cooked with the correct ingredients - can taste awesome! I didn't have dried basil so I tossed in the fresh leaves. But I made a mistake of adding it at the same time that I put in the potatoes. After baking, all those basil turned black, so I thought that was a disaster. But when I tasted it, lo and behold, it was crunchy, tasty and it did actually added excitement to the over-all palate experience!

I will definitely do this again!

I substituted green beans with asparagus and add a little bit of  chopped garlics. It turned out pretty good but was too greasy. I wonder if it was because I didn't add potatoes and should have removed the skin.

I made this but I use regular chopping potatoes and frozen green beans  and added carrots. I did not use quite as much seasoning  but close and I  used about 8 chicken thighs. For some reason this took me extremely long to cook in my oven, but I doubt that's  normal. I placed the meat on top of all the vegetables  in a big glass pan with edges. Instead of a flat sheet pan.

I have made this about three times over the past two years and it is a hit with my family. I buy the huge family packs of chicken legs or thighs. I make double the amount of "sauce" and cover everything thoroughly. I usually add white wine and garlic - either minced or garlic powder. I usually make so much of this dish that the chicken and potatoes are on one tray and beans in a casserole dish in the oven! Definitely make enough for leftovers because the next day this meal tastes twice as good. YUM!

Easy, tasty.  I used bonelss breasts, so needed reduced cooking time.  I like green beans to be a bit more cooked, so may add earlier next time.

WAY TOO MUCH SALT.  Mind you, I like a lot of salt.  Perhaps my results were due to using sea salt, but I don't think that should matter.  All bites that were above the drippings (not buried in saltiness) were delicious.  Served with home-made tzatkiki and all 4 kids, plus husband, requested that this be added to our monthly menu.

Afterthought:  my lemon-pepper mix contains salt.  This probably contributed to the problem, but still want to stress this is A LOT of salt.

Loved it. I look for recipes that have ingredients I need to use. I had just picked the green beans and wanted recipe with green beans in it. This recipe proved to be delicious although I had to downsize it for two.

Just made this and it was so easy and SO delicious! My husband went in for seconds and usually he is very picky about the way his chicken is seasoned. I actually used chicken tenders instead. After 30 min, I pulled the chicken out and threw in the green beans. After another 15, I pulled the green beans out and left the potatoes in for 10 more min. We like our potatoes crispy and they were amazing!!! Threw it all back in for 1 min to heat back up. We did not have tzatziki sauce, but didn't need it. I did throw some feta on top of the chicken and green beans.

This was okay - I would have added different vegetables to the potatoes.  I found it a bit bland.  It would have been nice to add some onions, cherry tomatoes, etc.

I tweaked to our tastes--we're professional eaters having been 1)been raised in a Reform-Jewish family & 2)marrying into a Reform-Jewish family almost 20 years ago.

I am not big on pre-fab spice blends so I used  thyme, paprika (not smoked), basil, oregano, S/P, lemon ZEST+ lemon juice & threw the shorn and squeezed lemons into the marinade. Garlic? Yes, PLEASE! Upped the ante using two heaping teaspoons minced. Never a mistake in my world. Potatoes I did in the bottom, adding a skosh of butter and a sprinkle of the  listed bits above, but veggies I steamed separately--a little palate break works, too.

HUGE winner! I experimented with chicken thighs on bone and with skin for full flavor potential before I went crazy and roasted a whole chicken, but I think I'm going all the way next. Eating my way through Greece & Turkiye years ago I know I'll never have the skills nor the patience, but this took me back a little bit. Opa!

Tonight is the third time I have made this meal and it comes out excellent every time. I have used this recipe for just the roasted potatoes and green beans for side dishes with other meals also. Wonderful! Thank you for sharing such an easy and delicious recipe!

My wife and I are not huge fans of Lemon flavoring... the only thing we did differently was use Zesty Italian dressing instead of the lemon juice and lemon seasoning. This came out amazingly juicy and the beans were very tasty.

This dish has wonderful flavor -  so easy and so delicious.!  I cut back on the salt and pepper, but all the herbs I used the suggested amount.  I did not have the lemon seasoning, but I used extra lemon juice, approximately 1/2 cup bottled lemon juice.  This is definitely a dish that will be made again and again.

We loved it!  I used chicken thighs and followed the recommendation of WestCoastMom to render off the fat in a skillet. I did decrease the cooking time by 10 minutes as thighs don't take as long as leg quarters. I also decreased the salt and pepper to 1 tsp each but used the recommended  amount of herbs.
Great recipe that I know that I will make again and again. Thanks for the recipe!

I'm wanting to incorporate more Mediterranean dishes into my diet.  This is the first meal I tried and it was delicious.   And to top that it was so easy.   One sheet pan, one bowl and you are set.  The only thing I did different was to use fresh basil.  It was so good, but the next day it was even better!  Try this you will love it.

This is soooo yummy !  I used breast tenders and Greek seasoning, onion powder, juice of 1 fresh lemon and subbed sliced baby carrots, cut-up russet potatoes and a few green onions.  1/2 cup of olive oil, easy on the salt and some fresh-ground black pepper.  Heat oven to 400 to start, lowered to 360 after 30 min.  Crisping everything under the broiler at the end makes for a very eye-appealing dish.  I'm scarfing down the few leftovers as I write this.  This is a keeper !

This was really good.  I adjusted the baking time for the chicken since I used boneless tenders and they cook faster.  The beans and potatoes made for a really special side dish.  It was very fragrant baking in the oven with the herbs and olive oil.  Thanks for the recipe!

I'm not sure I should be rating this recipe since I changed it so much but I used this one as a guide while cooking one night.  Changes:  Used boneless chicken breasts, russet potatoes peeled and cut in pieces, and zucchini cut in chunks plus a cut up red onion.  I mixed the olive oil, lemon juice and spices along with minced garlic in a bowl.  Half of this mixture was tossed with the vegetables and roasted for a half hour while the chicken marinated in the other half of the mixture.  After a half hour, the vegetables were stirred and chicken added to the roasting pan.  Roasted for a half hour more.  Sprinkled with Romano cheese before serving.  It was yummy and easy!

Yes, used boneless skinless chicken breast. Next time I’ll use leg quarters with skin and reduce amount of lemon flavor. Was too overpowering.

I used six boneless, skinless breasts.  This was very flavorful, quick and easy.  I needed to make twice as much of the oil mixture, probably because BSCB have less fat than leg quarters.

This is definitely a keeper!  My husband and I loved it, and he couldn't stop saying how good it smelled the whole time it was in the oven cooking.  The only change I made was to use a good organic Lemon and Pepper mixture I found at Wholefoods because I couldn't find Lemon and Herb.  I therefore, decreased the amount of pepper to about 1/2 tsp fresh ground pepper.  I used 8 thighs and they were so tender and the flavor had just the right amount of lemon to enhance all of those delicious herbs. The potatoes were so light and lemony as well.  We enjoyed the leftovers the following night just as much. Reheated in the microwave for about 5-6 minutes at half power.  YUM!!

I only added lemmon pepper to the chicken, but used all other spices on beans and potatoes.  Delicious. Don't really like thighs though so would use different chicken next time.

I make this all the time but have usually made the green beans in a separate pan since I want chicken skin to crisp.   This one pan method motivated me to just remove the green beans and return the chicken to the oven for browning under broiler.  Delicious.  Greek Chicken is a favorite.

Really good - made with chicken breasts - I think you could probably sub broccoli or zucchini for green beans and it would also be great. Whole family enjoyed. Tzatziki is nice accompaniment - you could also sprinkle feta on top for last couple minutes...

I followed this recipe exactly, substituting 4 boneless breasts for the legs. I honestly thought that my oven was about to go on fire from the oil burning in the pan. I cooked it for the 30 minutes, and then transferred the chicken and potatoes to a glass baking dish, after draining the oil. The chicken was delicious, but nowhere near crispy (I was pressed for time, so skipped the suggested broiler step). I cooked the green beans separately, using the same mixture. They could've used about 25 minutes, instead of the 15. All in all a good recipe, full of flavor.

Delicious!  I made ONE substitution.  I cut up an eggplant into chunks to replace the green beans.  I'm sure the beans would be fine, but eggplant made it seem more Greek to me.  I mixed it all together in a large baking PAN (not sheet) and baked.  It was quite wonderful.

This was not as flavorful as I  hoped. I'll add more lemon and spices next time. I also mixed split breasts with chicken thighs and they cooked at different rates so I need to use the same cut all around. I had some leftover kale which I added with the beans and that was really good.

It turned out great. I did mine little different I wrapped it up in foil. With me doing this the food didn't get very  crispy on top. When I should have unwrapped it the last 15 minutes to get that nice golden brown color on the chicken. Next time I will.  This is a dinner to make for the Family. :)

This is so good!  I add carrots and the seasoning is absolutely delicious with the carrots. I sometimes just make the vegetables without the chicken as a side dish for something else.

Made this dish and it was delicious. Whole family loved it. I put a little less oregano (since I don't love oregano) and I added dill and coriander. I didn't have "lemon herb" (not even sure what that is), so I put in one T of dried lemon peel (maybe that's the same thing?). Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderful. I put the whole dish on broil for the last 4 minutes. Definitely a keeper.

Loved it but my oven was too hot so I transferred to the stovetop and covered it to keep from drying  out the chicken when the potatoes were done.

Turned out pretty good. Followed recipe as written. Could not find either Greek or lemon and herb seasoning in my  market so I ended up making my own lemon and herb seasoning recipe from another website. I was nervous about the amount of seasoning used in the recipe but it did turn out quite tasty. Hubs loved it. Potatoes and beans were cooked to perfection.Will make it again.

I enjoyed this dish very much as I love all things with lemon, basil and oregano!  I'm going to try to marinate the chicken in the herb/lemon juice/oil mixture next time to see if it will give the meat a more lemony taste ... Opa!

Oh my goodness! This was a hit! One picky husband and two picky kids ... Mmm Mmm goodness! We skipped the potatoes and used cauliflower tots instead.  Loved this seasoning mixture.  Great note to start my new year resolution of cooking one new meal every week!  Next time trying it with boneless chicken and little less salt.

Made as written except used boneless chicken breast (personal preference) and used Greek seasoning because I couldn’t find lemon herb.  Entire family loved it...even finicky 15-year-old daughter whi eats very little meat!

My husband and I had 3 guests.  One was a 13 yr. old and her mother was starting a whole30 diet.  So I looked this up and it looked and sounded delicious.  It was a big hit!  I only added a bit of turkey seasoning and thyme.  I used skinless and boneless breast and some drum sticks.  I will make this again!  It was so easy!

Fantastic! Even my picky teens loved it. Putting it into rotation 1/mo. I halved the Organo though, since I'm not a big fan of that flavor. I also prefer crispy green beans so cooked those separate.  I will play around with including them once I figure out right cook time for potatoes & Chicken. Used Chicken breast and cooked at 400 for around 30 min total. Chicken was a little  bit dry but potatoes good.

THIS WAS DELICIOUS!   I read probably 30 reviews before I made this because I rarely cook with dark chicken meat but I found a great sale and was looking for an amazing recipe.  FOUND IT!  
I did chicken quarters.... and because my family is bigger I had to do the chicken on one pan and potatoes/green beans on another.    I had Greek seasoning so I used that in some EVOO and marinated chicken for 2 hours.  
Cooked first round with tin foil to keep moisture in.  Next two rounds without.   At end, flipped over and broiled bottom of chicken for 5 minutes, did same then for top.  
IT WAS A HIT!   I made my favorite tzatzaki sauce recipe and there were NO LEFTOVERS

I can’t cook to save my soul and this came out great! I used chicken breasts instead of the quarters (because I thought it would be easier for my sons to eat). Paired with some prepared Tzatziki sauce, some hummus and Greek Pita bread and it was great!

I don’t know how other cooks are making this work with a whole tablespoon of salt, but I didn’t do that. I used a teaspoon each of salt and pepper and it was just salty and spicy enough. If you like your food spicy, then go ahead and use all the pepper. I didn’t change anything else and it was delicious. I have a very picky teenager and she went back for seconds.

This was really easy, but I did mess it up by lining the baking sheet with aluminum foil.  The juices ended up under the foil so the dish was drier than it should have been.  It was still very tasty and I will make it again - without the foil!

One of the most flavorful chicken dishes I have ever tasted.  Made me fall in love with chicken thighs all over again as this dish has been my newest inspiration.  I used canned green beans because I didn't have fresh but threw them in about 5 minutes before pulling out the chicken.  Did not want to overcook the already cooked vegetables.  The sauce left in the bottom is well worth the effort of squeezing all the juice from the lemons.  The spices worked amazingly together.  This dish will become a staple in my home.

The seasoning mix was delicious - I used only
half of the herbs, 1 lemon total and used the full amount of olive oil - baked as directed - did not
like how the fresh green beans cooked - shriveled
up and were hard - will leave out next time and
maybe add some carrots - thanks for the great
recipe.

I used skinless/boneless chicken thighs instead of chicken leg quarters. I reduced the cooking time by 15 minutes. It was very tasty and the recipe was very easy to follow. I love that  this recipe is cooked in one pan. I lined the baking pan with foil for super easy clean up. Dinner on the table in under an hour. Yes, I would cook this again.

This recipe is amazing and perfect as is.  However, my family is weak, so I have to cut the spices in half for them.  Also, they prefer broccoli over green beans so I use 4 heads of broccoli instead.  I make this as much as I can.

This recipe received rave reviews from our guests! The chicken turns out moist and delicious and it is such an easy recipe to put together. I may cut the olive oil to 1/3 cup next time because it did seem like a lot, but that did not detract from the flavor and everyone's compliments.

So delicious and the aroma while baking is amazing!  Easy and impressive enough for company.  I reduced the oil significantly,  but otherwise made no changes.  Will definitely make again!

I used 4 bone in, skin on chicken thighs. Couldn't find lemon and herb seasoning or Greek seasoning. Had lemon pepper seasoning and used that along with the other ingredients. This was my first experiment with a "sheet pan" dinner. It was awesome , a definite "keeper".

Very easy to make-  Family loved it... however instead of using 2tbsp of Basil and Dried Oregano next time I will probable use only 1 tbsp of each. Potatoes were great just a little heavy on the seasoning for my family.

Delicious, used Mrs dash for the lemon herb seasoning. Definitely cut in half for our family, and could maybe cut back on the herbs as it was very seasoned

Excellent standard Greek chicken recipe. I did not make the beans but I did add the chopped fresh garlic. I did not use the Greek seasoning. Just added more oregano and basil.

This is really phenomenal!  I lot of the "salt free" seasonings are lemon and herb, so there is a good chance you already have it in your cupboard.  We pared this with some tzatziki sauce (of you don't have that on hand you can make some with greek yogurt, dill, garlic, and lemon very quickly) and it has become a family favorite!

Delicious and easy! I followed the recipe exactly and used boneless skinless chicken thighs since it was what I had. Personally, there was a little too much pepper for my taste so I'll probably lower the amount the next time I make it. Served it with tzatziki sauce and a Greek salad.

There were WAY too many herbs, it was caked on the chicken. IF I make this again I will definitely use enough for flavor but not 2 Tablespoons of each!

This was very good!  Only thing I changed was I that I used boneless chicken breasts instead of thighs.  Other than that, followed the recipe and it was perfect.  I will definitely make it again.

I really like this. Used chicken thighs skin on. Interesting mix of spices. Very strong flavor the tzatziki sauce (sp?) is a great addition, in fact it's kind of mentioned in passing  but it is a great complement to this dish. Will definitely make again!

This is one of my new favorites!  So delicious and easy!  I made a couple of changes because of what I had available. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and they turned out great.  Lots of flavor, not dry at all.  I also used red potatoes and cut them into pieces.  They were also very tasty!  The only other small change was using lemon infused olive oil instead of regular.  It added more lemon flavor but would've been delicious either way!  Yum!

Flavor was good, but I must have done something wrong,  or my oven or pan was off. I had dried herbs burned onto my baking pan, and a lot of the oil/herb mixture left.

This was a hit at my house! My picky 6 year old said "we should have this every night!" The only change I made was to use boneless skinless breasts, because they were all I had on hand, but I think it would be better with the legs. I shortened the cooking time, but the breasts were still slightly dry. Next time I will follow the recipe exactly.

My husband loved it! I tweaked little bit. I added garlic and  cayenne pepper. I had to replace lemon and herb with lemon pepper, potato with baby radish, beans with carrots since I didn't have them. I put everything in the dish and put it in the oven. At the end broiled for 4 minutes. It was perfect!

I used drumsticks and those cooked in about 45 minutes. I also cut my potatoes in large chunks so I removed the chicken and let those cool a little while longer. Smelled amazing while it was cooking and tastes great. Didn't make any changes to the amount of spices used.

Made it and only changed one thing.  I doubled the lemon herb spice.  It was superb!  Thanks for the recipe!

The flavor was very good but it was definitely too salty and too much pepper too. It calls for a Tablespoon of salt and probably should have said teaspoon. I like salt on my food but this was overboard. I reduced the pepper by about half but still found it too strong. I will try it again with less of both and hopefully it'll be just right. Also I used skinless boneless chicken breasts. Cooked the potatoes for 20 minutes, added the chicken and oil mixture and cooked it for 15 minutes, turned the chicken over added the green beans and cooked it an additional 20 minutes. They were perfect.

This is a beautiful recipe. I took the lazy way out, and used Greek seasoning that I had purchased a while back. I mixed the Greek seasoning, olive oil, and juice from two limes. I only had on hand drumsticks and boneless skinless chicken breasts.  The aroma while it was baking was absolutely beautiful. My daughter and I could not wait until it was done. LOL. Lessons learned: it needs more oil and lime juice so that there is enough for each serving that we prepped.  The directions did not say to cover the dish, so 30 minutes later the potatoes were still a bit hard.  I used russet baking potatoes and quartered them. I know the recipe calls for small potatoes so this may not have been a problem. I covered the dish, and then gave it another 20 minutes which made it perfect.  We will definitely be making this more often because we are learning to meal prep. We thank you very, very much! God bless all the wonderful chefs here.  I need all the help I can get in the kitchen.

So good. My 9 year old son and husband loved it. I didn't add salt, so we blended some of it up for the 9 month old baby and he loved it too! Simple, fast and pretty healthy. The lemon makes it yummy

This was delicious. I subbed Brussels sprouts (halved) for the green beans. I spooned some marinade over the chicken and cooked for 30 minutes. Then I tossed the potatoes (Yukon gold, halved) and sprouts with the remaining marinade and added to the pan, cooking for 30 minutes more. Everything was cooked perfectly and well seasoned. I did decrease the salt and pepper to 1 teaspoon each. Next time I will add some garlic. Great one pan meal. Thanks for sharing.

I used Greek Seasoning and Boneless, Skinless Chicken Thighs. I wanted dark meat but have grown squeamish with bones over the years (I honestly can't tell you why), so boneless thighs seemed like the perfect compromise. This was absolutely delicious. The potatoes were absolutely to die for, with excellent flavor and a nicely crisped skin. Even the green beans were perfect. I failed to account for the smaller chicken pieces, so the chicken was a little overcooked--but actually still so tasty! My husband is usually ambivalent towards chicken and he couldn't stop telling me how much he enjoyed it. Also--this was so incredibly easy to make. I loved that the most ardent task here was trimming the green beans.

made this because of it being a one dish meal.  Marinated the chicken overnight and everything was delicious!!  Grandsons were for a visit and they enjoyed it too. Also made the sauce but didn't read the reviews first big mistake!!  You definitely need to drain the yogurt and cucumbers, it was still good but runny. So don't forget to drain!!  Will definitely make again.

five stars is not enough for this dynamic recipe. I used chicken breasts in place of legs, and doubled the olive oil. I also substituted Greek Seasoning in place of lemon herb seasoning. I didn't have basil, so I added another tablespoon of the Greek seasoning. I served it with homemade Tzatziki sauce. It was so simple and so easy and so tasty. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.

I really liked the taste of is dish, however, I will make adjustments in the future.  When the time was up, the chicken and potatoes still needed an additional 30 minutes to cook. The beans were already done and getting dry. The next time I make it I will leave the chicken in longer and then put the beans on the last fifteen minutes.  The taste was so good though!  My family really liked it and I will make it again!

It is so strange that I had just read an article on how heart healthy the Mediterranean diet was and whala I accidentally stumble across this recipe. I used boneless  skinless breasts because I dont particularly like thighs. The only note which I am sure most already know is boneless and breast cook much quicker than bone-in thighs. I cooked the potatoes first then added the chicken when it was time to add the green beans and it took around 20 minutes. Delicious.

Loved this recipe!  I used all thighs per our preference and added the zest of one of the lemons to the green beans.  I also baked the chicken and potatoes for an hour, removed the chicken to rest, drained off excess fat and roasted the potatoes and green beans at 450 for fifteen minutes per another reviewer's recommendations.  The chicken was fork-tender, the whole thing was seasoned great, and I the kick from the lemon was delightful.  Thank you so much for a great, easy to prepare recipe that will likely become a favorite in our family.

I'd make this again in a heart beat.  It is so easy and tasty, to boot.  The only thing I would change is the cooking time for the green beans.  I thought they were a little tough, but otherwise this is a great recipe.

Pretty darn good.  I definitely will make this again.  I made a couple minor changes to the recipe: used 4 chicken thighs instead of quarters.  Used half the amount of potatoes and 50% more green beans which were french cut.

I've made this 3 times now and it never disappoints.  The first time I had to use a whole chicken cut up (couldn't find leg quarters) and I worried the white meat wouldn't respond to the other ingredients the way I could expect dark meat to.  The breast meat was JUST as tasty as the rest!  Potatoes, awesome.  Green beans, awesome.  One time I forgot the salt.  Still awesome.  Never have had the greek lemon seasoning to include (as the recipe calls for).  Still awesome.  I do add a tablespoon or two of jarred minced garlic (in my opinion, garlic never hurts, unless it's dessert :-) )  When I make it again (and I definitely will!) I'm going to try cutting back JUST A LITTLE on the herbs-- it's tasty in the amounts as called for, but it piles up on the chicken and I just wonder if it's necessary... I'm betting it will still be awesome.  So far, there just doesn't seem to be anything you can do to hurt this recipe...!  (Even my 19 year old who insists he "doesn't like chicken" devours this every time!)

Omg this is so delicious. I didn't use the tanziki sauce instead I poured the pan juice over the potatoes after on the plate. My husband suggested next time using asparagus instead of green beans, I can't wait to try it that way. I will definitely make this again.

This was very delicious and as mentioned the smell is amazing.  I cut the potatoes into wedges and it took more than 1 hour to cook. I turned the oven up part way through the cooking time to 375 after 45 minutes and cooked everything for another 1/2 hour. I also put everything on parchment paper to make cleanup easier. Glad I did that as it crisped things up a bit. I didn't have fresh beans so I added frozen and let them cook for 15 minutes. They tasted good but were a bit mushy so fresh is best but frozen works. I think baby carrots would be a good addition to make it an even heartier meal. Thanks for sharing.

This was a great meal. Made with chicken thighs, bone in with skin. I lightly Browned the chicken first in a hot skillet with a bit of olive oil and chopped garlic. Followed rest of recipe to the letter. Fantastic!

It was really good! The chicken was tender. If you're looking for a Greek chicken bake then this is a keeper. Everything done in the same pan makes cleanup easy too. Will make again.

I made this recipe as it is and my hubby is a really picky eater and we both completely devoured this dinner. Actually, I did make one teensy modification which was to add baby carrots because I LOVE baby carrots, but where I thought this dish was going to be over spiced, it came out perfect. 
The whole house was filled with an awesome aroma and the everything came out perfectly baked. I thought the carrots were going to be undercooked and crunchy, but they turned out perfect and just fork tender. 
I'm definitely making this again!

I followed the recipe exactly how it was and it came out delicious. I was a little hesitant because I have never made a dinner like this but I will most definitely make it again! The chicken was juicy and everything was so delicious.

Changed this up a bit. Used thighs, marinated them in the oil, lemon and herbs,  garlic, salt and pepper for a few hours. Sliced russets, tossed them with EVO, layered them on the bottom of a casserole dish. Put the chicken over the potatoes, poured the marinade over the dish. Baked at 400 for 40 minutes. Chicken and potatoes browned nicely. Thumbs up from the family.

I have to agree this made the whole house smell AMAZING.  I am heavy handed with seasoning, and I think I cold have used about 1/2 this much on 6 leg quarters.  It was delicious and even my teenage daughter who usually will not eat any type of meat had to try it.  She liked it too!  This one is a keeper.  Probably the only things I will change next time is that I will make the green beans or another vegetable separately so the entire meal does not have the same seasonings and  will cut back a bit on each one and just use one lemon.  Thanks for sharing a great dish that is so simple to make!

I loved it and so did my family but I did mess it up due to poor instructions... In the beginning it doesn't state things clearly but my mistakes were easily fixed....  whoever wrote it out needs to rewrite it..
Oh and I chose to use chicken breasts...

This was amazing!   This morning as I was packing my lunch, I was snacking on the green beans.  I ended up eating them all cold like a green bean salad. Then, ate the potatoes cold - Greek potato salad is born! Here are the changes I made: reduced pepper to 1 tsp - still a little too much. I cooked the green beans in a separate small casserole dish with some of the reserved dressing.  I had some mushrooms to use, so first I put the sliced mushrooms in the dish and baked for about 10 minutes, then I added  the beans, tossed, baked for 10 minutes.  Toss and bake for another 10 minutes.  I took them out of the oven and covered them in foil until they cooled enough to put in the fridge and the result is either a delicious hot side dish or delicious cold green bean salad.  Also added lemon zest and a shallot to each dish.

It was OK. It was easy, but didn't have much flavor. The flavor increased after the second day. I eventually removed the onions, garlic; chopped up the chicken and made an awesome chicken dumpling soup with it.

This was awesome!!  I used a lemon infused olive oil so I cut back the lemon juice to half which turned out to be perfect.  I also (accidentally, duh) only used half the amount of basil, oregano and lemon/herb seasonings but it worked for my brood of picky eaters.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I followed the recipe as directed.  There are few things I will change the next time. First:  lower the temp. to 375. Chicken was dry. Second:  only use half of a medium sized lemon. Lemon was very prominent  in the flavors. Third: Instead of mixing everything together I will brush chicken with lemon juice and olive oil. Then sprinkle each seasoning separately . Done as directed it is very pasty and goes on to thick for me. All in all with the tweaks I'd make it again.

This really delicious.  Too bad I could not read other ratings for the last couple of days because someone  had a good idea of rendering the fat out of chicken thighs before baking it .  Wish I would have thought that far because my oven is a mess.  Have to clean it before Thanksgiving.

Very good!  I used a roasting pan, so I had to adjust the cooking time and temp a little.  I used a whole chicken  since that's what I had on hand.  I used Greek seasoning in place of the lemon & herb seasoning.  Will definitely make this again!

I did not make many changes, perhaps a little more lemon juice.  This was absolutely delicious!  I loved the green beans, superb flavor.   I also used canned green beans, I added them near the end of baking.  I added carrots also, they were great!  I wonder what other veggies would go well with this dish?

My family loved it. I didn't have basil or oregano by itself and used Italian seasoning instead, because those spices where in there. So it had a little extra spices. Tasted just like my friends  Greek chicken.   I also ran out of the oil and spices for the green beans and tossed them in a bowl of oil by itself before adding it to the chicken.

This recipe  was simple to prepare and yummy! I reduced all the spices in half, though, as it was way too much as written.  I decided to use the vegetables I had on hand  - potatoes, sweet potatoes, young beets and broccoli crowns - it turned out great!  Use whatever vegetables you enjoy.  Don't forget to add some sliced garlic cloves.  Delish!
Another easy variation is to use frozen boneless, skinless chicken breasts and cook them with the potatoes for 45 min., then add frozen whole green beans and 1/4 cup of diced red peppers, drizzle with remaining oil and spices and cook for an additional 10 - 15 minutes.  The chicken stays moist and it is delicious.

Absolutely wonderful!!!! I used chicken breasts, bone in, and did use Greek Seasoning---sooo delicious. Can be tweaked to taste and next time I will put the green beans in at the beginning to really make it an easy one pan meal. I baked at 350 for an hour or so and it was perfect. The more "sauce" the better! I marinated everything together in a plastic bag for several hours before baking.

This recipe has become a family favourite!  I didn't use the lemon and pepper seasoning and I baked it for 45 minutes covered with foil and the last 15 minutes I take the foil off.  It's awesome.

This was the best thing ive ever made...all the guests agreed! So fresh, so tasty...the leftovers.. Everything!!!

The only changes were I used only thighs, and a sweet onion, plus used garlic and lemon seasoning rather than lemon seasoning. Love this dish!!!!

This was OUTSTANDING!! I didn't have basil and oregano, so I just added more of the lemon seasoning. My 6 year old cleaned her plate, my 8 year old said, "The chicken is the best part, and I don't like chicken!" And, my husband, who is pickier than the kids cleaned his plate except for one lonely chicken bone! I will make it again!

I used za'atar seasoning.  It was a lot of seasoning, but that works for us.  Everything was very flavorful - the chicken, potatoes, green beans.  My husband particularly enjoyed the lemon flavor.  Our leg quarters were kind of big.  Next time will make with just thighs.  I think it will be soon. ??

Will definitely make this again. Kids ate every bite and wanted seconds. I did end up making this with boneless skinless breast cause thats what I had handy. So I had to adjust the cut of the potatos so the breasts didn't come out like hockey pucks or face raw potatos. (Bleh) The next time I plan to make it with bone in skin on thighs and see what magic happens!

Probably the best tasting chicken I ever made, however, next time I may cut back a little on the olive oil. The chicken makes a lot of drippings because you leave skin on. I did take a kitchen scissors and cut off all visible fat. We loved it and it is even good heated up next day or cold.

My roommate suffers from ridiculous acid so went on an intense search of low acid meals. This chicken recipe us fantastic. Juicy, tender, so flavorful and crazy easy. Plus mission accomplished, no acid.

This was easy and my family loved it!  Suggest using the correct pan and keeping chicken and potatoes separate so everything is nice and crisp.  I lined the pan with foil and easy easy clean up!  We will do it again!

Used boneless skinless thighs. Tossed all ingrediants (minus  veggies) in the oil, lemon and herbs. Cut the potatoes in thinner pieces. Cooked at 375 for  20 minutes, added asparagus (didn't have beans) and cooked another 20 minutes. Fantastic!!

I used thighs and chicken breasts because some people want white meat.  Everyone loved it (or said they did).  Very tasty but I might cut back on the spices and herbs a little.  Will make again.

Very Good !  I had to  cut the recipe in half for 2 people, did not have small red-skinned potatoes on hand, but substituted peeled Idaho potatoes cut in half lengthwise.  I also reduced the amount of black pepper ( it creates  digestive  problems for one of us)

I used Greek seasoning as a few people suggested rather than the lemon herb seasoning and was a little concerned when I saw the oil-herb mixture that there was maybe too much oregano and just too much herbs overall, compared to the amount of oil.  But rest assured, the dish was delicious--my family really enjoyed the meal.  I also followed the advice in one of the previous comments and removed the chicken and green beans from the casserole dish, turned the oven up to 450 degrees to roast the potatoes remaining in the dish for a few minutes--watching closely so they were crispy and not  burned.  So good!

This dish has amazing flavor and did come together really quickly. I did like how easy it was, and I will be making it again. However, the chicken was a little on the dry side which could have been due to over cooking. Next time I make it I will try cooking it a little less. All in all though, it's definitely worth a try.

This was delicious.  The house smelled wonderful while it was baking.  The only thing that confused me is that the recipe said to stir the potatoes with the olive oil and all the spices and arrange them around the chicken.  Then it said to pour about 3/4 of oil mixture over the chicken.  It was all poured over with the potatoes and there was none left.  So when it was time to put the green beans in, there was no reserved oil mixture to toss and coat the green beans.  
It came out okay, but I don't think the recipe was worded correctly.  I will make it again.

Very delicious and easy to make! I also cut way back on the salt seasonings and might also suggest cutting back slightly on the other dry seasonings.

It was ok.  My husband asked me not to make it again.  He said all the spices looked like mud on it and there wasn't enough flavor.  I had to eat the leftovers, which I cut up and put in a salad. If I do make it again, I will use more lemon and less basil and oregano.   I will also precook the green beans because in order not to overlook the chicken, I had to take the pan out while the beans were not tender enough or even crisp tender,

I used 6 chicken legs and a little over 1/2 a bag of small red potatoes. I know it sounds like a lot of seasoning, but most of it will end up in the bottom of the pan so you do need quite a bit to get a good flavor. I only used 1/2 the amount of seasonings called for (except salt) and it was perfect for my family. I used 1 tbsp of the basil and oregano & 1 tbsp of Mediterranean seasoned coarse salt since I didn't have the lemon seasoning, and 1/2 tbsp pepper. I used 1 lemon, but i think the 2 called for would've been better. I did broil at the end to crisp the skin up. Family loved it!

Delicious!  This came out really good and was super simple to make. I have never seen  lemon herb seasoning in the store- so I used lemon pepper.  I used large potatoes that I cut into  chunks.  Next time  I'll use less oil and less salt and maybe I'll add some carrots with the potatoes.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Best home cooked chicken I've ever made. Followed the recipe and used Greek seasonings and a little lemon pepper. Only complaint is the potatoes over cooked a little but it had a very good flavor.

Absolutely awesome. I always read reviews, after reading the Greek girls reviews, I decided to follow her tweaks,...after all, she is Greek right.
Lots of garlic added, wow, this was so good!
The potatoes were crispy on outside, and the inside was all yummy and garlicky, and kinda melted in my mouth.
In the future, when I'm just cooking up potatoes, I'm cooking them like this.
But have printed out this recipe now, cuz it is a keeper!!!!

DIdn't have real potatoes so I made packaged mashed and fancied them up with dried parsley. Used the spice to rub on chicken, then drizzled oil on and baked. Found some canned green beans, put  Italian dressing all over and served cold.  Made a great meal and I will definitely make it again.

I haven't tried this recipe, but the seasonings sound wonderful.  The chicken/root vegetable bake I do calls for the chicken to be placed on top of the veggies and the fat and juices from the chicken drip down, flavoring the vegetables.  It's wonderful.

This was really great ! I used bone in chicken breasts (with skin on to get a nice crispy crust that holds the juice in the chicken) just because that's what we prefer. Only recommendation is cutting the salt back to two teaspoons. Will make again.

We love this dish so much that I make it almost every week now.  I cut back the seasonings just a little bit, and added Greek Seasoning in place of the Lemon Herb Seasoning.  We also put Greek Cucumber and Dill Dressing on it sometimes in place of Tzatziki.  It's also great with some Feta Cheese crumbles sprinkled on top.  I love the smell when it's baking!  Leftovers make a great lunch, too.  (I always make a large batch)  This is one of my family's faves!

The only thing I would suggest,  which is my favorite part of Greek chicken is to make the lemon betchmel sauce to put on top of the chicken and potatoes! So yummy! Greek chicken just isn't Greek chicken without the betchmel sauce!! It makes the whole dish!

This was really tasty. The potatoes were crispy and great.  The chicken was a bit dry but  that may have been because I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of the more moist chicken legs called for in the recipe.  It was still very good and I served it with steamed broccoli.

Very tasty and easy to make. I didn't have the lemon-herb seasoning so I used herbs de Provence. I also used a little less oregano than called for because I'm not a huge oregano fan. Will make this again. Good dish.

I cut the recipe in half and used four boneless skinless chicken thighs. It was a little salty, so next time I'll use less and add salt later if needed. Was easy and yummy, will be added to our rotation, especially with cooler weather coming.

Had 8 people for dinner and everyone raved about this dish.  Instead of chicken thighs, I used a whole cut up chicken.  I also cooked the green beans in a separate pyrex dish.

I made this for Sunday dinner and everyone loved it! I used lime juice instead of lemon, since that's what I had. I also threw in 1 lime cut into wedges.  I put all the ingredients in a ziploc bag in the frig overnight  so I could just dump it into the baking pan in the morning and set on time bake. PERFECT.  My husband was amazed at how great baked limes are - the rind is even delicious!

I have now made this recipe 3 times. It quickly became my daughter's favorite meal.  I use 4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs (family preference) and the Greek seasoning instead of the lemon herb.  We serve it with the recommended Easy Tzatziki Sauce and Naan bread.  I halve the potato's and skip the beans and reduce the overall cooking time to 30 minutes.

The recipe was great! Juicy and tender. I managed to find the lemon herb seasoning at whole foods. It's not in the usual seasoning bottle; it's in more of a small plastic tub with a lid. Will definitely remake.

I made it using 4 thighs, and about 1/2 tbsp each of salt and pepper instead of 1 tbsp each.  (You can always add more once you taste it.). Those were the only changes I made.  I really liked it!  My husband thought the potatoes absorbed too much of the flavor, so next time I'll cook them separate, or just use olive oil on them and use the seasoning/oil mix on the chicken and beans.  I might cut back on the oil, too, maybe do a 1/4 cup plus 1-2 tbsp.

I didn't add that much salt and pepper, there is plenty in Cavender's Greek seasoning spices.  If you use bottled lemon juice, 3 tablespoons is about one lemon.  I didn't add the green beans. The sauce was enough for 4 chicken breasts and 3 red potatoes. Next time I'll broil it more at the end.

This was SO good! I didn't have any lemon herb seasoning so I used rosemary with all of the other seasonings in the recipe. It smelled so good and the flavor was amazing. I will definitely make it again. My only problem was my oven cooking things and evenly so I had to do a lot of rotating in and out of the pan.

My husband devoured this dish.  My 4 year old at all of the chicken on his plate, no complaints!  For me, this is a keeper.  The only change I made was that I used two split chicken breasts along with the legs.  It turned out great! There are a substantial amount of herbs and lemon flavoring to this dish.  If you prefer something more bland, this is probably not for you.

I liked it! However, may want to be easy on the salt. I'd suggest cutting the salt down to 1/2 tbsp. I'm from the south, and we use salt in everything. This was just too salty. Otherwise, great dish!

Overall, this was a good recipe  I did follow another reviewer's suggestion and put the chicken thighs in a cold pan and cook until the skins were brown. This was a great suggestion. I would recommend using only half of the pepper and use a tablespoon of "fine herbs". Also, I added an extra lemon at the end.  Worth it.

This is da bomb!  Loved it. Husband and kids are not very picky (I put food on table and they will eat it) so I can never gauge how good my food.  I am the picky eater and like real flavor a (hate bland food). The herb blend was perfect. I only added some Greek olives (I had them so why not!) but didn't need it. Next time I'm doubling the amount and taking leftovers for lunch!  My peeps didn't leave me any leftovers and frankly I don't blame them. Super easy. Love his recipe!!

Good dish, used lemon pepper instead and you definitely have to use less as it contains too much salt.  So didn't put any additional salt in.  Cooked at 400 for a total time of 1 hr. I used bone in chicken thighs.  Also the used only 1 tbsp. of both oregano and basil, had plenty of flavour, you also can cut down a little on the oil amount, bit too oily.

I made this with bone-in, skin-on thighs instead of quarters. It had great flavours but next time I might halve the spice amounts as I found it to a little overpowering. Would also give the green beans 20-25 minutes instead of 15. And don't forget to grease your sheet pan! I can't stress this enough, otherwise your food will stick!

Very flavourful recipe. My boyfriend and I loved it, the kids used a lot of tzatziki on thier a. I used breasts and baby potatoes so I cooked 1/2hour at 400 then shook the potatoes and added green beans and cooked  another 15 min. The rest of the recipe I followed as written. I will definitely make again

Per the recipe, was a little salty for me. I even used less salt than they asked for. Didn't read the bottom either until it was too late, but next time I'll broil it to get the chicken crispy. Other than that, not bad. Green beans were amazing. Enjoyed cooking this one. Family loved it too.

Used chicken legs and since I had more than the recipe called for I used half again as many spices. I really liked this. Grandma thought it was too peppery and next time I will go easier on the lemon pepper (no lemon herb at the store) and increase lemon zest. Carrots instead of green beans were very tasty and the yellow baby potatoes were so creamy. Definitely repeatable, and good cold the next day for lunch too.

My family loved it! This tasted great and was a beautiful presentation, but it made a mess on the inside of my oven! All the olive oil spattered and starting smoking like crazy. I moved it out to my gas grill and finished outside. I'd love to make it again but need to figure out how to prevent the smoke and mess. Any ideas?

To make it even better, forget about dried spices.  You can buy basil and oregano in tubes.  Double the amount used because fresh spices are less strong than dried, but so much better.  I think the potatoes are better if you cook in a separate pan to allow them to get crunchy.  If you are making without potatoes, use half the oil but all of the seasoning.
If you are making this with flank steak.... Season the steak with salt, pepper and cayenne pepper and cover with foil for 2 hours.  Then pour the oil mixture over the flank steak, spreading it on thick on both sides.  Then, cook in the oven on a broiler pan or grill.  Really good.
One last thing, use fresh lemon juice.  The concentrate doesn't have the same zing.

I loved it and each time it gets better as I tweak it for my families taste. Liked oven baked much better than crock pot.
Finally found the Russett potatoes and the greek seasoning. Used garlic salt on the green beans in lemon juice after spraying them with olive oil(none was leftover after mixing up the potatos)
Browning the chicken thighs with skin on before baking as the recipe said made dinner perfect

While making it, we kept thinking it was way too much seasoning and herbs in the mix, but it turned out to be just perfect. We really loved it. :D

Made this recipe as stated, and the chicken was wonderful, tender with crispy skin. We found the potatoes a little too lemony. Next time I will use just one lemon, or use the juice from the second lemon as much as possible just over the chicken pieces. It's also possible that I had unusually large and juice lemons! Will try again.

I added a few pats of butter and sprinkled on some chicken bouillon granules, also added lemon zest and a tiny pinch of sugar to the marinade/sauce. I spread the green beans on a separate baking sheet and cooked them separately simply because I didn't have enough room in my original pan. My 15 year old son says I definitely should make this again! I used bone in, skin on chicken thighs, and probably used more of everything than was called for. I didn't measure anything.

This is now one of my favorite meals from All recipes!! Changes: I put the chicken in a roasting pan with small, red potatoes. I also used one lemon instead of two, and lightly  seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper. I went heavy with Lawry's lemon pepper seasoning on both sides of the chicken, then drizzled the oil/ seasoning mixture on chicken & potatoes!! YUUUMMM!!!!

This recipe is so delicious! Because I made it in the summer I made it on top of the stove to save the heat. I didn't change a thing! The chicken seasoning I used was Beer Can Chicken by Weber. Definitely will make this again!

I made this as the recipe was written, with boneless chicken breasts, and it is a keeper. Making it for two with the seasoning as written (loved the flavor). Will be making this frequently.

Made this tonight for Sunday dinner. My best friend growing up was Greek and his parents has come from Korinthos. His mom made this dish all the time. This recipe has the exact same perfect lemon flavor  as Tina's dish. This is a very herby recipe. Next time I will sprinkle on seasonings after I pour the lemon/olive oil mixture.This will let me control the amount of seasoning and make sure it is evenly distributed. These are personal preference things and in no way a criticism of this recipe. Thank you Chef V for taking me back to a great childhood memory.

The amounts of herbs and spices are more than I'd ever normally use and it was great. Had no lemon seasoning so just added a bit more lemon. Used slightly less salt as we are trying to cut down. We only had chicken breast so reduced cooking time by 15 minutes and parboiled the potatoes for three minutes first. I also chopped a pepper and an onion to up the veggie content and added mixed in with the green beans. Delicious.

GOOD FAST HANDY This is a good meal with very 
little effort. I questioned the amount of spice and I did not measure but put a lot in and it was fine. I made Byrdhouse Blistered Cherry Tomatoes , and it all made a very nice meal.

Excellent! I'm not much of a fan of lemon, but this was very, very good. The lemon was not overpowering at all. I did not have the lemon herb seasoning, so used Greek seasoning that I made, recipe this site. The end result was a tad too spicy, so next time, I will cut pepper in half as the Greek seasoning has pepper in it. I did not have green beans, so used carrots. I'd like to try with cauliflower and broccoli as well. Will definitely make again!

I used breast halves with bone in/skin. I also added carrots and doubled the recipe since I used 8 pieces of chicken and doubled the potatoes. I used the Greek seasoning instead of the lemon seasoning.

Used eggplant, red bell pepper and brocolli, because that's what I had on hand. Great meal because its one bowl to prep and one pan to bake. Didn't come out Greek to me, but was still great. Next time I'll try with tzaziki and green beans as suggested

This was awesome, only thing I would change is amount of salt.  I'd use maybe half.  I used Greek seasoning instead of lemon and herb seasoning, and bone in chicken breast instead of thighs.

I will definitely make this again.  It was delicious, but a little too salty.  I will reduce the salt by ½ next time.  I also made one other change.  I did not have the lemon seasoning, so I checked the label on the Greek seasoning, and it seemed as though it would work. It DID.   I threw in a little lemon zest also.  I didn't have quite enough green beans so I threw in some Brussell sprouts and they also worked beautifully.

It was very black and salty and I followed the recipe very close! I used chicken breasts because we do not like dark meat chicken and it was so tough from over cooking. Obviously the oven was way too hot or I cooked it too long. Very disappointed because there were so many good reviews.

This was amazing.  Our family loved it. The chicken was super juicy and tender and the potatoes were the beyond amazing.  I served it with greek salad and pita and tzatziki.   My only complaint would be that the beans were a touch over spiced for our taste.  I'd toss them in less of the mixture for that step.

No changes but waited a little for the beans (which could get a little too cooked at 425) and then did the broiler for about 5 minutes to brown the chicken more and get it a little crispier. Really enjoyed the mean made two lunches with the left overs since there were only two of us eating.

I am the submitter of this recipe.. I'm so glad many of you are enjoying it. A couple things.. 
This dish is for those who enjoy a lot of flavours and seasonings as well as lemon. 
Use real lemon.. Not the prepared in the bottle. 
Also nowhere in the recipe does it state lemon pepper... If you wish to use it fine, but decrease or omit the pepper as it would be too spicy. 
Salt to taste, but I found that 1 tablespoon works well for all the potatoes, chicken and vegetables . also different brands of spices are saltier than others... So use your best judgement on the salt. 
If you use chicken breast, decrease cooking time and cut potatoes a lot smaller. 
Cooking time will vary depending on how large you leave your potatoes. Try to use a larger pan so everything has some wiggle room so heat can cook everything evenly. 
Thanks :)

Loved this! So simple and tasty.  I used Greek seasoning mix, and 'Real Lemon' juice as I had no fresh lemons on hand. Next time I might toss in some whole garlic cloves (just for fun because I love roasted garlic), but the recipe doesn't need them.

Great recipe, easy. Marinated chicken for over 24 hours in about 1/2 of the seasonings. Chicken absorbed liquid. I added garlic to the chicken. Added garlic and an onion to the potatoes. Didn't have green beans so I skipped. Would like to try them! Update: my green beans didn't turn out well. I'll opt to skip them and just open a can or steam some broccoli. Update: thre some Brussels sprouts on top before putting it in oven. Turned out fabulous. I used the larger ones, whole.

I used boneless chicken breasts and halved the recipe.  It was very spicey which my husband likes.  I would make this again as it was very easy.  I liked the idea of a one pan dish.

This is a keeper! We both loved this easy, one-dish meal. Preparing it didn't trash the kitchen and clean up was a breeze. It's always a bonus when (most of) the ingredients are on hand, which was the case for this (except for the green beans, but so many things could be subbed). The smell of it while cooking got our mouth's watering and it looked awesome coming out of the oven...which is important because how a dish looks plays a big role in people's perception of how something tastes. We loved the flavor - the spices were just right.  I want to give a shout out to the potatoes!...they were especially delicious! I used baby yellow waxed and halved the large ones. The lemon was a nice touch. I will be keeping this one in my "go-to" recipe collection. Simple, relatively healthy and quick. Thanks!

I made it like the recipe suggested with my own twist and it came out great. Only little hitch my potatoes were slightly big and didn't cook as well. I fixed that by cutting them smaller and immersing them in the dish. I also added fresh basil I had , dash of poultry seasoning and fresh red pepper. Delicious!

For the most part this was easy and delicious.  The tzatziki sauce really makes it.  I exchanged the leg quarters for breasts and the lemon herb seasoning for Greek seasoning.  Two notes  - the breasts do not need to stay in the oven for an hour, I would check them after 30 minutes and the greek seasoning in addition to the salt made the dish super salty.  I would probably omit the tablespoon of salt if using the greek seasoning in the future.  Also, I lined the pan with tin foil and our entire dinner clean up was 5 minutes.

I have made this several times, and it is good every time. I use lemon garlic seasoning. I also use whole chicken breasts and cut them in half. I get six servings that way. I leave my green beans in for at least 30 minutes, because I prefer them less crisp.

Holy cow. This is one of the most delicious things I've ever made. I made a couple minor changes. First, I used chicken breasts because that's what I had. I cut them in half so they would be closer in size to thighs. For

Absolutely will make this again!  I made it with chicken thighs, lined the pan with foil, decreased salt and pepper to 2 tsp. each, and left out green beans.  Recommend using different vegetables, such as yellow/orange peppers, red onions, mushrooms and zucchini.  15 minutes were plenty for the vegetables.

This sounded good when I read the recipe; smelled great while baking!  However there was just much too much pepper and salt.  And I'm a big fan of peper!  If I make this again, I'll leave out the salt and pepper altogether.  There is plenty of both in the  Lemon Pepper seasoning mix.  Unless you find a salt free lemon pepper; the only one I've found was at Trader Joes, but as it's in a grinder it would take some effort to grind 2 tablespoons!

This was really, really good. Husband and son loved it, and I loved only having one pan.  I had asparagus on hand, so substituted that for the green beans.  Honestly would be great with any veg. I did add lots of garlic (none in original recipe!!!) and some ground coriander to balance the  flavors. This is a keeper!

This was really easy and really tasty!  Thanks.  Made such a simple meal gourmet.  Will keep the recipe and make it again.  I always like to stick to the recipe first time around so if any tweaks are necessary I know what to do.  Don't need to tweak this one.  Yum!

I loved this recipe and will definitely be making it again. I loved the one pan aspect, it was so easy. I used 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts and quartered small red potatoes. It turned out I had the elusive lemon herb seasoning (it's in the old bay section) but it was super old and I couldn't recall ever using it so I went with lemon pepper and omitted the rest of the pepper. It was delicious!! I broiled the chicken and potatoes for 5 minutes before adding the green beans. The flavor was so good I ate several raw green beans coated in the seasoning. My husband and 4 kids all enjoyed it!

My son who loves spicy did not care for this recipe.  My husband who dislikes spicy or strong flavored food did like the recipe and had second helpings!  I liked it but a bit too much lemon so I'd add less next time which is the only reason I gave it for stars.  The lemon flavor is very strong.  Note: I used bottled lemon juice which may have affected the recipe.

I didn't want the entire meal seasoned the same so... I halved the lemon pepper seasoning for the chicken only. Then I used 4-5 potatoes and cubed them and coated with 1-2 tbsp olive oil and about 1 tsp seasoned salt and baked the potatoes sepately on a cookie sheet. The lemon seasoning sauce was good. Had a slight zing to it.

This was delicious. I used a whole cut up chicken and some extra chicken legs. I lined the roasting pan with aluminum foil, and used a bit more lemon since I had more chicken than the recipe called for.  Fresh oregano and basil from the garden instead of the dried. Very tender and juicy.

This dish was yummy! I did use less seasoning (1 tablespoon instead of 2) and I basted the chicken every 20 minutes or so to create a crispy skin.

I followed this recipe and found it to be very salty. My boys liked it, but I discovered that the Greek seasoning that I used has "salt" as the number one ingredient, so it was it was an inadvertent addition of 2 Tablespoons of salt /herbs, which was way too much salt. Next time (and there will be a next time), I will not add the salt, but will still add the Greek seasoning (or try the lemon herb seasoning). So just a heads up if you use the Greek seasoning,  check the ingredients to see what is in it before using it.. Other than that, it was easy to make and is worth another try. 
*****Update: I've since made the recipe again and used the lemon herb seasoning (has minimal salt)  this time around, cut the pepper in 1/2 and used 2.5 tsp of salt. Before serving, I also cut up the cooked chicken into bite sized pieces and sloshed it around in the remaining sauce. Super delicious. Will definitely be keeping this version around in my dinner rotation.

Great base recipe.  I used 4 tbsp of lemon juice, the suggested amount of olive oil, parsley (no basil on hand), oregano, lemon pepper, onion powder & garlic powder. I eyeballed all seasonings & threw 4 chicken breasts & some quartered red potatoes in a bag & tossed to coat. Very easy & quick! The lemon was not overpowering but gave just the right amount of twang. I took away a star because I think it might have been a bit bland if I hadn't have taken a few liberties but  overall GREAT!

I love this recipe! I did substitute 1 tablespoon Greek seasoning and 1 tablespoon lemon pepper for the 2 tablespoons lemon and herb seasoning. It was a hit with the fam! I will definitely be making this again! I also served a homemade taziki sauce with it.

Wonderful recipe that allows itself to excel with changes. I used 1 lemon not 2. I excluded oregano as it tends to overpower, and instead, added a bay leaf. I used lemon pepper seasoning as well. For the potatoes, used a bag of variety fingerling with 3 bone in chicken breasts. May want to cook green beans a bit longer for addition tenderness. Great, easy recipe.

Fantastic recipe. The chicken was moist and had incredible flavor. A new family favorite! I would add the green beans 5 minutes earlier than recommended. We like them crisp/ tender and they were just a touch too tough.

Used asparagus instead of beans. Also used a garlic infused olive oil.. Like others found it took longer than suggested. Nice easy technique for a one pot meal.

I made this last night. It was a big hit with my family. This recipe is definitely a keeper. I followed recipe exactly as stated. I did not have green beans so I left that part our. I served with roasted cauliflower instead.

We loved this! I did make some changes. Hubby does not like basil so I used rosemary (terrific with potatoes & chicken). I cut back the oregano and rosemary to a tablespoon each and reduced the oil to 1/4 cup. That was plenty. Didn't have new potatoes so chunked up some Yukon Golds, also opted for a salad instead of green beans. I know it isn't quite the same, but a really good recipe is ALWAYS just a guideline for me and this was a good one!

Like the idea but didn't turn out for me.  Needed 20 min more cook time, and the lemony ness was way to intense.  I will be making variations of this dish again with the spice cut in half and the cook time extended.

Wow! What a delicious  and simple to prepare dish! And you can't imagine just how wonderful it smells while cooking. Hubby and I both loved it.  The only change for next time is to use more potatoes and more green beans.

This was AMAZING. Husband and 1.5 yr old and 3 yr old all devoured it. Served with a greek cucumber salad.
Husband said it was a 10/10 ( I agree,) and 3 year old ate a whole leg quarter by herself!

Great flavor! Easy to prepare. Followed the recipe exactly. Next time will add sliced onions in the beginning. Good easily add or sub in parsnips for potatoes, or add carrots.

This recipe made me look like a rock star for this Easter.  My family was looking for an alternative to ham and we chose this recipe.  I only made a few changes like substituting carrots for green beans, using boneless chicken thighs, doubling the recipe, and baking it all in a roasting pan.  It was so moist and tender!

we loved this chicken!
it made the house smell fantastic, it tasted great, it was easy to make and simple to clean up after. The family  was a big fan of the crispy skin on the chicken legs and the heavy spice on the potatoes. only down side was the time it took to bake in the oven.

I loved this recipe! It was delicious  and incredibly easy for the flavor that it had. I used less than half the amount of salt and it didn't seem like it was missing anything! I also used boneless skinless chicken breasts. I didn't feel like making tzatziki sauce or have the ingredients. So instead I mixed dill, garlic powder, salt & pepper into 2% FAGE greek yogurt and it was a delicious /easy substitute.

Super easy. Smells, looks, and tastes amazing. The only change I made was I slightly cut back on salt and pepper. Next time, I will render the fat off the chicken skin, like another reviewer described, but only to make it a little healthier. I used bone-in skin-on chicken thighs

Oh my, is this good!! My kids (6 and 9) request this every chance they get.  We do cut up larger potatoes and use thighs because no one here wants legs. I use the Velata Lemon Garlic Artisan rub instead of lemon seasoning, since food allergies cut down on our spice selections. We've served it multiple times to guests and everyone always wants the recipe. It's baking in the oven now and everyone's mouth is watering!!

Yummy! I halved the oil, lemon and seasonings because I only had 1 lemon, I also added the zest of the lemon because I didn't have the lemon herb spice and used Greek seasoning instead. I am on a low sodium diet and used 1 tsp salt. I had 9 skinless bone in thighs, I baked for 30 minutes, flipped them over then added the green beans and baked for another 15 minutes for 45 minutes total. It was a perfect meal, enjoyed by my family.

I would give this a 5 star rating if I had all the ingredients on hand to make it.  As it was I didn't have lemon herb seasoning, so minced 4 large garlic cloves and used the juice of both lemons, instead.  The spice seemed like a lot to me, so I halved it (only 1 Tbsp each).  Wow.  I asked my picky kids if they were enjoying the chicken.  One said, "Can't talk, must eat."  The other one ate every morsel.  I should say that I cooked legs and thighs (bone in, skin on).   I dunked the pieces in the marinade before putting them in a large roasting pan and then smeared extra on top.  The potatoes I tossed in the residual marinade and put in a separate pan to roast.  My neighbour came to the door shortly before the chicken was due to come out and raved about how good dinner smelled (it smells divine when roasting).  She asked that I send her a link to the recipe.  It's awesome, tasty and so effortless.  A keeper!  Thank you for posting!

This was easy and tasted good. I did cut back on the herbs and spices by half. And I'd only use one lemon next time. It was a bit on the sour side. All in all a really nice dish.

I really like one-pan meals as well, and make this delicious dish at least twice a month.  You can vary the spices to taste, or even to change the cultural influence, but the general idea is simple.

Great recipe! Will make this again. Used thighs and legs, 1 lemon, fresh green beans, and Penzys Greek Seasoning.  Hubby who said he doesn't like Greek Chicken loved it.

I made it for myself, husband, and adult son. We all loved it. easy to put together and really good.  It doesn't taste like a quick week day meal. You could easily serve this to guests.

I was skeptical of this recipe at first  because I love authentic Greek food and worried about the flavors etc. However, this wound up being one of the BEST dishes I have ever cooked! Absolutely delicious. I made some tzatziki sauce to go along with it - OMG. Fantastic!!!!

This was easy and pretty good, but I agree with the other reviews that the lemon can be a bit overpowering. For me, the chicken and potatoes were fantastic but the lemon was too much for the green beans. I would make this again but cook the beans separate from the lemon oil mixture.

My family (who are not chicken fans) asked me to make it again and double it so they can have it for leftovers! I am making it tonight but using chicken breasts (for those family members who don't like dark meat)

I made this and my family loved it. It was great to have it all on one pan, which I lined with foil for easy clean up. I used lemon juice instead of real lemons but it was the only substitution I made. Leftovers were great too. Next time I would like to try it using chicken breast.  This will become a regular in my meal plan.

This was delicious!  I was told it was seriously the best chicken they ever had!  I followed the recipe as stated, but I used chicken thighs instead.  It smoked up, but just disconnect the smoke detector and enjoy!

This dish was too much of a 'one note' flavor on all of the elements.  The taste of combined seasonings was flatter than what I expected.

Super easy... Made my own seasoning with lots of lemon pepper , herb de province and a bit of  celery salt. Shook potatoes I it and spread it over the chicken. Will serve with the potatoes, tzatziki and avocado salad. I butchered five chicken quarters into threes for easy portion control. Delicious!

Very good! I used thighs because that's all I had and frozen string beans that I partially cooked in microwave (to take the chill out)
I did not add pepper because I used lemon pepper (could not find 'lemon herb') I also forgot (thank you Pinot Noir)  to toss green beans in oil mixture BUT with all the juice etc that was already present, I tossed in that after taking out of oven. 
Will be making again. Nice to try something different.

** I accidentally posted a picture of this dish BEFORE it went into the oven and don't know how to delete it :) BUT this dish is SOOO good and makes the house smell great! I've made it many times. Sorry about the raw chicken pic**

Okay….I halfed the lemon, and still toooo much.  I think next time I will use the "concept" but use Italian dressing.  I also used fresh asapargus instead of greens beans.  That was great!  Very 'pretty' dish, just kind of 'boring' in flavor to us.  But I will 'tweek' it because the concept of all in one container is great!!!

This recipe makes for a delicious supper especially when your husband has made it.  We will be definitely be having this again.  He followed the recipe except that he cut the small potatoes in half to better absorb the flavors and added just a little bit of the lemon zest to the whole.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was a hit with the whole family.  I used 2 tablespoons of Italian seasoning instead of the oregano and basil that the recipe called for and it worked out perfectly.  It was voted a keeper by the kids.

I can't  find Lemon herb seasoning or greek seasoning in my store. My large superchain store didnt  help me find these. Or at least the young man helping didn't have a clue. Also the tzatziki sauce.  Any help finding these? We live in Oregon

Simple, few simple ingredients, cheap and most importantly... Delicious. It even has good presentation - my convection oven crisped and browned the chicken and potatoes nicely.

I made this as instructed, but used Greek seasoning instead of the lemon-herb seasoning (as the recipe suggested). I think there should be a note to decrease the salt if using Greek seasoning. The potatoes & chicken were amazing! Great color & fall-off-the-bone tender. My hubby wasn't a fan of the green beans because for some reason it brought the "saltiness" up a notch. I don't always trust his opinion on veggies, because he likes them to be cooked almost to mush, but in this case I think he was right. Note to other cooks: I'd half the salt if using Greek seasoning. Other than that, excellent recipe!

I wanted to post a pic of this because it looked so good but the smell was even better so I dug in before there was any chance of a picture.  I marinated the chicken all day in the mixture and it was so amazing, very flavourful.  This recipe will definitely stay in my permanent rotation.

I made this exactly as the recipe called for.  My family agreed it was a "Do again" recipe.  We all enjoyed the envelope of flavors.  My youngest daughter was unhappy with the  amount of herbs that adhering to her food.  My son, who had seconds and asked for a third helping, thought the lemon flavor was a bit too strong.  I really enjoyed it as presented!

It was very good, I think next time I would cut back on the salt, maybe 1.5 tbls. instead of 2.  But otherwise very good.  Potatoes and green beans still a little crunchy for my taste, but chicken great!  Just hard to time it right so nothing is overcooked or undercooked!

Too salty!  I served with quinoa cooked in low salt chicken broth and cherry tomatoes.  I did not have potatoes or green beans, so left those out.

Fantastic! The entire family loved the combination of spices and tender chicken. Next time, I'll make this with skinless chicken breasts cut into strips. This will add to the amount of chicken for everyone, within the same spice and oil ingredients.
