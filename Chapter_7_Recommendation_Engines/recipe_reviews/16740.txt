I agree with those of the reviewers that found the sauce a bit bland - however I added the recommended garlic powder some seasoning salt about a tbsp of soy sauce and the taste was dramatically improved. I served the gravy over buttermilk biscuits for a vegetarian version of the classic sausage gravy and biscuits breakfast and my boyfriend loved it.

I made this recipe and loved it! The flavor is great! I tried it over steak and with angel hair pasta it was wonderful both ways. This has quickly become my favorite mushroom sauce

i liked this recipe. I used fat free half and half instead of milk and I added some majoram and season salt (initially instead of regular salt). I tasted it as it was simmering and noted that it did taste "floury" as another user stated so I added some kosher salt in addition and it turned out great! I put it on steak and it was really good - I wouldn't recommend it for anything like pasta it is too "gravyish" for that.

As others have said this is a very good base recipe! Mine turned out good after tweaking it a little. I did about 5 TBSP of butter because I doubled the mushrooms added 1 extra clove of garlic 1/2 tsp. garlic salt 1/2 tsp. season salt 1/2 tsp pepper 1/2 tsp basil and the stated amount of onion. I subsituted 1 cup of half and half and 1 cup of chicken stock for the milk. I served on top of steak and red potatoes. The taste turned out great the only downside was it was too thick. I only used 2 TBSP of flour but the sauce still turned out like a thick gravy. Next time I won't add any flour at all. Thanks for this recipe and thanks to all those who gave their suggestions as well!

Okay after reading the little reviews that this recipe received I was hesitant about making it.But I decided to give it a go following the recipe and adding more garlic salt for flavor.I even added another clove of chopped garlic but unfortunately it didn't help.It was thick and pasty and would have been good over chicken fried steak? instead of linguine like I served it.I don't think I'll be making this again...sorry!

So easy to make!!I made this sauce tonight for over meatloaf and boiled potatoes. It was really good except I felt that the basil flavour was a little too strong I think I will cut it in half next time. My husband loved the sauce. I also made one modification substituting beef stock for the milk. Thanks!

Really nice basic recipe and easy to go with so many things. As written and as other reviewers noted it was too bland. I added extra pepper and garlic and basil as well as more mushrooms than called for because we like it chunky.:) Served it over skirt steaks and oven fries and was a hit.

Very bland and tasteless. Not good for pasta without adding some additional ingredients. I added some asiago cheese basil and thyme. Best for heavier types of pasta or ravioli.

This sauce was kind of bland. Also I made the mistake of dumping in the flour all at once which then clumped up. Not a smart thing to do. I would spice this recipe up...it is a good base for a sauce though.

I made this but I changed the amounts and added chicken base. This was what this sauce needed! I also added more mushrooms. Once I tweeked this recipe to my taste it was good. I also feel if you leave your base thinner you could use this as a mushroom soup. I will make this again.

I wanted to surprise the wife with something new and different and this did it! Thanks for the great recipe. My alterations - used 3 cloves of garlic and 1 tablespoon of Basil due to the "bland" comments. It came out pretty good! My wife had it over chicken and I decided to try pasta. I think both dishes were a success though I had to thin the sauce with some milk to make the pasta work - if you do that I think you have a good pasta topping!

This was a good recipe. I made it with Pork Meatballs from this site and served over cooked pasta. I would add a little more spice next time. It was just a little bland but fixable. I will be making this again with a few minor changes.

I made this sauce last night on top of rice with barbecued steaks. It was a extremely simple recipe and turned out really well. I didn't measure anything... just added however much I thought would work and I added some green onions. The taste was absolutely delicious but personally there was something I did not like about the texture. Though it practically melts in your mouth! Overall very tasty!

Fantastic sauce! I made it using a blender to fuse all the ingredients and then poured on top of cooked chicken breasts. Very flavourful!

This recipe does has a floury flavor. I had to add a lot of spices before I would add it to my chicken. It is a good base for your own creativity.

I liked the flavor. I didnt think it was as bland as other reviewers had said i did end up adding 2 extra gloves of garlic and upped the salt by 1/4 t. but that was just personal preference. I used the sauce with stuffed shells. I will be using it again.

We are on a non-dairy diet and this recipe is easily adaptable to that (rice milk). I served it over pasta as a non-dairy alfredo substitute idea and it was good!!

The taste was kinda bland so I added some lemon juice and chili powder which really added a bit more kick to the taste. This also turned out a bit thicker than I usually like my pasta sauces but it would be perfect to serve with chicken or beef and I think it might be better used as a gravy than a sauce.

This was a great sauce but I would not use it for pasta. I used it with mashed potatoes and fried tofo sticks and it was just right. The consistency wouldn't be what you're looking for with a pasta dish.

All in all this is a good base for a sauce but I added some Thyme for extra flavor as well as a dollop of sour cream for extra creaminess. Oh I also added a touch of garlic powder as suggested by other readers.

It was a bit thick for angel hair. double or triple the recipe for a full box of angel hair. add more milk for creaminess. I think linguine would be a better pasta for it. otherwise nice taste.

I really loved this recipe. I ended up not being the only one loving it too. My two year old son is a picky eater. After eating this he liced his lips and said "more". I altered the recipe a bit. I put my season all salt as well as the regular salt it called for garlic powder and a little more minced garlic.

Very good and tasty recipe. Good flavor. I added some beef bouillon maybe 1/2 of it in 1/4 cup of water. No salt let the beef take over. Was really good over spaghetti and chicken.

this was alright... nothing was wrong with it - but it wasn't very flavourful.... i think next time i'd add a lot more flavourings to it - but i'd definitely give it another shot!

This sauce was ok. It was a bit thick for pasta it would be better as a gravey. It was a bit bland so I upped all the spices and it turned out pretty good. I have since made this several times. I think the trick is to slowly add the flour untill you get a nice roux. If you add all of it it will be too thick and grainy.

Like others have stated this is a good foundation for mushroom sauce but definitely needs some doctoring. I followed the suggestions of adding garlic powder and soy sauce and reduced the flour to one tablespoon and it turned out great.

I followed the advice of another reviewer and subbed in 1 cup chicken broth and 1 cup half and half. (I used 1 cup milk with a dash of heavy cream as i was out of half and half). For the flour I just kept adding until it was the right consistency. Utterly delicious!

This turned out pretty good. I followed the suggestions of other reviews and added some garlic powder and seasoning salt to wake up the taste. I used it instead of cream of mushroom soup in the Mushroom Pork Chops recipe and I thought it was much better this way. This one is a keeper.
