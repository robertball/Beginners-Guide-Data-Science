These are tasty, and would go great with a nice cold beer. To be honest, I couldn't really taste the coconut milk, but the spices and lime do come through nicely.

I liked the  new way to prepare kale and will make this again for my family. I reduced the spices so my kids wouldn't say it was too spicy.
