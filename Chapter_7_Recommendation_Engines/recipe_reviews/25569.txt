This cake really could be deadly!  After reading other people's reviews, which said that the cake was dry, I made the following modifications: -Used only 1 7/8 c. flour (if you don't have a 1/8 c. measure, use 3/4 c. plus 2 Tbsp.) -Used 3/4 c. cocoa powder -Used 1/2 c. butter -Added 1/2 c. applesauce  Then when it was cool, I frosted it with the Easy Chocolate Bundt Cake Glaze from this site--it was super delicious!  It makes a great birthday cake!  =D

The first time I made this cake, it was much too dry. So, I doubled the amt.of butter, added an extra egg, and used a bit more sour cream.  I also topped it with a bittersweet chocolate glaze and used half peanut-butter chips and half chocolate chips- magnificent!

Horrible!  This cake was so dry that it was inedible.  I brought it to a party and I was embarrassed.  It ended up in the garbage.  A waste of time and ingredients! Get this recipe off the site.

I thought this recipe was great!  I read the reviews and made some changes.  I doubled the butter, added a 1/2 c. of applesauce and added a little less flour than what the recipe called for.  I also baked it for only 50 minutes.  Very moist... everyone loved it :)

This recipe requires 1/2 cup butter instead of 1/4 cup, 1 cup water with two or 3 teaspoons instant decaf coffee disolved in it instead of 1/2 cup plain water, and 2 cups semisweet MINI chips.  Then it will be great!!!  If you don't like coffee flavor, don't worry.  It is not  strong and just makes the chocolate taste better.

We loved this cake! Taking suggestions from other cook's reviews,I used 3/4c-Smart Balance brand spread INSTEAD of butter; 2c-Raw Sugar (dissolved in the 1/2c water and added w/creamed spread); 3 Eggs; and 1+1/2c-sour cream. I served each slice w/freshly whipped cream and a shake of cinnamon. PERFECT!!

This was AMAZING!  Well, let me explain something first.  I didn't make it with sugar, I made it with Splenda For Baking, since I had people who were on diets and/or diabetic.  I also used fat free sour cream.  It was sooo delicious, and I got such compliments!  I can't wait to try it with sugar and regular sour cream to see if it's better or not.  I will definitely make this many times, and I have already had 2 people ask for the recipe.  Buffy, thanks so much!

I should have read farther down the review list.  I, too, believe this cake is way too dry!  Furthermore, I don't know who can bake this for 60 minutes.  I baked it for 45 minutes and it probably should only have baked for 40 minutes!  I agree with another "rater" for this cake.  It needs extra butter and sour cream.  What a disappointment!

Made some changes as suggested by others: double the butter (1/2 cup), double the water (1 cup), added 1 tsp. instant coffee to water, and had to substitute plain yogurt for sour cream, did not have chocolate chips. All in all, happy with the results and my family loved it. Frosted it with a thin buttercream, allowing it to run down the sides. I would make again.

Made a few changes. 3/4 c butter, 1 1/2 c sour cream, 1 c water with 2 tbsp instant coffee dissolved in it. Whole the cake was baking, I combined 2 c semi sweet chocolate chips, 1 c heavy whipping cream, and 2 tsp vanilla in a microwave safe bowl. Microwave on high for 2 mins. Whisk chocolate mixture together. Let stand about 10 mins and pour over the finished cake. Gorgeous and everyone that has tried it, says it is by far the very best cake they have ever had!!!!

This had mixed reviews due to the crunchy crust it had. The inside was really moist, but the crust was munchy. This is a great cake for a dark chocolate lover vs a milk chocolate lover.

For a low-fat recipe, I substituted 1/4 c. applesauce + 2 tsps. of oil for the butter and (blended) 1 c. 2% fat cottage cheese + 1 tbsp lemon juice + 2 tsp milk for the sour cream.  I didn't read the reviews before about the driness, and just assumed it was the lower-fat substitutions.  I still think the cake turned out great -- not "Death by Chocolate" but a lighter version that still hit the spot for me!

I thought that it was quite delicious. If I had the time I would definitely make it again. But I did add a little more sour cream

I just realized I accidentally used a full cup of butter instead of just doubling the butter to 1/2c.! I also added an extra egg and subbed strong coffee instead of plain water. Even by quadrupling the butter and adding an egg, it turned out a hint dry. It also overflowed the bundt pan while baking and fell apart while trying to take it out of the pan (however, I was able to salvage it for the dinner party). Everyone at the party ate their entire piece of cake but no one said how great it was or asked for seconds. I'd probably try the recipe again (taking care to only double the butter!) and would definitely sub coffee for the water which definitely enhanced the chocolate.

It was a tasty cake, and chocolatey. Fairly easy to make (I didn't have the best sifter for the dry ingredients.) Given that it was made with sour cream, I expected it to be more moist than it was. I felt like I could taste the flour almost more than the chocolate.

My husband LOVES this cake!  It lives up to its name.
I tried following the recipe as it was written, but it seemed extremely thick. So, I added 1/4 c. butter and one egg (as suggested by other reviews).  I then baked the cake for 1 hour and 10 minutes at 350 degrees. It turned out wonderfully!
