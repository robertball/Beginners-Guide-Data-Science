Fantastic recipe! Would've given it a 5 if I didn't find it a bit bland too, so instead of fennel I used my old "cure all" Montreal Steak Spice, on the outside. Perfect!

I cooked this last night and it turned out beautiful and tasted great.  Got wonderful compliments.

I softened the goat cheese and stirred in some fresh rosemary, thyme, parslel, and a couple minced garlic cloves before spreading it onto the spinach.   Also used Lawry's Seasoned Pepper in the flour mixture and put more on the surface before baking.  I think this gave it more of the flavor that some reviewers were missing.  All in all, a wonderful recipe and I'm so glad I found it!!!
(Most of us "tweak" everything a bit......doesn't mean the original wouldn't have been great, too.)

I eat lamb, and this looks amazing.  I paired this with red skin mashed potatoes.  I opted out on the fennel and used rosemary instead.  I'm just not a big fan of fennel seeds.

This recipe provides some very good guidance, but falls short in the flavor department (bland).  I corrected this by using Penzey's lamb seasoning in addition to the salt and pepper.  Loved the spinach & goat cheese filling (I used a peppered goat cheese log from Harley Farms), but I need practice with the whole pounding/rolling process.  I think the flour could also be omitted--it made a weird, hard crust that seems unnecessary.  Thanks for a great idea to get me started!

This was great, but I too had to solve that pesky stuffing problem.  So I took a piece of parchment paper and folded an equal length of foil around the outside of it.  I laid the roast in the pan with the stuffing cut to one side, fat cap up.  Then I oiled the parchment and with the help of the foil--parchment side pressed firmly against the stuffing and meat--molded a shield around the entire exposed cut, which kept the stuffing in pretty effectively without interfering with the roasting process.  Viola!  No leaky stuffing and a lovely, browned roast.

I also cut down the size of this recipe considerably.  Usually, I buy a full, $70 leg of lamb.  I cut up some for stew or tajines, cut big chunks for kabobs, and leave the meat under the fat cap for a stuffed, butterflied roast like this one.  That leaves me a nice bone to roast for broth and a decent amount of scrap meat for stuffed grape leaves.  The only thing that gets thrown out unused is some silver skin.  That overpriced leg of lamb becomes a much more economical cut.  For this cut-down roast, you can use a 4 oz roll of goat cheese and just eyeball the rest.  It should serve 4-6 people generously.  I also roast it on top of halved baby new potatoes tossed with olive oil.  Scrumptious!

this made a beautiful presentation and the temp/time for baking were right on.  Followed the recipe to the letter and it was good lamb but in all needed a little more flavor.  Maybe more herbs, some mint?  more cheese?  peppered crust?  will certainly make again.  thanks!

I would give this 10 stars if I could.  The only thing I did differently was omit the pine nuts.  This was a beautiful presentation and sooo flavorful.  Thank you for an excellent recipe!

I love the concept of the recipe. Think it needs more spices in the center. Easy to make and was  delicious.

WONDERFUL!!  Made this for Easter to RAVES!  I'd recommend it 100%. People asked to take leftovers home and called me to say there were having it for lunch. We made the recipe "as is" and added cornstarch and wine to the lamb dripping to make a sauce.  The lamb was perfect as is.. but the sauce just punched up the flavor. I will make it again! Served with rustic mixed potatoes and asparagus.

Outstanding with some tweaking. To up the flavor I lightly wilted the baby spinach in some olive oil which had been heated with crushed garlic.  I also toasted the pine nuts before putting them on.  I used creole seasoning instead of the other seasoning around the roast but next time I might omit the flour crust entirely as it really didn't enhance the dish.  Everyone enjoyed the flavors and no one said it was bland.

I fixed this on Saturday.  The only thing I added was garlic powder with parsley.  Without a doubt this was the most beautiful roast I have ever made and the lamb is the best I have ever tasted.  It's a keeper, indeed.

Excellent lamb recipe. Easily adapted to gluten free (I used a mix of brown rice flour and potato starch). The sesame oil really adds a nice flavor and the presentation is gorgeous.

Great recipe. I was intimidated at first to try this but I am so glad I did! Especially since I was hosting Easter dinner...   Seasoned all sides of the meat after pounding it out and let it come to almost room temperature before cooking. I only had feta and walnuts instead of goat cheese and pine nuts but I used the same amounts. I had been skeptical that it would cook in only 40 mins (because it looked so thick!) but it took just a few more and was perfectly medium, medium rare. Thank you!

Made this last night and served it with mashed garlic potatoes and baby spinach.  It was very tasty. I used the goat cheese roll suggestion and didn't have any pine nuts so I substituted chopped walnuts, it worked just fine.  My husband who is not a lamb lover thought it was delicious.

I thought this was really good.  I read the reviews about perhaps needing more flavor so I added some of the herbs directly to the meat and filling as well as the stuffing. Don't leave the crusty burnt stuff on the bottom of the pan - it's delicious!

This went over huge, a big hit.  I deboned and butterflied the leg before stabbing and pounding it. for filling I used large leaf spinach, basil, rosemary, (all fresh from our garden) and provolone cheese (we do not care for goat cheese) the rest remained the same.


I do recommend this because the recipe can be varied hundreds of ways!

Great lamb recipe but there must be a typo where it says cooking time is 40 min. I cooked a 5.25 stuffed keg 2&1/2 hrs and took it out at 135’. It was perfect. Figure 15 min/lb for Med rare. I also added a basil pesto and subbed it over the inside and out a jar of oil packed sun dried tomatoes on top of that before layering pine nuts, fennel seeds, spinach and goat cheese.

I used to do leg of lamb on the grill every year for Easter and loved it. This, however, is going to be my new "Go To" recipe. It was a real winner!

I have made this recipe over 15 times since discovering it.  I eventually made a few changes as to my tastes.
No pine nuts.
No cup of flour ... I cut back a little on the pepper, due to my pepper being strong.  I load it with goat cheese and spinach, wrap it in twine, then when it eventually goes in the over, I cover it with the rest of the spinach.   
I add way more oil that one table spoon, 
Sever with Brussels .... one of our favorite dishes.

This was my  first try at  rolled stuffed lamb and it came together much easier than I thought it would.  I would've liked a little stronger flavor from the spices  and will try another time with différent ones or more than the recipe calls for. I would also take it out of the oven a little sooner and let it reach temperature when covered with foil so as not to dry out too much.   Also I didn't have kitchen twine, but used poultry trussing skewers to pin the edges and ends together - worked just fine.
