There wasn't a slice left over from this!  The entire family loved it.  I used pizza dough made in my bread machine, but otherwise, followed the directions exactly.  The only 'head's up' I would give to others trying this recipe, is to wait at least 15 minutes before you slice the pizza.  The sauce is very runny, so you have to give it a few minutes to solidify.  Next time I make it, I'm adding fresh spinach to the mix!  Thanks for sharing this recipe Emking!  :)

What a wonderful pizza this makes! But, to save time I cheated.  I used two prebaked pizza crusts and a jar of my favorite commercial Alfredo Sauce.  One jar was enough for 2 pizzas. I topped the pizzas with chopped red and green peppers, onions, sliced black olives, and shredded mozzarella.  It is a lovely "Why didn't I think of that?" recipe.

Wonderful! I did a few things a bit differently.  For ease I did the dough for the crust in my bread machine, and my dough was a little liquidy so instead of adding more flour I added parmesan cheese.  For the alfredo sauce (because it is so rich) I covered the pizza with a little sauce and then put the rest out for dipping.  I put spinich, green onion and chicken on for toppings. Thanks Emking for a great recipe.

This pizza was AMAZING! I followed the recipe exactly as it read, except I added some extra garlic powder to the alfredo sauce. Yummy! Definitely a keeper.

My daughter and I both love pizza, so I make this almost three times a month. I admit I cheat on the dough and use the canned ones at the store. But I do prepare the alfredo sauce exactly as written. The sauce is so good it's worth the time and effort. I also play around with the toppings. Excellent pizza!

This was a great recipe.  The kids loved it. Even my one year old who I can't get to eat anything gobbled it up.  I used a different crust recipe off this site and it worked well.  Will do again.

Burnt to a crisp. Charred. I had it on 450 degrees, not for 35 minutes, but only for 30. Hard as a rock, black, and like I said, charred.

Wow! My family loved this. My husband only eats cheese pizza so he did not want to try it. Well it was what I made for dinner so I told him to eat or cook something else. Well he ended up loving it and eating the left overs for lunch. I did not make the crust I used Boboli.

We used our own crust because we like thin crust.  But I give the sauce a 5 starts because it's incredible.  We added black olives then cut up and scattered costco's marianated artichoke hearts all over the pizza before we put the cheese on it.  Boy did it ever taste like a gormet pizza!

I used this just for the sauce and made Jay's Signature Pizza Crust (highly recommended).  If you are afraid of the huge number of fat grams in this like I was, I suggest substituting lowfat milk for the heavy cream and use neufatchel cream cheese.  Also, I scaled the sauce recipe in half and had plenty for one pizza.  I made two pizzas, one with the white sauce and another with traditional red pizza sauce with just a bit of the white sauce drizzled over.  Mmmm, fantastic result!  I topped the white pizza with some sauteed chicken with Italian seasoning, sliced mushrooms, thinly sliced onion, and of course, shredded mozzarella.  While still not entirely lowfat, I'm sure it reduced it by quite a bit and the result was very good.

I used my own crust recipe so only 4 starts.... the sauce is worth 5 starts.  It is kind of scary that this sauce is so easy and soooooo good!  Now we do not have to out to Olive Garden for Alfredo, this one is just as good!

The only complaint I would have was that the crust wasn't very impressive in this recipe. The alfredo sauce however IS! It was so good! We just made a plain cheese one and it was THE BEST tasting pizza EVER! Though again, when you get to the part without the sauce it was just okay. I might find a better crust recipe but keep this sauce recipe for sure!

now i did use my own dough, but the sauce is amazing. better than any Alfredo sauce I've ever had on pizza. definately worth the effort to make your own sauce. i used a jar alredo sauce once and the pizza was gross. if it's not already implied you do have to use real freshly grated Parmesan cheese, not the stuff that's prepackaged grated(duh, right?)...

This recipe is AMAZING!!  Its easy and so yummy!  The only thing I do different is add lots more cheese (I am from WI, we love our cheese! :) and add pepperoni and veggies.  It never lasts long when I make this!

This was super good! My family loved the flavor of the sauce and cheese. I took it a step further, and added the chicken recipe from "lighthousekeeper's" Chicken Alfredo Pizza. The only thing I would change, is the dough was so fluffy and thick (I may have let it rise too long though), perhaps a less 'deep dish' dough would be better. A dash of salt would help. Thanks for the recipe!

This was PERFECT.  I had a ready-made pizza crust and was looking for a white sauce recipe, and this was the taste I've been looking for for a few years now!  I even had to substitute with milk, since I didn't have cream on hand, and I just used a little less to keep the consistency consistent. 
I added fresh basil and sauteed onions, since we like them.   Thanks so much for sharing!

I wanted to absolutely love this.  I did love the sauce.  I was not completely content with the crust.  I tried it twice tweaking it the second time(crust) and it still was not quite right.  I would reccomend the topping for the pizza but maybe find a better crust.

This is an excellent deep dish recipe!  I made the crust according to the recipe, but topped it as follows:
mozarella cheese (bottom layer)
spinach & basil (middle)
spaghetti sauce (top layer)
It was phenomenal!!!  You could easily use any traditional pizza toppings.  My husband and dinner guest said it was the best pizza they had ever eaten.  Thanks for the fantastic recipe.

The Alfredo sauce was amazing.  I used margarine because that was all I had and it was ok, but I would recommend using butter.  I didn't have a deep dish pizza pan but I used and 8x8 baking dish and it worked perfectly.  I also fried some chicken in garlic and onion powder and put that in there.  One of the better recipes I've tried.

Followed the recipe, with the exception of making my own recipe pie crust.  I baked the crust for 10 minutes before putting on the topping to make sure the crust wouldn't go soggy.  I halved the topping ingredients for one pizza and am glad I did as there was still some loss over the sides while baking.  Absolutely delicious, great cheesy flavor, easy topping to put together.  Will definitely be making this again and  this from a person who would normally consider peperoni pizza the only pizza worth eating!

I didn't plan on making a deep dish because I don't make homemade dough, I just wanted to make the sauce for my french bread pizza. This is a great sauce base.

We did not like the crust, thus the low score. HOWEVER, the sauce is great! I've made it twice. This might be a given, but it is much better with "fresh" parmesan you buy in the bag in the dairy section, as opposed to the grated powder stuff in the green cylinders. Definite difference in texture.

I only made the sauce from this recipe and I found it to be very runny.  The flavor was great, but I need to add a lot of flour to thicken the sauce.

This was a hit with my roommates, but I won't be making it again any time soon...it's really unhealthy. The dough was a insanely sticky with just two cups of flour, so I added another half cup or so and everything worked out.  Overall though, good recipe!

I have tossed my other white pizza recipe!  I used my own home-made crust and followed the directions to a T.  I topped the pizza only with fresh tomatoes and ground pepper.  This was exceptional!

Great white sauce for pizza!!  I made minimal changes to the sauce, and they were mostly flavor based.  I used Romano cheese instead of Parmesan, since we prefer the sharper taste, and I used 1 tbsp. of fresh minced garlic instead of the garlic powder.  Finally, I added just a bit of flour to thicken the sauce as others had recommended, with no taste impact.  I topped the pizza with pre-cooked salad shrimp and sauteed bay scallops for a seafood pizza.  Will definitly make this my white sauce for pizza recipe!  In the future though, I will half the sauce, since I thought it was enough for 2 pizzas.  Next time we plan on trying it with pulled chicken, diced roma tomatoes, and green onions to try and recreate Papa Murphy's Garlic Chicken pizza.  I can't rate the pizza dough, since I used my own bread machine pizza dough recipe.

If I may add to the praise, this is a fantastic recipe.  I used my own dough recipe and made two pizzas, one with the given alfredo recipe and one with a quality store brand alfredo.  Both were tasty, but the homemade recipe definitely won the family taste test.  Used fresh grated parmesan, totally worth it.  I also added some crumbled feta to half the pizza for the heck of it. That knocked this one right out of the park.  Pair it with you favorite crisp summer ale and you will be one happy camper.

This sauce is amazing.  Didn't make the crust.  Didn't have the heavy cream so I used half and half.  Topped my pizza with sliced fresh tomatoes.  Wonderful!  Will DEFINITELY make again.

I have to say after reading the rewiews, I had high expectations, but this wasn't a hit in our house. I made it as is, the crust was my concern as per various reviews, wasn't bad, just didn't taste much and was rather oily. The sauce in itself wasn't bad either, I guess we're just not used to eating such rich foods. I toped it with grilled chicken, mushrooms, spinach and little bits of cooked bacon.... Overall, it was ok.

Makes a wonderfully crispy and delicious crust. Dough will be soft and sticky.  Roll dough in a small amount of flour before shaping into ball and placing in bowl. If you add too much flour, it will effect the quality of the crust. I baked the crust until light brown before adding toppings (about 5-10 minutes), then baked for an additional 10-15 minutes, until dark brown and crispy. If using for thin crust pizza, you can skip the second rising. I have tried a number of recipes for pizza dough, and this one is the best! The baking time, depends on the desired doneness. Pizza requires a watchful eye so that it isn't overbaked.  Quick , easy, and delicious alfredo sauce. Be sure to use fresh parmesan cheese, or the sauce will be too salty. Great recipe!

For anyone who gave this low reviews, I am not sure why. This came out really great. I love the sauce, I think I am going to make the dough into bread sticks the next time and dip in the sauce, just like at Olive Garden. I will add Italian Seasoning and Garlic Powder to the dough just for flavor, and maybe also some grated Parmesan Cheese just to give it a little something more. Love this recipe. Make sure you use Fresh Grated Parmesan NOT the stuff in the container.

Sooo yummy!! I actually didn't use the crust recipe within this recipe. I used "Jay's Signature pizza crust" instead, and everything came together perfectly! I added chicken, and I think next time I'll add spinach and tomatoes! Mmmm...

this was so good. but it was runny at first so i just used it as a dipping sauce for some homemade bread sticks i made from a pizza dough recipe.i just made the dough, rolled logs out of the dough place them on a cookie sheet let rest/rise for another hour and baked then when 2-3 min are left brush w/ butter and top w parm. cheese and mrs. dash and continue to bake. this sauce was to die for!! compares to the white dipping/alfredo sauce at olive garden. the sauce did thicken as the night went on.

I used this recipe for the dough.  Perhaps it's because this is the first pizza I've ever made from scratch, but I followed instructions as is and it turned out unsatisfactory.  The dough didn't seem like pizza dough, but rather bread dough.  It also rose much higher than expected while baking, and so it ended up tasting like bread with a bit of sauce on it.  I also feel that 35 minutes in the oven is way too long; the edges of my pizza were too crisp (to the point I had to struggle to cut it).  My toppings were burnt as well.  Also, the flavor wasn't impressive; too bland.  Sorry, it just didn't work out as expected. :(

My husband and I loved the sauce and toppings (I used chicken, spinach and diced tomatoes) but did not care for the crust. I will make this again but with a different crust recipe. A very nice change of pace.

EXCELLENT! Loved the sauce! Yes, cooking it for 15 mins was well worth it! I did cheat and bought ready made dough. Topped it with cooked chicken, fresh garlic, fresh spinach and instead of putting garlic powder in the sauce, I used fresh garlic and I actually forgot to put the moz cheese in the sauce and it still was so yuummmmy! After baking it, I sprinkled fresh basil on top and had a great glass of wine with it! Soooooooo good! Thanks for a gread alfredo recipe!!!

I cheated and used a premade pizza crust but the sauce is delicious.  I had leftover so the next day I heated it up and put it over pasta with sauteed mushrooms and it was even better! For sure a recipe to keep!

Yum! The crust was super easy and tasted great. The sauce was good too, but it turned slightly chalky when baked on the pizza. I added roasted broccoli, a sliced red bell pepper, and a chopped fresh tomato.

We did use a different crust, but regardless the sauce would make up for anything! This was so amazing and we've made it several times already. The sauce is runny and made our slices difficult to eat, so it is easier to wait a while to let it solidify. Leftovers were delicious. It also made a LOT of sauce (since we didn't make it deep dish), but I would never cut this recipe down because I would gladly use the remaining sauce on some pasta, or even just eat it by itself!

I absolutely loved the alfredo sauce, It was delicious, mmmmmm, I ended up eating the leftover sauce with corn bread. I'm giving this 4* since my family liked this pizza. I can't say the same though. Topped with spinach and sliced onions... maybe I should try different toppins next time. Thank you :)

This was a very tasty recipe.  Like others, I used a prepared pizza crust, but I did make the sauce.  I thought it was easy.  It was a bit oily after baking, and I had to wipe it off with a paper towel.  I recommend it!

I gave this a one star rating because of the dough. I only used this recipe for the deep dish dough recipe and it was BAD! My family politely ate it. It really needed some salt for one thing. Second problem was that it needed more flour. It never really crisped up to the point you could pick it up to eat it. It was not because I did not cook it long enough because I cooked it longer then it called for. Long and short of it is use some other dough recipe and it will save you from the wasted trouble.

My family loved this pizza.  I used the recipe Pizza Crust for Bread Machine  SUBMITTED BY: Marian Collins from all recipes.  I made one pizza in a deep glass baking dish, added chicken and precooked onions and peppers.  I used a 15 ounce jar of bought roasted red pepper alfredo sauce and about half the cheese called for. This came out perfect on the first try.

Just used the dough recipe. I made the dough in my bread machine on the dough/pasta setting then second rise in the pan as directed. I used olive oil as another reviewer suggested and also agree with other reviewers that 2 cups of flour was not enough. I ended up adding a couple more small handfuls until the dough didn't stick to the sides of the bread machine. My 12" cast iron skillet worked perfectly as a pizza pan.  I par baked the dough for 5 minutes or so because I was afraid with all my toppings, the bottom crust wouldn't get crunchy but in the end, I'm not sure that was necessary. I just topped with traditional toppings. Will use this recipe again.

I was looking for a basic, cheesy sauce to make a veggie pizza.  Although I haven't made the entire recipe, the sauce from this recipe is now a favorite of ours.  It's easy.. I added some garlic, fresh basil.. divine.

THIS WAS SO GOOD! I cheated and bought premade crust, but the alfredo sauce was so good! I boiled some chicken tenderloins, cut them up and sauted them for a few seconds with some garlic salt and Italian seasoning. I also cut up some green onions and threw them on the pizza too. The crusts I bought came with two pizzas, so I made enough sauce and chicken for both. We ate one last night and the other is in the fridge waiting to be eaten tonight - MUST TRY THIS DISH!

OMG!!! This is sooo amazingly good! It does take a while for the cream to be done, and I was not so patient to wait for it to get browned on low heat, so I had the heat on Medium, medium-High. Still never got browned, but I thought it was ready and used it after it was thick enough. I made the mistake of adding a whole cream cheese block!!!! Just noticed the mistake today, but it still came out incredible! So creamy and flavorful. I topped with brocoli florets and red bell peppers. Used cheddar cheese instead of Mozzarella, cuz I didn't have any. Used only half the alfredo cream on the pizza, and used Pizza dough I from this site. So much faster thank other doughs, and comes out perfect each time. (Added some milk to make it more liquid cuz of the cream cheese content!)to the other half of the sauce and added it to cooked fettuccine. Added a can of tuna, and the rest of brocoli and peppers that I roasted with some salt and olive oil first(450 degrees). Voila! Fettuccine alfredo. Heavenly!! 2 dishes in one!! My son went gaga over these...so did I lol! Thanks for this recipe!

We had a family pizza night, and this was my favorite, as well as my husbands, so much so, he wants me to get more deep dish pizza pans so that I can make more. The crust is just to die for, not to mention extremely, extremely easy to make.

This sauce is simply the most delicious alfredo I've ever had!  It's easy to make and I use it on pizza (I use store bought crust to save time)as well as on pasta with chicken and/or shrimp.  Devine!

This was a big hit at supper last night. My sauce ended up being a little runny, so next time I might thicken it with a little flour. I also sauteed some chicken breasts in oil and chopped it up fine and added it to the pizza. My family really loved it. And it was quite easy!

Really yummy!  We used a refigerated pizza dough, baked for 8 minutes, then topped with the alfredo, sauteed mushrooms, spinach, tomato, and olives.  Baked for another 10 minutes and letit sit to set.  Delicious and we will make it again for sure!

I had already mixed up a double batch of Quick and Easy Pizza by Chef Rider, but then I noticed this recipe. I mixed up one recipe of the dough. I always like to eat a little raw dough and when I did, it tasted very bland (as others have commented) so I added some salt and garlic salt to the dough.  

I love the cream cheese alfredo sauce...I often make Quick and Easy Afredo Sauce by Dawn Carter (I guess I like things "quick and easy").

I had never eaten deep dish pizza before, and I found I prefer regular. It was just too much crust. I loved the alfredo sauce until it was baked. I didn't care for it baked. All in all, this pizza just wasn't a big hit with me or my family.

I didn't add any toppings except the mozzarella cheese because I wanted to make it exactly as written the first time. I added extra flour but as a bread baker, I know you usually do add more flour as needed. And I did add salt.

I only made the sauce (I used the Jay's Signature Pizza Crust from this site) but it was so good! It was very rich and tasted like restaurant alfredo.  I added chicken to the pizza and it was great! Spinach, onions, and red pepper might be good too.

I made this for a halloween party--I wanted all the food to be black or white.  I used a boxed mix for the pizza crust which worked great except it puffed up quite a bit when I cooked it so I would prick it with a fork next time.  I spelled out "Boo" with the olives and it was a wavy Boo by the time it was done.  Make sure you have a deep enough pan to handle all the sauce too.  It tasted great!

I did not even try the crust because of some of the reviews and just bought the store crust.  It saved time as well.  So that is why I am only giving this 4 stars.  If I was just reviewing the alfredo sauce I would give it 5!  It was awesome!!  I boiled some chicken breast and cut it up, then mixed it with the alfredo which we spread on the pizza crust.  We topped that with fresh spinach and sliced tomatoes, then mozz.  So, so good.

We didn't have a deep dish pizza pan, so I had to go to the grocery store and buy 2 pre-made crusts (to hold all the toppings!).
This pizza was amazing. Even my teenage brother had to admit it was good!

I used only the crust recipe here, and it was really good. I par-baked the crust (in an oiled deep dish pan, on top of a hot stone, bottom rack of oven) for 10 minutes before adding toppings to complete baking. My only concern was that the 2 cups of flour called for just didn't do it! Both times I've made it, I've had to use 2 3/4 - 3 cups of flour in order to make it remotely workable.

i cheated and bought a pizza dough from the bakery. i made the alfredo sauce, it was so good. i par-baked the crust, then topped it with the sauce,and some left-over chicken meatballs. then mozzarella cheese. baked it just untill the cheese started to brown a little. let it cool slightly before you cut it, otherwise the sauce runs.

OMG!  This is so so so very scrumptious! I made it according to the recipe but cooked it 25 minutes.  Don't know if my oven is a little hot but it was perfect.  I threw some ham, chopped fresh spinach and diced roma tomatoes on top.  It couldn't have been better.

The only part of this recipe I used was the sauce part. I really enjoyed it. Loved the texture. I love garlic so I added quite a bit of fresh minced garlic, around 3-4 cloves and it made it fantastic!

This was a delicious Pizza! I made some changes though. Due to some complaints about the crust, I use a 1/4 cup of Olive oil instead of Vegetable oil. And also I added a tbsp. of honey with a dash of salt.
I saute' some chicken, red onion,and 2 tbsp. honey. I put that on the top with some cooked spinach.It came out so Delicious! Hope you Like it!

We're giving this 4 stars because the crust is bland, and needs something. Garlic, maybe? The sauce, however, is DELICIOUS! It's a great recipe, it just needs a little something extra.
