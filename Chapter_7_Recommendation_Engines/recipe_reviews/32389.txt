Made this for a baby shower and everyone loved it.  I used only 1 1/2 cups of sugar and it was still plenty sweet.  
This recipe makes 18 cups of liquid, so be sure to use a REALLY large bowl.  My largest bowl holds only 16 cups, so I mixed together everything except the last 3 cups of water and then added 1 cup of water per container after I had divided the mixture among the 3 containers.

My family loves this punch.  Freeze in smaller quantities and it's a quick something to drink that is much healthier than pop!

The only problem with this punch was that our glasses were too small!  This was a hit at my sister's bridal shower yesterday.  I added a frozen mold of strawberries and blueberries in 1/2 pineapple juice and 1/2 water.  Out of this world!  This is a new family favorite...thanks for sharing the recipe!

This is a delightful punch. Occasionally I make an alcoholic version by substituting champagne for ginger ale. I use three .75 liters of champagne instead of three liters of ginger ale. It's delicious.

Although I'm not crazy about banana flavor in my punch, when I served this at a reception at church, everyone loved it. When I was trying to refill the bowl, people were barely containing their impatience to get to the slushy bits. :)  I put mine in shallow containers to freeze. After letting the frozen containers thaw about 2-3 hours, I took a knife and sliced through the slush to make smaller pieces so everyone could get some of the slush in their cup.

I made this punch for my three year old's birthday party.  It was a little too acidic.  The kids drank it but it is not something I'll make again in the future.

This recipe is awesome! My mom discovered it around Christmas and has been making it for all our family get togethers ever since! It is just the right mixture of sweet and tart - with a zing added from the bubbly ginger ale! Tropical, Icy, Delicious!

I made this for my Daught-in-law's baby shower, and EVERYBODY LOVED it!!! Very refreshing and not too sweet. I also put it into 2 gallon size ziplocs and froze them flat. I made them 3 weeks ahead since I had so many other things I had to make, etc...it was perfect! Will definately make again!

Made this for a baby shower and it was a big hit.  Like others, I only used 1-1/2 cups of sugar. I made a double-batch and served one but when more was needed, I pulled one bag out of the freezer for about 20 minutes and then kneeded it a bit and added it to the bowl with a litre of ginger ale.

Very delicious.  I made this for a block party but served it a little different.  I kept the slush frozen in a container and in a small ice chest with an ice cream scooper.  With a note of directions: "Scoop slush into cup, pour in ginerale."  Like a rootbeer float.  It kept the flies out of the punch bowl  while maintaining a refreshing, cool drink.

I made this for a candle party that I was hosting.  It was a huge hit!!!  I had ginger ale and lemon lime soda.  But for the more adventurous I had sparkling wine to top it with or vodka with the ginger ale and lemon lime.  I had VERY successful sales that day. :)

very simple!  I made it this 4th of July and it was a huge hit!  I took the advice of other reviewers and decreased the sugar to 1 1/2 cups.  I was afraid that since the recipe called for that much pineapple juice, it might be a little sweet and when beverages are too sweet I do not find them thirst quenching. Had no problem following the directions as stated... everything mixed well together.  I froze in three unequal parts, which did not seem to matter. Makes tons, so be prepared. :)

You definitely would not miss the sugar if you reduced it by a cup or so.  Served this at a luau-themed party and we mixed it with coconut rum, everyone was crazy for it. I get requests to bring "the punch" to events all the time, now!

I served this today for my family's Easter celebration and it was a great big hit!  Took advice from previous reviews to cut sugar to 1-1/2 cups and also to boil the sugar in the water (make sure to lid the pot so you don't lose water!) and both were good moves.  I found that the big fruit juice block was a bit unruly in the ginger ale with the first batch I served, so when I added the next third I put the frozen juice into a blender in large chunks with some ginger ale before adding it to the punch bowl.  This was much nicer than trying to chop it up right in the punch bowl and made a nice frothy slush.  Delicious!

I have a sweet tooth, but this is a perfect blend of tart and sweet!  The banana really adds to it.  Lemon-lime soda works great instead of the ginger ale.  Also orange sherbet floating on top tastes great!

It was a hit! I wasn't too strict about the block of slush to the one bottle of gingerale, I just did what felt right, and it was delicious!  One family member said she normally didn't even like bananas but she really liked the punch!  I used empty coffee cans (cleaned of course) to freeze the punch in.  It made about 5 of these size (I actually improvised for the last 2 because i only had 3 cans but that's besides the point.  Try this out! It's great!

My mom used to make this 30 odd years ago. I make this in the summer and it is always a success. I get requests for it all the time. But what I do is feeze it in the buckets or a large bowl and take it out of the freezer about a half hour before serving and have an ice cream scoop handy. People put a scoop of slush in a cup and then fill the rest with 7-Up, Ginger Ale or wine.  I usually make it with splenda.

I make this recipe for holidays and other gathers or parties, and always get a TON of compliments.  One thing I do differently is boil the sugar in water first, then add the other ingredients.  Freeze for a day or two, then take it out, put in the punch bowl with ginger ale and break apart with a fork for a nice slushy texture.  That way you don't get the gritty taste of sugar either!

This was so delicious! We cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and it was perfectly sweet. We also, because of space, left out a cup of water and it was still really good!

This is a great base for smoothies as well! Just keep this mix in the fridge and throw in and two frozen fruits (like a banana and a peach) - Soooo good!

Excellent punch!  I made this for a party and had almost none left over.  I agree with previous reviewers about the sugar - nowhere near 3 cups is required, it's quite sweet enough with 1 1/2!

This was a hit at our baby shower! I floated sliced oranges and lemons in a punch bowl. This makes a TON, so plan on saving a quart bag in your freezer for another use later!

Just tried this punch and thought it was quite yummy!  I didn't add any extra sugar and it was perfectly sweet for me!  I also used pink lemonade concentrate.

I had way too many bananas that were going bad and a Christmas dinner around the corner, so I whipped this up and everybody is asking me for this recipe!

We all loved it! So refreshing and different. My friend told me how good this recipe was and I waited a year to try it out. I'm kicking myself now. The only thing I did different was to only use 1 2/3 cup sugar, because punch has a tendency to get to sweet. We will definitely be having this at our next party.

I tried this recipe at a baby shower this past weekend. It was definitely a big hit.  I followd the exact recipe given. When I froze the mixture I used gallon size ziplock bags but only filled them up 3/4 full.  I took the bags out of the freezer about 2 hours before the shower and added 1 1/2 liters of gingerale to each block that I placed in the punch bowl.

Made this punch for my daughter's graduation a few years ago. Everyone raved over it.  We also make the adult version for the summer by adding coconut flavored rum - approx. 3 cups - and decreasing the water.  Bring on the heat!

This is now my most requested punch recipe.  I have made it many times over the last few years.  It is always a hit, although I agree with a previous reviewer that it isn't really a kids punch.  We always scoop the slush into individual cups and then fill them with the ginger ale instead of making a huge bowl at a time.

This punch is the best!!!  We make it for every party we have!  It's a great hit.  I follow the recipe exactly and it turns out perfect every time.  The best thing is you can make this weeks in advance.  So just a couple days before the party or big event that's one less thing you have to do.  Unlike many of the other punches where you have to mix the frozen concentrates with 3 cans of water, add frozen yogurt then add your 2 liter of pop... plus you probably have to do a few refills during the party... this recipe eliminates that hassle and allows you to enjoy your party to the max!!  All you have to do is dump one container of your already frozen, ready to go slush into the punch bowl, add your ginger ale and your ready to serve.  It's so quick, easy, and delicious!  My parties wouldn't be parties with out that!  We love this recipe!!!  Thank you!

Froze some in ice cube trays and freezer bags.  Microwaved bags to just-slightly-softened stage and then used potato masher to create slush.  Makes enough for several small parties.  Good in lemon-lime sodas and other sparkling beverages.  You can add fresh fruit to the glass for a pretty presentation.

I originally got this recipe from my grandmother. This is hands down the best punch I have ever had. Always a hit at our parties, and it always all goes (even though everyone is usually drinking alcohol too). I get countless compliments on it.

I have been making this punch for parties years and am finally taking the time to review it.  It is absolutely delightful and people always ask for the recipe.  I once served it at a bridal shower for my sister and then made it a couple years later at her baby shower and some of the guests from the bridal shower remembered it at her baby shower.  That's how good it is!  It is worth the time of blending and freezing to make your own "sherbert".  Say bye bye to store bought sherbert and ginger ale in your punch bowl!

My mom used to make this when I was growing up - people often asked for the recipe, but she always called it her "secret recipe" - mom lives overseas now, but so glad someone else knew her secret. This is without fail one of the easiest, most delicious, most versatile punch mixes to make. Perfect for entertaining.

Made it for a birthday party. All the kids liked it. It went so fast I didn't bother freezing it. The concentrates were frozen, after all. I did half the ginger ale, due to space, and half the pineapple juice because the birthday boy wasn't a pineapple fan. Easy. It's a keeper. An adult version would likely be good with rum.

I skipped the sugar completely and it was plenty sweet. With all the sweet juice concentrates, I couldn't imagine adding more sugar. We added rum for those who wanted it and everyone was happy!

Haven't made recently, but used to make it every summer in the 90s. EXCEPT made it with a cup or two of rum or vodka - this kept it slushy in the freezer, so it can be served any time, just spoon into your glass, and top up with 7up or ginger ale.

I had made this about 30 years ago for parties and it was always a big hit. Lost the recipe and was so happy to find it here.  Made it for a bridal shower. Had to change the lemonade for limeade as I have developed an allergy to lemons.  Still a big hit. In fact I thought it was even better with the limeade.  Seemed to add a bit more zip.  A number of people added a splash of champagne to their punch.

Yep This is a tasty punch - and seriously consider just not adding the extra sugar. I've made this for several graduations and other gatherings and 1 time I forgot to add the extra sugar - think about the other ingredients - there is plenty of sweetness without it and I haven't added the sugar since - Sometimes add 2 lbs of strawberries when I have them. Freeze in smaller containers or zip lock bags to make punch bowl size portions, but plan to need to to refresh often as it goes fast.

I have made this punch for most of my kids' weddings and church banquets.   It is an incredible crowd pleaser.

Cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups as other reviews suggested.  Serving is easy as it needs no ice.
