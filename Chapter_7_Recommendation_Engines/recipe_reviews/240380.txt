I've never bought Hormel Chili before and was a bit nervous about trying it but I was happily surprised! These nachos were easy to make and delicious. The only thing I didn't add were the black olives because i'm not a fan. I think this will make for an easy family fun night food!

Great idea to make nachos with chili rather than refried beans. I used leftover homemade chili.

I made this recipe tonight for a quick dinner.  It was very good!  I  have to admit, I wasn't expecting it to be as tasty as it was!  I  made it as written except for the black olives and jalapeño only because I didn't have them in my pantry.  The next time I  make it, I  will make sure to have them on hand.
One of my favorite things about this recipe was mixing the tomatoes, cilantro, and onion in fresh lime juice. I think it brought a beautiful, bright, freshness that I will continue to use in other recipes. 
This is a dish I will be making again.

I made the Super Loaded Chili Potato Skins last night and had just a little bit of the Hormel chili left over. I wanted to scale down this nacho recipe for only one person today, so I used all the ingredients listed but didn't measure. I questioned the use of chili with beans, but man, I shouldn't have! These nachos were really good! I would definitely make these again and even for company!

Great way to use up the uneaten nachos and salsa from Mexican takeout! We keep Hormel chili without beans on hand for chili cheese dogs, so I used that. I added a cup of fresh salsa plus 2 fresh tomatoes to use up what was on hand. Outstanding recipe! Easier and tastier than many loaded nacho recipes I’ve tried.

These were so good I could not stop eating them. They were such a huge hit we were all fighting over them. My kids would have preferred that I leave off the tomato and onion but I loved it as is!

Hormel has done it again! Chili nachos are a big hit in this house! I omitted the onion, cilantro, and olives by request. The chili really shined through great! Eat them right out of the oven or the tortillas will get soft.

Came together rather quickly. I'm not much of a fan of canned chili so not sure I would use it again for this recipe.

My husband had fun helping me make these (he doesn't cook), and he loved them! They were a great late night meal for the two of us. I didn't have a lime, so I had to use lemon juice, which was fine. The fresh tomato mixture was very good baked on the nachos. The only thing I would do differently next time is to bake the nachos for 10 min, then add the cheese to the top. I would like the cheese more "melty" than baked on. I served with sour cream and sliced avocado. Yum!  I've never purchased canned chili before, but DH said I need to keep a can of this around for when I'm not home to make him dinner next time! LOL

Love Hormel chili and this was so quick and easy! Will make again and again! Serve extra chips on the side because the chips can get soggy.....all in all...excellent!

This was delicious! I made it as written except I used Hormel's 'no bean' chili. I love the fresh flavor of the raw tomatoes and onions with the Hormel chili nachos. This was so quick and easy to make. It was difficult to stop eating this, so I think I'll double the recipe next time.
