people quit reviewing when you haven't freaking made the darn recipe!  you skew the rating when you do this.  frankly, I don't care that YOU think there is too much bacon in the recipe.  If I (or anyone else)  wants to add a pull pound of bacon I can.    My only addition was to add a bit of fresh thyme to the cabbage as it cooked.  I like thyme with sauted mushrooms and we both thought it was good with the cabbage.  I served mashed red potatoes--reminded me a variation on Colcannon which we love.

There's no such thing as too much bacon
And that's a fact

Can't imagine using a pound of bacon for a head of cabbage. That said, cabbage cooked with bacon is an old classic, consistently popular because it's delicious - no doubt because of the bacon!  So... cut waaaay back on the bacon, add some minced garlic, and we've got something pretty good here.

Not usually a fan of cabbage, but I really liked this.  I also added in lentils.

Made as directed on here but only used 1/2 the bacon as that's all I had left from making it for breakfast, and gosh, I was swayed by a review that perhaps 1 pound was just over the top....
We all liked it (my son tolerated it - so picky, ugh), but I'd add a little more seasoning (garlic to start) next time.  Tonight I'll reheat and add fresh chopped Italian parsley on top.  
And,  I could totally see adding the whole pound of bacon.  Not all bacon is created equal, but just like the poor egg got unjustly misaligned for so long, so did bacon.  Enjoy your bacon !  When I told my 92 year old mom about making this her first reply was, "yum!".
Easy recipe.

This is 99% perfect!  I added about 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes to the bacon fat and then followed your recipe exactly.  Thanks, this will be a regular dish around here.

We absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE fried cabbage with bacon. But I had never tried frying it with onion and the mushrooms. (Not sure why I've never thought of adding the onions, cuz it just doesn't get much better than bacon and onion fried together for any recipe. LOL) I had a can of portabella and crimini mushrooms, so just went with that instead of the fresh mushrooms, and let me tell you....it was AMAZING!!!! So.....this year for St. Patty's Day, gonna do the corned beef in the crockpot with potatoes and carrots, and THIS fried cabbage recipe (with those canned mushrooms I mentioned above) on the side instead of in the crock with the rest of the stuff. AND.....thinking of doing homemade cheddar bay biscuits with it instead of the soda bread.

I liked it since I love mushrooms and cabbage. I could have put more mushrooms in it. The bacon was a nice addition.

My kids have loved this since they were little and they love it even more when I leave out the mushrooms and add cottage cheese. I cook the cabbage low and slow.

I made this with a pound of cooked elbow macaroni, and 1/2 lb of bacon. Delicious and a more complete meal, I think.

Really, really easy to make.  I bought the cabbage in a bag, the mushrooms already sliced.  All I had to do was cut the bacon and onion.   I started bacon, then added onion and mushrooms.  When it cooked down a bit, I added the cabbage.  Then let it cook slowly (low flame) until done.  Added salt/pepper.   One word review:  DELICIOUS!

Just made this for my family of eight. Everyone loved it and cleaned it up. I did not use the entire cabbage head, but could have! Bagged part I a quart bag. I cooked the onions five minutes first, then added the rest and cooked fifteen minutes.

Whoever said this was fatening, doesn't know much about carbs.  Carbs make you fat, not eating fat.  This is a perfect low carb meal.  Eating high carbs turns to sugar, which in turn stores the sugar as fat on your body.

My husband was skeptical but he liked it. I will make it again.
I  added two tablespoons of butter before I put the lid on to simmer. Very high in fat but tastes great!

this is delish.   i use turkey bacon with the same great result.  this is very similar to a recipe i make using kraut instead of cabbage and uses a combo of buttered noodles, bacon, mushrooms and onions.

It's even better with some cooked egg noodles added.  Or make your own drop noodles and add them.  YUM!

Wanda . This is a great cabbage dish.  I have fried cabbage and onion  for the past fifty years and it is fantastic.  Looked at your  southern dish and it got my attention, so I gave it a try.  It created a wonderful meal.  I really enjoyed the flavor.  Thanks for sharing your reciepe.

I've been making a version of this 25+ years.  I fry 4 strips of bacon, add a medium size head of cabbage, sliced, a small/med onion quartered, small green pepper quartered.  My vegetable-averse sons loved it.  So do I.

It was quick, but not exceptional.  Everything wound up tasting like bacon- which  I love to eat, but this was too much for me. 

I think I'll stick with the authentic version of Halushki from Poland rather than this one. it's lighter and fresher tasting and without all the grease.

I like adding a sliced apple to the mix. It takes away the potential bitterness from the cabbage. A pound of bacon? Why not. It's bacon!

I loved how simple this recipe is, even though it is a little time consuming with all the chopping involved. My husband and I really liked it, but only one out of three kids like it, so it may be a while before I make it again.

I made it exactly as written. It’s delicious and I’ll definitely make it again. But it absolutely does not need a whole pound of bacon. One-half pound would have still given it a salty, smoky flavor, silky flavor.

It was really good. A big head of cabbage is to much for just 2 people to eat. Next time I will get a smaller head. My hubby liked it. He wants me to make it again.

I only used 1/2 of the bacon (cooked in the microwave, to decrease grease), but added Andouille sausage.

Here in the north we call this dish Fried Cabbage -- probably because we 'fry' the cut up cabbage in the frying pan in the fat left from the bacon.  Just before serving we add in pre-cooked egg noodles at approx a 50% ratio to the amount of cabbage & bacon, mushrooms etc.  I've made this dish a lot more than once; probably 3 or 4 times a year for the past 45 years.

Easy and simple. The bacon dripping were what gave the dish its flavor. Great side dish for baked chicken or corned beef. Sold out item for dinner and nothing for leftovers.

The author knows exactly what she is talking about when she scolds people who haven’t made it. I made it with less bacon and had to fry up more to get the balance correct! A head of cabbage makes up a large volume when cut as shown, which is why you need a stock pot, while the bacon when fried to crispy really shrinks in volume!

This was really good. I have never made cooked cabbage before!  FYI:  This made a HUGE batch.  Also: My suggestion is to use a really good quality bacon-as meaty as possible.  Some say the amount called for sounds like a lot of bacon, but for as much as it makes, this amount was perfect, IMO.

I don't see where this vegetable dish has much more fat than a typical side dish or casserole. I think people see "bacon" and freak out. i made it and it's a great comfort food for a night you need something easy and tasty. I made it just like the recipe called for.  So tasty! And i think this recipe could be a starter for an entire meal (add hamburger, add beans, add carrots or celery). It's very versatile. Thanks for posting.

Easy Peasy!  Delicious!!!!  We loved it.  I used less bacon to lower the fat a bit but it tastes the same, you don't miss it.  I also made this again and added Cooked noodles to it!  Made a whole meal out of it.  YUMMY

Be sure to cover the dish while simmering to get the cabbage softened and I did eyeball the amount of ingredients since there are only two of us. I added about half a banana pepper while sauteing for some extra kick. This is the first time my husband admitted liking fried cabbage so it will be slipped in more often now - thanks for sharing the recipe.

Didn't mess with recipe unless using thick cut bacon is considered a change.  This dish is now considered a regular go to meal. The first time I made it I thought that there was enough for another meal, can't tell you just how wrong I was.  Not a bite left in the pan.  Yumm!!

I followed the recipe, it was ok. Made it for a family party. Nobody was particularly impressed. A pound of bacon with a large cabbage is not too much. The ratio is fine.

I experimented this time after having made twice before strictly according to the recipe. I added a can of seasoned diced tomatoes that I drained well and some minced garlic. I used about 2 cloves worth. It required adding a couple more teaspoons of the bacon grease to the pan but was even more delicious with the addition of the tomatoes. I also only used low sodium bacon each time I've made this and my husband and I can't tell the difference. I don't add salt or pepper because I don't much like pepper and we are on low to no salt diets. Hubby loves pepper and he adds what he likes to his portions. There is just the 2 of us and we eat it all. It is so good. Feel free to experiment. I'm going to try adding some turkey smoked sausage one of these times and maybe some Lawry's low sodium seasoning because we love that and I think it's worth a try. I'm so glad I tried this recipe at my hubby's urging. I'd never had fried cabbage before and can't stand it boiled. His Mom used to make it for their family all the time and he missed it. We are going to be having this often from now on.

This is an excellent recipe. To the person who added canned mushrooms:  I don't understand why you would add a can of mushrooms to any food you are going to eat. Canned mushrooms are dreadful and fresh mushrooms are terrific. Toss out the canned stuff that tastes nothing like mushrooms and go buy some fresh ones. You'll be amazed at the difference to any recipe calling for mushrooms.

I used bacon grease because I had some on hand. I did halve the recipe and used a small can of mushrooms since my fresh ones were not in good shape. I also added a little garlic and onion powder to give it more flavor.  Added some microwaved-bacon. Had this with some pan-fried kielbasa and spicy mustard. Changes were for my convenience and tastes.

Fried cabbage isn't our norm type of food in fact hubby wasn't too thrilled when I told him of this new recipe.  To be honest,  I'm not the biggest fan of cabbage myself but am looking for new Keto friendly recipes. 
  I made this as the recipe called for and used it as a side dish with pork chops. The only thing I did to make it easier was to use a wok to fry up the cabbage. .
  Turns out hubby loved it and so did I! I mentioned to him that alot of people said a pound of bacon was too much. He suggested we add 2! So the next I make this, 2 pounds of bacon it is!
  This recipe is a keeper!

I love cabbage! When I saw this recipe, I couldn’t wait to make it! I only used 1/2 the bacon but I added smoke sausage. I sliced diagonally 1/4in and browned the sausage in 1 TLB bacon grease. 
I held 1/3 of the onion and mushrooms, adding last with bacon and sausage. ( I like raw onions and this adds crunch) .   I will cook this often

I know this is delicious but I don't use a pound of bacon.  I use about 6 slices of bacon.  Onions and egg noodles.  If you like add a can of diced tomatoes.  Use you imagination.

Not a fan of mushrooms, at least not with cabbage. I wanted a lower fat version so only used 3 slices of bacon, 2 Tbsp avocado oil, 1/2 of an onion and cabbage. This was delicious and healthy. Will definitely make again.

I made a few changes because I only had a med. size head of cabbage. Followed recipe exactly, but found it too bland (I'm from So. Louisiana), so I added 2 teas worchestershire, 1/2 C dry white wine (towards the end), creole seasoning, sea salt and at least a teas. of black pepper. The creole seasoning already has cayenne in it, and I don't like dishes that are too hot.  Tasted it and LOVED it.  Everybody has their own style of cooking; I just adapted this recipe to mine.  Thank you for posting this recipe.  I'm diabetic and trying to find lo carb recipes.  This one  is perfect and a definite keeper.

Delicious !!!!! Made it just as described with exact ingredients and directions since this was my first time making this dish. Fried cabbage and bacon are always winners in my book. You can add a variety of things I’m sure as your favorite vegetables and spices, etc. However don’t get too creative because this recipe is so good as is! Also, nutritional dish with all good for you items including the bacon!

What can I say?  The most delicious  versatile recipe. I made it for my son’s family while I was visiting. He and she are on Keto diets and the two boys hate everything. Everyone loved it. Worked with diets and the kids too.

I just made this for lunch. It's fantastic. My only changes were to pour a little chicken broth in after cooking the bacon to get the good stuff off the bottom of the pan before adding the cabbage/onion/mushrooms. Awesome

I halved the recipe as I had a small purple cabbage and 1/2 pound of bacon and 1/2 onion. I added a clove of garlic. While it was cooking, I threw in a splash of water because it seemed to need it. It was pretty good.

I have been making this for years. I got the recipe from my Grandmother. 
I [usually] use center cut or thick cut bacon and reserve the bacon grease. There is enough fat to allow the shredded cabbage to brown up nicely. 
I would suggest allowing the moisture from the mushrooms and onion to evaporate prior to re-introducing the cabbage.

I'm kinda sorta a no meat eater so I browned the bacon as suggested. Then I added the veggies to a little bit of the bacon grease.  I served the bacon on the side for my husband. It's a fabulous recipe.

I made it with portabello Mushrooms and was fine.  I did fry for a lot longer than the recipe states.  I felt it needed more cook down time for the cabbage.  I also had a left over bowl and tasted it 2 hours later.  WOW....what a different flavor.  Improved with time for sure.

Pretty good. (it's hard to argue with bacon).
I would suggest adding a little of your own favourite spices/flavours, But otherwise, nice and quick, simple, 
bacon-y.

Made this today and loved it.   The only changes I made dealt with the bacon.
I prefer to microwave the bacon. Using the paper towel used to drain excess grease from bacon, I rubbed it on the skillet used for vegetables. Then using about 1 tablespoon of dipping and some olive oil for sweating the vegetables, we got the flavor desired with less animal fat.

Recipe is a keeper

I have been making this since I was a teenager...I never knew what it was called only that my mother Made it as well...the difference is I add minced garlic and basil and parsley and I love sea salt on my food so I added that with a splash of lemon....its fabulous!

I added a little red wine vinegar. Served this over rigatoni. Enjoyed very much.
