So awesome!  I did not know that consomme was so I just bought beef broth. Before I made the recipe I looked it up and realized it is a strong broth so I just added 3 beef bullion cubes to the broth before adding the roast beef. It was so great. Everyone in my family gobbled it up. My husband preferred cheddar and and mustard so it was easy to change it up before putting in the oven.

It does't get much easier than this! Plus, it tastes really good! All I added to the "au jus" was a 1 tsp. of minced garlic, and a 1/2 tsp. of rosemary. I also sauteed a large onion sliced into 1/2 inch rings. I used swiss cheese instead of provolone (personal preference). These were some "Easiest" French Dip sanwiches ever!

This was awesome! I just au jus (in the packet) and it came out great. I added some garlic and onion salt to the juice. I also added garlic salt on top of the sandwiches before cooking. This was quick and simple and we loved it, thanks!

I made this for my son and I tonight.  He said this is better than Arby's!  I did make a few changes.  I added onion powder, garlic powder, and pepper to the beef broth like others did.  I sauteed green bell pepper, onion and mushroom to add to sandwich under the provolone.  Gotta get them veggies in!  I am still trying to find the bread that will hold up to the juice as the hoagie turns too mushy, maybe toasting it as others have done will make the difference.  I'll try that next time.  I have found that the sandwich turns out best with good quality meat from the deli.  This is a keeper for my family as we can customize to individual tastes, quick to prepare and yummy.

This is a GREAT sandwich.  I am the chief cook on our shift at the fire department and the guys are always looking for something different.  These sandwiches along with homemade french onion soup rocks!  Thanks for the great recipe!

My husband and I really really enjoyed these and they were exactly what we were looking for in a french dip. As per others suggestions, I sauteed onions and mushrooms and put them on too. I will definately be making these again.

These were so good and so easy! I had leftover roast beef and beef broth in the freezer, homemade rosemary bread, and provolone. I added a little rosemary to the broth, and it was perfect. My family loved it! Thanks for a great idea,writergirl.

Very easy. I've used consomme forever due to it's weight & flavor.  However, absolutely NOT a fan of deli roast beef b/c it does not even resemb le real roast beef in flavor.  I take a 4 lb.boneless beef roast from the freezer, place it in a 500 degree oven for 30-45 mins.  Turn oven down to 250 and roast UNcoveredfor 6 hrs.  The finished product is fantastic & the drippings must  be moistened, stirred up & added to the consomme.  This is the only way to eat roast beef in our family.

This was a very easy and delicious recipe.   My husband and very picky teenager loved it!  I substituted the beef consomme for 1 can of beef broth and no water and got wonderful results!

I served these sandwiches for dinner and they were really simple to put together and tasted really great.  However, I did change the recipe a bit.  I used a can of French onion soup, 1/2 can of water, and a can of beef broth for the liquid, and sauteed some sliced mushrooms and onions to add as toppers before the provolone.  I also added some horseradish sauce to my sandwich after it was heated.  Everyone else just used the dipping sauce.  But we all thought they were amazing.  We'll definitely have these again.

I have made this recipe for years and it is always a crowd pleaser! I love that it's so quick and easy to make and it's really good. I always take just a couple extra minutes and saute some thinly sliced onions and sliced mushrooms. I add the onions and mushrooms on top of the roast beef and then layer my cheese. The onions and mushrooms make it extra yummy, but the recipe is still 5 stars as is!

Very good, very easy.  I used jack cheese because I didn't have provolone and it was just as good (I've made this recipe several times using provolone).  Kids love it.

Super easy. Can't find beef consomme in Germany so I used beef stock&granules, since I read it is just a really strong broth. I used Swiss cheese, and also added salt and pepper before placing it in the oven. Next time, I'm going to put the bread in by itself first, and then add the meat&cheese to melt once its toasted, because the cheese completely melted before the bread was able to get toasty enough for us.

This was such a great recipe! I sauted some onions in a tbsp of butter first and cooked those down, and then added the beef consomme and a cup of water with 1 bouillon cube. Was a total hit in my house and I have a person in my household that enjoys really good food.!!!! Def a keeper!

I have been making a very similar version of this for
years. A favorite of my husband! The only thing different is a use a can of beef consommé and a can of French Onion and one to one and a half cans water. It makes for a richer 'au jus'. Also use swiss cheese sometimes. GREAT easy recipe!! :-)

This recipe is delish!  My husband was so excited to eat a french dip at home (instead of a restaurant) and I loved that it was so easy.  We used ciabatta rolls.  It has been added to the dinner rotation.  ( :

This is a VERY easy and delicious recipe.  I actually made it using French Onion Soup rather than the beef consomme and it really gave the roast beef flavor.  Toasting the hoagie buns is important!  Overall AWESOME quick meal.

If your hoagie buns are mushie, I recommend you try a baguette. Slice it to preferred length and dip away. It holds up great.

A fair recipe. The sodium factor is a " Killer " At 2000+ mgs of salt, this is not healthy. You can make a scratch dip and improve this to a good and healthy meal. Take-out Chinese food is better than this for the old body.

Toasting the hougie does make a difference.  I toast the bread with garlic butter until it is crispy.  Occasionally; I'll add provolone or Swiss cheese during the toasting.  This seals the bread and allows the au jus to slowly mix into the bread.  I have also used the au jus as a dipping sauce only, that way the bread soaks up the au jus at the time you eat it.  Either way, this is a great sandwich and a regular at my home.

pretty darn good for someone who grew up ordering this at every restaurant! I think it could use a tad more spice - but I can't pinpoint what it needs.  I made it exactly as written and it was excellent.  I had two - shhhhhh!

This was a hit at my house.  Normally if 3 people like it we keep the recipe but everyone loved it.  My daughter said she could eat it every day and my son could only give me a thumbs up because he was too busy eating.

I am but a poor student, so I used the Oscar Meyer prepackaged roast beef, but I think if I'd used some really good deli stuff, and remembered to put horseradish on my sandwich (yummm!!), this would have been even better.  As I made it, it was quite delicious especially considering how inexpensive and easy this was!

OMG this is good!  So tasty and easy, I can't give it anything but five stars!  I've never bought beef consomme before, but didn't have a problem finding it in the store.  I added a touch of garlic and onion powders to the broth.  So good!  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe should be called "So Easy even my 8 year-old son can make it!" My husband thought it was the perfect meal.  Five stars all the way!

I always add red wine to my beef consume...about 2 1/2 tbs. it adds an unmatched flavor...plus, I added garlic powder, and instead of water I add a can of French onion soup. Love!

Very good as written....became a 5 star when we used beef broth, added a dash of worcestershire sauce, garlic powder and onion powder, let simmer 10 minutes...meanwhile we toasted the rolls for 5 minutes then added cheese to melt...placed roast beef directly onto rolls slathered a little horseradish sauce on one side and used the leftover au jus for dipping. Divine Yumminess!

If the meat has fat it will shrink up and look less yummy. It would be better with steak or prime rib slices. 
My husband liked it and then joked about it seeming fancy eventhough it is mostly made from left overs. The next day I made the same thing but as cold sandwhiches and he said he liked it a lot better the other way.
This is good with cooked onions (I added cooked mushrooms to his too) and I think it was better that way.  
I will make this again many times.

Delicious served with a ranch & veggie pasta salad. If you monitor your sodium intake, there are tasty ways to reduce the sodium in this recipe. Use a 1:1 ratio of canned beef broth to homemade sodium free beef stock. I omit the cheese and add onions lightly sauteed in olive oil.

This is the easiest idea for a recipe ever, lol.  I actually just buy a packet of Au Jus mix, prepare it as directed, plus a little rosemary, and then follow this recipe from there.  Yummy & simple.  Pre-toasting the rolls a bit is highly recommended.

Very easy and good, however, I think next time I will add some more flavors to the broth.  Maybe a swish of worcestershire and some onion.  Will salt and pepper the beef after putting it on the bread.  Will definitely make again.

5 stars for being so easy!  A lot of times, these quick/shortcut recipes aren't worth the time they save, but this one is!  I forgot to add the water, and it still turned out great - didn't miss it - but I only made 2 sandwiches instead of four.  Also, we used pepper-jack cheese b/c they didn't have the right kind at the grocery store. Yum! So quick and easy!

I followed this recipe exactly as written- it gets 5 stars for simplicity, an ideal weeknight meal. I would give it 3 stars for taste- I found it bland.  Perhaps with changes (maybe some onions?) it would be tastier.  So 4 stars overall.  Thank you for sharing!

Awesome and easy! Was great for a quick meal! I followed directions which are perfect by themselves and just a couple additions for my fam.. I buttered the top part of bread (cuban) before putting in oven. I sauteed/carmalized some onions, then thru a little course ground mustard on the sandwich when it came out and myyyy oh myyyy.. restaurant quality

Dellicious. Try using a can of French Onion soup (without the water) in place of beef consomme.

This was great, especially for how simple it is! I only had beef broth so I boiled it down to get it thicker, I also threw in about half of a large onion and three large cloves of garlic (I love garlic) and let it boil down together. Once the onions were nice and tender I added the meat, and when I put the meat in the sandwich I strained out the onions and garlic out and used the broth for dipping. Came out awesome.

I actually found this recipe quite bland. I had to add a few ingredients to salvage it. I added 1 shallot, sliced into rings; 1/2 small red onion, sliced; 2 garlic cloves, minced; 1/2 tsp pot herbs. Also, the provolone cheese was very overwhelming. I would heartily recommend a milder cheese, such as mozzarella.

Loved this. It was so simple I don't why I never thought of it myself. I used beef broth with a sprinkling of Lipton onion soup mix and powdered garlic as the au jus, Sauted onion, green and red peppers and mushrooms. I put the bottom half back under the broiler for a few seconds until the cheese melted. I also spread a little Miracle Whip on the top half. Delicious. Rave reviews.

I had my doubts that this was as good as the reviews but boy was I wrong.  This was easy and tasted great!  I did use beef broth but would like to try the French Onion soup as suggested by others.  I also toasted the bread and that suggestion really worked.  Thanks for a really easy dinner!

The rating is as recipe is written but we prefer it with half red wine (or dry sherry) - gives it a more sophisticated twist.   Anyway, so easy no matter which way and a great sandwich.

Great sandwich and so easy. I added half an onion to the consomme and heated it on the stove until the onions were soft. This gave it a wonderful flavor, like french onion soup, and I love the soft onions on the sandwich :) Next time i'm going to use Focaccia bread!

Not my favorite. I have another recipe for french dips that uses beef broth, garlic, crushed red pepper and olive oil, which is much better. The "au jus" is the crucial part. Putting beef in a bun is the easy part.

This is REALLY good, for such a simply recipe. I did not have the beef consomme, so used a pkg of au jus and thickened it with 3 TBSP cornstarch, because my son does not like his bread to get soggy from dipping. This made the au jus much more like a gravy, which was still wonderful. I think the secret is in heating the roast beef in the au jus before placing on the buns.

I followed the first review of LadyBird, and wow.  The broth and the cubes really give the roast beef an amazing taste.  I looked like a pro when I made them lol!  Try a sharp cheddar and honey mustard, gives a it a deli style taste.

It honestly doesn't get much better or easier than this. I've tried French dip recipes that calls for slow cooking a roast and honestly, I feel this is much tastier. Like others, I sauteed onions and mushrooms and livened up the rolls with a bit of butter and garlic powder. Because I couldn't find the consomme I used a can of Au Jus which is made just for this type of sandwich so it worked perfectly. Thank you so much writergirl!

This was such a quick, easy dinner! The quality of the broth makes all the difference...I added sauteed onions and mushrooms to mine which made it more like a philly, but it was great with or without.  Served with sweet potato fries.

This dish was amazingly easy to prepare and well liked. I used Swiss cheese instead.

Saute a few onions and green peppers in butter. (Add a few slices of fresh jalapeno if you are courageous.) Set that aside and warm the beef in the same pan with a little Au Jus. Pile that warm beef into a hollowed out hoagie bun that has been smeared with horseradish sauce. Pile those yummy peppers and onion on top, followed by the cheese - I use Swiss - then pop it in the oven ntil the cheese melts. As far as the Au Jus, amp that dry mix up by substituting brandy or wine for some of the water and throw in a bit of fresh ground pepper.
Yowser, from dud to stud!

I sautéed an onion, a few mushrooms, and a diced jalapeno then added it to the beef broth. We ate the veggies on our sandwiches and it added extra flavor to the broth. Overall, this is a delicious recipe.

Oh all the wonderful possibilities of French Dips...For those who wanna try something other than roast beef, I've made this with thinly slices steaks, also great with turkey breast! =) You can even throw on some Sauteed mushrooms/or onions. YUM!

These sandwiches were SO tasty!  They definitely filled my craving for their restaurant counterparts.  To give mine a little more flavor, I added one packet of Lipton's Onion Soup Mix to the beef consomme and also thinly sliced some onions and green peppers and sauteed them in a skillet with my roast beef before placing onto my hoagie rolls.  Everyone over that night loved it, and the best part was it's an affordable meal to serve for company.  I paired mine with some homemade potato salad and pineapple.

This sandwich is awesome.  It tastes great, it's quick and easy to make, and there is little to cleanup.

Mom, want to make the kids feel special?  Set them at the table with this sandwich, some fruit salad and a class of juice.  Then relax and watch the children bond.

I sorta changed this up a little and added some modifications as comments suggested. Used Boars Head roast beef, sliced thing & rare...I added 2 cloves garlic, 1/2 red onion and 1 shallot to beef consomme & water. Let that boil. Then added roast beef for about 5 minutes. Threw on roll and broiled for 5 minutes. Instead of provolone I used mozzarella - personal preference. I also brushed hot sandwiches with horseradish for a little spice. They were DELICIOUS!

My husband is a picky eater, ad he loves this "easy recipe".   Great with  thinly sliced Boar's Head Londonport beef.  We also put the cheese on both sides of the bread to keep it from getting soggy.

I made a huge batch of these for dinner last night WITH the modifications that others suggested and it was a major hit at our house!  Additions:  I didn't have consume, so I used beef broth boiled down with a few extra bullion cubes added; add a bit of rosemary and garlic to the beef broth; added sauted onions and mushroom smothered in cheese on the top half of the bun; soaked the roast beef in the sauce mix for about 5 min before putting it on the bottom half of the bun; baked the halves open faced in the oven for 5 minutes.  YUM!

I have been making these sandwiches for years. Here is how I make mine. I use Au Jus and sometimes swiss cheese. I put the meat in the au jus and to warm it. Meanwhile, I butter the hoagie rolls and put them under the broiler just to brown. Then, I put the meat and cheese on one side of bun and put back under the broiler until the cheese is melted and starts to brown. Then it is a matter of preference. Serve as is are put mayo and/or mustard on the top bun. sever with a dipping bowl of Au Jus. So good.

SO TASTY! I made these exactly like the recipe says... extremely easy.  This is going to be one of those meals that I make when I don't want to spend a lot of time in the kitchen.

The "steak rolls" from walmart's bakery are perfect for these, but small so they make about 8 sandwiches.

Wow!  My whole family loved these sandwiches.  I used an au just packet which came with the meat from the deli.  I also added sauted mushrooms, onions and peppers on top of the meat.  These were delicious.  Thank you so much for fantastic recipe.

This was super easy to make and very quick. We liked swiss cheese instead of provolone. Beef Consomme is sold at Walmart. Campbells makes it. Good for a quick meal that isn't pizza. Works well without cheese as well. The Au Jus is a bit bland, so I'm going to see what spices I can add next time.

I also made sauteed onions, peppers and mushrooms to go on top.  Instead of hoagie rolls, I used a large loaf of french bread.  I left it whole to cook, then cut it into pieces to serve.  The bread didn't get soggy.

This is a very good quickie version.  For those looking for a roll that stands up to the au jus - I love to use a good sourdough roll.  I split it and put just a touch of margarine or butter and pan toast it on the cut side - then add the fixins ending with the cheese and under the broiler to melt the cheese.

I have been making my own version of this for years and it's awsome.  I prefer it open faced.  I make this any time I have made a roast and have left overs.  I use crisp Italian buns, slice off the top as little as I can to leave the widest surface of the bun.  I sautee  a bunch of onions and use a packaged au jus dip.  I slice/dice up the leftovers and  warm them up using a bit of the au jus.  Then just load up the bun, layer with lots of onions, top with usually swiss cheese and broil until cheese has melted and slightly grilled.  Ready to serve.  Sometimes I use the shaved off top portion to cover or just use it to dip in the jus.  Either way, not only is it so simple, the presentation is equally as great.  Even when I haven't made a roast in a while, I'll grab some roast beef from the deli just to get "our fix".  When you want it, you want it!

This is a recipe I have been making for a long time.   My family loves it.   Here is my twist, I saute some mushrooms and onions in the pan, after cooking I will add the beef broth. I spoon some broth on the bread  and melt the cheese on the bread before adding the roast beef.   Then add the roast beef and mushrooms and onions if you want them.  Then pop back in the oven for a little bit.   Such a yummy dinner.   Enjoy

This is a really easy, really good meal for lunch or dinner. I usually don't dip my sandwich, I just drizzle a little of the juice over before I pop it in the oven.

Ok as far as french dip sandwiches go... this just wasn't that great.  My youngest didn't eat it.  My oldest thought it was ok.. (which was odd being as she's just picky) my husband well.. he's Active Duty military and he'll eat just about anything so that doesn't say a whole lot being as he ate this... and being as French Dip sandwiches are my favorite, I was really disappointed in this.  :(

This gets 5 stars for being easy and fast, but more importantly, satisifying all my kids! The only changes I made were to add a little garlic powder to the brew and lightly mist the top of each bun with water then add a little sea salt. I have 13-yr-old triplets and a 5-yr-old, and their food tastes are as different as they are -- but they ALL loved this. I always ask them to "star" a new recipe (5 being the highest) and they all gave this one a 6! I served it with a Caesar salad and it was a hit. Thanks, writergirl!

For me, this was more about using up leftovers than anything.  With some left over deli roast beef and a loaf of already sliced French bread, I had a French dip in no time with this quick-to-make au jus sauce. For a little added flavor and flare, I chose to grill my sandwich.

This sandwich is wonderful and simple, and I actually can't wait to make it again.  Our only complaint is that you can't eat more than one unless you have something with a different flavor for a side dish.  But nothing against the sandwich itself.

There was a split decision in my house about how these turned out.  We all enjoyed these sandwiches, but I wondered if there wasn't a little something missing, maybe some garlic powder or something.  We'll definitely be making these again, and maybe next time I'll do some tweaking.  As written, though, this was a very good recipe.

I loved this! Its was easy and yummy. I used French bread cut lengthwise and used "French Onion" condensed soup instead of the beef consume.

WOW! Delicious! I did saute some onions and add to it and threw the bread in the broiler with some butter first. The best french dip I've ever had!!

This is a simple recipe. I am from NYC.  In NYC they only dip the roast beef in the hot beef juice.  Then they dip the top part of the roll in the juice. John's Deli in Bensonhurst Brooklyn is famous for this. In Upstate they use a Kaiser roll and brush the top with water and sprinkle course salt and caraway seeds on top and bake for a few minutes.  They do the exact same dipping.  This is a Beef on Wick.  To make it great you need to put fresh horseradish on the sandwich and skip the cheese.  I mean really fresh.  To make fresh horseradish, find the root in a fruit market, peel it with a knife, cut it into small pieces and then grind it up in a blender adding white vinegar.  Keep the room well ventilated and have a glass container ready to put it into.  Yummy!

I made these with Kemmelweck rolls, sharp cheddar cheese, and horseradish similar to beef on a weck NY style. They were very yummy and we will make again soon.

One of our favorites!  I split the rolls in 1/2, spread with butter and then sprinkle on garlic salt.  Top with cheese and then broil until melted.  Put on the beef and dip into the juice as you eat.  The juice won't drip through  because of the cheese - however dipping in the juice is a must!

Very easy to make and tastes awesome. The only thing I did differently was to lightly butter the rolls, add a touch of garlic powder and stick them under the broiler to brown them up a bit. Take them out, add the beef and cheese and stick them back under for a bit. Really gives a nice flavor to the sandwich.

Very easy recipe to make, and fast! I used French hamburger rolls instead of the hoagie rolls, that is the only thing I would change. The end result was a simple meal with huge flavor and fast cleanup.

Following the directions exactly leaves a dry sandwich.  Soaking the beef took the rareness out and baking it removed any moisture that was left.  Next time I will skip putting the beef in the heated broth and just put the sandwich under the broiler for a minute to toast the buns better and melt the cheese.

I love this recipe!  I used a can of beef-onion and consomme, and it was too strong.  I would choose one or the other (we preferred beef-onion) and stick with the recipe.  Five stars for being cheap, incredibly easy and fast, and SUPER tasty!  Thank you.

This recipe is my Friday night Monk and Psych watching meal.  I have made this many times for my family and it is easy and so good.  I have always loved french dip sandwiches, and I can't belive it never occured to me to warm up the meat in the au jus...so simple, but genius at the same time!  The Beef consomme is a must--it taste way better than regular beef broth.  Also, I like to add a sprig of rosemary and about a tablespoon of Dale's sauce (a kind of soy/worcestshire sauce blend).  It will knock your socks off!!

These were so good...hard to believe how easy it was.  The only thing that i did different is that i toasted the bread a little before adding the meat to keep it from getting soggy. I also added onions and bell peppers.  I had never heard of consomme before, but i finally found it in the campbells soup section. (just a hint for those who are lost like i was) Quick, Easy, and Delicious.....a definite keeper!

Very quick and easy and yummy! I spread a little butter and sprinkled a little onion powder on the bread and toasted them under the broiler. I did everything else as written except used the broiler instead of the oven.

Very good, I made a few changes to it. I added 1/2 tspn of rosemary, 1/4 tsp of gralic salt and a little red wine and some onions to the broth. On medium heat until the onions became cooked, tossed in the meat for 3 minutes as suggested.
Then placed the meat, cheese and onions on the rolls until the cheese melted. Very Good.

This is a perfect quick meal for those nights when you dont have a lot of time.  A nice simple recipe, that was really tasty.    I didn't change anything, but it could easily be doctored up with spices or different cheeses and maybe some onions to change it up every now and then.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was wonderful. Quick and easy, just like it says! I almost gave up on finding the consomme at the store, but I'm glad that I was able to find it. I added a bit of onion powder for flavor, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. My husband loved it! This is definitely a keeper.

mmmm...this was DELICIOUS!  I actually modified the recipe.  I bought 1/2 pound thinly sliced roast beef, and 1/2 pound angus roast beef thinly sliced from the deli.  For my juice I boiled 2 cups of water and added a little more than 2 tsp of boullion granuals.  I mixed that up and put it all together in a pot on low to simmer.  I cut up 4 bakery buns, topped with roast beef, and thinly shredded mozzarella. Then I stuck it under the broiler until the cheese was melted and served with some of the juice in a cup for dipping.  It was DELICIOUS!!

Thanks for the recipe idea!

My husband and I love this!  We use swiss cheese and I saute some onions and mushrooms but it's great!  I definitely recommend it!

These were great!  We had a group of teens over and they ate just about every last one of them.  They were extremely simple to make, but still tasted like they were from a sandwich shop.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!  We used a loaf of soft french bread that we sliced, buttered and toasted under the broiler before adding the meat and cheese.  Delicious and SUPER FAST!  Recipe takes about 10 minutes.  You can't usually get something so tasty for under 30!  Great Recipe!

This was good.  I couldn't find consomme, so had to settle for plain beef broth, but with a bit of salt (the irony, I know) and some onions it was a good dipping sauce.  It made a great quick dinner w/fresh fruit.  Thanks for sharing!

Quick supper! Added the garlic, onion powder and fresh cracked pepper per other reviews. Hubby liked, served with salad on the side. Toasted rolls prior to assembly so no sogginess! Also lightly buttered rolls after toasting.

All I heard was "MMMM" from my teenage sons and husband.  I made it exactly as recipe except added sauteed onions on my husband's.  Next time I'll saute mushrooms, onions, and green pepper to put on. Great meal and nice for mid week when you don't have a lot of time to cook. They cool off fast so make sure you time any sides you make accordingly.

I bought premium Boar's Head roast beef and good quality provolone.  Added some minced garlic to the au jus sauce, just heated up the roast beef in the broth - no slow cooking required!  I sauteed shallot, mushrooms and sliced red pepper.  Each sandwich had the beef/veggie combo topped with provolone and back in the oven to melt the cheese.  Divine!  Make sure the rolls are really nice and well toasted, don't skimp on that step - it's key.  For the vegetarian diet stepdaughter I loaded up a roll with the veggies and melted the cheese like the others.  This is in the regular rotation, for sure.

My wife's first French dip sandwich.  She's not much of a red meat eater.  She loved it!  I was thrilled.  Great simple recipe.  Only thing I added was sautéed onions.

This is one of my go to fixes for dinner when it's been a busy day and there's no time for a big ordeal. My husband loves these sandwiches. I do just use a can of beef broth and he seems to think its fine. So quick and easy, perfect for when you don't have time or just don't feel up to making a big complicated dinner.

Made this for the family tonight, it was quick & easy but a little bland. Only change was I used French bread rolls. The beef consommé was okay but a little bland for my taste. Next time I'll try McCormick's Au Jus packet or try beef broth. On the plus side its low in calories and was super easy!!

My fiance and I make these almost every other week.  It is a very good quick weeknight meal that we love.  We followed the recipe exactly and they turn out great every time.  I will say, however, that it is worth it to buy the name-brand deli roast beef as opposed to off-brand.

So there was no consomme at publix, I bought campbells beefy mushroom soup, and beef stock in place of water. My husband said, I can eat this every night! (he has no idea how simple the recipe is) I said "because I love you, I can make it every night." I think he'll be eating this until its coming out his ears. I have a complex pallet, and I was also pleased.

Updating but can't seem to access my first review, so it's here. This was great, nice idea for warming up the meat, adding it to the au jus in the sauce pan, this sandwich was excellent and exactly what I was looking/craving for! Thanks for sharing! Simple and YUM!

I've made a few other fancy french dip recipes over the years, but none beat this uber simple one!  Love it.  Added sauteed green peppers and onions to sandwiches.  Yum.

Good, easy recipe! We sautéed some bell pepper and onion slices in a bit of olive oil and worcestershire sauce to go on the sandwiches. It made them even better and bulked the sandwiches up. Like a lot of other people, I added some onion powder to the consommé.

Wow, this quick and simple recipe tastes incredible! I didn't have consomme so I just used beef cubes and broth, and it's still delicious.

super easy and very good.  I didn't have consumme either, so used beef broth (w/o the water) and added 2-3 beef bullion cubes.  Added in a little onion powder - and it's a winner!  kids and hub said, "yum, please make this again!"

This was fantastic.  And so easy to make.  I took the advice of some of the others and used beef bullion cubes to make the sauce since I had that on hand.  I used about 2 cups of water and 6 bullion cubes.  It was great.  Definitely going on my list of favorites.

I needed something quick for dinner and happened across this recipe! Super easy and fast! By heating the beef in the au jus, the sauce became much more beefy flavored. Instead of baking the bread with the meat and cheese, I spread some mayo on the bun and toasted it in a small skillet. I then melted the cheese on the meat in the skillet. Still turned out great! The fiance was impressed, but don't tell him how easy it is!

I agree, this was just "okay." It made up really fast for a quick meal. I thought the bread was really dried out after baking it that long though. My husband is a HUGE fan of french dips and I could tell he wasn't super impressed either. He kept sucking in dried out bread flakes when biting down, throwing himself into coughing fits...More of an eater's error;) I will probably look for a different recipe.

Just o.k.. I'll stick with the premade kind unless it was just my beef was not sliced thin enough. Great if you are in a pinch and want a warm sandwich.

Super quick! I added an envelope of French Onion Soup mix to the broth (I used canned beef broth) and swiped some mayo across the rolls after toasting. My family devoured them!

Made this just as written and my boyfriend loved it! I used store-brand steak rolls and I buttered and broiled them first to make them flavored and crispy.  Then after letting the beef soak and simmer in juice for about 30min, I put it all together and let it melt under the broiler.  Served with corn on the cob - great meal! The next day, he was determined to make some on his own with the leftovers for lunch! Thank you!

This was the perfect end to a very busy day. My 5yr old LOVED this, total shocker as she is not a meat fan.

Very easy and quick, and quite tasty. I added some garlic and spices to the broth to enhance flavor. Start to finish this took me about 15 minutes and it passed my "Husband Test!"

I could not find consomme so I did as suggested by another reviewer and used beef broth and added 3 cubes of beef bouillon which may or may not have made a difference. These were easy and great tasting. I am sure that if you had some sauteed mushrooms, onion and peppers although it would no longer be considered a french dip would have been a delicious addition to this sandwhich. 
I plan on making this again in the near future.

These were so easy and so good that we will definitely be having again.  The only change we made was my husband wanted Swiss cheese and I had Horseradish Cheddar cheese on mine. Thanks for sharing!

really good, fast and easy.  We used an aged cheddar instead of provolone.  I didn't use the water with the consomme.  I think the water would make it too "thin"--for us anyway.

YUMMY! This recipe was super easy and the BF was REALLY happy about it. I didn't have consomme, so I used beef broth and seasoned it lightly. Worked like a charm. Thank you for the quick and easy recipe, writergirl!

I make a version of this recipe quite often using cube steak - cook steaks with 1tb butter, salt, pepper, garlic powder until done remove steaks add ingredients for the au jus simmer for 5 minutes return steaks to au jus until ready to serve. Very yummy!

I added garlic powder, onion powder & pepper (as per suggestion) to the au jus.  I used 1/4 lb each of roast beef and swiss cheese for two sandwiches, made on toasted french bread.  I also sauteed a large onion and one portabella cap and added under the cheese on each side of the bread before baking.  Hearty & Delicious!

These are a cinch to prepare and are a good choice for a busy weeknight meal. I took the suggestion of another reviewer and buttered my hoagie rolls with butter and sprinkled them with a little garlic powder. I prefer swiss cheese on mine, but my husband and 3 year-old daughter enjoy their sandwiches with provolone. Making these quite a few times now, I've tried it with both the consomme and French onion, and both work well, although I prefer the French onion soup. I always toast my rolls and use a good quality, thinly-sliced deli roast beef.Tasty and satisfying, these little beauties will remain on the rotation!

I make this every 3 months for our Wednesday night church dinner. I spoon mild green chilies over the cheese and roast beef,each one in a hoagie roll then wrap in foil, heat in oven at 200' 2 hours before serving. Cheesy beefy goodness.. serve with chilled broccoli salad. a side of the consume for dipping and its a hit every time!!

I used croissants instead of the hoagie rolls and we all loved them.  The consomme was perfect.  No water.

My husband loves these type of dip sandwiches. I asked him about the sauce and we subed the Beef Consomme for condensed french onion soup. He said it tasted very close to what he usually gets.

This was sooooo tasty. I used 3 beef bouillion cubes instead of consomme and it was still awesome. Next time I may saute some onions and put them in there too.

these were great! very easy like the title says! i did toast my bread in the oven first for about 3 min to cut down any sogginess, which worked well. i also used one slice of cheese on bottom as well as top. i used an au jus packet that came free with the purchase of my roast beef (deli promotion) and added extra water and beef granules and added garlic powder and black pepper to the broth. i sauteed red peppers and onions in separate pans and made each sandwich to order. 1# of roast beef made 6 sandwiches.  also cup up some jalapenos and set on the table for whoever wanted an extra kick! there were NO leftovers!

This was really good! I sauteed some sliced onions in a little butter, then added beef broth. We like our roast beef more rare, so I just put each slice in the broth for a few seconds, just long enough to moisten it. Next time I will use consomme as recommended, instead of broth - it was a little bland. Thanks for the great and easy recipe!

Okay-I usually hate the recipes on here that are stupid-easy that I don't think should be given the time of day because anyone and everyone could think of it without reading a recipe. But, I was desperate one night and decided to just "go for it." Well, stupid-easy can be surprisingly-delicious! Deceptively easy, nice flavors, and super-quick dinner that makes people think I worked a LOT harder than I actually did! Try it, you'll love it.

This was so easy and was such a bit hit with my family for dinner.  I doubled the recipe for my big family.  I couldn't find any consumme so I went with canned beef broth and then added 1/2 tsp each of garlic powder, onion powder and black pepper.  It was great and I will make this again soon!

Very good and SUPER EASY!   Supper was ready in 15 minutes with little clean up.  My only problem was the fact the the hoagie got real soggy.  Next time I may just toast the hoagie and melt the cheese at the same time, then add the roast beef last rather than constructing the sandwich first.  Other than this the recipe was tasty and perfectly simple....a busy mother's dream!  :)

This is fast and easy!  Loved it!  Just make sure you slightly drain the roast beef before you put it on your bread.  Otherwise your sandwich will be soggy before you get to dip it in the au jus.

I loved it, it's hand down the best quick French Dip Sandwich recipe.  Additionally, it's better than any other of the 10 or so slow cooked recipes on this site that I've tried.  The sandwiches were devoured in record time.  I agree with others, that you could tweak it with herbs and spices, but its optional depending on your time frame and what's in you pantry.  Double-strength beef broth works well in a pinch.

Excellent recipe.  I bought a package of Au Jus mix instead of doing the consumme.  Worked out great!  This is one of my husband's favorite sandwiches, and he ate three of them!  Simple, fast, easy, and delicious... it was everything I wanted!

This was very good, but needed more au jus!  The comsumme is a must, I also added a couple dashes of Worstershire, garlic, onion powder, and some other seasonings I had sitting there.  Next time I'll try it with Swiss.

This was a great quick weeknight meal.  My husband loved it as much as when I would cook a roast in the crock pot all day for au jus sandwiches.  I wish I new about this shortcut earlier!  I sauteed some onions for our sandwiches and toasted the bread before putting the sandwiches together.  That will help your bread from getting too soggy too quickly.

Really great recipe.  We didn't have the beef consomme either so I added a couple beef bouillon cubes as someone else suggested.  I also sauteed some onions on the same pan I made the sauce in to give it more flavor.  Not quite restaurant flavor but still good.

Wow. This was soo easy - and soo delicious.  My husband even said that it was better than Phillipe's (LA's "Birthplace of the French Dip").  I added some garlic powder, Worcestershire sauce, and butter to taste.  I used Demi Baguettes and toasted them a bit in the oven before adding the meat and cheese.  I also poured the au jus onto the bread, soaking it a bit, before putting it back into the oven to melt the cheese.  Turned out DELICIOUS!

Really great for a quick meal!  In the summer time if I don't feel like heatig up the kitchen, I just warm up the meat in the microwave for 1 minute and butter and toast the hoagie buns.  You can also use Aus Jus sauce if you can't find beef consumme.

My husband loves french dip sandwiches and after this recipe, I am a convert too. I have made it twice. Once I used a can of beef broth for the sauce, the second time, a packet of au jus. Both times I added onion powder and both broths were delicious. We will definitely make this again!!!

This is one of our very favorite dinners! Its super duper easy & so delicious! I use a packet of Au Jus Gravy mix instead of beef consume. It turns out great! I butter the hogie buns & broil them in the oven until golden brown, then I follow the recipe & put the cheese on one side of the bread open faced & the meat on the other & broil in oven to melt cheese. Then we dip these in the Au Jus gravy... YUM!

This recipe couldn't be better! So quick, so easy and so good. I always used to order this in restaurants, but now prefer this sandwich over all others. I have also served this to tons of people, and it's definitely a crowd pleaser! Didn't change a thing... didn't need to. Seriously it tastes like you have slaved all day, and it's so quick.

This recipe was just o.k. in my opinion.  The one really good thing is that they are fast and easy.  My family ate them and didn't complain but I would not serve them again.  I bought sliced roast beef from my deli counter as the recipe called for.  If I want to make a french dip again I will make my own beef.

This was really good for being so incredibly simple. I just don't make complicated recipes so this is right up my alley and uses ingredients I tend to have on hand already. Today I used au jus mix in the packet with only 2 1/2 cups water instead of 3. I also used a roasted garlic artisan bread because that is what I had on hand and it was delicious!!

I have to say, this recipe tasted just like, if not better than, the french dip I have been craving all the time from a chain sandwich shop!  And the best part is it was EASY to make!  I agreed with others about toasting the bread first though.  Came out perfect.  Oh, and I didn't have beef consumme so I used Au Jus gravy mix and used only 2 1/2 cups of water with it rather than the 3 it called for.  I also added seasonings to the au jus, like garlic salt and onion powder.  Just enough for taste.  YUMMY.  If I had the ingredients on hand right now, that is what would be for dinner in my house tonight!  THE BEST!

It's not often leftovers make a meal comparably enjoyable to one freshly made. I will make sure I always buy a roast beef a bit bigger just for this reason. A Sunday roast dinner can be stretched to another day as thinly sliced leftover beef is piled high atop soft crispy buns. I am a beef lover but do not care for it from the deli. Using leftover meat is far less expensive and cooked the way you like it. I don't use consomme very often and had forgotton its nice smooth flavour. Rather than water I added 1 cup of low-sodium beef oxo/water. I chose to carmelized some onions and had to use motzerella cheese. This was served on the freshest buns I could find. Dinner was on the table in under 20 minutes. Five stars for quick, inexpensive and exceptional good eats!

Very easy and good. For the Au Jus I did not have beef consomme, so I used a can of beef broth and a can of french onion soup, mixed with a can of water and salt and sugar and garlic powder. It was really good. Think I will use suggestion from Paul and serve with homemade french onion soup next time. We normally just have fries with gravy as the side.

It doesn't get much easier.  For SIX 'hoagie' rolls, I used the full pound of roast beef and one slice of Provolone (broken in half to fit the entire piece of bread).  I used one pkg of Au Jus to soak the meat slices, and had to add beef broth (and some bouillon cubes) as I didn't have enough from the one packet of Au Jus.  Yum!

I tried this the day I found it on here.  I doubled this on a day when extra kids were coming over for dinner and everyone LOVED these.  We were all starving and they were a big hit--thanks for sharing! (some of us put hot pepper rings on our sandwiches--good if you like to add a little kick)

I loved these! Only thing I changed was using a pouch of Au Jus instead of the broth and water. WHen I made the Au Jus I added 2T of flour to the gravy powder first to make it thick.  YUM!!

I love this recipe. The sandwiches are better than in some restaurants. I use mesquite or garlic flavor roast beef from the deli and add grilled onions. I've made them with provolone and white american and they're always great. Thanks for such a simple but delicious recipe.

This was excellent! Cheap, easy, fast, and delicious. I sauteed one small sweet onion and a small can of sliced mushrooms (in butter & soy sauce) and added them to the sandwiches after they came out of the oven. My husband ate 3 sandwiches! He said "better than a restaurant". I will be making these the next time I have guests over. In the future, I will try and lower the calorie content with low-fat cheese and whole wheat bread. Thanks for a top ten recipe!

Wow!  This was so easy and wonderful.  I did season the meat with garlic powder and season salt and added 1/2 packet of onion soup mix.  This will become a regular for dinner. Update 5/21/13...I recently went to a restaurant in my home town that was rated the #1 restaurant. I ordered the french dip sandwich and it was horrible! It was flavorless. Also, it was so greasy it left a film in my mouth and on my lips. A few days later I made this recipe (I've been using this since 2009) and it is still the best french dip sandwich I have ever had! My family can never get enough of this! I used a sirloin roast which has little fat, but it is well worth the extra cost.

Excellent!  I used 2 cans beef broth/consumme with only 1 can of water.  Also followed other reviewers and used garlic spread on the buns and added sauted mushroom and onions.

Thanks for sharing - will definitely make again!

This is a 4 because of the ease.  A nice hot filling meal, and it took very little time to make.  It was good, but not great, so next time I would add some onion for sure, and maybe something else to jazz it up a bit.  Was a nice change from chicken.  LOL

This recipe has quickly become a family favorite.  It's easy and quick to make and most importantly, tastes delicious.  I had the roast beef "shaved" at the butcher so it was extra thin.  I also added sauted sweet onions and portabella mushrooms.  My husband and son both said "Delicious!"

This was excellent and easy and quick!  I made the 'French Baguettes' from this site, which were perfect for these sandwiches.  I used beef broth, which I thought worked just fine, and also added some garlic powder and Natures Seasoning.  I accidentally boiled the beef mixture and found that the beef really shrunk in size and I wished that I had prepared a little more.  Perfect easy dinner!

I LOVE French dip sandwiches and have eaten many in restaurants and diners.  This recipe is every bit as good--if not better--than those.  Thank you for the recipe, and I encourage every to try this one just as it's written.  No changes or substitutions necessary.

I've made the actual roast beef in a slow cooker before, and I think this is even better! I used a can of beef broth with about 1/2 tsp of rosemary. When it comes to simplicity and taste, this is the best recipe on the site!

No changes made except 2 of us are Keto so instead of using the hoagie bun, used 1 LG. Tortilla cut in half and placed beef and provolone on each half. After time in oven we folded the tortilla halves in half. All were happy whether with the hoagie or tortilla. Served with toss salad and chips. A quick and easy meal that is very satisfying.

I made this with leftover prime rib, thinly sliced, & it was very good.  I added minced garlic to the au jus.  I also sauteed sliced poblano peppers & onions to add to the sandwiches before baking.  I did toast the rolls with some garlic butter before baking with the beef, cheese, peppers, etc.  The cooking process was spot on, & the sandwiches easy to prepare.  There was nothing left when our meal was finished, & my husband drank the remaining juice like it was his favorite beer!

My DH made this tonight for our supper.  It was just OK-nothing great flavor wise.  Probably won't make again.  I think 1 C of water added to the beef consomme was too much.  Maybe just 1/2 C. water added.  Maybe Swiss cheese instead of the Provolone would add more flavor.  Also read in the reviews about Provel cheese and got the recipe to make it.  Again that might add more flavor.  But won't be making this one as is again.

These are super easy to make and a great addition to a busy weekday menu option. You can use any kind of cheese you like best. I sauté some onions to put on top of the roast beef and under the cheese before baking them in the oven.

This was quick and delicious.  Such a nice change from just a plain sandwich when you need a quick meal.  i served it with coleslaw which might sound a little strange but turned out to be a good combination.  Nutritious also.  Thanks for recipe.

This was amazing and easy. I could not find consumme at the store, so I took the advice of another reviewer and used beef broth and 4 beef bouillon cubes. I got some thin sliced seasoned Boar's Head roast beef from the deli, threw some carmalized onions on top after the beef came out of the oven, and served the sandwhich between two pieces of garlic french bread. I'm also from St. Louis, and we love our provel cheese. I used one slice of provel and one slice of provolone AND IT WAS AMAZING!! One of the best dinners we've had in a while.

It turned out great the first time when made according to the recipe. The second time I just toasted the roll in the toaster, did everything else the same,  and liked it even better.

My husband and I use Campbell's Au Jus gravy (a nicely seasoned broth or consommé) and use the microwave to heat the beef in the broth. Rolls toasted a bit in the oven. We usually serve some options for the sandwiches including sliced provolone, chopped onions, horseradish.  This is a meal that is extremely delicious and satisfying but takes little time or preparation (and also little cleanup).

Ahhhh-mazing!! I was skeptical about using deli roast beef but it turned out so good!  I did make some changes though. I used the McCormick au jus packet. It has so much flavor that you don't need to add a thing. Just follow the prep instructions on the packet.  For the roast beef, I bought the Dietz & Watson brand. It is super expensive at $13 / lb but it made all the difference. For the bread, I used a fresh baked french loaf from my grocery store's bakery.

The french loaf was the perfect size to cut into 4 sandwiches. Once I split the bread open, I spread a little bit of butter on the inside before adding the beef.

As for the roast beef, I prefer mine on the rarer side, so I only put mine into the hot au jus just long enough to saturate without cooking it further.

It turned out so amazing and my family scarfed it down! It seriously could have passed for a meal at an upscale restaurant! I was super impressed. :)  The only thing I would do differently next time is probably broil the sandwiches for the last minute. I didn't feel they were quite hot enough after only 5 minutes in a 350 degree oven. Plus, I like my cheese to be super melted with a little bit of browning.

Great as is! I just added a bit of butter and a dash garlic salt to the bare slice of bread before placing in the oven and when it was done I dunked one side of the bare bread in the au-jus before placing onto the cheese and beef side. This sealed the sandwich nicely and tasted terrific. I loved how the bread remained soft and the cheese melted.

I enjoyed the hoagie sandwiches.  I will make again and try with 
four slices of roast beef instead of two, and the consomme was great with the bread.

Didn't have a can of consomme on me but I did have Better Than Bouillon beef base. Carmelized onion with some garlic powder, added 1 T beef base and a couple T red wine to deglaze. Then added a few cups of beef broth. Last, strained the onion from the mixture, brought the liquid to low boil  and whisked in flour to slightly thicken. Then followed the french dip recipe and it turned out outstanding. (was going to add the onion on top of the beef/before layering cheese but forgot!)

I had seven to feed so I bought 2 pounds of  deli meat (thinly sliced). 1 or 2 cloves chopped garlic,  pan-cooked in butter for a minute in a large pot, then added 32 oz beef broth, 1 cup water, and 1 rounded Tbsp. of bullion paste. Saute onion s a red pepper strips, lightly salted, on the side, as an optional topping to add. I broke meat into about four sections to warm together in broth and then set the meat in a strainer over the broth to minimize the drippiness before adding to the oven-toasted buns. It was a BIG hit and my husband has already requested an encore!

Really good! I used left over roast instead of the deli meat. They are also really good with turkey instead of beef, and you can put onions on them!

Made this last night for husband and step daughter and it was met with raves! I will admit to taking another reviewers advice and using 1 can of beef broth and 1 pkg of dry onion soup mix instead of the consumme'. Because my eaters like mayonnaise on almost everything (ugh) I did slather the rolls with a thorough but light covering of that. I think it prevented the beef juice from making the rolls soggy.  Very easy, very quick. Will make again!

Very good! I made mine with sub rolls, and I halved the recipe since I was just cooking for myself. Four slices of roast beef and two slices of provolone on each. I could still only eat one of them!

This quickly became a family favorite from the first time I made it.  I don't change any of the recipe other than adjust cooking times and I prefer to use the 'premium' roast beef as opposed to the cheaper stuff you find with the Buddig lunch meats, but the cheap stuff works in a pinch.

I love French Dip but because of where I live its not always easy to find roast beef with out breaking the bank.


My husband and I switched to ham and We loved it, Also switched the beef consomme with beef bullion cubes.

Thank you so much for this recipe

Turned out great and only took 10 minutes! For the au jus, I used a can of beef broth and a package of dry French Onion Mix and it was excellent. Served with green beans and potato chips.

It was pretty good as presented.  I love a strong au jus for dipping so I tried undiluted Campbells onion soup for dipping and love it.  Also use it for a quick steak sandwich dip.  Salty, but you can dip only what you need and use a spoon to put the onion on your bite...yum!!

I place the beef on a cutting board and make one inch cuts across it.  Cut one bell pepper in slices, slice one medium or large onion and cut across rings a few times.  Spray a skillet and soften pepper and onions.  Add beef and stir a few minutes.  Place meat on hoagie rolls, cover with provolone  and broil open face. Serve with packaged au jus made up with a tbsp of flour.

This literally could not have been easier or more delicious!  I made this for an easy family dinner and served 7 people. I had two lbs of meat and ended up with a little left over. My family is full of critics and they couldn't stop talking about how great these sandwiches were!  My father is still talking about them days later. This will be my new go-to for a quick easy dinner!

So easy and delicious.  4 stars due to modifications.  The buns I bought were pretty soft so they got a toast in the oven for 5 min beforehand.  I used beef broth and added a little garlic salt.  I let the roast beef soak in the broth over low heat while a side of frozen french fries cooked up.  Added horseradish sauce.  YUM.

This seems too simple to be a real recipe, but it was delicious.  My husband made one for his friend and told him it would "blow his mind."  That might have been the beer talking, but they are really quite tasty.  I'll never make one any other way again.

These are delicious! Doubled all ingredients to feed a family 7 (had leftovers). Used Hillshire Farms ultra thin roast beef, which was perfect. The consomme really made it taste restaurant-style! These are going into our regular meal rotation!

This is one of the best effort to taste return ratios you will ever get.  Very quick and simple to put together and very little can go wrong because the steps are so basic.  It was a real crowd pleaser in our home.

So good and easy.  I made it with Boars Head meat and cheese and fresh bread.  So easy and so good! Tip: toast the bread in the oven before adding the meat and it helps prevent the bread from getting soggy.

I was looking for a good French dip recipe and this is it. I'm a big home clock so I like to have a very tasty meal. I ended up buying sub buns from Jimmy John's for the roast beef sandwich and it turned out great.

We have made these 3 times in the past 2 weeks.  Super simple and easy to customize.  I know some people get frustrated when a reviewer makes changes, but that's  part of cooking.  I do add a couple cloves of finely chopped garlic and 1/4 tsp of red pepper flake to the au jus and let it simmer for an hour.  Do saute red onion and sliced mushrooms.  Do mix some sweet-hot mustard with a bit of mayo and butter the rolls with it.   The recipe also allows for making 90% of it ahead of time, then just pop it in the oven when ready.  Love it  !!

These were soooo yummy!  One of the best french dips I've ever had!  Followed the recipe exactly except I did not dilute the consomme so much.  Hubby absolutely raved over them too.  This one is definitely a keeper!  Thanks so much!

This was delicious and super easy. I sauteed some onions and added mayo for a real Philadelphia steak experience. And, I fed ten people for a shockingly low cost and effort while they were all delighted with the wonderful fare.

Only 4 stars because I have found if you use french onion soup (without the water) with some Worcestershire sauce its even better! No extra sauteed onions etc but addition of mushroom is good if you like it. I also add hot pepper rings before it put provolone. It all depends on how you like it!

I've been making this for years, but I always use left over roast beef, sliced thin.  It's a family favorite, serve with fries occasionally. I also add Dijon mustard for a bit of tang.

I use one can of beef consommé and one can of French onion soup, and no water. It makes a great dipping sauce. I cook it awhile to reduce it more. I want it richer, rather than diluted with water.

Excellent!  I have made the recipe as is, and the last time I purchased rare roast beef from the deli, and chopped it up coarsely.  I sauteed some onions and mushrooms, added the meat and broth to heat.  Both ways were really good and every bit as good as deli/sandwich shop.

This is so good and so easy!!  I use Boars Head London broil rare deli meat.  I add Italian seasoning and garlic powder to the consomme.  Toast the rolls for 5 minutes prior to building the  sandwiches and  it makes all the difference.  Such a quick easy meal that everyone loves!!

Super easy and delicious! I'd like to play with the basic recipe, find a good spice blend to jazz up the broth. Also the provolone I bought was really thick, so two slices was almost too much cheese. Other than that it's a yummy and quick meal!

This is a very easy and delicious recipe. We have used both deli sliced and packaged beef with good results from both. We have also experimented with different white cheeses. My fiance and I enjoy onions, so we often serve with sauteed onions. Perfect served with seasoned fries!

Very easy to make. I sauteed onions, green bell pepper and mushrooms to put on the sandwich. I added garlic and a little rosemary to the sauce. I used beef bullion cubes and water. Turned out good. I don't know if it was the kind of bread I used but it was very filling.

This recipe was delicious.  I bought 1 1/2 lbs of the roast beef and added Lipton onion soup mix to the broth.  A nice flavor!

I didn’t have time to cook a whole roast and these looked just as good anyway!  Hubby couldn’t locate beef consommé in the store so I reduced some beef broth with added beef bouillon.  Great sandwich, will enjoy again, thanks writergirl!

Loved it! I used French bread instead and it was crispy on the outside. I also used the low sodium broth and it was just as good if not better.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was so easy, quick, and inexpensive. A few things to note (none of these changes were used in rating this recipe)-  I couldn't find beef consommé at the store, so I bought beef broth with the intention of adding some beef bouillon to it once home, only to find out I was out of bouillon.  Despite adding onion powder, garlic powder, and some black pepper, the broth was still a little too bland for me.  So I would encourage making sure you start off with the consommé (or at least add a little bouillon) if you like a stronger broth flavor.  Like other reviewers suggested, I toasted my bread before hand and didn't have any issues with the rolls getting soggy.  I also used swiss instead of provolone (personal preference).  

The only thing that kept this recipe from being 5 stars was the fact that heating the meat in the broth both dried out and toughened it.  Dipping the sandwich made it moist once more but I could still notice a texture difference in the meat.  (Perhaps I left it in the broth too long or at too high a temp?)  

I will definitely make this again but with the stronger broth and possibly some grilled onions. Thanks for the recipe!

So easy and my family loves this.  We always sauté onions and mushrooms to add to the sandwich.  Delicious!  UPDATE on 11/5:  Last time I made this, I made a horseradish mayo to put on the roll and it took this to a new level.

I loved it! This was easy and amazing! The beef consomme  is just a stronger beef broth and should be beside the reg cans of beef broth! I added a can of French onion soup and it gave it a bang!!! I also used swiss I thought it would give more flavor! So EASY and so yummy! It's also HUSBAND APPROVED!!!!!! :D (he also said better than arby's)

The bread you use is key, also the au jus. We buy a long loaf of french bread to use when we make these, and we also use 'Johnny's Au Jus' mix which makes these taste restaurant quality. Have made these MANY times.

This was delicious! It was so quick and easy to prepare, which was perfect for our family's busy schedule. Based on the suggestion of others, I added some garlic powder to the au jus, and I'm glad I did. It added just a kick of flavor. I also sauteed some onions to go on the sandwiches, which I will definitely repeat in the future.

I gave this 4 stars because it was good, but it was nothing to write home about. Not sure what this is missing, but it needed some extra flavor.

This so easy to make and tastes great. Its not as good as my slow cooker recipe but it wins on ease and time. My hubby loved it and is excited that I can now make this dish more often.

This recipe is pure genius.  Really.  I was skeptical, as I love a Chicago-style Italian beef - this is comparable.  SO easy.  You literally cannot screw this up. And it's ready in ten minutes. For a klutz like me that is important.  You'll be surprised how good the deli roast beef is prepared like this - follow the suggestions for seasoning the broth.  I added onion powder, garlic powder and oregano.  One of the popular slow cooker beef recipes used dried Italian dressing and onion soup mixes to season - I'm going to try that next time.

This was such a hit with the family! It was so easy and quick. The only change I made was substituting onion rolls for hoagie rolls and I added a chunk of onion and a couple of smashed garlic cloves to the consomme for a bit of added flavor. One teenage boy at 3 sandwiches. Thank You!

Made this last night and it was fantastic!  Hubby commented that I "went all out" and he felt like he was in a restaurant.  Shhhh...don't tell.  Will definitely make this again.  This was a great, super easy weeknight recipe! Thank you!

5 stars for easy and delicious recipe. I used a can of Au Jus which I found near the beef broth section of the grocery store. I also added a beef bouillon with the water and it was perfect. Next time I think i will add a little sauted onion.

I made this recipe, I thought it was ok and I can see what I did wrong I used beef broth thinking is was the same as consomme, was I wrong. I added water too, it lacked flavor I think this was my problem.  I should have read reviews first, well there is always a next time..

This was so good & so easy! I added a little bit of onion powder & garlic powder to the consomme. Aside from that, I didn't change a thing. I found really good hoagie rolls at our local grocery store and I'll definitely be making these again.

Very good and very easy.  I made the recipe as submitted and the results were excellent for something that takes so little time.  The only thing I might change next time is to reduce the amount of water added to the consomme for a bit richer flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

Also, I bought fresh hoagie rolls from the bakery and did NOT have the problems of them being too soggy as other people have stated.

This is a great recipe, I make it all the time!  Though it is very salty already, i add onion and garlic salt to taste and leave out the cheese.  I found a thick crusty sub bun to use and it's perfect!  Thanks for the recipe.

My sister taught me something very similar when I first got married and started cooking.  One 2-3 lb roast, one can beef consume, one package italian dressing seasoning and a crock pot for 5-7 hours.  Meat falls apart and then you put it on a roll with any kind of cheese you like...serve with broth for dipping.  Easy and delicious.

This sandwich was delicious! My husband and I were totally amazed at the ease and the flavors. We both work full time and take care of a house and yard so we're always looking for something fast and tasty. Like a few other readers, I omitted the water from the consomme and added garlic powder and onion powder to it. Other that that we followed it exactly. Served deli macaroni salad on the side. Not the healthiest dinner but totally delicious for a once in awhile treat. This will go into our "quick to fix" file when we can't think of anything for dinner. Thanks for a great recipe!

Ok, this was a great meal! Fast to make, and very tasty to boot! My only problem was I didn't make enough broth... but that's because I forgot to use the water, but the consomme broth was still very tasty and effective!  Hm, one other comment... the bread ended up a smidgeon soggy in one or two places after cooking. I think I'd lightly toast the buns next time to make it a bit less likely for the broth remnants to soak all the way through the bread while cooking. It was only in a couple spots though.  So, if you want something delicious, easy, and fast, this will hit the bill!

I loved this recipe. I got the packaged au jus mix and used that instead of the conomme. I did not bake it, because my husband likes cold buns. I also put some carmelized onions on top...yummmmy

So good! My family really enjoyed these sandwiches. I added just a little garlic powder and some dried oregano to the beef broth & it was an awesome addition.

Yummy! I used Au Jus from a packet then added the roast beef to the sauce to let it soak i up. I buttered and grilled the rolls. A big hit, even for my family who doesn't like french dips normally.

So easy and finally a  recipe my whole family liked; a rarity in itself. I used a can of beef stock and added a pack of Lipton onion mushroom soup mix. I let the roast beef simmer on low for about 10 minutes. I would add some grilled onions on top next time. All in all, so yummy.

My husband absolutely loved this! He even ate all the leftovers. I personally dont care for it, but I dont like roast beef too much. Literally took me 15 minutes to put together which was nice for a busy mom.

Good but not quite great. I think I'll follow some of the suggestions to saute some peppers and onions  to add a bit more flavor next time.

This recipe was super easy and quick. I used dutch crust buns and cheddar cheese and toasted the cheese on them first in the oven, then I placed on the warmed up roast beef and a little more cheese. Served with a Caesar salad. Thanks for the good idea!

Wow, thank you writergirl!  How happy I am to find such an easy recipe that tastes great!  I love french dip but it is so hard to find a good one, they always seem fatty.  This is a great, "lean" version.  My sister just got married and I told her to make this, hide the evidence, tell dear husband that she marinated and slaved for hours...  then fess up of course!  Will pass this on again for sure :)

I had to tweeked this to make it taste 'delicious'.  Instead of water, use beef broth.  Add 1 Tbps of butter to the broth mixture.  Add garlic powder and fresh ground pepper.  When ready to serve, garnish with fresh scallions.  Don't forget to butter the rolls! *Also, sauteed onions and mushrooms taste great on these as well!

So easy and satifying.  CHANGES: I used mozzarella instead of provolone because thats what I had on hand.  Used Portuguese rolls which came out nice and crispy. Added some fresh black pepper to the dip. Added green pepper to the sandwich.

All I have to say is, "meh."  Yes, it's a great start, but it needs a little oomph.  I sautee a diced shallot with a TBSP or two of butter beforehand, add a splash of merlot or red wine vinegar and finally combine it with the consumme.  I serve it on demi-baguette.  Equally as easy and DH loves it every time, even when reheated. ;)

This was so easy and quick, it's the perfect weeknight meal.  And it was absolutely delicious, loved by both kids and adults!  I looked high and low for consume at the grocery store and couldn't find it, so I used beef broth and added about 1 tsp of "Better than Boullion" to it and it was perfect.  We loved the steak sandwich at Outback, so I used ciabatta bread instead of hogie-type rolls and it was absolutely wonderful.  I would make this again in a heartbeat, and have recommended it to multiple people since having it!

Yummy and very, very quick!  I added some carmalized onion before putting on the cheese!  Very good. Also, used Campbell's beef broth and it was rich and did not need any other seasonings.

This was awesome!  I did put in just a dash of garlic powder, onion powder, and fresh cracked pepper into the beef consumme'.  This was better than most restaurants!  It was a fast, easy, and tasty meal that we'll be making again.  Thanks writergirl.

A delicious and easy dinner! However, I toasted the bread a bit before I put the meat on it to keep it from getting soggy. I also used a gravy packet "au jus" in stead of consumme soup, but they tasted very similar.

Recipe was really good. My boyfriend & I enjoyed it. However it's missing that "authentic" feel of a french dip.

Good French Dip. Definitely easy to make, and it tasted pretty good. You just need to make sure you get the right rolls.

Great idea! Good for a quick meal. I splurged on a more expensive brand of roast beef. Everyone loved it & I will definitely make it again.

I made these last night using leftover roast beef (Beef Pot Roast from this site... amazing) sliced very thinly. I used a rich beef broth to dip the roast beef in, as well as the sandwhiches. These were a huge hit with my boyfriend and his best friend. Thank you!

I love French Dips so I had to try this.  I was pleasantly surprised. This was so easy to make and tasted great.  I love it!  The only suggestion I had was to add some onion powder.  It is a great quick meal when you don't want to cook much.

Add my 5 stars!  Excellent for a quick dinner.  I used swiss as that's my husband's preference.  I served it with corn on the cob and it was a tasty and satisfying meal.

I really didn't need a recipe for these sandwhiches as they are such a food basic but I appreciated the idea.  I did follow the recipe except I grilled some onions and put them on before the cheese... my family also really liked these sandwhiches and I will make them again!

This made such a quick, different meal for us this Friday night. I didn't have any consume, so I just reduced beef broth down to about a 1/4th. I added garlic powder & cracked pepper to the broth. We topped our sandwiches with roasted onions and peppers. As a side we had kettle chips, which were even good dipped in the 'sauce'. We'll be having this again.

The basic recipe is very good, but very bland. Maybe it was me, but I expected a little more flavor. I'll probably use a different soup next time and different cheese. Otherwise, the basic format is an EXCELLENT base for other recipes.

This is a great recipe! I only made 2 minor changes. I added 2 cloves chopped garlic to the beef consomme. Also, I sliced up onions and green peppers and sauted them for on the sandwich as well.

I often find myself scanning lunch menus while dining out for a French Dip becaue I never made them at home.  I wish I had known all those years that it was this easy and could be this good!  This will be a fixture in the rotation.

I made a long loaf of homemade bread for this sandwich and then sliced it up to serve at a pot-luck.  Everyone just loved it!  This is a great recipe for serving at a party or event.  The women at our event loved it and so did my husband so great for men and women!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!

These were delicious! The second time, I used an extra can of consomme, and it was even better. The recipe is fantastic as is, we just prefer a richer broth.  We've had these twice in the past 3 days!  My husband asked if we could "put these in the dinner rotation."  Thanks for the great recipe!

I give it 4/5 for how easy it is. I'd suggest toasting the hoagies slightly before putting the meat/cheese on them. I'd also recommend adding a little rosemary and garlic paste to the broth/au jus to add a little more depth. Over all an easy/tasty recipe. Perfect for the weekends.

This made for a great lunch. I really liked the idea of warming up the roast beef slices in the broth, as that preserved the moisture of the meat (which would have been stripped away in the microwave.) I highly recommend using roast beef sliced from the deli counter at your supermarket instead of pre-packaged lunchmeat. I used Italian roast beef from the deli counter, and it was delicious. I used a can of beef broth in place of the consomme and water.

These are great!  The kids love them.  We fry strips of green peppers and onion and put on them for extra flavor.  I also add minced garlic to the juice and the kids love dipping their sandwiches in there!

Good basic recipe, but didn't knock my socks off. Perhaps it was my roast beef. It just didn't seem flavorful. Onions, mushrooms, and some sort of spread might do the trick. Thanks for sharing!

This was very good and very easy. I used beef broth and I actually made another batch using turkey and chicken broth.  I added some hot sauce to the broths.  It is very important to use quality bread.

Simple, quick, but nothing flashy or spectacular. I season them with a little Season-All & it spices them up a bit. Definitely worth having the recipe on-hand for a quick & filling meal.

These were excellent.  I took other reviewers advice and added mushrooms and onions which made it perfect, without them wouldn't be the same.  Walmart has great white bolillo rolls for this. Good recipe and easy.  Thank you.

yummy. so easy to make.  I used garlic roast beef and put the whole thing in whole grain pita pockets with low fat provolone cheese to make it the whole meal a little more "healthy".  I can't wait until lunch tomorrow!

Super easy and super good!  Might try them on garlic loafs next time...garlic spread on the bread and in the broiler for a couple of minutes!

Very nice. Couldn't find Hoagies so I went with Submarine buns. Followed someone's suggestion to sauté onions and sliced mushrooms and added them before cheese went on and they went into the oven. Very filling - very tasty. Will do it again.

A quick and delicious meal.  Like others, I also sauted an onion and some mushrooms to add to the sandwich. Thanks for the recipe, and great pic of the sandwich!

this recipe is so quick and easy as suggested. i use the low sodium beef broth so that i can control the amount of salt. i added some natures seasoning and garlic powder to the broth for a little more flavor.

So simple, and oh so good. This was as good as any French Dip sandwich I've ever ordered at a sandwich shop! This a family favorite, we served it with a garden salad, yum! Dinner in an instant. My favorite.

This was the easiest and the best french dip I've ever had! I made it for my husband and some friends. They all said it was decilious. One friend said it's better than the french dip she gets at her favorite restaurant! The only thing I did different was satuee some mushrooms and onions with seasoned salt and a little butter. It was optional on the sandwiches. This is a definate keeper.

Thanks so much for sharing!
