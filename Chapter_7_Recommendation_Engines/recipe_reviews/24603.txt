After having brought the curry mixture to a boil, it had become a very thick gloppy glue. I added it into cereal mix anyway, but it did not coat any of it. I melted 1/2 cup of butter with garlic powder and extra Worchestershire sauce and added it to cereal. I also added more curry powder. I mixed everything like crazy and baked it in oven. It came out great! It had really needed that butter. I just used double the amounts on the Worchestershire, curry, and garlic powder. Next time, I will use double of everything and add half cup butter with it until it all boils.

Thanks for a delicious snack treat, Sara. I have made this a number of times for myself.(I'm the only one who likes curry in my house) I love the combination of flavors in this recipe. Being a creature of habit I experimented with this the last time I made it. I left out the pretzels, popcorn, cereal and and corn chips and added a couple bags of those new Frito-Lay "Munchies". Wow! How delish, but very habit forming!

much better than all the other "generic" holiday party mixes.  the spice level can be turned up by using a hotter curry powder.

This is a hit among my friends!  I bring it over to get-togethers and it is gone within 5 minutes...
They ask me ahead of time if I'm going to make it!
I double the curry "sauce" in order for it to cover all the snacks

This is one of my new favorite snacks. The only minor change is that I used about 1.5 cups of pretzels instead of 2 and about 1.5 cups of corn chips instead of 2. This allows a little more coating. 

I also bake a little longer - about 35 mins total - to dry the coating a little more thoroughly.

I followed the recipe to a "T" except for using rice Chex instead of corn Chex (couldn't find corn Chex). There was not enough sauce to coat everything, and I had to double the amount. The flavour gets better the next day. It also smelled REALLY good while it was baking. I thought the flavour was okay, but my family liked it more.

Thanks for the creative recipe! Just came out of the oven and is very flavorful.  I added a little dash of cumin, ginger and cinnamon powders to deepen the curry flavor and give it a more Bengali twist.  It is super addictive!
