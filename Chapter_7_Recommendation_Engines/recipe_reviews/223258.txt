This deserves more than five stars! When I first tasted it I couldn't detect  the spicy heat and then it snuck up on me and slapped me in the back of the head, "wake up boy." The perfect balance of spicy heat. Admittedly I used more than 3 drops of hot sauce and a bigger chili but this is easily adaptable to suit your tastes. This is good enough to slather on anything. Thank you Riverscry for an incredible recipe.
