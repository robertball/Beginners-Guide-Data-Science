Try sprinkling lemon juice over the bananas.  Lemon juice is used on fresh fruit to prevent it from turning unsavory colors.

I made mini banana empanadas for this one. I halved the recipe because I only had two bananas and I still had tons of filling left over. When baked, the filling becomes an unsavory gray color. Though these had a decent taste, I would not make these again and could not serve them if I had company over for dinner.

Too much filling, but great. Very good taste, not too much breading and the middle is so simple - I ate it straight.

Good dough recipe, but the finished product was rather bland. I'd recommend either adding a little banana liquor to the filling or some vanilla icing to the top

This was just alright, it wasn't very sweet so I drizzled honey over it and had some vanilla ice cream with it. I think maybe a different kind of fruit would be much much better then the banana. Ill try it again with apples or something and see how that goes.

So good. I used lard instead of shortening. I hate crust but this one was perfect!

I have uploaded most if not all of the photos so far. I haven are this with a pear and apple filling however! Followed the crust recipe from here but made filling: chopped pear and apple, lemon juice, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and sugar and cornstarch.  The first time I made them they were such a hit!
