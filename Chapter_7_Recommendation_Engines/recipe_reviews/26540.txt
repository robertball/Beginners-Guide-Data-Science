This is really good and a nice way to spruce up regular 'ol broccoli. I toasted my sesame seeds in a skillet vs. heating up my oven - a lot easier. I also used a steam in bag of broccoli to save time. I cut back the sesame oil to one Tbsp. and used low sodium soy sauce. I added some cracked black pepper and let this set for a couple of hours. I served this at room temperature and overall, very tasty.

It was o.k., but not outstanding.  I brought it to a luncheon, and not one of the 8 ladies present requested the recipe.

A very good alternative to steamed broccoli as a side dish.  I let everything marinade for two hours before serviing and the flavors soaked into the broccoli nicely.

It seemed like a real waste to heat up my oven to 375 to toast 2 tb of sesame seeds for 3 minutes so I put them in a small skillet and toasted them on the stovetop. 2 tablesppons of sesame oil is a VERY intense amount of flavor (if you use the toasted asian sesame oil that I assume is supposed to be used). My husband isn't fond of the flavor so I scaled back to 1 tsp of sesame oil and used plain salad oil to make up the difference in the dressing. I think this would be better chilled as a previous reviewer did.

This is very tasty when served cold. I used vegetable oil in place of the sesame oil. Sesame oil can be overpowering. Thank! I make this often!

Made this recipe for a dinner party, it was great and super easy, I actually just steamed the broccoli and served it cold, let it sit in the fridge for about an hour to let the dressing soak in... very good, Thanks.

Enjoyed this very much.  Served it as a warm side dish with honey ginger salmon.  Changed sesame seeds to 1 Tbsp, used 3 Tbsp rice vinegar and only 2 tsp sesame oil.  Needed a shaker jar to get sauce/dressing to emulsify.  Also used Splenda.  Thanks to the reviewers for the comments and to Sara for a great and easy recipe.

We didn't care for this one at all! I followed the recipe and since it didn't say to cool, I tried it (thus it was lukewarm). Hmmm, didn't really care for it so I thought I'd add some green peppers and mushrooms. Still didn't like it.  So I thought I'd chill it to see if it improves.  It got even worse. Now I'm throwing out what's left...which is alot! I forced myself to eat one bowl so I didn't feel so bad wasting it (and to see if the taste grows on me). Sorry Sara, this quick salad didn't do it for me.

This was definately a quick and easy salad to prepare.  I was torn between a 3 or 4 star rating.  This recipe seemed to get quite mixed reviews and I think it is based on whether or not you like sesame oil.  I used 1/2 tsp. sesame SEED oil which is found in a small bottle in the oriental food section and is quite strong in flavor.  My husband and I really liked the salad (which I served at room temp), but my 3 and 5 year olds gagged on.  Would serve it again at a potluck maybe.

I love this dish!  I recommend doubling all the ingredients besides the broccoli for more sesame flavor.  don't be afraid to heap on the seeds, too!  Excellent side dish!

Sorry, my family didn't like this one. I think the sesame oil flavoring was way too strong. It should be cut down by at least 2/3 but probably won't make again.

A wonderful way to liven up broccoli! If you like sesame flavors as I do this will please your palate. I put the broccoli crowns in boiling water, for 2 minutes, then set it aside. I toasted the sesame seeds in a pan over medium heat. I made the marinade and cut back slightly on the amount of white sugar to 1 tsp. I added freshly ground black pepper to the vinegar, sesame oil, soy sauce and threw everything over the broccoli to marry all day in the refrigerator. The broccoli soaked up the sauce and I really liked the slight crunch of the broccoli with the hint of sesame flavors throughout each bite. The slight tang from the vinegar was nicely balanced out with the white sugar. I am glad I did not add the full 2 tsp of sugar otherwise it would have been too sweet for me. This marinade can esily be adjusted and it is easy to put together. I served this alongside Betsy's Mandarin Orange Salad and Asian Grilled Chicken, also from this website.

This was great! This would be nice served chilled as well. I also didn't use as much oil and little more sugar. I also added some chopped water chestnuts for some crunch! Thanks for a great broccoli recipe!

This recipe didn't make sense to me because it only calls for two tablespoons of oil for a pound and a half of broccoli.  I made some changes, and I think it's a LOT better now.  I kept the sesame seeds and broccoli the same, but I didn't blanch the broccoli because the vinegar will soften the broccoli enough.  I also added 3-4 T. of rice vinegar, left out the soy sauce, cut the sesame oil to 1 T., cut the sugar down to 1 T. (or used Splenda), added 1/2 C. or less of canola oil, grated fresh ginger and 1 clove of minced garlic (to the dresing). Then, I chilled it for about three hours or so.  It was still really crisp the next day. It's low(er) fat and really tasty this way.

I just toasted the sesame seeds on the stove top in a pan. Works just as well. Instead of broccoli I used a coleslaw salad bag and added cut up cucumbers and radishes. Very successful results.

This is a nice side dish for picnics but be careful not to put the dressing on too early.  It turns out too soggy if you do.  Otherwise, it is delicious.

This was just what I was looking for; a broccoli salad that didn't use mayo or Miracle Whip, etc. I didn't cook the broccoli; I mixed the ingredients the night before and left in the fridge overnight. It made a perfect light salad at work. Not outstanding- I wouldn't make it for guests or anything, but fine for just myself. I toasted the seeds quickly in my toaster oven.

I toasted the sesame seeds in a cast iron skillet on the stove top.  I was also making a beet salad so I decided to add the beet greens (lightly sauteed in sesame oil) to this broccoli dish. Lastly I reduced the sugar to only a pinch.  The result was quite tasty.

Lovely! Steamed the broccoli in the microwave (4 minutes @ 650W) to retain its goodness. PERFECT!

I really liked this!  I changed a couple things.  I used raw broccoli and I used applecider vinegar because I did not have rice vinegar, I tripled the sugar, and used half the amount of sesame oil.  I also added a couple dashes of powdered ginger and garlic.  It tasted wonderful!  I actually couldn't stop eating the broccoli straight out of the freshly made marinade..yummy and refreshing!

I made this three times, each time being a bit different.  Overall, this was just a 3/5 because as simple as it is, that's how simple it tastes.  I could distinctly taste the vinegar and sesame oil, and it just overpowered the dish.  My third attempt, I did everything as stated, but also added some red pepper paste, hint of worcestershire, 1/2 tsp. of crushed garlic, some salt and pepper, and tsp. of oyster sauce.  Now it's chilling in the fridge.  It's more aromatically pleasing, among other things.  Overall, a simple recipe.

I used raw broccoli and honey instead of sugar. Good flavor. Even better with cooked,cold brown rice - This distributed the flavor better. Next time I think I will add chopped walnuts on top.

This was really good!  Took it to a picnic since it didn't have anything that would quickly spoil in the heat.  I accidentally use fire roasted sesame oil, which of course gave it a little more heat than was intended.  But, it was an accident I will probably repeat.

Tasty, healthy, and quick..both I my husband enjoyed.  We didn't let it sit overnight, we ate it lukewarm, right after it was made. The one issue is the marinade is a bit runny..I wish it would stick better, some reviews recommended adding more oil..but I can't bring myself to add the fat calories..maybe I'll try honey in place of sugar/splenda?

I thought this was delicious, and my family enjoyed it as well.  Very nice flavor, and it tasted even better the next day after the broccoli had a chance to really soak up the juice.  For those that had a problem with this recipe - it was meant to be served cold.  Put it in the fridge for awhile before serving.

This was great!  I lightly steamed my broccoli for just 2 minutes as anything cooked longer gives off that icky smell that has always turned me off of the vegetable and the less you cook it, the more nutrients!  I forgot the sugar-- still great!  I also used half walnut oil and have sesame oil.  Toasted sesame seeds really make a difference as well!  Thanks for the recipe-- I am a new broccoli lover!

I thought this was a tastey side dish that was very easy!  I didn't use as much sesame oil either, it's much to strong.  And I just bought toasted sesame seeds so I didn't have to bother with the oven.

Oh so good! But time sensitive. I made as written, then mine rested in fridge about 15 minutes before dinner; great flavor. Next morning, I found this is not a great dish for leftovers from the refrigerator though, because the broccoli totally absorbed the sauce and changed original flavor.

I really didn't like the sauce with the broccolli. I actually tried to rinse it out, but the aftertaste remained. I wish I had just eaten the broccoli plain! I think the sauce would go better with some cold noodles.

For my taste, the amount of sesame oil listed in the recipe would be extremely overpowering.  So I cut it way back to only about a tsp and used vegetable oil for the remainder.  Also quickly blanched the broccoli and then stopped the cooking with cool water to retain the color and crispness.  Chilled the salad and dressing and garnished with the warm toasted sesame seeds (toasted in a skillet, not the oven).  A different flavor that I would make again, but probably not very often and always as a cold salad.

Not a big hit at our house. Blanching the broccoli (even though I used the minimum cooking time) made it too soft, and the dressing was overwhelmingly sesame. If I made it again, I would use less sesame oil, and less soy sauce.

Same sauce recipe as Nigella's Cold Soba Noodles...which we love, but this didn't really translate well for me. I didn't love this as much as I thought I might, just a matter of personal taste. I'm glad I tried it.

This had really good flavor.  I steamed the broccoli since I prefer it to boiling.  I didn't quite have enough broccoli so I used the remainder of the sauce on some white rice which was really tasty.  Quick, easy and light.

I thoroughly enjoyed this. If only I hadn't been short on sesame oil by 1 tablespoon...

A nice change for someone that likes broccoli. We served as a side dish with home made egg rolls and fried rice.

Really good, used some sliced almonds and sunflower seeds-didn't have sesame seeds.  Also cut the oil back to 1 tablespoon and used 1 tbsp. of water to cut back on the fat-Yum!!

Really good.  I agree with other reviews saying it's good, but missing something.  I added a sliced red apple, some chives and a few handfuls of cashews.  I thought the dressing was missing some sweetness, so I also added a touch of honey.  Since I didn't have rice wine vinegar, only rice wine, I used that and regular vinegar.  Oh!  And I left the broccoli raw -we like it better that way.  Yummy.

This recipe is easy, quick, and absolutely delicious!  I slept through my alarm and recruited my husband to help me prep for a party.  He made this on his own with no help from me.  If he can do it, anyone can!  Our guests loved it and requested the recipe.  It marinated in the fridge 2 hours before being served.

This is EXCELLENT. Simple to make and wonderful aroma. I often use it as a side for picky vegetable eaters. I didn't change a thing to the recipe.

Very tasty recipe. I served this with "Crispy Orange Beef" from this site, and it went very nicely. I love sesame seeds, and they were a really nice addition to the broccoli :)

I liked it a lot, hubby wouldn't try it.  This was real easy, didn't need a lot of ingredients and healthy!  I might try adding a touch of garlic or minced onion next time, just to punch up the flavor a little.

This was a very flavorful recipe and we loved it! To cut calories, instead of 2 teaspoons sugar, I used 1 tsp. sugar and 1 tsp. splenda. Otherwise, no changes.

Eh. 

The taste of the sesame oil wasn't the problem - it was just nothing special. It is easy to serve as it can be made ahead of time.

This was great!  It's always nice to have a change for the typical cheese-and-broccoli.  I'll try this next time with toasted sesame seeds.
