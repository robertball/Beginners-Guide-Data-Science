I just made regular cupcakes and decorated them like this.  It was fun once I figured out how to cut the marshmallow, in fact that was the hardest part.  So, lay the marshmallow on it's side in the palm of your hand and then smash it down with your other hand.  Then take your scissors and cut petals, it may take a few practice cuts and a few marshmallows, but it's really cute.  I also made some colored sugar and dipped the sticky side of the marshmallow in it and I used m&m's as the center.

Oh my goodness. I have had my eye on this recipe for some time, just waiting for the perfect event to make these for.  Today we had a potluck to attend and I decided this was finally the right occasion.  I was a bit hesitant, thinking these would be time consuming and still not turn out how the picture shows them, which is just so cute.  I did make a few changes because I could not keep these refrigerated, and I have made "poke" cakes before, and we didn't enjoy them.  I skipped the step with the gelatin.  I also used a buttercream frosting instead of cool whip.  For the center of the flower, I used a lemon head candy.  It amazed me how much cutting a marshmallow resembled a flower petal.  Adding different colored sugars make these adorable.  No joke, all 24 of these were gone in minutes at the potluck.  I had some very disappointed kids wondering if I had more in my car because they did not get one.  So, next time, I'll have to double the batch.

Fabulous idea, and very easy to make.  I used my clean kitchen shears and it's amazing how much the cut up marshmallow assumes a petal shape.  I decorated the sides of a cake with the petals.

5 starts just for the decorating! I didn't use the cupcake recipe provided, just a regular box recipe. I made these for my 5 yr. olds Tinkerbelle party and they were perfect!  Instead of just bringing cupcakes to her classroom, I brought everything to decorate them with and let the kids do their own. Super easy and the kids loved doing it themselves. All I had to do was cut the marshmellows.  If I had known that the kids would've done such a great job decorating, I would've let them decorate their own at the birthday party too.

I think this was one of the cutest ways to present cupcakes.  I used the M&M for the center and tinted white frosting.  I would suggest using whatever cupcake/frosting combo you like best.  Decorating was simple.

Honestly, I wasn't a big fan.  The cupcake itself had a weird texture...probably won't make these again.

Very cute cupcakes. I made my own cupcake batter but i decorated some cupcakes like the ones in the photo. I gree with the previous reviews - a bit tedious, but i got a lot of complements - from both kids and adults! i also decorated flower cupcakes with pieces of laffy taffy and shaped it into tear-shaped petals and placed an m&m in the middle. Then i sprinkled it with colored sugar. They looked great!

We just made a box cake, but used this idea for decorating the cupcakes with the flowers.  They turned out adorable.

These cupcakes were easy and so fun to make. My nieces and nephew absolutely loved making these. They had fun helping stir the mixture. Poor the jello over the cupcakes and decorate. They asked me if we could make them again for easter for their grandparents. We love these!
