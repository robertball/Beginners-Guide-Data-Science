one of my favorite salads to serve with chicken and rice!  I soften the raisins, by placing in a microwave-safe bowl with about a tablespoon of water, and microwave about 30 seconds.  Then I drain off the water before adding to salad.

I use a food processor to grate the carrots which makes this recipe all that much easier.  This will become a staple at our house.  Thanks!

Yummy!  I was looking for a recipe similar to what my grandma used to make and this was very close.  I think I might add a bit of orange juice or orange concentrate next time.  It really doesn't need it, though.  It really is quite tastey as is.  Even my "food critic" of a husband liked it!

I chose this recipe because it looked like it might be similar to the carrot-raisin salad that I enjoyed at Chick-fil-A. Sure enough, it is! I used light mayo, but other than that, I made no adjustments to the recipe. It was delicious.

Very good, simple and quick. Everyone ate it up. I didn't have any pineapple though, so I just used a few tablespoons of pineapple juice.

I made this because I had a ton of carrots to use up, and was pleasantly surprised with the taste.  I am not a big fan of cole slaw, but this was great.  I used the baking raisins that are already plump, and added some orange zest.  Saved well for a couple of days, too!

A very nice and fresh, side dish that I will make again. It's a sweet(but not too sweet) slaw that would pair nicely with just about anything.

My fav carrot salad always has pineapple in it! So glad to see someone posted it. I've used maple syrup or sugar in place of the honey and Nayonaise to make it vegan before -- still turns out good. If the crushed pineapple seems too runny, go with tidbits.

In the past year, I'm happy to say I've gotten past my aversion to carrots, and as long as I stick to the organic ones which just taste sweeter to me, I like them quite a bit.  I loved this.  I did, of course, tweak a bit for my taste and used greek yogurt instead of mayo (not a mayo fan), and I also tossed in some diced crystallized ginger.  And I had fresh pineapple I needed to use and just chopped it finely.  Th end result is delicious, and it just gets better as it sits!

This salad is delicious and pretty good nutritionally to boot! I made a double batch for a potluck at work and while there were skeptics who wouldn't try it, the ones who did came back for seconds. I'm not a fan of raisins, but I put them in because I know others like them. I just picked mine out. I'll make this again, but hopefully will have food processor next time with a grating feature. Grating 2 pounds of carrots - whew, hard work.

Great classic (think Chik-fil-a) carrot raisin salad taste!  I add a half cup of sweetened coconut and a tablespoon of champagne vinegar, but would still rate this a 5 if I made it as written.  Sweet, flavorful, crunchy, healthy addition to a potluck, picnic or as a side dish for grilled meat.  Drain the pineapple well, because this salad will have enough moisture without it.

way way way too sweet for our taste...would omit the honey and pineapple and add more lemon juice. Carrots and raisins are sweet enough on their own.

Awesome, I made it exactly as directed.  It was a little too "juicy" though.  Next time, I'm going to drain the pineapple.

Good enough for company. Pineapple was good but not essential and I've omitted it on occasion. Since I don't like bloated raisins, I like to add them just before serving.

This was very good I made this with some bbq and was gone in no time at all. Only changes I made was I didn't have raisins. I love the crunch even after letting it sit over night. UPDATE- I have made this several times and everyone has liked it each time. First I want to say to those who say they didn't like the raisins bloated we have added them right before serving to keep that from happening. Secondly we prefer the golden raisins instead. Lastly we like to add either a bit of jalapeno juice or diced one up to kick up the flavor. I also save some time by using the pre shredded carrots or use greek yogurt instead of mayo.

I made this the evening before and found that although the recipe needs to sit for the flavours to blend, overnight was too long.  It seemed to get a little too soggy.  Otherwise it was ok but got mixed reviews from my dinner guests.

Great recipe! I used Golden raisins instead of regular and OJ instead of lemon juice and it turned out great! The only difference I will do next time is drain the crushed pineapple before adding it to the carrots.

Absolutely Lovely! I made it to pair with a roast chicken ("Juicy Roast Chicken" from this site) and my parents who are visiting from South Africa enjoyed both recipes greatly. Thank you for a wonderful carrot recipe. I could snack on it all day!

Fantastic!  I could live on this salad!  It is delicious freshly-made, but if you can stand to wait, it is absolutely scrumptious 12 hours later!  I did drain the pineapple and I used a very fine grate on the carrots,  and because I'm not a fan of honey I used plain white sugar instead and it was perfect...this may be my new favorite food!

I really liked this a lot. I added about 1 more Tblsp mayo, otherwise made as listed. Bonus: Parrot couldn't get enough of it! She's picky & changes her "favorites" often, so I'm happy she's back on carrots. I will be making it often. Thanks, Doug!

Today I used Plain Greek Yogurt instead of Mayo and Honey Wine Vinegar instead of Honey - slightly lighter and a lot less sweet

We were split on this right down the middle - we either loved it or hated it.  I followed the recipe exactly except I did add a bit of salt.  It is super sweet.  I will not make again unless it is requested.  Thanks for the old fashioned recipe.  It did remind me of my grandmother's carrot salad.

I make homemade mayo, but the batch I just made was garlic - I didn't think it'd go well in this. Instead, I used a few tablespoons of the thick, delicious part of the coconut milk in a can. I also used a full tablespoon of lime juice and a teaspoon of grade B maple syrup. So, I made a pina colada carrot salad and it tastes like summer and goodness and I needed it. Thanks OP!

Easy to make for this novice cook!!   I skipped the mayo because my boyfriend can't stand it, and just added a little extra honey. Used a peeler on the carrot instead of a grater and coined a few carrots as well. It was well loved and a nice treat out of ingredients I normally wouldn't think would taste very well combined!!

This is just wonderful.  It's like carrots spiked with a sweet, juicy citrus note.  Even my two-year-old gobbled it up!

Not something I will make again, but it was okay. Added crushed walnuts, which made it better.
