I'm a pastry chef and I use these in my kitchen at work all the time, but I made a few changes to make them even better.  Adding some almond extract to it really enhanced the almond flavor.  Another thing that helps is to melt the chocolate with 2 tablespoons butter and a 1/4 cup of heavy cream.  It still firms up, but it doesn't crack like straight chocolate.

Hi, Just a few friendly tips. My Uncle owned an Italian cafe and bakery. I grew up helping out. I would like to suggest using ALMOND FILLING instead of paste. This will make them moist and is easier to mix. Use almond extract, it makes the difference. Use gel food coloring instead of liquid. Use enough to get true rich colors. omit the apricot jam. In all of my years around bakeries no one used the apricot jam...just the raspberry jam was used.  And last seperating the eggs is an un-necessary step.

Penney, you have saved me a BUNDLE of money since I no longer need to fly back to New York to get these cookies!!  I can't believe how great these taste - my visiting NYC relatives don't believe I MADE them!  I'm not crazy about other reviewers' ideas of cutting these before coating with chocolate - though it's difficult for me to admit there could ever be such a thing as too much chocolate, these cookies have such a great flavor, it's a shame to cover it up entirely.  I've found that, after coating the uncut cookies with chocolate and letting the chocolate firm up a bit, you can cut through the chocolate neatly if you dip the knife in hot water before each cut.  Just make sure you wipe the knife off with a towel so that it is still hot but not wet.  I am GRATEFUL for this recipe - thanks again!

I found this recipe about a month ago and have since made 4 batches of these cookies.  Everyone loves them!  They come out incredibly moist and delicious.  I have made some moderations to this recipe.  First when breaking up the almond paste make sure to beat it very well with the sugar until it is completely beaten if not you will see the paste in the finished cookies.  Second add almond extract to the dough- I would go as much as 3/4 tablespoon, this really adds to the flavor of the cookies.  The spreading of the dough is difficult but do-able.  I take the parchment paper and make it large enough to put under the pan on each side which makes it MUCH easier to spread.  Also, for the melted chocolate on top I add a little heavy cream and butter to make it spread easier and cut without breaking.  I also add some powdered sugar on top of the cookies afterwards which covers any imperfections in the chocolate.

This is one of my all-time favorite and most requested recipes.  I even make it easier by just spraying the pans with non-stick cooking spray instead of parchment paper and the cookies easily come out.  Every time I make these people cannot believe they were not bought in a bakery they look so beautiful and professional.  And how they taste!!  Delicious and super moist little cakes.  Outrageous!

These are delicious cookies and easy to make (just takes a bit of time).  The combination of flavors is wonderful.  They are beautiful cookies and look a lot harder to make than they really are.  I will definitely make them again!  One hint:  I grate the almond paste into the batter.  This makes it much easier to incorporate the almond paste into the cookie dough.  I love this cookie!!

I made these cookies and everyone wanted the recipe!  They did take a little longer than I expected and I did think the chocolate on top overpowered the cookies but everyone loved them!  I'll definately make again but next time I'll put a thinner coat of chocolate on top.  It does make a lot of cookies so that does help compensate for the extra time it takes to prepare them.  Be sure you cut them before they harden too much or like other people said, the cookies will crack.  Another tip, almond paste is very expensive.  Try to find a wholesale baking store to purchase a large container.  I think the container I bought was about 10 lbs and only cost about $22.  That is MUCH less than you would spend in the grocery store.  I freeze it and keeps fine for a LONG time.

I am a New Yorker living in FL and these cookies taste as if they came from an Italian bakery in NY. I have not found any bakeries here that have pastries as good as NY. My husband and I love rainbow cookies and everytime we go to NY we get some. This recipe is great and the cookies come out great. I have made them several times and everyone loves them.

Very cute and yummy. I found them easy to make, just a little time consuming. I replaced the almond paste with almond filling (Solo brand). It comes in a 12oz can, but I only used 8oz. I only used raspberry preserves and added 2 T butter and 1/4 heavy cream to the chocolate. I cut logs out (6 of them) before pouring the chocolate on top. That way I ended up with chocolate on three sides. I eyeballed the food coloring until the colors looked bright and vibrant. To compress the layers while they rested in the refrigerator, I put a pan (one of the 9x13 I used) on top and inside I placed a 5 pound bag of rice to apply pressure for 8 hours. UPDATE: I made these again and used raspberry jam instead of preserves and they tasted even better. I also went ahead and added 1 tsp almond extract and it was great. I added the entire can of almond filling this time (12oz Solo brand) and will not do so in the future. It came out too soft/gooey even though the volume it added helped manage the batter better. I'll stick to 8oz of filling, raspberry JAM and definitely add cream and butter to the chocolate. I experimented doing it both ways (with and without) and without cream and butter, the chocolate does crack when u cut them up. They are absolutely delicious.

WoW!!  A lot of work but definitely worth it.  I would also cut before the chocolate is completely cooled to avoid cracking.  This is better than some bakeries!!  Will make again and again!!!!!!!

These are spectacular! I took one reviewer's advice and added almond extract to the cake, and cream and butter to the icing, both of which worked out really well. I also added yellow food dye to the plain cake layer just to make it look more like a rainbow and it really did make a nice presentation.

One tip--the first time I made these I had a great deal of trouble getting the very thick dough spread evenly over the relatively large area of the baking pan. The second time, I sprayed a large sheet of wax paper with Pam, put it face-down on the dough that I had poured into a baking pan,  took another baking pan of the same size, and pressed the dough down evenly. The wax paper came right off, and with a little touch-up, I had the dough edge-to-edge effortlessly.

Thanks for this recipe. Everyone says they're better than anything they've ever gotten from a bakery.

I have made these countless number of times to rave reviews.  They are worth all the effort.  My recipe calls for greasing the 9x13 pan then add wax pax and grease that, bake cookies and flip onto board the green layer, then spread preserves, then yellow, etc. It has never failed me.

This is an amazing recipe! All of the previous reviews are precisely accurate.  I am an beginner- intermediate level baker and found this recipe very manageable.  Although it is a little time consuming, I didn't find it overwhelming.  The end product is worth every second! Adaptations: I used 12 ounces of almond filling instead of the 8 ounces of paste, added 1 tablespoon of pure almond extract, used food coloring gel, only seedless raspberry jam, and mixed the melted chocolate with 1/4 cup of heavy cream and 2 tablespoons of butter.  The cookies look and taste professional.

These are the BEST!! Substituting with almond filling does make them moister. Adding almond extract makes them more tasty. For those who dont see a difference in seperating the eggs and beating the whites, there is a difference. Whipping up those whites makes it more "fluffy", and easier to spread in the pan. For those who are using regular cake mix (?) or omitting the almond filling/paste - and using different flavors on each layer (??) Your "cookie" may be tasty - but it is in NO WAY a rainbow cookie!! You do NOT KNOW what you are missing until you try this made the RIGHT way. As far as using raspberry only or raspberry and apricot, thats your own taste preference really. Thank you so much for this recipe, I have made it dozens of times. I also made the mistake of giving some to neighbors who fell in LOVE woth them, so I have to make them quite frequently to please all family and friends!! These are not just a "Christmas" cookie, can be made for any occassion or no occassion at all!
I do recommend using only the amount of jam in the recipe, it is not as good with too much jam. The amount in the recipe is PERFECT! I made that mistake the first time I made these. Really, thank you so much!!!

Using this recipe and 9x13 baking sheets makes it very difficult indeed to spread the batter. Increase all the ingredients by 50% and use 10x15 baking sheets. That way, there is a little more batter per pan and you will get more rainbow cookies...a definite plus. And two changes are called for: Instead of using 12 oz. of almond paste, use 4oz. almond paste and 8oz. (2/3 can) of Solo Almond Pastry Filling...much moister; much easier to work with. And grate the almond paste to make sure it mixes well. And definitely add a couple teaspoons almond extract for good almond flavor. And whip the egg whites well to increase the volume of the batter. Jeez, these take a lot of time and are a pain in the you know what to make, but oh man, they are just decadently delicious. And feel free to play with the chocolate coating...instead of semi-sweet chips, melt 3 3oz. size bars...a Dove Dark, Chocolove 65% dark, Ghirardelli Dark, etc. mix them up for unique flavors. And be sure to use a pat or so of butter with the melting chocolate to make it easier to spread. Have fun and enjoy.

This recipe is great, although there is an almost EXACT recipe on this site titled "Italian Wedding Cookies II". The other recipe calls for a little more butter and it is NOT necessary to separate the eggs and DEF add almond extract.  I have made these cookies countless times, and a word of advice to all those having trouble with the spreading: use 3 aluminum pans (usually 3 for 99 cents at the 99 cent store)and spray with ALOT of pam.  When u spread the layers you will see the pam in the corners.  THAT IS FINE. The aluminum allows you to bend, punch, or even cut out the layers. All three layers become perfectly the same size. Also dont worry about any indentations from the pan or a little mush from pam.. you will be covering it with chocolate anyway.  These are pretty close to the bakeries in NYC and always go over big at a party!

I've been making these cookies for years, but with the changes I made based on the reviews of others, these were the BEST I have ever made!  I used almond filling instead of almond paste (the whole 12 oz can), added almond extract, used only raspberry jam (no apricot), and added 2 tablespoons of butter and 1/4 cup heavy cream to the melted chips for the frosting.  The frosting didn't crack like it usually does when I try to cut into pieces.  These cookies were moist and extremely tasty.  Absolutely wonderful.  Thanks so much for all the great tips!!!....an update:  I made these this year for Halloween.  They were a big hit!  I just used orange paste food coloring instead of the red. Now wasn't that a great idea?

This is one of my family's favorie cookies.  I make them for Christmas and this year, I put an easter spin on them.  I have uploaded a picture.  Instead of green, white, and red, I made yellow, green, and purple.  A couple of recommendations:  You do not need to seperate eggs as recipe suggests (add them all in together at once), add 3/4 tablespoon almond extract (the real stuff not imitation), you only need raspberry preserves, spray the pans with a little spray oil or use some butter then put the parchment paper in the pan (this keeps the paper from moving around when you are spreading the dough, and get a large quantity of almond paste online (you will make this recipe a lot and it is a lot cheaper www.nutsonline.com).  This recipe goes together fairly quickly but after the cookies are baked, that is where all the extra time is needed.  I will usually start these three days before I need them.  One day for the baking and building the layers, one day for speading the chocolate and cutting them up, and one day for letting them rest and allow the jelly to moisten the cake.  One the third day you are ready to eat.  I use a half-sheet pan and double the recipe.  These cookies do not last very long in my house.

I have searched and searched for this recipe. I get rave reviews every time I make it. Althought instead of making one batch and splitting into 3 layers. I make a separate batch for each layer. Thumbs up. These cookies are great!!!!!

My great Aunt used to bake these for my sister and me every Christmas and I was so happy to find the recipe.  They tasted just like hers used to.  I did add almond extract and I used a little yellow food coloring for the "uncolored" layer.  I also coated them with dark chocolate and put sprinkles on top - they're absolutely delectable and I can'r wait to bake them again!!

Delicious. A perfect cookie. My daughter & I missed these at our grocer this Christmas so we set out to find a good recipe to make together. We grated the almond paste which I think helped blend easier. After a taste test we decided to add 4 tsp. Almond extract to the dough to enhance & give a richer flavor so the jams & chocolate wouldn't overpower. We will make some adjustments next time to the pan/ spreading technique. We added 2 TBS butter & 1/4 C. Heavy cream to chips when melting. We will make extra chocolate next time in order to cover 3-4 sides of 
each. Really wonderful recipe. Thanks so much for posting.

Really excellent with the following changes.... Definitely use almond filling (whole 12 oz can) INSTEAD of almond paste. Also, add 2 tsp. almond extract. Tip - These cookies can be made (cut into logs with chocolate) and then frozen. WRAP well in Saran wrap and then freeze....simply defrost and cut when cookies are needed.

This recipe is awesome!!  I actually didn't separate the eggs and it's not necessary to do so - it's supposed to be a denser cookie, and it worked wonderfully!!  My husband gave me a great idea on how to spread the batter onto the parchment paper:  place the paper inside the pan and score the edges with a knife.  Pull it out and plop the dough in the middle and spread it out evenly out to the edges that you made.  Then just put it back into the pan and you have a perfectly even cookie!

This is my sons favorite cookie.  I made this recipe last night and it was a hit.  Everyone that tasted it said it tasted like it was from the Italian Bakery, and I was asked for the recipe.  I did tweek it based on other reviews.  I used a can of almond filling, added a teaspoon of almond extract, and added the eggs without separating.  It also helps that I used a stand mixer.  I can't imagine mixing by hand or with a hand mixer.  The parchment paper helps to get the dough out of the pans in one clean step.  I melted the chocolate with 1/4 cup of heavy/whipping cream and a tablespoon of butter.  I will definitely make this again.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Loved this recipe!  Do not follow others advice and use almond filling instead of the almond paste....it adds way too much additional sugar.  Look at the ingredients and you can see that almond filling is just paste with butter and lots of powdered sugar added.  But, do break up your filling with a fork and then cream together very well.  I used a paddle in my kitchen aid mixer to cream together the sugar and paste first, before adding eggs and butter.  What advice did I follow? The addition of 1 tsp almond extract was amazing!  And also melting the chocolate with a little butter and cream was also fantastic advice.  I had no trouble spreading the batter, or reemoving the cake from the pan (although I did spray the pan and the paper with cooking spray) and 6 drops of coloring was perfect. A lot of work but so worth it...delicious!

These are so gorgeous and delicious that I have to give them 5 stars despite how incredibly difficult it was for me to spread the dough in the 9x13 pans.  I almost gave up.  I'm glad I didn't, the finished result is gorgeous and tasty.  I added 1 tsp almond extract with the paste, sugar, butter, and eggs.  I didn't bother separating the eggs, and I added 2 Tbsp butter and 1/4 cup heavy cream to the chocolate chips.  As another reviewer said, make sure the paste is broken up VERY well before you start.

I created my own issues while making these and even though they suffered as a result, I still found them to be delicious and authentic and I will definitely try to make them again the right way! These cookies are expensive in the Italian bakeries nearby and everyone in my house enjoys them (including my toddler) so to be able to make a big batch of them and have it taste the same is great! My problems arose out of doubling the recipe to fit into my sheet pans and then not portioning out evenly (I wound up with a very thin layer of red). I also didn't do the egg white separately because my hand mixer broke and I didn't feel like transferring all the dough in and out of my stand mixer having to keep washing the bowl to get it all completed plus some reviewers didn't bother with that step and it still worked well. Next time I will try it as written but I will make 2.5 times the recipe to fit my pans to make it easier to portion out and fit my pans. Still, with those issues I really liked the cookie and didn't find it to be too difficult or time consuming to make.

Interesting. I have to admit, I tried this recipe purely out of curiosity because I have never heard of rainbow cookies before. I wasn't too wild about the flavors combination. These definitely need at least a day after assembling for the flavors to develop. In response to other reviews, yes these are a bit time consuming but no more than decorating sugar cookies or filling and frosting a cake.  Isn't that what baking is all about...Patience, creativity and adding love? With that said, the most difficult part I found was spreading the batter in the pans. But I just treated it like I was frosting a cake and just spread it slowly with a rubber spatula. I didn't even really need to smooth it with a frosting spatula, it smoothed out just fine in the oven.  I used almond filling because I couldn't find almond paste. I shouldn't have used such a heavy item to compress the cookies because they ended up too flat and dense, my own fault.  I found the chocolate to be too overpowering in flavor and took away from the other flavors of the cookie. If I ever make these again (probably not) I would use less chocolate. Oh and I did add 1/4 c heavy cream and 1.5 tbsp butter to chocolate to prevent cracking and it worked.  After coating in chocolate, I refrigerated for 40 min and cut. No cracks!

I have been wanting to make these cookies for a while but I haven't since so many people tell me they are so time consuming and difficult to make. I finally decided to make them to add to my christmas cookie trays and they are amazing. They really are not that difficult to make. Since I did not increase the dough the spreading was a little work but I greased the pan 1st and then put the parchment paper on top. This helped keep paper in place. These were my favorite cookie growing up and I'm so happy I now have the recipe to make them. I did use almost a full 12 oz can of the almond filling as well as the tbs of almond extract. I also put the 1/4 cup heavy cream and 2tbs butter into the chocolate before spreading. I think next time I will just put the chocolate on top instead of on the sides as well. I think too much chocolate takes away from the almond and preserves taste. I followed the recipe and used both raspberry and apricot filling. They came out exactly like the bakery. My 96 year old Italian Grandma told me they were perfect and that compliment doesn't come so easy from her. Thanks for the great recipe, I'm already making my second batch.

Yummy!!!!I'm from NY and can't find these down here in Louisiana.  I made them in Green, Purple, and Gold layers to celebrate Mardi Gras.  (Boy have things changed to what we did during Mardi Gras before having kids!)

A few things I noted:  no way was one bag of chips enough...I needed two bags.  I guess that's b/c I should have thinned out the chocolate a little with shortening or something.  Also, I would suggest you skip that last "flip" to add chocolate to the 4th side.  Three was plenty.

Another thing...I think I'd save myself the headache and double this recipe next time because that dough was pretty tough to spread out.

And lastly...I used a tube of marzipan (not can).  I don't know if that's different than paste, but I couldn't crumble it for anything!  It was hard as a rock.  My hubby and I worked on it forever, and I still ended up with bits & pieces that did not dissolve.

Anyhow, we're just novice bakers....most of these things were probably our own doing.  Overall......exceptional and impressed every person who had one.  Thanks!!!!  (I have attached my photos too!)

OH MY GOSH!  I am from Long Island...I moved to Harrisburg PA a few years ago...a place that doesn NOT make or has even heard of Rainbow Cookies. Not one bakery. I am Italian, and these were always one of the pastries served on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.  I am having CHristmas Eve this Year, and I just finished making these.  They are absolutely wonderful and I would not change one thing.  The only thing I did was slice the cake to make strips so I could coat the top, bottom, and sides with chocolate.  That way, when you slice them into the small rectangles, the whole thing is covered in chocolate except the inside.  I also sprinkled the tops with mini chocolate chips after coating.  DEEEEE-LICIOUS!!!  And *very* easy to make!

Love this recipe! Friends/Family can't believe it's homemade.  One tip..I melt the butter in microwave and break up almond paste in warm/hot butter.  Makes it much easier to work with and blends to a smoother cake.

Iv been making these cookies for years.  I first found the recipe in a Holidays Womans Day magazine.  Then a few years ago I lost the magazine.  I googled it and found it again on the internet and then found my magazine.  I also dont use the apricot jam or separate the eggs.  I use more chocolate by coating the top of each later with melted chocolate then spreading on the jam.  The top only gets the choclate.  After its all put together I cover with wax paper and place heavy books on top and set in a cool place.  We always called them Italian Christmas Cookies.

The first time I made this recipe, it was a little too dry. I now use a full tube of gel food coloring to give it a vibrant color and add a little more moisture. I also add 2 tbsps of almost extract to enhance the almond flavor. The chocolate alone also gets a little too thick to spread evenly alone, I add 4-6 ounces (roughly half a large can) of evaporated milk to make the chocolate spreadable. I don't think apricot jam adds much to the recipe so use only raspberry jam. When I made it with these revisions, I ended up winning a bake-off at work.

My whole family loved this recipe! I used almond filling instead of paste, and added butter and cream to the melted chocolate. I only left the weight on the cakes for an hour and they still came out perfect!

Wow.  Just wow.  It might be difficult to spread the dough out into the pans all the way, but it will spread as it bakes, and you can trip it up if you need to.  I made these a year and a half ago, and my brother keeps asking me to make them again.  They are a lot of work, but certainly worth it.

I worked at an Italian bakery in HS, and have been looking for a recipe for these cookies- this is it! They are well worth the effort, and we can't have Christmas without them. I do make a simple syrup flavored with almond extract, spray each layer and wait 5 mins or so before spreading the jelly, and they are so moist. Thanks so much!

These turned out great. I didn't have any almond paste, and the grocery store does not offer any, so I made the recipe exactly as is without it...and they came out fantastic. I also did not cut the melted chocolate chips with anything. The trick to cutting without breaking is to cool it enough to keep its form, but not enough to break. You can finish cooling them after you cut them. I tried to add butter and cream to make it smooth, and it came out clumpy...so I used THAT chocolate to make fudge and finished off the cookies with straight melted chocolate chips. I'm the one that takes cookies and such to work and everyone absolutely loves them. My family and friends all gave this one a 5 star thumbs up. Just to clear a few things up...you don't HAVE to use the jam on the recipe. I used strawberry jam on both layers and it was great. Next time, I may use lemon pie filling. Another would be to add different extracts to each layer (strawberry, vanilla and chocolate for a neopolitan cookie)...with the chocolate layer colored brown of course. You can use icing (powder sugar w/water) to bind the layers. The possibilities are pretty wide.

These cookies provide an absolute heavenly explosion of flavour! Almond, raspberry, and chocolate. What's not to like?! I have to agree with other users who advise adding 1 tbsp of almond extract in the batter -it enhances the cookie dough beautifully. Melting the chocolate with the butter and heavy cream is also a must. The chocolate was firm , thick and fudgy. It did not crack at all.
I tinted the middle layer as well a nice peachy orange shade. All together, the 3 layers of pink, orange and green really make for a beautiful cookie.

The only drawback I have about this recipe is that it is tough to spread the batter on the parchment paper in the pan. I'm hesitant to use spam though...

These are my favorite cookies and I always buy them from the store.  They are usually pretty pricey and cheap with the quantity given so I decided to try and make them myself and I had fun doing it.  They are extremely time consuming, so you have to have patience and really want to make them.  It didn’t take me long to mix because I have a Kitchen Aid mix master and I pretty much threw all the ingredients in there and had it do all the work.  I didn’t beat the egg whites in a separate bowl nor fold it in the dough because the cookie is meant to be compressed for a few hours so I didn’t think it made much sense to fold in the eggs. As far as laying out the batter into the three pans, I took a butter knife to evenly spread it. Its kind of like spreading frosting, I didn’t have a difficult time dealing with it, it’s just a different texture and requires different handling than standard baking dough’s (patience). I used ½ a cup of jam on both layers I spread chocolate mix and also chocolate sprinkles all over.   It is best to cut the cookie shortly after the chocolate is added.  The recipe made about $60 worth of cookies and tasted better than any bakery or packaged rainbow cookie I’ve ever had.   Everybody loved them and ate them right up.  I’ve heard that these cookies taste better as they age (2+ weeks) but they are too hard to resist eating until them. I highly recommend them.

I grew up in NY and have been looking for these cookies since I left. I am so thrilled to finally find a recipe and this one is WONDERFUL! It is exactly as I remember. I know many reviews call for leaving out the apricot jam, adding extra chocolate, and adding almond extract - DON'T! The raspberry and apricot are the perfect combination and the chocolate is perfect just on top (don't melt the whole bag - only one cup like the recipe calls for.) These cookies are suppose to be delicately almond not overpowering.  Parchment paper is your friend in the recipe! Getting an even layer is more like frosting a cake rather than pouring batter. 10 minutes is probably plenty long to bake and the layers do not usually brown - they would be too done. Fridge AT LEAST overnight with weights. I spread the melted chocolate on top just after pulling the cookies out of the fridge. Buy the time I had finished frosting, the chocolate was beginning to set up on the cold layers. I cut immediately with a VERY sharp knife and they cut beautifully with minimal to no cracking.

Fantastic flavor and well worth the effort.  I happened to have gel food coloring and the colors for each layer came out very deep.  Although they're a good amount of work, they're not nearly as hard to make as I expected and they look and taste just like cookies you might get in a good bakery.

Excellent recipe that I have used successfully for several years after first finding it here on this site. In fact, it was my search for such a recipe that led me to make AR the first place. I have had to customize it for the size of my baking pans over the years because I can never make enough of them. I have used milk chocolate chips and had better success without having the chocolate crack on me while cutting. No need to pre-cut as one reviewer had suggested unless you wish to turn these into some type of petit fours.  Using and good sharp chefs knife will give you a better cut when slicing. I stick with the traditional apricot and raspberry jams (my preference). I certainly recommend this recipe to anyone. My family and friends can't get enough of them.

Absolutely delicious!  My 13 year old daughter has made these twice, and each time they were perfect!  She had one addition to the batter - 1 tbsp of almond extract and we did add 2 tbsp butter and 1/4 cup heavy cream to the chocolate as others suggested to play it safe.  No cracking occurred when cutting and the consistancy of the cookies was on the money.  What a great recipe, thank you Penny!

These are 5 stars IF you use almond filling instead of almond paste.  I also use a little more jam.  Everyone loves these!

I thought these were really good and something different than I had ever made before. I didn't separate the eggs to save time, I did add butter (2tbls) and heavy cream (1/4th cup) to ensure the chocolate wouldn't crack when I cut them. If you do that you can wait, as the recipe calls for with no cracking at all. I also used almond filling as someone suggested and added a bit of almond extract. I would def make these again for family and friends. I didn't find them that time consuming or frustrating to make with the adjustments. The hardest part was smoothing out the dough on the parchment paper in preparation for the doughs to be baked. My husband had a great tip though we turned our 9x13 pans upside down and laid the paper on top of the bottom of the pan. That way we knew we were lining up the dough properly to fit the pans. Good luck! :) They turned out really pretty too. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I read all the reviews and came out with this:
crumble almond paste, a fork works well, don't seperate eggs,add yellow color to the plain layer, add almond extract to batter, use whatever flavor jam you have, add butter & cream to chocolate for easier spreading (just 1Tbsp butter melted with chips worked well for me) cut with a clean sharp knife.  NO PROBLEMS!  I put multi colored sprinkles on mine before cutting.  THANKS FOR A GREAT RECIPE!!!  I won't make it often, but will bring out for special occassions

These were excellent...just like the traditional Italian recipe my family keeps secret. Just a few tips...spray Pam on the corners of the pans UNDER the parchment paper to keep it from sliding around when spreading the dough. Also, a tsp of  butter or Crisco mixed in the the chocolate will prevent it from cracking when it's cut. Use the canned paste, not the roll...its much easier to work with. These are time consuming but soooo worth it!

this recipe is the one I've been searching for since I was little because my aunt would make these only during christmas.
I love the recipe and the cookies are still soft and fresh even after a week and a half later.
I stored them in the fridge to stay fresher. Thank you so much for this recipe.

These cookies are wonderful! I have to say, we tried them right after I made them and we were not impressed. I put them in the refrigerator overnight, they were amazing the next day. My husband is from Europe, I served them a couple of days later when his parents came to visit and got rave reviews!

I made these but have another recipe I like a lot better even though it is similar. I made these first before I found the other one and, frankly, as a notvery experienced baker,I found this difficult to follow and the results were not what I expected. The jam was too thin, the flavor a little bland, and they didn't look too good either. Then I found a recipe with pictures to follow and uses preserves which worked better for me and adds more butter and almond extract which did make a difference.

RAINBOW COOKIE CAKE!!!
I stumbled upon a rainbow cookie cake once before and I loved the idea. A whole cake just like my favorite cookie! Wow...and thanks to this recipe, I figured it out. I followed the recipe exactly as written only I added a splash of almond extract and I used three round 8" pans (bake for about 7-10 mins. longer, eyeball it). For a chocolate glaze that tastes like the traditional rainbow cookie chocolate topping but can be used to frost the whole cake I used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this website.  The cake will be dense like the cookie, do not expect a cake as moist as a traditional layer cake. If you’re looking for a cake that tastes and looks just like a giant rainbow cookie you will be very pleased. Because of the colors, it's a great cake to serve at Christmat time.

If I could add stars to this I would. I have made this MANY times. I absoultely love it!! I have shipped these cookies accross country, to family, and when I visit I either make these cookies or go home :) When they are all set and done, I cut them into squares and pour melted milk chocolate over them. You can use any chocolate you like, I just like milk chocolate. I have this recipe laminated in duplicate, just in case I lose one. This is a must for parties, or holidays. Very colorful, very delicious!!

This is a good recipe. There is another one called Italian wedding cookies II. They're not terribly different from one another. I have made both several times. You see a three layered cookie, covered in chocolate. Just how EASY did you think it was gonna be? You really have to have some serious hours logged baking before you take on something like this. It really isn't hard to do, you just have to be very patient, and realize that it takes about 24 hours to make properly. 
If your chocolate is crusty and dry, you scorched it. If the dough is too dry, try using the filling instead of the paste. My best advise? Read revues before starting!!

Having tasted these from bakeries in NY, my daughter wanted them for her birthday. I baked each layer in an 8 inch round cake pan, lined with parchment and buttered. Cakes only took a few extra minutes to cook, and proceeded with the assembly in the instructions. 3 8 inch round layers came out to be slightly taller than one regular single cake layer, and I covered it with a chocolate ganache. The cake looked liked it came from a bakery, and tasted outrageously good. I'm sure this will be requested often. Thanks for the great recipe!

Not as moist as the recipe I've used for years. I decided to try this recipe and although it is good, it is not like the cookies I've had. I'm from Jersey so I know what a great rainbow cookie taste like.

So authentic! Tough to spread the batter in the pans but it's well worth the effort. The second time I made these cookies I doubled the batter, thinking I'd get nicer layers that wouldn't be so tough to spread. The layers came out way too thick! Don't double the batter! Also, I strongly suggest adding some butter and heavy cream to the chocolate, as mentioned in other reviews, to make the coating the right conisitency. I substituted the apricot jam for more raspberry jam, as the best versions of these cookies I've eaten contained only raspberry jam. Wonderful and beautiful to look at!

Rainbow cookies have been my favorite since I was a little girl. Never in a million years did I think I would be able to make them as good as I find in the bakery but this receipe is it. I cant make enough to keep them in the house with the kids and my family requests them everytime there is a family party or get together. They have actually passed up bakery bought that others have brought to eat these! I did take the advice of others on here and add the almond extract and to use butter and heavy cream with the semisweet chips it does make a big difference. I let my kids pick crazy colors for the food coloring so they can have fun with them too though. One other thing I do is make two trays. One for the kids and one for the adults. I coat the adults cookies with Grand Marnier before adding the chocolate and they taste great!    I also go to the dollar store and buy little gift boxes and line them with wax paper, fill them with these cookies to give to the kids teachers as gifts.

have prepared this recipe many times - a family favorite - I only use seedless raspberry jam for the fillings. Also to save time, I have used a yellow cake mix (not butter recipe) and it has worked well.

This is WONDERFUL!!!  My Aunt used to make this around the holidays and I always wanted to try and make it.  I made it last night for the first time and it was well worth the 3hours it took!  I will be making it next week for Christmas (last night was my recipe test-run) when my in-laws are here.  I followed the recipe exactly, and the changes I am going to make for next time are:
1)  Follow previous reviews and add maybe 1 tsp extra of almond extract.
2)  Be a little more generous on the jam in between (I only made a VERY thin layer last time).
3)  Add a little more than the recommended food dye for bolder colors. 
4)  I would like to try something new with the pans.  I am unsure if I should just go completely non-stick and no parchment or spray them.  The parchment just moved around everywhere and was so frustrating!
5)  Make your own almond paste.  There is a good recipe on here....just search for almond paste.  Trust me.
Any advice on the pan thing let me know.  Otherwise it is a perfect recipe!  Thank you so much!

Great tasting cookies. A bit time consuming to make. And to solve the cookie cutting problem, cut them before the chocolate hardens.

Although tasty and pretty, it was not simple to make this recipe.  Had trouble cutting the layered cookie into squares without the chocolate cracking.

I made this recipe exactly. But I did make a few mistakes which turned out wonderful! Instead of separating the eggs, I put them in all together, which gave me the advantage of skipping the whipping and the cookies came out light, fluffy, and melt in your mouth delicious. I am part Italian and these cookies are Authentic. Although I didn't use apricot jam, because a comment about not using it for Italian bakeries don't use it. These cookies were amazing, I will definitely make these again. My whole family loved them!

These were pretty and tasty, but TIME CONSUMING! It took forever for me to make the dough, then color it, then work it into the pans. Whew! But they turned out nicely and looked great. The taste is a bit bland. I would add almond extract and maybe some vanilla next time. I added 2 tablespoons of butter to the chocolate and microwaved at 50% power till melted, it spread nicely and did not crack. Cut with a big knife and keep dipping it in hot water to make slicing easy.  Also, I did not have parchment paper, so I sprayed my nonstick pans with some cooking spray and the dough came out with no problem. I don't think the parchment paper is necessary, it would probably make spreading the dough even more difficult.

Very authentic flavor :)  I miss Italian cookies from the bakeries in NY.  Brought a taste of home to my new home in MN.  Go easy on the raspberry jam and be sure to spread your batter all the way to the ends of your pan, it won't spread on its own.

I have made this several times. It is great as written. The only thing I do is add a little cream or butter to the meldted chocolate after I cut them into strips/logs. I put the chocolate on three sides and roll them in chocolate sprinkles. Then I slice them into pieces. Everyone loves them.

I don't actually eat these cookies but I make them for my sister and she loves them! With the almond paste I would definitaly recoomend using canned instead of the hard tube. I also add a dash of almond paste. Where I have problems is the baking prep.  Greasing the parchmant paper always gets really messy and hard to manage but I've been working on it. Haven't found anything really useful yet.

This recipe is perfect!  I have to admit - I had very low expectations because I'd never made these cookies before.  I will never buy them at the bakery again.  Thanks for sharing.

These cookies are great.  I couldn't stop eathing them.  They aren't hard to make just a little time consuming but so worth it.  I made one batch Friday night and another one last night.  Also, the suggestion for doing the chocolate chips with the 2TBL butter and 1/4 cup heavy cream is great the chocolate doesn't crack.  ENJOY!!!!

these are amazing! ive made them with both almond paste and almond pie filling and the ones with the pie filing are SO much better and moister! also, adding about a quarter cup of heavy cream and 2 tbsp. of unsalted butter helps the chocolate to be a little softer and not crack when you cut them. a lot of work, but worth it in the end!  p.s. it makes it a LOT easier if you double the recipe.. the layers become much easier to spread,  a little bit thicker, and a lot more easy to handle.

super excellent!!!everybody loved them !!! tasted better than a bakery cause u don't know how long they've been sitting in the case. Got 40 to 50 pieces from mixture. At $9 to $12 a pound u do the math and figure out how much u save !!                                              TIPS                     Spray Pam for baking on disposable pans and push down the parchment paper on the pans It helps keep the paper from shifting when spreading the dough.  Use a utensil knife to spread the dough and then cringe up the edges like a pizza dough to make it more uniform. I used Ghiradelli milk chocolate chips inside of semi-sweet chips and added chocolate sprinkles. Use a pizza cutter to make uniform pieces always cutting away from yourself. Goes great with cold milk.  Enjoy !!!

This recipe is truly just as good as any bakery. I found all the comments posted to be very useful and I discovered some tips of my own. I used a cake decorating comb acroos the top of the chocolate to give it a nice effect. I found that a pizza slicer worked really well to slice the cookies. I also found that for each layer of cookie I had to use half a recipe instead of a third.

I have made this cookie twice now.  They are fabulous.  I tried to use KAYDELADY's idea with the cream and butter to the chocolate.  DO NOT DO THIS.  Mine seized up and looked grainy.  It would no spread.  Makes me wonder I she is really a pastry chef or a wannabe.  In other words works in a bakery and claims she is a pastry chef.  I did make my own almond paste.  Just search or an almond paste recipe.  I also blanched my own almonds.  Just search for how to blanch almonds.

This is one of my favorite recipes.  As many reviewers said, these cookies tasted exactly like the ones from NY bakeries.  I took the advice of other reviewers and used almond filling and added some almond extract to the dough.  I also added heavy cream and butter to the melted chocolate chips and put chocolate sprinkles all over.  I used just seedless raspberry jam.  I'm sure the apricot would be good as.well, but it really didn't need it. A wonderful recipe. Penney, thanks so much for sharing !!

I found this recipe a few years ago, it was the first time I was making rainbow cookies.  I now make these cookies every year for Christmas,( at my daughters request) everyone LOVES them!!!  I took the advice of other reviewers and added butter and heavy cream to the chips.  It def makes it easier to spread and cut the cookie. One tip, I sprayed the spoon I was using to spread the dough with a little cooking spray, It made it much easier to spread the dough in the pan! Thank you for the great recipe :)

I have just finished making these for the 4th time. I figured I would share my secrets based on experience and other reviews. 
1) Use most of a can of almond filling instead of almond paste. 
2) add 2t of almond extract. 
3) forget the egg separation part, I didn't see any difference doing it or not doing it. 
4) each part is about a cup and a quarter of dough.
5) Don't skip the overnight in the fridge. 
6) Don't be stingy with the raspberry preserves and apricot is unnecessary, but if you love apricot go for it.
6) After they are refrigerated I cut the whole brick in half lengthwise then cut into 1 inch bars that I cover in chocolate on four sides, and (this is key) go for the big guns and melt dove promises for this (I use about a bag and a half) it is worth the $$. I dry them on my cooling rack which creates lines perfect for cutting into individual cookies (my wires only go one direction).

Amazing. So delicious whether you make with marzipan and almond paste. Ive made it both ways a few times and every time they are delicious. I do agree that melting the chocolate with a little cream makes it that much more delicious but the recipe is great

It's been a while since I had these and really don't remember what they are supposed to taste like.  Mine came out OK?  I took many reviewers recommendations and increased ingredients by 50%,  used almond filling instead of almond paste and added 1 tbs of almond flavoring to dough mix. For chocolate I did add the 1/4 heavy cream and 2 tbs butter.  Tried without  via double boiler method and way too thick. So I heated butter and heavy cream in microwave to cream started to boil up and butter was 95% melted.  Dumped chips into cream mixture and stirred until nice and smooth.  Still baked in the 13x9 pan.  I did separate eggs but not sure if it was worth it because I had to stir in coloring (tried folding in but had to stir a little to get to mix) which not sure if it deflated egg whites.  Also, not thinking and trying to even out mix in pan tapped pan a few hard times on counter so not sure if that also let air out.  All in all cookie came out good but a little too dry for me.  I know it's a cookie not a cake but because looks like a cake I'm thinking it should be moister.  I don't know it didn't really brown and so I baked for over the 12 min mark thinking it should get brown edges like the directions said.  "If" I make again, I won't bang pan on counter and will definitely bake until toothpick comes clean.  Oh and definitely add a little salt maybe 1/4 tsp to bring out flavors.  I also only used raspberry filling not apricot.

These are the best, just like I remember from growing up in NY.  I totally agree with the other reviewers - you must add almond extract - each time I make these I add a little more.  I think 1 tbsp. is good.  I add 1 tbsp. of shortening to my chocolate chips when melting - there is no cracking.  I also do not refrigerate them at all - there is no need.  I also leave them uncut until ready to be eaten, unless you are bringing them to someone/something in which case you'd want them cut up into squares.  Can someone let me know why they think the almond filling is better and if it is readily available in the supermarket because I don't think I have seen it before.

Very Similar to the store bought Rainbow Cookies in NY! Although I still think the ones in NY are better! I used a whole Jar of Raspberry Preserves, It looks like a lot but the cakes soak it in and it thins out. You MUST let these sit in the fridge for a couple of days in an airtight container, as with most italian food these get better in time as all the flavors mingle. Also, I did 1/2 of the chocolate and it was still a little to thick. Will make again but will use less chocoalte topping. Thanks for a great recipe!

I will never use this recipe again. If you have purchased these cookies from a bakery you would agree that they are not the same.The cookies are dry and have no taste.  The chocolate comes out too dry and sticky. I don't knw how so many people have given it good reviews.

I made this recipe twice last night to double it and the second time came up with an easy way to blend the almond paste.  I cut it into chunks and put the almond paste and the sugar into my blender.  The almond paste and sugar were pulverized and mixed.  It worked wonderfully and VERY quickly.  No chunks of almond paste at all.  I also added almond extract.  They were wonderful thanks!   I took a tip from a friend and greased the pans then put parchment paper in the pans and then greased the parchment paper.  No breaking and they came out of the pans easily.

This recipe is fantastic. I followed other member reviews and didn't separate the eggs and added a tsp. of almond extract. I also used the almond filling instead of paste. My husband was a big fan of the filling because you would sometimes get a little crunchy piece of almond in the cookie.

I have never been a fan of these cookies, but I tried one and I am now hooked. My husband said they were better than the ones he has had from a bakery. And requested that I now make a batch for every holiday and just change the colors of the layers.

These are pretty close to the cookies I used to get in the NY bakeries.  I did add 1 tsp almond extract and 1/4 tsp salt.  Next time I will add 1 TBS almond extract for extra flavor.  It was very hard to spread in the pans.  I used 3 disposable cake pans like another reviewer suggested.  They were only 8 1/2 by 11 1/2. I don't think 9 by 13 would have fit the batter.  It was hard enough to cover the bottom of a smaller pan.  I also added 1 tsp corn syrup to the melted chocolate (melted in the microwave).  I didn't need to refrigerate it.  It harded up very quickly and was easy to cut.  I did also use a 7 oz tube of almond paste like other reviewer (it is all I could find).  For the filling, I only used raspberry jam, that is what the cookies in the bakery have.  Yum!  Make a pretty addition to my holiday cookie boxes.

Just what I was looking for... and a nice "WOW" factor from family/friends, too!  I did not have the appropriate sized pans to bake the layers in, so I used the larger pans I had and tried to spread the doughs to the mentioned size. In addition, I refused to spend $6 for the almond paste or filling, b/c I had alot of almond extract on hand, so I used a whole bottle (1 oz). All in all, it still came out great!

I added 2-3 TBSP of crisco to the melted chocolate (I opened 2 bags Ghiradelli semi-sweet and used the leftovers to dip pretzels and Oroes). I refrigerated the strips (choc. on 3 sides) for an hour or so before cutting, and the choc. did NOT crack at all.

I can't wait to sample them tomorrow after sitting overnight- I think the other reviewers are correct:  IF you can wait they will get even better.

Next time: I will buy the correct size pans and add a little yellow food coloring the the "plain" layer as it didn't look quite as yellow as the bakery ones. I MAY try the almond paste if I can find it cheaper :)

I tried my first rainbow cookie from a coworker recently, and immediately fell in love with it. Since she got them from a bakery in NY,and I live no where near there, I searched and found this recipe. The recipe was not all that complicated, the worst part was separating the dough into 3 parts and spreading it in the pans. I will add that it is VERY important to beat the egg whites and fold them into the batter, another reviewer stated that they opted not to do this part and that it is not necessary, but this step adds a much needed texture for these cookies!!! Something I would change would be to add more Almond Extract to the dough. I added about a teaspoon as one reviewer stated, but I think next time I will up it to one and a half or maybe even two.  I used seedless raspberry preserves, and maybe I used too much, but it overwhelmed the almond cookie flavor, so I dont know if using jam instead of preserves would be less intense or not? My husband said they tasted like tiny jelly sandwiches and couldnt taste the "cookie" part which disappointed me because I thought these would be a hit. I added shortening to the melted chocolate and had no problem with it cracking when sliced. I am giving this recipe 4 stars, in the hopes that my next batch will turn out much better!!

These are some of my favorite cookies and I was so happy to find this recipe. I was very surprised how very easy this was to do.  They came out fantastic, although I was a little nervous because the batter did not fill anywhere near the entire pan and looked flat going into the over.  When assembled, it came out the correct size.  I think next time I will try and put the batter in  3 "1/2 cookie sheet" sized pans.

ADDICTIVE!!! I'm not a big fan of sweets but this was worth it. I originally planned to make this for a bake sale for some soldiers and ended up eating half the batch. I followed the examples of others by adding the almond extract to enhance the flavor.

I followed some recommendations made by previous reviewers.  I added a teaspoon of almond extract, and mixed a half a tablespoon of shortening in with the melted chocolate for easier spreading. Then I cut the cake into long strips so that the bars were coated on 3 of the 4 sides (which did require twice the chocolate). I changed the recipe by adding red food coloring to the entire batch and using pureed cherry fruit spread in between the layers.  Instead of using 3 13x9 inch pans, I used 2 jelly roll pans, then cut the cakes in half (which gave me 4 layers instead of 3).  So I actually created chocolate covered cherry bars instead, but the flavor of the cake (cookie) was basically the same.  It was incredibly delicious, and really not much work.  I brought it to a family function, and all the cookies disappeared quickly with lots of compliments.

After reading all the commentary, I had to try this recipe.  They turned out beautifully.  Truthfully, I didn't really know what to expect, but even if I didn't do it exactly right, I was very pleased with the result.  They were well recieved and, for what they are, pretty easy to make.  Thanks!

I am a native Long Island Italian girl who grew up eating these cookies.  THEY ARE THE BEST!  I only had difficulty spreading the dough, it was much thinner than I anticipated.  Perhaps next time I will double the recipe and then bake in the three layers.  I couldn't get any of my layers to reach the end of the pan!  But nonetheless one amazing, fantastic, thrilling cookie!!!

This cookie is very delicious. It does take longer than 45 min. to make, closer to 1 1/2 hours, still worth it though. I am from Long Island, as a kid my mother used to buy these from the bakery, my whole family loved them. Since then I have lived in Florida and Virginia, I cannot find them anywhere that taste as good as the N.Y. bakeries made them. When I found this recipe I was so excited, I immediatly gave the recipe to my mother, she has made them about 6 times since, myself, I have made them 4 times. They taste even better than ones at the bakery. I did have a problem with the almond paste in a tube. There were a lot of lumps compared to the paste in a can. Also, slice, then spread the chocolate, before putting in the refrigerator to harden, this will prevent the choc. from cracking. Happy cooking!!!

These were VERY labor intensive.  The jam and the chocolate on top prevents you from tasting any of the almond or anything else for that matter.  All I could suggest would be to use only one layer of jam (either flavor) and drizzle the chocolate lightly on top instead of pouring all of it on.

I actually just have a question...what kind of butter did everyone use for this recipe, salted or unsalted? I am very anxious to make these; although I have my pick of local bakeries that sell DE-LICIOUS rainbow cookies, it seems like baking my own batch might be a pretty fun project. Thanks!!

These were delicious! My kids did not like them, but adult friends did. I strongly urge you to carefully divide the dough into three equal batches. I had one a bit smaller and one a bit larger so it didn't look as nice as I think it should.

I loved these cookies when I was young and my mom worked in a bakery-I used to eat them every day-I haven't been able to find them in years and thought I would take a chance that they would be on the net-and now I can't tell you how happy I am. These are the BEST cookies ever:o)

Took earlier feedback and used about 3/4 of a can of almond filling vs. paste and added about 1/2 Tsp Of almond flavoring.  The dough was extremely easy to work with and the overall taste was actually delicious. Where i screwed up was using baking pans that were too big, so the cookies came out super thin, but that was my fault! Would make again for sure. Oh and I used about a tablespoon of shortening to the chocolate chips and microwaved. Had no issues with reading.

these were perfect! I didn't have parchment paper so I just sprayed the pyrex with cooking spray and they came out with no problem.  My daughter's favorite cookie & she loved them!!! Saves a lot of money compared to buying them and they freeze well too!

I just made the batter, which is now in the fridge for over night. I followed the recipe as written, and I did add 1 tsp. almond extract to the batter, other people suggested this tip. They smelled divine while cooking! Instead of jam I used Solo brand raspberry filling and spread.  I had no problem spreading the filling in the pans.  Tomorrow I will finish my review after I spread them with the chocolate.  Can not wait to taste them!! stay tuned.... Dec. 23,2010, Here is the rest of my review:  FANTASTIC!!!! DELICIOUS!!!  I used 1 cup of Hersheys special dark morsels, 1/4 cup cream, 2 TBL. butter, melted in a double boiler, spread on the cake/cookies like a dream. Will definately be making again soon. My kids (adults) are going to flip for these! The cookies are so pretty. These are not available in bakeries up here in Maine, probably never heard of them,  LOL.  Heck, up here they don't even know what Petite Fours are! I highly recommend this recipe!

Best cookies ever.  I never review recipes but I LOVED this one.  I'm an Italian from NY and these cookies always remind me of being a kid at Christmas.  This recipe made a ton of cookies and people could not believe I actually baked them myself.  I will say I was a little nervous at first because the batter is thick and heavy and I was afraid the layers were going to be too thin but they puffed up in the oven.  These came out beautiful.  I took the other people's advice and mixed cream and butter with the chocolate and also added a bit of almond extract.  I will make this recipe a million more times.

This recipe came out bakery quality and just like I remember as a child growing up in NY!!! I have made these cookies once before, but this time they came out much better. i read thru a lot of posts/recommendations, used them, and created the recipe I have been looking for. I used the almond pie filling w/ the almond paste, almond extract, added a little salt, doubled the recipe, used 10 x 15 " pans, and followed numerous reviews for the choc topping.  Next time I would use a lil more alm. extract and a lil more salt (1/2 tsp maybe). Overall, awesome!!!

Great Recipe--family thought I purchased these cookies from a bakery the 1st time I made them--I use almond cake & pastry filling, 20 drops of red & 12 drops of green, have made with only the raspberry & the combo of raspberry & apricot--have to pick out the larger pieces of apricot though before spreading & I use chocolate melting wafers instead of chips--it hardens quickly--found it cuts best with the chocolate side down on the cutting board--I purchased three 9 X 13 foil pans that I keep just for these cookies (which are actually like a little cake type petit four)  If you don't have parchment handy, lightly greased wax paper also works well--these cookies are a must with my family during the Christmas holiday!

These cookies are great but are very hard for a new baker to make. The whole idea of lining the pans with paper sounds great but the batter must be spread thin and it's nearly impossible to do. I would stick with almond paste because the moistness level it offers matches what the cookies are meant to be at. Without a doubt you need to add almond extract.

This recipe is very good. I've made them twice. However, there are a couple of things that I changed the second time around.  First off, instead of the 4 eggs, I used 1/2 cup of egg substitute such as Eggbeaters or Quick egg.  This helped tremendously in making the dough more "spreadable".  I also added a tablespoon of almond extract which should actually be a necessary step in this recipe.  Aside from that, I melted the butter with 1/4 cup heavy cream and 2 tablespoons butter.  When it was ready to be spread, I used 3 8X8 square pans.  There is really not much batter for the 13X9 which the recipe calls for.  Good recipe overall!  Thanks

Great recipe!! I recommend this one. I made it for my first time on Thursday (well, I started the process Thur, finished Friday) & it is Sunday now & im making my 2nd batch. Followed other reviewers & added almond extract (about 1/2 tbsp) and used 8oz Almond Filling. Spreading it into the pans is, like another reviewer said, difficult & calls for patience but NOT impossible. It all depends on how patient you are & how even you want them to turn out. Mix the chocolate chips w/ heavy cream & butter & it spreads nicely...I used Ghirardelli. Came out great. THANKS for this recipe!

Let me start by saying, I don't cook much of anything and I surely don't bake. But I do love Rainbow cookies like I used to get in NY. They cost nearly $2 per cookie around here which is outrageous and don't taste as good as I remember. So I decided to make them myself. First time, non-baker, and they were right on the money. Everyone is asking me to make them some. I like the hint about adding butter and cream to the chocolate, if you don't it is very hard and distracts from the cookie. These are great and well worth the work to make them. And if I can do it, anyone can. Yum!

I did everything this recipe said to do and it did not work well for me.  The consistency was like cookie dough and was next to impossible to spread into the pans.  Once cooked and cooled, the layers were difficult to get out of the pans in one piece.

Amazing! I followed some reviewers suggestions: 1- You don't need parchment paper. Use disposable cake pans and spray them with non-stick spray. 2- I used 1 1/2 tablespoons almond extract added to the batter. 3- I added 1/4 cup cream and 2 tablespoons to the choc chips while melting so they wouldn't crack when cut. Next time, I'll skip the cream. It made the chips just a tad to liguid-y, almost like a frosting. Most important of all, resist the urge to try and speed up the chilling process. These cookies are better the next day. I'll definitely be making these again - they taste better than from a bakery.

excellent. we used marzipan instead of almond paste and it still tasted delicious. we doubled everything in the recipe minus the sugar because marzipan has extra sugar. Apparently these weren't as sweet as they normally are but I think they had the perfect sweetness.

I bake these cookies in a disposable square pan with the reynolds non stick foil  and have found it easier to remove and it won't fall apart like with the bigger pan. Get 3 disposable pans and the clean up is a snap. The cookies come out bigger but this does not affect the overall taste.  I place 1 1/3 cups of the cookie mix in each and it is just the right amount.    Add the 3/4 teaspoon of the almond extract as others has suggested. Follow the other reviews with the whipping cream and butter for top,  I finish off the cookies by adding chocolate sprinkes on top.

Just like previous reviews I have made some slight modifications to the recipe.  I put the almond paste in the food processor with the sugar and pulse it and then process on full until it is all completely broken up and incorporated well with the sugar.

Adding 1 tsp. pure almond extract to the recipe makes quite a taste difference.

The spreading of the dough onto the pans is the most frustrating part.  I put a moist paper towel onto the baking sheet under the parchment which holds it in place while spreading the dough.  This works quite well.  Just remember to remove it prior to baking.  Also dot the dough around the edge of the pan (extra near the corners) as much as you can and spread it towards the center.  Increasing the volume of recipe would give you more dough to work with, but with patience the layers come out nice and thin as intended.

In addition I apply a thin coating of melted chocolate to the bottom (invert layers after chilling and apply chocolate and cover with wax paper and turn over and then add the chocolate to the top. I also add chocolate jimmies to the top (very quickly before the chocolate sets).

Enjoy!

Excellent!  Per other reviewer's suggestions, I grated the almond paste and added 1 tsp. almond extract to the dough.  I also followed another reviewer's suggestion and added 2 tbsp. butter and 1/4 C heavy cream to the chocolate. I had no problem spreading the dough and the chocolate spread and set well and didn't crack or fall off when I cut the cookies.  I have had these cookies from many bakeries and these are as good as or better than any I have had.  Thanks for the recipe!!!!

This is my husband's favorite cookie and he is always disappointed by the ones I buy him from bakeries here in NJ.  I made them for this Valentines Day and he loved them. They made a beautiful presentation. They are extremely time consuming though, it took me 2 hours just to get up to the baking part and I am an experienced baker.  The most stressful part is spreading the batter into the three pans.  The next time I will draw a template of the bottom of the pan on the parchment paper and spread the batter on the parchment on the counter and then I will cut around the paper so it fits in the pan. I used the canned Solo almond paste, it was about $4.00/can. It was moist and mixed nicely in the stand mixer on high, no need to unclump with a fork. I used warmed seedless raspberry jam on both layers and I used less chocolate mixed with a pat of butter so the top would be a thin layer. I only covered the top in chocolate and I'm glad I did b/c it almost overwhelmed the almond flavor.  They kept nice and moist for a week and I never had a problem with the chocolate cracking. I only refrigerated the weighted pans for 3 hours, you can wait 8hrs or overnight if you'd like, but it isn't necessary.  I will save this recipe for holidays and special occasions because of the time factor. They were quite delicious though.

This is a terrific recipe!  I made it the first time exactly as instructed, and loved it! I did have some trouble spreading the dough in the pan, but as long as the top layer is smooth, don't worry so much about the others since they won't show anyway.  

I also wanted to share that I made the recipe again a few days later with some changes: I colored the whole batch of dough (I used red) and just divided in half and baked. I layered with cherry jam and weighted it down in the fridge overnight.  I added a few tablespoons of butter to the melted chocolate to make it spread easier, and spread that thinly over the top and chilled.  The result was a delicious cherry, almond, chocolate cookie that was awesome! Not the traditional rainbow, but a really good cookie!

These flavor of these cookies is perfect.  Watch out local bakeries!  I made them for the holidays this year and they were a big hit.  I found that spreading the dough into the pans was probably the hardest part, but otherwise this recipe was not difficult.  The chocolate did not crack as some others mentioned.

I had a very difficult time getting the almond paste to cream into the rest of the dough.  Overall, I would not say it was easy to make, and yet they did not fly off the tray at the baby shower where I brought these.  I ended up putting quite a few in the freezer because I had so many leftover.  I did like the taste though, but do not think I would make this again unfortunately.

Incredible recipe for an exquisite cookie!  Like everyone else, I was only able to purchase these on the East coast in specialty bakeries.  I tried this recipe for an office cookie exchange - it won rave reviews!  Such an easy and impressive cookie that I  made 4 batches for holiday gifts.

I also coated not only the top but the sides of the cookie bars as well before slicing to create a box-like effect.

Fun to make!  To make sure I got even portions of dough, I weighed the whole batch and then divided it into 10 parts.  When it was time to roll the dough out, I cut pices of paper for patterns.  I put the paper under wax paper and then rolled the dough to cover the paper.  These were much easier to make than I had imagined.

While trying to spread the dough, I was cussing because it was such a pain, and I swore if I ever got through the ordeal, I would never do it again. But after they were done and I tasted them... ooh-la-la, definitely worth the struggle and they will be my go-to Christmas cookies from now on!

I loved this recipe. If you don't have almond paste, peanut butter makes a good substitute. The uncolored layer will be brown, and they will obviously be peanut flavored, but they're still delicious that way. This is a perfect recipe for Saint Patty's day if you're tired of soda bread. You can even make a pot-o'-gold! Again, I LOVED this recipe.

I just made these and they came out great.  I opted to only use raspberry jelly (only because I do not like apricot) and they came out great.  I did take the suggestion to add 1/4 cup of heavy cream and 2 TBSP of butter to make the chocolate easier to cut through once cooled. Thanks for the easy to follow recipe!!

Great recipe! I did like others said. I used almond filling instead of paste and was very easy to spread. I used a 12.5 ounce jar. I didn't separate the eggs and I used red white and blue coloring for July 4th! I also omitted the apricot jam and only used the red raspberry and added heavy cream and butter to the chocolate. I cut the cookies first, then dipped them one at a time in the chocolate to cover the top. CAME OUT GREAT!

i wish i would have seen this recipe before i made the "italian mother" given version. I would definitely add the almond extract and as for the chocolate i used bakers squares and added 1 TBS of vegetable oil when melting, which worked nicely.

These are my boyfriends favorite cookies, so I decided to try to make them for him.  This recipe was perfect...he absolutely loved them and has asked me to make them for Thanksgiving!!  The only thing I did different was I used Bakers semi-sweet chocolate...not chocolate chips and they cut like a dream!

These are always a hit with my family. Great almond flavor, and sometimes I use different flavor jams in between the layers to switch it up. They do require a little patience and time to make, but it is worth the reward.

I halved this recipe, which was a bad idea. I found it impossible to spread my dough into the pan. So I just mashed all the dough back together, baked it for 45 minutes, and ended up with a rather colorful but very tasty almond cake. I'm sure if I'd done the whole recipe my rainbow cookies would have turned out properly.

These are one of my favorite cookies EVER! While they are time consuming, the end result is way worth it. I also add some heavy cream and butter to the chocolate to make sort of a ganache, so it sets up nicely, but when I cut into them the chocolate doesn't crack. These are absolutely divine! :)

I have wanted to make rainbow cookies for years and finally tried it with this recipe.  They came out good and people liked them.  Next time I will try the almond paste & extract in hopes of a moister cookie.  Spreading the batter was a challenge.  I cut the loaf into six logs and then poured the chocolate.  I used the heavy cream and butter and they cut nicely.

If you're looking for an easy and fast way to make delicious yet impressive cookies, this is it! When I baked the layers, I did one layer at a time... I had to resist eating each layer before the next one came out of the oven! :)

Great recipe, one caveat I can offer is make sure and crumble up the almond paste prior to mixing. I tried hand crumbling and there were some chunks of almond paste (not a bad thing though). Also I used chocolate ganache instead of melted chocolate chips for topping, and added 1 tsp. of almond extract to egg yolks prior to creaming. Came out great.

This is the second year I have made these, with astounding results! To ensure the cookies came out okay, I cut the sponge part first (after assembly with jam), then dipped the tops in melted chocolate. The results were beautiful. The only alteration I made was to use almond filling instead of paste. It came out fine in the mixer, and I didn't have any chunks. Put an almond sliver on top so people know that there are nuts in them.

This recipe is awesome! I usually only get my hands on these cookies once every three months when I visit NJ, but this recipe is even better than the store-bought ones.  They were time consuming to make, but well worth it.  I melted Ghiradelli chips for the outside coating, and they turned out so tastey, that they didn't last more than 15 minutes when I brought them to work. Definitely a keeper!

This recipe took a lot of time and effort, but the cookies are worth it!  They were so delicious that they won in a side by side taste test(performed by one of my family members) with a bakery rainbow cookie from Long Island, NY!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  :)

Thank you so much for this recipe.  It is so close to the bakery made when I was little in New York.  The only change I made was using half milk and half semi sweet chocolate for the coating.  I also doubled the amount of chocolate and coated the cookies on all sides before slicing.  PS- you have to slice it before the chocolate is fully hardened.  If you lightly oil or grease your knife, slicing is not as sticky.

This is a great recipe.  If you follow it step by step it's not really hard, there are just a lot of steps.  My kids love these cookies, so I make this recipe once a week.  I add more food coloring than specified to make the color more bright and I also all yellow to the uncolored batter.

Very hard to make and time consuming. I almost give up half way through. I was going to give the recipe a 1 but the taste is very unique and I find myself snacking on them. The recipe was not what I expected.

These were a little time consuming but so worth the effort!!!! I used 12X8 aluminum disposable type cake pans and then lined them with non-stick aluminum foil. My almond paste came in 7 oz.which worked fine. All I had on hand was Plum jam and Pear butter and that worked out fine also. I cut them in small petit four size squares and then put the chocolate topping on. My kids want me to make them and use vanilla glaze instead of the jam next time. These are a winner, looks very professional!!!

I have used this recipe for just about every holiday and each time I make them I get so many compliments!  It is such an easy recipe, but it looks like you were slaving in the kitchen.  At Thanksgiving, I even gave some to a neighbor, because this recipe makes so much!  But each time I make them there are never any left overs!

Thanks to KatyDydde and her suggestion about how to make the batter spread more evenly.  I did add the almond extract; I also used 7 x 11 "brownie" pans to make the layers a little bit thicker, also used the suggestion to add 2 TBS butter and 1/4 c whipping cream to the chocolate chips, more like a ganache topping but very good.  These are so rich, be sure to cut them into pieces no bigger than 1 x 1 inch!  Yummy for sure, my granddaughter's favorite cookie recipe!

A lot of work but so worth it.  Use almond filling instead of paste and only raspberry jam.

This was a very very easy recipe to try - my 6 year old niece and I tried it and it was super easy!  I was only worried when my dough did not seem enough for 48 cookies (because I halved the recipe) but then realised I cut out non-thin pieces and my dough needed to baked in thinner.  Anyways - it was yummy with the combination of apricot jam, raspberry jam and chocolate on top!  I didn't have almond paste so I compromised by making a paste myself with the almond powder I had.  SAUTEFLAMBE - thanks for your tip on adding the chocolate earlier and cutting it with a hot knife - great tip :O)

I chose to use Solo instead of Paste, basically because I had it and that is what my grandma used. These came out perfect! Much better than anticipated. The only drawback was that I wanted to eat them all and I won't stay 125# if I start eating these everyday, so I feed them to my boys, who also love them, and don't need to watch their figures yet! :)

This recipe is awesome! I have been using it for the past 5 years and everyone always raves over these cookies! I usually follow exactly, but every once in a while if I want an extra almond flavor I add some almond extract. Thanks for such a great recipe!

It's great! Just like I remember in New York! Butthese arent $17/pound!  A little labor intensive, but most Italian cookies are- but the pay off is WORTH IT! I had a problem with my chocolate "breaking" last time I made these- so I will try the suggestion of adding cream to the choco- THANKS!

This recipe is AWESOME!!!! I personally don't like the taste of rainbow cookies but everyone who has tried my rainbow cookies LOVEEEEEEEESSSSS them!!!  I highly recommend this recipe!  I will use it forever!!!  My only question is if I only put chocolate on the top then it is 6 layers (although the cookie is commonly referred to as a 7 layer cookie).  I would like to know how to get it on the bottom and top without running the look!

This is my all time FAVORITE cookie for the Holidays. I actually ship them to friends and family all over. I got a recipe quite similiar to this a few years back from an old Italian lady and lost it and was lost without it. Came across this recipe and have added a few things to make my own. Thanks for posting this!!

This recipe is fantastic!  I did add some almond extract, used almond filling rather than paste and two layers of raspberry jam rather than apricot, but the cookies came out soft and tasted just right. Thank you for posting this!

I rate these a 3 because they were a lot of work. They turned out very pretty and taste pretty good, but not as good as the effort warranted. For the jam layers I used Strawberry and Apricot. I tried coating the bars both by cutting into sqaures and covering the squares and also leaving in a sheet and covering the whole thing with choclate and cutting. Doing the individual sqaures was really time consuming and actually too much chocolate that covered the almond flavour which I love. I think I will just keep looking in the Italian bakeries in town to find these, or only make them for VERY speical occasions.

Wow! This recipe was just as good as everyone before me has said. I cut the layerd cake in strips and coated it with chocolate on three sides as suggested. I needed to use a little more chocolate to do this! However, these cookies tasted just like the ones you buy in the bakery!!!

I'd only seen these cookies when a college friend got them from a bakery.  I made it my winter break goal to figure out how to make my own.  I was amazed!  They looked just as good and tasted better!!  I use butter instead of parchment paper and they come out fine.  There was so much demand for them that I ended up making them four times in one month!  To ease the frustration of the long refridgeration period and satisfy the ravenous spectators, I like to bake a small pan of brownies along with the cookies.  This is a fabulous recipe!!  It has certainly made my friends and family happy.

I had an issue spreading the batter in the pans. After splitting it into thirds, I had JUST enough to fit a THIN layer of batter in each 9x13 pan. This is my first time ever attempting to make these. I would double the recipe if I ever make again.

followed the recipe to a T, ended up not having enough batter for the 3 layers with 9x13 pans and they came out super thin despite beating the egg whites properly and not overmixing anything

If I ever follow this recipe again I'd double everything

I listened to a reviewer and did NOT separate my eggs glad I did! Doesn't make a difference. I just beat it on high for a few minutes after adding whole eggs. Didn't have almond paste I substituted 1 cup almond flour and 1/3 c. Powdered sugar instead of 8 oz paste Added 1 tsp Almond extract to batter. Turned out great!!

I made these and they turned out really good. It's been so long since I've had them that I'm not sure how it compares to the bakery style rainbow cookies I'd get back in NYC. However, the fact that I couldn't find an issues says a lot. I had fun making them. It was so important to get the cake layers the same size. There's a device you can buy that trims cake layers to the exact measurement you want. Also, as a preference, I added more food coloring drops just to intensify the color. You won't go wrong with this recipe.

I recommend weighing the batter and separating it evenly into thirds for perfect layers. It is hard to spread the batter evenly and so thin as well. I also recommend putting down wax paper on the bottom of the pan. Use a cookie sheet as it is not as deep so you're less likely to crack it. You can lift the layer with your hand and a spatula. Also, you should cut the crusty edges off when you stack all the layers so it lays beautifully.

I made these cookies for my sons confirmation sweet table and everyone loved them, especially the almond and apricot jam tastes. They are relatively easy to make, but you do need time to make them. I bake a lot so I had three baking sheets of the right size ready to go in the oven at once. I did not grease my sheets, but instead sprayed a small bit of Pam on them to help hold down the parchment paper I lined each pan with. Using a thin frosting spatula helped to spread the dough out evenly. The baked cookie sponge/dough popped out beautifully when I flipped them out once they were cool. I put only a very thin layer of apricot jam between each layer, and I found heating it up in the microwave for a few seconds helped spread it easily. I then wrapped the entire cake in plastic wrap and put them in the fridge overnight with a cookie tray on top of them weighed down with a few cans of fruit to tighten up the layers. Next morning I let the cake come to room temperature and then coated them with the melted semi-sweet chocolate. I added 1/2 teaspoon of vegetable oil to help keep the chocolate from cracking when it hardened up. Before the chocolate was set, I ran a fork across the top in a wavy pattern, and then put the whole thing back in the fridge to set. Cutting them up with a serrated knife dipped and dried in hot water helped to keep the chocolate from cracking and the crumbs from the cake from spreading. They’re a really delicious cookie and a real show stopper.

I followed the recipe as is.  Other than spreading the dough, it was easy to make.  The combinations of the almond and the jams gave it an enjoyable cherry flavor.

Turned out great. I did as others advised and used almond pie filling and I whipped they egg whites with about 1/4 of the sugar. I also used 1 1/4 butter, but I think it needs more... Great basic recipe!

Let me start with the flavor was awesome. I added 1/2 tbsp almond extract- and didn’t have apricot jam so used raspberry for whole thing. I used bakers melting chocolate the bar and to me it got too hard once it hardened up and the prices broke really easy- probably should stick to chocolate chips- otherwise I used this recipe exactly as stated. The dough was thicker then what I was expecting and may have liked it a little bit more fluffy- but the layers came out nice and thin using the 13x9 tin- although it was a pain. Flavor was delicious and they are all gone in one night! Def will make again but may look for a recipe with different dough intrusions

It worked out pretty well. The cakes didn't rise for me as much as they did in the picture. It was a very yummy and sweet cake.  I added green sprinkles on the top for St. Patty's Day. This time I can truly say it looked as wonderful as it tasted.

A M A Z I N G RECIPE!!!!!  I have been a member of Allrecipes for years; this is my first review.
As New Yorkers and Rainbow Cookie connoisseurs (LOL), my family and I were blown away when I made them!  Every Holiday and/or special occasion, we buy at least 1 lb of these cookies.  In my opinion, I thought they were great.  But, I  could not believe the responses from my family.  They all said these were the best Rainbow cookies ever!   They thought I bought them from a bakery!  
I only used Rasberry Jam for both layers (thoroughly warmed it, strained it and let it cool BEFORE baking the batter).   I did not use Almond Extract, just the paste, and I did not regret it.
I followed the tip from one of the other reviewers (Oldbaker guy),  in which he said to increase all the ingredients by 50% and it was definitely easier to spread the batter.   I also placed dollops of the batter onto the cookie sheets (approximately 6 spoonfuls per pan), in order to further assist the spreading of the batter.
Once the cakes cool, use a SERATED knife to clean up the edges.  I placed all the layers on top of each other WITH PARCHMENT PAPER THAT WAS SLIGHLTY SMALLER THAN EACH LAYER, naked (no jam) to cut off the edges, then took them apart.
This was my second time making these cookies and I prefer this recipe to the authentic Italian recipe I used the first time.  Good luck and prepare for all the compliments!

I made these.  Reading the other reviews I did some tweaks suggested.  Almond filling instead of paste, 3/4 teas. almond extract, not separating the eggs, 1/4 cup heavy whipping cream and 2 tablespoons butter in the melted chocolate.  I also used solo pastry filling instead of jam, just thought it would be thicker.  They were amazing.

My first attempt at making these cookies was a complete success after making some adjustments (per the instructions of other reviewers---I read a ton of reviews, both on this site and elsewhere):  I used almond filling plus 1 Tbs. almond extract instead of paste; I used only raspberry jam; and I added 1/4 cup heavy cream and 2 Tbs. butter to the chocolate for the topping. Although spreading the dough/batter into the pans was the most difficult part of this recipe, and making these is quite time consuming, I would definitely make these little beauties again.  Thanks for a very good basic recipe.

Love this recipe. I make them and send as gifts to family. Best advice is make in advance a day or 2 before serving.. somehow becomes more moist and flavor sets in better.

This is not a difficult recipe. However, spreading the dough was incredibly frustrating. It is VERY sticky, like glue. I used a spatula and at times my hands. It took quite a while to get each portion spread on each pan. The recipe also didn't make enough dough and I used pans a bit smaller than 9 x 13. They came out fine and look pretty. They taste OK. A bit on the sweet side. Not as moist as I would like. Next time I will try Lidia Bastianich's recipe.

Great recipe! Take care not to over-bake these layers or the cookie will be quite dry. Dough is wet and can be fiddly to spread out; watch out for thin spots when you do. While not traditional, you could brush on some simple syrup for moisture after baking. Some versions of this cookie use one rolled-out layer of marzipan on top of one of the jam layers.

Very good . I took a few suggestions from other reveiwers.... I added 3/4 t of almond extract to batter nixed the extra step of beating eggs separate , made a chocolate ganache for topping and made my own strawberry jam instead of buying because we don't eat it so why buy it...just threw a few strawberries in a pot with water sugar and lemmon juice and reduced it....they came out soooo good...I also made my own Marzapan very simple and extremely coast effective. ...Almond meal, almond extract, egg whites and powder sugar...delicious! !!

I have made these cookies for 16 years.  So loved by my friends and make three batches every year.  I have made them by separating the eggs and not separating the eggs and I'm not finding any difference, so I don't separate.  Biggest tip I have is lining your pans with wax paper coming up over the edge.  After slightly cool from coming out of the oven you can lift up the entire cake with the wax paper still attached,   flip the cake onto a cookie sheet covered in plastic wrap, with Jam between the layers.  This way you can pull off the wax paper and your cake is intact.  This is a colorful impressive cookie on a tray.

Has anyone made this without the almond paste? Since it calls for 8 ounces of it, what should I adjust? I want to make this for a nut free function. I could use imitation almond extract.

My kids like these better than the bakery's!  I took other reviewers advice and subbed a whole can of Solo almond filling for the almond paste, added 1 tbs almond extract and I used smaller disposable pans lined with parchment paper. I also added 2 tbs butter and 1/4 cup heavy cream to the chocolate and used bittersweet instead of semi sweet. I let the chocolate harden in the fridge then flipped the cake over, cut it into bars and coated the back and one side each so 3 sides of each cookie would have chocolate. Once that side was hard I cut it into pieces. So happy to have a true rainbow cookie recipe!

These have become a Christmas tradition in our house that I love and dread. The part I dread is spreading the batter. But let's start from the top: 1. I use a fork to scrape out the almond paste in small amounts into a kitchenaid stand mixer bowl  to simplify mixing; 2. Using the paddle attachment, I do the almond paste and sugar alone (sugar helps grind paste well), before adding yolks and butter; 3. I put the egg whites in a mixing bowl that fits under the stand mixer and use whisk attachment to get those soft peaks; 4. When everything is mixed together, I already have 2 dirty bowls, so I put 1/3 back in the egg white bowl, leave 1/3 in the stand mixer bowl, and start spreading 1/3 to the lined cake pan (I only own one, so I make each layer separately, adding to my frustration); 5. While the first uncolored layer is in the oven I take time to dye and  mix and dye the other 2 batches of dough; 6. By doing each layer separately there's lots of time to cool and apply jam before final assembly; 7. I put the assembled product in a Pyrex casserole dish for storage, because it's bigger than the cake pan, and after its frosted, it has a lid (keeps moist), thrn put it in the fridge with 2 books on it to squish it - maybe that makes mine denser, but also more uniform; 8. The next day I do the chocolate on one side (and I do add butter and cream to make it less fragile, but not a lot, because I do like the frosting to not melt on kids' hands); 9. The next day I flip it and add chocola

Just like what you'd find in a fancy Italian bakery. This recipe is a little more work than some recipes - making 3 different cake layers. I didn't have 3 cookie sheets that were 10x13, but I had I had 1 cookie sheet that size and 2 glass pyrex casserole dishes that did the trick. Used the seedless raspberry jam and the apricot jam, Wilton gel food coloring, and followed the recipe to a T, and it came out beautifully. I love the marzipan taste so this recipe satisfies that craving, tastes great, and looks great on a plate of baking for other people ("you MADE that???"). Oh, and it impressed the Italian mother-in-law, too! Definitely a keeper.

I have been making this for years.  Few things different I use almond filling and I do not separate the eggs.     This time I was short one egg  so I substituted 1 egg for 1/4 cup applesauce since I had sweet applesauce I cut the sugar by 1/4 cup.   They came out great.  I added 2 tablespoons of butt and 1/4 cup heavy cream when melting the chocolate as another reviewer suggested.

I'm a transplant from New York to North Carolina and this recipe tastes just like home! My Grandmother used to go into the city and get these. I used the suggestions in the reviews this time and the last time I made them. My sister loves these, they're her favorite and I'm glad I can make them for her!

I have made these many times now and they are always a hit. I like to make a double batch because one isn't enough. Much better than store bought!

Great tasting cookie.  Very soft, moist and pretty!  However, I'm going to make a few recommendations and FYIs based on several issues I encountered my first time making these.  

(1)  Add 1 tsp almond extract into the wet mixture.  This will enhance the flavor.    
(2)  The cookie batter is runny and very sticky.  Try to spread the batter out as evenly as possible.  Another user recommended non-stick spray in the baking pan instead of parchment paper.  I will try that next time.  The parchment paper makes it hard to evenly spread out the batter.
(3)  When spreading the jam on the cookie layers, USE A THIN LAYER OF JAM.  Too much jam, along with an uneven cookie layer will make things messy and difficult when cutting.
(4)  When spreading the chocolate layer on top, USE A THIN LAYER OF CHOCOLATE.  If you do not, your cookies will be destroyed.  My cookies were ruined because I missed a thick spot of chocolate.  I cut into it and crack, crack, crack across the top and the layers separated as I tried to break through the chocolate.  

The next time I make these, I will try cutting from the bottom of the cookie rather than deal with the hard chocolate shell on the top.

These cookies taste great, however I did make some changes suggested by other reviewers.  I added Almond extract to enhance the flavor of the dough. And added butter and cream to the chocolate chips so it wouldn't crack when slicing.  The only things I may change next time is I will try to find almond filling as that was recommended for easier to stir dough. The way the recipe is now, the dough was a bit of a pain trying to spread it evenly on the parchment paper in the pan.  Also the Apricot jam smells gross, so I will omit that next time.

I made this recipe without compressing and adding baking powder and it made a very nice cake. The kids request it for their birthdays and special occasions.

I made these cookies twice.  The first time I followed the directions exactly and they were perfect!   The second time I made a few adjustments simply because I didn't have all the needed ingredients on hand.  I substituted the almond paste for a 12 oz can of almond filling.  And I substituted the flour and sugar for a box of white cake mix.  I also added 3 tsp of almond extract.  I did everything else the same and again; they came out perfect!   Love this recipe and will keep making them as long as my family and friends will keep eating them!

Wonderful! But make sure not to use too much preserves or layers will slide around.

I made these for Christmas last year.  My mom hates rainbow cookies but decided to try mine.  She LOVES them!  She snacked on them throughout her entire visit.  I think it's the use of the raspberry that sets these apart.  I make them again and again; a hit every time.

These came out perfect. I did add 1/2 tsp. almond extract also. I had been searching for a good recipe for these cookies and I have finally found it. Not near as difficult as I thought they would be. Will now be on my holiday list forever.

Incredible cookies which are well worth the extra work.  I really wished that I had read the comments before making these because there are a bunch of really helpful hints that I am going to try next time.

I thought this recipe was delicious and so did my friends and family!  Instead of apricot I spread the raspberry jam on both layers.
