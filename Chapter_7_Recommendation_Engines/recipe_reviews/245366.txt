I couldn’t find coconut cream, so I used coconut milk. I also added a can of pineapple juice and omitted the rum flavoring. End result was very coconutty, I heard several people say they couldn’t taste the pineapple, only the coconut. I served it with fresh pineapple, coconut and pecans for toppings. It was a hit with no leftovers!

Really good. I didn't have an ice cream maker, so I tweaked the recipe a bit. I combined all the ingredients in a large bowl (used cream of coconut instead of coconut cream and excluded the coconut flakes and milk) and beat it using a mixer until thoroughly combined. I then folded the coconut flakes into the mixture. In a separate bowl, I substituted the milk with heavy cream and beat it until it formed firm peaks. I then slowly folded the coconut mixture into the whipped cream (I slowly poured using a ladle in my left hand and folded with a rubber spatula in right hand). Afterwords, I poured it into a container with a lid and put it in the freezer till it turned hard. (It took mine somewhere between 12 and 20 hours, but I poured it into 1 container instead of multiple. If you poured it into multiple, it should decrease the freezing time. Just check every 4 hrs.) Entire family loved it.

It was really crumbly and chunky if I were to make it again I would definitely blend it before putting it in the ice cream machine.

You need to fix your ingredient list. There is a big difference between coconut cream (which is what is listed in the ingredient list) and cream of coconut (which is what is mentioned in the directions). When I go shopping for ingredients, I look at the ingredient list, therefore, I bought coconut cream. I thought it seemed odd that the only "sweet" ingredient was sweetened condensed milk. This ice cream lacked flavor, except for the rum extract. Also, it was way too much pineapple. And you should mention what size of ice cream maker this recipe is for, or the amount it makes. My ice cream maker is a 4 quart, while I have friends with 6 quart makers. I would think that would make a big difference in flavor...

I only used 16 oz. of crushed pineapple and that was plenty for me. Also. I didn't have whole milk so I used one cup of cream and one cup of 2 percent milk and I used 1/4 cup of rum instead of the rum flavoring.
