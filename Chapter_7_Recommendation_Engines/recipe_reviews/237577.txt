Nice! I used low fat cottage cheese and fresh spinach. Mine did take longer to bake, but maybe that's because of the fresh spinach...I will def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I substituted kale for the spinach and liked having more flavor.  I served it as a base for baked gigante beans, tomatoes, kale, fresh oregano, fresh parsley,etc.   So, over a square of the "dip" I added the gigante bean mixture.   It turned out to be a tasty vegan dish!
