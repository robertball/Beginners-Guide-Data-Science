"Excellent" is all I can say about this dessert.  I read some reviews and took what I thought would work best with this dessert.  I used 5 Skorr bars. I used the fat free white chocolate instant pudding but used 2% milk in making the pudding. Use the amount of milk that the box suggests.  I also used 3 boxes of the pudding - 2 with the coffee ingredient and 1 without, which I used as the middle filling. (If you can find my picutre I submitted with my trifle bowl you can see how nice it turned out.  I made the whipping cream and used a layer on the top.  Adding the extra pkg of pudding layer and a top layer of whipping cream you do not have to double the recipe.  Also I drizzled Hersheys Syrup over each brownie layer (3 layers). So the layers went like this: Bottom layer -thin layer of whipping cream, brownie layer, syrup, toffe pieces, white chocolate coffee pudding/whipping cream mixture, brownie layer, syrup, toffee pieces, white chocolate pudding/cream mixture (remember no coffee in this batch), brownie layer, syrup, toffee pieces, coffee pudding mixture, a nice layer of whipping cream, last Skorr bar pieces and syrup drizzled over the top.  It is beautiful to look at too. Delicious and thanks for offering the recipe of this scrumptuous treat!!!

After all the rave reviews for this recipe I just made it.   Having company tomorrow and they like sweet, creamy desserts.  Is there a mistake in the amount of milk?   1-3/4 c. of milk to 2 boxes of pudding is not nearly enough.
Even had trouble putting it together it is so thick.   Very, very diappointed but am sure it is because of a mistake in the recipe.   Has anyone else had this problem.   I will serve it anyway, but have to add some sort of topping or chocolate sauce.   Sorry for the negative comments.   I am certainly not a novice cook.

Absolutely amazing!  I did everything but assemble it the night before our party and it was so quick to put together the day of!  I made a couple of changes by substituting a devil's food cake mix for brownies, and after the cake cooled, I lightly damped it with some Kalua.  The rest was done according to the recipe and it was delicious!  The recipe doesn't make enough whip topping, but next time I'll just double the pudding cool whip mixture.  Great recipe.  Definitely give this one a try.

Added 1 cup of Kahlua after cake was cooled. Let it soak up overnight in the fridge. Followed the recipe exactly from there. Got rave reviews from people at work.

I've made this for a few years now, and ALWAYS receive requests for the recipe.  One friend demands it every year for holiday parties.  So good--I do add a little more coffee flavor to make it extra mocha flavored.  Delicious!

I am wondering if everyone who is complaining about there not being enough milk for the pudding realizes that after they mix the milk with the pudding they have to mix it with the coolwhip as well?? The pudding itself is not a layer. I have been making a frosting recipe for years that calls for mixing one box of pudding with one cup of milk and then mixing with coolwhip and cream cheese and when all mixed together it is not too thick at all. If the directions are followed exactly there doesn't need to be any changes at all.

Super easy and absolutely delicious!! My sister is a novice cook/baker (only in the past month has she become interested) so she's been making dinner once a week with my guidance. She gave this a try and it came out amazing! We used gluten free devil's food cake instead of brownies and I'm so glad we did. I feel like the brownies would have been too heavy. Frozen whipped topping contains gluten so instead of coolwhip we made some whipped cream with a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a dash of sugar instead. Definitely do not skimp on the chopped toffee candy. I think next time we make this (which we definitely will be) we might add a layer of the chopped candy in the middle of the trifle for some extra crunch.

I made this for neighbors on my block for New Years.  I bought plastic 12 oz. glasses.  They were $10 for a set of 14.  I used clear ones to  see the trifle, but with a New Years theme.  I made the dark chocolate brownies per the box.  I used three boxes of regular chocolate pudding and three cups of 2% milk.  One cup of milk per one box of pudding made it more like mousse than pudding and I prefer it that way.  I used a 12 ounce bag of miniture Heath Bars, which was just enough and cost half the price of the single bars.  I chopped them up using a Pampered Chef's hand-held chopper.  I eliminated the coffee all together because the regular chocolate pudding had plenty of flavor.  I used three 8 oz  cool whip containers. And I bought one small can of raspberry pie filling.  Then I made individual trifles in the holiday glasses.  The first layer was brownie, then a layer of pudding, then the raspberry pie filling, then the cool whip (I prefer it as its own layer) and last the Heath Bars.  I repeated the layers one more time. Then I placed Saran Wrap over each glass, and using colored cellaphane wrapping, I wrapped each glass like you would a wine bottle and tied a ribbon around the top, and stuck a mini holiday gift card with their name on each glass (In other words, stating hands off to the kids). I knocked on each neighbors door, wished them Happy New Year, and handed them the deserts, adding it had to be refrigerated.  It was such a big hit and everyone wanted the receipe.

I have made it many, many times, you can use vanilla pudding if you can't find white choc. or don't like it, and I always use low fat whipped topping.  It is always a hit and the most requested recipe from friends.  It can also be made in a 13x9  pan, leave the brownie whole, and make pudding, whipped topping mix and spread on top and cover with toffee bits or chopped Heath or Skor...faster, easier and no one minds that it isn't in it's "trifle" bowl.  Make the brownie according to directions for cake-like brownies (usually an extra egg)

Everyone like this! I followed the directions on the pudding for how much milk to add ( the pie recipe) I could not find white chocolate pudding so I just used chocolate, not as pretty of a presentation, but it worked.

Deliciously amazing!  Everyone was impressed and there was none left over!  In order to fill my trifle bowl, I used a family size brownie mix, 3 pkgs of white chocolate pudding (using the pie filling amts of milk on the pkg),  2 - 8 oz. pks frozen whipped topping,  and 5 skor bars chopped and layered.  Simply delish!  Thanks ADRSEW for sharing!

Let me begin by saying, I NEVER write reviews for any recipe. That being said, this was a show stopper at both of the Thanksgiving dinners we went to that I made this for! The only variation I made on this was to glaze the brownies with Kahlua. I honestly think it would have just been 'pretty good' without that addition. The Kahlua really gave it a warm pop!  The recipe doubles well, as I did this to make 2 of them!  I didn't know what to expect after reading some of the reviews before making this; however, this was DELICIOUS!! I am NOT a dessert girl, but couldn't stop eating this!!!! I really have no clue where some of the past reviewers went wrong with this not turning out well. Everyone asked me for the recipe! I overheard husbands telling their wives to learn how to make it!!

Excellent!

Made a few tweeks... doubled up on the coffee (could even use a triple dose); couldn't find white chocolate pudding, so I substituted with vanilla; used real whipping cream (without extra sugar).  

I recommend not using fudge brownies that are more dense, baked less and can be a little more 'gooey'.  :)

Lots of processed foods in this.. (high sugars,bad fats, chemicals, etc) made my own brownies (quick and easy)   made my own vanilla custard (so simple!)  and whipped my own fresh cream..  delicious !! Enjoy knowing what's in my food and controlling what goes into it.

GREAT trifle recipe!  I used Ghirardelli double chocolate brownies.  Put a shot of Starbucks coffee liqueur in w/ the cheesecake pudding mix (before folding in the Cool Whip) and then shaved Ghirardelli dark chocolate bar on top.

This tasted like what you would expect from a recipe where every ingredient was a processed food. I am in no way a food snob, but even I thought this could be better. The Cool-Whip in particular gave the pudding layer a greasy texture. At the very least, substitute real whipped cream. The pudding was thick and stiff rather than thick and creamy. It was edible, extremely rich, and the kids loved it, but it was nothing to rave about.

Very good recipe, but not exceptional. It was well-received at a pot luck. I substituted 1/4 c. Kahlua for the instant coffee and added caramel ice cream topping between the layers.

Great recipe, but I wish I'd read everybody's reviews a little more thoroughly before making it.  You definitely need to at least double the pudding mixture, it's not nearly enough.  I ended up having to run back out to the store in the middle of assembly and they ended up being out of the pudding flavor I used originally and I had to switch to vanilla.  That being said, if you adjust your pudding amount, you'll be very pleased!

I went with a chocolate theme - chocolate pudding, ghiradelli brownies, and hershey bars.  Everyone kept looking at the empty bowl with sad puppy-dog eyes when it was gone.  Also, I used one large box of pudding - I think it was 5.5 oz., used the amount of milk called for on the box (3 cups), and it turned out great.

Delicious !  Not sure that I am that crazy about the mocha flavor.  Only thing I changed was that I used a homemade brownie recipe and used toffee bits and drizzled caramel topping on each brownie layer as well.  Definitely not enough pudding mix; will double the next time.

I made mine like DEBBIEDH... Except with Ghirardelli Toffee interlude bars because i couldn't find Scorr bars. 
I Love it! It has awesome flavors, fast and easy to make! 
I know it will be a hit on my Thanksgiving desert buffet!
Check out my Picture of it!

This is sinfully delicious!  If you double the milk, the recipe is perfect.  I also doubled the coffee because we love mocha flavor.  I found the white chocolate pudding mix at Wal-Mart.  Instead of using candy bars, I bought a bag of Heath bits, which is cheaper.  You can definitely add lots of the candy bits.  I used lite whipped topping and the whole thing was awesome.

I think the mistake with the milk other reviewers referred to was that the recipe only shows the milk for one box of pudding: Double the milk and you're fine. I did use three boxes of pudding as others suggested. I would have liked the mocha to be a bit more strong but overall very tasty and a big hit.

This was incredibly rich. I think maybe instead of the white chocolate pudding, I will use something lighter. I had to use a lot of extra milk to make is somewhat manageable. Also, I think I will use only one layer of the chocolate toffee bits as well. My husband mentioned not really tasting the mocha, so I would also add a little more coffee next time.

This is always a winner.  I've made it exactly as the recipe states, but this last time I made some adjustments.  I used Vanilla pudding (I liked the lighter taste rather than the White Chocolate) and followed the pudding instructions, just reducing the milk to allow for coffee mixture and some Kahlua.  I then added a bit more Kahlua to taste.  Fantastic!

Holy Moly !  served this on a number of occasions and heard nothing but ...mmmm mmmm mmmmm!!  Took one reviews advice (DEBBIEDH) and used 3 bxs of pudding also.  I used FF milk instead.  made 2 w/ coffee - one without.  I also drizzled caramel topping over the brownies between each layer, used more whipped cream and used HEATH bars (my fave!) Topped w/ layer of whipped cream and drizzled choc syrup and caramel along w/ chopped candy bars.   Not one lick of whipped cream left!

Great dessert! Use 3 packages white chocolate pudding and 3 cups cold milk. Also, add an extra couple of teaspoons of coffee granules. You might need to add more whipped topping too. I used the brownies with chocolate chips in them and everyone loved loved loved this!

If I could add more stars, I would!!!  This is my family's/extended family's all time FAVORITE dessert.  At Thanksgiving I am told to bring this (I triple and quadruple the recipe) and I have to hide it or my cousins get into it before they eat their meal.  Every time I make it, I'm asked for the recipe so I've learned to keep copies of it in my purse.  It even has its own trifle bowl now.  :)

We don't drink coffee, but I still liked the idea of a mocha "flavored" dessert.  So, I used Postum.  It worked just fine and tasted exactly like I wanted it to.  I also added mini marshmallows and extra crushed Heath bar to the pudding mixture.  It was a huge hit!

I took this to my 1st gourmet club dinner last night, and they asked if it could be our staple dessert!!!  A few things I changed...I doubled the recipe, and instead of putting it in 2 trifle bowls, I put it in a glass punch bowl and served it in the matching glass punch cups.

I made a variation of this recipe and included some changes that other reviewers made.  That said, it really isn't the same recipe, but trifle nonetheless.  I didn't have time to make brownies or cake, so I bought chocolate and marble loaf cake, which is moist and cubes beautifully.  Instead of pudding with the whipped cream (I used 2 cups real whipping cream), I folded in cream cheese (8 oz), 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 cup sugar, along with 2 cups mini marshmallows.  My layers were:  loaf cake squares, caramel sauce, crushed Heath Bars, whipped cream/cream cheese mixture, raspberry pie filling with some fresh raspberries thrown in to add some tartness to all that sugar!  I brought it to a potluck and it was gone before my husband could taste it!  My daughter and her friends said it was awesome.  I think this is one recipe where you can get creative and still have it come out tasty.

Easy recipe...used french vanilla pudding since the store didn't have white chocolate.  I used skim milk & it was thick, but ok once I added in the Cool Whip.  I think a little more pudding filling would be better to get a full three layers.  I used six Heath bars, that were easy to cut after refrigerated, for three layers & combined w/shaved chocolate on the top. It was a hit at our lunchtime after-Christmas family gathering.

Very rich. I made this for a neighborhood Christmas party and received rave reviews. I did modify a few things based on other reviews and per my own tastes. Instead of white chocolate pudding I used french vanilla. I increased the amount of milk used to what was on the package directions. And I used about twice the amount of instant coffee as indicated in the recipe. Next time I make this I want to try it with the cheesecake pudding. I considered it when at the store but chickened out (having not read through the reviews previously.) I can't wait to try it that way. I'm sure it will be even better!

I made this and it was gone in 15 minutes at my family function.  The perfect dessert.  I also switched it up for another family using cranberry pudding cake and white chocolate pudding.  I used caramel for the candy flavor and omitted the coffee.

This was definitely tasty (with this list of ingredients, it would be hard to go wrong) but I honestly didn't see the spectacular-ness about it.  It was well recieved at a football party so that was what counted in the end but it didn't strike me a super-special-stand-above-and-beyond.

Great for parties! I made this for a family Christmas and had very little left. I used cheesecake flavored pudding instead of white chocolate and instant cappucino instead of coffee and it was amazing! A brownie mix with chocolate chunks is also good! Will DEFINITELY make again!

I rarely rate something 5 stars but people LOVED this! I made several changes; Whipped my own whipped cream (added about 1/4 sugar), used devil's food cake instead of brownies & used a chopped up toffee almond chocolate bar. I topped it with whipped cream, then the candy.
I served this at a party w/ several other desserts and this one was the show stopper! It's really good! I will make again!

Amazing! Easy to prepare,stunning presentation. I used a  partial bag of Heath toffee bits instead of chopped candy bars which makes it easier yet. Make sure to chill well to let the flavors meld. Can't wait to make again!

Beautiful, yummy, easy, cheap.  All the prerequisites to a perfect recipe.  Made it 2x in one week.  Didn't exactly 'cube' the brownies.  As long as they're crumbled, it assembles fine.  It's a mess to scoop out, but those eating it don't care.  Be generous with the coffee to get any kind of 'mocha' flavor.

Oh My God!!!  It is hard to believe that something this quick and easy to make is so sinfully decadent.  A definite crowd pleaser and transports well to functions too!  This recipe is a keeper.

The result was very tasty! I give this only four stars because I felt the directions needed modification. I followed many of the other reviewers suggestions (such as adding more pudding, more coffee, and more whipped topping) which helped fill my trifle bowl to the top. Many reviewers suggested using more milk to avoid having stiff/thick pudding(they said to follow the pie filling directions on the pudding box) and I did this but actually thought the pudding was not thick enough...my layers didn't quite set and pudding leaked into the other layers. I'm all about a nice presentation so I would have preferred the thick pudding. But that's just my opinion. I will definitely make this again!

Generally a good recipe but like others said I would most definitely triple the coffee amount and the pudding amount. I used 3 boxes of pudding and still felt it wasn't enough. I also brewed about 2 cups of very strong coffee and added it into the pudding. I had to use more milk to get the mixture to the correct texture. Like any recipe you might have to make a few tweaks here and there. It is very yummy though and we are big coffee people so of course I made it with extra coffee. I also used some chocolate and caramel syrup drizzled over the brownies. I think you can really do this in any order that you prefer and still couldn't mess up this recipe.

I made this for Christmas and my entire family LOVED it! I used previous comments and added Kaluha to the brownies and extra coffee to the pudding mix. So delicious, will definitely be making this again.

Everytime I've made this, it's been a big hit. Even when I can't find the white chocolate pudding mix and have to use regular chocolate pudding, no one's the wiser and everyone comes back for seconds!

This recipe is fantastic!  Brought it to a Christmas gathering with girlfriends and everyone raved about it.  I did use extra coffee, as we're all coffee lovers, but other than that, no changes.  None left to bring home either.

A big hit at a birthday dinner-even put candles on it!  Hopefully dropped a few calories & fat with fat-free milk & low fat whipped topping. Added a ring of whipped cream & raspberries to the top just before serving.  Everyone wanted leftovers since it makes so much.

This is a decadent & delicious dessert!  In a deep glass bowl or trifle dish, the presentation is so pretty and makes people think it was much more difficult to make than it really is.  My favorite part is the toffee pieces...the more the better!  This recipe serves a whole lot of people or a smaller group with yummy leftovers that even taste good all mixed together!

I tried this recipe yesterday for a lunch get-together and it it soooooo good, especially if you're a coffee lover like me!  I couldn't find white chocloate pudding in the correct size, so I substituted cheesecake pudding as some suggested.  I also soaked the brownies cubes in about 1/2 cup Kahlua overnight as one reviewer suggested (with cake).  Instead of using one large bowl, I put two layers of each topping into small serving size dessert dishes and topped with some cool whip and chocolate sauce.  Yum!

OMGosh was this ever delicious - AND rich! I didn't have any coffee granules so I had to omit that. It was still absolutely delicious and actually very pretty in a trifle bowl. My husband, daughter and I ate every bit of it in two days! Thanks for a great and very simple to make dessert recipe!

Excellent taste and perfect for a last minute dessert!  I made it exactly as the recipe is listed except I substituted cheesecake flavored pudding, white chocolate was no where to be found.  Might add another layer next time, it didn't fill my trifle bowl.

This is amazing! I've followed the directions for fixing the sauce given by others, and it always comes out wonderful. I have switched it up a couple times like this - At Christmas time, I used creme de mint instead of coffee, and candy canes broken up instead of toffee. Also, once I had left over lemon bars - I used those instead of brownies, strawberry syrup instead of coffee, and left off the toffee. It always goes over well.

I wanted to make something special for Veterans Day for my dad. This was a hit with my family. I used 2 for the 1 oz boxes of vanilla pudding and all I had to do was add alittle extra whipped cream. I topped with carmel drizzels, peanuts, and toffee pieces along the sides. It looked so pretty I hated digging into it but it was worth it.

I made this for a co workers birthday and it was a huge hit! I had two servings!! I used Gihradelli brownies (two packages but could have used just one) and three packages of white chocolate pudding.  I didn't have any instant coffee so I used instant espresso and it was just as good.  I also used Toblerone chocoate instead of toffey and it was really tasty.  It made a ton but went fast.  I would definalty make this again.  Oh- and I used more milk than the recipe called for!

This was yummy. If you love coffee and chocolate...make this! I pretty much followed the recipe...except I messed up and only bought 3 1 oz pckgs of pudding so I used that with about 4 cups of milk and 1 cup of water (the milk requirements are definitely off - follow the pudding box info). B/c I had less pudding, I used less of the other ingredients except brownie. It was great. I let it set over night as recommended. The only thing is, it was kind of mushy from setting. Either use more toffee for crunch or add something else. Besides that it was great! I love the coffee flavor! I actually made it for a get together and gave the recipe to two people they like it so much.

The family loved it!  I added coffee liqueur along with some perked strong coffee to the pudding - I just kept tasting till it suited my taste [3 boxes of pudding with 3+ cups milk].  I also added bittersweet chocolate chips to the brownies.  I did what some others did and drizzled caramel sauce over the brownies but I couldn't really taste it - I would say that it just added calories but this recipe is "loaded" with calories (that's why it's so good)!!!

This recipe is great! To make it a little bit easier, I just borrowed some of my husband's regular coffee of the day, instead of the instant listed in this recipe. I think next time I make this I will prepare the brownies the night before so there aren't as many steps!!! Thanks for posting this.. it is great and makes a very pretty and tasty dessert!

Originally got this recipe (years ago) from my Pampered Chef Consultant and she told me this is where she got the recipe (introducing me to the site). This is a huge family and work favorite. You can easily make the brownies one night then put the trifle together the following day. YUMMY! You can also buy the heath candy bar crumbles in the baking section at the grocery store (to save a little effort), but I do find that these pieces don't seem as chocolatey. Many thanks for a great recipe!!

This trifle is OUTSTANDING!!!  I received tons of compliments!  Like one of the other reviews mentioned, I doubled the recipe because I have a large trifle bowl too.  It was perfect...not to mention beautiful!  And even better the next day!  This is now my most favorite dessert to make, and it was super easy!  Thank you for such a great recipe!

This recipe was a hit!  This was my first trifle.  So easy to make, the ingredients together are wonderful, to make it a bit more pretty I added some cool whip to the top and topped it off with shaved chocolate and marischino cherries with stems.  This turned out so pretty and delicious. I made it for a dessert auction, brought in $55.00.  Thanks.

This is one of my favorite desserts. I don't know anybody who has tried it that dosen't like it. This is also good using Butterfinger candy bars in place of the toffee bars. Makes a fantastic presentation in a trifle dish.

This is sooo wonderful! Make sure you make pudding with directions on box (using slightly less milk than called for because of added the coffee). I had one bag (8oz) of Heath bits and it got a little lost so dont be afraid to add more, or maybe just bigger chunks wouldnt have gotten so lost in all that pudding. I had some caramel topping in the fridge so I added a couple squeezes of that! We ate it after only being in the fridge for three hours, it was great, but even better the next day! The brownies got chewier! Yum yum!

Wow! All the reviews are right, this is an awesome desert!!  I soaked my turtle brownies in Kahlua like another reviewer suggested and it was wonderful!  Made it for my December Bunco group and will make it for Christmas desert too.

Can't complain!  The ingredients are simple and instant, so although it's not '5 star restaurant' quality, it's a fun crowd pleaser, especially for kids.  Needed a quick dessert and this fit the bill.  Economical, too!

Delicious! I used a bag of Heath Bar bits that are already chopped up to save time. I completely covered each layer, using the whole bag. That is the only change I made. My family devoured this. Thanks for sharing.

I have made this several times and have also been requested to make it.  As someone else suggested, I use cheesecake flavor pudding and kahlua instead of coffee, it is so good.

I made this for a house party and everyone LOVED it. I made double the amount of white chocolate pudding and used a bag of already crumbled Heath bar crunch. Wonderful!

I loooooooooooove this recipe! My mother-in-law always asks for this as her birthday dessert and the whole thing is usually devoured by our family in one sitting.  It is absolutely decadent. I am usually unable to find white chocolate pudding, in which case I use vanilla pudding and it tastes just as wonderful.

BEST DESSERT EVER! I made it for a work potluck and they just about licked the bowl clean! I wish I had more today but it didn't make it past noon in the break room! Next time I will add 2 3/4 cups of milk to pudding because the mix was too thick and I ran out by the 2nd layer.  Didn't effect the taste though! Thank you!

I tasted this somewhere else and had to find it on allrecipes. This recipe is delicious! I modified 2 things: I followed the recipe on the box for the pudding which worked out well (because this recipe I think calls for too little milk). And we don't drink instant coffee, so I made a tiny bit of really strong coffee with our french press and mixed that in with the pudding. The coffee after taste is awesome!

Gave this in a trifle bowl as Christmas presents to all my neighbors.  They loved it.  For ease I buy a bag of heath bar toffee bits.  I also use hazelnut flavored instant coffee.  It's a frequent request when my friends come to dinner.

Delicious recipe; however, the pudding was too thick, so I added an additional cup and 1/4 of milk to the puding mixture to make the trifle more moist.  I also used 1 cup of whipping cream with 1/4 cup of sugar and 1 tsp vanilla instead of Cool Whip to avoid trans fats.  Very good.  Will make again.

Wow, Wow, Wow!  I have no idea how this tasted, as I didn't have any!  I sent this with my husband to work, and people absolutely loved it!  His co-workers called me at home to rave about it and get the recipe.  I doubled it, and used a large glass bowl.  Followed the recipe exactly, although I reduced the coffee as I used instant expresso and feared it would be stronger.  It had, I was told, the perfect hint of coffee flavor, even amongst people who didn't like coffee!  I made it yesterday and let it chill overnight to allow the flavors to mix. 
Make this, you won't be dissapointed!!

I made this for Christmas and everyone loved it! A couple of people, including my mother-in-law, had seconds! I could only find white chocolate pudding that was sugar and fat-free, so I used cheesecake flavor instead. I also couldn't decide on brownies or cake (as other people suggested), so I made brownies, but used the "cake-like" recipe instead of the "fudge-like" recipe. It was very rich, but as long as you don't eat it everyday, who cares???

Delicious!  I did increase the filling by 1/3(one more box of pudding and appropriate amount of milk and doubled the coffee.) This way you can use your whole tub of cool whip.  And of course extra Heath bars.  I will be making this again!

I've made this for years and get regular requests for it.  I can't tolerate non-dairy products anymore so I make fresh whipped cream and subsitute it for the cool whip.  The extra 2 minutes it takes to whip the cream is well worth it.

Delicious recipe that everyone raved about at work. I used the family size box of brownie mix, french vanilla flavored whipped topping and 3 cups milk.  I think 1 3/4 cups milk is a typo and maybe that was supposed to be used per box of pudding.  I followed the directions on the box of pudding for pie- 3 cups of milk for 2 boxes pudding.  I will definitely make again and thanks for a wonderful recipe.

After reading the reviews, I decided to add an extra box of pudding.  I used the original amount of Cool Whip, just added extra milk.  I also used a bit more coffee, some dark chocolate chips, and brushed the brownies with a couple of shots of Kahlua after they were done baking.  I made this slightly less naughty by baking my boxed mocha brownies with egg sub and applesauce, used sugar free pudding, fat free Cool Whip, and skim milk.  So yummy!

I made this for a dessert competition and won first place.  I followed the recipe exactly except I also topped it with sliced strawberries and a generous drizzle of my homemade mocha syrup.  People raved about it all night and stood up and cheered when it was announced as the winner.  :)  Thank you to the user who originally posted the recipe!

Personally, I don't care for pudding, so I'm rating this based on everyone else's reactions.  They LOVED it.  I doubled the ingredients and served it after Christmas dinner.  Since I couldn't find a white chocolate (or cheesecake) flavoured pudding, I used 2 boxes of chocolate and 1 box of vanilla (putting the vanilla layer in the middle).  I added hazelnut flavoured instant coffee to the chocolate pudding, which gave it a nice flavour.  I also used 1 cup of milk per pudding box, as other reviewers recommended. Instead of adding the Score bar pieces to each layer, I offered them on the side in a serving dish so the guests could sprinkle the amount they wanted over their dish.  (Okay, okay...I accidentally forgot to add them to the layers as I went, but it all worked out anyway)

I needed to make a dessert in a hurry for a party so I bought brownie bites and cut them up instead of baking them.  I also used snickers instead of the skor bars since that's all that I had on hand.  This was a HUGE hit - the bowl was empty in no time and guests were looking for more!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is great! I made my own brownies ("Chewy Brownies" from this site - amazing brownies). I didn't have caramel candies, but had caramel pie filling, so I mixed the filling with some coffee to thin it and used it as the second layer, topping it with the pudding layer. I also added a few swigs of chocolate liquor. This was decadent, delicious and pretty too!

This one is for all brownie lovers!  I made it with whipped cream instead of the topping and it was very rich and good.  I used three boxes of pudding as suggested with 3 c. milk and it turned out great!  Really quite easy to make.  Awsome presentation that is great for your guests!  You'll impress them!

Wow! Took this to a potluck over the week-end. I needed to double the recipe to fill up my trifle bowl and there was nothing left by the time I went through the line. I got rave reviews regarding the presentation and the taste.  Instead of candy bars I used Heath Milk Chocolate Toffee Bits.I found them by the chocolate chips. I used canned whipped topping on the top but I must have put it on too early. I put it on and it looked beautiful. I put it in the refrigerator and when I took it out some of it had dissolved.I was glad I had some topping left. Squirted some more on and went to the party.

This was the one- the recipe that made me finally write a review! An amazing dessert; the only change I made was substituting devil's food cake for the brownies. I knew it met everyone's approval from the Mmm's and second (and third) helpings that everyone took...until the bowl was clean. I'll be making this trifle for many more friend and family gatherings!

This was so incredibly easy!!!!!!  Made the brownies in the morning and assembled the rest in the afternoon.  I should have doubled everything because my trifle dish is deep (appx 6 inches.  It was beautiful to look at it.  I placed thin slices of brownie around the outside of the dish and then used the cake part to fill in the middle.  Gave it a more defined layerd look.

I made this for my mother's 59th birthday.....it was a hugh hit!  Everyone loved it!  The only thing I changed was that I used fresh whip cream instead of store bought and spread the remaining over the top for garnishment.  I would use this one again.

This is a great recipe!!!!  I made the brownies that have the chocolate syrup pouch.  I drizzled the syrup over the toffee layer and it made it extra rich.  Everyone loved it!  I'm making this one next week for a dinner party.

This is a GREAT recipe!  I made this for Thanksgiving and came home with enough for 1 or 2 servings!  A Big Hit!  The only thing I changed was adding another box of white chocolate pudding and made 1 and 1/2 recipes of the coffee portion of the recipe.  TRY this...you won't regret it!!!!

If I could give this recipe 6 stars I would. I made this for a work luncheon and it was the star of the party. 

I did make some minor changes that I think lightened it up. I did a layer of brownies at the bottom but then 2 layers of devils food cake. I also left a layer of the white chocolate pudding in-between.  

This is a total keeper!!!!

What a hit--people were scraping the bowl when it was empty!  I used the cheesecake flavored pudding with the coffee, and it gave a bit of a pleasant tang. I made cake-like brownies; doubled the pudding and the coffee; used a bag of crushed Heathbar; saved some plain Coolwhip for the top; and sprinkled with more Heathbar.    Very delicious--almost like a tiramisu.  The only ones who didn't like it were those who don't like coffee...their loss!

WOW this was awesome!!  I served it for December's full moon gathering and everyone LOVED it.  I'm still hearing how wonderful it was.  I did make a few changes.  Instead of the candy bar I used the bag of Scor toffe already crushed up and since my friend has a milk alergy I used mocha mix instead of milk in the pudding.  And I used Fat Free cool whip when mixing it and then I added extra creamy cool whip to the top and more candy!  Thanks for the recipe!

YUM!  This is the BEST trifle pudding I have ever had!  I have a sweet tooth, however, and I found it very rich!  You will not be able to eat alot of this in one sitting!  Even so, it was gone the next day!  Your family will love this dessert!  Tip: I used the Ultimate Double Chocolate Cookies recipe from allrecipes for the brownie portion of this recipe.  *If you melt the butter completely, the result will be an excellent brownie batter.  I also found it easier to melt the chocolate (I used chocolate chips) in the microwave!  Follow all the other instructions for the recipe.    EXCELLENT COMBINATION OF RECIPES!

I make this often, mostly because I get lots of requests for it. The only changes I made are that I add a 1 1/2 tsp of almond extract to the mousse  and I sometimes drizzle a some caramel sauce on the top of my brownie layers if I have it handy. Oh, and I buy a Heath Bar Milk Chocolate and English Toffee peices - it's easier than smashing candy bars.

I made this for a coworker's birthday today . This is sooo rich...omg! It was a hit ?? 
the best part is how easy it was to make. 
As others have mentioned the white chocolate pudding was not available so I chose vanilla. I opted to make the brownies from scratch (see Brookes Best Brownies on this site...incredible! ).  The rest is by the book...it's a keeper for sure.

I thought this was great! I followed the directions and my pudding mixture was perfect. I think a lot of people must not be folding in the cool whip, as instructed. The only thing I changed, I used 6 Heath bars instead of 3. I took it to a church pot luck and it was completely gone in seconds. Thank you for a great recipe ADRSEW!

Great flavor, but you definitely need to double the pudding mixture. I barely had enough for two layers! Otherwise, this was an easy and tasty dessert.

If you've never had a trifle before, yes, you will think this is wonderful. 

With all the great reviews I picked this one. Made my own chocolate cake instead of brownies and used vanilla pudding. I doubled the coffee because I taste-tested and thought it was weak. After doubling it, it had a nice light mocha flavor. 

I assembled it in the morning and refrigerated before serving, When I served it after lunch, I didn't taste the coffee anymore. People at work didn't care and still liked it, but I was disappointed that no one could taste the coffee, just tasted like chocolate cake and vanilla pudding. Next time I'd increase the coffee or buy something stronger. Oh, and I would leave some of the candy bar in larger chunks. Mine were crushed too much I guess and I didn't taste them. But everyone still loved this recipe, I just wanted a stronger coffee flavor.

Terrific recipe.  I add extra coffee for more of a coffee flavor. I also add coffee to the whipped cream and layer that in a separate layer from the pudding layer.

This recipe got rave reviews at the office potluck - though I did make a few changes for my own personal taste.  I'm not a fan of non-dairy topping, so I used two cups of heavy whipping cream that I beat with 1/2 cup sugar in place of the 2 cups of thawed frozen topping.  I also substituted cookies and cream pudding in place of the white chocolate, and used mocha fudge brownie mix for an extra kick of mocha. I only had the mini heath bars, so used 24 of those.  It was delicious, and not too difficult to make!

Tried this for a family get together! Everyone loved it, used 2% milk, nonfat whipped cream, low-fat pudding and sugar free toffee chocolate to make it moreso guilt-free and was uncertain whether or not it would be accepted, but no one tasted the difference and were dumbfounded when I told them. Got requests to make it again for Christmas, definitely recommend for a quick and easy dessert! Also left it to sit overnight, which might have added to its taste.

This recipe is DELICIOUS and so easy to prepare. I served this trifle for dessert to 10 people and only had a few mouthfuls of it left. It got rave reviews.  I will definitely make it again and again. I do agree with some others that maybe a little bit more pudding could have been used and more of the candy for crunch. Still, this did not affect the outcome at all. I was not able to find white chocolate pudding at my grocery store so I substituted vanilla pudding and it turned out just fine.

This was great!  I was looking for something to make for a girls night dessert, and this was perfect.  Instead of layering it in a big glass bowl, I made individual servings in martini glasses.

This dessert was incredible and I impressed my whole family with this recipe. Very delicious, I will certainly make this again! I like to crunch up LOTS of coffee crisp chocolate bars and add it to the trifle with the Skor bits.

This recipe was GREAT!!! I had to make alterations with this recipe, but it still turned out delicious.  I didn't have enough milk so i used half & half for the pudding.  I also didn't have the chocolate bars so i chopped up a mixture of about 3/4 cup of white and regular chocolate chips. I will make this recipe again and again!!!

I decided to make this and bring to a church potluck, since it looked delicious and easy to put together.  There was nothing left to bring home, this was very tasty.  Even my husband, whom doesn't like desserts much, enjoyed this dessert very much.

Oh my goodness . . .this dessert is so good.  It was easy to assemble, looked so pretty in the trifle bowl and tasted wonderful.  I baked the brownies the day before because I had time, then completed the pudding work and assembly the next day.  Quick - tasty, what more could you want!!

Scrumptious, sinful, dreamy, beautiful, showtopper.  Just a few adjectives that came to mind when I served this dish. The looks on my female co-workers faces when the took their first bite rivaled ecstasy.
My only complaint is that it didn't fill my trifle bowl like I thought it would.  I will just have to double the recipe next time.  What a shame, that might mean left overs. ;-)
Thanks for sharing such yumminess

Great recipe!  Definitely make this the day before.  It tastes sooo much better the second day after the flavors blend and the brownies absorb a little more moisture.  Awsome!

Wonderful and easy.  I didn't have a brownie mix on hand so made a devil's food cake mix in two 9 by 9 pans.  I froze one for making this again later (and as good as it was, it will probably be sooner rather than later!)

Also, you can use low fat whipped topping without it being too soft.

Great Recipe.  I made this for Thanksgiving.  I could not find white chocolate pudding so I used french vanilla.  I also couldn't find any toffee bars so I just shaved a Dove chocolate bar for the top of it.  Everyone loved it.

Very good quick dessert.  I added a layer of just plain cool whip on top instead of the mocha pudding and topped with some toffee crumbles.

Make this...you will not be disappointed!  Though I made some changes I would venture to say this is a 5 star recipes without any.  My Changes:  I used a chocolate cake instead of brownies, doubled the pudding, milk and cool whip and threw in an extra heath bar!  To get a stronger mocha taste, if doubling the pudding, you could double the coffee as well.  I'm not a big coffee fan so this was just perfect for me.  I could probably eat it all too, good thing Bible Study was at my house this week!

This is a great recipe!  I made a couple of changes to it.  I added 2 teaspoons of vanilla to the coffee mixture (it cuts down on the taste for those who are not mocha fans)and used an instant chocoate instead of 2 white chocolate.  I have made it twice this way and it was a major hit for a dinner party we had:)

I've brought this to two potlucks and received many compliments.  I personally find it too be almost too rich and sweet, but most people loved it.  I used french vanilla instead of the white chocolate pudding and real whipped cream instead of the cool whip since my husband despises cool whip.  I didn't add any sugar to the cream when I whipped it, as this is certainly sweet enough.  This trifle is impressive looking and garners lots of "oohs and aahs" when you put it out on the table.  Not a dessert for just our family on an average weeknight- way too much work and much too heavy, but it seems to be a party favorite.

This recipe was  very rich! I could only eat very little. We had to throw most of it away.  I would prefer a little more of the pudding layer. I only did two layers and didnt have enough to cover it completly. I would recommend doubling the pudding. I also put whip cream on the top.

I followed advice and used cheesecake pudding instead of white chocolate - so good.  I don't know how much 2 cups of frozen whipped topping is, but I used 8 ounces and that was the perfect amount.  Delicious dessert!

Ohhh, yumm! This was so easy and delicious. Everyone loved it, adults as well as kids!! The white choc. pudding with the instant coffee was such a great combination. I was afraid the coffee flavor would be too strong, but it wasn't. Only mistake I made was forgetting to take the cool whip out of the freezer ahead of time. I was in a rush and had to do a quick defrost. It worked out, but just thought I'd give that little reminder! Enjoy!!

This is GREAT!  Children and adults all loved it.  A substitution of regular chocolate pudding for the white chocolate works fine.

Didn't change a thing. Fabulous but rich. Definitely have some milk or water to go with it. Next time, I might chop up some extra heath candy bars for the bottom and middle layers though. Will be making this one again.

I made this trifle for my husband's birthday, and I have to say that it was pretty good.  I think he liked it a bit better than me- all of the ingredients were a bit overwhelming for me.  It was very, very rich- I think the coffee flavouring really intensified it.  For some reason I couldn't find toffee at the grocery store, so I substitued a butterfinger-like candy.  I might make it again, but I would definitely substitute toffee for the butterfinger bars or try it without candy.  They were good, my husband liked them, but the candy was a little too much for me.

Based on my experience making this recipe  yesterday, I believe the ingredient measurement for milk on this recipe is wrong. Ignore the ingredient for 1 3/4 cups cold milk and make the pudding using the amount of milk stated on the pudding box; otherwise, the pudding will be WAY TOO THICK for the trifle.  1 3/4 cup milk is 1/4 cup short for just one box of 1 oz of the pudding much less 3 boxes/ounces. Also, Jello's 1 oz box and Godiva's 3.9 oz pudding box both state that 2 cups of milk should be used. I found that Jello's 2 cups of milk per one oz. of pudding mix was by far the better consistency for a trifle recipe, but the Godiva pudding mix had a much better flavor.

I loved this!! It was my first trifle ever and I made it for a party.

I substituted heavy cream and whipped up one pint of it with 3 tablespoons of confectioners sugar to hold the peaks since it was going to be about 4 hours before i served it.  That worked perfectly!!  I folded this in with the pudding and i did what others did and substituted cheesecake for vanilla pudding.  I also added a little more milk by sight so it wasn't rigid but basically the consistency of cake batter. 

I used Devil's food cake for my layers.  I did have some left over..

I drizzled Kahlua over the Devil's food cake layers but didn't saturate it.  You could barely taste it in the trifle..

i used 5 Skor bars and basically cut them with a knife while they were warm and soft.  If there's an easier way to crush Skor bars I'd like to know! :-)

This will be my go-to trifle now that i have my first trifle bowl!

I got rave reviews about this.  I used the Ghiradelli dark chocolate brownie and then give it a liberal sprinkling of Amaretto after I chopped it.  I do think it needs more than 2 cups of whipped cream.

In a word, wow! We really enjoyed this dessert. I made a few little changes, due to ingredients I had on hand. I used a dark chocolate brownie mix because of all the reviews saying how intolerably sweet this was. For coffee flavoring, I used strong coffee made in a French press. The layers I used were whipped topping, brownies, frozen raspberries - again to cut the sweetness, miniature white chocolate KitKat bars and miniature peppermint patties, and the mocha pudding. I think next time I pack all the brownie layers a bit more densely packed

This recipe was a huge hit at our Friday night get together with friends!
I always use really whipped cream instead of cool whip.

I made this again for my granddaughters 5th birthday, added gummy worms to make it look like worms & dirt!

I was so excited to find this recipe with so many 5 star ratings so I decided to make it for a dinner party.  I followed the recipe exactly  only adding a shot of Kahlua to the pudding mixture as recommended by one of the reviewers.  I have to say that I was terribly disappointed in the results.  The pudding mixture was almost gummy and had a processed taste to it.  That in combination with the very rich brownies and the even richer crumbled candy combined to make this dessert so rich that most of my guests could only eat a few bites. This one does not rate as a "keeper" in my recipe files.

I made this Trifle dessert for a dinner party and all of my guest thought it was to die for. I did substitute heavy whipping cream instead of Cool Whip. I also baked the brownies in a 9 by 13 pan instead of the 8 by 8 which decreased the cooking time a lot, but made more of the chewy texture for the brownie bite in the Trifle.

I won a baking contest at my office for national chocolate day! I did add more coffee than called for because I like a stronger taste. I made the brownies from scratch using the bakers unsweetened chocolate "one bowl" recipe - so easy and good! I also added dark chocolate chips to the brownies. So delicious and makes a nice presentation in a trifle bowl. Can't wait to make - and eat - again! Thanks for the recipe!

when I couldn't find heath bars, I crumbled Ghirardelli white peppermint bark.  My daughter in law finds it more festive around the holidays. A less expensive alternative is crushed peppermint.

I made it as written the first time.  Second time I made my scratch brownies, added Kahlua and nuts and changed to homemade French Vanilla Pudding, so it was not so sweet.   I also made my own whipped cream to which I added just a touch of it to keep it from separating.  This was good as written but a bit too sweet for me without my changes.  Thanks for a great idea!

OMG!!!!  This was soooooo good.  I made it as a dessert for Christmas dinner.  Amongst many desserts, this was the first to go.  Everyone raved about it and kept telling others to go try it before it was gone.  My nephew even asked me the next day, "do you happen to have anymore of that delicious dessert left at your house?".  Unfortunately I took home an empty bowl.  I am so going to make this again and again.  Fantastic job ADRSEW!

This has turned into one of the stadrad dessert items my friend ask me to bring when we do pith-ins! I use the Kahkua variation to asdd some extra flavor. My daughter's Girl Scout troop added a layer of smashed Tagalongs for a cooking contest and it was great that way too!

This is the best trifle I have ever made! I made this for my grandmother's Christmas gathering this year. My great aunt went back three times to get more because she liked it so much! There were not many leftovers left, and my husband and mother-in-law fought over them! Will be doing again very soon (at everyone's request)!

Great recipe! But there was one thing that I did mess up and did not let the coffee granules dissolve completely, so there were bits of coffee in every bite, so what I did was mix all the ingredients and put it in a bowl and then cut the brownies into little bite size pieces and everyone dipped their brownies.

This didn't last very long!!  I bought the smaller pkg of white choc. pudding mix, so I had to add another package and only had chocolate on hand...I ended up with more chocolate layers, but who cares when it tasted as good as it did!!  I also added some Nutella hazelnut spread to the pudding and WOW, what an incredible flavor!!!  I will definately make this again!!  THANKS!!

This was my first trifle, and the first time I got to use my new trifle bowl - what a success!  I made this on Thanksgiving, and had to make another one the same week so we could have more!  It's rich, but for true chocoholics, it's simply perfect.  I used Skor bars instead of Heath - they are less sweet, and chop well in a food processor.

This is a beautiful desert that will impress with its looks and taste. I didnt have two packages of chocolate pudding mix so I used one and one cheesecake flavored mix. You couldnt really tell, it still turned out great. Next time I will make my brownies "cake-y" instead of fudgey, but that's just personal preference. This recipe is even better the next day!!!

I suggest serving with whip cream & sprinkle with cinnamon, because that is the only way we could eat it.  The filling just didn't do anything for us.  I think a cream cheese filling would've been better.

YUM!  I only made 2 layers instead of 3.  I only used 3 tsp of coffee vs. 4 - 4 would have been too overpowering for my taste.  Wonderful desert and beautiful presentation!

Made this for my book club and it was a big hit!  Perfect for the chocoholic coffee addict.
