I used the parsley, but my potatoes never turned green. I really didn't matter because the garlic was what make this recipe
special.  Next time I'll do away with the added expense of buying the parsley. A keeper for sure.

This recipe is delicious and went well with steak.  It doesn't require lots of prep time, and you can prepare other foods while the potatoes are cooking.  We used fresh parlsley, russet potatoes, and added extra garlic.

It tastes sooo good.  Kids love it because it's green!  The prep time is extremely quick.  You don't have to slave over the stove while it's cooking either.

An interesting twist on cooking potatoes.  I'd recommend sprinkling some extra parsley on before serving.

My potatoes didn't turn green at all. The water was a tad green, but not the spuds. Since I was making these for St. Pat's Day, I added green food coloring while mashing.

Thanks for the recipe, but it was a big disappointment for me.  I used only about 1.5# potatoes, 3 cloves garlic, and about 1/3 C parsley.  I didn't think the garlic or parsley flavors came through at all.  It was just mushy potatoes.  I won't be making at again.

I have to admit that I didn't exactly follow this "Green Potatoes" recipe. Instead, I did my own take on the idea with a lot more parsley (tons!). I loved it! Thank you Debe for sharing your recipe.
