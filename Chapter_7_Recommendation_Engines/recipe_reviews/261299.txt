Followed the recipe as is, and it was delicious!  I will make it again.  Maybe add some fresh garlic next time.

Saw this in the magazine and put it in my list of dinners. I make carnitas usually the same time so was willing to change it up. I followed the recipe exactly... and it does not disappoint! Even my 1 year old was dipping the meat into the sauce. Plus I never use corn tortillas... this tasted delicious though! I did eat mine with gauacamole and fried the tortillas just a tad!

This was soooo good! I blended this recipe and another by adding coriander, garlic and bay leaves to this meat. Broiled the meat prior to serving to crisp it up. It will definitely be added to the rotation. The lime juice makes this entree shine! Thank you for this recipe!

Delicious and couldn't be easier! I slow cooked the pork over night. When we were ready to eat if for lunch I first warmed it in the oven with the preserved cooking liquid and then broiled it for a few minutes to crisp. I added some garlic to the slow cooker but otherwise made no changes. Will definitely make again

Super easy and kids loved it!  I did leave out the cayenne pepper, but it still tastes wonderful.

Really good flavor, but mine were a little dry.  It was my first time with my new crock pot so perhaps I need to adjust cooking time.  Definitely will make again!
