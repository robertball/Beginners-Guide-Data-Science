I loved this recipe. The second time I made it, I actually forgot to add the fried onions before putting it in the oven!  I frantically added the whole thing at the very end and it turned out crunchier.  I was disappointed in myself until my husband mentioned that he liked it better that way.  Now he requests that I make it the "wrong way"  :-)

This recipe is great! I also sautee 1 cup of sliced mushrooms and 1 chopped onion and an extra can of soup. This all gets added to the mix and gives it a great combo of flavors!

You can't beat this classic!  To punch it up you can sub sour cream for the milk and add sliced mushrooms.  Yum!

I made this last Christmas and got really good compliments on the recipe. I also added some fresh mushrooms and onions and sautéed these in red wine before adding them in with the other ingredients. I will be making this again this Christmas!

I know a lot of people are crazy about Green Bean Casserole, and I bet if your family likes it, they’ll LOVE this recipe.  The flavor truly is excellent, but my family and I didn’t care for the texture.  I think it was the use of the fried onions in the dish.  I’ll try it again only make it on the stove top, use the soup as the flavoring and sprinkle the fried onions on top just as they go on the table.

To spice things up, I add hot pepper cheese both to the mixture and on top. Bake about 30min. or til the cheese is bubbly then sprinkle fried onions on top and bake 5min. My relatives have insisted I make it for every get together.

I always felt like my standard green bean casserole was missing something so I tried this recipe. It filled the void my old recipe was missing! I think it was the cream of chicken and mushroom soup combo in one can. I almost passed up the can but then spotted it. It makes the recipe taste more hearty and delicious. Try it, you won't be sorry!

5 stars because this is my families favorite green bean casserole for the holidays. I personally don't care for it. My mom insisted that I add two cans of soup and no french fried onions.

Good classic green bean casserole recipe.  I added a spicy Jamican season to heaten it up a bit.

My family loves green bean casserole. Only I use frozen green beans because I find the canned stuff gets too mushy.

Such an easy recipe.    Tasted great!  I used condensed cream of mushroom soup instead so it could be a vegetarian dish.  I also added shitake mushrooms sauteed in red wine thanks to fellow reviewer Moria!

Never liked an overpowering green bean...this recipe is awesome and you can add more seasoning for your own personal taste.  It's a classic, can't go wrong.

For a more festive side dish I wanted to spruce it up a bit. I added some sauteed onion, minced garlic and bacon in with two lbs of frozen green beans and half package of cream cheese. Before adding the french onion I layed the mixture with a package of Kraft shredded three cheeses. It came out AMAZING

a great classic holiday dish. I prefer fresh green beans so blanching them prior to baking is a must. I also add a teaspoon of soy sauce but this recipe will not let you down!

It was very easy to make.  Taking the green bean casserole for a pot blessing.  It is always a big hit.

I can only give my review on the two bites I was able to get! It was gone in a flash.  Hands down the winner in competition with soup based version.  It is a breeze to make. Because of the time restraints I had, the beans needed to be cooked the night before and the casserole prepped for cooking. It didn't affect the consistency or flavor at all. I encourage you to give this one a try!

Great dish, but I did make a few changes. I added a tsp of Garlic to the sour cream mixture. I also used the fried onions because my kids love those so I mixed some in with the green beans mixture and used a cup of shredded cheese in the mixture. Then I topped it with the remaining cheese. I cooked it for half of the time and then added more fried onions to the top and finished it in the oven. It was a hit.

Excellent. I found that adding a teaspoon of soy sauce into the soup and milk mixture improved flavor also.

Used non-fat milk, cream of chicken soup. Milk with more fat would have been better, of course. Needs more zip.

Yum. Hubby likes using french style green beans and I like using the Italian cut style, so we have to make two small casseroles at a time. :)

It was very good. Took it to a potluck holiday dinner and quadrupled the recipe.  It was all gone so it must have been a hit.
