I was looking for a simple caesar salad dressing and while the recipe title looked appealing sadly the dressing was not...  It really needed some olive oil.  The white vinegar was a bit overpowering and it could really use real garlic vs. garlic powder.  It didn't taste good and I ended up throwing it out as I couldn't save it and didn't want to bother trying.

I really enjoyed this dressing. More like tangy and crisp than bitter and sharp. A welcome change to the stereotyped caesar salad. Must try if you like things that are just that little bit different. Fresh parmesan crumbled tastes best (Ive used this recipe more than once).

This was very good and very simple as the title says, although I did omit the white vinegar and added olive oil instead.  It was very creamy and very tart. I will certainly make this again.

I would not recommend this for use in Caesar salads--it is too bitter and sharp with nothing in it to make it the least bit creamy. I tried to salvage it by adding honey and using it for a spinach salad dressing. 
After writing the above, I realize that I had forgotten the parmesan cheese. Ooops! I wonder how much of a difference it would have made?

This is fantastic for vegetatarians who don't normally get to enjoy caesar salad due to anchoivy paste!

I replaced the 1/3 cup water with 1/3 cup olive oil, and used a few cloves of fresh garlic instead of powdered.

I love caesar salad dressing and I love vinaigrette, so this recipe seemed perfect. I was really disappointed because there was no thickening agent to assist in coating the ingredients of the salad. It was so watery and the flavor was not overly enjoyable. Maybe if something was added to make it thicker, it would be okay. Thanks anyway :O)

I thought this dressing was too thin. I did add some oil and leave out some of the vinegar. I am looking for a really lemony caesar dressing with a good garlic taste, too, but this was not it! I did not enjoy my salad!

Very tangy, but delicious. I added 1/2 tsp. of sugar (or sweetener) per serving (I divided the recipe to make one serving). I also added the parm cheese later on, not in the dressing.

I agree with WHATSHISFACE, pretty sour.  My husband is doing Weight Watchers and I was looking for a new 0 point dressing, but I think at least a oil and salt would help a lot.

This recipe definitely needed a fat component.  I added mayonaise and a bit of olive oil and salt and it became more creamy, but not what I think of when I think of "Caesar" dressing.

This dressing was very good.  It had a little to much mustard for my taste but not overwhelming.  I did add 1/2 of mayo to make it a little thicker and used fresh garlic.  I would make again.  Thanks for sharing.

I followed the directions exactly and this "dressing" doesnt resemble a caeser salad dressing at all. I tried whatever I could think of to try to make it work but it was beyond repair. There are too many bitter ingrediants without anything to nuetrilize atleast some of the acids. I wouldnt suggest this recipe to anyone

This is a really good recipe except that I used 1/3 cup oil and added more parmesan cheese (about 1/4 cup).  When I make potato salad, I use this to marinate the potatos when they are still warm.  The dressing soaks into the potatos and then I make the salad with mayo, just like normal.  Gives it a nice flavor.

Delicious. A few minor changes made that I feel improved the dressing. #1 Used red wine vinegar. #2 Made in the blender which made the dressing thicker and more able to coat my lettuce leaves. #3 Used one clove of garlic--had a fresher taste. #4 took the idea from another recipe to add 2 tsp. of sour cream too--not sure why or what it does, but the overall taste is yummy so I'm sticking with it!

I give it 5 stars with my minor changes: omitted vinegar altogether, used garlic salt in place of powder and ground white pepper instead of black, used half amount of water called for and sub'd EVOO. Definitely NOT like bottled Caesar, but an awesome dressing in place of traditional Caesar. I think the keys to making this dressing taste great is using fresh grated Parmesan and refrigerating for a couple of hours to let the flavors infuse.

Sorry, but I did not care for this dressing, too bitter and tangy. It definately needs much tweaking, olive oil perhaps, some fresh garlic, less lemon juice, vinegar and dijon!!

Awesome recipe! I did add about 2 to 3 tablespoons of EVOO (extra virgin olive oil) as it was a little too much like water, and I used fresh garlic instead of powdered garlic. 
I'm going to be using this dressing from now on. It's a nice change from the traditional creamy dressing. Doesn't make me feel so heavy after eating it.

As is 3 stars. I tasted it before I put it on the salad and knew it needed something so I added about a teaspoon of sugar and about 1/3 cup oil. Its pretty tangy without a little sugar to even it out I think next time I would omit one of the acids in this.

This dressing is not one I would recommend, the only flavour you taste is vinegar. My husband loves vinegar, but even he did not like this dressing.

I didn't add as much lemon juice, omitted the vinegar completely, and added about 1/3 cup of fat free ranch dressing to make this recipe more kid friendly.  I served it as the dressing for my grilled chicken caesar salad which was the main dish and my non-veggie eating husband went back for 3rds!

Followed the recipe but added more garlic powder, only because I over poured, and less Parmesan, only becsause I only had about 1/3 cup.  It was really great.  The lemon flavour is really nice.  It's a nice light caesar dressing.

I knew the mustard would be too strong so I put in half the quantity. It was still overpowering. I tried a bit of sugar to decrease the bite(still too strong)then I added some mayonnaise. I cannot recommend this recipe... sorry!

I'd initally reduce (by half) the amount of vinegar and lemon juice (by 1/3) and use olive oil instead of water and then adjust to taste. I adjusted just about all the ingredients to get it to a point where it would be okay to put on a salad. Not great but simple

This recipe is good, but I wouldn't call it a caesar dressing. I added some olive oil to help make it stick to my ingredients.

This recipe is WAY to bitter/tart.  I followed the recipe exactly then tasted it and puckered up!  So I tried adding some sugar, not much help.  Next time I will cut the vinegar in half or less.

Not a fan.  Too much acid in this one for me.  Others may like it but I found the lemon and vinegar was a bit much. Added olive oil anchovies and a ton of Parmesan to help it along.  It looked good though.

Was quite tangy. Probably could use some olive oil to help the dressing cling to the salad. Maybe more garlic and possibly some other spices? I was looking for a dressing that did not include sugar, and this worked for that purpose.

this recipe is a decent base recipe, however, it needs a lot of tweaking. I omitted the water, used grated parmesan cheese and added a packet of ranch dressing mix for a creamier dressing. Next time I will cut down the amount of lemon juice and add fresh pressed garlic instead of garlic powder. This is a good recipe if you want a Caesar dressing, but don't have anchovies.

I made this with just a dab of parmesean because there was none left! Since others said it was not creamy i added a dab of cream cheese and i loved it!! Great low calorie and filling lunch. I would maybe not add quite as much vineagar. Also making one serving is perfect for a cereal sized bowl of salad to be perfectly covered!

I read some of the reviews before concocting :) and to thicken to my liking, i adding some sour cream, it turned out great for a simple salad dressing. Will definitely keep on hand. Thanks for sharing. :)

This is not caesar dressing, it's just something else entirely. I tweaked it a lot, ending with dijon mustard dressing. Good, but not anywhere close to original intention.

I used this to marinate chicken breast that I used to make grilled chicken Caesar Salad. I'm giving it 3 stars because I made some alterations--used olive oil instead of water and fresh garlic (about 1/4 tsp. crushed) instead of garlic powder. Overall, did a nice job adding flavor to the chicken.

I thought the flavor was okay, though I would reduce the amount of water to make it a little less runny. I also enjoyed adding a little worcestershire sauce (about 1-2 tsp).

Pretty good however to much vinegar, next time I will use half the vinegar and add 1/4 cup Olive Oil. Also ommit the garlic powder for fresh garlic.

Watery, and overly sour for my taste. Addition of oil would have been very helpful.
