Thanks to this recipe, my family of seven will be eating rutabagas.  BIG HIT!!

I think the first time I tried rutabagas it may have been from a can--EW!  I was reluctant  to try rutabaga in general. Thanks to my toddler's insistence, we bought a rutabaga.  (We were playing around with "R" words at the grocery store.)  At home, I jumped on my computer and this recipe looked promising. 

My rutabaga was on the smaller side (I didn't want to be wasteful if we didn't like rutabagas).  I dumped the other ingredients together to melt/blend; otherwise I followed the directions.  I didn't time my simmer, but I waited until the rutabaga was tender.  It's a good side dish to have simmering while preparing other things.   THANK YOU for sharing this recipe.

Great recipe! I did use less brown sugar, the recipe says "or to taste." My husband really loved it, I did too.

Not sure what went wrong. Quickly scorched in spite of burner on medium. Maybe my electric stove is in the hotter side. Disappointed.

This was great! The glaze was fantastic and all of the ingredients were accessible. The whole family loved it! However, it took the glaze an hour longer than expected to soak up into the rutabaga. Maybe my heat was a little too low? But it was worth the wait!

I found the recipe easy to follow and the results were great.  Will definitely make this again. Great flavor! Seems like the balance between cooking time and liquid used is key. It will make a great side dish when visiting during the holidays!

This did not go over well at my house. The soy sauce was too much and an odd flavor for this vegetable. Only 1 out of 8 people who tried it liked it. I simmered this for over an 1 and 30 minutes and it was barely soft. It took so long! I was sad because I had high hopes for this recipe because of the reviews. It smells great cooking, but I could only eat a few pieces.
