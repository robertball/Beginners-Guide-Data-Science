If you're looking for a quick-to-make bread, this isn't it because it does have quite a few ingredients and prepping the apples does take some time to get into the oven.  I baked it for about 75 minutes and wondered after I cut into it if it should have baked longer because the slices were falling apart.  This bread has 1/2 cup of applesauce and three fresh apples, so to say it's moist is an understatement.  Unfortunately, it's almost too moist IMO.  I was unable to slice it without it crumbling.    However, it is delicious, and we ended up just eating it in a bowl sort of like an apple cobbler.   If that's acceptable to you, go for it because the taste is very good.  I'm going to try this recipe again with one apple shredded and one apple chopped to see if that will improve the texture and make it sliceable.  BTW, I followed the recipe to the letter.

This bread recipe was the best I have ever tried and I love to bake. The smell of it baking was mouth-watering. I doubled the recipe for two loaves and was glad I did. The recipe has a few extra steps but is worth it. I followed the recipe. The baking time for me was one hour and 15 minutes. I baked them until a knife inserted came out clean. Then they were cooled for 15 minutes before I removed them from pans. I hope you enjoy them as must as I did. My mother would make an apple cake when I was little. She is gone now and when I took a bite it sent me back into good memories.

This bread is delicious! I accidentally under-baked it but it still tastes amazing. It definitely took longer than 20 minutes to prepare; and I had too much struesel for one loaf. However I had applesauce apples and sour milk to use and this recipe fit the bill!

The only changes I made was using 1 cup sugar rather than half sugar half sucralose sweetener, did not peel my apples, and no walnuts simply because hubby said "nah" to any nuts.  I doubled the topping and pushed it down into bread building up middle in hopes of no overflow into the oven.  Very moist, just right amount of spices and was quite delicious!  Whole family enjoyed it!  This is my third time to make this bread and first recipe of an apple bread to try.  There's no need for me to pick another! I've never written a review before now, and this one is definitely going into my stash of recipes to pass on to my girls! Thanks for posting!

I make this bread every year with my Christmas baking!! The only things I do differently are: instead of using Splenda I use Sugar in the Raw. And I do not shred some of the apple. I dice them all:) I love this recipe!!!

Great recipe. I use regular granulated sugar or granulated xylitol instead of artificial sweetener. It's a hit with everyone I serve it to!

Delicious Bread! Takes some time to get the bread ready and baked but a very good way to use up those apples! I used some pantry alternatives from our long term food storage; powdered eggs powdered milk with vinegar for buttermilk homemade applesauce and home-canned baking apples but followed the recipe with these alternatives and it turned out moist and wonderful. The streusel really makes the bread! I will definitely be making this bread again. Oh and I used mini-loaf pans lined with parchment for 40 minutes. Baked perfectly.

Excellent! Instead of sucrolose I used 1/2 cup of Stevia In the Raw powder. I also used 1/3 cup of 1% milk instead of the buttermilk. It came out absolutely perfect not overly sweet. Delicious! Baked for exactly 60 minutes.

I tried this and it turned out really well but a few things to note: there is no way it bakes in less than an hour. It takes about an hour and 20 minutes. I was also a little short on flour so I topped it up with oatmeal right in the batter and that may have stiffened it up a little. It is also a little fiddly because of all the ingredients. However it is a fine tasting loaf.

Very good bread - I did substitute 1/2 cup brown sugar for the sucralose sugar as I didn't have any. Nice and moist and very good flavor. Definitely a keeper
