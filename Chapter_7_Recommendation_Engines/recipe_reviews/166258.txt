Delicious, moist, and couldn't be easier. The glaze flavors and proportions are just right.

I would suggest marinating the chicken in the plum sauce mixture instead of merely brushing it on top, to really get the flavour into the meat. Wouldn't hurt to prick the skin or make a few light slashes across the chicken either.

This had a very nice flavor. I added a little garlic. I think it would be better if you rubbed a little oil on the skin before the baking, so the skin would crisp up a little, or do this on the grill, or use skinless meat -- as written the skin stays kind of squishy which we found unappealing personally. Any jam would probably work -- I used orange marmalade and served this with AR's "Sweet and Spicy Green Beans". Thanks for the recipe!

I was NOT in the mood to cook tonight, but this recipe looked so easy, that I had not excuse not to cook.  I had to use apricot preserves instead of plum jam, but it was easy and delicious.  I will definitely make this again - and I hope to find plum jam for next time.  Hubby agreed - it's a keeper.

The chicken came out incredibly juicy, though the lovely sauce did not penetrate the meat at all. I think this glaze would be pretty good on a pork loin, too. I may try that next time. Thanks for sharing!

I'm sorry but this dish just didn't work for us. I followed the recipe exactly as written, but the inside part of the chicken didn't get any flavor.

This was delicious - the combination of plum jam and horseradish!  I will definitely make this again.

This is really, really good. It has become a regular weeknight dinner.  I've used plum preserves, kumquat jam, Asian pear jam, and mango preserves in the recipe.  All work well.  I usually use boneless chicken breasts, simply because that's usually on hand.

This was easy and fantastic!  We had company for dinner and I am a little nervous about trying something new for guests, but this didn't disappoint.  I added the garlic as was suggested and we had frozen horseradish that I grated with a fine cheese grater.  We will do this again!
