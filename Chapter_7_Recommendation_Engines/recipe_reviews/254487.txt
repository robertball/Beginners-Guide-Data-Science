I brined my turkey using this recipe. it was FANTASTIC!!!!! It had a perfect taste, all of the meat was juicy - even the white meat that I usually hate because it is so dry was moist and tender! AWESOME!!

I brined a turkey years ago and it was amazing. I have not been able to find the recipe trying several that just didn't cut it  til now. This one is just as good as the first one. I got so many compliments on how juicy the turkey was not to mention my stuffing. Will use it every year. So glad I found this.
