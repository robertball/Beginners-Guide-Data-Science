Easy enough to make but next time I will use brown sugar instead of molasses.  I used rum instead of brandy.

So yummy! I used a little more butter, bourbon instead of brandy (that's what I had) and no nuts. So yummy! Next time I will try with nuts!

A simple and quick dessert I served over ice-cream, it was a good way to use two over-ripe bananas. I think you can use many choices of alcohol. I used butterscotch schnapps and omitted the molasses as I thought that would be sweet enough.  No pecans so substituted walnuts.

Delicious!  I didn't have molasses or brandy so I used dark Karo syrup and Grand Marnier.

This is crazy good, and the molasses doesn't overwhelm (as it often can).  So easy, so quick, and so tasty!  I'd recommend you start with a fairly firm banana, because it cooks quickly and could turn to mush if overcooked.  I served over half of a  vertically-cut pear which had very nice presentation.  This one's a keeper!

I used rum instead of brandy.  I thought it was nice.  My son did not care for it.
I think my stove must be hotter than most other stoves.  I heated the pan over medium heat and it still burned the butter the instant I put it in.

Oh my...can you say YUM? Good way to use up extra bananas, but this is SO good, I'd even buy them FOR this! I used the brandy, but I think it would work just as well with other liquors such as rum, maybe even Kahlua! The molasses does not overpower either, which is nice. I'm having some right now over vanilla ice cream. Thanks chervilla for an easy and excellent recipe that I'm sure to make again!

Really quick and easy.  A great topping for french toast, instead of using syrup or sugar.  I didn't have any pecans, and I added some strawberries too.
