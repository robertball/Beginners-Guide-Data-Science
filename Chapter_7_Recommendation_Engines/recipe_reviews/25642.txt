I made 2 cakes. The 1st one wasn't very appealing but it tasted great. The 2nd one looked beautiful and tasted even better. What did I do different the 2nd time? I read the cheesecake techniques article found on this website. I wrapped foil around the bottom of my pan & placed the pan on a cookie sheet. Then I filled the cookie sheet w/water. I baked the cheesecake for an hour then turned the oven off & let the cheesecake sit in the oven for another hour. This prevents the cake from sinking in the middle. Everyone loved it! It was delicious and I can't wait to make it again.

This recipe got rave reviews from my family on Christmas! One tip, which made this even easier to make: I used seedless raspberry jam instead of cooking the raspberries on the stove. I just microwaved 6 tablespoons of jam for 30 seconds before adding to the cheesecake. It was so much easier and tasted fantastic! I also microwaved the white chocolate with half-and-half with excellent results. I will definitely make this again! Everyone was so impressed!

This is SOOOOOOOOOOO delicious -- I've made it three times now, and it is already legendary within my extended family!  :-)  Just a couple of recommendations:  definitely double the amount of cookie crumbs used for the crust; one cup barely covers the bottom of the springform pan.  If you're using smashed up Oreos for your chocolate cookie crumbs (which is what I do), then you don't need anywhere near as much butter or sugar in the crust; the Oreo creamy filling provides lots of sweetness and stick-it-together-ness.  I use 2 cups crushed Oreos, only one tablespoon sugar, and 1/4 cup melted butter -- the crust comes out perfect that way.  Also, I'm not sure if I just have delinquently leaky springform pans or what, but the first time I made this, I ended up with melted butter dripping down from the bottom of the pan all over the bottom of my oven (quite a mess).  Now I put a jelly roll pan on the oven shelf below to catch the dripping butter, and all is well.  :-)  I have ended up with a few cracks in the top of the cheesecake each time I have made this, but once I pile on tons of white chocolate shavings/curls, no one is the wiser!  This cheesecake absolutely could NOT taste better -- people go CRAZY over it.

Loved it. I'm making this for the THIRD time tonight! Everyone who tried the last one said it was better than my mom's cheesecake... and that's saying a ton! 

A couple things though.. make sure you check it 15 minutes early. If it looks done in the over it will be OVER DONE on your plate! Tap the side of the pan with a spoon and if it jiggles as "one piece" rather than like jello, it's done. if it doesn't jiggle at all it's over done. 

And, If you're using a springform pan, you can put prachment paper on the bottom and it will just slide off the pan easly when it's time to cut it. 

And as for cutting perfect, clean pieces - run a clean, long, thin knife under hot water. Quickly dry it off with a towell and slice straight down and out. Repeat for EVERY SLICE! Yes, it will take a while - but you'll have beautiful, perfect slices. ^_^

I used 2 cups of Oreo crumbs (I put them in my food processor, cream and all) , 1 Tablespoon sugar and 1/4 cup butter for the crust in a 10 in springform pan. I also used seedless raspberry preserves and that significantly decreased the time I spent making this cheesecake. Heating the preserves up slightly in the microwave (10-15 secs) makes it very easy to drop in the batter. I was very easy and it came out very pretty and delicious.

I have made this cheesecake twice now. The first time i made it, I too, had a lot of trouble getting the raspberry seeds out which made the "raspberry swirl" almost non-existent, however, it tasted wonderful. The SECOND time I made it, I made just a few changes. I made it in a 10" springform pan, and used 4 cups of white chocolate chips to give it extra white chocolate flavor. I also doubled the water to make the raspberry sauce and added 3.5 tablespoons of sugar, which made it drain out and taste wonderfully! I will always make it like that now, and encourage everyone to try this recipe no matter how they make it, or what alterations they make!

I made this for my sister-in-law's birthday and it was heavenly! It has a creamy texture with undertones of white chocolate and raspberry. My sister-in-law said it tasted "professional." I doubled the crust using 2 cups of Oreo cookies, 1/4 cup of butter and 1 T. of sugar. Double the raspberry sauce. It's easier to puree the raspberries with the sugar, press the ingredients through a fine-mesh stainer and then cook it. I added 6 T. of raspberry sauce to the cake without it overpowering the taste. The white chocolate and half-and-half can be safely microwaved on HI for 1 minute, stirred throroughly, microwaved and stirred thoroughly. 2-1/2 to 3 minutes should do it. To prevent any leakage, I use a 9" x 3" cake pan.  Spray the bottom with Pam, add parchmant paper to the bottom and spray the parchmant. Cook the cheesecake in a water bath for the designated time. Remove from the water bath, carefully loosen the sides of the cake with an offset cake knife, then immediately refrigerate - uncovered - until morning. Never a crack. To remove the cake from the pan, heat water to almost boiling and gently dip the pan in (about 1") for 10 seconds. Turn the pan over on a large flat plate, tap the bottom and lift the pan away from the cake. Invert cake onto serving plate. If cake stays in pan, repeat the process. The cheesecake will not fall. I always do this with excellent results.

This is an EXCELLENT cheesecake!  I made it for my family Christmas dinner and everyone just raved about it!  I would not change a thing on this recipe!  I plan to make it for New Year's Eve!  A cheesecake tip, when the cheesecake is almost done, turn off your oven and open the oven door.  Do not take it out until the oven and cheesecake are completely cool.  This will avoid cracks.

This is a great recipe--everyone I've served it to, loved it.  I use oreos for the crust.  Put them in a ziplock bag and crush them with a meat mallet and rolling pin.  Also, blend the raspberries and water in the blender and strain the berries before you make the sauce, much easier to get the seeds out.  Save out a few raspberries to stir into the sauce that goes on top just before serving.  Nice with a bit of white chocolate melted with a little bit of milk and drizzled on top.

By far the most amazing cheesecake that I have ever eaten or created.   I (the husband) find that for any special event, it’s requested that I bake this.  Here are some tips however.  1) Multiply the crust recipe x1.5.  I have found that if you use what’s specified the crust will be a little thin.  And use Oreos! (Crush them in a freezer bag with a meat mallet.  2) You can use raspberry preserves (seedless) and save yourself some time w/o sacrificing quality.  3) Place parchment paper on the bottom of the spring form pan.  This will help moving the cake without damaging it.  4) Bake at 325 for 60 minutes and submerged in a water bath.  This is key as it will keep the sides from burning.  5) After 60 minutes, turn the oven off, prop the door open 2 inches and let the cake cool in the oven.  (Approx. 1-2 hours)  This will keep it from sinking in the middle.

Don't know where I went wrong, since everyone else is raving about this. I baked mine for 60 minutes. I cooled, then chilled it for 24 hours. When cut, the center was very mushy. It's like the raspberry sauce had soaked into it. On top it looked beautiful (see picture) so I was very surprised that it didn't hold its texture well. I served it at a guild function, and there wasn't one "swoon" which these ladies do for great, decadent desserts. Not one request for the recipe, which is  always the usual course of things (as a chef, I hate being asked to give out recipes. It's like asking a doctor to give out free prescriptions. But with this recipe, I didn't have to worry - no requests.) It tasted fine, though nothing spectacular. The white chocolate cannot even be tasted, especially disappointing since I used expensive, imported Belgian white chocolate. I shouldn't have bothered. I've made many other cheesecakes, including just straight ones with no specialty flavorings, that were much better. I'm a chef, and have worked extensively as a caterer and pastry chef, so no rookie here. As cheesecakes go, this was merely OK. Not bad, but certainly not exceptional. I know that flies in the face of all the other glowing reviews, but I'm being completely honest. At best, I'd describe this as aggressively mediocre.

The taste is awesome.  I didn't have enough experience with cheesecakes and so it didn't look perfect.  I had trouble getting the cake out of the pan.  It didn't crack and it wasn't lumpy thanks to all of the tips., the raspberry sauce was bang on and is worth the extra time.  I just wish I would've discovered some more tricks about baking a cheesecake.  Here is what I discovered:  Greese the sides and place wax paper on the bottom of the pan.  Must use water (HOT) bath for even cookings 1" of water on a cookie sheet. Wrap the pan in foil so water doesn't seep through.  DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN AFTER BAKING FOR 1 hour, leave the cake alone.  After the initial 1 hour baking and the 1 hour resting time in the oven then transfer to refrigerator.  Run a knife around the cake after it comes out of the oven so it doesn't stick to sides.   Take dental floss and slide it through the bottom like you would a spatula if it gets stuck like mine did.  Also mix the frozen raspberries water and sugar together and after it becomes melted then run through the wire strainer and then add the cornstarch to thicken.  Check for sweetness I had to add more sugar to the raspberry mixture.  Lastly, I cooked the crust first for 10 minutes and let it cool and then filled it with the cheesecake mixture.   IT IS WONDERFUL AND I WILL MAKE THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!! THANK YOU TO WHOMEVER ORIGINALLY SUBMITTED THIS

Great recipe!!!  Here's the solution for cracking...first, make sure your ingredients for the batter is at room temp before mixing.  Also, DO NOT over work the batter especially when adding the eggs.  Air will get trapped in the batter and when in the oven the air pockets expand and try to escape...thus, creating cracks on the surface.  Also, when cooling, DO NOT put it in the refrigerator right away.  Give it time to cool first.  The cake will shrink too fast and create cracks that way too.  Happy Baking!

Beat the eggs before mixing with the cream cheese.. One of the reasons cheescakes crack is because too much air is incorporated into the mixture..

This recipe is fabulous!  I've made it several times, including for a bake-off contest at work -- it won 1st prize!  I use chocolate graham crackers for the crust, and instead of pureeing fresh raspberries I use a 10-oz jar of seedless raspberry jam, microwaved just enough to make it spreadable.  Garnish with whole fresh raspberies, white chocolate shavings & drizzle with dark chocolate ganache (microwave  1/4 c. Hersheys special dark chips with 1 T. heavy cream till melted, stir till shiny & then put in a zip-top bag; snip off one corner & squeeze to drizzle over the top of the cake.)

I made this last week with a few changes.  I used real white chocolate as I wanted a more authentic flavor.  I used 8 blocks of the Baker's but felt that rendered just a little too subtle flavor, will use 10 next time and go from there.  Also, I used the raspberry jam per other's advice.  If you melt it slightly and drizzle it on (you can't let it drop in big chunks or it will sink and not mix in well) it will marble better.  To do this I drizzled the jam back and forth in parallel lines, then added the top layer and drizzled the same way.  Then turning the pan perpendicular to the jam lines, ran the knife gently through (make sure you go all the way to the bottom) using a back and forth motion (do not take the knife out of the cake as you do this)-the marbling turns out beautiful.  My family loved this one and hubby commented on how great the cake looked with the marbling.

Incredible!  I doubled the cookies for the crust, based on previous reviews and found that they were right.  One cup just wasn't enough.  I also cut down the sugar and butter on the crust and left the Oreo cream in - It does hold together just fine.  One thing that is not listed in the ingredients is extra white chocolate for shavings and/or raspberries for the topping.  Another hint:  be sure to follow the cheesecake rule of thumb and line your springform pan (bottom and sides) with wax paper and place the foil lined springform pan in a jellyroll pan with about 1/2" of water.  When the hour is up, turn off the oven, leave the door slightly ajar and allow to cool for another hour before removing and putting in the fridge.  This is a foolproof method for all cheesecake recipes to avoid cracks and sinking.  This recipe is very rich.  Thanks for sharing!

This cheesecake is absolutely fantastic! I read the reviews before making it and made the following changes to the crust as suggested- 2 cups crushed Oreos, 1 tablespoon sugar, and 1/4 cup melted butter. I also read that people were having a hard time straining the sauce so I cooked and continuously stirred sauce until berries were melted, strained it to remove seeds while it was still thin, then returned sauce to clean pan and allowed it to reduce. If you wait until the sauce is thick to strain the seeds it will be much harder! I also baked it as suggested by another review by wrapping the cake pan in foil and placing it on a broil pan, added water to broil pan, cooked for one hour and turned off the oven and allowed the cheesecake to sit for an hour. Only other suggestion it to allow your cream cheese and eggs to sit out for at least an hour before you make this. Room temp ingredients are key!

This is AWESOME!!!  Whenever I make this, people always ask, "Did you really make this??"  It is SO delicious and SO beautiful.  It has a silky, creamy, heavenly texture and the flavor is utter bliss.  This is truly not only the most delectable cheesecake, but the most beautiful cheesecake I've ever seen or made.  I always make and add extra raspberry puree.  I also press finely chopped toasted almonds around the entire outside of the cheesecake.  Then I garnish the individual slices with homemade whipped cream, fresh raspberries and blackberries, sprinkle it with white chocolate curls and shavings and some chopped almonds, and then drizzle it all with a good quality melted bittersweet chocolate.  A wonderful dessert that makes the moment and the people you make it for feel special...

Brought this to an adults only birthday party and it was a HUGE hit.  It was only my second cheesecake and I was apprehensive because my first attempt (using a different recipe) cracked.  I followed all the tips and the result was very professional in appearance.  I doubled the raspberry sauce recipe and poured it all over the finished (uncracked) product.  I used the leftover white chocolate chips by melting them and pouring them into a wax paper lined bowl, allowing the chocolate to harden into a block.  Using my vegetable peeler, I decorated the top of the cheesecake with white chocolate curls.  It was beautiful and delicious.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

Loved this cheesecake!!  I think I read every single review and followed several tips.  I made two cheesecakes, the 1st as a practice one that I sent to work with my husband, and the 2nd for my family on Christmas eve.  I made the 1st one using seedless raspberry preserves, and the 2nd using the frozen raspberry sauce, think I would recommend using the sauce if you have the time - better raspberry flavor and the preserves were a little thin and sunk into the cheesecake. (I think this may have caused the crack in the finished cheesecake as I followed the same baking technique in both and the 1st was the only one that cracked.) I also reduced the amount of butter in the crust by a tablespoon and used a little over a cup of crushed chocolate graham crackers, the 1st attempt had butter leaking through the springform pan, as other reviewers have said.  Also, be sure to scrape the bowl as you are mixing the cream cheese to avoid any lumps.  Looked great and tasted even better - got awesome reviews from my family and my husbands coworkers. One more thing, to make this cheescake fill my 9x13 in pan better, I added another pkg of cream cheese, an egg and a couple Tbsp of sugar to the recipes.  Turned out great!

As others have mentioned, this recipe does require quite a bit of preparation, but well worth it! I am a big fan of the Olive Garden's white chocolate raspberry cheesecake, and this tastes just like theirs! I made the cheesecake with Godiva White Chocolate, and served it with whipped cream and white chocolate shavings on top. Everyone loved this cheesecake!! I also mixed graham cracker crumbs and oreo cookie crumbs for the crust. Also, the idea of a water bath scares me a little, so I found a tip to cook the cheesecake with a pan of water directly underneath. When cooling, leave the cheesecake in the stove, and crack the oven door, and cool for six hours this way. This will minimize cracking.

Amazing cheesecake recipe!  However, even the best recipe can yield a less than perfect cheesecake if made with improper technique.  Bring ingredients to room temperature before beginning.  I doubled the cookie crumbs in the crust and used nearly a whole package of Oreos, but left butter the same.  I also didn't bother making my own raspberry sauce, seedless raspberry jam works beautifully and saves a ton of time.  Be careful not to over beat the batter as this will incorporate too much air and may cause cake to fall.  Preheated oven to 350 and turned it down to 250 immediately after I put cheesecake in oven.  Baked in a water bath for 1 1/2 hours and then turned oven off.  Leave cheesecake in oven for at least 3 hours to cool slowly (this prevents it from falling and cracking).  Once cheesecake is cool, refrigerate until ready to serve.  I've made this twice now and received rave reviews each time.  This one is a keeper!  Thanks a million, CindyAnn!

The white chocolate chips added such a unique flavor and texture I never would have expected. This recipe was not as difficult as it sounds either. Yum!

I put the thawed raspberries in a food processor with the 1/2 cup of water and then strained them with no problem. Then I cooked them on the stove top with the sugar and cornstarch until thick, left it cool a little and spread it on top of the cooked and cooled cheesecake. I just felt like I needed something else on top so I did a search and found a big snowflake at southernliving.com. They even have a stencil to print out. I always do a water bath for cheesecake and they never crack.

One of the best cheesecakes I’ve ever made. I am not a fan of white chocolate, but that ingredient seemed to help the texture more than the flavor the cake. It’s very creamy and not too sweet. I compiled a list of the tips I followed:

-I used 6T of heated seedless jam (not jelly, not preserves)     
-22 Oreos (regular – not double-stuff) with ½ stick butter made a great crust.    
-I lined the pan with waxed paper, wrapped the whole pan in foil (for water-proofing) and placed the pan on a cookie sheet filled with 1/2" water.
     -After 55 minutes of baking, I turned off the
 oven, opened the door and let it cool completely in the oven.     
-I made it the day before so it could thoroughly chill.     
-I cut it with fishing line, then used a thin knife to slice the cookie crust.

This is a wonderful cheesecake.  Very light and delicious.  I used pre-packaged Oreo cookies crumbs.  They were actually $1.00 cheaper than the chocolate wafers and already crushed.  I had to bake 20 minutes longer than recipe specified.  I whipped 1/2 pint of heavy whipping cream 2 tablespoons of sugar and 1 teaspoon instant white chocolate pudding and piped it on top with a pastry bag, drizzled on raspberry sauce and topped white chocolate curls.  It looked professional and like it was a lot of work when it really wasn't.  Don't hesitate to try this recipe!

Cake is great, not hard, just a pain in the but. Think about having to get rid of all the seeds in the raspberries. Good though.
Get cookie crumbs from the baking section as opposed to chocolate wafers from the cookie section. That's 40% of your time right there!

I work at the Olive Garden and was determined to make a cheescake just like the one we serve. THIS CHEESCAKE IS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!! My mom went CrAzY over it, and my dad, who ONLY likes plain cheesecake, LOVED IT!! I couldn't stop eating it yesterday... I ate it for dessert after every meal and snack hehe =) For the crust I used the chocolate cookies from Oreo's and scraped out the filling. I also made a Raspberry sauce with my frozen raspberries: 2 1/2 cups raspberry juice, 1 cup sugar, and 4 teaspoons cornstarch. Delicious!!! It's even better every day it sits in the refrigerator. Make sure you wait at least 8 hours to eat like it says, it's much better after that!!

"This is the best cheesecake I think I've ever eaten," is what my sister said while eating this cheesecake which happened to be the first cheesecake I ever 
made!  I did research ALOT before making this cheesecake and I changed it up to a BLUEBERRY and white chocolate cheesecake instead of the raspberry ( which also meant that I didn't have to deal with those pesky seeds ) besides the cool factor of the blueberry cheesecake versus a raspberry or strawberry, the taste and texture were off the charts with this recipe!!!  TIPS that helped me achieve cheesecake perfection were...  Filling a muffin tin half full of water and baking cake on top of that to keep moisture in oven while cooking without making the crust soggy.  Also I took some other advice to preheat oven to 350, then right as you put your cake in turn the oven down to 250 and bake for an hour and a half versus one hour.  After the hour and a half  were up turn the oven off, keep the door shut and leave cake in for 3 additional hours before moving in to the fridge.  My very first cheesecake did not crack or sink and it was AMAZING!!!! I also found a simple recipe for a white chocolate cream sauce and instead of topping with remaing fill made earlier, I made the warm cream sauce, poured it over whole frozen blueberries (let them sit for a minute so that the warm chocolate cream sauce could warm the berries a bit), and spooned it over each individual slice. My friends and husband were in awe :)

This cheesecake is absolutely sublime.  While others may have complained it was difficult to make, I found it very easy and feel that something as delicious as this recipe is certainly worth the time and effort.  I used frozen raspeberries from my garden and used cheesecloth in a strainer to remove the raspberry seeds with little problems.  If you are looking for a divine dessert, do not hesitate to make this!

I didn't add the raspberries and just made the cheesecake and instead of oreos (not a huge fan of that cookie or its crust) used golden oreos instead. Bought smuckers strawberry topping for the side if people wanted it and made a combo of sour cream/brown sugar as an optional topping too. Plain or with a fruit topping or sour cream topping very good and for me pretty easy to put together. Follow the cheesecake tips on this site and you won't be sorry such as making sure your cream cheese at room temp, eggs at room temp add those one at a time, and a water bath etc. really help with the end result esp. texture. And don't over beat! Also not a bad idea to cover the bottom and a bit up the sides of the ban with foil just in case of spring form pan leakage.

This cake was just superb! I baked it in a waterbath to prevent cracking, and it came out perfectly although it did need to be baked longer given that heating in a waterbath is a gentler method of cooking than baking straight in the pan. To garnish, I placed a few raspberries in the centre of the cake before serving, as well as resting some long white chocolate curls on top of the raspberries. (To make the curls I melted some white chocolate in a long strip, about 3 inches wide. I then let the chocolate sit for a few minutes until it was slightly firm, and took a long knife and scraped it against the chocolate. The chocolate was still malleable enough to shape it into lovely curls). I made it for my boyfriend when he had friends over, and everyone was surprised when they found out I baked it- they thought it was store-bought! Definitely worth the effort!! Thanks, Cindy:o)

This recipe is absolutely fabulous.  I've had so many cheesecake flops in the past that I hesitated.   For the crust, I used 2 cups crushed oreos and 1/4 cup butter (no sugar needed--it's sweet enough without).  I used seedless raspberry jam instead of frozen.  I also wrapped the bottom of the pan with foil and placed in a cookie sheet with water in the oven.  Baked at 325 for one hour, then turned the oven off; opened the door for 1 or 2 minutes, closed the oven back up and left the cake to cool in the oven, in the water bath for another hour.  Perfect cheesecake!

It was just okay.  The raspberry sauce did not make alot.  It really tasted like a cheese cake, I could not detect the white chocolate/rapsberry.

I bake for a caterer and recently made this because they requested raspberry cheesecake.  Excellent reviews on the test cake.  I added 3 tablespoons Raspberry Liqueur to the sauce.  I used a jelly roll pan with water for a water bath.  Baked the cake until it was 145 degrees in the center, turned off the oven and let it set in the oven for about another half hour until it reached 160 degrees.  No cracks, perfect consistency.  I also use a bambo skewer to make the swirls so you get a very beautiful "professional" appearance on the top.  This recipe goes into my "special" cookbook.

Very good cheesecake.  Tips: Grease all sides and bottom of the springform pan.  Use 2 cups of ground Oreo cookies, 2tbs of sugar and 6 tbs of butter for the crust.  If you don't have half and half use heavy cream.  For the raspberry sauce use 2tbs of cornstarch instead of 2 tsp.  For the cheesecake filling using 3/4 cup and 2 tbs of sugar.  I also used 1/4 cup (total of 1/2 cup) of the raspberry syrup on the top and middle of the cheesecake. 
Bake in water-bath. 
Although everyone's oven is different, I would definitely bake this for 60 minutes.  Turn off oven, crack the door and allow to firm up (about 10 minutes).

Absolutely fantastic recipe.  I make a vanilla wafer crust and I think that it really makes the cheesecake, the first time that I made it, I felt that the chocolate was overwhelming.  I crush vanilla wafers to make 2 cups and add 6 tbs. melted butter and press into pan.  I have tried the shortcut of using jam and it was not nearly as good, the jam is very sweet and the sauce in this recipe is very tart, and perfect, take the time and make the sauce.  Every time I make this I end up having people offer to pay me to make them one, so I do, I have made many many of these cheesecakes now.  I bake in a springform wrapped in two layers of wide heavy duty foil and bake in a water bath.  I bake until the temp of the filling is between 150-160 degrees (no higher or the eggs will coagulate and the filling will not be as smooth), poke the cheesecake in a swirl and you won't create a hole in  your cheesecake.  Another tip is to never "whip" your filling, make sure that the cream cheese and eggs are at room temp and it will be smooth, whipping the filling will cause it to rise and puff, and when it settles it may crack.  I have very creamy, crack free cheesecakes with this method.

A few criticisms...  My family and I found the raspberry sauce to be far too tangy.  Next time, I'm going to add an extra tablespoon of sugar to see if that helps.  Another thing I noticed is the cheescake filling doesn't taste much like white chocolate (though it is yummy).  Also, I thought that a graham cracker crust might have gone over better than the chocolate cookies.  Overall, it was a good cheescake, but it would be better with a few tweaks.

As other people noted, it took a while to remove the seeds from the raspberry sauce, but it was worth it.  I took this cheesecake to a family birthday party, and it was the first dessert eaten.  I got rave reviews!

Fairly time consuming, but cheesecake looks very impressive and tastes delicious!  I could barely bring myself to wait the recommended 8 hour refrigeration time to serve!

This is super easy and definitely a crowd pleaser! I just made the recipe into individual portions using a muffin tin and cupcake liners and it worked great!

I am not a big fan of cheesecake and over this past weekend I made this for my boyfriend. OMG! this recipe is simply delicious and so simple to make. I had never made cheesecake before and my first experience was definitely a great one. Since I used a 7" springform pan I ended up making two cheesecakes... one looked better than the other one but both tasted delicious. We also used low-fat cream cheese... Don't know if the calorie content is any lower but the taste makes you forget and just makes you want to indulge and such a great tasting treat.

I made this cheesecake to bring to a dinner with my in-laws and it was a huge hit! My husband says that if he could give it 6 stars he would. I saw that some reviewers substituted jam for the raspberry sauce, but I followed the recipe and I think it was worth the extra trouble. It's nice to be able to control the sugar and it just tastes so fresh (even though I used frozen berries!) Oh- the only thing I did that wasn't part of the recipe was use a water bath. There is a step-by-step guide to making cheesecake on this site and it is very straightforward. Excellent recipe- I will make this again and again!

I was hesitant as to whether to review this recipe or not. It hit me when it was cooling that I had forgotten to add the cream with the chocolate. However, it turned out so well despite that rather large omission that I had to at least say thank you for sharing the recipe. The texture was heavenly, the taste and presentation outstanding. The white chocolate flavor was very prominent and, paired with the raspberry, insanely delicious. I topped and decorated the cake with 'sturdy whipped cream frosting' from this site which was a perfect, subtle match that took the cake over the top. This is without a doubt one of the best desserts I have served, ever (I have to say, it even rivals my own cheesecake on that point!) Thanks, CindyAnn.

I made this for new years, and it turned out great.  I was short on time, so I just used strawberry preserves instead of making the raspberry sauce.  I used oreos for the crust, so I didn't add any sugar and it was plenty sweet.  Even DH liked it, and he's not a fan of white chocolate

I thought I had already found the greatest cheesecake recipe out there, but I was wrong. THIS IS IT! I love white chocolate and raspberry together, and it just goes so wonderfully with one another in this recipe I accidently used a 10" springform pan, but it just made it a bit thinner. I used oreos without the icing for the crust and it was divine

Takes some time to prepare as far as cheesecakes go, but the end product is fabulous.  Served to six people and all agree it is the best cheesecake they've ever eaten.  Worth the effort for special occasions.  Will definitely make for every holiday from now on.

THE BEST, MOST AMAZING CHEESECAKE EVER!!!  I always use raspberry seedless jam in place of all the boiling raspberry work and crush about 25 Oreos and add 1/4 cup of butter for my crust.  I TELL ANYONE WHO WILL LISTEN ABOUT THIS RECIPE!  It's that good!  soooooo yummy!!!  If I could give it 6 out of 5 I would.

OMG!!  This was sooo YUMMY!  Made this for the first time last week - doubled Oreo cookie crumbs and used seedless raspberry spread as others suggested.  Also wrapped my springform pan with foil and filled my cookie sheet with water.  Baked 55 minutes and let cool with the oven door open for 30 minutes - turned out PERFECT!  Tasted as good as it looked!  I will definitely be making this again!!

This becomes a five with minor modifications. First, I wrapped the bottom of the cheesecake with foil and baked it for an hour in a water bath. Then I turned the oven off and let it sit in the oven for another hour. Removed and cooled to room temperature before chilling overnight. The cheesecake was very creamy and dense, just the way I like it. I was disappointed in the raspberry sauce. It was too tart, even after adding extra sweetener. And the total of 6 T in the cheesecake was not nearly enough. I did plate the cheesecake on the leftover sauce, and this made it more "raspberry-ey", but as I said, the sauce was too tart. Next time, I think I'll skip the raspberry and flavor it with something else. I used homemade chocolate nut cookies for the crust and it was divine. I was able to remove the cheesecake from the cake pan bottom for easy slicing and storing of individual pieces. Next time I think I'll top the crust with a thick layer of hot fudge before baking for a really decadent treat!

This cheesecake is amazing!!  So easy and delicious.  I baked mine in a water bath to prevent cracking and then covered in a dark chocolate ganache and  decorated with white chocolate ribbons and then lined the border with fresh raspberries.   This is the best cheesecake recipe I have found.

I made this cheesecake for Valentine dessert for my family.  My husband, kids and friends I shared it with all raved. I don't have a single bad thing to say about this recipe! It was phenomenal. The only thing I did different is I doubled the Oreo cookie crust amount to give it a little extra.  I followed the advise of other posters and baked it in a water bath for one hour then turned the oven off and let the cake sit in the oven for an additional hour. Not a single crack and it didn't sink in the middle at all. It turned out perfect. This was my first attempt at cheesecake and I will for sure be making this again. Thanks so much for a great recipe! :)

With so many positive reviews I thought I can't go wrong, but... The taste of the white chocolate was way too strong, it overpowered the taste of the cheese, and made it too sweet. I've added almost all of the raspberries and still couldn't taste it. I just don't understand how someone complained that they couldn't taste the white chocolate and someone else was able to eat it doubling the amount of the chocolate! Needless to say, the consistency of cheesecake was too soft, almost runny, and it didn't create a good presentation on the plate. Good cheesecake should be more firm, not like a pudding as one of the reviewers said. Because it was too soggy, I had hard time taking it out off the spring-pan. I followed the recipe exactly, except I've used a water-bath while baking, made sure that all ingredients are room temperature, to prevent cracking etc. I even read the cheesecake techniques article found on this website and watched several chefs on YouTube. It didn't crack, it didn't sink in the middle, but not thanks to the instructions of this recipe - it came out fine because I read how the pros are doing it - cook it for 1 hour on 250 degrees, then turn off the oven and let it cool inside for another hour, then keep in the fridge over night. I've used Graham crackers instead and it was by far the tastiest part of the cheesecake! I will keep looking and trying different recipes, because this one is far away from being a "restaurant quality" cheesecake.

Made for Kyle's 18th birthday but substituted a Graham Cracker Crust to his favor!  (2 cups cinnamin graham crackers, 1/3 cup butter & 2 large tablespooons sugar).  I also baked my crust for 6 minutes for a crisper (not soggy) crust before I added the filling.  I used seedless raspberry preserves (much easier) as it microwaved splendidly after 30 seconds.  Microwave the chips and half & half was much easier too.  I did use a water bath for cooking (lining the bottom of my pan with aluminum foil.) Cooked for 1 hour and then set it oven for 1 hour with door slightly ajar.  (My cake did not crack or fall, however, the top browned a bit more so next time I may move the rack one notch.)...it may have been up one more notch than usual do to Thanksgiving cooking. ?  ....just keep an eye on it for future reference.

You KNOW it's a good recipe when people say it looks and tastes professional looking, and I didn't use a springform pan! You really don't need one, it's easier to use a normal pan as there is no chance of the water bath seeping in at all and presentation isn't really affected. This was my first ever cheesecake and I got no bubbles or cracks, definitely read the cheesecake tips articles and the one about cheesecake slicing as it definitely helps with presentation. I used the oreo crust other commenters recommended. It worked perfectly, even removing from the pan. It's so delicious too! and quite easy. The only thing to really make sure you do is to mix slowlllly and not a low or pulse on a slow speed if in an electric mixture.

This didn't quite work out for me for 2 reasons. The white chocolate that I used gave off a ton of grease during baking, which seeped into the crust and made it mushy. So use the best you can find.  Also, some of the larger globs of raspberry sauce caused the cake to form these huge cracks, so the final result wasn't pretty. But it could have been if I had evenly drizzled a thin ribbon of the sauce instead of trying to be artistic and clever. So it's all my fault, and the cake will probably come out fine if you watch out for those two mistakes. Oh, and do yourself a favor and use a waterbath.

This recipe yields truly phenomenal results! I think the key is having a lot of patience with the many "phases" it requires.  I follow all the instructions and ingredient quantities as outlined. Start with room temperature cream cheese and eggs, mix on the lowest settings of your stand mixer. Drizzle the melted white chocolate into the batter while the mixer is slowly turning and when adding to your spring form pan do not scape any chunks of cream cheese that did not fully incorporate into the batter. Bake in a water bath until the temperature in the center reaches 160. This took my oven 90 minutes at 325! I then turn the oven off and leave it in there for an hour. When the cake comes out of the oven and water bath I run a thin knife around the edge and allow it to cool to room temperature. I then put it in the frig overnight but uncovered to allow the moisture and condensation to escape. In the morning, I put it in a sealed cake carrier, still in the frig. An hour before serving I cut the cake with a very thin knife and then allow it to come to room temperature for a perfect consistency.

This is a fantastic recipe.  It is absolutely the best tasting cheesecake bar none. I used the oreo cookies and crushed them by hand in a zip lock bag and the crust was perfect. I left the cheesecake in the oven and let it sit for 2 hours after it was done leaving the door open and I didn't have a single crack. I  traced around the inside of the 10' spring form pan and placed it in the fridge. When I took it out I used a knife i ran under hot water and smoothed the sides and they came out perfect. I also lined the bottom of the pan with parchment paper and I separated the bottom out easily and transferred it to a nice serving platter. I served it with homemade whipped cream and drizzled the plates with raspberry sauce and chocolate ganash.

Delicious! This is a huge hit in my family.  I did increase the cookie crumbs and decreased the butter amount slightly.  I baked it in a water bath and it came out perfectly.  No cracks, no sagging. I will definitely make this one again....and again...and again!

This is the best cheesecake I have not only made but the best I have ever eaten.  I follow the recipe exactly and it comes out perfect every time.  A water bath is a must for any cheesecake and leave it in the oven with the door cracked for 45 minutes to an hour.

Amazing recipe! I followed the ingredients exact, but cooked it a little different to prevent cracking. I placed it in the oven at 325 in a water bath for an hour and a half. Then turned off the oven, cracked the door open and let it sit for one more hour. After that I put it in the fridge for the night.  Not a single crack and perfectly set. Looked just like the picture!

This was amazing. I followed the recipe exactly except I had to bake it for an hour and a half. I covered the bottom of the pan with foil and put a pan of water on the bottom shelf of the oven. It came out with no cracks, it didn't sink in. it was perfect! after the hour and half I opened the oven door and let it sit in there for an hour then put it in the freezer for three hours. noone believed that I actually made it. Thank you so much.

Excellent cheesecake! Everything about this was delicious, from the chocolately crust, to the tart raspberry swirl, to the rich, smooth, creamy, white chocolatey cheesecake. I made this exactly as written. One thing  I absolutely love about this recipe is that instead of just swirling the raspberry on the top of the cake, you add part of it in the middle of the cheesecake, so there are delicious pockets of tart raspberry all throughout the slice instead of just on top. It makes for a prettier presentation and a more "raspberry flavored" slice. This is a great recipe that I'll be making again...thanks for sharing!

GREAT! I made it with graham cracker instead of the oreos crumbs (was on a time crunch!). It wasnt very pretty but it tasted amazing! Cudos all around! Did it in a pie pan (count find spring!) still great!

Impressive and indulgent - the flavor of this cheesecake is to die for!  I doubled cookie crumb + 1T sugar + 1/4 cup butter based on reviews, but will try just 1 c for thinner, more subtle chocolate taste.  It's the cheesecake that should shine!  1 pkg of Ghiradelli white chocolate chips = 2 cups.  Simmer, don't boil, water under double broiler - smoother consistency in chips.  I have a dark springform pan and user instructions suggest decreasing temp by 25 (dark pans cook faster).  Bad idea... this baby baked for 1 hr 15 min. PLUS.  Over cooked.  Will master baking to perfection and it'll be a show stopper!

I love cheesecake and have made dozens over the years. This is by far the best recipe I've come across. The best results come from following cheesecake tips, wrapping the pan in foil, placing on a cookie sheet, adding water to the sheet, baking 1 hour then cooling 1 hour without opening the oven door. I've tried variations of this cake with blueberries and blackberries and they all come out excellent! I don't think I'll every try another cheesecake recipe again!

I used seedless raspberry jam and thought it tasted great. I was a little worried it might have that artificial jelly flavor but it didn't. I couldn't really taste much white chocolate.

I made the poor man's as well as easy version of this cheesecake, and it was absolutely fantastic!  As suggested by others, I used seedless raspberry jam instead of raspberries and just heated it in the microwave.  I also heated my white chocolate in the microwave.  DO look at this websites Baking Cheesecake tips!  I was nervous about cracks or uneven cooking as it was my first cheesecake ever.  But, I followed there tips and it was PERFECT.  Also, I didn't have a springform pan, so I just used a tall round disposable pan, and it worked perfectly fine.  No, I could take it all out and have it look as pretty as the one in the picture, but if you don't have a springform pan make this anyway.  Don't be afraid of the cheesecake (I was a little).  It's really delicious and, especially if you do these little microwave shortcuts, it's not difficult.

I've made this cheesecake twice now and it has blown people away! Give yourself a break and make the raspberry sauce from seedless raspberry jam and water. I think it tastes better!

After reading several reviews, I changed a few things and this cheesecake came out PERFECTLY!      CRUST: I doubled it by using 2 cups of Oreo crumbs. I only used 5 Tbs. of butter because Oreos have cream, and I omitted the sugar.    TO CUT THE PREP TIME IN HALF:  I used a 10oz jar of raspberry jam with seeds, heated in the microwave for 15 seconds to make it more saucy.  I also simply melted the white chocolate in whole milk(had it on hand instead of half & half) over low heat in a saucepan while I was preparing the crust.    FOR BAKING: I covered the bottom of my springform pan with foil and baked it in a water-filled cookie sheet at 325 deg. for 1hr 15min.  Then I turned off the oven and kept the cheesecake in the oven until the oven was room temp.  Then I let the cheesecake cool completelty on the counter, and finally put it in the fridge overnight.

Fantastic cheesecake! I baked it about 10 more minutes to my tastes but it could have to do with elevation/humidity... it was not cooked enough at the suggested time.

Delicious! I had some blackberries that a friend picked and gave me, and made the sauce out of them. I also used half sugar, half Splenda, egg substitute, and a cinnamon graham cracker crust, to try to make it a little healthier for my diabetic grandma. It all turned out perfectly, and the whole family loved it! I will definitely use this recipe again and again!

This cheesecake is to die for!!!  The only changes I made were to the crust... just added more cookie and reduced sugar.  I also cooked it in a water bath... a necessity for a good cheesecake.  Let it cool completely before you put it into the fridge. I swore I would never use another cheesecake recipe, but this is an excellent alternative.  Friends were lining up for this one!!!

Truly excellent! I made this for a birthday gathering and it was a smashing success. My guests could not stop raving about it, and the cheesecake was gone in short order--despite also having two French Silk pies on the table. 

The one change I made to this recipe was that I used 1/2 cup more cookie crumbs than called for. I found chocolate graham crackers which worked like a charm. 

I baked it in a water-bath (which I do any time I make a cheesecake) and then left it in the oven with the door closed for one hour before bringing it out to cool to room temperature. No cracks, and the perfect consistency.

Do not substitute seedless raspberry jam for the homemade raspberry sauce! Seedless jam is very sweet (I had some on hand and did a comparison taste test) while the homemade raspberry sauce combines a light sweetness with a fresh, fruity tartness that jam in a jar simply cannot compete with. Take the extra 10 minutes and make the sauce --trust me, it will be well worth it.

Oh my was this good!!! Made only one change to the recipe: used 2 cups of Oreo crumbs (kept the butter at 1/4 c.) & used 1 T. sugar. Baked for 1 hour (in a water bath)...be sure to wrap the bottom of your springform pan with foil if you want to use a water bath, so the water won't leech into the cheesecake. After it was done baking, I turned off the oven, and cracked the oven door. I let the cheesecake set in the oven for 1 hour more, than removed & let cool. Absolutely perfect - no cracks. The cheesecake has a subtle, yet flavorful white chocolate flavor (not overpowering) and the amount of raspberry sauce in the cake was perfect...the extra was great w/ the cheesecake & will also be great with waffles tomorrow morning.

This cheesecake is great! This was my first time making cheesecake so I was scared to do it but there are some very helpful hints here on AR. Just type in cheesecake up in the article search. I used a water bath. I left the cheesecake in the oven for an hour after it was done baking. I cracked the oven door once and then shut it back. I didn't have one crack in the cake. I also used a blender to mix the cream cheese and eggs. I hand mixed the sugar and cream cheese and then put that mixture in the blender with eggs. I blended it as little as possible and this turned out great. Thanks for sharing :-)

I didn't use Oreos but chocolate graham crackers (I crushed them into crumbs myself).  I would highly recommend adding a dash of cinnamon to the chocolate crust.  There is something AMAZING about chocolate and cinnamon.  I read reviews about making the sauce vs. raspberry preserves, and since I couldn't find seedless preserves, I opted to make my own sauce since I had invested so much effort into the cheesecake already.  I'm so glad I did.  The slight tartness in the sauce balanced the sweetness of the cheesecake.  Also, since I made this for a large crowd, I doubled the recipe and used a 10" springform pan.  Everything barely fit, and because my pan was so big, I didn't have anything big enough to make a water bath.  I remedied the lack of a water bath by decreasing baking temperature to 200F for 70 minutes.  Leave the pan in the UNopened oven for ~2 hours.  Remember not to overbeat your batter so that you're not incorporating too much air.  Let the cheesecake cool to almost room temp before you put it in the fridge - going from a warm oven to a cold fridge will cause the cheesecake to pull from the sides too fast and cause cracks.  I ended up with a creamy cheesecake, at least when the recipe was doubled in a 10" pan.  MARVELOUS!

I just baked this, this past Thursday night for a Friday night dinner.  I took a lot of the hints posted (water bath, seedless raspberry jam (I used Dickinson's brand), turned off the heat and the end of the baking time and left the cake in the oven to cool (but next time I'll crack the oven door open a bit).  The cake didn't have a single crack in it and it didn't sink!  Yeah!

I did add a bit more white chocolate to the half n half.  

And I decorated it with white chocolate chips ont the top (at the edge) then added dollops of a whip cream/cream cheese frosting and put a fresh raspberry in each dollop.  I put an edible orchid in the center and small edible flower (similar in color to the raspberries and the orchid) next to each raspberry in the dollops.  Added a couple more white chocolate chips next to/around the orchid and put it in a cake box.  The hostess thought I bought this cake!!!  And it got RAVE reviews from everyone....absolutely NO leftovers!!!  And my boyfriend, who was the real one I wanted to impress, LOVED IT! A definite keeper!

p.s.  Used a chocolate graham crackers for the crust.  Also used parchment paper on the pan.  Crust was very moist, but everyone loved it!

This was the very best cheesecake EVER!  I did make some changes, I added a brownie mix on top of the cookie crust, baked that for about 25 minutes first, I used real white chocolate squares instead of the chips, I like the flavor much better! I also used seedless jam to save time as many others suggested.  I baked the whole thing in a water bath, I use a turkey roasting bag to set the cheesecake into to keep the water out instead of foil, works great, just roll the edge down! Baked about 1 1/2 hours.  It was to die for!!!  FABULOUS!!!!  The best Valentines cheesecake ever!

Very, very good. I made some changes- I doubled the crust but it was kind of chewy so next time I will just double the crumbs & suger & leave the butter ammount the same. I doubled the raspberry sauce- it was a real pain to make, very tedious. I don't have a metal bowl, only glass bowls so I cooked the chocolate & half & half in a small pot & it worked out fine. I had to cook it 20 mins extra. After it was done, I turned off the oven & left it in the oven with the door open for a few hours to minimize cracking. My husband loved this. Thanks Cindy.

This cheesecake was the hit of the party.  I've made a lot of cheescakes in my life and this is "the one"!  I used 2 cups of crushed oreo's and left out the sugar.  I also lined my springform pan with foil and (sprayed with pam) so the butter wouldn't seep out.  The rasp. jam worked great.

This was amazing, people thought I bought it.  I forgot to strain the raspberries to remove the seeds, but you couldn't even detect them when you ate it.  If I were making this again I would try swirling it after adding the raspberries the first time and then do it again after all the batter has been used.  I found that there were not enough raspberries toward the bottom.  Also, do not make in an 8" pan - it bakes up really high and will spill over in the oven!

This Cheesecake really is quite impressive! I have made it for several years now and it is my husband’s favorite. He is always looking for an occasion that he can ask me to make it. Reading the comments helped make it even better. Here’s the changes I made and use every time I make this.
1.	Line the spring form with Parchment Paper on the bottom of the pan using a little cooking spray to keep the paper in the pan and then a little cooking spray on top of the Parchment paper before adding the crust. This makes your cheesecake pieces come out of the pan perfectly.
2.	Double the size of the Crust: Using 2 cups of Oreo Cookie Crumbs, ¼ cup butter and 1 Tablespoon of Sugar (Food process the whole Oreo, filling and all) These alternate butter and sugar measurements make up for the sweetness and stickiness of the Oreo cookie.
3.	Add more White Chocolate: 3 Cups of White Chocolate Chips and ¾ cup of Half and Half
4.	Use a Water Bath: Place foil around the bottom of spring form pan and place on a cookie sheet. Once in the oven, pour water into the cookie sheet until the cookie sheet looks like it is about to overflow.
5.	Change the Baking Time: Bake for 1 hour, then turn off the oven and let the cheesecake sit in the oven for another hour. This really prevents cracking!

For a never fail way to bake this cheesecake without cracks start with a short period, 10 minutes say, in a hot oven (425F)
then take the temperature right down quickly (leaving the door ajar to aid cooling) to a slow/very slow (260-270F) for about 40 minutes, or until it feels springy.
then switch off and leave the cheesecake to cool inside the oven, slowly as the oven cools itself with the door shut.
Using this method I've never had any cracks, the cheesecake stays very moist due to a quick "sear" at the start, then slow cooking and a slow cool-down to avoid cracks.

The taste is really great. Unfortunately it was a bit undercooked. Acceptable for first timer like me!

Well, another glowing review for this recipe!! I made this along with 2 other cheesecakes for a luncheon. It was so pretty and well recieved. I did make some changes based on many of the reviews. I added an extra egg, 8oz block of cream cheese, a third cup of white chocolate chips and used a 10 inch springform. I also subbed seedless raspberry preserves for the sauce with great results. I used parchment in the pan, put a pan of water on the shelf below the cheesecake, baked an hour, "cracked" the oven and turned it off an additional hour or until the oven had cooled. I covered with saran and refrigerated overnight. Slide a knife around the sides and release the springform, cut with a hot knife and then decorated with fresh berries. That made it easy for guests to take a nicely decorated piece.  Thank you!

Incredible. Just delicious!
I baked mine in a water bath, as I always do with cheesecakes to ensure they don't crack.

I made this cheesecake for Valentine's Day and it is AMAZING!!!!!  I used seedless strawberry jam, added a tsp. of water and heated it in the microwave before adding it to the cheesecake.

I also followed the directions of others and wrapped my pan in foil and placed in a water bath.  Cooked for 1 hour without opening the oven.  Turned the oven off and let it remain in there for 1 more hour.  After that I cooled it on the counter before refrigerating.

Also, I don't care for Oreo crusts (too sweet).  i used 1 3/4 c. graham cracker crumbs mixed with 1/3 c. butter and 1/4 c. sugar, pressed into the bottom of the pan.

IMPORTANT!!!  Use wax paper, sprayed w/ Pam in the bottom of your springform pan.  BUTTER the sides of the pan.  This will prevent sticking and cracks.

I refrigerated mine for 6 hours before slicing.  No cracks, no breaks, perfect crust, perfect amount of browning on the edges, none in the center.

IT CAME OUT PERFECT!!!!! And the taste?  Incredible!

This is an amazing cheesecake.  As others have suggested I used Oreo cookies and less sugar for the base.  I also decided to use pure seedless raspberry jam with no extra sugar or cornstarch. It looked beautiful.  I served with a fresh raspberry sauce and white chocolate shavings. The sauce I made by cooking down fresh raspberries with some sugar (to taste) and a tablespoon of Grand Marnier.  Once cooled it can be refrigerated for about 2 weeks.  My husband is a huge cheesecake fan and very picky, this one he has declared is a keeper!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I was asked to make it for Christmas Eve (6 people), and for Christmas as well(40 people). On each occasion I used the 6-cup silicone pans. I have three for a total of 18 small cheesecakes. People loved them and they are just the right size. They come off easily from the pans. Another tip, that I use for the crumbs is I tamp them down with a small vanilla bottle covered with press-n-seal plastic wrap. It is just the right size for the small container and prevents any breakage when picking up the small cakes.

SOOO good. I made this for christmas dinner for my family and everyone loooved it. My friend asked me to save him a piece and let's just say...I'll have to make him another one some other time. I baked it in a water bath to reduce cracking on top and make sure to pull it out while the middle is still jiggly so that it stays creamy after chilling.

I make this at least once a year for a special occasion. I used the  tip from CLENSONMAV using the seedless jam. Too easy! My experience is more people do not care for crusts. (Maybe it's just a local thing). I eliminate the crust & just make the cake. It's still yummy, and less fuss.

I've made this cheese cake a few times and it's a big hit every time. My sister suggested I use seedless raspberry preserves to cut down on the time it takes to boil down and strain fresh berries but I have to say the flavor was not nearly as good the one time I did it. It is definitely worth the effort to use fresh berries. This is a great cheese cake. I wouldn't change a thing.

Have made several times for large parties, always the first dessert gone!  A little labor intensive but well worth it.  I follow directions exactly.  Still have a little trouble with the top cracking but I think that must be my technique.  Highly recommend

Very yummy recipe, the only reason I didn't give this five stars is because I made some alterations like some previous reviews suggested. Instead of the cookie crumbs and excess butter I used full oreos that I had crushed and cut the butter amount in half to an 1/8 of a cup.  I also wrapped the bottom of my springform in foil and placed the entire thing on a cookie tray that I had filled with water, the water in the oven assists with even cooking and avoiding the sunken look after it is done baking.  Also, after the cheesecake is done cooking for the hour, I turned the oven off but left the cheesecake in the oven until the oven had cooled, then moved it to the fridge.  It was very difficult to strain the raspberries for the sauce, it was a long process that required me to press the mixture into the mesh strainer with a spoon and demand that someone entertain me while I waited for it to seep through (game of boggle anyone?) It was a delicious recipe and highly praised...just not one I would be willing to make weekly.

This. Is. Delicious.  And I highly recommend putting fresh raspberries on top; it gives a great tartness to play with the richness of the cake. I used 2 packages fat-free cream cheese and 1 package regular, and it was tasty but the crust was a little soggy in places.  Might use low-fat instead next time.
 This is the best cheesecake I've ever eaten.  Baked for an hour in a water bath, left it in the oven for an hour with heat off; it was still slightly jiggly at top, but not liquid, and when it cooled it ended up perfectly baked and with no cracks.

Incredible! I made this for my mom's birthday and brought it to the restaurant when we met her for dinner. The waitress didn't believe that I had made it! I used a little over a cup of oreo crumbs but I'd probably up it to two cups next time. Also used 1T sugar, 3/4 stick of butter. Microwaved the white chocolate chips with fat free half and half - a minute at a time, whisked it, and put it back in - did that 2 or 3 times. Mixed everything in my kitchen aid mixer and used microwaved seedless raspberry preserves instead of making the sauce from scratch. I also wrapped the pan in foil, put it in a jelly roll pan with water, baked for 60 minutes and let it cool in the oven. It was truly beautiful. I was nervous b/c this was my first cheesecake but it really wasn't difficult, especially with all the shortcuts! I'll make this again and again.

I am sure this is just as good "as written" - however both times I've made it, I have used a graham cracker crust and jam vs. making the raspberry mixture from scratch.  Truly delicious, excellent recipe.  Do NOT overbake.  Oh and the last time I made it I used seedless black raspberry jam.  To. Die. For.

My guests raved and said it was the best c'cake EVER. I used seedless rasp preserves; next time I'll use >3T in the middle part (3T is perfect for the top). 12 oz bag of white chocolate chips wasn't quite enough, so I had to use part of a second bag, but now I'm not sure I had to make up the few ounces. Wrapped in foil and put in waterbath, and had it bake for an hour, then turned off oven and let it sit for another hour; didn't crack, and was perfectly level. Used Oreos (an entire package, around 2.5 cups) an that's the only way to go! Melting the white choc chips + cream was time consuming on stovetop, so I switched to microwave and even when it was done, I had to whisk it to get it all smooth. That was the toughest part of making this. I forgot the parchment paper and was ok without it, but next time I'll use it--that's as smart as using seedless raspberry preserves. Thanks for this recipe. Beautiful!!!

This was too rich for me. It was a bit too heavy on the white chocolate, and I would have liked to have had more of the chocolate crust and more raspberries or raspberry sauce. My guests enjoyed it, though, so it was probably just me!

Best cheesecake I have ever put in my mouth, hands down! I guess I am rating MOST of this recipe, I cooked it as stated in the recipe and used majority of the ingredients listed in the recipe, but I made two modifications: 1) I added 1/3 c. + 2-3 TBSP sour cream to the cheesecake mixture, and 2) instead of cooking down fresh raspberries, I took a shortcut and used store bought raspberry preserves. Otherwise, did exactly as stated, totally delish.

Loved it! I used "simply fruit" from Smuckers I believe instead of the real raspberry sauce. It simplified it and I don't think the flavor was compromised at all. GREAT recipe - thank you!

This was absolutely wonderful.  I made it for our Father’s Day dessert.  I make lots of desserts for family gatherings, and I don’t think any have exceeded this one in praise.  It is really that good.  I took the advice of doubling the cookie crumbs, baking it in a water bath (wrap the bottom of the pan with foil) and I let the cake cool in the oven with the door ajar – no cracks.  I also laid a piece of parchment in the bottom of the pan before assembling the pan and filling it with the cookie crumbs.  This made it very easy to just slip the finished cake off onto a  serving plate.  One change I will make next time is I will make more sauce . . . I used a 12 oz. bag of raspberries, but really could have used more.  A+++++ for this cheesecake!

my very first cheese cake to ever even try to make. the recipe was easy followed it every step. Read the tips after my cake was in oven so I had a lot of cracks and I don't know how or when to take cake out of pan. Other than that cake was great.

We loved this cheesecake. I don't even like raspberry and I loved it. I doubled the amount of oreos in the crust (2 cups) and kept the butter and sugar the same. I actually made the raspberry sauce with fresh raspberries and then I realized I didn't have a strainer small enough to get the seeds out. So, my sister was going to bring me one from my Mom's house but she took too long and I had to get the cheesecake in the oven, so I used some seedless raspberry jam. It still tasted delicious and I used the fresh raspberry sauce on the individual pieces as I served it. Definitely the best cheesecake I have ever made!

I loved this cheesecake. I do have a quick question ( i made this for the first time today) Why does it need to set for 8 hours when most cheesecakes only need to set for 3-4? I let this one set ofr about 3 hours and the midde was still pretty gooey. I am unsure if i baked it long enough or just didnt let it set long enough. Any response would really help me. I would love to enjoy this cheesecake without this problem.

Fantastic!  I think I just made one of the best cheesecakes I've ever had!  A real hit at my party.  Thanks for sharing!  
On a separate note, I also baked in a water bath.  No crack and wonderful creamy texture.

OMG! This was sooooo good! I baked in a round cake pan with parchment in the bottom because springform pans tend to leak for me. I then refrigerated overnight and then ran a knife around the edge and put a plate on top and turned over to depan. Then back onto another plate. I then took leftover cookie crumbs and patted them around the outside edge of the cake.

I made this for a Christmas party and had a request to make it again for Christmas Eve!  I used the raspberry seedless jam, and heated the chocolate chips in the microwave- both worked great.  I did put out the eggs and cream cheese to warm to room temperature before I started.  I left the cheesecake in the closed oven to cool but it still cracked where the jam was (I used a water bath the first time but it didn't make any difference).  This didn't matter as the jam topping and fresh raspberries coated it just fine!  I will definitely make it again - but only when I have a good 5 hours for it to cool!

Excellent recipe! I followed suggestions and used seedless raspberry jam. The cake took 65 minutes to bake. It was the richest, most filling cheesecake I have ever eaten. Everyone loved it.

Absolutely amazing.   I followed recipe exactly, wouldn't change a thing.  Perfect.  I cooked it in the bath and did the magic trick to cook for one hour, then let cool in warm oven for an hour.  Perfection

Excellent and extremely easy to make. I also recommend using a cookie sheet with a little bit of water to set the springform pan on. I also think it helps to leave the cheesecake in the oven after baking for a few minutes with the door cracked to avoid the center falling or any cracking. We have used Oreo cookies for the bottom but I have found the biggest cheers come from using a graham cracker crust. This is the best (and only) cheesecake recipe my family uses!

Perfect recipe for a party! I have NEVER made a cheesecake before and I was a little nervous about it, but this turned out so perfectly that I recommend it to everyone. I made changes per previous reviews, and I ended up using an 8inch pan. For the crust, I processed whole oreo cookies until medium-coarse granules, and added enough butter (about 2-3 tbsp) until it was moist enough to loosely stick. Did not add any sugar. Packed it along the bottom of the cheesecake tin (but you could also pack it up the sides, if you wanted). 
Prepared the fiilling - I used less (I was using a smaller tin) - 2 8-oz packages of cream cheese, 1/3 cup sugar, 2 eggs, 1 tsp vanilla. Then I heated up the chocolate + half and half in a double boiler (almost looked like condensed milk) and added 2/3 of it to my batter. Poured the batter per the directions (and used store bought raspberry jam that I heated). For baking, I wrapped the bottom well in foil, placed it on a cookie sheet filled with water. I had to bake it for about 1 hr until an inch diameter in the center was left wobbly. (don't open the oven until at near the end of the baking time). Then, I shut off the oven, left the cheesecake sit for another hour. Then I plastic wrapped it, and cooled in the fridge. I removed it about 30 minutes before serving. I served mine with fresh raspberries as garnish. It was awesome! No cracks, rich and smooth consistency, people said it looked professional.

AMAZING --- this was so good, I served it at a party and everyone said how great it was, yum yum :) will make again.
Only note to make was that in my springform pan (only the 2nd time used) butter or something leaked out the bottom and onto the coils making smoke. So I put a cookie sheet on the rack under it, and to avoid a smoky taste I opened the oven door a crack and cooked it longer, still turned out fantastic, and it might have only leaked because I put a little extra butter in the crust, just beware in case. 
Thank you for a great recipe.

Have made this cheesecake 3 times prior to doing this review. Read reviews and made a few changes. Used oreo crust, 1 tablespoon sugar and 5 tablespoons butter, using double stuff cookies is easier to press. Used seedless raspberry preserves  and 4 cups (2 bags) white chocolate chips. Also added preserves in 2 ways. Once pouring preserves at top then swirling, twice adding batter then preserves then remaining batter and then preserves. In my opinion either is fine, but be aware the top of this, at least for me got a little darker than I am used to. So I decorated the top with chocolate syrup and shaved white chocolate. So my advice is perhaps lower temp to 300 and bake for 60-90 minutes depending on oven temp. Just remember though opening oven door will crack cheesecake so watch the center before opening door, it will appear not done, as it jiggles slightly. And for sure let this cake sit a good 8 hours!

I made this for thanksgiving dinner! I couldn't get my raspberry preserves to "swirl" so I did a simple spiral pattern with it instead. after baking and cooling in the fridge overnight I went back over my raspberry spiral to add more and I did whipcream flowers along the edge and placed white chocolate chips along the edge as well. it turned out amazing and tasted sooooo good. was fun and easy to make! only suggestion I would make is to use a lot of preseves or fresh raspberries if you want to be able to taste it. This cheesecake was tasty and creamy. Everyone LOVED it!

I gave this 5 stars based on other people's reactions to it but I would give it 4 stars myself; it was very tasty despite my dislike of white chocolate, which says a lot. I read that some other reviewers didn't think the chocolate flavor was very noticeable but I thought it was quite prominent. This recipe was easy and divides perfectly into two ready made crusts for those of us who are not ambitious enough to make our own (or for those who don't have a springform pan). You just have to adjust your baking time.

Great cheesecake, Cindy! The texture is perfect, and the subtle flavor of the white chocolate does not overpower the cream cheese taste. I doubled the sauce so I could serve a dollop over the cut pieces. Presentation is exquisite! Thanks for sharing.

This cheesecake was fabulous!! The white chocolate gave the cheesecake just a subtle chocolaty flavor, wonderful raspberry sauce!  I did make a double batch of the sauce for the entire top of the cake, also, great tip I found in my cookbook to keep cheesecakes from cracking:  Once removed from the oven, invert a large saucepan over the cake and let cool that way.  This keeps it from cooling off too fast which causes the cracks, it worked for me!

Very tasty-which is saying a lot for me as I "used" to not like cheesecake. I would only mention that if you use a "bain marie" (a water bath for cheesecake), be sure to completly seal the pan from the water. Wrap a 18 inch piece of extra-wide aluminium foil on top of the base of the pan. Don't need to butter alu foil as crust already has butter. Seal pan with the ring and wrap another 18 inch piece of extra-wide alu foil on bottom of base. Make sure you squeeze out any air pockets within the alu foil. You can fold down the extra alu foil-just so that it does not touch the water. Add boiling water to the pan that holds the cheesecake so that it is about 1" high. May need to refill during baking. Let baked cake sit in oven with the closed oven door for 1-2 hrs. Then bring to room temp, then cover and chill.  Cheesecake will not be dry or cracked.

This is definately a keeper!  I made it for company, which I don't usually do with a new recipe, and it was a hit.  I think the cookie crust is such an awesome compliment to the white chocolate and raspberries.  Don't hesitate to try this one.

Absolutely decandent!  I was looking for a recipe exactly like this and I'm so glad I found it here.  I knew it would take some time to prepare it, but it was completely worth the effort.  I have made it twice and received rave reviews both times.  I made a white chocolate sauce to add to it, along with white chocolate shavings, which was also nice.  One of the best cheesecakes I've ever had.  Thank you!

I had no problem getting the seeds out of the sauce, I strained them through a handheld mesh metal strainer.  I've always had a problem with my cheesecake falling in the middle or cracking so I tried the the water bath recommended by one reviewer and it worked like a charm....wrapped the pan with foil and put it in a baking pan filled with water, baked for 1 hour and then turned stove off and left cake in the over for another hour without opening the door.  There were no cracks and it looked gorgeous.

UPDATE:  I have made this at every function I've attended, its my go-to recipe now and people request it.  I use a graham crust instead and still use the water bath (1 hour oven on, 1 hour off) but otherwise follow the recipe exactly as written.  Using white chocolate chips is WAY better than bakers chocolate.  People have compared it to NY factory cheesecake.  When I'm lazy I don't bother swirling the raspberry into the cake and just pour it all on top when it's cool, it doesn't make a difference overall.

To quote my husband " The BEST Cheesecake I have ever eaten!"  My guests " 'mmmmm" with the eye roll!
 I just wish recipe included the tips for a perfect cheesecake without cracks.  
Found these tips here on Allrecipes.
1. Lightly grease inside springform pan. ( I did not and was fine.)
2. Cream cheese at room temp.  Beat alone until light.  Add sugar beat until fluffy. Add remaining ingredients per recipe.
3. Bake with a water bath.  There many variations so I would check them and start trying next time.
4.  Don't over bake!  Center will be jiggly.  I cooked 55 minutes. Checked and put in 3minutes more because I was uncertain.  The edges got just a little brown.
5. Remove from oven. Place on wire rack and cover with a bowl to allow to cool more gradually.

I will try tips next time.  The recipe is worth repeating!! Good luck!

This is an amazing cheesecake :D After reading the reviews & the Cheesecake Tips article on this site I made a few minor changes. I used 2C of graham crumbs (couldn't find chocolate) with 2/3C melted butter & 1/3C sugar. I packed it into the bottom of a 10' springform pan & wrapped the bottom of the pan in tinfoil to make sure the crust wouldn't get soggy sitting in the waterbath. Looking at pics I was a little concerned that the raspberry topping would be too runny & sink into the cake so I made my sauce with 1+1/4C blueberries, 3Tblsp sugar, 3Tblsp Cornstarch, 1/3C water & 2Tblsp lemon Juice. I crushed the berries with a potato masher in the pot & boiled it for 10mins then drained it through a metal sifter. The white chocolate flavour seemed pretty mild based on the reviews so I increased it to 3C white chocolate melting wafers which I microwaved with the cream. I didn't want the fruit to sink too far into the cake so I poured all the batter over the crust & spooned small amounts of the blueberry topping on top and swirled it with a butter knife, adding more sauce as I went along. I put it in a waterbath and baked it for 50mins (my oven runs hot) then I turned off the oven and let it sit in there w/the door cracked for about 35 minutes then I covered it w/saran wrap, put it in the fridge & went to bed. The next day when I served it it was absolutely beautiful :) It tasted very rich so next time I might make it with 2 or 2+1/2C white chocolate. Will definetly make again :)

It's still in the oven!  It won't set up!  I am going to try leaving in in oven with heat turned off for another hour.  it will surely be pudding if I take it out now and it's been baking almost two hours.  Looks pretty but i will use my favorite plain cheesecake recipe next time that I know works and add the raspberry sauce to it.  Maybe a chocolate crust too.  This was to be our only dessert for Easter Dinner tomorrow!  Now what can I do?  I'm too tired to make another and that would involve another trip to the store!!  I hate trying recipes that don't work!  I thought this would be wonderful because it had five stars!  NOT!

This is the first cheesecake I've ever made and it tasted delicious!  I think any problems that I encountered simply came from lack of experience.  I greased my pan and added parchment paper but my cookie crumb crust stuck to the paper.  I used two cups of crushed oreos as suggested.  I had a crack in the surface of mine but that wasn't too terrible.  I used some tips on here and wrapped the bottom of my springform pan in foil and placed it in a pan with some water while it cooked, and then opened the door after it was done and let it sit in the oven. I enjoyed making the rasperry sauce as directed on the stovetop and did not think it was too time consuming.  I did however microwave the cream and white chocolate because I was a little intimidated by the method described.  Overall, I'll make it again, it was delicious and I don't really like white chocolate OR cheesecake!

My family loved this -- even me, who doesn't generally like cheesecake.  I followed the allrecipes article on how to bake cheesecake; it was very helpful and I didn't have any cracking. I wrapped the spring-form pan with two layers of foil and placed it in a baking pan with water for baking.  I also followed one reviewer's advice and turned off the oven and opened the oven door a crack after the suggested baking time, allowing the cheesecake to set up further. After that I allowed it to cool on the counter for a few hours. Awesome!!

I had never made a cheesecake before but I gave a shot at it and I was delighted!!!!!!! This is an absolutly amazing recipie! I used graham cracker crumbs because I didn't want a chocolate crust. Also doubled the crumbs. I baked it at 315 for an hour and shut the oven off and let it sit for a few hours then on the counter for an hour and then the fridge overnight. Not one crack and it didn't sink down at all!! My swirls didn't work as well as I hoped but that was my fault because I accidently got the sauce too thick. Followed people's tips to strain berries before putting in cornstarch and worked great. Garnished with whipped cream a berry drizzzled sauce and white chocolate! Everyone absolutly loved it! My husband was talking about the next time I make it whils he was still eating his piece! :) I definitly have a new favorite!

This is pretty good but I will double the amount of crust next time. I also had trouble with the rasberry sauce sinking to the bottom.

I've enjoyed this recipe for years, and it always gets great reviews.  I really love the results of this original version, but when I find myself low on time, I substitute making the crust for the chocolate or oreo crust you can buy at the store - but the remainder of the recipe will make at least 2 of those, so I always buy two.  Also, for a time saver, rasberry preserves that can be bought at the store or at some place like Cracker Barrell save on time for making the rasberry sauce and tastes quite delicious.  Other than those changes which I alter only during those short on time moments, I always try to prevent cracking by placing the springform pan or pie dishes in a water bath during the cooking process.

I have made this 2 times in the past 2 weeks.  I make it gluten free by using gluten free chocolate cookies for the cookie crumb crust.  Everyone absolutely loves this cheesecake!  I didn't really change anything else in the recipe except the cookies.  Also, used 2 cups cookie crumbs, 6 Tbls white sugar and 1/2 cup butter for the crust so that I could have crust up the sides of the pan.  I garnished the cheesecake with fresh raspberries and shaved white chocolate.

Wonderful recipe! I just pulled it out of my oven for the THIRD time in about two weeks! It has turned out perfect every time. I definitely suggest the water bath. I used raspberrys and got rid of the seeds before I thickened them with the cornstarch. I used a flour sifter to strain them and it was super easy. I also used chocolate Gram Crackers instead of cookie crumbs and it was yummy. Tonight I'm trying it with a thin white chocolate ganache type glaze to go underneath the raspberry sauce topping. I think it will be good but I'll let you know. I'll definitely make this again and again!

This is a fantastic recipe. Slight modification: I used seedless raspberry jelly and it turned out fantastic. It was actually so good my guests did not believe that I made it. Also whole fresh raspberries on top is a must.

i've made this twice, do not get diet anything, it'll ruin it. placing a cookie sheet with water and wrapping the springform pan with aluminum foil will prevent the cheesecake from drying out.

really great recipe. but best if you don't add eggs and don't bake, just chuck it in the fridge and it tastes way better. Photo 331 is the best photo there by the way (because it's mine) and it wasn't baked.

I've made this twice now, and I must say this is the best thing that has ever graced my tastebuds.  I had some black raspberries from my backyard that I used in this.  There was no cheesecloth on hand, so it was a bit seedy, but tasty nonetheless.  My second try turned out better because I followed the cheesecake tips on this site.  Less cracking and the edge was nice and soft.

10 Stars!!!! We loved this Cheesecake! The crust was a little too moist so I might adjust the butter next time. I used generic oreos and scraped the cream out of them and crushed in a food proccesor. I aslo used extra white chocolate chips because others said they couldnt taste the white chocolate. This is so good! probably the best cheesecake Ive ever had..Thank you for the great recipe...:)

I used oreos for the crust. Not a great idea...maybe golden oreos would have worked. I spread mine to thin so I had equal crust to filling. Not great. Need to have a least 2 to 1 filling to crust.

I was so afraid of OVERcooking this (based on other reviews) that I UNDERcooked it. I took it out when it jiggled in the center and it even cracked but was still not completely set in the center. I crushed generic Oreo cookies for the crust and was surprised at how well that turned out as I didn't know what the cream in the center would do but you can't even tell the difference.

This was great except for the long wait in the fridge till we could try it!  Little more dense than the cheesecake I normally make, next time might add 2C sour cream before adding choc mixture.  I also used raspberry preserves with seeds with no problems!  On my make often list!

Made this today and got rave reviews all round. We had guests who also gave it an A1..lovely recipe, definitely a keeper, the next time i'd prolly use 1.5 cups cookie crumbs as 1 cup was a tad bit thin...Thank you very much!

This recipe was awesome! I have never made a cheesecake before, and I followed the recipe closely, with the exception of using Oreo's as the crust. 

I got nothing but amazing compliments from the cake and will definitely be making this one again!

As it was my first cheesecake attempt, I am *quite* proud of myself, although next time i will be using parchment paper on the bottom of my pan (I hate serving off the pan!)

great recipe! i followed the advice to use heated raspberry jam instead of real raspberries and heated the chocolate in the microwave instead of on the stove.  plus after the 55 min of baking i turned off the oven and left the cake in for an additional 4-5 hours plus sitting on the counter for another couple hours before putting it in the fridge.  not exactly sure how or if all that helped anything but i've heard cheesecake can be very tempermental and this was my first one so i wanted to be extra careful.  my boyfriend and i both loved the finished product and will be making a couple of these for every holiday. can't wait to see everyone's faces when they realize how good a cook i am!! 5 stars+++++++++++

Absolutely AMAZING!
It is a little time consuming (melting the chocolate and straining the seeds) but well worth it. I brought this to an Easter Brunch and everyone thought I bought it from a bakery. I got rave reviews. People were waiting in line to get a slice. 
If you want to take a short cut, use Polaner All Fruit - Seedless Raspberry Spreadable Fruit instead of cooking down and straing the raspberries. It is all natural and made with Raspberries and fruit juice so the work is done for you. I used 2 cups crushed Oreos w/ 1 T sugar and the butter as suggested by others. All else was as called for in the recipe. I will definitely make this again.

I love this recipe.  I had never made a cheesecake before but I followed the cheesecake tips from this site before I started and the first one came out well.  I had to bake mine longer than the recipe suggested but I used a water bath.  My second attempt went even better because I used a few shortcuts and placed pan and all in the freezer for a couple of hours after it cooled in the oven.  This is now my go-to recipe for dessert.

Family really enjoyed this cake.  It was good but I found that I've enjoyed other recipes more.  As far as cakes go, it's pretty good, it gets 4 stars for how great it looks.

i think the real raspberries are superior to jam and not too much trouble to make the sauce. i would next time dump the whole sauce in the middle. some of it escapes to the top anyway when you add the rest of the batter. the cooking style of "1 hr. in oven with heat.....1 hr. without" is perfect...even though cake shook a bit too much after first hours. divine!!!

Absolutely amazing!  I did take others recommendation and substituted seedless raspberry jam for the raspberry sauce and it worked perfectly.  i baked it in a waterbath at night and then i turned off the oven and let it cool overnight and i had no problem with cracks or falling.  i made mini cheesecakes later the same week and took them to my husband's office and they raved over them.

I cooked this cake for my boyfriend's birthday and it was heaven!!! I followed the recipe is as, and baked the cheese cake in a waterbath (set it on a tray filled with water) to avoid cracking. Definitely recommend.

If I could give this recipe a hundred stars- I would! I made it as written- no substutions (although I added a few more cookie crumbs). The raspberry sauce was extremely easy to make- heat the raspberries and water (without cornstarch and sugar) until the berries break down. Pour into a mesh strainer and mix the seeds around to drain all the liquid. Back into the pot goes the liquid- add cornstarch and sugar- boil for 5 minutes. This makes it super easy to remove the seeds. I also used a water bath when cooking and I left cake in the oven for an hour after turning the oven off. ( I ran a knife around the edge when it was done cooking in the hopes of preventing cracks- I don't know if it helped but I didn't have a single crack!) I cooled it for about an hour on counter then into the fridge overnight. Magnificent. Better than any store or restaurant cheesecake declared all!!! This was my first attempt at cheesecake- certainly not my last. The texture and consistency were perfect.  The extra sauce was set out to let everyone add or not. The tartness of the sauce complimented the richness of the cake. I like the easy idea of raspberry jam- I just think it may be to sweet. This sauce was really easy.

Very tasty cheesecake with a super creamy texture.  Everyone loved it!  I did double the recipe for the raspberry sauce, however, with half going into the cake and half poured over each slice afterwards.  For the crust I crushed oreos in a freezer bag with a rolling pin and only added 1 tbsp of sugar and 2 tbsps of butter.  Great recipe!

nothing to say besides absolutely WONDERFUL! it was easy and fun to make! the raspberry sauce is so tart and yummy and creates the perfect compliment to the smooth sweet white chocolate. make extra sauce to drizzle on top! for the crust i used teddy grahams. perhaps next time i will try chocolate graham crackers or make my own chocolate cookies and use that for the crust! also, i whip the cream cheese mixture for about 5 minutes on high, making it super creamy and fluffy. happy cooking! xx

Soooo good! This was my first attempt ever at making a cheesecake and it came out perfect! Def impressed my boyfriends parents with this one. I used a water bath to prevent cracking and topped with a little chocolate syrup and the leftover sauce really set it off.

I used 2 cups of crushed Oreo cookies, 1 T of white sugar, and 1/4 cup of melted butter for the crust.  I microwaved the white chocolate chips and half-and-half for 30 sec at a time stirring in between until the chocolate melted.  I also microwaved 6 T of raspberry jam combined with water for 30 sec at a time stirring in between until the sauce was thick.  Then I strained the sauce to get rid of the seeds.  It would've been better if I had bought seedless raspberry jam but my grocery store didn't carry it.  I swirled all of the raspberry sauce on top of the cheesecake and baked it for 1 hour in a water bath.  Then I turned off the oven and let the cheesecake sit in the oven for 1 hour.  The cheesecake didn't have a single crack and the top was perfectly level.  I chilled the cheesecake (still in the springform pan) overnight in the refrigerator.  The next day, the cheesecake was wonderfully creamy and delicious.  This is a simple recipe for a lovely cheesecake that looks professionally made.

I would give this a hundred stars if I could. I made this for Thanksgiving and I had never made a cheesecake before, but this was absolutely perfect. It was better than any restaurant or store cheesecake I have ever eaten. The presentation was gorgeous and the taste...ooohhh the taste. Everyone was really impressed, but I think I was the most impressed. I felt like a culinary genius, lol. Followed the recipe to the letter. Amazing is not a strong enough word.  Editing to say I did use a water bath and left it in the oven for an hour after the bake time was up. No cracking, no runniness, just perfect firm creamy cheesecake. The previous reviewer who had so many problems must have done something really wrong b/c this was time consuming but quite simple for anyone with any sort of cooking experience.

A bit of work, but completely worth the effort. This is a delicious recipe, and even though we had a large dinner beforehand almost every single person went back for seconds. I always bake my cheesecakes in a water bath to prevent cracking and keep them moist. Simply wrap the bottom of the spring form pan in foil. Get the cheesecake ready in the springform pan. Place the springform pan on a jelly roll sheet or baking dish with sides. Place them in the oven and pour about an inch of water in the jelly roll pan or baking dish. Refill water if necessary while baking.

Was surprisingly dissapointed after having read such great reviews. Followed exact directions.  Texture was just wrong and tasted underbaked, also it really sunk in the middle. Too bad...was really excited to try this.

This was soooooooo good! I made a graham cracker crust just because I prefer it. I used raspberry jam with seeds and it was fine. For the glaze on top I mixed the juice from a bag of thawed frozen raspberry with more jam, I will do this for the middle next time as well as I liked a bit of tartness more than just the sweet jam alone. I baked it for 50 minutes in a waterbath with foil & left it in the oven to cool a few hours, no cracks. I'm going to make this again soon!

Yum yum yummity yum! I am in LOVE with this cheesecake. Delish. everyone luved it!!! I used what I had on hand and so didn't make chocolate crust just plain ole graham cracker(with a dash of cinnamon-no real reason for this, just did) I used heavy whipping cream and only had 3- 4oz white chocolate bars. I cracked these up and threw them in a bowl with the cream and microwaved for 20seconds then 20 more, worked great. I had raspberry preserves and used that in this recipe. I shoulda used a bunch more but I was worried because it wasn't seedless. I nuked a bout 1/4c. Again, next time-and there will be a next time- I will use more. Only tiny complaint is that I may have added a bit more than 1/2c sugar, maybe. And if that is what I may have done then next time I will NOT do that and add a bit less than 1/2c(was just a tad bit onda sweeeet side- where it may cross the line and appear to be too sweet, and we don't want that) Sooooo. Make this cheesecake and everyone will enjoy it and it will be better than a "plain" cheesecake and prettier too.

The cake was amazing, but it really didn't need the sauce and everyone who tried it liked it better without the sauce. I'm not sure how to make the sauce better, but I think next time I may just skip it.

I made this  for my son's birthday and it was a huge hit.  I followed the feedback suggestion to bake in a water bath and let stand in oven after baking.  No cracks...  Definitely plan to make this at least 24 hours ahead of time.

This is the best cheesecake ever!!!  I use a 12 oz package of frozen raspberries and 3/4 cup water.  I heat the berries in the water until they are pretty well broken down then drain the juice through a sieve several times before adding 1/4 cup sugar and 1 T cornstarch.  Then I continue cooking until thickened.  This makes getting all the seeds out so much easier and you end up with about two cups of wonderful raspberry syrup.  Try this cheesecake, you will love it, too.

AMAZING!! This was the first cheesecake I ever made and I plan on making it again and again. Plus it was also relatively easy to make. Instead of using fresh raspberries, I just used seedless jam, about 6 tablespoons (someone else said this, but I can't find there comment so I thought I'd mention it again because it saved me a lot of time).

WOW!  What an amazing recipe! I don't like white chocolate and I typically pick other desserts over cheesecake but this is truly incredible! I read many of the reviews as well as the techniques on making cheesecake from allrecipes.com. I put enough oreos in a food processor to make about 2 cups of crumbs, used 1 TBS sugar and 1/4 C butter for the crust. I wish I had strained the berries before adding the cornstarch b/c I feel that I wasted some of the precious sauce. I brought all the ingredients to room temp before starting. I wrapped foil around the bottom of my pan & placed it on a cookie sheet with about 1/2 inch of water. I baked the cheesecake for an hour then turned the oven off and cracked the door open and left it in there until the pan felt close to room temperature - no cracks and it ended up pretty even across the top. I think it took me closer to 2 hrs to prepare but I am pretty slow in the kitchen as I check the recipe over and over to avoid missing steps. I will definitely make this again! And try with strawberry or blueberry sauce.

This cheesecake was amazing! Award winning you might say. I made this cheesecake for a Relay for Life fundraiser and won for the best chocolate dessert. This was after I had to convince numerous people it was not store bought. The suggestions I used- Baked the crust alone for 8 min and then let the pan and crust cool completely, water bath (don't forget to seal the bottom of the pan with foil), after 50-55min I turned the stove off, cracked the door, and left it in there to cool over night since it was already late. When you turn the stove off the cake should still wiggle a little. The next morning, it didn't have a single crack in it. Since it was near Valentine's day, I used a teaspoon to drizzle heart shapes out of the raspberries. I used a pointed object to further shape my hearts. This was beautiful and delicious!!

Very good cheesecake! The only thing that I will change next time is to add more sugar to the raspberry sauce, it was very tart. Other than that, I highly recommend this recipe!

This was my first real cheesecake... It was absolutely incredible, it looked gorgeous with all of the rasberry swirls on the top.  I did make double the amount of the raspberry sauce so I could drizzle it over it on the plates.  Our guests told me it was the best cheesecake they had ever tasted!!!

Absolutely perfect. I followed others advice and used 2 cups oreo crumbs and 1/4 cup melted butter for the crust. I also used Raspberry Jam instead.Melted 3 cups of chips in the microwave along with the half and half. Covered bottom of springform pan with aluminum foil, put the pan on a cookie sheet adn filled the bottom of the cookie sheet with water. Baked for one hour, then opened the oven and let the cheesecake sit for another hour before removing from oven. Creamy, no cracks, beautiful. I took the cheesecake to my in laws for christmas dinner and my mother in law told me I should sell them!! Thank you for the awesome recipe.

AllRecipes needs to allow a 6th star for a recipe that is this good!  Prepared it for a couples' Valentine's party and the sounds of the diners made it sound like an orgy!  Used the Oreo crust option with less melted butter, and it was simply perfectomundo.  Got a tad annoyed trying to strain the seeds from the cooked berry mixture, but it was sooo worth the effort.  Next time I will double amound for berries as there was less than a teaspoonful left over for pouring on as a sauce. What a keeper!

This cheesecake was phenomenal, but I do have to disagree with reviewers who stated this recipe was easy to make.  The process of making the cake layer by layer definitely requires assistance the first couple of times the dessert is made, especially if you do not own an electric hand mixer!  However, the process was well worth it.  The cake is creamy and delicious.  Each flavor - cream cheese, white chocolate, raspberry, oreo - was distinct without overpowering.  The result was divine.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I do recommend baking the cheesecake slightly differently.  I covered my springform pan with aluminum foil and placed this in a cookie sheet filled with water.  After baking for exactly an hour, I turned off the oven and let the cake sit in the cooling oven for another hour.  Refrigerate as long as possible!  The crust tends to stick to the pan if it is allowed to thaw out.

AMAZING!!! Oh my gosh, this is the best cheesecake I've ever made. I love the one at Olive Garden and this tastes just like it. I followed the recipe exactly with the one exception of having to use chocolate graham crackers because I did not have cookies on hand. I took the time to make the raspberry sauce and I think this is a must! The fresh/frozen raspberries really make this cake as opposed to using a jam. Amazing and creamy, my whole family could not stop eating it. This will now be my signature dessert. I wish I had more but I let my BIL keep the leftovers since it was for his BD!!! I used a water bath and wrapped the pan in foil 4 times to be safe. I also cooked for the 1 hour, it jiggled in the middle and then I turned the oven off and left in for another hour. Perfect! It was gorgeous too. I highly recommend this cheesecake, it's worth the extra time and effort!

I had never made a cheesecake before I attempted to make this one! I'm so glad I chose it! It was DELICIOUS! Very creamy, very tasty and the Oreo crust was wonderful!
I had 2 girlfriends over for dinner and they loved it too!
I do think I overcooked it - mostly because I'm still getting to know my new oven but also because I didn't know what to look for, having never made cheesecake before... But even so, it was still really, really nice!
I have to say, not even in a restaurant I think I've ever had such a lovely tasting cheesecake as this!
I'd recommend you read this site's tips on how to make cheesecake, if this is your first time trying though. It helped me a lot!
Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful! Can't wait to have an excuse to make it again - even my husband liked it and he normally hates cheesecakes!
Well done!

I love this cheesecake recipe. I had to double the crust ingredients because it barely covered my 9" springform pan. The first time, I took the advice of someone else and use seedless raspberry jam instead of frozen raspberries, it tasted good, but the next time when I made this, the frozen raspberries tasted better.

By the way, definitely wrap your springform pan with foil, because it does leak. I placed the cheesecake in a water bath so it cooks evenly. I let it sit in the oven for an hour after it baked so it wouldn't sink in the middle. It came out uncracked and wonderful every time.

This recipe is very time consuming, but oh sooooo worth it!!  I used oreo cookies (doubled the amount to about 1 3/4 c.) and omited the sugar.  The crust was very tasty.  I did added a bit more white chocolate to the chocolate/half & half mixture (about 1/3 c. more) I also double the amount of the raspberry sauce.  I know the sauce is a bit time consuming, but I think it really needs the tartness instead of sweet jam.  Just my opinion.  I added a bit more sauce to the cake and baked it(with a pan of water directly underneath on lower shelf) with help from this sites suggestions.  I also turned the oven off after 55 minutes, and let the cheesecake sit in the oven for about 2-3 hours with the door slightly open.  Then I placed it in the refrigerator overnight.  I added more raspberry sauce on top with shaved white chocolate and a bit of whipping cream "dabs" around the ends.  It turned out FANTASTIC!  This is definitely a keeper!

Not that this recipe really needs another 5 star rating - but I'd toss a 10 star on it if I could. These cheesecake was phenomenal! I took this to a dinner party and my friends have decided that I am the 'dessert-bringer' for all of our future gatherings. lol This was by far the TASTIEST and EASIEST cheesecake recipe! It came out perfect on the first try.

I will add this though, for the next time I make it: use raspberry preserves rather than make my own sauce. I evidently don't have a strainer with narrow enough holes to properly strain the raspberry seeds. I personally don't care for raspberry seeds, but everyone else loved the raspberry sauce and told me to get over the seeds. lol (ok, so I'm critical of my work :P)

This cheesecake was a-m-a-z-i-n-g!  The only thing that I changed in the recipe was that I purchased a chocolate graham cracker crust (couldn't find the Oreo ones), smashed it up, and added the butter and sugar.  It worked great.  I baked it using a waterbath and I cut it using dental floss, and it looked as great as it tasted.  Thanks so much for sharing!

This was so awesome! I made it for Christmas and we loved it. I agree with previous posts that working with the raspberry seeds was difficult. Next time I will used a raspberry spread or some other replacement. I also placed aluminum foil at the bottom of the pan, and placed the spring form pan on a cookie sheet (with water in it) when I put the cheesecake in the oven.

Excellent recipe!  I have made this cheesecake twice this holiday season, and it was deliciously wonderful both times.  EVERYone "Mmmmm" 's with each bite.  For my crust I used one-and-a-half cups of graham cracker crumbs, 2T cocoa, and just a little sugar.  I used a little more melted butter than the recipe calls for.  I like a thicker crust that I can build up at the bottom edge.  Looks prettier when sliced.  Otherwise, I used the other helpful suggestions posted here and I was very pleased!

I have to admit, I was VERY nervous about this.  I had never made a cheesecake before, and have heard many horror stories.  I read all of the "most helpful" reviews, and my cheesecake came out perfect!

-I definitely recommend wrapping the bottom of the pan in foil and cooking it on a jelly roll pan.  Place it in the oven and pour hot water into the jelly roll pan.  After cooking 1 hour, turn oven off and leave it in there for 1 more hour.  My cheesecake didn't sink or split.  It was beautiful!

This is simply amazing, a wonderfully easy and delicious recipe. I'm not a fan of white chocolate and was worried that the cheesecake would turn out too sweet. However, the sweetness was just right. I also used 6tbsp of raspberry jam (suggested by another reviewer) and microwaved it briefly with 1tbsp of water to make it more fluid. Also, I used ginger snaps as the cake base instead of cookie crumbs. This has been the only cake recipe that I regretted not making more of in my first attempt!

This cheesecake recipe was fantastic.  I will definitely be making this again.  Next time I think i'll try to puree the raspberries before cooking them, then put the strainer over the saucepan and add the water.  I think you'll get more of the raspberry to drain.  With so many seeds it was difficult to get all the fruit through.  I also had to add more sugar to the raspberry sauce as was VERY tart.  Close to 4 T.  Cheesecake oozed a little in the oven so next time I'll use a cookie sheet.  Small crack in the center.  Baked it for 55 minutes and may have been slightly overdone; will probably take it out just a few minutes earlier next time.   Definitely a keeper!

This cheesecake is fabulous.  I'm begged to make it every Christmas.  Last Christmas I tried the variation of mixed berries but it didn't contrast enough in taste like the raspberries do so stick to the recipe is my advice.  Enjoy!!!!!

i needed something fancy for dessert and choose this. it took me close to 4 hours to make and bake it. i guess i just took my time. as suggested, i used a water bath. LET ME TELL YOU....!!!! this was the BEST cheesecake i have ever eaten. the entire room was silent as everyone ate. it was a litle time consuming to strain the berries, i might use a preserve next time.and it took 20 mins extra to cook. i can not stress enough how extraordinary this cheesecake is.

I have made this recipe twice, once in a 9-inch springform, and then again in two 4.5 inch springform pans.  Both times the cheesecake came out wonderfully rich, creamy, and delicious.  I used heavy cream instead of half and half, and increased the white chocolate to 2.5 cups.  To scale the recipe down to mini springform pans, I divided all quantities by 3.

Me and a group of guys made this for a cooking competition and I think the ladies all fell in love with us.  Heck, I think the other team fell in love!  This recipe is AMAZING!  We only changed a few things.  We added sugar to the sauce.  We also made the crust out of Graham Crackers and Nilla wafers.  I think that mix took it over the top.  Like many other raters, I would not suggest chocolate.  Cindy, Thank you, thank you, thank you!

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!!!!  I experimented like 20 times with this recipe. (Husband is mad cause I spent so much money on cream cheese and raspberries to get this recipe perfect!)  Don't bother straining the raspberry sauce, it's a waste of time, makes a mess, and I personally think the sauce looks better with the little raspberry seeds in it anyways!  When I make this cheesecake, I spread 1/2 the cheesecake batter into the crust, then spread the raspberry sauce over top, then CAREFULLY spread the rest of the cheesecake batter over top.  I let the cake cool, remove the sides, and refrigerate overnight.  I top the cheesecake with a dark chocolate ganache and some white chocolate swirls, and let it completely harden before serving.  The cake slices beautifully, with an elegant ribbon of raspberry right through the middle.  My thighs and waistline are seeking revenge because of this recipe!

Made this for Christmas Day, and it was wonderful!  The recipe is a little more time-consuming than the easier cheesecakes I usually make.  The work is worth it though!  I believe this is the best cheesecake I have ever made.  I didn't have half-and-half, so I just used 1% milk (what I had on hand).  Love the white chocolate taste, and mixed with raspberries it becomes superb!  I would put a little more than 3 TBS raspberry sauce in the center next time.  Swirling the top of the cheesecake was fun too.  I really think the chocolate wafer crust adds to it too.  I don't think it would be as good with a graham cracker crust. *** Made again w/frozen strawberries.  Used 2 bags (12 oz. I think), thawed and pureed them, then made the sauce.  Delicious also!  Maybe I'll try blueberries next.

I noticed that a number of people had difficulty with the raspberries.  Instead of heating the raspberries, all you need to do is put them in a blender for a second and them strain them.  You can then add the sugar if you would like.  This method requires fresh, not frozen raspberries but does prevent creating a sauce that tastes like jam.  I hope that is helpful.

This was the 1st cheesecake I ever made at my 23 years of age, and it turned out very good! I substituted blueberries for raspberries and it turned out a bit too sweet because blueberries are not at all tart like frozen raspberries. I will definitely use less sugar the next time. Also, I found the cake was quite salty. In the future, I will buy a brand of creamcheese that is more neutral in taste to make this recipe (not Philadelphia) or just use a bit more sour cream instead. Still, everyone loved the cake, it was very rich and looked absolutely fantastic. There was minor cracking at the top but it didn't bother me at all. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I thought this cheesecake was delicious and will be making it again. The reason for the 4 star rating is that I really couldn't taste the white chocolate. I used Ghiradelli white chocolate chips..maybe I will use the bar the next time. The chips took too long to melt.

That said, I made it as a trial run and I loved it. I doubled the sauce recipe which is awesome. I thought this was very easy to do and will be making it again.
Mine did crack and I used my convection bake on my oven. I will try a suggestion from my neighbor which is to run a knife around the edge once it is done cooking. I did let it cool in the oven and then refrigerated when it was cool enough to the touch.
All in all, a fantastic recipe that people raved about. Great texture..not dry at all. Will be making again. Thanks for the recipe.

This cheesecake is UNBELIEVABLY good!  
I'm no cheesecake baker - all of mine always crack and/or end up too mushy and/or ugly...
But not this beauty!  I brought it to a party where there were three other cakes to choose from, and this one definitely received the most attention!  
I baked it using the water bath, which turned out great.  Also, I recommend making an additional TWO batches of the raspberry sauce - it's terrific and with the original recipe I was left with about 2 extra tablespoons. (Not nearly enough!)
Also, the chocolate crust, which I was hesitant about (in my head, a graham crust would have been more appropriate), tasted super with the white chocolate and raspberry swirl.
I happily rank this recipe with five stars!  I will definitely be using this recipe again!

Followed this as written for the filling but I did make the bottom crust a little thicker as I wanted more chocolate flavor. I also use a water bath to keep the top from cracking but did not change any ingredients and it turned out FANSTASTIC! So full of flavor, creamy but solid, and not too sweet as some reviewers said. This is better than Cheese Cake Factory any day. I will be making this many times through out the year.
UPDATE: I kept the filling recipe the same but for the crust I am now using chocolate graham crackers instead of cookies. I also added less sugar as there is sugar on the crackers.  Still tastes wonderful!

I made this cake for the first time for a friends engagement party, and although I was very nervous, it was the talk of the night!! People were coming up to me left, right and centre asking me if I made it! I was so happy. I've made Chantal's New York Cheesecake a couple of times, but it doesn't even compare to this one! I will only be making this one from now on. It tasted better than at a restaurant. Here's what I did after reading a number of reviews: I used 2 cups of crushed Oreos, 1/4 C of melted butter, and 1tbsp of sugar. Brilliant. Secondly, I used Smuckers Seedless Raspberry Jam instead of making my own sauce and probably saved myself 30 minutes of time, and it tasted amazing. I heated it in the microwave just enough so that I could drizzle it. Do NOT drop the sauce in lumps. A slight drizzle all over will do, same goes for the top layer. Then proceed to run a knife through. Baked for 60 minutes at 325 with a water bath. After the 60 minutes, I turned the oven off and left the cake in there for about 5 hours, then straight to the fridge for 24. Other than that, I did not change a thing about this recipe. It is absolutely incredible.

I have made this cheesecake several times now and people request it very often. I actually ended up using a flour sifter to remove the seeds from the raspberry sauce and it worked so much better and faster than anything else. 
This is one of the best cheesecakes I've ever had.

Oh my goodness!!  This recipe is truly worthy of all the wonderful reviews.  I made this for a dinner party last evening and everyone loved it!!!  It was the most beautiful cheesecake I have ever made and SO SO SO delicious!  So here are my helpful tips:  First of all I made it exactly like the recipe calls for.  No changes.  I used the Nabisco Chocolate Wafers that are found beside the graham cracker crumbs in my grocery store.  I don't have a food processor, so just put them in a ziplock bag and crused with rolling pin.  The taste of these wafers is like an oreo without the cream.  PERFECT for the crust.  Had never used these before.  They are great!  After reading lots of the reviews, I decided to try a water bath for the first time. It worked beautifully and the cheesecake looked like something from a restaurant.  Seriously.  So just wrap your spring form pan with foil about half way up the sides to ensure no water gets in.  When ready to bake your cheesecake, set your cake in a jellyroll pan and once you slide this into your oven, then carefully pour HOT water into the pan so that it comes up about an inch or so up the side of your springform pan.  That's all there is to it.  I baked mine for exactly 55 minutes and then turn oven OFF.  Leaving oven door CLOSED, let the cheesecake sit in oven for one additional hour.  TRUST ME....it worked beautifully.  Remove from oven, remove foil, cool and refrigerate. WONDERFUL!!

This will be the third year and the fourth or fifth time I've made this cheesecake for the holidays. We absolutely L.O.V.E it! I have successfully made the following changes and (I think) improved a bit on the original recipe and instructions: 
1. Increase the crust ingredients by half. I like just a little thicker crust on the bottom of my cheesecake.
2. Use chocolate graham crackers instead of cookie crumbs; the cheesecake itself is plenty sweet enough without adding an overly sweet cookie crumb crust such as the type you'd get from Oreos. 
3. Double the amount of raspberry sauce so you have even more raspberry goodness to stir in and spoon over. In making the sauce, I find it works best to first puree the berries with the water and sugar, then strain, then cook with cornstarch. Seems to be less mess and less waste this way, but of course you end up with the same sauce either way. 
4. Last year I learned to use a water bath, and let me tell you, it is THE way to go for an over-the-top cheesecake. There are several places online where you can find directions to do it. The way I look at it, with all the work you'll put into this particular cheesecake, wouldn't you like it to be as perfect as it can be? Try the water bath. You won't be disappointed. (Just make sure your cheesecake pan is waterproof -- wrap it with foil like I did if you're paranoid!)

Super easy to make and delicious too! I bought the pre-made oreo pie crust and the seedless strawberry jam (I cant find the raspberry one). So in short, I only made the actual cheesecake. This yields two of those store bought oreo pie crusts. I also baked them in a 'water bath'. The marbling effect didnt do so well and left cracks on where my strawberry swirls should be. I know better how to do it next time though. This is my first time baking cheesecake and love it!

I don't like cheesecake but I LOVED this! It's amazing. My whole family loved it and keep asking me to make another one! I followed the recipe exactly. Only thing I would change is double the ingredients for the raspberry sauce just to have extra on the side :)

Amazing! Restaurant quality. Recommend a water bath. I baked it in a fan assisted oven as that is all I have for 55 minutes at 163C and then turned the oven off and left it for an hour still in the water bath. Removed it to cool and placed a bowl over it while it did so. Not a crack in sight and it was very moist. Thanks for sharing!

This..was..delicious!  I got rave reviews for this recipe.  I used chocolate animal crackers for the crust, but otherwise made it exactly as written.  One of the best cheesecakes I've made so far, thank you!

Yeah!  My first try at cheesecake was a success.  This was easy to make and very, very smooth and delicious.  I used the raspberry jam like others and it worked perfectly.  Couldn't find my spring form pan, so just used a 9" round cake pan...little concerned about getting it out of there, but it came right out.  My son said it was like a "Cheesecake Factory" cheesecake!  Thanks for this recipe.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars.  It deserves it.  This cheesecake is very rich and decadent!  I followed the recipe as is except for baking technics and a berry switch.  I replaced the raspberry with blueberries.  I did this for 2 reasons.  I like blueberries better and no seeds so no straining.  As for baking technic, I used a 9" round cake pan and lined the bottom with wax paper for easier removal.  I baked my cake in a water bath at 325 for 55 minutes and then cracked the oven door open and shut it off.  I let the cake sit for 1 hour and then refridgerated.  The only other tip I can give you is if your using a stand mixer to make your cheesecake, use slowly while mixing to reduce the air in the mixture and take your time incorporating the eggs.  After cooling, when you flip it over to remove, rub a hot towel over the bottom to loosen the crust and it should come right out.  EXCELLENT RECIPE!  Thanks for sharing!

This is an amazing cheesecake recipe. Your family and friends will thank you for this. I don't even bother adding any extra sugar since the white chips are so sweet. I also use raspberry jam which makes for a very simple and fast cake. I have used a store bought grahm cracker crust and adjusted to 2 cream cheeses and 2 eggs. It fits perfectly in the crust. Tonight I made it with the cookie crust. I couldn't be more happy with this recipe.

I made this last night exactly as the recipe stated.  I can see how this is a 5-star recipe.  This is the best cheesecake I have ever tasted, except from the "Cheesecake Factory", and I can't believe I made it!  Thanks very much CindyAnn for the excellent recipe!

This cheesecake has become a favorite in my house. My daughter asked me to make it for her class for her bday instead of cupcakes. I made them individual cheesecakes in muffin tins. I increased the butter in the Oreo crumbs, so they wouldn't stick and used Raspberry jam on top and swirled it in. Cooked at 350 degrees for 15 min. They were delish and a big hit in her class!!!

This is incredible!  I made this for Easter dinner and everyone LOVED it!  I made this with a regular graham cracker crust (which I doubled) and I made extra raspberry sauce (which I probably didn't need to do) This is something I will make over and over and over!

This cheesecake is excellent!  Everyone wanted seconds.  It is very light and creamy.  The only alteration I would recommend is to double the cookie crust, the chocolate crumb crust with the flavor of the cake and the raspberry sauce is nice!

Made in my large Round Demarle at Home Mold. No need for a springform pan which made for easy clean up and an awesome cheesecake.  My family said it was the best I ever made.  I did sprinkle some white chocolate chips on the crust before I poured the cream cheese mixture into the mold.

This was only my seocnd time baking a cheesecake, and I have to say that this one went much better! The steps are perfectly laid out for even the most hopeless of chefs to tackle, and it turned out to be the creamiest cheesecake I've ever made! The surprisingly easy recipe turned into a desert that woed all of my relatives - it's so easy to make, yet so complex in taste! The white chocolate adds to the creamy cheesecake filling and rasberry puts the right amount of flavour! The flavour was unique and exquisite - I loved every bite, and I think I have a new favorite flavour of cheesecake - what an excellent flavour combination with the white chocolate and rasberry! The only thing I did differently was I used honey graham cracker crumbs instead of chocolate cookie crumbs, but it turned out really well because the crust didn't overpower the delicous center! The only thing I'd reccommend is making more sauce for garnishing afterwards, because I ran a little short when trying to decorate.

I actually give this 10 stars!!! Everyone says this is better than any other cheesecake they have ever had anywhere! I followed this recipe exactly except for the crust, I used oreos.  I have altered this recipe a bit and made choclate chip cheesecake and that was also a HUGE hit. Tonight I am going to attempt to make Mint Choclate Chip cheesecake w/ hot fudge swirl, I can't wait to see how it comes out! I am going to use mint oreos for the crust and possibly cream de menth for the mint flavor. I will update my review and let you know who that turns out. Thank you so much for this recipe, IT IS AMAZING!!!

This was very good, and very easy to make. I'm only giving it 4 stars because I used the amount of sugar listed for the raspberry sauce, and it was a little tart. But that was ok, it balances the cheesecake. I deviated a little in the baking method. I baked the cookie crust for about 10 minutes and let it cool before adding the chessecake filling. I also wrapped two large pieces of aluminum foil around the springform pan and put it in a water bath in the oven. Also left it in the oven for an hour after baking with the door ajar. Then refrigerated it overnight before serving with the raspberry sauce.

Being a cheescake novice, I managed to impress all who tasted my creation. I used blackberry preserves heated in the microwave to save a step, and could have turned off the oven 15 minutes before baking time. It browned a little, and after I turned off the oven, I kept it in to cool down about an hour. Was AMAZING... but def a "special occasion" thing (my hips say)... Thanks

The comination of white chocolate and raspberries is really delicious.  The raspberry sauce was too tart for me. I may try to incorporate more of the sauce into the cheesecake.

This is excellent.
HOWEVER...I just never use white chips, as they are not chocolate, but rather artificially flavored chips.
I prefer real white chocolate, (make with cocoa butter.)  I used 12 oz. of bar white chocolate.  (Ghiaradelli is what the store had.)
The flavor is so much better.
I also use chocolate Teddy Grahams for the crust.  I have used T.G.'s before, in their honey and cinnamon flavors, as well.  They are so easy to crush in the food processor.
I also use the water bath on the shelf directly below the pan.

Made this as my first cheesecake venture ever.  Went by reviews and used oreos (whole pack) rather than cookie crumbs.  Also used seedless preserves to cut back on time.  Checked on it at 55 minutes and it wasn't done.  Let it go 5 minutes longer and still not all the way done.  Turned oven up to 350 for about 3 minutes and then broiler on low for a minute.  Turned out perfect... no cracks.  It is seriously delicious.  Worth the effort!!

Amazing! I made this for my husband to celebrate Valentines Day as it combines two of his favorite things, white chocolate and cheesecake. It was a hit, he loved it and I'm sure I will be making this often. I melted the chocolate in the microwave which was easy. I also microwaved some strawberry jam and used that as opposed to the Raspberry. 5 stars thanks for the recipe!

This was my first cheesecake and it turned out excellent. Made it for a Super Bowl party yesterday. Took a chance it would turn out good and it was a homerun. I used vanilla creme white cookies for the crust. Next time I will try graham crackers to cut the sugar a little. I used seedless raspberry jam. Next time I will thicken so you can see it on the top of the cake. Baked for 1 hr 10 min. at 325 in water bath. Let cool for an hour with oven door cracked. Then left out for a couple more hrs. on the counter before refrigerating. No sign of a crack...

This cheesecake was very good.  I will in future use twice as much oreos and less sugar like other people suggest. Also putting a pan on the rack below to catch the dripping butter would be good. 
Reading the cheesecake article really helped and although I didn't have a cookie sheet that would fit to make a water bath I did bake this cheesecake for 55 min and then turned off the oven and let it finish cooking and it came out perfect without sinking or cracking (I got a few small cracks when I put it into the fridge).
I will be making this for valentine's day!

This cheesecake was an absolute delight to make and eat!  We served it to many guests on New Years Eve.  It wasn't too difficult to make and it was such a beautiful looking dessert to display.  I used gluten free cookies for the crust to accomodate all my GF friends.

Unbelieveable!  I couldn't believe how easy it was to make this cheesecake.  I read all the reviews and used a suggestion from this one and that and I have the greatest tasting cheesecake anyone could ask for, so "Thank You" to all who offered help to use non-cheesecake makers.

Delicious. It's my first attempt, and my cake looks a little unattractive, but it tastes so good.  Definitely going to try it again and make it look appealing as well.

This was a bit too sweet for us. I prefer a more traditional cheesecake with the sour cream topping, etc. It was good, but not the best. I think the white chocolate is a bit too much. No one at my dinner really ate a lot of it, or commented on it, and that's a sheer sign something's up! So I ended up making another cheesecake using my traditional recipe with the sour cream topping. I shaved white chocolate curls over the top and made a fresh raspberry topping. it was outstanding and everyone ate it up!

This was not my favorite cheesecake from this site. It was okay, but still not the best flavored. It cracked terribly, and the sauce was very runny. I probably will not make this one again.

I made this for Christmas and all loved it and asked where I bought it, presentation was amazing, couldn't believe I got "AMAZING" all night since it was my 1st, did the bath, foil and parchment paper no cracks and so easy, didn't have cornstarch so substituted flour, store only had honey graham crackers, still came out perfect, thanks for posting, family is offering money to make this again!

Made this twice so far and it is the best we have made.  Our daughter (15) made this the last time and she said it was very easy for her to do and understand directions.  A keeper for sure.

Best cheesecake recipe I've ever made.  I've made pumpkin, choco chip, and others...but this will be my go to in the future.  I agree with adding the parchment paper under the crust for easier cutting.

This recipe is super delicious and easy to make.  I even was able to add my own twist by adding cranberries to the raspberry topping.

My friends and family swore this was from a restaurant.

OMG! AMAZING CHEESECAKE EVER!!! I did take one persons advice and used the cheesecake techniques on this website. I covered the pan with aluminum foil and "bathed" it in the oven. Came out absolutely AMAZING! Thank you so much for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

This was so good.  I took a shortcut (based on time constraints and not having the proper pan), I used a prepared cookie crust.  Lessened the cream cheese blocks to two, eggs to two.  Followed every thing else.  Lots of rave reviews for one of many Thanksgiving desserts.  Will make again, when my springform pan arrives.

This cheesecake was a huge success at my family's Thanksgiving! Every single one voted this as the best dessert of the night. As recommended by previous reviewers, I did use 2 cups of chocolate cookie crumbs and added about 1 tbsp. of melted butter to the crust as well. I am making this again next week. Huge hit!

EXCELLENT, DELICIOUS!! I always make a Cheesecake for the Holidays for my family, and this was the first time testing out a different new recipe for them. My family was AMAZED!!! There was only one cake and too many people asking for seconds! I should have made another one! I was asked to make this cheesecake for 5 different people, but I told them, either you pay me or I'll just give you the recipe from online. GREAT one to share and bring to all occassions! Did the water bath for the cheesecake and also followed other people's suggestions on how to make this cheesecake to look its best and taste its BEST! I also turned off the oven when it baked and let it sit there the entire night since I made it around 8pm. In the morning, I deorated it and put it into the ridge until the party. Enjoy!

This recipe is absolutely delicious! I make this recipe for any special occasion/potluck and everyone always raves about it. I don't change a thing, and it comes out perfect every time. I've made many many cheesecake recipes and this is absolutely my go-to cheesecake any time of year.

Pretty good, but not as good as I thought it would be.  I got pretty good reviews on it, but everyone still likes my pumpkin cheesecake or just plain New York cheesecake better.

Very good. I made thin swirls with some of the raspberry sauce (using more than called for because I LOVE raspberry) and put tiny drops on the sides of the swirls and it looked like berries on vines. Very festive looking:) Tastes as good as the one at Cheesecake Factory. Flavor definately improves after several days. UPDATE:: after making this several times I CANNOT imagine using raspberry preserves . Come on- this is not too hard and sooooo much better. My only complaint is how long to cool the melted chocolate before adding... And whether the eggs should be added LAST. My colective wisdom from culinary school and years of making cheesecakes tells me the eggs need to be last, as not to beat too much air into them. As always - I usually do use a water bath with ALL cheesecakes, including this one!

I made some changes to this after reading reviews.
To save some time and money, I used seedless raspberry jam, about 1 cup of it heated up for a few sec in the microwave and swirled in to the mix.
I also used oreas for the crust. Used the same amount of butter but reduced the sugar to just 1tbs.
Really delicious and REALLY rich. Tastes just fantastic. My husband loved it and he's asked me to make it again for a work function :)

I have made this twice now. First time I made this was for my daughters birthday picnic in the summer, it was a massive hit, I doubled the entire recipe and I didn't even get a bit! It was gone- ALL gone! I did however pinch a bite from hubbys plate and was kinda surprised to find the base was soggy!! I thought it was because of the heat but I have just made it again and cooled it for hours and still soggy.. really? Is this a soggy biscuit base cheesecake? uh.. my winning cheesecake just can't have a soggy biscuit base.. I'm going to adapt my own cheesecake recipe with the best bits of this one and see what happens.

I had some small issues, like I didn't have a springform pan, and I couldn't get the cookie crumbs small enough, would have been to shallow of cheesecake, so I bought the chocolate cookie graham crust and since that was shallow, this recipe actually made two cheesecakes. Instead of making the raspberry stuff, I bought the small can of raspberry pie filling. It turned out amazing! Takes everything in me not to eat the entire cheesecake on my own. Very good stuff! I also let it cool in the oven like other people said. If you use the premade crusts, just know this recipe makes two cheesecakes.

I have made this many times and it's always amazing! I always cook it in a water bath for an hour, then turn off the oven and crack the door open and leave it in the oven until it's completely cool and never have any cracks. ***Great tip for avoiding leaks when cooking in a water bath is to set the cheesecake pan in a turkey oven bag then set it in the water bath. I simply roll down the sides so they aren't in the way and I never have any leaks. Don't have to worry about foil tearing or anything.

This is a good recipe. I made it exactly as it specifies and it turned out great. It is best to cook in a water bath to assure even cooking, otherwise you are asking for cracking and some browning on the edges.

Will make again and would highly recommend

This cheesecake came out great! I used all of the raspberry sauce in the cheesecake, and also left the cake in the oven for an hour after baking time. Was I supposed to taste the white chocolate?

OMG this was fabulous!  I took advise from other reviewers on the raspberry jam and leaving out the sugar from the crust and it turned out great.  I topped with fresh raspberries and refrigerated hot fudge ice cream topping.

Very good. I made with a pie pan and big muffin pan with a Oreo Cookie on the bottom of the muffin pan. I didn't have anything to sift the seeds so I left them in. Still very tasty- just not as pretty as it should be if it was made with the correct pan. Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this, as did everyone else! Very easy to make! Something to remember though: Don't cut down the chilling time dramatically. I was running out of time, and so it got to chill in the fridge for about 2 hours. When it came time to cut, the middle was runny even though a toothpick came out clean. We ate some, chilled it overnight, and it firmed up very nicely. 
I used the one reviewers suggestion of jam, so I heated some raspberry jam and strained it, and it was amazing!

Not nearly as good as I thought it would be. The white chocolate completely overpowered the cheesecake flavor. Not worth the effort.

Got raving reviews on this recipe!! It was delicious.  I had no cracking and did not use a water bath as other posts suggested.  I did use seedless raspberry preserves to save time and used yellow oreo cookies instead of chocolate-didn't last long.

I made this w/ pre made oreo crust and there was enough to make 2 whole cakes.  I cooked them seperately, ajusted the cook time to 35 mins then turned the oven off and let each sit in the warm oven for an additional 30 mins and they cooked perfectly w/ no cracks.  I served w/ fresh raspberries and only thing I will do differently is make extra sauce. Thanks!

Excellent recipe, I've made 3 times now. I used a roasting pan 1/2 full of boiling water to cook then cover with a bowl for an hour to cool. It comes out perfect. 
Top with fresh or frozen raspberries and top with sauce and it's a huge hit. 
Thanks for sharing!!

I used 1 c. crushed shortbread cookies and chopped toasted almonds instead of chocolate crumbs for the crust. I also omitted the half and half and added 2/3 c. sour cream to the batter with the vanilla.  Make sure the cream cheese is softened and slightly warm so the white chocolate doesn't harden too fast. I also followed the suggestion of putting the pan on a cookie sheet with water during baking.

I've actually sold these to co-workers for them to take to parties.  They are amazing!  The PERFECT cheesecake.  I sometimes also make them with a vanilla wafer crust and strawberries on top which is just as good if not better.  Just as a base cheesecake, this is the best one I've ever made.

This is by far the best cheesecake i've ever made!  I did substitute fresh strawberries for the rasberries (they were on sale).  I used oreos for the cookie crumbs (blended them for about 3 minutes).  UPDATE:  Used 1/2 cup Rasberry jam (no added sugar) which i microwaved for about 1 minute and proceeded with the instructions.  turned out great.  This cake definitely needs a water bath!

Creamy.  No cracks.  Def. double the cookie crumbs, no sugar needed in the crust and 2-3 TBSP butter is fine for it.  Bake for one hour, shut the oven off, and forget about it for a few hours until cooled, then cool some more in the fridge.  Do this and use a water bath and you will have a perfectly baked cheesecake.  Thanks for a deadly cheesecake recipe!

Yummy! Made this for my boyfriend's birthday and it was a big hit.  I used seedless raspberry jam as others had suggested and I also put just a hint of lemon zest in the whipping cream that I served with it.  Will definitely make again!

This cheesecake is very rich and very good!  I doubled the Oreo crust as others suggested and was glad I did.  I also used the raspberry jam method as others suggested and then garnished with whole raspberries on top.  I could not see nor could barely taste the raspberry jam.  When I make this again I will increase the jam significantly.  This made a very impressive presentation and was well received by all guests.  A little does go a long way.  Thank you for sharing this decadent recipe!

Beautiful and delicious! I made this for my MIL's anniversary and got such good reviews that I made a second one in a weeks time! The only modifications that I made were to increase the amount of chocolate cookie crumbs, personal preference. This one's a keeper.

My husband was actually mad at me for making this.  He said he had to have at least one piece every day until it was gone.  I put half the mix in a premade chocolate cookie pie crust (totally cheating I know) and put the rest in a muffin tin with shortbread cookie crusts.  Both were loved!

I made this for our daughters 29th birthday. It was my first try at a "real" cheesecake and it turned out great. I took the advice of another rater and left it  in the oven with the door open for 1 hour after the cooking time was up. No cracks! I'll make this again..and again...Thanks!

This was awesome (and I dislike white chocolate)!!  I just used Oreos for the crust (no sugar) and 3 T butter.  I would highly recommend making the raspberry sauce!  I don't think seedless jam has the fresh, delicious raspberry taste like the sauce in this recipe does.  Will definitely make this again!!

A Cheesecake Factory quality cheesecake! Soooo good! I baked it in a water bath for about 55 minutes, then turned the oven off and opened the door a bit. I let it cool in the oven this way for an hour. I immediately refridgerated it, but the next day it was a bit difficult to come out. Maybe it was just the heart-shaped pan I used (it was Valentine's Day). The white chocolate flavor wasn't too strong, so I suggest using more if you love white chocolate! Also, melt the white chocolate completely before mixing in the half and half. I baked all of the raspberry sauce in the batter in three layers. I'll definately make this again.

I've made cheesecakes for years and have to admit this one was a standout.  I made a few modifications.  I used a full bag of Ghiardelli white choc. chips and had 2 squares of white baking chocolate that I added as well.  Super rich flavor.  I did not have frozen rasberries, so I used Polaner seedless blackberry jam.   Everyone RAVED over this.  The blackberry and white chocolate flavors combined were absolutely decadent.  I will definitely be making this one again.  I've already had several requests for it.

This was AWESOME!  I have been looking for a good cheesecake recipe for ages but always seem to find the ones that have a citrus taste.  I followed the directions exactly except for the use of Oreo's for the crust; if you do this cut back on the butter the Oreo filling will help hold it together.  I probably won't add the filling in the middle next time, it didn't seem that important.  I used frozen raspberries, but will probably use a preserve next time to save me the effort.  Overall, I'm totally going to make this again...soon!

Amazing!  Very good tasting and very beautiful and attractive.  I suggest covering the bottom of your spring pan with two pieces of tin foil and placing the pan in another pan that has water in it to bake the cheesecake evenly.  Also, I would suggest making more raspberry sauce then indicated in the recipe for topping when serving.

I have made a few cheesecakes from this site, and this was by FAR the best, lapping the others even.  Firstly, I use all the tips from this site, including water bath, and then the article on how to mix the ingredients to obtain the perfect consistency.  This is important info.  USE it.  Also, always use the oversize Reynolds heavy Duty aluminum foil when using the H2O bath.  Dont skimp unless you like cheescake smoothie.  I used seedless rasperry fruit spread and maybe it's denser than than when you actually make the reasperry, because it sunk to the bottom of the cake and it refused to swirl.  I did nuke it and drizzle it over the top when I served the cake.  best cheesecake I've evermade from this site, hands down.

I followed the advice from previous reviewers and doubled the cookie crumbs for the crust - this is necessary. Crust was very good. You may also want to try the crust from the "Basic Cheesecake" recipe on this site. Other than this, I followed the recipe exactly. The cheesecake was very easy to make but the end result was far too sweet for my taste. I may attempt again with one alteration - reduce to 1 cup of white chocolate chips and cross my fingers. Avoid cracks in your cheesecake by using a water bath - works every time.

This was easy, and everyone loved it so I am making another one for new years eve. I wish the recipe was clearer on how to do the rasberry middle, but it is still 5 stars for taste and presentation. I used a regular graham crust, but think if I had done the chocolate cookie one it would have had more of an chocolate flavor and I will next time. It was yummmm...

I used double chocolate oreo cookies, and 1.5 TBS sugar for the crust, and then made exactly as directed. I loved it, and have no complaints however many of my family members have commented that it is a bit too sweet for them.

Mmm, very very good, just what The Man requested for his birthday treat. I too used jam but didn't melt it all the way liquid and it kind of sunk to the bottom of the crust: still delicious, but not quite the presentation I was hoping. I wish I could share with you all my tricks for perfect cheesecake, but I'm learning to accept and love my cracked brown cheesecakes. The texture and flavor was spot-on, thanks so much for sharing!

Make sure you leave your butter and eggs out for atleast 30 minutes before baking.  I substituted blackberries for this last time I made it and it was just as fantastic!  To keep the fresh berries standing on end like the picure, melt some white chocolate almond bark and dripple on to cheeescake.  It keeps the berries in place much better (especially if traveling with cheesecake.)

This is an EXCELLENT cheesecake.  I followed the recipe (with the exception of the raspberry sauce recipe, just used smuckers seedless jam and microwaved it) and it came out perfectly!  One of the easiest and yummiest cheesecakes i've made.  Everyone loved it!

I did a variation of this recipe and the mini cheesecakes recipe.  I changed the servings to 6 so that they would fit in 12 cupcake cups.  It was perfect and delicious.  I also decided to use regular graham crackers instead of chocolate.  The hubby loved them!  :)

I made this last year for a Progressive Dinner Party. It was my first time ever making a cheesecake and I was scared to death. Turns out, I had nothing to worry about. It's great (and easy)!!

Awesome to come home to this beautiful recipe cooked by my son.  He is so creative and as the cupboards did not have white choco chips or frozen raspberries he had to improvise.  What turned out was sooooo soooooo very incredible and can't wait to make again with your exact ingredients.  (or hopefully he will cook again as he puts me to shame)  He used semi-sweet chocolate chips and frozen boysenberries.  Oh, and I forgot to say I did not have chocolate cookies.  He made the Chocoate Mint I cookie recipe in this site but left out the 36 mints.  Sounds crazy to go through so much effort, but I would pay huge for a single slice at any fine restaurant. Thank you for inspiring him and I wish I would have thought to take a picture.  The marbled top was beautiful even before adding the super syrup.  Again, thank you and it is soon to be repeated word for word!

This is a definite 5 star recipe!  It tasted as good as it looked.  I used the advice of a previous review and baked the cheesecake with foil around the bottom.  I put it on a cookie sheet and filled the sheet with water.  It baked for an hour and then I turned the oven off and let it sit for another hour before putting in the fridge for the night.  It did not sink or get too brown and there were no cracks.  The top was perfectly swirled and beautiful.  I have made many cheesecakes over the years and this one is by far at the top of the list!!

this was amazing - we took it over to a friends  house, it was described as "epic" wow!! I didn't have half and half so used a little bit of 1%, which was fine, next time (which will be sooner than later) I will probably add a few more raspberries.  YUM! Cant wait to eat this again!!

It was delicious! However, there was too much raspberry sauce left over. Though, thats not that bad of an issue as I just made raspberry mojitos with it.

Best cheesecake ever! This was my first time making cheesecake and everyone loved it! If you are looking for a little less work, you could buy a premade chocolate crust. I didn't strain the seeds out and everyone who tried it said that it's much better with the seeds! Delicious recipe.

A great cheesecake!  I had to stop myself from eating the batter!!  Only 4 stars, though, because it came out a little flatter than my usual cheesecakes, but excellent in taste!!!

AMAZING and so easy to make! I cook, I never bake, but this was so easy not even I could mess it up! I made it for my mother's church potluck and they ALL wanted the recipe. Next time I think I'll make it with dark chocolate chips instead since I really like the combination of dark chocolate with raspberries.

I'm known for a mean caramel apple cheesecake but that's about to take a backseat! As a cheesecake enthusiast I've been known to be very particular about CC recipes. This one is a keeper. My family isn't particularly fond of raspberries so I substituted strawberries. I also took another reviewer's advice about purchasing jam(strawberry in my case) and microwaving it for a few seconds. Amazing. I wish that I'd taken a pic of the cheesecake fresh out of the SF pan or after slicing because it looked great. I also used whipped cream which melted and spread across the surface and down the sides of the cheesecake so evenly that others swore that I'd done it myself. The added vanilla from this enhanced it beyond anything we'd imagined by adding a nice contrast.

Even though I have not yet tasted this cake I can already tell it's a 5 star. It is baking in the oven now and smells so delicious. It is a little time consuming, especially when you have to strain the seeds from the raspberry sauce. Leave the cream cheese out beforehand so that it is room temperature when it comes time to mix. I also took the advice of another reviewer and wrapped the bottom of my pan in tin foil and cooked it on a cookie sheet w/ water. Don't over beat the cream cheese as it adds bubbles to the surface of your cake. White chocolate = YUM!!!

"That was the best cheesecake I've ever had!" was a comment I received after making this! And I have to agree - I made it for a baby shower and there were plenty of leftover desserts, but the cheesecake was all gone! I took the advice of someone else here who said they doubled the amount of white chocolate morsels used, as well as using a 10" springform pan. Not only did the cheesecake taste wonderful, but it was very "pretty". A dab of homemade whipped cream w/a raspberry on top and white chocolate shavings made the cheesecake "look like a gourmet dessert" (another compliment!). I've already had people tell me they want me to make it again and I can't wait! The extra prep required by this cheesecake compared to regular cheesecakes is well worth it. It was a crowd-pleaser!

I made this for a Memorial day bbq. I had every intention of having a slice, but it was all gone by the time i got to it. From what I was told it was really good. I used raspberry preserves heated in the microwave, I also used oreos with its cream filling for the crust but added no sugar. I was able to melt the WCCs with a little milk (had no half n half) and touch of butter in the microwave. When cut, the crust just crumbled right off, didnt hold to the cake, dont know why. i'll try some other cookie next time or prebaking the crust.

Delicious!! Divine!!  Made for my son's birthday. I do agree about 2 cups for the cookies, because it makes a nice layer of crust for the bottom and then only add 1 Tb. instead of the 3 of sugar.  I will make this recipe again.  I did not use a water bath. I just put a pan of water in the oven.  My cheesecake did not crack.

My husband doesn't like cheesecake, but he said this is the best he's ever tasted.  I followed the advice of some other reviewers and used two cups of oreo crumbs and reduced the sugar to 1T for the crust.  I also followed the advice to blend the raspberries and water together, sieve, and then make the sauce.  I only used 1 T sugar in the sauce instead of 2.  I melted the chocolate with the half and half in the microwave.  So very good and worth all the effort to make!

This is a very rich cheesecake!! It is creamier and thicker than say Cheesecake Factory cheesecakes and smoother and moister than traditional NY style cheesecake. I followed the advice of another reviewer and double the chocolate cookie's used for the crust. I used actual chocolate wafers and would definitely NOT reccomend using Oreos, they cannot give the same effect. I also followed someone else's advice and used seedless raspberry jam. I heated it in the microwave so it was like syrup and used almost a jar - I really like fruit with cheesecake and that amount was not overpowering. I also used fresh raspberries on top and whip cream. This dish was excellent but too rich to make regularly. Also, I read other reviews in which people said that the white chocolate was overwhelming...I couldn't really taste it. Just a rich cheesy cake.

I made a few minor adjustments just for my own taste and ingredients that I had on hand.  I didn't have white chocolate so I used reg chocolate chips and I didn't want the chocolate throughout the cake so I just added the chips to the batter once it was all mixed.  I left the berry mixture unstrained and the berries whole so when you bite into the cheesecake you get little chunks of berry and chocolate intermingled!  Instead of the half and half used for melting the chocolate I added sour cream to the batter.  This cheesecake looks and tastes very impressive.  Thanks!

I have read time and again to avoid using non fat cream cheese in cheesecakes, but I can't help watching the calories, and it still turned out AMAZING! I followed the cheesecake tips about putting it in a water bath. Great recipe!

This is a fabulous cheesecake. It looks so pretty and I've played with the swirls on top to make different designs.  Just remember to let your creamchz soften for a little bit before you start, and be sure to use the water bath while baking and leave it in the oven after it's done for about an hour.  I always make the raspberry sauce by hand and it's WORTH IT! That's the part everyone raves about the most. It's really not hard at all.  It's a hit every time!! Thanks!

This turned out perfect and I have never tried to make a cheesecake before...I did follow some tips from other reviewers and didn't beat the mix too much, put aluminum foil under the springform pan and placed it in about 1/2" of water.  I also let it bake for the full time and then left the door open as it cooled.  It really didn't look done so it was tempting to keep baking it., but so many people said to just let it sit.  However, it turned out perfect with no cracks and everyone loved it.  I am passing around the recipe.

This was wonderful.  I followed other peoples advice. 1) I used 2 cups of oreo crumbs for the crust.  I used 18 oreos for this. When putting it on the bottom, I pressed it up the sides about 1/4 inch so it would come out of the pan easier.  2)  I used seedless raspberry jam.  Doing this saved a lot of time.  ***note when pouring on the second layer of batter, the raspberry jelly gets lost into the batter.  When you cut it you will not see the raspberry jam.  However, you do see it on top of the cheesecake.  It does make a very pretty presentation.  3) I used a water bath method.  Cooked for 1 hour, left it in the oven for 1 hour, cooled it in the fridge (with plastic on the surface) overnight.  The next day, I removed the rim and the plastic wrap as per instructions.  Hubby and kids said to add it to the regular rotation.  I did not serve this with more jam on the top, it is sweet enough.

Excellent!  Everyone in my family absolutely loved it!  Looked and tasted like it came from a restaurant.  I did add about a cup more white chocolate chips and 3/4 cup half and half instead of 1/2 cup.  Turned out great!

I LOVE this recipe and have made it for every holiday for the past few years (by request).  After the first few times of using the frozen raspberries I used someone's suggestion about getting the jar of seedless rasp. jam and it was a HUGE time saver without any mess.  The only other thing I change is using Vanilla Wafers instead of the chocolate cookie crumbs.  Thanks so much for the recipe!!

Wonderful recipe, I followed it to a tee except for one detail.  The key word when making the raspberry sauce is "thick".  If you add the cornstarch to start, it's way too thick to go through the mesh.  I added 1/4 cup of water to the raspberries, brought them to a boil, mashing as it went to make sure all the juice was combined, and then strained them.  Returned to the pan without a single seed, added the cornstarch, and it almost immediately thickened up.

Third time making, forgot to add the half&half to the white chocolate and it still turned out delicious and great creamy yet firm texture.  Oreo crust, raspberry preserves, double the recipes and - Croud pleaser.

I made a total of ten cheesecakes for my husband's 50th birthday party last night.  I can't thank Allrecipes.com enough!  I made this cheesecake (by far the most popular), along with Caramel Chocolate Pecan, Eggnog, and Chocolate Khalua. I prepared one at a time in advance and froze them all.  Every one presented beautifully.  Having never made cheesecake before I trusted every recipe & review here. Everyone thought these were store bought! I think I'll make these for Christmas gifts. Use water baths with the pan wrapped well in foil & a roasting bag. Cook for 80 minutes then turn the oven off & crack the door to set for 4 hours. Chill, then lift to a tray to wrap & freeze.

Fantastic recipe. This was my first attempt at cheesecake as I was given my first set of springform pans for my birthday. It was a big hit. My only suggestions follow along the lines of what others have suggested. You can get by with a cup of crumbs on the bottom (expect them to be VERY thin with a few uncovered spots), but I would suggest a cup and a half - two cups instead. For anyone else attemtping a cheesecake for the first time I would really recommend the tips section and reading others reviews for helpful advise. I covered the bottom of my pan in foil and sat pan into another pan with about an inch of water. I turned off the oven after an hour and left to sit in the oven for another hour. It turned out flawless.

Delicious. Used an Oreo crust. Baked an hour on a cookie sheet with water & the spring pan wrapped in foil to keep the water out, then shut the oven off and left it in there one more hour. I mixed raspberries with sugar (set an hour) & placed it in a bowl for people to spoon it on if they wanted. This made it unbelievable.

Wonderful company recipe! Give yourself enough time when you make this. I didn't think I'd like the white chocolate but it rounded out the cream cheese flavor nicely. A "hint" of almond extract in the cheese/white chocolate mixture is also good. Don't shortchange yourself - the raspberry sauce as written is well worth your time. A bit extra (1 1/2 x ) gives you enough to drizzle an attractive and "tasteable amount" on top of each slice you serve. If you make the cheesecake a few days ahead it will be even better. Belle's Mom (5/11/09) gave good advice on this recipe regarding ingredient temperature and mixing time.  My crust did stick to the pan a bit; I'll try a different flavored crust next time for variety - maybe Capn Matt's (2/18/09) or Dawn's (12/5/07) crust. My opinion is that if the top falls in a little it's not an insurmountable problem - you get a rim inside which you can place berries,almond slices, the raspberry sauce, whipped cream, etc. TUVM

YUM!  A little bit time consuming but so worth it.  I doubled the oreos for the crust and baked it in a water bath.  Turned the oven off after an hour and left it overnight.  So so so delicious and so worth the effort!

This was absolutely fantastic! Definately worth the trouble of making it. The only thing that I changed about the recipe was doubling the cookie crust. I also wrapped the bottom of the pan in foil and set it in a cookie sheet full of water while I baked it. Make sure it has enough water that it won't evaporate during the baking process. I baked it for an hour and then turned the oven off and left it in with the door cracked for another hour.

Oh my.  This was unbelievable.  I don't like sweets and never eat dessert, but, when I was making this it smelled so good that I tried a little piece when cutting it.  This recipe could make me a dessert lover.  I made this for friends who came over to dinner and even after eating 2 appys and ribeye steak and shrimp with twice baked potatoes, they inhaled this cheesecake.  A definite winner.  Thank you so much for posting the recipe.  BTW I made it exactly as written

I've made this cheesecake 3 o 4 times and everyone just loved it!!!! The first time didn't turn out as good, it browned more than I would have liked and it was too sweet for my taste, but the second (and rest) went great. I did use half the white chocolate and I kept it in the oven at 325 for 10 minutes and then at half that temperature until done. Absolutely wonderful cheesecake!

This was an outstanding cheesecake!  I did alter a bit, by using regular graham cracker crumbs and omitting the whole raspberry part of the recipe.  I needed a good basic cheesecake recipe - the melted white chocolate was a nice twist on the same 'ole NY Cheesecake.  This was my second cheesecake I've ever made (the first one was morbidly over-baked)... I followed the directions of many others by using a waterbath, only baking an hour & then leaving it in the oven to cool for an hour or two and it came out terrific!!  Many compliments from all who tried it!  I mixed it up by topping with a homemade mango topping in the recipe for 'Trini Mango Cheesecake.'  Delish!!  Thanks so much for the recipe!  (I'll be sure to eventually bake the original recipe someday...)

This is a delicious cheesecake.  Only four stars though because it is one of the most time consuming and messy recipes I've made (and I cook a lot of gourmet foods) and I ended up with a lot of extra "batter".  I hated to waste it, but that's what ended up happening.  The end product was great though, and I would love to have this again.

I am soo sorry to give this a low rating.  I wanted to love it, I really did.  I followed the recipe exactly and even used the water bath method(no cracks at all!) and the cheesecake came out like a pudding rather than a cheesecake.  The texture of this cheesecake was actually pretty gross.  I do not know what I did wrong, or if this is just one of those kinds of cheesecakes.  I love for mine to be smooth and creamy, but NOT pudding!  The flavor of it was just alright as well.  All the great reviewers must not have had some better cheesecakes.  I should stop comparing every one I eat to the cheesecake factory.  There is NO comparison.  It did look very pretty though.  Sorry.

Amazing!!!!!! This was by far the best cheesecake I have ever had. It turned out wonderfully as is. I didn't change or alter the recipe at all. I would recommend this recipe to anyone. Also, it seemed a lot of people had trouble with the raspberry sauce, but if you cook it long enough it will become thinner and easier to strain.

The best cheesecake I have EVER had.  It was really pretty too!  I added 1/4c cornstarch to the batter so that it wouldn't crack, b/c I didn't have a pan big enough to fit my springform pan in. Turned out great.

So, this was my first attempt in making a cheesecake.  I prepared myself by reading the hints/tips on making cheesecakes from this website.  I wrapped my aluminum foil around the springform pan, baked this cheesecake in a water bath, and allowed the cheesecake to sit in the oven (after the cooking time) for 2 hours with the oven off, before placing it in the refrigerator.  I had NO cracks, NO bubbles, the cheesecake released itself from the pan easily and it did NOT sink in the middle!  This recipe made me look like a pro!  I did make a few changes:  I used seedless raspberry jam, and I layered the top of the cheesecake with raspberry sauce, drizzles of white chocolate, and toasted almonds.  I then repeated the white chocolate and almonds layers.  I also packed the sides of the cheesecake with toasted almonds as well.  The cheesecake looked very professional and no one believed that I actually cooked it (they thought that it had been picked up from our cheesecake business in town).  The cheesecake was delicious and was a huge hit!  Will definately make many times!

I used another reviewer's suggestion and used seedless raspberry preserves and it worked great and was super easy...I kept enough of the preserves behind to put a nice splash on the plates prior to serving and a few lines on the cake top as well...it looked very professional and elegant and was a huge hit at a couples Valentines Dinner Party.   I also decided against the chocolate cookie crust and instead used the following: 3/4 cup graham crackers crumbs, 3/4 cup dry quick oats, 3/4 cup finely chopped/ground almonds (I just used a pack of almond slices and chopped them super fine)...4 Tablespoons butter (melted)and 1/4 cup sugar...pressed in pan and further shaped and pressed with the bottom of a flat tumbler glass...5 minutes in oven at 325 and cooled on wire rack while preparing the other ingredients. This cheesecake was a HUGE hit with everyone!

This is really good. Super rich though so I can only have a couple bites! If you want it to turn out really good do NOT use perserves, its way better with real     raspberries! It only takes an extra 10 mins. I put the berries and water and sugar in the blender and puree them. Then strain the seeds out and heat it up with the cornstarch. It worked fabulously! Preserves are just way too sweet and there is something about the tartness  of real berries that makes this so yummy! Also I did a water bath and it really kept it moist with no sinking or cracking. Then I cooked it for an hour turned the oven off and let it cool another hour before I moved it to the fridge. I recommend this recipe, its a good one! Thanks for sharing!

Five big stars for this cheesecake!  It tastes outstanding, was not exceptionally hard to put together and comes out looking gorgeous.  I did listen to reviewers suggestions to change the proportions of the crust ingredients. I used 2 cups of processed Oreo crumbs, 1 tablespoon sugar and 1/4 C butter.  I agree with others that it is very easy to substitute seedless raspberry jam for the cooked sauce.  Just be sure to warm & stir the jam until it is easy to spoon over the cheese filling.  I believe when I make this again I will follow ginsu89's suggestion to freeze the cake the night before and let it set in the fridge about 6 six hours before cutting and serving.  Another Allrecipes winner!

People absolutely love this cheesecake.  It's a bit labor intensive, and I have yet to find seedless raspberry jam, but it still rocks.  Just at tip: Freeze the cake the night before serving.  Let it thaw about four or five hours in the fridge before serving.  It will slice very nicely yet still be firm.  Delicious!  Thanks.

I made this for Thanksgiving.  It was awesome!  People thought I bought it, I loved telling them that I made it.  Everyone was amazed by it.  It is soooo good!  You MUST bake it in a water bath, I didn't once and it cracked.  Also, make sure you use foil around the spring form.  I didn't and some water got in; it wasn't horrible but the bottom was a little soggy.  I also turn the oven off and keep the door closed for a few hours so it cools slowly.  This is a GREAT recipe!

Incredible!
A couple of recommendations--A happy accident had me with Newman's Own Chocolate Chocolate Chip cookies (they are called 'Champion Chip Cookies') to use for the crust.  I was concerned that the chocolate chips might be two melty and moist on the bottom, but I was happily mistaken.  The cookies are quite crisp and very cocoa-y.  I think it made a less cloying layer than oreos, and very complimentary to the blend of flavors.  I used 3 cups of white chocolate rather than 2. If you can get a white chocolate that contains cocoa butter, do so--the taste is distinctly different from Nestle's white chocolate. The biggest change I made was in the way I dealt with the Raspberries.  I used fresh, but this would work as well with frozen.  I used more raspberries--12 ounces rather than 10 (the fresh raspberries are packaged in 6 oz containers, so this was easy to determine...) I pureed them first, then pushed them through a fine mesh strainer with a flexible silicon spatula.  When I had pushed as much through as would go with that method, I poured the water (using 3/4 rather than 1/2 a cup)over the raspberries a bit at a time to really get everything but the seeds through.  It worked very well.  Once the raspberries and the water were in the pot, I added 4 1/2 tbsp sugar rather than 3, and 1 1/2 to 2 tbsp of corn starch.  I did a thin but complete layer of raspberries in the middle of the cake.  I marbled some into the top of the cake as well, then reserved the rest until the

My 12 year old daughter made this recipe.  This was the best cheesecake we have ever eaten.  After reading the reviews she used 1 3/4 cups of crushed oreo cookie without the cream.  She added 2 tablespoons of butter and 1 1/2 tablespoons of sugar to the butter and sugar called for.  We cut a parchment paper circle for the bottom of the pan and used shortening on the sides.  She baked the crust for 10 minutes before filling.  She did use the water bath (boiling the water before adding to the pan) and wrapped the outside of the pan in foil.  She had to bake it 70 minutes due to getting some water in the milk and white chocolate while melting it or maybe from having two sheets of aluminum foil around the pan.  We cooked it until just the center was wobbly. We also turned off the oven and let it cool for 1 hour with the door partially open.   It turned out perfect.  No browning and no cracks.  This is sure to be the family favorite and will be made again.

A bit frustrating process, until you get to actually taste it, but all in all an elegant and special dessert.

My fiance went crazy about it! For me it was just ok, but only because I don't care for the butter-y taste of white chocolate too much, and would prefer something more chees-y.

It is a good idea for a special occasion, though. Thanks for sharing!

I made this with my girlfriend today for my dad's birthday and it couldn't have gone better. Prep was simple, and we left the oven door closed despite the enticing smell. Everyone at the party was going nuts over it.  Extra raspberry topping went over vanilla ice cream on the side.  There were no cracks, though i could have greased the sides better. And it could have taken a few less minutes.  I'm making it again tomorrow so i can actually have a piece.  THANKS MUCH!

This was FAB and looked great - I followed one review and baked for an hour and left in the oven for a further hour before refrigerating....this worked just great. Definitely double the cookie base - I would not add any sugar as if you use oreo cookies this is enough sweetness.....my husband's favorite - he says I should make this and sell it - it is that good!!!

Brilliant!  Hands down THE best cheesecake that has ever come out of my oven.  I loved the texture and mixture of sweet white chocolate and the sweet-tart flavor of the raspberries. 

Using crushed Oreos as the crust a great idea.  I just used 2 rows out of a pack of cookies, processed them in the food processor and 3 table spoons of melted butter to make the crust, no extra added sugar needed, in my opinion.

I also used a bain marie (water bath) to cook the cheesecake. Cooking it for one hour at the recommended temperature then I turned my oven off and left it for another hour.  Cooled it on rack for about another hour then covered with saran wrap and placed it in the refrigerator.

One other thing I did was made more of the raspberry sauce to have more to use to plate the cheesecake when serving.  

As I said at the begining of my post, BRILLIANT! Thanks for sharing this with us Cindy!

Just made this for my mom's birthday dinner and everyone loved this cheese cake. I followed the recipe completely and applied some of the suggested medthods from AllRecipes.com staff (see tips & advices article on making cheese cake).  I applied the waterbath method which it really made my cake highly presentable without the shinking middle or any cracks. I also left the oven door open after the baking to ensure the cake is fully baked. I used frozen raspberries and de-frosted them before use, this will make them cook faster without burning. It does make the taste more raspberry-ish compare to using raspberry jam. There were so much seeds (about 1/3 of the entire portion), so draining the seeds out is a good idea. Lastely, this recipe can use more crust. 1 cup is not enough to cover a 9-in pan without leaking. Use at least 1.5 to 2 cups cookies for crust. Love this recipe a lot. THANK YOU!

I agree with the others - this is really a top-rate cheesecake.  The texture is divine; creamy yet not too soft and not too "cheesy".  For the crust I used 2/3 package oreos, no sugar and 1/4c. melted butter drizzed into the food processor.  This gave me a nice firm crust and enough crumbs to go a bit up the sides.  Dickenson's seedless rasberry jam heated in the microwave made a perfect swirl and I drizzed more on top when I served it.

Great recipe.  I used the seedless raspberry jam and chocolate cookie crust and it turned out perfect.  I also followed the tips for cheesecake (water bath, keep in oven 1 hour after baking).  I had a couple of crackswhere the raspberry swirles were but they were minimal and hard to see.  This was a creamy cheesecake!

Oh, so incredible. 
I've made this recipe a few times, and now its nearly committed to memory, but each time I make it, I make a slight alteration. Here are my suggestions:
You only need a 425 g tub of frozen raspberries, just let them defrost with a pinch of sugar in them, and then drain them, and press the berries into the crust, sort of a jam like spread in the bottom. Then pour in the batter, with no raspberry in it at all, and then drizzle about half the juice onto the top and marble it. It looks so pretty when it comes out, and with the raspberries as part of the crust you dont need more in the batter. Also, I find that you need 1 1/2 cups of cookie crumbs/ graham cracker crumbs to make the crust. And just add a splash of amaretto/ almond extract, it just gives the batter a really unique flavour that sets off the raspberries wonderfully.
This is by far my favorite sinful dessert. Thanks so much for the recipe!

I wish I could give this recipe 10 stars*** I have never made a cheesecake before.  I took a chance and made this recipe for Christmas eve dinner for my husband's family.  I can't tell you how decadent and amazing this recipe is!!  Next time I will double the raspberry sauce so that there is enough.  Even those who weren't partial to cheesecake raved and raved!  I took the advice of others and left it sit in the oven for an hour.  I had one small crack but I shaved more white chocolate on top to cover it up.  I also did the crust by hand and the batter by hand.  Next time I will use a food processor for the crust but I will continue to make the batter by hand with a whisk.  It added texture which my husband loved.

Be forewarned - I made changes:  This was absolutely Delicious!!   
I used raspberry jam instead of making the raspberry sauce.  The resulting swirls weren't as pretty as if I'd have used the raspberry sauce because the jam isn't as red, but I love raspberry jam.  I also made the crust with 1 pkg of Walker's Shortbread, a scant half cup of pecans and half the butter called for.  The reason I did this is because I thought a shortbread crust would be really good with the white chocolate.  Instead of the white baking chips I used 3 3.5 oz bars of Lindt White Chocolate.  Using real white chocolate cuts down on the overly sweet taste of the white baking chips. 
I will definitely be making this again and I might even make the raspberry sauce next time! 
I took the advise of other reviewers and left the cheesecake in the turned off oven with the door ajar for an hour.  It had a few cracks on top but not a lot.

I also used seedless raspberry jam instead of frozen raspberries, and it tasted wonderful!  I also used a few more Oreos than the recipe called for to really cover the bottom of the pan.

A great recipe.  I love that cheesecakes should be made the day before. It is great for busy dinner parties.  I am not artistic at all, but I didn't find the swirling of the raspberry sauce that hard. I just spooned the raspberry sauce into a bag, snipped off the end, and decorated with that, and then used a skewer to pull lines through my design.

Here is another variation, which uses bittersweet chocolate and a brownie crust:  Prepare a brownie mix and pour into a springform pan.  Bake for 10 minutes.   Prepare the filling as specified, substituting Ghirardelli Bittersweet Chocolate Chips for the white chocolate.  Pour 1/3 the filling into the pan.  Swirl in some raspberry preserves.  Pour in another 1/3 of filling.  Top with 1/4 pkg Hershey's Dark Chocolate and Raspberry chocolate chips.  Pour in remaining filling.  Top with another 1/4 pkg of the chips, then swirl with more raspberry preserves. Bake, cool, and chill as specified.

I made this for the first time on V-Day. Hubby said it was the BEST he'd ever had. I was a bit disappointed.  It looked gorgeous and tasted AMAZING, but fell apart when I sliced it. The crust was stuck to the bottom of the pan, and the middle was really gooey. I used a ready-made Oreo cookie crust, broke it up into just crumbs, then added butter & sugar. I don't know how much butter & sugar the crust had in it when I started, so...I think I also packed it too much. I also used raspberry jam. This worked fabulously. But, there wasn't enough of it, and it was all at the top. Then, I baked it in a water bath for 50 mins, and let it sit in the oven for 1 hour.  I chilled it 18hrs before serving. There were no cracks, and it didn't sink!  But, I think my pan wasn't sealed tightly enough, even with the tin foil to keep the water out, because it seemed to have leaked. The second time around, it turned out perfectly! I used 24 Oreo cookies, 1 TBSP sugar, and 1/4C butter, as suggested by others. I also wrapped the bottom of the pan with parchment paper, and placed it all in a plastic oven bag to keep all water out.  I baked it for 60 mins, and let it sit for 90 mins.  It all came out of the pan easily and cleanly!!

Not that this recipe needs another raving review but this cheesecake was amazingly good! But don't think too much about the caloric content...

Delicious!  I've made it with white chocolate and with dark chocolate, and the dark chocolate was fantastic.  Very moist, very rich and very popular with my guests.  I will be making this one again.

Excellent cheesecake.  I used seedless raspberry preserves.  I got some cracks, so next time I will use a water bath. I also used sour cream instead of half and half.  It was delicious. I made a graham cracker crust.

That recipe was SO delicious!  I made it for my boyfriend for vday and he LOVED it!  I will totally make it again- I cheated and used the raspberry jam as well, and it was just as good and so easy! Thanks for the recipe.

Very good. I used graham cracker crumbs instead on chocolate for a more traditional taste. I also dropped quarter size circles of sauce on top the cheesecake (pre-baking) and drew a toothpick through them to make hearts. I am going to make this for Valentine's day.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I have made this recipe a dozen or so times and it is wonderful and very impressive.  After reading others' comments, I wanted to make a suggestion to keep the cheesecake from browning:  I always cook mine in a water bath.  This gives me much better, more even results.  The only complaint I have with the water bath method is that one time the springform pan wasnt sealed good enough with the tinfoil I placed around it and the cheesecake was a soggy mess.  Also, I use a regular graham cracker crust instead because it is easier than separating the oreos.  I give it 5 stars for taste, but only rate it a 4 because it is expensive and tedious to make.

This was the first cheesecake that I ever made, and I just enjoyed it so much that I came back to rate/review it.  I doubled the sauce, which is such a good idea because its delicious and then it't not such a big deal to get all the sauce strained out from the seeds which is pretty tough.  My boyfriend's mom asked me for the recipe for this after she had it, and she thought it was a family recipe!!  Don't be intimidated by this recipe, I had no cheesecake experience and it worked for me!

I've changed some things around with this recipe, but it has always been a winner! First, I use a ready made crust (either chocolate or Oreo). Second, I use Splenda everywhere it calls for sugar (probably 1/2 as much as what is called for measurement-wise). Third, I use only 2 blocks of low-fat cream cheese. I've forgotten the vanilla more than once, but the recipe has never been the worse for it. I probably could substitute skim milk for the half and half, but haven't tried it yet. But! The  recipe is the first I ever tried when making my own cheesecake. I always have plenty of mix leftover, so I can usually make about 4 mini cheesecakes as well. A trick to keep all of it from cracking is keeping a pan of water in the oven as its baking. Also, as I have an electric range, I usually only keep it in the oven for about 40 minutes or so. 

My coworkers devoured it, and when I gave a cheesecake to my boyfriend and his mom for their birthdays (only a couple days apart), he only got one piece because she loved it so much! Thanks for this!

This cake is great and I get perfect results every time I make it.  I have substituted all kinds of berries for the raspberries,  I have left the sauce out of cake and poured it over individual servings and I have made it without the crust and simply lined the pan with parchment for an Aunt who can't have wheat gluten.

This was a wonderful cheesecake recipe. I had heard that the white chocolate enhances the taste of cheesecake and I am totally smitten by the taste. I only did one thing different and that was I substituted fresh frozen blueberries that I pureed and marbeled through instead of raspberries. I did make a regular graham cracker crust also but this was a wonderful cheesecake and I highly recommend it not only for taste but texture!

I made this for my in-laws and it was FABULOUS!  I used oreos for the crust, reduced-fat cream cheese, fat-free half and half, and made 1 1/2 times the amount of raspberry sauce.  I did have some cracking on top, but with the marbled effect, it was hardly noticable.  I also melted some semi-sweet chocolate chips with a little milk to make a drizzle for the top.  Everyone said the cake was better than the Cheesecake Factory!  My husband is requesting it for every special occasion now.

Wonderful, wonderful!  My daughter came home for her birthday, wanted raspberry cheesecake.  I searched and came up with this recipe.  We both loved it.  Not difficult to make at all.  I used less sugar in the raspberry sauce, since I like things a bit less sweet, excellent.  I took it to work the next day when she went back to school, since I didn't want to be alone in the house with it!!!  Would have eaten the rest in 10 minutes!  RAVED about at work.

I scaled the recipe slightly to prepare it in a 10" form.  I favored the white chocolate, because it seemed like it wasn't enough.  Well, even still, my guests said they couldn't taste any white chocolate -- but I got the subtle flavor.  I think had there been any more it wouldn't have set.  Overall, good recipe!

This is a very good cheesecake!  It was simple to make and the raspberry sauce is wonderful over the top!  I had to bake it about 30 minutes longer to set.  This is a must try cheesecake!

Absolutely gorgeous. By accident, and because I didn't read the instructions well
enough, added all the raspberry sauce to the cheesecake mix. It turned out to 
brilliantly, very enthusiastically recieved by all. I would recommend it to anyone.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars, although my first attempt at making did not produce a 5 star cheesecake.  I think that was due to my own inexperience in cheesecake making.  I believe I may have overcooked it, altering the texture and making cracks in the surface.  I served it with raspberry sauce and real whipped cream, just like in the restaurants!  I have high hopes for my next try with this recipe!

I followed the suggestions for the crust which was to up it to 2 cups and reduce sugar to 1 tbs.  I also made sure all ingredients were room temp lined the bottom of my springform pan with parchment paper and wrapped the outside with foil then baked in a water bath for one hour and left it in the oven with the door cracked and heat off for one hour then I put it in the fridge overnight.  BEST CHEESECAKE EVER!  I also blended the raspberries water and sugar BEFORE I cooked them and put them through the fine mesh strainer with my rubber spatula and got 99% of the seeds out. I am very glad I used frozen raspberries instead of the preserves because they were nice and tart which really complimented the cheesecake. I am already planning to make one of these for work and then another for a get together.  It is really delicious.

Delcious! First cheesecake attempt. It looked like and tasted like something from The Cheesecake Factory. I'm not much of a baker so this was impressive. Keys to success: I used a springform pan with a lip at the bottom so it sealed tightly (but tinfoil would also work); followed others' recommendations to place the pan in a water bath in the oven and also to turn off and open oven after cooking 60 min to cool one more hour in oven for no cracking. (Although if you top it like I did, you wouldn't see a crack anyway!) Last tip: It's not easy to find white chocolate bars for garnishing but kitchen supply stores like Sur La Table carry them. Use a peeler for quick and beautiful chocolate curls.

I have made this recipe many times. I have added and changed a few things over time. First, when using white chocolate chips, I use whipping cream and add a half to a full stick of butter when melting the chips in the whipping cream. There isn't enough fat in the white chocolate chips to make it have more body. I also have substituted 60% cacao chips for the white chips and eliminated the raspberry swirl (but you wouldn't have to!) The 60% cacao bakes up into a very dense cheesecake. Yum. You can even add espresso powder to the chips as you melt them (use half and half with the 60% cacao chips). I also make sure not to over beat the eggs into the batter...this is the enemy of cheesecake. The cake is more likely to crack if you over beat the eggs.  You can beat the heck out of it before the eggs go in.  Finally, cook it in a water bath (wrap the pan in heavy foil and make sure you heat up the water before you put the pan in it.  I just put the water bath in the oven when I am preheating. I use a foil roasting pan).  If it is cold out, let the cheesecake sit in the oven after it is finished. I open the door. Rapid cooling will also crack the top. The cheesecake can be a bit jiggly when you take it out of the oven, it doesn't have to look firm.  If it starts to lightly brown on the top, it is finished. I have done lots of variations using the basic recipe.

My whole family swoons over this cheesecake. I make it following the recipe for the filling exactly. I don't know why but chocolate cookie crusts have never appealed to me. So I used a food.com macadamia nut crust recipe at first that was delicious.  Then in 2013 I went wheat free and began substituting almond and coconut flours for the breadcrumbs and flour. Always delicious. I made it at Christmas and changed things up a bit by putting a layer of raspberry sauce on the bottom, then the plain filling. After baking and cooling I added another layer of raspberry sauce on top, went around the edges with fresh raspberries and filled in the center with finely shaved white chocolate that resembled snow on a raspberry lake. It was awesome! The raspberry filling on the bottom actually migrated up the sides of the cake while cooking and made this utterly delicious almost caramelized raspberry "crust" for the sides. I was afraid it would stick but it didn't. Will be using this method from now on just because of the way it looks. So other than a different crust and a different method of putting together the finished product it is the same recipe and am so thankful to the author for what has become my go to dessert for special occasions. Making it next week for my Mom's birthday.

I have made this recipe for several years now, it is always requested at Christmas gatherings. Everyone things I am some kind of cheesecake expert now!! Thanks for the recipe it's awesome. I follow the directions exactly as written. I always make sure my ingredients are at room temperature and I bake it in a pan of water. Don't over bake, it will crack.

OMG! Let me start by saying that I am NOT a baker. This was my FIRST time making anything from scratch! (To think I would start out with cupcakes or something...) I guess I wanted a real challenge. So, I took the advice from other reviews on using 2 cups of crushed Oreos (cream and all), 1/4 cup of melted bitter & 1 tablespoon of sugar. The crust came out PERFECT! (Make sure you put a flat pan or cookie sheet underneath the cake as you bake it. Butter may fall on to the oven and it can get a little messy). I took the cake to my job (them all surprised because they all know I don't cook or bake etc...) and the cake was gone within an HOUR! Everyone kept ranting about how good it tasted and almost everyone wanted the recipe!! I was SO pleased that everyone enjoyed the cake! I highly recommend this recipe! Now, (instead of showing up empty handed or eating everyone elses pastries) I can finally have something of my own to bring to any upcoming event and say "I made this from scratch!!"

This is delicious!  I've had this cake twice now, and the second time I took a lot of the reviewers' advice and used seedless raspberry preserves to save some time.  Although it was still good, it is MUCH BETTER when you follow the recipe and use frozen or fresh raspberries.  It doesn't take that much extra time and is very worth it, trust me!  Oreo cookies definitely work the best for the crust, so tasty and easy.  To bake the cake, I lined the bottom and the insides with parchment paper before pouring the batter in, and I wrapped the outside bottom of the springform pan with foil and the placed it in a large roaster, then filled it halfway up the top of the springform pan with boiling water and baked as directed.  I had no problem with my cheesecake cracking, it baked up beautifully and had a wonderful texture.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Beautiful and delicious cheesecake.  I prefer to use the chocolate crust recipe from the Fudge Truffle Cheesecake recipe (also found on this site).  I also double the amount of raspberry sauce I put in the middle of the batter, as we're raspberry fans.  This cheesecake is a real crowd pleaser!

I have made this a dozen times or so and it has turned out beautiful.  I'm working on perfecting my cheesecakes.  This one has gotten rave reviews by my guinea pigs :)  I did use fresh raspberries instead, and I added a bit of white chocolate flavoring and it turns out divine.  Best advice is bake at 425 for about 15 minutes then lower temp to 200 and bake for about an hour and half.  till the cheesecake is firm, but the middle jiggles just slightly.  should not look shiny or wet.  remove from oven the loosen the sides of the cheesecake with a thin non serrated knife and return to oven (heat off) and cool with door cracked for about 2 hours. be sure its completely cool before you put in the fridge.  :)

This cheesecake was awesomely delicious, it didn't even make it to the next day in my house!! There's actually a few people i'm making this for over the weekend, yay!  Ok, so here's the steps I did. I used oreo cookies as my base. I put them in my food processor without the cream filling and I used 2 cups of oreo cookies. I left the sugar and butter at the same measurements. Everything else I left the same. I wrapped around the bottom of my 9'' springform pan with aluminum foil and placed it in a water bath. Note, if you decide to use a water bath make sure to wrap the bottom really well or else water can leak into the pan. I'm sure a water bath isn't necessary but i've always done it based on what i've read in articles. I baked for an hour & half but every oven is different. I then turned off the oven and allowed to cool for about 30 minutes. After 30 mins, I allowed the cheesecake to continue cooling on the counter for a few hours before putting it in the fridge overnight. Thanks CindyAnn! Happy baking everyone ;)

I made this 2 times. The first time I made it I didn't have enough cream cheese, I only had 2 packets. It still came out amazing. I used blueberries from Dole instead, since raspberries are expensive! I used ready made pie crust which was the regular graham cracker crust. It came out so yummy. My family ate it in one sitting. I made it the second using the Oreo crust, frozen raspberries. It would have been great but I fell asleep and totally forgot about it. The bottom was burnt and the fact it was Oreo crust, my mom thought it was super burnt. But there is definitely a lot of work put into this. I definitely will make it a third time. :)

I always like to compare prices of ready made cheese cake and making it from scratch. I had to buy white chocolate about $3.00 and I used a little. Blueberries I bought the Dole fruit cup for $1.00. 3 packets of cream cheese $6.00 ($2.00 each). Half & Half for $1.50 The ready made pie crust $1.50. About $13.00. Ready made cheese cake range: $14.00-$25.00 If you want to save money it doesn't need 2 cups of white chocolate. 1 cup is good enough. Same goes with the package of raspberries. You don't need an ENTIRE package. Since it is only 6 tablespoons that you will need and it is just the raspberry sauce. Maybe a cup of raspberries. And instead of using 3 packages of cream cheese just use 2 packages. And if you want the white chocolate taste  use a good quality brand such as Baker's White Chocolate.

This is absolutely delicious! Perfect mix of traditional cheesecake flavor with a hint of white chocolate. This is the first cheesecake I have ever made and it came out great. I used graham crackers instead of chocolate chip cookies for the crust and Instead of just a little sauce in the cake for a swirl I put a good amount in which gave the cake a great pink color and a bit more of the berry flavor. I also used strawberries instead of raspberries. Next time I am going to use blueberries! Great easy tasty recipe!! thanks

This cheesecake is great!! Everyone loved it! It was so smooth and creamy.  I put reynolds wrap on the bottom and cooked it for an hour in a pan with a little water, I then turned the oven off and left it in the oven for another hour then put it in the fridge for about 4 hours.  It was wonderful and it did not crack!

I have made this twice in the last month.  My family begs me to make it.  My husband calls it restraunt quality.  The first time I used the seedless jam instead of making my own sauce.  The second time I made the sauce with frozen raspberries.  I will always make the sauce, it is far superior.  Thank you for the great recipe this is a new family favorite.

This was a HUGE hit, both at home and at work. My coworkers loved the "oreo cookie" touch. It takes some time and is very rich, but if you like rich cheesecakes, it is worth it. I used 2 c oreo cookies minus the cream, 1/2c butter and 4 tbsp sugar...I baked just the crust for 10 minutes at 350. Lowered temp to 325 for the cheesecake. Choclate: used stovetop, much easier that way. Syrup: Used seedless raspberry preserve. Creamcheese/sugar: used 1 tbsp cornstarch, it prevents cracks, and added vanilla beans to the sugar. Used a bain marie (waterbath, used greased wax paper at the bottom of the pan before putting the crust, makes removal easier. Greased sides liberally, prevents cracking. (Wrap bottm and sides in foil before putting it in the bain marie). Cake was done at 50 minutes. Let it sit in the oven for 3 hrs till both the oven and the cake cooled down, and then in the fridge overnight. It was delicious. Btw this was my first attempt at a cheesecake and it came out perfect after the steps above...no one at work believed that I had never baked a cheesecake before!

Absolutely wonderful. I used Ghiradelli white chocolate baking bar so I could make my own chocolate curls with a vegetable peeler. I made my own whipped cream with heavy whipping cream, vanilla, powdered sugar and stabilized it with unflavored gelatin (so it wouldn't "weep" and deflate). I lined a round glass Pyrex with parchment paper and baked with a water bath. Baked for 50 min then shut oven off and left it in the oven for another 45 min. I halved the recipe so baking times may be different for each person. 

What a wonderful special occasion dessert! Thanks for the recipe.

Absolutely divine! I am known for my homemade desserts, and this one did not disappoint.  I used seedless raspberry jam, warmed it a little so it would be easier swirl.  This is definitely going to be a regular with me!

It was beautiful and quite delicious!! I made it for a party and everybody absolutely loved it! I added a small amount of lemon juice (one small lemon) into the batter after I incorporated the eggs, which made it just perfect. I will definitely use this recipe again! Thanks for the AWESOME cheesecake!

This is to die for. With or without the raspberry sauce. I've used the white chocolate portion of this recipe to make a bunch of delicious cheesecakes. I highly recommend readying some articles or blogs on how to bake cheesecakes well. Practice and all of my research has served me well! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Great success with this cheesecake. The texture was very smooth and lovely. I used seedless raspberry preservatives (heated in microwave until smooth) and it was easy, but did not sacrifice taste at all! I would recommend that you make this cheesecake at least 1 day prior to the event you are brining it to. This is because the raspberry and white chocolate flavors truly blend to perfection during this time. Trust me on this. Also, when finished baking, turn off the oven and crack the oven door, leaving the cheesecake inside for at least 1 hour. This helps prevent sinking of the cheesecake. Also create a water bath for the cheesecake, and you will have perfection.

I never review due to time, however, this cheesecake was outstanding in ease, taste and presentation....To make this look gorgeous very easily I filled a baggie with seedless raspberry jam ( you could use chocolate), cut a tiny hole in the corner. I did circles or jam around cake kind of like rings on a tree. Then took a toothpick or knife and pulled at some of those lines. Draw the jam from middle to outter edge. I added the photo for you to see.

Great flavor, right down to the tasty cookie crust.  Thought the straining of the raspberries was more difficult than worth the taste in the end.  Next time, I will just make a raspberry sauce on the side and drizzle over it.  Other than that, super tasty and I will definitely be making it again!!

THE MOST DELICIOUS CHEESECAKE I HAVE EVER EATEN!!!!! i have never made a cheesecake before and this came out beyond incredible!!!! i couldn't stop staring at it's beauty (and neither could anyone else in my family)! i would have given this a perfect rating even if it didn't taste delicious just based on how beautiful the raspberry swirls looked  but wow was this delicious! better than any restaurant if you ask me.  I think it even tastes better over time (after a few days). i used a dark chocolate fudge cookie (keebler) for the crust (paired perfectly with the raspberry. other than that, i followed the instructions exactly.  and the raspberry sauce was a little too tart so the trick was to serve with just a tiny bit.  my brother doesn't even like dessert and he gobbled his up in half a second.  I'm making a second cheesecake tonight! so much fun to make and WOW soo delicious!

I did a quick and easy version of this for Easter this year.  I just bought a chocolate pie crust instead of making one.  I also used the seedless raspberry jam like previous reviewers.  There is less room in the pre-made pie crust so I also cut down on the cream cheese and eggs.   It turned out great using a water bath and letting it cool in the oven for about an hour after baking.

This cheesecake is amazing! I even got people who don't eat cheesecake to eat this cheesecake. Made it according to the directions and came out perfect. I forgot to wrap the pan in foil and put it on a baking sheet which the butter from the crust leaked out of the pan and sank to the bottom of my oven and made the oven a disaster which was my fault. But I will definitely be making this again without hesitation!

Oh Baby! I was in the mood for strawberries so substituted the fruit, but I doubt this recipe could ever be bad! LOVE the cheesecake, and the sauce really tops it perfectly. So very good.

Best cheesecake ever!! Amazing! Absolutely restaurant quality!! The only thing I changed was that I used heavy whipping cream instead of the half and half but only because I forgot to get some and heavy cream was what I had in the house.
Very good!

Who knew restaurant quality cheesecake was so simple to make!! What an amazing recipe! Totally worth the five stars it has received thus far. I used Oreo cookies as a base and put them in a blender, with the cream, to pulverize them. Then I just added one spoon of melted butter to the powder before pressing into the springform pan. Came out perfect! 
As I live in India where we don't get fresh berries, I used canned strawberries instead of raspberries and it still was so yum. An amazing hit of a recipe...well done!

This turned out amazing!!! My guests were over-top impressed and little did they know that it is super easy to make. I warn that if not a white chocolate fan then cut back on the chocolate. I followed the recipe to a T and it looked beautiful, however, I did bake it in a water bath with the recipe did not call for.

Absolutely fabulous!  Took recommendations from other reviews and used tart cherry preserves, crushed Oreos for the crust & melted the chocolate chips in the microwave.  I used the cheesecake bath method (from this website) and had no cracks at all, it looked beautiful.  A fairly simple process and it turned out amazing!  Thanks for the recipe.

Tasted great. I used strawberries instead and it worked fine. It wasn't very tall though and that disappointed me.

I made this for the first time today and it turned out AMAZING! It was a hit with my family! I used blueberries in place of the raspberries - doubled it and had lot's for drizzling.  I followed the cheesecake tips (tin foil wrapped pan and baking in cookie sheet pan with water). No cracks!

This is absolutely delicious.  I didn't have raspberries so I used strawberries and strawberry glaze for the filling.  I also used two premade graham cracker crust from the store because I didn't use a springform pan, fat free half and half, low fat cream cheese, and white chocolate bark and it turned out just fine.  When I baked them, I put them both on a large cookie sheet and poured water on the cookie sheet so they had their own little hot water bath.  It was simple and the cheesecake turned out so divine.  This was for my daughter's 21st birthday and she LOVED it.  The whole family wanted seconds!!!  I definitely will make it again!!!!

I used Oreos for the crust, 2 cups, 1/4 butter and 1 tbsp sugar. I followed the instructions on baking cheesecake here on Allrecipes, and wrapped the bottom of my pie pan in foil and put in on a cookie sheet with water so it would cook evenly in the oven. Came out perfect!! Will be making it again!

My husband said it was the best cheesecake I've ever made and that it looked so pretty too!  I made it for a co-worker for her birthday and it was a big it.  I did as others suggested and made a thicker crust (I used ready-made crushed graham crackers cause I was too lazy to crush my own chocolate cookies) and also doubled the raspberry sauce. Thanks for the recipe.  I will make again!

Great recipe and very easy to make. I have tried over and over not to have mine crack on the top, but have given up and learned to love the "cover it with decorations" trick. :) Next time I make this, I will put more of the sauce into my cake and keep less for the topping. I didn't think that the strawberry puree called for in the cake was enough to give it that strawberry taste in every bite.

I did this on my mother's birthday, and all our guests LOVED it! Let me say that i doubled the crust cause it wasn't enough. You may want to take it out of the oven 15-20 minuted after cause if it looks done it's over done. But, the taste was amazing.

I have made this twice and both times were good, but the second was even better. I made it using lowfat cream cheese and you would never notice. I used orea cookies, 2 cups and made a water bath for baking, then after it was done I cut the oven off and cracked the door about an inch then left it for two hours. Then I left in the fridge overnight.  It turned out perfect. It is just as good as any high end cheesecake and better because it does not have the 
$60 price tag. Thank you!

Delicious and rich!!  Doubled the crust and cooked in a larger springform.  I did cinnamon crust and omitted the raspberry mix because it looked rotten and gross.  I just added pie filling on top instead!  I wrapped the outside of the pan in 2 layers of foil and put it in a jelly roll pan with hot water.  Cooked for 60 min., then turned off the oven and left it for about 3 hrs. before chilling.  Don't overcook and don't overbeat the mixture or your eggs will seperate and leave a funny texture!

The texture on this cheesecake was really smooth; however, the amounts of white chocolate and raspberry almost canceled each other out so that there really wasn't much flavor at all other than the raspberry.

I used one reviewer's idea of seedless raspberry jam and I felt it worked excellent. The flavor of this is amazing. I usually make it every Christmas. I highly recommend the "Stiff Whipped Cream" recipe from this site to garnish the top with. It holds up and adds even more height and flavor richness.

I made this cheesecake for Valentine's Day.  It was fantastic and I will make again and again.  I used the microwave to melt chocolate and used raspberry preserves instead of frozen. Much less time and the taste was every bit deliciouse.

Pretty amazing recipe, don't plan to do it unless you have a lot of time as it is labor and time  intensive. I added a half capful of almond flavoring to my raspberries as I believe almond flavoring always accents raspberries. I served it for my sweetheart for the dessert for Valentines dinner following a seafood smorgasboard of shrimp over linguini in  homemade pesto sauce, mussells in garlic sauce and a tilapia stuffed with crab. Yummm

For someone who does not particularly enjoy the consistency of cheesecake, I found this recipe very delightful. I have no complaints, other than it seemed to run out very quickly due to everyone asking for seconds. The raspberry sauce can be a bit thick, so having a larger sieve may make the process go faster. Also, I had to increase the baking time by about 20 minutes before it seemed to be the right consistency expected from cheesecake. The chocolate cookie crust went very well with the cheesecake, but the recipe only calls for enough to cover the bottom of the 9 inch pan, so if you want the crust to span up the sides, about another half cup of cookie crumbs is needed. Overall, a great dessert to top off the evening (especially on Valentine's Day).

Honestly, I'm not a fan of cheesecake whatsoever, but my boyfriend loves it. Sooo I attempted this recipe for Valentines day just for him. My heart shape design turned out beautiful, and with one taste I'm impressed. I LOVED it. I served it with yummy blueberries, blackberries raspberries and extra sauce on the side. Highly recommend this recipe

A-MA-ZING!  My family loves cheesecake but I am always too afraid to try it.  So glad I gave this recipe a shot.  Super easy and definitely restaurant quality.  To simplify, I took other recommendations and used seedless raspberry jam, melted, and microwaved the white chocolate and half and half, stirring it every 30 seconds until melted.  So delicious.  Thank you for sharing...my family is going to have a happy valentine's dessert!

My hubby loved this cheesecake!!!!  I followed the directions to the "T".  The only thing I did differently was use strawberry preserves (the raspberry preserves at the market had seeds).  My cheesecake did crack, but who cares....it was delicious.  I will definitely make this again!!!!

Amazing! I made a couple changes: did a regular graham cracker crust because that's what I had on hand. Also, took the advice of another reviewer and used raspberry preserves as a shortcut. Otherwise, everything else was the same and this was outstanding!

I have made this at least 5 times and finally decided to write a review. This cheesecake is delicious! I usually make it for the holidays. Only changes I have made are to use 2 cups of Oreos and blend them in the blender with the cream and all. I use 1/4 cup of butter, though it would fine with less. I have baked it in a water bath and it comes out great without cracks and not burnt on the edges, but the inside was mushy. Perhaps it needed more cooking. Overall, great cheesecake.

WOW!  This was wonderful. Friends and family thought it was worth many oohs and ahs.  Thank you for sharing.  Update, after making this several times, I get requests for this now, even though I make it gluten free by baking my gluten free brownies in the pan first, underbaking by 5 minutes and smooshing it down when it comes out of the oven then pouring the filling over it as directed.  I use Clara's Brownies off of the Gluten Free Goddess site, which is awesome by the way.

This was awesome!  I used low-fat cream cheese and instead of making the raspberry sauce, I used my own raspberry jam I canned over the summer.  I also baked it in a water bath because that's how other cheesecakes are baked but it took about 75 minutes.  The cheesecake was very creamy and not overly sweet.  I will make this over and over I'm sure, it was a huge hit!

Great recipe!  Family loved it.  The only thing I would do next time is make the bottom choclate cookie layer double the size and also put it on the sides.  The white choclate mixed in makes a lot of difference as you don't just taste the cream cheese.

This is my all time favorite recipe on this site.  No changes needed!  I have made this into cupcakes before, dropping a hole Oreo cookie in the bottom as the crust.  Wow, was that good.

My husband made this and it was the Best Cheescake I've ever tasted.  Every party we go to people always ask him to make this.  It puts the Cheesecake Factory to shame!!

Brought this cake to work today.
It was delicious! It is very smooth in texture and tasted SO good! Absolutely loved it! Everyone did and it was gone very quickly.
I will definitely make it again!
I made it 2 nights before serving but decorated on the day. Made the Oreo crust as was recommended by some of the reviewers (I used the whole cookie - cream included). I also used two blocks  of white chocolate for baking (300g in total) instead of the chocolate chips. I made the sauce but ended using a preserve (a 70%, quite tangy raspberry jam) in the cake and served the sauce on the side. Did the whole marble thing - it came out looking great. I decorated it with some cream peaks around and fine oreo crumbs and white chocolate curls on top of them (so that the middle of the cake is uncovered and the marble can be seen).

This is incredible! I made this for a potluck and it was gone so fast! Mine didn't look quite as pretty as the picture for this recipe, but next time I make it I will focus more on the presentation. I got more compliments than I could count for this, and tons of requests for the recipe. I will definitely be making this cheesecake again, and again! (But only when I have people to share with, otherwise I would eat the whole thing!)

I just made this for a church wedding shower, as it is the bride's favorite dessert.  It was delicious and many ladies asked me for the recipe.  I made it exactly as the recipe says.  I would definitely make this again.

I made this for dessert for some friends that were coming over for dinner and then ended up sharing with coworkers and everyone loved it. I used Oreos for the crust and used raspberry all-fruit for the raspberry sauce. 

It didn't taste that white chocolate-y, but it was still delicious.

I also took the advice of some other reviewers and made it in a water bath and then cooling in the oven for a few hours post-baking. No cracks here!

Loved it!

This recipe is very good and got rave reviews from everyone at my holiday gatherings that I have made it for (multiple gatherings), but for me the chocolate crust overpowered the white chocolate flavor of the filling.  One of these times I will use a traditional graham cracker crust.

What a beautiful cheesecake this turned out to be. I agree with other reviewers though; it should definitely be in a water bath for baking. The sides cracked on me and I should have gone with my initial instinct of the water bath. 

Next time with my adjustments, I am sure it will be even more fantastic.

Time consuming, but worth it! I followed other user's instructions and used the raspberry jam, microwaved it, and added only half the sugar (since the jam had sugars in it). Worked perfectly and you cut out the sauce making time!

Another corner worth cutting was instead of the double-broil, I microwaved the white chocolate and the half-and-half. Worked like a charm! 

Excellent recipe. Within ten minutes of plating this dish in front of a family gathering, the dessert was gone!

This was a huge hit for Father's Day!  The white chocolate is sooo good!  Made a couple small changes.  I couldn't find chocolate cookie crumbs, so I used graham cracker crumbs and it was quite good.  Also ended up needing to bake it for nearly 2 hours for the center to set.  I think I will try to use a water bath next time.  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing :)

Fantastic!!! I used the vanilla oreo cookies instead for the crust and it was so good. I used around 20 crushed with around 2 tbsp of melted butter and it made the perfect crust. Will definitely make this recipe again, thanks!

Fabulous!  Delicious and easy to make though there are many steps and you have to budget enough time for the cheesecake to chill.  It seems fairly idiot-proof.  Made it for a birthday party and everyone was raving about it.  Will definitely make again!

Wow. The best cheesecake I have made to date. I used fresh raspberries for the syrup and it was amazing. Very pretty and professional looking (and delicious) cheesecake. Will be making this one every year for Christmas. Thank you!

The family loved this - I used raspberry jam, heated for approx 15 seconds, versus making the raspberry sauce.  (Sorry - I needed a quicker fix for the raspberry - no time to make the sauce.)  We really enjoyed this recipe.  Other than that, I doubled the crust in order for it to be a thicker crust.  Otherwise, left the recipe unchanged.  Will make this again. :)

This cheesecake recipe was amazing! I follewed everything in the original recipe above only thing I would change is double batching the raspberry sauce for more filling in the cheesecake and more topping use! :-) also very important lots of success for not cracking this cheesecake went to the helpful tips on hoe to bake a cheesecake allrecipes.com!! After you read the instructions you may find it silly process do do but believe me it worked with the extra love!!!

This was my first experience making a cheesecake.  And it turned out wonderful, despite a couple of mistakes!  I doubled the crust and the raspberries as some had suggested, but wasn't paying attention and accidentally added ALL of the raspberry sauce into the cheesecake...but it still tastes yummy!

I am giving it a 3 star because some people at my party enjoyed this.  I followed the recipe exactly, but the filling was too loose, the middle was  not cooked enough so it was creamy.  I had to cook it longer than stated because I could tell it wasn't done, but then the top started separating where the rasberry sauce was swirled in.  Would not make again.

I doubled the crust and used Simply Fruit Raspberries.  We loved it.  Next time I'll add more raspberries.  Went together quite easily.  I did a water bath and let it cool in the oven but it still cracked.

Good cheesecake.  Not alot of raspberry flavor in the cake. Helped to have it on the top.  Did use the "all fruit" spread instead of doing the frozen raspberries maybe that was the problem.  But still had a good raspberry taste...did not taste like jelly.  Don't make a lot of cheesecakes but would make this one again if I needed one.  Used a shallow water bath and cake did not crack.  Could probably use this basic recipe for other flavors too (such as blueberry and strawberry).

Took this to our Easter celebration as one of out dessert options. Half the family likes cheescake and they loved this. The other half don't like cheesecake, and they thought this was the best cheesecake they had ever had. This recipe ROCKS!!!

Been making this for years, it's a simple enough (if time consuming) recipe that always impresses.  As everyone else says make sure to read the cheesecake guide on this site to make sure your cake doesn't crack!

Cake came out fine out of the oven - not hard to make as far as cheesecakes go.  It was good.. but I wasn't wowed for some reason.  Cookie crust overpowered the cheesecake, at least for me.  And I really couldn't tell there was white chocolate in the mix.  Tasted like regular old cheescake.  

If I make this again, I will probably use regular old graham cracker crust.

My first attempt at making a cheesecake! I used the jam method in stead of making up the raspberries, as mentioned in another review, but even though the jam was warm it didn't seem to swirl very elegantly. Mine also had cracks, but in the end, the cake was delicious. I just dumped raspberries in the center and it looked fine - and tasted divine!

This was a lovey addition to our potluck dessert table - many compliments received! I added some creme de cacao to the cheesecake batter, baked it in a water bath, and left it in the oven for an extra hour after shutting off the heat - not even the slightest crack, and the marbled raspberry sauce looked very impressive! Will make this again - my father isn't a white chocolate fan, so thought I might try the same recipe, but with a bag of milk chocolate chips instead.

DELISH!!! The hardest part is getting the seeds out of the raspberry mixture other than that this was a piece of cake. Very tasty! Thanks!

YUMMO!!! I have had to forward this recipe to at least 4 of the guests at my dinner party last night! I doubled the base so it was nice and thick. I also used frozen mixed berries and did not strain them as I wanted a few lumps and everyone loved it! Will totally be making this again!

This recipe is fantastic! I made it easier by using seedless raspberry preserves and melting it instead of making it. To make the presentation nicer, I use the raspberry preserves to line the top and give it a nice red cover instead of marbling it. Then I line the outer rim with a line of fresh raspberries and then an  inner lining of white chocolate morsels. I am not a cook but it makes me look like one!

Fantastic! The most time consuming part was making the raspberry sauce, I might use jam next time to see if it's worth the extra effort, although given the end result I would gladly do it again. Like suggested, I doubled the Oreo crust, I might 1 1/2 it next time, I also used slightly more white chocolate, as there were only a few chips left in the bag after measuring it out-I melted the chips in the microwave instead of using a double boiler. Will definitely make again

This is the Best Cheescake.  I made it for my husband to take to work and he said it was gone instantly. His coworkers loved it and thought it came from a bakery. I made another one so I could have some and it's truly Delicious.  Thanks for posting such a great recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly but made it in a regular pan instead of springform.  It was amazing.  And I have since started adding white chocolate chips and cream to all my cheescakes.
This cheescake is heavenly.

LOVE this! I made it for my hubby when he came back from a trip. Perfect thing to welcome him home. I took the advice from others and used crushed oreos (cream and all) and less sugar for the crust. It was perfect! Amazing recipe!

I have had so many positive reviews for this cheesecake. It's my favorite flavor & this recipe gives the cheesecake factory a real run for its money. I nix the chocolate cookie crumble bottom though. cheesecake is pain enough to make & this cake is delicious on its own!

This cheesecake was nothing short of perfection! It is a very decadent, rich cheesecake with amazing flavor. I did utilize the tips on this site and from other reviewers. I used a pan filled with water underneath the cake while it baked, and let it cool in the oven completely before removing. I've made dozens of cheesecakes, but this has been my favorite by far. I made this for a birthday and it was absolutely beautiful and delicious! I intend to use the base recipe for all of my future cheesecakes and modifying it with different flavors. I'd recommend this to anyone wanting a rich, impressive dessert! Thanks for sharing.

This cheecake is wonderful! I have friends and coworkers ask me to make them this all the time. I'm actually going to start on one right now. The only thing I do different is bake it in a water bath for 1 1/2 hours. Turns out perfect every time!

This Cheesecake was amazing! I served it at my annual anti-valetines day dinner. Even the guests who claim to not like sweets were in love with it! I used fresh raspberries and de-seeded as suggested by others and topped with only fresh raspberries, a touch of whipped cream, and the extra raspberry sauce! Next time I plan to make it with blackberries!

Delicious! I used extra oreo cookies to make a little thicker crust. Also, I used the ideas of others to place a muffin pan with water on the shelf below the cheescake and also covered the cheescake pan with the oven turkey bag to prevent leaking from the water tray it sits in. Not sure if all of the extra precautions were necessary, but the cheesecake came out perfectly! No dryness or cracking. I let it cool for about an hour also before refrigerating. Served it at a birthday party and there were NO leftovers!!!

LOVE THIS CHEESECAKE! and everyone else does too!  I will be making this cheesecake very often, I've already gotten requests.  One thing I will do next time is make more of the raspberry sauce because it went fast.

i made this for my friend as a trial and it was a big hit! easy to make and the rest is just patience while the creamy goodness bakes.i already have orders to make more for dinner parties. oh, btw, water bath is a must, and everything must be room temperature and do not overbeat the cream cheese.

Yummy! I used the recommendation to put the cheesecake in the center of a jellypan with water and it turned out amazing. I'd watch the time though- my could have came out earlier.

I just made this for the first time and it turned out beautifully!  I wrapped the outside of the pan with 3 layers of heavy aluminum foil and placed it in a roaster pan with about an inch of water.  I preheated the oven to 350 and then dropped it down to 250 when I put the cheesecake in the over.  I baked for 1 and 1/2 hours then turned the oven off and kept the cheesecake in there for 3 hours.  NO CRACKS!  
Thanks for all the wonderful tips on this website!
I used raspberry jam and just melted it in the microwave and swirled it on tip!  There's even enough left over to drip on all the slices of cheesecake!  I'm in love....!!!!!

As everyone has said, this is phenomenal! I have a few baking tips. If you bake in a water bath, which helps prevent cracking, you'll probably need to cook this longer than an hour, closer to 1 1/2 hours. If you have a food thermometer, get it to about 150 degrees so just the middle is still wobbly. It will continue cooking. You can leave it in the oven and turn it off- leave it for 1 hour. The wrap and chill.

Sooooo good!!!!! I think I will double the oreo cookies next time from reading some of the reviews because 1 cup just didn't give it very much of a crust. Such a wonderful recipe I will for sure make this again! :)

I work in a restaurant, and I made this cheesecake to sell there last week. Everyone loved it, and it went very fast! It's a classic, and this will be the flavor I'll make sure we always have on hand, as it was a favorite.

Just a suggestion, and its totally optional, instead of using the frozen strawberries, you can use a raspberry wine, or any other fruit wine for that matter depending on how you would like it to turn out. My grandparents make a  Raspberry in Grape wine, and when we use that as a glaze, its literally to die for!!! (coincidentally the vineyard/winery is located in MD, where the recipe is from) Definitely something i would try! Or the Blueberry!!!

This was the first cheesecake I had ever made.  I was heartbroken when it fell a little and cracked.  I borrowed a springform pan after I googled what it was.  It leaked, which is why it looked the way it did.  The next day I made more rasberry sauce (I oopsed by putting it all in the batter).  It still looked beautiful because of the topping.  One person said he would marry me if I wasn't already married.  Everyone loved it!  The picture does include fresh raspberries to garnish but the ingredients don't include them so so be sure to add them to your list.  Thank you for sharing!

I didn't expect this to be SO good... this is my new cheesecake go-to, for sure.  The texture was amazing w/the white chocolate chips mixed in.  I topped it with fresh raspberries, shaved white Godiva chocolate, and some whipped cream on the side.  Very pretty and DE-lish!

WOW!  A huge hit at the New Year party we attended.   The only change I will do for next time is double the raspberry sauce.  I would have liked to have extra to drizzle over the top when serving. EVERY BIT AS GOOD as the $7.95 Cheesecake Factory piece I had earlier in the week!!!

Edit: I made a second one, and it came out perfect after making changes. I baked the crust for 6 minutes at 350, using two cups of crumbs and two tablespoons of butter. After beating together the cream cheese and sugar, i mixed everything else by hand. That way you don't over beat. I didnt put any raspberry on top for marbling, because after it was baked and cooled i spread some over the entire cheesecake, then garnished with fresh raspberries and white chocolate shavings.   I heated the oven to 350, then turned it down to 285 as soon as i put in the cheesecake. I used a water bath... Baked it for a little over an hour, let it cool in the oven for a couple hours (opening for a minute to let some heat escape) then let it cool to room temp on the counter before refrigerating for about 8 hours.  it came out a lovely shade of off white, with no browning or sinking whatsoever. i got a few small bubbles on the top, but they were easily covered by the raspberry preserves (which i strained to remove seeds.) i would strongly recommend reading all of the articles on this site about how to get the perfect cheesecake, because it was extremely helpful for me.

I followed the receipe exactly and it turned out fantastic!  Everyone loved it.  Cooking the raspberry's was a bit time consuming but well worth the effort.  I defrosted a frozen bag of raspberries and what I didn't cook I put on top of each slice of cheesecake when serving.  I also used Kraft Philadelphia light cream cheese to reduce the fat- but you wouldn't know it.  I will definately make this again!

I have made this many times and it is perfect each time!  Thanks for the delicious recipe!  The only change I make to make it easier is I use warmed seedless raspberry jam.  I also switch it up and use almond extract vs. vanilla on occasion.

I have made this recipe twice now and it came out perfect! The key is to use a water bath and when done, shut the oven off, open the oven door slightly and let the cheesecake cool in the oven (with the door open) for at least one hour. Delicious!

The first time I made this cheesecake, I brought it to my family's house for a meal.  Ever since then, the first thing they ask me when I walk in the door is if I brought "one of those cheesecakes!?"  This cheesecake is WONDERFUL!

Have made this many times and each time it is exceptional! Everyone raves about it. I make double the raspberry sauce as it is always a hit, too. I use melted Hershey dark chocolate chips and they work well, too. I highly recommend this recipe!

Fabulous recipe!  Made this for a holiday party and everyone loved it.  Cream cheese mixture had me worried - after I added the melted white choocolate, it was very soupy.  It was not as high as other cheesecakes I have made but it was fine.  I baked it in a water bath for 1 1/2 hours.  Initial temp 350 and immediately dropped to 250 when I put the cheesecake in the oven.  No cracks, rich and creamy....will definitely make again.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

This got rave reviews from all who tried it!  The only thing I changed was that I made a graham cracker crust as opposed to a chocolate one.  Everything else I did exactly as the recipe stated; other than a crack along the top (Cheesecakes can be so tempermental), it turned out beautifully and delicious.  Thanks for sharing the wonderful recipe!

Beautiful!!!  Delicious!!!  Not much more can be said about this with so many positive reviews.  It is time consuming - usually cheesecakes are pretty easy to prepare, but this one has a few more steps, so it does take longer.  Definitely make your own raspberry sauce - don't use jam.  I followed the instructions exactly and was not disappointed.

This recipe a little time consuming, but totally worth it.  Once while making this, I accidently poured the entire raspberry mixture over the first layer of cheesecake and didn't end up swirling it.  It turned out just as good.  I usually serve with fresh raspberries or chocolate shavings.  Hands down the best cheesecake I've ever had!!

This cake is absolutely amazing! It is extremely rich and decadent so a small slice is more than enough. Normally, I hate both white chocolate and raspberries but this cheesecake makes them both work for me! Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

It was my first time making a cheesecake, but this came out very good. The only thing I did different was use fresh raspberries, blendered it, strained it, then thickened it on the stove top. I also baked it in water, like some of the reviewers suggested. No cracks, didnt stick to the pan, didnt sink in the bottom. everyone loved it.

The best cheesecake I've ever made!  I made it for my sister's 23rd birthday.  I followed other reviewer's advice, I used raspberry perserves, and strained it after microwaving it.  I wrapped the pan in foil and put it on a cookie sheet and added some water before baking.  After baking, I let the cake rest in the warm oven for an hour before taking it out.  There were no cracks!!!  Absolutely, worth the effort!  Delicious and creamy!

This was just okay to me. Unfortunately all I could really taste was the white chocolate. Also I think the chocolate made the texture totally different than what I like in a cheesecake.  It set up fine and looked beautiful but was more custard-like texture and less creamy. I've made my share of cheesecake    I also listened to reviewers here who suggested raspberry preserves(which I used)  and this just didn't take the place of the

my first time to make cheesecake and i'd definitely use this same recipe again.    very easy to make. just like what the others advised, i blended the raspberries with sugar in a food processor and strained it. it's the only step i spent lots of time on.    dumped the oreos (with the fillings) in the food processor, added melted butter, omitted sugar.    nuked the white chocolate chips and milk.     the texture of the cheesecake was smooth.    the sweetness of the cheesecake itself was balanced by the bittersweet flavor of the crust and the sourness of the sauce.     everyone loved it!

This was a great success. I made this for my husband for our anniversary and he loved it! He is already asking for more. Very easy to make, lots of steps but all fairly simple. This didn't last more than a day at my house!!

I have never made a cheesecake previosly this was my first time and it was very simple to make and turned out wonderful. I used a couple variations other reviews said to do like crushed Oreo's for the crust and Raspberry preserves for the swirls. It made it a lot easier to make. The problem I had was where the raspberry swirls were on top it made cracks but, I covered the top with cool-whip and raspberries and it looked great.

This is my go to cheesecake when I want to impress. I even used this as one of 5 cheesecakes I made for a wedding. It gets rave reviews every single time. Even from someone who isn't really a fan of white chocolate.   I use about 6oz of raspberry preserves instead of making the sauce. I always wrap my springform pans in foil just in case and put a small pan of water in the oven when baking. I don't put the cheesecake in the water pan, just put the pan of water on the shelf below.   Make this cheesecake. You won't be disappointed!

Absolutely delicious!!  This is always gone in minutes when we take it to gatherings.  We have tried it following the recipe and using jam, both are good.  If you are crunched for time, seedless raspberry jam is a good option, but the recipe's raspberry swirl wins by a small margin at our house.

This was the very first cheesecake I have ever made and it turned out perfectly!  It tasted fabulous!!!  I didn't have the metal strainer for the seeds from the raspberries, so I just included them and it wasn't a problem at all.  I also followed other people's suggestions to wrap aluminum foil around the bottom of the springform pan, and then place it on a baking pan that has some water in it to prevent cracking.  Finally, I allowed it to cool for one hour before removing it from the oven.  I will be making this again soon, it was a big hit with my family.

Absolutely amazing cheesecake- it’s better than most cheesecakes you find in restaurants!  My family now requires I make this cake at every social event/holiday.  I use a 1C graham cracker crust in place of the cookie crumbs so the crust has a more traditional cheesecake flavor and does not turn out too sweet.  Also, instead of making the raspberry sauce and use 6 tbsp of seed-free strawberry jam heated in the microwave until sauce consistency (30-45 sec) instead. I prefer the flavor of the strawberry jam plus there are no seeds to get in the way of the otherwise smooth consistency.  Finally, as other reviews have suggested, make sure to cover the bottom of the spring-form pan in foil and cook the cheesecake in a water bath (see the how-to on the website).  After cooking, cool the cheesecake in the oven before placing in the refrigerator.  Make sure to remove the foil before placing in the fridge.  Otherwise water collected between the foil and the spring-form pan may seep into the crust and make it soggy.

My husband loves cheesecake and white chocolate so for his birthday he requested a white chocolate cheesecake. After searching, I found this recipe. This is an amazing cheesecake. My husband LOVED it and said it was the best cheesecake he had ever had. Definitely a keeper, but extremely rich.

Best cheesecake ever. This is the recipe I always use, and everyone that tries it loves it. It is honestly the favorite of anyone who has tried it. I use various crusts and berries. The white chocolate really gives it a great flavour. My boyfriend bugs me to make it all of the time, and swears he could eat the whole thing at once (And he loves to lick the sauce off of the plate after). My mother also confided that she loves it more than my sister's cheesecake. Especially because I made a bumbleberry flavoured one. Honestly the best cheesecake you could make, no questions.

This was my first attempt at a cheesecake and it turned out great. I gave it a "test run" at the office, looking for suggestions before the event I was making it for - and received nothing but complements. Oreos made a great crust.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated except I used graham cracker crumbs for the crust.  I did not use a water bath, just left it in the oven for an hour afterwards to cool down - no cracks!  Delicious cheesecake, will definitely make again.

I love cheesecake. Have always been reluctant to make one, fearing it would come out horribly. But for a mothers day surprise I made one for my mother who also loves cheesecake. It came out amazing. I used semi sweet chocolate because I hate white chocolate and don't consider it real chocolate. It was so yummy, and creamy, and it was just amazing. My mom is my number one fan and she was so thrilled I not only made her her favorite dessert but let her be the first to try my first cheesecake. And thank you all for your helpful tips with baking. Definitely wrap your pan in foil and place on a cookie sheet with water. And after an hour of baking I turned the oven off and let the cheesecake sit in the oven as they both cooled. No cracks, and no over baking. Thank you for this easy and amazing recipe :)

This cheesecake tasted very similar to a popular chain restaurant's but was even better because I knew precisely what was going into it! I used another reviewer's suggestion to use jam rather than cooking down the raspberries, and while it tasted great, the jam turned a sickly brownish color while it was baking. Not sure if the fresh raspberries cooked down would have done this or not. At any rate, even the hard core dieters in our family cleaned their plates, which is really saying something. I followed the suggestions for perfect cheesecake given by another reviewer, ie; wrap pan in foil, place in baking tray with water, leave oven cracked for one hour after cooking and turning off. It was the first time I've ever made a cheesecake and it didn't crack. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

I made this cheesecake and brought the leftovers to work the next day.  It was so good that one of my co-workers offered me $30 to make one for him!  Of course I'm going to do it.  It was easy to make and beautiful on the plate.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the ultimate cheesecake recipe!!!  I have made this over 10 times, and each time it is a hit!  There is no need for any alterations.  Just don't forget to use the water bath method while baking, and let the cheesecake cool in the oven with the door open for an hour before removing.

DELICIOUS!!! This is the best dessert I've ever made! I had extra rasberry puree and used it to drizzle over the top and when I plated the slices for serving. This recipe is a keeper!

TEN STARS for this recipe from heaven!!!  I did use jam and used crushed up Oreo's.  I lined the bottom on a 10 inch springform with parchment paper then wrapped foil on the outside to prevent leaking.  Set the cake on a baking sheet and fill with water.  After baking, shut off the oven, open the door and let it sit to cool for one hour.  I drizzled chocolate sauce over each slice, added fresh raspberries then topped with shaved white chocolate.  Thanks CindyAnn!

Way, way, way too sweet.  I surfed to find a tried and true cheesecake recipe and followed the recipe to a "t".  I was embarrassed to take this over to some friends for dinner because everyone only ate a couple bites, then tried to be polite about it being too rich.  Also- it didn't have a true cheesecake flavor- overpowering white chocolate.  I guess that's good if you don't like cheesecake much.  I would caution you if you don't like super sweet desserts.

My first time making a baked cheesecake. i usually do the no-bake kind, so i was scared at how runny the "batter" was, but it came out just fine. I also made it with the raspberry seedless preserves and did the water bath under it. No cracks! And I used chocolate graham crackers b/c i'm used to a grahamcracker crust with my no-bake ones. Thank you soooo much for the recipe!!!

Love it!  Def taste the ras sauce because I needed to add more sugar.  Mild ras flavor, if want more would add ras sauce to the cheesecake.  I had a bowl of water in the oven too.  I cooked the recommended time and it was very slightly over cooked and cracked slightly on top.  Next time will cook 5-10 min less.  Husband can't wait until I make again!

Came out perfect.  Never made a cheesecake before but I'm known for some pretty good cakes so my boss asked if I'd make a cheesecake.  No pressure.  I only turn to allrecipes.com for recipes.  Techniques to follow: do not over beat, leave in oven for at least an hour with door open and oven off after cooking, I left mine in for another 3 hours since I went out, bake in water bath (be sure your water is boiled water) put cheesecake pan in turkey bag plus wrap in tin foil to ensure no water leakage into crust from water bath.  Turkey bag and tinfoil just to cover bottom and at least half way up pan.  Roll extra bag down so as to not cover top of cake.  Enjoy.....

This recipe is so amazing.  I baked this for my sweetheart on Valentine's day and it came out absolutely scrumptious.  My boyfriend is a trained chef and when he tasted it, he just smiled and said, "This is so light and wonderful, better than the restaurant kind... bravo sweetie!"  I went with the suggestion of using raspberry preserves instead of frozen berries, (because the store didn't have any!), wonderful... I am a diabetic so I used the sugar free raspberry preserves. Perfect!! I also, mistakenly bought heavy whipping cream instead of half and half.  I think this added to the lightness of the cake.  So yummy and not overly rich.  I am going to make this again, but because I am diabetic, I am going to use sugar free chocolate cookies for the crust next time.  Oh by the way... I didn't put any sugar in the crust this last time and I used the oreo cookies and it was plenty sweet.  Thank you for this recipe, CindyAnn.  It made my first time ever cheesecake a wonderful success!!!

I baked this cheesecake for Valentine's Day. The only thing I changed was the crust. I increased the ingredients by 50%, simply because I prefer a little more crust to my cheesecake. The cheesecake came out fabulous, my guests raved about it. I took the time to make the raspberry sauce and was so very glad I did! I used the leftover sauce to decorate the plates. I highly recommend this recipe!

I just made this last night for Valentine's Day for hubby.  Hubby has high blood sugar so I decided to change things a little bit so I won't feel so guilty giving him this cake!  I used 1 pack (6.5 oz.)Murray Sugar Free Chocolate Sandwich Cookies with 1 teaspoon sweet and low and 1/4 cup of melted butter for crust; for Raspberry sauce, I used Polaner Sugar Free Seedless Raspberry Preserves; I used 1/4 cup Splenda Sugar Blend for baking in the Cream Cheese instead of the 1/2 cup white sugar... the result?  EXCELLENT!!!  Hubby and I both LOVE it!!!  Hubby said it was so delicious he would not change a thing about it!!!

Loved it Loved it Loved it- This was my first time ever making cheesecake, and i made this for my moms birthday and she had a bunch of people over, and everyone of them said it was the best cheesecake they have ever had!  I did do a sponge bath technique, and even after much careful covering etc. it still soaked through (of course i was using an old spring form pan-kinda crappy). However the crust remained in desirable condition, and came off the bottom rather easy. For the crust i used vanilla wafers, and some graham crackers (2 cups) filled the bottom perfect! Also i blended raspberry's with water first then strained the seeds -(much easier!) Let cook for 1 hour, then left in the oven to cool- with door slightly open, until room temperature, then i refrigerated. NO CRACKS at all! I greased the whole pan with Crisco, and it came out well. OH and make sure to taste the sauce before you put it in the cheesecake, mine was waay too tart, so i added more sugar to even it out (but don't forget about the sweetness of the white chocolate to counter act it!).

AMAZING!! This was my cheesecake first cheesecake. I followed other users advice about letting it cool in the oven for an hour after baking. This prevents cracks in the cheesecake. Turned out perfect...will definietely make again!!

Not a Cheesecake fan but made for a party. Modified recipe: 2 cups of Oreo cookie crumbs, omitted sugar, replaced fresh raspberries with seedless raspberry jam, used semi-sweet chocolate chips and heavy whipping cream (since that's what I had). Topped with shredded coconut, blackberries and strawberries. Nice presentation and tasted like cheesecake!

I did a test run of this cake first and i'm glad i did because it looked terrible. although I made it in my crappy "college appartment grade" oven which is terrible. Also among other mistakes (over beating, starting out with cold ingredients, not putting enough water in the water bath...) Then I made it again and it came out AMAZING!!! fixing all my errors and baking in my mothers stove. tips: Use an oreo cookie crust mentioned in a previous review, beat cream cheese and sugar toegther but fold in eggs, vanilla, and white chocolate to incorporate, wrap springform pan in tinfoil and bake in 1/2"-1" waterbath. I made it for my boyfriends family's xmas party and everyone wanted seconds. it turned out fabulous!!!

This is a great recipie! I made mini ones using mini baking papers. I pressed a bit of the crust into each one and then added the filling. I put some seedless raspberry jam in a ziplock bag and cut off the corner to pipe it into each one and then swirled it with a toothpick. They were delicious! I had to reduce the baking time a bit, I just kept an eye on them.

I made this yesterday for sunday dinner. I really wanted this to be a hit, especially that white chocolate is one of my brother's favorite flavours. I have made many cheesecakes before, and know how to make it quite well. I have a really good cheesecake recipe that never fails me, and this one was nowhere near as good. People had a hard time finishing their slice, and all said that it was wayyy too rich, sweet and cheesy. It did look good though! I don't understand how it got all those rave reviews! Maybe people have lower standards than my family? I don't know, but I will not make it again. Thanks for sharing though!

Great recipe! Very filling. My first time making a cheesecake and first time using a springform pan. I had alot of leaking and it dripped over the bottom of my oven, (smoked out my kitchen) I just couldn't find something big enough to put a 9inch pan in. I decorated it with extra raspberry filling, fresh aspberries and white chocolate shavings.

Outstanding!  I've made it twice and had to bake it much longer, but that's ok.  Highly recommend doing a little study on making cheesecakes (tips like letting it cool in the oven without opening the door, etc).  Anyway, this is an AMAZING recipe and is requested every Christmas!!!  Definitely worth the effort!

Fantastic!  Will definitely be making again! Unfortunately, even with a pan of water underneath, the top still cracked, so I served in small squares. They were still a huge hit, but I will work on my presentation next time! Thank you!

I was very nerous this being my first time making a real cheesecake.  I read all the tips and it came out perfect. No cracks, perfectly cooked and oh so yummy.  I will make this forever.  Double the crust, but think it would have been 1 1/2 cups of oreo not 2.

I would love to give it 4 1/2 stars. It tasted fantastic!!! My only complaint was that it started to melt and get gooey too quickly, hey  I live in CA ;) Keep it in the fridge until just before serving.  YUM, YUM, YUM!!!

WOW! This was absolutely delicious! I made it to take to my husband's family Thanksgiving dinner and it didn't last long at all...everyone raved about how good it both looked and tasted, and were amazed that it was homemade. I have now decided that I will also take it to my family's Christmas dinner, since there are many cheesecake lovers there too! Thank you for a recipe that will be added to my "Favorite Recipes" collection, and made over and over again!

This is such a delicious cheesecake!  I made it for an early family Christmas get-together and it was a huge hit!    I followed the recipe exactly except for the folowing:  -Made more of the raspberry sauce -Put in a little extra cookie crumbles for the crust -Put it in a water bath while it baked -Let it cool for 1 hour before putting it in the fridge  With that being said, I had no cracks, and it turned out perfectly.  I wouldn't consider myself an expert cook by any means - this cheesecake was so easy to make.  Everybody loved it - I would recommend this to anyone, and is a perfect dessert to bring to a potluck or family/friend get-together.

This cheesecake comes out ugly and cracks all over the placeif you follow this recipe, I should have read the reviews and bake this in a cookie sheet water bath. I would try again and post my review. Do not follow this recipe as stated, it yields dissapointing results!!!

This cheesecake is amazing! I get compliments on it all the time. The only thing I do differently is when I make the raspberry sauce. I took the suggestion of first blending the raspberries in a blender with water and then straining them prior to adding the sugar and cornstarch and cooking it in a pan. Works out really well this way and removes all the seeds before cooking. I also usually double the raspberry sauce becuase everyone loves it so much!

This being my first attempt at cheesecake, I took my time and made it carefully and confidently. As a first time cheesecake baker, I am proud to say that my taste testers have already given me an "expert" rating!! :) My best advice is to have a lot of patience not only while making this cheesecake, but any cheesecake. If it says prep time is an hour... then let it be an hour! Take your time and treat cheesecake like silk! I read a lot that the way you beat the batter will determine it's texture and whether or not it bubbles. I let my cream cheese set at room temperature for about 2-3 hours beforehand. Then while mixing the batter, I used my clean hands to first kneed in most of the add-ins instead of a mixer (I never use mixers anyway). I followed EXACT temperature and baking time directions. I also covered the bottom portion of my spring pan with alluminum foil, as well as placing the spring pan on a cookie pan filled with water as the cake was baking (I don't know what this does, but I read it as advice somewhere).  Also, after baking it for 60 minutes, I simply turned off the oven and never opened the oven until at least an HOUR after I turned it off. Overall, I was extremely proud of myself with this cake. I'm definitely making it again.

I just served this cheesecake for Thanksgiving dinner and it was fabulous - my two boys and husband absolutely loved it.  I crushed 2 cups of the Oreo Double Stuff cookies (including the cream inside) with 2 T sugar and 1/4 C butter to make the base.  I also used seedless raspberry preserves and nuked the white chocolate and 1/2 and /12 with no problems.  I wrapped a double layer of foil on the bottom of the pan, placed it inside a rimmed cookie sheet and added water.  After baking, I turned the oven off and left it to sit for another hour, then refrigerated it.  No cracks, no sinking, just beautiful flavor.  I already have requests to make it again for Christmas dinner.  Would highly recommend this recipe to anyone who wants to impress their friends and family.

I baked this for a party and everyone liked it.  I will make again with the following changes that others suggested.  (wish I would've read reviews first)  Double the cookies for the crust (do not double the butter).  As it was, butter ran out of the springform pan into the oven.  The white chocolate chip part can be microwaved, just make sure to stir frequently.  Bake it in a water bath for an hour, then letting it sit in the turned off oven an additional hour.  I'd also substitute raspberry jam - it will greatly shorten prep time.  Definitely a keeper.

This cheesecake is AMAZING! Raspberry White Chocolate Cheesecake s my all time favorite dessert! I order it at every restaurant that offers it, and love it every time. Although mine didn't come out as pretty (no spring form pan, yikes), It tasted truly wonderful.   If you've never made a cheesecake before, look at the footnotes on this recipe from allrecipies. I sure wish I had. I overcooked it because I thought it wasn't ready, not keeping in mind that cheesecake cooks completely different than birthday cakes.. Yeah, I felt intelligent.

I thought this was pretty good, but I think Chantal's New York Cheesecake from this site was WAY better.  Plus that one is a FABULOUS starter recipe and very versatile.  Take the basics from this and add it to that one!

I made this for a family get together and it wasa hit. I followed the recipe exactly. The only reason I gave this 4 stars and not 5 is because it browned a lot on the edges and sank in the middle so it did not turn out very pretty but the taste was amazing!

FANTASTIC! I agree...use more cookies at the bottom than in the recipe. I personally used chocolate graham crackers. I also used low-fat cream cheese and fresh raspberries that were picked locally, it was delicious!!! Family ate it up in seconds! I will be making this over and over again.

This is absolutely a keeper. It has good basic recipes. I was actually thinking of having White Chocolate Macadamia Cheesecake and looking for some basic White Choc Cheesecake where I could tweak to it, and found this great recipe! Instead of using the raspbery jam, I put in about 3/4 cup of halves macadamia and it turned out heavenly! I follow some of the other tips to leave it on the water bath for an hour to gradually cool down the cake, and the cake came out perfect with no crack! Prior to serving, I garnished with generous amount of white chocolate curls and drizzled with dark chocolate and it looks heavenly! Made 2 whole cakes of this for my family and my fiancee's family, and it was definitely a hit! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Delicious! First made this cake to woo one of my friends who is now my husband.  It was so intense and became quite the obsession of the people who ate it that I decided that this recipe was too dangerously delicious and seductive to make while I was still unmarried! Definitely a knock-your-socks-off dessert.  Have made it about 5 times now.  I always double the crust, using 2 cups of cookie crumbs, 2 tbsp sugar, 1/4 cup butter.  Using a water bath is a MUST!  I also use more raspberry sauce.  I do find that the raspberry sauce doesn't stay mixed through and usually is near the top when it is all baked.  I just turn the oven off after an hour and leave it in there without opening the door for another hour before leaving on the counter another hour, then putting in the fridge. Freezes well! I freeze it in individual slices wrapped in tin foil and then freeze the raspberry sauce into an ice cube tray and put the cubes in a ziploc bag so that I can take as much as I want each time I take out a slice.

My mom is prediabetic, so when I made this for a visit from my parents, I made some changes.  I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese, and subbed Splenda for the sugar. It tasted incredible!  Even my dad, who can sniff a "light" recipe a mile away, said it was super, and had no strange aftertaste like some articifially sweetened recipes can.  Bravo!

Since this was my first cheesecake, I followed the recipe exactly (except I used oreos like one person suggested) - and I reviewed all the tips on this site.  My cake still cracked some, but I filled it in with raspberry sauce and chocolate and it looked fine.  I took it to a pot luck and everyone loved it.

This recipe is wonderful!  Just like Cheesecake Factory.  I took the advice and used seedless raspberry preserves.  I used the store brand of preserves and also the store brand Oreos from Target for the crust. I took out the filling in the Oreos and only used the cookie portion.  I doubled the crust recipe which turned out great.  I also took the suggestions and wrapped the springform pan in foil and baked it in a water bath on a cookie sheet.  I turned off the oven and cracked it open after baking time and left it in there an additional hour.  It didn't crack at all.  The rest I followed the recipe exactly!

Everyone really liked this cheesecake...I wouldn't say i LOVED it, but it was good.  Came out good, it set perfectly and the texture was good, better than when i tried to make a thicker NY style cheesecake, so that's good! Made it for my sister's birthday and every piece was devoured and enjoyed! :)

Ok...I am by no means a 'cook'. I'm just a beginner but I really wanted to try something challenging. This cheesecake turned out perfect!!! I followed the tips in the article and didn't even end up with any cracks - just a beautiful cheesecake that tasted just as good as the Olive Gardens! =) I highly recommend using the 2 cups of crushed oreos and the water bath. The only thing I would change is doubling the batter recipe because I wanted my cheesecake taller and using Raspberry preserves instead of boiling the raspberries. It was too much work, made a big mess, and yielded very little sauce. Other than that....soooooo yummy.

YUM! this recipe is SO good!  I was really worried about making a cheesecake as I am not that crafty in the kitchen but I pulled it off with flying colors and I did try to make it a little easier by just using the raspberry jam that was suggested by another user and it still came out GREAT so don't waste your time with all the cooking the raspberry on the stove.  I also didn't have a springform pan and just used a round cake pan and it worked fine.  I'm sure not as good as a springform would but if you don't have one this is a good substitution.

I cannot say enough about how good this cheesecake turned out!  I followed another reviewers suggestion, and baked the cheesecake in a water bath.  After baking it for 60 mins., I turned off the oven, opened the door, and let it sit for 30 mins. longer.  I then let it cool and refrigerated overnight.  It took a long time, but was well worth it.  I got rave reviews!  Thanks for sharing!

I am now on my second cheesecake in less than a week.  It was a huge success at a party and with my family.  My son claims it's the best cheesecake he has ever had. We have a lot of raspberry bushes  and I need to find ways to use the berries, so I made the raspberry sauce with fresh berries instead of the frozen.  I used the recipe "Raspberry Sauce" that is on Allrecipes.  It turned out fantastic!

I made this on a Thursday night and the cake was done at 11:00 PM. I had read reviews of other cheesecakes that said to leave cake in oven at least 6 hours with the oven off after baking to prevent cracks.  So, I turned off the oven, went to bed and put in the frig in the a.m.  Not only was this beautiful but it was the best cheesecake ever!  My father in law loved it and he is very picky.  This is one of my favorite desserts...

this was delicious, it reminded me of the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake from the cheesecake factory!! Instead of boiling down the raspberries I just used a jar of raspberry preserves. Heat it up in the microwave for about a minute and it turns syrupy and then I strained the seeds out, delicious and time saving!

Me and my husband had our  Bible study/small group over and tried this White chocolate cheesecake for the first time. We also tried it with our family and children.  Everyone LOVED it! I thought it was a complete success! I decided to leave the face of the cake white, did lines of raspberry sauce across the cake then kinda zig-zagged through the sauce and it made an elegant looking  Raspberry Cheesecake! The only problem I had with this recipe was that it cracked right down the middle when I got it out of the oven. But other then that there was NO problem with this recipe! I will definitely make it again some time soon!

Looks like a million bucks and tastes like it, too!  Melt the chips with the half and half in the microwave.  Takes  2-3 minutes on 50% power, stir every 20-30 seconds.

Great recipe!  Here is a fun variation for chocolate lovers.  I've actually made this before using 4 Hershey's Cookies 'n' Creme bars instead of the 2 cups of white chocolate and it was a huge hit!  I omitted the raspberries when I did it and spinkled the top with a little left over chocolate crumb and some white chocolate shavings.  Next time I might try it with the raspberries to see how it goes with the Hershey's :)

BEST EVER! I doubled the white chocolate to make it extra yummy. I also omitted all of the sugar in the crust since I used oreos they are plenty sweet and used just enough butter to get the crust to form. I also used seedless raspberry jam warmed in the microwave for a few seconds instead of doing the whole make your own thing and it was better I think plus alot faster!!! I have made this for my family twice and both times got rave reviews and have had several requests for me to make it again for other family get togethers. Try it you wont be disappointed

Incredible Cheesecake. It was the first cheesecake I ever attempted and it came out beautifully.  I couldn't find any chocolate cookies, so I ended up using Chocolate Teddy Grahams and two teaspoons of dark chocolate cocoa powder. I'm rating this 4 stars because the recipe leaves out the basics of baking in a waterbath and cooling in the oven with the temp off and the door cracked.  I did make the raspberry sauce as listed (very good by the way, take the extra few minutes to try it!) and added 1/4 cup of flour to the batter so I'd have a more cake-like cheesecake. I topped my cheesecake with a dark chocolate ganache and fresh raspberries.

Right up there with a well known cheesecake restaurant!  Wrap pan and bake in hot water bath.  When done, turn oven off and leave in oven for 1 hour.  allow to cool before putting in fridge.  This will result in the perfect cheesecake! WONDERFUL!!!!!

Great recipe!  It tastes great!  I accidently overcooked it so I cut off the brownish parts and covered the edges with chopped almonds - I really liked the extra touch of almonds and it goes well with the cheesecake.

This is the best cheesecake I have ever made...it rivals the Cheesecake Factory for sure!   It is the only cheesecake that I can make and it comes out perfect every time! I followed the recipe closely and the only change I made was to crush up oreos for the crust instead of buying choc. cookie crumbs! AWESOME!!!

Wonderfully delicious! Made for a friend's b'day party and came out perfect...followed guidelines for baking a cheesecake (ingredients at room temperature, used a water bath).  Used seedless raspberry jam as users suggested and I topped it with a white chocolate ganche and frozen raspberries

This is THE BEST! I made it for a Valentine's day banquet and I had signed up to bring a Cheesecake. I like them but usually just buy one. I'm glad I didn't.  I had done according to instructions but with the water bath and I let it cool slowly. After I cut it into pieces I put white chocolate shavings on the top. It was a feast for the eyes. At the banquet I made sure I got a piece, hoping it would be ok. It was better than ok, it was heavenly. One lady said that I should make cheesecakes for a living. The only sad part was that we had to share the one piece as this cake was the first one to be gone from the dessert table. It was that good. Thanks a million times for this recipe. It is well worth the effort and I will make it as a special treat for Easter again.

I've been looking for this recipe ever since I had Olive Garden's version.  This is sooooo much better and way cheaper.  Now I can have it when ever I want.  I made this for the first time on Thursday and by Sunday my husband was getting me more ingredients to make a second one for him to take to work.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.  Both cakes were the most beautiful cheesecakes I had ever seen or made!!!

This was good, but wasn't my favorite compared to some other recipes on this site.  The cookie crust had way too much butter in it!  Next time I will try a brownie crust instead.  I also didn't think that there was enough raspberry flavor in the cheesecake.  It needs more than 3 T. of sauce mixed in.  I'm sure it will be better with some tweaking - maybe with some whole raspberries or a chunkier sauce.  Overall the flavor was good, but this wasn't a "wow" recipe for me.

If you could buy one of these cheesecakes, it would easily cost $35. Very professional looking and delicious just like everyone else has said. Some reviewers have mentioned scraping the filling from Oreos for the crust which isn't at all necessary. Just use the Oreos whole ( a row and a half is about a cup) put them in a food processer and reduce the amount of butter since the filling will help the crust hold together. For some cheesecakes a water bath may not be necessary depending on what temp you're baking at but this recipe for sure needs the water bath. The one I made without it was the ugliest cheesecake ever.

I expected this cheesecake to taste more chocolately. I tasted the cream cheese too much for my liking. And the rasperberries made the cheesecake create breaks in the center. I made this 2x and had the same results. Everyone loved it, but I wasnt very impressed.

I made this recipe for my bosses 50th birthday, first time and it came out great!  I decided to lighten it up a little by using 1/3 less fat cream cheese and splenda in place of the sugar.  The white chocolate balanced out the splenda taste/sweetness; rave reviews and looked awesome!  Thank you for another great recipe:)

This was good. Not as scrumptious as I was expecting though. However, it was very pretty. I didn't change anything. It's SO rich and I'm not sure I'll make it again, simply because I think I'm over cheesecake.

This was the best cheesecake I've ever had!!! It was an easy to follow recipe and turned out so creamy and good. I baked it in a springform pan that was in another larger pan with about an inch of water in it- to prevent the cheesecake from cracking. Don't forget to put foil around the pan first so that the water doesn't leak into the crust while baking.

BEAUTIFUL AND DELICIOUS! My first time baking a cheesecake, I served it for a dinner party and everyone raved about it!  I'll be making again for christmas dinner.  I don't have a spring form pan so I used a 9.5 inch round cake pan (well greased).  Used oreos (w/ cream), 1 tblspn sugar and about 1/8 cup of melted butter.  I read the article on this site on how to bake cheesecakes and I followed their advice.  Room temp. Cream Cheese, bake for 1 hour in a water a water bath, shut oven off and cracked the oven door to let it cool for 1 hour, covered w/ plastic wrap and put in fridge for 8 hours.  My cheesecake didn't have brown spots or bubbles, and it didn't sink in the middle, it was absolutely beautiful, wish I'd taken a photograph of it. It came out (with a little work) from the pan, however I'll be purchasing a spring form pan just to reduce any issues getting it out.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a great recipe! Also, it's so easy to make alterations. I made it with butterscotch chips and apples (instead of white choc and raspberries) and for Xmas i'm going to make it with peanut butter chips and put a milk chocolate layer at the bottom for a peanutbutter cup effect!

This recipe is WONDERFUL. It's very easy and original as well. A few recommendations: when you're done baking turn the oven off and let it cool INSIDE the oven for a while. Then wait half an hour to put the cheesecake in the refrigerator. Also, to avoid crackings, bake the cheesecake by placing the pan inside another bigger pan filled with water. Make sure the cheesecake doesn't leak!

I have made this recipe over a dozen times and have perfected it. This recipe is very good, but if you like your crust to come up the sides of the cake use more cookie crumbs. Also it is much easier and just as tasty to use jam instead of cooking the raspberries yourself. Put the crust in the oven while you preheat the oven so that it firms up. Finally if you place a jelly roll pan with an inch or so of water in it on the rack under the cheesecake it makes it bake more evenly. Don't take it out of the oven as soon as the timer goes off. Instead turn the oven off and leave the cheesecake in there till you can pull it out with your bare hands! A crowd pleaser every time!

I made this for Christmas and EVERYONE thought it was amazing.  They couldn't believe it came out of my kitchen.  To save time and money, I did use seedless rasberry jam instead of fresh rasberries as someone had suggested.  I also cooked the cake in a water bath.  Once the cake was cooked, I turned the oven off and let the cake cool with the oven.  My cheesecakes never crack or dry with this method.  YUM!

Everyone loved this cheesecake! I used some of the tips that others had made. I used 2 cups Oreos without frosting, doubled the butter but used only 3T sugar. I used parchment paper on bottom of springform pan and also on the sides.I did bake the crust for 8 min. and allowed to cool and wrapped the springform pan in foil. I was sure that all ingredients were at room temp. I followed the rest of the recipe and baked in a water bath. This was my first attempt at making a cheesecake and I have to say it turned out great! My family was so impressed with the taste and how beautiful it looked! Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

Bake the cookie crust, 
and make sure u let the cheese cake settle at room temperature before chilling it.  Otherwise delicious recipe.  I actually substituted dARk chocolate instead of white, came out very delicious, and "swirly"   used grahm cracker crust. yum

I get requests for this recipe all the time! To prevent leaks, I wrap the bottom of the springform pan in tinfoil. (this also helps if you're baking the cheesecake in a water bath, and don't want water seeping INTO your cheesecake!)

A few other tips: Make sure ALL of your ingredients are at room temperature. This prevents lumps. Once you beat the cream cheese and sugar, scrape the bowl. After you add each egg, scrape the bowl! It ensures a uniform batter.

This is a great recipe! I used oreo's for the crust but will use graham crackers next time. 

Update #2 - I made this recipe again and it was even better than the first time. I made them with the oreos again but this time I removed the icing from the oreos and wow!

From what I've heard, this is the best cheesecake I have ever made, and I have made quite a variety, from chocolate-chip cookie dough cheesecake to banana caramel cheesecake. I used chocolate graham crackers for the crust. Instead of raspberries, I made half of the cheesecake with blueberry, and the other half with strawberry syrup. I used the directions from the recipe, but substituted the raspberries with frozen blueberries and frozen strawberries. What a huge hit!!!

I substituted seedless raspberry jam as others suggested.  Also used the water bath method to bake.  Browned evenly without cracking.  Very rich and creamy.  It was a hit.

Excellent cheesecake that pleased everyone I served it to! I followed some of the suggestions made by other reviewers... for the crust I used 2 rows of whole oreos, 1/4 c. butter and omitted the sugar... double wrapped pan in tin foil and cooked in water bath to prevent cracking. I made the raspberry sauce and though I haven't tried it with preserves I think that it really added alot to the overall taste. The tartness of the sauce really compliments the sweetness of the cake. Delicious!

TIP: I saw that many people had difficulty straining the seeds from the raspberry sauce, so I used a the foot from a pair of new panty hose to strain the seeds!

It's not a bad recipe BUT I like my cheesecakes to taste like cheese. This one had too much white chocolate flavor and too little cheese flavor.

I will try it with less white chocolate chips next time.

I was pretty excited to make this after having read a lot of the reviews, but I was extremely disappointed. I have made dozens of cheesecakes and have really perfected my method.  This cheesecake wasn't good. The taste wasn't bad but the texture was awful.  It was mushy and never set up even after sitting overnight.  I have hardly ever been disappointed in a cheesecake but this one was awful.  No, I am not a newbie that doesn't know how to make cheesecake.  I KNOW what I am doing, and this cheesecake was not good.  I will never make this again.

Everyone loved this cheese cake when I served it. Will definitely bake again. I did as others advised and wrapped my cheese cake pan in tin foil. Then placed it on a cookie sheet filled with water. Baked it for an hour then turned the oven off and let it sit in there for an additional hour. This cheesecake looked and tasted awesome. I will be using that method with every cheesecake I bake now.

I took this to a party recently and it was a hit!  Like some of the other reviews have mentioned, I added more cookie crumbs.  Also, after I baked it, there were several cracks in the top.  To cover these up I "frosted" it with canned raspberry pie filling and placed fresh raspberries on top. It looked very pretty, added extra raspberry flavor, and it covered the cracks.  I also used seedless raspberry jam in place of the sauce.  It was amazing-- better than any restaurant's!!

This recipe gets three stars because it baked up into an edible cheesecake but it was far from a favorite and I won't make it again.  The texture was creamy and I didn't have any cracking.  The crust was a bit soggy as the instructions didn't have the crust prebake at all.  I was surprised at the comments on how this cake resembles the Cheesecake Factory's.  In my opinion, this cake is far from it.
It was WAY too sweet without enough cheesecake flavor.  Most of the adults I served it too said it was just overwhelmingly sweet.

I wish I could give this 10 stars!! What an AMAZING Cheesecake. You cannot go wrong with this; it is every bit as good as what all the reviews say and more! I made this for a fund raising Potluck at work and people were actually arguing over the last few pieces! It's a big Cheesecake and feels heavy but is surprisingly light! If you are only ever going to make one cheesecake in your life; I recommend this one - you won't be sorry! Thank you so much for this incredible recipe! =)

my friends loved this recipe so i will definitely make this again and again.  it wasn't very difficult either. i created a double broiler by floating a small pot inside of a medium sized pot that contained simmering water.  i also added a water bath in the oven to keep the cake from cracking and topped with fresh raspberries when cooled.  loved this recipe... thanks for sharing!!!

Very good and also very pretty.  Used seedless raspberry jam in place of the raspberry sauce (much quicker!).  It serves quite a few as it's rather rich.  I hope it freezes well.

This was incredible.  I used Nabisco Famous Wafers for the crust rather than Oreos.  Also, I recommend using a high-quality white chocolate such as Callebaut instead of regular chips for this because it will give a much stronger white chocolate flavor.  I doubled the raspberry sauce, too.  Amazing.

This was my fist cheesecake and it came out perfect. I did watch the cheesecake video for pointers before my attempt. 
Also, instead of a gram cracker crust, I bought two Oreo pie crusts and dumped them into the springform pan, and then evenly distributed the crumbs across the bottom. Next time I make this, I will press shaved white chocolate on the sides. Mmmm, I can't wait!

This cheesecake is beautiful, tastes amazing, and is relatively simple to make.  I only used one cup of white chocolate chips just because I prefer a subtler white chocolate flavor.  I also used a premade crust simply because I don't have a springform pan.  Straining the raspberry sauce isn't really that bad--just prepare the sauce first and let it drain (stir it around in the strainer every so often) while you're preparing the rest of the recipe.

Wow! Serve in small pieces. This is very rich and very good. Thanks to all the helpful reviewers. I did get a crack but although I take pride in presentation, under the soft candlelight of the Christmas dinner table this cake looked beautiful. Next time I make this I would increase the base crumb amount a bit and perhaps add more than 3 Tbsps. raspberry sauce between batter layers. A recent reviewer suggested to make sure the batter is well stirred to prevent lumps. I should have done that. For those who enjoy cheesecake this is a very flavourful one. Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent! First time making a cheesecake. Worked like a charm. Followed exactly and left set in oven 1 hour after it was finished cooking. Middle was still a little jiggly, but till it cooled it came out perfect. Thanks Cindy.

Awesome recipe. I forgot to buy frozen raspberries so I improvised by adding 1/4 c water to 1 c raspberry preserves, microwaving for about 45 seconds, the stirring until smooth. Then I strained the mixture. It was super simple and worked out great. I did use a few more cookies for the crust and let sit in the oven for about an hour after baking. Very minor changes that didn't really hinder the recipe's outcome. I will make this several times in the next few months as I have had many requests. Thanks so much for sharing!

I've made this cheesecake twice now and each time it's been a huge success!
The first time I had alot of the raspberry sauce leftover so I now will only use 1/2 of the amount.
Also used chocolate sandwich cookies, removed the filling and finely crushed 2.5 cups- 2 for the crust and 1/2 cup for the sides of the cheesecake after removing from the pan.

The first time I used a water bath and the cheesecake still had one small crack so I created my own flavored whipped cream to disguise.
With mixer use 1 cup milk, add 1 small instant pudding mix ( I used white chocolate flavor) then fold in 1 container cool whip.  Dallop or use a cake decorating bag to apply.  
Shave white chocolate on top.

The second time I didn't use a water bath but let it sit in the oven after baking for two hours.  It came out beautiful but we loved the whipped topping added so I again made up a recipe.
Mix together 1 pt. WHIPPING cream along with a small instant pudding mix ( this time I used cheesecake flavor) and covered the entire top of the cheesecake     with the topping, grated white chocolate on top.
This topping was even better than the first! YUM !

This was probably the most delicious cheesecake I have ever had.  I cooked it in a water bath, and it came out perfectly.  For the crust, I used oreo cookies, which I ground really finely and put through a sifter.  I also decorated the sides of the cheesecake with the oreo cookie dust, and put some on top of the cheesecake with some raspberries and white chocolate shavings.  Everyone at the dinner loved this dessert, and it went fast!

This recipe is great.  I admit, though, I couldn't resist making some changes.  I love the tast of regular chocolate with raspberries, but wanted the pretty marbled effect on the top.  I melted 6 oz of chocolate chips with 1/4 cup of half and half and melted 6 oz of Baker's white chocolate with the other 1/4 cup of half and half.  I split the cheesecake batter in 1/2 and mixed the chocolate chips in half and poured that in the bottom of the pan, layered 1/2 the raspberry (didn't measure out tablespoons) and then mixed the white chocolate in the remaining batter and poured that on the top with the rest of the raspberries and swirled.  The result was absolutely amazing!  I definitely will be making this again!

Made this cheesecake for dinner with friends and it was a huge hit! I've never had much luck with making cheesecakes, but this turned out great! I too used 2 cups of oreo crumbs (kept the sugar and melted butter the same), but when cooking, the butter ran out the bottom of the pan....I might use less butter next time.  I also used seedless raspberry preserves instead of the sauce and it was great...but I'll use more than 6 TBlsp of preserves next time as I think I'd like more raspberry flavor. Be careful when layering...after I poured in 1/2 the batter and drizzled on my raspberry, I just started pouring on the 2nd layer of cheesecake filling and all my raspberry sauce got pushed to the side. I wrapped the pan in foil and used a water bath to bake, but I'm still not sure how to tell when it's done. I baked mine for 1 & 1/2 hours and it was still really jiggly in the middle and when I stuck a knife in the middle..it came out very wet. Since I was afraid of over-baking, I turned the oven off at the point and leaving the oven door cracked a bit, let the cheesecake sit for a couple of hours. Then refrigerated overnight. Was a little worried the next day that we'd be eating it with a spoon, but it was perfect! Garnished it with fresh raspberries (highly recommend!) and dark chocolate pieces. Everyone loved it and I will definitely make it again.

The taste was perfect! Followed all the directions, but the crust, I used 2 oreo premade crusts which the recipe was perfect for. I read the reviews after I went to the store, so we had to do the frozen raspberry from the recipe. Next time I will do as another reviewer did and swirl the raspberry after each 3 tablespoons, so the swirls go all the way through. Followed others advice and placed pies in a cookie sheet with water. Had to remove them from the oven right away and placed them in the refridgerator as soon as they cooled to touch, as I didn't read that they should have been made early, and needed them in a couple of hours. Neither pie cracked. It is going to be made in this house again, as the taste is great and is not dificult to make.

This was a very good cheesecake.  I rated it a 4 star because of the difficulty I had straining the raspberries.  Just a note, because it thickens the sauce you should strain the raspberries before you add the cornstarch. Made one for us to try and one for our cheesecake loving neighbor. They rated it 5 stars.  It's sweeter than your usual cheesecake.  Will definitely make again.

Wow!!!!Fantastic!  This was one of the best cheesecakes I have ever had.  I would only do one thing differnt.  I would use oreo cookies from the box were they have already taken the filling out.  I used original oreo cookies and scraped the filling out.  That still was not good enough.  Had a huge mess on the bottom of my oven. But it was well worth it.

This was my first cheesecake ever and it turned out really good. (I even used the 1/3 less fat Neufchatel cheese.)  However, despite the 2 cups of white chocolate in the recipe, you can't really taste a white chocolate flavor.  It just tasted like a great raspberry swirl cheesecake.

Don't worry if it doesn't look set up when you take it out of the oven.  It will set as it cools.  Just bake until it barely starts to brown on the top edges.  Mine did crack as it cooled.  Maybe I should have tried the water bath method?  I wasn't sure how to do that.

Amazzzzingg! I used strawberries instead, which worked out great. This cheesecake will make you look like a professional.. which I definetely am not. My boyfriend loved it, seeing as he pretty much ate the whole thing on his own.

Absolutely fabulous!  I made this (in several mini heart-shaped springform pans) as a Valentine's Day gift for my hubby...and then hid them in the fridge.  He discovered them a day early, but I'm glad -- I was dying to try them, and his discovery gave me the perfect excuse!

A note about the water bath -- I placed 3 of the 4 pans in a bath; the other I set just next to those 3.  What a difference!  The ones in the bath set up perfectly and baked without a single crack.  The other sank in the middle and had multiple cracks throughout, although still tasted just as great.  If you're concerned about the presentation of your cake, I'd recommend you opt for the water bath while baking. 

This was a wonderful, wonderful recipe -- thank you for posting it!  :-)

Normally when I bake cheesecake, I bake until 2" center is still unbaked. This cheesecake never got to that point. I had to bake it much longer and the top browned.  I put a chocolate ganache on top to cover.  It is VERY GOOD, though!

This was wonderful!  I thought i had ruined the cheesecake when i  mistakenly put the remaining sauce on top before baking rather than the 3 TBS as indicated.   I think the indicated amount, as others have stated, is not nearly enough.  mine turned out fabulous with the right amount of raspberry flavor.  Next time, i will evenly divide the amount of sauce the recipe makes between the middle and top.    the swirling was lovely too! very bold and vivid with so much of the sauce on the top.

This Cheesecake is as good as advertised. I just served it at a get together last night and almost blushed at the compliments. I did make one little change that's worth considering - instead of Half and Half I used a White Chocolate flavored Cream Liquor. Fantastic!!

I have made this recipe several times - and each time it is eaten to the last crumb! The guys my husband works with - ask him to ask me to make it - the only thing I do differently is add all of the rasberry sauce to the cheesecake - they like more of it in the cake than as a sauce on the side

I only rated it a 4 because no one raved about it. I also added more chocolate and more raspberry preserves for a stronger flavor. I did like it, as everyone did, but I wanted something that ppl would want the recipe for! Also next time I will use 4 cream cheeses, it was a very small cheesecake( not tall)

Fantastic. I used raspberry preserves and it sunk where they were too thick. It tasted as good as the Cheescake Factory! I used chocolate graham crackers for the crust.

Made it for an Easter party, and it was also my first time baking a cheesecake. - It was demolished by the end of the night! No one could tell it was "healthier" (used low fat cream cheese) Very creamy and dense but not too-too rich. I didn't have frozen raspberries, so I used raspberry preserves. I also used a mix of finely chopped graham crackers and Nilla wafers for the crust. Yum!

Thank you, thank you, thank you for this recipe!  After many horrible results with other cheesecake recipes, I'm so glad to find one that finally works!  I baked the cheesecake in a water bath, and after about one hour, I took a perfect looking cheesecake (with no cracks) our of my oven.  It's cooling in the fridge right now, and I can't wait to try it for dessert tommorrow night!  Thanks again1

Excellent cheesecake! I followed the directions as is, except I only strained about 1/2 of the raspberries. It got time-consuming, but taking out some of the seeds seemed to help. Also, I didn't save any sauce to drizzle on top after it was baked, I just put some sauce in the middle of the cake and some in the top and swirled it around. In the morning when I took it out of the fridge and boxed it up, I used a vegetable peeler on a white chocolate bar and a dark chocolate bar to make chocolate curls. BEAUTIFUL! I gave it to a couple of friends at their office to thank them for their help, and when I got back to my cell phone, there was a message of the two of them singing (yes, singing) about how gorgeous the cake was. They hadn't even tasted it yet and they were raving. They did get back to me after they'd tasted it, and I believe the concensous was "OH MY GOODNESS GRACIOUS". I think that says it all! Thanks for a great recipe!

Beautiful!!!  Did not strain raspberries; the seeds add a special effect to the cheesecake; and they're not huge, lumpy & bumpy nor hard on teeth, so I'd suggest leaving them in.  The raspberries tasted great!  Used 12 oz of fresh raspberries, mmmm-mmmm!  Defintely double the crust.  Swirl the knife in a circlular and heart-shaped fashion to achieve a professionally made cake.  Still had a problem with cracking during the 55 minute baking process, even though I placed a pan of boiling water underneath the springform pan.  Served with extra raspberry sauce (needed another 6 oz of raspberries) and drizzled chambourd fudge on top.

I used this and a recipe for Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake, dabbled with both, and ended up with something that was really good.  Like others, I had enough filling for 2 pies, but needed twice as many raspberries.  Speaking of, I did have issues getting the raspberries strained, so one cheesecake was a little crunchy (No one seemed to notice but me :)

If I could give this six stars, I would. I tried this recipe for the first time two years ago, when I first started making cheesecakes, and it's been a hit ever since! It is time consuming, but the results are worth it. I always throw a little extra vanilla in and once had to substitute half and half for heavy cream with no problems. A water bath is key to eliminating cracks in this divine dessert. Absolutely spectacular!

Absolutely fantastic! Everyone liked the cheesecake so much I ended up making 5 from late Dec. until mid Jan.  The biggest pain is straining the raspberries, but well worth the effort!

Wow--this was GREAT!  I did make a few changes: instead of using a springform pan, I divided the batter between 2 ready made chocolate cookie crusts.  Also, I substituted raspberry jam for the raspberry mixture (a real time saver!).  My family RAVED about this and have already begged me to make it again!

This recipe tastes wonderful with any kind of fruit.  I've had the most success with fresh fruit, but frozen is still delicious.  I always use graham cracker crust, and it works very well.  People often ask where I bought the cheesecake, and they are amazed when I tell them it's homemade.

I made this for my husband's birthday and he was in absolute heaven.  Hands down the best I've ever made.  We have half of the cake left and I will need to make more raspberry sauce to drizzle over each slice.  But other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect.  (I also cooled it in the oven as others mentioned.)  Thanks for a recipe that is destined to become a tradition in our family!

Raspberries are really expensive in Australia at the moment, so I substituted them for strawberries, which worked quite well.  However, I stumbled upon a problem when I had no idea what 'half and half' cream actually meant.  If anyone can shed some light,  I'd really appreciate it!  I used an 8 inch pan and the cake took about an hour and a half to cook.  The result wasn't pretty, which was a worry because I had plans to take it to dinner at a friends house.  But the biggest issue I had was when I opened the over after cooking time was completed to find it absolutely COVERED in fat which seemed to have dripped and splattered from the cake and ended up all over the oven door, grills... you name it!  After cleaning up fat for around an hour I wasn't in much of a mood to sample this cake.  I still have no idea why this happened.  However, everyone seemed quite happy with the result at dinner.  But I don't think I'll be making this one again!

My boyfriend and I made this last week, and it was delicious. We used crumbled Oreo pie-crust instead of the cookie crumbs to save some time. He took the leftover slices to some friends and got rave reviews. This recipe has already been added to our box of keepers. Thanks for sharing!

I made this cheesecake recipe, with no variations whatsoever, and it turned out excellent! I've made many different cheesecakes before and this one is definitely a keeper!
Edited to add: I've made this dozens of times over the last 3 years & it is the BEST cheesecake I've ever made!I always get rave reviews! Here are a few small tweaks I've learned, though:
First, I do not use the cream in the oreos. It slides off pretty easily, so I use the cookie part only. Otherwise, I think it's too sweet & messy. I also use my food processor to grind them up very fine.I use seedless raspberry jam for the filling now, as suggested by another reviewer... thank you! It's every bit as good as the home-made raspberry sauce in the recipe & SO much easier and less time consuming. I use 1/2 cup... microwave for about 30 seconds (or until melted) & then I allow it to cool some, while mixing the other ingredients. I also do the same when the cake is ready to be served... put it in a little baggie, drizzle over the top of each piece. Another reviewer stated that when you use the preserves, "it will make indentations when it bakes and makes the final appearance look bad with jelly fissures." This is a good description & very true. But if you drizzle the sauce over the top before serving, it hides this & truly makes a lovely presentation!
Also, when preparing your spring form pan, if you cut a piece of parchment paper & line the bottom, & spray the pan with cooking spray...it keeps it from sticking.

I just made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a huge hit!  Yes, the white chocolate taste is not strong, but I don't think you would want it to be.  The crust and rasberry added enough sweetness, and using the rasberry sauce as a topping really completed the dessert.  Thanks for sharing Cindy!!

Very Pretty to look at and yummy too... Raspberries a little bit tart, should have added a bit more sugar..wished for a bit more white chocolate taste too, might try a different brand or more chips next time. Very impressive on a fancy plate with sauce drizzled and chocolate shavings. Guests couldn't believe I had 'made it myself'-- Thanks so much!

This was really yummy.  I don't even like cheesecake all that much and I liked it.  I did make some changes though.  I used Fat Free Cream Cheese, I also used vanilla waffers instead of chocolate (BTW I always make my crusts in the food processer.  Just dump in the cookie, pluse a few times and then add the melted butter and sugar) and I only used 1/2 the sugar (but I doubled the crust).  Also for the raspberry sauce I replaced the water with this rasperry wine we got from Bonny Dune Vineyard and I used all of the sauce in the cheesecake.  The sauce was WONDERFUL!!!  It's what made it 5 stars:-)

This cheesecake was wonderful-my husband absolutely loved it!  The raspberry sauce was very good and not as hard to make as I thought it would be.  Definitely bake it longer than the recommended 55-60 mins.  I baked mine for 70 min and the middle was still not  quite finished.  It was still very delicious!

Quite possibly the best cheesecake ever!!!!!!!
I used cheesecloth instead of a strainer for the sauce, and it was very messy! You might want to bake it 5-10 minutes longer.

Fabulous cheesecake.  Not only does it taste awesome it is also beautiful in appearance - my guests thought it was from a bakery.  Instead of the chocolate crust I used a traditional cheesecake crust.  Yummy!

The 1st time I made this cheesecake, I made just like the recipe as written.  The second time, all I did differently was use strawberries instead of the raspberries and used a graham cracker crust.  Both times, it was delicious. (I do not like cheesecake, however, this recipe has made me change my mind.) I did follow other recipe recommendations the second time about covering the bottom in foil and placing it into water to bake.  I baked for 55 minutes and then just turned the oven off for an hour. The second cheesecake was perfect, no cracks.
My family enjoyed both cheesecakes.  I would suggest that anyone making a cheesecake read suggestions and hints for making them.  They are helpful in making sure your end product looks good.  This was my first attempt at cheesecake and surely will not be my last.

This cheesecake is rich and delicious! It tastes just like the Cheesecake Factory's White Chocolate Raspberry Truffle cheesecake. I followed the instructions exactly and it turned out perfect. I did bake mine in a water bath. It took about 75 minutes. Then I turned off the oven and left it in there with the door ajar for another hour or so. It had no cracks at all and looked gorgeous. Making the raspberry sauce was a bit of a pain in the neck due to having to strain the seeds; however, I don't know that using a raspberry jam would be as good. The sauce in this recipe is not nearly as sweet as raspberry jam, but it's the perfect counterpoint to the sweet, rich cheesecake. I also love the chocolate crust!

This was my first try at making cheesecake.  I used raspberries from our garden and didn't even take out the seeds because I didn't have anything to sieve them with.  No one noticed them.  I followed others' suggestions and used Oreos and less butter and sugar for the crust, had everything at room temperature, baked in a very shallow water bath with the foil, and left it in the closed oven for another hour after the one hour baking time.  Everyone raved about it and I would definitely make it again.  I always thought it was hard to make cheesecake, but not this way.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I love this cheesecake! I’ve now prepared the cake 3 times, the first attempt was prepared exactly as listed, after that, I followed others’ suggestions. Either way, it tastes great- but it’s MUCH easier to simply microwave the seedless raspberry preserves rather than prepare the berries yourself. I also use crushed Oreos for the crust, I would recommend not using double stuff though- too much cream. Also, I highly recommend wrapping the bottom of the pan in foil and placing in a water bath before placing it in the oven. Bake for 55 minutes, turn the oven off, crack the door, let sit for another hour, and then place in fridge. It hasn’t cracked on me while using that method.

I use the base of this recipe for most of my cheesecakes, every mixup I have done has turned out very well, gets great reviews, and is usually gone before I get any. For this recipe in particular, if you are not partial to chocolate, I also like to do a normal graham crust and add the zest of 1 lemon to the batter.

This worked really well! Took a while, but was worth it! I made a raspberry whipped cream cheese frosting for a topping which turned out great, and went nicely with the cake. I ended up making extra crust because I didn't have enough, but that might have been because I ate some. ;-) This was only the second cheesecake I've ever made, but it turned out great, and everyone loved it!

I found this recipe years ago and I'm not lying when I say it is requested at every holiday gathering. My son who hates cheesecake asks for this every year for his birthday. I have made it with the raspberries, with different flavored jellies as well as without any jelly in the middle and just a small smear of warmed jelly and fruit on the top. It is always delicious! I use half a package of oreos with the filling and just 3 tbs of butter for the crust then I bake it for a few minutes and let it cool while I make the filling. I also put a small pan of water in the oven, bake for an hour and let it sit in the oven for another hour without opening the oven. It usually cracks but I just cover the cracks with jelly and fruit :)  A family favorite for sure!

I used 2 cups graham cracker crumbs, 6 TBSP butter, and 3 TBSP sugar, pressed into bottom 10" springform pan lined with parchment paper and baked for approx. 15 min at 325.  Let cool slightly and continue as recipe states (I too used the seedless jam) and bake in a water bath.  Let cool in oven.  Perfect every time.  For fun I have broken the piccolo cookies in half and attached to sides with melted white cholocate.  Pretty and easy.

This is a delicious and creamy cheesecake.  I followed the recipe exactly but next time will double the crust.  It was too thin on the bottom and not enough to go up the sides.  It would be over the top with whipped cream!

This cake was the perfect consistency. I doubled the crust because I like a thick crust. I couldn't taste the raspberry sauce, and once it cooked the swirls all disappeared too! Definitely at least double the amount of sauce you put in it.

Definitely  worth 5 stars. I've made it a few times now and here are my tips.  I used crushed oreos, 2 cups, no added sugar. I usually add extra butter to my graham cracker crusts-bad idea here, use per recipe or less, the oreos stick together pretty well on their own. DO NOT use the jam trick, it's too sweet, the real raspberry sauce cuts the sweet of the white chocolate and is important. Blend thawed raspberries    (2× listed amount-better too much than not enough, and the extra is for serving on top) and strain before  cooking MUCH easier then doing it after it's thick. Make sure you add enough cornstarch to really thicken it, otherwise it can cause uneven cooking. Last, normally I crack the oven and let it cool but the 325 oven is too hot for that, take it out, DO NOT remove the ring until it's room temp, otherwise the raspberry swirl, being a different density, will cause cracking. Once room temp, refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight.

I'm by no means a baker nor am I a cook. I'm very much a novice but I felt adventurous and decided to give this recipe a go, so glad that I did! This cheesecake is soooooooo good! I can't believe my very first cheesecake (that I made entirely on my own, might I add) came out so unbelievably scrumptious! Family and neighbors gave it high reviews. We even argued over the pieces, yes it's that good! This cake is smooth and rich, melt-in-your-mouth goodness. It tastes and looks beyond professional. I've already made it twice. I'll have to start making 2 at a time to ensure I have enough to go around and share. 

Definitely bake this in a water bath as recommended by other reviewers. Wrap your springform pan in a double layer of foil, place it into a roaster pan or a jelly pan, then pour hot water around the springform pan, enough so that the water covers the sides of the springform pan halfway. Cook for an hour then turn your oven off and keep your cake in the oven for an additional hour before removing.   

If your thinking about switching out the chocolate cookie crust for a grahm cracker crust, I'd recommend keeping the chocolate cookie crust as it more so compliments the taste of the raspberries and cheese and looks more visually appealing in my opinion. Also make sure to double the amount of crust. 

I can't think highly enough of this recipe & cake, it's beyond any cheesecake I've ever had!  I'm most proud that I made this entirely on my own & that it came out so smashing!

I have made this recipe more times than I can count! My friends and family absolutely love it. The only changes I have made are slightly shorting the cooking time, increasing the amount of crust and adding more vanilla extract.
Use a sieve for the raspberry seeds but you will have to stir as the juice drips to move the seeds out of the way. Lastly, you can microwave the chocolate chips to avoid the hassle.

I didn't love this as much as everyone else. I followed the recipe EXACTLY and it didn't have a lot of raspberry flavor, and wasn't nearly as pretty as a lot of the posted pictures.  It was ok, but I've had much better luck with other cheesecake recipes from allrecipes.

Our absolute favorite Cheesecake! This delicious cake never lasts more than 1 day. Make the recipe as directed, you won't be disappointed :-) 
Tips: bake in a water bath-I cover the outside of the springform pan with foil and place it on a cookie sheet that I fill partially with water. Once the cake is done, turn off the oven but don't remove the cake for an hour.

I have not made this recipe but my Son , who has NEVER  made a cheesecake before did ! It was wonderful, I would even say it's the best I have had and can't wait to make this one myself.My Son told me of all the steps he took and it was a success. He did not have a hand mixer and was afraid it was not smooth enough but it was fine.The flavour, taste and texture were all perfect for cheesecake.this is a keeper !

I tried this for the first time last week, took the leftovers to work, and it was gone within an hour!! I made this recipe to exact specifications and it turned out perfect (perfect consistency).  I did not strain the raspberry seeds as I had nothing available, but it was still great and no one complained.  I will make again, but with more white chocolate chips to bring out the flavor a little more and try to get a strainer. I feel putting seedless raspberry jam like some viewers, instead of real raspberries just takes away the fresh flavor of the raspberries and is not an option for me, the seeds did not hinder anything.

Everyone loved this when I made it for the past Christmas holidays. My sister brought in a Japanese cheesecake from a well-known baker. They both tastes different (Japanese cheesecake is more softer) but everyone liked the one I made more, because it was very flavorful and rich! Will make again

Absolutely heavenly!  I followed the directions as written and we loved it.  Based on other reviews, I did ensure that I did not overbake and left it in the oven to cool.  I am a bit of a health freak and rarely indulge in such decadent desserts but I will be making this again.  Thank you so much for sharing!

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great! It was my first cheesecake so I didn't know what I was doing, and it ended up with two huge cracks in it. I covered the cracks up with sauce and no one could tell! I found out by researching later that if you overbeat the eggs or don't let the cheesecake cool GRADUALLY (and don't open the oven while its baking!) you can avoid cracks. Also I forgot to grease my springform pan, so there was that as well.

Don't freak out over all the tips/changes posted by other reviewers about cracks, etc.  After this cheesecake "turns" in the fridge overnight, it will be heavy, dense, and creamy.  Absolutely fabulous!  This will be my go-to basic recipe for all future cheesecakes.  Follow the recipe exactly the first time and make any changes next time.....there will be a next time.

This is so good and I always get asked for the recipe.  Transporting a cheesecake isn't exactly easy so in order to make it more portable I use the premade chocolate cookie crusts. This recipe will make two cheesecakes of that size. I bake them in a water bath at 325 for about 50 minutes and then turn the oven off let them set for about an hour. Thanks so much for the recipe!

I bake often, but have never made a cheesecake before this one. I made Oreo crumbs in the food processor (suggested in the comments) for the crust.  It was the BEST dessert I have ever made/tasted! I am a huge chocolate and peanut butter lover so I was not expecting this to be so high up on my list, but it is definitely my new favorite!  My only problem was straining the cooked raspberry.  It was very messy and didn't make nearly enough to cover both layers, so next time i will try seedless preserves in the microwave.

Awesome recipe! I have made it several times. My plan is to bake a smaller version of the cheesecake for each widow in my church who has lost their husband in the past calendar year. It will be a Valentine's Day treat for those lovely ladies to show our love and appreciation for their lives.

This was actually the first cheesecake I've ever made. It wasn't as difficult as I thought it would be and it turned out great. I made it for my mom's birthday and it ended up being one of the best cheesecakes I've ever tasted! I would definitely recommend and I'm sure it will become a new favorite at my house.

I think this is so good. Like a restaraunts even. But I thinks the raspberry sauce should be doubled maybe bc when it is ready to eat there is not much left to put on top.  But still a GREAT RECIPIE!!!

Mine needed a full hour in the oven.  I put it in a water bath and kept it in the oven for another 45 mins after I shut the oven off, with the door closed, to keep it from cracking.  Also used 6 TBSP jam instead of making raspberry sauce... Much quicker and very good!

I made this tonight, and one of my pickiest friends said "this tastes like heaven". Bit of a pain in the rear, but very much worth it. I read some reviews and followed with the x2 cups of Oreos. Also, added 3 cups of white chocolate chips instead of just 2. Wonderful recipe. This was my first cheesecake attempt, consider it a success! Not one bite is left (and I only had one piece).

Great recipe. I will make this again.  I had to up the crust portion to easily fill the bottom of pan.  Next time I will double the raspberries as I ran out prior to glazing the top.  Turned out great and tasted great.  Thanks!

The cheesecake didn't turn out as what I expected. It was too rich and sweet for me. I used two cups of OREAS without the cream fillings. I also used 6 tablespoons of seedless raspberry jam. I acidentally used a 8 inch springform pan instead of a 9 inch so the batter was filled up to the top of the pan. I shouldn't have poured all the batter into the pan but I was too greedy. I baked the cake for an hour in a water bath and the cake rose 2 inch higher than the top of the pan. I let it sit in the oven for 2 hours after baking and the cake fell back down. The top of the cake turned brown, I guess maybe I overbaked it? There isn't a lot of cracks just where the raspberry swirl is seperating. I think I put too much cream cheese and too little raspberry sauce. I was going to make this cake for Halloween Party. I am glad that I made this yesterday and not the day before Halloween because it doesn't look good and it tastes too sweet. Next time, I have to make sure I use a 9 inch springform pan, right amount of cream cheese, more raspberry sauce, and less sugar. Hopefully it will turn out as good as the one in the video.

I have made this dozens of times. Slight changes, I use an Oreo crust, I melt my chocolate in the microwave for exactly 1 min., I add all my eggs at the end and all at once (I do this with every cheesecake!) and I microwaved seedless rasp jam and swirled that throughout. Awesome!

Have made this a few times now. Still working out how to make it look good though...keeps on cracking, which is probably my technique and not the fault of the recipe. Followed instructions on must helpful comments re raspberry jam and the amount of sugar in the crust.

Yes, it is one of my husband's favorites. Cheesecake takes practice. They get easier the more you make them. I use a very small strainer to leave the seeds out. The seedless jam just doesn't taste the same as cooking the raspberries.

This was a good cheesecake and I give it 4.5 stars.  The only thing that keeps it from being a 5 star cheesecake is there is just not enough white chocolate flavor.  The next time I make it, I will 1.5-2.0 times the white chocolate.  I used 1/2 white chocolate chips and 1/2 Godiva white chocolate with vanilla bean.  Sort of a high-low combination.  Yet, it still was missing that good white chocolate flavor.  As far as the technique and outcome of the cheesecake goes, I did have some cracking around the circumference, but no major cracking in the middle.  I even put a pan of water in the oven with the cheesecake to help avoid this problem.  I didn't think it mattered anyway because the raspberry sauce drizzled over the top hides everything.  Didn't have the problem of leaking butter that many complained of and I think it's because I used chocolate graham crackers for the crust.  They tend to be more absorbent.  If you are using crème filled cookies (like Oreo), you should cut back on the amount of melted butter and that should solve the problem.  But just to be sure, put a piece of foil on the bottom rack to catch any drippings.  Better safe than sorry!  Also, I used the tip of putting parchment paper on the bottom of the springform pan and had no problems getting each piece off.

This cheesecake presents a WOW factor. It's just that good and sometimes I have a hard time waiting hours for it to settle or cure but it is necessary. I've found that you won't find frozen raspberries in every store so I have used raspberry jelly in it's place. The only problem with jelly is that it will make indentations when it bakes and makes the final appearance look bad with jelly fissures. Plus it alters the taste with the brand of jelly you choose. 

Altogether this cheesecake is heaven in every slice and you would expect to pay $6 or more per slice at a high end restaurant for sure.

This cheesecake is phenomenal.  It is my husbands birthday cake nearly every year, but it is not for the faint of heart.  There is a lot going on all at one time, so familiarize yourself with all the steps well ahead of time.  Definitely worth the trouble.  Also, the video tutorial on cheesecakes is very helpful.

After I boiled the raspberry mix, I poured it into my Vitamix and just blended it,instead of straining out the seeds. That way it remained a nice consistency of a sauce and not so runny. I followed everything else thoroughly and it tasted wonderful! The family was impressed.:-)

Wow!!!! First time making a marbled cheesecake and everyone loved it! Long to make but totally worth it! I left it in the oven when it was done baking for another hour to cool down and avoid cracking, it cracked a bit anyway but it was delicious! Best cheesecake :)

I made this cheesecake for my dad's birthday. He loves cheesecake and I never made a baked cheesecake before. This recipe was a BIG hit! He loved it and so did the rest of my family. I'm not a sucker for cheesecakes but it tasted delicious. Followed the recipe to the T, only added some more raspberry sauce to the cheesecake batter. Baked it for 60 minutes at 160c in a fan-forced oven. It was perfect.

I just made this cake for a get-together and everyone thought it was great, not a crumb left on any plate. While it was cooking I read some of the negative reviews and got a bit worried! The only thing I would say is that I did have a small issue with the cake not setting.  I turned up the oven to 350 and let it cook an additional 10 minutes which seemed to do the trick. This does not have the texture of a traditional cheese cake but as a white chocolate/raspberry dessert it was great. Also many reviews complained about the white chocolate, I used inexpensive Nestle morsels and they worked great. Bought higher quality for shaving on the top.

I made this last night as a late Valentine's Day dinner dessert.  I couldn't find chocolate cookies so I used regular graham cracker crumbs for the crust.  I took advice from the other reviews and doubled the amount of crumbs to 2 cups.  Other than the crumbs, I followed the recipe to a "T".  I also did the water bath that was mentioned in the "Perfect Cheesecake Article" found on this site and instead of pulling the cheesecake out when the timer went off, I turned the heat off and let the cheesecake sit in the oven for another hour.  My wife almost had a heart attack when she took her first bite and did everything just short of singing praises.  After posting a completed picture of the cheesecake to Facebook (yes, I'm THAT guy) I was quite the talk for about 6 hours.  All credit goes to the original poster of this recipe!!!!!  This is now a staple in my "in-the-doghouse" tool box.

For my first attempt at making a cheesecake, I was very happy with the results. The flavor was incredible. It did not firm up like cheesecakes I've purchased or eaten at restaurants, but I think I many not have cooked it long enough.
I did wait the recommended 55-60 minutes, but I use a small oven, so maybe it did not get to the correct temperature.

Amazing taste and so beautiful.  Even if it cracks, just pile fresh berries on top and drizzle with white chocolate (I couldn't make the curls work).

This is wonderful. My husband loved it; my family loved it; and company loved it. I made it last night, for our New Years Eve party, and I followed the recipe to the T.
Having read all the bad reviews first to see exactly what people were having trouble with, mostly with it not setting correctly in the middle, I prayed and prayed that my Cheesecake would set. Thankfully, it did, but there were some cracks in the surface.
Once the cheese cake was done, I turned the oven off and opened the door and let it set for a while until some what cooled, then I took it out and let it cool even more so I could chill it. I chilled it for about 20 hours in the refrigerator, took it out and spread the raspberry sauce on top, which covered the surface cracks, and I melted some left over brown coating chocolate I had and piped it on. 
Next time I will try the water bath method, and maybe decorate with white coating chocolate and fresh raspberries and whipped cream.

This was an immediate hit. I adjusted the amount of cookies used like other comments suggested by doubling it and it was a good idea. I also didn't remove the seeds from the raspberries. I was afraid people wouldn't like the seeds in it but everyone thought that it gave it good texture and made it feel more fresh.  I added cornstarch to the mix to prevent cracking and it worked. There were no cracks and it did not alter the taste. I also doubled the amount of raspberry sauce. I used the entirety of what the recipe called for in the batter and then used the other half as a drizzle on top. One thing to note for anyone unfamiliar with making sauce like this, it will not thicken all the way while it is on the stove. Once pulled off and gets cool, it will finish thickening so don't over cook the raspberries because you are waiting for it to get thick in the pot. Happy baking.

Made this recipe for my sons bday. He requested cheesecake for dessert. It was delicious!  Turned out great! I will use parchment paper on the bottom next time to easily move to a serving dish. I am making this for our Christmas gathering. It's so amazing! I do agree that it needs a little more crushed Oreos for the bottom because it barely covered but, worked fine.

I don't know what all the fuss is about. I followed this recipe to the T. I knew after blending all the ingredients together that it was too thin.  I cooked the cake for 55 minutes at 325 degrees and then let it sit for 45 minutes with the oven off. The batter was still wet in the middle and it rose to over the pan.

This recipe is truly fantastic. I'm not a fan of cheesecake, but this is definitely the exception to the rule. I make this for every holiday and family occasion. I also give it as christmas gifts since it is such a crowd pleaser. Surprisingly simple as well.
I always wrap the bottom with foil and cook in a water bath. I always use neufschatel cheese, just to make it a little less of a guilty pleasure.
I've used both oreos and chocolate animal crackers for the crust and I've switched up the berries - blackberries wind up a bit sweeter but have a really unique delicious flavor. My mom has used half white and half milk chocolate and said it turned out great.

I give this recipe 4 stars, because I change it quite a bit. My husband loves a dark chocolate raspberry cheesecake which he orders at our favourite restaurant. I went looking for a recipe for it, but this was the closest one I could find. So, I use it with these alterations: instead of white chocolate chips, I use dark chocolate chips (50% cocoa or higher); I also make double the raspberry sauce and mix half of it right into the batter with the chocolate and reserve half of it for garnish - I don't swirl it at all, although I'm sure that would taste good as well. Oh, one more thing - I leave the sugar out of the crust, as it tends to make it taste grainy. It's sweet enough without having to add sugar. Thanks for the great starting point to make this awesome dessert!

I am 44 years old and did not like cheesecake until I made this and tried it!  I have made it about 5 times since and it is a HUGE hit!  Well worth the work involved and I will be making it for Thanksgiving - by request.  Thanks for sharing!

Should have read the comments about crushing the oreos in a food processor/blender - this cake is unbelievably good but i've never gotten the crust quite even - next time!

I made this cheesecake for my wife to take to work with her! She said that this was the popular dessert on the table and her coworkers were asking who made this! When she told them that I made it, they were asking when was I going to make another! This one will be in the books! No question about it.

This was my first attempt at any kind of complex dessert, and I was nervous going into it. After chilling overnight, it turned out AMAZING. It's not puffy around the edges, it's perfectly fluffy and delightful. Only things I'd recommend for anyone wanting to make this is to spray the bottom of the pan (I always forget this step) before putting in the bottom crust, because I had to scrape at the crust with a knife and it made it look ugly and sloppy. Crust tastes great though. Another thing, DON'T skimp on the getting out the raspberry seeds thing. Was feeling a bit lazy, and left the seeds in, and they're almost annoying. The raspberry tastes good but I wish I had strained out the seeds. And the last thing is that next time I will probably make more of the raspberry sauce, because I barely had enough to make a few swirls; maybe double or triple the amount it says to make if you want it to cover the top like in the picture (that's what I was shooting for).

Overall a fantastic recipe, even for someone not totally comfortable in the kitchen like me. I will definitely be making this again.

I have made this recipe countless times, and it turns out amazing each time! I've perfected my cheesecake techniques, and this turns out smooth and creamy, not at all the "pudding" texture I have read in other reviews. I have been asked for this recipe countless times! I have adapted the raspberry swirl into whatever berry or fruit you would want, as well as a delectable milk chocolate swirl. I have never found it too sweet, or been unable to taste the swirl, or had the white chocolate overpower the "cheese" taste.

Absolutely delicious cheesecake - the tart raspberry sauce compliments the rich cheesecake beautifully. Followed Eliece's advice to cook for less than the proscribed hour - very glad I did as it was perfect once cooled. Do not hesitate to try this recipe - you won't be sorry!

I made this for my in-laws and it was a complete hit (as everyone has already mentioned). This was also my first time making a cheesecake, and it was completely doable. Bringing everything to room temperature first does make the process a lot easier. Also, I used real raspberries, and it was a pain draining out the seeds; however, the sauce was so amazing, and that was basically (no pun intended) the icing on the cake. Everybody was raving about how great the white chocolate flavor coincided with the sweet and tart flavors of the raspberry sauce. Everyone in the family went back for seconds, and some even went back for thirds! I would definitely make this again. Actually, I would make two for any occasion because this cake goes so quickly!!!! And before I forget, for the crust, I used Peppridge Farms Captiva Chocolate Brownie cookies for the crust. :)

It wasn't so much the taste I didn't like it was the texture. It was like eating a solid block of flavoured cream cheese. Far too thick for my liking, I couldn't eat it.

Im not sure if I should actually rate this recipe or not- I used it as a base but I changed so many things that its hardly the same cheesecake any more. I didnt have white chocolate chips so I used regular chocolate- I prefer chocolate over white chocolate anyways. Rather than making it a full chocolate cheesecake I reserved some of the batter and left it vanilla and made it into a marble raspberry swirl cheesecake. I read the other reviews and just used raspberry preserves instead of making my own and that worked really well. I didnt use all the butter for the crust, it got a bit soupy after about half.

This was the best cheesecake I ever made.  Just delicous. I wish I could give it 10 stars.  I used an entire package of chocolate cookies (not oreo) and did not strain the berries. Used frozen strawberries as I could not find frozen raspberries. Used Splenda instead of sugar and you could not tell at all. It cracked but who really cares! When cooled and out of the pan I put the berry sauce in the little indentation on top. Made it and froze it for Easter and will definitely make again.  The one is a winner!  Thanks CindyAnn for a terrific recipe.

This cheesecake is wonderful! A change that I will make next time though is to add more white chocolate. The flavor of it doesn't show up very well but the other than that, the cake's awesome.

I've probably made this ten times, no joke... I made it once and gave away slices to family, and now people are asking me to make it for them for holiday dinners and parties, because they loved it so much. The last time I mixed in some blueberries just because I had home-grown raspberries and blueberries. When I tried to make one in the toaster oven (on BAKE setting), it cracked a bit (probably due to the uneven heating), but the ones I made in the regular oven looked great and people complimented me on how it looked, also. This year is the third year in a row I've made it for Easter dinner.

Very creamy and delicious!  Next time, I would omit the 1/2 cup sugar altogether because it was a little sweet.  I made this in a mini-cheesecake pan which caused me some problems because it isn't a dense cheesecake.  I had to freeze these for about an hour to unmold them.  Also, in baking the smaller cheesecakes I learned two things: don't use the convection feature and wrap the pan bottom in foil and bake it in a water bath.  Recipe made 24 mini-cheesecakes with some filling left over.  Also, next time I would use MUCH less butter in the crust since a lot of it dripped out.

Let me start by saying that I'm not really a cheesecake person, and I don't really see the point in desserts that aren't chocolate. But, I tried this cheesecake for our Valentine's day dessert because my husband and son aren't that crazy about chocolate, and WOW.  I can't believe how good this was!  I made it just as written. I don't have a mesh strainer, so I had to use just a colander, so there were a lot of seeds in it, but I don't think anyone cared. I might buy a mesh strainer just so I can make this recipe!  I have a get-together with my girls next weekend, and I know what I'll be making! Thanks to the reviewers that suggested leaving the cake in the oven to cool; mine did not crack at all with this method. Great recipe--thank you!!

This is my 2nd time making it. The first time I used fresh raspberries and it was great. I also used 2 cups of oreos for the crust. This time I used raspberry jam as I was short on time, but I do not like the taste as much. I don't recommend it as a substitute.  And boiling the raspberries the first time didn't actually take that long and the color looks so much better in the cheesecake. Also this time I made it in 2 8x8 square pans so I can cut it into small square pieces for a party.

5 stars - it was exceptional and a great ending to a prime rib roast dinner.  I just used a mix of berries (raspberries, blueberries and blackberries) instead of just raspberries.

I took this to two different Christmas parties, and it was a hit both places.  Everyone loved it, and it was relatively easy.  The only suggestion I would make is to put a cookie sheet on the rack below the chessecake pan, as mine leaked a little in the bottom of the oven.

I have made a ton of these in the last 2 or 3 years. The picture change kinda caught me off guard this year. As one reviewer said, the middle will tend to be a little mushy. I added an extra egg yolk to the last 2 I have made and it remedied the problem. (If you use 1 egg for 8 oz cream cheese, it only makes sense you will need an egg to combat the sliminess of the white chocolate chips. A baker friend suggested using just an egg yolk and it comes out fluffy and jiggly when right out of the oven.) I also use the whole bag of white chips. We decided to try the berry medley pre-made pie filling to save time and it does wonders. I've made it with and without the water bath and also in a convection toaster oven. Surprisingly, the best result was the toaster oven! It fluffed up nice and tall and tasted delicious! I will continue to use this recipe during the holidays for years to come! :)

Made this twice in 4 days. The first time I made it with only 1 cup of white chocolate chips and it was perfect. Not too sweet. I did the swirl as written but it sunk in really bad. I used the melted raspberry jam. The 2nd time I made it I had the 2 cups chips. Much sweeter. I added all of my batter in and then swirled in the melted jam. I took a thin sharp knife and swirled around the whole cheese cake so the lines were quite thin. No sinking and the design was beautiful.

Everyone seemed to really like it. I replaced the raspberry with strawberries though, and I also used a gram cracker crust instead. I will definitely make it again.

This cheesecake is fantastic! Rich, sweet, creamy, and attractive. I made it for my family for Christmas dinner. Everyone loved it, and I got special comments on the crust, for which I used oreos- about 1 3/4 cups ground in my food processor, 1 T sugar, and a little less than 1/4 c butter. I might reduce the butter more next time, because the crust ended up a little extra moist. The middle did crack, even though I turned off the oven and left it in for a bit to prevent it, but the swirled pattern on top made it unnoticeable. I liked the raspberry sauce and thought it was worth the work. Thanks for the amazing, delicious recipe!

i'm just gonna join the fanbase here and say this was amazing. i had a basic cheesecake recipe i put together from various recipes and thought i had it down until i tried this. i did modify it slightly - added a bit of unsalted butter and sour cream to the filling, and used graham crackers instead of chocolate cookie crumbs for the base. but other than that, followed it to a T. it's not my favorite type of cheesecake, but it's my husband's so i made this for his birthday. SO GOOD. i may be eating more of it than he is...!!

I made this cake for my husband's birthday party. Everybody loved it! It was a last min decision to make this cake so I had exactly 6 hours of 'chilling time' for the cake. I set the refrigerator to the max cooling level and the cake turned out perfect! Also used Rasberry jam for the sauce and Oreos for the cookie base to cut down the total prep time..I read most of the reviews and followed all the helpful advice..and my cake turned out delicious!! Thank you all!

This cheesecake was easy to make and turned out perfect. I did follow the instructions on "how to make cheesecake" and covered the bottom in foil and put on a tray with water. Baked for 1 hour then turned off the oven and left it in the oven for another hour.

I rather feared this would be a little bland, since the ingredient list didn't look too much different from many other recipes. Don't be fooled by the simplicity of the recipe!  I did change things a bit because my son doesn't care for so many seeds.  I cooked about 4 cups of raspberries for the sauce and removed the seeds from all.  I did add about 1 TBS homemade berry liqueur to the sauce to zip up the flavor a bit.  With three teenage boys in the house, the pan was empty by bedtime, and they were looking for more. Thanks for a great and easy recipe.

I baked it too long I think. It over filled the pan I was using therefore the lacey part over cooked. Have to try this again. Gonna give it four stars cause it had potential im sure!

This got rave reviews. I had to substitute the half and half for canned coconut milk and I used strawberries instead of raspberries. Everyone loved it. I found that the 1/4 cup of butter in the crust was a little greasy, it might be my choice of cookies but next time I'll use less.

PHENOMENAL!! Needed a cheesecake for a family BBQ/Birthday supper and decided to try this one as it came up the top rated cheesecake... absolutely lives up to the hype! I changed the crust as didn't have oreo/chocolate crumbs...used graham wafer crumbs with 3/4 c of crushed almonds in it...the almonds with the white chocolate and raspberries...YUMMY! The cheesecake cracked a bit more then I am used to (seems to crack along the swirl lines) but it still presented beautifully with the sauce drizzled over it. My family is insisting I make this again soon!!

Awesome cheesecake! I over baked it a bit, but it still came out great! Made some changes - used the 2 cups oreos, 1/4 cup butter and 1T sugar. Don't think it really needed the sugar though. I microwaved some black raspberry seedless preserves instead of boiling fresh or frozen berries. I melted the white chocolate in the microwave with the half and half. A couple people said it was the best cheesecake they ever had! Will make again in the future.

Every bite of this cake is delightful. This makes a great sweet treat to serve your guest, or perhaps a nice birthday cake for your loved one. I think the raspberry sauce was a bit too sour so I sweeten it a little bit more by adding 1 tablespoon of sugar. For the crust I followed other reviewers advice and made it with only 1 tbsp. of sugar and it tasted just fine like that (remember that if using Oreo cookie crumb, like I did, the cookies are already sweet enough). Anyway the cheesecake is delicious and I am not being sarcastic. Try it, you'll enjoy it!

This is so delicious and easy to make!!  Just the right amount of each ingredient to make it creamy and mouthwatering. The raspberry sauce is wonderful over it and would be great for summer entertaining. Thanks to CindyAnn for sharing this special recipe and I will definitely be making this one again.

This was really good.  Only one problem.  I substituted raspberry preserves instead of the cooked and strained raspberries.  I warmed the preserves in the microwave.  When I put it in the cheesecake mixture it all settled on the bottom of the cake.  It still tasted fantastic, but there was hardly any swirl of raspberries in the cake.  Next time I will do the raspberries the way the recipes says instead of substituting anything.

PERFECT! Like others, used seedless raspberry preserves, and used chocolate wafers for crust rather than oreos...not a bit too sweet, did use more crumbs so could go up side of pan a bit with crust. Did add Bittersweet Chocolate Ganache (recipe on this site) and fresh raspberries to top. It was beautiful and over-the-top delicious, making a perfect end to fabulous braised lamb shank Valentine's Day dinner party.

My 11 year old and I made it for my husbands birthday (who loves cheesecake) and it was delicious and easy to make. We used honey grahm cracker's for the crust and double the amount to get enough to cover the pan. Substituted one low fat cream cheese for one of the three and never noticed a difference in taste. Excellent recipe, thanks!

I made this last weekend for my parents' visit and everyone loved it. It tasted amazing. I used the oreos (w/ cream) for the crust, following the suggestions for less sugar and butter. Crust held together great! I put parchment paper around the inside of the pan and I guess I didn't have it in there completely flat b/c after I took the cake out you could see the edges weren't perfect. My raspberry sauce also didn't get very thick so I need to experiment with that a bit more. All in all, definitely a keeper!

It is tasty but it never quite comes out right. It always comes out soft and uncooked in the center. I've tried cooking it longer however the edges burn and the center stays soft and undone. I'm not sure where I am going wrong.

I recently made this cheesecake for a friend as a first time challenge as he is a diabetic i had to use splenda in stead of sugar. It was very simple to make and got rave reviews.  For the first time making any form of cheesecake I found myself passing the challenge.  Now I have tons of friends and family that want one.. Looking forward to seeing if i can do it again.

Everyone loved this recipe. I baked it in a springform pan in a water bath so I had to bake it about 20 more minutes because the water bath slows down cooking. I used parchment paper on the sides and bottom to help with sticking, had no problems with that. I felt this cheesecake was very yummy but I kept it in the freezer after it was completely cooled down and it stayed very creamy and the prefect consistency to eat. I had no problems with it being mushy like others said. The freezer was the trick for me.

excellent! my hubby loves cheesecake and I had to try a new one out. I made double the raspberry sauce but it was a little tart but still so good!! Worth the extra work!! Next time I will use the blender on the raspberries and then strain before cooking like many had said previously. thanks for a yummy treat!!

Absolutely amazing! This was the first cheesecake I have ever made, and it turned out great! I served it at Easter dinner and my entire family was raving about it. I would be interested to try it with just a graham cracker crust.

This recipe is the very best.   I'm making it for my 4th time, and I'm trying the water in the cookie sheet idea someone had suggested above, to prevent the middle from caving in, and so far, so good.  My house smells of deliciousness, decadent white chocolate.  I'm actually pretty annoyed that I have to let it cool for 8 hours before digging in :(

very good, very heavy.  First time I had no crack in a cheesecake!  Next time i will make according to recipe, and not add extra white chocolate as others suggested as it made it way to heavy.  But all in all, very good.

Oh my- this was AMAZING!  Made this for Christmas Eve and it was a hit!  I followed the recipe, only I used mixed berry preserves (melted in the microwave) and didn't remove the seeds. I followed the advice of others and covered the bottom of the pan in foil and baked it in a water bath until it stopped "jiggling", then let it cool in the oven for an hour.  Absolutely no cracks!  I made this again for New Year's Eve, but used a pre-made Oreo crust, and it was just as yummy.  You can cut the recipe in half and the amount is perfect for a pre-made crust.

This has been our favorite cheesecake recipe for many years!! I've made it countless times and in so many versions. I like to use it as a base for other types of cheesecakes, besides raspberry. One of my friends repeatedly says "this is the best cheesecake I've ever had. Hands down." I love to add a raspberry gelée to the top of it. Tastes & looks great. 
My only modifications are to reduce the white chocolate to 1 cup, and I also add a cup of homemade mascarpone. When I don't have any mascarpone, I'll use sour cream. It gives it a great taste & texture. I also bake it with a pan of water on a lower rack. The humid oven helps create a smooth, creamy texture & no cracking. It's perfect! 
For the raspberry gelée: I add a packet of gelatin to a couple tablespoons water, let sit until dissloved. I cook the raspberry sauce, like in the recipe, then I warm up the dissolved gelatin in the microwave until melted & liquid (maybe 10 seconds) and then mix into (warm) prepared raspberry sauce. Then pour it onto cooled cheesecake. Place cheesecake in fridge to let gelée set up. Takes a few hours. Piping a little whipped cream onto top before serving gives a nice presentation. Yum!

Awesome recipe. the only thing I would say is just add the first layer of raspberry jam.leave it off the top and have your guests add as they want as it could be too sweet

This recipe is AWESOME! I read through all of the reviews and tips and it came out perfect. I used the cupcake pan filled halfway with water and set the cheesecake on top of it when baking - it worked like a charm. I also had a gut feeling and turned the overn temp to 315 - and I only baked it for 50 minutes - just before the edges starting turning golden. So yummy, I will make this many more times.

This recipe turned out fantastic.  I served it at a family Chirstmas party.  I also used a water bath.  I turned the oven off and left it in the oven when the time was up and cracked the oven door. No cracks and it cooked perfect.

I loved the flavors in this cheesecake.  The straining of the raspberries was time consuming. But I don't think you would have the same rich flavor with seedless jam.  The consistency of the cheesecake itself was just right.  Some cheesecake sit like a brick when eatean, this was lighter.  The topping of fresh raspberries and white chocalate shavings was beautiful.

I made mini cheesecakes with this recipe as the base.  To save time I used a store bought can of raspberry pie filling. I suggest using foil cupcake liners to prevent sticking.  All you do is place a whole oreo cookie in the bottom of each liner and prepare as instructed in this recipe.  After marbling the raspberry, place in an oven at 350 for 25 minutes.  Mine tend to sink in the middle but that just makes a perfect "bowl" to add a spoonful of raspberry filling.  I top with a fresh raspberry.  I thought they turned out great but my boyfriend said he wanted them to be sweeter.

This is a 10 star.  I make a lot of Cheese Cakes and this one is the best.  I used Lindt White Chocolate Bars,  and grated some to finish the top.  The raspberry sauce was a bit tart so I added a 1/4c. raspberry jam. For the crust I used Oreo's Thin Bits and cut the sugar to 1. TBSP, the cookie has sugar on it.  Also I used 1 1/2c. crumbs for the crust, it worked fine with the amount of butter.  I did do the water bath and after 1 hour I shut of the oven and left the cake to cool.  PERFECT.

I made this at Thanksgiving and now my friends and family ask for it at every gathering.  I highly recommend using seedless raspberry preserves and just heating in the microwave, but putting fresh ones on top for decor.  I also used the tip to melt the chocolate in the microwave.

This was the first cheesecake i've ever made and not only was it easy to make, it was delicious. I followed the directions and made no alterations. Next time i will add more sugar to the raspberry sauce as it was a bit tart for my liking but still a great cheesecake.

Cheesecake is my favorite food, and this is the best i have ever had!! The flavor and texture is incredible!!! The only thing that i did differently was up the amount of cookie crumbs. Also be sure to follow the techniques listed on this website for making a cheesecake. This will ensure that it turns out creamy and crack-free. Thankyou CindyAnn!

This was sooo delicious! Was the first cheesecake I’ve ever made and I must say I was pretty proud of it. It was a huge hit at the dinner I took it to, and needless to say there weren’t any leftovers. Definitely read the tips on baking a cheesecake if you haven’t already. Mine came out with not a single crack and had a wonderful consistency, which I credit fully to the water bath and  allowing it to sit in the oven for a few hours after I turned it off. It’s a professional grade cheesecake sure to impress!

This was absolutely amazing. My husband said it was the best homemade cheesecake he has ever eaten and that it was comparable to the cheesecake factory. I followed the recipe exactly except that I used 2 C chocolate cookie crumbs (crushed oreos in the food processer) and butter for the crust per other reviews. It was the perfect crust consistency and I had no problems covering the bottom. I did bake it in a water bath for 55 minutes (until it jiggled like jello but was not too firm) and them turned the oven off and let it sit for another hour. It turned out beautifully. Thy only thing I will do differently next time is use parchment paper on the bottom So I can move it to a platter to cut more easily. Also, running a knife under hot water, then drying with a cloth immediately made slicing the cake easy and clean.

I made this cheesecake for Valentine's Day and it was AWESOME!! I doubled the crust because I LOVE crust and used the seedless raspberry peserves. Otherwise I followed the recipe to a T and it was just fabulous.

Five stars doesn't even do this recipe justice!  This was so good.  My family LOVED it.  Thank you for the recipe and to the helpful hints from other reviewers.  Particularly thank you to ESTELLA93 for her advice (wrap the bottom of the pan in foil, place on a cookie sheet with water, cook 1 hour, leave in stove for 1 hour with no heat) and everyone who suggested using raspberry jam.

I love this recipe!  I first made this cheesecake for the holiday season for a party at my neighbors house.  Everyone loved it! Even the people who don't normally like cheesecake couldn't get enough.

This was one awsome cheesecake!  I did make some changes though...1) Used 2 cups of crushed oreos - filling and all w/ 1 Tbs. sugar - kept butter the same. 2) Used fresh raspberries and kept the seeds 3) To bake, I wrapped the bottom of the springform in foil and placed on the middle rack. 4) Placed a 13 x 9 pan with water on the bottom shelf (springform is leaky) 5) When done I turned off the oven and cracked open the oven door and left the cheesecake in there for about an hour before removing.  The water/leaving it in the oven method really works - there wasn't a single crack!  The only thing I changed which I regret is that I doubled the white choc chips.  While I love white choc, doubling the chips made the flavor too strong and the cheesecake too sweet.  I recommend only using the 2 cups as per the recipe.

Fantastic cheesecake recipe.   I made it for Fathers Day lunch, and everyone thought it was wonderful.  My brothers girlfriend is a dessert chef and she gobbled it all up with high praises to it.

Hands down the best cheesecake I've ever had.  I received so many compliments from every single person who tried it.  I followed the recipe exactly except was lazy for the crust and purchased a premade oreo crust and just crumbled that in the pan.  My cream cheese wasn't even room temperature, and the texture was still fantastic.

Love the fact that the raspberry sauce wasn't too sweet. This cheesecake was fantastic. Only one problem-the baking time was WAY too long. Luckily I had baked many cheesecakes before are knew what to look for (because I have ruined a lot of them). I baked it for about 40 minutes (until it was set but jiggled like firm jello) and just turned off the oven, door still closed, and left it in the oven for an additional hour before taking it out to cool on the counter. It didn't crack at all. Absolutely wonderful recipe.

This was delicious! I used a graham cracker crust instead of a chocolate crust and it was still awesome. I drizzle the raspberry sauce on the plate and on top of the cake. I also drizzle a bit of chocolate sauce on the plate too. The key to this cheesecake is to take it out of the oven when the center is still wobbly. I turn off the oven, open the door and leave the cheesecake in there to cool- it prevents cracking and works well.

This cheesecake is definitely restaurant quality. I did bake it in a bath to get the right texture. Swirl the raspberry sauce don't mix it. Other than that, follow this recipe to the letter and it will come out perfect.

I made this last night for a gathering and it was a HIT.even the people who really didnt like cheesecake went back for seconds. I didnt follow the recipe exactly bc I used seedless raspberry preserves instead of boiling the rasberries and I also used the cheesecake water bath bake method one user mentioned. No cracks and was perferct! Baked it for an hour, turn oven off and left it in the oven to cool for another hour. I will be making this again! YUM!

I have made this recipe countless times. Everyone that tastes it just loves it!!! It is truly a hit!! I have made several changes to cut cost. I use chocolate graham crackers or teddy grahams instead of cookie crumbs. It always turns out--and I make cheesecakes often. Love this one!!

Followed directions other than took shortcut for raspberry sauce as suggested by others - used raspberry jam in jar instead of straining raspberries. I took to a family event & the entire cheesecake was gone in an instant! Rave reviews from everyone. Have to admit it WAS one of the best cheesecakes I've ever had - even in a restaurant! Definitely do water bath - put springform pan bottom wrapped in foil to prevent leakage.

Truly out of this world....I have baked many things and this was my very first attempt at a cheesecake and it turned out absolutely wonderful.  I did however use an entire bag of regular stuffed oreos and about 3/4 stick of unsalted butter (melted) for the crust so that it would be enough to cover the bottom and sides of the pan. This made a thick and delicious cookie crust. The raspberry syrup is worth making and does add something extra to the cake.  I also used a water bath and there were no cracks...a beautiful presentation.  I cooked it for 1 hour then turned off the oven and left the cake in there for another hour untouched with oven door shut..took it out and waited for it to cool completely before refridgerating. Everyone loved this cake, even my brother who does not like cheesecake...he asked for seconds...you absolutly must try this recipe...you will not be disappointed!

My daughter requested this for her birthday cake. Fantastic cheese cake!!! I wrapped the spring form pan in foil and put it into a bigger roasting pan and filled it with water. The cheesecake turned out beautiful. We used fresh local raspberries which were in season and a bit tart so they were a wonderful contrast to the somewhat sweet cake. We will definitely make this again.

This was exceptional. I made the crust out of oreos. I used ghirardelli chocolate instead of chocolate chips and fresh rasberries in stead of frozen. Other then that everthing was kept the same. ANd everyone gobbled this up and not a piece was spared!

I'm a first-time cheescake maker. This was a fairly simple recipe. Something I learned was that it's supposed to be jiggly when you are to take it out of the oven. Take it out anyway. It turns out fantastic!

This is amazing! It was my first time making cheesecake so I didn't want my expectations to be too high but it came out great. I took the advice of other review and used 2c oreos and 1T sugar for the crust and was glad I had or it would have been really thin. I put the raspberries and water in the blender and then strained the seeds out before cooking it, so it wasn't difficult to get them out. I also used milk instead of half & half when melting the white chocolate. Will definitely make this for future special occasions or when asked to bring a dessert somewhere! Thanks for the recipe!

Very decadent.  I used a bit more white chocolate than the recipe called for (maybe 1/2 cup extra) because I wanted to use up what I had.  I think doubling the sauce is a good idea and speading  it more through the middle of the pan would have created more swirls.  The water bath is essential for even baking and to prevent cracks.

after making this I am now known as the best cheesecake maker EVER in my family! I used 2 cups oreos, with less sugar as noted in an above review. Bought seedless rasp jam and heated it- saved A LOT of time. the fresh raspberries on top really gave it a nice tartness against the white chocolate cheesecake. this is fabulous.. i made one to bring into work- which i took a sample piece out.. and the boyfriend and 7 year old ended up eating the Whole thing before the weekend was done! had to make a 2nd one to bring into work on monday!

I've made this several times already and everyone has loved it. I didn't have time to find raspberries once and used blueberries instead, and the cheesecake was still wonderful. I did cook it longer than suggested.

This is SO delicious.  I have made it a couple of times and everyone loves it.  It tastes like it came from a restaurant.  I made my husband a strawberry cheesecake from this website for our anniversary (also had 5 stars) and it was good, but nothing compares to this.  This blew it out of the water!  MMMMM......

This was my first cheesecake and it was wonderful.  I used the chocolate teddy grahams for the crust and it was a perfect sweetness.  I used the raspberry preserves for the sauce.  Mine turned a bit brown in cooking but no one cared as it tasted so wonderful.  Next time I will try the raspberry sauce only to have some left over to drizzle on the top.  I cooked it in the water bath for 1 hour and let it sit in the oven for 1 hour.  Not a single crack.  No one could believe this was my maiden voyage with a cheesecake.  Thank you so much for sharing.

I made this using the recommendations to use 2 cups crushed Oreo cookies, but  used approx 3 Tbs melted butter and 1 Tbs sugar for the crust so there wasn't too much butter seeping out of the springform pan.  I also added 4oz extra white chocolate for more flavor.  The raspberry preserves proved to be very easy, but is a little too sweet for my tastes, so when I make this again, I will take the time to make the raspberry sauce with maybe less sugar than called for.  I also used the water bath method for baking and no cracks developed while baking or cooling.  Over all, this is a very creamy, rich desert that will wow any body!

The BEST cheesecake ever! I used two rows of Oreos for the crust, 1/4 c of melted butter & 1T of sugar mixed together & pressed into a springform pan. Using seedless rasberry preserves instead of doing step 2 makes things much easier. Just warm the preserves up a bit in microwave. Big hit with everyone! :) Thanks!

Very good texture.  The flavor of the white chocolate was not as pronounced as I had hoped it would be.  I used frozen Bing cherries instead of raspberries for the fruit.

my dad had a craving for white chocolate raspberry cheesecake, i got this recipe and it was a hit, the cake looked beautiful, and it tasted delicious, the only problem i had, when you were suppose to do the seperate layers of batter, and raspberry sauce, it just all seem to mix together and rise to the top, when i poured the rest of the batter in, still delicious and pretty

This was just as amazing as everyone says it is.  I used the tip of doubling the sauce as well as straining the blended raspberries/water before making the sauce. Everyone loved it!

Loved this cheesecake as did my company.  I doubled the crust recipe, but kept the white sugar amount the same and used a 10" springform pan. I don't like a really thick cheesecake.  I warmed 6 T raspberry preserves with 2 T water to save time on the raspberry sauce.  I did use the preserves with seeds and you couldn't tell they were in there.  I kept the rest of the recipe the same, even the baking time.  I always put a pan of hot water in the oven while baking the cheesecake to keep it moist and help prevent cracking. I also leave the door closed for a couple of hours while the cheesecake cools. Excellent taste and texture. Will make it many more times.

It was a great cheesecake (I have a picture of it on my file). I had to make the cheesecake in a cake pan since I did not have a springform pan, so it was a little challenging but used the "cheesecake tips" listed on allrecipes. Also, I gave my cheesecake a water bath, which helps avoid cracks. I also did not use a whole lot of white chocolate since I do not like it. I used 1 cup of white chocolate and 2 blocks of semisweet chocolate, added 1/2 tsp of vanilla, and extra sugar. Also, I did not have half-and-half so I used regular 2% milk and 1 1/2 Tbsp of butter. So, I made some alterations.  Also, I had quite a bit of raspberry liquid leftover so I added a bit more sugar and poured it over each individual slice when serving, along with cool whip, and some fresh raspberries. It was the best cheesecake I ever had.

This cheesecake was absolutely delicious!  It looked great and it tasted great.  I'd say it was a little more mushy than I'm used to, but that doesn't matter much when you wolf it down quick.

Wow! This is an excellent recipe! I used chocolate teddy grams instead of cookie crumbs, and it came out perfectly! I made this for guests and they were certainly wowed. My only advice is to really let it set up and not to rush to process. Follow the directions exactly!

This was the best cheesecake I ever had. I followed the other reviews and doubled the oreo cookies and left everything the same. The raspberry sauce was good, but time consuming because of the seeds, and I had tons left because it looked too pretty to cover with sauce. I cooked it 65 minutes in a water bath. I thought it was underdone at first, but apparently every other cheesecake I've ever made was overcooked; it was perfect. I will use parchment paper under the crust next time though.

This is only the second cheesecake I have ever made but it turned out fabulous! I did have some cracking, but that is probably my fault not the recipes. I made it for Easter and it was a hit! Everyone loved this rich cheesecake. I will definitely be making this one again.

I made this for my best friend's birthday, and since I wanted to send most of it home with her, I made two (so my family could enjoy it as well).  I put them both in the oven at the same time, and I put one in a water bath and had one without (did not have 2 jelly roll pans available).  It definitely makes a difference!  The water bath version looked perfect and had no cracks.  The non-water bath one looked slightly overdone and had some cracking at the edges (but still tasted wonderful).  I used Oreo-type cookies for the crust and used seedless raspberry jam to save time.  I also cooked it the night before, and left the oven door cracked overnight as suggested by another reviewer.  Garnished with fresh raspberries and white chocolate shavings.  Beautiful and fantastic!

Wonderful! I do make some changes though.....just my preference.  Instead of chocolate cookies I use any shortbread cookie available.  I don't do the raspberries unless in season usually I either melt some werther's caramels or use smuckers caramel sauce.  It makes for a wonderful white chocolate caramel cheesecake there is never any leftovers....

Absolutely delicious and perfectly smooth!!! I wasn't sure how the raspberry seeds would strain, but the syrup turned out beautifully! The only change I made was that I used crushed chocolate chip cookies for the crust since I couldn't find chocolate cookies.

Made this for my Mother-in-law's Birthday and everyone loved it. Many people said it was the best cheesecake they have had anywhere. Changes I made: - Used a 10-inch pan - Used 2 cups of oreo cookie crumbs (packaged and sold at grocery) and therefore doubled the butter and sugar for the base. - Made double the amount of raspberry sauce.   I baked the cake in a bath for 1 hour and 30 minutes. (I think it took a little longer because the water I put in the bath was cold. I will be making this cake next week-end for Easter since everyone like it so much.

My friend and I, both baking amateurs, decided to make this yesterday. It was phenomenal! One of the best cheesecakes I've ever had. My brother and his friends finished it by the end of the day, and they made us promise to make it again.  Our only problem was that the pan floated around a bit in the waterbath and the cheesecake turned out a little lopsided. But it was still delicious, and there were no cracks! Definitely keeping this recipe.

Delicious!! The only thing I didn't do was make raspberry sauce, just warmed raspberry jam w/o seeds and used. Did the water bath but still had a crack on top, although no one cared it was to die for!! Loved the tip about using oreos, works great!

This is the BEST cheesecake you will ever make - a gourmet-quality showstopper.  I've made it three times.  Here are the changes I made to perfect it:  1. Double the crust recipe.  2. Skip the raspberry sauce and use seedless raspberry jelly instead.  (Stir it up to make it thinner.)  3. I've made this cheesecake in a 10-inch springform pan as well as in two 5-inch cake pans.  (I prefer the two cake pans.)  For either, butter the bottom and sides of the pan(s), line the bottom with a circle of parchment paper, then butter the top of the paper.  4. Bake in a water bath until the center is jiggly and almost raw-looking (around 45 minutes for the springform pan, 35 minutes for the 5-inch cake pans). Turn off the oven, open the oven door, and let the cheesecake(s) cool completely.  5. To remove the cheesecake from the cake pans, cool in the fridge for several hours, run a knife around the edge, invert on a plate, then upright the cheesecake so the cake is face-up.

My family absolutely loves this recipe! I get constant requests for it and it definitely satisfies your sweet tooth. I took the suggestions from some previous reviews including warming some seedless rasberry jam in the microwave rather than using fresh rasberries and it was so much easier. It's a great dessert that not only tastes fantastic, but looks very professional no matter how you decorate it (I actually just drizzle additonal jam on the top and make whatever design suits my mood before adding the whole rasberries) Great for any occassion! Thank you for submitting it!

YUMMO!!!  Followed the suggestions by others to place in a water bath and leave in the turned off oven (mine for 3 hours), turned out perfect with...NO CRACKING! This cheesecake is absolutely divine; cannot wait to make for a party.

This cheesecake is absolutely delicious. It turned out to be rather large, but was gone in a day. If you like rasberries and cheesecake, this is the one to bake!

My family doesn't like raspberries so I used strawberries instead.  They LOVED it!!!! This cheesecake is great with or without the fruit puree.  Thanks for sharing.

This was good. I think next time though I will use only 3/4 of the amount of the white chocolate mixture, and I will double the amount of the raspberry mixture.

I made this for my mother-in-law's birthday a few days ago and all I heard from everyone was "mmmmm...".  This recipe brings the perfect blend of white chocolate and raspberry that is both rich and refreshing. Beautiful to look at AND absolutely delicious. A 'must try' recipe!

I made this for my daughters Principal and it was a hit. My only addition would be, definitely give your self a day in advance it sets better and stays looking nice. I happen to think the flavors develop so much better when you give it a good four or more hours to set.

This was so good. I had never made cheesecake before and this turned out wonderful. It was a lot easier than I thought making a cheesecake would be and it tasted like it was from a restaurant. I think I will try making it with Strawberries next time!

Great cheesecake, very rich.  Followed other suggestions to use the 2 cups of full OREO cookies.  We all really liked the chewiness of the crust, but cutting it to serve was not easy.  Also did not strain the seeds out of the raspberries and it was just fine.

Absolutely wonderful. Got the response "best I've ever had". However, will take advice of others and use raspberry jelly next time as straining seeds was VERY time consuming.

Wow I love this recipe, made it for Valentine's Day dessert and hubby loved it. This was my first Cheesecake that did not crack. I didn't have a 9inch pan so use a 8.5 inch so I used 2 small ramakins forthe excess mixture. I whipped some heavy cream for the topping and dusted with cocoa powder and placed choco chips to decorate.  Absolutely love this will make it again for sure. XXXXX

Fanominal! Everyone LOVED this. You could taste the white chocolate, the raspberry sauce, and the chocolate crumb crust in every bite.  None of the flavors over powered the other, like some do in cheesecakes. The texture could have been a little smoother but that could have been my error in the mixing process. I HIGHLY recommend this recipe if you need a wonderful cheesecake and/or dessert for any party, business meeting, or just for a nice treat at home. (My kids even liked it.) A+++ Recipe!

i didn't make this but i did eat it!  a friend of mine made it for her boyfriend and was gracious enough to save a piece for me.  it was the best cheesecake i've ever had!!  i mean, totally OUTTA SIGHT!!!  i know she used chocolate teddy grahams for the crust, and lined the pan w/alum foil, and didn't open the oven at all while cooking, and had no cracks.  whatever she did, i can't wait for her to do it again and make another one!  oh, and i know she used 1/3 less fat cream cheese, too - that's a little consolation in the guilt factor :)  MAKE THIS!!!  **oh, i just saw she reviewed it herself & tells what she did: username is charlie chan** :)

I just made this last night!  We tried it tonight!  It was delish however my crust stuck to the bottom of the pan.  Did I need to grease the bottom first or did I just not have enough butter mixed with the crumbs?

Chocolate and raspberry is my favorite and you couldnt ask for a better cheesecake!! I did use semi sweet chocolate with this as I didnt have white on hand. I also didnt stain the raspberry sauce and poured the remaining sauce over the top and then melted chocolate before refrigerating. Then topped it off with fresh raspberries. I could have eaten the whole thing!

Very good! Best to bake it in a water bath (wrap pan well with tin foil and place in 1" of very hot water). This will ensure a perfect crack-free texture. After one hour loosen cake from edge of pan with a warm or greased knife and let stand to cool in oven (2-3 hours) before refrigerating.

I think i will get rasberry jam or something next time instead of the frozen rasberries because i had a hard time trying to strain the seeds out of the sauce.  still amazingg though even with the little crunch of seed every once in a while.  i used probably about 2 cups crushed oreo's with butter and no sugar for the crust.  i didn't top with the rasberry glaze because i already thought it had enough rasberry flavor and i didn't want to overpower the cake or make it too tart.  i did top though with homemade whipped cream, oreo crumbs and shaved white chocolate pieces.  beautiful and scrumptious!  Thank you!

Fabulous. Definitely add cornstarch after straining the raspberries for the sauce and add more sugar to the raspberries to cut the tartness. Also, I cut the sugar in the cream cheese mix by half- white chocolate is very sweet as is. I am one of few people who do not like oreos- what is that "cream" filling made out of anyway. So, I used chocolate Teddy Grahams and followed the crust instructions. I did double as many reviewers stated, but it is not necessary.

There is nothing wrong with this cheesecake but I thought the taste was rather mediocre, which surprised me since I used a high quality white chocolate, organic raspberries and other quality ingredients.    If you like very sweet deserts, you may well like this cheesecake.

I'm giving this 4 stars since my husband loves it, but I'm not quite as excited.  It's okay, but I didn't think it was that special.  Maybe my expectations were too high.  If I tried it again though I would definitely double the raspberry sauce because the recipe didn't make enough.  I also made the mistake of trusting the recipe and should have tasted the sauce.  It was extremely tart!  Next time I would add more sugar.  Thanks to the reviewer who suggested adding the cornstarch after straining out the seeds.  That part worked well for me.  If anyone has any advice on the crust, please share because I always have trouble with an Oreo crust sticking to the pan when I cut the cheesecake.  This time I tried lining the pan with parchment paper and spraying it with cooking spray (per another reviewer), but the crust just stuck to the paper.

This received RAVE reviews at our Christmas party.  The only thing I did different was not strain the raspberries to get the seeds out b/c I didn't have a mesh strainer.  No one seemed to care and it was a HUGE hit!

I made this for Christmas Eve dessert.  There was hardly any left and everyone gave it two thumbs up.  I think my raspberry sauce was a little thin, so it separated from the cheesecake a little on top resulting in some minor "sinking" of the swirls.  No one seemed to mind, though.  The white choc. complimented the raspberry nicely. Both flavors came through well. I also subbed graham cracker crust- just personal preference.  Placed pan of  hot water on rack below cheesecake instead of traditional water bath- didn't want to risk getting it wet! I already have the ingredients to make a second one for New Year's Eve party.

the first cheesecake I have ever made and it turned out great!! I put a pan filled with hot water on a lower shelf and i let the cake cool in the oven with the door open.... I had no cracks! I also used about 2.5 cups of oreo cookies which I crushed...looked super pretty once I put the glaze on top!!

This is a restaurant-quality recipe that will absolutely wow your guests.  I followed another user's advice and lined the bottom of the springform pan with parchment and hit it with a little cooking spray.  I placed the pan in a 9x13 water bath.  When the cake was just about done, I let it rest in the oven with the door ajar until it cooled down.  I don't know if it was the water bath or the gradual cooling, but I didn't have any cracks or splitting so I have no reason to change a thing next time!!  This was my first cheesecake attempt, and it came out absolutely PERFECT... Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This cheesecake was amazing!!! I made it for my mom's birthday party but I used oreos for the crust and a few extra raspberries for the sauce. It turned out awesome. Other recipes I've used haven't produced such great flavor, it's the first time the white chocolate has come through so well. Definitely a nw family favorite!

This cheesecake was fantastic!  The raspberry sauce was the perfect complement; not too sweet, not too tart. However, I could not taste the white chocolate in it at all, so I am not sure I would go through the hassle next time. I also think I might go half-again or even double the filling next time - I like my cheesecakes a little bit thicker. Thanks for the great recipe!

MMMM sooooo goood! I followed the advice of using raspberry jam and it was easy to use but I don't think it packed enough raspberry punch. Next time I'll try it with the frozen raspberries per the original recipe. I doubled the amount of white chocolate and felt like it still could have used more. I also doubled the amount of chocolate crumbs and liked the nice thick crust. One of the best cheesecakes I've ever made!

Absolutely amazing!!! I used milk chocolate instead of white chocolate and cherry pie filling instead of the raspberries ( that's just what I had on hand) and it turned out beautifully!! I baked it for an additional 25 mins, turned off the oven, let it in there for another hour or so, before letting it cool down on the counter until it was cool enough for the fridge. I had absolutely no cracks ( I did put a pan of water inside the oven though), and the cake was super smooth and creamy!! Will be making again!!

Absolutely AMAAAZING!!! This recipe was so easy and turned out just delicious. It looked fabulous with the marbled red and white top. However, I did use seedless raspberry jam instead of making my own syrup. But that was a bit too heavy maybe, because it made indentations where i had placed it on the top even after baking. But it still looked marvelous. I did use more white chocolate chips to enhance the white chocolate flavor even more. And as other reviewers advised, I melted the chocolate with the half n half in microwave, which was easy and hassle-free.

This recipe turned out PERFECT for me. I made cupcakes with an Oreo crust and baked them in  metal cupcake liners. 375 for 25 min.   I lightly mashed my raspberries and added a little sugar, as I think raspberries taste better when they are fresh. I added the raspberries to the cupcakes after they were cooled. Then I made a whipped cream white chocolate cream cheese frosting (2 sticks cream cheese, 1 small cool whip, 1 sm package instant white chocolate pudding mix, & 1 cup of milk. Beat it all together until fluffy) swirled it on top. I topped with white chocolate flakes/curls, and ta-da, they turned out perfect! They were all gone VERY quickly.

We've made this a couple of times now, and it is absolutely fantastic. People have not believed it was home made. The first time, I used another reviewer's suggestion and used seedles raspberry jam, heated in the microwave instead of making the sauce. It did not work well for me, the raspberry all sunk to the bottom of the cheesecake and melted into the crust. It tasted great, but didn't have the marbled effect I had hoped for. The second time I followed the recipe exactly and it worked much better. I always bake my cheesecake in a water bath, and it comes out perfectly cooked.

My daughter LOVES Cheesecake Factory's white chocolate raspberry cheesecake, and she said this recipe tastes exactly like it!  I made it for her 16th birthday yesterday, and it definitely added to the sweetness of her day!  The only thing I did differently was to use two cups crushed oreos and 3/4 of a stick of butter--not the whole stick--and the crust came out beautifully! I baked it for 55 minutes on a jelly roll pan with water in it (put foil around the bottom of pan so no water gets in), shut the oven off, and left it in for another hour without opening the door. The finished product had no cracks, the raspberry swirled top was so pretty, and it was creamy and delicious!  Thank you so much for submitting this wonderful recipe!

I made the mistake of reading other reviews that suggested to microwave the white chocolate chips with the half and half.  BIG MISTAKE. It came out VERY runny and so I put it in the saucepan to try to smooth it out, but that didn't really work. My suggestion: follow the directions exactly! When I put the runny mixture in the bowl with the batter, I beat it in and it mixed well, but the batter was extremely liquidy. This created a marbled cheesecake instead of the layers. I ended up having to cook the cheesecake in the oven for an extra 10 minutes or so. I followed other reviews and put a casserole dish of water on the bottom shelf underneath the cheesecake, then when it was finally done cooking, I just turned the oven off and let it sit for 45 min in the oven. Somehow, despite my mistake, it turned out to be the most amazing cheesecake I have ever made. I guess I just got lucky! It was so good, my boyfriend has suggested I start my own cheesecake business (ridiculous, I know). Anyway, my suggestion: follow the directions and it will be even better than my dumb luck!

I have only made a baked cheesecake once before & believe me, it wasn't anything like this!! Turned out so great, I wish I had taken a picture of it. RAVE REVIEWS!! Thank you & be sure to use the "water bath" to keep the cake from cracking.

Wow!!!  I can't wait to make this again!  It was SO good- my husband loved it!  Who needs the Cheesecake Factory when you can make this at home????  I look forward to trying some different mix-ins in place of the raspberry sauce for variety.

A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!! Used raspberry preserves rather than fresh raspberries. I placed the springform pan on a jelly roll pan with a little bit of water to avoid cracks, but of course some of the water got inside. No biggie though. Next time I'll put the pan with the water on the bottom rack. Can't wait to make it again!!!

Very good - my teenager said it was the best dessert he had ever eaten.  Had a problem getting the seeds separated from the raspberries so I will take some tips from reviewers next time I make it.  Thanks for the awesome recipe.

Wonderful!!! Seriously delicious.  I used a different crust though-with cocoa and vanilla waffers. My hubby specifically asked for a raspberry(his fav.) cheesecake  for his birthday and let me tell ya he was not disapointed. Thank YOU SOOOO Much!!

WOOHOO! I'm so thrilled I found such a fantastic recipe (haha, like it was me who did something). Seriously CindyAnn, this is awesome. Usually I can't get away with using low-fat cream cheese b/c it doesn't set up right when you cook it. But with the white chocolate chips in there it does pretty good!! I used a block of "Neufchatel" cheese and a block of regular (didn't need the third b/c my store bought crust was small. It remained slightly more creamy than regular cheesecake b/c of the Neufchatel, but my family loved it anyway! I'm all for "quick" things, so I just used a pre-made oreo crust with great result. :) Thanks again- this is the best. What a special treat!

Great Cheesecake! Reading prior reviews I made the following changes. For the crust I used 2 cups whole oreo's in food processor with 1 TBSP sugar & 1/4 cup melted butter. Used 6 TBSP seedless raspberry jam microwaved for a minute or so for filling.  Wrapped pan in foil and put in 13x9 pan with water up 1/4 way to springform pan. I only had fat free half and half and it worked great.  Lastly I defrosed some frozen raspberries, added a couple Tbsp sugar and mixed to get a puree, then add whole thawed berries to the sauce and spoon over each slice.

I have never made a cheesecake before but was impressed with the reviews and am a huge fan of white chocolate and raspberry.  It was indeed very easy to make following the directions exactly.  I used chocolate graham crackers for the crust.  The family was impressed as was I.  Great!

This was delicious, I made it for Fathers Day & was a huge hit with the entire family! I however did not use the white chocolate chips and instead got one of those bowls of microwaveable dipping chocolate(white) and added 2 pieces of bakers white baking chocolate and microwaved that up until melted then added in place of the chips & cream mixture. I also poured the rest of the raspberry sauce on top once cooled and topped with shaved white chocolate pieces. It looked good and tasted even better!

So pretty and delicious. I wasn't sure what to use for the crust. I see that many people are using oreos but i decided to crush some chocolate teddy grahams (in a gallon ziplock using my rolling pin) and it came out perfectly. I decided on 1 1/2 cups crumbs for the crust.(calculating the amounts of butter and sugar for this amount) I also took the suggestion of using a high quality seedless raspberry jam heated in the microwave. I followed all the guidelines to prevent cracking(greased the pan, used a water bath and left in the oven for 6 hours) Topped with whole raspberries and white chocolate curls. This was actually quite easy to make. Will make again for sure.

This is a crowd-pleaser!  My favorite part is the raspberry swirl and sauce.  To put it over the top, I added black raspberry liquor to the leftover raspberry sauce - amazing.  This was Mother's Day dessert and will be Father's Day dessert (by request).

Amazing cheese cake!  It's very good the original way, but also makes a great cheese cake without the raspberries.  Some other ways I've make this cheese cake is without raspberries, but I added a chocolate glaze to the top.  For the chocolate glaze: Melt 3 ounces of semi sweet chocolate with 1/4 cup of heavy cream.  Mix well and pore on cheese cake.  I've noticed that if you add the glaze to the cheese cake before it cools completely it will stop it from cracking.

I made this for mother's day and even my lactose-intolerant father went back for another slice! I didn't have a springform pan so I just bought two nine inch chocolate crusts from the grocery and it turned out AMAZING.

I'm a beginner baker and this cheesecake came out beautiful and tasted really good. I used low fat everything cream cheese, light half and half, used slenda...instead of cookies I used reduced fat chocolate graham crackers. I will post a picture soon.

First time cheesecake maker -novice baker.  My husband considers himself a connoisseur having driven around the country looking for great cheesecake.  He said it was the best cheese cake he has ever had.  I bring it everywhere now – and I get tons of requests!  I didn't change anything but did bake in water and put batter through sift to ensure it was smooth!  Truly amazing!!!

I've tried the Kopycat recipe for Cheesecake Factory White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake, and this is by far wayyyy better.

My husband is a huge cheesecake fan so I decided to stray from my usually recipe and try this one for his birthday.  Needless to say, there was NONE left! I had a ton of strawberries I needed to use so I substituted fresh strawberries for the frozen raspberries.  I also went with a nilla wafer crust, as hubby does not like chocolate crust, and it was still fantastic. Highly reccommend trying this recipe, just make sure you check out your cheesecake baking tips before you start!

I took this to a party and everyone raved about it!  I followed a couple of tips from the other reviewers: covering the bottom of the springform pan with aluminum foil, baking in a cookie sheet filled with water, and letting the cake cool in the oven with the oven door open.  It turned out amazing!  Thanks for the recipe; I'll definitely make it again.

Fantastic and so easy to make.  It was my 1st ever homemade cheesecake and it was definitely a hit!  Just a little tip to the other first-timers, read up on how to make a cheesecake that doesn't crack in the middle.  I didn't follow those instructions (placing the cake in a pan of water in the stove) and mine did crack in the middle.  Overall, who cares because it was eaten faster than we stared in awe of it!

This cheesecake was delicious and beautiful to look at.  I added a few extra ounces of frozen raspberries, which had the effect of making the raspberry swirl just slightly less sweet -- I felt that made flavor of the swirl "brighter" and more noticeable.

I'm giving it five stars because all my family raved and raved about it at a family gathering. I personally would give it 4 stars due to some other concerns expressed here, and one of my own: The cake itself is a tad sweet and a little on the creamy side. My personal concern is the texture. I think 2 cups of white chocolate chips melted gives it a slightly weird texture. I liked the other reviewers' suggestion to cut it to 1 cup; I'm thinking I might do that if I can next time. Also maybe a little flour would help. Otherwise, this is an incredible, and easy, recipe to make.

Very good flavor, but I wonder if I did something wrong...I found the texture to be a bit on the too-soft side.  But how could one go wrong with white chocolate, raspberry, and cheesecake?  It was a hit anyway!

I cheated and just used raspberry jam, and we couldn't tell.  Usually baking with white chocolate makes for a very sweet dessert, not the case with this cheesecake. I will definitely be making this again!

A really great recipe! I used chocolate graham crackers and doubled the raspberry sauce I made to serve over the cake after it was sliced. I also used parchment paper on the bottom of the pan and baked the cake with a water bath in the oven (not IN the water bath) and it didn't crack.

From someone who couldn't figure out the spring form pan! This was my very first ever NY style cheesecake.  I never thought that I could do it, thus I've always shyed away.  OMG !!!  I took pictures of the end result and I wish I could show you - particularly to those who still think you can't!  Fabulous, Fabulous - FABULOUS!!!  I researched cheesecakes in general and read every review.  I followed the receipe exactly, with one exception - the raspberry puree.  Berries are much easier to work with before you add extras.  Thus, I lightly boiled them for 5 min, while doing a "rolling mash" with a regular potato masher, then strained.  Put the juice back on the stove, and then added the cornstarch and sugar mixture (well mixed).  But I did have to add an extra 1/2 tbsp cornstarch to the sugar. Took me about 5 minutes max.  I will definately make this again (and again).  Will probably use only 1 tbsp of sugar in the orea cookie base.  And did I say how impressed and fabulous this recipe is?  PS: I cooked with a gas stove in a water bath, exactly at 55 minutes at 325.  Turned oven off, and left the cheesecake in the oven for 2 hrs to cool down. Fabulous!

I made this for my friend's birthday at work. Everyone loved it! Next time I would swirl the raspberry sauce in half through. When I put the second half of cheese mix the raspberry came to the top.

It was very good, however I did as others did and doubled the white chocolate and the raspberry sauce and will probably not do that next time.  I cooked it by putting foil on the bottom and in a cookie sheet with water cooked for one hour and then shut oven off and let it in the oven for another hour and it turned out perfect.  Great cheesecake the raspberry and chocolate was just a little overpowering from the actual cheesecake taste.

Oh, wow! This was absolutely delicious. I followed it pretty much exactly to the instructions and ingredients. The only thing I did differently is put it in a water bath (double wrap your springform pan in aluminum foil. place the cheesecake on a cookie sheet. put it in the oven and fill the cookie sheet half way with water). I had no cracking or sinking. While I was making the raspberry sauce, I added some raspberry preserves to thicken it up and give it a more tangy, rather than sour, flavor. I took someone else's suggestion of using  oreo cookies and cutting the sugar way down--was a really good sticking agent. I roughly put down the crumbs in the pan and then went back over it with a glass, pressing the bottom of the glass into the crust to make it really firm and so it doesn't fall apart. The other thing I did differently was I put all of the rest of the raspberry sauce on top of the cheesecake and baked it like that--not saving any sauce to drizzle on it. It turned out excellent this way. Loved this recipe!

I love this recipe! This was my first time ever baking a cheesecake, and with the help of some reviews of this recipe, it came out pretty decent.  One thing I have to stress though, is that if Oreo crumbs are going to be used without the additional butter, then they should be pressed EXTRA firmly against the springform pan so that it does not break and crumble. That's what happened to me... it wasn't so bad that it fell off, but some chunks of Oreo did fail to stay on.  And by the way, the water bath is simply the essential trick to baking this cake. My cake did not crack nor sink! I will definitely be making this again some time.

So I had a few problems with this, and they are as follows: 1. The crust stuck to the bottom of the pan! It didn't say grease the pan so I didn't and it turned out horrible. 2. I didn't strain the seeds from the sauce and I really hated the texture. I know these are all faults of mine so that is why I didn't rate it really poorly. Everyone in my house really loved it so I guess that is what counts! I want to try and make it again and see what I can do to prevent the mistakes I made.

I made this for my wife for Valentines Day.  It turned out perfectly (and I'm not a baker).  She said it was the best cheesecake that she ever had.  It was delicious.  A previous reviewer suggested to check it at least 15 minutes prior to the scheduled finish time - good advice.

I am rating this a 5 because my cheesecake tasted like a baby watson new york cheesecake...my mom is a born and raised NYCer and I think she almost teared up at the memories of this cheesecake! However I halved the recipe and combined it with Chantel's New York Cheesecake and cooked it according to Chantel's directions + a water bath.  Here is what I did for those that want it: •	2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese  •	2 eggs  •	1/4 cup sour cream  •	2 tablespoons all-purpose flour  •	1 cup white chocolate chips  •	1/4 cup half-and-half cream  •	1/4 cup white sugar

10 stars, this is to die for. ok changes to make 10++ crust: 2 cups crushed (I used my mini chopper) oreo cookies, 1/4 c melted butter and 1 T sugar. Put berries and 4 T sugar, cornstrach and water in blender, the strained thorugh a tiny stainer, seeds came out easy. I used an entire bag of white choc chips. Melted in micro with 1/2 and 1/2. I placed 1/2 of the cream cheese mix on top of crust, poured all of the rasp suace over it and carefully spooned the rest of cream ch mixture over top, making sure to cover all of the rasp sauce. As always baked in water bath 50 minutes and let sit in oven (do not open door) for 5 hours and then removed and placed in frig overnight, never a crack and to die for!!

Fabulous recipe! Following all the tips I was able to have my first successful cheesecake ever!- no cracking, and everyone loved it. I doubled the raspberry puree and think that is a must.

This cheesecake I thought was going to be a challange but turned out great.  The taste of the white chocolate was right on, I actually was hoping for a stronger raspberry taste (I love raspberries). Also, I was slightly disappointed at how thin the cheesecake was, but this was my first "water bath" attempt and think next time I may increase filling for a thinker cheesecake with the same density.  Over-all rave reviews from family, which is all I need!!

I've decided to perfect my cheesecake baking skills this year.  And I chose this recipe for January. I was not disappointed!  Amazingly creamy!  Excellent choice for a special dinner party.  I did the water bath method on this cheesecake to keep from cracking the top.  The only thing I'd do different would be to add more sauce in the center portion and to have a plan for the top swirls.  I think if I'd planned ahead, the top would have come out prettier.  I did use melted white chocolate along with the sauce to garnish the plate. Awesome!!!

Loved it. This was very good. I substituted a caramel sauce for the raspberry because I was trying to copy a cheesecake I had tried at the cheesecake factory.

This was AMAZING!  I made this for Christmas at my boyfriends house, and my boyfriends dad called me the next day to tell me it was the best cheesecake he had ever had! The only thing I did differently was that I used 6 tbsp of raspberry preserves instead of the raspberry reduction. Great time saver and still DELICIOUS! I cooked for 60 min then turned the oven off and let cool in the oven for another 60 min before refridgerating.

I served this for our family Christmas dessert and it was wonderful.  Everyone kept saying how delicious it was.  I used Oreo cookies for the crust (including the creme filling).  I did use a little less butter and a little less sugar in the crust.  Instead of using frozen raspberries, I used raspberry jam and just mixed it right into the cream cheese mixture.  That way it had the raspberry taste throughout the entire cheesecake.  Very delicious!!!  As others suggested, I wrapped the bottom of my springform pan with foil and then placed the pan in an inch of water on a jellyroll pan.  As the water evaporates it keeps the cheesecake moist and helps it to not crack.  After baking the cheesecake for an hour, I turned the oven off and let it sit in the closed oven for an additional hour.  I then placed it in the refrigerator for 5 hours before presenting it to the table to eat.  I also warmed up a little extra jam for guests to drizzle on their cheesecake.  Absolutely delicious!

I baked this cheesecake for my family and my in-laws for Christmas.  Everyone LOVED it!  It was my first time ever baking a cheesecake, and since I was baking two, I put the two cheesecakes in springforms pans on one shelf, and a pan with water in it in the shelf right under.  I used oreo cookies as the crust and scraped the icing off.  I am sure my family will be begging me to make this again for another family get together.

OH...MY.....GOODNESS...what else can I  say about this cheesecake.  DELICIOUS!  I made this for an office Christmas party and had requests to make it again for Christmas gifts.  

I did take other reviewers advice and use seedless raspberry jam also.  I might try to make it again with strawberry or some other flavor.

My cheesecake cracked and sank a little so next time I'll try a water bath and leaving it in a cracked oven to cool.  Other than the visual imperfections, this cheesecake was fantastic and my family loved it.

I have made this recipe several times and it has turned out great.  My husband loves it.  The only changes I made were 1) I used 2 cups of oreos and 1 tbsp of sugar and less butter for the crust, then I baked the crust by itself for 10 minutes at 350 then let cool 2) I used more water and sugar in the raspberry sauce and used it more liberally in the cake 3) I used about a half a cup fewer white chocolate chips and melted the rest down, wrapped in plastic wrap and reserved for topping 4)I cooked in a water bath then let sit in the oven for an hour after turning the oven off and opening the door to let some of the heat out 5) Finally for garnish I used the hardened white chocolate to grade white chocolate flakes on the top.
It is good out of the freezer as well.

This recipe was so delicous!! This was my first cheesecake and I was a little apprehensive but it turned out fabulous! I did use graham cracker crumbs instead of oreo crumbs and it tasted great. I wanted to cook the cheesecake in a waterbath but did not have a pan large enough to fit my 9 inch springform pan in so I ended up using the 8 inch pan to cook the cheesecake. It took about an hour and 15 minutes to cook and after it was done I let it sit in he oven with the heat off for about an hour. I then  let the cheesecake cool for about an hour or two and then refridgerated overnight. It turned out perfect!

This cheesecake is AWESOME!!!  Upon reading reviews, I used 2 cups of crushed oreos for the crust.  I didn't wrap my pan in foil and I should have because the butter from the crust leaked into the oven.  I turned the oven off after one hour and let the cheesecake sit for another hour.  It was perfect - no cracks,no falling center and the taste was so rich and creamy.  Let the cheese come to room temp before beating and do not overbeat.  I beat in the eggs with my hand beater on low speed, then mixed in the chocolate/cream mixture with a whisk.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe is delicious! My kids and I loved it! 

This is the first cheesecake I've ever made and it turned out perfectly. The texture was perfect.  

I did follow the suggestions of another reviewer who said to double the cookie crumbs, not add sugar to the crust, and to bake the crust 8 minutes before baking the cake.

The texture was perfect, and the cheesecake looked beautiful with the raspberry sauce swirled on the top and throughout.

I was looking for a cheesecake recipe similar to a restaurant cheesecake that I like. This recipe is amazingly close. I have made this for pot lucks at work and receive great reviews every time. I have even had people request that I make it for them to take home.

I have not tasted them yet, but from the other reviews, I'm not too worried. I made 1/3 of the recipe (the only difficulty was 1/6th cup, but otherwise it was simple). It yeilded 5 individual muffin-cup servings that are perfect for the dinner date I'm having with my husband on Friday! If anyone wants to try it, you press the crust into five muffin cups (well-greased), add about 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons filling, 1 teaspoon sauce, then another 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons filling. About 1/2 teaspoon does it for the designs on top, then there's about 1/2 cup left for serving. They were done in about 40-45 minutes. They look lovely, but they did "collapse" quite a lot after I baked them. This recipe was really easy and fun to make!!

This cheesecake tasted great, but the texture was not what I wanted. I made this and another cheesecake for a shower and people like both of them, but the other one was firm and this one was too mushy for me. I had cut it the night before and had even put the cut cheesecake into the freezer for 2 hours before the shower, but it was still too soft to look like I wanted it to. 
I will probably stick with my basic cheesecake recipe that I have always used and modify it with melted white choc chips and raspberries. I will use the method of boiling/straining that this recipe calls for since it is definitely much better tasting than using preserves!

I rarely bake, but I needed a birthday cake, so I gave this recipe a shot. It's a fairly laborious and time-consuming recipe, but the result was fantastic.

I used fresh raspberries instead of frozen. I did have a bit of difficulty straining the seeds from the raspberry mixture; make sure you have some good strainers before tackling this one.

This definitely lived up to everyone's praises in the reviews.  Friends said this was the best cheesecake they'd ever had!  I too followed the instructions on this site to bake it in a water bath and I have to say I'm on a cheesecake making frenzy b/c it works so well!  I didn't follow others advice on the raspberries (blending first then cooking) and wish I had.  That was a time consuming pain to try to mash the berries through the sieve w/ a spoon b/c they weren't straining on their own.  Will definitely do that next time.  I used chocolate chessman cookies for my crust and it was incredible, though I too made more crust than the recipe called for.  Will definitely make this one again!

I have been using this site for years but this is the first time I've felt so compelled to write a review. I made this as an emergency last-minute dessert and used only the cheesecake part of the recipe (3 pkgs cream cheese, 1/2 c sugar, 3 eggs, and vanilla). I topped it off with the raspberry sauce from this recipe. I didn't expect it to be anything spectacular as the ingredients are pretty basic, and I didn't get to try it until after I had already served it to my guests. I was shocked at how perfect the texture, density, and sweetness of this cake was. I then tried  it with the rest of the recipe and excellent once again! Everyone raved about it both times and the best part was, it did not sink or crack at ALL! So whether you're looking for a good, fool-proof recipe for a basic cheesecake, or a fancier cheesecake, this recipe is great for either one!

This was my first attempt at making a cheesecake and it was delicious!  I used graham cracker crumbs instead of chocolate to make it more of a traditional cheesecake, and doubled the white chocolate to make sure the chocolate could be tasted. I also used the recommended water bath method and did have any cracks at all.  Everyone loved it, but it was a bit on the heavy side.

I made this for my boyfriends b-day. He loves raspberries and I love cheesecake so it was the perfect combination. I have tried many recipes before, but this one was the BEST! Everyone complimented me on it. Had one or two cracks on top, but when i put the sauce and a few fresh raspberries on top, no one could tell. Will definetly make again. Thanks!

DELICIOUS! THE FIRST CHZ CAKE I HAVE EVER MADE.  COOKED IT FOR AN HOUR, THEN TURNED OFF OVEN, OPENED DOOR AND LET SIT IN THERE FOR ABOUT AN HOUR. (UNTIL IT SET UP).  I ALSO USED A 10 OZ JAR OF RASPBERRY JAM INSTEAD OF FRESH RASPBERRIES. OTHER THAN THAT FOLLOWED THE RECIPE TO A T.  THIS IS THE ONLY CHEESECAKE RECIPE I WILL MAKE. A MUST TRY!

I made this over the weekend and I was slightly disappointed that the chocolate didn't come right thru as I expected.  The raspberry sauce did taste very good though.  In the future I probably will add an extra cup of the white chocolate chips into the final batter so that the taste of the white chocolate is discovered in the cake.  Overall though, easy cake to make when you're looking for something creative to make.

I made this cheesecake for a July 4th get-together and it baked perfectly the first time. I used the water bath method and baked it exactly as in the recipe. It was very creamy and rich; everyone who tried it raved. It does look as if you bought it at a gourmet bakery. I used a cup of chocolate graham cracker crumbs and I had plenty of crumbs to cover the bottom of the pan. Make and enjoy!

This is a wonderful recipe. I used graham cracker crumbs, and used more than the recipe calls for. I also used a water bath and let the cheesecake stay in the oven for an hour or so. If you do this your cheesecake will not crack. Also I found an amazing springform pan, it is by Frieling. It has a glass bottom and non-stick sides, perfect cheesecake everytime.

Yum!  This is an excellent cheesecake. I baked it in a water bath and it didn't souffle up or crack, and the texture is wonderful and creamy.  I had some issues with the crust- the recipe didn't say to bake it first, so I didn't, and it turned into a sort of pudding, so next time I will bake the crust first.  But I am still giving the recipe 5 stars because even with the crust the taste is fantastic!

Absolutely amazing!  I'd give it more stars if I could.  This was not difficult to make and got rave reviews from everyone.  I happened to make it twice within a week and there was enough of the raspberry sauce left from the first time to make the second cake.  The sauce adds a nice bit of tart contrast to the richness of the white chocolate and cream cheese.

Contrary to all the recommendations, I used fat free cream cheese in an attempt to make this a bit less guilt-ridden.  It actually came out really well.  I give it only 4 stars though because I did not care for the crust.  A graham cracker crust would have been much better.

I would add 1/2 more batter to make a higher cake, but it was awesome. The cheesecake techniques article on this site was very helpful and worked perfectly as another review suggested.

I made this cheesecake for Easter. It was delicious. My whole family loved it!
It was time consuming, but a fairly easy cheesecake recipe to follow.
Very strong white chocolate flavor, but I might add more raspberry next time. 
Thanks!~*~PitBullFreak~*~

This cheesecake is fantastic!!!  I will be making this again very soon.  I did have to use 1/2 cup more cookie crumbs than the recipe called for; 1 cup is simply not enough to cover the bottom of the pan.

My goodness!  I'm in love w/ this cake.  I took the advice of some & used the jam instead of the bag of fruit over the stove(hello, I like fast). Followed everything else to a T...& was happy.  This is a staple if you want others to view you as a chef!  Period!

This was excellent!! I have never made a cheesecake before and I was really proud at how good it came out! I will definately make this again :)  Also, I followed all the tips (like with the water in the pan and foil around the bottom), used seedless rasberry jam instead of real rasberries to save time and made an Oreo crust...you maybe need about 15 cookies to cover the bottom nicely.

This was my first cheesecake, and following others' tips it turned out wonderfully. I used two blocks of neufchatel cheese and one block of cream cheese and fat-free half-and-half, and it was still plenty rich and delicious. Also, the oreo crust is a great compliment.

At first I was disappointed in the recipe. (My own fault as my expectations were high.) I didn't have a problem with the crust not being plentiful enough because I had no 9 inch springform pan. I used an 8 inch. The raspberry sauce is definitely a pain in the butt to strain. (I was using a sifter lined with a cheesecloth). It takes a bit of time but is definitely worth it. I found some organic frozen raspberries at Safeway. They were awesome. Personally I don't think jam could come even close to comparible. I baked with a water bath, as suggested by many. It cracked slightly anyways. No biggie. The first piece I tried had no extra sauce on top. I found that the raspberry flavour within the cheesecake just wasn't there... This was my first cheesecake so I thought that maybe I had made it incorrectly. I was a bit disappointed with myself and the cake. BUT the next day I tried another piece. This time I added extra sauce with it. PHENOMENAL! There was no disappointment with those bites, that's for sure. Everyone has different preferences. I didn't find that the cheesecake had a huge burst of flavour on it's own. But then again, how many cheesecakes do? Most are on the mild side I suppose. I'm a beginner when it comes to cheesecakes, so it's hard to really give advice. But I'll gladdly give my opinion! :) Over all, it's pretty alright.

This recipe was great. I used a premade chocolate crust the filling was a little much for it. I just filled it as full as I could then added raspberry designs to it. Since it was V-Day I made hearts on it.

The most incredible cheesecake. This as my first cheesecake attempt and (with following the water bath technique) everyone loved it. I will definitely keep this recipe!

I made this for V-Day and it was just so-so.  I used 3 mini heart shaped springforms, maybe this had something to do with the taste/texture.  The BF said that it wasn't one of my best :(  I will try this again, but in a 10 inch springform and will follow the suggestions of gringing oreos in the food processor.  At least it looked pretty!

This cheesecake was great.  I'm eating another slice as I write this review.  I used generic white chocolate chips, and it turned out fine.  It was a huge hit at the get-together I took it to.

This is worth 100 stars!!  I endend up only using 2x250g packs of cream cheese as that was all I had.  I only had 6 squares of white choc., so I substituted semisweet for the rest.  I did use the tip of wrapping my spring-form pan in foil and then placing it in a pan of water to bake.  I would definately recommend checking the "leak proofness"  of your pan before doing this.  Mine soaked up the water in the pan.  I just put the soggy cake in the fridge and it still tastes awesome.  Can't imagine it being even better!!!!

Absolutley delicious! I took it to work and got rave reviews, one person told me I needed to pass the recipe on to the Cheescake Factory, it's that good!  My only dislike was the top got really brown when baking which I am not use to seeing on a cheesecake, next time I think I may lightly cover the top with foil to keep the top from browing so much, it takes away from the prettiness of the cake.  To cover the top I brushed on some melted seedless raspberrry jam (which I used in place of making my own sauce) and sprinkeld the top and sides with white chocolate shavings.  I do recommend useing the water bath and real white chocolate bars, not the chips. Definitly read the reviews and the All Recipes tips for cheesecakes, I did and it was perfect! If I could give more than 5 stars I would!!!!

Delicious - co-workers enjoyed this one! For a baked cheesecake, this one is not too heavy. I used canned raspberries with sugar already added, so I didn't add any more sugar. It was hard to tell when it was done, and I think I over-baked it just a little. The reason I'm going with 4*s: the white chocolate was literally undetectable. Maybe following some of the other reviews (adding much more white chocolate) would solve that problem.

Not as smooth as other cheesecakes I've made, but the taste was very good. I took the easy route and used raspberry preserves. I also used chocolate graham crackers. Next time I will try an oreo crust.

This was quite good but I was expecting 'phenomenal' after reading all the reviews on here. :)
These are substitutions/alterations I made because of the limited range of ingredients in India--
1. I used just 1/3rd of the ingredients called for because imported Philly Cream Cheese costs 12 times as much as regular Cheddar!
2. I used a 6" glass pan to bake it in because our 9" springform would have been too big for reduced quantities. Since I wasn't too bothered with presentation this worked out alright- we just cut slices out of the bowl.
3.I used (imported) oreos for the crust and microwaved raspberry preserves for the sauce. The preserves stayed runny only for a little while when heating them on the gas with a little water before coagulating into jam again. 
4. I used Duke's White chocolate which tastes quite yummy otherwise but became rather gritty when melted and left aside. Next time I would melt it right before it had to be added to the cream cheese.
5. I used half light cream, half milk for the half-and-half.
6.And I baked the cheesecake in a convection microwave which seemed to work out alright. I had no cracks but when I left the cheesecake to cool it sunk in a little. I did not use a waterbath.
This is decadently rich, so I probably will not be making this for another year! Next time I will try a lighter airier summer cheesecake.

In one word, Fabulous! I took the advice of several others and used 1 1/2 c. oreo crumbs (removed filling). Also I baked in water bath. I used 6 Tbs of red raspberry pie filling which I thinned with a bit of water. It pays to read the reviews and follow advice of others with this recipe. Best cheesecake I ever made.

OMG!!  Yummy and show stopping!!!  I was skeptical about using a chocolate crust but decided to follow the recipe exactly the first time, then adjust, and I'm glad I did the chocolate went perfect.  I wasn't able to find chocolate cookies however, and just used chocolate graham crackers, which were yummy.  I baked it alloted time and left it in with oven off 30 min and refridgerated over night, perfect.

This was the best cheesecake ever. I made it Christmas Eve, and my family practically inhaled it..there was one tiny slice left afterward. I will definitely make this again. It was not overly sweet, and the raspberry sauce was incredible.

This was the best cheesecake I've ever had. I used sugar free rasberry jam, but I should have used more. I would recommend using around 6 T. I also used the recommendation of others and used 2 cups oreo cookies for the crust. I used the lighter cream cheese and splenda. As others I cooked my cheesecake in the oven for 1 hour and then let it sit for another hour.  Remember this must be put in the fridge for at least 3 hours before serving.

I read the reviews and took some tips and this cheesecake came out perfect!

Here's what I did that was not in the original recipe:

1. Used half the amount of sugar listed.

2. Used 300g of quality white chocolate melted with the cream instead of chocolate chips

3. Water bath (sort of). I put a deep cookie sheet filled with water on the next level below my cake pan. 

4. For the crust, as I cannot get oreo cookie crumbs I used arrowroot biscuits with 2tbsp cocoa added, same amount of butter and sugar.

The trick with making the raspberry sauce swirls is to not use too much sauce in one spot, otherwise it sinks into the cake. So drip it on over the entire surface and not just in one area.

I greased the sides of the pan and baked the cake for 55 min and let it rest in the oven for 7 hours, then put it into the fridge. It pulled perfectly away from the sides and no cracks on the top! Served 10 with generous portions.

Great recipe, its going to be our new "fancy cake" around here :)

Excellent tasting cheesecake. I used a water bath so that there would be no cracks in the cheesecake, and I gradually lowered the oven temperature  a minute or two before an hour is up. The gradual lowering of the temp helps in that the cake will contract slower and there is less chance of cracking. I then left the cake in the oven for about an hour untouched, and carefully tranferred it to the fridge overnight. The cheesecake was a hit! I garnished the cheesecake with chocolate shavings and a dollop of whipped cream. Amazing!

This was really good.  The presentation was nice as well. I made sure everything was room temp, and made sure not to mix the cream cheese too much otherwise it will cause air bubbles.  I baked until the outer crust appeared set and then turned the oven off.  The middle appeared to be a little "like jello" but firms up nicely in the fridge.

Perfection.  PERFECTION.  I have never had a better tasting cheesecake.  It performed 5 stars in every catagory, Texture, mouth feel, and especially taste.  Everything was perfect.  I baked it in a water bath and it turned out lovely.  Also, I used chocolate cookie wafers for the crust, omitting the sugar because they were sweet enough, and this lent a dark chocolate taste that contrasted perfectly with the delicate white chocolate of the actual cheesecake.  Thank you so much for the recipe.  It has earned a place on my Christmas Day menu.

This was awesome!  Better than I've had at a local posh restaurant.  I also used raspberry jam w/a tiny bit of water.  Everyone raved and my boyfriend has requested it time and time again.  I used Ghiardelli chocolate bars melted down and served the cheesecake with a white chocolate ganach recipe I found on this site.  I'm making it again this weekend and I can't wait!  Mmmmmm!

This was my very first cheesecake and it was fabulous! It was incredibly pretty and tasted just like the ones I used to buy (note- used to). I brought it to work and people from other offices came by because they heard about it. I did everything according to the recipe but I did wrap the bottom with foil so butter wouldn't seep out, added a water bath, and left it in the oven to cool for a long while. Definitely making again

This was incredible!  I am not a huge fan of white chocolate, but I still made this recipe exactly as written and it was great.  The chocolate and raspberries were a great combination!  I also love having the extra raspberry sauce to put over the top, it added a little tartness which complimented the sweetness of the cake.  Thanks for sharing such an easy to make and super tasty cheesecake recipe!

I have used the major name brand of white chocolate chips in the past and did not like them at all, so I bought a slab of white chocolate at a candy store and used that instead.  I'm glad I did--this was wonderful!

This cheesecake has been a hit with everyone I've made it for. With or without the berries, it's excellent. I've substituted in blackberries once, and used a graham cracker crust - both variations were excellent. The preparation of the berries takes time, but it is well worth it.

An excellent cheesecake.  Easy to prepare (as far as cheesecakes are) when you use a seedless raspberry jam in place of the fresh berries.  I used Polaner Sugar Free Raspberry mixed with a couple drops of water and it was perfect!

I made this cheesecake for a family dinner and everybody loved it!  My only problem was that the crust was soggy (half the people loved it that way) and during cooking, some of the filling actually oozed through the bottom of the pan and onto my oven.  I think next time I'll try to prebake the crust for 10 minutes to see if that helps. Great taste though!

I made this for Mothers Day.  Even though it was too rich for my taste (I like to make cheese cake with German Quark which makes it  lighter) the party of 25 thought it was  outstanding.  Already got requests to make it again.  I give it a 5 due to the overwhelmingly positive response.

This is one of the EASIEST cheesecakes I've ever made that produces a fabulous result.  I've made it on 3 separate occasions (2times for one person) and have gotten rave reviews.  Give this one a shot and you won't be sorry. Thanks for a great recipe!!!!

This was wonderful. I used an 11 inch spring form and made an extra cup of the crust mix. By using the 11 inch and the same amount of filling for some reason it fell in the middle. My dad sticking  his finger in it could have had something to do with that. I made extra raspberries and used those to fill in the dip in the middle. People were eewing and awwing about my little pond of raspberry sauce. They thought I did it on purpose! I have never had so many compliments on any one dish! Make this and be sure that you can tweak the recipe to what's in your fridge and it will come out delicious every time!

This was very good. I made it for Bunco and there were no leftovers. I used oreos for the crust which didn't turn out too well. The crust ended up too soggy. I still gave 5 stars because it was my fault. Next time I'll use plain chocolate cookies.

sooooo good!  Curls of white chocalate are easy.  Use a vegetable peeler on a block of chocolate.  Lovely in seconds!

Wow! What a great recipe this is. Made it for a birthday party, and everyone absolutely loved it.  I did use the raspberry jam, and also used chocolate graham crackers for the crust.  Great cheesecake, will definitely make again!!!

Made it with blackberries instead of raspberries and put a white chocolate ganache on top.  This definitely eliminated any problem of the white chocolate flavor being too subtle.  Everyone loved it!

First time I made cheesecake and it was great! I added another pkg of cream cheese to thicken it up a bit. When I added the chocolate chip mix, it sarted to harden again. I think my cream cheese was a little too cold. I used 1/2c more chips than it called for, but I think that made it a bit sweet. I used raspberry jam (seedless) in place of fresh raspberries. Alot of this sunk to the bottom. Next time I will try to thin it out so it marbles better. I also doubled the mix for the crust b/c it did not cover the pan. I would use a little less sugar in the crust because it came out sticky instead of crust like. But, it was a hit and everyone liked it!!  The raspberry preservatives can make it sweet, so I would not add sugar or buy sugar free. It was great! Top w/almonds & Whipped cream.

(HINT: If you are in a hurry to make this, then it will work because I only had about 5 hours.Using the raspberry jam saves alot of time. I cooked it @ 325 for 62 minutes and then let it cool in the oven for 15-20 mins then 15 mins on the counter, then 30 mins in the freezer.I had it in the fridge for 3 hours. It came out great! Was a little fluffy but it did not stick to the pan at all and my cake did not fall apart!! If you get a crack then once it firms, you can use a knife dipped in HOT water and gently put the crack back together. It cut wonderful and was very easy to serve. The 8 hours would have added some firmness, but it is possible to get away with only a few hour chill.)

Wow!!  This was sooooo good Cindy!!  I joined just so I could leave a review for this awesome recipe!!  If you are organized it doesn't take to long to put together, regardless every minute of preparation is well worth it!  I took for our family Easter today, 18 people, and everyone raved about it! They thought it was better that the pies that were purchased from some famous restaurants!  Like someone suggested before, be sure to put parchment paper in your pan to prevent sticking!  Again, 5 stars and this will definetly go into my favorites!!

the boyfriend informed me after trying this, that I must make it for him again! I ended up not having enough white chocolate chips, but I don't even think he noticed! and the raspberry sauce refused to strain, but it was still really nice. Thank you.

Oh my!  The best cheesecake ever!  Better than the Factory!  I baked for exactly 55 minutes and there were NO cracks and it sliced through perfectly.  My dinner guests were blown away and everyone took home leftovers!  Update:  this has become my "signature dish" when I entertain.  People go nuts.  However, I just noticed that it says 2c white choco chips - I always assumed that was 1 bag... its more than 1 bag.  I found when I used the full 2c, it was too sweet for my tastes.  1 bag of chips is perfect!

Cheesecake was very good.  Next time I'll double the crust - seemed a little thin.  I did the water bath as others suggested - note that if you do this the cheesecake needs to cook longer - about an hour and a half.  Will make again.

My boyfriend LOVED this but i thought it was just ok. it looked absolutely amazing when i put it in the oven but after just 45 mins it had a 1-inch wide brown raised edge crust, and cracked insanely. I did forget the waterbath (which isn't in the recipe anyway). I will make this again because i love raspberries, but with a waterbath and more vanilla in the cake :-) Thanks for the recipe!!

This has to be the best cheesecake I have ever made and that is say alot. I did sub the reaspberries with the seedless jam which turned out great. I also added extra oreo cookies for the crust since it was not thick enough. I reccommend that you also line the pan since the crust does seem to "leak".

I made this cheesecake yesterday and this was only my second time ever making a cheesecake and it was a little heavy (I hope that it was supposed to be that way), but none theless, it tasted wonderful.  My family loved it.  I will be using this recipe again.  I wonder how this would taste using milk chocolate chips and frozen strawberries instead of white chocolate and respberries?  I must give this a try.  If anyone tries it first, let me know how it comes out.

Soooooooooooooo good, I cannot recommend it enough.  The cheesecake has consistency as well as perfect flavor.  It's time-consuming, but totally worth it.  Next time, I will use seedless raspberry jam like other reviewers recommended and I will also experiment with different jam flavors.  
UPDATE: I used apple butter instead of raspberry jam and topped the cake with home-made caramel...DELICIOUS.

this is fantastic. it's not too sweet, which is a big plus for me. i scaled it down and used strawberry preserves instead of raspberries (very expensive where i come from) and substituted the half-and-half with a proportionate mixture of milk and butter. i also used square cake tins and small heart-shaped pans (lined with foil) instead of springform ones. turns out lovely everytime. will definitely use this  recipe again and again. thanks so much!

Delicious!  The only change I made was to use chocolate graham crackers for the crust, just because they're easier to crush. Thanks for the awesome recipe!!

Fantastic recipe - I made it for Thanksgiving and was asked to bring 2 more to the Christmas party!  I used seedless raspberry jam instead of the raspberry sauce mentioned in this recipe and it worked great with a lot less effort.

The taste of this cheesecake is amazing. I did struggle with the seeds though so on the next try, I might try some preserves. Used chocolate graham crackers (what I had) otherwise kept everything the same.  Turned out great.

this cheesecake was awesome!  I did a few things differently though.  instead of pouring half the batter in and swirling that, I just pured it all in and just swirled the top part.  when you cut the cheesecake the swirling goes all the way down.  also I baked it in a water bath and lowered the temperature to about 275.  this cheesecake tasted delicious. I will definately make again!

Simple (albeit labor-intensive) to make, but worth every effort! I used Oreo cookies for the crust and it was to die for.

This cheesecake looks like it came from a fancy restaurant- it is beautiful and should be saved for special occasions. It is time consuming and a little stressful, but defintely worth the effort.

I made this as a surprise birthday cake for a friend.  I can't actually comment myself on the taste as I didn't eat any of it, but everyone seemed pretty impressed by the taste.  I used an Oreo cookie base and substituted strawberries for raspberries.  The problem I had was it too forever to cook.  At least another 30 minutes on top of the recommended time.  I did adjust the temperature down though as I was using a fan-forced oven.

This cheesecake was amazing.  I've been told this is the only one I ever need to make again!  
I made 2 changes- used oreo cookies for the crust as others suggested and I substituted strawberries for raspberries...I'd recommend trying that if you are making this for any strawberry lovers.

This cheesecake is heavenly! I used fresh raspberries instead of frozen and substituted 1 cup of dark chocolate and 1 cup of mint-filled dark chocolate candies in lieu of the white. It was rich in taste, light in texture and the mint added just a hint of extra flavor. Thanks!!

Cooked w/o bath and it barely cracked (people who get upset about cheesecakes cracking...need something better to get upset about...).  Could use a bit more crumb mixture than called for to fill the pan bottom.  I microwaved chips for 45 seconds at 1000 watts, stirred, poured half & half overtop, another 45 seconds and then stir a long time (still easier than double-boiler) and it will combine.  Cake was in the fridge for 12+ hours (easy if you bake it night before and don't eat for breakfast :-p) and it set fine.  A very sweet cheesecake with some raspberry flavour, I think most of it comes from the sauce you add on top rather than what's baked in.

awesome cheesecake. All the suggestions were great: oreo cookie crust with 1T sugar and 1/4 c melted butter, the water bath, and more raspberries in the sauce. I do recommend straining seeds out rather than leaving the seeds and pulp in the sauce as one reviewer suggested. Also, 8 hours overnight in the fridge was just not enough. Took it into the work the next day and had to leave it in the freezer for about 3 hours for it to really set. The coworkers raved!

I didn't need such a large cheese cake so I cut the recipe in half and to save time used a store bought chocolate cookie crust...my mistake, take the time make the crust the store bought ones are too tough!  other than my "shorcut/mistake" it was devine, I had to print out a recipe for each of our dinner guests they were very pleased.  one of my guests is a self proclaimed cheesecake addict and said it was as good as one from Cheesecake Factory!  WOW!

This was a fabulous recipe! My church group truly enjoyed it. A bit time consuming, but well worth it. Be careful though once you put your first layer of the raspberry sauce on because once you start to put the rest of the cheesecake batter on top the sauce will tend to want to rise onyo the top. But by far two thumbs up!

I made this for my brother in laws birthday because he loves raspberries. Everyone loved it. I have a reputation for making pretty terrific cheesecakes (even took a class from a local cooking school in Cleveland) and my sister and my husband think that this was the best one I have ever made (mainly because they love raspberry so much). I withhold judgment because I don't like raspberry at all really. In there opinion this even beat Martha Stewart's recipe. I used oreo's for the crust with just a TB. of sugar like others suggested. I also doubled the sauce but did not use it all...probably didn't need to double it. No one any more over top because it had already.

This is one excellent and rich cheesecake. Everybody and I mean everybody loved this cheesecake. Next time, I will double the crust and sauce. It helps to have a great strainer to get rid of the small seeds. Be sure to taste the sauce and add sugar accordinigly. It is very easy to over sweeten it and mess it up. Use the waterbath for baking the cheesecake and definitley undercook it alittle (slightly undone/wobbly in the center of cake) in the oven. Let it chill in the refrigerator and it should come out perfect.

This cheesecake is awsome, I took it to work and my boss ended up taking the majority of it home.  Very simple to make, but my suggestion is to strain out the seeds before you add the cornstarch.  It was so hard to get the seeds out when the sauce was thick.  Other than that I loved it and I will make it again.

This is such an easy cheesecake recipe.  I made this for Valentine's Day and what a perfect choice for dessert.  I was worried about the crust as the crumb and melted butter mixture seemed too wet as compared to past crusts I've made but it turned out just fine.  I used Oreo cookies for the crust instead of plain choclate crumbs.  I suggest adding more than the 3 Tablespoons of rasberry sauce for the middle of the cheese cake layers.  I didn't think that was enough.  My raspberries were very tart so I added more sugar to my liking.  A defenite WINNER!

Fantastic!  This was a great recipe- taste wise and presentation wise!!!  I made this for our New Years Eve dinner and everyone loved it.  Although it did take a little bit of time. (Hour Prep, baking, and cooling) This recipe was well worth the time and we will be making it again!

I have to say I am not a baker, although since I made this chscake, it has inspired me to bake more. Turned out perfect! Have shared it a few times at the work place and received many rave reviews.  One thing I would experiment with this recipe is adding more fruit than the six tbsp. called for to enhance the fruit a bit more, otherwise, all thumbs up!!!

I made this to take over to my sister's place for a get together.  She and her hubsand liked it, my husband really loved it, I didn't care for it too much myself. I was kind of hoping it would be as good as the Olive Gardens.  Although I do have to admit I put white chocolate ganache on the top, which over did it..  I think it could have used more raspberry in it.

I am writing this a little premature because I haven't yet tasted it.  I made this for a party tonight and the looks alone are wonderful.  I did bake it in a water bath, baked for 70 minutes (too giggly after 60) and then let it cool for a few minutes in the oven after turning it off.  When I checked on it, it was a little brown.  Hopefully not overcooked.  So...would not recommend cooking as long if you leave in the oven to cool.  Even a little brown this is the best looking cheesecake.  I should have made two because I may not be able to wait till tonight.

This is an amazing cheesecake!  I was even told, by my aunt, that this was quite possibly the best dessert she had ever tasted!!  I agree, and have already had a request to make it again, less than one week later!  I can guarantee you will LOVE this!  (oh yeah...  I do reccomend using good quality white chocolate - and chopping it yourself - as that is the dominant flavor, and you want it to be wonderful!!

The flavor and consistency turned out great even though I thought it may not be firm enough.  It was a lot of work but only the raspberry sauce was tricky.  It took longer to get the sauce to thicken and it was hard to remove the seeds and there wasn't much sauce at the end of it all.  I would also recommend a waterbath since it did crack and cooked slightly unevenly.  Don't underestimate how well the chocolate crust will complement it.  I don't usually like a crust but this one was great.  Overall, I'd do it again!

Really good!!  We are making a cheesecake "Cupcake" cake for a wedding next week.  The bride went crazy for it.  I used a graham wafer crust in texas muffin tins for about 30 min, other than that followed the directions exactly.  Really great texture and flavor.  I topped each with whipped cream, a dollop of the raspberry sauce and then shaved white chocolate.

Absolutely Delicious!!  I made this for dessert on Easter and my family and I couldn't get enough!  I wish I had made 2!  The only change I made was I used used honey graham crackers for the crust instead of the chocolate cookies and I melted extra white chocolate chips with a little milk and half and half and drizzled it over top. I will definelty make this again.  My mom has already requested it for her 50th birthday, in place of a traditional cake!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I'm not much of a sweets person, but this recipe sounded like a challenge for me so I wanted to try it.  What I ended up with was the creamiest, most heavenly cheesecake imagineable.  I practically licked the plate after eating my first piece.  The actual preparation took a long time but was far easier than I had imagined.  I would definitely recommend this recipe to anyone who loves cheesecake or wants to impress others with their baking which I know we all do.  Also, I substituted graham crackers for chocolate cookies which worked just fine.  TIP: Strain the raspberries in a flour sifter to speed up the process considerably.

This was great, i made this and brought it for easter dinner and i looked like a gourmet chef!! I didn't strain the raspberry's because i didn't have a mesh strainer and it was still wonderful. I spread the rest of the sauce over the entire cake, the best ever. This was the first cheesecake i have ever made, and i will make it for years to come!! Thank you so much, you rock!!

Delicious and definetly worth the time and effort! Be careful when adding the white chocolate - I let it cool quite a bit before adding it to the cream cheese mixture.

Absolutely DECADENT!! I have never made a cheesecake before and this was sooo easy and good!!! I cooked it in a water bath and opened the door of the oven to allow it to cool. It didn't crack at all!!! I cooked it for about 10 extra minutes, and made double the raspberry sauce. I wouldn't add the raspberry sauce in the middle as the recipe says- I didn't care for the way it looked. When I added the rest of the cheesecake mixture, it pushed it to the outside and it didn't look as beautiful as I had wanted (I am a huge perfectionst). This cheesescake disappeared fast and left everyone talking!!!

Makes a very nice cheesecake, but a little too sweet and rich for our palette.  However, for the sweet-toothed raspberry-lover, it would probably be perfect.  For us plain cheesecake lovers, I would totally omit the additional sugar in the recipe - the white chocolate carries it in sweetness.  As well, the raspberry sauce turned out very, very sweet, so I would omit most of the sugar there as well.  Otherwise - the texture was perfect.

This cheesecake is awesome!  I served it at Christmas and everybody raved about it.  I made a graham cracker crust instead of using the chocolate cookies, and I swirled all of the raspberry sauce into the cheesecake.  Also baked it in a water bath to make sure the top didn't crack.

My husband and I are very picky cheesecake eaters and we fell in love at first bite.  The only change I made was that I used crushed graham crackers instead of the chocolate cookie crumbs. UMM!!  I cannot wait to make it again.

Not bad, but I'm a very picky cheesecake critic.  I quartered this recipe to make a miniature cheesecake, perhaps that's where I faltered.  I will defnitely try it again though.

I've made this a couple times, and though it always cracks on top, no one seems to care!  It's fabulous!

I think this cheesecake would be better with just a graham cracker crust. It was ok.

yum yum, I made this for a get together and it was fantastic.  However i did not have a mesh strainer and left the seeds in the raspberries and it still turned out great, will make again for sure.

EXCELLENT! I've never had a recipe so raved about. If you strain the raspberry sauce a little at a time getting the seeds out isn't a problem.

A very nice cheesecake. The raspberry sauce was not too sweet and was not only delicious but very pretty drizzled lightly over the cheesecake.  I made it a couple of days before I served it for flavors to blend.

I made this cheesecake for a baby shower and got rave reviews. I didn't find it really hard to make like some others commented. Whenever you make anything other than a regular New York cheesecake, it is a little more work. You could pump up the raspberry flavour by adding some raspberry liqueur. For Mel_Jade, half and half is cream with 10% milk fat, or table cream. You could substitute whipping cream (35%mf) if you wanted a richer cheesecake.

Wonderful recipe,  my daughter requested a white chocolate cheesecake for her birthday this year and this is going to be one I will use over and over again.  Everyone loved it.

The raspberry sauce is also wonderful on ice cream too.

This is not a BAD cake but I just thought it was average.  It seemed like lots of work for the same result as a regular cheesecake.  I could not notice the white chocolate too much.  Don't get me wrong...it is good but for me, just not worth the effort.

This recipe was a great success. I'm a novice cook, but I got rave reviews on this cheesecake with all my gal pals. Everyone had assumed I bought it!
This recipe is even better with dark chocolate...very creamy.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit.  Even the non-cheesecake people had some and loved it.  I used chocolate graham crackers in the crust and andded another tablespoon of sugar to the raspberry sauce.  The presentation was so pretty and it tasted wonderful :)

I decided to make this cheesecake for my husband's birthday this year, as he didn't want a traditional cake w/icing.  So, I got this recipe, and made it over the weekend, as a trial, to see how we both liked it and if it would be something he would enjoy on his birthday.  
I poured the raspberry sauce over the top of the cheesecake, as opposed to drizzling the plates with it..This cake was absolutely DEVINE!  Tasted better than the similar cheesecakes you find in restaurants and places like Sam's Club.  It was relatively easy to make, especially since it was my first one.
My husband ate the majority of it, and then blamed me cause the cheesecake was gone after he ate the last piece.. :)  Funny man.. :)
Thanks for the great recipe!  I will definitely make it again.  Next trial is a turtle cheesecake.. cause he has to test both of them to decide.. LOL.. :)

Served this for an anniversary dinner and got rave reviews. It really is easy to make and it superb! Next time I make it I will probably double the raspberry sauce though. I didn't quite have enough, and it's the crowning jewel of this cheesecake.

Very good recipe!  I did try it with 2 - 1/3 reduced fat cream cheese and 1 - no fat cream cheese.  It does change the texture.  Instead of the dryer, firmer texture, it is very soft and creamy.  Although we still enjoyed it, next time I will try it with the regular cream cheese.  Since I will only spend this much time on a cheesecake for a special occasion, it might as well be the 'real deal'.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was the BEST cheesecake that I ever made.  I made it for a friends birthday and they said that it was better than the cheesecake made by popular restaurants.  I substituted the frozen raspberries for fresh strawberries (because they prefer strawberry cheesecake) and used a graham cracker crust.  Other than that I left everything else the same.  It turned out fabulous.  I garnished it with chocolate dipped strawberries and whipped cream.  Will definantely make again!!!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!

AWESOME...Family still talking about it. I used (2) Fat-Free and (1) 1/3 less fat cream cheeses, plus a water bath and it turned out great. I was worried about the middle not being done, so after it baked I turned the oven off and let it set with the door closed. Then cooled on the counter and refrigerated for 8 hours.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Five star cheesecake!  No one tried this without raving about it, and it was only my second real cheesecake ever.
Added more sugar to the raspberry sauce, as it was quite tangy.  I didn't have a cheesecloth or a strainer, so I left the seeds in the sauce, but put it through the blender to break them up a little.  Not a problem for anyone who ate it.
Aside from spilling the Oreo crumbs on the floor, it was very easy for such a beautiful result!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

This is an incredible cheesecake.  It's much easier to make than you'd think and tastes GREAT.  My husband can't get enough of it and a friend who DOES NOT like cheesecake ASKED for the recipe.  I used chocolate graham crackers for the crust and it turned out great.  I made extra raspberry sauce which i used to garnish the plate along with fresh raspberries and white choclate shavings.  Also, the 2nd time I made this cake, I only had half the amount of half and half and needed substituted the remainder with whole milk.  The result was still delicious though the texture much stickier.  This is a very romantic dessert... perfect for an anniversary or Valentine's day!

This is SOOOOOO GOOD!!!  My husband wants this for his birthday cake every year.  I don't take the time to make the raspberry sauce though.  I just melt a jar of Smucker's simply fruit seedless raspberry jelly and use it.

I honestly don't know where I went wrong I followed this recipe to the letter and it took twice as long to bake the raspberries burnt and it smelled awful! I then let it cool and chill I felt I couldn't serve this to anyone once I tasted it not even our 2 year old would eat it. In my opinion it tasted like chalk or burnet popcorn was very hopeful because of the many positive reviews. I think the raspberry sauce went into the cake and made it very mushy it was WAY WAY to sweet and the chocolate overpowered the cheese the whole thing just fell apart. Finally I decided to make it again it turned out the same way I would not waste your time on this and I would not make it again I also didn't care for it at all. You may think I am being a bit harsh which I don't mean to do but honestly this was so gross I wish I could rate it zero stars I couldn't eat this if I wanted to I through them both away. Did I mention that it tasted gross?

Made the recipe exactly as written with a few adjustments. Instead of cooking the Raspberries with 1/2 cup of water, I used 1/4 cup of chambourd & 1/4 cup of water with sugar and cornstarch. Then after refrigeration overnight, I added a drizzle of ghirardelli dark chocolate melted with half & half over the top of Cheesecake then garnished with whipped topping, fresh raspberries and ghirardelli white chocolate curls. Scrumptious doesn't even describe the flavor explosion in my mouth. Thanks for submitting this recipe.

I used oreos for crust. About two rows of Oreos, with filling and all, 1/4 cup of butter, and 1 tbsp of sugar. Turned out surprisingly fantastic! I let it cool in the oven first and only got on small crack, but it was at a swirl, so I don't count it. It browned a little. Next time I will try to do a water bath. This is the first ever cheese cake I ever make!

Made it almost to  instructions except added 1 extra egg yolk.  I forgot the extra sauce was supposed to be served on the side so it all ended up on the top.  I followed the helpful hints of bringing the ingredients to room temperature and  baking it in a shallow waterbath after the bottom was wrapped in foil. It turned out picture perfect with no cracks.

I rarely comment on recipes, but this deserves it. I've made this cheesecake three times now, and EVERYONE raves about it. Last night someone told me that this was the best cheesecake he ever had. I followed the recipe to a tee but used Oreo thins for the crust. Not sure of my spring form pan size, but it's big. So I doubled the recipe (this made a "mile-high" style cake... mmmmmm) and used an entire package of Oreo thins and ground them in my mini food chopper.  No, I did not reduce any sugar or butter. Sue me on the calorie count! If you decided to make this, you're obviously not counting them. Anyway, I placed the prepared crust in the freezer while prepping everything else. That seemed to prevent the crust from sticking to the bottom of the pan. I took my time prepping the sauce and melting the white chocolate. Oh my gawd. My advice, follow the directions exactly - take the time prep and deseed the sauce and to melt the white chocolate. Put extra sauce in the cake - you'll have plenty left and it definitely will not go to waste. Use the water bath. This cheesecake is absolutely decadent. I just had some, which reminded to write this.

I love this recipe! I made it in a 10 inch springform pan, and doubled the crumbs. Per other reviews, I wrapped the bottom in heavy duty foil, and set it in a water bath. After it finished, I turned off the oven and propped the oven open about two inches. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

I made this cheese cake but used a too small of a spring form pan. Did not cook all the way, and to trim some off top. Will make again using a larger springform pan. Tasted great though

I make this often especially for holidays and birthdays. It always gets rave reviews. Instead of foil around the bottom of the pan that can potentially leak, I use a crock pot liner. It works great!

Disappointing. I followed the instructions as written, but my cheesecake turned out to be a mushy mess. It tastes good, but it essentially turned into a cheesecake pudding rather than a cake. Not what I was going for. This was not my first cheesecake, either. I've made plenty of them over the years and never encountered a problem like this. I suspect the raspberry filling proved to be too heavy for the rest of the cake. Whatever the reason for the disaster, I won't be repeating this one.

Very tasty, indeed! But, the edges turned a little funny looking after it cooled.  Sort of a shiny brown-ish appearance. Almost like overdone meringue.  It didn't taste overdone or nasty...just took away from the visual appeal. If anyone has feedback about why, I'm eager to learn!
One alteration: I couldn't find any chocolate cookie crumbs, so I crushed chocolate graham crackers.  Worked well.

This is the most incredible cheesecake I've ever eaten! I brought this for Christmas dinner and it was such a hit! Everyone just raved about it. Even the few who don't care for raspberries loved it! Personally I don't usually care for white chocolate, but it's not too strong in this recipe.

I used oreos for the crust (minus the filling). As another reviewer suggested I read Allrecipes article called how to make a cheesecake (search google allrecipes how to make a cheesecake) . I highly recommend reading that. I followed all of those techniques, including the water bath and letting the cheesecake cool in the oven for an hour with the oven off (I did leave the door cracked though). 

I will be making this every year for Christmas. Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!

It was actually really good but instead, I would make more of the crust because when we cut the cake, you couldn't even see the crust. The sauce went great with the cake, because of its tartness compaired to the sweetness of the cream cheese filling. Great cheese cake overall!

Sooooo good.  After reading reviews, I used Oreo cookies, half the butter and no sugar in the crust.  I also used seedless raspberry jam.   Y sister-in-law thought I bought it at a bakery!

This was so very good. I made it for Thanksgiving since I’m so sick of making pumpkin pie that no one really eats (I’m sure it’s because I make mine with no love and extra resentment) so I searched a cheesecake recipe and found this. It definitely has a lot of moving parts to making it but it’s so worth it. Everyone LOVED this cheesecake. I had no expectations with it at all so I was pleasantly surprised. I’ll definitely be making it for Christmas as well.

Amazing! I did everything the recipe said, except made the crust gluten free because I have Celiac. I used Pamela's Gluten Free Graham Crackers for the crust, and it was amazing. I also did the cheesecake "water bath" that is on this site, and used seedless raspberry jam to save time. DELICIOUS!!!

Not sure what I did wrong but it is still in the oven for another 1/2 hour...definitely not done yet. I checked all the ingredients and didn't add too much liquid. Kinda sad but hoping it will taste goo, it sure does smell good! Only 3 stars because of how long it is taking....

This recipe is the first cheesecake I ever made. Both times I have made it, everyone who tasted it raved about it. This most recent time, it was all cleaned up in one setting; my guests were shamelessly scraping the bottom of my springform pan for the remaining bit left behind. 

I made mine with Oreo cookies for the crust and Ghiardelli white chocolate chips for the cake part.  :)

This is a very yummy cheesecake. I just made it last night and everyone loved it. The one complaint I have is that there were pockets of the raspberry sauce inside the cake that caused the surrounding cheesecake to not cook fully. It was still very good, but the next time I make this (and there WILL be a next time), I will simply drizzle a little off the raspberry over the top after pouring the entire mixture into the pan, instead of adding half, then the raspberry, then the rest. I think that will eliminate the undercooked pockets.

Really good recipe. I just wish the extra touches on the images would be included in the recipe. Is it embellished with frosting or whipped cream? Because following the recipe doesn't get you that picture.

Fantastic recipe! I have made this many times at my work (lodge) and it always, always gets so many comps. I don't use springform pans for my cheesecakes, just pie tins, so I am careful about baking time. I wish I could attach a pic of the 80 servings of this from the other night :) Thank you for this great recipe!

ADDING another review! Made this in individual cupcake sizes; with Reynold's paper/foil cup liners. Pressed about a Tbsp. of graham cracker crust firmly on bottom; baked only a few minutes, 'til fragrant. Spooned in the cheesecake mixture, sprinkled a few frozen raspberries and randomly pushed them down into the filling. Watched the baking time carefully, removed when just barely set. Sampled one when still slightly warm, SUBLIME !!! The recipe made 26 cupcake-sized little cheesers :)

Turned out amazing. Wrapped bottom in foil and cooked in a water bath. Then turn off oven and leave in for an hour. Have made this cheesecake a couple times. The last time I made white chocolate caramel as requested for husbands birthday, so no raspberry sauce. He said it was the best cheesecake he has ever had!

I’ve been baking for a few years now and cheesecakes and creating new exciting flavors is my passion. This recipe is great except I would NEVER use “chocolate chips” in baking at all, maybe cookies but even then I do authentic chocolate flavor with Swiss brand when baking for loved ones (or anyone) it’s a side business at this point. The only reason I mention is that because this recipe is beautiful and requires time and effort, I would honestly use melted white chocolate bar and brown sugar!! (White sugar crystallizes, and does not melt! You’ll get a grainy taste using both chocolate chips and white sugar. These ingredients have a lot of processed oils in them for preservatives, which will overshadow other expensive ingredients like quality cream cheese and butter ( use high fat butter and cheese, and cut the sugar by half cup if you don’t want to taste just sugar (chocolate melts easy when you put in a bowl over boiling water) and the cake comes out so creamy and rich, people will think you spent a fortune of time and $$ to create magic. White chocolate cheesecake with fruit is my chief choice of customers among birthdays, sweet 16, baby showers, and even weddings. Source: I’ve spent over 5 years creating a cheesecake to my perfection. This post is to give advice for any new brave hearts trying to spend a good day or 2 in the kitchen for this cake, or for anyone baking with cream cheese for the first time. Not like a regular cake!! Your flaws and your effort is not going to

I will definitely make this again. It was only the second cheesecake I've ever made, and everyone thought it was as good as a professional. Didn't take that long to make and was super easy. Recommend.

Instead of raspberries, I used blueberries.  I used the blueberry sauce recipe from the  white chocolate blueberry cheesecake recipe.  It was a hit and I'll be making this one again!

I followed this recipe exactly and we didn't think it had much taste. It was kind of bland. The cheesecake baked nicely, though, and the raspberry sauce had a nice flavor.

The cheesecake was fabulous! I read the negative reviews before making it and they all had to do with the cheesecake being too sweet, so I skipped the 1/2 cup of sugar and it was perfect! I used Oreos for the crust and didn't add sugar in the crust either. I bought a package of frozen raspberries and put more of the raspberry sauce in the cheesecake then specified in the instructions. I brought it to my boyfriend's parent's house and they had friends over for dinner and everyone raved about it! I did get a crack in the middle but I didn't follow the special cheesecake instructions to make sure it doesn't crack.

I have made this a few times. It is a very pretty dessert that people always seem to like when I bring it. I think that you really need the unsweetened raspberry sauce with this to balance it out nicely, as it is very sweet without that sauce to top it.

I always make double the sauce for extra when serving. I also double the crust, because no crust is thick enough it seems. Goes really fast, great around the holidays!

I will most definitely be making this again. I did make one small change which was to add an extra cup of crushed Oreos to the base and reduce the sugar by two tablespoons. the melted butter drips in the oven, so be sure to keep a tray or something in the rack underneath. or bake it in a water bath to avoid cracks and spilt melted butter.

Would give it a 5, but had to make some modifications.  Definitely use at least 2 cups of cookie crumbs-butter still ran out the bottom of the pan, so I'll use less butter next time.  I also had to let mine bake for about 70 minutes and then let it sit in the oven for half an hour. I used the seedless raspberry jam as suggested by another reviewer and it worked very well.  I also used low-fat cream cheese and it still tasted very rich.  I am not a professional baker, but am known for my cheesecakes and have learned a few tricks over the years. Baking it in a bath helps with baking consistency and preventing cracks.  My son said it was better than the Cheesecake Factory.

I added an extra cup of white chocolate chips and increased the 1/2 and 1/2 by an eighth of a cup.  I used Oreo cookie crumbs, cream and all with 1/4 cup melted butter and 2 tbsp of sugar.  I beat the 3 eggs before adding to eliminate air in the cheese cake.  I sprayed the bottom of the springform pan, put in a cut circle of parchment and sprayed the parchment.  I doubled the recipe for the strawberry sauce. I put the frozen strawberries in a blender with the sugar and then strained it into a saucepan.  I added the cornstarch and boiled for 7 minutes or so.  I surrounded the bottom of the pan with foil to keep the water out.  I put the pan on a cookie sheet filled with an inch of water. I baked at 325 for 50 minutes then turned off the oven, opened the door and left the cake in the oven for an hour.  I refrigerated overnight.  To remove the cake from the pan,  I dipped the cake in a pan of boiling inch of water.  I was then able to remove the cake from the pan bottom and slide the parchment out.

Did not care for this.The base was so thinly spread in my tin that the rest of the mix poured out the tin. The remaining cheesecake took an age to bake as well because it was so thick. Won't make this again.

Excellent!  I did as others recommended and used seedless Raspberry jam and then Oreos for crust. Everyone loved it!

I've used this recipe a handful of times. I tried it today with a layer of oreos on top of the chocolate chip cookies. OMG!

Turned out amazing. I did the water bath and also put wax paper in the bottom of the springform. Also just microwaved raspberry jam and it worked fine.

Wow.  This is amazing!  I have only made cheesecake once before I made this one and this recipe is fantastic.  I followed the suggestions of some reviewers and doubled the crust recipe...I used chocolate graham crackers instead of chocolate cookies because I didn't want to use Oreos and I couldn't find any plain chocolate cookies.  My store was also out of frozen raspberries so I used frozen mixed berries (raspberries, strawberries and blackberries).  I did everything else exactly as stated and it turned out amazing.  My family thought that I bought it from a restaurant!  Even my nephew, who isn't a big fan of cheesecake, thought it was delicious.  It did crack, but I wasn't too worried about that.  And instead of garnishing with chocolate curls, I melted some extra white chocolate and drizzled it across the top.  This recipe is a sold 5-stars, or more.  Definitely give it a try!

Love this recipe!  It's always a hit!  When I am going to be rushed for time I will crush my Oreo cookies (keep them in a zip lock baggie), and prepare my raspberry sauce a day or two in advance...it really saves on time when you are ready to bake your cake. ??

I made this for Christmas Dinner and my husband said it was the best cheesecake he ever had.  I did use a slightly different method for baking - covering bottom of pan with foil, then putting the pan in a larger pan and adding an inch or so of hot water; I also turned the oven off after one hour and let it set in oven for another hour.    That is the method I use for all cheesecakes and seems to cook better.

I made this for Christmas and it was wonderful! I did add extra crust because the amount in the recipe didn't cover the bottom of my pan. This is definitely a new favorite.

This cheesecake went over really well! My husband said it was the best he'd ever had. I changed it by using 2 cups of oreos, with 1tbs of sugar and a dash of salt. I used more raspberry sauce in the cheesecake than the recipe calls for. Next time I'd add a tbs or 2 of sour cream or a little lemon zest, I thought the tangy cream cheese flavor was tempered from the white chocolate,and I was missing that a little bit. Overall, a solid recipe! Also, I made the raspberry sauce a few days before and kept it in the refrigerator.

I can’t eat raspberries so I made that on the side for my husband. Thick, creamy, and delicious!   I have made this before and use a water bath each time - never cracks. I’ve also added toasted macadamia nuts on the top. Such a great recipe!

The raspberry sauce is very good, the cheesecake is mediocre.  The white chocolate isn’t really noticiable. I was disappointed.

However, I will make the raspberry sauce for ice cream. It’s very good.

I cut parchment paper for the bottom of my pan as it makes it much easier to remove. Used an extra 1/4 cup of cookies crumbs and a 1/2 tsp more butter for the base. Also added just a little bit (roughly 1/4 tsp) of lemon zest to my white chocolate mixture.

Followed other reviews and it came out fantastic! Make sure to leave eggs and cream cheese at room temp for about an hour first. I use 2 cups crushed Oreos, only one tablespoon sugar, and 1/4 cup melted butter. Also Used seedless raspberry jam warmed in the microwave for 10-15 sec to save time. Melted white choc with half and half. Wrapped foil around the bottom of my pan & placed the pan on a cookie sheet. Then I filled the cookie sheet w/water. I baked the cheesecake for  60 MINUTES then tapped the side of the pan with a spoon...if it jiggles as "one piece" rather than like jello, it's done. Turned the oven off & let the cheesecake sit in the oven for another hour. It was a hit at Thanksgiving last year and making for Xmas this year!

Amazing recipe! We did blueberry instead. Did this for Thanksgiving and it was gone in no time! We are going to make a cherry one next. I put the water in the cookie sheet pan as was suggested by a reviewer. I also made mine in a glass pie plate since I did not have a spring form pan and doubled the crust ingredients as to have enough and it turned out beautifully!!

I'll definitely make it again.  I substituted the chocolate cookie crust with a traditional graham cracker crust and it was great.  The one confusing part is determining what counts as 'set' when the cake is in the oven.  I don't think it's realistic or desirable to wait for the whole thing to be solid all the way through while in the oven and not at all 'jiggly'. I waited 'til there was just a little jiggle and by the time it had cooled in the fridge overnight, it had a perfect consistency.

I've made this numerous times. I double the crust using chocolate Famous wafers as I like larger crusts. Everything else as shown and it comes out beautifully each time. Family raves over this and 16 slices is never enough.

I wanted to do a sort of peppermint bark cheesecake last Christmas and wanted to use a white chocolate cheesecake base. I decided to use this recipe, minus the raspberries. It was a little sweet for me, but still good. I am sure with the raspberries it would have tasted even better. Will definitely keep this one and give the full recipe a try.

Delicious.  Used chocolate graham crackers for the crust and followed the tips on baking a cheesecake in reviewer comments (water bath and allowing to cool in the oven with the door ajar for an hour).  It turned out perfect first attempt.

This is a great recipe. I used vanilla Oreos and butter for the crust, leaving out the extra sugar. St the end of the baking time, I turned off the oven and left the cheesecake to cool. No cracks, and no sinking in the middle.

I’ve never made a scratch cheesecake before this one and you would think I’ve been doing it all my life!!! The family raves were well worth the time spent making it. I read the tips and tricks first and opted to cover the bottom of my springform pan with tin foil and bake on a cookie sheet with water. No sinking —- It came out beautiful and was sooooo good!

This recipe makes me look like a dessert chef.  I avoid making the raspberry sauce myself by just subbing with high-quality seedless raspberry preserves

A few quick notes. I had to cook longer than what it says, about 15 minutes, however once it had cooled was very hard to cut, over cooked perhaps? Regardless my wife absolutely loved it, along with her steak, smashed potatoes and baked asparagus, was a pleasant surprise for her !

I have been making this twice a year for the last 7 years.  One each year is for a cake auction that supports the youth at church.  Last year this cake sold for $200. This is because each year of the previous 6 the cake would be shared with a few other people.  Everyone loves this cheesecake. Best cheesecake ever.

I’ve made this recipe a handful of times now, and it never ceases to amaze me how delicious it turns out every time! My family and friends love it and are always impressed by how fancy the finish product looks and more impressed by how delicious it tastes. For the crust I use Oreo cookies after removing the creme and break them up with a small food processor. At first I had some trouble melting the chocolate, but have since just used a small saucepan to bring the half and half to a warm temperature and added the chips slowly.

I despise making crust, so I bought 2 premade crusts. The first time I followed everything exactly except for the crust. The texture was amazing, but the raspberry flavor was light. The second time I used canned filling. It turned out wonderfully with much less effort and mess.

Fabulous cheesecake recipe. I followed another reviewer’s tip on baking it in a water bath. The consistency was wonderfully creamy from the center to the edges. It’s a great foundational recipe to experiment with new flavors.

I blew people away with this cheesecake! Did as other reviewers suggested with Oreo crust, seedless raspberry jam, and put it in a water bath. I divided the recipe in 2 and baked them in 2 disposable 8 x 8” tin pans lined with parchment. When they were cooled, it was a cinch to pull them out of the tins and cut. To get clean cuts, dip a sharp knife in hot water, wipe off blade and cut. Repeat each time you make a new cut. I received orders to make this for people at my husband’s office. It was THAT good!

This cheesecake is a fabulous treat. Creamy and delicious, and beautiful too. I didn't have raspberries so I used blueberries and they worked beautifully. I also only had vanilla cookies for the crust, so I simply added some cocoa. A real treat!

Beautiful and delicious! 

I used about 7 oz of Oreo (makes about 2 cups), crushed in the food processor, 1 tablesppon white sugar, 1/4 cub butter. Next time, I may even cut back on butter further. The crust was really rich and moist. I think I like it a little drier. what makes this rich and creamy cake perfectly balanced is the chocolate cookie crust and having 2 cups is an absolute must. My cake had a lot on the edge and that was by far the most delicious part because of the right balance. The crust was thin at the middle part and it made a big difference - it was definitely lacking the balance. Next time, I may even use 3 cups of Oreo (would be about 11 oz).   

Definitely blend the raspberry (thawed) with 1/2 water, remove seeds with mesh strainer (this way, it yields so much raspberry sauce. It still takes a little patience with the straining. But it is worth it!), then boil with sugar and cornstarch.  

I was not sure if the marble swirls come out right, so I did not put all the white chocolate sauce into the batter. I some for a second chance to get it right just with the chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce on the top of the cake after baking, but there was no need. The raspberry marble swirld came out very pretty and it was not too hard at all. Very fun! So I ended up discarding the back up white chocolate sauce. Probably about 1/5 of the entire sauce. The cake was still very chocolatey and delicious. 

I had a lot of raspberry sauce leftoever even after serving gene

One word.  Fantastic!

My first time making cheesecake and it turned out amazing!  A few people that tried it didn't believe that I made it.  I baked it in a water bath and did the slow cool method by just opening the door of the oven an inch or so once it was done, until completely cool.  Then right into the fridge.  I don't know if that prevented cracks or not, but I happily didn't have any.  I felt like the white chocolate was so subtle to the point where I couldn't taste it.  If I didn't put it in there myself, I probably would not have known it was even in the cheesecake.  Not sure if I would omit it next time, but it certainly was VERY subtle.  If I make it again, I might try a graham cracker crust.  Not because the Oreo crust isn't awesome, but because it would focus the flavor a bit more on the raspberry and cheesecake itself.  No matter what crust though, give this a try.  You will impress yourself as much as I did!

Delicious! I should have read most of the tips on here (you should too before you make it!), as my cheesecake had a couple cracks in it, as well as being just a tad bit brown around the edges.

The tip I did follow was to leave it in the oven to set for an hour after baking and turning the oven off. (I’ve wondered if this caused the edges to brown a bit and should have baked at a lower temp as others said). Then let it sit out on the counter until it is cooled to room temperature. Afterwards, put it in the fridge overnight or for at least 10 hours. This worked very well in my favor and probably saved it from more cracks and other issues. 

Overall,  I’d say I did pretty dang well for my first try. Flavor wasn’t too rich or not rich enough. Everything was perfect and I didn’t change a thing in the recipe. I look forward to making this again! It was a hit for my family. Thank you!

This is the first time I made a cheesecake and used this recipe. It came out so well ! Note to first time cheesecake makers: the cheesecake will rise from the middle and balloon when it is cooking in the oven. So make sure not to over fill your mold/tin. I made that mistake and as a result had a slight dip. But it's not that visible and the flavor is amazing so it didn't matter. I was skeptical about using frozen raspberries because I thought using fresh ones will give it a better flavor. But I was proven wrong. I went with frozen ones since I didn't want to deviate from the recipe much and I'm so glad I did. Definitely going to use this as my base recipe in the future to try out other flavors.

I really liked the flavor of this cheesecake.  My only concern is that it cracked ( I think because of the long cooking time and the recipe does not require a slow cool down in the oven ) Also the  white chocolate chips didnt melt completely so there was a bit of a crunch to the cheesecake. I my make it again and melt the chips before adding them and let the cake cool down in the oven,  But again the flavor is great!

I LOVED this recipe!! Will make again!! I made a few small changes: I used gluten free Oreos as crust and used fresh raspberries instead of frozen. The Oreos already had the sweet cream filling so I reduced sugar to 1 Tbs but used 2 cups so I could spread the crust up the sides. I also cut the butter amount in half for the crust. I had to cook this cake for about an hour and 15 mins.

Delicious recipe! Everyone in the house absolutely loves it. I baked mine in a pan of water and used a Graham cracker crust. I heated up homemade raspberry preserves for simplicity. This recipe makes too much for a simple 9" store bought pie pan, so be aware for that. I was able to make a whole other one in a 4x7" glass pan as well.

I’ve made this several times. Today I made the crust out of 1 1/2 cups of crushed Brownie Brittle and 1/4 c butter (no added sugar). It turned out amazing.

This cheesecake is delicious! I did not have half-and-half so I used 1/2 Heavy Whipping cream and 1/2 2% milk and baked it in a water bath. The flavor is so good and the texture is perfect. Because it does not use sour cream, I feel that it tasted less tangy which, to me, is better. I also used blueberry crackers (i had on hand and needed to use up) which added to the berry taste. I bought more white chocolate so I can make some more. This time though, I would double the crust. Thank you for sharing this amazing and simple-enough recipe!

pretty good, I did use the jam suggestion.  I did the water bath but mine still cracked.  I had to cook mine an additonal 20 min. Would probably only cook additional 10 next time.  additional 1/2 cup cookie crumbs.   Would make again .

My husband said it was the best he ever tasted. It was a big hit at brunch. Thanks so much! We didn't have raspberries so I used melted 
seedless jam. Worked out great!

Absolutely delicious! Followed the recipe to a T. Only change I made is to bake it in a water bath to avoid cracking. After it finished baking, I left it in the oven to cool off with the oven.

I made this cake for the first time and it turned out well for my first cheesecake ever made. For some reason, probably because I was constantly opening the oven to check on the status of the cake, it took about 70 minutes to finish. As a result of this, there were a few cracks in the cake but I simply covered them with raspberries. I did not bake it in a water bath (I had no idea what that even was at the time) so this could have also contributed to the cracks.  I think if you are not an experienced cheesecake baker, you will want to check out some cheesecake tips before making this recipe. The recipe does not specify these things, but you should really know what you're doing before you get started. For example:
1) beat the cream cheese BY ITSELF until it is light and fluffy, before adding the other ingredients.
2) use a hot water bath. If you don't, the cake won't look horrific, but it won't look perfect.
3) it's okay if the center is still a little jiggly at the end! DO NOT bake until the entire cake is set. For me, the edges of the cake browned and set very quickly, but the center was still jiggly. You want a small portion of the center to still be jiggly. The entire cake should "jiggle as one", but the batter should not be runny in any way.

Overall, any errors in this recipe seem to be my fault and a result of my lack of research. I think this recipe is wonderful, because even I, a person who had never baked a cheesecake before, managed to cook up something eatable.

Delicious! My whole family loved it! I ate it for breakfast the next day, haha. 
No tweaks needed.
Followed a few suggestions from other reviews as per cheesecake baking rules, about baking with a pan of water in oven and leaving it in oven for an hour to cool.
Also doubled the crust/base recipe but may do 1.5 times as much instead of 2 times next time. 1 was too thin. 2 was too thick.

I made this for Valentine's Day birthday dinner for a friend and it was huge success. Like others I used Oreos plus melted margarine  for the crust. An entire package of Oreos--it was great. I also used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and seedless raspberry jam for the swirl. I followed the recipe as written but used a water bath. I had to bake it an additional 25 min. for it to set up. Then I turned off the oven, cracked the door a few inches and let it sit for about 35 min. Covered with plastic wrap and put right in the refrigerator.  Everyone loved it so my changes did not seem to diminish the yummyness and helped a little with the fat. I will make it again and thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is amazing u made it for my uncles birthday cake and ge loved it. You can make it with or without sugar for the raspberry sauce. If you don’t add the sugar it is just a more tart dessert.

I’ve been making this recipe for years. I cut a few corners though saving tons of time and sacrificing none of the flavor. I use raspberry preserves instead of making the raspberry sauce and microwave the white chocolate chips with the half and half at 30 second intervals, stirring between intervals. I also followed other cheesecake baking tips and wrap the bottom of the pan in aluminum foil and set it atop a cookie sheet with water. After an hour I turn off the oven and let the cake set for an hour then let it sit on the counter until it’s cooled then I cover and refrigerate it over night.

This cheesecake is unbelievably delicious! Now, I made a couple of very slight changes. I opted for a Graham cracker crust instead of the cookie crust,and I left out the raspberry altogether. Mine is just a white chocolate cheesecake with Graham cracker crust. Also,and it may just be the way my oven is,I baked it at 275 degrees Fahrenheit for approximately one hour, and then turned off the oven and propped door open and left it that way for over 2 hours. The texture is absolutely perfect. Best cheesecake I've ever made. I will definitely be using this recipe again!

Took other recommendations & used 2 cups of Oreo cookie crumbs. Didn’t have half & half, used heavy cream. Also, instead of baking glaze on top, used glaze after chilling mixed with Grand Manier, totally covered top with glaze & raspberries. Perfection.

This was my first cheesecake, it turned out Great. I read the tips on this site for cheesecake. I picked up a few tricks -I  only used a beater to add eggs, just folded the rest, only enough to combine.- I used a water bath (I have a silicone cake pan that fit perfectly around the spring form, so didn't need foil) -Cooked for 1 hour, turned oven off,  opened the door to vent a minutes , then shut and left in 1 hour. It came out Perfect. Texture smooth, delicious . I got Rave reviews from everyone. This is my new secret weapon, it will impress everyone :)

Fantastic!  Followed the suggestions in the top rated review and kept some sauce on the side, which meant the following changes: (a) cooked it in a large ceramic pie pan as we didn't have a springform pan (so we lined it with parchment paper to assist us in lifting the cooked cheesecake out at the end prior to slicing), (b) used the waterbath method and sat the pie pan on a larger pan and filled that half way with water, (c) cooked it for one hour and then turned the oven off and left it for almost two hours.  We also used only about 1/3 of the raspberry sauce in the cheesecake itself.  Didn't have a strainer so we put the sauce mix in a blender to smooth out most of the seeds.  It was an amazing topping for the cheesecake and everybody loved it!

I have made this cheesecake twice now and my family loves it!  White chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake has become a family favorite in our home and each year I find a different recipe, but this is the one I will stick with!  I made the crust a little thicker on the second one, and to save time I used raspberry preserves lightly melted then cooled, for the raspberry filling.

I made this for Christmas dessert.  It is fantastic.  I had to use chocolate flavored graham crackers for the crust because it was what the grocery store had and I thought using oreos sounded gross with the cream filling.  I did take the advice of a few reviews and used raspberry preserves to save time but I would not do that again.  It really did taste like jam.  My advice is to follow the recipe and take the time to make the raspberry filling.  I will definitely do that next time.  Also, follow the tips on how to bake a cheesecake.  Worked like a charm!

Maybe I just got lucky where other reviewers didn't, but I followed the recipe as written and it came out great (although I was worried at first because it didn't seem like the filling had set when I took it out of the oven - but the top looked like it would get burnt if I left it in any longer). Baked it for an hour, let it cool for maybe half an hour, then into the refrigerator overnight. When I make it again, though, I'll use parchment paper, as the crust stuck to the pan quite a bit.

No changes, however I did not like this recipe.  That being said my family loved it, especially my husband.  This was very rich.
I made this in an 8" spring form and forgot to wrap pan for a water bath so to avoid a sinking cheesecake I cooked this on middle rack (on wire vented cookie rack) with my pan of water on lower rack.  I watched this carefully, cook time was not long enough (I'm not high altitude) as I let cook for additional 45 minutes then left in oven for an hour with heat turned off.  The cheesecake looks beautiful.  I won't make this again as flavor is not there, but the cake is VERY rich.

This was my first cheesecake making experience. This recipe was very easy to make. The hard thing about cheesecake is the baking!! I did the recipe with the berries on the side with a standard graham cracker crust. I also paid careful attention to temperature and timing, and it came out perfect.

I've made this several times. I use the raspberry as a topping. I've used it in the cheesecake but I like it better seperate. I use a water bath and bake it in the center of my oven. I've used this recipe to make mini cheesecake also.

This is my first time submitting a review on allrecipes and hands down this is a winner!  I do not change anything but shave some white chocolate on the top. People always want the recipe and can't believe I made it because it looks like it comes from a high-end bakery.

This was rated the BEST by my family that always loves my desserts.  I used the Nabisco chocolate wafers for the crust and did the seedless raspberry jam instead of the other method.  I topped it with raspberries and shaved white chocolate.

Made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it! What I loved about it was it wasn't overwhelming sweet and filling.  Some cheesecakes taste really good but make you feel so stuffed afterwards... this one did not, just tasted really good??. My mother in law thinks I could make some money and sell these now.

Super yummy! I’m normally a true New York cheesecake purist, but figured I’d try a flavor for this Thanksgiving. I put foil around the sides of my pan, and placed it on a cookie sheet with some water added. My only comment would be I don’t feel like the Oreo crust did anything for it. It was very sweet. I think a graham cracker crust would have been better.

Nice creamy chhesecake with the right amount of firmness. I used dark chocolate cookies and added macadamia nuts to the crust. i also added a bit of rum to the sauce for an extra bit of dimension.

This recipe was simply amazing! My only complaint was there wasn't that much of a white chocolate taste to it. I used a whole bag of white chocolate chips, next time i make this I will use a bag and a half and see how that turns out

Delicious!  Used thin chocolate oreos (w/out cream filling) for crust.  Used a 10 inch pan, not 9.  Cooked for an hour wrapped bottom of pan in aluminum foil and sat it in a cookie sheet with water in it.  Turned oven off and left cheesecake in the oven for an hour more.  Refrigerated for 4 hours and piped some whipped heavy cream in dollops in middle and around edges.  Everyone loved it - said it was the best cheesecake they'd ever had. Thanks for this recipe!

Excellent dessert.  I used modifications others had made.  These included substituting six tablespoons of heated raspberry jam for cooked raspberry sauce.  I also used two cups of Oreo crumbs, one tablespoon of sugar and 1/4 cup of melted butter for crust.  Served it for a party and got lots of requests for the recipe.

Absolutely Phenomenal! I made the recipe with the suggestions of using raspberry jam/preserves (warmed 6TBSP in microwave for 20 seconds), also microwaved the white chocolate chips with half and half, stirring after 20 second intervals until smooth. I did wrap alluminum foil around base of springform pan and placed on a jelly roll sheet pan with water in it while baking. I baked it for 50 mins, then shut off oven and let sit in there for another hour. My husband is a bit of a cheesecake connoisseur, and he was head over heels impressed and LOVED it! thank you for a wonderful and pretty easy spectacular dessert! FYI -- at 50mins I gave the cake a little jiggle and only a one inch ring in the periphery did not jiggle, but the whole middle did. I was a little nervous it would not set up, but it did perfectly, not a single over or under done area.

I made this for some of my co-workers and got great reviews.  I had one person tell me that this is better than what she gets at Cheesecake Factory (I assume Fresh and individual portion vs frozen or mass produced batter).

I could not find the chocolate cookie crumbs so I purchased two prepared pie-tins with the chocolate graham crackers crust.  I reduced the baking time to 40 minutes.

I changed up the recipe a bit. I added an extra brick of cream cheese and another egg. I left the seeds in the sauce and added all of it into the cheesecake. I separated the cheesecake batter and sauce into 3rds so it was more integrated! It was delicious!

I have made this recipe multiple times and it is excellent as written. If you use the shortcuts such as using whole Oreo cookies and raspberry seedless jam, it saves time, but it is not as scrumptious as the original recipe. Either way it remains my go to dessert for special occasions

This was absolutely delicious with an exceptionally smooth and rich consistency. I found the slight tartness of the raspberry sauce to be very complimentary to the sweetness of the white chocolate. I only made one alteration ingredients wise and that was to use 2 Cups of chocolate cookie crumbs instead of  1 and accidentally not adding sugar because I simply forgot. I think it turned out great with those alterations. I did, however,  make a few  changes as far as preparations go. First off, I prebaked the crust at 375 degrees for 10 minutes to help ensure that it not shift when pouring in the filling and also to create a better seal in the pan. Next, I wrapped the outside of the pan in foil and placed my cheesecake in a roasting pan and then added hot water up to about the center of the pan. Water baths are a great way to ensure even cooking and reduce the chance of cracking. I baked mine for about 60 mins and then shut the oven off while leaving the door slightly cracked. I let the cheesecake sit in the oven until completely cool and then wrapped and refrigerated it. Doing this reduces the chance of your cheesecake sinking in the middle. It turned out perfect! The flavor and texture of this cheesecake are fantastic  as long as you prepare it properly. If you've never made a cheesecake before, a waterbath can sometimes seem difficult or worrisome regarding leaking but I highly recommend that you not skip this step. It really does make a huge difference and I think you will be

The cheesecake was good, had to make some modifications. Needed to double the oreos,  and butter for the crust. Also the white chocolate taste was ever so faint, so next time I will probably be doubling the amount of white chocolate. Other than that a very tasty cake!!

So good! The only changes were I used fresh raspberries instead of frozen, and a graham cracker crust instead of the chocolate. Tastes and looks like it came out of a restaurant. This is the first cheesecake I've made like this and it won't be the last. Thank you for this recipe!

Fantastic!!  I did double the crust, as many reviewers recommended and will do that again.  Otherwise the crust would be very thin.  I baked mine in a 9 inch springform pan, as directed (many reviewers baked theirs in a 10 inch).  I wanted it to be deeper/taller.  I also followed the recommendation to wrap bottom of pan in foil and bake in a water bath for one hour, then turned the oven off and left the cheesecake in the oven for another hour with the door cracked in hopes of preventing splitting.  It still split a little, but it was exactly on a swirl of raspberry so maybe it was unavoidable.  It came out absolutely divine!!  Oh, and I went through the trouble of making the raspberry sauce.  Well worth it!!  I did follow a suggestion to cook down the raspberries with the sugar and water first, strain, and then add the cornstarch to thicken.  So good!!

I used this recipe for a standard chocolate cheesecake. I didn't use the ingredients for the raspberry sauce however it sounds yummy. My kids just wanted basic chocolate. I used chocolate chips and a can of sweetened condensed milk instead of the half and half. It was delicious!! I will try the recipe as stated someday for the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake as I loved the consistency of the chocolate. It was sweet and creamy.

Very good cheesecake, but the crust was completely soggy!  Not sure it if should have been baked a bit first, before adding the cheesecake filling, but that might have helped.  Next time, I will use seedless raspberry preserves instead.

I will definitely make this again!! Melt in your mouth cheesecake! I used pre made preserves to cut down on some prep time.  I also used graham crackers for the crust.  I also wrapped the base of my pan in tin foil, placed the pan in a roasting pan with some water in the bottom.  This method increased the baking time a bit but the cake did not crack on the top.  The beautiful berry swirls remained intact.  Be careful not to overbake.

One of the best cheesecakes I've ever tasted and my guests loved the presentation.  I served it with the remaining coulis and fresh raspberries.  Be warned  ... it is very rich.   I used oreo cookies as the base as some other reviewers did,  baked it in a hot water bath with the pan wrapped in heavy aluminum foil and once it had finished baking I turned the oven off and left it there with the door ajar for 1 hour.  Spectacular!

I made this to serve on Easter. I made a couple of changes as suggested by other reviewers. I used raspberry preserves in place of raspberries and I used Oreos for the crust and cut back on the sugar. I don't know what went wrong but my crust was soggy and I couldn't taste the raspberry flavor in the cheesecake. I drizzled raspberry preserves over the cheesecake when I served it and the flavor really added to the cheesecake but I could not detect raspberry flavor in the cheesecake. The white chocolate wasn't sting even though I added an extra cup of white chocolate chips. Sigh.

Made it twice. 2nd time turned out much better (see pic) I only used 2 packages of cream cheese instead of 3. This got rave reviews from friends! For the best cheesecake, do not over beat!! Once the eggs are in, mix it so lightly until just incorporated. This prevents air from getting in and causing cracks. I do place a pan of water on the bottom shelf of the oven however I've never gone to the trouble of placing the cake in a water bath and my cheesecakes come out perfect with no cracks at all. I believe the cracks come from the air at the beginning, and how you cool it. Open the oven door once oven is turned off, leave it 5 mins, then pull the cake out and leave it to cool to room temperature. Voila, perfect cheesecake.

This is one of the better cheesecake recipes that I have made.  I was very pleasantly surprised with the outcome.  When I first try a recipe I always follow the recipe exactly then sometimes I tweak it to fit my personal taste.  This one does not need any tweaking.  But just for kicks and grins I may try a different crust, maybe a graham cracker or a chocolate wafer crust.

I used CLEMSONMAV's tip and used oreos with the cream in for the crust. Everyone raved about this and it was my first one. Restaurant grade perfection.

O... M... G... This was soooooo good! My husband has celiac disease, so I made this gluten free. I just used gluten free oreos as the crust, everything else was the same. I'd add a little less butter to the crust next time since it leaked out all over the pan I put underneath it (so happy I did that or there may have been smoke/fire). A layer of parchment paper on the bottom of the springform pan was a lifesaver! I may try to cut a strip to go around the sides next time so there won't be any sticking there, even so, it didn't stick too badly. But after it was done baking, I let it sit in the oven with the heat off and door open for an hour and there wasn't much cracking on top. Now I need to find new flavors to substitute in this recipe because it's fantastic!

This is like pudding that tastes like a pure white chocolate bar, and is too sweet, with a hint of raspberry. Many have stated the same thing. I don't know how anyone likes this. I guess those who like it don't know how a cheesecake is supposed to be. It is supposed to be firm, not like a pudding pie. It also should taste like a cheesecake with a little white chocolate and raspberry added and not like eating a pure white chocolate bar with a hint of raspberry. I have an excellent cheesecake recipe and I have made many great tasting and perfectly textured cheesecakes. The cheesecake part of this is close enough for it not to be pudding. It has to be the chocolate and raspberries. No water needs to be added to the raspberries, they have enough of their own. Using raspberry jam like some reviewers said is a good idea. There is no need for half and half in the chocolate either. Just melt it.  1 cup of white chips is enough. Doing all this should remove a lot of  the water and allow it to cook like and have the texture of a regular cheesecake. And also not be overpowered by the white chocolate.       About cheesecakes in general: I have never had a cheesecake cook in an hour. I don't know why they all say around an hour. This is worse with the extra moisture. Others have said there is a tutorial on this site and it seems right.  Don't just go by when a recipe says something should be done. Learn how to tell when different foods are done.  Check it with a knife or toothpick to make

I made this for Christmas dinner and it turned out perfect . I did bake in a water bath and let it set for an hour inside the oven after the baking was done. Then transferred into the refrigerator covered with plastic. The results were excellent.  Now I have to make one for my husbands birthday (by his request), Thanks Cindy.

We love cheesecakes! I made this for Valentines Day. The only change I made was that the amount of sugar in the raspberry sauce. I didn't think 2 tablespoons was enough. I did 1/2 cup of sugar. It was about right. Definitely not too sweet!

I doubled the Oreo crumbs, butter and used 4 T of sugar for the crust. I also used raspberry preserves, which I microwaved before straining. I really think I overcooked this but with a water bath I had no cracks. This was my first try for using a water bath, which is very easy. I will always use it going forward to save myself any trouble with the top of my cheesecake cracking. I topped the cheesecake with a ring of raspberries and a ton of white chocolate shavings (so I guess a cracked top would not have matter that much anyway!). This cheesecake is excellent. I will be making it again.

Amazing.  It turned out fantastic!! I used 2 cups of crushed oreo cookies as recommended by others and didn't add sugar to the crust. For the raspberries I used pure seedless jam and that turned out great! I also added more to it than the recipe suggested because we love raspberries.    Was a huge hit! Definitely making again.

Its amazing!! I'm making it for the third time today, and my family always crave it for occasions. Here is the modified recipe I se based on the reviews upon this recipe and my personal experience:

•	1&1/2 tablespoon white sugar 
•	1/4 cup butter, melted
•	1 (10 ounce) package frozen raspberries 
•	3 tablespoons white sugar 
•	2 teaspoons cornstarch
•	1 Cup water
•	2&1/4 cups white chocolate chips
•	1/2 cup half-and-half cream
•	2 large (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened 
•	1/2 cup white sugar 
•	3 eggs
•	1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions
1.	Place a cookie sheet inside before closing the handle, then Wrap foil around the whole pan.
2.	In a medium bowl, mix together cookie crumbs, 1&1/2 tablespoons sugar, and melted butter. Press mixture into the bottom of a 10” inch spring-form pan.
3.	In a saucepan, combine raspberries, 3 tablespoons sugar, cornstarch, and water. Bring to boil, and continue boiling 5 minutes, or until sauce is thick. Strain sauce.
4.	Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). In a metal bowl over a pan of simmering water, melt white chocolate chips with half-and-half, stirring occasionally until smooth.
5.	In a large bowl, mix together cream cheese and 1/2 cup sugar until smooth. Beat in eggs one at a time. Blend in vanilla and melted white chocolate. Pour half of batter over crust.

I have been making this cake for years now. So grateful for the recipe.  I too had trouble at the beginning but followed the tin foil wrapped around the the cake pan idea.  I love this recipe and so does my family.

Definately a keeper! Changes made: bake using the water bath method.  Directions found here: http://omgchocolatedesserts.com/baileys-irish-cream-cheesecake/
Additionally I used fresh raspberries, I didn't remove the rasberry seeds, and I mixed in all the rasberry goodness into the cake.  Made some whip cream and used the rest of the fresh raspberries I had as a topping.
The results were amazing and the whole family absolutely loved it on Christmas day.

This was my first time making cheesecake, and it turned out amazing! I think it needs a bit more refrigeration, because I refrigerated for 8 hours and it was very crumbly when I tried to cut it. The next day it held its form better.

The recipe made a lot of filling, so I was able to make one cheesecake plus a pan with some cheesecake bars. It worked out since I doubled the crust, like many suggested.

I made it for a New Years' party and people liked it. My mom LOVED the taste and couldn't stop eating! 

I definitely will be experimenting with more cheesecake recipes in the future.

O. M. G.!!!!  My family LOVES me so much more today than they did yesterday. (Of course I'm totally kidding about that but it's probably true!!). I made this cheesecake and it was divine!  I'm talking take a bite, shut your mouth, close your eyes, take a deep breath and exhale all the way orgasmic YUMMY!  Everyone raved about it. I actually made two - and took one to a party and kept the second one for our family. The first one had a few cracks in the top but that did not affect the taste at all.  On the 2nd cheesecake, I followed another Reviewer's recommendation and cooked the cheesecake for 1 hour and then turned the oven off and allowed it to sit in the oven another hour before I put it in the refrigerator to cool. I also  used fresh raspberries for the topping because they were in season along with whipped cream and let me just tell you..."this cheesecake was the rave of the party."  I have a feeling that I will be making this cheesecake a lot more often as it will be requested at special events.  Do yourself a favor and make this for your special someone. It is absolutely delicious!!

It tasted very bland. The raspberry sauce needed more sugar to counteract the bitterness. I have made much tastier cheesecakes that did not need a sauce on top to give the cake flavor.

I used oreo cookies and doubled the amount in the recipe like other reviews suggested and the crust was perfect. I cooked frozen raspberries but also used some raspberry jam suggested in other reviews. The jam had a much stronger flavor. I would have rated it a 5 star but I don't think you could taste white chocolate very much. I will probably make again using all raspberry jam and more white chocolate.

It tastes great but may be too rich for some because of the white chocolate. So maybe better in bite sized cupcakes? It's also more expensive because of the white chocolate but the flavour is great so in the future I think I'd make just the cheesecake with the raspberry and sprinkle the white chocolate on top. I froze the leftover raspberry seeds and sauce into an ice cube tray to use later for tea or sangria which I'm pretty excited about.

Amazing cheesecake! New favorite! I used chocolate graham crackers for the crust without any additional sugar, and doubled the raspberry sauce. Only complaint from my husband was I only made one. It's a perfect blend of sweet and tart, refreshingly light as well.

This cheesecake was delicious. I, too, read the tips for baking a cheesecake and I had wonderful success. The foil placed around the cheesecake and baked in a water bath, allowing the cake to remain in the oven for an hour with the oven off and deciding a fully baked cake is one that jiggles like jello are a few of the tips that I used. The cake was creamy and irresistible!

This was just amazing. I cut the baking time by 5 minutes and turned the oven off. I let it cool in the oven for an hour and then cooked more at room temperature. It was beautiful- no cracks! I took the advice of one reviewer and doubled the amount of cookie crumbs in the crust.

I loved this recipe, and so did the family. It was gone in two days. XD The only thing the recipe forgets to mention is to bake your cheesecake in a water bath to avoid cracking.

The fresh raspberries are absolutely necessary when served. I made mine with a  home made walnut crust and it was amazing. Everyone loved it, and my grandma couldn't believe I made it.

I used 1.5C of chocolate graham crackers for the crust and raspberry jam (not the seedless kind) and I had to use a sieve to separate the seeds. The cake turned out beautiful and quite tasty. I will definitely make this again.

Delicious! I love the version of this cheesecake at Olive Garden, but they have removed it from the menu. After searching and finding this recipe, I can make it at home and it's just as good (if not even better).

Made it and love it. I did bake it in a water bath and let it slowly cool in the oven after baking so it didn't crack. It came out a bit sweet, I might cut back a couple tablespoons of sugar next time.

I followed some reviewers and used 2 cups Oreos with cream, 1 tbsp sugar, and 1/4 cup melted butter in the crust. I also pressed the crumbs down really hard and refrigerated it so that it becomes rock hard so that it holds together when I'm filling. 

I've always had an issue with water seeping in my springform pan when I use a bain marie, so I instead wet a couple of dish towels, make sure they're not dripping, and wrap them around my pan inside a baking sheet. I end up with nice, even, crack-free cheesecakes every time. This methods usually means the cheesecake bakes a little slower, so I had to bake for over 1 hr before the cheesecake was only wobbly in the middle. I then turned my oven off, propped the door open with a wooden spoon, and let it cool in the oven. Then, I refrigerated it overnight  before serving. It takes a while, but trust me, patience and care is key to perfect cheesecake.

Turned out great.  Next time I will add a little extra sugar to the raspberry sauce.  It was a little too tart for my tastes.

My family and I aren't great fans of cheesecakes but we became White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake fans!

Taste was de-li-cious but I had a bit of trouble in the making - it was disastrous. Not the recipe's fault, but it could've given me a heads up about it!

I bake often but thought, I won't line this pan as the recipe doesn't call for it - most probably it's not needed. Boy was I wrong! The cookie base stuck on the pan and when serving, I had to scrape it off and put it on top of the rest of the cake..

Unfortunately I hadn't read the most helpful positive review here!

One small change - I skipped the sugar in the cookie crust - the cookies are sweet enough! I also used Vegetal Fresh Cream (12% fat) instead of Half-and-Half as I can't find the latter here.

Overall wonderful recipe, will definitely use again.

I made this cheesecake for a family gathering yesterday and it was amazing!  I used fresh organic raspberries, although it does take a little longer because you have to drain the seeds, the result is well worth it.  I used a 6oz package and used the full 1/2 cup water required but only a teaspoon of cornstarch.  I also used two cups crushed Oreos 1/4 cup butter and halved the sugar and the crust was perfection!   Baking tips:  wrap the bottom of the spring form pan in aluminum foil and bake in a water bath on a cookie sheet. It makes all the difference!

Chocolate covered graham crackers for crust,  I usually make 1 1/2 of called mixture for thicker crust. Always a hit when it comes out for dessert.

I've never made this before. Made it almost like the recipe called for. I did used about 1/2 cup more white chocolate and did not strain raspberry seeds.  I put many drops on top and used a butter knife to make heart shapes. It is so beautiful and yummy.

This cheesecake was very tasty but was very dense. I'm not sure if it was something I did, but I had to cut the slices very small  our else people couldn't finish their portion. I didn't make any changes to the filling, although I did blend it in a ninja blender/food processor, which is the only thing I can think of that would alter the outcome. Other changes I made was using seedless raspberry preserves instead of frozen raspberries and wrapping the spring form pan in foil and placing it in a pan of water while it baked as some other reviewers had suggested. I would make again but for a larger group and cut the pieces smaller.

This cheesecake is AMAZING. It certainly lives up to all the reviews. I want to try to make it again but in smaller ramekins so I can easily give to to people. Does anyone have an idea of how to adjust the cooking time for smaller size mini cheesecakes?

Fantastic cheesecake!  I've made this several times for special occasions and it's always a hit...no changes to the recipe at all.  However, I cook using a water bath (oven bags do wonders for keeping the water out of the cheesecake), at 300 for one hour, then turn the oven off and leave the cheesecake in for an additional hour without opening oven door.  It comes out perfect every time.

I used an oatmeal crumble crust. I only had one package of cream cheese so I used a cake pan. I also didn't take the seeds out of the blackberry syrup and it had a couple of cracks in it but it's still delicious. My internet went down halfway through so I had to carry on without it, didn't seem to matter. I would make this again.

Absolutely delicious!  I had doubled the crust based on reviews and it was too thick in my opinion. Next time I will try exactly as posted ot maybe 1.5 times. Really really tasty and easy to make.

I made this mostly  per the recipe.  The only thing I changed was adding an extra Tbls of sugar to the raspberry coulis and 2 tsp lemon juice to it.
It came out FABULOUS! The other thing I would change is omitting the sugar from the oreo crust. Like others have said, it's not needed. I can't really taste the white chocolate,  it's very subtle but the cake itself is good. I will have to get family to try it to see what they think, but I will DEFINITELY make this again.

I pretty much followed the recipe as written and everyone said it was delicious!!  I think when I make it again, I'm going to cool the raspberry sauce some before I spoon it over the cheesecake, because it didn't seem thick enough while still hot.  I did watch a YouTube video showing how to tell when cheesecake has baked long enough.  Mine looked cooked about 2 1/2 inches around the outside of the top and was a little jiggly in the middle.  It does set up nicely when cooled and was the creamiest cheesecake I've ever made!!!  Also, neither the raspberry or the white chocolate come through as strong flavors, they blend just right.

Amazing cheesecake recipe. I took several suggestions from other reviewers made it easy on myself and used 6 big tablespoons of seedless red raspberry preserves which I heated in the microwave for about 40 seconds total (stirring halfway through). Also melted the white chocolate chips and half and half in the microwave and whisked it to mix it well. Took another suggestion of baking it on 325 for an hour in a shallow water bath on a cookie sheet, and when it was done baking I turned the oven off, kept the oven door shut, and left it in the oven to rest for another hour. It over browned a bit to much for me, so next time I will put a foil tent over the top of it with a small circle cut out in the middle to prevent the over browning. It was cooked perfectly other than the top being a bit too brown!! So creamy and delightful. Rave reviews at the party we attended. I'll make this again! Thanks!!

I've made this a few times and it's always a hit. I always get asked where I bought it from =) . One of the best recipes of all time, it's always sure to impress . 
The only thing I do different is i use oreos (cream and all) no sugar added for the crust, I use raspberry preserves thinned with a little hot water for the raspberry sauce and a water bath in the oven.  
I will for sure continue making this recipe.

I have made this twice now.  Both times I have used graham crackers for the crust.  That is the only thing I changed about the recipe.  It is so good.  Every one who has tried it , loves it.  They have said it tastes better than stuff from a restaraunt.  My Uncle specifically asked me to make him a whole cheesecake.  He said it is the best he ever had.  I let it cool in the overn for two hours before I took it out and put it in the fridge.

This was my first experience in making a cheese cake.  The recipe was excellent and actually easy and fun to make!  Comments received - DELICIOUS!
I would improve the recipe by adding additional raspberry sauce and strain the raspberry juice before adding the starch.  It was a little difficult to strain the sauce after adding the starch.

I didn't have raspberries so I substituted blueberries and it came out great! I didn't strain the blueberries, I just incorporated the whole mixture into the cream cheese and I feel like it helped keep it moist. I also used six mini spring form pans and the recipe filled all six perfectly. Also, not sure if I filled the pans too much or if I over mixed but they did rise up above the pan and ended up collapsing in the middle. After cooling (which only required about 3-4 hours as I was using mini pans) the texture and flavor were amazing. Very rich, very dense, and very creamy. Got rave reviews across the board!

Delicious! We felt it was creamier and tastier if It was out of the refridgerator a while  before eating. Next time I'll put more raspberry sauce in between the layers! Yum

I love this recipe. I followed others advice and used foil to cover bottom of my springform pan and a water bath.  After stated cooking time, I turned oven off and left inside the closed door for 2 hours.  Never cracked or sunk in the middle. Will definitely make again with other flavors.  I did use canned raspberry pie filling.  It was way too think but it did turn out wonderful. MH thought it was decadent and bake shop worthy.

Wow! This is the best cheesecake I've ever made!!! The white chocolate makes it sooo creamy! I followed a suggestion by beating the eggs before adding to the cheese. I used strawberries jam: I couldn't taste it a lot ,maybe next time I'll put more jam. I think that if you omit it, it would taste still yummy. I doubled the chocolate cookies (used Mulino Bianco in Italy) and add a little bit more of butter.
I used half of Lindt white chocolate and half of Nestlè Galak. Next time only Lindt!
I cooked in a 8' springform pan and it fit perfectly!
Usually(I forgot this time) before putting it in the oven, I gently beat the pan on the table and swirl in a S way a knife on the surface so that the bubbles come off.
I cooked 500 F the first 5 minutes and 200F for a hour and 30 minutes, switched the oven off and let it cool inside for 3 hours with opened door. And as soon as I switched the oven off, I put a glass bowl on the pan so that it keeps moistured.
Thanks so much for this fabulous recipe!

My family loved this cheesecake even my youngest who claims to hate cheesecake. I did use seedless raspberry preserves as suggested by some other reviews. I also used heavy cream with the white chocolate chips and microwaved them to combine. I will definitely make this again!

This is the absolutely best cheesecake I've ever made or eaten. I use frozen raspberry and make up my spread ahead of time and then just whip the cake up. Use a water bath and cook to the specified time. I let it rest in the oven for 2-4h with the door cracked then into the fridge overnight. WOW! I save a little of the drizzle for after its cooled to drizzle over top and top with fresh berries before it goes into the fridge. The combination of the tart berries mixing with the sweet drizzle is a mouth popper!

After reading some reviews, I doubled the oreos for the crust  (I used red velvet oreos, they were perfect!), and double the butter, though I think that was a little too much,and no sugar.  I also used seedless raspberry jam and melted it in the microwave, and melted the chocolate chips in the microwave.  I wrapped the bottom of my pan in aluminum foil and used a water bath. No cracks!  My husband said it was the best cheesecake he's ever had :)

A must try recipe. 
Had to make 2 changes to the recipe: 
1) Cut down on the sugar way alot, just to suit our taste. 
2) I was short on raspberries so totally skipped the sauce part but instead made a chocolate sauce (chocolate morsels, butter and half-and-half cream.) 

Baked the cake in the waterbath. Turned out amazing!! everyone loved it and received an order for the cake!! thank you!!

My mom is staying with me and asked me to make her a cheesecake. This is the second one I have ever made from scratch. I couldn't find chocolate cookie crumbs. So I used a regular box of graham cracker crumbs and added 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder to the mixture. Worked perfectly! I would definitely recommend this recipe to my friends.

I made this cheesecake plenty of times. It is always a favorite with friends and family. This last time that I made it, I didn't have all of the ingredients. I did not have half and half or enough Oreo cookies to make the Crum crust. I didn't have vanilla extract either. Instead of crushing Oreo cookie crumbs, I placed an Oreo cookie along the bottom the best I could to fill the crust area. And instead of having half and half, I used whole milk. I omitted the vanilla extract altogether. I follow directions as usual, and it came out wonderful. It almost came out just as perfect as using the true ingredients. I could barely notice a difference, the crust even had Oreo label still on the bottom of the cheesecake, next time I won't even bother with crumbling the cookies, I'll just layer of the cookies as usual but fill in the cracks with cookie pieces. Five stars for the improvised version of this cheesecake!

I can understand why this gets such good ratings, it's delicious, and relatively easy to make.  We have been spending New Year's eve with the same group of friends for nearly 20 years.  Each year I make dessert.  After serving this cheesecake at this recent New Year's eve, everyone exclaimed that this was probably the best dessert I've made.  I will definitely make it again.

I accidentally left out the half and half (oops) but this still turned out great.  Graham cracker crust is just as delicious as a chocolate one.  Impressive dessert and super tasty, perfect for a special occasion.

I cut the sugar out of the crust. I used chocolate teddy grahams. I cut the sugar in the batter down to 1/3 what the recipe called for. Double the raspberry sauce for sure. Squeeze and strain berries prior to making sauce. This was fabulous. I like to taste the cheese in cheesecake. I felt it was still plenty sweet even with the reduction of sougar.

I made this for my family gathering for Christmas and they loved it!! I doubles the oreos in the crust but not the sugar and I didn't quite double the butter. I baked it for an hour in the oven with a pan of water underneath and then I turned the oven off and let it set in the oven for an other hour. It turned out perfect. Also I didn't strain the seeds out of the raspberry because I didn't have time and it turned out fine.  It did kind of make  buttery mess. I will be making this again!

This is the perfect, I repeat perfect, cheesecake!  It was not difficult to make, in spite of how gorgeous the finished product is... every guest raved over the taste, the looks, and the uniqueness of it.  I did find it took longer to cook that was listed in the recipe but I have always found placing a pan of water on the oven floor, when you are starting the oven, keeps the cheesecake from cracking and helps it retain even cooking throughout.  The raspberry paste was outstanding, also not difficult.  I swirled it in the cheesecake, coated the top with a glaze once the cake was cool, and then covered it with white chocolate curls.  On top of that, I spaced fresh raspberries around it- what a hit!  Definitely a keeper I will use again and again.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

I made this for Christmas eve and it was so good!! I used a water bath and made a little heart design on the cheesecake leaving me with extra raspberry but this was so good! I'll probably use less butter for the crust next time because of the Oreo cream but overall it was a SMASH HIT. Thank you for this recipe it was delicious and fluffy and what cheesecake dreams are made of.

Very good... made it for the family for Xmas and it was a hit. I doubled the raspberry sauce and poured the remaining amount on the top, like the picture.  Also cooked it in water, like the Tip suggested, but  took 75 minutes to cook through.

I've been making this cheesecake at Christmas time for the last several years.  It looks beautiful, and tastes even better!  Everyone raves about it, and several people have said it's the best cheesecake they've ever had!  

It's a little high maintenance, as the raspberries tend to splatter a lot when cooking, and almost always get me once or twice.  It takes a while to make, and removing the raspberry seeds through a mesh strainer is a bit of a pain, but it's definitely worth it.  

I haven't altered the recipe at all except that I grate the white chocolate all over the top vs. using curls...it makes it look like snow!  One tip...line your oven rack with aluminum foil before preheating...the batter may seep when baking depending on how well you've covered the seam of the spring form pan with the crust.

This is super easy to make and way better than any white chocolate raspberry cheesecake I have ever tasted in a restaurant. Definitely get a mesh strainer for the raspberries. It's a handy tool to have for many recipes. They turn out perfect in a spring pan for cheesecakes.

Awesome! I only had 1 3/4 c of white chocolate chips so I added 1/4 cup of  semisweet mini chocolate morsels. I used all the raspberry sauce on & in the cheesecake. I cooked it for about 75 minutes, turned off the oven and left it in the oven for 30 minutes. (After 60 minutes it was cracked around the edges & sunken in the middle and very jiggly) After waiting as mentioned it turned out perfect!!! It had a slight raise around the edges which would've been perfect to hold the toppings in place but I served it warm with fresh raspberries & cool whip on the side! It was awesome and everyone loved it. Hope I can get it to turn out so well next time!!!

I made this (for the first time ever making a cheesecake) for my boyfriends birthday and it turned out to be delicious but it  went from about 3 inches or so tall to about 1 1/2 or so inch tall, I'm not sure what happened but it was still really good and everyone loved it. I'll definitely be making this again.

Skip making the raspberry sauce.  It's a lot of work and not worth the effort.  Instead spread melted seedless raspberry jam over the cooled cheesecake.  It's a lot less work and delicious!!!  (Instead of white chips I use 16 oz. of high quality white chocolate.)  Very good cheesecake worthy of special occasions!

This is an awesome recipe!! I am making it for the second time tonite for my mom's 60th birthday dinner tomorrow!! I made 1 change the first  time around. I didn't really have a round baking pan so I used 1 pre made graham cracker pie crust and 1 Oreo cookie pie crust from the store. (It made 2) Came out perfect!! This time I'm using strawberries instead of raspberries, because my mom loves strawberries more. It worked great!! A family favorite by far!!!

9" springform pan was used and I pre-heated the oven to 325 degrees as specified in the recipe.    I was really surprised at the temperature; all other cheesecake recipes I've used had a much hotter oven.
It rose beautify and at 55 minutes I checked it.  Soup!  So I continued to cook for 10 additional minutes.  Mush!  So I jumped the temperature to 350 and cooked for an additional 10 minutes.   Turned off the oven and opened the door to cool for 2 hours, then placed it in the refrigerator.  When I tested it after the full cooking time, it seemed REALLY creaming.   I really do pray it comes out because it's for my BFF's birthday.    The 3 stars is for cooking.  Yep, it sunk big time.   I will repost after we taste it.

I made this for my husband since he is a huge cheesecake fan.  I "though" I didn't like cheesecake, but I tried a piece anyway.  Boy am I glad I tried some... I LOVE CHEESECAKE!!!!  I followed the given directions, but also did a water bath for the cake.  I also turned the oven off a few minutes early and left the cake in the oven until the oven reached room temperature.  Then, I placed the cake on a wire rack for about an hour and a half to further cool before I placed in the fridge.  My cake came out perfect.  Not a single crack nor did the center sink in.  I will be making this cake again and again!

This is my go-to cheesecake recipe!  SO EASY and always great!  I rarely do the fruit part, it's great as a plain cake.  Never a complaint and I love that it doesn't have a ton of ingredients.

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday and it was a big hit among our friends. 
I did skip a lot of the stove work, and used the microwave for the raspberries and the white chocolate. 
The only other advice I could give someone would be to follow the cheesecake rule and cook it at a lower temperature for longer instead of the higher temperature for an hour.

AMAZING! I didn't follow the baking directions. For a no fail cheesecake follow directions below:
1. Place casserole dish on bottom shelf in oven and fill with water. Turn oven to 350F.
2. Once oven is preheated place cheesecake on second shelf in oven. Bake at 350 for 15 minutes.
3. Turn oven to 200F and bake for 2 hours. 
4. Turn oven off and leave cheesecake in oven for an additional 2 hours.
5. Cool in refrigerator overnight.

I have made this cheesecake, took it to work and got hugged by my coworkers. I have also made it without a crust or the raspberry swirl and put it in the middle of Grandpop's special chocolate cake.  Yummy!!

I could not find chocolate wafer cookies for the crust so used graham crackers. I have found that baking the crust for about 7 minutes keeps it from becoming mushy. I also learned that my New York cheesecake always cracked because I mixed the batter at high speed. For this cake, I used low speed only and, viola!, no cracks! I used a dark pan and did not lower the temp so my cake came out brown, although it was delish.  I am making it again as a gift and will lower the temp to 300 degrees.  I, too, used seedless jam, added water & cornstarch. I found a chopstick works very well to swirl the top. Leave in oven until cool, 1 to 2 hours then remove from oven & let sit another hour until room temp then refrigerate. This time I will use chocolate graham crackers.  I always increase the amount of crust so it goes up the sides about 1/4", which I find prevents leakage.

I've never been keen on baked cheesecake as I prefer the texture of the fridge cheesecake. This however turned out so well. I made the base much thicker and left out the sugar. I also added a half cup sour cream to the mixture and made it with black cherries instead of blackberries. I kept the pieces in, never strained it. Delicious. I put a bowl of water next to the pan in the oven, and left it in the oven to cool slowly to avoid cracks. There still were some unfortunately but I hid them with the cherry topping. I left the pan in the fridge overnight. Will definitely make it again. Maybe next time it won't crack

Delicious! Everyone loved it! I used fresh raspberries and heavy cream instead of half and half. I couldn't find chocolate wafers so I bought Oreo's and scraped out the middle. I also baked it in a water bath so it didn't crack or dry out. Of course, we served it topped with whipped cream!

Absolutely handsdown the best cheesecake I have ever tasted. Directions are easy to follow and very well written. The recipe does not say anything about using a water bath...definitely do that...but in my opinion that's with any cheesecake. I made this with my 2 teenage children whom I try to cook with...I was worried that a cheesecake may be a little above their current level of instruction...but it was a great experience. So easy to follow!

I wanted to make a cheesecake for a while and decided to do my first one with this recipe. I made it last night and gave it a try today. It turned into a BIG success with my wife. Like others, I used Oreo cookies for the crust but took the cream out of them. It still gave it a nice crunch in the finished dessert. Great flavor with the raspberry sauce and the cheesecake had the right thick consistency. My wife is already asking that I do this one again. It's a keeper. Thanks!

My Daughter Graduated from business college and we were having a big family BBQ. for her, these are two of her favorite things and she LOVES Cheesecake, It was my first time making this one and I must say "WHEW" it was alot of work, with the 4 different steps, but, the end result was AMAZING. She Loved it and the whole family LOVED it. I did as was suggested by one and did 2 cups of cookie crumbs. Difinitely will do again as it was just the right amount of crust, might pull back to 1/3 cup butter though and I did not add sugar,it was sweet enough. I also started the whole process by putting frozen raspberries in food processer with the water, then strained, but I think you could also just let them thaw in a bowl, then do in thirds and use spatula and push through strainer, into pan, then continue with, water, sugar and cornstarch, I did end up adding 1/4 cup sugar, as my berries were very tart. I also used good quality white Choc. (Ghirardelli) Its smooth and doesn't have the chalky aftertaste. IMO, I also used 1/3 less fat Cream Cheese, and the 9in springform. It was perfect. I also set whole pan on a sheet of heavy duty foil and went up to top of pan and did a water bath then turned off oven after an hour and let it sit in oven with door cracked for hour. Then into fridge. Came out Beautifully. Also as I alternated cheesecake batter with raspberry puree I lightly swiriled each layer which was 3 and topped with remaining raspberry puree. Next time I will make a day ahead.

I get requests for this all the time.  I made it for an open house event last night and got rave reviews.  I use seedless raspberry preserves and I use expensive white chocolate and double it.  I also use Oreo cookies and don't add the sugar for the crust. I have people pay me to make this.

I followed the recipe mostlyand it was amazing, only change for next time is I won't swirl the raspberries in. I did change the raspberry for strawberry jam (worked great) it made cracks wherever the swirl was. The texture was rich and creamy. Make sure the cream cheese is room temp soft, if not you won't get the same creaminess. Yes I will make again and again!!

I make lots of cheesecakes and this one is one of our favorites.  To save time, and because it tastes just as good as the raspberry sauce in the recipe, I simply use seedless raspberry preserves warmed slightly in the microwave.  To create pretty designs with the raspberry sauce, you can use toothpicks or little syringes.

Presentation wise, this is the best dessert I have ever made. I just went in at the end and started swirling without a plan, It still turned out so pretty. It look lots of different pans to make, but not complicated at all, I think anyone could do it. Oh, I did use the water bath technique and left in oven for 3 hours without door cracked. Other than that, I followed recipe exactly.

I do not consider myself a good cook and I never imagined myself to ever successfully bake a cheesecake. This recipe and the reviews have made it possible for me to wow my friends and family with a decadent cheesecake! I have made it twice so far and, honestly, I feel like I have learned so much more by following the instructions on this recipe than on any other cheesecake recipe. It was delicious, gorgeous, and very fun to make. This will be my go-to cheesecake recipe and I will be modifying it. Perhaps instead of raspberry adding peanut butter? Oh, and be very generous with the oreo crust. Mine could have used much more. Thanks for the helpful reviews and recipe!

So yummy!! I wrapped foil around the bottom of my pan & placed the pan on a cookie sheet. Then I filled the cookie sheet w/water. I baked the cheesecake for an hour then turned the oven off & let the cheesecake sit in the oven for another hour. This prevents the cake from sinking in the middle.

So yummy! A friend made this for our supper club, her 1st time ever making a cheesecake and she did an amazing job! It looked identical to the picture and tasted better than I had imagined! She followed some of the tips and suggestions from others and it really made a difference for her! Cannot wait to make this myself!

I made this for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day because he loves cheesecake. Not only did he love it, his sister and mother loved it too! His sister even took some home. I replaced raspberry sauce with strawberry sauce because he particularly love strawberry cheesecake. I used 2 cups of strawberries, 2 tbsp water, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/2 teaspoon balsamic vinegar, and 1tspn cornstarch mixed with 2tbsp water. It was a big hit. I will definitely make this again! Thank you!

This came out great and was so tasty.  The only change I would make would be to use seedless raspberry jam next time instead of reducing frozen raspberries.  I used chocolate grahamn crackers and they worked well.

This was so good. I used Baileys Irish Cream instead of Half and Half.  And made a fresh raspberry with cinnamon sauce to serve it with.

I've baked this cake 2-3 times.  My family absolutely loves it.  This recipe was actually the basis on which I started making other cheesecakes.

I would give this 10 stars if I could.  It was that good.  It is a beautiful dessert and fairly easy to make.  I made the recipe as written except I used chocolate wafers for the crust instead of Oreos.  I also put parchment paper on the bottom of the spring fold pan and baked the crust 10 minutes, cooled it before adding the filling.  I don't know if this step was necessary but that is how I usually do crusts for cheesecakes. My husband loved this.  We are not big dessert eaters but this one is heavenly.  We had it on Christmas.  I froze the half that we haven't eaten since there was just 2 of us.  Hopefully it will be just as good.

This recipe is amazing!  I also use the seedless jam to save on time, it works beautifully and no one has complained or noticed yet. Microwaving the white chocolate and half in half works well to just be careful...start at 30seconds, stir then do 15 second intervals stirring in between each until melted.  I've also used this as a base recipes  and instead of  raspberry jam I've used, cherry jam, strawberry jam ,  and crushed Oreos.  All of which have been very well received.  Enjoy!!

This is a true 5 star recipe.  It turned out fantastic.  It didn't sink or crack.  The flavor was great and it wasn't overly sweet.  All of my guests loved it.  I followed Estella93's cooking tips.  Thanks for this one!

My cheesecake was baked too long.The top of the cheesecake was browned and looked burnt (might have been self error:/ )but, overall myself and my guest loved the flavor of the cheesecake and the chocolate cookie crumbs.My guest all agreed the raspberry sauce was an excellent sweet and tart addition to the cheesecake!

I've made this 4 times, so obviously I think it's delicious.  But no matter what I did the first three times it cracked horribly.  Still tasted great, so I didn't mind too much but it bothered me a little.  The fourth time I made it I omitted the raspberry sauce in the cake and just drizzled it over the slices instead.  No cracks!  It came out absolutely perfect.  So I won't put sauce in the cake again. 

 Everyone I make this for loves it

This was my first attempt at making cheesecake. I had no idea I needed a springform pan, so I improvised by making them in muffin cups. Same temp for baking, but adjusted to 20 minutes only. They were a hit! Perfect portions and garnished with a raspberry and mint leaf. Will definitely make these again...no springform pan for me!

I didn't have vanilla but decided that wasn't going to stop me!  And I'm glad it  didn't because it still turned out really well. I took advice from the other reviews and used 2 cups Oreos, 1/4 cup butter, and 1 tablespoon of sugar - and  I only baked it for 45 minutes. Turned out great! I also followed the suggestion to use seedless raspberry jam, which worked well, but I would suggest using more than the recommended six tablespoons, as that didn't give it much raspberry taste. Overall a great recipe and execution for my first cheesecake ever!

Amazing recipe but the sugar can definitely be cut way back! I made the recipe omitting the 1/2 cup sugar and the extra sugar in the crust and it was still plenty sweet. In fact, the next time I make it, I will also it back on the white chocolate too- probably to 1 1/2c. I followed another review and used a jar of high quality raspberry jam (warmed it up and put through a strainer to remove seeds).  This recipe (altered a smidge) is a keeper!

This was my first time to make a real cheesecake, springform pan and all. (The ol' crescent roll bars don't count, do they?)  I followed the recipe exactly, and read most of the reviews for helpful hints.  I did do a water bath, wrapping my pan in three layers of foil to keep it dry.  I baked the cake for an hour and turned the oven off for another hour before I opened the door...and there were no cracks!   I am so addicted to parchment paper that my family will probably bury me in it.....anyway, I cut a circle for the bottom of the pan, and put a strip around the side of the pan too.   After I removed the cake from the oven, I just had to lightly run a butter knife around the edges of the cake and the strip of parchment paper pulled right away.  The end result was great!  Everyone loved it, and declared it to be my best dessert yet.  I will admit to using melted seedless preserves in place of the homemade sauce.  The melted white chocolate seemed to make my batter thinner than I expected, but it all worked out in the end.  Thanks for the great recipe, and big thanks to all of you who submitted reviews with helpful cooking tips.  I am still shocked that my cake didn't crack!

It turned out beautiful and tasted wonderful, even though it was the first cheesecake I ever made. I used chocolate graham crackers for the crust's chocolate cookies with great results and really only needed the one cup listed.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving this year... and it was a hit! I took the tip of the reviewer who used seedless raspberry jam instead of the whole fruit and it worked great-and saved alot of time. I also used chocolate graham crackers instead of cookies and it was perfect. Thank you so much for this recipe!

First dessert I have ever made in my whole life. (58 yrs ) I am not joking. I had to buy all new utensils, including a spring pan.
 I entered it in my company BBQ dessert contest. I received 1st place!! Now everyone wants me to make one for Thanksgiving. It was delicious!!!!

I add extra oreos for a thicker bottom. I also followed the recommendation of letting the cake cool down in the oven for a few hours to prevent cracking. I have made this cake dozens of times. Will be making it again tonight for my Grandmother's 91st birthday as requested. This is a great recipe. Takes a little more effort than other cake recipes, but well worth the outcome!

Not as complicated as some I've made. I don't know what chocolate wafers the author uses so I followed some other reviewers advice and used  2 cups of Oreo crumbs, no middle filling, 1/4c butter and 1/4c sugar and baked at 325 for 10 minutes. Used parchment on bottom and sides of a 9" spring form pan. I used the whole bag of Nestle' white chocolate chips, I guess it was close to 3 cups. I used raspberry jam diluted with cranberry juice cocktail so I could remove the seeds more easily and then cooked it down a little and it worked pretty well. Placed the cheesecake in a large roasting pan and added about 1 1/2 inches of boiling water, I always wrap my spring form pan with heavy aluminum foil, baked at 325 for 1 hour, turned the oven off, cracked open the door and left the cheesecake in for   1 1/2 hours. I then removed it from the oven and bath and placed on a cooling rack for a couple of hours and then put it in the fridge. It's 2:00 AM and it has been in the fridge for about 5 hours and it taste great. I was concerned about the texture because I have never added chocolate to a cheesecake before but the texture is comparable to other recipe's I've used in the past. No cracks, not one. If my cake cracked I would change something or use a different recipe.

Folks raved over this cheesecake.  I personally thought it could use a little something more, so I may try doubling the white chocolate.  I had no trouble with the amount of crust; no need to double.  I didn't use Oreo's, I used the chocolate wafers - it needed about half a package.  Since I had to grind them in the food processor, I just mixed all the crust ingredients in there and saved myself a bowl.  I know some folks suggested using raspberry jam - I'm sure you could, but then you wouldn't have any sauce to spoon over.  I could only find a 12 oz package of frozen raspberries, so I just heaped the other ingredients and it turned out fine.  I used a food mill to get the seeds out; much easier than a mesh strainer if you happen to have one.  The sauce is not sweet (there's enough sugar in the cake), which allows the raspberry flavor to really shine through.  I baked for 1 hour and 15 minutes, which is more in line with most cheesecake recipes - it was definitely not ready after one hour.  I generally don't care about the cracks on a cheesecake and never bother with all the advice out there.  But in this one instance, the swirls on the cake might have looked better without the cracks!

I thought it was great! I will use the suggestion to leave in the oven for another hour because the center fell in.  I also will use the cookie crust suggestion as well, because mine was kind of greasy.

A taste out of this world. I always make it and I always get amazing compliments. The only two modifications I do to the recipe are:
1. I add 1  tablespoon if flour to the cheese mixture white mixing it.
2. I use 3/4 of the raspberry sauce inside the cake. The last quarter I cook it again with a little bit water and some lemon juice. I serve this sauce beside the cheesecake to add a lovely velvet red color and a yummy yummy taste to the special dessert.....
Thanks a lot for the perfect recipe!

Solid recipe, and one of the better cheesecakes I've made.  The only thing I'll change in the future is probably doubling the amount of raspberry sauce. The cheesecake itself could stand a bit more raspberry flavor, and the sauce on top was a great touch.

This is a great recipe! It tastes just as good if not better than the $4.00 tiny gourmet cheesecake that my husband and I love.  Thank you CindyAnn!

I made this cheesecake just as the recipe states EXCEPT...I did use 2 cups of cookie crust.  My only suggestion would be to use a water bath (which I did not do, and it did crack a little on the top). But if your cheesecake does crack, its not a huge deal !  I served this to my co-workers and they thought it was amazing!

This was only my second cheesecake ever… and everyone loved it and couldn't believe that I made it. I had trouble melting down the white chocolate in the cream, but other than that it went well… I might add like an extra 1/4 cup of the crushed oreos for the bottom. It was a bit thin...

I love to bake and my specialty is cheesecake. I've made white chocolate raspberry cheesecakes on several different occasions using other recipes, but I thought I would try this one since it got such great reviews. I only used 12oz of white chocolate instead of the 16oz it calls for and it's still really over powering. The balance of raspberry to white chocolate flavor is way off. It didn't come out quite as firm as I like my cakes either and I chose to cook it slightly longer than recommended. All in all it was a pretty mediocre cheesecake, nothing special, and I probably won't ever make it again. I recommend you find a better recipe. P.S. If you want a really delicious chocolate cookie crumb crust, mix on a teaspoon of cinnamon. Delicious!

I agree that it tastes delicious, but I'm not sure if it's just my oven or if it's the recipe that required the extra extra long baking time. Which ended up in a burnt top. Overall it was fine, but the cake kinda fell into itself. But it's a keeper.

I made this cheesecake for Easter and it was a big hit. As another person suggested, I used raspberry preserves instead of the frozen. I probably could have shut the oven off after 50 minutes of baking, as it baked quick. I also used a water bath which I do for all my cheesecakes because I get great results when doing this. I did leave it sitting in the oven with the oven off for an additional hour. I drizzled with chocolate syrup and garnished with fresh raspberries. Excellent!

This was the first cheesecake recipe I have ever attempted. I loved it. I did modify it slightly. I used 100g more of the creme cheese, roughly 50g less of sugar (overall) and 70g less of the white chocolate. It turned out wonderful. I also used the suggestion of another review of putting it in a water bath, worked wonders. It was one of those cheesecakes that if you take one bite, you want to eat the whole cake. And I almost did.

A lot of work but well worth the effort.  Can be difficult to totally deseed the raspberries but didn't seem to matter.  Nice creamy texture, with the white chocolate really making this a spectacular treat.  Absolutely yummy!

This is an amazing story.  So I was browsing online for something to enter in a cook off at work. Normally I do main dishes or sides for pot luck's . This time I decided to make a dessert.  When I saw this was highest rating I had to try it. I made a trial one first. I followed the recipe to the T. No sad to say I'm not a fan of white chocolate or cheese cake, so I had some family members try it out. They loved it. When it came time to make one for work I did change one thing. I add the Oreo cookie crumbs with the cream center , 1 tablespoon of sugar, and the butter. This made for a better crust on the bottom. Because I had so many fresh raspberries I added them in with the frozen ones when making the sauce. When the cake was done spending over night in the fridge I topped it off with some fresh raspberries, white chocolate shavings and little dab of whipped cream. (Just to make it look pretty) I saw the judges at work tearing into it. I was so please to say I won the contest. Because there wasn't a lot to go around I have been asked to make another one for people to try. Thanks to the one that posted this recipe and for all the others that posted tips. Couldn't have done this without you.

Tip - use a bacon splatter screen to strain the raspberries. You mush it through the screen with a spoon, catch the sauce in a bowl below and scrap off the seeds on top. Worked perfectly. I didn't have a strainer that seems to cut it and get all the seeds out. Overall it was Amazing!

I read the tips article before trying this recipe. It it the second attempt at cheesecake (a different recipe) and my first attempt was an epic fail. I beat the cream cheese by itself first until very smooth. Followed this recipe except I used semi sweet chic chip instead of white because it's what I had on hand. I baked at 325 for an hour and then cracked the oven door and left it for another hour. Then I let it sit on my counter top for an additional 30 minutes. Covered and put in the fridge over night. Delicious! Also this recipe had too much batter for my pan so I also made cupcake sized mini cheesecakes for my kiddos. I will be making this over and over. Advice for a newbie at cheese cake read the tips article! It will help you a ton!!! Let the cheese get to room temp

This was absolutely delicious! It was my first time making a cheesecake. The white chocolate added a nice flavor. I added a bit more than recommended. It is best to cook it in the oven with the spring-foam pan wrapped with foil paper and a rectangular pan filled with water so the sides do not burn slightly. It took 80 mins to cook.

Everyone loved it! We just could not stop eating it!

I should have cut back on the butter in the crust like so many of you did. Otherwise it was fabulous. I too, was looking for the Olive Garden cheesecake, and this is pretty darned close! To change it up after the initial servings, I topped the slices with chocolate ganache. Yummy.

It's the perfect classy dessert for any occasion. I'm in love with this cheesecake. However, following the advice of another member I used raspberry jam instead of making my own raspberry drizzle and it was sublime.

I've have made a lot of really good cheesecakes but this one is amazing!!!!  I had some delicious homemade blueberry jam, so I used that in place of the raspberry.  I also tried something from another recipe and that was place the cheese cake on top of muffin pans filled with water.  It did crack just a bit, but not to serious.  The blueberries covered it anyway.  I don't have a lot of staples in my recipe box, I like experiencing with new recipes, but this has become one.

Loved this recipe no issues! I always put a pan in the oven with water in it though keeps it from drying out and cracking. I make this recipe with out raspberries, like a regular cheese cake and have strawberries or blueberries so people can have there choice. This is absolutely amazing!

I made this recipe exactly as written. Cheesecake just doesn't get any better than this!  I made this recipe for a big family Thanksgiving and word got around fast that it was 5 star delicious!  I had to slice it into small pieces so everyone could have a taste.  No other deserts were wanted for Christmas, except the request that I make more than one of this heavenly cheesecake.

This is my all time go to recipe for cheesecake. Creamy and rich. I have used some others tips and tweaked it a bit (i add an extra block of cream cheese, an extra egg, an extra cup of white chocolate chips, seedless raspberry jam, andpecan sandies cookies for the crust) but all in all, its a definite keeper!

Very good! Thank you for a wonderful recipe! I used the raspberry jam to avoid having to strain the seeds out. It was delicious. I also followed the water bath instructions. Baked for 60 minutes and turned off the oven and let it sit in the oven for another hour. Beautiful and delicious.

I changed the recipe just a bit. I used honey graham cracker crust, and strawberries that I picked from a farm instead of raspberries. I also decrease the sugar in the sauce to 2 tbsp. Instead of baking it in a springform pan, I used 2 pie pans.  I baked the crust by itself first for 10 mins in a 300 degree oven, and then decreased the temp to 250 when baking the cheesecake.  I baked the cheese ake in a water bath (put a dish towl in a larger pan, put cheesecake pan in the larger pan, fill the larger pan with boiling water until it comes up 2/3 up the way of the cheesecake pan). After cooking the cheesecake for 60 mins in the 250 degree, I turned off the oven and let the cake sit in the oven for another hour. DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN during this time. Not even for second!!! Let me tell you, this is the best recipe EVER! I made it for thanksgiving, and it was by far the stand out dish during the dinner. It even got a "Wow!" from my 2 yr old nephew, a very highly coveted praise.  My brother-in-law, a fitness buff, broke his diet and and a slice every moring and night. I have now been dubbed the "cheesecake dealer", cause it is so addicting.

This is a great recipe. I followed the directions exactly and it is delicious! It's easy to make. This was my first attempt at making a cheesecake. For my first, it came out pretty good but I have a lot to learn. I didn't spray the whole spring form pan like I should have so it stuck on the sides. I need to adjust my baking times as well. But over all I am happy.

Add me to those that loved it. I melted some chocolate chips and then piped it around the edge, it looks pretty and adds a touch more chocolate other than the crust.  Just prior to serving I put some of the remaining raspberry sauce on top. It looked scrumpsous and the taste lived up to the sight of it too. My thanksgiving company agreed with me. When next I wish to impress, I'll make it again. Making it for the third time. It keeps getting requested.

OMG I don't like cheesecake but love this! The White chocolate makes that taste I don't like in regular cheesecake to disappear. I haven't made the sauce yet but can't wait to try that out on it. Oh and chocolate graham crackers work wonderfully. Thank you!

This is a very delicious cheesecake. I baked for my sister in law's birthday and everyone loves it.
I used digestive biscuits instead of chocolate and added extra for a higher base. Reduced the sugar since the white chocolate chip I bought was really sweet. Instead of the raspberry swirl, I top the cake with raspberry sauce. Heavenly!! Thanks for the recipe

I have made this cheesecake several times, and I have had success each time. Actually, I am cooling one of these right now! However, I have issues with the cookie crumb crust as many others have mentioned. I use 3 cups of chocolate animal crackers to be sure the crust is not overwhelmingly sweet. I double the sugar and the butter. This creates just the right balance for the crust. I must say I am also rather fond of changing the fruit in this recipe. For instance, I have just replaced the raspberries with blueberries with splendid results. I use all the same measurements listed above, but I do not strain out the fruit. Instead, I prefer to pour half of the mixture onto the first half of the cheesecake batter, layer again with cheesecake, and then pour the remaining half of the fruit and sauce over the top. Then, I make a chocolate sauce to drizzle over the top when it is time to serve. The chocolate on both the bottom and top layers creates a very pleasant continuity throughout the confection. This is my boyfriend's favorite dish. It is definitely going to keep him close to me. :)

The BEST white chocolate raspberry cheesecake recipe I've ever tried! I was amazed at how delicious it was-- better than any cheesecake I've ever had! The raspberry filling was the perfect complement to the rich cheesecake. Absolutely saving this recipe! Followed it exactly but with a plain graham crust instead of chocolate (preference). Terrific! Thanks for this recipe!

I have made this two time and it was a HUGE hit each time.  My husband has requested it for his birthday instead of a traditional cake.  I followed many of the suggestions (doubling the cookie crumbs for the crust, using seedless jam, using parchment paper on the bottom of the spring form pan and wrapping the exterior of the pan in foil before using a water bath, and turning off the oven after approx. an hour and letting it sit in there for another hour).  Fabulous recipe with these minor modifications.  Love, Love, Love it!  Holidays are fast approaching, so I will be making it again!

WAY too sweet. Sweeter than eating a bar of white chocolate. I should have known, 1/2 cup sugar AND 2 cups of already sweet white chocolate? It overpowered everything in my cheesecake including the raspberry swirl, the crust, and the mascarpone whipped cream i put on top. Not only that, but the crust was crumbly, and the texture was way too creamy; it was like eating pudding.

I ended up just giving the rest of it to my friend- $20 wasted. Next time I would only use 1/4 cup sugar and use cheap white chocolate instead of the very high quality chocolate I used. waste of my money.

It's good, but for my tastes, this recipe doesn't have enough chocolate. I added an extra cup and it was delicious.

Amazing recipe!  I do have one suggestion for anyone having a problem with the raspberry sauce.  After combining the raspberries and water, I blended it with an immersion blender right in the pan (or of course you could use a regular blender).  Since I got so much juice out of the raspberries and it may have ended up more tart than the recipe intended, I added an extra tablespoon of sugar to the mixture. There's enough sauce that this time I froze half for the next time I make it.  This was my third time making this and everyone raves about it.  Thanks CindyAnn for posting this recipe!  It really makes an amazing cheesecake.

I usually don't leave reviews on recipes but this one I absolutely have to! This cheesecake was absolutely amazing. It tasted and looked better than any store bought cheesecake I have ever had in my life. It got rave reviews from my family members and is definitely a recipe I will be saving and making again!

Awesome cheesecake!! Question for the experts here - I used a 10" springform pan and found that I didn't have enough batter. If I were to double the ingredients to double the batter for 1 cake, would the baking time or temperature change?

I made this for my wife's birthday. I had never made a cheesecake before but I gave it a go anyway. It turned out perfectly. I had a little trouble mixing the raspberries so I just gave it a few pulses in my food processor and it was perfect. I had a bit of trouble getting the chocolate and half and half to melt smoothly so I put that in the food processor as well and it mixed up fine.

I have made this recipe many times.  I have made the crust from a package of double stuff oreo instead of the crumbs and sugar.  I have substituted Polaner seedless, sugar free raspberry preserves instead of making the sauce using the fresh.  I have outlined the entire cheesecake with fresh raspberries for decoration.  No one has ever complained

I made this yummy cheesecake for a family 4th of July picnic we had this year. It went over great, I tripled the recipe making a 9 x 13 baking dish for the picnic and a small round 8 inch to taste at home before the picnic for my hubby who said we really needed to taste it the night I made it to make sure it was good enough to take....lol (in other words he could not wait until the next day to have some). This was easy, enough you do have to make in steps. My adult daughter was with me while I was making it and we had so much fun in the kitchen. Everything went just as the recipe said and the only thing I changed like I said is I triple the recipe and I used gram crackers instead of a chocolate cookie for the crust but made it up the same way the directions have you make the chocolate cookie crust. I also did not discard the raspberry seeds after I strand them. To tell you the truth those seeds where CRAZY GOOD and you could have just eaten them with a spoon and cannot believe anyone would discard them! I put them in a small dish and we used them to place as a topping on another dessert I made to take to the picnic, but they would go great over ice cream too or even pan cakes...i can think of a ton of things to do with these left over seeds....they are way too good to just throw away. The cheese cake and the raspberry seeds where both a big hit, nothing was left and I will make again. Got a ton of complements on it too!

Yeah ... me and my roommate ate half of this cheesecake in one sitting. It was freaking delicious! I was lazy with the recipe and bought the crust, and I bought an Oreo pie crust, I highly recommend it.

definitely take the extra step and make the raspberry reduction.  It is far better than using the seedless store-bought jam/preserves.  Great recipe!

this was a very delicious cake. and beautiful too! i made this for father's day for a cheesecake loving dad and he loved it! i decorated it with some white chocolate shavings and a rose in the middle/top. i suggest using a water bath for baking your cheesecake so it doesn't crack. its very easy. look it up on YouTube and it will show you how to do it. now for the not so good part. i was surprised to see how thin the crust on the bottom of the cake was. next time, i will double the crust's thickness. overall, very tasty cheesecake. (especially with raspberry sauce on top!)

This turned out really well. The consistency was just right. I made the raspberry sauce as the recipe states and it was very yummy even with seeds (I didn't have the right strainer or maybe my sauce was too thick). Cooking time was just right. The only objection I have is that I used as much white chocolate as it said but I can't really taste it. The cream cheese over whelms it. Not hard to make at all.

It was WELL worth every calorie!! It was really easy to make which is also a plus. As some others mentioned, the only thing I did different was bake it in a water bath. I made it last night and just had my first piece now. OMG I'm in heaven!!!

Made this for my Mother on Mother's day. Came out fantastic! Everyone loved it.  I modified it slightly. Two cups of oreo crumbs for the crust kept the 1/4 cup of butter as the cream helps hold it together.  I also used only 2 Tbsp of sugar in the filling.  I felt that 1/2 a cup was just way too much sugar. It was plenty sweet as it was.  Will be making again!

I am absolutely amazed by how great this looked and tasted. 

Looks: The marbling tip was key. Looked as good as a bakery. Looked so much nicer even than the photo at the top of the recipe page. Focus on gently dragging the raspberry dribbles, not so much the batter. 

Taste: A-mazing. Moist. Recipe calls for baking time of 55-60 minutes. I used convection baking and removed it at about 53m. I wasn't sure if the center was done as more than just the very middle jiggled when tapped, but I left it in the pan while it cooled and it was perfect. 

Other:
1) I used choc graham crackers and they worked well. I used a whole box because I wanted a thicker cake than most. Only issue was there wasn't nearly enough butter to mix all those together. So, the crumbs weren't staying together when I'd cut a guest a slice. I'll use more butter next time. See if that helps. 
2) I used about a cup more white choc chips than called for. Right move. 
3) I felt it was hard to strain the raspberry seeds. This was the only painful part of it all. Perhaps I'll try pre-made raspberry sauce/jam as suggested by others.

Help! After following the recipe to the T, I found that my cheesecake did not turn out the way I would have hoped or the way normal cheesecakes due usually turn out. This is my first cheesecake so it could be my inexperience that did the problem but after cutting up a piece this morning to see how it tasted, I was left with mixed feelings. Alone the outside and a little bit towards the center of the cake, I found the texture to be exactly what I wanted. However as you progressed inwards towards the center it became mushy, personally I believe that the cake wasn't baked enough but I am sure that if I left it in any longer it would have burnt the top-edge part. Could I have done something wrong or is that normal in some recipes? I would love to try another cake, maybe a more simpler one to see if that goes well. Still the cake tastes very nice and I loved the look you receive from using the knife at the end.

I made a small variation so it is no longer white chocolate raspberry cake. I used dark chacolate.

This cake was fantastic! I added a bit more raspberry to the batter before baking it but it turned out great - and I enjoyed the tangy-ness it created! If I made it again, I'd change the chocolate cookie base to a butter cookie base - I used Oreo cookies and though my colleague loved everything about this cake, I'm not sure I liked the base so much!

Excellent!! Made one for Easter. Making one again for Mother's Day.  Cracked but had a great taste.  Crumpled Oreo cookie crumbs and milk chocolate shavings on top to camouflage the cracks. Everyone loved it.

I loved this recipe but there are a couple of things I wish I would have modified in it. Firstly, the other reviewers are right - for the base, it's better if it is a bit thicker and you use 3-4 cups of cookie crumbs. I also used the whole two packages of white chocolate chips I bought because I didn't know what I was going to do with a handful of chocolate chips, so I thought throwing them in there was fine. For me I think maybe the brand of the chocolate chips made the cheesecake a bit too sweet. I would cut the sugar in this recipe for sure, especially the 1/2 cup of white sugar in the cheesecake mix as the chocolate adds sweetness fine on its own. Try to avoid putting the raspberry sauce (which is totally worth making if you ahve the time) near the edges of the cheesecake as it can spatter up while it's baking and hinder the beauty of the swirls you'll make. The Cheesecake bath is a good idea and the parchment paper underneath the crust a very good idea. Mine didn't crack while baking, but when I took the springform sides off - it kinda formed a small crack which i was able to eat away in one slice. It's better to let it set overnight, 8 hours isn't enough...this is why I had a crack when I wanted to take it out of the pan I think, I was just way too impatient to eat it. Happy Baking!

Fantastic ! Truly a great recipe, I not sure if someone has suggested this, but if you wrap the outside of the springform pan in aluminum foil and place it in a large roasting pan with about 1 1/2 to 2 inches of water, basically a hot water bath while baking it will not crack !  I have done this for many years and have never had a cheesecake crack. This recipe is definitely worth adding to my treasured recipe collection. Thanks !

Love it. It was my first time making a cheesecake. I put my cheesecake in a oven bag and then a waterbath, baked for 60mins turned the oven off and let it sit for 60 min in the unopened oven. I used seedless raspberry jam and vanilla flavored liquid coffee creamer.  This recipe is a keeper. DE-LIC-IOUS will be making again... soon.

Yummy cheesecake! This was my first time trying a cheesecake and it came out beautifully! I did add just a little more cookie crumbs to the crust. I used the chocolate teddy grahams and I thought the crust tasted great with those. I did use a water bath and baked it for one hour, shut the oven off, and let it sit in the oven for another hour. It came out great! I think I will add parchment paper to the bottom of my pan next time to help get the cheesecake off easier.

I made this for Easter dessert and it was a hit! I doubled the crust recipe so that I could press it up the sides a little too.  I also added half a cup extra of the white chocolate. It was perfect.  Like another reviewer had said,I also had butter drip from the seam of the pan and it made a big mess in my oven, so next time (and there will be a next time!) I will put a pan or some tin foil down there to catch any drippings. Everybody loved it. This cheesecake is delicious! Go make it!

I made this for Easter with these changes; I doubled the crust using graham crackers. My family said it was the best cheesecake they ever had! I also put foil on the bottom of the oven to catch the drips.

I don't care for cheesecake but I make this for family get togethers and everyone raves about how good it is!  I like to use some of the raspberry sauce over vanilla ice cream.

GREAT recipe for a cheesecake, however I always have enough batter for two cheesecakes. Not really a problem, but it was a surprise the first time I used this recipe. The second time around, I just made sure I had an extra pie tin ready :)

Outstanding!!!!  I substituted graham cracker crumbs for the chocolate crumbs since my husband isn't fond of chocolate crusts.  Quite possibly the best cheesecake I have ever had!

Delicious!  I used crushed chocolate Teddy Grahams for the crust.  First time I made it it was gone before I could try it but was told it was delicious so I made another one and they were right!  Definitely a keeper.  It is much easier to make the 2nd time around .....I think I was just nervous about making it the 1st time since I had never used a spring form pan or made a cheesecake!

I made this today for my grandmother. She is currently on her death bed. I promised her a cheesecake before she dies. She may not be able to eat it, but I made it for her. It tastes amazing. I know she would've lived it. Rest in peace Grandma. I love you. This amazing cheesecake is for you.

This was very good but I had trouble with the cooking time.  I baked my cheesecake for 20 minutes longer and it still turned out too soft.  Did anyone else have this problem?

I've made this cheesecake several times now and it turns out perfectly every time!  I use oreos for the crust (crush two of the three rows in the package in a food processor, then add 2 tablespoons melted butter).  I bake the cheesecake in a waterbath and leave it in the oven until it cools to avoid cracking.

This was the first cheesecake I have ever made.  I was so surprised on how great it turned out.  It was beautiful and tasted like heaven!!  It took some time to make, but is well worth it.  I plan on making it again today.

Have never eaten cheesecake before nor ever prepared it so I was very unfamiliar with what the consistency should be etc with preparation.
The reviews on this were out of control! People could not believe I had never made a cheesecake before cause it was so decadent! "The best they had ever had." was said by many people.
I made it with a crust of half gram cracker, half crushed Oreo so it looked like a little speckled brown and black crust.
Instead of the Raspberry I made a recipe I found on allrecipes called "Supreme Strawberry Sauce" It was made by Pro member HEISLORD5 and I picked it cause it was a five star sauce, and I had strawberries in the fridge already.
Then I swirled the strawberry sauce in and on the top of cake for the baking process, Then scooped a little strawberry on top when serving to people.  
Absolutely a cheesecake recipe that will be used over and over again with variant tasting sauces.  It came out perfect despite the fact I had no clue what I was doing in the cheesecake realm whatsoever. 
Thank you for sharing this recipe with us, its a great one!

This a delicious cheesecake! I followed a lot of the suggestions in the commenting...like tinfoil on the bottom of the pan and setting it in the other pan with water, etc, etc. I wish I had followed the suggestion that mentioned cutting back on the butter in the base when using the oreo cookie crumbs with the cream filling as well. I used the full amount of butter and it came out slightly mushy. Also, make sure you have the mesh strainer..the seeds in mine just didn't work. Despite the seeds it was still the best cheesecake I had ever had. Good luck!

Made this last night. I am a beginner cook so it seemed like a lot of steps but to a pro probably isn't. It wasn't my favorite but everyone else loved it and that is what mattered to me!! I didn't have raspberries so used mixed berries. Worked out perfect!

I made this for my husbands birthday and it turned out very tasty. However, a bit off on the texture, a bit runny. I think if maybe the half and half was cut to 1/4 cup then it may not be so runny. I will try this the next time I make it. I used fresh raspberries and added a bit more sugar to my sauce because it was really tart. Very yummy and am not disappointed :-)

I just made this again this morning for a Super Bowl party  I have made it twice now, once with an Oreo cookie crust & today with a traditional graham cracker crust.  The first one was a big hit as I'm sure this one will be also.  I also did as a couple of other reviewers suggested.   I used seedless Raspberry jam.  I heated the jam in the microwave for about 25 sec. As it makes it more spreadable.  My first one was not as pretty due to the jam being in clumps & not swirling.  This recipe is a keeper!!

This recipe wasn't my favorite. I didn't like the texture of the cake. I also cooked it the way the recipe said, but that made it burnt! I thought the white chocolate was too strong, and the cake was really sweet!

I had mixed feelings about trying this recipe because though an overwhelming majority loved it, there were a few of them for whom this recipe did not work. Nevertheless I decided to go ahead though there have been occasions where I have been part of the unfortunate minority! I am glad I did because got rave reviews for it. Infact my sister told that this was the best cheesecake she had eaten - that means a lot because she is a huge cheesecake fan. Creamy, dense texture and not overly sweet or chocolaty. The marbled top looked beautiful and the raspberry sauce perfectly complimented it. 

What I did different - I did not strain the sauce instead I pureed it using an immersion blender - this way the seeds are not an issue, provides a nice crunch actually! 

I did not face any problem with a sunken top or cracking because I baked it in a waterbath for 55 mins. 

Used oreo cookies instead of chocolate cookies and increased the amount to 2 cups as per  reviewers suggestion.

The batter is a bit more liquid than expected but it baked out fine. Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

I love to make cakes, and this is the best cake I have ever tasted and/or made myself. The texture is unlike anything I have ever tasted. If you want to make a cake for a special occasion, this is the one.

Best. Cheesecake. EVER... even my dad and father-in-law (not a cheesecake fans) loved it. I did follow some other reviewers' advice, added a little extra white chocolate, doubled the amount of crust, and put the cake in a water bath. When the hour of cooking was up, I turned off the oven and let it sit for another hour in the cooling oven. It was perfect! Also, I substituted strawberries for raspberries since it's what I had and wanted to get rid of. Absolutely wonderful!

absolutely amazing! cheesecake has been my specialty but Cindy Ann this was the greatest hit this Christmas. Everybody loved it! Thank you. I added heavy whipping cream instead of half and half and it came out really good and creamy and wasn't overwhelming at all. Thank you, thank you!

I made it a milk chocolate cheesecake by using milk chocolate chips in place of white and left out the raspberry sauce. Very good!

I've tried this recipe last night and I quite like it but it was a lil bit heavy and too creamy! I don't know where I went wrong but in my country we don't have "Half and Half" so I made the substitute which was milk and melted butter. I think the substitute didn't work well as half & half does.I baked it for one hour and left it at oven while turned off for another hour as most of you suggested. When I took it out of the oven it was jiggling as one piece especially in the middle! But all over it was delish but not the best.

This was absolutely amazing. Beautiful presentation and delicious. Everyone raved about how good it was. I used the whole oreo cookie and added only a tbsp of sugar and 1/4 of butter for the crust. The raspberry sauce is very good. I used the frozen, didn't want to risk the shortcut with the jam, I was afraid it would be to sweet. I will make this again...

This was my first cheesecake ever and it came out really well. I have made three in the past month. Two for thanksgiving family functions with a request for another for Christmas. One of the things I modified was the procedure to make the raspberry mixture. First i combined only the raspberry sugar and water, once it was all mixed I strained it then put it back on the fire adding the cornstarch after. I also added an extra tbsp of cornstarch as i felt it was little too thin after the first cheesecake. You can also use this recipe to make a strawberry, blueberry, wild berry, etc type white chocolate cheesecake. The other thing with this recipe is that you have a lot of raspberry mixture left over if you use only the 6 tablespoons so I used a pastry bag and added the raspberry mixture to the middle half first then made a nice design on top and used a knife as suggested to marble it.

I've made this cheesecake twice; I thought the original recipe was fantastic, but, after reading the reviews, I made a few of the tweaks others suggested. It made a wonderful difference. I increased the amount of white chocolate chips to 3 cups. I melted the chips (with half and half) in the microwave rather than in a double boiler. I also used 6 T seedless black raspberry jam (heated in the microwave for 30 seconds) for middle filling and then again over the top (12 T total). I baked the cheesecake in a water bath for 55 minutes. Once finished, I turned off the oven, opened the oven door and let the cheesecake sit in the oven for six hours. I then put it in the refrigerator. The texture of this cheesecake is fabulous, and the increased amount of white chocolate and black raspberry provided a stronger flavor. Great recipe to start with, but glad I followed other reviewers suggestions - they made a terrific recipe even better!

This recipe came out pretty well. I read some of the negative reviews and saw some people had a problem with the cheesecake setting up. I added 2 tablespoons of flour to offset this and to help avoid cracking. I added the listed amount of raspberry sauce to the cheesecake. I felt that the cheesecake didn't have enough raspberry flavor and it was overpowered by the white chocolate. Next time, I'll add more raspberry sauce.

This is excellent cheesecake! I made this for Christmas Eve dinner and my mom asked me to make it for her next birthday. I admit I picked this recipe based on the reviews because "white chocolate/raspberry" wouldn't be my first choice but boy this was really good!  I will definitely make it again--it would be great for valentines day since you can easily make hearts on top with the raspberry drizzle.  I used Oreos for base with 1 T. of sugar and 1/4 cup melted butter.  Next time I will reduce butter, I had butter dripping out the bottom of the pan which smoked up the house!  Also, it takes some time to strain the raspberry sauce.  I found it goes faster if you keep stirring it rather than letting it sit.  It was well worth the effort.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this cheesecake for Christmas, and everyone loved it. It was pretty easy to make and looked very pretty when finished. I used chocolate graham crackers for the crust. The raspberry sauce is very good, but for us there wasn't enough of it. Once you use the sauce in the cheesecake, there isn't a lot left to serve as a topping. I just took what was left and poured it over the top, but next time I would probably double it, so I would have something to pass at the table. It has a great flavor. I'm not a huge fan of white chocolate, but the flavor of it isn't detectable in the cheesecake. Very nice texture. I'll definitely make this one again. Next time I would use a water bath because mine cracked on top - still tasted great though!

Update:
I turned this recipe into mini cheesecakes for Valentine's Day, and they turned out amazing! Everyone loved them!
Original review: 
I followed Clemsonmav's advice and used seedless raspberry jam instead of making the sauce. I also cut the sugar down to only 1/5 cup, since Oreos, white chocolate, and jam already have extremely high sugar content. The sweetness wasn't lacking at all! I should mention that I also used a waterbath--I ALWAYS use a waterbath as they prevent sinking and cracking. But for some reason I had a bit of trouble determining when it was ready. The recipe states that you should take it out in an hour, but by then the cheesecake was still wobbly. It wasn't ready until 45 minutes later, when it was firm but a bit wobbly in the center. After that I put it in the freezer for a few hours and served it. It was delicious!--no cracks, no sinking, and it wasn't burnt. No wonder it's a 5-star recipe with 1800 reviews! My family said it was equivilent to The Cheesecake Factory's cheesecakes, and that's saying a lot, considering I'm only 16 years old and an intermediate baker. I'm definitely making this again!

I have never made cheesecake before, but I got RAVE reviews. I used the water bath (see the video on how to make a cheesecake on this website). As recommended by another reviewer, I pureed the raspberries, water (used 3/4 cup) and sugar, then strained, then cooked with cornstarch.  I also baked the cake for 1 hour, turned off heat and left in the oven for another hour (never opening the oven the entire time), then left on counter until completely cool before putting in refrigerator covered in plastic wrap overnight. I was quite proud of my success.

I will admit I tweaked this recipe just a bit, because (don't kill me) I hate chocolate wafer crust on cheesecake. Instead I subbed in a cup and a quarter shortbread cookie crumbles with 1/4 cup pecans, ground fine in a food processor. That and adding white chocolate chips to the raspberry sauce in the middle of the cake were all that I changed to the recipe, and this cheesecake was completely fabulous. Sent it with my husband for a party, and even people who professed not to like cheesecake were raving. Thank you so much for the recipe - I feel like a superhero having made it!

I found this recipe a while back and I made it for Fourth of July. Boy was I surprised that is was gone within 15 min!!!! I love making it and everyone loves eating it. I'm always getting asked to make it again. When I took it to my work party last week everyone was raving how it was some of the best cheesecake they have tasted!!! The only thing I changed was instead of just plain chocolate cookies, I used oreos. It gave it that extra umph. Thank you!!!!

I use chocolate graham crackers for the crust and bake for 1 hour at 350, then leave it in the oven for another hour.

Turned out great.

UPDATE: For no cracks, I bake in a water bath and cool slowly.

First, put two sheets of tinfoil together, to cover the whole bottom and sides of the spring form pan, and set in a large glass baking dish.  I put in two cups of tap hot water and bake at 325 degrees for 55 minutes.

I turn off the oven and crack and let cool for 30 minutes in the oven, then remove from the water bath and cool on the counter for an hour before putting in the refrigerator.

Fabulous taste and texture for this cake.  I often use fresh berries for a little bit more tartness.  Thanks for sharing.

I had to become a member just so I could review this! Absolutely fabulous and I'm not a big cheesecake fan. Never even made a "real" one before this. But: who can resist chocolate & raspberries! It's wonderful just as directed to make but everyone loves different amounts of raspberries/chocolate. The microwave techniques from other reviewers helped quicken the process of this dessert. Thanks CindyAnn for my new FAVORITE indulgence!

Awesome Awesome Awesome. Was a lot of prep work, never done a cheesecake before, but was a lot of fun to make (with moms help), and turned out to be the biggest hit out of all the cakes, pies we served on thanksgiving. That was the only problem, I was hoping for leftovers!

This cheesecake is always a hit with family and friends.  I also did what another review suggested and used the complet oreo for the bottom crust.  I would take the cream out first to crumble the oreo and when that was done, I added the cream back in to mix it together with a tablespoon of melted butter and it works perfectly!

Made this cheesecake for Thanksgiving dinner last year but left it as a white chocolate cheesecake and made a cranberry topping for it. The tart cranberry offsets the sweet filling. You can make your own with a bag of cranberrys and some sugar (cooked down of course) or even a can of good quality whole cranberry jelly will work. I garnished it with dark chocolate curls...rave reviews from family.

Made this last night and it was DELICIOUS downside, I made mine in a pre made Oreo cookie pie pan (worked fine tho and less work) but my husband and I have a slice of this at cheesecake factory every year for our anniversary and I can say now I will make a whole one for about the same price they taste exactly the same to me (without the experience of going out that is :) )

This is an amazing recipe! This cheesecake is so smooth, rich, and creamy, far better than any cheesecake I've had in a restaurant or bought in a store. I add a bit of cornstarch to the batter and cook in a water bath to prevent cracking. I also use a bit more of the berry sauce than the recipe calls for. This last cheesecake I made was the third one using this recipe and every cheesecake turned out amazing, people who I share it with just rave about it. Will definitely use this again and again and thank you so much for posting it! Oh and before I forget, I shut off the oven at 45 minutes and leave the cheesecake set for 2 hours before taking out to let cool out of the oven. Also helps with cracking.

Used this recipe and the cheesecake tips available on allrecipes.com to make my first ever cheesecake. It actually turned out amazingly well, my family loved it and I would for sure make this again. I followed the tips in other reviews and used seedless jam instead of making my own sauce and also melted the white chocolate chips in the microwave.

I followed the directions, step by step. Mine like many others, came out mushy and fell apart. I felt like either the cheesecake needs to be cooked longer or something in the directions is missing.

This is an amazing cheesecake. I used between 2-3 cups of white chocolate chips, and the flavor is pretty strong. I made the raspberry sauce but also bought seedless raspberry jam, and I decided to use the jam in the cake, and it worked great. For the crust I put something like 22 Oreos in the Cuisinart, which was less than 2 cups of crumbs but I didn't measure exactly, and mixed that with butter. I baked it in a water bath for an hour, then turned off the oven and let it sit until it was cool. The cake turned out beautiful, and it's so delicious. I will absolutely make this again. Next time I might use blueberry jam.

Later edit: I made this again with a regular graham cracker crust, 2 bars of Ghiradelli white baking chocolate, and both raspberry and blueberry jam. I put whipped cream on top and fresh raspberries and blueberries, and took it to my family 4th of July party. Everybody loved it, and numerous people told me that they don't usually like cheese cake but they loved this one. It was definitely the favorite dessert there. I know I will make this cake  many times.

This cake tastes good but was not firm enough to cut nicely and I over baked it a bit. I'm going to play around with the idea, but for starters, I think baking the crust for 5 min before adding the cheesecake will help. Also, mixing the butter in the food processors makes the crust too fine and hard, I would mix the butter in by hand and press the crust into the pan. When I figure out how to make the cheesecake firmer I'll let you know.

To save time, I'd agree to use raspberry seedless jam.  I used graham cracker crust, and it tasted great!  If you do use real raspberries, it's probably easier to strain BEFORE putting int the starch.  Mine didn't crack and looked beautiful: water bath, let it sit in oven for an hour, then cool and place in refrigerator.

I've made this about 5 times and it is AMAZING! I recently ate at The Cheesecake Factory and tried their raspberry cheesecake and this recipe is just as good as theirs. I love this, if cheesecake didn't all the fat and calories I'd make this all the time. So delicious.

This cheesecake is easy and delicious! The first time I made it, I accidentally left out all the eggs! I made a second cheesecake with the eggs. I must say, I think the cheesecake is creamier and smoother WITHOUT the eggs. That is the only way I make it now...no eggs :)

Fantastic once again, Followed recipe to a "T" fantastic.  First time I made it I put down the first layer of raspberry sauce then poured batter in middle of cheesecake, thus pushing the raspberry layer to the edge.  This year I spooned batter on top of first layer of raspberry with much better results in the finished product.

Great recipe.  I baked the crust for 10 minutes at 325 so the crust had a little crunch.  I would definitely bake this again.

I don't know if it was my oven but the center would not cook. It was also difficult to taste the white chocolate in the cake. Next time I will add more choch.

Excellent cheesecake recipe.  I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of white chocolate, keeping everything else the same, and my coworkes said it looked professional!  This is most definitely going in my recipe book.  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars was because of the issues I had straining the raspberries.

Nice and easy recipe to follow.  I posted a picture.  This was my first time attempting a cheesecake, and I feel pleased with the results.  Ready to make another!    Hopefully the next time I wont over beat the cheese filling and have another cracked top.

This recipe comes out beautiful and delicious. I made an organic version for my environmental science class and my peers could barely believe that I had made it. If you want to impress people with the appearance and taste of your dish this is the recipe for you!

I just hosted my sisters bridal shower and made this cheesecake especially for the occasion.  Needless to say I followed the recipe exactly and Nobody believed I made it myself and from scratch.  I've always been good at baking and cooking, but they all thought it was from the Cheesecake Factory.  It is by far one of the best cheesecakes I've ever had!

AWESOME! I took this into work, and everyone loved it! I used low fat cream cheese, and added in some seedless raspberry jam into the raspberry sauce. I'm also going to try this with blueberries! :)

I brought this cake to a woman's club meeting tonight and every bite of this cheesecake was gone!! Delicious! I followed the recipe EXACTLY as it was written. The cheescake did crack even though I used the water bath and left in the oven for an extra hour with the oven turned off  as recommened  in the cheesecake tutorial on this site. No matter, I just covered the cracks with raspberries. I will definately make again!!!!!!

This was the 1st cheesecake I've ever made & is the BEST I've ever eaten.  I got rave reviews!!  Next time I will double the crust & make extra sauce to serve it with.  YUM!! DEFINATELY read the tips 1st.  I cooked it in a water bath, left it in the oven for an hour after turning it off, and took a knife around the edge right after I took it out.  I truely believe that's what made it look so good!

If there were more stars to give for this one, I really would give them! A little hesitant to make my first cheesecake (that springform is daunting at first glance..), I followed your recipe pretty much to the letter. I only changed the crust (to graham cracker) & and berries used (blueberry, I never see blueberry cheesecakes). I cooked it in a water bath and after the hour of cooking, I let it sit in the oven, while it was off for another hour. It worked like a charm!  It came out smooth, rich & tasty! I will definitely be using this recipe over and over! Now I don't have to wonder why there's no blueberry cheescakes in the store. Thank you for sharing and making my first cheesecake super successful!

This is definitely a favorite in our house. I made in the water bath and let it cool in the oven for an hour. It came out with no cracks or sinking at all. The second time I made it I heated up raspberry jam instead of doing fresh raspberries. I worked just as well and was less time consuming.

Fantastic! Made this for Easter dinner and it was a huge hit. Took others' suggestion on using jam instead of making the syrup (thanks for the time saving tip!) and used Nilla wafers for the crust (doubled as recommended) as I am not a fan of chocolate cookies. Looked beautiful and tasted wonderful. Thanks for the recipe!

This cheesecake is excellent! I have made it over 15 times and I'm finally getting around to leaving a comment. The only down side of making this cheesecake is I never have a chance to try other cheesecakes as everyone requests this one for special events.  I too always bake it in a water bath for one hour and then let it set for an hour with the oven door open. This has led to great results.  I also use Oreo cookies for the crust so cut the sugar and butter down.  Ohh, and I've never made it with Raspberries... my version is always made with huckleberries and I always double the amount of huckleberry sauce as it's great to have a pitcher of extra sauce for people to pour over their piece.

I have made this twice now.  I stuck to the recipe exactly except that I used white chocolate bars instead of chips because I wanted to make sure they were real white chocolate and not just vanilla chips.  I have gotten the BEST compliments on this.  An elderly friend of mine just called me and said it was the best thing she had ever tasted.  It is hands down me and my husband's favorite cheesecake!  Next time I will try using regular chocolate instead of white chocolate, because I am a chocaholic!

I've made this over and over...it is simply amazing!  I serve it with a white chocolate sauce.  I ALWAYS get asked for the recipe.  Even people who say they don't usually enjoy cheesecake ask for this recipe.

I am making this cheesecake for the fourth time since Valentine's Day, and each time it gets rave reviews. It is absolutely scrumptious! I have to admit that I now just buy seedless rasberrry jam, melt it in a saucepan, and use it instead og making the sauce. Try it! You may enjoy making this even more!

this was my first attempt to make cheesecake and it turned out wonderful! everyone thought i bought it, but i do think the white chocolate was a bit too sweet. i'd lessen the amount or leave out completely. the cheesecake will be awesome w/o it.

I loved this cheesecake and so did my cooking club! I doubled the cookie crumbs and increased sugar to 4 tbsp. and butter to 1/3 cup. I skipped the frozen raspberries, and used a good raspberry jam. Worked great! Baked this with a pan of hot water underneath the springform pan, and there were no cracks. Delicious!!!

Very yummy!!!  I added crushed macadamia nuts and cinnamon to the oreo crust, followed the other reviews by leaving the cheesecake in the oven after an hour of baking.  I still have 2 cracks but covered it with fresh raspberries:-)  My family and friends loved this recipe!  I used seedless raspberry preserve to cut down prep time.  I will continue to make this recipe!

AMAZING! It turned out awesome the first time. EVERYONE loved it. The only thing I would do differently is use raspberry preserves next time instead of make my own. The seeds did not really matter.

I LOVED the taste of this. Kind of wish it was a little more chocolatey, perhaps next time I can top it with chocolate shavings. The only problem I had was oreo crust burnt really bad and couldnt be eaten. not sure why that happened.

Being in the middle east currently, I had a hard time finding all the ingredients, so I had to improvise!  I used double the amount of flour instead of cornstarch, frozen strawberries, milk chocolate drops, milk w a little bit of melted butter instead of half half.  This was my first cheesecake and I didn't even have an electric mixer or even a whisk!  So I ended up with a blister on my hand from the wooden spoon mixing, and even then I couldn't get all lumps out of the cream cheese!  I didn't know what "thick" consistency was for the sauce but I think that mine was too thick as it sunk into the cake.  Used the water bath and cooling in oven method and there was only one small crack, but hidden as the sauce looked like cracks!  However, even after all this, the cake still tasted fantastic!  better 48hrs onwards than 24hrs.

I'm not a fan of cheesecake but this was amazing! I made it for my co-workers and they all LOVED it.. Instead of a plain raspberry sauce I added in blueberries as well and made a chocolate ganache for the top and substituted raspberries for strawberries, blueberries and mint and added shaved white chocolate to the top. Great recipe!

I forgot the half and half, accidentally set the oven temp. to high and it still turned out perfect.  I did use the water bath that is recommended for cheesecakes and the top did not crack or sink.  I used organic raspberry preserves and just microwaved it for 30 seconds.  Crushed Oreo's with the cream scraped off for the crust and it was wonderful.  Definitely recommend it, even if you are new to baking cheesecakes.

This was wonderful!  I made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it.  I added extra oreo cookies as other reviewers had suggested so that it filled the bottom of the pan.  Cooked it for the full time, and then turned off the oven and cracked the oven door and left it in there for an additional 20-30 mins to prevent the cheesecake from cracking.  I also added chocolate chips and fresh raspberries to the top of the cake for decoration.  Definitely will be making this again!

AWESOME! I took the advice of others and used knockoff oreos and doubled the crumbs. I made the raspberry sauce and it was great, not too sweet. I also covered the bottom of the pan with foil and baked it in a water bath until the top was firm.

Loved this cheesecake and so did my husband.  I baked it in a water bath but forgot to put foil around my pan.  My crust was the only thing affected.  I also used seedless raspberry jam instead and 2 cups crushed Oreo cookies.  I will be doing this one again.

This is an excellent and highly recommended cheesecake recipe. I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers, using Oreo cookie as the base, increasing the amount of melted butter and omitting the sugar altogether for the base. I also halved the amount of sugar mixed with the cream cheese for a not-too-sweet cheesecake. The result is fantastic and the whole family loved it!

This was absolutely delicious!  The OREO cookie crust was amazing.  I took it to work yesterday and it was gone in less than 10 minutes...today, I've had one of the guys already ask me when I'm going to make it again!  :-)

I love this cheesecake. I have made it twice now. What keeps on happening to mine though is that it rises a lot, but then as soon as i take it out of the over it goes flat. This then makes the appearance terrible. Not sure what I'm doing wrong, but it still tastes great

Made this for a valentines dinner and it was so easy and YUMMY! I did use the jar of preserves and it made this recipe so simple! I also used a store bought oreo crust and it turned out great! I melted some perserves right before serving and then drizzled it over the 12 individual slices of cheesecake. Everyone loved the warm raspberry sauce!

This is a terrific recipe - I have made it several times and everyone raves about it - it's my new favorite cheesecake recipe. One word of caution - get the right size wire mesh strainer for the raspberry sauce, too fine and the juice can hardly get through - too big and the seeds come through also.

This is a great cheesecake recipe! I made it for my sister's birthday and it was a huge hit! I took a few shortcuts- used raspberry preserves instead of making the sauce, and I melted the white chocolate in the microwave. It still turned out beautifully.

I did change it, but only because I don't like white chocolate in this form.  So instead of the white chocolate part, I combined semisweet chocolate chips with evaporated milk and mixed that into the cheesecake batter.  I also used raspberry pie filling instead but found it still needed to be sieved.  Regardless, it was absolutely delicious and a HUGE success (make sure you  also follow the cheesecake tips provided on allrecipes.com).  I definitely plan on making it again.

Brought it to work, everyone loved it, my boss even bought one from me! You can definitely taste the white chocolate in the mix, wasnt exactly my thing. But, everyone seemed to like it and it was beautiful. I would recommend waiting to pour in the raspberry glaze until after you have poured all of your batter in. Also, be careful not to over cook because the ribbons of raspberry glaze tend to crack on top.

I forgot to add that I did not strain the seeds out of the raspberries and could not tell there were any in there.  It was perfectly fine without straining it.

My cheesecake came out a little funky, as it sunk in and the crust was hard as a rock (not sure why).  I also forgot to add the vanilla, but it still turned out to be delicious!  Everyone loved it, and I will definitely try making it again after studying up on cheesecake techniques.

This recipe is delicious, the first time I have ever made a cheese cake in my life and it turned out AMAZING! The only thing I would suggest is to make the crust a little thicker. The crust wasn't that great when I made it and I am going to make it again with a much thicker crust. I highly recommend that you make this cheesecake. It is great for beginners and intermediate cooks.

I'm not a big cheesecake fan but those I baked it for all thought it was fantastic. I do think that 1.5 C of crushed Oreos is plenty.

This is a great recipe.  I took advice from other reviewers and was glad I did.  I used the raspberry jam, and it was a great idea.  Instead of the chips, I used a Ghirardelli White choc bars (3-4oz bars).  Next time I will use 4 bars to get more white choc flavor.  Also, baked in water bath 50 min., then left in oven (turned off, door shut) for another 50 min.  No cracks, Perfect!  everyooe raved about it.

Only change I made was to go with a graham cracker crust.  Otherwise, this cake was given the best reviews I have ever gotten from my family and friends.  I have been making cheesecakes for years, and I can say that this is tied for the best with the turtle cheesecake...just depends what your in the mood for!

Excellent!! Everyone loved this for Christmas dinner!! I did make a few changes that I think were definitely needed. I doubled the ingredients for the crust, I don't know how 1cup would be enough.  And I substitued heavy whipping cream for the half and half which made it creamier.  But I'm sure I'll be using this recipe again.

This cake is DELICIOUS! I used raspberry preserves, added 2 cups of chocolate cookie crumbs and deleted the sugar all together as some recommended. Then I added 4 cups of white chocolate chips as one reviewer suggested. YUMMY! I found an easy raspberry sauce that made this cheesecake a MUST DO for special occasions.

This was our Christmas dinner dessert and it wowed the family. Because of the chocolate and the cream cheese combination, it is very rich, and a small slice is more than enough (which means it serves lots of people and there are leftovers for Boxing Day). Thanks for sharing this recipe, Cindy Ann  it's a real keeper!

This is an excellent recipe; I have made this cheesecake four times now and every time it turns out perfectly. I leave it in the oven to cool and so I get few if any cracks in the top. I found that the crust had a bit too much butter, so I decreased this according to how it looked... so you couldn't see the grease of the butter but it still held nicely together. This is a favourite among my friends and I would recommend it to anyone!

THIS IS THE BEST CHEESECAKE I HAVE EVER HAD!!!  It came out amazing, it looked like it had been professionally made.  My fiancee, daughter and co-workers loved it.  I followed the recipe and the only thing I changed is that instead of half & half I used heavy whipping cream. Hummmmm cannot wait to make it again!!!

This is an amazing recipe!  I have never been disappointed by it.  It tastes great and presents well. I have used both frozen and fresh rasberries and both worked equally as well.  I usually use double chocolate oreos and crush them in a blender for the crust and add a few more than the recipe calls for because I think my pan must be an inch bigger than standard size.  Make sure you make this with enough time to let it chill for at least 4 hours. 8 is best though.  Once I didn't have time so even though it looked and tasted perfect it wasn't quite set and we found that out after cutting it.

This recipe is delicious and some of my co-workers said the best cheesecake they'd ever tasted!  The only thing I did differently was that I used 12 oz of fresh blueberries instead of frozen raspberries.  I pureed them in the blender first before adding to the saucepan.  I'd imagine any type of berry would be delicious in this cheesecake!!

Only additional suggestions to what has already been said is that I prefer to bake my crust before adding the cheesecake mix.  Personal preference really.  Also, consider adding in the vanilla to the melted chips and mixing the flour w/wet mixture (possibly a tiny amount of half/half) before adding to rest of cheesecake to assure you don't have lump issues.  My vanilla and flour lumped together.  It took a good 10 minutes to smash out all the lumps so no one received a concentrated dose of vanilla extract (YUMMY!) Additionally, I like the idea of adding more white chocolate.  However, the consistency is great "as is" so I'm not one to wonder too far outside the box.  It's a keeper!

I followed the suggestions of microwaving raspberry perserve (I used the seed-full kind and it works just fine) and I microwaved the half-half cream and white chocolate chips.  I also added 6oz of semi-sweet choc chips i had lying around, and they made the cake look chocolate-ier :) yum. yum. yum.  this is a great receipe

Just made this cheesecake for a Thanksgiving party at work....it is soooo good! raspberry, cheesecake, white chocolate, and oreo crust blend amazingly. I had never made cheesecake before and it wasn't that hard. I followed the cheesecake tips and put a baking sheet with water on the rack below the cheesecake and left the cheesecake in the oven after turning the oven off. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

I would give this recipe 8 stars!  My son-in-law whose favorite desset is cheesecake declared it better than Cheesecake Factory and I have to agree!  I used a water bath and left it in the oven another hour after I turned it off to cool slowly and it was perfectly gorgeous.  I will leave it with the oven turned on for another 10 minutes next time just because the center was ever so soft but ovens vary so that could just be mine.

I made this for a family gathering and everyone loved it! As another reviewer suggested, I wrapped the bottom of the cheesecake pan and baked it in a baking sheet with water. This helped the cheesecake turn out perfect. I also only put the extra raspberry spread just around the edge of the cheesecake after baking to hold the fresh raspberries.

I've made this cheesecake twice now and it is fantastic.  The only change I made was following another reviewer's suggestion and used seedless raspberry jam.  I'm glad I did-so much easier and still delicious.  My sister-in-law loved it and said she couldn't wait for me to make it again!  Highly reccommended!

This is an awesome recipe if you manage to get it right. I say "right" because I've always had trouble with overboiling the raspberry sauce and end up not having enough to mix into the cake. =( I've never tried the chocolate cookie crumb crust, but instead opt for a graham cracker crust and think it tastes just fine.

mmmMMmMmm! the raspberry sauce took longer than 5 minutes at boiling to thicken, so watch out for that.   also, i baked it for an hour in a water bath, turned off the oven, opened the door for a minute to let heat escape, then closed it and let the cake sit inside for about another hour, then the fridge for the 8 hours. it set up wonderfully.  the sauce is especially amazing.

I made this w/& w/out raspberry - came out fantastic both times.  I did use seedless raspberry preserves - just heated & poured over - I think that real raspberries would make it even better - if that's possible!!

This has become my signature cheesecake.  People keep begging me to make it.  I tried it with strawberry but it was too overpowering.  The raspberry is perfect, and I don't like raspberries.  Perfect combination of chocolate, white chocolate, and berry.  Very creamy and rich.  Definitely a keeper as written.

This is a great recipe. I took it to work for an employee's birthday and it was gone fast. Everyone wanted the recipe. The only change I used 2c of oreos and 1 tablespoon of sugar for the crust. I also used Dickinson's pure seedless cascade mountain red raspberry preserves.The key for a moist and non crack cheesecake is to bake in a waterbath.

Loved this recipe. My family isn't big on white chocolate, so I substituted dark chocolate for the white and it was perfect.  I used oreo cookies for the crust. Since the cookies are already sweet, I didn't add any of the sugar recommended for the crust.  Also, instead of using the raspberry mixture recommended in the recipe, I melted down some Just Fruit raspberry jam, which worked fine and tasted great. Love this!

Wonderful!  Made hubby this for Fathers Day & everyone loved it! I did not find it overly sweet, and the cheesecake had a light and fluffy texture. I used crushed chocolate grahams for the crust.  However, mine heavily cracked--next time I will make sure to read some of the reviews to find out the proper way to bake it.

This was so good. The contrast between the sweet cookie crust, white chocolate & raspberry sauce is great. I processed oreo cookies for the crust. I debated on whether or not to take the white filling out before processing. I didn't & it turned out fine. I will use a shallow pan with water under the cheesecake during baking time the next time I make this because mine had some cracks.

My roommates and friends loved it. However, since I didn't have a spring-form pan, I used a ready made chocolate cookie crust. I wonder though, if using white chocolate truffles instead of regular white chocolate change the texture of the cheesecake? I'll need to try that sometime.

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could. Only changes to ingredients I made were I used: 1. crushed oreos for crust (if you do this, you can leave out the additional sugar in crust) and 2. bagged white chocolate chips. My oven runs very hot, so I reduced the temp to 300 for first 30 mins and increased to 325 for last 30 mins. Also used water bath. Came out perfectly, no cracking at all. Drizzled extra sauce on plate, then slice of cheesecake, and topped with a little whipped topping and one whole raspberry. Rivals anything you might get at a nice restaurant. Really great recipe.

This was great!  I couldn't find chocolate cookie crumbs and didn't feel like making my own, so I used the Basic Cheesecake recipe's crust from this site.  No cracks in the cake either.  Fabulous.

I have made many cheesecakes over the years and this one was the biggest hit!  I used Oreo cookies to make the crust as somebody else had suggested.  I also doubled the raspberry sauce.  I used three tablespoons of sauce in the middle of the cheesecake but I would probably increase that next time since it looked like there was just raspberry swirled on the top.  Since I sliced my cheesecake prior to serving, I put a dollop of the sauce on the plate and then the cheesecake.  I put fresh raspberries on top and sprinkled white chocolate shavings on top of the cheesecake and sauce.

This was awesome!  I just recently made this and did the same as some other reviews.  I used seedless rasberry jelly instead of the bagged raspberries.  It worked a lot better.  I also warmed some up and spread it over top.  I followed all the "perfect" cheesecake recipies and did the water bath and left it in the oven after cooking for an hour.  It was perfect, no cracks and didn't sink in the middle.  It was the best!  Yummy!

This was amazing! I served it for a group dinner, and the people loved it! The only thing I ran into was that I didn't have a strainer for the raspberry sauce, so I didn't strain it and it was fine. Ridiculously yummy recipe!

I made this a strawberry cheesecake instead for my birthday. Everyone loved it and it wasn't hard at all for my first cheesecake. It didn't crack at all. I used a water bath and let it rest in the oven and made sure the sides of the pan were sprayed with pam to not pull. Very enjoyable!

So, this was my second attempt at homemade cheesecake (the first time was a complete disaster!) and it turned out marvelous! I used chocolate graham crackers for the crust, melted the white chocolate and cream in the microwave, and like others, I used a seedless raspberry jam which I heated up in the microwave instead of making from scratch. All those changes worked wonderfully...they saved me from extra work and extra dirty dishes. I baked it in a springform pan, and instead of setting it IN a water bath, I put a shallow pan of water on the rack right under it. When it was done I cracked the oven door and let it cool in the oven for about three hours, then refrigerated overnight. One tiny little crack appeared but by the time I garnished it with extra raspberry glaze, fresh raspberries, and chocolate shavings, no one was none the wiser. This was for my husband's birthday and was a great alternative to the usual cake. Got TONS of compliments on the professional look and taste, and with me, compliments are ALWAYS welcome;)

This was amazing!! My 1st time making a cheesecake and I followed one of the comments about covering the bottom with foil and doing the water bath then letting the cheesecake sit in the oven for an hour after the oven was turned off.  I had no problems at all, will be making again. Start early! I started at 11 pm and by the time I could put the cake in the fridge it was close to 2 am! About 1 hour prep, then 1 hour in the oven, then 1 hour sitting so it was a 3 hour process from start to finish being when I could put the cooled cheesecake in the fridge and go to bed! it looked gorgeous too!!

Amazing and a huge hit! I used light cream cheese so it was not as rich.

Excellent recipe! I purchased the ready-made oreo pie crust and add 1T sugar and 2 T melted butter, crushed and reformed in my springform pan. Worked great! Enjoy

Best cheesecake EVER!! The tartness of the rasberries and the sweetness of the white chocolate balance eachother out so it is just perfect. I made this for my daughter's birhtday and everyone loved it!

Easy to make and tasty to eat.  However, I agree with previous reviews that there is no need to purchase the raspberries and make your own sauce, simply heat seedless raspberry jam.

10+ stars.  Wow, this is a wonderful recipe!!  I followed others' advice and doubled the raspberry sauce, using frozen raspberries.  It's a lot of work straining the raspberries but definitely worth the effort.  Baked it in a water bath then let it cool in the oven for 1 hour.  Turned out great and my family enjoyed it too!!!  Thank you CindyAnn.

SOOO GOOD!! My crust didn't turn out right so that is something I will have to work on, but I rated this a 5 because I followed another reviewers advice for the crust, which called for 2 C oreos, 1/4 C butter and 1T sugar...this made the crust an oreo flavored goo, which wasn't at all appealing so it's a good thing it stuck to the bottom of the pan and didn't end up on our plates! I was told that the cheesecake was "sensational" and that I will now be responsible for Thanksgiving and Christmas dessert! lol Like others, I also baked the cheesecake in a water bath then let it cool in the oven. There were no cracks or sinking. Can't wait to make this again!

Fabulous recipe, it turned out wonderful :-)  Note- do NOT use raspberry jam as someone else suggested.  Use a bag of frozen raspberries or fresh.  I served mine with an extra side of raspberry puree and it was a huge hit!

I also simplified and used jam and melted the chips in the microwave.  That makes the recipe much easier, but still delicious!

When I took my first bite, my eyes crossed and I could've sworn I heard Santa Claus telling me I'd been a *real* good boy this year! Wow. Simply wow. Thanks to all the previous reviewers who gave "how to" hints, also. This was only my second time with a cheesecake (the first was an unmitigated disaster long ago), but I think I've been missing something on the menu which I need to remedy!

i made it exactly like the recipe. I used teddy grahams for my crust. I did melt the chocolate/half and half mixture in the microwave and it worked fine. This was a HUGE hit. I served with just a few fresh raspberries.

I made this cheesecake as my very first cheesecake, and it turned out great! Everyone at my work loved it and my boss even requested this for her birthday! I read previous reviews and made the oreo crust with 2c oreos, 1 tbs sugar, and 1/4c melted butter. SO good!

Been thinking about making this recipe for awhile, I finally got a chance to make it and turned out really well. Great texture and flavor. I did cheat and use the seedless raspberry jam. Also for my crust, I made Graham Cracker Crust 1 from this site and added 1/4 cocoa powder for a nice crust with a touch of chocolate flavor.

I have made this several times, usually for my husband's birthday every year. I wish I hadn't tried a different recipe this year!   Do increase the crust recipe. Do use a water bath. (Wrap that pan with TWO layers of heavy duty foil! I've had leaks and it ruins the crunchy of the crust.) Do let it cool as long as they say...I thought mine wouldn't set in the middle, but it always does.   I didn't bother removing the berry seeds, and I increased the amount of sauce in the cake.   Oh my, I miss this cake so much, lol. The Citrus Cheesecake is not cutting it, but maybe I've lost my knack and baked it too long. (That recipe only got 8 of 10 stars from DH. This one gets 10, it is the standard by which we measure!)   Enjoy.

This recipe was perfect. I used a couple of hints that other people suggested in the recipe rating. I used raspberry preserves and I melted the white chocolate in the microwave with the half and half. My husband loved it ! He's not a chocolate fan so instead of chocolate cookie crumbs, I used vanilla cookies (Cream center and all) and it was a total hit with my special valentine, Scott my hubby of twenty years.

I just made this for my boyfriend for Valentine's day, and it turned out excellent! I used 2 packages of reduced fat cream cheese and 1 package of fat free cream cheese, along with fat free half and half, and it still tasted absolutely divine. I used all the raspberry sauce because we like raspberries. For the crust I crushed up some oreos. I had to bake it about 20 minutes longer than the recipe stated, but that just might be my oven. Overall very good, and I would definitely make it again!

So amazing!!  I didn't have a strainer so my raspberry sauce had the seeds in it - still tasted great!!  I did 1.5X the oreo crust because I had a 10" pan.

Great taste!  I had a hard time getting the seeds out of the raspberry mixture.  Next time try raspberry jam or just plain with toppings.

This cheesecake was awesome. I never used to like cheesecake, but this one made me like it. I think if I ever make it again I will use the jam and the microwave for the chocolate as well. There seemed to be so many dishes doing it the other way. I did do the pan underneath with foil and it seemed to come out great. Although I'm not much of a decorator when it comes to deserts but it was just for me and my husband. Good recipe!

This cheesecake was excellent.  I really enjoyed the chocolate cookie crust.  I left the seeds in the raspberry sauce (more because I had nothing to strain it with than anything else) and I actually really like the texture it added.

Family reviews said "best ever!" I used chocolate graham crackers, used 1/2 cup more for crust.  I would suggest using the largest springform pan you have, this is thick.  I microwaved the chocolate and cream together, no problems, also used the raspberry preserves as others suggested, also topped with homemade whipped cream and more sauce.  Super rich and super good.

A big hit at X-Mas dinner! I used regular graham cracker crumbs for the crust and raspberry preserves with the seeds and no one noticed the difference. Swirled some of the preserves in the batter prior to cooking and the rest on top after cooking. Garnished with fresh raspbarries. Will definately make again!

Amazing.  Utterly amazing.  I cannot adequately describe what a great recipe this is.  I followed the directions exactly, baked in a water bath, and left it in the oven about 10 minutes longer than called for.  After cooking, I left the oven door cracked for about a half hour before removing, cooling on the counter, and chilling overnight.  It was gorgeous and the texture was so smooth and creamy.  It got rave reviews from everyone who ate it.  They said it was "a million times better than Cheesecake Factory" :)

I served this cheesecake last time for my New Years dinner party and it was a complete hit!   My friends were very impressed.  I used the tip of the seedless rasberry jam (worked great!)  I also freezed the cheesecake the night before and thawed out in the frig the day of the party!  I was a hit!!

Great Cheesecake, followed other reviews to bake in another pan w/ water, but forgot to wrap the springform in foil, so crust was soggy...still very good though. Will definetly make again, only next time remembering to use the foil.

I made this for a family Christmas party and it was a huge hit!!  We didn't take anything home!!  I used 2 cups of oreos, as suggested by other reviewers, so I cut my sugar down from 3 to 1 tablespoons.  I also put extra crushed oreos on the top of the cheesecake around the outside edge and drizzled it with raspberry sauce.  Then I put a fresh raspberry on each slice, which ended up being nice because this dessert is so rich.  While it was good, it wasn't the best cheesecake ever for the effort we put into it.

I made this for our Christmas eve dinner.  My family owns a steak and seafood house- so we have pretty high expectations.  I followed other reviewers advice and used oreos and raspberry jam to save time.  This cheesecake got RAVE reviews- the best they ever had.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This was a huge hit at the Christmas potluck at work.  It was also easy if using raspberry preserves as suggested by other reviewers.  I'm only giving it 4 stars b/c I would have preferred it with graham cracker crust instead of the oreo.  But, if you like raspberry and chocolate together, this recipe is for you!

Made this for a party last night - big hit!  Followed the recipe exactly other than doubling the crust and leaving in the oven for an hour (with oven off) after baking for 1 hour.  PERFECT!

This recipe is fool proof.  I made this as my very first ever cheesecake and took it to a family Thanksgiving dinner and EVERYONE raved about it and my hostess asked if they could have the leftovers.  I was prepared for giving the leftovers to them already by putting the cheescake on a very festive inexpensive Holiday plate which she also loved.  I made the cake two days in advance, wonderful flavor!  Thank you!

SOOOO delicous!!  Took it to Bunco last night and everyone loved it!  One of the ladies asked if she could pay me to make her another one.  I used a flour sifter to strain the seeds out of the rasberry sauce and that worked wonderfully!!!  There was not one seed in my pretty rasberry sauce. I used 2 cups of oreos with only 1 tbps sugar and 1/4 cup butter for the crust.  I used 3 cups of White choclate chips, and 3 tbps white sugar in the Rasperry sauce.  I also followed the directions from one reviewer and put foil underneath the pan and put it on a cookie sheet with water to cook then let it sit in the oven for an hour after it was done cooking.  It had a wonderful texture.

Very good!  The white chocolate and cream in the filling makes this cheesecake less dense than regular cheesecakes.  I used chocolate graham crackers (a. it's what I already had, b. I couldn't find regular chocolate cookies and c. I didn't feel like messing with taking the filling out of oreos).  I didn't add sugar to the crust.  I used Polaner All Fruit seedless raspberry, and didn't add sugar to that either.  Mr. D said it was the best dessert that's ever come out of my kitchen, and rivaled the Cheesecake Factory!  Woohoo!

This recipe was excelletn!! If you've never made a cheescake before it is time consuming. I added more crushed oreos for the crust(nice and thick), I baked the cheescake in a water-bath and definitely add more white chocolate chips and raspberry. I don't think you can over do it.

I made this twice and each time my berries sank to the crust. I made a few changes; for the crust I used graham cracker and used strawberry jam instead of the rasberry mixture. I left the batter insself alone though. Maybe I'm mixing the batter too much. Oh well, both times the cheesecake was a big hit and despite it not being as pretty as the pictures, everyone loved it. Big tip I took was to leave in the oven for an hour to cool. Be sure not to open the oven at all even to peek or you risk the top falling inward.

I have made this recipe twice, once for Thanksgiving and once for a Christmas pot-luck at work.  Everyone loved it and it was simple to make...just follow the steps.  It is a beautiful presentation and the flavor is just as wonderful.  I would only suggest letting the cake cool completely before refridgerating.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

I'm not a fan of cheesecake, but this recipe is incredible.  It's very easy to make and tastes delicious.  I didn't have half/half on hand, so I used whipping cream instead.  I also doubled the crust as others have recommended.  It definitely is a 5 star recipe.  Thanks for sharing.  I'll be making this recipe 3 times over the holidays, and I can't wait to share it with others.

This was absolutely amazing. I made it alongside 8 pies at Thanksgiving and it was gone in minutes. I tried it later with doubling the water and adding sugar as one of the reviewers suggested and it came out even better! The original way was almost impossible to remove all the rasberry seeds. no matter how you make it,  this is a sure hit!

Excellent cheesecake.  Some of my family said it was the best cheesecake they ever had.  I used cranberries instead of rasberries and had a graham cracker crust, and it turned out wonderful.  I also tried the water bath method, as well as letting it cool in the oven, and had non of the issues I've had with previous cheesecakes.  I have one more cheesecake to test, but I'm pretty sure this is the one I'll be serving for  Christmas.

I love this recipe. It never fails to impress for me. I draw lines with the raspberry sauce on top and drag a toothpick through them to make little hearts all over  it. Since some people like raspberry more than others i save the extra & I take a bakers block of white chocolate and shred some to serve on the side as little extras. Whipped topping also goes well :)

I made this before with several changes suggested by other reviewers. It was good.  Made it again with only 1 change. I uses seedless r-berry jam and it was just as good.  I used chocolate graham crackers. It was sooo creamy.  This is a keeper!

Fantastic. I forgot to add the water for the raspberry sauce. I kept wondering why it was so hard to strain the seeds! Even so, it was delicious and my guests loved it. I will definitely make it again.

This was so much fun to make and the end result was awesome. My family complimented me that is tasted store-bought.

I did take the advice and use Ghiradelli chips.

I would definately make this recipe again. I also doubled the crust and used oreos without the filling and felt that the oreos somewhat over powered the cheesecake (I would rather have the crust compliment the cheesecake).  Next time I will try just chocolate cookies or the graham crust (doubling the crust is a must). The tip on the warm water bath and letting it cool in the oven were great as there were no cracks. The tip on straining the berries w/ water before simmering was extremely helpful.

I suspect my difficulties with this recipe were due to my inexperience and because i incorporated suggestions from other reviewers. The cheesecake looked pretty but my two problems were 1) My oreo crumb crust wasn't attached to my cheesecake and it couldn't even be scraped off the pan and 2) My white chocolate half and half mixture didn't mix in well and when i poured the cheesecake into the pan i found most of it blobed in the bottom of my mixer's bowl.
All and all i still think i'm going to try this recipe again. I want to see if I can get it right.

Delicious!  Turned out great.  You don't get much raspberry sauce out of the recipe, but I was able to boil the raspberries twice more after the first round to get every last drop of flavor out of them.

Very good recipe....used the baking suggestions from the cheesecake article on the website.  Only problems....still had water inside the foil from the water bath (just from condensation I think) and this made the crust rock hard.  I would also think this would taste better with a graham cracker crust instead of chocolate cookie crust.

I was having a dinner party and made this, everybody thought I'd picked it up from a bakery. They knew it was homemade but couldn't believe that I'd made it.
I'm a cheesecake lover and this has to be one of the best cheesecakes I've ever tasted.

I made this for my babysitter for her birthday.  She loved it! I didn't even get to try it, but heard over and over, how great it was. I was asked to make it for the next neighborhood function, so that everyone could try it.  I did follow some of the other suggestions.  I skipped the sugar in the crust, and did about 1 1/2 cup to 2 cups cookie crumbs.  I also bought the seedlees raspberry jam and really cut down on the time. I also did the water bath in the oven, and had no cracks. I turned the oven off after an hour, and let it sit in the oven for one more hour.

The raspberry sauce was wonderful.  For the crust, I used my food processor to chop Oreos.  I used an 8" pan so the cake would turn out a little thicker.  It got rave reviews!

I used strawberries instead of raspberries and it turned out so well.  I also topped it with a chocolate+shortening sauce which gave it an added crunch as well as chocolate.  Since I often bake for friends weddings, I tried this one out at a small wedding and had rave reviews!

my first time making it, and it was a hit!!!! The only things I changed were the crust and raspberry "sauce". Raspberry sauce ( 6 tablespoons of raspberry perserves/jam microwaved for 3 15 sec. intervals stirring in between). The crust (I made with 25 oreo sandwiches 1 tablespoon of sugar and 1/4 cup of butter, food processed)however did not hold together when sliced, if any of you have tips plese let me know! Otherwise I will definately make again.

I was SO excited to try this cheesecake recipe. I love the Olive Garden's version (and order it every time I dine there - if I can make room for it after dinner!). My review is a long time coming b/c I am SOOOO disappointed with the outcome. I am not a baker at heart (although I cook well...), and, as such, was worried that I'd ruin this... and I did : ( Good thing I made this the evening before my women's group Christmas holiday dinner! Had to make another dessert (i.e. disaster recovery mode) and hated that I had to do so (I was REALLY craving this!). I followed Cindy's directions almost to a T. My only change was substituting raspberry preserves (skipping the straining step) for the frozen vareity. My cheesecake was very brown and unappealing to look at (definitely not something that I'd want to serve to impress others). Per another reviewer's suggestion, I left my cheesecake in the oven for about an hour after baking (and I think that's what caused it to brown). I decided to not try the water bath method, but next time I will. I want to make this again (I REALLY do!), but I hope for better results when I do. This would be so impressive : ) I can taste it right now.... Giving this 4 stars (b/c I know the results had to do with the baker...). Thanks for sharing!

This is simply the best cheesecake I've ever tasted. I used raspberry preserves and  used a water bath. It turned out perfect. My first attempt at cheesecake and my family couldn't stop raving about it. Some say it's a tad too sweet but I love it just the way it is.

This was so good. I pureed the raspberries and water in the blender and strained before cooking. I did have to add more water than the recipe stated. I also used almost double oreos, but kept other crust ingredients the same. Cooked using the water bath method, but some water leaked into the pan even though I thought I wrapped it good enough.

I will have to make again...it did not turn out the way I expected b/c I tried the water bath method for the first time and even though I used foil wrapped around the bottom and sides of my pan, some still leaked through and into my cheesecake.  The top was beautiful though.  So I need help trouble shooting and will try again.

I think this needs to be a bit thicker. May use 4 things of cream cheese next time. But tasted great.

This was a great recipe, everyone in the house loved it... they even called it very sinful. I had left over filling so I made mini cheesecakes later. It's a great tasting cheese cake and looks beautiful too.

Excellent recipe!  I sprinkled the pieces of cheescake with raspberries, white chocolate chips and topped it off with some whip cream.  Was a huge hit with family and friends!

This was delicious, everyone LOVED it! I made a couple of changes: for the crust, I used 2 cups crushed oreos instead of one and kept the same amount of butter. I elimated the sugar in the crust since the oreos are sweet enougth. I also doubled the raspberry sauce.  The only problem with the raspberry sauce is it takes forever to strain! Just be patient with it. To keep the cake moist, put a 9x13 inch pan filled with hot water on the bottom rack when preheating, and keep in while baking cake. This cheesecake is without a doubt worth making. I cannot wait to make it again!

Wonderful!  Taste's just like the one at Cheesecake Factory!  I used raspberry puree from a margarita mix thickened with corn starch instead of the other steps, and it was perfect!

This was a great cheesecake and really easy to make too.  I used a shortcut mentioned in other review and just used microwaved jam instead of fresh berries.  It turned out perfect.

Made this several times, always a big hit.  If you want to tone down the sweetness a bit, try using less sugar in the crust (maybe 1-2 tbsp).  The crust has a deeper chocolate flavor that way.  My favorite cheesecake recipe!

oh my gosh! I am a fan of any cheesecake, but this one is a super delicious cheesecake and fairly simple to make. Loved the creaminess of this delicate, but rich dessert.  The raspberry swirls looked spectacular and it was a crowd attention getter.  I increased the amount of raspberries for the sauce and also baked in a waterbath.  I got a few cracks, but hey.  Decorated each slice with a squirt of whipped cream, a raspberry on top and a chocolate swirl garnish. Looked amazing and tasted even better.  Will definitely be making this one again.  A must try!

Incredible - I have never reviewed a recipe, but this is amazing. I made this for a bake-off at my new job, and I won :o)

Thanks for a wonderful recipe. I made the raspberry sauce with the frozen berries, absolutley delicious! And I also did use the 2cups of oreos and cut down a little on the butter. AMAZING!!

I have been using this recipe for a few years now and it gets rave reviews from everyone that tries it.  It is a fabulous cheesecake.  I have also added a touch of amond extract to the batter before for a nice/different touch.

I'm giving this a 3 because I had a lot of trouble with it, after reading tons of reviews and the articles on this website to making a good cheesecake I felt confident going into this. 1st, the crust was a pain, I used oreos but next time I will buy a store bought crust, and 2nd the only strainer I own is 2.5 inches in diameter so it took forever to strain the raspberrys so next time I think I will use jam. I also baked in a water bath and the water evaporated and I did have one small crack that wasn't too big, after it was finished I let it sit in the oven for 2 hours with the oven off the refridgerated overnight, it tasted ok but I feel like something was off, will try to make again with some modifications

Love this cheesecake!  I am making it the second time as a request from my son for his birthday cake.  I too skipped the raspberry step and used jam. Black Current. It was an emergency and there was nothing else berryish and seedless. It was excellent and a bit tart. I used blackberries as a garnish. Very yum.  Lots of positive comments. I followed many of the tips on this site, water bath and cooling the cake in the oven.  Worked great.

This was fantastic - I was totally freaked out just looking at the pictures.  But I served it last night to friends at Easter and it literally disappeared.  I may have undercooked it a little bit but that isn't so bad - you just have even creamier filling.  DO make sure that if you're using a waterbath that you totally enclose your pan with foil and that it doesn't leak in the top - that happened to me and the crust was a little wet.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I used chocolate graham crackers for my crust.  I was running short on time and I know I didn't have the proper strainer for the raspberry sauce so I did use seedless raspberry jam instead as others suggested.  Also, I did bake in a water bath as I always find my cheesecakes turn out better this way.  Yummy...will make again and again!

This took a lot longer to cook than stated - at least for me, and for some reason the crust got kind of mushy in places, but the flavor was really nice - my hubby really enjoyed it.  Thanks!

I made this for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day. As I tasted it for the first time, I said, "I can't believe I made this!" Also, the idea about using seedless raspberry jam as a shortcut was brilliant. I will keep this one in my recipe favorites forever!

I made this for a dear friend and she said that it tasted just like the ones made at the Olive Garden.
I did not have any frozen raspberries so I just heated up some seedless raspberry jam and it was just fine.

Absolutely divine. I followed the advice of some other reviewers and did 2 cups of crushed oreos, 1 tbsp sugar and 1/4 butter for the crust. I also used the water bath and it came out perfect. After chilling overnight and removing from springform pan I melted 2 more cups of white chocolate chips with about 1/4 cup of half & half then poured over the top of the cheesecake. I then topped with a 1/2 pint of fresh raspberries and chilled for a few more hours. Before serving, I drizzled the remaining raspberry sauce over the top. It was awesome. The best cheesecake I have ever had. Next time (there will definitely be a next time)I will probably try the seedless raspberry preserves like some other reviewers. What a great recipe. Thank you!

I just thought it was ok, but seemed like it could have used a more pronounced raspberry flavor. Overall, not bad- I just didn't feel like it was the best I had ever tasted.

Good Recipe. I used white bakers chocolate instead of chocolate chips and seedless jam. Turned out good. VERY sweet though

absolutely DELICIOUS. i doubled the crust amount as well, cuz its not enough with 1c. i also added about 1tsp cinnamon to the crumbs.  i left the cake in the oven for at least an hour after turning off the oven but it still sunk and cracked a little bit. it probably would have been worse had i not though. everyone loved it though!

Awesome, awesome, awesome recipe!!!  Made this for V-day and it was the bomb...I have requests to make this again for birthdays.  I did take some advice about using the Oreos and used about 2 cups for the crust.  I had purchased the raspberries in syrup, so I didn't add any additional sugar, which turned out a bit tart but it was  perfect with the sweet cheesecake.  This recipes is going in with the favorites!!

Made this for a church dinner and everyone loved it, I thought, however, it was just all right.  I will make it again, but with some changes.  I'd doubled the amount of chocolate and still couldn't really taste it in the final product, so I may omit it altogether since it just seemed to make it too sweet.  Instead I'll use more of the raspberry sauce.  The tartness of the sauce was a nice balance for the sweetness, but I would've liked more raspberry flavour in the cake.  I baked mine in a water bath since I always do my cheesecakes in water bath.  Never had a problem with cracking.  Anyway, I'm sure a little tweaking for my personal taste will bump it up to 5 stars.

This was excellent!  I didn't bother to strain the seeds and it was still fine.  I also agree with others that you could use raspberry preserves.  I added a little extra sugar to the sauce (personal preference).  I spread the remaining sauce over the top of the cooled cheesecake and grated white chocolate over the top. I'll defintely make this again;
i changed my rating from 5 to 4 only because after making this several times and watching a youtube chef talk about making cheesecake... i figured out that the only problem in, the recipe is the crust.  When using oreo cookies there is no need to add the butter and sugar (it already has enough fats in the cookies); and if you do...it's very difficult to get it out of the pan because it carmelizes when baked...like you need to chizel it out of the pan). So leave the butter and sugar out of the crust and sure to bake the crust at 300 for 10-12 minutes prior to adding the cheesecake filling and it then becomes a 5/5

I thought this cake was good but not great.  My family, however, thinks it's amazing and they're all mad that I didn't give this recipe 5 stars.  I think it needs more raspberry sauce, which I will definitely make more of next time, as well as a thicker crust.  I did the hot water bath which made it look perfect...no cracks in the top at all!  I'll definitely make this again with some adjustments.

I've definitely have made better cheesecakes. I used double oreo crust and i think i could have just 11/2ed it. Also the white chocolate is very subtle especially with the rasberry topping so you should add more if you want more of the white chocolate taste. I was very happy about the rasberry sauce though. It went really well with the cheesecake and I think I'll use the recipe for the sauve for other cheesecake recipes. Personally, my favorite cheesecake is still the Supreme cheesecake recipe on allrecipes. I think I'll experiment with that and add white chocolate and see how that turns out.

Great recipe! Friends told us it was better than the restaurant's version. Also, my husband cooked the cheesecake in a "waterbath"....kept the cheesecake moist, but it took longer.

I followed the recipe exactly and used the cheesecake tips on this website, leaving it in the oven for an hour after baking with the oven off, and baking it in a water bath.  It was rich, creamy and flavorful, one of the best cheesecakes I've ever made!

Absolutely wonderful cheesecake!!  Very similar to Olive Garden!  I threw some oreo's into a food processor along with a tablespoon of sugar and a couple of tablespoon's of butter to make my crust... Oreo's are awesome.. lol.  I also forgot the half and half (trying to make too many things at once) but it still came out delicious!   Im getting crazy compliments.. Thank you very much for posting this recipe :)

Sorry, this was a big disappointment, I was expecting a delicious cheesecake with all those great reviews, but it was too rich for us, nobody ate it..... now i have a white chocolate raspberry cheesecake to feed my hens!!
Maybe reducing the amount of sugar or white chocolate....

This was amazing, used white chocolate cooking bars two of them instead of chips. Saved out one chunk for garnish, other than that was exact. Made it for Christmas dinner, three pies were just sitting there! Cheesecake was gone!!
This is to die for!!!

I'm not much of a baker.  Picked up an oreo pre-made crust and baked in over for 20 minutes then placed in fridge overnight.  Delicious!  Next time I will add another 1/2 cup or more of rasberries and 1/2 cup of white chocolate.  I love whilte chocolate and the flavor was very subtle in the cheesecake.  But this was very rich yet creamy.  Will definitely make again.

Very easy and yummy.  I ended up doing a graham cracker crust instead and think I'll do that again next time.  I'll also add more white chocolate as I think it could've use a touch more!

This is probably the BEST cheesecake I have ever eaten and definitely the best one I've ever made.  The raspberry process is a little time-consuming, but worth it.  It is not overly sweet.  I used chocolate graham crackers for the crust.  This will definitely be part of my permanent collection.  Thanks!

OOOOOO this is so yummy! I served this for Christmas Day as a dessert and it went over well. My sister and law called me the next day to tell me that she had a piece of the leftovers as she was having a bad day and it made her feel better! Little effort for such an upscale dessert. Agree with other reviewer to let dessert cool in oven after it is off or it will sink in the middle quite bad. Please try this recipe!

This recipe was so good! It was gone within 5 minutes of setting it on the table!!  We used the reserve raspberry juice as an extra topping at serving time.  I think that I might make it with a gingersnap crust next time, just to add a little more depth to the flavor of the crust.  It was great though ;o)

Nice cheesecake & very lovely looking. I followed everyone's suggestions regarding the jam & water bath. I wished that I had made another crust though. I used oreo crumbs (no filling) & found it too rich/sweet.

This recipe is fabulous and it looks beautiful; I would suggest that you read all of the reviews here before you attempt this recipe - I used a springform pan and a water bath, and I did not have any problem with cracking and/or sinking.

Helful tip - graham crackers crush up very nicely in a coffee grinder.

Amazing cheesecake! Was told it's the best! Used oreo cookies on the bottom, and the raspberries made a lot, may have enough for the next one. I let it sit in the oven for about 30 min after.

Better than The Cheesecake Factory! I followed the recipe to the T and it came out perfect. My first cheesecake I have ever made. I wasn't sure about the finished product but I brought it to work and everyone thought it was great. It even looked great.

This was very good.  I followed the directions with only a few alterations.  I used about 1.5 cups of oreio crumbs, next time I would reduce the butter in the crust, I dont think it was needed. I also added about 3 cups of melted white chocolate chips to the 1/2 cup of half and half.  It had a very nice flavor and everyone ate it up.  I tend to like my cheesecake with a bit of a tartness so the next time I make this, and I would make this again, I would maybe add more than the 3 tablespoons of raspberry sauce within the layer and on top (6 total).  I have a little left over and I think today i will try it and will drizzle a little of the leftover raspberry sauce and see how I like it.  It was a very pretty cheesecake too. the oreo crust was a nice touch and I think the chocolate crust is the way to go with these flavors.

Wonderful Recipe.   I followed instructions.   Didn't have the right type of strainer so some of my raspberry seeds were in the sauce but didn't seem to bother it.   I am fairly new at cheesecakes so it could be something I did wrong but my bottom stuck to the pan when I transferred it to a plate.   I did cook it with a jellyroll pan filled with water but I did cover the cake pan with foil but some moisture may have gotten into the crumb crust.   I couldn't find the chocolate crumbs so I just used regular graham cracker crumbs.   I did cook it a little longer than instructed and left it in the oven for one hour after baking it.  The taste of this cheesecake was wonderful.  The white chocolate sauce added to it takes the cream cheese bite out of it - it was just wonderful.  Thank you.

I love this recipe, this is my second cheesecake i've ever made.  It was great tasting, but it lacked a chocolatety (not sure if thats a word..lol) taste, thats why 4 stars.  Otherwise it was easy and didn't take too much time as others said.

I used this recipe for a groom's cake order and I still have people raving about it!  It's a wonderful recipe.  I just used seedless raspberry preserves which cut down on the prep time tremdously.  After it chilled overnight, I coated the whole cake with a layer of white chocolate.  Delicious and definitely a keeper!!

I am a very picky cheesecake baker and this recipe was the best yet.  EASY and foolproof.  Flavor was fabulous. I could not find chips so I substituted three large bars of good quality chocolate. I used waterbath as described by link at bottom of recipe and that worked great.  This will be my standby in the future.

This cheesecake could easily be sold in an expensive bakery. This was my first cheesecake ever and it came out great for Thanksgiving Day dessert. Everybody raved. I made one mistake, I forgot the half and half when I melted the white chocolate. Because I melted it slowly, it wasn't a problem and did not cause a problem with the texture of the cake. Straining the raspberries didn't work well; many of the seeds remained and the process took a long time. We don't mind seeds though, so it wasn't a huge problem. I cooked it for 55 minutes and the top of the cake turned golden brown. I wasn't used to that color for cheesecake, so may not cook it as long next time, but the taste was absolutely splendid.  Do note, the cake was a bit jiggly when I finished, but after setting up in the oven (3 hours) and in the refrigerator--the texture was perfectly awesome. The red marbling with the brown top looked very appealing. The marbling was perfect.  Swirling the raspberry mixture with the tip of a butter knife--back and forth while pulling--worked perfectly. I had extra raspberry sauce, but I'd rather have too much than not enough.  No problem. I used oreo outsides; great idea.  I used video and written tips available on this website for avoiding cracks.  I only had one minor crack, nearly invisible because of the color of the cake.  I did forget to run a knife around the edge when the cake was done baking, but there was very little sticking because I sprayed the sides with a flour spray.

I made this for my husband for his birthday and everyone at the party loved it.  I did the "cheesecake bath" and also left it in the oven for about 45 minutes after the time was up, with the oven off.  It baked evenly and didn't sink in the middle.  I was sad to eat the final piece last night and savored every bite!  Oh--I suggest using chocolate animal crackers for the cookie crust.  They work well.

My first time making a cheesecake ever and it turned out awesome! 5 people have tried it and were all totally blown away by it's briliance. I second the raspberry jam substitution and cooking in a water bath, works really well. I'll definitely be making this again.

I actually made this without the white chocolate but it still came out great. I think it called for too many raspberries though. I hardly used even half of the syrup that I had made. I actually combined this with another cheesecake recipe that called for a little more cream cheese. Came out well.

I loved loved loved this recipe.  It was easy to make being my first cheesecake.  I didn't have a spring pan but used a regular 9in pan and made two smaller cheescakes ( I had leftover batter).  Caution though don't use whole bag of frozen raspberries.  I had to throw away alot of unused raspberry filling. You can also make your crust out of almonds.  keep refrigerated over night 8 hours before serving.

This was phenomenal. I made a few changes that were unnecessary but worked great. I made a chocolate graham crust, melting two tablespoons of semi-sweet chocolate with the 1/4 cup of butter. It complemented it well.

Make sure the white chocolate is good quality. I took out 1/4 of it because this particular white chocolate repulsed me. But my mom loves it and drizzles it over her slices.

I also used frozen wild berry instead of raspberry. 'Twas good.

This was my first cheesecake and it turned out extremely well. Baking it in a water bath and such, made for a really smooth and luxurious texture.

This cake was phenomenal!! The only problems I encountered were that the crust absorbed some moisture from the liquid, and became soggy. The "swirl" drained to the very bottom and when I tried to add the milk to the chocolate, it didn't mix. But I still got a really smooth cake. I recommend baking for 55 min. and the turning the oven off and(with the cake in it) for an hour.

Really good taste, but I have to give this one 4 stars because it's much harder than it looks! Couldn't get the raspberry to swirl so it all fell to the center and it didn't bake well.  I will probably attempt this again.

Absolute bliss.  Followed the directions to a T, except that I cooked it in a water bath.  Beautiful presentation, even better taste.  Next time, I will garnish the edge with mint.

I made this a few years ago as a friend's wedding cake.  The swirls of raspberry made it look gorgeous. The purpley color with the cream matched her wedding colors perfectly.  Looked awesome with a bit of lavender and cream ribbon tied around the edges.

Baked this over a waterbath and let it cool in the oven.  It fell a little, cracked a little, but no one cared.  Served it with extra sauce, fresh raspberries and whipped cream.  I've created a monster--now my family wants this at every family get together.

My husband loved it!! I am not a cheesecake eater but this definitely made the man of the house quite happy and it was very easy to make with the exception of getting rid of the raspberry seeds.  A little complicated but wonderful.

this was soooooo good!  it wasn't beautiful (it cracked even though i left it in the oven - but i didn't care) but it tasted sooo good!  i doubled the white chocolate and used strawberry preserves that i just 'swirled' in.

phenominal cheesecake!  made this for Easter and can't wait to make it again, nothing but rave reviews were given.  I used prior suggestions of the water bath and jarred preserves and they were a big help in the baking process.  You won't be sorry you tried this recipe!

Excellent! I made two smaller cheesecakes - one with an oreo crust and another with a graham cracker crust. I think I prefered the graham cracker crust, although I overbaked the oreo one just a little... This was my first attempt at cheesecake, and it was easier than I expected. My only complaint was how long the raspberries took to drain. I will try the jam suggestion next time.

WOW!!! A little slice goes a long way! Lining the bottom of the pan with baking (parchment) paper stops that crust from sticking.

Awesome! Cheesecake is a favorite in our house so I make it frequently. This one was especially good. I did bake it for the full 60 minutes and it required a complete chill in the refrigerator for it to set. It looked beautiful and would be great to serve for guests.

This cheesecake was awesome! It was also my first time making a cheesecake, so I wasn't really sure what was meant by "bake until filling is set", so I think I ended up baking it just a tiny bit too long, because the edges became light brown and the crust was pretty hard along the edges.  But it still tasted fabulous.  I brought it to work and got a lot of compliments on it.  Thanks!

Definitely deserves five stars.  I made the raspberry sauce first and made the mistake of tasting it!  It tasted so sour, but it was too late to do anything about it, so I started cooling it and prepared the rest of the cheesecake.  I followed the recipe exactly and everything went together well.  After it was done, it looked great and when I tasted it the next day, I noted that the raspberry combined with the filling went together perfectly!  It wasn't too sour at all - it was just right.  The white chocolate flavor filling in this recipe is very nice - it gives it a special flavor that I think would blend well with other fruit flavors.  Thank you very much.  Will make again for sure.

I am not really a big fan of cheesecake, but  I usually make it for parties and special occasions because everybody usually loves it!  Also you can substitute the cream cheese for the low fat version or mix some fat free with it.  People can't tell the difference.  I also used chocolate graham crackers

I didn't have any chocolate cookies so I substituted graham cracker crumbs, and it still tasted fine!

Excellent cheesecake. I used plain digestive crumbs and fresh raspberries instead of the frozen. I cooked it in a waterbath and left it in the oven for an hour after switching it off. I then let it chill overnight. It was perfect no cracks and the pattern on the top was all the decoration it needed. Thanks.

I wish I could give this one a higher rating, it was amazing.  Perfect!!!  Just like a restaurant.  I used fat-free half & half, and lowfat cream cheese to make this a bit healthier.  It was the best cheesecake ever.  Thank you so much, now I have a cheesecake recipe I can always count on.

Quite wonderful.  Call me lazy but I didn't have time to make my own raspberry sauce.  Used seedless red raspberry preserves instead, then garnished with fresh whole raspberries and white chocolate curls.  Took it as a birthday cake to work.  It was gone before lunch!

This was a delicious (but rich) cheesecake that I will definitely be making again!  To save time, I used seedless raspberry jam instead of the frozen raspberries and it came out great!  I also made extra raspberry sauce to put over the cake when it was served and everyone loved it. If you want to impress then this is the cheesecake for you.

I don't like cheesecake, but this one was so good that even I couldn't resist it! I couldn't find any plain chocolate cookies, so I just found litle chocolate wafers that come in a package, and those worked just as well if not better!

This cheesecake was divine.  I was so good.  I made it for a family get to together and it dissappeared fast.  I had many compiments on it.  I didn't bring any home.

Bravo!  I have made alot of cheesecakes, but this is undoubtedly the best cheesecake recipe I have come across!  I have made it 4 times since Christmas and the requests keep coming!  The white chocolate really lightens the strong cheese taste and adds a great mellow flavor!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!  It is one of my favorites from this site!

I made it (w/extra sugar in the raspberry sauce to reduce the tartness) and gave it to our friends as a Christmas present.  Here is the response I got:
"DELICIOUS! (‘nough said). It was very, very good. We actually brought some of it over to our friends’ house to share for our Christmas dinner and everyone couldn’t believe it was “homemade.” They all said how “perfect” it was – including me – as far as texture, especially, but presentation as well. :) They gobbled it up so I think that tells you about the taste. :) Seriously, it was one of the best cheesecakes I’ve ever had!!!!"  So...I can't wait to try it the next time I make it!  Thanks.

I thought this cheesecake deserved 4 stars, however, my boyfriends family rated it 5 stars. My BF's mom ate four pieces and even took the rest into work with her. She claimed that everyone that tasted it said it was delish. I have re-evaluated this cheese cake. Everyone seems to think it is outstanding!

This is an absolutely fabulous recipe; it deserves more than 5 stars!!  I made it exactly as written except I used all the raspberry sauce in the cake.  It looked gorgeous garnished with whipped cream and dark chocolate shavings.  Several people said it was the best cheesecake they ever tasted and I got multiple requests for the recipe.  Thanks Cindy, for making me look like an expert baker!

This is such a great recipe. I have made a few cheesecakes, and this one by far turned out the best. I used Nilla Wafers instead of chocolate cookies because I am not a fan of chocolate/fruit mixes. Without really realizing it, I put more of the raspberry sauce in the cheesecake then the recipe called for because I didn't see that you were supposed to serve the cheesecake with the leftover sauce. It was great- I'll do the same thing the next time I make the cheesecake. I served the cheesecake with a white chocolate sauce that I made- and it was great. Now, if I can only figure out how to take the cheesecake off of the bottom of the springform pan without messing up the cake for serving.

I have had the PLEASURE of making and serving this luscious desert a few times: every time it both looks and tastes professional.  TRUTH:  the first time I made it I did so because I'm an obsessive calorie counter and didn't want to make a desert I'd actually want to eat (I usually hate fruity deserts).  Let's just say my intentions were one-upped by the most incredible cheesecake in the history of man. Watch out - even better the second (and third) day. I do indeed double the sauce.  Time consuming but a lot of fun - make it with a friend!

This recipe is absolutely amazing!  Thank you, Cindy, for sharing it and making it THE favourite dessert at all our family functions.
I double the white chocolate and have, on occasion, added other berries for the coulis, which has worked great (I've never had a problem with getting rid of the seeds like some other reviewers...I think they need a better strainer!)

This cheesecake was really easy to make, I didn't bother making the raspberry syrup or topping just bought some at the store and it worked great.  The white chocolate worked really well with the raspberries.  Really rich so you will have to share this cake with others!!

This cheesecake is awesome! I was looking for one similar to the one the Olive Garden serves and this one is as close as it comes.  The raspberry sauce was a little tangy for us so I added a little more sugar and it was perfect.  I will definitely be making this one for years to come.

I made this for a Thanksgiving potluck. The result was decadent beyond words, but it was too labor-intensive for me to repeat, and the cake was a little messy.  Also straining the raspberries did not work and left me w/ a disappointingly small amount of raspberry sauce.  I resorted to a store-bought can for the topping.
