I gave it 4 stars if the following changes are made: i let the mixture cool enough to add 1/2 c mini semi sweet chocolate chips without them melting, yet still pliable enough to be able to form into balls, then rolled in additional *toasted* coconut.  When I tried to drop it by spoonfuls originally, it wanted to come apart.  I also crushed the cornflakes a little bit so I didnt have a bunch of huge flakes.  This also helped the balls adhere  better.

This recipe was overall a little too sweet. So i added 1 1/2 tbsp of sugar instead. Less cornsyrup should be added too so that the cookies could set in a shorter time.

I remember these from when I was little - super simple and easy to modify.  You can substitute chocolate, dried fruit and other nuts.  After spooning onto the wax paper, they are easy to shape into balls.  If it is humid, they may stay sticky, but will taste just as good.

Delicious!  Substituted Special K cereal for the cornflakes.  Everything else exactly as written.  Cooked as directed and everything came out great!  Going to try again with Total cereal.

Was pleasantly surprised by the overal result of this recipe! It took such a short time to complete and turned out quite tasty. 
Would be better if they were crispier though. But love the coconut flakes. Made quite a big difference to the taste.

These are really simple but tasty to make!  I didn't have any walnuts and after trying one decided to salt the rest for a sweet and salty treat.  Kids love them!

Very good if you eat it with a spoon.  Just didn't set very good.  Too sticky and I know I followed the recipe to a tee!  Oh well, I tried.

Tasty, but so hard I thought they would break my teeth! Maybe cooking on lower heat and for less time would make them softer?

I love no bakes and I love cereal, but these were just disappointing.  They're way too sweet and soggy, not chewy.  All it is, is corn syrup glazed corn flakes with some nuts and coconut thrown in.  I'll stick with other no bake and granola recipes that taste like something more than ultra sugary coated cereal...and that's coming from somebody with a major sweets and sugar addiction!

These are wonderful - unfortunatley, my kids don't like coconut or most nuts (it's sad isn't it?) and I didn't have Corn Flakes but that didn't stop me. I had Vector cereal and toasted some sesame seeds and wheat germ. They tasted just like the sesame snaps in the stores!  If I make them for myself I'll do the same again and add chopped peanuts. It was a hit, thanks!

These were good. Mine didn't set up well.  They were very sticky and didn't want to stay together very well.  Maybe I didn't cook the sugar long enough.
