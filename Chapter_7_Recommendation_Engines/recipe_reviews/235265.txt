Made this soup x2...it was wonderful.  I added another 1/2 cup of Turkey and 1/2-3/4 cup liquid to broth.  Lemon flavor is evident but not too strong.

I was actually surprised how much I liked this soup. I was really expecting it to be kind of bland but loved all the healthy ingredients in it so thought I'd give it a try.  I had leftover turkey stock and turkey meat from thanksgiving.  The only change I made was to up the turkey stock to 4 cups.  Two cups would definitely not have been enough. I'll probably use 5 cups next time.  It was so yummy!!  It's something about the lemon/lemon zest. It just gives it such a pleasant taste!

This is a delicious soup, it turned out great!  I have been using canned chicken broth and cooked chicken rather than the turkey since that is more convenient for me.  I typically double the recipe, and to that I add 2 cups of cooked brown rice and a little bit of extra broth.  I love the light, fresh taste from the lemon juice and lemon zest.

Nice change of pace. The lemon is fresh tasting, but not overwhelming.

Needed more than 2 cups of liquid, I ended up adding 2 more cups. It was a little  lemonie for my taste,  if I make it again, I will add a little less Lemon juice.

This was delightful! A very light yet flavorful alternative to traditional turkey noodle soup. I plan to make this in years to come after Thanksgiving! A nice little "detox" from the heavy Thanksgiving fare.

This is awesome! I added 1 fresh chopped, seeded jalapeno as well.....that was the only change I made and I will definitely make it again....I used the leftover Thanksgiving turkey, but I think this would also be great made with chicken and chicken stock.

Made this twice as written and enjoyed it. The next time I added a boxed long grain and wild rice(minus spice packet)pre-cooked and added at the end.  Made the soup more substantial for a dinner .   Truly love this soup.

I made it with chicken broth instead of turkey broth because it was what I had in the pantry. Didn't add any lemon zest or salt. Turned out thick and surprisingly creamy. Very light. Perfect for leftover turkey and veggies from the holidays.

Excellent! The only changes I made were that I used chicken broth and frozen spinach since that's what I had on hand. I devoured it! Very fresh-tasting and healthy. Needed very little salt added. I may just buy another turkey so I can make this again!

My family loves this soup.  We use the turkey frame to make the stock.  The lemon gives it a very nice lightness that I don't often find with other recipes designed to use up leftover turkey.  I put lemon wedges on the side for those who want extra.

This soup is sooo good and so easy! I did add about 1.5 more cups of stock than called for in the recipe. So perfect.

Delicious. The prep time is actually an hour if you include cleaning up as you go.  Once my ingredients were ready it took 45 min to cook it. I recommend having additional broth on hand.  Some of it evaporates during cooking and you’ll want to add more.  No worries about diluting.  I only used about 1/3 of the spinach called for.  It’s really about what you like.  So I made this twice.  The measurements here are good to serve 2 people a nice large bowl.  Increase if you’re feeding more.

I didn't have enough spinach: I used a mixture of spinach, cilantro and parsley.  Excellent soup.  I also added 2 cups of vegetarian home made broth to serve 4 large bowls of soup.

Oh dear, this is the first time I have made something from Allrecipes that I just did not like.  It is very rare that I throw anything away but I ended up doing just that.  Judging from the comments I must be about the only person this happened to.  So sorry....

Soooo tasty!  This soup was so good that I made a second batch with the rest of my leftover turkey.  Will make it with chicken too.  I added some diced yam which made it a little heartier.

A great way to use up leftover turkey when everyone's sick of heavy, rich food. I added a little more turkey and carrot than called for because I love both, a little less onion and spinach. I also left out the garlic because I forgot to get fresh. The result was still delicious, and I'm about to have the last of it for lunch. The lemon is perfect with it, giving it a lightness and a zing not usually associated with turkey! I used homemade turkey stock.
