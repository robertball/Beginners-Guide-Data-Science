These brownies rock!!  I've had this recipe for a long time, and the original recipe actually calls for 1 1/2 c. MELTED butter or margarine.  I prefer to use butter, so this may help to alleviate the sticking on the bottom of the pan.  Also, I usually push the peppermint patties into the first layer of mixture, then top with the rest, so they won't poke through in cooking.  Other than that, this is a good time, and I hope this helped!!  :)

Everyone has raved about these brownies each time I've made them.  A few suggestions that have worked for me:  four eggs work fine.  Make them in two square pans instead of a 9x13.  Don't bake them the whole time - they'll burn.  And, most important, use YORK patties -- the cheapo ones I bought at Costco melted into a gooey mess and tasted strange.

I have made these for years -- always my husband's request for Father's Day and birthdays.  I always make them in a metal 9x12 cake pan and I only put enough batter on the bottom to cover the pan (thick, but less than half the batter on the bottom) -- it always seems to require more than half the batter to cover the peppermint patty layer.  When in doubt, undercook!  You can almost never get an accurate toothpick reading because of the peppermint brownies, so I generally take them out when the edges start to crisp and the middle is set when I give the pan a giggle.  I also think it helps not to overbeat the batter.  Too much time in the mixer or the oven will make them dry and cakey, at which point they're really not worth eating.  But a good, gooey center underneath that crisp, flaky top layer?  Absolute heaven.

I love these.  Of course they are better from scratch, but I ALWAYS have brownie mixes and a bag of yorks (I buy the regular size for cheap after Christmas) on hand.  Prepare 2 boxes of mix as directed, then follow this recipe from step 3... great for those last-minute occasions when you need something yummy quick.

These had a rich dark appearance, great gooey texture, and a refreshing mint flavor.  Make sure you watch them the last 15 minutes or so of baking - I took mine out about 10 minutes before the recipe said to because they were getting a little crispy around the edges.  Very good!

I'm glad I gave this recipe another try. I made it when it first appeared in magazine ads, with less-than-desirable results. The edges were burned, and the patties oozed and stuck to the sides of the pan. Having said that, this time I lined the long side of the pan with parchment paper, sprayed the paper with cooking spray, and greased the short sides of the pan. Melted butter worked better for me (for the batter), and I used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder, as this was all I had. It takes a little care to spread the bottom layer of batter on the paper in the pan but is doable, and I made sure that the patties were positioned 1/2-inch in from all the sides. I placed a sheet pan on the rack below the brownie pan in the oven; this helps with heat distribution and has prevented burning. The brownies took the full 55 minutes in my oven, and they were perfect---no burned edges, and the middle was cooked but not dry. The Special Dark cocoa makes these extra-rich. Now that I know that, with a few extra steps, these are a success for me, I'll definitely make them more often---especially for gifts or pot lucks.

I didn't follow the brownie part of this recipe (I'm lazy...I used a box), but am rating the concept, anyway to show how diverse the recipe is; you could use it w/any brownie recipe.  What a simple way for a creme de menth type brownie.  Be sure to fully cover your patties w/brownie batter and make sure the patties aren't touching the sides of the pan.  THANKS for a great recipe, Pam (next time, I'll use your brownie recipe, too)!

Brownie was very good and mildly minty.  I tend to like brownies 'fudgy' as opposed to 'cakey'.  These were a bit 'cakey' for me so next time a will try 4 eggs to see if that helps.  I did spray the pan with nonstick spray to avoid the trouble getting them out of the pan that other reviewers were having.

I have made this recipe for years now.  Everyone loves it. I have taken to baking it in 2 half pans, one with peppermint patties, the other with peanut butter cups.  Everyone seems to have their favorite and it works well.  Reduce the baking time by 10 minutes at least for peanut butter cups.

I don't know what went wrong with these. 55 mins was way too long in my oven. I had to take it out after 25 mins. The brownie wasn't moist, kind of dry and the peppermint patties didn't melt. It was just a peppermint patty stuck inside a dry brownie.

What a great brownie! I baked them for just about 50 minutes and they stayed super moist. They were a great hit at the office, I will make these again!

This was pretty good.  I made mine the day before a party...by the time the party came around they were hard as a rock so I'm not sure what happened there.  However...the flavor was EXCELLENT!

I ended up making Reese's Pieces Peanut Butter Cup Brownies. I placed nine snack size Reese`s Pieces half an inch in from the all four sides of the pan as suggested. These were snack size, not the mini size chocolates. I will add a few mini`s next time here and there I think. I just like more of a good thing, but they were delicious as made! OH MY GOODNESS they were a hit. I followed a tip, and used butter, as I have very soft healthy spreadable margarine. This type of margarine gets very watery when melted. **Hard squares of margarine like Imperial, are much better for baking purposes. I used all 5 eggs, and used the measurements given for each ingredient. I also carefully spread less then half the batter in the bottom of the pan to make sure there was enough batter left over to cover the larger Peanut Butter Cups. I found that saving more batter for the top worked well. I checked them at 50 minutes and they were a little under done. It was hard to judge with the chocolate`s melted inside, I tested in several spots. I followed the directions, and baked them for the full 55 minutes. I had perfect results. I set my oven to the stated temperature, mine is a convection oven, this automatically changes the temperature to convection.  OUR FAVOURITE results, they were fudgy, chewy, inside with a thin, crispy top. Perfect!**We made mint brownies too with 35 mini mints, topped with fudge icing from the back of the Hershey Chocolate Chip bag. **Make these !! So delicious! OUR new fav!

These brownies were good but not as good as I thought they would be. They were very dense and I prefer my brownies fudgy not cakey but tasted pretty good.

Yum! They were a little difficult to get out of the pan.  It helped when the pan was warmed. However the brownies were extra good when cooled!

I was a little hesitant about these because I've never done homemade brownies and it seemed like there was a lot of butter and eggs. But they were good! I actually think I might try these with different candies- maybe andes mints would be good. Anyway, thanks for sharing!

After reading the list of sinful ingredients, I knew I had to make them...and I wasn't disappointed!  These brownies are rich, moist and yummy.  It's best to use real butter, which adds to the richness.  I've probably made these brownies 30 times over the years and they're always a hit!

This recipe is the best "specialty" brownie I've ever tasted.  I was originally put off by the number of eggs (5), but then a friend made it anyway, and I was hooked!! - Chewy, fudgy, minty smooth...wonderful!

Made these to send to a navy friend.  Of course we kept some home!  They are amazing.  The edges were a bit chewy, but think the mints may have been too close to the side, otherwise--SUPERB!!  Wouldn't change a thing!!

These are great! Make sure you add the cocoa slowly as it tends to billow and absorbs slowly. I also agree that you need a bit more than 2 cups ofthe batter to comletelycover the patties. I couldn't find "small" patties so I just used 16 of the normal sized ones and turned out fine. I also reduced the baking time to 40 minutes.

These were really good.  I was freaked out making the batter as it was soooo thick! I thought I did something wrong as I felt it was more like cookie dough.  But it turned out great! I have made these before using boxed mixes but this was a good one that I can use what I have in my pantry.  THANKS!

Excellent - followed the receipe exactly and the result was delicious!  Made one batch with York peppermint patties, and one with Reese peanut butter cups(my husband doesn't like chocolate mint!) - both were yummy!

I've been making this recipe since I found it on the back of the York Peppermint Patties bag.  It's sooo good!  No changes needed.

These brownies go SO QUICKLY whenever I make them!  Whenever our company has a pitch-in, they tell me I'm not allowed in the building without a pan of these brownies.  Thanks for the recipe!

I will second the suggestion to use York brand. I tried the other types and all I ended up with was minty sauce under a pan of brownies. Messy and sticky, but tasty.

These were really good!!! Chocolate and peppermint...so good! I definatley recommend the cooking method here  (layer of brownie mix on the bottom, then layer of Patties, then top layer of brownie mix) because one time, I tried just chopping up the patties and mixing them all in the batter, but that was a disaster because the patty peices that were on the bottom stuck to the pyrex baking dish. It was IMPOSSIBLE to slice the brownies and get them out in one peice. I ended up with a huge glop of cooked brownines. Definatley much better to have the barrier of brownie batter between the baking dish, and the peppermint patties. 
Also, I will try adding some Peppermint Extract next time, for more peppermint taste!

Setting aside 2 cups of batter to cover the peppermint patties resulted in the top layer of brownie being overcooked and dried out. If I were to try this again, I would just chop up the patties and mix them all in.

I made these last night, and when I came here to write about it I found out I wrote a review several years ago. And not a favorable one.  The recipe here is the same on the Hershey's site.  I've made these before and they never looked as pretty as the photos and came out as a gooey mess.  I decided to attempt again but this time I only used 18 patties and froze the patties before I put them in the pan.  This helped them keep their shape as they baked.  I also used butter instead of margarine.  Found the baking time of 55 minutes just right.  Used a metal 13x8 pan.  As far as brownies go, this is not a recipe I would make outside of Christmas season.  I like the patties added to make this more of a Christmas treat.  Glad I tried again.

I've made these a few times, and for some reason the finished product is never as good as I'm hoping it will be. Like some other reviewers, I've had problems with the brownies sticking to the bottom of the pan, no matter what I do to prevent it. The patties sometimes explode through the top of the brownies, leaving them uneven and hard (the exposed mint candy hardens like a rock!). The flavor is wonderful, but all in all these are just too much work for the reward. I may try them again with store-bought brownie mix to see if that makes a difference.

These brownies are absolutely amazing.  I can't wait to make them with different candy bars, and even without any candy bars in the middle.  The brownie itself is perfection, and it is almost impossible to find a recipe for a perfect cake like brownie.  Fabulous!

Very wonderful, esp. if you are craving mint chocolate! Mine turned out just like the picture- they had white in the center. If you want them to look like the picture above you MUST let them cool- my husband was so excited for them he cut the first few while the batch was hot and it was a mess- but still yummy, lol. I covered them and left them overnight and by morning they were picture perfect when cut. Thank you!!!   **I used York Pep. Patties and Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder.

Quite good.  I used Junior Mints for half and Andes Mints for the other half.  It didn't spread as evenly as desired, but the taste was scrumptious. I would recommend using Junior Mints.  Gives a nice, gooey filling.

These brownies are delicious when they first come out of the oven, but I only gave them a 4 star because they dry out quickly.  Also, my family didn't like the candy in the middle.  Next time I think I'll make them without it.

A huge hit with friends!  I used Ande mint chips instead of peppermint patties, and the chocolate chips were tough to chew.  Next time I will stick to Peppermint Patties.
I also added a dash of peppermint schanpps to the batter, which gave it more of a refreshing taste to the brownies themselves.

I used a glutten free boxed brownie to make for a friend.  I just put half the batter in a greased glass 8X8 baking dish.  Added chopped pepermint patties then the rest of the batter.  They were good, nothing stuck and the minty flavor masked the normal after-taste of the gluten-free mix.

These were a huge hit at a recent baby shower, even the husbands who dropped by later couldn't resist.  Great chocolatey taste that is not overpowered by the mint.  The fact that the chocolate around the mint melts into the brownie, but the mint layer remains whole makes for a lovely appearance.  Slice in squares then into triangles to show the peppermint.  Made these two days before the shower and they stayed lovely and fresh.

Yum! These brownies were soooo good. I did not have peppermint patties, so, I added crushed Andies Mint baking chips and it still turned out ok. The brownies are very thick - cake like. I will make them again!

These brownies are just awesome.  I initially had some difficulty distributing the batter evenly throughout the bottom of the pan and on the sides, but I was actually able to wipe off the oil before baking.  Like other users, I found it helpful to push the peppermint patties down into the first layer of better.  I am a novice at baking and cooking alike, so I was quite pleased when I pulled out a perfect creation- Minty, somewhat creamy, and very decadent.  I did not experience the problems of the bronies sticking to the pan or the patties exploding out of the top or bottom of the brownies.

YUM!  Someone brought these brownies into work the other day and just had to have the recipe.  A quick search brought me here, and it came out great when I made it.  A few reviewers mentioned that they were really hard to get out of the pan, so I sprayed my pan with Pam and also floured the pan.  Also, I only had 1 cup of butter on hand, so I decided to halve the recipe and it still came out awesome.  I cooked it for about 35-40 mins.  This recipe is a keeper!

THEY DID NOT TURN OUT AT ALL AND I NEVER HAVE PROBLEMS WITH A RECIPE.  I FOLLOWED THE RECIPE EXACTLY, BUT THE BROWNIES STUCK IN THE PAN AND YOU COULD NOT GET THEM OUT.  I THINK THE PATTIES MELTED THROUGH THE BATTER.  I DID USE A GOOD QUALITY NON STICK PAN. ALSO THE TOP FELL APART WHEN CUTTING THEM.

The taste was nice. Parchment paper made then a snap to remove and cut.

I put more batter on the top than bottom as suggested but some of the patties seemed to melt right to the bottom and solidify. 

Also, reviewers cautioned not to overbake and I trusted that.  My brownie "fell" shortly after coming out of the oven.

Awesome.  Received great reviews from co-workers, "to die for" & "sooooo good" to name a few.... I could not find York peppermint patties but instead used "cool mints" which I found at bulk barn.  Also used cake flour, everything else was done right to the letter, including cooking time, and they turned out great.  Used a non stick pan and put cooking spray on it as well, and just popped the entire tray of brownies out after onto a rack, and then cut them up.

Very good brownie.  I did leave mine in too long I think.  It was still very moist and although fudgy I would say that it is more on the cakey side (or at least mine was).  My mints melted and sank to the bottom :( I think due to the overbaking.  I will try these again and try not to leave them in too long this time.  It just seemed like they were not done when I kept checking them.  TY for the yummy recipe.

The peppermints make this very rich. It was too rich for me, but I am not a big mint fan. I loved the texture and taste of the brownie, and I will definitely make the brownie in the future!

I thought these were great.  I guess I expected the peppermint patties to melt a little bit more but they seemed to remain as is in the pan.  But all in all were good.  No exploding patties for me as I did push them  further down in the batter.  I made them for my little bro for his b-day...they are in the mail. I'll see what he says.  Great but not exceptional.

I made these and ended up with a  HUGE amount and took most of them to our church coffee hour. They were all gone within 10 mins. I didn't use York as we can't get them in the UK, so I used Bendicks bittermints but they were still amazing.

I thought it was rich but not the right mix of flavors.  I usually really like mint chocolate things. I halved the batch. Mine were easy to remove though.   I guess I just prefer a caramel layer to a mint layer in my brownies.

Not bad with some tweaks. I tried the recipe twice--the first time with 5 eggs and the 2nd time with 4; 4 eggs work just fine. I melted the butter (since that's what my other brownie recipes call for), and I cut the amount of sugar in half (the brownies still had the right amount of sweetness). They were a little too cake-like for my taste, but I like the concept, so I'll try it again with other brownie recipes.

People love these....especially men. Make sure you have a thick enough layer of the patties or they taste like regular brownies. I use extra and overlap the patties.  Frosting is a must for me for all brownies. Awesome recipe!

I used the Best Brownie recipe in a 9x9 pan, 26 minutes baking time was perfect. I did not like the texture of the peppermint patties when it cooled as they became chewy. I topped with a ganache. The flavour was good but the texture was a deal breaker.

These were a total disaster for me, even though I had high hopes for this recipe. And yes, I did follow the instructions exactly. Ended up with a hard and sticky mess on the bottom and an overly crusty top that crumbled everywhere. This was the 3rd of 3 different peppermint brownie recipes I've tried over the past month, and this one did not make the grade. Perhaps a much shorter cooking time would have been better? But as written, this recipe sure didn't work for me, and both of the other brownie recipes were so good that I don't think I need to try this one again.

Very nice!  We used the "Perfect Brownie Pan" and the Mini York Peppermint Patties worked perfectly in the center of each brownie.

Hmmmmm?  Anyone know what I did wrong?  I baked them for a total of about 50 minutes and there was no evidence of peppermint patties!  They melted away.... nothing like the photo.  I used Yorks.   What gives?  Flavor was realllly good.
