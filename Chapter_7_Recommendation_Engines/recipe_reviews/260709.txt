10.30.17  Lot of chopping, but time well invested.  Made this in an Instant Pot®, followed the recipe to the letter, with the exception of using ham (Smithfield® Anytime diced ham which was on BOGO) instead of turkey ham.  It was a bit too thick after releasing the pressure, so I did mix in more chicken stock and some of the reserved liquid from the can of corn.  People have different preferences on soup or chowder texture, so this is not a negative.  This soup/chowder is loaded with wonderful flavor, I wouldn’t change a thing, and most certainly I will be making this one again!

I used smoked cooked ham steak in place of the turkey bacon, and had home made chicken broth that I used. I enjoyed it very much, but have one pet issue with the instructions. "6 potatoes" is not meaningful - potatoes come in all different sizes so just saying 6 is inadequate. Express the ingredient in cups or ounces, not ambiguous.

Another fabulous recipe to add to the Instant Pot® repertoire. I made it as written except I didn't have any ham, but I had smoky cheddar which gave it a hint of that flavour. I gave it a good stir which broke up the potato chunks and made it nice and thick. It tasted really spicy until I added the corn and cheese, then the flavour really levelled out. Do you ever keep tasting something until you've basically had an entire serving? Five stars.

This was my first recipe attempt with my brand new instant pot. I followed the instructions with the exception of omitting the corn (didn't have any), using leftover Christmas ham instead of turkey ham, and using less pepper. The consistency of the potatoes and other veggies was right on. Even though I used less pepper, my kids still found it too "spicy." My instant pot took about 30 minutes to get to pressure. Even though this could just as easily be made on the stove, I enjoyed making it with my IP.

My first test with the Instant Pot and I'm ecstatic about the results! I might use a little less pepper, but this will definitely go into the rotation. I appreciated the reviewer who noted that there's quite a bit of chopping here, so I planned the time accordingly. Thanks for a great recipe!

Great flavor, only modification i did was at some cayenne pepper and garlic. Rich and heavy too much to be a side dish, this could easily be a main

The title definitely needs to be changed to disclude "chowder". This is a SOUP, as written, not a chowder! And with that being said- I was looking for a chowder recipe to make in my Instant Pot, not a soup! So, thankful I read prior comments- those made the difference. 

The recipe as written is perfect for a potato soup. The one thing I would change in the original- omit adding the extra salt with the pepper. The chicken stock & ham has PLENTY of salt to begin with! 

But because I wanted a thicker chowder, I also added in an extra 1-2 Tbsp of flour & about 1/4-1/2 cup of heavy cream. Not ideal for the health-conscious, but it made it WAY better. That also helped to reduce the overly salty taste. And next time, I may use creamed corn instead of regular, to cancel out adding in actual cream, but I will also add in some bacon and possibly peas. I did love the generous portions of vegetables in this. 

Super quick & easy for the Instant Pot! The most time consuming process was chopping everything prior. The rest is a total breeze & the result was great with the couple of tweaks! Excellent comfort food & great for colder weather meals.

This was very good.  It was my first attempt at using the Instant Pot so wasn't sure how it would turn out.  At first I was disappointed because it did not look like soup.  I took another reviewer's advice and put half of it into a blender and mixed it back together and voila, it looked normal!  Only changes I made was I added no corn, and used bacon instead of turkey or ham.  Delicious and hearty!

My 2nd soup recipe in my new Instant Pot and it did not disappoint!  I did omit the meat and used only 1 tsp of salt figuring that the cheese would be salty enough (and it was).  Not sure how much "6 potatoes" was so I peeled and cubed 6 large baking potatoes.  After the soup was done I used the back of a wooden spoon to mush about 1/2 c of the cooked potato cubes against the side of the liner to create a more creamy soup.  That did the trick.

Ok...I guess I like my potato soup more like a "creamy potato soup" because I couldn't leave it as it was when finished cooking.  Big chunks of potato in a broth is not what I like.  With that said, I used an electric mixer and mixed it all up. That made it more like a mashed potato mixture...so then I heated some more chicken broth/stock (because I had some left anyway) and stirred that in. THEN added the corn, ham, and cheese and stirred until melted. I needed to add more spices (probably since i diluted it) so I added salt, pepper, a little onion powder, and season-all.  Made some cheese toast for the side and enjoyed it!   
In the future I'll leave out half of the onions and carrots when blending/mixing with the mixer because I blended ALL of the chunks out and you couldn't really distinguish the onions.    Overall though, a great recipe that I now know how to tweak!

I made this tonight and it was delicious. The only thing I did different was substitute diced ham for the turkey.

Delicious!  It came out pretty thick, so it was more of a chowder.  Taste was fantastic.
