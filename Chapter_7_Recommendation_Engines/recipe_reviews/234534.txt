This stew has a great flavor, don't be afraid to use Guiness.  It will not be bitter, even if you omit the sugar like I did.  I used only one pot: rendered the bacon-removed it; dredged 3.75 lbs. beef in flour (with salt and pepper) browned it-removed it; cooked the onions and garlic; deglazed with Guiness; added 26 oz. of beef stock (instead of chicken stock) tomato paste, thyme, and vegetables; put the beef and bacon back in;  simmered for 2 hours and then used a gravy separator and some corn starch to thicken the gravy (made 4.5 cups gravy).  Go easy on the salt, there is enough in the beef stock.  Served it just like in the picture!

We have all decided this is a top 3 family recipe. From my 2 to 15-year-old, everyone inhales this. I make no changes bc it's perfect as is. I make the french bread rolls to die for (also on this site). Trust me, you'll want rolls to soak up every bit of this delicious gravy. So amazingly good and so easy to make a ring with the potatoes. My kids love the presentation as much as the meal.

Absolutely delicious.  I served it to my family with Irresistible Irish Soda Bread from this site and my toddler and husband gobbled it all up.  Next time I make this, however, I will be sure to serve over potatoes or Colcannon as this only made enough for one meal for my 4 person family.  Also, my 7-year-old turned her little nose up at it because of the intensity of flavor - which I think could have been dodged had I served it over mashed potatoes.  We enjoyed it (except the 7 year old) but afterward decided that since it's such a very flavorful stew, almost like a gravy, some sort of mashed potato accompaniment really is a must.

Another thought: I did use beef stock instead of chicken (beef is what I had on hand) and I wonder if using the chicken stock could have dialed down the strength of the stew.  Going to go that way next time.

I made this recipe for a family Christmas party using smoked, overly cooked (i.e. DRIED OUT!)leftover brisket. I was hoping the cooking slow and low in the Guinness would tenderize and moisten the brisket. It turned out FANTASTIC and there were NO leftovers, sorry to say! LOL! I made it the next day for my family, again using this overcooked, smoked brisket and it turned out just as great! THIS is DEFINITELY a keeper!! (I didn't use any sugar. That's the only adjustment I made, except for the dried out meat I used!) A GREAT way to use up meat that turned out too dry and tough! Thanks for this recipe, Chef John!!

My family all loved this stew.  My husband is an ok, but not great cook and doesn't really care what he eats.  I asked him to make this recipe since I was busy and it seemed easy.   When he sat down to eat, he actually looked surprised and said "THIS is what I think of when I think of stew".  That is now a staple in our house.  Its rich and really flavorful and easy to make.

Great recipe!  I used beef broth instead of chicken and we loved this stew. Many stews seem to lack a bit in flavor but not this one. We had it with mashed potatoes. I will definitely be keeping a supply of Guinness on hand just for this stew. Thanks Chef John! I do love your recipes!

WOW! This was amazing! I made it for St. Patty's Day yesterday served with green beer! Hubby said this is the best Irish dish! I doubled the recipe just so we can have left overs and followed it to a 'T' except I didn't measure out the s&p, just generously seasoned the meat with both prior to browning. I also added diced mushrooms and thickened it up a little with flour whisked with water.  Served over garlicky red mashed potatoes (see pic) and with the Irish Brown Bread from this site.  Even my daughters raved about it!  Personally I thought it needed a little more salt so next time may try it with beef stock instead.  Love Chef John's recipes!!!  :o]

Made his last night for friends, cooked everything in my moms 50 year old cast iron Dutch oven, started on the stove then moved it into the oven on 300 then 250 for three hours.  Paired with a nice Cabernet sav , some irish soda bread, some champs (mashed potatoe w butter and scallions) and followed with Eton Mess and a Warm Hug hot chocolate w irish liquor ) some irish music in background, we could've been there.  Cooked for 10, and 8 of us left, not a spoonful left as everyone had heaping seconds.

This smelled amazing as it was cooking. I dissolved about a tablespoon of flour into some of the cooking liquid and added it back into the pot to help thicken it up. The taste was a little more bitter than I expected, but not in an overpowering way. It was fabulous with the garlic mashed potatoes I made. Not sure how it will be on its own, but I'll find out when I eat the leftovers tomorrow.

Made this stew last night and served it with mashed potatoes. The family LOVED it.  I have been making beef stew for years, and this was the best yet. The flavors are delicious and I especially like that it does not require flour or cornstarch as a thickener. Chef John, thank you for sharing this recipe, it is all that you described and definitely a keeper.

I've been looking for a good stew recipe for many years and after trying about five or six different recipes from this website alone I was ready to give up.  My teenage son has always told me he does not like stew but I was determined to find one that we could all enjoy.  This one sounded interesting with dark beer in the ingredient so I thought I would try it.   I couldn't find Guinness so I purchased another dark beer.  One other change was that I used tomato sauce since I had no tomato paste.  After cooking the bacon and browning the beef I put everything in a crock pot for six hours on low.  I was very pleasantly surprised at how good this stew turned out and my son enjoyed it as well!  This will be my go to stew recipe!  Yum!

I just got back from Ireland where I had Guinness stew.  I reviewed lots of recipes and picked this.  It is DELICIOUS!!!!!  Next time, though, I will use 2/3 of the meat and more veggies.  I cut up some potatoes to add to it versus mashed, but they and the celery dissolved into the stew by the end.  Next time, a little less meat and more veggies.  I will put the chopped celery and potatoes in later in the stewing process.  Flavor is unbeatable.

This was a great cold weather food with a great rich taste.  I substituted beef stock for chicken stock.  I think this gave the recipe a much deeper flavor.  Left overs reheated the next day were even better.  Football crowd is already requesting this for next weekend again.

Excellent!  Used beef round instead of chuck. Used a bit more carrot and celery.  Used 2 tsp dried thyme. Used leeks instead of onion. Used 1 pot only - did bacon, removed.  Did beef removed. Did leeks/garlic, then added everything else back in.  Put about 6 TBS flour and 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp pepper in ziplock bag and shook meat in it to coat, then browned.  Took about 1.5 hrs to cook or less covered (used cast iron dutch oven), then uncovered for the 15-20 min. It is one of our favorites!

This was very good. I did not have any Tomato Paste. I added 1/3 cup of Ketchup (cringe) and did not add the sugar. Came out great. I used a 11.? ounce bottle of Guinness that was in the back of the fridge! Chef John comes through again. Served with mashed potatoes and green beans. The men in my house were happy!

Absolutely Love this stew.  My husband told me to never make another kind of stew ever again. The flavors are so robust and served over mashed potatoes makes it such a hearty meal on a cold evening.

Delicious!! I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. I will say that the whole fresh thyme sprigs were a waste of money. Yes, the stems were easy enough to remove but all the leaves stayed in the stew. I would use dried next time as I always have it on hand. I really don't know what I could have added or substituted to make this any better.

I made this stew over mashed potatoes and it was THE BEST I've ever tasted. It's simple, yet rich and savory. Perfect for a rainy night. Pure comfort food. I'd give it TEN stars if I could. Amazing.

I think it was awfully good!  (I followed the original recipe conscientiously and precisely!)  My only dissatisfaction was that I (and at least part of my family) found it to be salty.  I can see where I can reduce the salt: in the original meat preparation; after adding onions... The bacon fat called for in the intial searing is great, but I do think it's a source of salty flavor. I'll stick with that, and cut the other salt sources.  This one IS a KEEPER!

I was hesitant to make this because I hate Guinness, but I'm SO glad I took a chance...It turned out amazing! Both my husband and I loved it. I planned to follow the recipe exactly. However, my son felt like being a handful while I was cooking, so I accidentally left out one (of the two) onions...still turned out great! Used my dutch oven. Will be making again soon!

Awesome - very easy to make and received rave reviews from my husband and another couple.   I threw it together, put it in the dutch oven and simmered it for 3 hours.    It has delicious flavor.  I didn't get to eat any of the left overs as they were "called" by husband.  Serve it with yukon gold mashed potatoes.  I added beef bones to the pot and took them out b4 serving.

Wonderful recipe! I followed the video instructions, it was super easy to make and turned out great. I added just a little bit of cayenne at the end and found it really stepped it up a notch. This will now be my go to stew recipe.

I don't normally rate foods, but this was probably the best thing I've ever fixed.  I'm doing weight watchers and this was fairly easy to calculate (for points).  The meat was extremely tender and I used Guinness Extra Stout.  Man this was good...and smelling it cook for over 2 hours just makes you want it more.  Awesome, awesome recipe!  Thanks!

This was very good!  Even though the stove was on low, the liquid cooked very low.  I had to add a lot more chicken stock periodically.  The beef was so tender it fell apart when chewing.   Very good recipe.

I can’t wait to make this stew the right way! Here’s the deal -- I messed the recipe up so bad that I was forced to drain off the chicken and Guinness broth and rinse the bacon, beef and vegetables. (Don’t ask…just chalk it up to being new in the kitchen). But this still turned out to be a 5 Star meal. It was so good that my wife requested we make it the next weekend and invite her boss over to try it! So if I make it correct the first time, this should be a three star Michelin Restaurant Guide recipe. I’m so glad we have leftovers!

Loved this recipe!!! I did make some slight changes only because I wanted more veggies.  As well as what the recipe called for, I added a few parsnips and some turnip.  I also added a bit more garlic (it always mellows) and only had a bottle of Guiness (a little less than what was called for).  To lighten the carb load, I served over a mixture of 1/2,potatoes & 1/2 cauliflower mashed together....nobody knew the difference!!! Yummy!! Can't wait to make this again!!

This stew is the most delicious I have ever tried. I made it for our annual family cookie making gathering!  Everyone came back for seconds, my son-in-law had 3 helpings!  I doubled the recipe, used dried thyme. This recipe is a definite keeper. The mashed potatoes is a great way to serve it.

I did not care for this recipe. It tastes nothing like any guiness stew i've ever eaten. I'm always looking for a new recipe on here but this one is my first (1 star)

This was really good and I'm not even a stew person.  It had me at beer.  The beer does it for sure.  I needed to add some cornstarch to thicken it up some more to my liking but other than that I followed to a T.

My fiance ate 2 big platefuls with mashed potatoes for St. Patrick's Day.  Rich, warm comfort food for this still-freezing March!  Froze the leftovers and I know they'll be even better later!  Followed recipe as written and it was wonderful.

Love this stew! I've made it many times now and I can't make regular beef stew anymore, it's just not the same! The only thing I did different is I used dried thyme instead of a sprig, as I didn't have any on hand. Also, I toss the meat in a ziplock bag and coat it in flour before cooking. I feel that helps to thicken the stew. I love the addition of baccon,  gives off such a nice flavor. This is currently cooking on my stove as I type this, actually. We're having people over for an Irish themed night since St Patty's is right around the corner and I can't wait for everyone to try it!! Thanks for the great recipe!

(Dec 2015) Just wanted to come back and say everyone loved it! They all agreed that I have to make it every year now. I'm ok with that ;)

Had to change some measurements because I didn't have correct amounts on hand: I didn't quite cover my veggies (added turnips) with chicken broth, so used 2 11 ounce bottles of Guinness, didn't have fresh thyme so I used a teaspoon of ground instead, added a full 6 oz can of tomato paste (what am I going to do with a leftover 4 oz?) and then added a teaspoon of turmeric for good measure. It all cooked down quite nicely, no need to add flour to thicken, I'm guessing maybe from some of the starches released from the turnips? Served it with cheesy green onion mashed potatoes. My husband doesn't like beef stew in general and says he really liked this, so this recipe is a keeper.

First attempt to make this stew and it was awesome!  Had a St Patrick's day dinner for my husband and it was a hit! Served with Diana ' s colcannon, amazingly easy Irish soda bread and corned beef with cabbage. This will be the new St Patrick's day meal!

I am not a lover of stew, but I make it because my husband is.  Because of that, I didn't expect much from this recipe.  I used beef broth instead of chicken and I had vegetable juice (V8) so I used 1+1/2 cups of that for the tomato paste.  Cooked this in a crock-pot 6ish hours on high and much to my surprise, it really did turn out well.  I even went back for a second bowl.  Oh yes, my husband also enjoyed a second bowl.

I made this Guinness beef stew exactly as the recipe says. I used Guinness Draught for the beer. I served it over garlic mashed potatoes. It was delicious! I have some picky eaters in my family and surprisingly everyone loved it. I'll definitely be making this again.

Great recipe! I used Murphy's Stout and carrots from our garden. Did it in my Dutch Oven and served it over the leftover mashed potatoes from our holiday dinner. Huge hit. Kids cleaned their bowls and hubs had two! I will definitely make it again.

Made this stew along with Irish soda bread- great combination! Recipe was easy to follow and it gave the house a good smell as it simmered all afternoon. Guinness adds a good flavor to build on.  I didn't change anything and was quite pleased with the outcome. I'll be making this again... and again... and again!

This stew is FANTASTIC! I threw in a couple extra slices of bacon, used a Guinness Extra Stout and substituted my homemade beef bone broth for the chicken broth. I made Paula Deen's garlic mashed potatoes and the combination is delicious.

OK, I have been using allrecipies.com for as long as I can remember. I have never left a review on anything good or bad. My husbands favorite thing for me to cook is stew, but I never found anything that we all felt was THE STEW until now. This is AMAZING. Also, let me say, I am feeding a VERY finicky husband, a even MORE finicky 9 yr old, a 6 yr old and a 5 yr old. Each of whom LOVED this. The only thing diff I did was add more veggies, coat the meat in flour before I browned it, I couldn't find Guinness so I used some other dark beer, (it was a pint and 6 oz, used it all) 2 cans off beef broth, and dried thyme instead of fresh. I also made as another poster suggested the Irish soda bread from this site...and put the stew over chunks of that in bowls. Again, to die for. Thank you SO MUCH for this recipe, my 4 yr long search for "THE STEW" is over!!

WOW!!  I made this for my husband & I on St. Patrick's Day and I agree, Guinness surely makes that toasty malt flavor addition a delight to the salivary glands :)  I did thicken the sauce a bit with cornstarch at the end of cooking as it was still too thin for me.  My husband raved about it & doesn't want to wait for another St. Patrick's Day to come around before enjoying it again:)  Neither do I---thank you so much, Chef John!!

Sorry, I used the advice of some of the others and used beef stock, instead of chicken. This was so absolutely delish!! I was looking forward to leftovers this morning but my husband beat me to them and took it to work! 

Anyone rating this one star just didn't do it right.

Good stew!  I used low sodium beef broth and did add a few potatoes.  I would have given it 5 stars except I would prefer it was a bit thicker.  Great flavor!

Best beef stew I've ever had. So rich and perfectly balanced. Added potatoes in as well after about 20 minutes. I didn't cook the whole 2 hours, I did 1.5 plus the reducing at the end due to impatient children and it still came out perfect.

Really, really good!  The meat was so tender and flavorful.  At the very end I added some flour to the broth to thicken the stew but otherwise no changes.  Will definitely make again!

This is a simple recipe that comes together easily and tastes fantastic. I have made it twice, once with Guinness, and the second time with Great Lakes Brewing Co. Edmund Fitzgerald Porter. Even though I love Guinness, the Ed Fitz is even better, in my opinion. The only other change I made was to add mushrooms to the stew, just because I like them, lol! This is now my go to stew recipe, and will be made often. I do suggest that you take Chef John's advice and add some cayenne to the stew; it adds a nice zing.

Wow! This is a great recipe. So after reading the wonderful reviews, I decided to make a larger batch if it really was that good and so there would be leftovers. I used 2 Chuck roasts for a total of 4.5 lbs. of meat. I used beef stock instead of chicken stock, 3/4 tsp. dried Thyme instead of fresh sprigs, doubled the Guiness Stout, and pretty much doubled everything else as well. I did use a couple Tbs. of flour, mixed with the liquid to thicken. I give this 5 stars because it is delicious and my husband gave it a thumbs up, especially when I didn't feed him Corned Beef and cabbage on St. Pats day like I usually do!:-) The flavor of this rich gravy reminded me of a Beef Burgundy dish that my mother used to make for our family while growing up.  The next time I make it I think the meat should be cut in smaller 1" chunks. I found the meat not to be quite as tender as I like after 3 hours of cooking. (I'm used to cooking this cut of meat in the crockpot, where it gets really tender.) I would probably thicken it a little more as well. Serving this over mashed potatoes was wonderful. Definitely a keeper!

I made it with wild goat meat and it was amazing.  The next time, I am going to minimize the use of the bacon fat and see if it is close to as good.

This smelled great while it was cooking, but I found the broth too thin and the flavor too salty for my taste. I did substitute beef broth for the chicken broth, maybe that's saltier? I'll definitely try it again, it's a great and hearty stew that really fills you up! But next time I'll cut down on the salt and for that last 20 mins of cooking I'll stir in a cornstarch/water mixture to help thicken it up. The stew went really well with a basic beer bread.

This is the best stew ever, my husband loved every bite. If you want it to be a bit thicker of a stew add 3 tbsp of flower throughly mixed into 1 cup of water, make sure there are no clumps, add this mixture to the stew and stir it in. It makes the stew a bit thicker and even more delicious!

This recipe was awesome! I followed precisely with the exception of thyme, which two grocery stores didn't have in stock. I substituted with dried oregano & basil. This is definitely going to be a regular favorite in my house. When I make it again I'll try thyme if it's available. Big thumbs up Chef John!

Delicious!  I made a couple of changes to the recipe: I used bottom round roast and beef stock instead of chicken, and added two cubed potatoes.  I will definitely make this again.

Delicious. Time consuming to prepare, but worth the effort. I never knew Guinness would give such a wonderful flavor to a stew, but it really does. I have made it multiple times and served it over mashed potatoes as suggested. Perfect!

Very hardy stew perfect for a cool evening. The use of Guinness was very interesting but the flavor was certainly enhanced by this dark beer. Will definitely add this to the repeat list!!!!

This sparked my interest because my husband Loves Guinness. So easy to follow added my own twist with a little beef stock because I found it was a little to thick for me. But this is amazing!!! Perfect with Mash

I had leftover uncooked stir-fry beef and Guinness from a party, and made (something close to) this with them. It was fantastic! My other changes (due to ingredients available) were +zucchini, +russet potato, +diced tomatoes, -thyme, -tomato paste, -sugar. It makes a thick, tasty stew.

Very nice dish.  But what is a stew without potatoes?  lets make it a real Irish American dish.  That is all I added.  I do like the Turnip idea, or Parsnips, maybe next time.  Crusty bread and this stew is a winner.

This is a great recipe! Wonderful flavor! Made it about a month ago. ( I used 1/2 t. dried thyme leaves since I didn’t have fresh). The whole family loved it. I served it with a ring of mashed potatoes and green onions. Definitely give this one a try. I am making it again today. It is a recipe I will use often.

Made it pretty close to the recipe. To be honest, I don't measure when cooking. Had a Shiner Bock in the fridge so I just used that instead of Guinness. Will definitely add this to our regular rotation!

Absolutely delicious! Added some mushrooms to the other veggies and served it in a sourdough bread bowl vs over mashed potatoes.  This will be a staple on our fall camping trips!

It had a good flavor, but the recipe wasn't five stars good based on the fact that the gravy would not thicken up enough. Skimming the grease is definitely a must. I used some liquid from the pot and mixed with two tablespoons of corn starch and then added back into the pot. I also boiled for 20 minutes as the recipe states.. it thickened the sauce a bit but not enough to be a gravy consistency. Hubby and I were both a little disappointed about that because we were both looking forward to this recipe for hours as it simmered.

I made this pretty much exactly as written (only difference was I seasoned meat with garlic salt, only used one onion and I think I used a little more chicken stock). This is seriously amazing and I'm not a big cooker so definitely easy enough to make. Meat and carrots were fork tender and juice was awesome mixed with mashed potatoes. If you have trouble getting the juice to thicken let it boil 5-10 minutes then turn off the burner and let it sit a minute. I noticed it had thickened a lot when we went back for seconds.

We returned from Dublin a couple of weeks ago, and we ate this meal at nearly every pub. I made this recipe for St. Patty's day and it is the real deal. Straight out of a Dublin pub.  I subbed beef broth since I was out of chicken broth, and didn't include celery. Everything else was the same, and it came out tender, flavorful, and just the right amount of broth/gravy. Love it!

Excellent! This is so good! I just had a bowl and want another. Couldn't get Guinness but added a Scottish dark ale. Then added a pinch of Cayenne along with  1 extra celery stalk and 1 extra carrot, 1/2 lb white mushrooms and 4 Russet Potatoes diced into 1" pieces. (Didn't want another dirty pan). Other than that followed recipe to a T. Definite keeper. Thank you Chef!

I wish I would've taken a photo, but it was gone so fast that I couldn't! Hands down the best recipe I have tried on here yet! I went by the recipe as closely as I could. I substituted dried thyme for the thyme sprigs. Also substituted a brown ale for the Guiness Stout, that's all my local shop had available in a single bottle or can. But, it all came together great. I did the first steps of cooking the bacon through deglazing the pan, then threw it all in the crock pot on high for 5 hours. Delicious!

Made as. directed in my cast iron. Dutch oven. It was delicious. If you don't have time to monitor it, I'm sure you could toss all the seared ingredients and the veggies, broth and tomato paste into a slow cooker and cook for 4 hours or so on low. I served it with Irish champ. Great.

I really enjoyed this stew for St. Patrick's Day! A lot quicker and easier than I imagined. Since I was only cooking for two, I had to cut the recipe in half, which made me nervous, but it turned out just right! My stew didn't thicken naturally as much as I thought it would, but regardless it was fine with me. I had some tri-color carrots on hand, so I added a few yellow ones for extra color. This recipe is already hearty, but I threw in some chopped mushrooms I had on hand at the last few mins of cooking to stretch out the recipe a bit more. This recipe goes a very long way, even after cutting it in half. There is still a lot of leftovers to last me for the rest of the week! I served it on top of some cauliflower & chive "mashed potatoes". I will definitely make this again!

This was EXCELLENT,despite my errors. I didn't have bacon, so used bacon grease to brown the meat and vegies, then forgot the sugar. The sugar wasn't needed, though, so it was ok. I even had to add another 1/2 can of Guinness because I cooked it so long it thickened too much.
This is a top-of-the list recipe for me now!

Made this for dinner last night. It was a big hit. I followed the ingredients and it came out perfect. The gravy did thicken as I let it cook a bit longer.

Fairly easy to make and I can't say enough about the flavor. It was excellent on potatoes and of course my family likes to dip crusty Italian bread any time there's tasty gravy. We loved it!

I fixed this for my dad and his wife, and me and my fiancé and our two kids, 13 and 8.  Everyone loved it. I fixed it as the recipe read except for adding more because my 13 year old can eat his weight in beef. Can't wait for leftovers tomorrow.

This will be the firehall dinner tonight. WITH the Guinness as I'm aware the ETOH cooks out.  The maltiness will be AMAZING as I can tell already.  Cooked as directed, but I added a packet of onion soup mix in addition.  I will make "smashed" potatoes as well in trying to keep with the "peasant" or "home style" of cooking it.

Tasted good to me but unfortunately I didn't have anyone to try it out on as my kids wouldn't try it. Made it as detailed although I cooked it in an stock pot which I think I should have added more cook down time. Next time I think I will add more carrots. Looks and tastes good.

Loved this stew! It was pretty easy and smelled great cooking all afternoon. Mine didn't thicken much at all but it didn't make a difference to us. We still ate it over the mashed potatoes and it was delicious.  Thank you!

Made this for St. Patrick's Day this year and it was AMAZING. Followed recipe except for the salt and pepper measurements. I don't usually measure when seasoning with them. Just seasoned the meat generously and added a bit of salt with the onions when it said to. Did not add any at the end. Served it with some quick generic mashed potatoes and a Guinness of course. My roommates are already demanding I make it again next weekend, which I may just do, because there were no leftovers.

A great stew!  Our bacon was of the peppered variety, so left off any additional salt and pepper (thankfully, as there was plenty of both).  The chuck steaks were a dollar per pound cheaper, so bought a little over two pounds and cubed them.  Also, could not find Guinness, so used Coors and don't know if this made a difference.  To the beef (not chicken) stock, added some cleaned baby portabella mushrooms and liquified in the blender so that DH could not distinguish them, as he will not eat mushrooms if he can see them, lol.  Used baby carrots with great success and left out the celery.  Completely forgot the thyme, both at the store and while cooking, but will try to remember this next time.  Near the end of cooking, thickened the gravy somewhat by removing some of the juices to cool and mixing in flour.  Also made the mashed potatoes with very little butter and cream and no additional salt or pepper because of salt and pepper in the stew itself.  Very tasty, as are all of Chef John's creations!

Absolutely delicious! I was looking for a new stew recipe and Chef John has not disappointed. My husband made this while I was at work. The flavors developed nicely while the stew rested . He followed the recipe exactly which I highly recommend, it is so well balanced. Do not skip the bacon it adds a mellow smoky flavor in the background.

I spent a week in Ireland and had beef stew every day.  I keep trying to recreate it.  This one gets close.  I think the tomato is a bit overpowering.  I will make it again, but with either less paste or use tomato sauce to tone down the tomato taste.  I also bumped up the garlic level (I love garlic).

Made it (and ate a bunch) yesterday and froze the rest).  I followed the recipe exactly except I bumped up the vegetable count by adding parsnips along with the carrots and some potatoes near the end.  Absolutely the best stew I have ever had.

Turned out lovely. Good flavour. Next time I will try some of the suggestions to use beer and flour the beef before browning. Really great classics though.

Absolutely delicious!  My little local store doesn’t sell Guinness so I had to sub for Shiner, which was the closest to Guinness.  I had beef broth on hand and used what I had instead of chicken broth. I also added a bay leaf and forgot to add the sugar. The stew was heavenly.  The flavor with the beer is unique and rich.  We poured it over mashed potatoes with sliced green onions.  My husband raves about the dish! 
This made a lot of stew for two people we had left overs the next day. I ended up freezing the rest to heat up in the future. 
Make this!

Not my favorite, but it's edible.  I put it over spaghetti squash instead of mashed potatoes.

This was a big hit.  I couldn't get my hands on a can of Guinness because all of the liquor stores were closed.  I substituted Amstel Light, which is all I had on hand.  To make it richer, I used beef stock instead of chicken, which added some extra flavor.  I followed all of the other steps in the recipe.  Everyone loved it.  I'll have to hide a can of Guinness next time my hubby brings it home so I can try the recipe as written.  Thanks Chef John!  Your videos and recipes are the best.

This stew is fantastic! I used beef broth instead of chicken broth, and about a teaspoon of dried thyme in place of fresh. Also, after simmering, I put in a 325 degree oven for 4 hours.

Made exactly as stated. It was outstanding. I didn’t do the potatoes. I crushed crackers instead. I’ve been using this app for years and this is my first review due to the fact this is the best tasting beef stew I’ve ever had

We will definitely make this again.  The only addition was that at the very end I swirled 2 tsp of corn starch in some of the liquid to help it thicken the gravy a little bit, we prefer a little bit of a thicker au jus as opposed to the runny that was at the end.  The flavour was wonderful and the texture at the end of the cooking of all of the meat and veg was right on!

I didn't think I was going to like it because of the Guinness Stout but, once it cooked through, it was really tasty and the meat was really tender. My husband really liked it. I would make this again and maybe make it in the instant pot.

I had a busy day leading up until the dinner so I used my Instant pot on slow cook, low, for 6 hours. I added a bit of extra stoudt and all was well. I made this for a girl's night and everyone enjoyed! I did serve it with colcannon as well.

It came out really great.  I added a dash of gravy master to make the sauce a deep brown.  You couldn't really taste the bacon in it at all.

Awsome!  Followed all ingredients, weights & measurements but one. You need to buy bottles which - dang! - are twelve ounces which requires cracking open a second one  ...tee hee hee.

I used the leftover from Chef John's beef rib roast and it was fantastic! Following this method still wasn't thick enough for my liking, so next time, I will add a tablespoon or so of flour before adding the broth. I also used beef broth, because that's what I had on had. This recipe is easy to follow and was so tasty! I let it cook for hours before we ate and the flavors were so amazing. Thanks for another successful recipe, Chef!

My husband and I were married in Ireland and discovered Guinness stew while there.  I was determined to be able to make it at home.  The recipe is very easy and delicious.  The only issue we had was not having enough leftovers!

I used beef broth and added a full 4 cups of broth and doubled the carrots.  I love carrots and it is good to have some vegetables in your stew.

I followed the recipe exactly the first time and while I was initially worried about the bitterness of the Guinness (as I am not a fan), it turned out great!  Oh I did thicken the stew at the very end but it was very flavourful without any additions.  Will make again.

This stew was really flavorful, and off-the-charts good. I seared the pieces of chuck for extra flavor. 
I'll say that this is exactly what I was hoping for when I made it, and it was just as hearty and chunky and filling as I wanted it to be. I am not a beer drinker, so I was afraid that the alcohol from the Guinness might be overpowering, but it was not at all. It gave it richness and depth (oh my gosh I am so sorry, I know how pretentious I sound as I am typing it but that is the best way to describe it). 
The flavor was so good I wanted three bowls, but the potatoes and beef and bacon are so filling, you feel satisfied and happy with one.

Great recipe! I usually use red wine in roast but I think we liked this more. Can't say I'll cook it exactly like this again, but I will definitely use the flavor combination again.

Delicious! I made it as written except I had no tomato paste, so I used ketchup, which was fine.  I also added some fresh mushrooms because I had them and I knew they'd be good.  I loved it. My husband didn't say anything--never does,but he ate 2 huge bowls and more the next day.

This was amazing! Its been a while since I made this, but I remember it was so yummy! I followed the recipe exactly. I usually don't fix beef because I grew up in the midwest and having beef a lot got sick of it...but this I will make again!!

This was a delicious stew!! The only thing i added to the meat was adobo and mustard powder (if you dont have you can use regular mustard), the mustard wont change the taste it enhances it. I have a small family so i didnt use the 2 1/2 pound of meat but i did use 1 1/2 and followed the recepie with the two tiny adjustments. As chef recommends which i did put salt as the meat is simmering because when you add any liquid the salt dissipates, so you do have to adjust unless you like it the way it tastes as its cooking and thats ok too. Using a dutch oven is a great tool while making this stew since it wont stick and optimises the flavors in my opinion and ive done this stew in other pots but the dutch one is the best i believe. Holy moly this was overall a really good recepie and i have made a few stews but this one is our favorite. Thanks for this recepie chef John!!!!

I did as others suggested by using low sodium beef broth, thickening gravy, did not add salt, and used about half of pound of bacon(LOVE MY BACON)!

This was absolutely delicious! My husband told me more than once how good it was. We are not big meat eaters so I only used 1 1/2 Lbs and doubled the carrots & celery. Keep everything else the same. Served with Chef John’s mashed potatoes. I will definitely be making this again.

Made this tonight and it was excellent!  Followed the recipe, though I did make a few changes - beef broth, double carrots/celery, added 2 small diced parsnips, used 1 Guinness and 3/4 Sweet Baby Jesus Peanut butter Porter (all I had left), and added quartered red potatoes at 1 hr mark.  2 of us ate it with the potatoes in the dish, and I had Czech dumplings with it.  Yummy:)!!  Tomorrow I'll make with mashed potatoes - sounds great too.  Next time I'll add chopped mushrooms and green peppers.  Thank you so much for the recipe...definitely a keeper!

I made this recipe last night. I thought it was odd that it called for chicken stock and not beef stock, but I stuck with it. I ended up having to add 8 cubes of beef bullion, as the taste fell flat. next time I will use beef stock. otherwise a great recipe

Great dish.  I love it even though I don't like drinking beer.  Guiness brand is not necessary if you can't find it, just look for a similar type of beer - dark and smooth.

This is the best stew I've ever had

Easy as can be.  The only changes i made where in quantity - add twice the amount of carrots and celery. Also used a small amount of corn starch in the end. The Guinness only leaves behind s malt flavor, not beef taste. My new go to stew recipe

Followed this recipe to a T, both my husband and I thought it was terrific! The Guinness added an out of this world depth to the dish. Adding mashed potatoes elevates the recipe to a whole new level. Will be adding this dish to our rotation.

This stew is absolutely amazing. My husband said that it’s probably his favorite dish. He’s a beef and potatoes man. I mainly followed the recipe. I didn’t measure out the salt and pepper and did thicken it out just a bit with some flour mixed with some sauce from the stew.

It turned out amazing! Rather than putting on mashed potatoes we put potatoes in the stew. We also added some red wine with the beer the second time. Idk if it was as good this way but it was different and still delicious. We ate it out of bread bowls each time and loved it

Made it for group of friends, doubled the recipe, sliced garlic instead of crushing, baked in dutch oven for 3 1/2 hours at 325 after initial skillet cooking. Came out fantastic, everyone raved over it

love it.  We've made it a number of times, I usually add mushrooms to it as well, because I love mushrooms in stew.

So I made this knowing my mother and sister were coming to visit. (My mother taught me most of my cooking skills, which still pales in comparison to hers, so I had to make a good impression). So I prepared this as per the recipe, but found the stew to be too watery. So I whisked up a quick roo(?) using butter, to thicken it. It did the trick and the mashed potatoes did not come out soggy. Oh, and I also used sirloin tip roast, which is just amazing for a dish like this!

Great stew with excellent depth of flavor.  I omitted the sugar and let mine simmer for a bout 4 hours very low temp.  This is a great winter recipe!

The Beef & Guinness Stew is amazing.  The only change I made was I simmered the stew a couple more hours until I reached the tenderness of the meat.  I made it with mashed potatoes that I made ahead of time & placed the potatoes in a crock pot for a couple hours (no longer) before I served the stew.  Excellent!!

Excellent flavor.  Modified based on ingredients in house: used a dif dark beer,  Beef stock vs Chicken,  served over smashed roasted petite yukon gold's, and one pot.  Flour/season coated the beef before browning, tho I'm not sure I'd do so again as I needed to use Arrow Root slurry to thicken.  Will certainly make this again.

Delicious beer taste. Loved pouring it on the mash potatoes. We used half the meat and double the veggies, and also reduced sodium beef broth and it was still delicious.

I didn’t have carrots and tomato paste on hand. I omitted the carrots and replaced tomato paste with ketchup. I know, I know, “KETCHUP....” I also didn’t have dark beer so I used IPA. IPA didn’t turn my sauce bitter at all!! Even though with all these substitutes, it turned out AMAZING! I can’t wait to try it again using the original recipe! Thank you thank you! 

Oh and I used cornstarch to thicken the sauce. We ate over rice and it was amazing. :)

Very nice recipe! I did not follow it completely because I was looking to use venison I had in the fridge. I added some extra bacon to balance the difference in fat but forgot to add celery. Also, when seasoning the beef before browning, consider replacing the salt with monosodium glutamate.

Everyone enjoyed this for St. Pat's day/birthday dinner. Recipe was followed exactly. I opted for frozen mashed potatoes to save time. Great re-using the skillet several times to save on cleanup time. Next time I might thicken the sauce a bit, but we've now had it twice as is and are still planning another meal using the leftovers.

This was great!  I added cabbage to the stew, it seemed very fitting.  Next time I am going to make it without the tomato paste and see how it changes the flavor.  In my opinion, it overshadowed the other flavors, especially the beef and bacon.  I may also add a larger quantity of vegetables, it could have used a little more even with the additional cabbage.

I made this for St Patrick’s day and will be making it again. I only used one onion and used a leek because I had it. I also threw in more carrots, 5 total, and used beef broth instead of chicken. 
I let it simmer all morning, about 6 hours total. The beef has so much flavor and was so tender. My picky husband loved it!

Did not change a thing except doubled it for a party.  I was nervous because of the lack of flavourings (worcestershire etc) that are commonly used but the Guinness really works its magic.  The stew was delicious, rave reviews by all.  Will definitely make it again and for company.

I was making a half recipe but used the full amount of bacon and beer (and added less chicken stock so the total liquid was relative as per the directions-"as needed to cover").  I also used a leek instead of onion since I bought a bundle to make colcannon) and I forgot the celery. This was very easy to assemble but I think it could have benefitted as a crock pot recipe as my beef turned out a little tough.  It was still very tasty and went well with the colcannon recipe https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/15644/colcannon/?lnkid=usspnt&media=https:%2F%2Fimages.media-allrecipes.com%2Fuserphotos%2F250x250%2F2432844.jpg&description=Colcannon%20-%20Allrecipes.com&utm_medium=social&utm_content=20190312&utm_source=pinterest.com&utm_campaign=social-share-recipe

Will definitely make this again. I followed the suggestion of the top commenter and made it all in one pot, using a dutch oven. I browned the bacon, took it it out, seared the meat, took it out and cooked the onions and garlic and then added everything back. I used beef broth and cut back on the salt.  Next time I will add more carrots and some mushrooms.  I did not thicken the gravy with flour and it was still delicious over mashed potatoes.

Yum!! Made this for a St. Paddy’s Day dinner with family and it was so good! Only change I made was adding 1 T corn starch slurry to it at the end to help thicken. Pairs nicely with green beer!

Delicious! Minced up some mushrooms to get a few extra nutrients in on my boys. A little flour to thicken because everyone was starving. It does need the cook time to tenderize the meat so the 2nd batch I made I'm sure will be perfect tomorrow. Served with mashed, yummy! and Serving with corn bread tomorrow!

Made it to help my Irish Canadian boyfriend eat more vegetables. Totally succeeded because he had like thirds. Very hearty and flavourful, try adding different vegetables like potatoes or something that can hold its structure in a slow boil and get creativite

Absolutely delicious! I made last St Patricks’s day after returning from a trip to Ireland. We are Guinness Beef Stew while in Dublin and found this recipe to be spot on!! Can’t wait to make it again!

Delicious thick, robust, complex flavor. Substitute Brussel Sprouts for carrots and added spinach. Served over cauliflower rice instead of potatoes. Definite do over.

I needed to add a touch of corn starch as the gravy was a bit thin for my liking but other than that it was a great stew.

Chef John's recipes always turn out very well, and this was no exception. Based on what I had on hand, I had to make a few changes. I had no bullion or broth of any kind (time to go to the store, but it's snowing heavily), so I used a packet of Lipton's Onion Soup in about 2 c hot water instead. I didn't have fresh thyme but did have some lovely dried thyme leaves. Also I am out of tomato paste, so I substituted about 1/4 c of Portland Ketchup (and omitted the sugar). I threw in some frozen mushrooms and put in about 7 carrots. Served with mashed potatoes. Oh my gosh, my husband and daughter raved about it, and my grandson inhaled it. So good. Will be making again and again.

Best stew I've ever had! The market was out of thyme so I used basil. I used thick cut bacon, substituted fresh bone broth for the chicken stock and used farm fresh stew beef. The meat was so tender. I am definitely making this again. Basically it's an excuse to buy an 8 pack of Guinness so J can use 1 for the stew.

very good! Just made for superbowl and everyone liked it. I made it in 1 pot, because honestly I didnt read the full recipe before starting but it seemed to come out fine. I didnt use the bacon but I'm sure it would be great with it too. I added diced potatoes and thickened it up quite a bit and did not serve it over anything. I used dried thyme and I personally would not recommend omitting the sugar like other reviewers, I think it needs it. I happened to cook it for 3 hours because I had the time but I'm sure it would be good at 2. Great stew!

This is a yummy recipe. I serve the mashed potatoes separately so there is a choice of having them or not.  This taste just like the stew we had in Dublin.
Next time I'll make Irish soda bread to go with it.

This is so good!  Being gluten free, I use a stout from a local brewery in Golden CO called Holidaily Brewing Company.  At the end, I thicken it with a corn starch slurry.  Everyone wants seconds and the recipe!

Excellent and rich. Added a splash of Worcestershire sauce when cooking and frozen peas at the end for a touch of color. I also took another reviews advice and seasoned my flour with salt pepper and paprika prior to browning the beef.

This is THE most bland uneventful soup I have ever made. I cannot actually believe the 5 star ratings unless people enjoy tasteless food or something along the lines of canned soup. I followed the recipe to a T. I’m purely disappointed. I have never given a 1 star review before. Ever. Please beware. You have been warned by a few of us.

We loved this stew, so we gave it a 5/5; but, since we happen to like more spicy dishes, the next time we make it we will add some cayenne or peppers to give it a nice warm kick.

Made the recipe as written and it turned out fantastic! I should have seasoned meat more prior to browning and I held back on the sugar a bit- but other than that everything was super yummy!  Served as suggested, in a ring of mashed potatoes. Making again for sure!!!

I skipped the bacon, sugar, and thyme - added frozen english peas, cubed red potatoes, more tomato paste, 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper, and used beef broth instead of chicken broth. It was flavorful, rich and very filling on a cool (we don't ever really get cold in Houston) winters evening. And it was even better on day #2. Very unique-rich flavor!

World's worst stew maker ended up making the world's BEST stew.  I made a couple of minor changes.  I used a chocolate stout beer as I had no Guinness.  It made it richer.  I also used the chicken broth as in the original recipe.  Because I started it late, I cooked in a pressure cooker for 20 min. instead of the hours of baking.  Came out perfect.

This is a family pleaser at our house. We only use 1.5lbs of beef and we use a bit more veggies, but those are our only changes. We freeze half the same day because it makes a lot. I like this in a recipe because I cook once and we get dinner twice!

I followed everything closely but added a bit more beer, 16 oz instead of 14. It’s not as thick and heavy as a normal beef stew but I think the flavor is better.

This is by far the best beef stew I’ve ever made!! I put it over potatoes like the recipe calls for and it was divine. I used chicken stock at which I almost used beef consumme but glad I did not. Also, I did not have thyme so substituted Marjoram flakes and it was perfect! I also used a carton of sliced mushrooms that I braised in with the onions followed by garlic etc.... if you love mushrooms it was a fantastic add!!!

Delicious.  I did add some cut up mushrooms just because I like mushrooms. Very simple and delicious over mashed potatoes. Next time I may add a little flour to thicken it just a bit.

Incredibly delicious. I doubled the recipe, added 1/2 pork and 1/2 beef, turnips and stewed tomatoes, then cooked it in a crockpot all day. It must be the Guinness that gives this recipe its deep, hearty flavor. It was my first time using it for a stew and I almost left it out, thank goodness I didn’t. Very good and I will certainly make this again.

I put the sprigs in a cheese cloth bag to make sure they were easier to remove. Also I added,  1 table spoon of better then bouillon roasted chicken to the chicken stock...which made the flavor of the stock just a little richer. The end results was amazing!! There is not a single drop left. Thank you for the recipe!!

Yummers!  I will definitely make again, and forgot the carrots, don't need them if not a fan.  I used Guinness Stout which is thicker and creamier.  So this can be an expensive dish.   I got pre cut beef for 10.00 & change, bacon can be pricey if not on sale, Guinness my liquor store only sold in 4 pks which was about 9.00 and made sure to drink the rest lol, mashed potatoes I bought store brand pre done for about 4.00.  The rest is fairly cheap.  All in all it's a great meal, probably best beef stew ive ever had.  So for a special meal, or a break from the norm I would definitely suggest.  I also judged my liquid, I didn't use all of the stock, infact I only used beef broth which I had on hand and never had a problem with it being runny.  I used a giant yellow onion, and 2 giant cloves of garlic which prob made up the 4 and then some.  Don't skimp on fresh ingredients, even thyme I added a couple of extra sprigs.

The stew was perfect on flavor (though I added some roux to thicken it up, I just prefer it that way). It goes amazingly well with sour cream and onion mash potatoes.

Delicious beef stew!  I followed the recipe pretty closely, but did add mushrooms and added about two cans of broth to cover.  I simmered this for about 4 hours as I made before a football game, and did increase heat and allow some steam to escape to thicken.  I ended up taking a little broth off and made a cornstarch slurry to complete the gravy.  I also added a little onion and garlic powders, it just needed a little more flavor to brighten.  Hubby loved this and there are lots of leftovers for freezing.   Thanks, CJ, another great recipe.

I have yet to be disappointed by one of Chef John's recipes! I love this stew - it's so hearty and flavorful. I used my dutch oven and a can of Murphy's Stout. The only thing I added at the end was a tablespoon of flour dissolved in some of the cooking fluid to help thicken it a bit because boiling it down was taking quite a while.

Nice recipe, Chef John! This is my new go-to beef stew recipe. Easy and somehow quicker than the recommended 2 hour slow cooking time.  I’ve never been happy with my beef stew recipes but this one really hit the spot. The first time I used turkey bacon but the fat was a little scarce - so next time, it’s by the book.

I started with organic beef soup bones and 1tbsp apple cider vinegar in the water to make my own bone broth as the most nutritious base for this stew and added a few bay leaves with the thyme bundle.

Didn’t have bacon and used 1 cast iron pot for the whole thing.  Love this recipe.  Easy and very tasty, hit the spot!   Happy to find a beef stew recipe that doesn’t require 8 hours in the crock pot.

This stew was out of this world!!! Absolutely delicious. I followed everything  except I added mushrooms to add more flavor and because honestly I didn’t have as much meat like the recipe called for.  I also used chicken bouillon and dried thyme.  I let it simmer for the 2 hrs and once it was done I let it rest a little. The meat was incredibly tender and just melted in your mouth. This is hands down the best stew I have ever made.

This was my first Chef John recipe, and I was a bit hesitant to attempt as Guinness Stew has always been a hit or miss item for me when I go out to eat.  This recipe, which I followed to the letter, was infinitely better than any I’ve had out.  While perfectly good alone, this Stew really seems to sparkle when served inside of a mashed potato bowl.  Since making, I’ve attempted several different variations with potatoes inside the stew and none even hold a candle to the original.

This was amazing. It was a hit all around the table, from the 11 year old to the 72 year old. The kids loved how it was in a potato ring too. I was asked by all to please make this again!

Absolutely lovely stew.  I forgot the celery (duh!!!), so I substituted cabbage.   Made it yesterday, for dinner today - and it tastes better as the flavours melded overnight in the pot.  It will be awesome served over roasted garlic mashed potatoes.

My husband and I just returned from Ireland and I wanted to find a recipe for Guinness and beef stew.  This was the easiest recipe to make and it was delicious!  Next time, I'll omit the bacon, I didn't think it added anything to the stew, other than cooking the meet in the fat.  I did add raw potatoes about the same size as the carrots and celery and it was excellent.  When it came time to turn the heat up to thicken it, I didn't have any luck so I used a bit of cornstarch.  I'm definitely making this again!

I absolutely do not like beer of any kind so I was hesitant to try this.  OMG it is delicious!  Once everything was in one pan, I put it in the oven for 2 1/2 hours.  Probably because of that I had to increase liquids so I added  1/2 can stout and a few more cups of chicken broth.  This is on my 'WILL REPEAT' list and now, much to my shock, I keep a couple cans of Guiness Stout in my pantry.....LOL

This was fantastic!  The only thing I changed was to add a couple tbsp of Worcestershire sauce because I like the depth it adds.  I thought it was odd to use chicken stock but I agree with others who’ve said it likely would be too “beefy”, as odd as that sounds.  I saved the leftover beef and gravy to use another night for some beef dip sandwiches... top a bun with the beef, add sautéed onions and mushrooms and a slice of Swiss.  Melt in the oven and it’s SO good!

I've made this stew well over a dozen times in the last few years, and it always turns out amazing. The tomato and Guinness cook down to be earthy and sweet, and there is no trace of the original flavor of the Guinness by the time its finished stewing. I make the entire thing with a single cutting board, knife, ladle, and pot/lid, and serve it over mashed potatoes, though fluffy and steamed potatoes would be just as fantastic. You can save a lot of time by getting the meat already cut, along with whatever veggies you can find pre-cut at your local grocer. The only thing I have not yet tried is using frozen veggies, which could shave some more time off, though I dont know how it would affect the texture of the final dish.

Excellent stew. Very hearty and great depth of flavor. Could not find Guinness beer in a single bottle/can so used a Porter instead. I also only used 1 large onion and 4 large carrots (we like carrots). Other then those few differences I made exactly as is. I served over garlic mashed potatoes.

It's my go-to stew now.  Simply the best.  I don't change a thing.  For me, it's as perfect as it gets.  Plus I love, love, love the presentation.  No potatoes in the stew.  Instead, a delicious ring of mashed potatoes surrounding the stew.  It's as impressive as a stew can get in my book.  Chef John does it again.

This was the first beef stew I've ever made, and it was absolutely phenomenal! I added parsnips and used organic beef stock instead of chicken stock, and it worked out great! I loved the video by the chef as well. He was awesome. I highly recommend this recipe.

it was a hit at our house!  a bit different not putting potatoes in the stew, but , as suggested, I made mashed potatoes and put on top.  Everyone enjoyed it.  I served it with a nice warm sourdough bread.  Delicious and hearty.  Just waiting long enough so i can make it again.

I wanted to like this so much, I watched the video and it looked so delicious. I ended up really disappointed and although there is a real possibility that I did something wrong- I doubt I will use this recipe again. I hated the tomato paste. It’s all I could taste. I tasted hints of the Guinness but tomato really overpowered the chocolate overtones that peek out in other stews I’ve made. Next time I would omit the tomato, add a little more bacon and some cornstarch to thicken the stew a little more.

I made this with Elk sirloin meat and it was delicious.  I cooked as directed then transferred it to the crock pot for 5 hours on low. My husband loves it. We will make it again.

My husband and I loved this! Easy to make, super delicious. Made it with no modifications. Loved it with mashed potatoes (cheated with Bob Evans pre-made). The flavor was amazing. This is now my go-to beef stew recipe, others don't hold a candle.

Very flavorful, the Guiness beer adds something quite exquisite to the stew. I made as instructed, but omitted salt until the very end after boiling down.

I modified the recipe a fair bit, and this was the best result:
Double the bacon.
Sear the meat in butter.
Onion powder if you don't like onions.
Add peas.
Use 1/2 of the prescribed tomato paste; if you translate it to the smallest can of paste, use 1/2 of that small can. 
Add 4 red potatoes, cut into chunks.
Sub in asparagus for celery - it'll give the gravy a little touch of sweetness
End result is to-die-for.

Incredible flavor. I got compliments along the lines of "this is the best stew I've ever had". It was also relatively simple to make, just took some time and patience. The only change I made is I added some corn starch to thicken it up a little more.

Followed the recipe to the letter and it was amazing.  I let it thicken by leaving the cover off and letting it simmer for an hour.  This is certainly a keeper and a go to recipe.

I didn't have any carrots, so I just added a bit more celery and I added some mushrooms. I also quartered baby potatoes and put them in as well as I wasn't going to make a mash. This recipe is very forgiving. I was worried the "browned bits" on the bottom were too burnt but it didn't even matter. 
In the end, it turned out AMAZING! I used homemade beef stock instead of store bought.

We all loved it. I had to thicken the gravy with some cornstarch mixed with water. The guests served themselves, putting their own potatoes in a bowl then putting stew on top. I didn’t make enough potatoes!

The stew came out so awesome that even I was astonished myself by how it tasted, and I couldn’t stop tasting it while it sat in the oven, even though it was clear by then it was already great! I used a cast iron pot and had it in the oven on 150 degree for 2.5 hours. Also did away with the sugar and added a pinch of cayenne pepper instead! This is definitely a keeper — one that I would be proud to serve my guests!

Made it with Black Angus beef stew cuts from my local market, used a Stone Coffee Milk Stout in my fridge from a party the night before, and added a bit of red wine. This was delicious!  It did not really thicken very much but I thought that was fine, the broth was addictive. I did not serve it over potatoes and my husband and I thought they actually might have taken away from the flavor. Very good and easy!

My new favorite beef stew:
Except I use 1 1/4 cups extra chicken broth, add two tablespoons of fruit juice concentrate (cranberry-apple, cranberry, apple cider, or cherry have each worked great).
Also,  I skip the beer and sugar. Other than that I follow the recipe. I’m sure the beer would taste good to most  people; my taste buds just don’t enjoy  beer.

This recipe is not complicated and tastes sensational -- just a bit of prep work with all the ingredients.  I made it exactly as stated with no changes and no alterations in cook time.  I was very surprised as I had trouble lowering the temp to a slow simmer and feared my meat would be rubbery.  NO WAY!  Very tender.  I also used Guinness Nitro beer. . . mmm.  Will make this over and over -- not just for St. Patrick's Day.

My first attempt at a chuck roast stew and I made it for seasoned cooks (and eaters). They were all VERY impressed. So, a definite do-over - soon! Delicious.

I added red bell pepper and more thyme than the recipe called for.  Also thickened with a bit of flour at the end.  It was wonderful on the spring onion mashed potatoes!

I’ve tried several Guinness/stout stew recipes. This was hands down the best. Made according to directions except adding 1tsp dried thyme in place of fresh sprig. Also so I only had to use one pan I seared Irish bacon first, removed; sautéed onions adding garlic last minute, removed; seared beef; added beer scrapping, then threw everything in. Chicken broth was a good call. Did add more carrots. Flavor of gravy was fabulous.

I made this yesterday for St. Patty’s Day. It was delicious! I made exactly as specified except baked in the oven at 250 for two hours. I then finished it on the stove with the lid off so the gravy could thicken during which I made Chef John’s Irish Soda Bread. Awesome meal. Thank you Chef John!

Wow! Fantastic stew. My kids are the pickiest eaters and they loved this stew. So tasty and had no taste of beer at all. The only thing i changed was used beef broth instead of chicken broth because that was all i had. Results.. A++. Definitely earned a place in my cookbook. Thank you for the recipe!

Rich tasting stew.  Only thing I did different was half lamb half beef and doubled recipe.   I did simmer stew for about 10hrs  with the lid ajar just a tad.  Best stew  I have had in a long time.

Excellent. Only change was beef broth rather than chicken. Used Chuck-eye steak, which I prefer to stew beef. Had last night for dinner and again for lunch today.

I followed the directions exactly and I thought it came out too salty for my taste, I even used sodium free chicken stock. I think you could cut back to 1/2 teaspoon salt when seasoning the raw beef and maybe skip salting the sautéing onions all together. Other than that is was ok. The cooking liquid was a bit thin, but I liked that, and boozy tasting, I liked that too. 
This recipe is not really a 5 star but was tasty. I guess I'm just not a stew person. The reviewers that seemed to have the most success with this recipe browned the meat and then put that and the remaining ingredients in the crock pot and cooked on low for a long time. If I make this again I would do it that way.

First time making this--and local grocery didn't carry Guinness, so I went with a Foster's....and the taste was quite nice and bold--perhaps NOT the same had I used Guinness, which I will try next time and update this review.  Didn't like the green onion mashed potato ring Chef John suggested--but leftovers were perfect w/ rice.....and just the stew alone, too!!

This was very, very good.  We didn't add the sugar which turned out to be the right choice since the carrots kinda sweetened the stew.  We also added potatoes.

This was flat out the best beef stew I have ever eaten!!! Had some friends over and they felt the same way too. Well worth buying the 6 pack of Guinness. Was surprised about using chicken broth but it worked.

!/2 the recipe, since I only had 1lb of beef.
My husband and I both liked it. I would add more carrots personally. Did not use sugar (more carrots would replace that), used my sons' dark homebrew.

I made this a few times now. I totally agreed with one reviewer that the chicken stock is the best. The first time I made it, I changed it to beef stock thinking that would go better with the meat. The flavor of the beef was so overwhelming, I no longer tasted the stout. The chicken stock was perfect. I also omitted the sugar in one of the attempts. I like it much better with it.  Try this recipe as written, you'll be happy you did. Thanks, Chef John, for sharing another great recipe.
 Third time -  I did not have Guinness on hand, tried it anyway with a Scottish stout, I dredged the meat in flour/salt & pepper before browning. It thickened the stew lightly and gave it a perfect consistency to go with my soda bread. Great recipe.

I hate beer, I hate bacon, I'm not too fond of Thyme - I LOVE this recipe!!!  It's a very complex blend of flavors in a good, hardy way.  I follow the recipe to the letter.  I do think that the type of beer you use can probably make or break this recipe.  Always use a good quality dark beer.  

Oh, and if you were wondering, I made it in the first place because I thought my husband would like it.  He does!

As a rule I HATE beef stew where everything tastes like boiled meat - potatoes, carrots, even onions, bland, bland, bland.   THIS on the other hand is divine!  The beer and tomato paste are the key to a rich and flavorful sauce.  The two hours ensure the meat is tender and infused.   The mashed potatoes are a must!

This is my second time making it and we, me and my husband, loved it! I was worried that the soup might be bitter, but it turned out very nice after 2 hours of simmering. 
Last time I didn't make much, so there was no leftover. This time I am making 6 portions to have some leftover and will see how it will taste.

Great recipe but the first time I made it I couldn’t find Guinness beer so I bought Ricard’s Red.  It was absolutely delicious so I made it that way again.  The third time I thought I should try it the way it was written, with Guinness.  We were disappointed and went back to using the Richard’s.   I also added some flour to the liquid at the end to thicken it a bit.   Otherwise I made it as written.  If you like this recipe try it with with Ricard’s Red.

My family loved this!  I had to subsitute tomato sauce for the paste (kept the same measurement), increased the carrot and celery to 4 each and added 4 russet potatoes cut in quarters .  I was happy I was able to buy a single Guiness at the grocery store  to make it authenic!  It is tasty recipe!

I meant to add this earlier but pressed done by accident. Part of what i love about stew is how easy it is to make. For that reason i turned this into a one pot stew. Still great that way. Cook meat first as instructed but then just throw everything else in and simmer. Slow cooker works fine too. 4 stars instead of five just for the overcomplication.

Having been to Ireland three times, I've tasted Guinness beef stew several times. This recipe is a winner because it has the potatoes mashed and made separately like most places you find in Ireland. I left out the tomato paste and used one part beef stock and one part chicken stock instead to enrich the beef flavor. It was delish!

This has marvelous flavor!  I made minor changes:  browned the meat in a pan, then added to crock pot.  Eliminated tomato paste and sugar.  Followed remaining directions and cooked on low 6 hours.  About 1 hour before done, I removed 3/4 c of juice and let cool, then added 4-5 T flour.   Whisked the juice and flour and added to the crock pot.  Mixed well and let simmer the last hour.  Served with wide egg noodles.  Delish!  My son-in-law had 3 servings!!  Everyone else had at least 2.

My family raved about this recipe. Chef John always comes up with a technique to that makes his dishes better than traditional ways of preparation. Stewing the meat the entire two hours plus the extra 15 minutes at the end definitely tenderizes a cut of meat that I usually do not prefer to eat.

Followed recipe but omitted the sugar and threw in fresh mushrooms.  This was good over mashed potatoes but not my favorite version of Guinness Stew.  Next time I'll use one pot for the bacon, then onion and finally the beef!  And brown it in one large piece rather than cutting up first.

I made a double batch, with no changes except maybe a couple extra slices of bacon.  This stew has a good flavor.  When I sautéed the meat in the bacon drippings,  there was really a lot of liquid.  But I followed the rest of the recipe as written, and the result was a thin gravy.  I just thickened it a bit with cornstarch and water and it was fine.  I'm trying low carbs, so while my husband had his over mashed potatoes, I had mine over mashed cauliflower.  It was great.

I’ve made this twice now, following the recipe closely but using a crockpot and cooking all day. The only problem with this method is the stew is more liquid. Consider transferring it to the stove and reducing. Awesome recipe

I made this for dinner, with very little variation, and it was absolutely delicious. I had some beef pieces in the freezer that I'd been meaning to use for awhile, probably about half the recommended amount in the recipe. That was one deviation. I also added about 2 TBSP Worchestershire sauce, only because I felt like it would be good. It was great, but I think it would have been equally wonderful without my 2 changes.

Loved it! My easy crockpot rendition turned out amazing: Add pre-cut stew beef to crockpot and rub/mix with thyme, salt and pepper. Saute onion, garlic and cut carrots in butter on stove. Cook bacon in separate pan on stove. Mix sauted veggies, bacon and drippings into crockpot. Pour Stout over meat and veggies (we used White Russian Imperial Milk Stout from  Pipeworks Brewing Co because we had it on hand). Add vegetable stock to cover or to desired consistency. Cook on low 2 hours, then high for 1.5/2 more. I served with a blend of mashed potatoes and mashed cauliflower w/garlic.

A great recipe, as is or starting spot for your own version.  Came out yummy and savory as promised.
One hint: Mine didn't quite thicken up like it was supposed to.  So don't add any more liquid than you need to.  

Mmmm.  Yummy!

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and the meat turned out so tender! I was very pleased. The timing was right, I only cooked it for 2 hours in my Dutch oven and the meat was nice and tender. I served it over leftover mashed potatoes from Thanksgiving. Definitely a keeper!

I doubled the carrots and celery, which forced me to add way more broth...which made the sauce watery. This was still delicious, but would have been amazing if I followed the recipe. Next time I will cook at least some of the carrots separately and add them at the end.

A very good comfort meal and will be on the family menu from now on.  I added a bit of arrow root to thicken it up at the end and used the chicken bullion.  Poured over garlic mashed potatoes made it even better

Loved this.  I liked the hint of thyme, but not overpowering.   This also has simple ingredients and not too many of them,  which makes it desirable.  My only problem was I could not get the sauce to thicken much.  I added a roux and that helped a bit, but wondered about tapioca?

This was a great recipe with an delicious broth. However, it is more of a soup consistency, rather than the thickness of a stew. I fixed this by mixing a 1/4 cup of flour with 1/4 cup of the stew broth and adding it into the stew 30 mins prior to completion. I also added 1 cup of red wine in place of some of the chicken broth. I added more veggies than suggested as well. With these substitutions and additions it came out so delicious!

Made as directed with exceptions based on what I had on hand, Shock Top instead of Guinness, 1/2 tsp thyme vs sprig and no sugar. Excellent! Will make again and again on those chilly nights.

It was pretty thick and flavorful, and not at all too bitter. The meat came out great, even though it smoked the room up quite a bit while cooking. The portions had a good size, and it was a hearty meal. However, I imagined that it would be a little thicker than it was. The gravy was slightly watery, and I would probably add some flour in while cooking it to thicken it up. But I would definitely make this dish again!

Maybe I messed up somewhere, but this wasn't as flavorful as the rest of the reviews made it out to be. Probably won't be making this again as no one was really impressed by it. On a good note though, it was pretty easy to make!

Wow, what flavor!  Terrific comfort meal for a cold winter day. I’ve made this several times now and everyone loves it. Don’t be afraid to use high heat for browning the meat and the onions (do separately as directed). Medium-high heat leaves too much liquid in the pan. That needs to be reduced down with the high heat to get a thicker, richer base. Also I use a bit less chicken broth. I dont measure it but dont cover everything in the pot. Pour til liquid is maybe an inch below the rest of the contents. More liquids will come out of the veggies so you end up with more liquid than you think. Use a little less at first. You can always add a bit more as you go. Try this. You will love if.

Followed the recipe  but instead of using a Dutch oven on the stove, I finished it in my crockpot.  The gravy was delicious and the meat very tender....didn't even need a knife!

I will make this again!

I love this stew! 
The only mods I make are brown sugar instead of white, double up on the carrots, celery, and bacon. A double sized batch is wise because you run out of stew just when the flavor starts to get good!

Exceptional tasting stew that the whole family LOVES.  I add a little red wine....because that's just me.....but I have made it without and this stew is always a hit.  I have made it several times and have used both beef and chicken broth and I agree the chicken broth is  a little better.  I also triple the recipe so we can have leftovers for a few days.  There are 4 of us.

The main change was that I did not put in the tomato paste or anything with tomato.  I added a few other spices, like bay leaf, and some Worcestershire sauce and put it all into a crockpot .  I did not use the sugar either.

I added some frozen vegetables to the crockpot towards the end - carrots, green beans and peas.  

Very tasty and I made the gravy and served it with noodles.

I've made this twice, loved it, and will make it again. 

Note on the  "2 stalks" of celery.  My celery came in a 1 pound bunch, labeled as "one stalk", and that usage seems common. But I guess Chef John's "stalks" are the 10 to 12 pieces  of the bunch (sometimes called "ribs"). So, just use a few ounces of celery, about the same as the carrots.

Followed the recipe exactly  and turned out super watery more like soup than stew.. had to add cornstarch to thicken. Taste was okay. Was expecting to be better with a 5 star rating.

This was absolutely amazing.  Today my husband was at the microwave and I asked him what he was heating.  His reply "a little bit of gold"!  I'm now forbidden from making any other beef stew.  :) I made it as written and served with horseradish mashed potatoes.  (I believe they were called "Mashed Potato Dream" from this site ... although I didn't have any green onions and used onion powder.) Just so delicious.

Savory and hearty.  A meal perfect with crusty Garlic bread.  A meal to  dress up with your  own favorite vegetables in the recipe or to enjoy as the basic beautiful meal that it is.

Great flavor! I made it as the recipe suggested except I did not have fresh thyme so I added some dried thyme. Next time I will add more carrots and celery and maybe some peas. I like more veggies in my stew.

Made for dinner tonight April 2.  Very, very tasty.  I followed to a "t" and I'm glad.  Very easy and quick to make.  I didn't use quite as much salt as the recipe but I had my son and husband add as they wanted.  I did add a parsnip because I had one on hand.  The meat stayed nice and moist too.  It's a keeper!  Next time I'll make the mashed potatoes but today I didn't have any and I ran out of time.

This was very good.  I have a family member who doesn't eat celery, so I used celery seed instead.  I used fresh carrots from the garden and I also added potatoes to the stew rather than serving it on mash.  We were hoping this would bring u s back to the stew we got at the Guinness factory in Dublin and it wasn't quite there, but it was definitely enjoyable.   Leftovers reheated beautifully and tasted great.

I love Guinness so I had to try this recipe. I cut the recipe in half but used the full amount of bacon (got low sodium kind). I used Guinness Draught and replaced the chicken stock with organic veggie broth, added one cube of beef bullion and extra garlic and carrots. I also used raw sugar instead of white. Turned out amazing! I will definitely make it again.

This was amazing!  We used our dark beer that we make, and I did cook it for an extra hour.. The only change I would make is I would not put the bacon in the stew because it gets too soggy... but I do fry it so that I have the bacon grease to cook the stew meat, onions..etc  Enjoy!

This was yummy!  I did dredge the beef in flour, salt and pepper before browning, used turkey bacon, and cooked all in the crock pot for the day. The meat was tender and the gravy was yummy. I thickened the gravy with a flour slurry the last 30 minutes. Next time, I'll use 2 1/2 to 3 pounds of stew meat, add lots more carrots, toss in some peas, and add diced potatoes instead of serving over mashed potatoes. This would also be awesome substituting pearl onions for the chopped onions. My family prefers stew over egg noodles.

Delicious even though I made it without celery or thyme, plus I only had light beer on hand.  I threw in some potatoes.  I will make this again for sure!

This stew was delicious. I made it for a family get together and everyone loved it. I doubled the recipe and thickened it the last fifteen minutes. I also simmered it in a crockpot overnight. Will be making this again.

This stew has great flavor! I used a pinch of dried thyme instead of sprigs, and only half a can of Guinness . The flavor was a little too intense for my ten-year-old, but my husband really loved it. The beef was super tender! Next time I would add potatoes to the stew instead of serving it over mashed potatoes. It was a little soupy for our taste.

I made this for the first time and although I made minor modifications I would say the recipe is good as is!  First I was a bit uneasy about just carrots and wondered how well serving it over potatoes would go over with my guests so I added a few potatoes to the stew and also made mashed potatoes.  I don't think it took away from the stew at all.  Some ate as a soup and some ate over potatoes and all loved it!  Next I didn't have any thyme but it was fine without.  I added a little more salt.  Those are all of the modifications I made.  I want to add I was a little skeptical about using chicken broth but it turned out great!  The bacon also added such a nice smoky flavor and truth be told I personally don't like too much of a smoke flavor but it was perfect!!  I made this recipe to be served as an alternative to the boiled dinner for our St. Patrick's Day family gathering but I would definitely make this more than once a year!

I made this for a St Patrick's dinner and it was delicious!!!  Everyone raved about it.  I made green mashed potatoes and arranged it in a ring in serving bowl as suggested with stew in middle.  The flavor of this stew is so deep and rich,  I can't say enough about it.  The only minor change I made was to stir some cornstarch mixed with water into the stew for the last 15 minutes.  It thickened the gravy just a bit more making it perfect texture.  I will make this one again.  Guinness beer really contributed to the depth of flavor so I recommend keeping that as a critical ingredient.

This was very delicious. The only change that I made was to add chopped prunes to this recipe in the last hour.  I doubled this recipe  (we had a lot of friends coming over) and added a cup of chopped prunes to the stew. Big Hit!!!

This will go in my "Make again soon file".  Everything I've made from a Chef John recipe has turned out really good. My family even loved it too (and they are PICKY).  Served over garlic mash potatoes.  I didn't have celery, or thyme, so I used dried oregano and cayenne pepper, and cooked in my Dutch Oven.  The only thing I wish I would of added was mushrooms.

Very flavorful stew. I did not add sugar; or the bacon, because I would not like the texture of the bacon in the stew. I used larger cuts of rib eye beef to make it more rustic. Also, the beef could then be selectively eaten as preferred. Separately on the plate was colcannon (Yukon Gold potatoes(peeled), green cabbage and shallots together in a medium mash.

I am not a fan of beef stew but family is. I have made many different beef stew recipients. This by far favorite. This was so flavorful and balanced!! The  broth was not to thick or too thin. Meet tender. I did not have Guinness in hand but did have a craft beer so used that instead. Son felt too I used too much thyme. May have since I tend to eyeball amounts. Added peas at end as well. Leftover just as delicious. Served w fresh bakery bread. Thank you!

This recipe reminds me very much of the delicious beef stews my husband and I have had in Pub's in Ireland on our travels. It has a rich hearty taste .  The potatoes are a must but also excellent with a hearty bread.  My husband asks for this all the time. I can't make it often enough to suit him !

This was an awesome recipe and it really was easy --for a stew.
I will definitely make it again.  My husband said it was the best stew I have ever made and we have been married for 50 years!

Yes. This is it for me. After years of trying recipes I've found my stew. Thank you! Followed exactly but used chicken bone broth. Excellent.

I made this in my Instant Pot and it was great!  I followed the directions up through step 3.  I put everything in my Instant Pot and set on Stew setting (35 min) and quick released.  Served over mashed potatoes. It was a hit!

I made this exactly as the recipe says and it was received very well. I used the left over to make a beef pot pie which was also well received. I'd definitely make it again.

Wow, what a great recipe!  I'm making it for the second time at my husband's request. I made it exactly per the directions.  The only thing I changed was making it in a cast iron Dutch oven at 250F for three hours.  Served with Irish champs as another reviewer suggested, it's mashed potatoes with green onion & butter. YUM!  Thanks so much for the recipe.

This is my 4th attempt at a review for this recipe and so I'm going to make this one short and sweet. I very much dislike the design of the review part of the app. I've prematurely submitted several reviews for this recipe. Ugh.                                                   Anyways, this recipe rocks. I used Diesel Punk stout beer and dredged the beef with flour, salt and pepper (all done in a ziplock bag). I used 1 pot from start to finish. Cooked the bacon, removed, cooked the beef, removed (added the beef to the bacon I had in a bowl on the side), cooked the onion and then added back the bacon/beef, and the rest of the ingredients, and cooked until done. Served over mashed potatoes. SO GOOD!

Made exactly per the recipe and it turned out absolutely delicious! As advised, I made some lightly seasoned mashed potatoes and served the stew on top. Took it in for lunch the following day and everything reheated nicely. Will make again.

I have made this recipe several times.  it is good with beer or a good red wine. I've made it with mashed potatoes and with mashed Cauliflower  both are excellent choices. This is versatile stew. I've made it with your basic veggies as well as adding mushrooms  broccoli kale and tomatoes. I will say this I always omit the thyme I don't care for the taste of it (I think it makes it bitter and tastes literally like dirt)

Really delicious!  Such a good comfort food.  I made the recipe as indicated, but I did follow the suggestion to use one pot, which I found worked well.  I also added a little Worcestershire sauce and didn't have fresh thyme, so I used dried, but it didn't seem to make much difference.  I will definitely make again!

I make a lot of stews. This was freaking awesome. Added about 12 whole Bella mushrooms. Served it in a bowl of whipped potatoes, and got rave reviews. Definitely a keeper recipe. Thanks soooo much!

Great base recipe for a flavorful stew. My adjustments included adding more beef chunks. About 3 lbs total. I also hit the meat with some cayenne pepper ahead of searing for a little kick. Less sugar. More garlic. 6 cloves total. I added just a little extra chicken stock because instead of mashed potatoes for my starch, I cut thick slices of French bread to soak up the gravy. My guests actually made an open faced stew sandwich! French bread is absolutely the best way to enjoy this dish. I'll be making this again.

Good recipe.  Slight variations:
- 1 beef bullion cube (added much more flavor compared to first time I made this)
- added small diced potatoes instead of mashed which necessitates adding more chicken stock and/or water depending on how salty you want to go
- cooked in slow cooker - high for 1.5 hrs, then low for another 2 hrs.  Probably needed another 2 hours to get beef and carrots to fully tender.  Think next time will go with high for 2.5 hrs and back to low for another 1.5 hrs.

Very very good! The only thing I will do different is omit the tomato paste , I found it gave it a bit of acidic taste and I had to add a little baking soda to help. Might have been just my personal preference there. But after my tweak it was wonderful !

Wow! Just...wow!!! Best stew I've had in my 40 years. The hubby loved, the 12 year old and 14 year old loved it. I made it three times in three weeks because the family kept asking for it. I did watch the video before I made it as well. The video was very helpful. I followed exactly the first two times. The third time, I added more veggies which did seem to thin it out a bit with the extra liquid but I just thickened it with some starch. Like most soups/stews this is even better the next day....if you can wait that long. Reheats well in a microwave.

Certainly one of the better stews I've made. Hubby said it was better than his (I agree). I did add turnip and mushrooms since I cannot imagine stew without them. I  Also added about 4 cups of diced potatoes since I didn't want to be bothered cooking them separately although I think mashed potatoes would be good if not better. I thickened it w/corn starch after 2 hours.

I made this recipe for six, and since there are only two of us, I put a quart in the freezer, and about 2/3 quart in the refrigerator for lunch the next day.  
Empirical observation, since I ate the 2/3 quart completely, is that letting it set in the fridge a day makes it even better!

I followed Chef John's recipe, and it was delicious! I didn't have any tomato paste on hand, but Google said I could sub with tomato sauce (doubling the amount, and then reducing "other" liquids).  I also didn't have fresh thyme, so I used dried and was generous with it (about 3 tablespoons).  The meat ended up super tender, and SO much better tasting than a traditional oven roast.  We like a thicker stew, so in the end during the high re-heat process of the recipe, I mixed about 4 tablespoons of corn starch with a small bit of water and stirred that into the stew and boiled for a couple of minutes.  I ended up with a perfect gravy and we served it all over mashed potatoes.  This recipe is a keeper.

So amazingly delicious.  Well worth the time, and not much hassle!  Next time I'm going to add baby portabellas at the onion stage cause we love them, but otherwise, this is a perfect winter recipe.

Instead of cooking on the stove for two hours, I put it the crockpot for four hours!  I also added dumplings for the last 20 minutes. This helped to thicken the stew. It was delicious!

This was awesome! The whole family loved it. It's only been 2 weeks and already going to make it again this weekend. I didn't have Guinness so I just used a bottle of amber beer that I had. Thanks for a great recipe!

Hands down the best beef stew I have ever had!  My husband agrees that this recipe rivals our favorite at a local restaurant. I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I was worried about the sauce not thickening but it did just as it should in the last 20 minutes of boiling.  Wish I had doubled it!

This is an excellent recipe, in my opinion. I did make a couple of changes though, hence the 4-stars instead of 5. I  sprinkled about 1/8 c. of flour onto the meat after it was browned, gave it all a stir to coat, and let the meat cook in the pan for about another minute. I found the sauce to be too liquid for a stew, so I decided to thicken it this way. After adding the onions and garlic  to the pan after the meat was removed, I cooked them longer than the instructions said, until they had a nice brown caramelization to them.  I also added 2 T. worchestershire sauce to the seasonings for more depth of flavor. And rather than serving over mashed potatoes, I cubed 3 medium sized potatoes and just added them to the cooking process. I like my potatoes IN my stew, not under it.

I used only one pot: rendered the bacon-removed it; dredged 3.75 lbs. beef in flour (with salt and pepper) browned it-removed it; cooked the onions and garlic; deglazed with Guiness;

It was my first beef stew ever and since my husband loves Guinness beer I decided to go with this recipe! It was amazing! I added potatoes to the stew and made it in my crock pot on high for 6h. I browned the meat beforehand with onions and beer! I also used beef broth as that was what I had in the kitchen! It turned out very tender and full of flavor! My husband loved it!

This was delicious. I added a little anchovy paste, used dried thyme, and thickened it with a bit of cornstarch, but those were my only changes. I served it over garlic mashed roasted cauliflower. This combo will be a fall/winter standard.

I mostly followed the recipe but I did add a little Montreal steak spice to the beef before braising and used beef instead of chicken broth. Delicious!

Wow, this came out way better than we even expected! Was looking for a good stew recipe to use leftover pot roast that we never enjoy simply reheated. Turns out we stumbled upon one of the best dishes we've ever made! Invited family over for dinner and thought we'd still have some left for the next night - nope! Everyone went for second or third helpings until there was nothing left. Truly delicious.

The flavor of this stew is really good.  I used stew beef as others did. It was fine, but I think it would be better with the suggested cut. I added a little cornstarch and water at the end to thicken it up a little.  Definitely don't forget the mashed potatoes.

This was so YUMMY! I made this with "Sweet tooth, salted caramel dark Belgium beer." I also added a couple sprigs of rosemary, and a bay leaf. The chicken stock I used was homemade, from a soup I made previously.  I used an electric skillet instead of a stove top skillet. Other than that, I followed the recipe. I served it over butter and herb mashed potatoes. It was so good. My 10 year old twins, and boyfriend loved it!

Wow! This was so delicious. The flavors were amazing. I also used only one pot. After the bacon was browned, I added in all of the carrots, onion, and celery. I cooked it for another 5 minutes with the bacon, and then added the garlic and cooked for another couple of minutes. I dumped all of that in a bowl, and then cooked the cut up stew meat in the pot. Once that was browned, I then added the veggies and bacon back to the pot and finished following the rest of the directions. After simmering the stew for 2 hours, I fished out the thyme sprigs and brought the stew it to a boil on medium high. I boiled it for 15 minutes. stirring every few minutes. This is what thickened it. I didn't have to add any extra flour to thicken it. I pulled it off the burner and let it rest for about 5 minutes, stirred it, and served it over homemade garlic mashed potatoes. WOW. I'll be making this all winter long! Thanks Chef John!!

Excellent! Was getting worried how it would turn out, needed to thicken a lil bit, used corn starch. Very flavorful, next time I'll add more bacon. All bowls were licked clean. You must serve on top of mashed potatoes, steps it up to a whole different level!!! Make sure you use Guinness

This is by far the BEST beef stew I've ever tasted! The bacon and stout combine to make the richest, tastiest gravy ever. I made this exactly as written except that I only had 2 potatoes on hand so I cut them up and added them to the stew rather than making mashed potatoes to serve the stew over. But next time I'll serve the stew with mashers as I can imagine the gravy is awesome over them!

Served over very garlic-y mashed potatoes, this was wonderful! On it's own, I'd definitely add more garlic, salt and pepper though. I cooked the bacon, beef, onions & garlic - used the beer to de-glaze the pan - and then poured everything into my crock pot on the lowest setting for 8 hours. The beef was tender, the carrots were cooked through, but not mushy. A+ for easiness, that's for sure!

This was delicious! I followed the instructions-- but I let it simmer on the stove for 3 to 4 hours since I had made it earlier in the day. I use the whole 6 ounce can of tomato paste so that it wouldn't go to waste. The stew meat came in 1 1/3 pound packages, and I only bought one and used it all.  I thought this recipe was tastier than my old standby hunter's stew, so this will be the recipe I will use from now on.

This was really good!  I ended up making it on the stove and the beef was dry and chewy.  The next day I added it to the crock pot for a couple hours and problem solved.  FYI I had 2.33lbs of beef and had to use 32oz of broth, so plan for a little extra beer and seasoning if you also use 32oz.  I also had to add 4 Tbsp. of corn starch to thicken once all cooked.  I ate mine over mashed potatoes and my husband ate his over white rice.  I will be making this again soon, but only in the crock pot.

So much better than any other beef stew I've made, rich and delicious...I don't know if the little added bacon or the Guinness...whatever it is, this is a HIT!

I normally don't like stew - but this was superb!  I used stew beef instead of cutting up what the recipe called for.  It was rich and hearty and delicious.  Next time I'll leave out the carrots - we don't care for them but wanted to keep the recipe as written.  I used Guiness Extra Stout, and we poured the stew over the mashed potatoes.  The leftovers were even better - I wouldn't change anything!

My go to recipe! The only changes I made due to personal preference is no sugar and beef stock in place of the chicken broth. I always make with Irish soda bread also on this site. Best stew I've had!

Made it almost as is. The only changes I made other than using dried thyme (what i had on hand) were quantities, in that I doubled everything except the beef and onions and celery because we love carrots and like our stew extra saucy. Instead of mashed potatoes, I made cheddar garlic biscuits to soak up every drop of this delicious stew. This is my go to recipe for beef stew meat.

Really enjoyed this stew. Based on another reviewer's comments, I added the celery about halfway thru and this worked out nicely. When I make it again, I will add another carrot & a stalk or two more of celery. The recipe produces a good amount of gravy which I thickened with a butter-flour paste about ten minutes before serving with mashed potatoes. This is a definite keeper!

I used a medium ale I had on hand and it was still fabulous!  My entire family loved it!  I cut some canned biscuits up and cooked them in the pot the last 30 minutes for dumplings.  I had to add a little extra chicken broth to off set the biscuit dumplings but my family is already asking for it again!

I made with my daughter in a country where the beef is super tough, so it ended up simmering for 6 hours.  The flavor was superb, but the beef was still not tender (but edible).  This time I am simmering the beef and brother for five  hours first, and then I will add the vegetables two hours before mealtime.  We really enjoyed this, although it is a challenge to find celery, and of course we have to substitute the beer.  (:  We are keeping this recipe in our files and will fiddle with it to apply to high altitude/tough beef.  I may have to get a pressure cooker.

Absolutely delicious. Will definitely do again. I stuck to the recipe almost exactly. I omitted onions since we don't care for them and added mushrooms since we love them. We ate it with rice and it was fantastic.

I did not change the recipe at all and it was FANTASTIC! My son who doesn't even like any stew had 2 helpings of it.

Great and easy recipe. Just make sure you remove all the connective tissue from the chuck roast otherwise he meat will be chewy.

Very impressed with this dish! The wife does not like a heavy meal, therefore this was a challenge. After reading reviews, I decided to go by the recipe. I dont know the  chicken broth does lighten it up over the beef broth, but the flavor was spot on. This dish would be great over rice too. We certainly have enough for lleftovers. I can see this one being a family "go to" recipe.

I've been looking for a beef stew recipe using Guinness and this one was not only easy to make but my family loved it. I thought we would have it left over but they devoured it. 

Instead of using mashed potatoes, I put red potatoes in the stew and served it with a warm and crusty sourdough bread.

Great recipe! I was in Ireland a few years ago and had the Guinness beef stew at the Guinness restaurant. It tastes about the same. Loving using Guinness with beef. Adds great flavor and if using on a pot roast it makes excellent gravy!

We enjoyed this stew served over egg noodles. I used 1/4 tsp dried thyme for the fresh as I didn't have any, reduced salt to 1/2 tsp total as I am on a low sodium diet, doubled onions, used Beef Herbox for the chicken stock and added a 750 g bag of frozen peas. Instead of simmering on the stove, I placed it in the oven at 250 degrees for 6 hours. Next time I would use 2 cans of Guinness and less beef stock. Really liked the bacon undertone.

Made this stew exactly as  recommended. The mashed potatoes (homemade, of course) was an excellent suggestion. This recipe is a definite keeper.

I LOVE this recipe!  Just a couple of tweaks for my own ease.  I used beef broth instead of chicken stock because I had it on hand.  Also, instead of putting this in a stew pot, I threw it all in a crockpot on low for 6 hours, adding small cubes of potatoes so I didn't have to make mashed potatoes later.  It is rich and delicious and super easy to put together.

Delicious! We had mystery meat from the freezer that had a little freezer burn. I used beef stock instead of chicken stock since I wanted a deeper flavor and I added a couple of dashes of worshteshire sauce. It was so good, my son went back for thirds. Served it with mashed potatoes, a must. Thank you for such a great recipe.

Almost perfect!  I love that this did not have any flour in it (well other than the wheat from the beer).   I don't have ciliacs but I do have a slight allergy to wheat and have cut wheat/flour/gluten out of my diet completely.  
> At the end, had to add a touch more sugar and apple cider vinegar.  Just felt like there was some "depth" missing =( 
That's just my opinion, but I am sure this will come out great if you don't do anything to it.  Happy cooking !

This was a huge hit! Different from your traditional beef stew, great comfort dish! I followed the recipe exactly and took the tip of using a mashed potato ring. This really is a 5 star recipe!

This recipe is a keeper followed the basic recipe idea mixed a couple of things around (I don't measure). The meat itself turned out very tender cooked it for an hour extra just because. Will make again... And again... And again.

When I make a recipe, I change absolutely nothing about it. I want to taste it based on how it is originally prepared. And I love this stew to no end. Not a fan of Guinness for drinking but it gives this stew a wonderful rich flavor. Even with a five star rating I'm not big on the bacon, so next time I will simply omit it. Thank you for sharing this.

Flavorful & tender - similar to Beef Bourguignon (beer instead of red wine). Without the addition of flour at the end, there's a Lot of liquid - almost a soup.  I doubled the celery, carrots & used big onions - could have added even more. I'm planning on sauteing some mushrooms & tossing them into the pot of leftovers.

LOVED this recipe!  The only thing I did differently is I dumped everything into a crock pot and let it cook on low for 7 hours to make sure the meat was tender.  Perfection!!!  It's not often I keep a recipe but this is for sure a keeper.  Even better the second day!

I made this stew for a St. Patrick's Day party that I serve only Irish food. This turned out very good and was a huge hit. I personally thought it could have a little bit more spice, but I followed the recipe exactly and served it that way. I did have to thicken up the stew just a little bit with Wondra (like flour). I cooked the stew on the stove as directed and then transferred it to a crock pot on warm for the rest of the party. I give it four stars just because I think it was lacking some spice, but I'm not sure exactly what.

This was a very good stew! Used beef broth instead of chicken, and omitted the sugar. I added cornstarch to help thicken it. I will definitely make this again.

This was fantastic!! I made a few modifications - added mushrooms ('cause everything tastes better with mushrooms,)  and bay leaf and celery leaves (I'm big on herbs for flavor.) I added the tomato paste to the liquid before adding to pot, because it just made sense to me. Used Chuck roast but will try a leaner cut next time just because I'm calorie conscious.

I was pressed for time and so I combined some of the steps and only used one pot, and used already-cooked bacon and dried thyme (I didn't have fresh).  My incredibly picky husband loved it!  I cooked the beef, onions, garlic and generous salt together.  Then I drained and let rest while I browned the bacon.  I removed the bacon and poured the Guinness into the pot and let it do a quick boil before I added the beef, bacon and remaining ingredients.  I was generous with the tomato paste, salt and the sugar...and glad I was.  Next time, I will not use pre-cooked bacon since I think cooking it will add a savory note to the stew that it could use.  But even though I only let simmer for 1.5 hours as well as cut some corners, it turned out wonderful!

My family and I LOVED this delicious stew. Will definitely keep this recipe around and will make again. My husband said, "Can you make this every night?" 
The only change I made was that I used beef broth instead of chicken broth because that was all that I had on hand. I didn't add any extra salt to the onions when I was sautéing them. I only seasoned the meat before I seared it in the pan. It came out perfect! Not too salty, nor under seasoned.

I dredged the beef lightly with flour and switched out the chicken stock with my own beef stock.  I also added rosemary and crushed red pepper flakes and 86'd the sugar.  After it simmered for 2 hours I didn't need to bring it up to a boil, I'm guessing because the flour thickened it up.  The flavor was awesome, so rich and hearty.  My whole family loved it.

This is a huge hit every time I make it.  I have made it with chicken broth once, and beef broth another time.  I have to say I prefer the beef broth. Other than that, it's pretty much perfect.

I rarely give anything 5 stars but this recipe was a huge crowd pleaser in an Irish family.  Slight modifications, I added cubed parsnips and a cornstarch slurry at the end to thicken the broth.  Thought we'd have leftovers, no such luck!

I made this for a Heritage Potluck at work, and followed the recipe exactly. Served it with Colcannon and it was a huge hit! A beautiful, rich, thick and hearty stew. My husband loved it too and he's quite picky.  Can't think of anything I'd change about this dish. Perfect comfort food.

This was so easy to put together and I ended up cooking it in the crockpot after all the skillet work.  Cooked the meat first for 2 hours on high, then added the celery and carrots for the last 2 hours on high.  Came out great and the meat was really tender.  It was perfect over mashed potatoes.  The family and my guests were raving about it.   This one's a keeper for me.

This is an amazing stew! Extra delicious! I used 7 slices of bacon. I sautéed green onions in addition to regular onion as I did not have enough on hand, and sautéed the celery and some  of the carrots with it. I added cubed potatoes and pumpkin and additional carrots during the last half  hour of cooking before reducing the liquid. It reduces down nicely to the perfect thickness. The flavour of this stew is drool-worthy! This recipe is a keeper!

This is meaty and hearty. In hindsight I probably wouldve added chopped cabbage. I made the recipe mostly exactly except no beer, I used beef broth, I had no tomato paste, so I cooked the tomato sauce until it thickened, and I did add 2 TBS flour at the end to thicken it more. Otherwise, it smelled amazing and taste amazing. Very soothing meal.

I just  finished a  pot of this  stew,  I've made it before, love  it.  This  is  for  the  family members  who are  coming  to dinner  Sunday and may not  like  the pork roasts I'm  fixing. My wife liked the stew more this time, she had me put the potatoes in the stew and add extra carrots. It is rather sweet, the way she likes her food. She said the grandkids may have to order a pizza  if it looked like they were going to eat all the stew, she definitely wants some leftover for next week.  I added a beurre mani'e to thicken.

Absolutely delicious! I added potatoes this time but am going to try the "mashed potato ring" next time.  I'm sure both methods are sensational!

Looking for a savory dish......try this one. Huge hit at a dinner party. I added butter, whole milk, garlic and fresh dill to the mashed potatoes. Gorgeous presentation with the potatoes lining the bowl. Thank you Chef John! I'm a fan.

This recipe was yummy! The whole family liked it. I didn't have any bacon or celery on hand, but otherwise I followed the recipe. It took longer than 2 hours to break down the beef. The family didn't mind since it was delicious. I will make it again!

Like the previous reviewer, I omitted the sugar (I forgot) but I added Worcestershire sauce. This recipe creates a wonderful, deeply complex flavor that was irresistible.

Excellent. Best homemade stew I ever made. The only change I made was to put cubed potatoes in the stew about 30 minutes before it was done. That required also adding another 1 1/2 cups of stock. I'll definitely make this again.

Fantastic meal, we added a dash of Worcester sauce, a half glass of red wine and a little cornflour to thicken. Used feathered beef which added real depth of flavour. 
Such an amazing meal, even the dog could not resist and stole a little when we put a plate down to feed the fire!!!

Fantastic!  Modifications:  after cooking onions & garlic, I seared the carrots & celery as well.  I did not add sugar, and used beef broth instead of chicken.  Added a few rosemary stems.  Used a can of diced tomatoes (mostly drained) instead of tomato paste.  Instead of serving over mashed potatoes, I added diced potatoes in the final 20 minutes of simmering.  Served with rosemary bread.  Fantastic!

Delicious! I had to make a couple of changes to use some leftovers but basically stuck to the plan. This is to become one of our winter favorites! I used leftover flank steak and my mashed potatoes also contained mashed cauliflower. Yummy!

This recipe is awesome. I usually follow a recipe as written at least for the first time I make it, but I did tweak it a little. I  have one kid who hates mashed potatoes, so I added 4 diced russet potatoes when I added the celery & carrots. I also used dried thyme leaves, not quite a tablespoon, in place of the thyme sprigs because I didn't have them on hand. The changes worked fine. In fact, this stew is amazing, very flavorful.

super delicious. i had to add corn starch to thicken. i wonder how using beef broth versus chicken stock would change flavor? and maybe not use the thyme? not sure. regardless, very tasty and even better the next day

I've made this twice.  The first time, I followed the recipe exactly, (except I cannot eat onions, so omitted) and it was absolutely amazing.  The second time, I was pressed for time, and cooked it for only about 1 hour.  There was a huge difference!!  I personally think mashed potatoes is going way overboard on such a hearty stew, but that is my preference.  I served with crusty bread.  Will definitely put in the winter month rotation.

Mine ended up colored orange. I used Japanese beer and placed beef broth instead of chicken broth. I also put pig intestine. I believe the taste improved after a day or two.

I have made this a lot, crave it actually on a cold day.  The entire family devours it.  I've served it to company as well to rave reviews.  Assorted changes:  of course I add way more bacon!!!!  I've used, stew meat, roast or steak on sale, just lean beef is all it requires.  Today I confused with another recipe and floured the beef with pepper and dried thyme prior to browning.  I use my Dutch oven for all of it.  Not two pots.  Bacon first, bacon to a bowl, brown beef in bacon fat, move to a plate, then the onions and garlic but by this time I need a pat of butter to get it going.  The beer will assist in getting the bottom of the Dutch oven completely clean of bacon drippings.  I typically use dried thyme as rarely have fresh on hand.  My favorite beef stew!!!!  We serve over mashed potatoes.

This beef stew is an outstanding recipe!  I used tomato paste instead of puree, and included potatoes to the recipe. The Guinness added a hearty and robust flavor. Delicious!! A wintertime classic that I'm  making again today! 
Happy New Year!

This recipe has a delicious flavor to it once complete. I wasn't feeling up to making mashed potatoes, so I threw a package of mini potatoes right into the stew. It came out wonderfully. Delicious, will definitely make again.

Fantastic as written. I like my stew a little thicker and will add some flour Mixtec with chicken broth  towards the end. Rav reviews from all who eat it including kids!

Way better than the Irish restaurant's Guiness stew down the street! I was a little nervous making a brand new recipe for a St. Paddy's party for my neighborhood.  But it turned out great!  We tripled the recipe and it was completely GONE.  I had to hold back eating too much myself.  I'm making it again for New Years Eve tonight!

A rich, earthy flavor like no other beef stew.  I almost made a more popular, but more amateurish recipe on this site.  I'm so glad I went with Chef John's recipe - AMAZING!

Great flavor. Subbed low sodium chicken stock for the regular kind, but kept everything else the same and it was a hit.

Should have 6 stars!! Used Dry red Malbec wine and beef cubes ( I didn't have beer or Chicken cubes). Sprinkled 1 1/2 tbsp flour on beef after browning. Also added 1 1/2 tsp. Sriracha sauce. LOVED IT !!!!!!!!! Will make this often.

This stew was very tasty especially the carrots.  I usually don't care, in fact avoid cooked carrots, but these carrots were actually really good.  The stew had a great flavor and wasn't a pot of mushy goop like some stews.

This is by far the best beef stew recipe I've tried. I ended up adding a little more sugar to balance out the bitterness of the Guiness. My boyfriend was raving about it for hours after!

I used more meat (about an extra pound), and may have used a little more bacon in the beginning. I used more veggies (doubled the carrot and celery it calls for). I added mushrooms (right before the final 20 minute cook time on med-high). I thickened the stew with a bit of roux made from the stew broth and Wondra (flour). 

Besides that, I used the called-for seasoning, herbs, and even the bit of sugar. I used chicken broth, though many comments call for beef broth.

It was delicious. The meat was tender and had great flavor. I was concerned about the meat being tough after only cooking it for 2 hours, but it was excellent. The overall texture, consistency and flavor of the stew was fantastic. I served it side by side with garlic mashed potatoes, and together they were perfect.

I did make the potatoes a little more sticky (didn't use any milk or cream) than I would normally, so that they would hold up to the liquid in the stew better. By themselves they may have been a little dry, but with the stew, they were awesome, and didn't melt.

Chef John does it once again! The only modification that I made was adding a tsp of corn starch  and water at the end of the boiling process. This was so rich and delicious and even better the next day! I predict that I will  be making this a handful more times this winter.

My husband loved this! I could clearly taste the beer and, though not a fan of beer,  this was a good stew. I used the slow cooker and put everything on high for 6 hours.  As suggested by other reviewers, I lightly coated beef cubes with flour, which made for a perfect thickness of the gravy by the end. After frying them for a short time, I also added a bunch of wild mushrooms that I had on hand. I served this with mustard mash and brussel sprouts (see picture).

This was absolutely delicious with a deep, complex flavor. I was surprised it wasn't bitter from the Guinness. The only change I made was to add a tablespoon of corn starch (mixed into some reserved gravy before adding to the dish) to thicken it more to my liking.

Have made it twice now. One of our favorites! Used Black Butte Porter once instead of Guiness and my son in law thought it was better.  Also made it using red wine instead of beer for the gluten intolerant and it was also great.

I've made this twice now. It turned out perfectly both times and was a huge hit with both family and friends. My only change is to  cook the celery along with the onions. I like the flavor of celery better that way. The recipe is simple to follow but is rich in flavor. I will be making this recipe for many years to come.

This was delicious. Add more veggies than it recommends, otherwise it seems a bit thin on the veggies as is. I fed a dinner party of 13 with this recipe (doubled it) and everyone raved about it.

Amazingly rich stew with depth of flavor.  Had mushrooms and green bell pepper on hand, so threw them in.  Made the entire stew in one big dutch oven.  The broth was amazing and I added a little cornstarch slurry to thicken it rather than letting it reduce down to thicken.   That turned it into this wonderful sauce that was incredible over mashed potatoes.

All you could taste was the Guinness - bitter nasty beer. However, underneath that I could tell there was a delicious stew just waiting to be unearthed. The next day, I made it again, this time with beef stock instead of beer. It was to die for. It was a great idea, though, John. I can see a lot of people here liked it so good job. It just don't fly in this Irish family.

I just finished eating this...delicious!!!!!  A few modifications after looking at a bunch of other recipes: I coated the beef cubes in a mixture of salt/pepper/flour. I did not add the bacon back to the stew (I don't like soggy bacon so I kept it for something else I was cooking).  I used beef broth instead of chicken broth and brown sugar instead of white sugar. I cooked it in the over at 350 (instead of on the stovetop) for 2 hours. Served it with dumplings.

I made this stew for lunches and dinner throughout the week and it was fantastic! My husband especially loved it. I highly recommend serving it with the red smashed potatoes (like mashed potatoes, but more clumpy.) The flavor was savory but not over powering and the meat was so tender. Seems like a lot of work but it is worth it. I made it according to the recipe but realized my husband only cut up one onion for me (I have a stronger than usual reaction to cutting onions) and so while everything was stewing away, I sautéed up an extra onion and threw in there... No Worries! Seems like a very forgiving recipe. I didn't change anything from the recipe. Will certainly make this again... and again... and again.

Loved it!!  I used Murphy's Irish Stout instead.  It's a little less bitter than Guiness.  I also added a about 1/4 teaspoon of Baking Soda to lessen the slight bitter after taste!  It was so delicious!!!!  Have recommended it several times already!!

It was so good! I didn't have Guiness, so I used Newcastle. I added a sliced zucchini and served with garlic bread instead of mashed potatoes. Even my finicky kids liked it!

My family loved this stew! I left out one onion, and cooked on high in the crock pot for 3 hours, then used some cornstarch to thicken a bit. Served with sour cream mashed red potatoes, and have enough leftovers for days.

I used a Guiness stout that was a bit too overpowering for this dish, but with that said it was delicious. Next time I will use a lighter beer.

Very nice, great flavor! I followed the recipe exactly first time I made I made it. I've since found that you can cut the salt in half, and substitute a nice brown ale for the Guiness if you wish. We didn't notice a big difference in taste. This now joins our list of favorite dishes

This was FANTABULOUS and is now going in my recipe box..a sacred place.. and becoming a household staple. DON'T dick with the recipe people. It calls for chicken stock for a reason. For those of you claiming it's to rich..it's a stew with Guinness and bacon DUH!

This recipe came out wonderful. I used beef brisket and simmered for 2+ hours. I added summer squash and corn at the end. Served over mashed potatoes- yum. Recipe is going into favorite file.

I made double this recipe so I could freeze some for later. Only problem was, there was not much left to freeze after feeding 4 people, who wanted it a second meal. I was lucky to have a quart left to save for later. This is the best beef stew recipe I have ever found. So rich and hearty, it heals the soul!

This recipe is delicious and super easy to make. I usually double the garlic and the celery, because it's a lot of meat. I serve it over broad noodles instead of mashed potatoes just because.

This was my first time making a beef stew. I seasoned my meat with tony's(I live in Baton Rouge,La. so Tony's goes on everything). I also added more Thyme then what it asked for. I added red potatoes and served over rice instead of Mashed Potatoes. Everyone loved it!!! A excellent recipe

This recipe is amazing, there is absolutely no need to change anything, except add more carrots and more celery like I did.  To take it to the next level, instead of serving over potatoes drop in some dumpling batter into the stew in the last 15 minutes of cooking and don't thicken, the dumplings will thicken the stew up plenty.  Seriously this is the bomb!  This is a huge hit in our household and it gets served at least once a month.

I made this recipe as is with no changes and no substitutions. It had a wonderful, unique flavor, unlike any stew I had ever had or made. One minor complaint, though: the mashed potatoes didn't do it for us. My SO didn't much care for it but really didn't say why (he loved the stew otherwise, however) but for me, the hot stew turned the mashed potatoes into a creamy soup and that was just kinda gross to me. I will certainly make this stew again but next time, I will add chunks of potatoes to cook with it. 4.5 stars, thank you for sharing.

This was a simple but great, filling, hardy stew. We served as suggested with mashed potatoes and loved it. The meat was so incredibly tender, I made this as written and it was delish. We'll definitely be making this one again!

Oh my goodness. I made this today while sitting on my deck  enjoying a cloudless sky and a late April sun.The smell coming through my kitchen deck door about drove me crazy. As always, you did not disappoint. This dish tasted as good as it smelled. 
 Thanks again for making me look like a cooking pro!

I made this yesterday, for St. Paddy's Day, and it was a big hit! It has a ton of flavor. Even the kids liked it! The only thing I added was a few shakes of Worcestershire over the meat once it was in the stew pot. Forget just making this once a year for St. Patrick's Day...I'll be adding this to the regular rotation!

Made this recipe just as written and it was a big hit-even with the youngest grandkids. Used garlic mashed potatoes for the adults and they said that was a nice addition. Will use again, but double the recipe.

This was some of the best beef stew I have had in years. I used everything just the way it said. Another time, I might try putting it the crockpot as I think it should work there too. It thickened up very nicely without the addition of flour or anything. And usually I have to be very careful of tomato paste and tomato sauce as it gives my husband heartburn, but it didn't bother him in this.

I made this tonight for St. Patrick's Day. It was awesome! I used beef broth instead of chicken broth, used a bit of corn starch to make a slurry to thicken the liquid, and I added 1 cup of frozen peas for more color. I am definitely adding this to my go-to comfort food recipes!

Amazing. I used a beef sirloin, because I did not have a roast. Searing and then slow cooking for hours made the meat unbelievably tender and succulent. I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe and I will certainly be making it again!

Yummy and not one complaint from my four boys! I mostly followed Uncle Ernie's steps because it seemed easier to use only one pot. Also, I used maple bacon, which  I was a little nervous about, and I opted not to use sugar. Ended up being just fine!

Made as directed except dredged beef in flour before browning. Thought this was a bit bitter tasting. Won't make again. It was not great, but not horrible either, just o.k.

We  really enjoyed this recipe and will absolutely make it again and again. I accidentally discarded the bacon fat so I used olive oil instead and it still turned out delicious. I bet the bacon grease would have made it even better if that's possible! Highly recommend. We served it over mashed potatoes.
