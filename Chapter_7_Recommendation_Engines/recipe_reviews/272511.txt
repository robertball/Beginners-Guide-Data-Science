Actually my husband made this recipe as it was a busy night. He used chicken instead of veal and followed the directions exactly as written. Saltimbocca mean “jumps in the mouth” and this recipe was ok. This was a basic recipe and was tasty. Different regions of Italy use different recipes and I usually dredge the chicken in flour after  wrapping it with the sage & procuitto then I finish the dish off with a squeeze of lemon juice. This just gives it an extra layer of flavor. Generally this is served over spinach or escarole with a nice piece of crusty bread to sop up the sauce. Overall a good dish.
