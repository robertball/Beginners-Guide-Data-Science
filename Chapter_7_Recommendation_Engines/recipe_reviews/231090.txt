I used white whole wheat.  The dough looked a bit dry, so I added 2 tablespoons more of water. At the "Add" portion of the dough cycle, I tossed in a handful (probably about a quarter cup) of raisins. I will definitely be making these again, and will try sprinkling toppings like sesame or poppy seeds after brushing with the egg white.

I had to add some extra water to this to get my bread machine to stop whining (about 1/3 cup more). I still had a few "hard spots" and would likely start with an extra 1/2 cup of water next time.  As always, homemade bagels made my family ridiculously happy!

This was my second try at bagels, and the first with whole wheat. I don't have a bread machine, so I made these in a stand mixer. The batch size is a little small for the dough hook, so I finished kneading by hand.

I liked the idea of adding gluten instead of mixing the whole wheat flour with bread flour. The result was a nice, whole grain taste and an excellent texture.

I did not use the egg wash, but might try next time as the I prefer a crustier bagel. I may also try boiling them a bit longer to see if that helps to develop a chewier crust.
