We were looking for something easy. This isn't easy for us but folks that know their way around eggs and blenders probably think so. Once we got over that part it went together without a problem. There's no getting around the 4 hours of freezer time (we tried but it was only stiff pudding). BUT once solid this is lime goodness of a very high order! It's super creamy, not overtly lime but a good balance, and marries with the graham cracker crust like it was made in heaven. Oh, for those not in the know like we were, the cream of tartar is chemically necessary (we looked it up). Good recipe. Enjoy!

Best recipe for key lime pie!  It almost matches the original one from 1932.

I've made this pie many times. My husband always requests this for his birthday. The only thing i do differently is make my own graham crust, i double the filling for a deep dish pie plate and make home made whipped cream. Super simple recipe. Try to find key limes. That makes a big difference.

My husband loves the Edward's key lime pie slices from the grocery store, so as a special treat, I wanted to try my hand at making something similar. I knew I wanted a frozen recipe, not a custard-y key lime pie, and this recipe was perfect! I followed it as exactly as possible...I didn't have key limes, so I squeezed the juice from 3 regular limes and used that instead (I read that key limes are more tart, so I used extra lime juice, approx. 1/2 cup). Combined with the no-bake graham cracker crust recipe from this site, this pie was a delicious success!

Seemed time consuming, but was actually easier than I thought. The results provided a light fluffy pie, which I liked better, compared to  another key lime pie with condensed milk, I had also baked.
