We loved the spicy natural sweetness of this recipe as a desert. It was not very sweet or rich but had a pleasant and satisfying taste. A great way to end a meal! I will definitely make this again.

This was a surprising blend of flavors in our mouths and was yummy fresh out of the oven. If I decide to try this one again I would omit the oranges as the texture is a bit funny and replace with more apples or maybe pears. The recipe didn't "re-warm" well.

Went great with the maple roast turkey and ham we made for Thanksgiving. Guests asked for recipe. I highly recommend it.

I made this last night for family dinner. It was delicious! Made a few changes...used only apples and did not dice them ( made them in medium slices). Also used less brown sugar and added ginger. We had as a side dish kids also loved it and my mom asked me to make for Thanksgiving... Highly recom mend

Changed to Paleo. Replaced artificial creamer with coconut milk. Replaced flour with almond flour. Replaced brown sugar with a drizzle of maple syrup. Replaced crackers with mix of almond and tapioca flour. Added raisins
