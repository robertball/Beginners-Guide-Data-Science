These turned out far better than I had anticipated. Zucchini holds so much moisture that I expected them to be soggy but they actually came out of the oven very crisp. The one bad thing is that they don't hold their crispness for long so you've got to move fast. I served ranch dressing on the side for dipping but they really don't need anything.

Well this was a hit!! I followed the recipe as listed and it turned out awesome. Super delicious...you can’t eat just one. Added a side of marinara sauce for dipping but totally not needed. Will definitely make this one again!!

My zucchini got spiralized so I made this with eggplant. Delicious. I will make it again, maybe a mix of zucchini and eggplant

I made these for a side-dish, but...when they came  out of the oven - they were GONE in minutes!  So, I guess they became the appetizer.    I couldn't get the cheese mixture to stick to the zucchini well after dipping in the egg, so  just sprinkled the cheese mix over the sticks before baking.  they came out pretty good, and the cheese was melted all along the baking sheet, which was tasty too.

We made the recipe as stated but wasn't sure what was in the herb mix so we used McCormick's Mediterranean Herb Seasoning Mix.  It was a big hit!  Will definitely make it again.

Great way to use up zucchini. I assumed "herb mix" was italian seasoning. I was in a hurry, so I guesstimated all the measurements. This was a side for burgers, so I cooked them, on a cookie sheet with a silcone mat, on the grill. I tried to keep it around 425. I flipped when the bottom side was brown (about 20 min because my temp kept dropping) and cooked them about 15 min more.  My 8 year old said he liked part of it, but didn't like the zucchini, lol. Hubs and I enjoyed these fries.

I made it according to the recipe.  Coating was nice.  Zucchini inside was like mush.  Might have been better received if it hadn't been called "fries."

These turned out wonderful. I love that this is a tasty low carb side dish. Cooking time was spot on. The “fries” turned out golden brown and crispy! These are going to be my new favorite side dish!

These are pretty good and make a great low carb side.  They do burn quickly, so be careful at the last few minutes of cooking.  They crisp up nicely, but as they cool will quickly start to get softer.  So they are best served right away warm.  I usually have to add more parmesan cheese to coat all the zucchini.  I like to dip them in ketchup.  Thank you for the recipe!

Absolutely awful.  Coating did not stick to anything but the Pam-sprayed foil.  Turning the "fries" over did not help, only knocked off the coating.  They did not get crispy.  Coating was not appetizing.  "Fries" were soggy.

These were amazing once they were done but made enough for leftovers for lunches and when I reheated them they had lost a lot of flavor and were extremely limp

Quick and easy...and tasty. Much less fat than fried and still yummy! I added a little bit of cornmeal to my dry mix.
