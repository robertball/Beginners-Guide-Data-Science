This turned out excellent! I love heat but am super sensitive to cayenne for some reason so I only used 1 teaspoon and then just sprinkled a bit of crushed red pepper flakes. I can't wait to try this recipe with venison!

Great recipe! I love the flavor. Perfect and not too salty. I started with 1 tsp cayenne because I didn’t want it to be too hot, and that was just right for me.

Pretty good.  Just remember, a little cayenne goes a long way & adjust it to your liking.  I used the oven at 200 and used cookie cooling racks on a cookie pan.   Done in 5  hours.  opened the oven a couple of times to let some of the steam out & flipped it about halfway through.

Excellent recipe.  It took me years to hone it to get the right amounts of heat, saltiness, and sweetness.  I couldn't have done it without my 10 year old daughters help.  She's a jerky fanatic.
