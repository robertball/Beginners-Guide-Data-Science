I had to make a few substitutions, but these are just awesome.  I used honey instead of agave nectar, applesauce instead of oil, and peanut butter instead of almond butter.  I'm sure they would be even better with no substitutions, but this was a winner with my husband and my 17 month old!

**second batch note** i made a double batch and froze the dough in large cookie-sized balls by placing plastic wrap over a cookie sheet, allowing them to freeze and then placing them into a ziplock. then all week, i took a few out at a time, baked them at 350 for 10 minutes, gave them a gentle smush as i took them out of the oven to flatten them a bit and let them cool completely on the pan. PERFECTION! NO CRUMBLING AND MY 7 YR OLD DAUGHTER GOBBLES THEM! Pretty dang good. I had to make a few changes, like raisins instead of the dried cherries, but if you had them the cherries would have given a nice pop of flavor (I suppose you could try Craisins or even the cherry flavored Craisins as an alternative too). I added a small gala apple to the food processor (minus stem and seeds) for a little extra fruit content, and my cookies came out very moist (a bit crumbly like many other comments). I think I might add another egg next time? I love the walnuts being ground up. My daughters chomped away on an omega3 & 6 rich, high fiber snack and never once caught on to my diabolical plan to give them something healthy. Possibly my new favorite cookie recipe. I wonder how coconut oil would do instead of the canola?

Loved these cookies! I made a few changes based on the other reviews. I used Honey instead of Agave. 2 eggs. Left out the cinnamon. Used natural organic peanut butter instead of almond butter. Left out the dry cherries. And used Coconut oil instead of canola oil. My husband ate 6 and my kids devoured them after school!!

Really good! Can't wait for my kids to try them! For those of you who like to weigh ingredients, this is for you: Walnuts (7 oz.) Oats (9 oz.) Wheat Flour (3.75 oz.) Flax (3.75 oz.) Almond Butter (9 oz.) Walnut Oil (4 oz.) Canola is NOT healthy! Agave (5.75 oz.) Brown Sugar (5.5 oz.) Chocolate Chips (12 oz.) Next time I'd use half the chocolate chips. Next time I'd like to try all honey and coconut oil. Thank you!

Awesome and super flexible to meet dietary needs.  I used two eggs, replaced the brown sugar with 1/3 cup Stevia (cup for cup style), added 2 tbls chia seeds to dry ingredients, and subbed melted coconut oil for canola.  I used gluten free oats and gluten free flour.  I, too, ground the oats in the food processor, and everything mixed really well.  Flatting the cookies before baking them worked best for me.  I can hardly make them fast enough to keep up with the family.  

I've been experimenting with breakfast cookies for a while, and I love the fact that these use so little regular flour.  These are the best I've tried yet, and they are really healthful as well.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!!

Thanks for a great recipe.  These are delicious and nutritious.  Because I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand I needed to make some subsitutions.  I used almonds instead of walnuts, peanut butter instead of almond butter, ommitted the cinnamon, used 1/4 c brown sugar and 1/8 c honey (instead of the agave).  I used 1 1/2 c raisins instead of the cherries and chocolate chips.

I love these cookies! The only thing I changed in this recipe was omitting the chocolate chips. Honestly, I don't think it needs them but the chocoholics among us will disagree. I was curious what the "flattening" does, so I left one cookie unflattened as my control. The unflattened cookie tasted delicious as well, but the flat versions travel well. I baked half of the batch right away and put the other half in the fridge and baked them up a few days later. I couldn't save these just for breakfast; I ate them all day long.

I made these so my daughter would get some protein in the mornings. The flavor was wonderful. I baked mine a little longer, and flattened them prior to cooking instead of after. I didn't use flax, and didn't add anything else to make up for it, so the cookies were a little wet. But, that was my fault, so I'm not penalizing the recipe. The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5, is that I think there is too much chocolate. (You will NEVER hear me say that again.) I would probably cut the chocolate chips in half next time, and use more raisins. (Which I subbed for the cherries.) I also used coconut oil instead of canola, PB instead of almond butter, and honey instead of agave. I think this will be a family favorite now that I know how to tweak it. Overall, a great recipe to customize, and a healthy, quick, breakfast option.

Sorry, I don't know why I seem to be the only one who cannot rave about these cookies. I really stuck with the recipe, since I also want a wholesome cookie with my coffee that includes fiber and protein.  I did leave out the chocolate chips because it sounded too sweet.  But the cookies just didn't seem sweet enough, and they were heavy.  I wish I had NOT flattened them with the spatula.  I plan to retry this, with a bit more sugar, more cherries, and maybe more soda to make them lighter, crispier. I do appreciate the recipe, anyway.

Thanks for the inspiration to bake a healthier cookie. I added a well ripened banana to replace some of the oil. Very yummy.

Some subs. One-pan bars.I never have all the ingredients for recipes so I subbed: syrup for agave, reg flour for whole wheat, and coconut oil for canola, and no cherries. I've made it this way a lot! My picky 6yo loves them so that makes this recipe a WINNER. He even helped make a batch once. Now, to save time I line a cookie sheet with foil and dump the entire batch on it and press it down with my fingers until it's spread flat. When it's done I 'drop' the pan on the counter several times to simulate pressing the cookies down. When it's cooled off I flip the pan onto a cutting board, peel off the foil and cut into 'cookie bars' with a rocking pizza cutter and bag up for the week. Dress my family of 3 breakfast Mon-Friday. Like I said this is a WINNER of a recipe and almost have it memorized.

These are great! I used chopped up dates instead of cherries and cut the brown sugar down to just a couple tablespoons. I also cut the chocolate chips down to 2/3 of a cup (this was sufficient - a whole cup would have been too much) and replaced the oil with applesauce. I wrapped them up individually in plastic wrap and have been taking them to go as either a mid-morning snack or afternoon treat which is both delicious and almost guilt-free! Great recipe! I had never used agave nectar but had such a great experience using it in this recipe that it will be a staple in my pantry now!

I didn't have walnuts, but I did have pecans (I live in Texas - they're everywhere) so I used them instead. After reading the other reviews, I decided to add another egg and more oil to make the batter a little less dry. My cookies turned out great!! Even my son who hates "healthy" recipes commented on how good they were. 

I'm already planning my next batch! Thanks for sharing!!

Excellent, used 2 eggs and peanut butter and they were awesome cookies, not even just for breakfast, for ANY occasion!  Also I used craisins but any dried fruit would be great!

I was skeptical when I saw that this recipe had flaxseed, whole wheat flour AND oatmeal.  It sounded too healthy.  However, we tried it and it is delicious.  After we ground the walnuts, we poured them into a large bowl.  We ground the oatmeal and flax until it was fine (about five minutes), added the baking soda, salt and cinnamon to the processor and pulsed to combine.  Poured it all into the large bowl and mixed it together with bittersweet chocolate chips and Craisins.  Meanwhile, we creamed the butter (I just couldn't use oil in a cookie recipe, I'm sure it's delicious- but these are cookies) with the brown sugar until light and fluffy.  Added in one egg at a time and mixed on medium speed for about 30 seconds (used two eggs).  Added the peanut butter (we didn't have enough almond butter on hand) and vanilla to the mixer, and mixed on medium for about a minute.  Slowly added the dry ingredients to the mixer (1/3 at a time) until it was all incorporated.  The cookie dough looked a little wet, but I left it alone and baked one batch to test (baked for 9 minutes) - Delicious!  Thank you for a healthier chocolate chip cookie recipe, that my three-year olds and husband devoured.

These are going in my personal collection!  I subbed honey (instead of agave), coconut oil (instead of canola), raw sugar (instead of brown), 1/2 the quantity in dark choc chips. double the eggs, triple the cinnamon.  The kids gobbled them up - thought they were just plain old cookies!  YAY!!!!

I thought these were quite good, but still doesn't beat a good chocolate chip cookie, but still much healthier. I substituted applesauce for the oil, ground up the oatmeal in the food processor with the nuts (I used almonds), added 1/2 tsp almond extract, and used dried cherries but didn't have chocolate chips. The cookies are soft and didn't crumble and I didn't need to press them down. They still have a lot of calories because of the nuts and almond butter, so even the 'healthy' stuff in moderation (I'm telling myself this more than anyone else cause I just ate 6!)

This is an excellent recipe and is great as followed, or (as I use it) a great outline you can use to construct your own deliciously healthy cookie! As you can see from the other comments, this is an extremely versatile recipe. Flavors, macronutrient composition, texture, and sweetness level can all be changed around and the end result will still come out great! Personally, I use PB instead of almond butter, I skip the flax meal (difficult to find where I live), skip the cinnamon, skip the brown sugar, use honey instead of agave (also difficult to find here), use dried cranberries instead of cherries, use half pumpkin seeds half chopped walnuts in place of the ground walnut, and add 1/2 cup applesauce in place of the oil. Mine do come out tasting very 'healthy'- but that's the way I like it! If you prefer a more traditional-cookie feel, just adjust to your liking. Recommended :)

Will become a staple in my home.  Versatile, wholesome, and loaded with fiber!  I substituted a scant 1/3 cup maple syrup for the agave & sugar, overripe bananas for the oil.  Also added 1/2 teas. almond extract.  Decadent!  Thank you Iris!

These taste really good, and made my house smell AMAZING! My only problem is that mine turned out sort of crumbly--they're not staying together very well. I did like another review suggested and smashed them down a little when they came out of the oven, and it helped to let them cool on the cookie sheet for a little bit, but they're still crumbly. Don't know where I went wrong, but they still taste great!

Made this the other nite and could tell by how delicious the dough was that they'd be good.  I did about 1 1/2 recipe; followed it pretty closely with a few small tweaks.  I was low on choc. chips.  I only had about 1/4 cup, so I chopped them med-fine and threw 'em in....this turned out to be the perfect amount of chocolate.  I also had no almond butter, so used chunky peanut butter.  Used 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 canola.  Also used 1/2 agave, 1/2 honey.  Baked as directed, flattened, cooled, and WOW.  TERRIFFIC cookies.  Double batch next time!!  :P

Fantastic cookies!  I freeze each batch and take a couple out the night before I go to work. I used  1/2 cup Mini chocolate chips instead, because I discovered that they're less messy when you press the spatula on them after baking.  Other than that I would not change a thing.

OH MY GOODNESS these are so good! Thought I would have trouble finding some of the ingredients but they were all available in the same, regular grocery store. I needed a replacement for the chocolate chip Kashi cookies and these are BETTER!

These were pretty good.  I didnt have the Agave nectar so I used honey like in a previous review.  I also wasnt crazy about the chocolate chips in it.  That just kind of defeats the purpose as a breakfast item.  But I will try it again and substitute raisins for the chocolate chips and maybe leave some of the walnuts chunky.

These are terrific!  I omitted the cherries and cinnamon to make them more like a traditional chocolate chip cookie.  I went to caloriecount.com and determined that they are approximately 227 calories each, 14.8 fat, 5.7 protein.  My batch made 22 cookies.  Really great.

This recipe is excellent. I have made it twice. The first time I used PB (since I had it on hand), and added dried cranberries and dark chocolate chips. The second time, I used almond butter, omitted the dried fruit and cinnamon, and decreased the brown sugar to 1/4 cup. So basically they were healthier chocolate chip cookies with these modifications. I like these so much better than traditional chocolate chip cookies. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe!

My granddaughters loved these, and I'm grateful they do because they are a good example of a healthy snack!  I did make a couple of minor changes--coconut oil rather than the canola, a mix of dried cherries, blueberries, and strawberries, and fewer chocolate chips.  These cooked perfectly in 8 minutes.  Thanks for these cookies!

Yes, these came out a bit crumbly, but I did not make them to replace regular chocolate chip cookies.  I am a single working mom with four kids and wanted something healthy they could grab for breakfast that wasn't loaded with the sugar and artificial stuff they put in store bought breakfast cookies.  

I made a double batch and stored the cookies in my freezer in a plastic container, which helped the cookies keep from falling apart.  

Initially, my children were skeptical and hesitant, and, while none of them would admit to loving them, the cookies certainly disappeared awfully fast!  I will definitely make again.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Wow.  I love these cookies.  I made mine sugar free:  used honey and stevia instead of brown sugar.  Also, I used quick cook steel cut oats which gives them lots of texture.  Even my children snatch them up.  Thank you for this great recipe!

A nice option for a breakfast on the go!  And yummy, too!  I did make 2 small tweaks.   We aren't fans of walnuts, so I subbed almonds.  And I didn't have dried cherries,  so I subbed dried cranberries.  I did bake them for only 8 minutes, to make sure they stayed soft.  Thanks for the recipe!

Love these!! I didn't have any nuts on hand so i replaced it with 3/4 cup of spelt bran. I also used honey instead of the Avave, and I used 2 eggs. They turned out wonderfully, no crumbling at all. These will definitely be a staple in our home!!

These were delicious! Thank you for a healthier alternative. My cookie mixture before being baked was not only thick, but very crumbly. I followed instructions and patted them with the spatula when they were just out of the oven, and that did the trick! They turned out great, and I will make these again because I always have these ingedients on hand!

I used apple sauce instead of the oil and honey instead of agave and it turned out great! I'd like to omit the whole wheat flour entirely so I may try a substitution for it next time. Thanks for the recipe!

These were pretty good, especially considering how healthy they are. They do look much better than the picture. I made 1/2 recipe and got 25 cookies using a standard cookie scoop. The only change I made was using white whole wheat flour and subbing 1/2 the flax meal, I was short, with extra white whole wheat flour. I did not have cherries, so I used dried cranberries. I was also out of almond butter and just used an equal amount of almonds, since it was going to all get ground up anyhow. I used my vitamix blender, to grind the walnuts, and blended the liquid mixture about 2 minutes on speed 10 instead of using a food processor. They are a filling and a very hearty and chocolatey breakfast cookie. ty

Yep. These are fantastic. I omitted the walnuts and chocolate chips, increased the raisins to 1.5 cups and swapped the brown sguar for Sucanet. I also smashed them down with a spatula upon taking them from the oven as suggested.  Delicious!

Love! I tried this recipe as a way to use up my almond butter, and I am hooked.  Appreciate all the suggested variations - I used ground almonds instead of walnuts (couldn't find my walnuts!), and honey instead of agave nectar.  Next time I will reduce the chocolate chips and increase the dried cherries.  Delicious, healthy alternative to satisfy a sweet tooth in the morning, or in the afternoon when a cookie craving comes on.

These were so awesome! Thank you so much for a great healthful recipe that serves as a quick, nutritious breakfast "cookie" for my two toddlers! Previously the best I had was Nutrigrain bars! the only things I changed were I did add an extra egg, only had 1/2 cup walnuts so I blended some mixed nuts in too to make closer to 1 cup. I also added about 1/4 cup Fiber One that I had pulverized in the food processor with the nuts. Couldn't even tell! You can never get too much fiber! I'd eat these over a chocolate chip cookie! Thanks so much for the recipe!:)
Wanted to add too: I did not use Parchment Paper since I had none but it worked fine just spraying the cookie sheet with cooking spray, FYI....

Thanks for a great recipe!!!! I used three egg whites instead of an egg, used half amount needed of oil and subbed the rest with apple sauce, and only used agave nectar instead of brown sugar. Used cranberries... And dried blueberries!!  Finally used whole grain wheat flour and a mixt of nine whole grain cereal including rolled oats. Made these even healthier if thats possible! Still turned out delicious which really again shows how versatile this recipe is. Bravo!!!

This is a wonderful cookie.  Healthy but doesn't taste like it.  Hey, what they don't know won't hurt um.  I did substituted the walnuts with almond flour and reduced the cinnamon by nearly half - that is what I had on hand.  I used dark chocolate chips - yum.  I followed the advise to slightly smash when taking out of the oven to cool to prevent crumbling with success.  
We really enjoyed these cookies and I will make them regularly.  The only change I will make next time is using equal amounts of cherries and dark chocolate chips (3/4 cups each).  They were chocolaty with a hint of tart cherry.  I'd like to equal that out a bit since I like the tart as much as I like chocolate!  Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

Love this recipe!  I wanted to make cookies for my 3 year old that were healthy and tasty, and these passed with flying colors.  I subbed almonds for the walnuts, and peanut butter for the almond butter.  I also used date sugar in place of brown sugar, apple butter instead of oil, and omitted the dried fruit because my son doesn't like it.  The final results are a moist, tasty cookie with a slight nutty flavor and a nice texture.  My kiddo ate 3 right off the bat, so we have a winner.  I'll definitely make these again, thanks!

So, so yummy!  I subbed honey for the agave, raisins for the cherries, coconut oil for canola, and peanut butter for the almond butter.  I made the mistake of mixing in the chocolate chips after I had already incorporated everything else - follow the recipe, otherwise your chocolate chips will not mix in well.   I've made the recipe twice now and both times felt I need to reduce the amount of chocolate chips.  Maybe 1/2 of what the recipe calls for.  I'm so happy I found this recipe!

I made this recipe yesterday, and boy is it tasty! I made some amendments to it though, as my husband is really allergic to nuts and nut products, and I was going to enter them into a healthy cookie contest, so I wanted to cut back on the fat:

1. instead of walnuts, I used pumpkin seeds
2. instead of almond butter, I used sunflower seed butter
3. instead of canola oil, I used applesauce
4. Instead of blue agave nectar, I used honey
5. I doubled the entire recipe, but kept the sugar at 1/3 cup. In other words, I used half the amount of sugar.

They're fabulous!! However, something really strange happened today. The outside is the normal brown colour, but the insides are green. Like, emerald green! They taste the same as they did yesterday, but the colour is throwing me off a little.

I too made these with a few subs--Honey instead of agave because agave is NOT healthy; safflower oil instead of canola because canola is NOT healthy; and I also added some pureed carrots (about 1/4 cup) to punch up the veggie value, and the cookies were moist, chewy, and delish! I'm a cloves fan so I added 1/4 tsp of that too. I'm planning to tweak the recipe a bit for seasonal variety, adding cranberies and pumpkin, etc. Great basic recipe!

These turned out awesome. I substituted as follows: pecans for walnuts; reduced sugar craisins for dried cherries; sunflower butter for almond butter; whole flax seeds for ground flax meal; coconut oil for canola; raw honey for agave nectar. I also opted for dark chocolate chips, and added 6 Tbsp of shredded coconut. By my calculations, each cookie comes in at 258 calories. My kids devour these like there's no tomorrow! Will make these again and again!

Very good! I made MULTIPLE changes to this recipe and I won't bore you with them all, but just so you should know this recipe is highly adaptable. I WILL let you know that the flour can be left out, so if you have access to gluten free oats this recipe can be celiac friendly. To make up for the loss of starch I used 1 cup oatmeal and half a cup quick oats. Also 1 cup walnuts is about 100 grams ground nuts.

I just added 1 grated carrot, 2 grated apples and 1/2 cup chopped cranberries instead of the cherries. Also I saw in fridge I had 1/4 fresh strawberries so I threw them in too! Makes a very healthy cookie this way!Thanks

I thought the flavor was rather bland and the cookies were a bit dry.  My oven temp tends to be  a little higher than the temp indicator though.  I followed the recipe very close.  I used home-made almond butter, and raisins instead of dried cherries.  I will try this recipe again and use apple sauce and/or ripe banana in place of the oil to give these a little more flavor and moisture.  I don't generally like to use agave syrup since it's even worse for you than high fructose corn syrup (agave is just a higher concentration of fructose syrup than hfcs) but I had some agave on hand and used it.  I think honey would help give some flavor and moisture to these cookies.  I love the idea of these though and think the recipe could definitely be made healthier and with more flavor.  I don't love the idea of feeding kids chocolate for breakfast so I'd probably add more fruit instead.  I think you could also easily sneak in some grated carrot, zucchini or other squash to give these a little moisture and added nutrients.

Perfect solution to my boring egg breakfast!  Also a wonderfully healthy cookie/snack.  I just made my first batch and am so happy I did.  I only changed the almond butter to peanut butter since I had that.  I also left out the cherries.  I found that one cup of chocolate chips was a bit much.  I had chips in the bottom of my mixing bowl and no more dough.  Next time I will use 1/2 cup and try mini chips instead.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.  This was exactly what I was looking for!

So yummy! I followed the recipe exactly except I had to sub the walnuts for pecans... so delicious!  I only got 15 cookies out of the batch, probably because my two year old kept sneaking huge bites of dough every time I turned around.  They were moist and delicious,  loved the dried cherry/choco chip combo.  Will be a weekly staple in our house from now on, thanks for sharing!

These cookies were fantastic! I love all of the healthy ingredients and you still get to eat a cookie:) I made a few substitutes by using 2 eggs to help hold them together better, wheat germ instead of ground flax, dried bleuberries and cranberries instead of cherries, and apple sauce instead of oil. I loved them and so did my 3 year old son. I will definetely make these agai!

These are AMAZING.  I am generally very skeptical that healthy stuff is actually going to taste good...too many bad experiences I guess.  I'm getting sick of eating oatmeal every morning and I need to keep my weight down so I needed to find a healthy alternative.  I have taken flax seed oil pills but never cooked with flax meal, and knew little to nothing about blue agave nectar.  I made the recipe exactly as it is shown, except I omitted the dried cherries (my husband and I prefer only fresh cherries, eaten by themselves).  They turned out great, and my husband said, "I can't wait for breakfast!".  I know exactly what he means.  IrisMac, thank you SO much for sharing this recipe.  My mornings will be a lot more enjoyable because of you!!! :D

These are wonderful. My 2 1/2 yr old and 5 1/2 year old love them!
I used honey instead of agave, raisins instead of cherries, and 2 eggs instead of one.
These got us through the week with healthy breakfasts and snacks! Thank you!!

These are great.  I made minimal changes:  left some of the walnuts chunky, reduced the oatmeal as recipe author suggested, and left out the dried cherries.  My batter was very moist and sticky.  I slightly underbaked and mashed as recommended.  Texture is great.  Next time I will try bananas/applesauce in place of some/all the oil.

Substituted the Almond butter with pumpkin and it turned out great. added the extra egg and cut down on the brown sugar. Used applesauce instead of oil. went with Dark chocolate chips. 
All together - great snack...I love the base of this recipe because you can mix it up with whatever you want. I made bars. It gets sticky but just wet hands with water when you shape them and pressed with a spatula to about 3/8 of and inch. 10 to 12 min. 
I will make again. Thanks

These turned out great. I subbed butter flavored coconut oil for the canola oil, added 2 eggs instead of 1 and used honey instead of agave syrup. Love the taste and texture. Next time I will try to incorporate lower calorie ingredients.

What a great recipe! I have a tree nut allergy so I replaced the walnuts with powdered peanut butter and the almond butter with peanut butter. I also lined my cookie sheet with parchment and made bars, pressing a double batch onto the sheet. Love these!

I make these cookies 2x month, my husband & I love it. I tried substituting with cranberries instead of cherries to save some cash & they still came out ok. This batter is very sticky so I found the best way to form the cookie is to wet your hands with a little water

Really very good!!  I did have to swap the walnuts for an equal amount of flour (whole wheat pastry flour) and the peanut butter for sunflower seed butter due to allergies.   They taste awesome,  and I didn't find them to be too dry or crumbly.  Keep the oil....I bet they wouldn't be as good if it was subbed with applesauce.

Good protein and fibre cookie.  Filling and pleasing to children and adults.  Tends to be a little on the dry and crumbly side, but that's to be expected of cookies made with a nut (or seed) butter.  A good school snack idea.

YUMMY!  I did the following...Grind up the oatmeal for a less granola texture. Also sub out the wheat flour with more ground oats. I use my Blendtec and that ground up my walnuts good. Replaced Canola oil with one banana and 1 tbsp olive oil or coconut oil.  2 Eggs. No brown sugar but either honey or agave 1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons. I also chop up my chips.  I also sometimes use ground up cashews in place of the almond butter.  My husband could tell these are "healthy" cookies so I am going to see what else I can sub that's UNDETECTABLE. :)

I was on the hunt for a tasty and healthful "treat" for our little snack helper at her  preschool for our monthly day in class. I tested a few treats with my family and I could not get every one (4 of us) to agree so didn't want to share it with 18 kids all 5 or younger. I woke up a few mornings ago to this recipe in my mailbox and finally made them this morning following the recipe as written and we have a score of 3 out of 4 ( one is sick and not eating) so I will be making more for the class....YUMMY and healthful !!!!!!

1 cup of chocolate chips was a ridiculous amount, they can't even be incorporated into the batter, and they make the cookies way too sweet for breakfast. My kids like them, unsurprisingly, but I would reduce the chips to 1/2 cup next time. Also will try raisins as other reviewers suggested.

I had to use pecans, since that's all I had on hand.  After blending, I blended all of the dry ingredients in my food processor (except for the oats; added them last and pulsed it about 3x so they wouldn't break up too badly).  Added 2 big scoops of protein powder to beef that up.  Left out the cherries because we are choc chip people.  Used melted coconut oil for better nutrition and flavor (and a little more of it since I added the protein powder). Lastly, peanut butter since we were out of almond butter.  Super thick dough; hard to work with.  Next time, I will add the dry ingredients to the wet and let the food processor do the work. A little crumbly but I just pressed it together when rolling into balls.  Kids loved them! I did smash them down a tad and topped with an M&M.  Kids feel like they are being rebels, eating these for breakfast.  Will freeze and reheat in the microwave for busy school mornings.  My recipe yielded 20 cookies.  The added protein made for approx 6.5 g pro/cookie.  I might add a 3rd scoop of protein next time.  Thanks for the awesome, and easy to modify recipe!

Ok, my second go with alterations. I doubled the recipe, used a gluten free flour mixture instead of whole wheat, cut the flax to 1/2 cup and replaced with 1/2 cup of unsweetened coconut.  I added a tablespoon of chia seeds.  Replaced the canola oil with 1/3 cup avocado oil and 1/3 cup applesauce.  Substituted honey for agave, and omitted the brown sugar.  Added 1 cup of chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of craisins.  The rolling and squishing was too much work so I just dropped them onto parchment paper by the teaspoon.  Amazing!  I know I changed a lot but they really turned out well and I wanted to share.  Not too sweet, not too heavy.  Thanks for the great foundation!

Quite Easy & VERY Delicious!
I made these cookies per the recipe with one change, I used almonds instead of walnuts. (Mainly due to my allergy to walnuts.) It turned out WOW! Both my husband and daughter liked them. I made these a second time and used coconut flour instead of whole wheat and YUMMO! a hit! I also like how easy these were to make, in my processor and not my mixer!
thanks for posting.

Great recipe.  On a great path to being healthy.  Take out the rape seed canola oil and use grape seed oil or sunflower oil though.  Can use sugar in the raw instead of brown sugar.  Brown sugar is no better than white, still processed and spikes your insulin.  Take out whole wheat flour and use almond flour for grain free.

These turned out delicious, not overly sweet, and with a "healthy" granola-like taste. I had a hard time holding back from eating them. My only minor complaint would be that the dough is barely sticky enough to hold together so it became a bit messy using my hands to force balls of dough together. I would give it a 4.5 if I could, but the end result is still a yummy cookie. There were two ingredients I didn't have so I had to substitute the agave with honey and the dried cherries with cherry-flavored dried cranberries. However, I don't think it compromised the flavor. Also, I ended up with 33 cookies instead of 18, so I guess my heaping teaspoons were not heaping enough, but I like the petite size.

Loved it and so did the family (children age 2 1/2, 8, 20)!  I did take the advice of reviewers and made some substitutions.  2 eggs, applesauce, Peanut butter, no fruit, 1/2 C. of mini choc. chips  They are small cookies so packaging 2-3 for a quick take to school/work.  Definitely would recommend.

Nut allergy substitution: I try not to review recipes when I have changed major ingredients, but it is difficult to find breakfast cookie recipes without peanut/tree nut ingredients. I hope another allergic person might benefit from my experiment. For the walnuts, I substituted 1/2 cup oat flour. For the almond nut butter, I substituted 2 Tbsp. butter and 2 Tbsp. ground chia seeds. Everything else was as written, and the whole family loves them. My seven year old chose these over sugar cookies!

Fantastic "cookies" especially if you have kids!  I did add 2 ripe mashed bananas (which was great because you couldn't even taste them and it added some fresh fruit to the breakfast) and used peanut butter.  I added a few extra chocolate chips but wouldn't do that next time...didn't need it!  I like to freeze them and have them on hand for a quick breakfast or snack!  Great recipe to play with...next time I'm going to try using cinnamon chips.

A-MAZING! How clever! What a wonderful way to eat a fantasticly nutritious and delicious treat. Seriously! I may start selling these to preschool parents. My daughter loves flax seeds and is no newbie to whole grains or nuts ground to flour but, I am still thrilled to start the school year slipping these into a time deprived hand! 
So, I tweaked it a bit. I used chocolate almond butter and used dark chocolate chips. I also omitted cranberries because my four year old won't eat them. Though, I think they would certainly compliment these perfectly. Love, Love, Love these. Quite impressed by the results in the food processor. I have been looking for a great breakfast bar. I happened to have everything on hand which meant that it fit my nutritional requirements
I will make these time and again! I am thrilled! You and your sister should get a table at your local farmers market. Kudos!

This is exactly what I was looking for to replace the packaged breakfast cookies my kids like - thank you so much!  The version I made was based on previous reviews and what I had in the house (peanut butter for almond butter, almonds for the walnuts, applesauce for the oil, omitted the cherries, used 3/4c mini chips, 2 eggs, honey for the brown sugar, ground up the oats).  I would not have been able to come up with this on my own, so I am very grateful to you for sharing.

I can't get over how good these are - I try to make them at night before busy mornings, but have to fight my 4 kids and husband off them.  They beg to have one as their "bedtime treat" (which is usually ice cream!).  They are a regular item here, although now that I'm out of my stash of pecans (Louisiana girl here, we don't do walnuts) I am in a bit of a panic because I'm not sure I'm willing to pay what they are going for!  I also sub coconut oil because I believe it's healthier, and peanut butter just because it's cheaper.  Slightly undercooking and then cooling them on the pan for a long time is definitely the key to a soft cookie that stays together.

I love this cookie.   It tastes better, in my opinion, with almond butter, but I usually have just peanut butter on hand and it's still a great tasting breakfast cookie.   I am still not sure if Canola oil is good or bad for the body so I opt for half applesauce and half coconut oil (or olive oil).

Kids couldn't believe they were getting cookies for breakfast!  I can't believe I'm saying this (since I have a sweet tooth) but next time maybe I'll cut back on the sugar so it seems less like a treat and more like a breakfast!  Can't do without the chocolate, though!  Delicious!
I was worried when the dough wouldn't hold together, but just plop them in balls and it works out.

Great cookies! I was a little skeptical at first, but these are great. I plan on making a bunch up and freezing them for after my baby is born. These would be perfect postpartum snacks! 

A few alterations I made-
I used wheat germ instead of the walnuts; peanut butter instead of the almond butter; raisins instead of dried cherries; and I only used half of the chocolate chips, which was great plenty!

This recipe is so versatile.  I used powdered eggs, almonds instead of walnuts, peanut butter instead of almond butter, 1/2 the brown sugar, stevia and sour cream instead of agave nectar, and no cherries. Next time I will try applesauce for the oil and who knows what else. And my kids loved them.

Doubled the egg, no crumbling. Used honey instead of agave extract. Turned out nice and soft! Watch the cook time, the bottom of my cookies were a little too dark for my liking. Over all great recipe. Will make again!

YUM!  That is what the kids had to say!  I did make a few changes.  I pulsed the Oats in the food processor down to a flour consistency( it is just a preference of the kids).  I left out the cinnamon.  I used unsweetened applesauce instead of oil.  3T of honey in place of the agave nectar(It was on hand).  I used 1/3 c of Splenda Brown Sugar.  Left out the Cherries.  Added dark chocolate chips.  I baked them on a Sil-pat and they came out amazing.  I didn't smash them down either and I have not had any trouble with them crumbling.  As a matter of fact they are so moist they are slightly sticky as they sit in the container.  Thank you for a great base recipe.

These are really tasty. I made a few changes, as people do. I didn't have any walnuts, so I used pecans. I used honey instead of agave nectar and peanut butter instead of the almond butter. I added a second egg as suggested in other reviews and used a stevia based sweetener instead of brown sugar. I also used unsweetened applesauce instead of oil. I squashed the cookies a little when pulling them out of the oven so they'd look more like cookies. They are super yummy and will be in the regular rotation.

I have made these cookies several times usually following the recipe exactly. Occasionally I will sub in peanut butter for almond butter or another dried fruit for the cherries. These are awesome! My four kids love them! My son learned the hard way though to only eat one, maybe two, at a time. The high fiber content is great....if you are used to it! (We affectionately refer to these as "poo cookies")

My girls love these!  I use the rolled oats, and make a second batch using a fiber based cereal like Post Grape Nuts as my youngest doesn't like oats.  I've put in dried cranberries and a mixture of dried berries, and I leave out the agave usually.  They are perfect for my oldest, who is a Juvenile Diabetic, as they are stable carb food, keeps her sugar level better.  These don't last long!

soooo goood! I don't like walnuts so I used almonds. They taste amazing. Next time I'm going to add a little more almond butter and Chia seeds at the end. I'm also going to replace the cherries and simisweet chocolate with blueberries and dark chocolate chips!!! So excited.

I really enjoyed these when nursing (and like to make them for other new moms too) for a healthy bit of energy at any time of day or night.  I made them as directed except with dark chocolate chips and did not grind the walnuts as finely.

These turned out really good and they're much better for my fiancé than the Carnation Instant Breakfast he's been drinking.  I did add the extra egg as others suggested and they're still a little crumbly.  Versatile recipe because I used what I had on hand...pecans, cashew butter, and applesauce instead of oil.  Next time will probably 50/50 the cherry and chocolate chip add-ins.  I also made them into bars which speeds up the process.  Spread into a greased 9x13 inch pan and bake for 25-30 min.

Very tasty recipe. Using the food processor to blend ingredients made for very fast prep. I baked a few then froze the rest of the cookie balls so that I can have warm fresh breakfast cookies at any time.

These are really good for healthy cookies. Soft and chewy and very filling. I love to read on nutrition, so I made a change. I used honey instead of the agave nectar, because I read some facts on it which included that the amount of fructose in it converts to fat faster than glucose and can cause weight gain and create insulin resistance. I had tried it in the past because it is supposed to be lower on the glycemic index, but threw it away after reading the new research. I ground my flax seeds right before using them because the omega three fatty acids go rancid soon after being ground, but am concerned that it might not matter because I read that heat can damage the value of those fatty acids. Oh well, the fiber is definitely still there. After reading the reviews about them being crumbly, I added an extra egg yolk and used dark brown sugar. They were not crumbly at all. I added a few extra cherries and wish I had just thrown the rest of the bag in. If I make these again I will reduce the chocolate because it overwhelmed everything else, and omit the cinnamon. I got 20 cookies and 8 minutes was perfect in my oven. Thanks for this versatile recipe!

I made it exactly as stated above, except I skipped the cherries and I accidently forgot to add the almond butter (oops!). But it still came out perfect (not crumbly at all). I also made the dough several hours in advance and refrigerated the dough for a few hours before baking them for my guests in the evening. My very picky 8 year old gobbled them up. Thank you for this wonderful healthy recipe!!

These are amazing!  I followed the recipe exactly except for using coconut oil instead of canola and I used 1/3 cup agave by accident. Definite keeper!!!  Does anyone know the nutrition/calorie count on these?

What a great healthy alternative to chocolate chip cookies! Great taste, great crispy undertones, yet still really soft and chewy. I highly recommend this recipe.

Yum!  I substituted almond meal for the walnuts and flour (because I didn't have either!).  Also used honey instead of agave, coconut sugar instead of brown sugar (because it is a 1-1 sub and lower glycemic index) and two eggs.  Omitted any dried fruit since my kids don't like that, and reduced the chocolate chips to 3/4 cup.  They were soft and chewy.  Kids loved them, so did I but because of all the nuts and nut butter, they are very high in fat.  Lotta protein though!

I just tried out this recipe today, and I loved it! I made a few substitutions. Instead of blue agave nectar, I used honey. I skipped the raisins, cinnamon and dried cherries, and used peanut butter instead of almond butter. I also used two eggs (thanks to the fellow reviewers!). Canola oil is NOT healthy - I used extra virgin olive oil instead. I had been looking for quick and healthy breakfast options for the past few days, and this is just the perfect morning meal.

These were surprisingly good. I made them as per the recipe. The dough was hard to mix, so I used my hands. I used a spoon to place them on the cookie sheet without rolling them into balls because the dough was so sticky.  They came out great!

I've tried a lot of "healthy" cookie and muffin recipes, but none of them come close to these beauties. Yes I did a few subs - good food is not cheap (natural peanutbutter: almond butter, honey: agave, raisins: cherries) and I added a second egg (thanks other reviewers!). Gorgeous, chewy, sweet, hearty for breakfast.  They aren't the most elegant looking cookies, so Martha Stewart won't get any when she visits. Her loss.

Very tasty.  I substituted Domata gluten-free flour for the whole wheat flour and added 1/2 cup coconut for texture.  Next time, I would use peanut butter as a more reasonably priced option to the almond butter.  Also used two eggs and subbed coconut oil on the recommendations of other reviewers.

I really like this recipe,...i have made it 3 times now. the only substitution I made was using coconut oil for the canola oil in the recipe and I also used craisins for the cherries because I didn't have any one time when I did buy dried cherries I liked the craisins in the cookies better! I will try both this time I also make a double batch and freeze some for later. I have to remember to soak craisins & dried cherries in hot water for a minute before adding, that is what someone told me to do when adding dried fruit to recipes
This is a great recipe!!!

Delicious! Since I don't have a food processor, I used almond flour from our local health food store. I didn't have agave nectar, so I used honey.  I skipped the dried cherries. Turned out great.

These were fantastic! I subbed chunky pb for the almond, applesauce for oil and didn't have walnuts so left those out altogether. Just increased the wheat flour to right consistency. Perfect!

These taste great. I often eat cookies for breakfast; at least with these I don't have to feel quite as guilty. I used peanut butter instead of almond butter, omitted the cinnamon, used 2 eggs instead of one, doubled the vanilla, and added some chia seeds to the dry ingredients. Yummy.

Easy, soft, moist.  Used low sugar craisins instead of cherries.  Honey in place of the agave- will use less honey or the agave as suggested next time as too much honey gave it kind of an odd flavor.  Definitely NOT diet food though- they may be 'healthy' but they are not for the calorie counter.  I figured it all and 1 cookie was worth 100 calories (out of 32 cookies)  Used applesauce in place of oil and peanut butter not almond

I just made a double batch, so I'm not sure how well they freeze yet--but I will say that this recipe is so flexible and hard to get wrong! I just used the ingreedients that I had, burned the first batch and undercooked the second: all the cookies (I can't stop eating them), taste wonderful!

I also added 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg and 1/4 teaspoon fresh ginger. I used an extra egg instead of the ground flax, I somewhat ground the oats as well and only used half the honey and half the sugar.

Next time I'm going to double the spices and add molasses!

These are incredibly delicious and healthy treats.  They are rather
"pricey" if all the ingredients are kept the same.  However, I think
the result is worth the price.  I am glad I tried them, and will keep
making these cookies.

These were awesome, and I bet original recipe is perfect, but I had to make a few changes because I didn't have everything on hand. First, I used gluten free oats and flour, no flax, so I just subbed almond meal, peanut butter instead of almond butter, coconut oil instead of canola oil, processed an apple instead of cherries, and 2 eggs. Turned out great!

OMG these are the best cookies I've ever eaten. And they stay moist and chewy for days, though though they've only made it to day 3 around me, haha.
I have lots of 'homemade' honey around so I used that instead. (not sure what you would call honey you harvest yourself, I'll call it homemade for now)
I don't have a food processor so I just ground up the walnuts as finely as I could. So good!

Great, healthy and flexible.  I made several substitutions and adjustments.  Lots of play room here.  Got up early and couldn't make a lot of noise so I hand chopped my walnuts.  Only had quick oats so in they went.  Didn't have any wheat flour so I used almond flour.  Substituted coconut flour for ground flax seed.  Used 1-1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  Used peanut butter, grape seed oil and 2 eggs and a little milk.

Yummy.  Hope they make it to church.  Will be making more later when I get to the store for more ingredients.

I think of these more as a not-terrible-for-you dessert. Too tasty for breakfast! One time I was out of agave and used honey instead, which made them sweeter than I prefer but may be a good option if making for pickier eaters and children who are used to sweets.

I had to change a couple things due to allergies and healthfulness, but the changes worked ok and it was delicious! My one complaint was the nuts turned to nut butter in my processor and never flour. I left it more "tiny bits" of nuts than proper "flour" so my cookies were a bit looser and easier to fall apart. If my kids love these a lot and ask for them on a regular basis, I may spring for a bag of nut flour at the store instead of trying to grind my own. Not a big deal, though, for an easy make-ahead breakfast that can even be frozen and kept on hand pretty much all the time.

My changes: had to use pecans instead of walnuts (allergies); and used applesauce instead of oil (by choice), natural pb instead of almond butter (what I had on hand). Will try with almond or sunflower seed butter when I have the chance!

I'm about to be a first time mom and I wanted to have something quick I could grab for breakfast or a snack. These are perfect! I changed up a few things so that they are not just healthy but support lactation as well. First I ground up 1 cup of the oats and left 1/2 cup oats as flakes to reduce the texture a bit. I subbed 2/3 cup brown sugar and a squeeze of honey for the agave. I subbed a snack size unsweetened apple sauce for the oil and used 2 eggs. I used pecans instead of walnuts, grinding most but leaving some a bit more chunky. I used crasins instead of cherries and carob chips instead of chocolate chips, 3/4 cup of each. I added a 1/4 cup whey isolate to up the protein even more and 1/4 cup debittered brewers yeast to make them lactation friendly.  The yeast gives them a bit of an aftertaste so once my milk comes in I think I would cut it out. Cooking for 9 min and letting them cool on the pan for 5 min and then the rest of the way on a rack leaves them nice and chewy. I popped these in the freezer and heat for 20sec in microwave when ready to eat. Perfect grab and go breakfast/snack with tons of fiber and protein! Thanks for the recipe!

The taste is great. My only complaint, and I can't believe I'm saying this, is that there were too many choc chips.  The cookies didn't stick together well cause the dough couldn't get around all the chips.  I'll probably try 1/2 cup of choc chips next time.  Also used honey instead of agave nectar.

Very good.  I love the flavor and how the oats get all toasty.  I don't have agave nectar and I am tired of the taste of honey in things like this, so I used light corn syrup (not the high fructose kind). This, plus using peanut butter instead of almond, helps keep the cost down.  The kids loved them as breakfast.  ** MADE AGAIN: may try in a pan as a bar.

Chewy granola bar and cookie unite!  Had to use what was on hand.  Sub almonds for walnuts, peanut butter for almond butter and honey for nectar. Added an egg as other reviewers suggested. Yum! Can't wait for kids to try.

Marvelous! Here's my substitutions: ground chia seeds for the egg, 1/2 cup each dark chocolate chips and cinnamon chips, applesauce for the oil, honey for the agave, almonds for the walnuts. I was afraid the unsweetened dried cherries would be too harsh for this recipe, but I was happily wrong! True, they are a bit 'shocking' by themselves, but in this recipe, they're marvelous! Also, I made monster sized cookies.
I WILL use this recipe again and again!

I am in love! Now there will never be an excuse to skip breakfast. When it's this delicious and so easy to grab on the go, who'd want to? DO follow the popular advice to press these down after they come out of the oven, for a chewy texture that does not crumble!! I love the versatility of the recipe. I used almonds as my ground nuts, and tahini as my nut butter. I happened to have some tahini in my pantry that needed to be used up, so I saved $ not having to buy some expensive "alternative" nut butter (some say they used peanut butter, but I'm not a big PB fan). As far as drastic changes, the only different thing I did was replace all of the oil with applesauce. There is NO need for ANY oil in these cookies. I also did not have any brown sugar, so I used white sugar and a little molasses. You could make this recipe a million different ways and they'd all be delicious! Use any nut, any nut butter, any dried fruit, use different chips/morsels (white, peanut butter, butterscotch, etc!) THANK YOU IRISMAC!!

I did sub applesauce for oil and added an extra egg.  There was no crumbling.  My new favorite.

These are great -- I felt like I was eating a cherry pie -- yum my favorite-- I couldn't get them to stay together while making the balls so I just pressed them into a jelly roll pan and baked them that way. Let them cool all day then cut into bars - like granola bars. Worked perfect for me, that's how I'll make them from now on now just to see how the teen likes them

These are SO good!  Thank you so much for putting this recipe up on the site.  I had seen some breakfast cookies in Martha Stewart's magazine this month but the recipe literally calls for 4 sticks of butter!  These are really good and much healthier.  I had to make some changes based on what I had in the house - (added some pineapple and coconut, did not have cherries - that sort of thing) but I am gobsmacked by how yummy these taste!  Thank you!!!

My family loves these! Since my husband hates dried fruit, I just leave them out. Sometimes, I adjust the recipe to include some pecan or almond meal (as a sub for the ground walnuts), and I use dark chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet. My husband always wants to eat 4 at a time! Thank you!

Awesome recipe. I make a double batch every month for my 3 skinny, picky kids. They love the idea of getting cookies for dessert after breakfast. These cookies are pretty nutrient and calorie dense, which is great for picky kids! It's hard for me not to eat them myself!

Holy Yum! I'm not much into health food but my M-I-L is diabetic & I'm trying to get her to eat more whole grains, she never even noticed they were healthy.  Don't worry about the consistency of the dough, as it bakes the flax will add a lot of oil to soften it up.  I don't have agave so I just used 2/3 c brown sugar.

these are sooo delicious!  i had to make some modifications based on what i had on hand, but they still turned out amazing.  i did use instant oats (since that's all i had), natural peanut butter instead of almond butter, omitted cherries, and did a mix of semi-sweet chocolate, white cchocolate, and butterscotch chips and they were sooooo good! didn't have to add the extra egg like other users did. boy o boy is this a calorie bomb though, but considering how nutritious it is i'd say it's worth it! =)

Really like this recipe A LOT!! Wanted to make it 4 1/2 stars, ONLY because of the excessive chocolate chips!!  Otherwise 5 stars!!
I subbed white  chocolate chips. I used 1\3 cup plenty for me!  Also did not have cherries,substitute cherry infused cranberries!

Excellent breakfast cookies!! Thanks for sharing!

Delicious with my coffee!!  Definitely a regular now!

These are great... I used sweetened and dried cranberries instead of cherries. 

One review/user mentioned they sub'd in honey for the sweetener... Dont do this, use your honey raw, never cook it. It makes honey bitter and toxic substances are generated when honey is heated. The whole point of raw honey is to get all the benefits of it being a raw & alive product

My family loves these cookies - I make a double batch every other week or so and they don't last long. They're super easy for my teenagers to grab and go, and they're healthy enough that I'm happy when my kids choose these.  I grind up the oats (separately from the walnuts), I use honey instead of agave, I skip the cherries (personal preference), and we've made them with both almond butter and peanut butter and we prefer peanut butter.

Adults and four children all enjoyed this for breakfast. I followed the cook’s suggested sub of extra brown sugar, but used just two extra tablespoons plus two of honey. I used almond flour instead of walnut flour, and half/half almond butter/peanut butter. The dough was crumbly enough to take a whole extra egg rather than the one suggested white. Still five stars because the recipe works even you don’t have exact ingredients on hand. It is self evident if you need to add extra moisture at the end to make it hold together, depending on how wet your sweetener is. Made 30 disher #40 (1 1/2 Tbs.) cookies for me. Hefty eaters ate three apiece.

My son has a few nut allergies so it is hard to find a safe breakfast cookie for him, and he absolutely loves this one! We replace the walnuts with whole wheat flour as someone else had mentioned, and reduced the chocolate chips by 1/4 cup. Otherwise it's the perfect amount of sweetness. Thank you!

This recipe is very versatile! I made these so my teenage daughter could get some extra calories in the morning. She loves them! I subbed like other cooks: Used peanut butter & honey instead of almond/agave. I also have made this recipe with all kinds of fruit combinations. Apples, craisins, raisins, banana. Thanks for sharing!

So easy and SO delicious! My very picky sons love them and these are the only cookies we keep in the house now.  I did make some adjustments. I used candies pecans instead of walnuts, added 1/3 cup of coconut flakes and omitted the cherries. I also used about 2/3 cup peanut butter (instead of almond butter) which helped them hold together better. I cooked them at 350 because 375 at 9 minutes burned them the first time. I will definitely be making these a lot for kids school lunches!

So yummy and healthy! The only modifications I made were omitted dried cherries because kids don’t like them and subbed peanut butter for almond butter. The recipe made 30 good sized cookies for me, and with only about a half cup of sugar total in the whole recipe, this dietitian mom is pleased!

I can't even tell you how many times I have made this recipe...dozens! I also keep them in the freezer and take them out as a snack for my kiddos. I think they taste even better frozen! I love that you can eat a couple of these and not feel guilty about it. It will always be a staple recipe in our house!

Flavour is ok -- not fantastic. But they didn't hang together well. Got really crumbly. Probably not worth the effort again. Next time I'll use the yummy ingredients to make something more satisfying.

First of all I usually make a recipe as written the first time I make it but this time I had to make some substitutions with ingredients on hand so this rating and review is based on those substitutes. I used almonds instead of walnuts,flax seeds instead of flax meal and honey instead of agave nectar. I was lazy and didnt want to make several batches of cookies so I put it all in a 9x13 pan and made bars. Also I omitted the cranberries and chocolate chips because I wanted less sugar and I forgot the vanilla. That all being said, except for baking them too long they were excellent and I will make them again, probably using my substitutions. Next time I will bake them around 20-25 minutes, checking them at 20 min.

Very good, healthy cookie! Something that I can give my 8 year old, packed with nutrients.  I did add just a little bit of homemade frosting because my son gave it an "ok" rating without it, and with the frosting it was a thumbs up. So I know he'll eat them now.

I love how these turned out! I substituted coconut oil for vegetable oil, and used an extra egg, as suggested by another reviewer. I omitted the dried fruit, to suit my children’s preferences. Next time, I will try reducing the sugar, as they’re a bit sweet for me, for breakfast. That said, my 4yo ate two and wanted more,so they’re a hit with her!

I had to make substitutions as well because I didn't have some stuff but these were delicious! I used only whole wheat flour instead of walnuts since I didn't have them. I even used a combo of old fashioned oats and quick cook and they were fine. I used only brown sugar, not agave.  I added another egg based on others' suggestions and I was sure to take out before they were over done. My 4 year old and two year old loved them and are so excited to have cookies for breakfast! Also only had raisins on hand so used just those. I'm sure choc chips would be delicious, too though! ALSO -- only used a hand blender since I wasn't processing the walnuts. It worked fine. Thank you so much!! And thank you for the comments that helped, too. :-)

These are great! My 2 and 5 year olds love them and there’s less sugar and more “good stuff” in them than their typical breakfast cereal. Some reviews said they’re crumbly so I added an extra egg and subbed an overripe banana for the brown sugar. Subbed almond meal for the walnuts and honey for agave because that’s what I had on hand. It’s a great basic recipe that is flexible to what you have on hand.

Other reviewers have great tips on getting the most out of this delicious recipe. I omitted flax completely and added approximately 1/4 c extra whole wheat flour to the recipe so the dough wouldn’t be too wet. No agave, so I used a total of 2/3 c brown sugar with great results. Finally, I used mini semi-sweet chocolate chips (1/2 c) and the dough came together nicely. I’ll be making this again in the future!

Very disappointed. Texture was good but the flavor is bland. It was also a mess to clean after. I’ll still eat them but I won’t make again.

Used a little less walnut flour and a little more whole wheat (just what I had), but LOVED how hearty and delicious these were! I used slightly less brown sugar, and brown rice syrup instead of agave (again, just what I had), and no dried cherries, and love them! So glad I doubled the recipe, as I doubt they will last long with my three boys around. =) Thanks for the recipe!

I have been making these for years. They are very versatile. You can change up the nuts, nut butter, seeds, flour, and sweeteners. I like to do half walnuts, half pecans, and add chopped dried apricots. I do all walnuts with chia seeds and a banana. Also, all mixed nuts with dried cranberries and white chocolate. I like to cut the sugar in half and add 1T maple syrup too. Mix them up and make them your own.

These are amazing! I substituted honey for the agave and left out the dried cherries. I also didn’t roll them into balls, just plopped them down and they flattened on their own. I love the nutty taste without the chunks of nuts.

Wow! These are delicious! I expected breakfast....these really exceeded expectations! They are moist, chewy, hearty, and full of delicious bits...and sweet but not too sweet. I can’t get over how many healthful ingredients they include. It’s also a very versatile and forgiving recipe. Thanks for sharing!! Here are my changes (based on other reviewers’ comments): 2 eggs, 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp baking powder (vs. 1 tsp baking soda), coconut oil subbed for canola, maple syrup subbed for agave, used a heaping 1/3 c brown sugar, and 1/2 c chocolate chips (instead of a whole cup). I also ground 1/2 c of the oats. These are just delicious!!

Delicious and nutritious! Made just as is besides subbing coconut oil for the canola oil - and don’t skip the dried cherries, they really add to the cookie!

I didn’t have the exact ingredients on hand, so I had to make do with what I had...used almonds instead of walnuts, coconut flour instead of whole wheat and coconut oil instead of canola.  I didn’t add any dried fruit because I didn’t have any. 
Tastes yummy—I hope some are left by the time the kids get home from school!!!

This is awesome... it's like having a bowl of oatmeal in cookie form!  BUT, do not be fooled by appearances, because it is not a cookie.  What it is is healthy and eminently transportable.   I followed the directions exactly, except for following adjustments: no chocolate chips or cinnamon (don't care for either); replaced the almond butter with organic unsweetened peanut butter; replaced the flax with pecans that I ground up into meal with the food processor; added 1 extra egg; used dried cranberries instead of cherries.  These are not very sweet, and they are great with your morning coffee.

I made a few changes, because I did not want to use the food processor. I subbed whole wheat flour for the walnut flour, and added walnuts dates and cranberries instead of cherries. I added chocolate chips to the top of half of them. Great recipe, even with all my changes they turned out tasty and healthy.

I thought these were delicious.  I didn't have the dried cherries so I used cranberries and they were good but I wish I'd had the cherries as I'm sure it would be even better!  I also used banana and a little less oil as one other person had done.  I also did not have rolled oats but used Quaker 5 min oatmeal.   Mine came out chewy and moist.  Great recipe...THANKS!

This recipe is wonderful, I love that there are numerous ways to make it.  I used parts honey and agave, and regular all purpose flour. Also used peanut butter instead of almond butter.  So yummy!! Added the extra egg which made them lighter.

These are BY FAR the best ‘healthier’ Cookies I have ever made. I just used almond flour instead of grinding the walnuts and I mixed all my wet ingredients (sans the egg) and microwaved for a few seconds to melt the butter, coconut oil(subbed for oil), honey (out of agave), & peanut butter (subbed for almond butter) for ease of mixing, then added the egg and worked it into the dry ingredients. I used half dates & half dried cherries and soaked them in a bit of hot water before adding them & the chocolate chips. 
I do agree that they might benefit from an extra egg because they are a bit crumbly... but YUMMY!!!

I’ve made these a few times and have passed the recipe on to enthusiastic friends. I do have some changes: 1/3 cup melted margarine instead of canola oil; gluten-free flour and gluten-free oats; natural peanut butter instead of almond butter; 1/2 cup coconut instead of dried cherries; bring the chocolate chips down to 1/2 cup; local honey instead of agave; 2 eggs. The mix is extremely sticky and difficult to work with so I refrigerate for 20 minutes before spooning onto the cookie sheets - this makes all the difference in the world! I also flatten the cookies before baking, with the bottom of a tumbler dipped in sugar or flour. This is a labour intensive recipe but so so good!

If I was a body builder I would like these cookies- they remind me of what a protein bar should taste like. For me and the kids, we did not care for them as a dessert or even a snack. I will not make again.

I make these frequently and freeze them for my daughter, who eats them after working out. I've made them as is or with variations - other nuts instead of walnuts, cranberries instead of cherries, dark chocolate instead of semi-sweet, for example, and these always turn out great. I also add wheat germ and an extra egg to up the protein since that is what we're after. My daughter loves them and they freeze really well. The recipe is slowly making it's way through her crew team because everyone likes them so much.

I had 1.5 cups of walnuts to use up so I used two eggs. I did not have almond butter so I used tahini. I did not add cherries. I flattened the sticky mixture before baking... Messy and time consuming. They turned out soft and delicious. I would eat these over regular chocolate chip cookies.

Thank you so much for sharing this healthy & very delicious cookie recipe.
I changed it a bit using the ingredients on hand.
peaunt butter > almond butter
1/2 cup sugar > syrup + sugar
2 eggs > 1 egg
coconut oil > canola oil
dates, processed with the wet ingredients > dried cherries
Finally baked at 350F for 12mins because I love crispy cookie.
The aroma was so nice even before baking. I couldn't stop eating but didn't feel guilty because all are healthy ingredients. Yummy!!
I'll make it again & again.

I added a little almond extract, and used pecan bits instead of grinding walnuts. Otherwise followed exactly.  Texture was perfect, soft but not too crumbly. I didn't need to pat them down, they came out great  (used a loose leaf tea scooper for the dough). Filled up 3 cookie sheets, made about 50-60 cookies total without doubling the recipe.

I doubled the recipe. Subbed out applesauce for the oil, honey for the agave, peanut butter for the almond butter and raisins for the cherries. I also added an extra egg to the mix.   I used the medium cookie scooper and it made about 4 1/2 dozen cookies. I flash froze them before baking  and stored them in ziplock bag in freezer and then just take out what I want to bake when I need them.  Excellent!

These are a very good healthy breakfast cookie.  I used honey instead of agave nectar and used melted coconut oil instead of canola oil and peanut butter instead of almond butter. 
 Honestly when I was dishing out the raw dough, I did not have high hopes for these cookies but I will definitely make these again as they  are a very tasty  snack.

These are so wonderful! I make them for our security team at church and they go over very well. I usually don't have flax meal on hand but I have flaxseed so I just grind it up in my coffee grinder and it works like a charm. I also like to add about a tablespoon of Chia seed for that extra crunch.and dried cranberries work well in place of cherries if you don't have those?

Great recipe. I modified it to be gluten free. I used ground chia instead of flax. Coconut flour and          86 xed the wheat flour. Used teice the  vanilla cinnamon and added cardomom. 

Divided the dough and put dried blueberries cherries and milk chocolate chips in one half and other half all of the former and raw organic cacao. Sooo good and very filling. 

I forgot the brown sugar and theses didn't need it. Lots of flavor without it. 
One last thing I needed to add more coconut oil and additional egg so moist enough to hold cookies together.

The first time I made these, I used pecan meal instead of ground walnuts and tahini instead of almond butter--because I wanted to use what I had on hand.  The cookies were good but dense and over-chocolatey.  The second time, I had almond butter.  The batter was a bit more crumbly.  Again, and they were over-chocolatey.  Some guests loved them; others weren't overly impressed.  What I liked was that they weren't overly sweet.

As the Allrecipes name implies, I make A LOT of cookies and  I'm the kind that believe full fat full sugar homemade cookies are good for you. That being said, THESE ARE AWESOME!!! and a very forgiving recipe. No one will know they're  "Good for you" 
I subbed almonds for walnuts, switched out the cherries for dried apricots, and used white chips instead of chocolate. I also used honey in place of agave, applesauce instead of oil, and  bumped up the baking soda a bit.  Was worried for a minute when I got them mixed up and everything looked awfully wet. Silly me! Turned my back to clean up a bit and of course the flax and oatmeal had done their thing :)and I had a nice thick dough.  Go ahead and make a batch or 2 and feel virtuous while you get your naughty on.

These breakfast cookies are excellent  with or without the chocolate chips!  I've made them often -- following the recipe exactly.  I've discovered the cookies are easier to form if you let the batter rest for about 15 minutes -- the oats and flour absorb the wet ingredients.  I've  also substituted olive oil for the canola oil and  three tablespoons of honey for the brown sugar as well as raisins for the dried cherries.  The cookies always turn out delicious and disappear very quickly!  No one ever guesses that these are  healthier  than regular  "cookies".  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I'm rating this recipe before actually making it because I have a question.  I have all the ingredients except cherries and will use cranberries instead.  My question:  I love the texture of nuts and would like to use them finely chopped.  If I do that it will change the amount of flour needed (I think). I could add ore flour or some protein powder or even some collagen peptides.  Any idea how much more flour-y type stuff would be needed?  I do love my breakfast cookies and I want to try these without ruining them by experimenting.  Not the bravest of cooks.

I just made these today.  I love cookies for breakfast (healthy).  I decided to try making the walnut flour using my Nutribullet.  I seem to have made walnut butter instead.  Used it anyway.  My agave was very old so I tossed it and used coconut sugar plus a tablespoon of water.  I might try applesauce instead of oil next time.  I also used craisins because I had them. That was the only thing I didn't have on hand.  I used a cookie scoop, got nearly 30 cookies and I flattened them before baking.  Good cookie.

Just came out of the oven!  Excellent.  Just what I was looking for - healthy and yummy.  As others, I made some substitutions due to what was available.  I used 1/2 blackstrap molasses and 1/2 honey for the sugar, applesauce for oil, added raisins and dried cranberries.  So very good.  Thank you.

I followed the recipe as is except I did not process the walnuts into flour because I like the texture of a nut in cookies.  I was a little worried when scooping the cookies onto the sheet to bake as they did not want to stick together to good.  But when baked they formed a good cookie.  I am wondering on the nutrition information is it based on 1 cookie as a serving and the recipe only making 18 cookies.

I didn't have walnuts, so I substituted pecans. I also substituted coconut oil for the fat in the recipe. They turned out really well. Next time I'll chop the cherries and reduce the chocolate chips to 3/4 cup. These are tasty and not too sweet, they are just what I was looking for.

Wonderful recipe!  Had to make it a second time and this time I was smart to double it!  I use it for a quick breakfast for my 3 yr old when in a pinch for time.  Made a few changes 2nd time around only because I didn't have all the ingredients.  Subbed coconut oil (just a health preference), used half honey and half maple syrup instead of agave.  Along with dried cherries I threw in some dried apricots.  And only because of our families needs I used gluten free flour.  Be careful to watch cooking time.  I overbaked mine and they came out to dry.  Still yummy but not as good.

These came out great. Added coconut and changed cherries into cranberries.  I also used honey instead of agave .  I didn't make the walnuts into flour just small chunks. Comes out very sticky though. But nice once they are cooked.

Really good, very nutty flavor. Great for breakfast, snack, anytime. Made with a few subs based on what I had-honey instead of agave, PB instead of almond butter, decreased oil slightly and added some applesauce(would use a little less next time). Added 1 egg (2 total)Chopped pecans and craisins in with the choc chips. Made 20 smallish cookies (medium scoop) from about 1/2 dough, froze the rest in a log for later.

I used peanut butter instead of almond butter, honey instead of agave nectar, and chopped dried apricots instead of cherries. I also used half semi-sweet chocolate and half dark. I won't be making this on a regular basis, but it's an excellent recipe. Even though the cookies are small they're really filling.

I tried to use the recipe as written but I was missing some ingredients & allergic to others. Used Pecans, Peanut Butter, 2 eggs, craisins, white chips, honey  & almond & vanilla extract..  Made them as small as possible and baked in 5 minutes. They were amazing! My grandkids & I  loved them, as did my husband & friends. I will make this again. Thank you so much for sharing!

Picky husband and not as picky four year old love these.  I think they're a bit too salty, but hubs says that's what he likes about them!  So nice to have something to munch on first thing in the morning.  And satisfy my absurd sweet tooth with some healthy tones in there!

I absolutely love these, and so does my son and niece.  Who doesn't love cookies for breakfast?  I've made some changes to the recipe to suit our tastes - substituted ground almonds for the walnuts, substituted peanut butter for the almond butter, omitted the cinnamon and fruit.  So basically what I end up with is a peanut butter chocolate chip cookie that is breakfast appropriate.  Whoo hoo!

Absolutely delicious!! I made a couple of minor changes: I substituted honey for the blue agave nectar like some other reviewers suggested. I also halved the recipe, but still used a whole egg. Finally, I left out the cranberries and chocolate chips and substituted 1/3 cup of raisins. A half recipe made 11 large cookies. They are soft, chewy and perfect with a cup of coffee. I can't wait to try them frozen. These will be perfect for a quick breakfast on our way out the door to early morning soccer games. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a handy, easily adapted recipe. I subbed peanut butter for almond butter, honey for agave nectar, and used only half the chocolate chips.  Fabulous.  I feel quite comfortable feeding them to my 2 year old and snacking on a few myself!

Just made these and I can't stop eating them! I too made some substitutions. I used apple sauce instead of the oil since I thought there was already enough fat in the recipe. I used 2 eggs instead of 1, and  I substituted honey for the agave. I also used half oats, half quinoa flakes instead of the full amount of oats, used dried cranberries instead of cherries and only put in 3/4 cup of chocolate chips. The dough looked quite moist so I also threw in 2 tablespoons each of chia and hemp seeds. Soooooo good!

Great basic recipe! The first batch I made as is and they were good,but a bit dry and bland. The second batch, I added another egg, a tsp. of molasses, and 1/2 c cocoa. They turned out great! A bit high on the fat content I'll have to attempt to lower it next time around.

I made this 3 times, with revisions each time.  The first time I forgot the oats. They were  a little dense but yummy.  The second time I made it with one and a half cups oats as directed. Overpoweringly oat-y, like  something you would feed a horse.  Third time, 3/4 cup oats --- perfect.  Delicious but still had that oat taste that reminds you it's healthy, and you could taste the other ingredients.    All 3 times, used peanut butter instead of almond, reduced sugar craisins in place of cherries (less sugar andw more fiber than dried cherries, which are sugared), honey instead of agave.  Also used melted butter instead of canola oil (we don't have cholesterol issues).  The third time I accidentally used 1/2 cup melted butter instead of 1/4,  with the result that  they looked and tasted like the kind of premium cookies that you make for special occasions.   If you want cookies your kids (and anyone else) will vacuum up, reduce the oats,  increase the butter (instead of oil), and don't tell anyone that they are chock-full of healthy ingredients.

I think these cookies should be renamed your daily fiber cookies!  I made three changes, one by accident. First I didn't process the walnuts, because I didn't read the recipe in advance and in place of the walnuts I used pistachios and coconut (half-cup each).  Maybe because of this mistake, the dough didn't hold together the best, although I also used dark chips that were a little bigger than regular semi-sweets, nonetheless, I added a second egg and all turned out great!

I used Nutella instead of almond butter, 1/2 honey 1/2 water instead of the nectar, added a bit more oil, smushed them into a cookie pan to break later and make delicious and nutritious granola bars.

Excellent recipe, but 375 was a bit too hot in my oven, 350 worked much better to prevent burning on the bottom of the cookies.

These are a favorite in my house! I have made them several times. I literally have to hide them and ration them out to my boyfriend so he won't eat all of them! I substitute 1 cup of sweetened coconut flakes instead of the chocolate chips and it gives it a nice sweetness and a little coconut flavor! Yummm!! I also manage to get at least 2 dozen cookies out of one batch so it cuts down on the calories per cookie ;) Thank you for this delicious treat!

We love these cookies!  I make them nice and big and my daughter eats them for breakfast most mornings.  Or it's a great snack or even meal on the go.  I also used honey instead of agave because I didn't have any agave.  I only make them in double batches because we go through them so fast! Thanks for sharing Iris!

Delish! both my girls gobbled them up. They were so happy to eat them for breakfast on the go with a sip of milk. Much better than a cereal bar...without preservatives. I tried coconut oil and 2 eggs. I didnt have a food processor so I had chopped walnuts in them. I liked the texture this way. It was more satisfying like a granola bar. Love how healthy these are too. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

I made this recipe - substituting more flour for the ground almonds and excluded dried fruit and chocolate - and read the reviews while the cookies were in the oven.  I was then really nervous because the batter was dry - but they came out great!!  No crumbling.  I did not flatten the cookies.  375 at 9 minutes.  Delicious right out of the oven and still delicious the next day.

WOW!  What I changed:  no flax (I don't really care for it, and didn't have any on hand), cut chocolate chips in half as per other reviews, and added an extra egg to make the mixture more creamy smooth.  Very tasty, very filling, and the kids (2 and 5) loved them!  Next time I may try it with a homemade peanut butter instead of almond butter, just because I personally prefer peanut butter.  Doesn't really need chocolate chips, it's plenty sweet without.

I didn't flatten the cookies, just let them cool for a few minutes on the baking sheet.  They didn't fall apart.  Probably because of the extra egg.

4.5 stars! Pretty yummy, esp if you like almond butter/peanut butter. I made a few subs: pecans instead of walnuts, coconut oil instead of canola oil, peanut butter instead of almond butter, dried blueberries instead of dried cherries and I added poppy seeds to the dry mix. I made 1/2 the batch and then remembered I had a very ripe small banana so I added that to the 2nd 1/2 of the  batch, esp since the batter was a little bit dry and crumbly. I think the banana version was a little better since it was a little more moist and the banana flavor masked a little bit of the PB flavor.

I made this exactly as written.  The cookies taste really good, but they're too crumbly.  I had a lot of trouble getting them to stick together to put on the cookie sheet.  I wish I had read the reviews first; I would have added another egg.  Also, 1 cup of chocolate chips is way too much.  They didn't want to mix in to the dough.  After I had put all my cookies on the sheet to bake, I still had at least half a cup of chocolate chips in the bottom of the bowl.  Next time I make these I will use two eggs and half a cup of chocolate chips.  Mini chocolate chips might incorporate better too.

I too made some substitutions. I used peanut butter and added golden raisins and currants, I also subbed whole wheat for reg. flour because I enjoy the crispy texture it lends.This is my favorite healthy cookie recipe!

Yummy and healthier than your normal oatmeal cookie!  I used peanut butter instead of almond butter, omitted the cinnamon and the cherries.  I also baked for 12 minutes, switching racks due to uneven heating in my oven.  Chewy and delicious!

Fantastic ,healthy option as a treat for the family. My teenagers and husband loved them. I had to substitute peanut butter for the almond butter because they have a tree nut allergy. Also, added an egg so they wouldn't be crumbly. They came out perfect and I will definitely be making them again.

I couldn't get my fingers out of the almond butter mix. It is THAT good. I did, however, make some subtle changes. Instead of Canola Oil, I used 2 tbsp of softened virgin coconut oil. I used almost 3/4 cup of semi-sweet choc chip morsels, used honey instead of agave nectar, and didn't have any dried cherries on hand, so i used Craisins (reduced sugar). I am not crazy about putting Craisins in this recipe! I will use dried cherries in the next batch that I definitely plan on baking.  I give this recipe five stars all the way !

Amazing!  I used raisins instead of cherries but they were so good I ended up making them again as a gift for friends.

I double the batch, making a few substitutions, less chocolate chips and adding golden rasins, then bake on parchment paper.  I freeze a batch individually.  They make quick grab & go breakfasts after 30-45 sec in the microwave.

Fantastic recipe!!My toddlers and husband loved them! I did make a few substitutions and they still came out perfect! I substituted  almonds for the walnuts,peanut butter for almond butter,honey for blue agave nectar,and added 1/2 tsp more of vanilla extract. I omitted the dry cherries. I couldn't  be happier with this recipe, now I dont feel guilty giving my kids cookies to eat! Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I Left out the nuts due to allergies and substituted coconut oil for the canola oil. Instead of chocolate chips I used white chocolate chips( 1/2 a cup) and the cookies are yummy !!  Hope they are as healthy as they are delicious .....

This is a very tasty recipe! I used coconut oil instead of canola, almond meal instead of flax, and left out the dried fruit. Also added an egg. Everyone in my house likes them! (Mom of 4 kids ages 5 and under).

My family liked these.  I subbed natural peanut butter for almond, decreased chocolate chips by 1/3 cup, and subbed applesauce for the oil.  I had a problem rolling these into balls because they were too soft and sticky.  Maybe next time I will first put them in the fridge for a bit.  I used a tablespoon to scoop the dough and that worked okay.

Absolutely delicious and yes, perfect with my morning coffee!!  Didn't have walnuts (will get some for next time) so used chopped pecans but did not grind them into a flour since I prefer more texture & a chunkier cookie.  Substituted 1/2 cup applesauce (homemade) for the canola oil and also used 3/4 cup of a dried berry blend(cherries, blueberries & cranberries)and only used 3/4 cup chocolate chips.  Also added 2 Tbsp chia seed to the dry mixture as suggested by another reviewer. Will definitely make again and again!  Thanks IrisMac for such a yummy recipe!!

I was excited to make this recipe. Spent a lot of money on the ingredients.  It did not taste like cookies rather granola bars.  Will try to make again hopefully it'll turn out better.

Wow!!!!  These taste like gourmet cookies, not something that's actually a good nutritional choice.  I should have made a double batch... I think they'll be gone in 24 hours.

Needs more flavor.  Made the recipe as is except substituted dried cranberries.  It needs more spice and flavoring, maybe some coconut and less ground flax seeds.  Will probably not make again. Was hoping to find a good snack cookie.

We loved this recipe. I used two eggs based on reading other people's recommendations. Also used pecans instead of walnuts because that's our own personal preference. They turned out wonderfully - such a nice soft texture, very flavorful, and with a little bit of sweetness. The chocolate cherry combination is very nice. Ours were perfectly baked at eight minutes. I really like that they're not as processed as the granola bars you buy at the store. Will definitely make these again. I ended up with 40 cookies, not 18 like the recipe said. My husband was happy about that!

I cannot tell you how happy I am with this recipe!  I follow a very clean diet and it was so nice to find a recipe that didn't taste like cardboard.  I followed it exactly, including the "smooshing" right when they came out of the oven.  These are best eaten slightly warmed (when right out of the oven or nuked for 10 seconds).  My kids LOVED these and so did I!  The only thing I would say is that I did not have parchment paper and so I just sprayed my cookie sheet.  They only took 7 minutes in my oven.

Delicious and nutritious! These are easy to make. I did not add the cherries, since I didn't have any on hand. Loved the taste and will be making these again.

The end result tasted nice but I wouldn't make them again as per the recipe. I had problems with them crumbling and falling apart prior to, and during baking.

These are very good, filling cookies. I followed the directions to a T. I will make again and try to sub out the oil with applesauce.

The reason I give it four stars is because they cannot even compare to my grandma's oatmeal chocolate chip cookies (which are totally unhealthy, but unbeatable in flavor). I know I shouldn't compare these two, but if it is called a cookie, it has to hold its own!

Good recipe. I made a couple of substitutions based on what was in my cabinets; chopped apricots instead of cherries and pecans instead of walnuts. Turned out good. My only criticism is that the chocolate chips were too many.  I could have easily used a third or half cup instead of a whole cup and there still would have been plenty. I would also recommend using mini chips instead of regular size chocolate chips because they were so big they kept falling out of the mixture instead of blending into it. I had to keep pushing them into the dough balls.

I was pleasantly surprised with how tasty these came out. Delicious and healthy! I did substitute raisins for dried cranberries which turned out great. When mixing the dry ingredients into the wet there just wasn't enough moisture and I  added a little water to get the job done.

Substituted honey for the agave nectar. The dough was rather crumbly so I had a bit of trouble with it. I still found the taste appealing,and even used the crumbly baked bits as 'granola' over yogurt

Holy Moly these are good! Plus you don't have to feel bad about eating them! 

I skipped the oil and used one banana and 1/2 cup apple sauce. I also added 1/2 cup sliced almonds, subbed honey for agave, and I used raisins instead of cherries. 

Hubby loved them! I will definitely make again. I like how this recipe can be modified to what you have on hand. Can't wait to make them again!

I made substitutions as well, peanut butter for the almond butter, honey for the agave, wheat germ instead of flax seed and dried cranberries instead of cherries and they still came out awesome.  I'll be making more soon but i think i'll try raisins next time.  The only ingredient I'd change is to cut the choc. chips in half, but that's my personal preference...five star recipe.

These are quite delicious and quite forgiving cookies. I made mine with pecans instead of walnuts and also added dried cranberries. I would eat two for breakfast post-workout and I had to keep a secret stash because the hubs loved them soo much! I've made them twice so far and both times a little different but equally delicious!

These cookies are great! I found that processing the walnuts made more of a walnut butter than a flour, so I added the whole wheat flour and flax to the processor and it turned back into the texture of flour. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and the cookies were easy to make and delicious.

I've made these a couple of times now and they are excellent; a huge hit with everyone who tries them.  My only suggestion is to use mini chocolate chips instead of the regular size ones. I thought it made mixing the dough and forming it into balls a little easier. Delish!

These are YUMMY! I used tahini (sesame seed paste) in place of peanut butter, coconut oil for the oil part, and raisins instead of cherries. I didn't add the cinnamon. The cookies are soft and delicious. My dough/batter wasn't thick like the recipe said, so I was a bit worried, but they came out great.
