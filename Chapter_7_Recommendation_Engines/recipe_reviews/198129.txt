WOW,I have never been the first reviewer before. Anyway this is good stuff. Not too spicy at all. Even the 4 yo ate it up, so I think next time I might add a touch more cayenne. I even used some wheat chex as 1 substitution as I had them already. You can never have too  much fiber. I will def make it again.

:( sad story: I made this tasty recipe, and (surprise) added garlic powder, dried minced onion, pretzels and more cayenne. Microwaved it 2 mins. Stirred. Microwaved 2 mins again… and it burned!!! Watch your stuff- follow the directions. Make sure to stop when it “just begins to turn brown.” Thankfully I only made a half recipe, so I didn’t waste too much, and I was able to salvage some b/c the top was still okay. Still sad though b/c it tasted really good. Will try it again, this time making the full amount and stirring often.

Very disappointed. I stirred after 2 minutes and everything seemed fine, but after 4 minutes the mix was burned beyond repair. You really need to keep a close eye on it and stir more frequently. I wish there would have been instructions on how to make in the oven, because I do think the flavor combinations sound delicious.

I followed the recipe exactly and wish we'd taken some of the reviews into account.  This was tasty enough, but not what I was looking for.  With the appellation "Spiced" I was hoping for something, you know, spiced.  This was too sweet for me.

Really good flavor without being too spicy!  I used cheerios, corn chex, and walnuts since that is all I had on hand.

Great snack, quick easy recipe.  I added a little more cayenne pepper and it was still not too hot.  Great flavor just the right amount of sweetness.  We really enjoyed it.

Great flavor with a little bit of sweet and a little spicy, but just the right amount of both. Someone had said they burnt theirs, so I just made sure I stirred every minute until it was done. Just right!

I used to make this yonks ago, but mine was made with the addition of cherrios and a worcestershire, butter & garlic mixture. As I recall it was a great hit on bridge nights and was often asked for the recipe. Fr David+
