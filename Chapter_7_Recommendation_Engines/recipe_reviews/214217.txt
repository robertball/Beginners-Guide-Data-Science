This was a very tasty and EASY recipe.  Didn't change a thing as a true review should be in my opinion and we LOVED it over rice.  Even better 2 days later when I mixed the pork mixture with the rice and warmed it up in a skillet.

Excellent recipe, quick to put together. I added the pork chops frozen and upped the cook time by 3 hours. We ate it over rice in complete silence, we didn't want to stop! Next time I'll add fresh onion, and add pea pods at the end or asparagus. Make plenty of sauce!!!

Extremely easy and quick to make, few ingredients, and very yummy! I added more red pepper flakes to mine to make it spicier and more veggies. Orange peppers and broccoli are a great addition. I think something crunchy in texture was definitely missing, perhaps crushed peanuts added for garnish. Next time I'm going to try this with a little cocounut milk and cilantro too. Should be wonderful!

Delicious! Very simple to make, really.   I made this almost exactly the same as the recipe--I used 1 enormous yellow bell pepper (when chopped it was like 2 normal-sized peppers) and also added broccoli to the pot. I also added a smidge more crushed red pepper since we like spicy food and I found out later my husband snuck in another spoonful of peanut butter while it was cooking.  The flavors were great--sweet and spicy and a little smokey somehow, all at once. Adding broccoli is a must in my opinion as it sucks up the sauce and just explodes with flavor in your mouth. I put in the veggies in the beginning as the recipe states and thought they held up pretty well--no crunch of course, but they didn't cook into mush, they were just really soft which was nice.   Served over brown rice and may add carrots or some more peppers next time for more veggies, as we definitely had plenty of sauce to go around. Definitely a keeper for us!

3-3.5 stars.  This was very easy, different and has potential to be even better.  I think some crushed peanuts and sliced green onions for garnish would go a long way with this dish.  I added my peppers at the end so they would retain some crunch.

This was great! The only thing I did different was cube the pork into one inch pieces before I put in slow cooker, no need to shred! Served with rice noodles and ginger carrots (from this website).  Next time, I may add a little bit more red pepper spice, but it was still great!

I thought this recipe was pretty good and had a nice flavor. I used unsalted all natural peanut butter and had a hard time blending the sauce so I used my immersion blender on the sauce to combine everything before adding the pork chops. I also used one green pepper and one red pepper, adding them 1.5 hours before serving (when I shredded the pork). This allowed the peppers to cook and absorb some flavor but not be mushy.

Yummy served atop Jasmine rice....don't shred the meat! Cut boneless chops into strips and don't add the bell peppers until the last half-hour of cooking or they will disintegrate.  I also cut the ginger in half...way too much for only 1 lb. of meat, and although I LOVE garlic, some of my cloves were pretty big so I only used 4, which I thought gave it plenty of garlic flavor.  Sprinkled some fresh chopped cilantro on top & a squeeze of fresh lime, too.  Enjoy with an ice cold beer! :-)

YUM!! Delicious!! I followed the recipe very closely - I used chunky peanut butter, and used half the crushed red pepper flakes. I liked the chunky peanut butter in this very much, and I probably could have added another shake of the crushed red pepper but my SS doesn't like anything too spicy so I have to be careful of that.  This was a great quick meal to set up, perfect for when the football game is on in the afternoon :)

Wow, this was great!  I used boneless chicken instead of pork.  I reduced the honey to 1 tablespoon and used one clove of garlic.  I added one diced onion.  Very nice flavor.

My family loved this. I needed to double the recipe which ended up with the sauce being a bit too soupy. Next time I will cut back on the liquids a bit when doubling. Didn't have peppers, so I added broccoli, carrots, and pea pods (towards the end of the cooking time so the veggies would still have some firmness). So yummy! Will definitely make again.

Very yummy! My husband and I both enjoyed this a lot.
I added the peppers in for the last hour and served with rice.

The family proclaimed this "excellent".  I made it as written. I do use low sodium soy sauce and chicken broth.

Wow! So good!  I will be making this again for sure!  My bell peppers went bad in the heat we were having before I made this so I made it without.  And I used crunchy peanut butter vs. creamy because it's all I had.  This was fabulous!!!

This was very good.  I wanted to try this after I tried noodles with peanut sauce and was amazed at how delicious it was.  It sounds so odd!  I used green peppers instead of red as that is what I had and dried ginger instead of fresh.  I also cut the honey to two tablespoons because my husband does not like sweet meat.  I almost didn't risk this recipe at all but with only two tablespoons of honey it was fine for his taste.

I liked this a lot - I made it spicier and substituted fish sauce for half of the soy sauce.  I served over rice and toped with crushed peanuts and scallions.  I also used chunky peanut butter.  I will make this again, but I will add more veggies like carrots and snap peas.  I agree with previous reviews suggesting adding veggies near the end because pork tends to be dry and needs to cook for a long time, but veggies would be mushy with that long cook time.

I had 1 pound of leftover roasted pork tenderloin leftover so I thought I would put it to work using this recipe. I mixed the sauce ingredients together in the slow cooker crock on low.  I added one small onion, sliced thinly to the sauce.  While that was heating, I sliced the pork and peppers.  Whisked the sauce to combine and added the pork.  Let cook until hot and then added the peppers.  Covered and let cook for about an hour.  This was very good.  I would think this would be a good recipe / method to put together before heading to sports practice. I served this with Uncle Ben's Basmati rice that is ready in 10 minutes.

So yummy! My boyfriend asked me if i could start making it every week, and extra for leftovers for lunch! Cooked on low for 2 hours, and high for 2 more. I used a pork tenderloin, instead of pork chops. I omitted the 2 red peppers, as I didn't have any one hand. I added fresh broccoli, after about the first hour n a half. Served over brown rice with crushed peanuts and green onion! Spicy & savory! Mmmm! Will try next time with PB2(peanut flour), to slash the fat, even if it is a healthy one.

My family made this the other night and we did not care for it. The pork was dry, the red peppers were mushy, and the sauce was just bad. Two of our family's favorite recipes are peanut butter and soy sauce based, so we were really looking forward to this. We even put some in the dog's bowl and she wouldn't eat it!

Very good recipe.  We added more pepper flakes and more ginger.  As someone suggested we added broccoli and yellow peppers.  Delish over brown rice.

This was so good! I was a little worried about the sweetness of the peanut butter and the honey being too much but mine didn't ending up tasting very sweet when it was finished. I followed the recipe pretty much exactly. the only thing I did was add a 1/2 teaspoon of siracha (because I was worried about the sweetness). I will definitely be making this again and again! Thank you so much!!

Wasn't my favorite recipe.  The flavor wasn't quite right.  I don't know if it was the soy sauce or what, but didn't have the nice flavor of a peanut sauce I'm used to.  Would try teriaki & fish sauce maybe instead of the soy sauce?

This was great.  I doubled the recipe and added cilantro and broccoli.  I added the veggies in the middle, not at the beginning.  I think coconut milk would also be a great addition.  The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the pork chop toughness.  The flavor was amazing though.

Loved this! I used one red pepper and one green and added them when there was about 90 minutes of cooking time so they wouldn't get mushy. I also used low sodium soy sauce and natural peanut butter. We served ours over brown rice.

Fantastic.   Will make again but tweaked it a little cutting down on soy sauce, and used 2 country ribs for more flavor.  Also added more spice such as Penzy's Bangkok Seasoning for added heat.

I followed the recipe just as it was, but I did wait until the last 20 minutes to add the red bell pepper. I served it over brown jasmine rice and garnished it with chopped green onions. It was absolutely delicious!!

This was ok for my husband, and the pork was extremely tender, however the consistency of the peanut butter and sauce was atrocious. I didn't care much for this recipe at all. It reminded me of a type of curry paste. I agree to save the peppers until last so they still have crunch. If the cook the whole time, there wont be any peppers left!

Really enjoyed this dish !! made this in summer with pork and it was fantastic. Just made it again a few days ago and used chicken instead and that came out really well !! Just added a little more peanut butter and a whole lot of  diced veggies. This was real good !!

Easy, tasty, and stuff I almost always have on hand.  I wish the sauce would have been thicker, tho, as the pork was a little dry and needed a thicker sauce to cling to it.  I had a pork loin roast that I cut into chops, and since I had run out of dry red pepper flakes I used Thai red chili paste.  Also served with lots of limes to add sourness.  Will definitely make again!

I cubed the pork before putting in slow cooker, and waited to add the vegetables so they did not get soggy.  It was great served over noodles, and you may want to make extra sauce as well!

Great recipe.  I did not change a thing.  Family and friends loved it.  One suggestion for anyone making this is to put the peppers in 4.5 hours into cooking. Putting them at the beginning makes the peppers break up in the cooking process and all you're left with is the skin.  The recipe still tasted great, but I would just change that for myself in the future.

I used 2 tsp. ground ginger and left out the red peppers. Was so easy to make and really good! Would be just as good with chicken.

Very good recipe - we loved it. I think it could use a little less soy sauce; I used less than the 1/3 cup and it was still a bit too salty for my taste. I would also recommend adding some more vegetables. I put in sliced carrot at the beginning and lightly steamed green beans with about a half hour left. Both were good additions; it was nice to have some crunch from the green beans.

I use this recipe maybe once a month, with varied success that's probably completely my fault. Sometimes it comes out too soupy, and sometimes too dry. When it comes out well or soupy it's great and we eat it over rice. The peppers do tend to shrink down to unrecognizable pepperyness, but we also cook it for 6-8 hours depending on who is home on time.

This wasn't too bad, but I don't think my family really cared for it. I added my sliced peppers and a sliced onion about 2 hours before the dish was finished cooking so that they wouldn't be mushy.

I made this just as the recipe states except that I added the peppers toward the end and topped it off with some cilantro.  Great flavor!  A little darker/smokier than if it had coconut milk in it.  My husband and 3-year-old both ate it up.  I'll definately be making this again!

Easy and delicious!  I followed the recipe almost exactly but took the advice of other reviewers and added the peppers in the last 90 minutes.  I also added some broccoli.  This is one of my new favorite things to make!

Absolutely awesome! Even my Thai wife liked it! I added half an onion thinly sliced and I used chunky peanut butter (that's what I had on hand), otherwise I followed the recipe. Just to others who may try this recipe: I like my garlic, but if you don't, cut back to maybe 3 or 4 cloves.

I loved the dish, as did my elderly mother-in-law who taste is geared toward Italian cuisine. Per the suggestion of mrs.embee, I added scallions and crushed peanuts. I will certainly make this one again.

Instead of peppers (which I don't like) I used a bag of frozen broccoli and cauliflower.  That was the only change I made.  This is a great recipe.  I am sure for those of you who like peppers the recipe  is perfect  as is.

Excellent. I don’t have a slow cooker so I cooked it on low heat on the stove for 2 hours, and I had to add more water in the middle. I added roasted broccoli when it was done and served over brown rice.

Cut the honey a bit.  Melted the PB with the other ingredients 1st.  Put carrots and pork and cooked on low 2 hours.  Added lots of broccoli, cooked for another hour 20 min, then added the peppers and zucchini.  I wanted to beef it up with lots of veggies and will do this again next time but will double the sauce.

12/16: R&S, K,A,D,R. Everyone loved. Deven had 2nds! Excellent sauce, tripled amount and had enough left to use for another meal(will try over noodles).  Sauce creamy, not soupy. Used 2 pork loins instead of chops. Cooked one in slow cooker which was a bit shredded when sliced. The other one baked in oven, sliced nicely and put into sauce in slow cooker. Wouldn't recommend shredding. May need to cook less to prevent shredding upon slicing, 4-5hrs instead of 5-6 on low. Served sliced with sauce and butternut barley risotto as a side.  Next time may use crunchy peanut butter, and serve with brown or Thai Jasmine rice. Definitely will garnish with finely chopped peanuts and sliced scallions. Also per reviews could add other veggies such as broccoli florets.

Super easy to make and taste yummy. I did braise the chops before adding to the crock pot to lock in the flavor. I also added snow peas along with the peppers and used crunchy peanut butter. I will definitely make again and add even more vegetables.  Thinking of trying it with a pork roast instead of chops.

Tasty and simple to make I did not add the pepper at the beginning as stated in the directions and I am glad, even though I added them in half way through the cooking time they were still a little mushy . I will definitely make this again but next time I might add a little more peanut butter and add the peppers an hour and half before the pork is done.

We enjoyed this.  Used one red bell and 1/2 green bell I had lying around.  Added green onion and cilantro at the end.  Added about 1/2 tsp xantham gum directly to the crock in the last 20 minutes to thicken it up.  Served with  rice

Some people say use crunchy, I would stick with smooth, I always add more red pepper just because I like mine spicier. This also works great with a pork shoulder.

OMG. This is my new favorite meal! I followed the recipe exactly except for omitting the red pepper flakes. This is seriously the best pork recipe I could have stumbled upon. I mixed the sauce right in the crockpot and then added the pork. I cooked it on low for about 6 hours, then added a large head of chopped broccoli and about half a bag of shredded carrots. I wasn't patient enough to wait for the carrots to cook all the way, so they were a little crunchy. But I will DEFINITELY make this again. I will probably add another  spoonful of peanut butter next time to make the sauce a little richer.

I made this for my husband who is a huge fan of Thai food and he could'nt get enough. I added a little more peanut butter(about 2tbsp) during the last hour of cooking to thicken sauce.

Great flavor, but really needs some extra steps — not extra ingredients, though — to take it up a notch.  In order of importance: (1) Don't add the peppers until an hour or so before the end, otherwise they completely disintegrate. This is a must. (2) I suggest removing the sauce from the slow cooker and degreasing it so it's smoother and not so oily. (3) The sauce was a bit too thin. Next time I will try thickening it with some corn starch. (4) I found that I preferred cutting the pork into pieces rather than shredding it.

this recipe is so easy you just take all the ingredients and you throw them into the crock pot and it cooks up a delicious meal! I went ahead and use all 4 different colors of peppers in this dish and I also up the amount of peanut butter and honey and spices and the chicken broth. I think this recipe could use an extra kick as it doesn't have a whole lot of spice to it so if you're into spicy make sure to add something of your choice for additional heat!! I serve this dish with long brown rice and I highly recommend it.

This was delicious!  Very easy to make and the whole house smelled great!  I imagine it's the kind of thing that would be even better the next day but I'll never know because we ate all of it.  I left out the red pepper flakes and added a chopped onion instead and it turned out great.  This is being added to the rotation!

I like this a lot! Goes well over rice for sure, and sauce is easy to double if that's your thing. I use a little less of the red pepper flakes but that's just because I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy things. They add a lot of good flavour.

This was a very easy recipe to get together with ingredients that I keep in my pantry.  I added the peppers to the slow cooker about half way into the cooking and they were still a little softer than I would have liked.  I also thought the sauce was too thin, so, I removed the pork, added a cornstarch slurry, & brought the liquid to a boil to thicken the sauce.  I then added the pork back to the sauce to warm through.   I topped with some fresh green onion for a little crunch.  Both my husband and I liked the flavor of the dish, but, thought the flavor profile was missing something. Perhaps a little fresh cilantro?  Overall we thought it was a pretty good recipe and I would make it again.

I really like how the sauce tastes. I usually use pork tenderloin. I doubled the crushed red pepper flakes to become a little bit more hot. As other reviews say: just put the bell peppers (which I used half red and half green) in the last hour, otherwise it become too much softened and not good. I also added some sliced mushrooms by the last half hour.

I made exactly as directed and it was very good.  I shredded the pork chops into medium sized chunks after about five hours, then cooked for another hour, during which time the pork absorbed some of the sauce.  I served it over brown rice the first night, then over some whole wheat pasta the next night.  I will definitely make again.

Delicious! I used sodium-free chicken broth. Next time I will add tapioca to thicken the sauce. I also don't add peppers until the last hour so they aren't too overcooked. When whole pork loins are on sale for less than $2/lb. here, I buy a whole one and cut it into chops, making this an economical meal!

I followed the recipe, but as other suggested added vegetables closer to the end. At 4 hours with just meat and sauce, the pork was 200º F and shreddable. Then I added 3 carrots sliced, 2 small broccoli head florets, a red bell pepper sliced, and an orange bell pepper sliced, then cooked for another 1:15. I ended up doubling the sauce to account for all of the vegetables, but next time I would omit the doubled ginger and red pepper flakes. If you really like ginger and spicy, I'd suggest doubling the sauce as-is. It made 6 hearty servings with the extras, served over rice.

This was a very tasty dish although very spicey.  Made exactly as written except only had one red pepper and followed other suggestions to put peppers in recipe later.  Also had 1 1/2 pounds of boneless pork chops frozen together so when thawed used all.  The house smelled heavenly while cooking.  Did 8 hours on low, added peppers four hours in, shredded pork and returned to sauce at 7 hours.  Served over rice.   Next time, I would double the sauce (except red pepper flakes as dish was quite hot), and make sure I have two red peppers.

This was my first time using peanut butter in a savory dish & I discovered that I don't care for it at all(not the fault of the recipe, just my personal taste). That being said, I'm reviewing this on the other family member's opinions. No one was overwhelmed w/this. They thought it could use for heat(spice) &, oddly, the pork didn't absorb a lot of the flavor. I WILL say that it was easy to throw together & the meat shredded itself as I stirred.

We really liked this.  I had some bone in pork chops I needed to use, and just eliminated the chicken broth.  Then just took the bones out once they cooked down.  I made a lot, and we served it over rice and had plenty for leftovers.  I didn't make too many changes this time, but it seems like a pretty versatile recipe and I'll probably play around more in the future.

This was delicious, but I would cut down on the broth and add some vinegar and/or lime juice to make it taste more like a Thai peanut butter sauce.

Very good, very satisfying. I did veer from the recipe: I did not use chicken broth but instead subbed a can of coconut milk. Did not use honey, but brown sugar. I did not put the peppers in the slow cooker but rather mixed them with olive oil, lemon juice, salt and then broiled them (with onions) to vary the texture.

How exciting to find something to do with pork chops in the crockpot! I wasn't completely blown away by this, but I liked it enough that I could see adding it to our rotation. I'll up all of the spices a bit next time, as I would have liked a stronger flavor from the crushed red pepper and ginger.

This was really good.  I cut the pork into small cubes thinking it would be fine not to shread the pork. After cooking, I didn't like the pork in small cubes.  I shredded and that did the trick.  We served with rice noodles.  It made great leftovers for work the next day.

This is delicious and SO easy! To be fair, though, I didn't measure the peanut butter, ginger or crushed pepper. I just kept adding until it looked/smelled (and later, tasted) right. And, I left the pork cubed rather and shredding it. Served over rice and it's a hit!

Followed recipe exact.  Thought it was excellent over stir fried rice and veggies.  Will make again.

Found the flavour of the broth too strong -- perhaps depends on the type of soy sauce used. Would definitely recommend using low sodium. Not a keeper for us either way but glad I tried it and it was okay for a change.
