Great. My second time making yeast bread. I mixed this in my KitchenAid. Used fresh garlic, 1/2 grated and 1/2 shredded parmesan, and added Italian herb blend. I didn't have any cornmeal, but baked it on parchment and it turned out fine. Thanks!

We all enjoyed this tasty bread Cookie. I used garlic powder instead of the salt and added in some Italian seasonings. I brushed the top with an egg wash and sprinkled on more garlic powder and sesame seeds. House smelled so good while it was baking. Yum and thanks!

Awesome italian bread!  We loved it!  The texture was perfect.  The only changes I made were: added some italian seasoning to the dough and used parmesan b/c I didn't have any romano cheese.  The aroma of this bread baking was incredible!  The Hubster said it was the best bread he's ever had.  Thanks for the recipe!  :)

I made this today, adding in a tsp. of italian seasoning, used plain salt, and added garlic powder and onion powder. I proofed my yeast in my Kitchen Aid mixer's bowl for ten minutes with the sugar, then added in all the dry ingredients, and kneaded the dough with the bread hook for five minutes. I then 
formed it into a loaf and plopped it into a greased loaf pan and covered it with a damp towel and let it rise on the hot oven for an hour or so. It looks great! I plan on pairing this loaf with the Meaty Spaghetti Sauce from this site.

Really delicious. Moist and warm, add a little butter and it was perfect! I may play with the recipe next time (add more cheese!).

this bread was wonderful. everyone in my family really enjoyed it. my husband says it tastes like store-bought bread. i have tried to make other types of bread in the past and failed miserably. this one is so easy it's hard to screw it up. you can't really taste the garlic or the cheese, but i'm sure they do something for it. i will be using this recipe often. perhaps next time i will put some parmesan on top. thanks for the keeper recipe.

This was amazing! I did use real garlic and parmesan since that was all I had. The texture is lovely and perfect, and the flavour is divine. Will certainly make again and we also want to try it as breadsticks.

I had my doubts about this bread since it is made in so little time (I love making sourdough bread that takes days for the flavor to develop!) but was very pleased with this recipe!  It has lots of flavor for it's short time rising!  I made it to go with our Christmas Eve Bouillabaisse and it was a hit!  I sliced open the cooled loaves, smeared with garlic butter and shoved them under the broiler.  We used them to sop up the soup and it was EXCELLENT!  Thanks for the great recipe, Cookie... it will be my go-to when I need same day bread!

I had great results with this bread! The reason I gave it 4 stars is because it says it is ready in 40 minutes but it took about 2 hours and 20 minutes.  I chose this recipe because of the time it promised and just started making the bread without reading the whole recipe.  We ended up having dinner at 10:00 due to problem with the time.  Also I had to add a lot of extra flour. That said the bread turned out wonderful.  It was crunchy and crust on the outside and soft and moist on the inside.  Oddly enough although the inside was soft, Au Ju from a french dip did not make the bread soggy or fall apart.  My husband said it was the best french dip he'd ever had.

Great recipe! I did use fresh Parm instead of Romano cheese but other than that followed the recipe. Turned out wonderful! The second time I made it I turned it into a pepperoni bread by rolling the dough out.. layering sliced pepperoni and motz cheese.. then rolled it up like a jelly roll and baked. SO SO yummy!

I have never made bread without a bread machine before today, and was very nervous about how it was going to turn out....but it came out GREAT! It was amazingly easy, and turned out wonderfully despite my imprecise measurements. I just ate a slice, and I'm thrilled! Now I have to try to avoid eating the rest of the loaf today...

This bread was good and moist,although mine didn't rise. The taste was excellent, used a clove of fresh garlic (what I had on hand)-so I used 1 1/2 t salt and added a 1/2 t Italian seasoning.I will also say I used my bread machine to make the dough.

I'm so sorry to say that this recipe is not foolproof. I consider myself an average cook, but I am a novice at making bread loaves, so I'm still giving it 3 stars in acknowledgment that some of the fault may be mine. 

I followed the instructions to the letter. The dough worked VERY nicely--not at all sticky like some. It rose nicely and shaped easily. I cooked the lower end of the cook time, but the loaves came out very dark (scorched) on top. Perhaps I missed something when brushing with water, but that area was what looked so strange.

I cut into one of the loaves to see how it turned out. The inside was soft, but just okay so far as the taste went. I could taste the cheese, but I think some Italian seasonings or perhaps garlic butter would make a world of difference in pepping it up.

I'll try the recipe again and report back if any adjustments on my part make it turn out better. Again, more experienced cooks may have great luck with this, but I'm glad I didn't bank on it turning out right the first time.

This was really good. I made it as directed, except to add italian herbs to the dough. I also brushed the top of the bread with an egg wash, as another someone else suggested, and then sprinkled with additional parmesan cheese. This made a huge difference; it added a really good flavor. Thanks for the great recipe, and I will be making it again!

Very good loaves of bread. I didn't have garlic salt so used garlic powder and upped the salt to 1t. The dough was very sticky so I did end up adding maybe a 1/4 cup more of flour. We had this with minestrone soup and it was wonderful. Thanks for the recipe.

Very nice! This is my first time making yeast bread, the steps are easy to follow and it didn't take long. I used fresh garlic (chopped) and Parmesan cheese. It's crusty and the inside is soft.

This was my first attempt at baking a yeast bread.  I made only minor changes to the recipe, using fresh crushed garlic instead of garlic salt, a bit of parmesan with the romano and a tsp of italian seasoning.  I did not grease the baking sheet but used parchment and cornmeal.  Thank you for the clear instructions.  It turned out wonderful and I am looking forward to trying another bread recipe soon!

WOW. This bread was amazingly easy and unbelievable tasty! We used the leftovers to make turkey sandwiches on, and they tasted like a sandwich you'd pay 8 bucks to get at a deli.  I'm making it again today!

Used this dough to make pepperoni bread.  Sooooo good.  Will definitely make it again.  It would make delicious garlic cheese bread too, or just on it's own.

This is great.  I used one cup of whole wheat flour.  I also used 1/2 tsp of garlic powder 1/2 tsp of garlic salt and added 1 tsp of Italian seasoning.  When the loaves came out of the oven, I brushed them with olive oil and sprinkled them with some parm.  I also used parm inside the bread.  I made this for my husband's birthday meal along with Chicken Parmigana, whole wheat angel hair, green beans, and Jamie's Cranberry Spinach Salad.

Awesome bread! I changed it up and used parm instead of Romano and added some Italian herbs to it too. Makes my house smell AMAZING and it never makes it to. The dinner table.

Very easy to make! I didn't have Romano cheese so I substituted Parmesan instead. I also only had bread flour on hand so i used that instead. Based on other reviews, I also added italian seasoning and added a 1/4 cup more cheese. Also instead of two loaves, I made one loaf and about a dozen mini bread sticks. Everything turned out yummy and only half of the loaf was left.  All the breadsticks were gone! Thanks for the easy to work with recipe! :)

This turned out great the first time. I used bread flour which makes a big difference in quality.  I also coated the loaves in olive oil prior to baking so that they would brown without overcooking.  Finally, I brushed the tops with butter and sprinkled on sea salt just before they were done.  This brought out all of the flavors of the cheese and garlic that other reviewers claimed were missing. (A little salt goes a long way.  Use sea salt, as it is less "salty" and brings out flavors better.)  This bread was great all by itself and was really satisfying.

This was very good especially w/ pasta and meat sauce to compliment. I added Herb De Provence instead of the garlic salt. Will definitely make again..maybe into buns for sloppy Joe's.

Loved this recipe! I hardly changed anything. I used parm cheese instead of romano. I also didn't use the cornmeal. I've had trouble getting yeast doughs to rise in the past so this time i started to pre-heat my oven for 30sec or so and set the dough in the oven to rise. The extra heat helped a ton and the dough is nice and light. Topped with butter at the end and it's delicious. This is my go-to french bread recipe from now on!

Very good! I used fresh shredded Parmesan cheese. I did omit the garlic, as hubby is not a fan of bread for sandwhiches that has garlic in it. I also used this recipe with the French Dip recipe on here - fantastic!

Great bread! Fast and easy, and delicious! If you don't have a ready warm place to let the bread rise, a rice cooker worked wonders for me, and grated parmesan cheese over the top is great too! WONDERFUL recipe! Definitely a new staple

This was great!  I had my patients make this at a LTC facility. They had such fun and it reminded them of their younger days.  The aroma filled the facility and everyone said it was the best they have tasted in a very long time.  Thank-you for making  a bunch of seniors happy.

It was really good but maybe more garlic was needed because you did'nt really taste it. But other than that it was really delicious.

Very good. The only thing I did differently was to use bread flour and Asiago cheese, as that's all that I had on hand, and the flavor of the cheese really comes through.

This bread took longer than stated simply because it needed to rise for almost 2 hours but it was worth it.  It had great flavor and texture and may work great for pizza crust too.

This bread turned out just as it should: lovely light brown crispy crust and soft and airy inside. I have lost my Italian bread recipe and was looking for a substitute. The trick was that my old recipe had durum flour in it. After a fruitless search my stomach started growling and I said 'what the heck, I'm just going to use this one' So I just used a mix of all purpose flour with durum, added some mejram for some flavour in stead of garlic. Mmmmm! Thanx a lot for the recipe!
