Wonderful! I left out the cumin and bell pepper because I didn't have any on hand. I also substituted the clove garlic for about a tbs. and a half of jarred minced garlic and added a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies. I served this over white rice.

A really nice side dish, that has a wonderfully deceptive amount of flavor thanks to the garlic. We've found cooking until almost all the liquid is gone works best though - one time 20 minutes was too much.

This was very good and very easy. I didn't have cumin (dislike the taste so probably would not have added anyway)  I added a touch of onion powder.  Had a great kick to it. Nice side dish and a good way to get some veggies in. Thanks for the recipe!

I was looking for a recipe to make a meal out of a can of kidney beans and found this one.  WOW, what an easy and tasty recipem this turned out to be.  I followed the recipe and the only change I made was to rinse both the corn and the beans(together in the same strainer) because I do not like the can taste.  I did not even replaced any of the lost liquid.  My husband and kids loved this recipe.  It is a really great vegan recipe!

My grandma used to make a dish like this. She used creamed corn and kidney beans. We called it "kali ca mash" She sered it with bacon and we had a meal. Those were the days.

Made this with reservations that my husband would even eat it. He actually complimented me on it 3 times, which means he really, really, really likes it! I served it over Brown Rice and was so tasty and filling. Will serve again!

Absolutely horrible! My husband and I took one bite each and threw it out. You could only taste spices, nothing else.

I found this alright. I don't like to use anything canned, so I used the equivalent in beans previously cooked from dried and frozen corn, adding in some chicken broth to make up for the liquid. The cooking time made the corn and beans way too soft and when mixed many of the beans broke apart, making a sort of pasty consistency. The flavor was good, and if I make this again I will cook it for only enough time as to warm through.

Phenomenal! I honestly don't know how anyone could have given this any less than 5 stars. I pretty much followed the recipe to a T, although I did use Green Giant Mexicorn instead of plain corn and I am always a generous season-er. :-) I highly recommend for a low cal side dish - pair it with "Quick and Easy Mexican Chicken" recipe for a well rounded, healthy meal!

Very very easy! I didn't have a red onion on hand so I just used a small yellow one. Served it with a side of quinoa. Delicious and healthy!

I absolutely loved this! It was easy to make, used ingredients I always have on hand, and delicious. I had it for lunch, and want to eat it again for dinner, it was so good. I was surprised by just how well all the flavors worked together. I didn't have ground mustard, so I added about 1 tsp. of Dijon mustard and for salt I used garlic salt.

Made this dish this morning after reading through the reviews.  Last night I put half a pound of dried kidney beans in a pot of water and needed something to do with them.  I do not use anything in a can much these days (I implore others to do the same).  I sauteed the garlic with a whole yellow onion using coconut oil.  I used 4 seeded jalapenos instead of green pepper for better flavor.  I quadrupled the cumin and mustard because I love spice!  This may be way too much for others so adjust as you need.  I added 3 cups of water, 1.5 Knorr chicken bouillon cubes, one 10 oz bag of frozen organic supersweet white corn  and 1/2 a cup of bacon bits before bringing to a boil and simmering for 40-50 minutes as the kidney beans required more cook time.  This turned out fantastic!  No mush as described by others who used canned beans and corn.  I will definitely make this again!

Definitely a 'different' taste but it's certainly hearty and filling. I like it more and more with each new bowl but probably wouldnt serve it to someone else without a quick disclaimer to warn them of how different it is. Good with brown rice.

Really great and easy lunch! I love corn and beans but this was unexpectedly DELICIOUS!!! Skipped the green pepper due to the lack of it. Though I think a red or yellow pepper would work better. Added extra garlic and served over brown rice. Thanks for the recipe!

This dish is okay.  It's not spectacular and it's not repulsive.  I made the dish as it was suggested with a slight modification:  I used a yellow bell pepper as I didn't have a green one on hand and I'm not a fan of the can "sludge" that comes from un-rinsed beans so I rinsed the beans and replaced the exact quantity of can liquid with chicken stock. 

This dish has the desire to be great but it's missing something.  It's okay and I'm eating it as I write this but it's not a dish that I would rush to make again.

As another reviewer said here, this could be a nice base recipe but it needs more massaging before this becomes a go-to recipe.

This is very tasty.  I didn't have bell pepper so I just omitted that.  Also I added 1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar to add some freshness.  (Probably the bell pepper would have provided that needed fresh taste but alas we were out of that ingredient.)

this is a good and easy recipe.  i didn't use the cumin, added a tsp of hot english mustard, didn't rinse the beans and added a chopped carrot for colour.  very good, and quick.  and most things are easy to keep on hand when you want to make this in a pitch.  i made some guacomole as a side and used yogurt for garnish.  yum!

It's really good BUT you have to add something to it. I followed the recipe exactly and it's very bland and tasteless. I added some all purpose seasoning (Vegeta) and a touch of sugar. Thank you for a good base recipe.

This is a great quick and easy weekday recipe! I don't think I added enough cayenne or salt to taste but overall, it turned out pretty good for the first go 'round. Will definitely make this again.

Made this for my husband... who pretty much only eats meat.  He has to increase his fiber intake, so beans are a good option.  Made the recipe as described and our family thoroughly enjoyed it.  A new favorite "meatless" dish for my husband, a first!

I tried this recipe and added English peas, mixed vegetables, and celery. It was delicious and my husband enjoyed it. We are not big fans of kidney beans but this recipe will be a part of our meals.

I made this last night and was pleasantly surprised with how flavourful it was!  I used what I had on hand: 1/2 white onion, 1/2 each green, red and yellow bell peppers, 1tbsp prepared mustard.  I added nearly a tsp of cayenne, and I chose to rinse my kidney beans to reduce the sodium.  I did add water in place of the liquid, however, and it took only about 10 minutes for the liquids to be nearly gone.  I ate it just on its own, and it was delicious!  Will surely make again.

I really liked this concept, however, I eliminated the spices and just poured some leftover chipotle pepper in adobo sauce. It was fantastic! I skipped the rice and just ate it plain

I found this to be a very easy to make, nice recipe. As a variation, I didn't add as much cumin as called for (I added about half), and I only added a pinch of chili powder. But I also added some baby bok choi (chopped) to the recipe as the onions and garlic cooked, and then added about 15 oz. of canned diced tomatoes mixed with herbs. Also threw in a bit of orzo, and after it was done it came out very tasty. I've added this one to my favorites!

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe.  I only had 1/3 of yellow pepper, so I added 1 stalk celery for cruch.  It was good.  I'll make it again!  I served it with corn bread.

This was absolutely delicious. I did not add the spices or the bell pepper as I did not have any on hand but I did add an onion and I thoroughly enjoyed this dish!!!!

Hi There,      This recipe has become a staple in our home. I've made copies and handed it out to "The girls" at Thursday breakfast.  Minor adjustments: lots more garlic, red pepper instead of green, more cumin, usually add a can of creamed corn and sometimes I'll add chick peas.     This recipe is easy, inexpensive and makes for great leftovers. Serving this with a tasty grain makes for a meal with a "Complete protein". As being a new family of vegetarians, this is a great fallback recipe which we all enjoy. Even the teenage boys!    Thanks again,    Jesse

I added a can if diced tomatoes (with the juice) but drained the corn and beans.  We had this with cornbread and it was yummy.

I gave this recipe 5 stars b/c I thought the combo of flavors were very good, however, I did make some changes. I used butter instead of olive oil to saute the onions and garlic, I used vidalia onions and doubled the garlic. I also drained and rinsed the kidney beans and added a can of Rotel tomatoes like another reviewer suggested. I also used frozen corn instead of the canned and cut the spices in half, omitting the cayenne pepper. I garnished with cilantro and served over mashed potatoes for something different. Tonight, I will use the leftovers to make Quesadillas. I think with these tweaks, it was pretty darn tasty. Sometimes you just have to make a recipe to suit your own tastes. This was a great recipe that was fast and easy, you could use what you have on hand which is nice.

Delicious flavor. I added half red pepper and almost a can of diced tomatoes and at the end I threw a red chili to add some flavor. Super yummy.

YUM YUM AND YUM!! I had my trepidations but this is EXCELLENT! I used frozen corn because I hate canned corn (1.5 cups) and didn't have green pepper. I was afraid of the cumin so I used about 3/4 Tablespoon but I'm thinking I could have put the full amount in. This is extremely flavorfull and the spices are not at ALL overwelming! What an excellent dish for a thrifty mama trying to clean out her cupboards! I will DEFINITELY make this again!! YUM!!

It's easy to make and sounds like it would be good, but it was a big disappointment. Hard to put my finger on it, but it just didn't taste good. It had a kinda sweet flavor that I didn't like. My husband took a couple of bites and threw the rest away. I followed the directions and didn't drain the kidney beans or corn, but I think draining and rinsing them might have improved the taste and texture. But I won't be trying it again.

Made it according to the recipe except I used frozen corn to replace the canned corn. The result was bland and pedestrian. I would not make this again.

This was a great dish. I reduced the cooking time to 15 minutes and it was just right. A possibility was omitting the Cayenne pepper, especially for the kids. Overall, it was a very filling and healthy meal.

Excellent side dish or even as a vegetarian meal. I omitted the green pepper because I don't like them but the seasonings with the beans and corn were delicious. It's now a standard dish in my house.

This dish is a great combination of sweet and spicy.  For an interesting twist, use cream corn instead of regular corn.

Excellent!  I've been trying to eat healthier by incorporating non-meat proteins into my diet, and this fits the bill.  The cumin gives it a nice chili-like flavor without overpowering the other ingredients.

This was surprisingly tasty for such a basic dish. I reduced the cumin by a bit, added a couple pinches of bouillon powder, and added a couple ounces of Impossible beef for extra flavor while keeping it vegan (added it after the onions and peppers had sautéed for a few minutes and before I added the spices.). Delicious!

Great dish- though it ended up being a bit sweet from the corn so I added a little heat. Some pickled jalapeños work wonders in this!

I just made this wonderful dish and I can't wait to have dinner! The flavor combination is fantastic! I added a tiny bit of liquid smoke- not that it needed a single thing, we just like a smokey flavor and it seemed like a good idea at the time.

I made this recipe almost as written, but I added 1/2 can white beans that I had left over from another recipe. I should have also added more garlic. I rinsed the beans and added a bit of water for the liquid. I also used prepared mustard. I ate it plain with a dollop of Greek yogurt. While very filling, I thought the cumin flavour was a bit overwhelming. I agree with some other reviewers that a yellow or red pepper may have been better. It was okay, but it definitely needs some tweaking.

I just made this. WOW!!! Easy & Quick. Tastes good and looks good. I used items I had on hand as follows - didn't have red onion used white, added green and red peppers, used 1 tsp. regular mustard, and spiced it up with cayenne pepper, italian seasoning, salt & black pepper. Followed everything else. This will be a regular for me. Perfect with rice.

A absolutely delicious and easy meal! I changed it slightly by using frozen corn and adding a small amount of vege stock, Chili & Dijon Mustard instead of dry. Tasted superb!  For all you Thermomix owners.. this converts very easily to the Thermomix - cooked in 15 mins from start to finish.
