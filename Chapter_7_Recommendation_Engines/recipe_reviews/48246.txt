This was the BEST cold soup I have ever had!  We ate it both warm and chilled and preferred the soup cold.  So delicious. Looking forward to making it with fresh strawberries this season!

Very tasty, had a good number of seeds, but that made it more like a meal.

I made this for the moms at a Valentine play date and served this with a strawberry and spinach salad. I used a sweet red because that is all I had and I used frozen strawberries because it was out of season. But this was amazing. We served it warm and all i would change is maybe leave some of the strawberries a little chunkie for a little more substance to the soup. This is a definate favorite for the group.

Strawberry season has arrived in Florida, so I'm looking for new ways to use them.  I cut the recipe in half, used Splenda for the sugar and reduced fat sour cream which worked fine.  Several reviewers mentioned that they thought the texture would be improved if some chopped berries were added to the puree, so I incorporated that into the recipe...wise decision.  The flavor is like a very decadent, intense strawberry milkshake.  If serving as a soup for an appetizer, I'd recommend a small portion as this is pretty rich. I'm seeing more and more restaurants serving mini desserts in shooter glasses, and I think that's a great and fun finish to a nice meal.   We really enjoyed this served chilled more than hot, but that's just a personal preference.  However you serve it, I don't think you'll be disappointed.  Thanks Looobeee for a nice strawberry recipe.

Pretty good, but I really didn't notice much improvement from the simmering. Next time I'll keep a portion uncooked for comparison, as the simmering seemed to kill the wine and flatten the flavor a bit. I also recommend adding another cup of strawberries and chopping a couple cups of them so there's some texture, rather than a straight puree. Might add a bit more wine, too.

How delightful! Strawberries straight from our garden were plenty sweet, so I cut the sugar in half. Hot, warm, or chilled, it was wonderful! Meal or dessert? Both! I couldn't imagine the flavor, looking at the ingredient list, but the simple choice of ingredients worked beautifully. Thanks for the lovely recipe!
