Wonderful recipe!  Have made a couple of times before writing a review.  The recipe is wonderful as written, but after experimenting, would suggest the following to change it up from time to time:  1)Increase the cheese to 3/4 cup using a mixture of Romano and Parmesan. 2)  Used 1 tsp of a good quality paprika (makes all the difference in the flavor of the finished dish) and 1 tsp smoky paprika.  3)   Added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder.  4) Decrease butter to 1/8 cup based on the increase in cheese.  5)  Bake for 45 minutes tops otherwise the chicken dries out.  Enjoy!

There's only one word to describe this dish...WOW! I followed the directions as written and it turned out beautiful. I used freshly grated parmesan, and the only thing I did diffrently was to grate a little extra on top of the chicken right before baking. My husband and I were absolutely speechless over this delicious dish! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

Wonderful tasty recipe although a bit too buttery. I will definitely make this again and will experiment with less butter and/or oil to get to the level we'd enjoy most. 

I used a really nice Pecorano Romano which I freshly grated using a medium hole grater so I got nice slivers of cheese. Definitely avoice processed "fake" parm cheese or pregrated stuff. The better your cheese is, the tastier this will be.

This tasted good, and smelled wonderful.  I decreased cooking time to 50 minutes for very thick chicken breasts, so really keep an eye on the cooking time.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for dinner last night, and my husband and I loved it. I cut the recipe in half since I was only making two chicken breasts. I added garlic powder to the flour mixture like other viewers suggested. I baked the chicken for 1 hour, and it came out so moist. This will be a favorite recipe in my house.

This was wonderful!! I followed the recipe exactly, except for the cooking time - It only needed to be cooked for 50 min. It smelled up the house and was some of the best baked chicken that I've had in a long time!

This chicken was so easy to make and turned out so wonderfully!  I did only cook it about 45 minutes, and added some garlic, as other reviewers suggested.  This was amazing - I'm sending the recipe to all of my friends, and I'll definitely be making it again and again!

Super tasty and it does get crisp like as if you fried it.  I think next time I'll cook it for maybe 15 minutes less so it doesn't dry out.  It got crispy well before it was done.  My husband and 2 year old both loved it!

I used a grated Italian blend, which contained parmazan, romano, and mozzerella.  I also added 1/4 tsp. of garlic powder.  I had 2 large breasts and double dipped; there was just enough coating for this.  I only used half the butter.  I baked it for 45 minutes at 375 degrees, and it was perfectly done.  Served with au gratin potatoes and green beans.  A great easy meal.

This is one that lives in our hall of fame.  Hubby LOVED it and even asked for it again for the next week.  It's not as messy as the directions sound like it would be, and it was totally worth the minimal effort. :)

Chicken was very juicy and tender! I used half the amount of paprika and omitted butter. I poured remaining egg/milk mixture and flour coating over chicken before baking. Baked about an hour. Family enjoyed it!

I'm not a huge fan of chicken but I LOVE this dish.  BUT I have to qualify that statement a bit. I've made this twice, first with fresh - never frozen - chicken and it was much much juicier than the second time when I made it with chicken that had been previously frozen.  My second note is that that age and quality of your paprika is going to make a HUGE difference.  If you pull out a dusty tin of paprika that's been around for a few years and is looking kind of brownish instead of bright red, this isn't going to taste very good.  I use Penzey's half-sharp paprika because it adds a little heat but any good quality paprika would do (although I don't think I'd personally use a sweet paprika, it would give the dish the same punch). And third, I totally agree that the cooking time is way too long even with really big chicken breasts.

Excellent dish! Some of the reviews complained about lack of flavor so I added 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder to the flour/cheese mixture. I also sprinkled crushed red pepper on top to give it an extra punch. It was incredibly tasty!

I let it bake for an hour and it turned out perfectly brown and crispy. Crunchy on the outside, moist on the inside.

This is THE recipe for chicken. I have many similar recipes, but I deleted them all after trying this one. I used chicken tenders, 1/8 cup of Smart Balance light instead of butter, and skim milk instead of egg, and it turned out fantastic!

This was very tasty and easy!  My picky hubby loved it.  It could use maybe just a bit more spice - I will maybe add some garlic salt next time.

I cut the butter in half, didn't use egg and used smoked paprika. I also butterflied the chicken breasts. Very good, I didn't find it bland as many reviewers did. In fact, I thought it was great. Definitely a quick and easy dish you can have on the table in nothing flat.

Used 1tsp regular paprika and 1 tsp smoked paprika.  We are forever using this recipe as a good substitution for fried chicken!  The whole family loved it.  Even used gluten free flour to make it compliant with our GF diet!  Yummy!

This is excellent! One of those rare finds that my entire family of 5 is crazy about. I usually make extra coating and load it on to the chicken - guess it adds to the calorie count but it tastes great. Also use breadcrumbs instead of flour, and cook for only 50 min. Thanks for sharing this.

The crust was good, but after an hour of cooking the chicken was dry. Next time I'll reduce cooking time to get juicier chicken.

Tried it on cod filets - excellent. Don't bake as long- 25 minutes depending on thickness of fish. I used butter spray, but lightly oiled the pan first.

I used chicken thighs and it worked pretty good. Not a bad recipe, a nice variation on baked chicken.

I noticed right away with boneless skinless chicken breast that 1 hour and 15 min cooking time was incorrect.  I cooked this dish about 30 minutes and it came out fabulous.  Very nice flavor and the meat was juicy.  Will definately make again again and again.

Super delicious!! This is a quick and easy recipe. We split 3 breasts so it only took 25-30 mins to cook at 350. I doubled the flour mixture and added garlic powder along with Italian seasoning. Next time I plan on reducing the salt by half and less melted butter over top.

This is a good, basic recipe--I used the only flour I had in the house, some spelt flour, for this, plus a raw milk parmesan and smoked paprika. It was tasty. For my oven, even 45 minutes was a little long. Next time, I'll cut it back to about 40 minutes. Some extra cheese shaved on top is a good addition, as well.

Easy & Excellent a winning combination, maybe a little less butter is the only thing I would change.

This is so good!!  I have another chicken recipe that's very similar - adding worcestershire sauce and dijon mustard to the melted butter - I make it a lot and every time I get raves.  I used chicken tenders so it's easier for the little ones to eat and they loved it.  Will be using this recipe again this weekend for the potluck :)

I think 75 minutes to cook is a bit too long as the chicken came out on the dry side. Will definitely try it again and watch the internal temperature of the chicken more closely.

The only thing better than the taste of this dish is the SMELL of it baking!! Like many others, reduce the cooking time a bit (like 1 hour) simply because after smelling it cook for a while I can't take it any longer!! An excellent, simple dish that my whole family enjoys.

Bought expensive parm cheese and paprika.  Followed recipe as written (with the exception of adding garlic powder).  It smelled wonderful, looked wonderful, and tasted terrible.  My son refused to eat it after the 1st bite.  I managed to eat half a breast.  This just wasn't for us.

In the words of my husband "It has butter and cheese how wrong can it get?"  It was very tasty. I cooked it in our cast iron skillet in the oven for 25 minutes (it was pounded very thin)

This recipe is easy to assemble and produces tasty results. My chicken cooked a little quicker than the time state, but it's all relative I suppose.

YUMMY!!!!!!! This is a must try recipe!!!  I love the parmesan cheese crust!!!  It browns up so nicely!!  I used l/4 cup of dry parmesan cheese along with l/2 cup of the packaged grated parmesan cheese. The chicken I used had been marinating for a day. This may be the answer to some who thought the chicken did not have enough flavor. My baking time was about an hour, the chicken was nice and moist.  It is great the next day as well, just reheat in oven to recrisp.  Thanks so much for sharing, I am so happy to be adding this recipe to my permanent collection!!

I made this for my family this past mothers day - everyone loved it!! The only thing is the chicken DEFINATELY does not need to be cooked 1hr15mins...i would more say 1hr or 45 mins. Also, i needed to make more paprika/parmesan dry coating for the bigger chicken breasts. This recipe is soo easy and really good! i love it.

This is a very good recipe. My chicken was very thin, I only cooked for 25 min and it was done. Thank God for instant read thermometers! Extremely moist. I suggest using cream in the egg to make it thicker and a nice coating on the chicken. It only needs a splash with one egg. Also I used all smoked paprika. I love the flavor. I used less butter, about 1/2 of what it called for. That was plenty. I will make this again! I might try adding panko for some texture. If I do, I will update my review.

I made this on the stovetop instead of baking (my oven was occupied at a different temperature), pan-frying chicken tenderloins in a little vegetable oil, which was a lot faster than baking.  It was tasty, a nice riff on chicken parmesan.

First of all, the color of this dish is just gorgeous. Secondly, it is really easy to make and thirdly, it tastes so good! A company worthy meal for sure. I served it with broken spaghetti risotto from here and Brussels sprouts and it is one of the better meals I have made. Proud of myself! :)

A bit bland. Maybe if the chicken was marinated first it would be better? I cooked as written except that I cooked for a shorter period of time (35 min @ 350) and added garlic per other reviews. Still seems to be missing something. I will try to make again, but I need to figure out what it's missing.

This was super juicy and pretty yummy, too. I didn't change a thing, but next time I think I might add something to give it some more oomph. It was good, but not something we talked about afterwards.

I was very pleased with this recipe. I made it for my in-laws and they loved it! My chicken breasts were huge and I ran out of toppings. I only made three chicken breasts because they were so big and I still had to make more of the flour mixture to have enough to cover the chicken. I reduced the cooking time to about 50 minutes and they were perfect.

Great flavor.  Prepared exactly as listed.  I always fillet my chicken breasts to cut down on cooking time.  Worked perfectly for 3 chicken breasts filleted.

Probably should be 3.5 stars.  To me 5 stars is out of this world amazing, 4 stars is excellent, so 3.5 stars means this dish was pretty good.  Easy recipe.  I used 1 tsp of paprika so I didn't turn off the kids.  Everyone seemed to enjoy it.  I personally thought the chicken itself was somewhat bland.  The crunchy topping was nice.  I used 1 tbsp butter to drizzle on top.  I baked it for about 45 min and it was moist.  I will make again for a quick easy recipe.

excellent! I skipped the butter and just drizzled with a little olive oil and it came out great. I also used thin sliced chicken breasts and reduced the bake time to about 15mins. Very tasty!

Delicious! My boyfriend had me make him "regular" baked chicken because he is so picky... but he tried some of this and LOVED it! I also used 1/2 the butter and only had to cook it for about 40 minutes!

I gave this a 4 since I think that the chicken should be pounded out thinned and possibly some bread crumbs added for a little crunch. Good flavor though.

I used this chicken on a sandwich - yummy!  Added some cayenne to spice it up.

Great recipe- made it for my husband and a friend and they loved it.  Served it with pasta and marinara sauce.  Didn't use quite as much butter as called for but it turned out great!

I found this recipe while looking for a new way to make chicken- with very little ingredients on hand. This was fantastic tasting, and so moist and tender! I only changed a few small things- I double the butter so that I have enough to continue drizzling it over the chicken throughout the baking process, I halved all of my chicken breasts to shorten the cooking time. I also cook it covered until about the last 15 mins. Yum!

This was delicious! I added some garlic powder in with the flour, used a little less butter and sprinkled some extra parmesan on top. It came out crunchy and perfect. I'm sure this will be a regular meal at our house.  thank you for sharing this recipe.

This was a good recipe and easy to make. My husband seemed to like it more than I did. I will probably make it again, but use breadcrumbs instead of the flour.

Loved it!!!  In a hurry one night, I had some chicken tenders (boneless) and needed something to do with them.  I used this recipe, but cut the time to 15 to 20 minutes. They were moist and tender and delicious.  I will definately be making this again!!!  Thanks for the recipe.

Fantastic recipe!  The only change I made was adding garlic powder and italian seasonings to the coating mix.  It came out of the oven moist and delicious after about 45 minutes.  I was asked to make this one again!  Thanks a lot!

This is a great dish.  I made it for a potluck and used thin cut breast fillets and decreased the cooking time to just under 30 minutes.  I also added extra parmesan cheese before baking.  I sent it with my husband to work the next day and he said it was one of his favorite chicken recipes ever!  We will definitely make this again.  Thanks for a tasty, easy recipe!

Don't cook for the full time!  I wish I would have only cooked it for 45 minutes, the chicken would have been done and not so dry.

Very good - found I needed to almost double the flour mixture to coat all four pieces. I baked for about an hour and then broiled for about 5 minutes on low to make them crispier. Yum!! Thanks for the delicious recipe!

With a lot of good reviews, guess my expectations were a bit high for this dish. It was very bland and coating was pasty. I followed it exactly. Chicken got over done even after taking it out of oven after 40 minutes. I hr and 15 minutes, are you out of your mind!? This dish definitely needs a savory side dish to make it special or anything out of the ordinary. I suggest marinating chicken in seasoned buttermilk over night before preparing to keep it moist while in oven.  Check this after 30 minutes for doneness, as I would hate to see another viewer waste good meat!  If chicken breasts were thin or chicken tenders, it wouldn't be so bland. There won't be a next time with this recipe for me....... But hope this helps others.

After a few tries, this is a tasty dinner.  Don't skip the butter!  I usually only make 1 or 2 at a time, but always comes out tasty.  One thing - 1 hour is WAY too long (at least in my oven) for the chicken.  It will come out dry and tasteless.  30 minutes is plenty for a smaller serving.

I made this using very slight modifications.  I used two egg whites instead of one whole egg. I added garlic powder at the suggestion of other reviewers. I used grated parm (the real deal) and definitely agree with others that that is a make or break for the dish. I baked for 40 mins at 350, covered. It didn't brown up as much as I'd hoped; next time I'll uncover for the last ten mins.

The recipe is great as is!  My husband and I love it and its quick and easy for me to make.  The amount of butter seemed like alot but i used Smart Balance butter which works just as well and low fat parmesian.  Paired with mashed potatoes for the extra butter "gravy" in the bottom of the pan.

My hubby loved this! I'm only giving this 4 stars because I did a slightly different version...I altered it because I was out of eggs, so instead of the eggs/flour dipping I dipped my chicken breast pieces in ranch dressing, then into the paprika/parm and I omitted the butter. I also added some red pepper to the paprika and parmesan to give it more kick, since my hubby and I love spice, and we LOVED it. I never would've thought before to put paprika and parm together but this was so delicious and the chicken came out so moist and crispy from the cheese- YUM!

I made this recipe for the first time and it came out awesome!  The one thing that I changed was the cook time (based on all the other reviews I only baked it for 45-50 minutes).  It came out tender and juicy and the flavor was great.  I think that next time I might add garlic, but that's only because I like to tinker with recipes and I love garlic.

This recipe was really good and a different take on plain baked chicken breasts.  The only thing, I over cooked mine a little.  Next time I make it, I will make sure not to over cook.  Great recipe!!

This chicken was all right, nothing real exciting, but good. I was expecting this to have a little bit more flavor, but instead it was just a subtle flavor from the paprika and the parmesan cheese. I did change the baking time because I knew reading over the directions that an hour an 15 minutes was way too long for boneless chicken breasts, so I baked it at my usual time and temperature - 375 for 35 minutes and it turned out juicy and perfectly cooked. On the plus side, my three year old son ate every single bite of his chicken so he seemed to really like it. I will probably make again sometime just because this one is really easy and doesn't take much time to fix. Will be great for rushed weeknight meals. Thanks for the recipe, Renae.

This recipe is one of my "go tos" when I'm short on time and need a for sure yummy chicken dish. It goes well with many different sides so it's perfect for when you need to throw together a great dinner on short notice.

The cooking time on this is too long. I over cooked it. However it was very tastey so I will def. do again just cook for probably half the time.

This was delicious.  My family all loved it!   It is now our favorite Chicken recipe.  I used some seasoned salt instead of regular salt but other than that followed the recipe exactly.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

Kind of disappointing.  First, I bought expensive Parmesan cheese to improve the taste.  I did only cook them for 50 minutes, and they were fine.  They definitely tasted better than they looked!  They never got crispy or turned the orange color shown.  The flavor was fine but nothing spectacular.  I will probably try this again but will play with the recipe a little bit.

I used a whole cut-up chicken and deboned the breast. Since I really like paprika, I added an extra teaspoon. Had good flavor. I cooked it about an hour and used 2 tablespoons butter to drizzle over top. I can't imagine cooking boneless breasts an hour and 15 minutes.

I'm no cook by no means at all!  But this dish was so easy to make and is sooo delicious!  My husband and I love parmesan so the only change I made was added more of it, and a bit more paprika for more spice.  I even made this for family that came to visit and they asked for the recipe and said they loved it.  I've made this multiple times now and is now a favorite of mine!

Liked this a lot. Added a tsp. of garlic powder to the flour mixture, and only cooked it for 40 to 45 minutes as suggested by others. Will definitely make this again.

Maybe closer to 3.5 stars... I'm giving it a 4 because  I left it in the oven after the full cooking time (with the oven off) to keep it warm and may or may not have made it a bit dry.  Flavor wise, Not too bad, however, I used Ramano instead of Parmesan.. Yeah, I'll make it again, and probably a few times after that too

One word: SUCCULENT!! Everything about it was great. I had only several items on hand and it worked perfectly!  I changed just one thing: doubled the butter amount to ensure the chicken was evenly drenched, because the coating can get crumbly, so it doesnt coat evenly. Doubling the butter amount helped to keep the coating crusty as well as the bottom a great and tasty buttery flavor!  Husband loved it. I plan to make it again soon.

This was delicious! I didn't have chicken breast so I used chicken thighs instead... other than that I followed the recipe as listed. Ever since I made this I've been craving it & my boyfriend liked this as well.  Definitely recommend this easy & delicious meal to anyone!

I was uneasy about this recipe because, well, I always tend to screw up chicken breasts. But my boyfriend wanted some chicken and I had some chicken to use. Followed the ingredients exactly, but I'm glad I saw the reviews about cook times! Let it bake for 40 minutes and it turned out perfect, super moist. Will make again. The kids loved it too!

Excellent recipe for a night when you want something a little different but only have the basics on hand. Very moist, tender, flavorful and EASY! I have made this multiple times--I even tested it on my brothers who complain that chicken is inherently bland, and they were both impressed and went for seconds. I follow the recipe exactly, but cut the bake time down to 40-45 min instead of the stated hour and some.   I give the recipe 4 stars instead of 5 because my crispy coating turns out slightly soggy and the bake time is off. It's possible that if I let it bake a little longer, the coating would crisp up, but I'm reluctant to try that because I would hate to let the chicken dry out.

This was an ok recipe. It was rather bland to me, but my fiance liked it enough to make again if I add more kick to it spice wise. If I make this again, I will slice the chicken the size of chicken tenders and see if that will give it more flavor.  This could be better if served with a alfredo sauce over angel hair pasta.  Actually as another reviewer said, it is not too bad cold.  Would also go well cold as a leftover on top of a ceasar salad sliced.

I realized at the exact moment I needed to put my chicken in the oven I was missing a key ingrediant for another recipe.  So I looked up recipes on here, found this one and had chicken in the oven in 5 minutes.  So easy and quick.  It was good, but next time I will add some garlic and maybe some red pepper to spice it up a bit.  It is a keeper!

This recipe is hearty and delicious, a wonderful alternative to traditional fried chicken. We like it with roasted rosemary potatos, and either a salad or fresh garlic green beans.

This was very good and so easy to make! I used a dozen chicken tenders and baked in the oven for 45 minutes. I ate baked asparagus on the side and it was super yummy!

Made this last night WOW, so easy and tasty!! I did only bake for 45-50 min as suggested and added garlic.  Baked in a baking small baking dish, the chicken was so moist and tender.  I would add more spice to it next time, maybe some red pepper flakes.

This recipe was absolutely wonderful. My husband loved it. The only thing I changed the second time around was using Perdue thin sliced boneless skinless chicken and that made it even better.

This recipe was a big hit with the kids.  The chicken remained moist and tender, and was excellent served with a simple side of spaghetti and marinara sauce.  You can reduce the cooking time to 50 minutes-to-an-hour and still end up with perfect results.

I never have luck with cooking chicken breasts that are not either dry or undercooked. This recipe was excellent !! Its amazing that a batter with 3 ingredients comes out so tasty. I kind of butterflied my chicken breasts and checked them after 45 mins and they were perfect and juicy. This has been the best chicken breast recipe I have ever had so far and will make it all of the time and its really easy too.

I added some chili and garlic powders, and I'm glad I did because otherwise it would have been too bland. The coating didn't stick on the chicken very well though.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was simple to prepare and I had everything on hand.  I used good-quality shredded parm which really added to the flavor and looks of the dish.  I cut the recipe in half and the proportions were perfect (put any leftover flour/cheese mixture on top of the chicken in the baking dish).  I pounded my chicken a little bit and only had to bake for 35 minutes.  The chicken was so tender and yummy.  Served with Balsamic Roasted Red Potatoes, Caesar salad, and corn on the cob.

This was absolutely delicious, a real hit with my hubby. I did follow some other reviewers advice and added a bit of garlic powder to the flour mixture. I agree that the flour mixture may be too little, so if your chicken breasts are large, I would suggest you double the mixture. I made three HUGE chicken breasts and they were done in about 55 minutes, so I do think the time will vary. These were juicy, very tasty, very easy and they looked amazing! The crust browns nicely in the oven. Thanks, Renae, for a wonderful recipe!

I would give this a two, but hubby says it's about a three.  Maybe I just don't like the paprika taste, I don't know, but it was funky.  I cooked it for the full time and it was all cooked, a little dry (which I don't mind - I'm weird) and browned nicely.  I just didn't love it.  And I wouldn't make it again, even though it wasn't that time consuming.  Sorry, but thanks!

What a great easy way to make chicken that the whole family will love! I used a whole cut-up chicken (8 pieces) so I had to double the recipe. It turned out really good! This is a keeper. Thanks Renae for sharing.

The flavor of this is excellent.   I rated this 4 because the time is very far off.    At 1 hour and 15 minutes the chicken is very dry.    You need to start checking it at 45 minutes.

This I followed exactly and was not that tasty. It was a little bit of a pain to make and not worth it. My husband and I both did not even eat our entire piece of chicken.  Maybe it needs some more butter, it was very dry.

I'm not a meat eater but I still cook for my family and they loved this recipe.  I enjoyed making it because the smell the chicken made while it was baking reminded me of my dad's cheese straws so that was a great bonus.  Definitely going to make this again!

This tasted SO good! Makes the house smell wonderful while it's in the oven. *You definitely need to make this.* Here are some tweaks I made to the recipe that, I think, improve an already good thing.  First and foremost, I pounded the breasts out to 1/2" at the thickest so I could safely change the cooking temp and time  to 425 degrees for 22-26 minutes per a similar recipe I made last week: as that one claimed, cooking the chicken at a higher temp for less time produce a moister chicken - and who doesn't have something else they'd rather be doing for the 40 minutes that chicken won't spend hanging out in the oven?  Second, I used *smoked* paprika - which imparts a more *interesting* flavor.  And, when I made the dredge, I substituted Panko crumbs for the flour (ooh! extra crispy!)and substituted plain Greek yogurt for the milk part of the dredge and it worked out perfectly. (Especially since we were out of milk!)    All in all, even though I forgot to take a picture of my result (boo) it was a joy to behold and a wonder to eat.  Thanks for this marvelous recipe, Renae!

Very good!! I used thighs, boneless skinless, finely shredded Kraft Parmesan cheese. Just a little bit extra of seasoning and cheese because of the size of the thighs.

Absolutely amazing!! I didn't leave it in nearly as long as it says, but a good 30-40 minutes, also don't have a meat thermometer but if you open it slightly with two toothpicks and the juices are clear/the meat isn't pink, you're good to go.

I used another persons suggestion to increase the parmesan to 3/4 cup and I used one teaspoon of smoked paprika with on the  one teaspoon of paprika. I all so added 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder. I slicked the breasts in half length wise tio make then thinner and only put them in the oven for 25 mins at 350. They were crusty and still juicy. Depending on your oven a careful watch would be necessary to not over cook. Even thick breasts at  75 mins sounds dry chicken to me.

This is one great recipe.  To take the guess work out of cooking time remove chicken when it has reached 157 degrees internal temp.  Let it rest covered for 3-4 mins.  Bone-less chicken can get dry very quick if you just rely just on cooking times.  Every oven is different.  I baked at 400 degrees so it would have a more crisp outer coating.

I added garlic powder and a dash of cayanne pepper to give it more flavor. Only bake 40-45min . I pounded chicken breasts to 1/4" prior to dredging through eggs and flour mixture. Family enjoyed this

This turned out incredibly well. I completely followed the directions up until it came to the cook time. I cooked it for 50 mins. It turned out insanely tender & flavorful. Even my super picky toddlers asked for seconds. Definitely going to be made again in our house. Thanks for posting this recipe!!

This recipe is outstanding. Super easy, and the family loved it. I'd recommend only using fresh shaved parmesan -- it's critical to the flavour -- and baking it for 40 minutes max. Otherwise it will dry out completely. 
Now that we've tried it, I'll be making this one again and again!

This recipe is soooo good. Our 10 year old son helped make this for us. It is so easy and delicious.  The chicken comes out so perfectly crispy like it was fried in oil. Our family loved this recipe and will definitely make it a part of our routine!

I just made this, and it was really great!  I used chicken breast strips, and I added half a pack of hidden valley ranch mix. I only cooked it for about 50 minutes. My picky five year old absolutely loved them! Also, they are very easy to make and there is hardly any prep work.

I couldn't justify the butter, so we just sprayed the top with butter flavored cooking spray. It got a decent crust on it. This was a good recipe. I'd make it again.

This was very nice for a fairly simple dish. I made it exactly as written, but I always wonder how well the coat-and-dredge steps work in recipes like this. Most of the egg/milk mixture was left behind, but the dry coating stuck pretty well. It baked up nicely, and lasted me for four dinners. This isn't anything spectacular, but it delivered exactly what I expected.

We altered this recipe a bit, but the foundation of it was great! We just added garlic powder (LOTS of it...) and onion powder to the dry ingredients and cooked the chicken for about 30 minutes... It came out perfectly cooked!!  My husband made sure to add more cheese on top as well! It's his new favorite baked chicken dish! I think the key was using the glass baking dish which was well greased with our Pam butter spray...

This was good but not WOW good as the majority of reviews imply. I really think the success of this dish depends on the quality of  ingredients used. Smoked paprika and freshly grated cheese are key, IMHO. NOTE: If you bake your chicken long enough for it to soak up all of the butter / crisp up, it will dry out. There's a very fine line between the two and despite my cooking prowess, I crossed that line. :( A side of spaetzle tossed with butter and fresh parsley and steamed garlic green beans rounded out our meal. All said and done, this was decent but nothing to write home about. Thanks anyways, Renae.

Looking forward to trying this recipe, but 1 hr 15 min for boneless/skinless breasts??  That sounds about 20-30 min too long. Maybe they like their chicken like leather?  I would suggest broiling a few minutes at end to get that great crispy coating instead of baking it so long.

I've made this twice now and my family loved it both times.  Even the kids asked for seconds, which almost never happens.  Tonight I'm going to try the same recipe with pork chops.

Very good!  Easy to make and tasted delicious!  Next time, instead of using butter, I might just spray the chicken with cooking spray.  I'm not a big fan of butter.  Only needed about an hour to bake.

Well, I added onion powder, dried garlic, and cayenne, which helped this out taste-wise, although it was still a little bland. I think I probably would put a bit more cayenne pepper. Still good. I also used chicken tenders, so this was cooked at around 25-30 min. I turned on the broiler at the end because the cheese wasn't quite crispy enough.

All in all, I would probably make this again since it was quick and easy. I'll just play around a bit more for the flavor :)

I made this tonight. Only I chose to use tenderloins instead. My husband is usually the cook around here. However I saw this on Pinterest and made it. It was really good. My hubby said one of my best dishes. He said it was very, very good. Thanks. I will be making this again.

If I could give this 10 stars, I would. I added cayenne to the spice mix and baked 350 for 30 minutes. It was PERFECT. I had real thick pieces of chicken, so I butterflied (with complete cut through) and pounded with a mallet to make the chicken sizes uniform. YUM

This chicken turned out crispy and had a great taste.  I followed the directions exactly and it turned out great!  I will be making this again.  I would like to try the fresh Parmesan cheese next time like some of the other reviewers suggested.  I am sure it will make it even better!

We LOVED this chicken recipe, and it was so easy to make! The only thing I suggest is a little less butter. I also added some extra seasonings to the mix, but I am sure it could have gone without.

This is a family favorite. I usually double the recipe so we have leftovers for some killer chicken sandwiches. I gave this recipe to my mom and even my very picky brother, whom hates chicken, asked for seconds.

I just made this for dinner with some mashed potatoes and mixed veggies. I was told this was "great" I loved how the outside was crispy but the inside was flowing with juices. I used boneless chicken tenders and put my dry ingredients in a gallon plastic bag instead of a bowl for fast clean up. I also only baked for 45 minutes and then broiled for 5 minutes, they were a little mushy on the bottom but I can remedy that next time by turning them once so that they get the broiler at the end. Overall great recipe will definetly make it again!

The flavor was good, but I think the chicken was not moist at all...in fact a little mushy.  I would love to use this recipe for a salad, but would not recommend for anything with a sauce...the sauce soggies out the chicken.

My husband and I really enjoy this dish.  Here in Ukraine, I haven't been able to find parmesan cheese, so I grated fresh Russian cheese instead.  It still turned out wonderful.  We've also cut the chicken into strips and cooked for less time.  The strips are great for kids and over alfredo pasta.

Took to a picnic and it held up nicely.  I served it cold and it was wonderful.  I added about 3/4 teaspoon of garlic powder as suggested.  I also used olive oil with a smidge of butter to brush on the top.  Will make again.

My husband isn't a chicken fan, so I am always looking for new ways to cook chicken so he will eat it. He did like this, but I loved it! I make it at home and have even made it at my parents house. Very good recipe.

My family LOVED this chicken.  I added a little more parmesan than called for (just because we love parmesan); otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  It was a big hit.  BONUS: this makes a great leftover sandwich chicken.  Very tasty cold, as well.

My BF loved this recipe. It was so easy and turned out great. I added garlic powder to the breading mixture and I also added minced garlic to the melted butter before I drizzled it on the ck. It turned out great!

This was very very good. I used very fresh Szeged paprika from Hungary. It was very flavorful and I will be making this agian soon.

This dish was just alright for me.  It looked beautiful and the chicken was moist, but it was bland, and had this odd pumpkin-y aftertaste from all the paprika.

I was really looking forward to this one, but unfortunately, we did not enjoy it too much.  Made a few weeks back and forgot to review.  Regardless, I found the flavours to be a bit too overpowering, however, having said that, it may be my fault and I should probably give this one another try.  I only had 2 boneless breasts (mind you they were a bit larger), so therefore did not cut down the measurements of the flour/paprika, etc.  Maybe that was part of it...so as I said, I should give it another try.  On the plus side, it was very moist chicken and did not need the full 1 hr 15 mins to cook, probably closer to 50-55 mins.  Definitely rates high for a nice quick recipe that is easy to prepare!

This chicken recipe was awesome!! The changes I made are as follows...I used chicken breast tenderloins, and knocked the baking time in half, and i added some fresh chopped garlic to the butter as I melted it.  Adds some more depth to the flavor this way.  My daughter absolutely devoured this!  It's a keeper, and I'll be passing it on to friends.

Amazing! I unfortunately went through the process of boning and skinning the chicken breast myself the first time... which I'll never do again if it can be avoided, yuck. My family LOVED it and so did I! I made eight servings for five people and there wasn't a bite left. Thank you for submitting this recipe!!!!!!

It was pretty good. I loved the fact that it was very tender and moist, but, I may have accidently added more salt because I didn't have enough parmesan cheese. Maybe that was a mistake. I will try to make it again some other time and not use that extra sprinkle of salt.

This dish was good, easy & somewhat flavorful, but didn't have a wow factor. Used 2 chicken tenderloins/person, cooked about 30 min. I'd make it again but it was just ok.

My husband & I thought this dish was just "ok".  Nothing special.  The butter poured over the top made the coating on the underside of the chicken come off.  Will probably not make again. Only took about 45 minutes to cook.

OMG!!! My best friend and I took over the kitchen tonight and made this chicken. It was absolutely amazing. The only thing we didn't put on it was Paprika, because we didn't have any...lol But I completely recomend this recipe.

I really liked this recipe. It was simple and easy. It was pretty forgiving, as I forgot to pour butter over the chicken and it still came out juicy and nice. It was nice that it wasn't fried or messy like that. Everyone really liked it, I did add some garlic and other spices to the batter. I also added some shredded cheese on top and baked it, which was good. I served it with linguini and red sauce and it was delicious!!! I really recommend this recipe if you are running short on dinner ideas!!!

Love this recipe. It had a lot of flavor. My husband and I loved it. I will make again. The time is a little off I think. It took about 30-40 min. for it to cook completly and still be juicy.

Very good recipe.  My husband had happened to bring a friend over for dinner and I was making this.  Everyone was very delighted with it.  Very juicy and tasty.  Very simple to make.  Might try some more spices next time to give it a little more kick.

This was very tasty. I added some chilli flakes as we like spicy foods but other than that followed the recipe as written. The coating did fall off a bit when I took it out of the pan. Will have to be more careful next time!

This chicken was very tasty. Not hard to make and is just the kind of chicken recipe I like when baking chicken breasts. I agree with the others about it not taking as long, and I like my chicken done. Great recipe!

My household loved this dish! Even my mother in law, who is very picky, liked it so much she over ate! The only thing I changed was adding garlic powder. Chicken turned out moist and flavourful, baking it the full amount of time - 1 hr and 15 min. Will definitely make again!

I made this tonight and it was really good. I made it exactly as written in a convection oven. The fan in the oven wouldn’t work and it was still really good. Definitely going to make it again in a regular oven.

Amazing! I added my twist, but the ingredients are basically the same.  I increased the cheese to 3/4, didn’t measure the butter (I used as needed so the pan didn’t get dry), and added white cooking wine. I cooked in a skillet instead of the oven. (I feel like halved breasts dry out too fast in an oven.).  Once both sides were golden, I added white cooking wine and covered. It simmered for about 10 minutes. It made an amazing sauce/glaze. The first bite to the last was an oh my god moment! Definitely a keeper!

We love this recipe.  The only change we made was to add  50% butter on top of the breasts.  After the cheese melts, plus all the butter, it seemed the breasts where cooking in an inch of butter.  It still came out crispy and very tasty.  Easy to prepare and little to clean up, making it great for a weeknight!

Absolutely delicious. I pounded the breast flat to shorten cooking time and added some garlic powder to the dredge. Do not skimp on the butter. Also sprinkled some shredded Parmesan on top. So delicious!

This was delicious . I used package of chicken tenders so reduced the cooking time to 20 minutes. The coating wasn't very crisp at that time so put it under the broiler  for a couple minutes. The only other difference I made was to add about an eighth tsp of cayenne which gave it a hint of heat. Served with spaghetti with a simple marinara sauce and green salad. I'll definitely make it again.

Used the suggestion to increase the Parmesan by 1/4 cup and decrease the butter to 1/8 cup. Baked for 45 minutes at 350. It was delicious!  Best baked chicken I’ve ever made. I’ll make it again and again.

This recipe was ordinary. I baked two, thin-cut chicken breasts for 38 minutes, so I only made a half recipe. The butter was too much; the underside of the chicken was soggy.

Made it exactly as directed except I baked it at 400 degrees for 17-20 minutes. I also flipped it at 10 minutes.  I did drizzle the butter before I baked the chicken, but it seemed to just run off the coating.

The Chicken Parmesan was delicious! I browned the Chicken on the stove before putting it in the oven for just 30 minutes. I didn’t add any butter to the Chicken, as the recipe called for. I will definitely make this again!

Added garlic powder per other reviews and decided to pan fry instead of bake...was concerned about dry chicken and the coating not coming out crisp.

I also tripled the flour mixture and served with a flavorful red sauce over top.

I love this recipe. I like to add a bit of garlic powder and split the paprika with smoked paprika and use shredded parmesan though. Great with some pasta and a salad. I generally get thinly sliced chicken breasts and don't like them too juicy, so 40 minutes is perfect.

Might have turned out well if it wasn’t so dry.  Based on other reviews I checked it after 45 minutes.  The internal temps were already 175-185. I’m giving this recipe 3 stars because the directions say to bake for an hour and 15 minutes.  That might work for really big breasts but mine apparently needed to come out at 35-40.

This recipe is delicious! I’ve been looking for a way to spice up baked chicken and this was it. My husband loved it and now requests it for dinner frequently! Like others I was skeptical of the baking time thinking that it was far too long BUT I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out beautifully! The chicken did not dry out at all and I even enjoyed the leftovers the next day! Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe was super easy and quick to prepare.  The outer coating of the chicken was delicious.  I didn't have Paprika, so I substituted Smoked Paprika instead.  It added a really nice flavor to the outer crust.

This is good but needed a few tweaks! Do not cook for over an hour! Way too long for boneless chicken! I also added garlic powder and a little minced onion to mine with just a tad of olive oil in the bottom of the pan. Cooked it at 335 on my convection oven setting for 30 minutes till temp was 160. It was juicy and perfect.

This was delicious! My whole family really enjoyed this scrumptious and tender chicken. This is the 4th time I have made it and I did end up following a few suggestions. I did lessen the butter from 1/4 cup to 3tablespoons. 1/4 cup is too much. I have added garlic powder  too (1/2-1 teaspoon depending on your preference). If you want it spicy added 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper. This is a real keeper!

This is a very tasty, quick dinner. I was pleased because I did not think it would have a lot of flavor with the simple ingredients. The Parmesan cheese really livens up the flavor. I highly recommend this for working moms,

This recipe saved the day.  Too rainy to barbeque, my sons' girlfriends coming over to eat and I wanted something different and easy   Once it's in the oven there's plenty of time to do some sides.  Easy to add other spices and herbs to adapt it to your family's tastes.  Love it!!  Definitaly will be making this again.

Really tasty mix of ingredients but some of the quantities aren’t right. I had 10 chicken breast halves and didn’t even need double the amount of the breading mixture—threw a lot away. Probably didn’t need a doubled egg dip either. Also too much butter... it ends up baking in a butter soup, could use a fair bit less (maybe half).

There are hundreds of ways to make chicken, and I like to try a new one every now and then.  This one was a winner!  You won't be disappointed.  Like others, though, I reduced the baking time.  In my oven, 47 minutes was perfect.  I served this along with "Cream Corn Like No Other," which you can find on this site, along with steamed buttered broccoli and a small tossed salad.  One of the best meals ever!

Followed the recipe except I pounded the chicken and only baked 40 minutes. Came out just a bit dry but I would recommend that if you pound the chicken to cook it even less than 40 minutes. Otherwise a tasty dish.

My family (4 kids) loved this recipe!  Super easy to make.  My variation is that I sautéed the chicken in butter instead of baking - so much quicker and great flavor.  Had leftover egg and flour mixture so I sautéed that as well and called them cheese cakes - the kids loved those too!  Served with spinach raviolis and green beans with washrooms and bacon :)

Yummy!  
I chose to coat the chicken first omitting the parmesan cheese.  Then dipped it in the milk/egg mixture. I chose to use buttermilk. Then re-dipping into the coating mixture with the parmesan cheese added.  Super crunching coating on the outside.  Paired with glazed carrots to round out the meal.

My family loved this!  I increase most of the ingredients so I get a full coating on each breast of chicken, otherwise, I don't make any changes.  I have now made this a few times and we never have leftovers.

I never got bad recipe from here, this is my 1st. I think because of the high ratings maybe I was expecting a wowness factor. I followed the instructions to a T and followed the reviews to cook for less time. I found it to be soggy, I even used less butter. Will not make again, my husband always compliments me, with this he had nothing to say.

This is a keeper. I followed the directions as written. Just two of us so just used  one large chicken breast half but still used the same measurements with dry ingredients. Baked just under 40 minutes. Instant read thermometer read 170°F. It was tender and juicy. Perfect! Thank you Renae.

I have made this twice. My husband loved it even left over because he got called into work while it was baking. I would recommend using thin sliced chicken breast-personal preference over a traditional breast.

I added 1/4 cup parmesian cheese to the top of the chicken and decreased the butter in half. I cooked it for 50 minutes and the chicken was cooked all the way through.

Easy to prepare and delicious!  I took other reviewers advice to reduce the baking time and add some garlic to the breading  mixture.  I also tried it with  freshly grated grana padano cheese and it turned out great.

Delicious! I didn’t have as much Parmesan cheese as the recipe called for, so I placed a slice of Swiss on each piece of  chicken before baking, and covered it the last 10 minutes. I only baked the chicken for 45 minutes.

Made as recipe directed.  We did not care for the paprika in this recipe.  We love paprika but not this combination.  Will not make again.  Will use the Italian -Parmesan  recipe.

Delicious! I added a dash of cayenne to the paprika for a little heat, and made a sauce (my family is big on sauces) with white wine, chicken stock, garlic, butter and herbs, but it wasn’t really needed. The chicken was tender and juicy and gone almost as quickly as the plates were loaded.

I made this tonight for dinner and It was amazing! I did add in the garlic powder as others suggested. I used 2 large chicken breasts and cut into quarters. My husband raved about this and said it was flavored throughout the chicken and it was the best he's ever eaten!

It was easy to make and the clean-up was quick. I used  equal parts of bread crumbs and flour instead of just flour. Worked well.

I found this to be rather bland.  The only substitution I made was using breast tenderloins rather than whole breasts.  As a result, it only needed 50 minutes to cook.  If I were to make this again, I’d skip the butter as it only adds calories and makes the chicken mushy on the bottom, and I’d probably add some finely chopped garlic.

1/19/19:  Came out super yummy and crispy.  I actually used chicken tenders instead of breasts.  With tenders, perhaps 1.5x the coating.

This was a very tasty dish. I would say the only thing I will change next time is to not add the butter at the top. I think it would have had a nice crispy outside. The butter left it soft. I used smoked paprika and it gave it a great taste.

This was a miss for us. We prepared as directed, but the chicken came out lacking in flavor. Plus, we were expecting more crispiness, but the breading stayed moist.

If I figure out how to get more crispiness without having to fry, I'll try it. 

I think also that seasonings need to be adjusted. If I make this again, I'll most likely use some seasoned salt, garlic powder, onion powder, some cumin, oregano, and chili powder in addition to the paprika. Maybe that will help give this better flavor.

We enjoyed this recipe, although, I needed more bread crumb mixture to coat my 3 chicken breast, so I'm not sure there's enough to cook the 4 suggested. Otherwise, it was nice and easy, but tasty. I think next time, I will add some lemon zest to the crumb mixture...

It tasted pretty good and everyone liked it.  Mine only made it 45 minutes in the oven and the cheese was getting pretty dark.  The chicken was cooked all the way through in spite of the shorter time in the oven than the recipe called for.

I cut the recipe in  half as there was only two of us and I split the paprika between smoked paprika and regular paprika.  I didn't have grated Parmesan but did have shredded so I used that instead - made a bit more crunchy.  I also didn't use as much melted butter.  It turned out very good and I will make it again.  Thanks.

Nice coating that stays on the chicken during baking.  Found it a bit too salty.  If your parmesan cheese is salty, cut down on the added salt.

I made this exactly as written and I just don’t understand. It is not as amazing as people say. First of all, the baking time was way too long and produced dry chicken. But even if it wasn’t dry, the flavor was lacking. I could taste the paprika a bit. I could taste the Parmesan a bit. I used expensive Parmesan that I grated myself on the spot. It just doesn’t do it for me. And considering how long it took to bake, I was really disappointed.

Found this recipe when I went to look to see what I needed for another favorite I had saved.  Looked easy and I had all the ingredients so why not try.  I did cut the recipe in half since it is just my husband and I these days.  We both loved it!  Next time I will try with Romano and Parmesan.

I used some of the suggestions: 1/2 tsp paprika, 1/2 tsp smoked paprika, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, for the cheese I used a purchased cheese mix of Parmesan, Romano and Asiago cheese. We loved it and will make again.

This will now be my go to recipe when I don't know what to do with chicken breasts.   I followed the recipe but only had two chicken breasts and  I subbed in some smoked paprika with the regular.    I think that having more coating made a difference, this was delicious.    The butter over the top PUTS it over the top.

like most people I said I made this recipe the posted how I completely made my own recipe and posted it as a review. I mean seriously what is wrong with you people. are you incapable of following a recipe? the way it is is delicious but I guess tell people how you did something wildly different and dont post it as a different recipe.

One of the best chicken recipes I've tried in a very long time!  Based on reviews,  I added some garlic powder and in addition to the regular paprika, added about 1/2 tsp. smoked paprika.  I used three huge breast - bigger than what you normally see in stores.  Baked for about an hour - used meat thermometer to be certain they were fully cooked.
Thinking I can use leftovers for chicken sandwiches or even some chicken salad.  Also wondering what this same recipe might taste like on pork chops.  
Whatever...my new go-to for chicken.

Love everything about it. Didn't change a thing other than the cooking time. I found it only need 25 to 30 minutes max. I have made it twice so far and my wife loves it.

I made this and followed the recipe exactly.  It was very good.  The only issue I have is that when the recipe calls for 4 skinless, boneless chicken breast haves but doesn't account that they need to be thick for the 1 1/2 hour baking time.  When I read the recipe, I thought that 1 1/2 was too long to bake the breasts, especially because the breasts I cooked were thinner.  I didn't listen to my instincts and my breasts came out dry.  I think that it would have been OK if they had been really thick.  There has to be a balance between the heat and time to make the Parmesan cheese create a crust and the breast to maintain their moisture.  I will make these again but tweak the recipe a bit to make sure that they are both "crusty and moist".  The best part about this recipe is that it's super easy and very tasty!!

Delicious! Huge hit with the family, will definitely be making again! I did take up the suggestions to add more cheese, less butter, and a dash of garlic powder- otherwise followed it closely, and it turn out moist and delicious- no leftovers!

Not my favorite, but the family did think it was ok. I probably would of added Romano cheese as well, a smoked Paprika and less butter. I haven't decided if I will remake it

I made this delicious Baked Paprika- Chicken recipe and it was wonderful. My husband even loved it, which he usually doesn't like chicken breast. The Chicken came out so moist, delicious, tasty and I defiantly will be making it again.

I  made this as written except for the addition of garlic powder as others had suggested.  I measured the breading as per the recipe and patted it on twice, which may have been too much.  I baked it for 45 minutes, as suggested, which was perfect.  The breading was just crunchy enough and the meat was tender with some juiciness, but there was just something about it we weren't thrilled with.

Simple yet very tasty. However if your breasts lean towards being on the larger side, I recommend doubling the dredge mixture.

This is delicious!! I doubled the recipe because I had a feeling that my family would love it and they did, me too! I added a small amount of garlic powder in the dry mix. 
I baked it for 45 minutes since we like the chicken on the thin side; perfect!
Thank You!

Great main dish. I did make some substitutions. I used House Autry breader instead of flour and Mrs. Dash garlic herb seasoning instead of salt. Also, I seasoned the dredge until it "smelled" right, so I'm sure I used more seasoning than suggested in the recipe. I hate thick pieces of meat, so I cut the chicken breasts in half so that there were two thin pieces rather than one. I baked for 45 min, turned off the oven, topped with shredded mozarella cheese and put back in the oven for  15 min. Served with wheat linguini and Bertolli marina sauce with a can of basil-garlic-oregano tomatoes.

Very good dish but I kicked it up a notch.
I did not have boneless chicken breasts so I cut the recipe in half and used two bone in Chicken thighs skin off.
I added a touch of Garlic and a hit of Cayenne for a nice kick.
Did not use so much butter on top and added more Parmesan prior to cooking it.
Cooked it on 350 for 1 hour only.
Your cooking times are off.
In my opinion if you cooked the breasts for 1.25 hrs they would be very dry especially if you have split them and made thinner. Maybe 45 minutes for that.
Last 2 minutes I put the oven on low broil to make it very crispy.
It was excellent, moist and very tender with a nice crisp to it.
I made it for my FB page COOK and Tell. 
Loved by all.

This is a keeper!! Used a little more parmesan and paprika than the recipe calls for. The chicken stays moist inside that parmesan coating. Moist on the inside and crunchy and golden on the outside. Liked it very much!!!

Great we even did a different way. We used zip lock bags for less clean up. While I took out my frozen tenderloins,in a Ziploc bag I had my son . Once thawed drain off access juice added salt & pepper. Wrapped parchment paper around the bag and tenderized the chicken.
We then preheat the oven to 450.
Next preped 2 separate bags one for the egg dip and the other for the flour.
   Now of course I substituted and omitted some ingredients we use wheat flour. I add more eggs , cheese, paprika, and no butter. We placed four tenderloins in the egg bag zipped it up and shake it up. Take them out ,put in flour bag repeat till you are finished with all your chicken. We placed all the chicken on pans line w/ parchment paper cooked about 20-30min til no longer pink inside.
This is quite a very simple easy to do recipe and very versatile you can make it your own and change it up make it Italian Chinese whatever you want include your children just use your imagination

The family really liked it.  I added the fresh garlic to the wet mixture and salt and peppered the chicken before the dredging process.  I also did the double dip and it was very crunchy.  I also cooked it for only 45 min, but could have taken it out at 35 minutes since I halved my chicken.

Excellent! Very easy and delicious. Takes no time to prépare. So much better than "carry out" chicken. Uses ingrédients that  you probably have in your kitchen.  And, best of all, no frying!

Loved this recipe. So easy to prepare. It smelled so good and was  so “delicious “. Can’t wait to try it again. I followed the recipe exactly. The chicken was not dry, but  the chicken breasts were very large as well as thick. Thank you for this wonderful recipe.   Judy

Super easy and delicious. Chicken was very moist.  Added leftover chicken to lunchtime salads. Will add a little more seasoning next time.

This was delicious. As others suggested, I used a good quality paprika, 1 tsp regular, 1 tsp smoked. I increased the Parmesan to 3/4 cup, and decreased the butter to 2 tablespoons. I double dipped the chicken to use up all the coating and I cooked them for 50 minutes which was perfect (they were half frozen). Will definitely make this again

Delicious!  Next time I will use chicken strips, a little more paprika and a little less butter. Like others noted, it only takes 40 -45 minutes to cook this to the proper temperature.

I didn’t have the paprika or plain salt, so I substituted these with garlic salt. I figured the garlic would give it a kick like paprika was expected to, and I have to say it turned out really good. I did bake it for about 45 minutes, checked it to see if the chicken was done, and then waited another 15 minutes before pulling it out of

I forgot to top chicken with butter!  It was still pretty good so I know would be great if directions are followed. I cooked at 375 for 30 minutes uncovered.

It was very good. I did add the garlic powder and my cheese was grated very coarsely. I also used 1/2 smoked paprika and 1/2 regular paprika. My chicken was done in 35 minutes, but I did use my oven on convection setting.

Delicious!  I doubled the recipe with no problem, except that I didn't double the butter.  I also added garlic powder, as was suggested by others.  I can't tell whether or not it was essential.  The only problem with the recipe is that the amount of cooking time is WAY too long.  I cooked it for 50 minutes, and I think even less would have been better.  (If you thin the chicken into cutlets, you can cut the time by a lot.)

I made this but was confused by the chicken breast halves.  They don't sell those anywhere around here, none of the butchers knew what I was referring to.  One said maybe the recipe author is confused and cut her chicken breasts in half.

So to clear up any confusion on chicken breasts - 
When a recipe calls for a chicken breast, it’s actually referring to a chicken breast half. A full chicken breast, rarely seen at the grocery store, would include the two halves connected by a breast bone, and is very rarely used in recipes.

In fact almost all recipes in the last 30 or 40 years have changed from calling for chicken breast halves to just chicken breasts as the half is what what is sold at stores.

So that made sense until I looked at the cook time.  You cut the breasts in half and cook them for over an hour at 350 and you'll have chicken breast leather.  

So maybe the author thinks they sell breasts by the pair since she has 2?  But then if you use 4 chicken breasts there's not enough dry ingredients to coat them all, considering the breasts they sell around here are all about a pound give or take.

So if you follow this recipe to the letter, you won't be able to eat the halved chicken breasts, unless you have sharp metal dentures.

What I did was took 2 breasts, cut them in half, followed the ingredients instructions, and cooked them for about 40 minutes.   The coating was crisp, the chicken wasn't totally dried out, still pretty most actually.

I didn't have any black pep

I've made this a bunch of times and it's delicious. I have three people in my family on keto diets, so to make a keto version, omit the flour or use mayonnaise to coat your chicken instead. Also, use the shorter cooking time.

Excellent dish, I must say its easy to make. I used regular paprika and cheddar cheese, the crust came out just right. The  chicken was juicy and nice not to dry . Disagree with the dish being bland as I seasoned my meat well  before hand and leaving to marinate  a few days before using. This bake chicken surely won a spot on my favorite  dish list.

This can definitely be a five star recipe if it’s tweaked a bit. I use thin sliced cutlets. 25 mins @ 400 is plenty to fully cook 4-5 cutlets. I also feel that although it seems like a bit much of butter, baking them on a wired rack helps tremendously. My cutlets were cooking in the butter basically on the sheet pan however they came out pretty decent. Partially crispy. I strongly recommend waiting about 10 mins before taking them off the pan as my bottom layer completely peeled off. Ugh.    I agree with others that the taste is a bit bland. I might make this again because it was easy peasy but next time I will use yogurt or buttermilk to dredge and perhaps a bit more spice like garlic powder or other seasoning to flavor it up. The cheese makes this recipe. To sum up, I like it but needs a kick up in flavor.

I've mad enough this about 3 times now. I do mine slightly different though. I use chicken that we've cut into strips, then I put it in a mayo and milk mixture, then into the breading. Also, I cook it for about 30-35 minutes. 

It's really good, and my husband requests it often.

So I made this recipe tonight but I included dried mustard along with the paprika garlic powder salt and pepper in the dry ingredients. I also added hot sauce to the dredge of egg and milk. I also used chicken thighs instead of chicken breast. Recipe came out fantastic and only cooked it for 45 minutes so the chicken was still moist.

Excellent dish! I will definitely make it again with a few changes. Good flavor, but for me needed an extra kick of spice. I'm going to add cayenne pepper next time, and a little less butter over the top.

I made this for company and it was very well received, although the time listed for the chicken made it come out a bit dry even though the chicken breasts were extremely thick. I cut down the butter as recommended but I think it might've been a little better had I used the designated amount. It's very true that the quality of the paprika you use makes a huge difference in the flavor of this dish. The better the paprika, the better the chicken flavor I think.  In any event, thanks for sharing!

Sssooooo good!  I didn't have paprika so I  didn't add it.  Dipped the chicken in the egg wash and parm mixture twice, and then topped with the butter. I did use fresh garlic and Sargento shredded Parmesan cheese to top the chicken and let it cook for about the last 10 minutes so it was all melted and  crunchy.  Served it with spaghetti and garlic bread.  My husband went back for seconds and he never does that.  Thanks for this as we will be adding it to our monthly menu.

I used some blended cheeses with the flour mix instead of just Parmesan. Cook for 45-60 mins otherwise the chicken gets a little dry. Tweaked a few things here and there but still is an excellent simple recipe!

My family loved this recipe. It was very moist and flavorful! I did add garlic powder to the dry mix increased the parmesean cheese to 3/4 cup. I also decreased the cooking time to about 45-50 min. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing.

Made this as directed. Everybody practically inhaled it. It was voted onto the rotate list. Very easy. My oven wasnt working so i had to make it on the stove the second time around, but it was still great. I have started pounding the chicken out for faster cook time. Thanks for this recipe

This was a pretty good, solid recipe and very easy. Not mind blowing though. The paprika doesn't really pack a flavor punch and I felt like the parmesan flavored the chicken more than the paprika. It had a nice mild flavor, good for kids. I grated a combination of parmesan and pecorino romano. The amount of coating was perfect for four chicken breasts, with not too much thrown away. Next time I might try to add some garlic powder to the coating like another reviewer suggested. This is a good standby recipe to go to when you have chicken of hand and need a way to prepare it with ingredients in your pantry.

I'm on a keto diet right now, so I substituted the all-purpose flour for almond meal.  The flavor was RIDICULOUSLY good.  The chicken wasn't as moist as I would have liked, but the crispy breading with with all of that parmesan was absolutely amazing.  I might have to substitute in some salsa or something for tomato sauce and adapt this recipe into a breaded chicken parmesan dish.  Net carbs for one 7oz piece of chicken breast was 3.  That's insanely convenient.

This was a great chicken recipe.  I made as written using freshly grated Parmesan (it is more work to grate it yourself but definitely worth it!).  I only had to bake mine for 40 minutes before it was cooked through.

I liked this recipe, but I agree with others that it could use a little more punch to the flavor. I did not have any eggs so I used warm olive oil with minced garlic instead, and it turned out real nice. Very easy, thanks!

I didn't like it so much it was boring, we ate it and no one complained, but I don't think I will make it again.  It looks pretty and maybe great to impress guess because it looks fancy.

Very easy.  Pretty good taste.  I think adding garlic to the flour mix would make it better.  I used whole wheat flour. FYI- Only took 30 mins. to cook.
