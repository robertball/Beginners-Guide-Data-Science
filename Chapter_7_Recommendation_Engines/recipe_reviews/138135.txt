Well, I guess this is one of those "don't knock it 'til you try it" recipes. I never thought I'd like pancake and egg sanwiches, but I did.  This is another combination of sweet and salty. I did add a couple of slices of bacon and overall it was pretty good. Not sure if I'd make it again but was glad I gave it a try.

I can't comment on the originality of this breakfast sandwich, because I don't eat at fast food places. However, I do eat blueberry bagels, and eggs, so I thought I would give it a shot. I scrambled an egg for my sandwich. It was ok - though I am not entirely sure I will eat this combination again, I am glad I tried it.

I used cinnamon raisin bagels and deli-sliced sharp cheddar cheese. The kids liked it okay--both of them remarked that they didn't like the sweet of the bagel with the egg/cheese. I would make this again but with a savory bagel, I think.

Personally I like using the "everything" bagel and swiss cheese.  But that's just my personal taste.  This is good, but face it folks it's a Mickey Dees Egg McMuffin on a bagel!

I used to do this all the time when I needed breakfast on the go. I used a few slices of lunch meat and put the cheese in the middle so it wouldn't squeeze out of the hole in the middle of the bagel. If I had time I would also warm the whole sandwich up so the cheese would melt, yummm!

I add cream cheese, link sausage cut in half lengthwise, top with egg and a slice of cheddar and broil on low..middle rack..until cheese melts nicely.
