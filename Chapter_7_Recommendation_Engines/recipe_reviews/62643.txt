The tarragon in this salsa makes it taste weird, and not in a good way.

I was very pleasantly surprised by this salsa.  It was flavorful and very fresh tasting.  My husband and I both scarfed this down and he can't stand green peppers.  The only change I made was a little dried tarragon because I didn't have any fresh.  Next time I may use a little more adobo sauce to spice it up a little more.

Adobo Herb Salsa Haiku: "Increased cilantro. And I dropped the tarragon. Nice adobo kick!" I love the smoky bite and spicy aftertaste that the adobo sauce gave this salsa; I didn't deviate from the recipe, except to scale it to half, so that I only had to use a 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes. The longer it sits in the fridge, the tastier it gets, so aim for more than the recommended 30+ min. Simply scooped up onto tortilla chips, this is a tasty, and easy, alternative to store-bought salsa. (Oh, and as a random side note, once you open the can of chipotles to measure out the adobo sauce, the perfect sized container for what's remaining in the can is a leftover Spice World 8 oz. jar of minced garlic.)

Excellent!  I love the adobo addition!  Adds such a great flavor.  I didn't have fresh tarragon and so I used dried instead.  I would definitely recommend this!

The tarragon gave this an unpleasant flavor.
