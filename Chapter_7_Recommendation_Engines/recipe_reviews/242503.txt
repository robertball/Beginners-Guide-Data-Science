Fast, simple, a great meal on a busy night, yet elegant enough for company. I served mine with Jasmine rice.

Used all the ingredients, and added minced garlic. I made 3 times the amount of glaze and marinated the salmon in it for 25 min  before broiling. Very tasty. will make again. thank you for sharing.

Simple, easy and flavorful!  No need to steam the asparagus unless large stalks.  Will be making it again.

I am not a big fan of salmon.  I would make it again but I would double sauce and add garlic.  I made it exactly the way recipe described.

This is an excellent preparation for quick, easy, delicious salmon filets that the whole family loves! I don’t bother with the asparagus because it’s not a favorite in our house. Just prepare the salmon as directed and add a side of stir-fried veggies with a teriyaki glaze and some steamed rice! Perfect!

This has a great taste! Broiling makes it, since its February and I can't grill it! I didn't have asparagus but was looking for a good sauce for my salmon. All I added was a clove of minced garlic! Excellent!

My husband and I were pleasantly surprised by this recipe. It was very easy to prepare and the flavor was really good. As other reviews have said, the asparagus probably doesn't need to be pre-steamed. Ours was over cooked.

I have made this recipe a few times for company and it was always a hit. I have also made it with a twist: a dash of sea salt, chili chipotle seasoning capers and fat-free raspberry vinaigrette dressing instead of the soy-glaze dressing. Simply scrumptious!!

Super simple dinner idea and quick too! I made it exactly as written. If your asparagus stalks are on the thin side which mine were, there is no real need to pre-steam since the roasting time will cook them perfectly. Or, if a little thicker, I would just toss them under the broiler a few minutes before the salmon. That way it's a one-pan meal! I would have liked a little more seasoning, possibly some garlic, or at least some garlic powder. I will try this next time.  Thank you Casie for the recipe!
