Fabulous as is, but who could resist making it even more intense.  I used 3 ounces of the chocolate instead of the 1 ounce, this created a more pronounced chocolate flavor.  Some of the other reviewers should try this recipe again with the additional chocolate and they will see it is a winner!
If the butter softens too much (as on a humid day) allow extra time for chilling the frosting before adding to the cake.

Unbelievably delicious!  This creamy frosting tastes like premium chocolate ice cream.  Spreads easily, even over delicate cakes.  I've been in the food industry for years, and this is hands down the best chocolate frosting recipe I've come across. Double the recipe for a 13 x 9.

Delicious, flavorful, fluffy, creamy and smooth  chocolate buttercream.  This is easily worked with to get the degree of chocolatiness you're looking for.  I used the pre-melted envelopes of unsweetened chocolate and added, I think,  two or three envelopes beyond what the recipe called for, not that it wasn't good without it - for the cake I used it on I just wanted it a deeper chocolate.  Leave out the chocolate, add a little less milk, and you've got a great vanilla buttercream!  I would double this recipe for a 9x13 cake or for a 9" layer cake and make even more if you want ample to pipe decorations.

Oh so good, and oh so chocolately!  I doubled this and used Ghiardelli chocolate sqares.  Very easy to work with and so good it was hard not to eat this before it got on the cake! I used it to frost and fill "Four Egg Yellow Cake" from this site.

very creamy easy-to-make frosting.  I recommend it.  Make sure to double it for a layer cake!  Also, if you use salted butter like I do, you should leave out the pinch of salt.

I used this recipe to frost my husband's birthday cake, and we both LOVED it! It was delicious and very easy to make, and best of all, didn't have that nasty, mouth-coating texture that a lot of buttercream recipes (usually the ones with shortening) have. I will definitely be making this again!

I did not personally taste this, but the rest of the family loved it.  I did make it with melted (added a little shortening) semi-sweet chips as it was all I had (instead of the melting- chocolate squares). I just melted 1/4 of a bag (I doubled the  whole recipe for a 9 x 13)in the microwave 1 minute to start then stirred, then 30 second intervals until smooth. Worked great.

This was incredibly good! I made it in less than 5 minutes, it tasted great, and it's a beautiful shade of creamy rich brown. Every chocolate lover will die with the melt in your mouth texture, and be screaming for more. Try this one recipe, it's great!

What? I doubled the recipe to frost 2 dzn cuppycakes. I followed the first step exactly with correct ingredients and it was not "light and fluffy" more stiff and doughy. I added the milk hoping it would help and it was just grainy. I ended up adding more butter and heavy whipping cream along with cocoa powder and it turned out great then. I would not make this recipe again.

Tripled this recipe as suggested and added 1/2 vanilla and 1/2 raspberry flavoring and it was DIVINE!  Was perfect to frost a 2 layer cake.  Topped it with fresh raspberries... YUM!

Very easy and good flavor. I used 2 oz of bakers chocolate and milk to the consistency I wanted. I even made my own powdered sugar. all you do is put one cup reg sugar and 1 1/4 tablespoon cornstarch into a blender and blend!!!

If you love chocolate, like my family, use 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa. It gives it a rich chocolate flavor that even me (not a chocolate fan) enjoyed.

Very easy.  I didn't change a thing. It was enough to frost a 9 x 13 cake. I will never buy canned frosting again.

DELICIOUS! I skipped the salt because I used salted butter, used one square of unsweetened chocolate and one chunk of dark chocolate that's equal to about 1.5 oz baking chocolate. Also had to add a fair amount more milk. Turned out really good! I had enough for 12 cupcakes, with an average amount of frosting per cupcake. If you really like to pipe on a big mound of frosting, increase the size of the batch.

Yum!  I use this regularly as is but most recently I used it to help me get to a rich red color for my daughter's birthday cupcakes.  It worked wonderfully!!  The frosting alone tastes fantastic and the chocolate aided in the coloring process.

Awesome frosting!  I will never buy frosting again!  I didn't have chocolate squares, so I used 4 1/2 Tablespoons cocoa powder and 1 1/2 Tablespoons oil (heat the cocoa powder mixture a bit in the microwave). Kids, everyone love it!

I liked this recipe pretty well.  I agree with earlier reviews that it's not overly chocolatey, so I would add more unsweetened chocolate for a richer flavor.  Altogether very good!

This is an idiot proof recipe for chocolate buttercream. Love it! It tastes great, not an overpowering chocolate flavor but still very rich.  

I would like to point out that at no time did my sugar and butter become "light and fluffy". It was more like a soft dough which just sucked up the chocolate and milk and magically transformed into perfect frosting. It is fun to watch this one come together!

This was very good! I quadrupled the recipe to make enough frosting for a four layer cake. I also added a couple more ounces for a deeper chocolate flavor. I loved this recipe and will definitely make again.

I used this recipe to frost the "4 egg yellow cake" from this site. I doubled it and it was enough to cover two 9in cakes with just a little leftover, so I added it to the top of the cake. It was perfect. Side note: confectioners sugar and butter will not be "light and fluffy" it will look like wet sand. Just continue to add the rest of the ingredients and mix, it'll turn out fine.

Really great recipe for frosting. Should double it though if you need to frost a whole 9 inch cake. Perfect for piping decorations! I used it for my twins' birthday cake. Turned out great! Looks beautiful, and tastes great too! Will have a picture soon..

We love chocolate cake but hate to overwhelm it with a too rich or too sweet or too heavy frosting.  This was none of those things....it was absolute perfection.  Light, fluffy, and a real chocolate flavor.  Don't change a thing, just double it to make more!!

This is a really quick and easy frosting. Don't panic if the powdered sugar/butter mixture doesn't get light and fluffy right away. It takes a couple of minutes to come together. It is not a super chocolaty frosting, it has a lighter flavor which goes well with dark chocolate cake or cupcakes. If you want a stronger chocolate taste, you could add more or darker chocolate.

Quite rich and yummy.  I made the base recipe the first time and it was incredible! The second time I made it, I added 1 1/2  teaspoon of instant coffee grounds to the milk (which I heated so the coffee would dissolve.)  I also added a heaping tsp of chili powder.  EXTRA YUMMY rich and a nice kick!


FOR NEW COOKS: Don't overcook the chocolate or you'll ruin it and DO NOT overbeat or the chocolate will break.

For anyone wondering, I yielded enough frosting to THINLY spread on 12 cupcakes. I stress the thinly part.
Really good flavor. I even added a bit of cold coffee for a little extra flavor.
I was worried a bit at first because the butter and sugar absolutely didn't come together until I added the chocolate and so on. Also, I needed to add a bit (1/4 C about?) extra milk to improve the texture, like others did.

Used orange extract instead of vanilla for a dark chocolate-orange-rum cake.  The frosting came out perfectly and was very easy to work with.

This will definitely become my go-to frosting. I substituted evaporated milk for regular milk and used two squares instead of 1-1/2. Loved it!!

I scaled the recipe way back because I was testing out frostings to practice some piping and I wanted to see what Allrecipes had. The taste wasn't bad, but it reminded me of a whipped version of the chocolate frosting in a container at the store. The only change I made was using heavy whipping cream instead of milk, because it was what I had out for another frosting recipe. It is probably not one I would use to frost a cake, as I prefer butter, but it was quick and easy to make and looks like it would hold up nicely to frost a basic chocolate cake or cupcakes.

This frosting was very difficult to work with until I added more than twice the amount of milk called for in the recipe. And it is way too sweet. I tripled it and it covered a two layer cake very well with a bit left over. Once I added all the extra milk it was very easy to work with but by then I had battled with it while putting on the crumb coat. I made this because I didn't have the ingredients for the buttercream I typically make (Martha Stewart's), I should have just made a quick trip to the store instead of fighting with this frosting.

This is one of the best frosting recipes I've tried! I doubled the recipe for a double layer 9 inch cake and it just barely covered it. My only complaint is that it was a little stiff, but I'll definitely use this recipe again and just try to tweak it so it's slightly creamier. All in all - VERY GOOD!!!

This frosting is fantastic!  It has a nice chocolate flavor to it without being overly chocolately.  I also like that it makes a small amount.  So many frosting recipes make a whole bucket full!  I always add the milk 1/2 T at a time to make sure it doesn't end up runny.  However, I've never had this recipe turn out runny and I've made it 3 times in the last month!  It's my new quick favorite for cupcakes!

This is a rich, delicious, chocolate icing, which is also easy to make. Next time I'll double the recipe so I can cover my cake more generously. I used this recipe with the Four Egg Yellow Cake from this 'site for my husband's birthday cake and he loved it.

Great frosting!! I am not a chocolate fan, I made this for a friend's cake. I couldn't stop sampling this as I prepared it. I used an extra block of chocolate to make it extra fudgy. (A recipe has to knock my socks off to give it 5 stars.)  Wouldn't hesitate to make this again. It gets 5 stars for ease of preparation.

This frosting was very stiff and hard to spread.  I had to add more milk to make it creamier and I still was not satisfied.  You will need to double it to frost a 2-layer cake.  The taste is OK but I don't think this is the recipe I'm looking for.  I'll keep looking.

This was wonderful!!!  I doubled the recipe to frost a layer cake.  The only change I made was substituting 1 1/2 Tablespoons of milk, with Kalua (adult Birthday Cake).  Everyone raved about the flavor!  I did panic a bit at first...while mixing the butter and sugar together, it got very dry.  But, I continued to mix, and it did turn in to a creaming mixture.  Thanks for a keeper!!

This is the best buttercream recipe I've found so far! The texture was smooth and the flavor oh so buttery! I wanted just a basic buttercream so I left out the chocolate. I used a butter spread (didn't have enough "real" butter on hand), so it wasn't as thick as I'd wanted. Can't wait to try it with real butter!
***02/03/07 UPDATE: Used real butter this time and it the consistency was great. I used it to decorate the cake and it wasn't too soft of gooey. It kept the shape of the designs.  Awesome recipe!!!

This frosting is wonderful!!!  I have bought the chocolate buttercream frostings in a can but they were never exactly what I wanted.  This recipe was perfect!  I will not buy chocolate frosting from the store again!  Also, just in case someone needs to know, I was able to frost a 9x13 cake using the recipe as is.

Absolutely fantastic!   I made it as written, but I didn't have milk so I used half & half.  It was fabulous on an eclair cake, and will become my go-to recipe for anything calling for chocolate frosting.  All of my previous attempts have used cocoa powder, but this one came together much better with the baker's chocolate.  Thanks for this recipe!

I really liked the flavor of this frosting. It was perfect. But It wasn't very easy to spread. Although I didn't put it on cookies. I put it on cake, layer cake. Maybe that makes a difference. It basically ripped the cake apart even after freezing it. So I warmed the frosting in the microwave and that worked better until it cooled again. It isn't very pretty, but oh well it still tastes good. :)

I used the 3 oz of chocolate as suggested.  Good recipe, not too sweet.  Enough to frost an angel food cake.

I had some chocolate seize on me (whoops!) so I tripled this recipe and used my seized chocolate in place of the melted chocolate (I used about 6 oz chocolate) and it turned out wonderfully!

Very nice with a not too chocolate punch. You will need to add more chocolate if that's your thing, but I like the light flavor this has. However, it is very sweet. I would cut the sugar a little, but a very easy and good recipe!

oh my goodness this is good! My best friends birthday called for cupcakes, and I had no clue what to frost them with. This recipe seemed to rate well among others, so iI decided to take a cance. It was so delicious that I used it for my sister's birthday cake (her birthday was on the same day). This recipe is soooooo easy and made with ingredients I often already have on hand. My only suggestion is to frost your item immediatly so the frosting doesn't become too hard and dry to spread.

I couldn't believe it when it was the day of my daughter's birthday and I had no cocoa in the house and no shortening to make a pure chocolate buttercream frosting.  So I jumped into 'allrecipes' knowing that I'd find an alternative.  VOILA!  I found this!  It is now THE chocolate frosting recipe for my house.  The only change I made was that I used semisweet ounce bars instead of unsweetended, only because that's what I had in the house.  It's a wonderful recipe that I will happily add to my binder.  Thank you!

Quick, easy and delicious, I just have to make a few changes 'cause I only have  semi-sweet chocolate, so I used 1 oz of chocolate and 2 Tbs. of cocoa powder,besides I used a hint of cinnamon. My husband loved the icing too. A keeper. Thanx a lot for this recipe.

Very good.  I liked using the melted chocolate rather than cocoa powder.  It gave the frosting a better chocolate flavor!  I did have to double the recipe for a 2 layer cake but I do like a lot of frosting!

Like others here I had to double the recipe because the original doesn't make much. The double recipe frosted 24 cupcakes nicely. I used almond extract instead of the vanilla just for a little different taste.

This is the frosting I will use from now on!  It's not too sweet and has a light, easily spreadable texture. I did notice, however, that a single batch is not enough to cover the top and sides of a 9x13 cake; but making a second batch and mixing it with the first works great.  This is the frosting I've been looking for for ages!

I read everybody's review before trying a recipe, and have several comments.  First, I agree that it is fabulous.  I doubled the chocolate as suggested, but then found it much too thick to spread.  So gradually I added more milk, 1 tablespoon at a time.  Using a double recipes, I used not only the 3 tablespoons of milk called for, but another four as well!  Lastly, some people complained about the difficulty in creaming the butter and confectioners sugar.  They may have used a large mixer as I did (no choice) even though the recipe called for a small bowl.  I just kept mixing and scraping down the sides, and after 15 minutes it was thoroughly mixed.  I don't think it would have ever reached the same texture as creamed grandulated sugar and butter, but once it is so creamed that it is almost solid, that's plenrty.

Fantastic recipe!  We used it on "Jan's Chocolate Cake" also found here.  I made it for my 24 year old's birthday and the entire family was so impressed as it rivaled any good bakery product.  We liked the light chocolate flavor and I agree with the professional baker's comment...excellent and easy frosting.

Although the recipe tastes EXCELLENT, I think you should mention in the instructions the approximate time we should be mixing the sugar and butter before adding the chocolate. I started to panic when it wasn't coming together and it ended up looking like little pearls in a bowl. I put it on the stove and everything finally came together.

This frosting is heavenly! I used salted butter, and 1/4 cup semi-sweet chips. It turned out  so creamy and delicious...easy, too...I'll never buy the yucky store tubs again!

it's great i tried it and a lot of people is now placing an order of one for them,everyone's love the chocolatey taste it's just that it's overly sweet and lacking of moisture but i want to try adding a tsp. of glycerin just to add moist in it, and it's perfect in chocolate cake with a caramel filling.

This was easy to make.  The taste was great on a 2 layer cake!  Used cream instead of milk, but really looking forward to next time to try kahula!!!

I like the taste of this frosting a lot. I used it with the Cherry Chocolate cake, which I made twice. I scaled the recipe to make 12 servings, but there wasn't enough liquid. For 12 servings, it said use 1/4 cup butter + 2 tablespoons of butter, but I had to use 1/2 cup butter. I also used half and half instead of milk. This was just enough to cover the cake. I would make for 14 or 16 servings next time in order to have enough.

I wanted something chocolatier.  It was too light in color and flavor.  The best chocoate frosting recipe (so far) on this site is "The Best Chocolate Frosting" recipe.  To make this recipe darker and more flavorful, I used elements of that recipe (added more butter and cocoa powder).  It was great - so the two recipes mixed together is also really nice.

Didn't care for the flavor with the unsweetened chocolate.  Redid the recipe with semi-sweet and it was a bit better tasting.

Very nice, not super sweet, frosting.  Made exactly by the recipe.  You would have to double/triple the recipe for a layer cake.  Frosted the top of a 9x13 sheet cake.

Makes a very nice frosting... It spreads very well, and it's delicious! I would have appreciated knowing how much cake the recipe covers, though. I ended up tripling the recipe for the 9-inch, double-layer cake I made. Worked out perfectly.

I made 16 servings of this frosting for some cupcakes for my moms birthday, and the whole family loved it! I used cocoa powder instead of chocolate squares. Our family likes DARK chocolate, so I decided to add 8 TBSP (1/4 cup) instead of just 3. The more cocoa that I added, the tougher the frosting became. To fix this, I added a total of 5 TBSP of milk. I really liked this recipe and will make it again in a heartbeat.

I made it as directed, although I cut the recipe in half to frost the top only of a 9 x 13 cake. It was easy, and it turned out silky and light. I will make it again!

Delicious! I used all 4 oz. of chocolate, 2 sticks of butter, and a whole 2 lb. bag of powdered sugar.  Added milk til i got the right consistency.  The perfect chocolate buttercream.  Had enough to ice 24 cupcakes and 12 mini cupcakes.

I followed the recipe except I used several tablespoons of Coco Powder instead of the melted chocolate and it was fabulous!  I added 8 Tbsp + of the coco powder until it turned a deep chocolate color...and had a smooth dark chocolate taste without being too sweet. It spread easily and kept its fluffy shape! Even my husband (who doesn’t really do sweets) loved it! Best chocolate frosting ever!

Could someone tell me if this buttercream firms up after a while? Every time I have a recipe that calls for melted chocolate, it comes out very smooth and spreadable, which is great, then after an hour or so, it hardens :(

Great recipe! I made it for my Grandmas's birthday cake and it tasted amazing! It is very smooth and with some of the buttercream recipes I'v tried, the frosting separated and looked weird, but I didn't have a problem with this one! My only complaint is that it almost didn't make enough frosting for the cake. If you plan on doing anything elaborate, maybe double the recipe. (:

I tripled the recipe and only used 3 cups of sugar,  still sweet enough, maybe even a bit more thanews I like.  I also added mire chocolate.   To make it a bit creamier I mixed a small  chocolate pudding with just one cup of milk.  It set perfectly and was a little less sweet.

As said before add extra chocolate per taste.  In fact, I doubled the recipe for a 9 x 13 cake and only had 1.5 ounces of unsweetened chocolate, so I added 4oz of semi-sweet chocolate.  Yummy, but I love chocolate!!  Will make again!

I thought it was delicious but I did make a change. I felt it was too runny so I had to add some confectioner's sugar to stiffen it up.  Otherwise it was dripping off the cake.  Plus I made 1 1/2 times the recipe as I needed more for a 2 layer 9" round cake.  I put it in the refrigerator which firmed up the frosting and made it a cool delicious dessert.  I paired it with the one bowl chocolate cake III recipe.

It's pretty good. I would make it again, although I added extra chocolate per some other reviewers' recommendations. Also, I used more milk/cream to make it creamier. It was too thick to spread with only 3 tablespoons. I would recommend a stand mixer to really get this fluffy. There's no way to do it properly without at least an electric mixer.

Definitely dry until. Added a little more milk. First beating sugar and butter did not become fluffy. Also leave out salt unless  you use sweet butter.

This is the most chocolatey frosting I've ever made. The kids loved it. I took the advice of other reviewers and added an extra 1oz of chocolate to the recipe and doubled it so it would frost 15 cup cakes. Because I was using it as frosting, I added milk to it was the right consistency; otherwise I found it thick.

If I wasn't using it for cupcakes, I would leave the thick consistency for brownies.

Yum-o! This is a light, fluffy, delicious buttercream frosting. I made it to go on a 13x9 cake, so I doubled the recipe and it was a perfect amount. This is definitely one that you can play with to get it to just the right amount of sweetness and chocolate. My hubby and I like sweet frosting, so I added a little more sugar to the mix. Doubling the chocolate was perfect. Will definitely be keeping this one.

Hassle free recipe, great base, to which I added: 1 T. espresso powder, and 1 t. ground cinnamon. For the vanilla, I used Mexican vanilla. For the chocolate, I used 4 squares of Ghirardelli 70% cacao baking chocolate. For the milk, I added light cream 'til I got the consistency I needed for my cake.

It's a really yummy frosting, with no cooking or any complicated processes. Love it.

I didn't like how it didn't tell how much cake it would frost. I made a 24in sheet cake and needed to double the recipe. Then I made an 8in round and had a half of a bowl of frosting left. I didn't know if I should save it, glob it on, or throw it away. I saved it and eventually it got mouldy so I had to throw it away, wasting so much frosting

Quick and easy recipe. Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate squares and popcorn salt made a great combination.  I ended up using a splash more milk. This worked well on brownies. There was plenty for an 8x8 pan.

This recipe is spot on! I doubled it and because of the warm humid day had to stick the frosting in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.  Put it back on stand mixer for a couple of minutes where it quickly changed to a beautiful airy chocolate buttercream! Frosted a 9" layer cake, but I would triple it next time just because it would be extra wonderful! I have deleted every other chocolate frosting recipe and will keep this as my go-to.

Absolutely delicious!  Took advice from BenzGal and used 3 oz. chocolate. Your may think at first that it could be grainy but just keep beating...smooth and decadent!

Tastes like Sprinkles Frosting!! This is the best chocolate frosting I have ever made! I was looking for one that tasted like the Sprinkles frosting and I found it!! yummy!! Followed directions, 2 recipes will almost frost 22 cupcakes. (but as you can see I made a box of cupcakes and only made it to 22 not 24...)

I used heavy whipping cream, because everything is better with real cream!  I've made a lot of chocolate icing recipes and his is my favorite.  I like that there is not too much butter that the frosting melts when the cupcakes sit out for a little. Delicious!

Frosting was simple and quick to make. Taste is pretty good but tastes a bit like packaged. Very spreadable for simple frosting but does not hold up for piping. After about 10 rosettes it became mushy and unsuitable for piping. Thanks for the recipe- may use again for a quick frosting perhaps for a crumb coat but my hunt for the perfect buttercream continues

At first when I was whipping it it looked grainy and I was a little concerned, but I kept whipping it and not a moment after it came out nice and light, not heavy at all. I thought it was a bit too light in colour so I added a little cocoa powder (as I wasn't bothered to melt more chocolate) and it did the trick - nice and glossy, and not too sweet. Will use it again!

I love baking cupcakes and cakes but I can never find a good frosting recipe that works. When I tried this recipe I loved it but I didn't have chocolate but I made it any way and absolutely loved it it is by far my favorite frosting.

Rich, and the frosting still pairs well with a heavy chocolate cake. I used more powdered sugar than the recipe called for, though.

I followed the directions with one slight change. After beating the butter with sugar, I didn't have the light and fluffy texture that I was expecting. So, I warmed up the milk and beat it for a few seconds and the texture was perfect. I also used double the chocolate for a richer flavor. For a double chocolate cupcake, pair it with the Chocolate Cake II recipe. This recipe only frosted one dozen cupcakes, so next time I will double the ingredients!  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I made this exactly as directed in the recipe except that I tripled the batch. The flavor was really good and at first the texture was great, too. It was fluffy, light, and flavorful. As time wore on, however, it just got stiffer and drier... never to the point of crumbling during cutting like some mentioned in their reviews, but let's just say I didn't have to worry about the cake sticking to the plastic wrap I covered it with! The three batches gave me barely enough to cover a 9" round layer cake and that was not using it between layers (I used Cream Cheese Frosting II for that). Still, the men in the house thought it was awesome and that I was a genius. The 3 stars are my opinion, not theirs! I may keep looking, but this recipe will do in a pinch. Just spread it quickly and don't refrigerate it before using it. My leftovers were solid as fudge long after pulling them out of the fridge.

I doubled the recipe (to frost 24 cupcakes) and threw in an extra square of Baker's chocolate per the advice of other reviews.  The frosting tastes delicious, very chocolatey. My only reservation is the consistency. It seemed a little dry. Perhaps I needed a few more drops of milk, but I don't think that was exactly it.  It also seemed slightly grainy. I'm not sure what it was but when I frosted the cupcakes, you could see a few grains of something... sugar? butter?... I don't know what. Could have been my fault for not beating the butter and sugar long enough or for not sifting the sugar. Maybe a little shortening would have made a smoother, glossier frosting? Next time I might substitute a little shortening for some of the butter, 1 part shortening to 3 parts butter, perhaps.  Thanks for the recipe.

Exactly what I was looking for....fluffy, creamy, chocolatey frosting, without that cocoa-ey taste.  YUM!!!  I tripled it to frost and fill a 9" layer cake and it was way more than I needed.  I had to throw the extra frosting away because my family and I couldn't stop eating it.  Only change I made was to make it a "mocha" frosting by adding a couple teaspoons of instant coffee to the melted chocolate/milk.  So good!!!  Also, don't worry if the powdered sugar/butter doesn't end up "fluffy" on its own, as the first step suggests.  It will all come together and get fluffy once the other ingredients are added and you beat it on high for a bit.  YUM!!

My new favorite frosting! I just finished making this for my father-in-law's birthday and it was soooo easy! I did double the recipe and I added a total of 5 chocolate squares. I am so glad I found this recipe. This will be the only chocolate frosting recipe I use from now on!

Delicious and SO easy!!! After beginning, however, I had to double everything when I saw this would only make a very small batch.  I'd consider tripling it for a layer cake even.  Be SURE to lick the beaters! :cD

This recipe is so easy and tastes so good! I did use chocolate chips instead of unsweetened chocolate squares, and I melted between 2 and 3 ounces. It gave the frosting a little more of a chocolate taste, which is what I was going for.

Nice texture. And great rich color. The taste however is not so great. I did double the recipe for a 9in layer cake. It was more like fudge than frosting (in my opinion). I followed the recipe and found it hardened quickly, and hardened on the cake. This frosting would be good on brownies, just not light enough for cake.

This recipe is great as-is, but it's definitely open to changes based on personal preference. For example, I thought the final product was too thick for my taste, so I added small amounts of milk and butter.  Two batches frosted 24 cupcakes well - a flat layer of frosting, though not too thin. Good recipe overall!

I made this for a birthday cake.  It was great!  Everyone loved it.  I did have to double the recipe for a layer cake, and it was a bit thick, so I added an extra tablespoon of milk.

Honestly best icing for a plain chocolate cake... I needed a go to recipe, and this is now it! To thicken the icing for decorating, just add more confectioners sugar.  Want vanilla? Just don't add the chocolate! This is awesome.  Thanks for sharing!

I combined this with the Dark Chocolate Cake II recipe on here and it was a fantastic combo. The frosting itself is a bit much on its own - very sweet - but with the cake it was divine. I made a layer cake and had to make 2 batches of the 16 servings size. My co-workers annihilated it in 30 minutes this morning. I did make the frosting with bittersweet baking squares instead of unsweetened squares. I'm thinking that was what put it over the edge, however I'm glad I did. The cloud I was riding on after all the compliments I received was well worth it!

I only thought this was so-so.  The frosting is very thick and almost fudge like.  I should have thinned it a bit more with milk, but followed the recipe as is.  I think I will keep looking for a different chocolate frosting recipe.

This frosting tasted amazing and makes icing a cake simple.  The consistency is perfect (unless you let the butter get too soft, then it's harder to work with).  You can add as much or as little chocolate as you want.  I made a two-layer cake and made the inside frosting very chocolatey and left the outside much lighter.  Both were delicious!  I think I'll try it with butterscotch, white chocolate, peanut butter....  A definite keeper!

My new favorite recipe for chocolate frosting. I love the use of baking chocolate instead of cocoa powder.  It just makes the frosting taste so much better.

The flavor was good after some modifications, but not excellent. The texture was still a bit gritty but perhaps I didn't beat it long enough or add enough milk to make it more creamed. I used 2 ounces of unsweetened chocolate squares, 2 cups of powdered sugar and a whole stick of unsalted butter. I used more milk than what it called for too. I did like the flavor, but the texture wasn't what I was looking for.

Yummy-did double for a layer cake.  You can easily add more chocolate or more powdered sugar to taste.  It is easy and nice and creamy.

This was a very easy, very delicious recipe. As with most recipes, you will need to be flexible and adjust as necessary when making it, but it is probably one of the best frostings I have made/had. If you beat it a little while longer, you will have a frosting that is extremely tasty and very light, perfect for a lighter cake. I would not recommend this frosting for a moderate to heavy cake.

Very disappointing.  Followed directions exactly (only doubled to use on 2-layer cake)  Really dry & not as rich as hoped for -- will not make again.  Store bought would have been better!

It's flavor was decent but the texture was aweful. It was very fluffy, too fluffy. Not creamy at all. I followed the recipe exactly.

This frosting is really good--I found that 1/4 c. butter wasn't enough compared to the amount of powdered sugar--when I mixed the two, the result was dry and crumbly, not "light and fluffy," so I added the other half of the stick of butter and it seemed to be just right then.  I used this on a red velvet cake and it was great, but if you want to use it on a cake, you'll probably need to double the recipe.

I put this on the cherry chocolate cake, it was very good. It may have been a little too rich though.
