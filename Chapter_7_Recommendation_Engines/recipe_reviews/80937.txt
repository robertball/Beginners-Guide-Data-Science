I actually made my vegetables in a skillet instead of on my griddle. I used fresh mushrooms, red pepper and I added some fresh minced garlic and sauteed it with a little butter. I used Johnny's Seasoning Salt (Seattle, reppin' here!). For the rolls, I did spread them with garlic butter before toasting  I did not eat this but my boys did and they really liked it. It was very simple, used on hand ingredients AND I was able to make dinner in no time. I'll use this recipe again. NOTE: It's really sad when people downrate a recipe due to them not being "authentic" or not what they expect a "real" version of the recipe to be. Everyone has their own take on what they think is good food. For us, we liked this (with a few small changes to suit what worked for us) and we'll make it again.

A great tasting sandwich.  I reduced the sodium content from 2794mg to 531mg by using fresh mushrooms and subsituting 4 slices mozzarella cheese in place of 8 slices provolone cheese.

Ohhh---this was yummy...and EASY!!!  A definite winner all the way around in my family.  I don't usually care for roast beef, but when it was cooked up for these sandwiches---Delicious!  I bought shaved roast beef from the deli and cooked it on the griddle with only Seasoned Salt and pulled it apart with two forks as it cooked.  I sauteed the onions and peppers in a pan with some olive oil and toasted the hoagie rolls under the broiler.  Set the sandwiches out on the table with some mayo and they were gone in no time flat!  My husband even said they were better than the ones he had in Philly on his last trip! We'll be making these again!

Great recipe. I separately sauteed sweet onions & a variety of peppers & a clove of garlic (didn't have any mushrooms but they would be great in this recipe) in a skillet with some olive oil, then piled on my sandwich before I put the cheese on. I also toasted sandwich rolls on the griddle next to the roast beef. Also added a smear of mayo and a squirt of mustard to the bread. Delicious!

This was okay - I definitely wouldn't make again - doesn't even come close to a real Philly Steak sandwich.  I'd rather have the real thing.

There is no "roast beef" in a Philly cheese steak, there is no such thing as a "Submarine Roll" in a philiiy cheese steak it's called a "Hoagie" roll the brand Used in Philly are "Amoroso" rolls. I have bought allot of rolls, and the only other one that comes close believe it or not is from Sam’s club. the first two pictures are not "Hoagie" rolls, they are cheap store bought, mass market knock off rolls, the 3rd picture is a real "Hoagie" roll, but the Ingredients are actually from a sandwich called "Hog Island" sandwich That was created at a World War I era shipyard "Hog Island" in Philadelphia And has nothing in common with this recipe or a philly cheese steak. Let’s just call this a roast beef sandwich.

We loved this!  So quick and easy to make.  I don't have a griddle so I used my cast iron skillet.  I also sauteed the onions first for just a few minutes, then added the other veggies.  I sliced the meat up and added it to the skillet, mixed everything together and let it heat thoroughly.  Buttered some sub rolls, put them under the broiler to lightly toast, topped with the meat mixture, cheese slices and then back under the broiler to melt (I know, not the way a Philly is done).  They were super good!  Thanks so much for sharing this simple, tasty idea.  We'll be making this often.

These sandwiches were wonderful!  I sauteed the meat and veggies in separate skillets for the sake of having enough space.  I used some butter and minced garlic for the veggies and a tiny bit of olive oil for the meat because I had very lean roast beef from the deli.  I also used pepper on both.  I put my buns under the broiler for a minute to brown them before assembling the sandwiches.  I used a little smear of mayo on them also.  I have been looking for a yummy steak sandwich to make at home for some time and these were really tasty!  My husband and two year old also loved them.  Thank you!!  :o)

Very good.  I made this 2 ways. The first way was according to the recipe except omitting the mushroooms because we didn't have any on hand and this was good.  The 2nd improved version was by sauteing the veggies - onions (red & white) and bell pepper - in olive oil.  Then I added the a mixture of sliced roast beef and italian beef and some dried parsley and jalapeno peppers.  Once the mixture was warmed I added 1/8 block of cream cheese to enhance the creaminess and served on submarine rolls with provel cheese, swiss, and mozarella instead of the provolone. This was much better!!!!

Easy. Fantastic. Perhaps I kept the beef on too long or had the griddle temp too high, but the beef dried out a bit. It may be helpful to put the vegetables on first for a few minutes, and then the beef toward the end. Great recipe.

These are awesome. I got the rarest roast beef from the deli because I didn't want it to dry out . I omitted the mushrooms because we don't like them and  added fresh garlic to the veggies. I also used mozzarella and white cheddar instead of provolone because that's what I had. I put them in the oven until they were toasted. So good.

Great and super easy.  Started dinner and 15 minutes later it was on the table.  Tip:  if you are making multiple sandwiches, and each eater has different tastes (i.e. some like peppers, some like saltier meat, some don't) make each sandwich separately and wrap in foil.  Keeps them hot until ready to serve.

I had a lot of deli roast beef leftover and decided to give this a shot.  We loved it!  I don't have a griddle so I used a cast iron skillet.  The only thing I'll change next time will be to add a little olive oil to the skillet for the onion mixture.  Great!!!

This is sooo easy and very good! I brushed my sandwich rolls with butter, sprinkled with garlic salt and popped them under the broiler for a few minutes. I also used fresh mushrooms and added mayo because my boyfriend and I like mayo on our cheesesteaks. I will definitely make these again!

This was soooooooo good.  My husband loves these but has to cut back on his salt, so this is a treat once a month.  Since he loves these I've tried to scale it down so he can eat them more often.  I now cut out the salt and seasoned salt and replace with garlic powder and pepper to taste.  I saute onion and finely diced up green pepper and fresh diced mushrooms in a little EVOO.  I like to use left over pot roast or beef or even deli roast beef, cooking and chopping into fine pieces till heated through.  Add cheese till melted then put into whole wheat pita bread. Yummy Yummy Yummy.

My son made this recipe as is and gave it 4*'s.  I just made it for the family and tweaked it a little.  I always freeze left over gravy and au jus from my roast so I took the roast beef and simmered it in au jus.  Then while the veggies sauteed  I spread the buns with garlic butter and broiled them.  I loaded on the meat, veggies and cheese put a couple slices of provolone cheese on top and returned it to the oven until the cheese melted.  We used the au jus for dipping and it was WONDERFUL! Five stars...and then some!

I wanted something different for a friday night meal besides the chinese take-out or pizza delivery. Philly cheese steaks came to mind and in my search  for a recipe I came across this one. Not too complicated and minimal ingredients. Well it came out so perfect and tasty. I was impressed and have since added to the dinner rotation.

Great roast beef sandwich def. not a steak sandwich though- I reduced most of the ingredients cause if you look at the nutrition info. way too many calories and fat.

I brought my griddle on our vacation and used it in our hotel room.  This recipe was PERFECT for us.  My husband and I added griddled mushrooms and onions to our sandwiches while the loved them with the roast beef and mozarella cheese.

Had a craving and these hit the spot.  After the frying stage I piled everything on fresh hoagies, topped with massive amounts of provolone and stuck them under the broiler for a few minutes (just a preference).  The kiddies, who had no idea what a "Philly Steak Sandwich" was are now hooked!  With all that grease and cheese how could they not! lol  Oh BTW, I didn't have mushrooms but didn't miss them either :)

Kinda bland but decent for a make-at-home version of the philly cheesesteak. Definately toast the hoagie rolls.

My husband made these twice, and they were a hit both times.  He's pretty particular about his Philly sandwiches, but this one made the cut.

Added fresh sliced mushrooms instead of canned as well as minced garlic and black pepper. Cooked my veggies in olive oil and butter. Relatively easy to make.

This was so excellent!  The key is to keep pulling apart the beef while it's cooking so it's very small pieces (I used two forks).  I used Angus round steak and it got five stars from everyone at my house.

Really quick and simple!!  The kids, however, were sure quick to pickout the wonderful veggies - how typical.  My husband suggested maybe an aujus to dip, as it was a little on the dry side.  I will definetely make again!

Wow!  Super easy and very tasty. Even the picky one liked it!  Recommend a few less slices of cheese unless you're a big cheese fan. If you're in a bind for the seasoning Montreal Steak seasoning works great.

My family and I love this!  Next time I'm going to get the roast beef shaved, the guy at the deli did not slice it as this as I would have liked. 
I also made Au Jus for dipping which was a hit as well!

Very good, just what I was looking for. I used a left over BBQ steak from the night before.

I made this recipe exactly as written.  It came out very good tasting but a bit dry for my taste.  I made it again a few days later, using the same ingredients , softened the veggies in a microwave with a tiny bit of butter and warmed the roast beef in a frying pan with a tiny bit of butter.  Then I put the sandwiches together, put the cheese on top, and put them in the microwave for 30 seconds to melt the cheese.  They came out warm, moist, and delicious.  I served them with a small bowl of au jus.  Perfection!

I made this for the Super Bowl.  They were a hit.  Everyone loved them.  I used aged cheddar cheese and actually forgot the seasoned salt.  There was enough flavor in the aged cheddar that it wasn't missed.  I will make these again

Easy and delicious. I didn't have a griddle so just used a large pan. Also used fresh sliced mushrooms instead of canned. So good!

This was so easy and so good!  My husband suggested cheese whiz on it just like they do on Philly. I told him I'd buy him the cheese just for him because I liked this just the way it was!

Very good but needs mayo or something else for moisture.

I used olive oil and season salt and added banana peppers to the mix. Loved them! Could have doubled it to save more fixings for later! Super easy and fast!

We loved these simple, tasty sandwiches!  I cleaned out my cheese drawer and used provolone, swiss and pepper jack.  All three were tasty, but the pepper jack was my favorite!  Thanks, AUTUMNHEARTS!
