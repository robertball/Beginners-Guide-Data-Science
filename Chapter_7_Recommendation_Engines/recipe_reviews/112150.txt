I enjoyed this recipes as it was very simple and healthy.  I used a crockpot instead of my oven and I ended up with very tender vegetables and lamb.  I would add a little more salt, but otherwise it was a great meal.

I followed this recipe pretty closely and it came out so, so yummy. My Easter guests raved about it. I  added a few tweaks of my own though. First off, When I floured and seared the meat, I added some ground coriander and freshly ground fennel seed to the flour, salt and pepper mix. I also added a large can of organic diced tomatoes to the stewing liquids. Finally, I agree with one reviewer who said it would be too greasy, so I degreased the gravy at the end by removing the cooked meat to a dish, skimmed the top couple inches of the roasting liquid into a foil bread pan, and stuck it in the freezer for about 20 minutes while I mashed the potatoes and cooked the green beans. Once the fat hardened, I just scraped it away from the juices underneath. (I'm glad I did because it was about a cup of fat! ) Then I added the  juices back to the pot on the stove top, simmering for a few minutes to heat it back up and thicken.

Heavenly is the right word for it. I was a little conserned at first about all the garlic, but when it was cooked the flavor was so good that i wouldn't change a thing. Thank you very much this will very quickly be come a favorite in our house.

Made it last year with 12 lamb shanks for a bunch of friends and they loved it so much!  Trying this delicious dish again tonight with extra splash of red wine(personal preference!)

This would have gotten a high review but for one problem. Flavor was just great, however recipe should have stated that juices should be degreased and strained. You may want to pick out the veggies you want to eat also so you don't get the bits of pepper and herbs in sauce. My leeks also disappeared into mush, so it would have been nice to strain it out. Pull out the shanks and veggies you want, strain and degrease the stock, put it all back together to warm up and I think this recipe will be just wonderful.

This was delicious! I was in a hurry so I didn't even sear the shanks. Just threw it in a crock pot and let it cook for 6 hours. Next time I'll add some new potatoes.

The flavor was good, but way too greasy!  If I ever make lamb shanks again, I think I will boil them first to get some of the grease out.  Update: I did make this again and boiled the lamb shanks first.  I drained the water and cut off as much fat as I could.  The meat was falling off the bone so I made this into soup.  It did take care of the grease problem, however.

This is the first time I have had lamb I actually liked! We got our shanks from a local organic farmer.  The meat was so buttery and tender, it fell off the bone, and the gravy I made with the juices was full of flavor. I roasted the shanks in my Le Creuset, and it turned out perfectly in 3 hours. The only change I made was since it is December and I had no fresh herbs, I used dried Herbes de Provence. I'm sure it would be even better with fresh herbs. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was amazing! I didn't have rosemary so I used sage. I cooked these in te crockpot for 8 hours and they were fall off the bone tender. I will definitely make these again when we have shanks again in the spring!

This recipe is delicious!  So good, we had to make it again this week.  We're lucky to have found a butcher that sells lamb shanks at a great price.  Can't decide which I like more - with or without the leaks.  Either way - we recommend!

I used a slow cooker- came out wonderfully, put the leeks in at the end after sauteeing them with garlic. The key is picking the right cut of meat- the calf and the thigh.

I'm sorry to say that this one fell a little short for my husband and me.  I expected there to be so much more flavor than there was.  Yes, the meat was very tender, but I would have liked a little bit of acidity for more depth of flavor, such as balsamic vinegar.  If I try this one again, I will have to tweek it a bit.

Very very good. My whole family really liked this. Next time I will use less oil to brown the shanks. I used 3 sprigs of thyme and 3 of rosmarin, but too my shanks were very big. Used many shallot onions in stead of usual onion, came out fine.

I should have read all the reviews instead of relying on the star rating.  I agree with one of the other reviewers, it should definitely be degreased and all the mushy veg discarded. I had one shank over which I degreased and also slightly thicken the sauce . Much better but still not as flavourful as it should have been.

I've made this several times over the years now. The only thing I do a bit different (tweaked over time) is add a small can of tomato paste and up the salt. Otherwise, all the same. We love it. I serve with mint sauce...

Made this dish for family and a few friends; it was a huge hit! Got compliments from our guests, my husband and our pickiest daughter. Used white wine and beef broth (what I had on hand), would love to try it w/red wine next. I sautéed the veggies first, then braised the shanks in the same heavy skillet and then put them into baking dishes, layered the veggies on top, covered tightly w/foil, baked in 350-degree oven for 1.5 hrs. This is a  keeper! Thank you for a wonderful recipe.  Deeeelish!

We recently have become fans of lamb chops and decided to try lamb shanks.  This recipe got our attention with the red wine as an ingredient.  I used my cast-iron Dutch oven and this came out perfect!  I have lots of thyme in my herb garden so I actually added a bit more than called for.  We had mashed potatoes and poured some of the sauce over them for a yummy side!  Corn-on-the-cob completed this fantastic meal.  This was easy to make and tasted like I worked for hours on it.

This was delicious. I didn't have any leeks on hand so left that part out. I would have liked the broth to be a bit stronger so next time I might reduce it a bit at the end or use more wine and less chicken broth. Wonderful just as it is though.

Didn't have leeks and used a cast iron Dutch Oven. But other than that, followed the recipe. Delish!  Only used two shanks and cut the recipe to three people. Still enough leftovers for tonight.  Served over coconut rice from this site. Will be making this again.  Thank you

My answer to the grease problem is to make the casserole the day before and put it into the fridge once it has cooled. The fat solidifies and is easy to remove the following day before reheating and serving.
This is a family favorite and easy to make. I don't bother to flour the shanks but simply brown them.

Delicious, made it in a dutch oven pot. I rubbed shanks with seasoning before browning. I will not rub next time it burned, so I removed all burnt seasonings which also removed grease. That was good because I think that decreased the amount of greasiness others were saying. I used balsamic vinegar & ketchup (3 shakes), a leak (frozen and cut up) and sweet wine about 2 splashes, but did not use bay leaf or peppercorns.

I love this recipe. I did substitute Beef Shanks and beef broth.This makes the whole house smell wonderful too. I made creamy polenta with some garlic, parsley, and some fresh grated parmesan.  I have made it with the Lamb and it was delicious but the last time we bought the shanks they were bad...(horrible rotten meat smell when opened)...soooo bad that none of us want to eat lamb anymore. I used a tea ball for the fresh rosemary, thyme and bay leaf this time so that I didn't have to find later.

I made these today. Lick the plate good! We only had 2 shanks, so I'm thinking maybe cook time should have been a little bit shorter. Very good, tasty. I solved the grease problem by cleaning up the shanks before the flour step.

Really good served over mashed potatoes. I used a large Dutch oven with the lid on, and 1.5 hrs was plenty for 300 degrees and the 4 shanks I had. The sauce was great over the potatoes too, so I imagine if it's oily, it may depend on the oil content of your shanks. I did use about 1/3 cup of oil to brown them in instead of the half cup, just because I'm sensitive about too much oil. A good recipe that I will likely use again. The kids ate it up and asked for seconds!

I will definitely make this again! The only changes I made were replacing the springs of rosemary and thyme with 1 teaspoon of dried rosemary and thyme. I also cooked the entire dish in an electric skillet. It worked wonderfully.

I really like this recipe and have made it several times. I use the leftover juices as soup base for lamb stew (strain, degrease, and freeze) My only problem is consistently finding lamb shanks in my area.  I buy a whole lamb every year and it only comes with four.  (too bad they're not more like centipedes--creepy but delicious)   ;)

This was only ok. I found the gravy bitter. I added a little sugar which helped, but I probably won't make again.
