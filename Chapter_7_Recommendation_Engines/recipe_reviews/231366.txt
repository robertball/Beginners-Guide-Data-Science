Fast and very flavorful! I used what I had in my kitchen so I am not taking points off for the failure of what I substituted. However, please note that shredded Parm does not work as well as grated Parm in this recipe, also, Panko bread crumbs did not work as well either. The crust became mushy, but the cheese became crunchy. The flavors were spot on!!! It was very good! I can't wait to restock my pantry so I can make this again with the recommended ingredients.

Easy, quick and everything was on hand.  I did add a bit more parmesan cheese.  The chicken breasts I used where on the large size so I did add to the baking time.  Thanks mxDOc!

This was about substitution (things I had) I used French bread, Italian seasoning for the basil and oregano, sprayed them with olive oil and as they were partially frozen cooked them for an hour.  Moist and juicy. It was still a hit - even my no-meat-of-any-kind daughter liked it!  Will definitely make again!

Nice!  I did use homemade breadcrumbs from my freezer.  I do think the breading mix needs a touch of salt.  Will make again!!

Great flavor and just enough crunch.  Easy dinner that my family loved.  Used Romano because I didn't have Parmesan.

This was delicious!  I used bread crumbs instead of bread slices, but did everything else according to the recipe.  I am making it again for company tonight!

Moist inside, beautifully crispy outside. This was very flavorful; the only thing I'd add is maybe a 1/2 teaspoon salt in the breading mix. Speaking of which, I used crumbs rather than making my own; my guess for next time is it should be about 1/2 cup bread crumbs. I still had a lot of the mix left over, so I used it to coat the chicken after drizzling the oil (I used peanut oil for a change and it worked great).  Final test: the kids. They loved it!!

May just be my oven, but first batch didn't get crispy. Second batch was at 375 instead and much better--crispy, but not dried out.

The best tasting breading for oven baked chicken that I've tried, and very quick and easy.   The only thing I did differently was to use bread crumbs instead of the sliced bread.  A half cup for a single recipe seemed to be just right.  Thank you for this delicious chicken recipe.

I used whole wheat bread for the crumbs, and it was delicious! The only thing I changed was adding about 1/2 tsp. of salt to the breaded mixture. It might still taste fine without that; this is the first time I've made it. I served it with fettuccine noodles and a cream sauce -- delicious!  I will definitely be making it again!

Not bad, not great, just another chicken recipe. It was definitely missing something for me. Maybe a little heat or even a bit of salt in the coating.

This is a very tasty dish. In lieu of fresh bread, used Italian bread crumbs, 1/2 cup. Used basil olive oil in place of vegetable oil.  DH loved it

Good. My son recommended cutting the chicken breasts into strips next time to get a higher crust to meat ratio

I had garlic/oregano croutons from homemade garlic/oregano bread that I processed into the crumbs, lightly salted the meat (since I used only 1/4 cup of the parm which is salty itself), and 1 teaspoon of oregano and 1/2 teaspoon of granulated garlic (again, since I used the garlic/oregano croutons).
They came out nice and brown and crispy. I even saved a breast for use in a penne with basil marinara that I found on here to try...I will let you know how that turns out....

I wanted to make chicken strips and could not find many options and I lost my old recipe. I used this recipe using gluten free bread 6 slices (would be better if dried a bit.). I rolled the strips in GF flour, egg and then the bread mis. Topeed each strip with a dollop of butter. Baked for 28 minutes at 450 degrees, turning half way.

This was pretty good, but not fantastic.  Haven't decided if I'll make it again.  There are so many good chicken recipes here.

Used progreso bread crumbs mixed with Parmesean cheese and cheese on top. It never became crispy, in face I over cooked the chicken because it did not look done.

This was really very good.  I used chicken tenders since I had them already.  Last few minutes, set on broil to get really crispy!  I also added a bit of salt. Since someone mentioned the shredded Parm did not do as well, I chopped mine up and I agree, the smaller pieces probably worked better on the batter portion but shredded would do nicely on top.

Made this as instructed. Mediocre, chicken was a bit dry.
