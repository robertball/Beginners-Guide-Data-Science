I'm the recipe submitter & wanted to clarify a few things so people are not disappointed. First, you cannot skip the freezing the cookie dough step...if you do, the dough WILL bake along w/the cake and be very dry.  It's also imperative you don't overbake (or you'll get the same dry baked cookie results); I actually usually only bake about 16-18 min.  I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH, DO NOT OVER BAKE!  It will seem like it's too early to take them out, but it's not.  Check the outer ridge of the cupcake (otherwise you're getting the dough on your toothpick which should stay *wet*).  These are great w/pretty much any cake flavor and can be made even easier by using prepared cookie dough (just don't skip the freezing step!).  When I try a new chocolate chip cookie dough recipe (or even bake old favs), I always double it and freeze some cookie dough balls for future batches of these!  I HAVE tried this as a cake, but have yet to perfect the cookie dough ball size/bake time...when I get it *right*, I'll add the dimensions/bake time to my review.  THANKS, everyone, for trying (and rating and posting pics of!) my recipe!  Enjoy!

I don't know what more I could add to nearly 100 other glowing reviews. So let me preface this by saying that on the rare occasions Hubs REALLY likes something he'll say it's so good he could eat it till he got sick. Having said that, I made and froze the cookie dough the day before, exactly as the recipe directs. The next day it was a breeze to get these in the oven and if you follow LTH's tips, these come out exactly as she says they will. I used a chocolate cake batter, a vanilla buttercream, and garnished with a mini chocolate chip cookie.  Too cute. And the inside? A delightful, gooey, chocolate chip cookie dough surprise that Hubs' staff all loved.  As for Hubs? I do believe he "made himself sick." Thanks for sharing your wonderful and creative cupcakes LTH!

What a good idea- to put a cookie in a cupcake!!!  I HAD to try this.  But I used a chocolate fudge cake mix cuz I didn't have yellow mix on hand.  And personally, I liked the contrast in color between the chocolate cupcake and the cookie dough inside.  The only thing I would have to say about this is...next time I would use mini chocolate chips in the cookie dough.  I bet you could also use those prepared "break & bake" cookies that they sell in the grocery store to save some time & effort.  These came out yummmmmy!  I dunked my cupcakes in chocolate ganache (1 cup choc chips & 1/2 cup heavy cream in a double boiler)...as if there wasn't enough choc in this recipe.   Chocolate chip cookies in a cupcake covered with MORE chocolate- who could ask for anything more in a dessert?

Nobody I know likes vanilla cupcakes so I used devils food mix instead. I used premade cookie dough to save on time and cleanup and it worked great! Huge hit, loved by all, gobbled up immediately, and the kids (and adults) all had fun trying to guess what the surprise inside was. I will definitely make again!

These were ok. Mine turned out a little dry and crumbley in the middle. They were good, but as my husband said "Good, but not worth the extra work". I made them with my 3 year old daughter and we had fun doing it. EDIT: Afer reading LTH reveiw I made them again. The first time I put them in the freezer but not long enough for them to freeze. This time I froze those little suckers rock hard and baked for no longer then 18 minutes. Let me tell you: A little extra work but SO worth it! Thank you for the reveiw LTH!!!

I am not sure if I did something wrong but I followed the directions to a tee and I was not impressed.  The cupcakes were dry and I guess I hoped the cookie dough would stay more "doughish" but you could hardly tell it was cookie dough.  It was more like a cupcake with some choc chips in the middle.  Maybe I need to try them again but I was very disappointed this time around.

WOW! Cupcakes and cookie dough - what a great combination!  I brought these to a children's birthday party and amongst the ooh's and aah's and everyone asking "Who made these?", I couldn't help but smile.  These are so easy to make, but I can't emphasize enough how important it is to follow the instuctions especially when it comes to freezing the cookie dough.  These are awesome and I can't wait to try different cupcake and cookie dough combinations. The possibilites are endless! Thanks LTH for another great recipe!

Fabulous recipe, great combination. I made some buttercream for the top. I prefer to eat these when they are cool or cold. My picky husband loves them and I took them to a barbeque and everyone loved them there too! These are truly delicious! I am not sure why the previous person who rated this gave a bad review, it doesn't deserve it. ;)

These were great :)  The changes I made were minimial. (Quantities listed are for 12 servings) I used 5/8 cup EACH (translated 1/2 cup + 1/8 cup) sugar & brown sugar. Instead of adding a raw egg... I used 2 Tbsp milk (2 Tbsp milk = 1 egg) and then increased the flour to 1 3/4 cup (yes I know, again this was not for 24 cupcakes, but 12).  Mix all ingredients together - Using a 1.5 tbsp scoop, shape the dough into balls  freeze overnight.   I chose not to use a boxed cake mix...ugh!  Instead I used a cake recipe that made these POP! 3/4 cup softened butter 3/4 cup packed light brown sugar, 2 eggs 1 1/3 cups all purpose flour 1/2 tsp EACH baking powder & baking soda 1/4 tsp. salt 1/2 cup milk 1 tsp. vanilla extract  Cream butter & brown sugar, Add eggs, sift dry ingredients, alternate adding dry ingredients w/ milk, begin and end w/ flour mixture, stir in vanilla Fill cupcake liners w/ 3 Tbsp batter, press the frozen cookie dough into the batter. bake at 350° 16-18 minutes  This will be MUCH better than the boxed mix.. Frosting..oh yes!  1 1/2 cups softened butter 1/2 cup + 2 Tbsp light brown sugar, packed 1 3/4 cups powdered sugar 1/4 tsp. salt 1 Tbsp. milk 1 tsp. vanilla extract  Cream ingredients together, pipe onto cooled cupcakes, sprinkle w/ more choc chips :D  That's the 5 star cupcake!!!

I love to bake cupcakes and am always looking for a new recipe but this one turned out dry and you couldn't even tell there was cookie in it.  Not a hit in my book.

I followed the recipe exactly, including following Lovestohost's hints about freezing the cookie dough thoroughly and being very careful not to overbake. I topped them with a whipped chocolate buttercream. The result was a cupcake with a center of unbaked cookie dough, which I assume is the intent. I didn't love it, but I'm not going to rate it low because I think it's a matter of taste not the recipe failing. If you are a "cookie dough" sort of person you'll probably enjoy this. I didn't get a positive review from my husband and I thought they were just ok too. I'll take the rest to the office and they'll probably vanish in seconds though!

This recipe is awesome!  I have made them numerous times for my students and family since LTH first posted a picture of these cupcakes!  I always top with the chocolate buttercream frosting from the Nestle website, and sometimes I even cheat and use pre-made cookie dough.  YUMMY every time!  Kids LOVE these!  :) Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I can't imagine how these could be rated any less than 5 stars! This recipe is everything you could want in a dessert: it's easy, quick, and delicious with an unexpected twist. They were amazing straight from the oven. The texture of the cookie dough and cake blended so nicely. I wasn't sure if the dough balls were supposed to sit on the surface or be pressed down into the batter. I did a batch of each and the results were identical. Looking forward to making these again! The cookie/cake possibilities are almost endless! UPDATE: I've made these twice since and I've come to realize the results are so inconsistent. The 2nd time around the cookie dough cooked entirely so I had to toss the cupcakes. The 3rd time the cookie dough remained on the surface. With that said, it is imperative that you fill the cupcake liners no more than 1/2-2/3 full and to make sure the cookie dough is no smaller than 1 tablespoon. If they're smaller, they'll begin to bake, resulting in a disappointment. It will seem like more batter is necessary, but I promise it's sufficient!

I haven't read the other revies so I don't  know if this has been mentioned, but you can use pasteurized egg substitute instead of regular eggs in the cookie dough so you aren't in danger of salmonella from the raw eggs.

For the cookie dough inner, don't need the egg.  Prob safer to not add it since the cookies dont actually cook.  I must say though, that I have moved around a lot, including a lot of Asia, and it was ingrained in me to not eat uncooked eggs.  Of course, the US is probably ok, but just to let you know, we now leave out egg and just make cookie dough to eat sometimes instead of actually baking and it's great.

My husband turned thirty yesterday so I made these to celebrate. Seemed perfect, as he LOVES cupcakes and cookie dough. I did use a chocolate fudge cake mix, used cold coffee in the cake making instead of water and frosted with a mocha frosting(also from this site)that my husband had loved in the past. I admit this did take some time but when my husband ate one....and the look he gave me? Totally worth it. You made me look like the best wife ever, LTH. I'm so thankful. And this recipe? It's a keeper. I'd like to see what might happen if I added instant coffee granules to the cookies next time. NOTE: I'm thinking about trying this recipe this weekend with a peanut butter cake and frozen peanut butter cookie dough balls and a chocolate ganache. I'll update my review when I've had a chance to put it into action.

These were a big hit with the kids. When I placed the frozen cookie dough on top of the batter the result was cookie dough oozing out the top. When I filled the cupcake 1/2 full, put the cookie dough in, then covered the dough with more batter, the result was a "closed" cupcake and the cookie dough was hidden.

This is a rarity for me, as I'm rating something a 5 even tough I didn't follow this exact recipe.  I did, however, follow what the submitter has said she has done, and used cookie dough I froze from Felix's recipe. :)  Other than that, and using slightly less cookie dough per cupcake and butter instead of oil in the cake(preference, only, and per box directions :) , I made them as written.  I froze the dough as directed, baked them as directed, and had no problems with dryness.  I frosted some with a semi sweet chocolate frosting, and some with a cooked caramel one from another site, and I topped them with mini chips.  This made some of the cupcakes look a lot like chocolate chip cookies. :)   Anyway, I made several dozen of these, for my nephews' summer party, tomorrow, and I know they will be well received!  Great concept, LTH! :)

I have the cookie mix for the next batch in the freezer as I type.  I made these during this past week, and I’m ready for the next batch!  I used a German chocolate cake mix, strictly for the color contrast, and they came out very good.  Even the little rugrats, who don’t care for sweets, asked for seconds.  The only problem that I had was a dimple on the top, which I hid with frosting.  But,  when I made the cookies, I left the bottoms flat, and this time I made them more round.  I’ll see if that will help take care of the dimple.  This will also be one of my often repeated recipes!

Good but not great.  I like the concept but it is not the best cupcake ever.  Concept is good.  I might try with a frozen brownie in a chocolate cupcake  for some chocolate indulgence thing.  But do not feel the need to make this again.

Very good. Be aware that you need to start these several hours before you need them, since you will have to freeze the cookie dough for a couple of hours in order for them to become firm. I put the frozen dough balls onto the batter at the very last minute, and by baking 16 minutes exactly, the dough stayed properly "doughy" (unbaked) in the finished product. That, however, was the problem for us. Between the lightly baked cake part, the soft cookie dough and the mound of frosting needed to cover up the crater left in the middle from the sinking dough ball, this was just a bit over-the-top gooey for our tastes. No doubt many people will love it for exactly this reason, but it was just a bit much for us. We'd rather have a plain, frosted cupcake and keep the dough in the freezer to add to impromptu sundaes. BTW, because of wanting to avoid consumption of raw eggs, I used the frozen cookie dough recipe on this website, because it does not call for eggs. This is strongly advised if you intend to serve the cupcakes or dough to young children and babies, the elderly, pregnant women, or anyone with a compromised immune system.

I used store bought pre-cut cookie dough. So much easier & faster than making the cookie dough, plus they're already fairly hard from being refrigerated. I used a generic store brand yellow cake mix and used Creamy Chocolate Frosting (Tracy Larsen)from this site. The recipe made 24 cupcakes. I had extra of the frosting. Both recipes were outstanding. Out of 24 cupcakes, there are 4 left and I just made them 5 hrs ago! They were supposed to be for Mother's Day BBQ tomorrow. I guess I'll be baking on Mother's Day.

I made this for the 4th of July reunion my husbands family has every year.I had people begging for the recipe and my sister in law thought I was trying to sabotage her diet. I doubled the recipe and ended up with 50 cupcakes for 56 people and there were none left and there were many many other desserts there. It was great to look around and see the first person bite into it and say "there's cookie dough in there" and then see the rush of people (seriously) who wanted to try them out. Awesome recipe.

I was not impressed.  The cupcakes were on the dry side.  Recommendations for others:  make the cookie dough balls big - big walnut sized - because otherwise you can't even tell the cookie dough is inside.  Also, use mini chocolate chips, as opposed to normal sized, just so you get more chips per cupcake.  Won't make again.

Amazing!  I think it is important to following the submitter's review and only bake about 16 minutes.  I baked mine about 17 and it was delicous but I would have preferred it to be less done.  I am concerned about the eggs in the dough, so I might try to find an eggless dough for the middles from now on, but genius idea on these cupcakes!

My kids and friends loved these.  I don't like cookie dough, so I thought a smaller amount of dough in the cake would be better.  Plus, it seemed there was enough cookie dough to roll more than 24 cookie dough balls, so I did.  They were smaller, and I learned...Do NOT do that!!  Take what dough you have and roll them into generous sized cookie dough balls.  The dough in the middle is awesome, not gooey, just makes the cupcake super-moist.  DO be sure to completely freeze them.
I also used a chocolate cake mix - yum! and whipped up caramel frosting to pipe on top.  (Recipe is on this site - 'Caramel Frosting V'.) The combination of flavors was rich and made it easy to stop eating at just one cupcake.

OH MY!! A sweet little treasure inside these cupcakes makes me smile! I love cookies. I mean really, they're possibly the best thing ever..and to combine them w/ a cupcake. True genius! Way to go LTH! I got 25 cookie dough balls and only made 23 cuppies. I was a bit more generous w/ my batter. ;) A keeper for sure. Want to impress the school kids or your family? These are the ones!

Here's a BIG tip if you're NOT using a cake mix: follow whatever baking temperature that goes with the cake. I used the Better Homes & Gardens yellow cake recipe, and at first, I baked the cupcakes at 350 degrees, like this recipe stipulates. They came out underdone. When I baked them at 375 (as the BH&G recipe said) for 18 minutes, they came out PERFECT. Delicious, fluffy, gooey, perfect.
This recipe is A LOT of work, since I also made my own cookie dough, but it's worth it.
Great idea, great recipe---thanks!!

These were SO SO GOOD! I made my favorite chocolate cake recipe and those take about 20 minutes to bake. I was worried about overcooking the cookie balls, so I left them in the freezer and popped the cupcakes in the oven for 4 minutes. Took out one tray at a time and my daughter dropped a cookie ball in each and then I put them back in the oven. Not sure if this made much of a different, but they were AWESOME. Seriously. I piped on whipped cream cheese frosting (recipe from this site). Amazing. Everyone loved them.

Yummy - made it with chocolate fudge cake mix and premade cookie dough as I was short on time. The dough was about  1 inch round- any less and I don't think they would have been as good - next time though, will take it out at 18 min. like previously stated. Will definitely make again and again

I made a batch for the Sunday school kids and my son said they all enjoyed it very much.  I enjoyed it as well, what a great idea!  I actually used the Toll House pre made dough, no worries about raw eggs that way.  Yummy!

UPDATE: I'VE BEEN CRAVING CUPCAKES LATELY BUT MY HUSBAND REQUESTED THAT I BAKE CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES. I BALKED AT THE THOUGHT OF MAKING THESE AGAIN, BUT BEING THE UNDEFEATED PISTOL I AM, I FORGED AHEAD. I AM SOOOO GLAD I DID! THIS TIME, I BAKED MY CUPCAKES FOR 19 MINUTES. PERFECT! MY ONLY CRITICISM IS THAT OF MY 24 CUPCAKES, 12 OF THEM WERE HOLLOW IN THE CENTER (THE COOKIE DOUGH SUNK). THE KEY IS TO LIE YOUR DOUGH ON TOP OF YOUR BATTER (DO NOT SUBMERGE IT). TRY THESE. YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!! I I'm not sure how I went wrong with these.... Sadly, my second batch failed just as miserably (well, maybe not AS bad...) as my first one. :( I have NO idea what I did wrong. I read the most helpful reviews on here, including LTH's review. Not only did I bake my cupcakes for 16-18 minutes (more like 17), I also allowed them to cool for AT LEAST 10 minutes as directed. My first trial run produced soggy (i.e. RAW cake batter) cupcakes. My second batch produced firmer, slightly golden cupcakes with completely baked edges (when compared to my first batch), but even after cooling for 20 MINUTES, they still caved on the sides when handled. My only change was to roll refrigerated pre-baked cookie dough (to form a 1 T-sized balls) / freeze instead of making my own dough. Such a shame. This recipe has SO much appeal (and I LOVE cookie dough AND cupcakes!). Sorry, LTH, I don't think I'll be attempting a THIRD try, but if you want to send me a batch you made, I'd be happy to oblige! :-)

Why, why, why must you post such a delicious recipe!!!! Amazingly perfect.  Used 30oz pillsbury cookie dough-this made 27 generous sized balls. Froze them while I ran my errands. Used devils food w/pudding cake mix. Do not overcook. If anything, I undercooked them-15-18 minutes. Let them cool for 5min in pan then laid them upside down on separate plate so that they won't concave in the middle. They were sinfully delicious!

I wasn't sure what to expect with these cupcakes.  I thought I would either end up with a cookie texture or a dough texture in the middle, but the cookie really ended up the same texture as the cake. You could tell it was there, but not in the form that I was hoping for.  Followed the directions exactly, used a medium cookie scoop and froze the cookie balls throughouly before putting on top of cake batter.  Used Hershey chocolate frosting on top.  Still went over well with everyone so not a complete loss.

I have made this multiple times now and have taken it to school multiple times as well. All my friends and everyone else who I have given one this delicious cupcakes to all agree that they are seriously fantastic. The only thing I changed was I used less vanilla extract and left out the baking soda and eggs. I left out the baking soda because baking soda is only needed when actually cooking the cookie dough and I left out the eggs because eating raw eggs is not recommended. Since the eggs was what binded the ingredients together, I just added some water instead until it was the correct consistency.

These were really good and my family loved them. I only baked them for 15 minutes. I highly recommend using regular salt instead of sea salt. The first batch I made with sea salt and every now and then I would bite into a piece of sea salt. I had a problem with eating the cookie dough batter before I could get them in the cupcakes

I had a little trouble with this recipe. It's kinda fussy. The first time, I baked them for about 18 minutes. I let them cool and they sunk in the middle. It turns out I had underbaked them. (I did manage to salvage about 6 of them that hadn't underbaked.) So I tried again, this time with a chocolate cake mix, and baked them for 20 minutes. They came out great the second time, although the cookie dough almost started to bake. Baking time is everything with this recipe. Also, I was nervous about the raw egg, especially because my little niece would be eating these. So I left out the egg and added about 3 Tbps. water to get the cookie dough to stick together. I frosted the cupcakes with "Caroline's Chocolate Fudge Frosting" from this site.

These were amazing!  I used the premade mini chocolate chip cookies and just popped the whole package in the freezer.  Very easy.  I made yellow cake mix with frosted with chocolate.  Everyone raved about them and my boyfriend doesn't really like sweets ate FOUR of them!  Thank you for a great recipe/idea.  Can't wait to experiment with different kinds of cake/frosting/cookies!!!

Wow!  This is such a great idea, and they came out perfectly!  I had no issues making them or with the end product and I cheated as much as possible with this recipe (store bought cake, frosting, and dough).  I did freeze the dough (aka, realized I forgot to buy the dough sometime around my lunch hour, purchased some, and shoved it in the employee freezer hoping it would be frozen solid by 5) and I only baked them for about 16 minutes, which is what it specified on the box anyway.  They came out moist, fluffy, and wonderful.  Granted, I was baking these in a monsoon so it would have been hard for them to come out dry, but I bet they would have been wonderful if baked in dry weather as well.  I also didn’t have any issues with these retaining their shapes.  A couple reminders to people after reading these reviews.  1.  Everyone likes things cooked differently, so bake these with your preference in mind.  2. Everyone’s oven bakes differently, so make sure you poke these from time to time so you don’t end up over baking them.  This is a great recipe.

"The best cupcake. Ever." Indeed. This recipe really doesn't need any more raving reviews, but these are so amazing that I HAD to review.  Living in the Denver area, I was afraid I might run into "high altitude" issues, but I followed the directions to a "T" and they came out PERFECT at 17 minutes, no sinking, yummily-perfectly moist and sooo good they're BAD  :o)  My biggest quandry was what frosting to use, something light and fluffy and not too sweet, and I found this AMAZING frosting recipe that complemented these perfectly:  http://www.ourbestbites.com/2010/05/chocolate-frosting/
Thank you again for sharing your deliciousness with us!    :o)

These cupcakes were a HUGE HIT! Everyone loved them! They were not as scary-tempramental as the reviews made them out to be. I froze the dough and I was golden! I also used the frosting from this recipe (http://tidymom.net/2011/cookie-dough-cupcakes-with-cookie-dough-frosting-recipe/) and topped them with a chocolate chip cookie. People thought I had bought them! Next time, I would make my own cake instead- just a taste preference.

Can you say YUM?! These are by far the cupcakes from Heaven. Cookie dough in the middle makes this treat so decadent and delicious. I only froze my dough for 30 minutes and it turned out wonderful so if you are on a time crunch you don't need to wait the two hours. Just make sure the dough is stiff so it doesn't overcook in the oven.

Great! Made them with pre-made frozen cookie dough, yellow cake mix, and cream cheese frosting. Perfectly done after 20 minutes.

Holy  these suckers are to DIE for!!!  Especially when they are warm right out of the oven...doesn't even need icing!!!!!  My family and I LOVED these.  I used yellow butter cake mix.  The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is cuz the middle of my cupcakes kept sinking in once pulled from the oven to cool (???????).  Followed the recipe to the T...just wondering where I may have went wrong??  GREAT recipe regardless...and its nothing icing can't hide!!!

These were oh so good and easy to make. I bought premade Nestle Tollhouse cookie dough and Duncan Hines Butter Cake Mix. I hardened the cookie dough in the freezer for 30 minutes and prepared the mix as directed. I filled the cupcake wells only 1/2 full, then placed cookie dough on top then filled with more batter. I baked for exactly 18 minutes and they came out great. I frosted with the creamy chocolate frosting recipe from this site. These were delicious and will definately make again.

I made my own batch of cookie dough the day before, scooped it into balls & froze it overnight.  I used Chocolate (Devil's Food) Cake Mix & Homemade Buttercream Icing (That I usually use for cakes & cupcakes).  The cookie dough was not dry, it was good...but possibly a bit overrated.  These cupcakes ARE good...but not quite as amazing as they were made out to be.  Maybe one day I will try vanilla cake mix...or even the other recipe (Using brownie Mix instead of the cookie dough).  Very good...just not AMAZING.  Thanks lovestohost, for a nice variation.  (I made the golf pull-apart cake with this recipe.  Will post photo soon)

These were not good at all.  We love sweets and find most recipes that have been rated high on allrecipes end up very good.  I took the submitter's advice and took the cupcakes out before they looked done (they were just a bit wet on top but were cooked the entire recommended time).  For all of the work it wasn't worth it to me.  Even though I froze the cookie dough it did bake inside the cupcake and became too dry.  The cupcake itself was too wet and mushy in parts and a couple even fell.  I would not make this again.

I made 2 batches of these for a work holiday party, 1 with yellow cake and 1 with chocolate.  I then piped on some canned icing and sprinkled with a few of the leftover mini chocolate chips to hint at what was inside.  To say "they were a hit" would be an understatement.  People were actually fighting over the last few.  Freezing the cookie dough and NOT overbaking are clearly the 2 main steps necessary to have these come out as intended.  And yes, you MUST like cookie dough to enjoy them.  This recipe is a keeper!!!

I made these for one of my best friend's sixteenth birthday, I only used the filling, which was excellent, and "too much chocolate cake" for the actual cup cake. This was such a fun and different recipe! The extra dough was baked into individual cookies and stuffed with, also extra, icing! Yum!

These are great but, make sure you leave them in the muffin pan to cool, if you want them 'gooey' in the middle. I tried to make two batches for a party, and tried to take the first batch out of the pans, so I could put the 2nd batch in the oven - oh what a mess I had! But, the ones left in the pan to cool were wonderful and gooey in the middle.

These are fantastic! I took the basic concept and followed the Toll House recipe for the cookie dough (used egg substitute instead of eggs for safety - no egg at all would have made the dough too crumbly and dry), and I followed the yellow cake mix instructions. I covered the bottom of the cupcake tins with cake batter, dropped in a ball of frozen dough, and just barely covered with more batter. They are delicious - thanks for the recipe, LTH! I'm looking forward to trying the brownie batter version soon.

This is a good cupcake.  But, it is seriously not the BEST cupcake ever.  Honestly, it wouldn't make a difference to me if it had cookie dough inside or not.  If I didn't have a good homemade chocolate buttercream to go with it, they would be just sub-par.  I followed the directions exactly, and even froze the cookie dough balls overnight, instead of only the 2 hours it recommended.  It was really neat how the cookie dough ball sinks into the cupcake as it bakes, but the consistency of the cookie dough doesn't stay purely dough-y.  It does "bake" in the tiniest bit, even with cookie dough frozen overnight.  I probably won't make these again, but I will try the brownie batter kind (i.e. "2nd best cupcake ever") and see if perhaps that one lives up to its title!  :)

My wife found this recipe after we were informed our son wanted a "Cookie Dough Tasting" cake for his birthday (turned 8), and I read all a lot of the notes about preparation.  
I followed recommendations for no egg in cookie dough.  Then used the recipe as a guideline to create a 3-layer round birthday cake.  
The flavor was AWESOME, and texture was perfect.  The dough was exactly how we wanted it, like in the ice cream flavor!
After baking I covered it with Semisweet Chocolate Ganache.

Pretty delicious! I made them at my mom's for dessert tonight, and even a couple picky teenagers ate them! I was planning on changing some stuff, using my own chocolate chip cookie recipe and a yellow cake batter from scratch, but I ended up not having the time, so preparing these as is worked just fine! I baked them for 16 minutes from the poster's recommendations, and they were absolutely perfect. Gooey chocolate chip cookie dough inside, delicious cupcake outside. I did press down the dough balls a bit, and dolloped some batter right on top of each ball. When done, they looked just like the picture, I was impressed! Thanks!

This was HEAVENLY! Rave reviews by all, including, "best cupcake I've ever had!" You must freeze the dough, and then refrigerate the cupcakes after. Made the chocolate ganache sauce as recommended by another viewer (1 C choc chips to 1/2 cup whipping cream, melted in a double boiler). Will definitely keep

This is a really decadent, sugar-bomb type dessert, especially if you use homemade buttercream like I did.  I cheated and used frozen packaged dough.  One thing to note - I did not over-fill the cups.  That's important, otherwise you'll get sunken, middles and undercooked cake.  Fill the cups about halfway.

These are fantastic!  I cheated and bought chocolate chip cookie dough.  I only needed to freeze them for 20 minutes, which was long enough for me to make the cupcake batter.  Next time, I will use a different flavor cake mix.  Thank you for sharing!

I was exited to try these-but mine didn't turn out. They looked fine on the outside, but when we ate them, where I expected a ball of cookie dough, I had air pockets in my cupcakes. I used Pilsbury cookie dough and froze the balls overnight.  That was the only change I made from the original recipe.  I even baked the second batch 5 minutes longer and left in the pan for 15 minutes--same result.  They taste great  but the results weren't worth the extra step and to me aren't worth a second try.  Thanks though. :(

Wow! These were so delicious!  I baked only for 15-16 minutes and froze the cookie dough over night.  Used a chocolate cake mix and prepared vanilla cream cheese frosting.  Next time I will play around with the flavors and will hopefully make time to whip up homemade icing.

Just made these yesterday and they are wonderful! Everyone that's had them agrees, even if they're not a huge cookie dough fan (such as myself). You definitely have to be super careful not to over bake, and I let the balls of cookie dough sit in the freezer for almost 24 hours, until they were rock hard (Nestle pre-packaged... I'll admit I took the easy way out). I only baked mine for 15 minutes, so definitely pay attention because your oven may vary slightly from the recommended time. As long as the dough is frozen solid, the result should be a moist cupcake with gooey cookie dough in the middle... what could be better?! And with using a cake mix, prepared cookie dough, and a jar of frosting, it's SUPER easy to make and seems like it took way more time than it did! Thanks for the excellent recipe!!

I picked 5 recipes from this site to bake for a fund raiser at work and to be honest this did not live up to the reviews.  The Peanut Butter Cupcake from this site was by far the biggest hit and this was the biggest dud and only a few sold. Even my kids who love anything cookie dough were not impressed.  They came out exactly like they should but just did not get the WOW factor expected.  Good idea but just ok.

The "Cake Doctor" has a similar, easier recipe in her cookbook with frozen cookie dough.  Times are less and cupcakes moister with Chocolate Buttercream frosting.  Best cupcakes I ever tasted.

Everyone loved these!!! They all kept coming back for  more. Although they weren't gone in a day, that's just bc they are very heavy with both cookie dough and cake. The cookie dough alone is amazing!! I could not stop eating it before putting it in the freezer! I'll most definitely be making these again.

I think that if you don't rate theses with 5 stars then you did something wrong with the preparing or baking! They are a sweets lovers dream come true...I went the lazy route and did store bought cookie dough...I bought 2 packs of the 12 large cookies and froze them and they were awesome. I also used chocolate cake mix and vanilla frosting. I think putting them in the refrigerator once they have cooled a little is the way to go. That way the cookie dough sets up again....18 minutes....FABULOUS!!

I made these last night for a meeting I am attending tonight.  I was going to wait until my friends and family sampled before rating, but I can't wait another 8 hours!  These are amazing!  I only made one substitution-- I was concerned about the egg not being fully cooked since the cookie dough is frozen, so I used 3T sweetened condensed milk instead.  The result looks identical to all the pictures.  I also didn't frost mine-- but only because I couldn't decide which frosting to use.  They are good plain though!

Seriously, how could these not be delicious? Cookie dough in a cupcake, all it needs is bacon to be the perfect dish. Definitely not your last minute recipe but great for parties. I got a kick out of watching people think they were eating an ordinary cupcake then WHAM, cookie dough.

Absolutely fantastic! I used premade cookie dough, rolledt into 24 balls, then froze for about 5hrs. I used a dark chocolate cake mix, water, applesauce and eggs. I put a heaping tablespoon into foil muffin liners, added the cookie dough ball, then topped with remaining cake batter. Baked for 15 min. and topped with the Jello pudding frosting from this site (not too sweet). They turned out perfectly!

Well, if you are a chocolate chip cookie dough freak like me...THIS RECIPE IS FOR YOU!!!  Absolutely awesome!!  Follow other suggestions and be sure to FREEZE the cookie dough before making the cupcakes. AND only bake for 16 minutes.  I iced with the buttercream frosting II from this site.  Took to work and all went crazy!!!  This deserves a 10.  Such a GREAT spin on cupcakes!!!!!!

Excellent idea! I've frozen cookie dough for years. It's nice to have on hand. Need a cookie. Go to the freezer, preheat oven and in 15 minutes you have cookies. So this recipe is perfect for my cookies. You can use any cookie recipe (frozen) with any flavor cake. The sky is the limit on the difference variations you can come up with.

Excellent!  I used a yellow cake mix and a pacakage of premade cookie dough.  Worked great!  The cake was just right and the cookie dough was warm a gooey!  I topped them with some whipped chocolate frosting.  YUM!!

This seems to be the hottest recipe lately so I was really excited to try it. I froze my cookie dough balls until they were rock solid, but they still baked completely inside the cupcake and you could hardly tell that there was cookie dough in there. The idea itself is really good so I didn't feel like giving it a low rating, but it seems like a lot of people are having this problem. I was expecting the cookie dough to be doughy/chewy inside. Anyway, I used devils food cake mix and cream cheese frosting. I thought this was a good combo with the cookie. Any other tips on how to prevent the cookie from baking??

These were awesome! My husband absolutely looovves them! The only thing I changed was the actual cupcake. I used Hershey's recipe for the "Perfect chocolate cake" on the bake of the baking cocoa box, because that's my favorite chocolate cake recipe and it's homemade instead of from a box:) I'm makin' my husband take them to work tomorrow to share with his soldiers so I don't pig out on them! Also, my cookie dough insides were perfect and stayed the way they should. I had them in the freezer for about 4 hours so no problem there ^_^ I highly reccomend trying this recipe again if it failed you the frist time!

I cheated and used the already made cookie dough (tollhouse cookies) and the children absolutely LOVED them...I am glad that I made extras because several of the children asked for seconds.  I will be making these again for my son's 7th birthday party

These cupcakes are great - BUT, not being a fan of eatting anything with RAW EGGS, I substituted 2 tablespoons of milk in place of the egg for the cookie dough and they turned out perfect!

These are hands down, some of the best cupcakes you will ever have. That being said I have made my own version. As others have mentioned using a chocolate cake is best and a chocolate homemade frosting.

Oh my word! I found this recipe this morning, and made the cookies this afternoon!! (Even had to make a run to the store for the chocolate chips!!) - I did make one adjustment to the cookie dough portion: rather than using an egg (which would make it inadvisable for pregnant/nursing women and children to eat these delicious treats), I used 1 tablespoon of corn starch mixed with 2 tablespoons of water. 

They turned out FANTASTIC!! They weren't very pretty because my dough balls were too big for the cupcakes and the tops spilled over, but I can make them a little smaller next time!! I'm trying an 8x8 cake with 12 small balls of dough right now! Hoping it will turn out just as well!!

I'm hoping that I just had something terribly wrong happen because wow. This did not turn out a 5 star cupcake in my kitchen.  I followed the directions, including the hints in the first review.  My cupcakes looked fine when I took them out of the oven, but when I put them on the rack to cool (ten minutes later) the centers collapsed.  Some of them never made it to the cooling rack - they were too crumbly.  I baked them for 17 minutes, testing them a few times along the way since overbaking seems to be a problem.  I will try them again, with a different mix, and also with better cookie dough.  (I baked the leftover cookie dough while the cupcakes cooled and they made a very VERY dry, floury cookie.)

These are phenomenal and I have made them probably a dozen times! It is of the utmost importance to freeze the dough balls at least overnight or it will bake along with the cake. I get nothing but compliments and requests for 'making them for an occasion' every time.

I tried this recipe out and it wasn't too bad. It was moist and it tasted good. But, I can't say it was the best. My husband and I liked it but we didn't love it. We didn't want to use frosting but it wasn't pretty without it. Did anyone else get a sunken top in the middle?

Seemed like an absolutely fabulous idea, but I tried it multiple times without success.  Maybe it's the altitude here, but I will not try these again.

This was a great recipe.  The extra brown sugar and vanilla from a typical cookie recipe gave it a great flavor that wasn't over powered by the cake. It's also dry enough it's not too gooey.  A great balance. Thank you!  
For those having trouble with the cookie dough...you MUST freeze it long enough that the dough doesn't bake into a cookie.  I just make the cookie dough a day ahead of time to be safe.  Also, if it's too much dough for your liking, make smaller balls. The table spoon size balls will almost take up the entire inside of your cup cake. (I personally liked it that way)
variations for high altitude: use baking powder instead of soda, add 1/4 c flour and about 1/8 c water to cake mix.  I also like to use melted butter instead of oil (really if you are going to eat something with this much sugar, you may as well make it taste as good as possible)

These are dangerously good. My husband loves cookie dough so I made these for his birthday. He loved them. One note to make: I used a dark chocolate fudge cake mix and I think that the cake flavor over took some of the cookie dough taste. Next time I will use a more mild/bland cake mix.

Wonderful taste and perfect cookie dough texture in the center. You wont be disapointed if you follow the instructions.  I used 1/2 cup instead of 1 cup of mini chips and froze the dough for at least 5 hours.  Don't take the dough out of the freezer until you are ready to set them on top of the cupcakes.  Over baking is the easiest way to ruin these.  I baked for 16 minutes and checked for doneness.  I quickly removed the ones that were done (as in: sprang back when pushed)  and let the others finish for another 1 minute or so.  I removed them from the pan and cooled on a wire rack right away.  Then straight to the fridge they went.  After frosting be sure to put them back in the fridge because of the raw egg factor.

I made these for a birthday treat for my son's school and they were a big hit!  We used chocolate cake mix and I used the break apart cookie dough that I put in the freezer.  Topped with vanilla frosting and some mini chocolate chips for decoration.  I think next time I might try peanut butter cookie dough... Thanks for sharing.

I made these for my son's birthday and they were gobbled up! We used devil's food cake mix and vanilla frosting, and the visual of the cookie dough against the chocolate cake was nice. I froze the cookie dough overnight and baked the cupcakes for 16 minutes. I will definitely make these again!

I followed this exactly and what I got was cupcakes with a mess of wet cookie on the bottom so bad it pulled the cupcake apart when trying to peel the paper off.  If I had left them in the oven longer, it would have burned the cupcake.

These were amazing! I had to resist eating the frozen cookie dough balls, the batter was so good! I ended up only keeping 4 cupcakes for myself and my husband, I sent the rest to work with him because we would've eaten them all haha! Also, I made mine with milk chocolate cake batter instead of yellow and it was wonderful! Thanks lovetohost!

Followed the recipe exactly as written and everyone at the birthday party thought they were very bland.  No flavor what so ever.  Would not make again.

5 stars from EACH of my 5 kids!  We have been using this for a while now and have made many combinations of cake and cookie dough.**update**  If I use these for my kids lunches I dont even frost them - they are plenty good without it as well and carry nicely in their lunch bags.

this was a good recipe i loved it as well as my friends. it is better with yellow cake because chocolate over powers the cookie dough. i also used paula deen's cookie dough truffle recipe instead of actual cookie dough cause i wanted to avoid using raw eggs. it tasted very good with this substitue

Amazing! Everyone loved them! I made a half batch them using a log of pre-made cookie dough and used part of the dough to bake tiny cookies used as a decoration. Also, I used Wilton's classic chocolate buttercream frosting recipe, found on their website. They tasted like they came from a bakery. Freezing the cookie dough is imperative!

Mmmm...very very good! I'm a sucker for cake though. It's my favorite food! You just have to be very very careful not to overbake these or the cookie dough center will not turn out right. I baked mine for about 18 minutes and will probably bake them even less next time.

Excellent idea! The changes that I made due to previous reviews were: I added cocoa to the cookie dough because I'm a chocolate fanatic, used devils food cake mix.  I made the cake mix according to the package directions and  after I dropped in the cookie dough I put more batter on top so they wouldn't concave. They came out delicious and PERFECT... wouldn't change a thing after my modifications.

These were so much fun, and delicious too! I made the cookie dough egg-free by subbing 2 1/2 TBS of milk for the egg in the recipe with great results! I Also did not use the boxed mix, instead I made "Rated R for Richness Chocolate Cake" from this site for the cupcake and "Rich Chocolate Frosting" along with some vanilla frosting to make the swirl effect. I decorated with mini chips and mini chips ahoy cookies. Everyone at our staff picnic loved them! A+!

I thought these were really good - a fun surprise inside a cupcake, who doesn't like that?  Used the choc icing recipe on the back of the Hershey box to top these & used white cake mix, it is what I had, they turned out great.  Added sprinkles to the icing for my daughter's b-day party, they were a hit!

I've been meaning to make these for a while and finally got an excuse to for my son's birthday!  I just bought cookie dough (the kind ready to bake in 24 pieces) and that worked just fine!  I didn't think the cupcakes were dry at ALL... very yummy!  Kids were very interested in the surprise inside their cupcakes!  FUN idea!

This recipe is wonderful! I used chocolate cake mix and already made cookie dough from the grocery.    Mine always get a hole in the center, but a dot of frosting on top covers that up.  I took this to a youth group event at church and the teens ate them up!

These are amazing!  It's VERY IMPORTANT to freeze the cookie dough and not overbake them (the recipe author posted some revised times in his review).  I've made them with chocolate cake instead of yellow and covered with chocolate ganache (melt 1 cup of chocolate chips in 1/2 cup of heavy cream + 1 tablespoon corn syrup).  Success, success, success!  (I even use the leftover ganache to drench mine in because I like them extra-decadent -- it almost turns into a lava cake if you spoon hot ganache on the cupcakes as you're serving them)

These are DEFINATELY the best EVER! WOW! I followed the recipe except added a little milk instead of the egg to the cookie dough(& I added it after mixing the flour mix w/the wet ingredients so I could get the right cookie dough consistency). Worked perfectly! These are absolutely amazing! I'm on my 2nd one, unfrosted, for my after breakfast treat;)

Excellent recipe!  I left out the egg in the cookie dough as another reviewer stated - it serves absolutely no purpose as the intention is to leave the cookie dough center raw (and thus, needs no moistening or leavening).  Also, I used chocolate cake mix for the brownies as I liked the visual distinction between the light and dark in the cupcake.  I topped them with a dark chocolate crumb coat and then used the Marshmallow Fondant recipe to top them.  They were incredible!!

Thanks for the recipe, lovestohost!  Tasty!  I used a white cake mix but otherwise followed the recipe, using Rick's Buttercream Frosting for the top.  They were good, but I'm not sure about using a cake mix.  I found a delicious way to use up the leftover cupcakes.  I chopped them up, heated them through in the microwave, and tossed them, frosting and all (including some of the leftover frosting I had), over vanilla ice cream!  It made for a very yummy topping for ice cream!

Wow!  What a neat idea to fill the cupcake with cookie dough!  I only had to refrigerate the dough for 1 hour and they were still good.  Be sure to only fill the muffin cups only 2/3 full.  If you put too much batter, you'll end up with extra cookie dough.

The kids think making cupcakes is pretty awesome, but when I pulled out the cookie dough from the freezer and told them to put one in each cupcake batter they screamed with pure excitement!  Oh, what fun these cupcakes are for children and adults alike!  I had no problems with the batter baking, being dry/overbaked or crumbly!  Excellent all the way around.  I used some CCC dough batter from another recipe from here (purposly saved enough batter just to make these).  Thank you for a very fun, creative recipe!

I cheated. I used boxed yellow cake mix and pre-cut cookie dough (placed in freezer for 5 hours). I did use the "Rich Chocolate Frosting" recipe from this site to top. I would advise users not to make their cookie dough balls too small, remember, they're not going to expand, but the cupcake is. Also, just set the dough balls on top, they'll sink on their own. Some reviewers suggested tipping the cupcakes onto a plate to avoid a dent in the top. I did this with the first batch and then the tops stuck to the plate, so I opted not to do it on the second batch and I had no dents after cooling. Mine took about 17 minutes in the oven to bake, until the top isn't shiny in the middle and the edges are getting golden. I love this recipe for the ease and possible combinations - maybe a double chocolate chunk cookie in yellow cake mix would have been a better choice...

Turned out perfect! I used premade cookie dough and a devils food cake mix. I made a whipped cream frosting from this site and it was just enough to not make them overly sweet. Will be making again for sure!

I made these for my Neice's Bday/4th of July cookout and they lasted maybe 30 mins. OMGosh they were so yummy! I used store bought cookie dough, a white cake mix, and the Butter Cream II Frosting from this site. Everyone loved them and wanted the recipe. Thank you so much for sharing this LTH, you are AWESOME!!

I made these for my sister's baby shower and everyone loved them!  I used premade cookie dough (cuz that's how I roll) and followed the recipe exactly other than that.  I think I could have baked them a minute or so less, but they were still great.

These cupcakes were OK.  Honestly, they just tasted like regular cake mix. I did freeze the cookie dough, overnight, and still you could hardly tell that it was there.  The cookie part just sort of blended into the rest of the cupcake. They were very moist though, not dry as some others experienced. Overall, it was not worth the extra effort and we won't be making these again.

Made these and the Self Filled Cupcakes from the site-everyone liked the Self Filled, but LOVED the Cookie Dough ones the best.  Fun surprise in the middle.   I actually cheated and used premade cookie dough and turn out perfect.   Looking forward to trying different cookie/cake combinations.

YUM! This is my second time making these and they are wonderful!!! I don't normally even like chocolate chip cookie dough, but I figured I would try them to see what the hype was all about. Well, I am soooo glad that I did! I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these cupcakes! Thanks, LTH for posting such a fun, different and  delicious recipe :)

I ended up using a Devil's Food mix b/c I didn't have yellow on hand and they were still great.  I used a store bought frosting and sprinkled the tops with a few chocolate chips.  I think I ended up with 30 cupcakes. They were a hit and I'll definitely make them again.

Just tried this recipe and i have to laugh at myself because i used a sugar cookie with yellow cake mix. Can't see the difference between the cookie and the cake but boy oh boy can you taste it :-D. Thanks for the great recipe. Cant wait to try it with chocolate chip cookies ;-) ;-)

I'm not really a fan of the cupcakes. It's a good recipe, but the reality if biting into cookie dough just didn't appeal. However, the cookie dough in this recipe makes some of the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever had. Bake at 350 for 12-14 minutes. I've used Mimi and regular chips-- all great.

I have recently taken up cupcake baking which means my husband has recently taken up cupcake eating. He said and I quote, "these are the best cupcakes you have ever made!" This may not seem like something to get excited about, however, this is an easy man to feed, but a hard man to wow. Kudos for the recipe!

This is a wonderfull idea, everyone loved it. I will say that I use my own cake recipe (I don't like to do boxed stuff)but that being said, anyone who is complaining about the cake being dry, use the directions on the box instead. But really the rating from me is on the dough for the cookie part. Turnes out wonderfull every time :)

This is the best cupcake I have EVER had in my whole life! I didn't tell anyone that there was a cookie in the middle and boy were they surprised when they bit into it! I used Devil Food cake mix instead of vanilla and I made my own peanut butter butter cream frosting to top this bad boy off!

Tasted really good, but the muffins didn't raise above the cookie dough.  The second batch I even pushed them down, since they didn't seem to sink into the cupcake like in the pictures and it still didn't work.  Even though they looked a bit funny, they were a hit and I will make again.  Maybe I will have to make the dough balls smaller???

I just finished the cookie dough part and put them in the freezer. I just have a few questions - How do I store them (since I will be serving them tomorrow)? Covered and room temp? Fridge?
Also - What's a good chocolate buttercream for the frosting? Thank you!!!

When I saw this recipe I had to try it for a work function.  But I was short on time so I decided to take the easy way out.  Normally, I'm completely against using pre made mixes but I literally had a few short hours in an evening to finish these.

I used Pilsbury cookie dough.  Rolled the dough into balls and froze for a couple hours.  Then prepared one chocolate and one vanilla cake mix.  Finished with vanilla icing, a mini cookie and large chocolate chip on top.  It worked out perfectly!  

Next time I would definitely use my own home made cupcake recipe and favourite cookie dough but if you're short on time the pre made mixes tasted great!

I would recommend using a slightly less sweet icing.  Peanut butter or dark chocolate would be great!

These came out very good but very rich, though that might be because I used a chocolate cake mix instead of vanilla. Freezing the dough overnight and using mini-chocolate chips made the dough work well in the cupcake, though I think I'd like more cupcake and less cookie dough next time.  I might try playing around with the size of the dough and the cooking times. We'll see how that works.

This got mixed reviews from the family. While I loved the cookie dough/cake combination, my husband thought that the cookie dough flavor overpowered the cake, a guest said that it was "interesting," and my two year old demanded more. 

On a very random note, I threw a few leftover frozen dough balls onto a cookie sheet and baked them for 10 minutes at 350 deg--they were probably the best chocolate chip cookies that I've ever made.

These were absolutely delicious! I followed your directions about making sure that you completely freeze the cookie dough  and just cooling them for 18 minutes and they turned out fantastic. The only thing I changed was I used devil's food cake because I am a chocoholic! Thanks for such a phenomenal recipe!

This turned out very well and was loved by all! I bought the pre-packaged mini cookie dough from the grocery store and I froze it for 2-3 days. (I bought a 40ct package and then bought more and froze like 10 more)

I think it turns out better when you freeze the cookie dough overnight or for a couple days before you make them because I froze the remaining cookie dough for my mom to use and she made them like 4 to 5 hours after I put them in the freezer and she said that they turned out dry when she did it that way.

Otherwise a very great recipe!

My family enjoyed these. Used a boxed cookie mix added a few extra chocolate chips. My husband felt the chocolate frosting really enhanced the cupcake. If you live in an area here you can get "jiffy" mixes, the smaller size packages  of frosting ,cake and choco chip cookie mix work perfectly to make 12  yummy frosted cup cakes.

Great recipe! I only had regular chocolate chips and they worked great! I froze the dough for two hours and it worked perfectly.. I baked for 18 minutes and it kept the cookie dough from overcooking. Amazing recipe!!!!

Delish!  I paired them with the chocolate fudge buttercream made with hot fudge on this site.  I made little tiny chocolate chip cookies to garnish.  The first time I made thses I made the cookie dough too small.  The second time I made them just over an inch and it was a perfect ratio!  I now keep frozen cookie dough balls in my freezer just in case.  I cut up small squares of plastic wrap and wrapped each ball then put the wrapped balls in a freezer bag.  They keep well for more than a month at least.

Holy cow was this out of this world!! Definitely the best cupcake ever! Normal cupcakes are disappointing after this! I used chocolate cake mix instead of the yellow & used white chocolate chips instead of chocolate. Brought them to a party & was hoping to have some leftover to take home but they were gone as fast as they got there!!!!! They take a bit of work but are sooo worth it! I'm already craving them again :-)

these cupcakes are so good.  I colored the batter with food coloring (14 yellow & 4 red for orange) for Halloween and the kids loved them!  They had fun making the cupcakes as well.  Will definitely make again.  Freezing the cookie dough is a must.  The center came out "gooey" and perfect.

I must have done something wrong. While they taste great and the dough came out the way it's supposed to... it sort of deflated like a souffle. I used the premade/cut cookie dough which I thought were good size dough balls.

One of the best cupcakes I've ever baked!
The procedure was very easy and simple and they came out perfect. Like everyone else I used a peanut butter frosting recipe from this website.
I had to knock off a star, not because I rarely give 5 stars, but because the proportions were not correct (not enough cookie dough and too much cupcake batter) and because only four people tried my cupcakes at the potluck I made these for (everyone else was more interested in the savory dishes for some reason...But the 4 people who tried these said they were "really good").

I used devil's food cake mix instead because that is what I had on hand. I used vanilla frosting and decorated with mini chocolate chips. I had issue with the baking time. When i took it out at the time suggested the cupcake was still runny. I put it back in longer but of course then the cookie dough was cooked too long. I will try again watching the cupcakes a little more carefully.

I needed a different kind of cupcake for my daughter's 9th birthday, so I tried these out - ahead of time. I made them the first day of school and when school was out, and we came home, we had 3 of her friends - all of them loved these!! The only difference, I make my own cake, I don't use the store bought ones at all.

I REALLY wanted these to turn out great! That just didnt happen for me :( I bought pre-made refridgerated cookie dough and froze for a little over 2 hours.  I made Davids Yellow Cake recipe from this site (the cake AMAZING) instead of boxed cake mix. I baked for 17-18 minutes and let them cool for 10 minutes in pan like instructed and when I came back to remove from pan the centers were caved in, bad! Im racking my brain trying to figure out what I did wrong! Im thinking that 2 hours wasnt enough for my cookie dough and it sort of melted and spread into the cake. I will try this again using boxed cake and freeze the cookie dough for several days! If youre looking for a YUMMY yellow cake recipe, check out Davids Yellow Cake recipe on this site, its awesome!

I LOVE this recipe! I've made it many times, and I'm the type of person who likes to try new things, so I don't typically make one recipe more than once unless it was great.

If you're worried about the potential of uncooked eggs in this recipe, you can sub the eggs in the cookie dough for 2 tbsp water mixed with 1 tbsp of oil. Some say to add 1tsp of baking powder, but because you don't need much more of a leavening agent, I left it out, and it turned out great. (I actually only did this because I was out of eggs).

These have been a staple in my house and I have probably made them atleast 20 times for friends and neighbors.  I play around and decorate them differently each time.  Everyone gets such a kick that there is a cookie in the middle.

These were fantastic and easy to make using pre-made cookie dough. They disappeared quick at a weekend cookout. Made another batch for my nephew's 21st b-day...big "awesome" from him! Today I made them with choc. cake and peanut butter dough that I made from a pk. mix yesterday and froze. Yum! Don't overbake...16 min. is fine. I kept in fridge after frosting due to high temps here right now. Saw pre-made Reese's dough at supermarket...endless possibilities. Thanks for this great recipe!

I made these for a school project with another type of cupcake. These were the hit of the class. Everyone wanted one, but I soon ran out. I even tried a white chocolate macadamia nut version. Just substitute white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts for the chocolate chips in the cookie dough.

Too sweet for my taste but everyone else loved them!  I let the cookie dough freeze overnight & baked the cupcakes for 17 minutes.  The cookie dough stayed doughy & the cupcake was super moist. Used Trader Joe's boxed chocolate frosting which is what I think put them over the edge for me. Will try with a not so sweet frosting next time.

the first time i made these, i only froze the cookie dough for an hour & a half and they turned out perfect, like a gooey cookie on top of a vanilla cupcake (i also used my vanilla cupcake recipe instead of cake mix). the next time i made them, they froze too long and turned out like some chocolate chips in the middle of a cupcake... i definitely recommend not freezing the cookie dough as long and they turn out fantastic!

I followed the directions exactly, except using table salt instead of sea salt which I know is stronger so I used less. Though my cookie dough is more cake-like than dough-like so I was a little disappointed. I'm also not a fan of using boxed cakes.

one word...AMAZING!! I used prepackaged cookie dough, and betty crocker chocolate cake mix, and they were SO moist and delicious! I cooked them for about 18-20 minutes, and when i took the out they still seemed not-done, but once i let them cool they were perfect. 5 stars from me :)

Pretty good, different than normal cupcakes since it has cookie dough in it.  I've made and had better cupcakes before, but these were fun just because it was something out of the usual.

OK, first of all, I cannot believe in all of the reviews I read, not once did anybody not have problems with these running over.  I questioned if I should use regular sized paper liners or the jumbo ones.  I'm so glad I went with the jumbo's.  They would have definitely ran over using regular size liners.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used a devil's food cake mix (liked the looks of other's examples) and I baked for 22 min.  At 16 min., the batter was still soupy and at 20, tooth pick, still not clean.  Looked beautiful when I took them out of the oven, but after cooling, the centers sank, but I will ice to cover that up.  I ate one about 20 minutes after taking them out of the oven w/o icing.  The mix of the cookie dough and the choc. cake was super gooey and yummy.  Made me want 3 more w/ a glass of milk.  The cookie dough was still dough; not overcooked.  I can't wait to share these w/ the people I made them for.  Rated them 4 instead of 5 stars, simply because had I put them in regular size cupcake liners, I would have had 24 ugly, run-over cupcakes in my oven.

What a hit!  I made these for a multiple birthday dinner at a restaurant.  Everyone loved them, including the waitress.  I doubled the recipe and made as written using 1 yellow cake mix and 1 chocolate cake mix.  Frosted with Rick's Special Buttercream Frosting from this site - and they were wonderful!  Thanks lovestohost for creating this recipe.

This is a fabulous idea!  I just baked 4 dozen of these to go along with other cupcakes for my sons graduation.  Since I'm making soo many, I used premade Papa Murphy's cookie dough- worked fabulously.  I'm going to frost them with Brown Sugar Cookie Dough Frosting. I can't wait to taste it all together!

When testing out this recipe I cooked the cupcakes in 2 batches one longer than the other.  The results are that the cupcakes cooked for a shorter period of time were the best by far.  They were a little doughie in the center, a little messier and they were a much bigger hit than the ones that were cooked all the way through.
If the cookie dough is completly done then it is just another cupcake.

This was a huge hit! They were perfect for my Cookie Monster cupcakes (pics 211 & 212). The cookie dough seemed a little dry when I made it, but the end result was perfect! Definitely freeze them as instructed, and baking for 16 minutes was the PERFECT bake time. They will look under done but they are not.  Follow the recipe exactly and you'll get rave reviews from both adults and kids! And kids were amazed-- "Cookie monster ate the cookie, it's in his belly!"

Very cool recipe! I made my usual replacements on this, using eggwhites instead of whole eggs and replacing butter and oil with apple sauce + oil mixes. It worked just fine. I also made 2 batches of the recipe - 1 with yellow cake mix, the other with devil's food mix. The darker mix came out with the white cookies dough in the middle and gave it a better look. I did not ice and they were still very yummy. Will definitely make these again!

I made these for my daughter's birthday, doing a 'trial run' first.  Froze the cookie dough as others suggested.  I found that my instinct to press down the cookie dough balls into the cupcake batter seemed to result in them baking along with the cake. Still, they were very good, especially with homemade chocolate frosting from this site.

So... I'm really not sure what's up with the people giving poor reviews and saying stuff like "This tastes just like a cupcake with cookie dough in it"... that's... what it is XD  I don't get why some people think a recipe is going to magically turn into something else when they make it.  This isn't Paper Mario people.  And for crying out loud, if the recipe calls for something you don't like, use your best judgment and fix it up a little. Now that that's out of the way.  This was the first time I ever made cupcakes.  It seemed simple enough.  I followed the recipe exactly and was really surprised with how well the cookie dough blended in with the cake mix.  However, the taste wasn't out of this world.  I was expecting a little more.  They weren't bad by any means, but they weren't quite what I was expecting.  So I give 3 stars for taste and one extra point for creativity.  I think I'm going to experiment with this a little and use other cookie dough and cupcake recipes.

I made 4 batches of these in one week for various parties.  I never made the cookie dough from scratch.  I used store bought and found it wonderful.  Be careful to not buy the mini-cookie dough (40 per pack) as it is really too small and they dry out a bit.  Our favorite combo was peanut butter cookie dough with chocolate cake mix and peanut butter frosting.  Oh my....yum.  We also found that you can freeze these pretty well.  After they cool, put 6 in a freezer bag and place in the freezer.  Take them out, frost and let them thaw all of the way.  We are not worried about long term freezer storage...they won't last that long!

Awesome! I made these last night and my husband (who is a huge cookie fan) loved them! We topped them with vanilla ice cream. They were part of our dessert/ hump day where we have dessert on Wednesdays. I split the recipe in half to make 12 cupcakes (since there is only 2 of us) and used chocolate cake mix instead. Yummy!

It was good, but I wish the frozen ball wouldn't go straight to the bottom. One person took a bite and the ball separated from the rest of the cupcake and fell to the floor...not cool. Otherwise, tastes great. I thought they would be too sweet with frosting so I mixed cool whip with white chocolate pudding and frosted with that. YUM!

Yes, cookie dough definitely turns to cookie when you bake it.  The cupcake was still yummy.  The combo was a little strange.  I tried to get creative and use mini-snickers in the middle, but had to refrigerate the cupcakes after I put cream cheese icing on them which equals hardened snickers.  Wish i cut put cookie dough in after they cooked,but I have no idea how.  Worth a shot, but I probably won't make these again.

I thought these were okay... nothing spectacular. I was expecting a lot more. I didn't think the cookie dough flavor was very strong even though I did big pieces inside each. The cupcake itself was very moist and had a great texture. I think they would have tasted better with a chocolate flavored cake mix.

These truly are the best cupcakes! I used yellow cake mix, premade chocolate chip cookie dough, and made homemade whipped chocolate ganache frosting. YUMMY! I used the leftover cookie dough to make teeny tiny little cookies to add a touch of decoration!

Wasn't really worth the effort. They took much longer to bake than 18 minutes, and I don't know if it was mentioned at all, however because the dough is only partially cooked, essentially of a raw consistency, leaving at room temperature to serve is unappealing.  I refridgerated these prior to serving, and it salvaged them.  Also, the dough itself is lackluster as far as c.chip dough goes... use your own personal favorite. And though I made this with a yellow cake mix, I would suggest using chocolate. I'll give it 3 stars for a novel idea that I truly wanted to work.

These are the BEST cupcakes I have ever eaten.  My husband usually doesn't like cupcakes but he LOVED these and gained 10 pounds this week because he couldn't stop eating them.  I used pre-made cookie dough that had bits of brownie pieces in it and left them in the freezer for 3 hours instead of 2 just to make sure they were completely frozen. I also used WHITE cake mix and added some cocoa powder to it for flavor and coloring and put in a little extra oil and they were PERFECT! I also made a homemade cream cheese frosting and sprinkled it with chocolate sprinkles.  This is the perfect dessert for any occasion!

My husband said rate them 4 out of 5 and I would agree.  They are very good and very easy but I would not say they are spectacular.  After reading all of the reviews I was expecting the best cupcake in the world and to me it was just a cupcake.  I used the ready made break apart cookie dough you can buy, froze them for about 2 hours and used a yellow cake mix and baked for 18 to 20 min. and had absolutely no problems.  Again they are VERY easy to make.  I definitely recommend but I guess for some reason I was expecting way to much and got disappointed - sorry.  I even took them to a potluck and got NO feed back and when I take something to a potluck and don't get any feed back I will probably never take it again - sorry...

OH MY GOSH this is the best thing I have EVER ate!!!! ;)  No, really I made these with Pillsbury cookie dough (already prepared) and devil food cake mix.  They were so good I didn't even bother icing all of them.  My husband and I thought they were the best when they were cold (I put them in the refrigerator over night) and were not iced!  I just made these Saturday and will be making more tonight!  My whole family ate them and loved them so now I have to bring some for coworkers who I know will LOVE them too! THANK YOU! I can't wait for the cake/cookie dough recipe!!! :)

Great easy recipe! Can easily be made many ways. Also you can change box cupcake mix for personal which is what I did the second time I made these!

WOW.  I followed the recipe exactly, but only baked for 17 min.  I'm glad I doubled the cookie dough...I'll be making more tomorrow.

If you follow the directions with the freezing of the cookie dough, these are very easy to make.  My daughters and I formed a mini assembly line, putting the batter, the dough, and then more batter in the cupcake liners.  These baked up perfectly in exactly 20 minutes.  I made both a chocolate and a vanilla frosting and then swirl piped them together on the top, and sprinkled with more chocolate chips.  These are fun to make, and even more fun to eat!

These are GREAT! I made these yesterday for testing because my daughter wants them for her birthday party next weekend and she loves them! I used Devils food cake and the milky way icing on this website and it turned out perfect.

i've made these twice now once with white cake mix and once with chocolate fudge. chocolate was by far my favorite of the two, to save time i used pre-made cookie dough and let it sit in the freezer over night. it was a great hit everyone has loved them and they were all so confused by the fact that it was still dough after baking them and not a cookie

Made these for a co-worker's birthday, and they disappeared fast! Received a lot of compliments. I followed steps 2-4 exactly and used the premade Toll House cookie dough which was already frozen. Topped with Duncan Hines chocolate frosting. They were a hit! I'd make these again; it was so easy.

Dry, and I would use a chocolate cake mix to really differentiate from the cookie dough. But with a moist chocolate cake, this would be excellent

These were great! I took the easy way out and bought pre-made cookie dough. Used chococate fudge cake mix, frosted with buttercream, and sprinkled mini-chocolate chips on top. I froze the dough for about 2 hours, but next time I will freeze longer. I baked mine for 16 minutes, and while the cookie dough was still pretty doughy, I'd like to see if I can get it a little gooier. Regardless, they looked great, tasted great (nice and moist), and we only have three left over two days later.

These were a huge hit at my stepdaughter's birthday party.  All of the kids couldn't quite figure out what they'd bitten into and were so giggly when I told them it was cookie dough!  Great idea, thanks LTH!

Awesome recipe! I had just enough cookie dough to make 24 little cookies to use as a decoration on top of the cupcakes. I made these with my sister, who doesn't like cake mix...so we ended up making a homemade yellow cake instead. (David's Yellow Cake from this site) Because of this, and because our oven overheats a bit, the cookie dough overbaked a bit (became more cookie like) before the cake was done. Even so, these were delicious! I used the Creamy Chocolate Frosting recipe from this site to top the cupcakes...it was the perfect compliment. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I did not think these cupcakes were that great. If you follow the recipe exactly you will get what is promised, but a ball of cookie dough in the middle of cupcake that is frosted... is just too much going on at once. My cousin loved them so it might just be a matter of taste. I will just say that I love cookies, cookie dough, and cupcakes. But not all in one bite.

I made these MINI cupcakes instead! perfect size for this decadent treat! made the cookiedough from scratch (with no egg) used the one bowl choc. cake from this website as well as the buttercream frosting. baked at 325 for 12 mins, but i would go for 13 next time. i was so paranoid from all the other reviews that i had to throw a batch out that wasnt cooked enough. froze the cookie dough in 1.5tsp balls and it made about 42 MINI cupcakes. i also let them sit in the pan for 10mins after taking them out of the oven. I also found that they were a little "greasy" - could be that i sprayed the pan rather then use cupcake liners, but i let them settle in the fridge for 2 days, uniced, to dry them out and it worked to be the perfect consistancy to frost the day i served them. I dont know who was more pumped: me to try this brillant recipe out or my boyfriend's hockey team who got to eat them! thanks for sharing!

wonderfull, and very original indeed. Very well worth the extra work of preparing the cookie dough, that you can easily do in advance or avoid, if you're very pressed. The freezing part is essential, thou!

I love this recipie. Although I just buy the ready to use cookie dough. The first time I over filled my cupcakes and the tops boiled over and fell flat. I'm on my second batch right now and I only filled them half full and they are comming out nicly. I also put my iceing in a bag, snip the end, and squirted 2010 on each cupcake for our party tonight. I didn't want to put too much iceing because I know it's gonna be a very sweet treat already. Thank you!

These cupcakes are amazing!  I use a dark chocolate cake mix and the preportioned cookie dough at the store.  Topped with a mocha buttercream icing they are to die for!  Do not skip the freezing step, I froze my dough overnight.

LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!! This is one of the best ideas of the 21st century!!! I'm not much of a baker, so I used devils food cake mix, and premade cookie dough. I think next time I am going to use chocolate cake mix and peanut butter cookie dough with chocolare chips!!

BEST CUPCAKES EVER!!!! I put a special twist on these!  I made yellow cake batter and devils food cake batter - With my last batch of cupcakes i mixed the yellow and devils food!  Marble chocolate chip cookie dough cupcakes!  YUM!  One mistake I made was putting too many in the oven at one time, and they weren't baking right (I shoulda known better!) Too many pans at one time screws up the baking.  REMEMBER! the key is freezing the dough, and not overbaking! Your edges should be puffed up and firm, but middle still very moist and slightly underbaked looking - that means its time to take them out right away!  This should only be around 16-18 minutes. Don't wait for the middle to cook allll the way. Let them sit approx 10 minutes before taking them out of the pans! Great recipe! : )

This IS the best cupcake ever!  I made it a whole lot easier (as some others did) by using break-and-bake cookie dough.  I made it with chocolate fudge cake mix & piped on store-bought white buttercream icing.  I sprinkled mini chocolate chips on top too.  DeLiCiOuS!!  Make sure the cookie dough is frozen...and don't overbake...only about 17 min or so.

I made this for the first time yesterday and it is really good, but next time I will try to make about 30 instead of 24. I found the dough balls were really big and the cake mix had a hard time baking up around them and part of the dough balls got baked.  The second dozen the dough balls were a little smaller and I used a little less batter (probably used too much in the first dozen so I had less for each cupcake in the second) but the cupcakes came out perfect and the dough sunk in just like it should and wasn't dry in the middle.  So, I think I would make smaller balls and use less batter and get a few more cupcakes out of it. Very important, as the original poster said, NOT to overbake.  20 minutes may be too long unless you have a cooler oven. I used chocolate cake mix which was delicious!

I'm not sure what the hype is about.  They are good, but not what I expected.  I made them exactly as stated.  I thought it would taste like biting into a cookie hidden in a cupcake but chocolate chips added to the cupcake might have been just as good.  I would probably make them again.  They are good! Just not something amazing and different.

I have to agree these are the BEST cupcakes ever.  I followed the directions, except using a different cookie dough (Felix's) because I also had to make cookies.  I am not a huge cupcake fan, but could eat these all day!  Thanks for the perfect recipe LTH.

These were right up our alley!!  We loved them, kids and adults a like.  I read many post prior to baking which really helped.  They literally turned out perfect.  Freezing the dough, baking for exactly 18 minutes and leaving in the pan for 10 minutes did the trick.  Thanks for the great recipe, lovestohost!  We will be making these over and over.

I am not sure what all the fuss is about.  I didn't find these to be that great.  I think the problem is that I am not a fan of boxed cake mixes and this is the major part of this recipe.  I think if you used a recipe from scratch, then it would be much better.  Definitely more work, but I think the end result would be tastier.  I had to test this recipe out given all of the reviews but on a personal preference, just didn't find this recipe to be that great.  I ended up throwing most of them out!

Oh my... I have an extreme sweet tooth and these were exactly what I needed! I did use pre-made dough (I was running low on time and ingredients) and used a chocolate cake mix, and these were awesome. My younger brother, who hardly even eat sweets and is picky when he does, LOVED these! Thanks for the idea/recipe!

I really wanted to love this recipe, but I just didn't.  I was expecting it to be different, somehow.  The cupcake has to be totally underbaked and still be in batter form in the center in order for the cookie dough not to get cooked, but even with a "liquid" cupcake center the cookie started baking.  It tasted good, but not great, so I don't think I'd make them again.  UPDATE - I sent these cupcakes to my husband's office and they received rave reviews from his coworkers.  His boss called it "the best cupcake I've ever had in my life."  So I guess my personal opinion on them doesn't matter!

O.MY.GOD!!! these are absolutely amazing.  i made a few subtle changes - mini chocolate chips and chocolate cake mix - plus i frosted them with a chocolate ganache. how wonderful these were!!! i only baked them 16 mins and had no issues with dry crumbly dough. the cupcakes were cooked through and moist, and the dough was still dough-y and o so delicious! thank you thank you!!!

Well....not too often do I read a recipe and make it the same day but these looked so good that I had to try them. I did not make them with yellow cake mix but with Triple Chocolate Fudge cake mix and chocolate frosting. You MUST freeze the cookie dough in order for it NOT to bake along with the cupcake batter. My oven is brand new so my baking time is pretty accurate. I baked for 18 minutes. You have to remember that the batter will continue to cook after you take them out of the oven to cool. These are definitely a keeper...so cute and fun! I will make them again!!

These were fabulous!  I made them for an office baby shower and got rave reviews.  I am embarrassed to admit I used store-bought cookie dough, cake mix (Devil's Food), and canned chocolate frosting.  Covered the top with chocolate shavings and garnished with those cute pacifiers made with Lifesavers and jelly beans.  Not as quite as pretty as the photo, but plenty good, quick, and easy.

This cupcakes turned out perfectly and tasted like a dream! I used prepackaged cookie dough to save time, and devils food cake mix and vanilla buttercream frosting. Next time I will make my own cookie dough so I can omit the eggs, which to me was the only drawback. Still this recipe gets 5 stars!

Perfect, yummy!! Made the cookie dough from scratch and omitted the egg as advised. You could always add a little milk if you need some moisture in the dough. Used devil's food cake mix. They are so good you don't even need frosting! My son brought a friend home when he heard I had made these, they polished off four apiece. Baked a little less than written (18 minutes) as others advised. I'll make these forever! Chill the leftovers and if your store doesn't have mini morsels, regular size ones are fine.

I love cookie dough, so I had to make these.  They turned out very well for the most part.  I did take out the dough before I spooned out the batter for the first pan so they weren't entirely frozen and the dough was a little more cooked in that batch.  I realized my mistake and kept the dough for the second pan in the freezer and they were perfect.  Some of the cupcakes sunk a little bit in the center, but no one could tell.  I might consider making an eggless cookie dough in the future, however.

I made these for our 4th of July picnic and there wasn't a single one left.  So I had to make another batch and keep them just for myself.  They are so easy to make - I just used store bought cookie dough and boxed cake mix (I recommend chocolate fudge flavor).  I baked them for only 16 minutes at 350 and they come out perfect every time.

Amazing! These were so delicious, with very moist cake and gooey cookie dough. These were so good warm out of the oven. :) I used a devil's food cake mix, but I'm going to make these again with yellow mix. I also topped them with a simple powdered sugar & butter frosting. I noticed that for the frosting, organic butter makes ALL the difference. It tastes so much better. I also noticed that the cupcake pan determines if the top of the cake will rise or fall and make a dome. My heavier, better quality pan let them rise and didn't dome, whereas my lightweight cheap pan made them dome. Both were delicious, but for aesthetics, heavier pan works better.

These cupcakes are fantastic. I used a Devil's food cake mix and the premade Pillsbury choc chip cookie dough which I made into balls and put in a baggie in the freezer the night before. They go together so quickly. It is sooo important,DO NOT OVERBAKE, my dgtr made these in May and they were dry and hard on the bottom, 16-18 min, check on the outer edge of the cupcake. I used the Butter Cream Frosting II from this site. Every one at the party asked how to make them.

These were delicious. I had to make myself stop at one, but I wanted more. The only recommendation I would make would be about frosting. I frosted them with a yummy buttercream and they were good, but in 109 degree weather here this past weekend,  it was just too much. Next time I serve these when it is so darned hot, I'll just dust the tops with powdered sugar and cocoa powder. Mine took 20 minutes to bake and the cookie dough was slightly gooey and yummy

We really enjoyed these.  I went easy on the frosting and glad I did as they were very sweet.  I used choc cake mix, baked for 20 minutes and perfect.  The indent in the middle from frozen (store bought) cookie dough was quickly covered with the frosting.  This was quick and delicious!

These are amazing.  I don't eat sweets but DH loved them.  He was in the hospital recently, in the ICU, and I made these for the nurses that took care of him.  They loved these.  Thanks so much for sharing your recipe.

Awesome.  I took the easy way out as I was short on time.  I did everything in steps.  I bought refrigerated break-apart cookie dough.  I rounded and froze one night.  The next night I made a yellow cake mix and baked (my screwy oven was perfect at 14 minutes).  The next morning, I frosted with milk chocolate canned icing.  Doing a little each day really worked with my crazy schedule last week.  And the results were marvelous.  Thanks lth!!

My husband kept commenting about how good they smelled while they were baking. I finally let him have one and that was the quietest he has been all night. It was so good my 15 month old kept trying to pick up pieces off the floor that dropped while Daddy was trying to feed her and eat a cupcake himself. Thank you LTH for such a unique and absolutely delicious cupcake!

This was a hit at my mom's birthday dinner - I took the easy way out and used the Pillsbury break apart cookie dough - just had to roll them into balls, froze them overnight; used devil's food cake mix and cream cheese icing from this site. 18 min cook time did the trick (was worried at first about the dough balls - they formed big bumps in the middle that I thought would be weird to frost, but toward the end they ended up sinking down, kind of caving the cupcake in, but the frosting covered it just fine. Refrigerated the leftover cupcakes and the dough inside is fine when eaten cold (I worried it would be too hard.) This really is sinful in the best possible way - many thanks for the unusual b-day treat for Mom and family (who took extra cupcakes home with a smile : ) I just sent hubby to the neighbors' house with the extras I have, b/c I don't want the temptation!

I omitted the raw egg in the cookie dough recipe and these cupcakes still turned out perfect!  I also baked mine for about 16-17 minutes, and the cookie stayed nice and gooey while the cake was moist and soft.  Will definitely make again!

I've been dying to try this recipe and finally did today - oh my gosh, it's fantastic!  I used a triple chocolate fudge cake mix and store bought peanut butter cookie dough.  I frosted them with the fluffy peanut butter frosting from this site and wow, amazing!

I used the Award Winning Soft Chocolate Chip Cookies recipe from this site for the frozen cookie balls. I froze them for a couple days, and then made the yellow cake recipe from the "Cake Mixes from Scratch and Variations" and baked them for about 16-18 minutes (my first batch was 18, and then the second was 16 and that was perfect as well.) SO GOOD! I haven't tried it with frosting yet, but I'm going to use the Chocolate Cookie Buttercream Frosting recipe from this site. Again, this was amazing!!

Oh my goodness!! These are terrific!  I took suggestions from others and bought pre-made cookies and it turned out fabulous.  I used devil's food cake mix and chocolate cookies.  Only baked them for 17 minutes and the cookie had just started to melt.  This one is a keeper!!

These are sooo moist and yummy! I used pre-made chocolate chip cookie dough and chocolate cake mix instead of yellow. They only needed 17 minutes in the oven. Some of them "deflated" and got holes in the center but icing covered that right up and nobody noticed. They were quite a hit!

The kids really enjoyed it, I thought it was good... I made them first exactly as directed and then with chocolate cake mix.  We all preferred the chocolate, but I also added a small package of chocolate pudding to the cake mix which made the chocolate cupcakes much more moist.  I used a 1 tbspn scoop (ice cream style) to scoop the cookie dough. The first time  I pushed them down into the cake batter all the way (after freezing) and the "cookie" ended up on the bottom. The second time I put them on top and just slightly pushed in and they stayed in the center.

What an inspired idea! and so delicious too. I made the cookie dough part of this recipe but I used a from scratch vanilla/yellow cupcake recipe cause I never have boxed mix on hand. These turned out delightful! I couldn't wait to try them so I had one unfrosted and Oh My! The pleasure of having cookie and cake in one bite was a combination I never thought of and honestly wasn't sure if I would like. But this has just made it into my Absolute Favourite Recipes Folder. Thanks for sharing LTH!

Excellent recipe! Not only are these absolutely delectable, the instructions are clear and concise, which I really appreciate. I'm not usually a fan of yellow cake, but these made it heavenly. They are delicious plain or frosted. Thank you, LTH!

These are VERY good - a great combination.  I generally don't like yellow cake, but it is the perfect foundation for this cupcake.  I had to make these in a hurry, so took advantage of all the shortcuts: pre-made refrigerated cubes of Toll House cookie dough, Betty Crocker cake mix, and store-bought milk chocolate frosting.  I separated out the cookie dough and froze the cubes for about 90 minutes, and then threw everything together per the recipe.  SO good.  I'm sure they would be even better if I was able to make the dough by hand, but don't shy away from trying this dessert with all pre-made goodies.  This will definitely be a new favorite in our house.

Delicious!  I made a batch for my son's baseball team, but of course, my son and hubby had to "test" them out first.  They LOVED them!  Hubby ate it plain while it was still warm and my son tried it with and without frosting and liked it better without.  I liked them with the Pro Ganache frosting...recipe is also from this site.  Cake and Cookie combined...match made in heaven!!!  Very easy and YUMMY recipe.  It took a bit of planning (cookie dough first and then let it freeze for 2 hours), but it was still easy.  I will definitely make them again!

This was a great idea.  I wanted to try it especially for my Daughter as she is always eating the cookie dough that I send home with her daughters, before they get a chance to bake it.  Well, the girls ate all of the cupcakes today so there weren't any to send her.  (Fair is Fair, huh?) I will make another batch tomorrow and probably many more times as well.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were really good, especially with the creamy chocolate frosting from allrecipes.  Followed the recommendation to freeze cookie dough overnight, and they came out really good.  Will definitely add them to my paper recipe book and make for years to come.

I made these cookies as a surprise for the Super Bowl 2015 party I was invited to & they are a hit! I'm so glad I did it. Everyone wants my recipe I told them it's no secret I found it on allrecipes.com. I come here to try many different recipes and Its never failed. Good luck and don't forget to freeze the cookies the night before.

There is a fine line between underbaking them and baking them just the right amount of time. Regardless, they're amazing. I made a cream cheese icing with two scoops of cocoa powder in it, and the entire effect was excessive in the best possible way.

These were just okay for me.  I have never met a cupcake I DIDN'T like. ;)  But these weren't my favorite - I was hoping for more "Wow!" especially when my guests tried them (and I let the chocolate chip part be a surprise) - but nobody even remarked that they were especially tasty.  A little disappointing.

I am known as the Baking Queen at my office, and I made these for one of the partners for his birthday about a year ago.  Since then, they have become the most requested birthday treat.  It's great because they can be customized to anyone's tastes by changing the cake/cookie/frosting combination.  Because I'm not a huge chocolate fan, my favorite is a spice cake with a sugar cookie inside and a vanilla buttercream, but anything really works.  I'll chime in with everyone else and reiterate that the cookie dough HAS to be frozen for these to come out, and baking time (i.e., not baking too long) is imperative for the cookie inside to not overcook or create a gap between the dough and the top of the cupcake.  I'll be making them again this week for another co-worker who has requested chocolate chip cookies inside chocolate cupcakes.  Also, they are a lot of fun to decorate--I love maing the break and bake nestle mini chcolate chip cookies, cutting them in half and using them as a garnish on top.

I liked it because it was different, but it wasn't the best cupcake recipe I have ever made.

I made these for a birthday party and they were a HIT! Everyone raved about them I was shocked. They weren't exactly the easiest cupcake I've ever made.... But I will make again! I made 3 batches, one with marble cake mix, one with funfetti cake mix, and one with butter golden cake mix. For the record, DONT use butter golden cake mix! The consistency does not work with the cookie dough! I had to throw this batch out. But the others turned out very good! I only baked for 17 minutes, and that made them perfect.

So quick question. I am in the freezing process right now. The recipe call for 3 eggs twice but the directions say 1 egg for the cookie dough and 3 eggs for the cupcake. I am a follow the recipe kind of person especially with baking so was I right to only use 1 egg for the cookie dough? It was really crumbly and made it hard to form so I'm thinking maybe I should've used 3? I can't really give this a rating given I haven't finished but had too hence only 3 stars.

I followed the instructions as written with a slight change. I used two boxes of cake mix, one german chocolate and one yellow, made separately and as directed on the boxes (they were both 15.25 oz sized boxes so the amount of water suggested in this recipe would have been too much). I made the cookie dough batter as written except I didn't have mini chocolate chips. I used regular white, milk chocolate and semi sweet chips. I then used a tablespoon to make the balls, and cut the balls in half to make enough for 48 cupcakes. I placed the dough balls on a waxed paper lined cookie sheet and froze them for one hour. Since they were smaller in size, they froze solid in that time. I put approx. 1/8 cup of batter in the cup cake liner, placed a cookie dough ball in the center, then added another 1/8 cup of batter on top. I baked them for exactly 19 minutes and they came out perfect. I took them to my EMT class and everybody raved about them. This is definitely a keeper!

The one tip I want to share is that I substituted 2-3 tablespoons of milk for the egg in the cookie dough recipe. I made these for our Daisy troop and I didn't want any parents worrying about the egg not being completely cooked. I was a little skeptical with the amount of water called for since my batter had the consistency of soup. (My mix was two ounces shy of the recipe amount.) However, it wasn't a problem. Fabulous recipe.

I followed this recipe to a T and don't know where I could have gone wrong.  I actually don't even really think I did anything wrong.  I just did not like this recipe, at all.  They tasted very blah to me and I might as well have just mixed chocolate chips into the cupcake batter vs. going through the hassle of making the "cookie dough", freezing it, and then dropping it in the center.  I was really excited for this recipe and I was really, really disappointed.

Works great with the cookie dough you buy in a tube or tub.  Soften it up a bit, scoop it out into little balls and save time!  Delicious!

I've tried making these and I find they come out best if I make and freeze the cookie dough balls overnight.  I frost the cupcakes with by mixing chocolate frosting and marshmallow fluff together.

Ever since I found this recipe I've been dying to make it, and today I finally did. I froze the cookie dough overnight and ended up baking for only 17 minutes. Ended up with only 19 cupcakes, but that was my fault, put a little too much batter in the pan. After letting them cool for about 15 minutes I decided to try one and they were delicious. The cupcake was nice and moist and the cookie inside was soft, goeey, chocolatey deliciousness. Great recipe!

I LOVE cookie dough & cupcakes so I was excited to try these!!
I tried them twice. The first time I don't think I can give this recipe a true rating because I didn't have butter so I used margarine and the cookie dough was still a little soft after being in the freezer.  As many others suggested the dough should be very frozen but I decided to try them anyways. I wasn't expecting too much since I knew the cookie dough wasn't frozen/hard as it should have been.  I ended up with a chocolate chip centre - the cookie dough had disappeared. Lol I topped them with a chocolate buttercream and everyone enjoyed them (I only served the 2nd batch that I had cooked for only 15 mins....I found the first batch to be on the dry side)...I was disappointed with the results but that probably came from knowing there should have been cookie dough in the centre not just chocolate chips.
I was determined & thought I would try them again...following the recipe exactly this time.  They still didn't turn out to be dough in the centre as I had hoped! This time you could see the "cookie dough ball" but I expected it to still be dough-like in the centre so for me the centre seemed overcooked.  I even tried cooking the 2nd batch for less time (15-18 minutes). I still served them all & they were gone right away.  Everyone liked them...I just wish the centre came out more dough-like. For me they were a 3 but since everyone I served them to seemed to like them I'm giving a 4!

This was exetremely good! I made this for my friends and they loved them. I will definitely be making them again. The only thing I changed was I did not add baking soda or eggs to the cookie dough, but instead added water so that there was no raw eggs in it.

These are so yummy and fun!!! What a great way to turn a boring cupcake into something full of deliciousness and fun to talk about! The dough did cook a little bit, not a lot but just a little.  I was hoping it would be completely raw. I had the cupcakes ready to go in the oven before I took the cookie balls out of the freezer, so I know that wasn't the issue. I think I will make the cookie balls even bigger and see if that stops them from cooking.  Either way, they were so incredibly good!  Oh, and I made them for Valentine's Day and used red velvet boxed cake mix.  I made homemade butter cream frosting and tinted it pink.  They look great...all the kids at my daughters Valentines party just loved them!

These were super good but the egg in the cookie dough kinda threw me. I have made cookie dough for my kids a hundred times and it doesn't call for egg because they eat it raw. When you freeze the cookie ball it really doesn't "cook"-mine cupcake wasn't cold in the middle but I was questioning if it hit the temp it should have-it was not hot in the middle but all else was cooked. I think i will not use the egg and see what it does to the consistency next time...super delicious though..

These cupcakes are truly amazing!  My family and I are gluten and dairy free and the recipe held up perfectly when the Gluten free and dairy free things were substituted!  The best cupcake I've ever had- by a long shot!  To make GF- I used a GF flour blend for the dough.  And for the cake mix- I used Betty Crockers GF yellow cake mix. I also used only 1 cup of water instead of 1 1/3 cup.  Thanks for the recipe!  It's a keeper!

I loved this recipe! I did make one adjustment to the recipe, I am pregnant and trying to avoid raw eggs, and so i substituted 3 TBPS of water and 1 TBPS of cornstarch for the egg. Alternatively, I have made a chocolate chip cookie dough recipe off of all recipes for cookie dough truffles, and I think that would work well too. Thanks for the delicious recipe!

I have been putting off making these since it is a two-step recipe but I am pleased how easy this was to make. My family really liked it and my son is a 'raw-cough dough' lover!   I also followed Blondeprincess suggestions when I made these! I used a simple chocolate buttercream to ice these.  I will make these again--the cookie dough was perfect without the eggs and I added a TBS of cocoa powder to the batter (since hubby doesn't like anything but chocolate!) It is a recipe you HAVE to try there is nothing hard about this unless you can't follow a recipe! I really don't understand how people are critical of a recipe when the recipe isn't followed. Learn what you did wrong before being critical of the recipe--not THAT many people can like a bad recipe :D

Everyone liked these cupcakes.  I have a 23 year old son who acts like 2 when it comes to cupcakes.  I followed the recipe as written, and only baked the cupcakes for 18 minutes and they tasted very good.  The middle was a nice surprise when you don't know about the gooey cookie.  I will try this recipe again with different flavors.

I made this recipe and loved it! I let the cookie dough stay in the freezer overnight and used regular sized chocolate chips instead of minis. The cupcakes were delicious though. I think I might try to alter it next time by using peanut butter cookie dough inside chocolate cupcakes!

Everyone in my family LOVED these cupcakes.  I used chocolate cake mix and toll house cookie dough.  SO yummy that we didn't even use icing. Will definitely make these again!

I didn't use the recipe for the cookie dough.  I used an eggless cookie dough.  However, I am giving this 5 stars because it was such a fabulous idea and well directed.  These were a huge hit at my daughters party.

I made these gluten free with Bob's Red Mill baking mix and garbanzo bean flour and they were pretty good! I baked them a little too long, but that was my own fault. I will have to experiment with them a little more to get them just right.

One of my favorite and quick cupcake recipes. I bake for 16 minutes and I turn the muffin tins around for even baking at the 8 minute mark. I like to use the Nestle's minis chocolate chip break apart cookies to save time. I also freeze them overnight. I prefer yellow cake but I have also used devils food and red velvet cake mixes.

I make these all the time and they're always a hit! I even use Tollhouse cookie dough (I purchase the tub) and freeze it for a couple of hours before using (as stated, that step is very important so that the cookie dough doesn't fully bake inside the cupcakes).

These were the BEST cupcakes I have ever had.  I made them last night for my sons birthday party.  The kids raved about them and even went home and said "Jesse's mom made the best cupcakes ever!"  Wow did I feel good.  The cookie dough was amazing and cooked perfectly.  I made sure not to overbake.  16 minutes was perfect for them.  The cookie dough remained just that, cookie dough.  I paired it with allrecipes buttercream frosting and it was amazing.

I've made these as mini cupcakes and people seem to love them.  The one thing I do now is just "float" the cookie dough on the top before I put the cupcakes in the oven otherwise the cookie dough tends to sink to the bottom and sticks to the paper when people try to remove it from the cupcake

Amazing!! Family and friends all agreed it was the best cupcake that they had ever had! I frosted with a butter icing and the flavors all complemented each other very well. It is best to freeze cookie dough overnight because it was the perfect consistency when the cupcakes were done. I have already had requests for another batch. Thanks for the recipe!

I haven't made these yet, but plan to!!  The reason I'm rating this recipe in advance is simply to share a no-egg cookie dough recipe for those who are worried about it.  The recipe is Frozen Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Balls posted by KateLou26.

I decided to make cupcakes for my favorite college class and I brought in a number of recipes for my friends to vote on to try, this won by a landslide. I followed the recipes instructions except that I used regular chocolate chips instead of mini ones. They were amazing and I recieved so many compliments. I'm making these again for a cookout next week, I may use the premade cookiedough just as a timesaver as someone suggested but I highly recommend this recipe!

These were OK but not as good as I expected them to be. Like another reviewer said it kind of just tasted like there was chocolate chips in the middle. Next time I will use 1/2 cup mini chips and put 1 1/2 teaspoon fulls of cookie dough in the middle. I also baked the left over cookie dough balls into mini cookies and put them on top of the cupcakes.

This was good. Although I have to disagree, and say that we preferred the "second best cupcake" which has brownie batter in it. I found that it was hard to tell when the cake was done. However, it WAS good and it is definitely worth trying. I used Chocolate Marshmallow frosting from this site, which I think helped to make this cupcake. Given the choice again, I think I will make the brownie recipe over this one.

I made these for a birthday party and they were a huge hit!  The only thing I did differently was use butterscotch chips instead of chocolate chips.  I baked for 16 minutes and they turned out perfectly.  The cookie part was wonderfully gooey!  I used the Buttercream II frosting recipe from this website.  Sort of time consuming for cupcakes,but worth it for special occasions.

Very good. I used less chocolate chips and made teaspoon sized balls. Bigger next time, I think would be better. I also added 8 oz cream cheese to the chocolate icing and whipped it. Very good recipe!!

taste great, but look terrible. I have made these 4 times now and I cant seem to get the cupcakes to stay raised. they look fabulous coming out of the oven, but then when cooled they are sunken in the center. My kids love them, so I wikll contiue to make them, but if your going for apperence, don't start here :)

These cupcakes are wonderful? The only thing I can add is, I was baking a double batch so I used every muffin pan I had one of which was a silicone style pan. Those cupcakes didn't bake as well as the traditional pan. Even though I did them exactly like the others they were just not nearly as good. Texture was off and even when I baked a bit longer they were just not right.

I made these for my family and everyone LOVED them.  I used Devil's food Cake and Chocolate Buttercream frosting. I do think that I'm doing something wrong.  The cookie is barely cooked when I pull the cupcakes out and they sink in the middle.

I made this last night/this morning, and it is delicious. I don't know why people say this is dry, mine certainly weren't. They were very moist and fluffy. I paired this with the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe found here as well, and I enjoy the combo. I could easily add cocoa powder to the frosting to make some chocolate frosting too. Will definitely be making this again!

Make sure to watch them closely while they cook. If the cookie dough overcooks just a tad they lose some of the moisture. Overall Delicious!

I cooked these longer than the 16 minutes suggested, I cooked them for 19 minutes. They've been sitting out four ten and they're still gooey wobbly messes sitting inside muffin cups. Not impressed.

These are really good.  Next time I would bake them a minute or so less, but topped with chocolate frosting they are pretty addictive.

Bf requested decorated cupcakes for his bday, and I thought he'd like these (he loves cookie dough) so I thought I'd finally try them for him.  I made the cookie dough about a week ago, using my medium cookie scoop to scoop the dough.  I ended up with about 21 scoops that way, and I used pastuerized eggs so as not to worry about raw egg in the recipe.  I made a half batch of cupcakes since it's just the two of us, but bf has already eaten his way through half the cupcakes, and I made them yesterday!  Following LTH's instructions worked perfectly for me . . .the cookie dough was perfect and the cupcakes were dry.  I tested both the sides and middle of the cupcake (don't put the toothpick very far in) before pulling them out, and 18 mins worked well in my oven.  I also let the cupcakes cool upside down on the cookie rack so they wouldn't fall, but I don't think they would've anyway.  I decorated with Cream Cheese Frosting from here, which went very well with it, and leftover storebought frosting.  Bf loves these cupcakes and said I had to make them again.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were amazing, and lived up to all of the positive reviews. I was skeptical when I first saw this recipe... but my boyfriend requested them for his birthday, so what could I do? 

I made the cookie dough exactly as stated. However, the box cake mix I bought was 15.something oz instead of the 18.25oz that the recipe specified, so I just made the cake according to the direction on the box since the measurements were a bit different. 

I tried to use up all the cookie dough to make the balls as big as possible - this paid off in a really nice big gooey center. I froze them overnight and half a day. 

When everything was ready, I plopped the cookie dough on top of the cake mix and pressed it in just gently. 

The result was almost perfect. A couple cupcakes had a little dough sticking out the top. A couple had caved just slightly in the center, leaving a small air pocket. Neither affected the deliciousness. 

I highly recommend trying this recipe! Thank you to the submitter. :)

These were delicious! Nailed them on the first time baking them (I'm quite proud). I only have one 12 cup baking tin for cupcakes, and I had exactly enough for 2 trays full. The first tray had to bake only for about 15 minutes, but the second was still wet at that time so I left them in for another five (not sure why this happened, by they all turned out the same in the end...!). I actually ended up using regular chips because those are what I had on hand, but I will try mini ones next time because I think they would be better. I also might put in a little more than a cup, because the cup of regular ones didn't seem like enough. 

So these were incredible! Very rich and delicious, AND gone in a flash; I'll be (at least) doubling the recipe next time too! I'll try to get a picture of mine up soon, because I was kind of proud...! :D

This recipe was wonderful! I was curious about how this combination would taste (hoping it wouldn't be too bad) and I ended up being pleasantly surprised. They were so delicious that I finally registered on this site so I could rate the recipe (I've been looking at this site for ~5yrs). I had absolutely no issues with the cookie dough being dry. The only thing I did differently was substitute 2 Tbl of milk for the egg in the cookie dough recipe. Thanks LTH for a wonderful and unique recipe!

I have a lot of super yummy cookies recipes and tried several of them with this cupcake, including the cookie dough recipe she has listed.  I HIGHLY recommend forgoing the homemade cookie dough and using the premade cookie dough that you buy.  You need the dough to be SUPER hard for this recipe, and homemade dough doesn't cut it no matter how high you set your freezer.  The premade dough comes out perfect!

These were really yummy and pretty easy to make.  I used my own cookie dough recipe for the center and froze them for about 4 hours and they came out perfect.  I would definitely recommend not cooking much more than the recommended time because any longer and I think the dough would have started to cook through more.  I made them with the chocolate hazelnut frosting recipe on allrecipes and they were a big hit.  Thanks for this recipe!

I used the golden butter recipe cake mix for this, didn't freeze the cookie dough overnight, just for about 45 minutes in the cupcake pan... turned out perfect, no raw dough, not dry.  I think the cupcakes with the brownie batter are the best cupcake ever, this one; second best :)

They tasted alright I had frozen the dough for two days but I found that it still baked slightly, I also found that the cupcake mix did not bake as well on top and that made my cupcakes appear sweaty and raw. Maybe I did something wrong but I followed to recipe perfectly....Ill try again soon

These cupcakes came out perfect and my whole family loved them!  This is a wonderful recipe that I will definately be using again and again.  Only change from the original recipe was baking the cupcakes for only about 16 minutes and I reduced the water to 1 cup, only because that was all my boxed mix called for (maybe other brands call for 1 1/3 c?), and I substitued 2 tablespoons of milk for the egg.  If you are skeptical of how these will turn out, go ahead and try it.  I am a novice baker and mine came out beautifully!

These were definitely not as good as I expected them to be. Usually I poopoo at negative reviews when so many are positive, but I didn't have a good experience with these. There was no discernable cookie dough in the middle. I followed directions to a T. Better luck next time? Perhaps precision is key here!

The baking time is the key, so don't go over the 18 minutes. I used marble cake mix rather than yellow and I used the refrigerated cookie dough. They came out perfect and everyone loved them! Thanks for this recipe!!

The cookie dough never completely froze, so the cupcake had a slightly more baked cookie in the center than anticipated.  But they were still delicious!  It was a pleasant surprise in the middle for everyone who tried them.

The cupcake was very good! As the other reviewers have stated this only yields 24 cupcakes not the 48 as it states. I used Moist Yellow Cake Mix as that was all I had on hand. I also didnt have mini chocolare chips so i chopped some regular sized chocolate chips in the food processor. I will be making these again! Thanks for sharing!

I made these with homemade yellow cake batter (I used the yellow cake recipe from The Cake Bible), frosted them with whipped milk chocolate ganache, and topped them with crispy, chewy, mini chocolate chip cookies.  They were unbelieveable!

I made a triple batch for a bridal shower and there wasn't a single one left. I made the cookie dough balls a few days ahead and kept them frozen. I also made them a bit bigger hoping that they wouldn't melt into the mix. They came out perfect. I think you really need to make sure they are totally frozen and don't over cook the cupcakes.

I made these cupcakes for my family's Easter dinner. I followed the recipe exactly. I used white cake mix and chocolate whipped frosting. I froze the cookie dough for several hours. They came out perfect! Thanks for such a neat idea for cupcakes.

So tasty! I usually love cupcakes when they are fresh and warm, but these cupcakes taste so much better when cooled! I loved the taste of the cookie dough - what a surprise for my guests! Well loved and easy to make.

Such an awesome idea.  I'm living in the dorms at my college so I just bought the ready made cookie dough from the market since it is cheaper and it turned out really well.  Everyone loves them and can't get enough!

I am going to give you the rating that I got from my 7 year old son and his class gave. He took these to school for his birthday and said that everyone loved them. I do think it is a great kids recipe. I wouldn't say they are my personal fav cupcake recipe but they might very well be the kids fav and since most often the cupcakes I make are for the kids..,well I figured that makes them a 5 star.

These are INCREDIBLE! I followed the recipe exactly, including the tips the original recipe poster included in their later review. I kept the dough in the freezer for 2 hours, then baked the cupcakes for 18 minutes and they came out super moist and delicious. Everyone at my house LOVED them! I will definitely be keeping this recipe handy!

If you love cookie dough, you will adore this recipe!  I'm not a huge fan of cookie dough, but I still thought it tasted delicious and the concept alone is brilliant.  I cooked my cupcakes for 18 minutes and the outside edges of the cupcake were perfectly done, but the middle top of the cupcake was still a little runny underneath.  I freaked out a little when I saw this, but I think that's just how this cupcake works.  Wait for it to cool, top with frosting and it'll be (and taste) great!

To tell the truth, I wasn't too impressed with this recipe. Maybe it's because half of it was from a box. I know that box taste by heart. The dough is a nice surprise for people who aren't expecting it; however, I think it would fare better with a homemade cake batter. I'm giving it a 3 and not lower because there also wasn't anything wrong with this recipe...so as long as you don't bake the dough as if they were regular cookies! :D I tried that; it didn't have a very good texture. I'll try to find a homemade [cup]cake recipe that matches with cookie dough.

Wonderfl, wonderful wonderful,  I have33 tried with 3 different flavors,  Yum.  I mlike the smaller chips, the kids and hubby like the larger chips.  Whatever they are good anyway.  I also made these with the redvelved cupcake recipe and did the cookie part.  That was the absolute very very best.  Thanks for the great idea.  The cupcakes are limitless.

When I read all the other reviews I immediately knew: I HAVE TO BAKE THIS. Cookie dough and cupcakes..can you think of a better combo? When I baked it I noticed after 18 minutes the batter still wasn't cooked yet, so I cooked them an extra 6 minutes until it was cooked. When I cut it in half, I noticed the cookie wasn't doughy, but more 'cupcakey' but still very delicious! I think it's an oven problem because I read the reviews warning me not to overcook. Disappointed they didn't turn out doughy, but they were still VERY tasty! Will try again :)

I made them with vanilla cake mix and chocolate icing. They were pretty good and certainly got a lot of compliments but they weren't my favorite.

I made these for my daughter's bake sale and they were a huge hit.   Better than plain chocolate cupcakes.  I didn't even frost them (since I ran out of time) and they were still great!

I'm making these today for my son to take to school to celebrate his birthday tomorrow.  I've made them several times before and they are always a hit!  I use a chocolate ganache for the frosting - very rich, but so yummy!

These were awesome! I made them for a superbowl party this weekend, and followed all instructions exactly except I used chocolate fudge cake mix instead of yellow. They were a huge hit and everyone raved about them! I baked them for 22 mins and probably should have taken them out at 20 like the other reviews say, but they were still fabulous! I topped them with fluffy peanut butter frosting (recipe from this site).

My cookie dough cooked the first time too! But then I figured out what I did wrong. It has to be a large scoop of cookie dough.  When I first made them I thought the cookie dough scoop was too large for the cupcake so I cut it in half.  Result, cookie dough cooked with cupcake.  Then next time I used the whole large frozen scoop of cookie dough and it came out perfect.  So if your cookie dough is cooking maybe you need a larger scoop of dough. Then bake as little time as possible.  Also, the middle of the cupcake was a little doughy still on some so I scooped out the doughy cupcake and filled with frosting.  Everyone seemed to like that.  Good Luck

The cupcakes turned out okay, but you couldn't really taste the cookie dough that much. I also didn't like using the box cake mix, so I made my own cake mix and used that. Overall, they were okay, but I think I would be better off with regular cupcakes.

I was looking forward to trying these, but was sadly let down by the overall flavor. I followed this recipe exactly, and I think it was ruined by the yellow cake mix. The cupcake tasted as if it came from a cheap grocery store bakery and the cookie dough middle was anticlimactic. Nevertheless, the cookie dough was excellent on its own! Bottom line, I would not give these cupcakes to a friend, and definitely wouldn't make again for myself - too much effort for cheap tasting cupcakes.

These cupcakes were amazing. I am so glad that I made them. And everyone loved them too! I've eaten one every day for breakfast, I'm quite sad that they'll be gone soon.   But, if you follow the recipe exactly and don't make any changes, you will get the results you're hoping for. I freezed the dough for three hours, and topped the cupcakes with the creamy chocolate frosting on this site. This recipe is a winner!

AMAZING! I may have made my dough balls too big because some of them didn't get covered with the batter while baking, but that was my own fault. Even if that happens to you, just use the icing to cover the caved in part on top. Most of them turned out fine and I had tons of rave reviews and requests for more. Will definitely be making again! Thanks so much for this recipe! :)

These were good.  My dough also was dry even though it didn't appear cooked and I only left them in for 18 minutes.  I don't think I'd make them again even though other people seemed to like them.  I will say they were best with frosting and that the yellow cake mix version was way better than the chocolate cake mix version (and I'm a total chocolate lover).

Disappointing:( I was surprised that these didn't taste well for me considering all the great reviews:(  I followed the recipe exactly as shown and my cupcakes were pretty bland.  I wouldn't make these again. It sounded like a great concept but for the amount of work and the final product it wasn't worth the effort.   The final product was bland, perhaps the cake mix should be chocolate or cake should be homemade and not boxed?  Anyways I gave it 2 stars because it was edible but not very tasty. I didn't frost them and don't feel that the frosting would save them.

These were definately good! Next time (if time allows) I may suggest making a homemade cake instead of the mix. Although boyfriend loved them..I still found the box cake taste. The center is by scratch so you may want to consider it. Thank you for the great idea!! :)

The first time I made these I don't think my dough was solid enough and they came out dry.  The next time I made sure to put the dough straight into the batter and hot oven.  Some one actually said "this is the best cupcake ever"! They turned out great. I used store bought cookie dough with recees peanut butter cup and used chocolate cake mix.  Delicious!

Outstanding. I cheated and just bought pre-made cookie dough, cut the squares in half, and froze them before baking. I took care not to overcook the cupcakes as my oven does run a little hotter than others. I don't always use paper liners for my cupcakes, but this time it would have helped immensely as some of the dough sank to the bottom and left a large pile of goo still stuck to the bottom of the pan... which I was more than happy to put in the "reject" pile for my personal consumption.

Liked this recipe very easy if you use all pre-made stuff, like I did.  Boxed mix, can frosting, break n' bake cookie dough.  Didn't win the cupcake war we had at work, but it's yum!

I made this recipe to take to work and everyone thought it was really good.  I didn't want to make cupcakes so I used my 9x13.  I lined the pan with aluminum foil letting it hang over the edges.  I spread the cookie dough on the foil and froze it.  I poured the cake batter in the pan, used the foil to lift cookie dough out and peeled it off.  I layed the cookie dough on top of the batter and gently pushed it into the cake batter a little.   Baked it about 5 mins less. then directed on the box.  Came out excellant. Topped with whip cream frosting, crushed cookies, and a drizzle of chocolate syrup.

Only change I made was to use a butter cake mix instead of a yellow cake mix because that's what I had in the pantry. They turned out very moist and the cookie dough in the middle is a yummy surprise. Thanks for sharing.

Awesome, Awesome, Awesome!   Definitely cook them less than the recommended time and they will turn out great.  Also, the chocolate version is a little more moist than the vanilla but both are great!

I might have made the cookie dough balls too big, and although they were tablespoon sized ALL of them were poking out the top after baking and blended in with the texture of the cupcake.  This cupcake did not wow me, but I'll have to try again making the cookie balls smaller and further down in the batter.

These are the BOMB!  When I first read the recipe it screamed chocolate cake to me, so that's what I used.  I also totally cheated and used store bought cookie dough (I was pressed for time). I frosted half with chocolate frosting and the other half with an Irish Creme frosting.  Very big hit!  Wondering about chocolate cake and peanut butter cookie dough---hmmm.

I loved these. I made a test batch today (for my sons 1st birthday party) with the cookie dough for ice cream from this site because it was egg-free and both my husband and I couldn't get over how yummy these were! I will try your cookie dough recipe (minus the egss) next time and see how that turns out. I can't wait to serve these at his birthday party, thanks for sharing!

They were OK, but not AWESOME!!  I thought that I might as well have just put choc. chips in the cupcake batter rather than do the extra step of the cookie dough because I couldn't taste the cookie dough.

Two Thumbs Up!!.  My daughter had requested a cookie dough cake for her 20th bday.  After looking everywhere.......I was sent to this recipe and boy was it a winner.  I used a Devils Food cake mix and choc. chip cookie dough center with homemade white frosting and my daughter couldn't stop eating them.  Thanks for making me the best Mom in the world for fulfilling my daughters request!

Followed all directions including the freezing of the dough first. Cupcakes came out concave where the dough had shifted and left a hole. Taste was so, so and I LOVE cookie dough. Wouldn't bother.

amazing!!!  remember to push the cookie dough down into the cupcake mixture before baking so you don't get the sunken effect.  Used buttercream frosting with mini chocolate chips.

Oh yeah! These are good! Wasnt going to have a lot of time, so I got the nestle break apart cookies, and froze them for 2 hours. This recipe was so incredible easy to make, my 12 year old daughter did most of it. These will most definately be made again.

so good! was a hit with the family at our 4th of july gathering - my nephew told me these are now mandatory at every family function.  I used the Milky Way frosting on this site - very rich cupcake and frosting but so good and even better with a cold glass of milk!!

My grandkids LOVED these!! I used devils food cake mix with white buttercream frosting.  I thought they were good - a bit rich for me - and not being a cookie dough lover - I still liked them! My mom always said cookie dough would give you worms :)  Aren't we supposed to believe everything our mothers tell us!!?   Thanks for the recipe - I'm sure I'll be asked to make them again!

Everybody loves these when I make them. It's easy to varythe recipe too. I like the best with chocolate cake, chunky chocolate chip cookie dough, and cream cheese icing! Very easy recipe and great for kids to get involved. Make sure the cookie dough balls are frozen solid - I leave a stash in the deep freeze and take them out as needed.

These are fantastic!  I made the cookie dough as the recipe directed except substituted regular chocolate chips for the mini ones.  After 18 mins. in my oven the cupcakes were a little underdone, but at 21 mins. they were perfect.  Great recipe!

Don't make these unless you have a way of getting rid of them quickly, otherwise these evil, devil cupcakes will be calling you to eat them every two hours.. they are really delicious! I'm surprised just how good they  are. Dangerous!  I just used the (frozen solid) break & bake cookies with some homemade buttercream... ooooooh man....  even my anti-sweet tooth husband said he could eat one of these everyday for the rest of his life.. LOLOLOL...

These are dangerously delicious!! I say dangerously because I doubt you can just eat one!! I decided to use a Betty Crocker Devil's Food Chocolate cake mix, and followed the cookie dough instructions (except I just used regular salt, and margarine instead of butter). I used the Chocolate Fudge Buttercream icing that I found on this site and it was an excellent "death by chocolate" experience!  They were really easy to make, and I will be making them again very soon! Thanks for sharing!

I made these for a work bake sale last year and everyone LOVED them. I've since made them a few times, just using boxed cake mix and pre-made cookie dough. One thing I've thought was strange, the last couple times I've made them the cupcake tops have sunken in. I don't know why. I'm sorry I don't really want to read through all 396 reviews...they still taste awesome, just seems strange to me. I am in high altitude, but like I said it's just been the last couple times that it's happened...but overall love love love them! and it's fun to use different cake mixes, haven't found a bad combo yet of cupcake, cookie, and frosting.

I gave this recipe four stars because it calls for a boxed cake mix and it would not be good with a mix.  Besides that, it is a good idea and the cookie dough is a good recipe.

What a different take on a cupcake!  I cheated a bit and bought the pre-made cookies that were already cut and everything!  I just threw the package in the freezer and they worked perfectly.  And as usual, I used cupcake liners!  For $0.88 for a package of about 100 they are well worth the money!

I asked my niece what her favorite dessert was and she said "Funfetti" cupcakes (white cake with sprinkles in the mix) and chocolate chip cookies.  So I typed in "cupcake, cookies" in the recipe search area and these came up.  So I made them for her 10th birthday.  I did everything according to the recipe except I used the funfetti cake mix instead of yellow.  SO FAB!!!  My niece got in trouble for sneaking more after her mom told her she couldn't have anymore cupcakes that day.  Everybody loved them.  And they were great the next day too, both refrigerated and left out.  Thanks for the perfect birthday dessert idea! :)

Excellent recipe!  I used boxed Devil's Food and topped with buttercream icing and it was very rich and moist.  However, make sure to watch the cooking time.  The first batch looked undercooked at 20 minutes, but I went ahead and pulled them out and let them sit.  I was glad I did, they settled almost perfectly.  The second batch I baked for only 15 minutes and they turned out even better.  I can't wait to make these again, they are so very good.

These are awesome.  I loved watching everyone's face as they bit into one and got a delicious treat.  They're a little time consuming due to the freezing of the dough but they are totally worth it if you have the time.

OMG these were out of this WORLD! I used the pre-made Pillsbury chocolate cookie dough in a tube. I took a tbsp measure and made balls then froze them overnight.  I also used marble cake mix instead of yellow  For frosting I used Pillsbury Easy Frost Vanilla and garnished them with mini chocolate chips.  I cooked them for exactly 18 minutes. 2 of the 24 came out slightly burned on the bottom, but they weren't too bad and the rest were perfect! These are the best cupcakes ever and I've spread the recipe all over the place!

Super simple recipe! I used store-bought cookie dough from Papa Murphys Pizza instead of making it homemade. Baked for the required amount of time, however, the cookie ended up fully baking instead of holding the 'cookie dough' consistency. No worries, it still tastes great anyway, and safe for all the pregnant co-workers at my office! Love this recipe for its simplicity!

These cupcakes are delicious!!! I was a bit of a slacker and combined cake mix with frozen pilsbery chocolate chip cookie dough. They still turned out awesome and I will be making these again! Thanks   : )

Fantabulous.  Also great with chocolate cake mix, but it does not work with brownie mix.  Baking for 16 (or 17) minutes works well - you'll think it's underdone, but it's not.  Really good also with vanilla icing.  It helps if, after the dough is frozen, to reshape them into actual balls and put back in the freezer for a bit.  I also refrigerated mine after baking.  I don't know if it's necessary, but it just seemed right to get it to congeal and be more cookie-dough like.  Great recipe!

YUM! I only gave these 4 stars because it wasn't quite as "cookie dough" as I thought it was going to be.  They were doughy in the middle, but you really couldn't tell what you were eating.  But, they were delish and EASY! I used the break and bake cookie dough from the store and used chocolate cake mix for a more noticeable color change and then frosted with chocolate frosting.

OMG, these are sooo good!  I made these for my husband's "bake-off" @ work.  I won :)  I heeded the suggestions and made sure not to over bake.  16 minutes in my oven. Thanks for this great recipe!

These were decent...I would say to definitely frost or top them with something. Also they just taste like they are from the box...use generous amount of cookie dough and make sure to freeze the dough for a LONG time. Otherwise, you will just have a cookie in your cupcake which is NOT delicious.

Out of the oven, or within the day made, these are heavenly. But i found that a day later, the dough is no longer gooey, and so they just become a cupcake with some chocolate chipe in the middle. That being said, I would make them again for something special,, when I know they will be eaten immediately.

These were so GOOD! I did have a small issue with the cookie dough, but I live at a high altitude and have issues with Chocolate Chip Cookies! But they still tasted great (just didn't rise up)! Next time I think I'll use my tried-and-true recipe for the cookie! I also made these a second time with devils food cake and my peanut butter cookie recipe! Thanks for a great and versitle recipe! My family LOVES them! I was eating them breakfast *grin*

I will confess to being something of a cake snob.  I never use cake mixes, but today I really wanted to try these cupcakes out and I needed a quick Halloween goodie for a party.  I used a chocolate cake mix and refrigerated cookie dough, which happened to be chocolate chunk with peanut butter cups.  Delicious!  Only froze the dough about 30 mins.  It didn't sink to the bottom like in many of the photos, but it also did not melt into the cake so it worked fine.  Topped them with vanilla buttercream, and was genuinely surprised at the awesome results!  Seriously, people will think you are a genius.  No issues with dryness.  For the cookie dough, white chocolate & macadamia nut would be a nice combo as well.  Very nice recipe, and I can't wait to try it with cake from scratch! :-)  Thanks, LTH!

Just another glowing review.  I usually bake these for about 11 minutes and they've turned out fine.  My cookie dough balls look a little bigger then what's seen in the picture.  Thanks for the recipe.

These are THE BEST cupcakes ever!!  I baked them twice and I don't know if it was my old oven, but I did have to bake them for 20 minutes otherwise the center of the cupcake caved in (though they tasted abosolutely delicious!).  Everytime I've made them I used the fluffy peanut butter frosting on this website and everyone raved about how much they tasted like Reese's Peanut Butter cups!  I'll have a hard time making cupcakes any other way now!!

These turned out amazing! I followed all the tips and froze the cookie dough until it was as hard as a rock! I used my favorite cookie recipe from this site called best big fat chewy choc. chip cookies (it is amazing). Then I dipped the tops in ganache, drizzled with melted marshmallow creme, and then added just a bit of choc frosting to top it off. They are super rich and sinful and worth every bite!

OMG...I am a college student and made a batch of these yesterday. I used a devil's food cake mix and regular chocolate chips. They were AMAZING. My roommates all said they were the best cupcakes they'd ever had! I baked them for 16 min. and the cookie dough and chips were nice and gooey! My favorite Allrecipes recipe so far!

These were OK.  I used pre-made Nestle toll house cookie dough and used a small cookie scoop for uniform size.  Froze the scooped dough for about a half hour (may do it for an hour next time).  I frosted the cupcakes with chocolate buttercream frosting but this made them too sweet - I think they're better unfrosted.  DH wasn't impressed and I just felt they were OK.

This recipe was AWESOME!  I didn't change a thing followed the directions to a T.  I have made them twice now and both batches came out wonderful.  I have made it with chocolate & white cake mixes.  I have had many testers including myself and still not sure if white or chocolate cake is better must make it each way again to decide.  Try this one you won't be sorry!

Maybe it's just a matter or taste, but, for us..these were good, but, not great.  Great idea..but, we just prefer a regular cupcake or a cream filled cupcake.  I could definitely see kids loving them though.

Wow! So good. These are great cold. Made the mistake of immediately putting them in the fridge after the oven so the cake wasn't cooked all the way but it was fine after rebaking it. You've got to have a big sweet tooth for these, so not for everyone.

I tried 3 rounds of baking to try and end up with cookie dough unbaked but regardless, if I cooked the cupcake enough, the cookie was melted.  I used frozen dough balls.  I suppose if I could get this to turn out right, I might up the stars but it's not worth the trouble to me to keep trying.

I was looking for a gooey cookie dough center; I cooked these for the recommended 16 minutes, the cookie dough had started to cook.   They were good, but not gooey.  I will try again & cook a minute or 2 longer.

The cookie dough center made the cupcake a bit too sweet for my tastes. I don't think it's worth the hassle of making the cookie dough.

First off I am a huge cookie dough fanatic so when I saw this recipe I knew I had to try it. I made the recipe as directed and the result was WONDERFUL. This is definitely now one of my favorite dessert recipes. Just make sure to let the cookie dough completely freeze before you bake. When the middle is wet and the edges are golden brown, the cupcake is done. Don't over bake!

These are very good - family LOVED them. Cooked exactly as said, but used "cookie dough" frosting(from others): 1 1/4c flour, 1/2tsp baking soda & salt, 1/2c soft butter, 1/2c sugar, 1/4c packed brown, 1/4c milk, 1tsp vanilla - blend butter/sugar, add liquids, then dry. stir in 1c mini chips & frost!!   DELISH!! ;o)  Update: I just made these again - when the sides of the cupcake look like they're drying and the middle still looks wet, they're probably done. DO NOT OVER COOK!

Excellent!  I used a reduced sugar Devils Food Cake mix, pre made choc chip cookies, and reduced sugar choc fudge frosting.  For a family get together - went over extremely well and no leftovers!  So easy using the premade stuff!  Next time will use the PB cup cookies!

Yummy!.. I really wanted to use up some Pillsbury cookie dough I'd purchased at our dollar store; it was Cinnabon sugar cookie flavored.  I used yellow cake mix and baked for 22 minutes.  The middle wasn't super gooey but I was happy with it!..  A bit too sweet for me but the kids ate them; I'd also make the dough part smaller inside next time since I'd like more cake.

Wow. We made 2 batches. In one batch, baked for 16 minutes, the cupcakes were a little sunken in in the middle. I baked the second batch for a minute longer, and those looked better on top--like normal rounded cupcakes. Upon tasting, however, the sunken in cupcakes were ooey and gooey and delicious. In the "prettier" batch, the cookie dough seemed like it had started to bake a little bit. My family was split on which one was better, so they were both delicious, but a minute of cooking time definitely makes a difference.

These were great. I cooked for 16 minutes. DO NOT push cookie dough down into the batter like I did, it was too close to the bottom and cooked just a little. Just plop it on top.

Everyone loved these.  I used a chocolate fudge cake mix and chocolate frosting on top.  I froze the cookie dough overnight and baked the cupcakes for 18 minutes.

This is a great recipe thats success lies mostly in the cooking time.  I would highly reccomend test baking one cupcake before an entire batch.  Fill the other empty muffin cups at least half full with water .  Another thing that helped me keep my dough soft in the center was that I put my dough balls in the deep freeze (about 24 hrs.)  until they were rock solid.  If you don't have a deep freeze, keep them in your regular feezer until rock hard, otherwise your center could completely cook like mine on my first attempt.  These are truly amazing and delicious!  One more side note is that I have also tried making these into mini-cupcakes, and could not quite get the dough in the center from over-baking.  I will try again.

I wanted so badly to love these. I made them for my little ones 4th bday at day care.  I cooked 20 minutes as the tops were still very uncooked at 16 minutes.  When they were cool I went to frost and the were crumbly and fell apart. I followed recipe to  a t!  Can anyone email me and give me a hint as to why? I would love to try again.

I let the cookie dough sit in freezer for about 3 hours and then baked everything using a German Choc. cake mix. It was great. For a "frosting" all I had was a package of Dream Whip so I used that. Everyone who tasted them said the were great.

I used a devil's food cake mix for the cupcakes, and replaced the oil with applesauce. I used my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe, only I left out the eggs, personally I think it tasted just as good as when I've eaten dough with the eggs, but better because it is more solid like store bought rather than more sticky like homemade. They turned out great. I did have to cook them for about 19 minutes for the cupcakes to cook all the way through, after freezing the cookie dough for about 4 hours they turned out perfect and the cookie dough didn't cook at all. I've had cupcakes like these from a bakery and I had no they were this easy to make!

What a fun, whimsical cupcake!  I used premade dough to save time.  I bought the "mini" cookie dough, so it was already portioned to perfect size for dropping into the cupcake batter.  Based on earlier reviews, I was very careful to keep a close eye on the cupcakes while baking.  I took them out after 16-17 minutes, and even though they looked slightly underdone, they ended up perfectly done - the cookie dough center was still doughy enough inside.  Delish!  I topped it with a bit of vanilla buttercream, and a teeny-tiny chocolate chip cookie (had to use the extra dough somehow!)... so cute :)

I haven't rated these yet because I am a moron.  I bought the refrigerated dough and used that. (Key word, refrigerated), and no, I forgot to freeze it.  Next time I made them, I cut the dough up (out of the refrigerator) and then froze.  Way better. They're excellent! And yes, the BEST. Thanks LTH!!

This was by far and away the best dessert I have had in a long time.  You definitely have to try the devil's food cake mix and that ganache frosting as suggested by another reviewer, they were phenomenal.  Also make sure you follow the directions, freeze the dough and only bake the cupcakes 16-18 minutes, they were perfectly moist, it was amazing!

We all enjoyed the moist cupcake. It was a great cupcake, but the cookie dough wasn't really gooey tasting. I didn't have a chocolate cake mix, so I used a vanilla one; this made it hard to tell the difference between the cookie dough and the cupcake. It wasn't quite what I thought it would be like, but we all enjoyed them. Thanks!

I had to refrigerate these because I added cream cheese frosting to these. Next time I would keep the frosting separate and add on when eating the cupcakes because the cupcakes do not taste as good refrigerated. I also used one of the chocolate cupcakes recipes instead of a cake mix.

They were very good.  My brother loves them.  I didn't get 2 dozen cupcakes though because i ran out of cookie dough.  Make sure the dough is well frozen when you put it in the cake batter or else they will become like the cake.  I used store bought devil's food cake batter and it was good.  I also added cream cheese frosting.  These have a good taste together.

These were a hit in my Spanish class! Everyone loved them. I thought the actually cake could have been more moist but the cookie made up for it. I frosted them with leftover store bought frosting them too. Great idea!

Everyone who tried one of these cupcakes was pleasantly surprised and raved about them!  They are a little time-consuming, but I think that making your own cookie dough (instead of using store-bought) is worth the extra effort.  Just be sure to plan ahead.

These were one of the best desserts that I have ever made.  The cookie dough in the middle still tasted like cookie dough after it was baked and my friends and family all loved them.  I used another recipe from this site for the cake (One Bowl Chocolate Cake III) and it was so good.  I will make this again with different cookie dough and cake recipes.

Just tried these this afternoon. I read the reviews and the advice before making them, so I was careful to follow the instructions to a "t". Unfortunately they still turned out dry. The cupcakes are still good - very tasty - but dry. I would try baking these for 5 minutes less to see if they turned out a little moister.

YUMMY! I used cake mix and used the easy 'flourless peanut butter cookies' recipe from this site. I don't know why I tortured myself since I am on a diet but I have been dying to try these! They are so stinkin good!! Very worth the calorie cheating!!

Wow, everyone just loved these cupcakes. I did cheat and bought premade cookie dough at the store and now I feel like I'm getting pay backs for doing that since it was on the news today that the cookie dough was being pulled from the shelves. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that no one gets sick. I also used a buttercream frosting from this site. This is a keeper!!

These turned out great!  I had a yellow cake mix and my daughter had left over cookie dough from Macademia Nut Cookies.  I rolled the leftover dough into 21 balls and froze them for 3 hours.  I had no problem with baking them and they turned out perfect.  I will try these again and use different cake mix and cookie dough.

These cupcakes are so delicious. I used Pillsbury Dark Chocolate cake mix. But only fill the cups 1/2 way, and set the cookie dough on top of the cake mix, do not push it down.  Bake for 18-20 min. When you take them out of the oven, let cool in pan for 5 min. and then flip them upside down on a cooling rack. This way they don't get a hole in them like a doughnut, either way they are the BOMB!!!  And you don't even need frosting on these bad boys!!!!!

I loved the idea and mine were pretty good. I used Devils Food cake and my favorite cookie recipe. I froze my cookie dough balls for 7 hrs. but they didn't feel that firm. So, as I expected, the cookie dough wasn't very doughy. It pretty much cooked in the cupcake. I topped them with store bought cream cheese icing. Still very yummy!! I will make again!

These were delightful. I used yellow cake mix and they came out great. I think the flavor of the cookie got lost in it a bit so maybe chocolate cake mix would be even better. Even though, they were still great and I have every intention of making them again. If nothing else, the chocolate chips in the middle made it totally worth it ;)

This was a hit at the office. I used the white cake mix, pre-made chocolate chip cookie dough, and pre-made frosting. It was so easy and so wonderful. I highly recommend this recipe. Many thanks!

This is a genius idea!  I made the cupcake batter from scratch (one bowl chocolate cake from this site) and used refrigerated chocolate chip cookies.  As stated by the submitter, it is vital to freeze the cookie dough and not to overbake!

Served these over the weekend at a cookout to mixed reviews. I used store bought dough to save time, but otherwise followed the recipe. I had high hopes for these but something wasn't quite right, not sure what thought. I may try them again.

These were very good. My coworkers loved them, despite the fact that I made a couple of mistakes. I put less egg in one batch and overcooked the other, but they still turned out wonderfully! Can't wait to try the results when there aren't any operator errors!

Pretty good. A little dry. But still a unique taste to them. Would certainly try them again. Made them with yellow cake mix and fudge icing on top. Followed box's directions for cake mix.

These are pretty fabulous cupcakes.  A little time consuming (waiting for the cookie dough to freeze), but worth it.  I made a vanilla buttercream frosting.  These would be a hit at a picnic, birthday party, or bake sale.

I took the short cut that the others suggested and did devils food choc. cake and pillsbury pull apart peanut butter/m&m cookie dough.  They turned out awesome!  I baked for 18 min and they turned out perfect.  About 5 out of the 24 had sunken holes in the middle, but frosting covered that.  They're good with and without frosting.  I used the betty crocker whipped choc frosting.  I would definitely make these again - super easy and delicious!

These cupcakes were a hit when I brought them into the office. One thing I will do different next time is make my cookie dough balls bigger. Since they were too small they turned into a soft cookie instead of dough.(Still yummy though).

What a unique cupcake! Love the idea and they we're very easy using Tollhouse store bought cookie dough (the roll is perfect for 24 cookie balls). I used the yellow cake mix as written and topped with chocolate buttercream frosting but next time i may leave unfrosted as they are very sweet. I baked for 16 minutes and they we're cooked perfectly. Thanks for the recipe.

I thought they were just okay but my husband said they were delicious.  I expected the cookie center to be moist and taste like cookie dough from the ice cream.  Instead I thought it was a little dry and flavorless.  Oh well, the hubs liked them so I made a dozen more and sent them to his office!

This was really fun and good.  I chose to make my standard ccc recipe, and it did not disappoint.  My Memorial Day guests were impressed, and I will make again.  I used the Betty Crocker "French Vanilla" cake mix and frosted w/  ganache, and it was so good.  I baked my cupcakes for a total of 17 minutes, and the center was gooey ccc dough goodness!  You must make these if you love ccc dough!  I did and do! ;)

wowzers! i got a best cupcake ever review from my sweets-crazy boyfriend and 3 year old son. definitely amazing. I cheated and took the simple way out though...take and break choco chip cookie dough, fudge cake mix, and fudge frosting. all premade but made for a quick dessert. I can't wait to try them from scratch!

I took advice from other reviewers and used not only instant cake mix, but premade Pillsbury cookie dough as well! I froze the dough for a good few hours, and dropped them into the cupcake pans. Do not push them down, they will fall to the center of the cupcake on their own! I baked for about 18-19 minutes. When you do the toothpick test, be sure to dip it into the edge, where there is only cake... it should come out clean. If you dip into the middle, you should see very wet cookie dough. That's a good thing! Very easy recipe, and very delicious. My family was mmm-ing the whole way through dessert. Thank you lovestohost for a very unique idea for those of us who love cupcakes and cookies equally!!

These were good, definetely something I'd make again.  I used the butter recipe cake mix and replaced the water with milk and used the butter in place of the oil.  I used my own chocolate chip cookie recipe and made homemade chocolate buttercream.  The only problem I had with them was that a couple of them sunk in the middle a little.  I thought it was because the centers didn't get done, but they were, so I'm not sure what happened.

Yummy! I made these for the kids on Friday since their Field Day at school had been canceled. This sure cheered them up. So yummy! Loved the cookie dough in the middle! I used a yellow mix and also a chocolate cake mix. Both were delicious! I used Rich Chocolate Frosting from this site to frost them.

I made two modifications to this recipe.  Firstly, due to the raw egg advisory footnote, I left the eggs out of my cookie dough recipe.  I'm sending these to work with my boyfriend, and there could easily be pregnant women/older people eating them.  Better safe than sorry, right?  This did not seem to cause any issues with the TASTE of the cookie dough.  Secondly, I dislike using boxed cake mixes. So, I cannot comment on the cake part of this cupcake.  Here's my only concern (and I'm sure it's my own fault):  my cookie dough sat right on top of the cupcake, and did not sink to the bottom, as it appears in the photos.  I don't know if that's due to the fact that I didn't add eggs, so my cookie dough wasn't dense enough, or if my home-make cake batter was too dense.  Either way, just a heads up to others who plan to make either of the changes I did, you might want to put the dough ball on the bottom and then add the cake mix on top.  I don't think it's the BEST cupcake ever.  But, four stars for cookie dough taste and creative idea!

I used the crisco recipe for the cookies, and chocolate cake. I made Dream whip frosting. I only baked them for 16 minutes, and they came out just fine. I had mixed up the cookies the night before and froze cookie/ice cream scoops of them, but cut them in half for the cupcakes. I made 24, but there was batter left for 2 more cupcakes. Kids loved them.

What a great idea! Everyone, including my husband who had already decided he wasn't going to like them, loved them. I used smaller amounts of cookie dough per cupcake just as a preference and they turned out really yummy.  I did not use an icing as I thought they were good enough without it.  Thanks for sharing your recipe LTH!!

Very yummy.  I used a box cake mix, premade fundraiser cookie dough, and canning icing and these were still great!  I love cooking but I just don't have the time these days- so I love recipies that can jazz up the premade things.

Very yummy! I cheated and used break & bake cookies. Next time I will do peanut butter cookies and chocolate cake.

ETA: I always put the frozen dough in the bottom and top with cake mix.I haven't had any sunk centers and the size is perfect.

Thank you so very much "lovestohost" for submitting your suggestions to help everyone out with your wonderful recipe. I'm not a big dessert eater, except when it comes to cupcakes. I love them and these were exceptional to say the least! I will admit that we cheated and used the Pillsbury pull apart cookies and they were still incredible. My daughters friend ate four in one sitting; HA! Ten stars for taste and twenty for creativity!! Thank you again!!

These were absolutely delicious.  Thank you so much for the recipe.  I accidentally took them out a little too early and they started to develop holes, so make sure they are really finished baking.  I frosted them with chocolate frosting and topped them with those Crunch bits.  Everyone loved them!!

These are soooo good!! My picky husband is not big on sweets and he ate two of these before I even had them frosted.  I will be making these alot. I think they are best left at room temperature after baking because when put in the fridge the center gets a bit hard. All in all these are ooey gooey goodness!!

delicious!  I cheated...used refrigerated cookie dough and the cupcakes were AMAZING!  I prefer them warm with no frosting (not a fan of it) but I've gotten compliments on them cooled with vanilla frosting.  Will definitely make again!

This is such a clever idea! I used a chocolate cake mix, and topped each cupcake with a dollop of vanilla buttercream. Everyone loved the surprise of the soft cookie dough center. Comments included “heavenly”, “amazing”,  and “the best cupcake I’ve ever eaten”. They are also much easier to make than other filled cupcakes. I will probably keep a supply of the frozen cookie dough balls on hand in the future, so I can make these in a snap. Wonderful, creative – thanks for sharing!

I just finished frosting and eating not one, but two of these wonderful cupcakes. Mine are slightly messy to eat because my cookie dough stayed extremely gooey. But, the flavor is great. I will be making these again. Follow your cake mix ingredients to make this. Yummy!

They were so yummy! I had to bake them 2x b/c I filled the cupcake holder too much and they puffed up way too much.  But, if you follow the directions and only fill it up 1/3 of the way, you'll be fine :)  I used chocolate mix the 2nd time and the cookie dough really stood out. I don't think frosting is necessary especially b/c it's kind of nice to see the cupcake w/ the cookie dough.

Wow, these are so good, you gotta try them!  I follwed the recipe exactly and topped with some store bought chocolate frosting (which they might not need depending on how much of a chocolate person you are).  Next time I think I'll just buy store bought cookie dough though to get them out of the oven faster.  I'm not a baker by ANY means and they tasted great!  I think kids would love them!

OMG!  This recipe was amazing!  What a great combination--cupcake and cookie in one!  The cookie is definitely a cookie dough taste and texture not a baked cookie and it is soooo yummy!  I took one reviewers advice and used the nestle chocolate frosting recipe and the combo is to die for...so good!  Thanks for such a winning recipe! Didn't change one thing A+++!

Two of my favorite desserts wrapped into one?!  You can't beat this recipe.  The only change I made was to sub the sea salt with regular salt.  I frosted half with chocolate frosting, and the other half with cream cheese frosting.  Perfect for a birthday!

I made these cupcakes with store bought vanilla cake mix, choc chip cookie dough, and vanilla frosting. They are delightful and I am 100% planning on making them again. I made one adjustment by waiting four minutes after the cupcakes were in the oven to place the cookie dough in the center, which worked like a charm. The only thing I would say is to make sure you fill the cupcake liners 1/2 full with batter!! If you fill the liner to 2/3, you’ll have air pockets in the center where the cookie should be. I had one cupcake that was filled with less batter as I had ran out, and I found that 1/2 is the way to go. These cupcakes are very rich and a real crowd pleaser, I highly recommend. Plus, the option to use all store bought ingredients is an advantage for those looking for something quick and easy.

Made the recipe as stated but the cookie dough eventually hardened and was like a rock.  I will try to make this again but maybe alter the cookie dough to be less dry.

Excellent cupcakes, really simple, everyone loves them. don't over bake them, i've done them twice and 18 minutes is almost perfect, might  be even less time, start testing them at 16 min. Use store bought cookie dough if you want to make it even easier. Getting the cookie dough size to cupcake batter ratio in the cup is trickiest part.

I've made these so many times. they are amazing, and never last long. I even made some for my teacher's birthday, and she shared them with other teachers. I always use vanilla cake batter and chocolate frosting, and top with leftover cookies that I baked separately. my mom's coworker was confused by that. but I will make these again and again!

These turned out excellent!! I added some hot coffee into the Betty Crocker Rich and Creamy Chocolate frosting. It tastes fantastic with the coffee!! Heat up some of your coffee in a cup and add a little bit at a time to the frosting mixing with a hand mixer. Taste test to desired flavor and voila!!

I really liked this concept and was excited to try it. I made the recipe as directed, careful not to overbake, and the cupcakes turned out perfectly. The cookie dough, though, had mostly cooked into a flat, dry, cookie at the bottom. Unfortunately I probably won’t make these again.

Was a good creative recipe. I was a little sad that the cookie dough center wasn't cookie dough, and just cooked cookie. I used a yellow cupcake recipe instead of the box mix and was a little dry. But they were really good!!!!!!!!!

I made this as written and found this to be a successful recipe - good cookie dough center and nicely baked baked cake that was neither too dry or too moist. I give it four stars because the cupcakes were simply ..... ok. I’m not sure why it seemed that they were missing something - I am no culinary aficionado - but they seemed that way. Perhaps the cake/dough combination neither complemented one another perfectly nor contrasted notably, or something else, but these were good not great.

Came out perfect.  I used ready made chocolate chip cookie dough.  For those that had dry cakes,  mix your wet ingredients first and make sure the wet ingredients are close to room temperature,  Pop it in the micro for 30 sec  if  need be,  add dry ingredients and do not over mix it’s ok  to have some lumps.

I make treats for my husband to take to work. They love cupcakes so I thought I'd give this one a try. It is such an innovative recipe. The cupcakes received rave reviews! The cookie dough center was such a surprise! I will definitely make them again but will try different cake flavors.

I did like another reviewer, and added a little milk to the cookie dough vs eggs.  They came out great.  My only advice is, DON'T press the cookie dough down into the batter, like I did.  This made the cookie sink to the bottom.  It's okay if not all of the cookie dough is covered by the cake batter.  I'd make them again.

The recipe was great and all went just as planned. I substituted 1/4 cup apple sauce for the egg just to remove the raw egg element. Also, my yellow cake mix was smaller, about 15 oz, so I followed the box directions for egg, water and oil measurements. As a result of smaller cake mix, my version only made 21 cupcakes. I added a chocolate ganache to the top of mine (a splash of half and half and the remainder of the bag of mini chocolate chips). The resulting cupcakes were moist and yummy.

It's okay. I found that the cookie dough dries out the the older the cupcakes are. The cupcakes become less than appetizing after 12 hours or so.

Made no changes, easy and delicious.  While it is really two recipes, using a boxed cake mix cuts down the time a lot.  A  good break from the traditional cupcake.  I made these while kids and gkids were here and I think the gkids would have them every meal if allowed.

I love this recipe! Every time I make it everyone gushes over it. Sometimes i do it with different types of cakes and if I'm super lazy I will get premade dough and freeze it and do it that way! But it's always moist and delicious!

Wow were these great. So good I just dropped some off at the in-laws!  I used devil food cake and prepared per instructions. Bought the precut cookie dough so all I had to do was round them a bit. Rested the cookie balls gently in batter and cooked for 18 minutes. Cooled ten minutes in pan and then removed and turned upside down for another ten minutes of cooling.  Frosted with vanilla store bought frosting. So moist and perfect!!

The batter after you add the cake mix and oil is watery, I added 1 more egg and a tablespoon of cake flour. Pour into pan less than 2/3 because it will rise alot and the cookie dough shows from the top. Use foil, cook 19 minutes. Very yummy

A big hit! I didn't have enough eggs so I omitted the egg from the filling and only used 2 eggs in the cake battter. They were more dense but everyone RAVED about them anyway.

Made these for my twin boys' birthday instead of a traditional birthday cake.  They LOVED it, even saying it was a top 3 dessert.  Short on time, I used cookie dough from a "ready to bake" package and frozen them for 3 hours.  Used a chocolate cake mix and cream cheese frosting.  Delish!!!!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

I was pretty disappointed with this. Honestly, it wasn't bad by any means, but it just tasted like a mediocre box cupcake with a mediocre choc chip cookie inside. Wasn't really worth the effort. Took about 2 hours to freeze solid balls of dough. Also made with devil's food cake mix and chocolate frosting, but pretty blah. Came out perfectly cooked at 16 min 350F.

I have made these several times they have always tasted delicious, but I had to keep working on how they  look.  I think I may have figured out the trick.  I always use a box cake mix and refrigerated cookie dough (mini  cookies).  I open the cookie package and separate the cookies then freeze (usually overnight).  I prepare the cake mix per box instructions. Put one scoop of cake mix on the bottom of each cup, then put one frozen cookie in each cup and press down.  Cover with cake mix (about 1/2 - 2/3 full).  Follow instructions for baking.  I use Satiny Chocolate Glaze (from Allrecipes) instead of frosting...YUM!

my friends love these cupcakes. I've become the 'chef' of our grade at school and am now known for these fantastic cupcakes!! As long as I am careful not to overbake them, I can usually get away with not freezing the dough beforehand.

I like this recipe. However I think the cooking time might be wrong 20 mins and my cupcakes were still raw. Added an extra five minutes came out perfect. Most definitely will keep making this and experiment with other flavors.

I wanted the cupcake to be cooked not gooey, so I baked it at 400 for 18 min. The cookie dough was still mostly uncooked, and the cupcake was completely cooked. So it was perfect! Very heavy, but definitely something I will make again and again!

Some of the best cupcakes I've made.  The dough recipe makes more dough than you need but I just froze the rest for my next batch.  I used a chocolate glaze instead of frosting.  These were a huge hit.  Bake 16-18 minutes.  Also, they are a little gooey inside so I like to give people a heads up about the cookie dough.

I absolutely loved this recipe so I used it in TWO bake sales. Everything came out perfect if you follow the recipes exactly. Freezing is key or else the cookie dough would bake in the cupcake(which would be okay but that isn't the point of the recipe).

Two words - CROWD PLEASER.  These are always fantastic!  I've never received so many complements in my life. I consider this my favorite desert recipe of all time.  

I've made this countless times. My changes - add a tsp of  salt + Vanilla or "Vanilla, Butter & Nut" to both the cookiedough + cake batter. I've tried every variation in the book and the best combo is : Yellow cake + choco frosting.   Be warned, do not use a chocolate cake mix - it just does not pair well with the cookiedough.

I made these using "Best Chocolate Chip Cookies" cookie recipe and the frosting from "Extreme Chocolate Cake" recipe on this site. Did everything exactly as stated. Yes you must freeze the cookie dough. Everyone loved these. My kids said these are the best. Definitely a keeper! Thank you!!

The first time I made them, the cookie dough texture was the same as the cupcake texture, and it just blended in. The cookie dough was out of the freezer for about 7-10 minutes before being put into the oven. The second time I made them, I put them in the oven directly after adding the cookie dough, and for some, I added the cookie dough after about 3 minutes in the oven. The results were so much better, and it worked out incredibly well. Served with the "Chocolate Ganache" featured on this site

I think that this recipe was very rich, but I didn't really like the cookie portion. I think that the cookie portion was a little too bland. I only tasted the chocolate chips. I recommend baking the cupcakes for a bit longer, because after 20 minutes, the cupcake was still batter-y. I recommend using a different cookie recipe for this recipe.

Modified the cookie dough recipe so there was no raw egg. Also added the frozen cookie balls after baking for 6 minutes because I was afraid of the cookie batter baking. The kids love them!!!!

The cupcake was just a regular yellow cake mix cake.  I added dark chocolate buttercream frosting like I do often with yellow cakes.  The cookie dough really did not seem to add much to the overall effect of the cupcake, though.  I'll probably go back to just cake and frosting next time.

Delicious. But  I'm giving it 4 and not 5 stars, because the cookie dough did cook through, so it was like having a lovely chocolate chip cookie inside the cupcake, rather than raw cookie dough.  I found the cookie dough to be very sticky, so I just scooped the dough onto a pan like I would to make cookies.  After it was in the freezer for a couple of hours, I removed them and was able to roll them into balls, then froze overnight.  When baking, I set the timer for 15 minutes and checked every minute after that.  As soon as the "top layer" of cake batter was done, I removed the cupcakes.... but it was too late for the cookie dough.  I will make these again, because we all loved them.  However, maybe sometime I'll try a different cookie recipe inside that is a bit firmer and will maybe freeze harder.   But thank you for a delicious recipe :)

I don't usually rate recipes but with the amount of positive feedback I've gotten making them, I felt it was necessary.  I love this recipe.  It's so easy and a serious crowd pleaser.  I followed the recipe exactly (something I almost never do) taking into account the update about bake time and have never had a problem with my results.  My friends and family ask for the recipe all the time and I am happy to pass it on.  Delicious.  Thanks for sharing :)

I loved it. The cookie dough in the center was very gooey. I assume that's the way it's supposed to be. The only thing I changed was the directions for the cake mix. First I couldn't find any 18.25 oz. cake mixes. The closest I came to it was 16.5 oz.  I followed the directions on the box & just added 1 cup of water instead of 1 1/3 cups. Everything else was the same. I love the idea of making the cookie dough balls ahead & freezing them. Saves time the day you are going to bake them. With the smaller cake mix I only got 23 cupcakes. I'd make them again & try a different flavor cake mix.

My friends were here when I took them out of the oven and they all insisted they weren't done!! I'm so thankful I read your addition about the baking time!! 
I frosted them with Coco chocolate frosting and everyone raved children and adults alike!
I baked them for 16 minutes exactly !!!
Great recipe I'm doing another batch now!!!

I loved this recipe, it was so yummy. I used break apart cookies instead of making homemade to save the hassle. My only complaint is the cookie seemed to bake down the middle of the cupcake was sorta hollow.

Wouldn't there be a way to make the dough without adding eggs - or what about Egg Beaters instead? I would be concerned about eating eggs unless you knew that they had cooked completely in the cupcakes.

As someone else already reported that they followed the instructions to the T and mine were also very dry and crumbly. Maybe I would not cook them as long as the instructions called for.  Also I think I would use my own wonderful chocolate chip recipe to put in the middle of the cupcakes.

DON'T OVERCOOK, I think that is the key.  We enjoyed the cupcakes but the cookie dough wasn't as soft as I expected.  I think I slightly overcooked the cupcakes.  I will try it again but watch the cook time more closely.  Otherwise I followed the recipe as stated and topped with a sweet frosting.  I would choose a different lighter frosting next time so we could taste the cookie dough a bit more.

Never a fan of yellow box cakes since they taste so airy but this was still good.  Especially with the chocolate buttercream frosting recipe on this site.  Used Nestlé cookie dough in the yellow package.   It was already pre-sliced into exactly 24 squares so it makes this recipe extremely easy.  Madelyn made these.  Good to add something different to the plain box cupcake.

OMG.  These are FANTASTIC!. Follow the directions to the letter for the best results. Granted had more cookie dough than batter, so made extra dough balls and store in freezer for up to 3 weeks if you wanna make more. My roommate now wants these instead of a cake for his birthday.  Whole house loved them and lasted less than 5 min!  Great recipe!

My cupcakes turned out very dry and the Cookie dough inside was not strong or very tasty, but before I put it in the cupcake, I tried a little bit and it was very yummy so I'm not sure what I did wrong between the transition of the Dough. But yet very dry and not flavorful as I thought it would taste.

I frozen the cookie dough overnight.  I didn't have full cookies, but only the slightly larger balls stayed gooey.  They were good tho and no dryness issues. They all got eaten and everyone liked them...  They just weren't as outrageous as I had hoped.

Very sweet, but great with chocolate frosting. I was so concerned with over baking from the reviews I accidentally under baked a bit. They still set up overnight and were a big hit!

Was very short on time so I Doctored a boxed cake mix and used store bought cookie dough. Worked wonderfully!!! Made sure to follow the submitters advice to freeze dough for at least two hours and the cupcakes came out nicely, not dry at all. Great, fun recipe!

This is perhaps the best recipe I have ever seen.  I brought these to work and was begged by everybody to bring them in again, and give them the recipe.  My only suggestion is to use plain yellow cake mix rather than the golden butter recipe; it is way to dense and tastes of butter/

Oh. My. Goodness!  These cupcakes are fabulous. My 16 yr old daughter even talked about them to her friends at school. We had three of the guys in her class over to help with yard work and when the cupcakes came out, they said, "We heard about these!", and proceeded to eat the remaining 15 cupcakes over the course of the afternoon. The cupcakes are now everyone's favorites!  Thank you for a winner, lovestohost!  The only change I will make for future batches is to make egg-less cookie dough so they won't have to be refrigerated.

I rarely take pictures of my food - these came out so beautifully I had to record it!  My 4 year old daughter insisted on pink cupcakes but the recipe worked great with Duncan Hines strawberry cream cheese cupcake mix.

They were absolutely DELECTABLE~! :D 
The first batch I made turned out a tiny bit dry, so I decided to bake them for 18 minutes instead of 20 for my second batch. But if you underbake, you have to be careful to cool them carefully because the middles tend to sink in. 
But yes, it was amazing that I could have a cookie AND a cupcake in every bite~ >0

I tried to make it exactly as the recioe said, but found it hard to actually taste the cookie dough inside the cupcake itself. To me, it was more like a chocolate chip muffin with frosting.

This recipe was good. I really loved the concept and flavor and think it is well worth making. I used the chocolate cake mix, pre made cookie dough (break and bakes) and just topped it with whipped cream cheese vanilla icing. Yum!!

I made these for work and everyone there gobbled them up. I used a chocolate icing for half and vanilla for the other half, the vanilla frosted ones went faster. I made them for a family gathering and my whole family was raving about them. I'm about to make them for my boyfriend's birthday now because last time he didn't get many :P

This was an alright recipe. I found the cake part to be dry. I wish it were a real "from scratch" recipe. I think that would have solved the dry cake issue.

I made these for a 4H meeting and I didn't go home with any. I can not put into words how delicious these were. Seriously heaven sent!! I used a spice cake mixture as it was in the fall when I made them. I put chocolate icing on some and cream cheese on the others. Hands down without a doubt the BEST cupcake EVER!!!! UPDATE 4.5.19: This has been my go to recipe for years now. I have made so many different combinations but my cookie dough base remains the same. I can't rave about these cupcakes enough. Give them a shot, there won't be anything left, I PROMISE!!!

This recipe seems absolutely delicious! Cookie dough and cupcakes are two of my favorite foods! With my love for cupcakes, I'm sure this recipe will come in handy. I have tried to make my cupcakeas with cookie dough inside, but often times the dough ends up sinking to the bottom and becoming a sticky mess in the cupcakes. However, freezing the cookie dough first seems like a logical fix to this solution by keeping the cookie dough in more of a condensed solid shape, therefore maybe allowing it to filled in the cucpake better. I also used premade coookie dough, rather than homemaking the dough which may have accouted for some of the issues I ran into. After I baked mine, and frosted mine i placed a small piece of cookie dough ontop to add decoration, and more flavor, and I used a chocolate cake recipe versus vanilla to give the cupcakes more of a choclate taste. They were, and I'm sure these will be too when I attempt to make them very soon!

I have what i think is the original from another food blog...mine were amazing. I did chocolate cupcakes...My friend did a short cut and used chocolate cake mix and premade cookie dough. She said they were great. I used the recipe from the food network cookbook for the best vanilla icing ever!! I made them for my daughters engagement party and wedding.
People were hiding extras for later!

this just didn't work. the frozen cookie dough seemed to throw the cupcake baking time out of whack--the edges were burning, but the middles were still very wet because the frozen cookie dough wouldn't let the batter bake through. (my oven never does this with other recipes.) additionally, and this was NO fault of the recipe's, i used MILK chocolate chips. so the cupcakes turned out not only raw, but sickeningly sweet. next time, i'll just bake regular cupcakes and make a cookie dough frosting rather than filling. good luck with this one, guys.

Definitely make sure you read the directions all the way through before making. ;)

We ended up finishing the rest of the cupcake the following day because of needing to freeze the cookie dough. Also, the chocolate chips  were placed on top of the ball of cookie dough before baking.

However, it was still a good recipe. Not one of my absolute favorites, but I would make it again.

Yum! 

This recipe was awesome. You have to watch the cupcakes VERY carefully to make sure that you don't over cook them because it'll ruin the cookie dough int he middle. 

Made the cookie dough without egg. I substituted with 1 tbs of 1% milk (what I had in my house) and 1 tbs of half and half. Came out delicious. I wasn't comfortable giving people (co-workers and friends) something with raw egg in it. 

Overall... delicious

The cupcake part was delicious. The first time I made these, the ganache made them stick to the roof of your mouth. It was better the second time with homemade chocolate icing.

Very good!  Need to try with Mini chips and only baked for 15 minutes so cookie inside would not bake.

Absolutely LOVED this recipe! I followed the directions and suggestions thoroughly and they came out perfectly. I did freeze my cupcakes for an hour though because they taste better cold. Definitely a keeper!

I've tried this recipe twice now. First time, I used chocolate fudge batter and butterscotch glaze, topped with shredded coconut. Second time, I used yellow cake mix and chocolate fudge glaze, with shredded dark chocolate on top, and the Allrecipe dough recipe for "Absolutely the Best Chocolate Chip Cookies". Even though the cookie dough didn't completely freeze after 6 hours in the freezer (maybe because of the shortening?), the last attempt was so much better. There was a tiny bit of a crunch to the cookie inside, but a very gooey dough center. Will definitely make this one again!

YUM, these are such tasty cupcakes!  The dough is simple to make and you can use a variety of cake flavors.  I recommend the yellow cake because it really helps to enhance the cookie dough flavor. Chocolate cake kind of masked the cookie dough taste.  Like the recipe submitter said, it is imperative not to over-bake.  The dough needs to be a little sticky on the inside...otherwise it won't taste like cookie dough, but a dry and crumbly cookie.  It's the kind of recipe that you may have to play with a little based on your oven, elevation, etc. but it's so worth it!

Wow my babies luv these surprise cupcakes that i didn't have enough. I made these for my babies and my babies at church and the adults were upset they didn't get any. I never thought combining both of these thinking it was going to be too sweet but I was wrong. I top half with homemade chocolate icing and the others with homemade butter cream icing. Thanks for sharing.

These cupcakes made me famous! While they were time consuming, they were definitely worth it. I ended up substituting the cake mix with a chocolate cake recipe and it made it all the more chocolately and delicious.

I made this recipe with red velvet cake mix, a chocolate cookie recipe, and cream cheese frosting, and it turned out great! When I brought them to a birthday party, I got rave reviews and there were none left over.

These were awesome. We used pre-made dough instead of making the dough. Froze the dough balls for around 6 hours, made the rest as directed and they turned out great. My husband and the boys about made themselves sick eating them!

This was certainly a hit with kids, but next time I make it for a party, I will make it during summer time and send them outside with it. Messy. Used Devil's Food cake and creamy vanilla frosting. Easy to make, specially with little helping hands plunking in the frozen dough balls, and fun to serve.

The taste was great but I used a thinner cupcake batter recipe, which I believe caused half the cakes to fall in the middle. :(  It was either that or my oven.  Not the recipe's fault so I still give it 5 stars.  I frosted the cupcakes with a vanilla butter cream frosting that I mixed with chopped 60% dark chocolate.  Absolutely divine.  :)

I love doing this with chocolate cupcakes. Important note: they do NOT store well. The cookie dough goes bad within a day or two max. But really, that shouldn't be a problem ;)

This was good, but not the Best Cupcake I've ever baked/eaten.  Honestly, I think it was the cookie dough recipe that 'threw off' the flavoring on this -- i.e. too much like bad tub cookies I've bought from cub scouts fundraisers... - so perhaps I will try this again with a different choc chip cookie recipe.  Other than that, the consistency, texture and flavor of the cake itself was light and moist.  Perfect companion to the dense cookie center.  No problem cooking or with the cookie center (as agreed you cannot skip the freezing process nor overcook this - mine were done in 17 minutes exactly!) There is a recipe for a brownie middle, I might try that next ... as I'm spoiled and think black bottom cupcakes are the best cupcake there is (it's the one with the cream cheese filling -- i.e. like a mini cheesecake in the middle ... )  All and all great idea!

OK, I didn't really follow the recipe since I used Nestle Tollhouse's break and bake cookie dough, and I used Dunkun Hine's confetti cake mix... And you know what? It still turned out delicious. My boyfriend couldn't get enough and loved that cookie dough inside.

Amazing cupcakes!!! Any chocolate chip cookie dough will work. I have only used yellow cake mix but this would be awesome with other flavours as well I'm sure. Top with chocolate buttercream icing. Mmhmmm!!

Definitely make sure to freeze your cookie dough otherwise you won't get the desired affect.

These are wonderful.  The only thing I changed was using a chocolate cake mix.  The cookie dough tasted wonderful, one of the best I've had.  I used the cookie dough recipe for actual cookies and they tasted awesome.  My family ate these up, will definitely make again.

I loved the idea of these cupcakes but they did not come out nearly as well as I had hoped.  I think the 20 min cook time was too long.  The cookie part seemed dry.  I have two boys.  One thought they were ok and the other tried one and he was done with them.

AMAZING! all my friends loved these! besides my snickerdoodles, this is my most popular dessert. This is a great combination; cookies and cupcakes are great, but who would have thought that they could taste so good combined?! i had a bit of cookie dough left over so i baked some cookies out of it.

These were FANTASTIC!  My daughter requested chocolate chip cupcakes for her 10th birthday (Today) and when I came across this recipe I had to show her and she agreed we just had to try it.  I made the cookie dough last night and froze it over night. I cooked as recommended a total of 18 minutes and made them with yellow cake mix, they came out PERFECT.  The whole family loved them and I can't wait to try these again.  This made my daughters birthday extra special.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

I had a question about this recipe, because I am following the recipe as it says, but when the mix is ready for the cookie dough it is like cake mix not like dough.

these cupcakes are SOOOOOOOOOO good. Too be honest at first i thought these would be way to sugary because its cupcakes AND cookies, but it was just perfect! I made them into mini cupcakes because they are very indulgent and i ended up having a lot of left over cookie dough but that's just more cookies for me! Enjoy!!

I am only 13 and I managed to make these. They taste amazing  and EVERYONE (even Dad who doesn't really like cupcakes) loved them. They don't take the full twenty minutes to bake, however. They were really good with my chocolate frosting that everybody loves.

Yumtacular. I made these last night and they are WAY better today. I was nervous because my second dozen, after cooling, seemed to be undercooked and many tops fell inward. My first batch was perfect, so I believe this was due to having less cake batter to fill around and on top of the dough in each muffin cup in the 2nd batch. Regardless, they tasted fine today (stored them in airtight non-refrigerated container overnight), and the sunken in tops were nicely concealed by incredible pudding-like chocolatey frosting. The cookie dough I made was vegan so as to prevent eating raw eggs - made from my fav choc chip cookie recipe (vegan or not!) from The Joy of Vegan Baking.

So you say this is the best cupcake recipe ever? I'm not so sure. I can't decide if this one is the best or your brownie batter one is better. They're both SO good. I just made these tonight and found a chocolate frosting recipe on allrecipes to make. They are so good...so rich but very good! I can definitely recommend this recipe along with the brownie batter cupcake recipe.

I am 15 years old and I decided I wanted to surprise my mom with a cupcake she would love! I decided to try something new and this was a great recipe! It was easy to make and definitely worth the waiting. One thing I noticed was when removing the dough balls from the try it is better to twist them off rather than pull because they do get stuck. I am planning on making these cupcakes again for the superbowl and bakes sales at my school! I absolutely loved them.

i absolutely loved this recipe. i flipped through about 70 reviews to see what everyone's dos and donts were, and was happy i did. ULTIMATE SUCCESS. 

check my blog post about it here -->http://wineandwanderlust.com/2012/01/09/cupcakes-with-a-surprise-inside/

if i had one piece of CRITICAL advice, it would be to bake for EXACTLY 17 minutes, no matter what... and they were come out with perfection. 

thanks, ltg, for literally, the BEST cupcake, ever.

They were okay. Not fun leaving the dough in for a whole 2 hours because you just want to get on with the baking. I kept them in for about 1.5 hours and they were fine. Would not make again, but others suggest I do. Don't know if it's just me, but I was expecting more.

These were pretty good. I froze the cookie dough balls over night. They were fully cooked with the soft cookie dough in the center when they came out of the oven. I made the mistake of over-filling my cupcake liners though. I added the remaining bag of mini chocolate morsels to the yellow cake batter, which made it soft and melt in your mouth. Overall the taste was good, I just had a hard time eating the center and not thinking it was raw. Maybe if I try this recipe again I'll do the recommended two hours.

Tasty and a surprise for your guests but I thought that the cookie dough would be more dense and less cooked.  I will definitely make these again, though.

Made 25 of these cupcakes for my son's birthday and we also bought a cake (40 people + 10 kids). The cupcakes were gone is minutes and we still had cake after the party.

Ok. Seriously good and seriously easy for a bakery shop cookie. But, you probably already figured that. I wanted to mention that fun way to prepare these is to do a butter-cream and dye it blue with a little frosting dye. Fluff the frosting on the top of the cookie and add googly eyes. I make mine out of white chocolate and set a chocolate chip in the middle so they are edible. The point is when you are done you have Cookie Monster Cookies!!! Sweet, huh? Super awesome at birthday parties. :)

It was well worth the extra time and step to prepare these cupcakes! My family and neighbors loved them. I'm not sure if it is my cupcake pans, the way my oven bakes, or something else, but the cupcakes seemed overfilled and many of them baked over. Next time I am going to make 30 cupcakes instead of 24 because the ones that spilled out of the pans were not as attractive...equally delicious though! Many thanks for a wonderful recipe that is definitely a 'keeper!'

i tried this recipe and was not happy with the baked cupcake.   I used store bought cookie dough that was in squares.  I froze the dough over night and then used the frozen squares in a devil's food cupcake.  once cooked the cookie dough fell and left a hollow pocket in the cupcake.  I filled with peanut butter buttercream frosting- which tasted wonderful.  I recently remade and had the same result - cookie dough falls and leaves a sink hole cupcake.  what is going wrong ?  thanks for your help.

This is an awesome recipe!! I love cookies and cupcakes so together they are so delicious!! I let my cookie dough in the freezer for 2 hours and used moist yellow cake mix and the end product was a moist center with just the right amount of chocolate (since I used vanilla whipped icing).

From the outside it looks like a normal cupcake but when you take a bite you are in heaven and get a whole lot more than expected!! I love it!

These went over well but I personally thought the middle was too baked.  I froze the balls of cookie dough as instructed, but when the outer cake was finished, the inner cookie had partially baked.  Some adjusting may need to be done to find the right balance.  Overall, they tasted good.

I made these cupcakes for a tailgate party and they were a huge hit. They are already a request for the next tailgate! Next time i might make the dough balls a bit larger as I ended up with much more than i needed. I just saved the extras in a container in the freezer for next time.

These were pretty good.  I used the refrigerated mini chocolate chip cookie dough.  Each square rolls into a teaspoon sized ball which was perfect.  Any bigger would have been TOO big in my opinion!  If you want to use the full tablespoon sized ball, I would not fill the muffins with batter more than half, or they will spill over.  I used a packaged frosting and topped with a mini chocolate chip cookie.  Very cute......

Amazing! My husband and I made these this weekend and they are delicious. It is very important that you follow all the directions very carefully. We also only cooked ours for 15 minutes and let cool for 10.We also put a chocolate cream cheese frosting on top with made them even more delicious! Hope you enjoy as much as we did!

Great Cupcake Idea, went over real well at work. For moister cupcakes add a 3.5oz box of vanilla pudding and and extra egg to the instructions on the cake box.

These are my FAVORITE cupcakes. They're really moist and everyone is always really surprised when they get a bite of the cookie haha. I bake them exactly as the recipe says and they're always a big hit whenever I make them.

These cupcakes are really good!  Instead of making the homemade cookie dough I bought store bought.  They still tasted great and it was really easy to just pop each little cookie dough square into the cupcake.  I did have a problem with there being a little pocket in the middle of the cupcake when the cookie dough flattened out in the baking process.  I made sure the cookie dough was frozen so could this have been from using the already made cookie dough instead of making my own?  Other than that these are divine!

I like how the cupcake bakes fluffy around the gooey cookie dough, leaving a nice little surprise in the middle.  I was excited about the idea, but it was just too much sweetness for my taste.  The recipe is a little tricky to follow (p.s. leave the cookie on top of cupcake batter - it's not necessary to push it all the way down).  The oven temp and baking time  may be difficult for some to follow, really, until you test one from the first batch to see what doesn't work.  Obviously this recipe is a big hit with others, but it's not for my tastes.

I love this idea.  I used refrigerated dough from the store and it was nice because it was already in squares when I put it in the freezer.  People are definitely impressed when you serve these at a get-together!

I have made this recipe twice.  Both to rave reviews.  People are always amazed that there is a cookie in the middle.  Also before I freeze the cookie dough I'm tempted to just bake the cookies because they smell so delicious!  The first time I made them I was so proud of myself.  I can make a baked good by scratch...and I'm definitely not a baker!  Follow this recipe to a T and it is perfect.  Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!

I love this idea, but I was squeamish about the raw eggs, so I made eggless cookie dough. Thanks for the great idea, lovestohost! :)

I love the concept behind these but didn't get the results I had hoped for.  I followed the directions and froze my cookie dough for over two hours and I baked them for only 17 min.   The cookie dough was completly baked into the cupcake, resulting a very dry cupcake.

I made these for an after-church snack, and everybody loved it! I had one of my friends, unaware that I had made them, tell me that he would pay up to $20 for eight more.

I've made this recipe over and over, and it's my official "go-to" cupcake recipe to impress. It's always a hit! I like to top it with buttercream icing and garnish with a mini chocolate chip cookie. Fabulous! Thanks!

AMAZING!  Super sweet and delicious.  I was in a hurry so I bought mini refrigerated chocolate chip cookies and they were the perfect size.  I used "funfetti" white cake and they were moist and delicious!  Thank you lovestohost!

These turned out just as delicious as I expected them to be! I didn't have a lot of time so I used the pillsbury cookie dough from the dairy case and it was already portioned out into 24 perfectly sized pieces. Will definetly be making this again and again!

I had a box of vanilla cake mix sitting in my cupboard that I wanted to use up and thought I'd give this recipe a try. As I'm pregnant, I used jessamine689's recipe for eggless cookie dough instead (adding chocolate chips), and while it was very good I did need to freeze the dough for a full day to get it completely frozen. I also topped the cupcakes with Sharon Gerstman's recipe for buttercream icing. The results were fabulous! Great concept for a cupcake, lovestohost, thank you :D

So this I will try again. They smell wonderful and I love the idea, the whole middle caved in terribly and I could hardly get them out of the pan. I think after reading all the reviews I was so paranoid about overcooking that I took them out prematurely. And I also think I took the advice to make larger cookie dough balls way to far, mine were small golf ball sized. Maybe next time smaller balls and longer time in the oven. UPDATE!! Made again and cooked them a touch longer and they were absolutely perfect! I had everyone raving about them at work and have had special requests for them!

These were excellent! Did them exactly as directed, turned out great. The tip is to really freeze the cookie dough and take them out early then you would think they would be ready...I did 16 minutes. Thanks!

I have made these cupcakes many times and they are always a hit.  I live in a college dormitory so when I go home I bake a couple dozen of these for my friends.  Everyone always requests that I make them when I can, and raves about them after.  I use a yellow butter box cake mix, and break and bake chocolate chip cookies, so easy!  The one thing I do go all out on is the frosting, I make a chocolate cream cheese one that is delicious!

They weren't quite what I expected.  Don't get me wrong they are tasty, but I guess I was expecting more of a cookie dough flavor coming at me.  Maybe next time I'll try using chocolate cake mix instead.

After reading the reviews I was a bit skeptical but I loved these! So yummy!... I used a chocolate cake mix and purchased "break and bake" cookie dough and put them in the freezer for about 30 min since they were already refrigerated. I only baked the cupcakes for about 17 minutes so they would remain moist and not dry out. Then topped them with a buttercream icing... A definite hit in my book!

These cupcakes were pretty good.  I had to make them twice because I was so nervous about over baking, I took them out of the oven a little too soon and the centers collapsed.  The second time around I was patient, because mine needed to be in until 20-21 minutes or so.  I personally do not like "cookie dough" things, but those in my family and friends that do, thoroughly enjoyed these.  If I were to eat them, I'd make the dough balls smaller, but I mentioned that to a friend and she said no, bigger!  I used pillsbury ready made cookie squares and rounded them before freezing for 2.5 hours.  I put the small dabs of homemade butter cream frosting on the top, but it wasn't really required.  These were tastey and sweet without any help from frosting.  over all, i will keep this recipe and use again.  thanks!

These cupcakes were pretty good, but they didn't taste quite as cookie-doughy as I was hoping. I think I should have made the cookie dough balls bigger maybe. I also took others advice, and used a chocolate cake mix- so maybe that overpowered the dough. I might try it again with yellow cake mix and more cookie dough. Cool idea though! The kids liked them.

Delish!  To save time, I use store bought cookie dough.  The key to making these work, is to freeze the dough before baking.  This will ensure a gooey inside.  I prefer to use chocolate cake mix instead of yellow.

I was a little disappointed in this one. I thought the cookie just kind of blended it with the cake- it did really go over big with my guests. I froze the cookie balls like it said, but it still cooked too much.

Excellent idea.  I didn't have the time to freeze my dough long enough so it was kind of a disaster at first, but the ones that did stay together taste wonderful.  Next time I will freeze overnight.

So as I was making these cupcakes, I was thinking...these aren't going to be that good, they are just a ball of cookie dough in yellow cake mix. But, they are good! BEST cupcake, NO. Who ever quoted it as the best really over exaggerated GOOD cupcake, yes. I followed this recipe without reading any reviews and the cupcakes turned out great! My only advice would be to very delicately drop the cookie dough onto the cake batter just so when the cake begins to bake around the dough it doesn't create a hole in the top when it is finished. It doesn't really matter though if you plan on frosting them.  Again, NOT the best cupcake but a darn good 'cookie dough cupcake'.

I love these cupcakes. I made them for my daughter's 5th birthday and they were a hit. If you are in a pinch for time, you can use store bough cookie dough (frozen or refrigerated) and make sure it's frozen solid before placing in mix. I pushed it in a little. Then I microwaved some store bought chocolate frosting until soft and dipped top of cupcakes in for easy and smooth frosting, then added some sprinkles. Yum!

We LOVED these!!  My MIL gave me a box of cake mix and I wanted to doctor it up to make it taste better so this was perfect!  I made them Halloween-ish by using orange frosting with decorations.  My husband took a batch to work and he said they were a hit!!  Thanks so much!!

ok so i really wanted to rate this 3 1/2 but i couldn't figure out how and they don't deserve a 3.  they were good but not as amazing as i thought they'd be.  the yellow cake is a little too bland-it needs a kick.  the cookie part is excellent-very yummy.  if you play around with the cake part (chocolate might be better or marble or homemade not cake mix) they'd deserve 5 stars.

This was fantastic! I made a few changes. For the cake, instead of using the water and oil like the box says, I used 1 cup of milk and 1 stick (1/2 cup) of butter. This was the cupcakes were denser and delicious, especially with chocolate frosting!  I made 24 cupcakes, that cooked for 20 minutes at 350. I originally had them only cooking for 16 minutes, but then the cakes weren't done and if taken out of the wrappers, they'd collapse. I'd rather have a cupcake that holds its shape with a slightly more cooked cookie than a cupcake that melts.  But overall, fantastic! Everyone was super happy - I've made a batch every night this week!

Made exactly as written except used a white cake mix and was out of canola oil so subbed 1/3 cup of melted butter flavored Crisco.  Made a chocolate buttercreme frosting that I piped on top and had nothing but excellent reviews from everyone I let try these.  Definitely a keeper!

This was fabulous. I didn't freeze the cookie dough, just put it in the fridge for a few hours. They came out perfect.

These are really good. To save time I used toll house mini chocolate chip cookies (the break and bake kind), and put one square in each cupcake. I baked them for 16 min, and they turned out perfect! I frosted them with chocolate fudge buttercream (can be found on this site), and everyone loved them!

I saw this and could not stand how good it sounded! I made this using Chocolate Cake. I did everything right but couldn't seem to get the cake to cook all the way. And I made a Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting! Besides the cake being a little underdone it tasted great! What a great invention! Ps how do i add my picture??

These cupcakes were ok.  A little dry I thought.  The cookie dough center doesn't do much for me, I think a cream filling of some sort is better.  Probably will not make these again.

I like the idea of this recipe but did not like the 2 together.  I tried this w/ chocolate frosting and it was way too rich.  It was better w/o frosting but I won't make this again.

Made these for a bake sale, the kids loved them. I followed the recipe exactly, and baked each batch for 17 minutes.  Came out great, with gooey cookie dough in the middle.  Will experiment again with different cake flavors and cookie doughs.  Thanks for the idea :)

These came out amazing! Froze premade cookie dough for 2.5 hours and used box cake. So good! Definitely needed to be cooked for about 20 min. Did less on the first batch and they sunk in the middle. Might just be my oven though. Will make these again

YUMMY!!  I made the recipe exactly as written.  I did use the recipe writer's tips and made sure the cookie dough was frozen (left it in the freezer overnight) and made sure to NOT overcook these.  16-17 minutes was perfect for me!

It looks like a great recipe but my cookie dough will NOT freeze.  I left it overnight and it's cold but still pretty soft.  I used the cookie dough recipe here.

I made this the first time for an informal cupcake contest among friends.  I won 1st place!  Everybody loved these cupcakes.  I will definitely be making them again.  I used the refrigerated pull apart cookie dough which made it so easy!   I followed the recipe time exactly and out of 24 cupcakes there was one mushy one which I threw away.  the others firmed up nicely and still stayed slightly chewy...Perfection!

We liked these a lot! The cookie dough did cook most of the way, even though the cake batter was raw around it. Next time I will freeze them in the deep freeze or something. But even with them cooking partway they were oh-so-tasty. To make it easier to make I used a choco boxed cake mix and cheated and used a cookie mix from a box as well.

The cookie dough baked with the cake even though I froze them exactly like lovestohost said to, and DID NOT overbake them. The cake was really bland. Kind of overrated and super disappoing. : (

Made these with vanilla cake mix and vanilla frosting.  Brought them to a family party and all were eaten quickly.  Made the cookie dough from the recipe but next time will definitely try with pre-made chocolate chip cookie dough.  A fun idea that can be easily changed depending on the flavors of cake and frosting you prefer.  I used my mini ice cream scoop so the balls of dough were uniform; definitely don't forget to freeze them before adding to the batter.  Enjoy!

WOW! These cupcakes are really yummy and addictive! We used a milk chocolate frosting but these are just as delicious without frosting! One thing I have noticed though - after they are done baking, the cookie dough is more hollow or 'holey' in the center, (if that makes any sense). What could be causing this? Anyway, these are still scrumptious! Thanks so much for posting!

Such a fun cupcake!  Mine came out deliciously, in spite of two slight issues.  First, I made up my 24 dough balls using ALL of the dough made in the recipe, and thought the balls seemed kind of large but continued on.  Then, I filled my cupcakes slightly too full (since the balls were big) so I didn't have a full 24, but even will the filled-ness, the cookie dough wasn't completely covered.  Solved that problem by covering the "dips" with icing and topping each with a mini chocolate chip cookie.  I used a Devil's Food cake mix and Special Buttercream Frosting.  I froze the dough for 24 hours and since they were on the larger side, I baked them for 19 minutes and they came out perfectly.  Can't wait to show people tomorrow!

Even though I froze the cookie dough as instructed, it still melted in the cupcakes and they ended up just tasting like cake batter.

These were very good, but very crumbly. Next time I'll use baking cups. Also let them sit in the fridge after baking. They taste way better cold!

My kids and I LOVED them, but my husband said they were too much.  They were also quite messy, especially for the kids.  I also think that next time I will try leaving the egg out of the cookie dough and see how that works out.  LOVE the idea of this cupcake.  Maybe I should make some now...

Best cupcakes ever, took them to work and everyone loved them. To anyone having problems with the recipe, the key is to make sure to freeze the cookie dough, that way it doesn't bake along with the cake dough.

My boys loved them. Also did easy version of adding already made cookie dough mix. Did yellow cake mix and did a batch chocholate. Loved them. I'm digging into them and am not into sweets as much as my boys. Second set of cupcakes, did put batter into oven to cook for a minute and then added cookie dough into cupcakes. Helped me have dough more towards middle of cupcake vs bottom and dough still cooked well. Well definitely add to desert rotation. Thanks.

Well, I have tried to make this now three times and each time the middle sinks in.  I've baked for 16 min. 17min and 18 min.  Maybe I just need to keep baking longer?  Not sure but it hasn't been fun.  Oh well.  Everyone else seems to love them.

genius idea! i made these and someone told me that it was "the best cupcake I've ever had." I made mine using the cookie dough recipe here (btw kosher salt isnt important) and then I followed someone else's advice and used David's Yellow Cake recipe from this website. The cake choice turned out to be kinda interesting... it was kinda cornbread-like. It sort of worked to offset the sweetness of these cupcakes, but the texture was still a little odd. Next time I'll try these with a different cake recipe, though I don't think I'll go with a boxed mix bc those are usually very sweet. Hope this helps!

If you don't give these cupcakes 5 stars you either a) don't like sweets, or b) didn't make them correctly.  These are so amazing, and they never cease to get rave reviews wherever I bring them.  I use chocolate cake mix and top them with vanilla buttercream. So good!

I thought this was a great recipe! I did make a few changes though. Only because I wanted to make something quick. I used a yellow cake mix and bought store bought Pillsbury Chocolate chip cookie dough. Turned out great!!! The whole fam loved them.

I made these last night, they turned out nicely and look great! However I think I overbaked them, I cooked them for only 16 min.  The cookie dough centers are soft on the inside but had started to bake around the outside.  You really have to be careful with these.  I will make them again

Amazing! The first time I bit into one of these I wondered why I had never thought of these before! I made these for the second time yesterday and baked a little longer than I did before...baked about 19 minutes. They are so awesome.

So I decided to try these, I didn't really believe that the cookie dough wouldn't cook.  Sure enough it didn't.  I am a huge fan of cookie dough, so these were absolutely amazing.  I made a batch of 24, and my husband (who doesn't eat sweets) ate 18 of them! Can't wait to try the brownie one next!

I liked these. I didn't love them. I think four stars is a bit of a stretch even. It was fun for a treat and something different but I don't think I would ever make them again. I would probably rather just have a plain old cupcake to be honest!

Very creative recipe.  I made chocolate WASC cake and used premade cookie dough.  I had trouble with the cookie dough rising to the top even though I smashed the frozen ball of cookie dough into the cake batter.  Caused some cracks in the top of the cupcake.  Still tasty though.

Hi i am planning on making these sometime this week for a group of about 40-60 people and was wondering if it would be okay to cook some a day ahead just so I can make sure they are done in time. If so, should they be kept refrigerated prior to being served? Thanks!! Can't wait to make them!! The recipe looks awesome!

i bought the cookie dough to make it easier and went with the grocery store brand to cut costs and will never do that again! normally the off brands are so similar but i could totally tell the difference in taste/quality. next time i will go with the nestle cookie dough. i also used chocolate cake mix because that's all i had. frosted with "rich chocolate frosting" from this site. it was super rich. i liked these cupcakes a lot, but not loved them. maybe i will like LTH's brownie cupcake better.

I thought they were just okay.  I followed all the suggestions from others so they did turn out as they should have.  Even though I did not care for them, everyone said they were great and asked for the recipe.

These have potential to be really good if you do them right, I am not a baker!!! lol, but they were an easy alternative to homemade cupcakes. I would suggest however when you make these, only fill the cupcake liner half full! roll the cookie batter (before you freeze them) about an inch in diameter when you make the balls or else you have a lot of plain cupcake and a little bit of chocolate in the very bottom of the cupcake. I really think the cake mix shouldn't out-do the cookie, or else its bland.  Very good idea, and recipe!

This was delicious! I used mini chocolate chips and they worked out perfectly although the dough did sink to the bottom of the cupcake. Maybe coating with flour would help. I personally think that these are better the second day. Yummy! I wonder if the cookie dough would make cookies? Will find out!

Many requests for this recipe. Fun to do for something different. I did chocolate cake mix and made sure the cookie dough was nice and frozen.

Wonderful idea!  I used a box cake mix and the Toll House Mini-Cookies Choc Chip cookie dough (found in the refrigerator section).  The mini's were the perfect size so ..just pull apart and freeze.  Turned out very good.

I made these for a friend's birthday this past weekend and they came out pretty good. The first batch I'm pretty sure I filled too full so they were sort of flat instead of puffed on top..so just be careful to leave enough room for the cookie ball. I also used some of the cookie mixture and made tiny cookies to top them with later! Tasted one pretty soon after they came out of the oven to make sure it was right before the second batch went in the oven and it was delish warm....I ended up putting the finished cupcakes in the fridge for a couple hours before serving and it did change the texture of the cookie inside but they were still good!

These are outstanding!  Great w/chocolate or vanilla batter.  I suggest baking them for a few minutes less, otherwise the cookie dough dries out.  Thanks for a great recipe that everyone loves!

FANTASTIC!!  I made with chocolate cake mix and topped with Wiltons recipe for Buttercream Frosting.  I only baked 18 minutes.  Hubby gave the "perfect 10" rating to these. Yum!

So good!  To echo the submitter, these little balls must be frozen HARD AS ROCKS.  If you follow the directions perfectly, they don't turn out dry and blend into the batter; they're absolutely delicious and moist.  Love the idea...thank you for sharing!!!

I made this receipe for my daughters first birthday. You really do want to take the muffings out even when it doesn't look done. The muffins were good, but its not something that I would make when I have quests over.

This was ok to me.  Like others said, make sure you freeze it.  I guess I just did not like the cookie dough in the middle part.  Also the yellow cake mix tasted way better then the red velvet.

Used iodized salt instead of sea and followed the oil and water amounts on the box of the cake mix; fantastic either ways, surely. Although: while still warm, the cookie dough and chocolate chips are so soft that they are of exact feel as the cake.  People thought only chips were in the middle, the fiends! After spending some time in the fridge, the dough firmed and was the consistency cookie dough should be (was expected to be).

Absolutely yummy! and so easy, the key is to make sure the cookie dough is frozen solid before you put them in the batter like the recipe says. I used the one bowl buttercream frosting and a box mix, they were awesome, thanks for the recipe!!

If I could give this a million stars I would.  Delish!  Instead of making my own cookie dough I used store bought.  It ended up being frozen for a couple of days because we had things come up and I just didn't have the time to make the recipe.  The cupcakes turned out perfectly at 16 minutes cooking time.  The cookie dough in the middle was amazing.  After reading reviews of it cooking throughout and turning out weird, I was scared, but fortunately that didn't happen here at all.  Perfect cupcakes, perfect cookie dough - perfect combination!  I can't thank you enough for this recipe idea.  I'm already thinking up different combos of cake flavors and cookie dough flavors.  Fun!

Awesome cupcakes! I made these for a friend for her birthday and kept a couple for myself since they turned out so yummy! I would recommend freezing the cookie dough for about 2 and a 1/2 hours. That way you are guaranteed that the cookie dough will not melt when you bake the cupcakes. I only baked my cupcakes for 18 minutes. They turned out to be super!

Wow, these were yum.  My first batch did not cook long enough so my tops fell and a bit of mushy cupcake batter in there.  My second batch was perfect, I cooked for about 17 1/2 minutes.  I frosted with chocolate buttercream and they were fabulous.  I will definitely make again; however, I would like to figure out why my good batch had a gap between the cookie dough and cupcake-like an air pocket.  I noticed in a pics a few had this but most didn't.  So, I'll just keep trying!

These are now my new favorite cupcakes! I loved them! They are very easy to make and come out so moist, even my picky husband loved them! Freezing the dough is critical and I took them out after 16 minutes, they're best when warm! Thanks for the wonderful recipe, I'll be making these again!

I was a big cheater with this one! I used store bought cookie dough and froze chunks of it the night before. I also used boxed devil's food cake mix, but instead of the box directions I used 1 c buttermilk, 4 eggs and the normal amount of oil. Extremely easy to do! The cupcakes were good overall and the cookie dough was moist, but the actual cake was rather dry.

My kids went crazy over this recipe.  I used refrigerated cookie dough as someone else suggested and they came out great. I am excited to try new combinations.

These turned out perfectly! I would make these again. Glad people have put a tip on here to make sure you freeze the cookie dough before hand though, that helped a lot!

These were very tasty and easy to put together. I used pre-packaged cookie dough and chocolate cake mix. I will definitely be making these again.

WOW!!  I used nestle cookie dough in a sleeve and simply rolled it into balls and froze it overnight. There are sooo many different ideas for these cupcakes! You can experiment with different cake flavors as well as cookie flavors. You could dip the cookie dough into melted chocolate before freezing. I bet you could even make an adult version with some alcohol flavor in the cupcakes. Great recipe...I keep getting requests for these now!

I wasn't too much of a fan, too sweet for me, but i don't really like sweets all that much a lot of times.  I gave it 4 stars because hubby said they were the best cupcakes i ever made.

I'm not a fan of boxed cake.  I'd rather get that right in the open because the cupcakes were not all that great.  The true star was definitely the cookie dough.  I usually make the cookie dough for ice cream and replace the egg with a bit of milk.  Taking everything in consideration, I was disappointed.

I thought these were okay... I used the chocolate buttercream frosting from this website but it really didn't need the frosting at all. My mom said she thought they were really rich but I don't think that was the problem. I guess I just didn't get too excited about them... and I love cupcakes and I love cookie dough! So I don't really know what the problem was... they were good... just not amazing. So I think I'll give them 4 stars. :)

I didn't use a cake mix cake, made my favorite cake and then added the store bought cookie dough to them.  Froze the dough until solid and then baked them, they were Very Good!!  Will make them again for sure!  Thank You!!!

These cupcakes were good, though I was hoping I would get a cookie dough gooey to make my mouth say "wow". Instead the centers didn't taste any different, and they blended in like rest of the cupcake. I won't be making this again.

These cupcakes are sooo goood! What a great idea. Definetly different. My only problem on some of my baking tays- they didn't raise enough to cover the cookie dough and ened up with a whole in the middle where the cookie dough was. Frosting fixed that problem but, they were still good and moist. I used chocolate frosting. YUM!

This could have easily been 5 stars, probably should have followed the recipe exactly. I used some leftover sugar-cookie dough I had been freezing and added carob chips to some, then butterscotch chips to the rest. Yeah, not the best cookie dough in there. Will definitely try these again some time but will make regular chocolate chip cookie dough. Awesome that the cupcakes cook right over the dough, I added an extra amount of yellow-cake mix to some, thinking they wouldn't work without the addition, but those cupcakes turned out huge! Definitely works to fill the liners 1/2-3/4 of the way full.

I made these for my preschool class halloween party and they turned out very dry. I don't know if it just the way my oven cooks (its not the best) or if the recipe is just not that great. The cookie dough is honestly not even like cookie dough after its cooked in the cupcake.

FANTABOULOUS! This recipe is so easy to make. I was a little worried that they were under cooked...but it turned out great after sitting for a couple of hours. The cookie dough was soft and gooey...just right! I made them for my friend's son's birthday party. Everyone was ranting and raving about them. Thanks for this recipe!

Very good.  I will have to cook it for a minute or two less next time because the cookie dough was cooked around the edges, but that's my fault.

Oh.  My.  God... these have to be the best cupcakes ever invented.  Honestly, I'm not big on cupcakes, but I was searching for something to serve at my sister's baby shower.  I used store bought turtle flavored cookie dough and froze it over night in my deep freezer.  I also used chocolate fudge cake mix and topped it with caramel icing.  Simply sinful and worth all the calories!!!  This is the only cupcake recipe I'll use from now on - I don't think I could handle the plain boring ones any more after having had these.  The best part was watching my husband take his first bite, close his eyes, and say "Mmmmmmm, there's something yummy in the center"!!!

These were absolutely delicious, but the cookie dough definitely cooked along with the cake. Even so, it wasn't too dry and they received rave reviews at game night!

Absolutely amazing. I plan on making this many many times. I used chocolate cake mix instead and it was delicious! The contrast of the cookie dough and the chocolate was fabulous!

These were awesome! Thanks for the recipe.  Next time I will try and use a sugar free frosting - a few people commented that they were 'too sweet', but I'm not really sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing! Thanks again for the great addition!

Excellent.  I used refrigerated cookie dough.  Worked great.  There is no need to frost these cupcakes.  I took them to a tailgate party and they were gone in minutes.  Thanks

These were AMAZING! Instead of the white cake mix, I used my own favorite (chocolate) scratch cake recipe- more work, but worth the effort! I did find them a little difficult to bake... if the cake batter was fully cooked the cookie inside got baked, even after freezing them, and if I took it out earlier, the whole bottom of the cupcake was raw.  That being said, they were still unbelievable. They were all gobbled up (both the under and over cooked ones) in literaly a matter of minutes. I will be making these often. Maybe I will try to freeze the cookie dough longer.

These cupcakes are a Blue Ribbon winner. My family loved them so much that I decided to enter them in the State Fair. To tell you the truth I didn't think they would win first place. Not because of the recipe but because the frosting started melting while driving to drop them off at the fairgrounds. I was pleasantly surprised when I found I won first place with these cupcakes. My son is entering them in another fair this coming weekend. I will be making these cupcakes on a regular basis and will be experimenting with different flavors.

I just tried this recipe. It is AMAZING! I used two different premade cookie dough (White chocolate macadamia nut and peanutbutter cup) and I used a butter flavored cake mix to which I added almond extract. All I can say is Oh My God!!! My husband and I are both going nuts! The dough didn't stay as doughy as I had hoped, but its ok! Adding that flavor to the regular cupcake made it soo much better! I will definately make them again! I'm taking them to work with me in about an hour, I can't wait to see the reactions!!

Good. I think my dough balls should be smaller next time though.  The centers 'sunk' too, but that was easily fixed with icing!  :)

Yum, yum and yum. Swapped out the cake mix w/ a chocolate flavor instead. Topped w/ a 'chocolate cookie buttercream frosting' (also on this site) and they were to die for. Couldn't have been any better!

I made these for my son's birthday party,  yesterday, and they were devoured! I frosted them with a chocolate butter cream, and I used a yellow cake mix.  I made devil's food with white frosting which were also eaten until gone, but the cookie dough ones did go first.  Adults and kids alike, loved them!  I know they don't "need" another 5 star review, but I am leaving one, anyway. Great idea and great recipe! Thank you.

My husband almost peed his pants over this one.  He loved, loved, loved them.  I had some issues with timing, the first batch that went in were underdone and never really set up properly, and the second batch were overcooked (which dh preferred, actually.)  They were still yummy either way and I will definitely make again.

This recipe needed a "scratch" chocolate cupcake recipe. I made each step of the recipe and the cupcake (yellow cake mix) tastes like it is. The filling was not very special.

I thought these cupcakes were SUPER good! Right after they came out of the oven the middle was still gooey but the chocolate chips had melted and it was amazingly good! However my sister thought they were even better after being in the fridge for a few hours. To each their own! I used whipped cream on top and I thought it was a perfect mix.

I used chocolate cake mix and ready made cookie dough...came out soo tasty! It got rave reviews as well! I cooked mine about 16 minutes...any more and the cookie dough would have cooked for sure. I just kept an eye on them and took them out even though they looked like they could have cooked longer, but it was perfect. Great recipe.

The cupcakes were very good, and very moist.  I was in somewhat of a hurry and didn't let the cookie dough freeze entirely before dropping it into the cupcake and baking ... so my cookie centers were not cooked fully and there was a hollowed center to all of the cupcakes.  I will try this again, but I think that you definitely need to let the cookie dough freeze!

I was searching for some awesome cupcakes to make recently and this was the first one to pop up and the name says it all! Instead of making my own cookie dough, which im sure would be much better and would fit it more in the center, i used store bought alreay made cookie dough and the centers were a little hollow because the cookie rounds were smaller but it still tastes AMAZING!! i made them for my family, who ate them all up, and then made about 50 more for an event at work and all i heard all day was how wonderful they were and where i got the recipe. I recommended this site and recipe and enjoy making these. It only takes me 15 minutes in the oven and they turn out perfect! Oh and I used fudge marble cake mix and a second time I used golden butter cake mix. Delicious!

Fun! I think I will use already made cookie dough next time! Less dishes:) I also should have read the recipe first cause I did not know until last minute you had to freeze it for 2 hrs!

Sooo I made these last week, an they were gone, like all delicious things, under 24 hours. lol. This house is full of chocolate an cookie monsters so I just had to make them, of course. I used a confetti cake mix an tried to dye it with black food coloring [[don't get it on your hands!!!]] an some cocoa powder for coloring. The mixture was a dark purplish but came out looking chocolately =) My mom said it reminded her of pudding..O!!! An instead of oil, eggs, etc, I USED A DIET POP. Not sure if that's why the tops looked so ugly afterwards, but hey, it's a wil healthier right!?! Because it was just for home, I didn't bother with a frosting an no one bothered to use the canned stuff [[lost in the cuppourd..]. All n all, THANK YOU!!!!!!! you genius you ;) I'll have to make them sometime when school starts.

Thanks, lovestohost, for a terrific recipe.  My family went nuts over these- kids and adults alike.    I used chocolate cake and chocolate frosting and these were just amazing- over a long weekend with extended family I had to make them twice.

These were fabulous! I made them for the people that came over to help me with wedding invites and projects. The perfect treat. I made them without frosting...was wondering if anyone has found a frosting that works well with these cupcakes?

Cupcakes were yummy, but to be honest I wasn't knocked off my feet like I was hoping to be based on most of the other reviews.  Other than a bit of a texture change, I couldn't really tell there was cookie dough in the middle.

This recipe was really good. The only reason I'm giving it four stars and not five is because there are other varieties of cupcakes I like better. My mom however, loved these- so did a bunch of my friends. One tip, after to take them out of the oven, wait as little time as possible to remove them from the muffin tray. Why? I was afraid that they would continue to cook, seeing as how the tray is still hot. You don't want that cookie dough inside to start to bake. So, take out the cupcakes ASAP and PUT THEM IN THE FRIDGE- that way the cookie dough stays doughy.

OK, first off, being tired and having pregnancy brain does not combine well when baking. Instead of setting my oven to bake, I accidentally set it to BROIL. Oops. Despite this mishap, the cupcakes actually  turned out surprisingly well. I  tried one cupcake where the cookie dough had cooked through, it was a little too sweet for my tastes, but my coworkers really liked them (cooked cookie and cookie dough kinds). I used a different Choc. Chip Cookie recipe from this site, but I did use yellow cake mix and put a cream cheese frosting on top.

SUPER YUM! I will post a picture as soon as I figure that out. But I was excited to bake these and then review so here goes...I am a cupcake FANATIC!! These are decadent, but I made my own variation. I used triple chocolate fudge cake mix, and i followed the directions on the box, not the directions in this recipe (i read reviews that said it was too dry, so i followed the recipe on the box for the cake bc it called for more oil, which i think was why mine came out so perfect), then made dough by betty crocker bag cookie dough mix - i think its called DOUBLE CHOCOLATE CHIP. then used WHIPPED chocolate topping, so this cupcake was ALLLLLL CHOCOLATE! The dough doesnt get very hard even in the freezer overnight for some reason. but thats ok, just plop them in there anyways, and bake for only 14-15 minutes, let sit in pan for 10 min, then remove. no need to put upside down. it wasnt "DOUGHY" in the middle, just nice and chewy...it was aboslutely perfect. if I had baked it any longer it wouldnt have been as good. ENJOY ENJOY ENJOY!!!! THIS IS A KEEPER!!!

Super tasty. I added 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder and some extra sugar to offset the bitterness of the cocoa.

Tried these for a family bbq. My husband and grown-up kids loved them My daughters and their husband/boyfriend took some home with them.  I used the refrigerated cookie dough. Rolled each piece into a ball and froze. It worked great! Will definitely make again.

A very simple yet special dessert. I never make cupcakes cause I think they can be sort of boring but this was a lot of fun! I took them to a cook out and everyone was very pleased to find cookie dough in a pretty average looking dessert. I didn't even use frosting, which left them looking a bit ugly but they were really yummy. Also, a bit of advice: These are certainly better left in the refridgerator because the cookie dough is so much better when it's firm but if they do get gooey, it sets up again after a surprisingly short time in the refridgerator - a couple hours or so. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Good. Used a chocolate cake mix. Made twice and the first time I overbaked and the cookie part was completely cooked, so be sure to check before you think they should be done. I frosted with chocolate icing.

I finally made these after drooling over the recipe for a while, but with cake mix for the cupcake and ready-made cookie dough and followed the directions accordingly otherwise. They are SINFUL!! Yum yum.

So tasty! I made them to bring to a friends' house and didn't tell them about the cookie dough inside. Their reactions were so great! I was on a time crunch so I used pre-made cookie dough from the supermarket instead of making my own. To reiterate some of the advice previously given - it was very important that the dough was frozen and overcooking really ruins them.

*****  These are so melt-in-your-mouth-delicious!  *****  I wanted to take some to the neighbors because I didn't think we needed 24 naughty cupcakes around our house, but my husband wouldn't let me!  (and he's not even a dessert person!)   - - -  I used a Devil's Food Cake mix, and topped them with the 'Cream Cheese Frosting II' recipe on this site.  I froze the dough overnight, and plopped them onto the cupcakes right before baking.  Super easy!

The novelty of these cupcakes deserves a 5-star rating, but I don't think the taste was a 5-star.  I made the recipe as stated but did use a chocolate fudge cake mix because I wanted the color contrast.  I froze the cookie balls for about four hours and had no problems at all with the cookie melting away.  I did cook them for about 16 minutes but probably should have cooked them a tad longer as some of the tops caved in and were a little wet/doughy on top.  Not a big deal because I frosted them with the Rich Chocolate Frosting from this site and you couldn't tell.  I'd definitely make these again - the kids thought they were really cool.

We loved these cupcakes.  My husband gobbled them right up...and after I sent them to his platoon I had other wives calling me and asking me for the recipe!  I used premade dough (i was a little short on time) and I used devil's food cake as per another reviewers suggestion and frosted them with chocolate buttercream.  They were delicious!!!

These were great and super easy to make. I used the Devils food mix from DH and Pilsbury dough, topping it off with Choc. Frosting. We've got a lactose intolerance in our house so it's nice to have such a sweet treat and not have to worry about milk (use Duncan Hines)!  The centers were sunken in in about half of them and some of the centers were hollow with dough all around. Not sure  how that happened but supermoist and yummy!
