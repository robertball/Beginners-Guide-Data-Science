The smell was good but after cooking it the minimum suggested amount of time it was slightly tough and didn't have much of a citrus or spice taste. Also the water all boiled away leaving me with a mess of burned spices at the bottom of the pot. I would definitely watch this more closely next time and find some type of sauce or marinade for it.

This dish smelled so good while it was cooking! The end result is an ok tasting pork chop that doesn't look very good too pale. You will need something to go with it. I served these with Citrus Salsa(from Splenda) that I found on this site. That made the dish.

Having read other reviews about the pork being bland or lacking flavor I decided to try marinating the pork in the steaming liquid before cooking. I marinated it for about 3 hours. It did improve the appearance but the flavor was still not intense enough. The pork definitely needs a sauce or salsa to go with it. I did not try the Citus Salsa one other reviewer used but the next time I will.

Although this recipe was quick and easy we felt that the pork needed to be served with some kind of sauce. The chops were very tender but also very bland.

I agree; the final product came out tasting like steamed pork and not much else. I detected neither orange nor spices in it. It does need a sauce so I improvised one: 2 parts worcestershire sauce 4 parts light cream 2 parts orange juice 1 part lemon juice I mixed them all together and heated themto the point where the edges just started to bubble then turned the heat down a little and reduced it to a reasonable sauce thickness. It worked rather well with the pork. Brought my rating up to a.

The pork cooked well and the scent was wonderful while cooking. Not enough of the spices wound up in the pork for added flavor.
