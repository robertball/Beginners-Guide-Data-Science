I followed the recipe, but decided to use 3 smaller-sized loaf pans (lightly buttered & floured) to bake. The total baking time was just under 35 minutes in a 350 oven. I'd increase the amount of blueberries next time (to a  generous cup), to make a larger volume of batter. I had more than enough batter for 2 loaves, but the third was a little skimpy (that one came out early and tasted as good as it smells). The loaves are a beautiful golden brown, and nicely risen. I cooled the breads in the smaller pans for 10-15 minutes, and then unmolded to finish cooling on a rack. I was looking for tea bread recipes for an event, and this makes a great start. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This bread was really good. I added extra blueberries but i think i added too many because it was difficult to slice, so if you add extra blueberries, don't add too much extra like i did. I think i might try making this into muffins so i dont need to slice, and maybe add a crumb topping..sounds yummy, Note: one large orange yielded exactly 1/2 cup fresh squeezed juice and more than enough zest.

My son ate this in just over a day, pretty much by himself.  The only change was that I used fresh squeezed orange juice from the orange I zested.

This recipe is terrific!  I was originally looking for lemon blueberry bread, but decided to make the orange because I already had them on hand.  The flavors go great together!  This had terrific flavor and texture!  I had some extra orange juice from the oranges I used, so I mixed in some confectioners sugar to make glaze and sprinkled on top!  Turned out great!

This bread is excellent.  Very easy to make and has a wonderful taste of orange with the blueberries.  The bread is moist with a crunchy outside.  Will definately make again!

This bread is delicious!  My husband loves blueberries and I love citrus and we both love this bread.  I added a full cup of frozen blueberries and it came out perfectly.  It baked up in an hour and we've enjoyed it for breakfast all weekend.  Thanks!

This is one of the best, most refreshing bread recipes I've ever tried!  I love it.  I've never had any kind of orange bread until I tried this and it is rapidly becoming one of my favorites.  This is going in the permanent recipe box!

We really enjoyed this bread.  It is good as written, but I wanted to make sure the orange flavor came through, so I also added 1/2 teaspoon of orange extract.  When the bread had cooled, I made an icing of orange juice, orange extract and powdered sugar.  I drizzled this over the bread, and it was so good.  The icing just adds that extra orange flavor as well as a little sweetness.

Made this on Game Day as Auburn University going for the National Championship uses orange and blue as their colors.  Served this at a retirement home and even non-football fans were tickled with the idea.  I was disappointed in the quality of the blueberries I had, they were very small and somewhat dried up, so I used all orange juice instead of water to make up for the flavor.  It still turned out very good.

Delicious, moist, and very easy to make!  I used slightly more than a cup of blueberries and no zest, and it was delightful.

I picked this recipe because I was intrigued that it only uses 2 TBSP of butter and 1 egg, as opposed to the usual 1/4 cup butter/oil with 2 eggs. The bread turned out delicious, very moist and with a nice crisp top. Instead of 2 cups all-purpose flour, I used 1-1/2 cup all-purpose with 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, and I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup. I used fresh squeezed orange juice from valencia oranges, and 1/2 TBSP of McCormick Valencia Orange Peel in place of the fresh grated orange peel. The bread tastes plenty orangey and not too sweet. Goes very well with tea. Great recipe!

I used this recipe to make cupcakes. They were good but on the dry side even though I slightly undercooked them. They also did not have nearly enough blueberries, even though I added a super heaping cup. I used juice from actual oranges but used dried zest and I don't think the orange flavor stood out as much as I would have liked. Not sure what this would turn out like as bread but as cupcakes, it needs a little tweaking! I love the idea of blueberry and orange though!

This is delicious bread. I've made it twice, first time with simply orange orange juice and added 1/4 cup extra blueberries, it was nice and moist. The second time I squeezed my own oranges and shaved my own zest and it has a way better orange flavor. Plus I used toasted almonds. Can't stop eating it!!!

Excellent flavor! I used 1 cup frozen blueberries, slightly thawed and drained, and only needed to bake for an hour.  A nice change from your typical breakfast bread varieties.

When I saw the ingredients, I thought it didn't have an enough amount of butter but I decided to believe the reviewers saying "moist".  So I didn't change the amount of butter and it turned out to be great!  I used 1 cup all-purpose flour and 1 cup whole-wheat flour instead of 2 cups all-purpose flour, and added 1/4 cup ground flaxseed.  I also used 1 cup candied lemon peel instead of 1 tbsp orange zest.  It took over an hour and a half to be done.  I checked the loaf several times with a wooden stick after 65 mins baking, and when the surface was getting harder, I covered the loaf with aluminum foil.  It prevented from burning but eventually the outside of the loaf got crunchy and inside was moist.  Overall, I like it!

This was on the right track but seemed kind of dry. Maybe it needs more butter or oil or something? Other than the dryness, the taste was yummy!

This is really yummy! I increased the berries to 1 cup and baked in a 9x5. Mine was done in only 50 minutes (good thing I checked!). The berries sunk to the bottom, even after coating with flour. But it still tastes great!

I can't stop eating this today! I don't have a loaf pan and baked it in an 8x8 pan for 50-55 minutes, and it worked well. I love orange but am not a huge fan of orange zest. I may cut that down next time, and use 1/2 or 1 T instead of 2T orange zest. I also think this would make fabulous muffins - that's the next project.

I used only 3/4 cup sugar, and increased the blueberries to a heaping cup, both of which made it better. :) I also had to use some whole wheat flour and some bread flour, so it probably didn't turn out exactly right, but it was pretty good.
