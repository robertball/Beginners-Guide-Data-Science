I will admit, when I read the directions and saw that I had to boil the meatballs in the water with the pasta I was very hesitant. The recipe turned out much better than I expected. My 3 Boys all gobbled it up! However, the next time I make this, I will follow the recipe with the exception of boiling the meatballs. Thank you for a great recipe!
