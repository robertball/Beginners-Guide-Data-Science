This is the BEST recipe. I used fat-free hazelnut cinnamon non-dairy creamer in place of the buttermilk and left out the hazelnuts. A friend of mine from London says they are very authentic scones. Thank you so much for posting this!

I have made these scones (minus the hazelnuts) several times for guests and they loved them and asked for the recipe.  I used 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips and that was plenty.  Enjoy!

This recipe is a new family favorite! I've long been searching for a scone recipe worthy of my favorite bakery scones, and this is the one. I will note however that for my taste the 1 1/2 teaspoons of almond extract is too much -- the almond flavor is so strong that it's like marzipan candy. I cut the amount in half and felt it was perfect, still noticeably an almond flavor but not overwhelming the other flavors. The full cup of chocolate chips will seem like overkill to many, but I'm a chocoholic so I was very pleased! It's also a lovely recipe made with dried cherries instead of chocolate chips.

This is a delicious scone recipe. Even my kids like this one. The chocolate chips and hazlenuts are a wonderful combination. Try this and you'll be hooked.

These are the BEST SCONES I've tasted yet... They are delicous. Although not as easy as they would appear to be you won't be sorry after you've tried them. The Almond extract stands out amazingly, and gives the dough an excellent taste. I only had 1/2 cup of chocolate chips, so I added in a half cup of cinnamon chips aswell. I also didn't have hazelnuts, so I used sliced Almonds instead. The results were incredible. One thing I would reccomend, though, is to lower down on the chips and nuts, unless you like your scones jam-packed with toppings. Another thing the instructions don't mention is that its probably smart to flour the dough on the cookie sheet so that they are less sticky when you put them in to bake. Lastly, I personally paint my scones with egg whites for color, but I think that's more optional than necessary. As they are, the directions are great and easy to follow; the scones are grade A+, I'll definitely be making these again.

i made these this morning and they were wonderful. i did make a few changes due to the reviews i read. i used vanilla carmel non dairy creamer instead of the buttermilk and i add 4tbsp of chocolate hazelnut spread when i cut in the butter. the hazelnut flavor was fantastic i think in part because of the spread. i will definately make these again.YUMMY

My dough was not sticky at all...my scones were done in about 14 minutes. Maybe I made a mistake. I think I accidentially left out the brown sugar. They tasted like biscuits and had the same texture- dry and crumbly. I shaped them into hearts for Valentine's Day by putting a glob of dough inside a cookie cutter on the baking sheet and smushing  it out into the shape. If I make these again, I hope they'll be better.

I baked these scones and brought them to work.  There was nothing but crumbs left within minutes.  Everybody loved them.  I actually realized I had no Buttermilk at the last minute so I replaced it with Half and Half and they still came out delicous!!  I will definitely make these again.

Except for the hazelnuts, which I didn't have, I followed the recipe exactly. These didn't turn out great for me, and not sure what I did wrong. They are a nice golden brown on top, but the insides are not completely done. There is also too much almond extract for my taste. I'll try them again, but use either less almond extract next time, or try vanilla instead. It gives me something good to work with.

These scones are a wonderful way to entice non-scone lovers to try something new.  Just go easy on the hazelnut/almond extract! (I used almond....very powerful stuff!)
Try them!

These were good, but basically tasted like a big chocolate chip cookie.  I was looking for something a little different in a scone.  But chocolate chip lovers will enjoy them.

I'm munching on these delicious scones right now, quite happy with my first attempt at making them.  Like many of the reviews said to do, I cut the almond extract down to 1/2 teaspoon.  I didn't have hazelnuts so I left those out but I did add about 1/2 tablespoon of Nutella and wow!! so worth it.  I also didn't have buttermilk so I put 1/2 tablespoon in a 1/2 measuring cup and filled the rest with half-and-half and I think that was fine.  Yum! Will make again, maybe with hazelnuts or dried cranberries next time.  I saw an episode of Desperate Housewives where Marcia Cross made these kind of scones with currants--maybe I'll try it with those next time.

I thought these tasted good. I knew when I seen 1 1/2 tsp of almond extract it was way too much! I ended up using only 1/2 tsp. The scones still had a slight strong almond extract smell and taste to me. I probably should have done a scant 1/2 tsp. I thought it was a lot of chocolate to, as I don't normally think of scones as being that sweet or rich. I think the chocolate chips would be better reduced. I would have like to have tried just using mini chocolate chips. It may have seemed like less. To make the circle I just traced a 9" cake pan on parchment and flipped it over. Overall, these are very fast to make and they really are the scone version of a chocolate chip cookie.

I just made these and they are going fast. I made a few, minor changes. Substituted margarine for the butter, and sliced almonds for the hazelnuts. We like that these aren't too sweet, which I think is typical of a scone vs a cookie. The only problem I had was with the pre-cutting step. It was going to make a huge mess, so when they were done and while they were still warm, I punched straight down repeatedly with a silicon spatula to cut instead of trying to drag a knife across. Made a pretty clean cut that way. Quick way to satisfy a cookie craving and great with a cup of coffee. Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great recipe for customizing. I used the same basic recipe, only the changes I made were:
omit hazelnuts and choc chips, instead I added 1/2 cup currants and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts, and I added a couple of dashes of baking spice (Penzeys) and changed the almond extract to 1 ts vanilla, 1/2 ts almond.  These were wonderful and my family scarfed them all down. I'm lucky I even got one!

These were GREAT! I have made them twice, and i left out the hazelnuts both times (only because I didn't have any on hand) but I'm sure they would be good with the hazelnuts! I used mini chocolate chips once and regular ones the other time, and both times they turned out wonderful. My family loved them and I will definately make them again!

Great recipe. Followed it pretty closely. Changed the buttermilk to vanilla coffee creamer - and learned how to shell walnuts along the way! Make sure that you chop up the hazelnuts so they spread throughout the scone. Not too sweet. Great with milk or some hot coffee :)

These were very good.  I didn't have hazelnuts so I used pecans.    I had to bake them a little longer than stated but nonetheless, they were wonderful.  Thank you for the recipe.

I used this as a base for my peanut butter-chocolate chip-oat scones and it was delicious!  I used 1 1/4 c flour and 1 c ground oats, 1 T of baking powder, no soda, a dash of cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla, and a combo of 1/2 c PB and only 2 T butter.  One of my new favorites!

I made these without the hazelnuts OR chocolate chips and used 2 tspns of almond extract and thought they were great. Next time I will try adding some hazelnut liquor since hazelnuts are kind of hard to find in the regular grocery store. Very nice recipe that makes a nice amont.

These taste so good! I had never made scones before, and I was very happy with the result. I was a bit confused with the fact that the directions state to cut the scones into wedges twice. A bit more explination would have been helpful. I will be making another batch soon to bring to a meeting at work.

these were pretty good.  I made them with almonds instead of hazelnuts and used mini choco chips.  My co-workers and husband liked them.  I also divided them into rounds instead of triangles.

Yummy! These were great scones! I didn't have buttermilk so I used coffee creamer but I followed the rest of the recipe as written.  Will make again soon!

I just made these and they turned out to be pretty tasty. I used only a 1/2 cup of chocolat chips and 1/2 cup of pecans (for the hazelnuts), but I would probably use slightly less chocolate chips in the future. 

Overall they were moist and just the right level of sweet! I still prefer working with scone recipes that have dough that is less sticky though. This was definitely a good recipe to try out!

Very easy & delish. I used almonds instead of hazelnuts bc it's what I had on hand & vanilla extract instead of almond extract since I also didn't have any almond extract.

Delicious scones! I used 3/4 tsp. almond extract (any more would've been overpowering I think), and 1/4 c. plain yogurt and 1/4 c. half and half in place of the buttermilk because I didn't have any. Also, the recipe calls for cutting the scones twice; I believe it would be best to cut them before baking them rather than after.

If I could give this recipe more than five stars, I probably would.  Perfect texture, nice combination of sweetness, SUPER YUMO!  Only change I made was to decrease almond extract to 1/2 t. and bake on parchment paper for a snappy clean up. This recipe is also a perfect base for different combinations.  I used cherries and toasted sliced almonds.  You could use anything. LOVED THIS RECIPE!

Great recipe!  I used my food processor to cut in the butter because im lazy, and I made mine with white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts (its what I had on hand).  To quote my husband:  "I really like these! They aren't hockey pucks!"

These are very good scones, specifically  for people who aren't die-hard scone lovers.  I agree with the comment about almond extract, it is very powerful stuff, I would suggest cutting back on it a little bit.

I made these last night and took the advice of someone that said to use hazelnut creamer instead of the butternmilk and leave out the nuts. I also added a tiny bit more brown sugar to make them just a little sweeter. Although they were very yummy....I really did not taste the hazelnut at all. To me they just tasted like big chocolate chip cookies. I did the drop method and got about 2 dozen. All in all...they were very good.

Wow these were great! I altered it a bit to suit my tastes. I used 1 cup all purpose flour and 1 cup pastry flour. I didn't use hazelnuts or chocolate. Instead I put in about 3/4 cup of frozen (rinsed) blueberries. I still included the almond extract. It was a bit tricky getting the blueberries mixed in without too much bleeding, but not too hard. They were so GOOD! Oh yeah, and I brushed them with some watery egg before baking. They took about 16 minutes. YUM!

I didn’t add the hazelnuts and when I made it the second time I made it with Camille extract instead. My family loves these scones because it has a good consistency and goes great with the chocolate chips. :)

Loved this flavor!  Very easy to make - threw it together in under 20 minutes and got it into the oven.  Used a pastry blender to incorporate frozen butter chunks.  Once all ingredients were together I used my hands to bring dough together.  It wasn't sticky until after I did this.
I always read some of the reviews before I get started in case there's overwhelming consensus that a modification should be used for better results.  Oddly, this is the first time that I was struck by the number of reviews that really were different than the original recipe.  Some people get upset about that - rating a recipe it turns out you didn't really make because it was so different.  This time I have to agree.  There are tons of scone recipes available - and ones that could be considered a template for variation.  This one seems to be a specific flavor rather than a template for making scones (not that it can't be but if not "hazelnut chocolate chip" it's a different scone recipe)  so I was put off by so many different versions of this.  For sure, sub if you need to, but rate this version. 
I made as recipe called for with suggested modifications: 1/3 cup mini chips , and 1/2 tsp almond extract.  Buttermilk was made with milk and 1/2 tbsp white vinegar.
I can see why nutella is so popular - hazelnut and chocolate is delish together.

I love the recipe so much that I use it as a base for my other scone flavors. I have done a blueberry orange scone, by omitting the chocolate chips and hazelnuts and replacing them with about 3/4 cup frozen blueberries, and the zest from a medium sized orange. I also use 1/2 cup milk instead of buttermilk, just because I don't usually have any buttermilk in the fridge. Turns out delicious after baking 17 mins. at 400 degrees F. Wonderful recipe!

Followed the recipe except for the egg which I am allergic to, so used Bird's Custard powder as replacement.  Also added a tablespoon of Torani hazelnut syrup which adds some sweetness and intense hazel nut flavor. Turned out great. The family loves them.

Used semisweet chocolate squares cut up, toasted the hazelnuts and replaced buttermilk w/coconut milk and a bit of squeezed lemon juice as that's what we had.  Also put large granules of sugar on top for crunchiness.  Everyone declared it a winner.

Delicious. No changes except that I would incorporate a little more flour next time because they were very sticky. I only use 1/2 tsp. almond and 1/2 tsp. vanilla. Next time no almond, it's too overpowering and takes away from the hazelnut flavor.

This was the best recipe for scones I have found.  The scones were very light in texture.  Any others I have eaten, whether homemade or commercial, were very dense and usually on the dry side.  The only thing I would change is the baking time.  I think 20-23 minutes would be a better length of time.  I baked them for the suggested time of 19 minutes, and the very center of the circle was still a little soft.  I also used pecans and they were equally as good as hazelnuts.

Made exactly as directed, but I didn't have buttermilk in the house.  Instead, I added 1 1/2 tsp lemon juice into my half cup measuring cup, then filled the rest of the measuring cup with milk. I let that sit while I mixed all the other ingredients, then added where the directions indicate buttermilk. Turned out great!

Outside was nicely browned but inside was still a little off. I will make it again but with some modifications. I won't use nearly as many chocolate chips. I think that may be part of the reason the insides were so soft.

These scones are wonderful! The only things I changed was to use vanilla extract along with the almond. :)

Excellent!  I did not have hazel nuts or almond extract, so used sliced almonds and vanilla.  They are really yummy!  I will make these again and again.

Used Toasted Cacao Nibs and toasted hazelnuts. It wasn't as sweet but the kidlets loved it. Next time I will have to use the chocolate chips.

I make this recipe every year during cherry season.  I add halved sweet cherries and substitute 1 cup of whole wheat flour for one of the cups of flour.  They are delicious.

Really really good...I took everyone else's advice and cut the extract to 1/2 tsp and put in about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips, and they are perfectly sweetened. Great consistency, not too sticky when I put the dough on the cookie sheet, and came out fluffy and perfectly cooked at 17 minutes. Great recipe, seems easy to alter with different ingredients, want to try almonds and dried cherries next.

First time making scones and these are wonderful!  I couldn't believe they turned out as I made a complete mess while making them - lost some flour out of the bowl, realized I didn't have buttermilk (used half and half and skim milk instead), and made an even bigger mess cutting the dough.  Mine were a bit smaller, so only took about 14 minutes to bake and were great!  Far more forgiving recipe than I expected!  Will make again for sure!

Fantastic!  I substituted white chocolate chips and crasisins for the add-ins and left out the almond extract.  I also ran out of white flour so used half whole wheat.  They were delicious!  Have made them twice now.

Excellent!  I used the dough blade on my food processor to cut in the butter (very easy!) and mini-chocolate chips.  Even my picky 6 year old loves them. :)

more like a c.c. muffin than the type of scone I was after. Too much almond extract as well, next time I'll use less. They have a good chocolate taste and were pretty quick and easy so I might make again.

One of the rare times I followed the instructions exactly, especially since it was my first time making scones.  I had my doubts as I was pressing it into the pan because it seemed a crumbly mess, but it came out great.  Fluffy, almond-y, sweet, nice contrast of textures.

Perfect for something quick and really good.  I added to the base chocolate chips, vanilla and pecans.  In 20 minutes it was happily all gone by friends and family who all wanted more.  I will use the base to make others, lemon, apples etc. Thanks for this recipe.

I have made these 3 times this week.  I love them and have been sharing with friends. I haven't tried with hazelnuts yet, but can imagine it would taste great! I make on a rectangle baking stone. they cook perfectly and are non stick!

Good texture and flavor.  Took them to work and all enjoyed.  Had a difficult time finding hazelnuts..in fact, never found them.  Substituted almonds and flavor was good.

This was the best scone recipe I've ever made!  The dough is a little sticky at first, but after a while it becomes workable.  I drizzled a little frosting over the top of these scones, and they turned out delicious!  Would recommend these to any person that has a sweet tooth in the morning!
