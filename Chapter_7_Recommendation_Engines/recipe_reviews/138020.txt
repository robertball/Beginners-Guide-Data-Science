This was very tasty. I forgot to salt the cabbages' cooking water, so salt was added to the hot milk; this allowed the salt to dissolve & be incorporated when folding all ingredients together. Digestion tip: Raw onions/scallions contain enzymes that help digest cooked potatoes, so always a good idea to add them somehow in raw form ~ as a garnish in this case.

Every Ervery Good...I thought at first my head of cabbage was way to much for the 3 pounds potatoes.....nope worked out very well. I love this dish....My neighbors as well. I'm not going to count my son on this, we already new he doesn't like corn beef. But it was superb!!!

I had never eaten colcannon but my husband had & he thought this was good.  I also enjoyed it & it was soooo easy.  I used buffalo pastrami from Costco which is free of nitrates & nitrites.  My husband said a little apple cider vinegar sprinkled over each helping was a common addition.  This gave it a little more flavor which we liked.

Kale tastes better than cabbage & is more traditional.  I prefer using bacon rather than corned beef or leaving it out all together and having the colannon along side sliced corned beef.  Personal preference is for the red potatoes used here rather than peeling all those Irish white potatoes.

I've never had colcannon before but it tastes yummy to me. I used bacon instead of cornbeef (didn't have any) and cooked the onions and garlic in the bacon grease along with the butter.

This was excellent! I've made again with cottage roll ham which was equally as good. I absolutely love red potatoes. So now when i'm boiling potatoes, half way through cooking, I add chopped up cabbage, strain and mash together with the butter, milk and pepper. What a great way to get everyone to eat cooked cabbage!

I used organic red potatoes, increase the garlic to an obscene amount, used a whole large bunch of green onions and I didn't need all the hot milk. I used hot fat free evaporated milk to give it a richer and creamier flavor. Yummy. The ton of butter was just......yeah.....great addition!

This was good and liked by my dinner guests.  Everyone in my party thought it needed more salt (I went light after reading a review saying it was too salty).  I also thought a whole head of cabbage was too much, but it was okay.  I also used corned beef from the deli.

Very good and very filling! 1lb was too much meat for me so I cut it down a bit - to about 3/4lb, but even 1/2lb would be enough.

I thought this was rather bland.  I guess it's a good way to use up leftovers, but it lacked taste.

We loved it too...easy to make...great taste. We used ham and leek instead off onions. It would make great potato side dish in parties. Will do again. It definitely tastes better than it looks...:)

Great comfort food.  I doubled the corned beef and added 1 T of salt and some sauteed sweet onion w/butter to add a bit more flavor.  Yum.

Not bad but next time I'll decrease the amount of corned beef and increase the cabbage.  Nice flavor though.

This is the best colcannon recipe I have found to date. The only thing I would change would be to add more salt for seasoning. The amount of milk seemed to make this a little bland.

First, the only reason I gave it 3 stars was because I can't seem to get on with large portions of cabbage in meals. I omitted it as a result, but made the rest of the recipe, substituting sliced leeks for cabbage.

Delicious!  I made the red potatoes and onion (I added 3/4 of a vidalia onion) with the corned beef in the slow cooker then took them out and mashed and chopped them (one less pot).  I used bacon.  I sauteed the cabbage and bacon together to save time.  Sprinkled the scallion on top when serving.  Great comfort food!
