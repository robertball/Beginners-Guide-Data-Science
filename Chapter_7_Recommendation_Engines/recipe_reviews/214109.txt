I don't know why I didn't mention this but the reason I don't boil the fruit is I always use frozen fruit.  Most fruit cooks up soft once it has been frozen.

I used blackberries (and 2 Tbsp sugar) for the fruit, but followed the topping recipe exactly.  It came out beautifully.  Really simple, but delicious.  More cake-like than cobbler -- would work well with most fruit.  Highly recommend!

My family loved this little desert! I wasn't sure that my 11 and 12 year old granddaughters would like it but, they thought it was great. I was thinking it would make a wonderful base for Strawberry Shortcake when we can get good Michigan Strawberries in June. Can't wait to try it that way.

Without additional sugar mixed with the rhubarb, it's really really sour.

I tried this recipe last night for a girl 's night out potluck. The others and I really liked it. I did boil the rhubarb with maybe a teaspoon of sugar, and I added strawberries, about 2 cups of them as well.  I also mixed the batter and the fruit together mainly because I like fruit dispersed throughout my baked goods. If I hadn't mixed them, I would have served it like an upside down cake. Overall god recipe and I will try it again with peaches since they are now in season.
