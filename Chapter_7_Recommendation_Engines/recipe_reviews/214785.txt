This was really delicious!! I was not sure about the combination of flavors in this dish, but everything worked very well together and it was very easy. Other reviewers were right about it being salty-the next time I make it, I will lower the amount of garlic salt and add garlic powder to replace it because I think the bacon grease adds a key flavor component to the dish. Also, because I did not have horseradish sauce, I mixed up my own with horseradish, mayo, a touch of vinegar and pepper (you could make it with sour cream too, but I have a dairy issue). One other thing that I did was streamline in terms of pans used. I cooked the bacon in the microwave, then poured off the drippings. Also, I used a broiler safe skillet, and rather than move everything to a baking dish, I just added the final ingredients to the pan and put it under the broiler. It tasted amazing and dirtied fewer dishes! We will definitely be making this again-thank you so much for the recipe!!

I liked the concept of this recipe and will make again. However, as a few reviewers noted, salty as is.  When you first begin making the recipe you do not realize that the scallops will be smaller once cooked.  Then your eating 50/50 bacon and scallops. You do not need to add salt at all!!  I can not imagine how this would have tasted had I added salt. Next time I might double the scallops and reduce the bacon to 3 slices.

Great recipe!! A unique idea with the horseradish sauce ... was a bit skeptical of it when I read the recipe but the taste was outstanding! Great also as appetizers on toothpicks.

Delicious and so easy...Family loved them.. I would recommend mixing in the horseradish sauce so it is evenly incorporated throughout the dish. Served with a caesar salad and twice baked potatoes.  Definate keeper!!

original recipe is ridiculously salty but fixable.  replace the garlic salt with garlic powder and cut the bacon portion in 1/2.

These are seriously delicious.  I  love scallops but my husband isn't a big fan so I've been trying to find a recipe that we can both like and share.  I made a tester batch last night as an appetizer and he really loved them.  I think that having a good quality horseradish sauce is key to this recipe.  Thanks for making my husband and I scallop compatible!  : )

My husband LOVES this dish!  I had bought some beautiful (HUGE) sea scallops and some fresh horseradish...I don't know if I'd make it for an entree again though, it's so rich but so tasty...I ate too much!  Can't wait to try it for an appetizer!

this had great flavor but a little too salty.  i think leaving the bacon drippings out might have helped.  other than that it was a great recipe!  loved the horseradish.

Made this dish as directed. It was very salty.  I would ommit the garlic salt and use fresh garlic.  Also I would have preferred they more spicey.  I would use more horseradish next time.

Awesome recipe!  Only thing I did differently was make in in a cast iron skillet so I could throw it in the oven and only clean 1 pan (lazy as I am with 2 small kids!) It was soooo good hubby said he would eat it 4 times a week! Thanks for this one!!!

This was a very good way to prepare scallops.  It was easy and fast and the end result was delicious!  I would have given it 5 stars but it was very laden w/calories!  Still, I'm sure I will make it again, probably after I run the marathon!

I think I screwed this recipe up. I'd never cooked scallops before, and I think I over baked them a little. Even so, it was still very good. Would definitely try to make it again and correct my first time mistakes.

very good!  A bit tricky cooking scallops just right (don't cook in too much liquid or they won't brown).  The horseradish sauce was a great addition, will spread it across tops next time instead of just a drizzle.

Wrap bacon around scallops instead of crumbling.  All the same though.

Loved this. Such a nice surprise - i made as directed and placed it on a bed of rice and peas.  Really wonderful!  Strangely enough. I just had horse radish in the jar. ( no sauce) So i used what i had - plain hot horseraddish  just about 2 tablespoons Placed in oven as directed.   So while it was not creamy.  It was really devine placed on top of the rice.   I had the large scallops you get from costco.  Will try next time with sauce but - this way was really yummy too!

I would make a couple changes.  Instead of garlic salt, use fresh minced garlic and a pinch or two of sea salt.  I would also take that green onion pictured (but not included in recipe) and add it to the sauce.  I would also add some course ground black pepper, just 1/4 tsp mainly for the visual effect it would add.

I used fresh garlic, lots of it, and made more of the butter/bacon/horseradish (my own ratios) sauce and used small scallops. It was delicious over brown jasmine rice and topped with scallions.  Will make it again.

I made this last night and let me just say it was OUTSTANDING! I've made several scallop dishes over the years but never with horseradish sauce in the mix... WOW!!! What an awesome addition indeed... SO good that even my usually unimpressed husband was undoubtedly impressed. The nice crunchy texture of the bacon and scallions went perfectly with the melt in your mouth texture of the scallops... and then, the bit of zing from the horseradish took this way over the top! I had to gain control of myself and step away from the table to avoid the urge to lick my plate clean!

These were great! Easty to prepare & cook. I would mix the horseradish sauce up & pour over scallops, the sauce made the dish! My BF loved these & could not rave enough about the dinner.

These were amazing! Beacause of other reviewers saying it was a little too salty, I didn't add the bacon drippings. I did use 8 pieces of bacon instead of five. I made my own horseradish sauce with mayo, sour cream and bottled horseradish. If you like scallops you will love this easy recipe!!

I followed the suggestions of others completely omitting the garlic salt and It was delicious! Served with some pasta on the side and served the sauce with the scallops on top.

Fantastic recipe. Made it twice in one week because at the request of the men in my family. I didn't have garlic salt, so I used garlic powder and kosher salt which I had in the pantry. Served over sauteed spinach as pictured. Since the scallops cook so quickly, I made the spinach first, kept it warm on my serving platter is a slightly warm oven; less than 10 minutes later, scallops were ready to place on top of spinach...then dinner time...mmm...mmmm! Recipe was so easy...so quick...and so good.  Thank you.

Not a good flavor combo for tender tasty scallops, would be great on steak or a baked potato but not $18/fresh scallops as it’s way too overwhelming. Unfortunately I learned the hard way.

Special restaurant quality! Thanks so much for this recipe, it is permanent in my recipe favorites. I apologize for slight modifications, it was perfect as written! I happened to have some homemade creme fraiche (Chef John’s, this site) so I made the homemade horseradish sauce (also Chef John’s, this site) and that was a very good decision. I also used fresh minced garlic rather than garlic salt, thinking the bacon would add all the salt needed, also good decision.

Oh my. So delicious! I used Chef John's recipe for homemade horseradish sauce rather than store bought.. that was awesome too. I used fresh garlic rather than garlic powder and left out all salt except what naturally occurring in bacon. I took a tip from others and used 3 slices bacon for a lb of scallops.  Will definitely be making this again

I made this as detailed except did not use any garlic. I added a couple tablespoons of sour cream to the horseradish  and drizzled before broiling. NO added salt needed. I used organic uncured bacon. Father's Day dinner with a fresh pineapple /raisin coldslaw with ginger mandarin dressing and wild rice. It was a hit.

This was wonderful. I used to cast-iron skillet to sear so there was no reason to transfer to casserole dish to broil. Just went straight to the broiler. It's like scallops wrapped in bacon without all the work. We definitely make again.

Amazing! Favorite way to do scallops! Used bacon left over from breakfast and used 2 cloves fresh garlic instead of garlic salt. Since I used salted butter and bacon didn't add any other salt. Added green onions to top and it's a favorite of ours now! And ready in just minutes!

After reading a few other reviews first, I used garlic powder, no salt and added a pinch of curry powder just for fun. It was pretty good. I expected the horseradish to go better with the curry, but like I said, it was just a tiny bit. I really like the idea of the flavor combination though and I will definitely try it again. Plus, now my apartment smells like bacon!

I would just change the garlic salt content. It was too salty, so I'd have a third of the original amount because the bacon is salty, and the horseradish adds another element of salty/sour/spicy that made it a bit overwhelming. Otherwise great recipe for scallops.

I wasn't successful with this recipe, but I know where I messed up.  My scallops were frozen.  When I put them into the  bacon grease/butter/Garlic powder pan, it got watered down.  Thus, it took way more than 4 minutes to cook, because I was waiting for the water to boil out.  

Bottom line:  Make sure your scallops are THAWED!

One of my favorites.  All the tastes of bacon wrapped scallops, in less time.  Horseradish sauce takes it to another level

OMG the best yet.  For those who said it was to salty the way to change that is use unsalted butter and fresh  minced garlic.  If they were not so expensive in my neck of the woods would make them every night!! I used huge scallops and quartered them but at 20 bucks a  pound only used a half pond:-)

I made some fairly decent adjustments to this recipe after reading reviews about the saltiness (and because i was lacking some ingredients), but my final product came out fantastic.  First, I used pancetta instead of bacon.  Second, I used about two cloves of fresh garlic instead of garlic salt.  Third, I used red pepper flake,and added it in when I sautéed the garlic, in place of the horseradish.  I think those flavors melded really well and gave the scallops more of an Italian flair.  I served them over basmati (or jasmine?) rice and they tasted great.  I could also image they would be really tasty served over pasta.

I did not care for this recipe. I bit into them and the first taste was good, and then it got bitter. I don't know what I did wrong--I may have overcooked them. I cooked the scallops in butter and garlic powder (not bacon drippings as I just baked turkey bacon). I will try this again. My chef friend said to cook in olive oil until light brown and turn. I'm not giving up; this is only my first time having scallop.
