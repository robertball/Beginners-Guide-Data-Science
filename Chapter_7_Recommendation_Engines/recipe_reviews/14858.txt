Coming from a family of olive-enthusiasts (as children we even received olives in our stockings), I found this recipe quite pleasing and easy to put together. I did take other reviewers' suggestions, and added garlic & lemon zest.  I will make again, and plan on passing the recipe to my brothers. Cheers!

This is just awesome, but I LOVE OLIVES!!  Very easy to put together and the olives are very tasty with all the seasonings.

Really delicious and easy!  I also added the garlic, lemon zest, and a few dashes of hot pepper flakes for extra oomph...

We LOVED these! The flavors worked so well together. Next time I make them, I too will add some sliced fresh garlic. Thanks so much, Sir Pellinore!

I tweaked this recipe a bit but the basic concept is a good one.  I added rosemary, garlic, lemon zest, red pepper flakes, kosher salt, and a coating of good olive oil.  Let them sit overnight to let the flavors meld.  Bet you can't eat just one!

Good Start - but so much more potential! I combine the olives, bay leaves, sprig of rosemary (dried didn't work so well for me!), lemon peel, juice of lemon, capers, red pepper flakes and a little rice vinegar. Throw it in the fridge and forget about it. I left it for 2 weeks, then could not pop these in my mouth fast enough, in fact I did not even share! Then I took the left overs and put in food processor for a FABULOUS Tapenade!!! Even try with some anchovies for a pop of flavor. WOW!

This is an easy and cheap way to serve up olives at your next gathering. These are better than what you can buy at the store and much cheaper.

I did not care for this recipe. Vinegar was all I could taste.

YUMMY! These are in the fridge awaiting the Christmas celebration this evening and they are AWESOME! I'm going to have to stay away from the fridge:) I also am an olive lover and would recommend this simple and quick recipe.
