This is not a cookie.  It's a muffin disguised as a cookie.  I was very disappointed with it.  It tasted ok, however the appearance was not very attractive.

This was not good! We even tried baking them as muffins after we saw the first few cookies bake. They were quite bland and gray in color. Not appetizing.SAVE YOUR BLUEBERRIES!!!!

other than the really disgusting apperance, they taste "OK". Def. need the frosting or something to make them sweeter. I baked one batch at 15 min. and another at 12 min.--need to bake longer for a firmer taste and appearence. My husband said he'd still eat them!

Definitely reminded me of a blueberry muffin, but still good.  I melted buttercream frosting and glazed each for added sweetness.  They were gone in 3 days :)

Very tasty!! More like a muffin though. I made it w/o almonds and made creamcheese frosting for it to give it a more sweet taste.
