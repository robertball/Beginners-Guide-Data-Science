An easy and tasty enough breakfast to fix. My only change was to use unsweetened vanilla almond milk rather than cow's milk. It seems to be only one serving, however, rather than two.

I think a banana would have been better. I didn't like the crunch of the seeds in every sip. The flavour was good though. Just the right amount of everything. Nothing really to complain only my preference on the texture.

This is the first time I have made this and I think I overdid it on the peanut butter. I also used fresh strawberries instead of frozen. But for something that is completely sugar-free and easy to make. I will definitely be making this again. With a few adjustments next time.
