We loved this recipe. I am all about shortcuts so I did use Cream of Chicken Soup in place of all the ingredients that go into making the sauce (chicken stock, flour, and whipping cream). A true foodie would not be satisfied with this, but we thought it was delicious.

Delicious. All I had was corkscrew pasta, so I used that. 

The ONLY thing I would change would be to double or even triple the sauce ingredients. We like a lot of sauce.

Made this by the recipe however I donâ€™t understand the need to butterfly the chicken. I Think tenders would work well. The sauce was yummy. I did cook the chicken in the oven @ 450 degrees instead of frying it.

This was really good, I used chicken fingers, they were moist and melted in your mouth.  Sauce was excellent...this was even better the next day for lunch!  Keeping this one!
