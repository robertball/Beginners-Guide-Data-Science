I made this for the first time for a very "particular" group for Thanksgiving - everyone RAVED, made it again for an office open house/holiday party and they all thought it was catered. I put this in a sourdough round bowl and scattered baquette slices around it. Tastes great, best I've had - I think the secret is the water chestnuts, everyone asks what's in it!

Most excellent!  The only thing that I changed was I used 1 c. shredded chedder cheese and I used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 miracle whip and about 1 c more sour cream.  Very good.  Mine went first and the others were left.  Will use this again.

I think it could use slightly less mayo and maybe a tad more sour cream--so it's a bit more equal proportions of each.  But it is a really delicious dip.  I served with Italian bread and Ritz crackers as well.  Mmmm!!!

I really liked this spinach dip.  This will be my standard  recipe from now on.  I thought it was a little too salty though, once I cut down a little bit on the mayonnaise.  I increased the sour cream and that helped.

Although I used 15 oz. of frozen spinach instead of the fresh spinach, the recipe turned out wonderfullly.  Really was a success a two parties.  Tastes even better after being chilled overnight and the soup mixes have had time to meld with all the other ingrediants.

Absolutely fantastic. I've made it for the last few years and everyone always loves it. Tastes the best when  refrigerated overnight before serving.

I make this same dip with frozen chopped spinach that has been thawed and drained and it is always well received.  It is great served with Hawaiian bread.

Best spinach dip I've ever made.  Loved the fact that it uses fresh spinach instead of frozen, as fresh is all I ever have on hand.  Made it for a small dinner party, and everyone asked for the recipe!

I used frozen spinach instead of fresh and cut back on the amount of mayo to just under two cups. It turned out really well. If you're going to cut back on the mayo, I suggest you not put in all of the two soup mixes as it makes it a little salty. I'll definitely make this recipe again!

This recipe is honestly the BEST spinach dip I've ever had!  I had never made spinach dip before, but made it for a family gathering recently and the entire dip was GONE before dinner even started!  Everyone loved the fresh spinach (except my younger sister; she claimed that she liked the consistency of the frozen spinach better.)  The only thing I did differently is that I omitted the onion dip.  I thought it tasted just as amazing without it.  I'm making this again for my daughter's birthday party tomorrow!

I brought this to a dinner party this weekend. I doubled the amount of green onions because I know the people eating love them, and I used more of the veggie soup seasoning because the package I bought had more and I couldn’t measure it correctly. I had never made spinach dip before, but I will make it again because everyone raved. I think any future invites to events will be conditional of me agreeing to bring this.

Great! I used 1/2 cup of mayo and 2 cups of sour cream. I'm not crazy about mayo. Also I cut out the chestnuts.

Have made this many times but just never rated it before now.  I do sometimes change the ratio of sour cream to mayo, but other than that follow the recipe as written.

This is wonderful & easy to make :)  I have made on Halloween, Thanksgiving & Christmas and taken to several parties with my homemade bread, but it's also great with vegetables or crackers...I always get asked for the recipe and get several compliments... I have added 2 fresh diced jalapenos if I want to give it some heat, but the original way is wonderful!!!! **If you are someone who does not like that much mayonnaise just rotate the sour cream and mayo portions...

Holy onion.....this was sooo good tho. I did use frozen spinach. I'm not sure but looking back at this recipe I may have added too much onion soup. I put my entire packet in, which is 2oz. I also followed some of the reviews that stated there was too much mayo. But I didn't measure at all. My sour cream was a big 16oz. So I scooped half out and added an extra spoon full, then put 2 large spoon fulls of mayo. I thought it was a perfect consistancy. I also chopped up the water chestnuts to about "minced" size. This was absolutely amazing.

So..... if there is too much mayo, why not try adding more spinach. The recipe says a “bunch” of spinach.   That to me makes me think that one should eyeball the spinach to mayo ratio.  I LOVED this recipe and am proud to say I figured out the spinach to mayo/sour cream ratio just fine!

This was good but heavy on the mayo side for us.  I ended up adding additional sour cream and some greek yogurt to balance all the mayo.  I also did not have the onion soup mix so I used some minced dried onion and added some paprika and black pepper.  Will make this again with less mayo but loved the fresh spinach taste and color!

Best spinach dip I've had! I first tried preparing it with one cup mayo and the quoted amount of sour cream (and no water chestnuts - blecch) but agreed with other reviewers who said it was too mayonnaise-y so I doubled the sour cream and left it at one cup mayo. Through continued experimentation and taste testing, I ended up using a full packet of both dip dry mixes, a heaping handful of fresh bagged spinach, and most of a bunch of green onions (diced, not stalks).

Probably would have been better with bread. Dipped it with Town House Focaccia rosemary & Olive Oil crackers. I used the veg. dry soup mix and not the onion, but still it had a strong onion taste, and there way WAY to much mayo. Over all good ingredients just check the measurements! :)

First time using fresh instead of frozen. Was great. Used my own frozen vegetables partially cooked and chopped fine. Used equal parts of ranch, sour cream, and mayo. Did not have water chestnuts, but will use next time

Tasted great! Reduced the amount of mayo though, we always use about 1 3/4 C of mayo instead. People rave about this dip at potlucks.
