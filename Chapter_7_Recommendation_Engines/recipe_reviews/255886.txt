I'm pretty sure I've used this recipe before, probably right off of the oatmeal box.   The flavor of these cookies is just perfect, and I love them!  

This time, I used coconut sugar in place of the brown sugar (I have a huge container to use up).  I also used golden raisins.   I also used a cookie scoop which is probably a little bigger than it ought to be.  I got two dozen really big, fat, cookies.  I baked them twelve minutes, and it probably should have been more like 14 minutes.

This is the second time I've made these. They are crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside using old fashioned oats! Only issue even making rounded teaspoon size cookies is the time...they took 14" to bake.

Not sure what happened here but these were terribly dry and kept nearly the same shape as the tablespoon sized scoop that I used to place them on the cookie sheet.  I double checked all of my ingredients because the dough did not even seem right before baking it.  I can't say if this is the exact recipe that has been on the back of the oatmeal container as I used another brand of organic quick cooking oats but I used to make that recipe all the time and it was phenomenal.  I am disappointed since I had planned to take them to a potluck and they hardly seem worthy.

I like big cookies and I use a big ice cream scoop, they take 14 mins to cook and they’re still nice and soft inside. I used kosher salt too.

Nice flavor but even though I followed the recipe exactly, they never spread out. I had to bake an additional 4-5 minutes to fully cook.

Great cookie!  Made following recipe exactly.  Next time may add increase cinnamon or make all the sugar brown sugar just to add a bit more flavor.  But otherwise very very good!

Followed the recipe with the only change being to add 2 teaspoons of MAPLE extract rather than one teaspoon of VANILLA extract.  They come out best (with my oven) to bake for 13 minutes rather than 8 - 10.  Fantastic, as usual, with slightly crunchy edges and soft chewy centers.

I am not one for oatmeal raisin, but these cookies never last long in my house. My fiancee loves them! I have made these a few times now, only adding a hint of nutmeg maybe once this last time. They live up to the name

I made this and added a little twist by making it a protein versions. I added high protein granola, cranberries, cinnamon sugar and maple flavor to give it a sweeter taste. Now it's over 14grams of protein.

Made the cookies as is. Came out well. Top rack cookies came out well. Bottom rack was slightly over brown. The dough can get real hard so you need a strong blender or arm to mix well.

Best oatmeal raisin cookies I've ever made. Adding a little nutmeg definitely made them tastier. Using regular baking sheets worked better than my stone. Mine took 14-16 minutes to bake.

Cookies came out perfect! First time making oatmeal cookies. Reduced white sugar to 2 tablespoons, extra teaspoon of vanilla, doubled the raisins and threw in a handful of chopped walnuts and chocolate chips. Divine! What can I say, the title is appropriate!

I found that it wasn't sweet enough and very dry.  I made both the cookies and the bar cookies.  I'm disappointed because they don't taste like the ones I made years ago from the Quaker Oats box.  I will make it again only I will add  more sugar and a little something to better hydrate the flour.

The cookies are good but not as sweet like the ones I remember my mom making. I made them exactly per recipe. They take way longer to bake than recipe states. I live in high altitude so maybe that’s why I had to bake them for 20+ minutes.

Great, basic foundation recipe for oatmeal cookies! I do mine with dried cherries and walnuts instead of raisins, and they’re always a huge hit!

These turned out perfect. I made one substitution.  I use caramel chips in place of raisins but that is because I don't like raisins in my cookies. I got almost 4 dozen out of the batch.

Excellent cookies!  I swapped out the raisins for cherries and since I'm a chocoholic I added a LOT of chocolate chips.  Totally yummy.

My first try at homemade oatmeal raisin cookies.  I used 8 tablespoons of butter and 6 of shortening, as that was what I had.  I made large cookies.  Will keep this recipe.

The cookies were very yummy. I did however need to bake them for @12 minutes. They just weren’t done before that. I doubled the recipe and got about 6+ dozen using a watermelon scoop for consistent sized cookies. I received compliments from all four groups with whom I shared them. I’ll definitely use this recipe again.

What an excellent cookie! Crunchy around the edges and moist in the middle, these cookies don’t last long in my house. I saw several comments that said these were too dry, so I reduced the oatmeal to 2 cups. Also used half golden raisins & half regular.

fairly easy, for a non-baker. Used Oat bran when I ran out of oats. Used red currants instead of raisins. Made about three dozen. They are tasty, nice texture, glad I tried it.

Yummy cookies but baker beware: 8-10 minutes IS NOT ENOUGH BAKING TIME. Baking them for 14-15 min at 350 is sufficient time. My first batch, I baked these 10 min and it wasn’t enough. 12 min made them brown at the edges and I thought they were perfect, they were crispy on the edges and tasted great. But, they weren’t done all the way and I got sick from them.

I made the bar cookie variation as described. It was okay, but I think this recipe would be better as the original drop cookie. It said to bake 30-35 minutes in a 9X13  pan, and I pulled them from the oven at 30 minutes. They were lightly browned on the bottom and sides. The edges and corners were slightly crispy (a GOOD thin in a cookie!). But I still think they were over baked. The center of the cookies were very dry and somewhat crumbly. If they were individual cookies, they would have more structural support from the crispy edges. As a bar cookie, they are thicker, drier and tended to fall apart in your hand. If I made them again, I'd pull them from the oven at 20-25 minutes. A cookie like this is better slightly under-baked rather than over-baked.

I think the base cookie dough recipe is sound, so I may do this again, but I'd stick to the drop cookie version and check them for doneness  early.

These cookies are wonderful!!!
I doubled the cinnamon in mine because I like a stronger cinnamon flavor. Also, I baked mine at 365 for 13 minutes for appropriate doneness. The cookies are soft and moist on the inside while being crispy on the outside.

So delicious! I split the batter up and made 1/2 with butterscotch chips and milk chocolate chips and the other 1/2 with dried cranberries, white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts. One type appealed more to the kids and the other to the adults.

Used Quaker Instant Oatmeal Cinnamon & Spice with double the vanilla.
Overwhelmingly scrumptious. Received rave reviews from all my tasters.

I followed the recipe exactly (substituting bittersweet chocolate chips for the raisins) and it was delicious, particularly after they cooled! Next time, I'll try adding some nuts, and I'd like to try the bar version.  I'll definitely be keeping this recipe!

The cookies were soft on the inside and light brown on the edges. I could bite through them with ease. It was an easy recipe and took 30 min to make. I would recommend because they are asking for a teaspoon of cookie I would cook for 10 instead of 8 mins

These were easy, but pretty boring. They are lacking something. I think it needs more spice and more sugar. I won’t use this recipe again.

Great cookies. Family loved them.

I did what other have posted. Baked for about 9 minutes and the bottom was golden brown, chewy inside and not dry. I increased the brown sugar to a cup and reducing the white sugar to 2 tbsp. Left the rest of the recipie the same. Made about 34 cookies total

Yummy perfect.I might just put two sticks of butter instead of one and three quarters next time I do it or I might not. It was really good. On a diet I made them to cheer up someone in my household and I meant to eat only  two  cookies but ended up eating five blew the diet. They are not gooey if you like gooey cookies they are crumbly. The way you put them on the tray is pretty much how they bake they don't melt down and grow. In my opinion that's why some people gave it a bad review. Also in the past I have burnt a lot of cookies these did not burn. I thought they tasted just perfect.

It was my first attempt and the cookies came out perfect. I followed the recipe with one minor change. I used 1 cup of brown sugar and only 2 table spoons of granulated sugar. I was able to make 30 - 2.5 inches cookies. Family loved how soft it turn out. Will make again for sure.

I omitted the cinnamon and added 1/4 cup of vegetable oil to my cookie dough. The cookies were DELICIOUS.  And I make my own homemade vanilla frosting for my Cookies. My whole family always enjoy them.

The actual temperature outside is a brisk -2, I was looking for a reason to turn the oven on, and I had all the ingredients. AWESOME IDEA! This recipe is going in my faves. I followed the basic directions, but split the extract quantity equally between vanilla and orange. I’m not a raisin fan, so used dried cranberries (1 cup) and pumpkin seeds (shelled, probably 1/2 cup). I also baked them closer to 14 min. than 10 on parchment (no trouble with sticking). Yielded a little over 4 dozen super yummy cookies and a warmer house!

I saw the note about adjusting for altitude and so changed to 1.75 cups flour, which I think was unnecessary, because I had to add 2tablespoons of butter and a splash of milk to make them stay soft. So I’d skip the extra flour next time! I used a cup of raisinets and half a cup of craisins, which was a great amount for fruit in each bite!

My first tone making cookies from scratch. This is the best trading and easiest recipe yet! I also made half a batch by using half of the ingredients.. they are super tasty and sweet like I like them! Also I added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, the flavor is on another level!

These cookies are the best! For added chew, I add 1/2 cup of diced dates and 1/2 cup of dried chopped cranberries along with a cup of raisins!!! If you like lots of chewy fruit in your cookies, you will love the added fruit! Sometimes I’ll even add extra spice; 1/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice and 1/4 tsp nutmeg!

I made these cookies today. Delicious. I did alter it due to gluten and dairy issues. I used apple sauce for the butter, gluten free all purpose flour and Quaker oats (gluten free). I didn't have dark brown sugar so I used coconut sugar. It didn't have a coconut taste. Cookies came out so soft. There are not many left. This recipe was easy and has been added to my list.

This was the recipe I was looking for from my childhood...really good.  I don't like raisins, so I added 1 c. coconut instead.  I did bake for a bit longer than the recipe called for, since I like the outsides crisp.

Really good! I am in high altitude and added more oats rather than flour.  Turned out perfect: soft in the middle and done just right on the outside.

These cookies are great! I've used the recipe twice now and they turn out fantastic. Slightly crunchy on the outside, but soft and chewy on the inside (my favorite!). Oatmeal Raisin Cookies are my husbands favorite and I'm glad I found this recipe. It's the only one I'll use now! (I did cook the cookies for 12-13 minutes.)

I read the reviews before I made them. I made it with all brown sugar and how we love cinnamon, I added 2 teaspoons instead of 1. They turned out very delicious. Slightly crunchy outside and soft inside. My family loved them. Great with some coffee - yum! I'll be making these again soon.

A definate keeper!
The only thing I amended was another 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and the cookies needed 12-14 minutes to cook.

Soft and chewy cookies if baked for only 9 min.  Not as spicy as I would like.  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup of  each. Next time I  will add a bit  more spice.  I used large flake oatmeal because that is all I had.  The cookies came out  just like the picture.  Also made  57 medium sized cookies.

I have made these cookies for years. Never have I found a  recipe that my family likes better. I have made them with chocolate chips or the raisins.  Both are great. Planning on making them next week for  Christmas.

We like them plain or with dried berries instead of raisins.
