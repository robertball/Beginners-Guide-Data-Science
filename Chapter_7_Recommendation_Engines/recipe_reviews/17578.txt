Grandma taught me how to make this cake from a very young age, she wanted me to appreciate how treats don't have to be over the top or need special ingredients. She used oleo (margerine) instead of bacon grease and she also added a teaspoon of nutmeg. Whenever I make this, I feel like I'm in the kitchen with Grandma all over again. This makes great muffins.

My family makes this with shortening and bakes it in a bundt style pan.  Then we serve it with caramel icing.  My mom still makes it for my birthdays.  Thanks for sharing.

My Mother made this for years. She called it "Poor man's fruitcake". Thank you for posting this and letting me carry on a family tradition at Christmas.

I more than doubled the amount of bacon grease and just made it in the dirty cast iron pan right after breakfast.  threw in random dried fruits and some walnuts and baked it in the pan.

came out fantastic! and my pan was clean afterwards as well!  This is the true way of doing a depression cake, like grandma did using 1/2 the bacon grease in the pan (you save the rest for later) so that grandpa has a hefty sliceto take with him for lunch to give him an additional 900 calories to make it to the end of the day in the coal mines.

I made this last night for my family and even my 2 year old LOVED it!  We absolutely devoured a full loaf after dinner.  Now I had to change it a little because of what I had on hand at the time.  I only had 1 cup of raisins ;-(.  So I added a frozen mix of fruits that included cherries, strawberries, blueberries, and black currents.  It turned out splendidly, thank you so much for an amazing recipe that I will be making on a regular basis now!

This is a great recipe. I did substitute cinnamon applesauce for the bacon grease, and it turned out wonderful. I gave some to my Mom, and she absolutely loved it! I also love that it doesn't require milk, eggs or butter. As someone who doesn't have a lot of money, and can't afford to always have those ingredients, this will be one of my top recipes for sure!

Great cake! My kids love it! I increased the fat content. I used 3/4 cup of canola oil and it brought a lot of softness to the crumb and crust. Made it for a vegan friend and she loved it.

yum!! I used 2tbs. Blue Bonnet margarine in place of the bacon grease and added 1/2tsp. ginger to the recipe and left out the rasins. It tasted like a spice cake to me. I made icing to drizzle over the top of each piece which we ate while still warm. For the icing I used 2 cups powdered sugar, 3tbs. milk and 1/2tsp. vanilla. So good!!

We loved this! We substituted butter for bacon grease and pumpkin pie spice for the cloves. Super easy and over the top delicious.

I cut this in half but made it almost exactly, including the bacon grease! I had butter but I really wanted to try the bacon grease... I added a few extra spices, ginger and nutmeg, extra cinnamon... Omitting the raisins. But everything else was the same. It made a delicious, not-too-dense spice cake. The batter smelled strongly like the bacon grease but after baking you couldn't tell. I was surprised and it was fun to make an eggless, milkless, butterless cake.

I made this cake and everybody really liked it, but it was a bit too sweet for my taste, so i'm gona use a lot les sugar next time. I added some nuts to it too and it came out really great. I'm defenetly making it again.
