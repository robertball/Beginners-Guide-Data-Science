Really easy to make.  Used the marinade for about 7 hours, but didn't really notice it on the steak - maybe longer would be better?  Also used a lower cut of steak.  BUT, the blackberry sauce was delicious - both the marinade and the sauce were easy, and ultimately, the steak was really tasty.  Would definitely make it again.

I let the steaks marinate over night. Sauce was great.

I liked the recipe overall, but felt the sauce overwhelmed the beef.  The vinegar was too strong for my taste - it would be better with about half as much vinegar in my opinion.

A friend gave me a jar of blackberry jam, so I decided to make this recipe.  I was put off by the amount of lemon juice.  That, and the comment by another reviewer that the marinade wasn’t even detectable on the finished steak, made me skip the marinade altogether.  I seasoned my steaks as I normally would with steak seasoning and Hubs grilled them to perfection.  I made the blackberry sauce ahead of time, cutting back a bit on the vinegar and basically adding it to taste.  I re-heated it while the steaks were resting, drizzled a little over each steak when plating, and served the rest on the side.  Since I didn’t make the marinade, my rating is for the sauce alone – 5 stars all the way!

Absolutely delicious! Not to mention easy to make!
It was a hit! I used plum jam only because it's what I had...

I favorite of the DH, you can adjust the pepper to taste if you don't like it too spicy. The sauce compliments the peppers perfectly. I like to use a combination of peppers. Lemon pepper goes very well in the mix.
