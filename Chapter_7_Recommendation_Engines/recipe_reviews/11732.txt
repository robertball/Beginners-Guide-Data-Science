This dish was tasty! I did add sauteed mushrooms to it which made it even better! I have 2 boys, 4 & 6 and my 6 year old gave it a thumbs up! Plus, my 4 year old is very picky & he ate it also! Very good :-)

Good base recipe, but rather flavorless without more seasonings. I used penne with this, more garlic, onion, red and black pepper and garlic and onion powders. Thanks for a good start!

My boyfriend and I both liked this recipe. I didn't follow it exactly but used it as a starting point.   Because my boyfriend doesn't eat dairy and is adamant about eating low-fat, I used less oil and no Parmesan.   I sauteed fresh broccoli and garlic in a little olive oil and homemade chicken broth (I added the broth since I used very little oil). Then I seasoned it really well with salt, pepper and a little onion powder and added cooked, cubed chicken. I then tossed it in with the cooked pasta. It was excellent!!

I gave five stars because I used the recipe as a jumping-off point.  First, I marinated two boneless, skinless chicken breasts in a bottle of Italian dressing for a few hours, then baked them for about an hour at 350.  I used penne pasta (just because I think it holds up better), and I also did the garlic/oil combo.  Tossed the pasta with the cubed chicken and broccoli; added salt and pepper and parmesan cheese.  I think marinating the chicken added another layer of flavor and kept it moist.  Thanks for a great idea!

Great start. With the reccomendations from the other reviewers I took some liberties with this recipe.  I replaced the garlic and olive oil with a blend of pesto, picatta, butter, parmesan, and juice from the cooked chicken (Note- I cooked the chicken in a pesto, picatta and CURRY sauce so the juices were flavorful). I tossed the pasta with that sauce and then threw i can of sliced black olives on top. The broccoli I cooked in the same pan as the chicken so I cut the chicken and broccoli and added that ontop of the olives. Lastly I had artichoke hearts in a jar of olive oil (from costco) so I cut up a handful of those and threw those on top.  I put the pot on the table for company just like that and when served all the ingredients combined nicely. It was really flavorful and unique. For my first time making this I was really happy with the results. It didn't need much salt or pepper or parmesan cheese. But I did put some extra sauce on the table in case people wanted it. The flavors combined nicely without the extra sauce, but it was nice to have just in case.

Tasty recipe! I found that it was still a bit dry so I added some Olive Oil Vinagrette. It was great! I also seasoned the chicken with garlic lemon seasoning which added another layer of flavor.

Pretty good overall. It was a little too bland as is so I added extra garlic, salt, pepper, and parmesan. I also seasoned the chicken well before cooking it. It is simple and a good one pan dish.

This was an excellent base for a healthy one-dish meal. I sautéed my chicken in a bit of olive oil with minced garlic. If you aren't generous with spices this dish may be bland. After cubing chicken, I added cooked broccoli, chopped onion, and a cup of chicken broth to the pan and simmered while the pasta was cooking. Seasoned to taste, tossed with pasta and added freshly grated Parmesan cheese before serving. Hubby gave this his seal of approval when he said to "put it in the book." Thanks for sharing!

I've made this for a while but I call it chicken low mien! I use whole wheat noodles, chicken breasts and I hit Shaw's salad bar and get broccoli, celery, onions, red, green peppers, snow peas, baby corn, mushrooms. 
I cook the vegetables in olive oil and add a small amount of sesame oil and some lo salt soy sauce I also add some corn starch to thicken it and then add the noodles. Yummy!

This was pretty good. I think for my personal taste, it needed a little more flavor though. I also used ziti noodles instead of spaghetti noodles too.

We just finished with this & it was easy, inexpensive but it needed more flavor! Note to new tryers: don't be afraid to be generous with seasoning as I was at first! I also seasoned it with more salt, pepper, garlic & parmesan but next time will season the chicken with lots of italian seasoning. It will probably take a couple of tries to get it just right but I loved how simple this recipe was. I used fresh broccoli & will be adding more of that since there just wasn't enough for my taste. I'll probably cut up a little more chicken as well. This sure makes some big helpings even though I scaled the recipe down to 4 servings so be prepared for some leftovers. Thanks so much!

This is a nice pasta, but I'd prefer w/out the chicken, actually.  I also prefer to saute the broccoli in the EVOO/garlic, along w/a little crushed red hot pepper.  All in all, this is a pretty blank canvas to customize to your personal tastes. THANKS for the recipe, dali!

As most of the people that have reviewed this recipe, I altered it just a bit, but this was a fantastic jumping off point.  

I seasoned the chicken heavily with poultry seasoning, sea salt, garlic powder, fresh cracked black pepper, and lemon pepper, pan fried until well-browned, and roasted at 350 degrees for about half an hour.  I then added olive oil to a pan and sauteed 6-7 cloves of finely minced garlic for a few minutes.  I then added the juice from the roasted breasts, along with some additional chicken stock.  I then seasoned the sauce with the same seasonings on the breast, along with a bit of red pepper flakes. I added the frozen broccoli to this mixture and let it simmer.  I let it reduce for about 10 minutes, added just a bit of starchy pasta water, and a fat knob of butter.  I then added the almost cooked pasta, and the sliced chicken breast, and let it warm through.  I added the parmesean at the last minute, and topped with extra when I plated. 

The result was tasty, super simple and amazingly flavorful.  As other reviewers have said before me, don't be afraid of the seasoning!  Just taste every step of the way, and get it to your liking.  Thanks for the spring board, I really enjoyed this!

This was ok. I used fresh broccoli and I doubled the amount of chicken and garlic. I used half olive oil and half margarine, but it was still too plain for us. Maybe crushed red pepper would have made it better.

I really enjoyed this recipe! Like the others, I felt it needed a little more flavor.  I added more garlic and parmesan.  I also don't love broccoli so I made it with spinach instead.  Very yummy!

This was a great light dish. My one worry is that even with my added 8 oz of mushrooms there seemed to be too many noodles. It would almost be ok with half the amount. Although, now I have many yummy leftovers. :)

It was quickly devoured by 5 eagerly awaiting friends. I cooked the garlic diced then added cube chicken then added the broccoli and  finally added the pasta. I used more chicken than the recipe called for. And one box of pasta.

This turned out well but I modified it like some of the other reviewers. I marinated dark meat chicken with Italian dressing then baked it, added salt and pepper, extra garlic, extra Parmesan cheese and less spaghetti noodles. Also use whole wheat noodles.  Very tasty.

The first time I didn’t have broccoli so I used cauliflower. My sister and I fell in love. Second time I did use broccoli but we agree that it taste better with the cauliflower. Now she wants it all the time.

ok. not spectacular. Tasted better the second day after adding more parmesan and a tablespoon of teriyaki sauce and a shake or two of hot sauce. I might try again using more of the suggestions from reviewers.

I just love how easy this was to make.  I also loved the lighter sauce.  Give me a recipe with my favorite ingredients; chicken, broccoli, garlic, and EVOO, and I will try it.  I used rotini pasta.

very quick, quite tasty. Next time I'll add a little butter and basil to the sauce.  It's a keeper.

I made three changes no additional salt was was added and I also added more garlic and oil. The first time I followed the recipe and it was full and dry. Today I made it with the changes and it was delishious. I also placed the chicken in then the pasta ,followed by the broccoli and oilstirred together put cheese over the top.

Whenever at least one of the kids says you need to fix this more often that deserves a 5 star.  Very yummy!  I tweaked it a little by sautéing the chicken in olive oil instead of broiling or grilling.  I did add onions with this, I actually just forgot the salt/pepper entirely. Also, I used garlic powder instead of gloves because that's what I had on hand. If I had mushrooms I would have added those too.

I thought this was so good! Unlike other reviewers, I prefer light tastes so thought the flavoring was perfect. This is super easy, fast and it is good hot or cold. I have made it twice already and will be making it again this week!

Easy starter recipe, I sauteed the chicken with minced garlic, fresh rosemary, butter, Italian seasoning and soup stock. As I made spaghetti I let the chicken simmer with broccoli spears. Tasty!

My husband and I loved this dish.  It was very easy to make and was a nice change from regular tomato based pasta.  The only change I made was that I added chopped mushrooms.  I have added this recipe to our regular dinner menu.

I thought this was excellent, especially considering the few ingredients that were in it.  I added bacon as someone else had mentioned, as well as throwing in some Italian seasoning.  It's not a fancy meal but 4 (really 4.5) stars for it being so tasty yet easy.  Oh, I also used cauliflower instead of broccoli because it was all I had.
