You really need to take the time to season the meat and brown it prior to adding to the slow cooker, otherwise it ends up bland and mushy tasting.  I used 2 lbs of chuck roast cut into 1 1/2 inch cubes seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder and red pepper flake.  I browned the meat in 1 tablespoon of oil before adding to the slow cooker.  After I browned the meat, I sauted the onion along with 2 cloves of garlic until lightly golden.  Doing this may take a little bit of time, but it does wonders to add flavor to the final stew.  Also, I needed to add a 16 oz bottle of barbecue sauce to ensure there was enough sauce.  I thinned it with a 1/2 cup of beef stock.  Garnished the stew with cheddard cheese and served over biscuits.

My family enjoyed this recipe.  I added 1/2 large sweet onion, chopped.  I also browned and seasoned the stew meat before placing in crock-pot.  I used Bush's Barbeque Baked Beans, 2 28oz cans, and drained juices from one of them before putting in crock-pot.  I also added 1/2 bottle of our favorite barbeque sauce.  I think this recipe is great because you can customize it so easily to your families taste.  If you found it bland but liked it otherwise, try it again seasoning the meat and adding in some of your family’s favorite flavors, I did and it was a hit.  Try a little mustard for a tang.  I am going to put chunked pineapple in next time.  Little meatballs instead of stew meat if your kids don’t like stew meat.

This was a hit with my family! I didn't have the bar-b-que benas so I substituted 2 15oz. cans of pork & beans and added bar-b-que sauce to taste. Also, my husband tasted it about and hour before the end of the cooking time and suggested that I add liquid smoke. I did and that really brought out the flavor. Will use this recipe often.

I just made this today; I knew we were going to have a busy day, so I planned ahead and threw it in the crockpot this morning. I followed someone else's suggestion, and browned the stew beef a bit with some seasonings and onions before I put it in the crockpot. I cut the potatoes into small cubes since we have little ones, and used regular baked beans. Left it on low for 8 hours-- I was concerned it wouldn't be juicy enough, but it was just perfect! My two little girls (2 and 3) ate their entire bowlful, and my husband had 2 big bowls. I served it with bbq sauce on the side, and a loaf of hot, fresh bread. Perfect meal for a winter evening!

Great use for leftover baked beans and potatoes!!  This stew is quite hearty and tastes great - especially with some spice added (I added hot pepper flakes, cayenne and white pepper).  I tried cooking this on high in my slow cooker for four hours, and the meat was still pink, so I'd go with 5 hours on the high setting at a minimum.

Everyone loves this recipe..even my daughter's picky boyfriend. I made a few additions. I added extra onions and a can of diced tomatos. Try the Busch's baked beans Bold and Spicy blend. They have cilantro, which really adds some flavor! A great recipe!!!!

Wowwee that was good.. but to be fair, I only used this recipe as a "guideline". First of all I browned the beef (not the sausage), then, I did not have BBQ beans, so I used baked and BBQ sauce ( I love it when I can use 1/2 open containers), then I found out we were out of potatoes, so I used 1/2 a bag of frozen french fries... MAN THAT WAS GOOD! It was a slusshy texture and both the wife and kids thought that "Dad messed up again" until they ate it... wonderfull. I can't wait until I make the recepie the way it was writen up....

Really good recipe as is, which is how I made it, but I think next time I'll leave out the potates, add a little extra beef and serve it over rice or better yet, over fried potatoes! Baby carrots would be a good addition too. Very quick and easy. Thanks for the recipe

I wasn't a fan of this one.  It was definitely hearty, but it lacked pizazz and flavor.  You can try livening it up by adding spices and green peppers, but I haven't even touched the leftovers!

Was just OK for my family and I.  Was a bit plain.  Although it was easy and I would make in a pinch if needed.  Might try it over mashed potatoes.

Okay...so go ahead and laugh. This looks like a pile of chunky gop. LOL But this chunky gop, my family loved! I followed to a T with ingredients. But I ended up stirring the whole pot together instead of the 1st 4 and then top with beans. My bad. However, my husband and kids loved very much I'd make it again too. Good hearty filling dish on a cold night when you need something to stick to your bones. I also doubled the recipe because I bought some bargain priced meat and had leftover smoked sausage that I wanted to use up. Won't go to waste in my house.

The flavor was okay but it was WAY too starchy for us. With both the potatoes and the beans it was almost like eating mashed potatoes mixed with baked beans. We probably won't make this again. It was just average.

Great spin on crockpot beef stew, hearty and filling even the kids like it.  If you don't use barbeque beans I would add extra spice, maybe bottled barbeque sauce

I liked this recipe - very easy. Because I don't like sausage I omitted that and increased the beef.  I also browned the meat prior to putting it in the crockpot (per recommendations). I used Bush's Grilling Beans (they have any variety to suit your tastebuds) and the peppers in the beans gave it some good color - the moisture from the beans created plenty of sauce for the meal.  I added corn because I thought it needed more starch - LOL. Since it made so much I shared with a few neighbors and they really like it too!

It was good - hard to tell what would make it a 5-Star meal.  
I browned the meat, like some reviewers suggested, and even tossed the stew meat in some McCormick Fiery 5 Pepper and used almost a full small bottle of Tangy & Sweet  BBQ sauce after everything was in the crockpot.  Meat was real tender, but the stew was lacking something.  Maybe more of the Fiery 5 Pepper seasoning or maybe just a tablespoon or two of Cayenne - something to give it some kick.
The wife said the recipe was a keeper, so, next time I'll try things just a little differently.

I had all the ingredients in the house so i decided to test this out.  I did season/brown the meat in advance.  Turned out  great.  Thought it could use a bit more flavor, and i'll experiment with it again.
Great base receipe, super easy.  cooked fast, would recommend a shorter cook time if using high setting.

We enjoyed this recipe. I seasoned with garlic powder, onion powder, and cumin. I also added a can of drained sweet corn. The only thing I would change for next time is the stew meat. I didn't brown it before putting in the crockpot but will try that next time.

My husband loves this. Made it word for word first time. Deleted the stew meat and just ad 2 lbs of smoked sausage. Just use any baked beans and some BBQ sauce. Adding corn is good too!

This tuned out really well.  I added BBQ sauces as one of the reviews I read suggested and it added some nice flavour.  I also browned the beef based off of other reviewers comments.  Overall a great success and my wife even liked it.

This stew is moist and hearty. When it's cold outside a bowl of the stew and cheddar biscuits will warm you right up. I threw it together in the morning in 10 min.'s and it was ready for dinner by the time everyone came home from school and work.

Husband loved it! I added some bell pepper both green and yellow, also used fresh pork sausage as my husband detests smoked sausage. I browned the beef and sausage, and added peppers and cubed taters for a short time prior to putting in crockpot. I topped off with a large can of pork and beans. Will be making this again.

Yummy! I added a few items, that i think boosted the flavor up another notch. I put in 2 teaspoons Liquid Smoke and added a bunch of crushed garlic. So savory and flavorful!

I thought this was great! I added a tablespoon of brown sugar and some corn and served it over rice (not that I needed any more starch), but it was so hearty and welcoming on a cool winter evening. Will definitely add to my list of faves!

My family loved this recipe.  Using the barbecued baked beans definitely makes a difference but I added a little spicy BBQ sauce anyway and a little chopped bell pepper.  Great with cornbread!

Overall a good recipe and worth making.  I used uncooked sausages and browned them first before putting them in the slow cooker.  I also added an extra can of BBQ beans and some carrots.  The carrots added some good flavor and I think next time I might add some turnip.  The whole family enjoyed it and that is hard to find in a family of 5.  I also made some homemade cornbread muffins and they went perfectly with it.  My muffin receipe is posted here, so check it out if you need one.

My family absolutely LOVES this recipe!  It fills the house with a wonderful aroma while cooking, and tastes even better!  I love how this recipe can be so flexible.  When I am out of smoked sausage or stew meat, I have substituted with hot dogs and roast, and it still tastes great! I have passed this recipe along to friends and they all love it!  This one is a keeper!

This was ok but was very bland. It just tastes like you dumped some hamburger in canned baked beans. You could make something that tastes like this in 20 minutes on the stove top.

I use this recipe often for friends coming over.  I added 1/2 tsp. liquid smoke and chopped up the chuck steaks myself.  I think the chopped steak was better meat than the stew meat.  I can trim all the excess fat off so to not get an over powering grease flavor.  Then I added 1/4 cup of my favorite BBQ sauce and it tastes GREAT!

Was very surprised how good it tasted.  Didn't think with that few ingredients it was going to be that good. Wouldn't change a thing, and is now part of regular menu at out house.  Thanks

This was a really hearty stew that pleased my veggie-hating hubby. I tweaked it slightly by omitting one of the potatoes and adding 1/4 c. barley and 1 c. of beef broth. Delicious! I'll definitely make this one again.

I couldn't remember the name of this recipe and have been looking for it since I made it a year ago.  My husband loved it and so did I.  It makes great left overs and is so simple.  Goes great with some corn bread.

I tried this because it sounded super simple, and I had everything I needed on hand. My brother was coming to visit and this was right up his alley! I made it exactly as it was written, and it was delicious! There was enough "juice" from the beans (I was expecting to have to add more bbq sauce, or broth or something), and the meat was so tender. I did 5 hours on high, and all was done perfectly. My brother and son both had seconds, and what was left was gone before bedtime. Will definitely make this again, maybe do a little tweaking this time. Yummy!

This was OK, but I probably won't be making it again.  I did add barbecue sauce as other reviewers suggested, and used regular baked beans.  The flavor of the beans came through too strongly for my husband and 4 year old daughter, but older daughter liked it.

The flavor was excellent, although a little thicker than I would want. the second time I made this I browned my steak first, then made a gravy out of the pan drippings and added it to the slow cooker. It was amazing! Thanks.

Wow! This was a very delicous dish!
As always, I read several reviews and made a couple of changes.  I did brown both the sausage and beef cubes before adding to the slow cooker.  I used 2 large cans of veg. baked beans and added 1/4c bbq sauce along with 1t LA Gold (hot sauce).  This simmered away for appox. 7 hrs. on low. I'm very glad I made the additions and/or changes.  Next time (and there WILL be a next time) I'll most likely increase the stew meat
by an additional pound.

My husband grew up on a ranch and thought this was a taste of home! My children and I liked it also but it was a bit too meaty for my taste. It was also a little too thick. Next time I will add more veggies and more beans and/or bbq sauce.

Absolutely WONDERFUL stew! I made it twice last week, once for a potluck and it was GONE! The only change I made was the FIRST time I made it I used one big can of baked beans and one of the smaller cans of baked beans. The second time I made it, so it would feed more people, I used the little smokies sausages and cut them in half, and I put in 1 lb of ground beef (raw) into the mix as well and then topped with the big can/small can of baked beans. We served this with cornbread.

I did a few things differently but not enough to make the recipe change.  The amount of the meat was different because it's what I had.  I did a pound of the cubed beef and a pound of the smoked sausage.  I didn't have a can of BBQ baked beans so I used a regular can of baked beans and added a little bit of BBQ sauce.  I also added carrots so there was a veggie in there.  I loved it.  My husband thought it didn't have flavor which is wrong.  It's just that there was too much of the BBQ flavor and so it tasted like a BBQ meal.  Next time I won't add the BBQ sauce.  My son also like it.  Will definately make again.  It's so easy.  Oh, and by the way...I'm not comfortable with putting most meat in the crockpot without browning first.  I like to get rid of some of the fat and grease, which is what I did with the beef in this recipe.  Thanks!

This meal was very easy to make.  My three year old had a blast helping me make it.  I followed the receipe exactly, but felt like there was just something missing.  I may try adding some liquid smoke like someone else suggested next time, or maybe some extra bbq sauce.  I think I'm also going to add some green beans next time and maybe some carrots.  I served it with cornbread and my son and husband loved it.  I just liked it.  So we're going for a combined score here.  Would be great if I could figure out what that something that it needs is.

This is definitely a great base recipe for a stick to your ribs meal. I made a few changes. I did brown my cubed beef. I added 2 chopped carrots and an onion, as well as garlic and a generous squeeze of Sriracha. 
Cooked all day in slow cooker. 
Delicious! 
Thank you for sharing this recipe. I will definitely be making this again!

Pretty good but a touch too sweet for us.  If I make this again I would choose bold and spicy beans over BBQ.  Left out the potato as I served this over big spicy steak fries per some of the reviews, yum!  Added probably about 1/2 cup of our favorite BB sauce (again would change what I chose), but this makes it's own liquid so don't make the mistake of adding extra liquid (I was tempted...glad I didn't.)  When done after 8 hours in the slow cooker, I added more spices; more salt, freshly cracked pepper, more crushed red pepper, more garlic, tad bit of liquid smoke and a tsp or more of worstershire sauce.  There is absolutely no need to brown the meat first; done that and it makes no difference after the meat is slow cooked for 8 hours or more.  Seasoned the beef first with salt, pepper,  red pepper flake, and garlic powder before cooking (should have added more red pepper. ).  Loaded a half jar of pickled jalapeños in the last hour of cooking, that turned out well. Thanks for the recipe!

I think this recipe is a great place to start. Like some of the other reviewers, I browned by beef first. I changed it up a little bit by sauteing it in olive oil along with some bacon, garlic powder, onion powder, red pepper flakes and chili powder. I also used Bush's Chili Starter instead of BBQ baked beans. The end result was a hearty and spicy version that I give five stars too.

This was really good, but like others said, it was a bit bland. The 2nd time I made it, I added a can of rotel tomatoes, and a can of corn. I also added about a cup of beef broth, with some garlic.

I would add the sausage toward the end next time, if I make it again, it was really overcooked and gave the meat a bad taste.

I love the idea of this. However, the reality left something to be desired. Mine came out really mushy.  I will try again but will crisp up the potatoes and cut the cooking time down.

This is a very good starter recipe. I've also made a variation using taco-seasoned ground beef, and added diced carrots and whole kernel corn to the onions and potatoes.

This is very good & hearty.  Very thick.  I added shredded cheese to my bowl.

It would definitely be fine with a little less meat.

This turned out great! I used Bush's baked beans, added some left-over garbanzo beans, carrots and some hot sauce. Then, served it in a sourdough bread bowl. YUM!! It was a hit with my hubby too. Great recipe!

My family of 4 really liked this, and I do have one truly picky eater.  It's well named - it's kind of like a trip down the serving line of your favorite bbq joint.  You can add bbq sauce and extra veggies if you like, the recipe is very easy to personalize.  But my family liked it just as written.  I did not pre-brown anything and it came out of the crock pot just great.  It seemed like a offbeat twist on bbq, familiar flavors but a different presentation - and no grill to heat or prep to do at the end of a long day.  I'll definitely make it again.

We thought this was pretty good. Very high protein with all the meat and beans and especially easy to make too. I do wish I'd made a vegetable side to go with it though. Just the stew with corn muffins seemed like too much meat.  I would make this again.

I would give this only three stars, but since my hubby liked it, I'll give it the extra one.  I added carrots, hot sauce and liquid smoke as other reviewers suggested, and while the carrots and hot sauce were fine, the liquid smoke combined with the smoked sausage I used was too much smoke.  I could eat it, but would definitely encourage my hubby to taste the concoction (he added the liquid smoke near the end of cooking, as I was at work yet) before adding the smoke if we ever make this again.  Overall, a good, hearty meal on a cold, snowy day.

Very good as a base, but added a few things.  Used turkey sausage to lighten up meat a bit and added carrots and celery for a bit of crunch.  Also substituted 1/2 potatoes with sweet potatoes.  Used an additional cup of tangy barbeque sause for flavor.

This recipe was ok, my husband wasn't that into it. I thought it was interesting but it needed a bit more play on the bake beans. It also seemed like it was to mushy, maybe cook for a shorter time.

I thought this was a good recipe.  It was easy to make and not expensive.  I made a double recipe for a school pot luck and it was completely gone!  I did add some jalapenos and some additional seasonings because it did seem a little bland but that was all.  I will definately take it to the next church or fire station pot luck.  This is a good cold winter night meal with some homemade bread or cornbread!

Very good and hearty, I did try it with spicy smoked sausage with Jalapeno pepper and could not find barbecue baked beans so used regular and added barbecue sauce. Serve with bread, It was worth waiting for.

The aroma of this dish slowly cooking in the crockpot wets your mouth with anticipation.  From my youngest child to my husband, this recipe was a huge hit!  Definitely an addition to our favorite meal list.  I am a post-op gastric bypass patient, and I enjoyed a tiny amount of this.
