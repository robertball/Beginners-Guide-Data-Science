Have made a similar recipe. Use peanut butter cookie dough(check for allergies) instead of a triangle. Slice and sqeeze slightly in the center so that you get a peanut shaped head. Use the pretzel eyes and brown m&m's for the eyes but we used RED m&m's or you could use gumdrops. Afterall, what's Christmas without Rudolph?

How cute and easy are these? You can also add some almond extract when you add the flour for a deliciously different flavor. Or try other flavor extracts like lemon or peppermint.

I have been making Reindeer cookies from Pillsbury sugar cookie dough for a number of years.  I use the chocolate covered pretzels for the antlers and red gum drops for the nose.  The grandchildren love them.  Another way to make reindeer treats is to make a shortbread recipe, bake it in a pie plate and make the reindeer as if you were making slices of pie.  Great to take to a potluck or wherever treats are expected.

This is an adorable and easy way to do sugar cookies. I will probably never go back to cut-outs. The pretzel tasted delicious with the sweet frosting. I used my own sugar cookie and frosting recipes, but purchasing both premade would be a time saver in a pinch. M&M's worked great for the nose and eyes. My grandchildren liked picking out red ones for the noses for "Rudolphs."

These were great and easy to make. My 4 and 6 year old girls help me decorate them. I though they were going to be really sweet with the store bought frosting but they weren't at all. I'm glad I didn't go through the trouble of making frosting myself. This will be a new and easy cookie to make as a family.

Cute, but I had difficulty making the triangular faces.  The dough softens really fast and so it was hard for me to have nice consistent shaped heads. Dough was either too cold, therefore crumbly on the outside or too warm/soft and lost shape while placing on baking sheets.  Will try again. 
Don't decorate until ready to serve as they don't store well with antlers.

This was lovely and easy to do with the grandchildren..... it was nice as it did not take "forever" (as the kids would say) to make the dough and bake the cookies untill we got on to the Decorating part!!!

These cookies were easy to prepare after reforming in plastic wrap. I prepared three batches of the dough and had it ready to slice and bake. It was great when family stopped by or my son wanted to take some cookies to share.  Great idea and easy to prepare.

I used my own sugar cookie recipe and cut it out using my heart shaped cookie cutter which worked better for me. I couldn't get my dough rolled into a triangular log. I also used holiday M&Ms in the red and green colors.
