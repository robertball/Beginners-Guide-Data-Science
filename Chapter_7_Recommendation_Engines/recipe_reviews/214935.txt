Just a quick note, if you're wanting to freeze these for later use, once roasted, simply drizzle with a little extra olive oil, omit other ingredients, place in freezer bag and seal.  They'll last a good 2 to 4 months.

Excellent! No comparison to the commercial, jarred variety.  No question that this is worth the extra effort it takes to prepare.  The addition of the capers and garlic was a creative, special and delicious touch.  This was a wonderful part of our array of antipasti.

Fabulous! Simple ingredients that go well together just like the title states. The dressing is just enough without being too much in flavor or quantity and the sweetness of the roasted peppers shines through. Delicious eaten on its own, when topping a sandwich or with a hunk of crusty bread. I simply roast peppers over a direct flame (either stove-top or grill) till evenly charred (turn frequently). Once done follow directions as noted to prepare.

Didn't care for the vinegar. Next time I will just use the olive oil.

Delicious.  I didn't have large bell peppers so used small bell peppers.  Great addition to a green salad.

Made these and let them sit for 24 hours before we put them on sandwiches. Very tasty much better than any jarred variety I have purchased.

very versatile! I mixed some up with steamed green beans as a side for chicken picatta. Next time I'm thinking about a crostini topping with goat cheese. Lots of ideas.
