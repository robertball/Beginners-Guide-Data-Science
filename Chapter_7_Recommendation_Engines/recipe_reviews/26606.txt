Best meatloaf hubby ever tasted so he said. Was a bit time consuming to make and next time I will cut down on the amount of cilantro to use. A bunch could be a little or a lot. In my case it was too much. And I used monteray jack/pepper cheese and it was wonderful. This recipe will definetly be a company dinner. Bet mushrooms would be tasty too.

Cut back on the veggies or increase the bread crumbs (minimum of double). The fresh cilantro is overpoweringly strong...eliminate or use only 1-2 sprigs.

My family all but one loved this meatloaf. It is easy to prepare and very tazty and quite a change from ordinary meatloaf. This is excellent!I would recommend spraying the foil with Pam though for easy removal after cooking.

This was amazing!!! I am not a huge meatloaf fan but it is one of my husbands favorites. I did do my own thing a little added about 8oz of pepper jack cheese I think I saw that in a review plus I always hide veggies in meat loaf so I had about 3 cups of grated carrots and about a cup and a half of chopped fresh spinach I did 4 cloves of garlic but they were on the small side. I also made a glaze for the top with ketchup A1 and brown sugar and put it on about half way through the cooking time. It was so good I teased and said I made meatloaf taste like steak!!! everyone loved it and we all ate it for breakfast noone wanted to wait for lunch! oh I do not follow recipes very well I kinda get started and then do my own thing so I should mention that I just saw the part at the end with the ham cheese and broccoli:) I did do cheese just not like that.

Was very tasty - I would cut back a little on the cilantro. I used turkey bacon vs. ham and it was delicious -

This was good for something different. I followed the recipe minus the cilantro plus chopped fresh mushrooms. If I make this again I would cut the steak sauce amount in half. I think I can work this into something that would be better to my taste.

The steaksauce gave the meatloaf a good flavor but the meatloaf fell apart somewhat when sliced. Also I was not crazy aboout the ham.

I am not a big meatloaf fan but this one was really tasty. I omitted the broccoli from the centre though and served it as a side vegetable.

This is a HUGE loaf!! It's soft so do add more bread crumbs. I had to leave out the broccoli so I substituted shredded swiss for the cheddar. I don't recommend that. Not much flavor. I look forward to trying it with the broccoli and cheddar. I also back up the recommendation to spray the aluminum with no-stick. Make sure the ham is thin b/c you need alot of muscle to roll up this loaf!

My boyfriend and I enjoyed this recipe very much. I only gave it 4 stars because we didn't rave about it. He thought it was too onion tasting (which is surprising considering we both love onion). I thought it was a tad bit too runny but I may have had the green peppers in the food chopper too long causing them to get watery. Overall it was a great way to use leftover lunch meat that I didn't want to go bad!

This meatloaf was fantastic. My fiance who is a very picky eater said it was the best meatloaf he had ever eaten. I did add fifteen minutes to the cooking time but my oven may be a little off.

I am giving it two stars because my husband and 4 year old son both liked it. I on the other hand thought it was gross. This is not the fault of the recipe itself. It is more my own fault for thinking I could finally find a meatloaf recipe I actually liked. I am a lifelong meatloaf-hater lol!

This is by far one of my favorite dishes I have ever cooked. After years of cooking meatloaf with tomato paste or gravy I never thought that meatloaf by itself would be so good. Even my picky daughter a servings of this dish. my compliment to the chef.

I wanted to like this. I really really did. I ADORE cilantro and I thought that the steak sauce would make a different take on traditional tomato-centered meat loaf. I took suggestions from others and cut the cilantro by about 2/3. It still overpowered the other ingredients. I ended up using additional steak sauce to cover up the flavor. On the other hand it came out very nice and moist not soggy the way others said.
