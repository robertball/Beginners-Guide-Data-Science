I'm generally a little reluctant to use canned cream-of-whatever soup because of the sodium, fat, preservatives, etc., but for a recipe that's good enough I can be swayed.  This one is good enough.  First of all, the recipe cuts in half quite neatly, and will then fit in an 8x8 dish, which is completely reasonable for two people and provides a satisfying amount of leftovers.  I used pre-cooked chicken and swapped half of the mayo for sour cream (a trick I've done before and liked in other recipes); I also used frozen green beans defrosted in the microwave, and jarred mushrooms.  (Which, by the way, I won't repeat:  the texture is awful.  Next time I'll saute fresh shrooms instead, and will thus avoid having to pick them out of the finished product.)  I used fire-roasted veggie Kashi crackers because they were what I had, but I don't think I'd do that again, either; the taste was too strong.  I thought the curry was perfect.  It's not really enough that the recipe could be called "curried;" if you know it's there, you can taste it, but if you don't, it just sort of enhances the chicken flavor.  I think next time I might use corkscrew pasta; the rigatoni was good, but corkscrews would catch all of the sauce.  And, finally, instead of parsley, I used chopped scallions on top.  I served it with a salad with a strawberry vinaigrette dressing; the sweet-tart dressing cut the creaminess of the casserole nicely.  All in all, a great, easy recipe that I'll make again.

For a casserole, this was fantastic! I alterred the recipe a tad, and my husband couldn't get over the combination of flavors and textures. I used one can of cream of mushroom soup & one can of cream of chicken. I added about 1/4 teaspoon more of the curry. I omitted the mushrooms & addes some corn instead. I also added a little more cheese and a little more cornflakes. Oh! And maybe most importantly, I used farfelle (bowtie) noodles instead of rigatoni. I also omitted the butter, as the oils from the cheese gave the cornflakes plenty of moisture. Overall, it was great! Thanks for the recipe Michele!

I made this for my husband & me....it was DELICIOUS!!  Our daughter & son-in-law are visiting for a week and I plan on making it for them.  The recipe makes a large amount and would be great for a dinner for a large group. I had to use a 9x13 pan.....there was no way I could fit it into a 2 qt. dish as mentioned in the recipe.
Thank you SO much for sharing this recipe!

This is a great "pot luck" type dish. It's easy to put together and you can make it ahead or even freeze some.  I made it and decided to make it for 8 instead of 4 expecting to share with other family members.  Boy, what a mistake!  It was like the casserole that took over Chicago. It was huge! It could easily have fed twice that many people. I have to say, I had to make several substitutions, but I doubt it hurt the recipe (but as my sister-in-law said, you still don't really know what the recipe tastes like, do you?) Ummm, no.  But it was good. The substitutions were strictly for the reason that I didn't have the right ones. I used 2 cans of cream of chicken and 1 of cream of celery, didn't have curry and decided to try creole seasonings (got try something), didn't have green beans or mixed vegetables so used package of chinese vegetables, also, had to use ziti (big deal). I didn't care, it was still good. There was enough for two huge casseroles so I gave my daughter one to put in her freezer for an upcoming pot luck.  I will definitely make again.

This recipe was so easy to make and everyone in my family loved it.  My son does not like green beans but he didn't even pick them out when eating this casserole.  The mixture of mayo, lemon juice, and curry made for a delectable flavor!  I would not change a thing!

I love this recipe. It's quick, easy and great! I make it quite often so to mix it up a little bit I use different shaped pastas and change around the vegetables too. Try it with broccoli instead of the green beans, or fresh mushrooms instead of the canned. Everybody who has tried the Chicken Casserole Del Sol when I've made it have raved about it. This is definately a winner in my book!

I loved this recipe! I did make a few changes though. I used cream of mushroom soup and omitted the mushrooms. Also I used the ritz cracked peppercorn crackers. The next time I make this I may not use the cheese at all, I did'nt think it really needed it.

This is a great recipe!  I modified it by using fresh green beans and extending the cooking time appropriately.  Also, I will often times omit the chicken and use the recipe as a vegtable side dish and it's just as good.

Next time I make this I will probably use less pasta (ended up with the casserole overflowing) and frozen grench-cut green beans instead of canned. My husband LOVED it. It's definitely a keeper.

My husband and I loved this... reading the other reviews, we didn't think it was bland at all... the curry added an interesting flavor.  We even ate the leftovers, which we hardly ever do!  I thought it was easy to make and tasted good.

This was delicious!  I did not have the right soup, so used 1 can of cream of celery & 1 can of brown chicken gravy. Next time I'll use the cream of chicken to see if it's even better. I took the submitter's alternate suggestion of mixed vegetables and divided it into two 8x8 pans -- one for home & one for another family. I baked it covered for 30 minutes & uncovered for 10 to crisp up the topping. It was loved by all, including the non-vegetable eating kids, one who even asked for seconds.

I have to be honest - I fully expected to dislike this dish and made it because I couldn't think of what else to make.  It was actually good!!  My 9 year old had 4 helpings.  Even my casserole-hating husband was full of compliments.  Made it just as written except with 1 can cream of chix and 1 can cream of mush soup.  Will definately make again but may try experimenting with a more low cal/fat version.

This was a very yummy casserole -- I used crumbled saltines instead of cornflakes b/c I didn't have any. I also used a can of mixed veggies instead of just straight beans. Other than that, I did everything as stated, and it was very, very good -- a hit with everyone. Thanks!

I tried this recipe out on my fiance and he loved it. So I made as a side dish for our recent holiday dinner.  Everyone asked for the recipe.  Instead of cornflakes on top, I just bake cornbread and crumble on top.  We don't like mushrooms so I leave those out and it still tastes great.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

I was looking for a recipe with chicken and curry to make as an easy casserole, and this was about the only one I could find. I did change the recipe a little. First off, I am a firm believer that you have to cook curry (like in a pan) for the true flavor to come out. I sprinkled the curry powder on the chicken with salt and pepper and pan fried them instead of boiling. For all those that say that this dish is too bland, there is a solution. I used wild rice instead of pasta, and only one can of cream of chicken. I was quite turned off by the mayonaise at first, but then the whole taste didn't turn out too bad. My husband loved it and we had an unexpected friend of his stop by for dinner and they ate it all up.

I had family that came into town and I needed to make something quick, easy and tasty for a change.  I made an 8 serving casserole but it easily could have fed 12 people - it was huge!  I thought the flavor mix was great. The family loved it and we had leftovers for the next few days!  I followed the recipe exactly as it said and the only thing I would change in the future is to use 1/2 as much mayo - the curry really gave it that kick but wasn't spicy at all!  Great casserole!

We really enjoyed this meal.  I used chopped broccoli instead of green beans, added some diced pimentos, used more cubed chicken and a little extra cheese. We thought it was very tasty and would make again.

This recipe is awesome!  Will definitely make it again.   The recipe states it's 6 servings but sounded like so much more.  So I used half the pasta, soup, mayo, lemon juice, and curry.   My finished product still made at least 6 hearty servings.   Very good!!

We absolutely love this recipe!  In the cooler months we prepare it about once every two weeks.  We double the corn flakes on top and instead of cumin we use creole seasoning.  Wonderful recipe...thanks so much for sharing it!

It was pretty good, very creamy.  I also used Ritz crackers instead of corn flakes and used whole wheat rotini pasta and the frown veggies.  Next time I think I'll mix some cheeses into the mixture (aside from the topping) just because this was the yummiest part.  Hubby loved it and makes good leftovers!

Love this... I got this recipe a long time a go and make it almost once a month.  I use fresh brocolli instead of green beans, and use healthy choice (low sodium) cream of chicken soup.  Family and 2 year old gobble it up!  Makes great left overs too!

I was quite pleasantly surprised.  I looked for a casserole recipe that was quick and I was able to throw it together and bake while other things were going on.  This was it!  I made some subsitutions like others-I didn't have curry, so I used cajun seasoning (yum!), one can of cream of chicken, one can of cream of mushroom, and crushed butter crackers on top.  It cooked up very well in the time indicated and provided great leftovers!  Thanks a bunch.

This recipe was great, but I only used half a box of pasta, omitted the curry, and added mixed vegetables. It made plenty for dinner, we froze the rest, and when we did eat part I froze, it tasted as if i had made it that day. This recipe is a keeper, and my husband can't wait for me to make it again! THANKS!

Very delicious!  Was nervous about the curry but it was a delightful surprise.  I did substitute the green beans for two crowns of steamed broccoli and used fresh sliced baby bella mushrooms in place of the canned mushrooms.  Added diced pimentos for color.  I used thin sliced boneless chicken breasts, diced and then sauteed them in the juice from the sauteed mushrooms and added all that juice to the sauce mix. oh yeah, I used ruffled pasta in place of the rigatoni since my hubby is a "pasta snob". Will definitely make again and again!

The mayo seemed to give this casserole a strange taste. I think it was too much. I don't think I will make it again.

This was really great.  I have been recovering from surgery, so my husband has had to do all of the cooking lately... yikes.  I found this recipe and thought that it would be easy for him to follow.  He made it exactly according to the recipe, and it was wonderful.  It was done quickly, and it tasted great.  I think that I would probably add more cornflakes if I made it, and it DEFINITELY needed a larger container, but otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing.  If you have conpunctions about trying it, remember, my HUSBAND made this.  He DOESN'T cook, but this was easy for him.  Thanks.

This was my first stab at making dinner(I don't usually do the cooking). It was easy and very well planned. It came out great and now I am going to fix it for guests.

I made the following substitutions...most based on other reviews...with great results:  deleted the mayonnaise and butter; used one can of cream of mushroom soup and one of chicken; used frozen mixed vegetables that included French cut green beans; and used bread crumbs rather than corn flakes.  Very easy, very tasty and great for leftovers.

We really enjoyed this casserole.  I am not too big on casseroles, but I will add this to my list of regualr meals because I enjoyed it so much.  If trying this recipe, YOU MUST NOT OMIT THE CURRY!  I do not like curry and was very concerned about the flavor, but took a leap of faith and tried it and glad I did.  I let many people try this and no one could recognize that there was curry in it - there is just a slight curry flavor but really makes it good.  I liked using the french green beans because it was hard to tell they were there since they got lost in the noodles - I loved this because my son was eating veggies and didn't know it.  Next time I will add mixed veggies as well as the green beans.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was not the best recipe ever, but was very good. I did change some things though. I used bone -in chicken breast, boiled them, and then peeled all the meat off. I used 4 different pasta's. Wheel's, different color spirals, ect...
I did not add mushroom (I love them, family does not) I also did not have corn flakes, so I mixed about 2 cups of croutons with the melted butter, and then added about a half cup of dry bread crumbs. (You may need a little more butter) I spread this on top then placed in the over. It added some crunch. I would probably make this on another occasion, but not very often. Thanks! Worth trying though, and yes it makes A LOT, great for a big family, or saving some for lunch the next day (it still tasted good after sitting in the fridge)

I thought this was a fantastic recipe!  I have to admit, I'm a bit of a recipe snob--I usually only try the 41/2 or 5 star recipes, but I'm so glad I made an exception in this case.  This made 2 casseroles for me, a 13x9x2 and an 8x8 and it froze beautifully.  I used frozen mixed veggies and added extra mushrooms.  It was creamy and delicious with a subtle curry flavor and yummy crunchy topping.  Best of all, my whole family ate it (even my 2 picky ones!).  That makes it 5 stars and a keeper for me.

This recipe is GREAT! I didn't know how well we would like it as I have never tried curry before but was pleasantly surprised! It was delicious! I made the recipe exactly was written except added two cans of mushrooms instead of one. If one can of mushrooms is good, than two is even better!! I found that the 1 cup of crushed cornfalkes was not quite enough to cover the top sufficiently so I added a little more. Otherwise perfect and I would recommend this casserole! I was a little bit apprehensive about the curry and mayo but it all blends together for a delicious meal.

Made this for the family tonight.  Everyone loved it enough to have seconds, if not thirds.  I was glad the curry flavor was not overwhelming.  The combination of flavors was perfect.  When I made it again I will make a bit more of the corn flake topping.

If there were a 1/2 star rating, I would have given this 4 1/2 stars.  I followed the directions to the letter and we enjoyed it.  The buttered corn flakes were a nice surprise!  Curry is such a strong spice, but I know we'll make this one again.

I omitted the mayo, but other than that, I followed all the other directions and ingredients.  It had a very bland taste and was rather boring.  My husband refused to eat it and I wasn't that fond of it either.  The recipe is easy, however I found it time consuming. Too many steps.  Boiling chicken, boiling pasta, cutting up the chicken, preparing the vegeis......

Excellent.  I used the mixed veggies and Swanson's canned chicken and it was a great casserole.  I halfed the recipe for 4 people and still had leftovers!

Have made it a couple of times now.  It makes so much you can divide it and freeze.  I usually use "stir fry" style frozen vegetables.  Its a definite keeper.

Substituted prebaked/packaged chicken (much easier) and broccoli instead of green beans.  Very rich comfort food.  Kids enjoyed - will make again but will probably try low fat mayo and cheese to lighten fat content.

Good casserole Michele! I used egg noodles with this, broccoli in lieu of the beans, a half cup of mayo, garlic and onion powders and more curry. I had leftover roast chicken from the night before, so I even threw in the gravy. Good stuff and perfect for a chilly night. Thanks!

I used frozen veg, sauteed the chicken cubes before adding to the mix and completely omitted the cup of mayonaise and the butter and this turned out great. I also used rice crispies instead of cornflakes (we didn't have any) and although my husband was dubious at first, once he tried it, he loved it.

This recipe was good, I did change it a bit. I used sour cream instead of the mayo, and omited the curry, using ground peppercorns and italian seasoning. I also mixed different cheese's like a few of the other reviewer's. It makes a lot for just 2 people, but it's just as good the  next day.

This recipe was delicious!!!  It's a perfect creamy casserole for chilly winter evenings!  I made the recipe exactly as directed, but ended up with way too much to fill the size dish recommended.  That was ok though -- now I have one in the freezer for another day!

All my cookbooks are in storage (we're in temp housing right now) and we're getting tired of the "same old thing".  I'm sure glad I found this recipe!

It's been really hard to cook in temp housing because I don't have all my own kitchen stuff right now...and this used basic stuff that's included in the apartment!  Thanks for putting this recipe here!

This was an easy supper to make with stuff I already had in the cupboard. Next time I might add some extra fresh veggies, or make the chicken mixture with 1 can of soup and one can of milk and serve it over rice... Thanks

My wife and son are extremely picky eaters, and they loved this recipe. So much so, that my wife suggested that I make it for a dinner party that we attended one night. I had a couple of requests for the recipe. I highly recommend this recipe.

I made this recipe with only one minor substitution.  I used sauteed some fresh mushrooms instead of using canned.  The recipe is bland but not terrible.   I do like this recipe and will make it again but next time will use more seasonings.

This was delicious!  To make it easier, I subbed canned chicken.  I didn't have corn flakes, so I used Panko.  My family raved about this and leftovers heat nicely also.  This will definitely go into our regular meal rotation!

This was very good!!!  I used Non fat Yogurt instead of the mayo, it didn't have the strong mayo flavor, but served the purpose of a creamy sauce. I used low fat Cream of Mushroom soup and less pasta because we are limiting carbs in our house.  Otherwise I made it as written.  Someone a few years ago posted that it was alright, but since she didn't  have half the stuff she needed  she didn't add the curry, or the green beans or several other major ingredients.  If you don't make the recipe pretty much the way it is written, don't post a comment saying it is not great.  I did change the quantity to 8 so I could freeze 1/2 in two different glass Pyrex containers for 2 dinners and 2 lunches for the 2 of us.  I freeze in the pyrex casseroles and then put the frozen meal in a Food Saver bag and suck the air out, return to the freezer.  This frees up my containers.  It adds 3 months to the freeze time, but they never last that long in our freezer!!  LOL  I set the frozen casserole out the night before in the fridge, or in the AM and it is ready to cook in the PM!!  I often freeze these in smaller amounts for Hubby when I am gone taking care of grandbabies for a month or two.  He can eat with out having to prepare, he can just cook after work.

Wow! Amazing! Only thing is I changed everything in it??! First I boiled my chicken in water with a l'tle bit of chicken broth and a pack of lipton savoury herb with garlic. After my chicken was cooked,  boiled the rigatoni noodles in the same water. For the sauce, I mixed cream of chicken and cream of wild mushrooms. I put fresh brocoli and roasted yellow peppers instead of the other veggies. Mixed all together and put in a casserole with medium cheddar, mozz and marble cheese, bacon bits and crushed ritz mixed with butter on top. It was succulent!! I'll definitely do it again

I made this on Saturday and it was good & the family liked it but I thought it needed another can of soup or something to make it more liquid.  Also,
I didn't add the mushrooms - they have to be fried beyond recognition for me to attempt to eat them... there is just something about the texture of the mushrooms.

All in all this was a tasty dish. However, I substituted elbow macaroni for the rigatoni, cutting down the amount of noodles as I was making a 9" x 9" dish vs. 9" x 13". I also only used 1 can of cream of chicken soup again due to paring down the recipe, didn't use the melted butter with the cornflakes. Next time I would use less curry as the flavor is overpowering - I only did a few shakes of curry. I prepared this earlier in the day and refrigerated it for baking later, leaving off the cornflakes until put it in the oven.

I made this almost to the recipe (used fresh mushrooms instead of canned, used breadcrumbs instead of cornflakes, didn't top with cheese), and it was good, but a little bland. The omission of the cheese was probably an error on my part, but I also think it could do with some spices. When I eating the leftovers, I put some onion powder and garlic and herb Mrs. Dash on it, and it was pretty great. I'd recommend adding some more seasonings, based on your individual tastes.

Used elbow noodles (what I had), cut green beans (personal preference) and crackers in lieu of cornflakes (had no cornflakes on hand.)  it was good - a nice comfort food and both by 3.5 and 2 year old liked it.  Good, not as good as leftovers. Used 1 T curry - like it with more flavor.

Just a few changes made... I also used bowties, since my kids tend to like funkier shapes better.  I also used frozen broccoli instead of the green beans, since my kids prefer broccoli.  That said, this recipe was just okay.  My husband loves casserole dishes, but not this one.  It was very rich.  The flavor wasn't awful, but my husband told me that it's not a keeper, and neither of my sons would eat it.  I think it was just too rich for my family.

I didn't have rigatoni so I used bowtie.  I thought that worked well.  The flavor was good but it needs something else but I'm not sure what.  I would also suggest letting it set for a few minutes after baking.  It stayed together better when cut. I will probably try it with mixed veggies next time.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  We both gave it a 4.5.  I only used one can of cream of chicken soup, (because that's all I had), and I used only 3 cups of noodles.  It was really good and different.  Thanks for sharing!!!

My family didn't much care for this recipe. I am giving some extra credit for it being different than most other chicken casseroles, but for us the flavor blend just wasn't to our liking. I was glad to try something new, and I did like the fat noodles. I think I might experiment with some other spice combinations.

Loved it!  I followed the recipe, except I used frozen broccoli instead of the green beans.  It was a hit with the whole family.  I was concerned about the curry, but it was great.  It made a ton...about three meals for our family of 2 adults and 2 small children.

I always try something if it's four stars and only one or two people didn't like it--and this was the only one of those types of recipies that I actually didn't like. (I almost always like them!) 

This tasted like...tuna noodle casserole except with chicken. I used broccolli, which I think turned out better than it would have with green beans, but that's just prefrence. I also sauteed the chicken and mushrooms first. 

It also made a TON...for two really good eaters we had enough left over for tomorrow, some for the freezer...and some for the garbage. (It didn't turn out wonderfully, but I don't waste food!)

I won't be making this again, but it wasn't a total waste. Just kind of...so/so.

Very good, quick and easy! I may add more chicken and cut down on the noodles, also try broccoli in place of the green beans. Overall, everyone in the family liked it - and that in itself is an accomplishment!

This was good. I used Miracle whip instead of mayo, elbow mac instead of rigatoni and added an extra pinch of curry. It was a good change from the normal chicken casserole. My kids weren't to sure about it(it wasn't hotdogs or mac&cheese.), but my boyfriend had 2 helpings.

I made this for a family that I cook for.  They suggested doubling the sauce or decreasing the pasta.  They also suggested NOT freezzing it.  Otherwise it was good.  I also found that the recipe makes more than a 13x9 pan so either have two casserole pan ready or decrease it.  Thanks for submiting it.

I thought it was okay.  My husband loved it though.  I used 1 can of cream of chicken & mushroom and 1 can of cream of chicken.  I also put some green onions in... I wanted to put some onions but that was all I had.  I think I'll make it again...

A big hit! Used some of the other reviews to help as I was out of a couple ingredients.  Frozen beans, 1 can cream of checken and 1 cream of mushroom instead worked great!  Also I used FETA and a bit of Romano cheese and Sourdough Croutons.  This recipe is great to vary ingredients!

This was ok.  My husband wasn't a big fan of it so I probably won't make it again.

I had to substitue ritz crackers for corn flakes, and sea shell noodles for the rigatoni ones.  Good.  Made a ton.  Good for company dish and leftover turkey.  Could go a little easier on curry for our taste.

Very good.  Works well to make for a small family and freeze half of it for later.

I think the recipe would have been better, less the cup of mayo...
