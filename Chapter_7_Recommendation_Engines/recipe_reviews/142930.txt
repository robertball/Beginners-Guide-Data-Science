These are delicious. There is no need to look for special cream cheese, I use an 8 oz block of regular cream cheese at room temperature so it will mix well with the pineapple. After you roll up the tortillas, refrigerate for an hour or two. This sets up firmer so your pinwheels won't get mushy and are easy to slice.

This was very good, but I did make a few changes.  I used regular cream cheese, and pineapple in heavy syrup, not juice.  After reading some of the reviews that the juice makes it too thin.  I let the pineapple sit in a strainer for about 5 minutes, then mixed with the cream cheese.  It wasn't even slightly runny.  It was perfect!  Next time i will maybe try to sprinkle a little brown sugar on top of the ham.

I have to say that I really liked these! I did use regular cream cheese and just put the pineapple on top of it, didnt mix it in. I think using pineapple cream cheese would be too much. And make sure you really drain your pineapple. Very yummy!

These were so good! I made sure I drained the pineapple well before mixing it into the cream cheese and being careful not to overstuffand I let them in the refrigerator for several hours rolled in plastic wrap. I didn't set them out until the last minute so the cream cheese wouldn't warm up and only put out half of the recipe at a time because of the warm weather. They were not mushy at all. Using regular cream cheese instead of whipped might help if you are worried about them being too soft.

These pinwheels where a big hit at my party!! Everyone wanted the recipe! I couldn't find the whipped pineapple but they did have just regular pineapple cream cheese, that I was a little hesitant to use after reading some of these comments but, i dried out my pineapple really good, with a lot of paper towels 3 times, and they turned out great & were the talk of the party! Not mushy at all!

Yum! I actually found the pineapple cream cheese, however, I spread that on the tortillas, and placed the crushed pineapple on top of that rather than mixing the two in a spread. To combat the fear of soggy tortillas, I drained the pineapple in a collander, then spread it out on paper towels and gently blotted everything to soak up more juice. To really hold everything together, I made them a day ahead and refridgerated overnight. They were still bland though, but not bad. Thanks.

Well, I tried, but this wasn't the hit at my party. The complaints were that they were "mushy." 

Thanks anyhow

I dug these, they were different & really tasty.  As most of the other reviewers, I could not find pineapple cream cheese.  I just purchased plain cream cheese & whipped it up with my KitchenAid.  I strained my can of crushed pineapple really, really well & then actually threw it all in the KitcheAid with the cream cheese & blended it all together.  Then I rolled them up tightly in saran wrap and threw them in the fridge & didn't cut them up until right before the party.  Very cheap, super easy & went over well at the bday party I took them to. Next time I might add in a bit more ham, but that is all a personal preferance. Thanks for sharing!  :)

excellent - I also just used regular cream cheese and used and hand mixer to get the cc and pineapple to mix well.  I didn't have issues with too much juice and didn't spend a whole lot of time draining stuff. 

Nice departure from the traditional salsa based pinwheels!

Good, easy recipe! I agree that you can just use regular cream cheese, no need to use pineapple cream cheese. Make sure to drain the pineapple well so the roll-ups don't get soggy. Overall a nice change of pace from the "normal" roll-ups you find at parties!

Most people loved these - a couple of people thought the taste was odd, but I really liked them.  I let the pineapple drain for about 15 minutes as well and they weren't too liquidy at all.  I thought they were a nice different alternative to the regular salsa rollups I usually make.  Thanks!!

The whipped pineapple cream cheese was not available at our local grocery. I substituted regular whipped cream cheese mixed with the well-drained crushed pineapple. I used Virginia ham and refrigerated the tortilla rolls overnight before slicing them. I took them to BUNCO night where they were a big hit.

I'm 18 years old and I made these more than once. I brought them to my friend's cabin over the summer and they were a hit. They were gone pretty quickly. I just used regular cream cheese and they were delicious.

I used this recipe for a "girls nite" at my church, and it went over well. I'll note that keeping the pineapple-cream cheese mixture away from the edges kept the filling from leaking out as I rolled them. I secured the wraps with toothpicks, then cut between them to make slices without having them get too goopy. Chilling them helps them hold together better. I wouldn't hesitate to make them again. Would be great for a shower or luncheon.

These went over well at the tropical-themed party I brought them to. I made them according to the recipe, except I added a dash of nutmeg and red pepper to the cream cheese mixture. I give only four stars because the pineapple made the roles a bit hard to work with, and the finished product didn't hold a round shape very well.

I coulnd't find the whipped pineapple cream cheese, so I used regular cream cheese.  I drained the pineapple as much as I could. I put them in the refrigerator for 5 hours before I cut them up. However, the pinwheels did turn out quite mushy - maybe next time I will use Lebanese bread instead of the tortila.  The kids really enjoyed them though. I will make them again.

These didn't go over that great at my get together.  But I didn't use the pineapple cream cheese.  Maybe they would have had more flavor if I did.

It was very yummy!  I could not find whipped pineapple cream cheese so I used regular cream cheese and the crushed pineapple and added honey ham.  People seemed to enjoy them very much . . . no leftovers!

They came out ok - I used plain whipped cream cheese and added some BBQ sauce.  I will add some Swiss cheese next time.  I took to a pot luck and They all went so that was the important thing.

These turned out to be great, when I served them during game night with friends.  I made a few minor changes.....I bought several different thinly sliced meats (honey ham, roasted turkey breast, smoked chicken breast) and used regular lo cal cream cheese, omitted the pineapple and added shredded sharp cheddar and mozzarella cheeses, cut in half white grapes and some chopped walnuts.  Then I rolled up the tortillas, wrapped them tightly in plastic wrap and put them in the fridge for a couple of hours.  How easy could this be?!?!  You could really be creative with different deli types of  meats, chopped scallions, rough cut basil or tarragon and cheeses or nuts!  I love smoked Gouda and Brie cheese, slivered almonds or chopped pecans, or  use sliced strawberries, instead of grapes or pineapple. This is my new go to for a quick lunch, snack, tapas, take away for a church pot luck or feeding the family on game night!  I can always make these ahead, refrigerate them and cut them just before serving.  Depending on what you put on your tortillas, you could even freeze these.  Let your imagination go wild!
