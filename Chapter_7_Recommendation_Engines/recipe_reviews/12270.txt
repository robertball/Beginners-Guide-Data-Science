This is wonderful!!  The consistency of mincemeat pie -- the wonderful tang of cranberries.

I made this pie for Chistmas last year and again for Mother's Day and let me say, it is such a simple and tasty pie.  I use a good sugar substitute made for baking as we have diabetics in the family and this pie still turned out perfect.  I was afraid it would be too sour but it was just lovely! This will be featuring at our family table as a regular from now on!

I am not a big raisin fan. So I added 2 granny smith apples to the mix instead of raisin. Pie turned out wonderful.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and it was wonderful!!! I left out the rasins but didn't add any other fruit as a substitute.  My family thought it was wonderful and the whole pie was eaten!  Very easy to make as well, I'll make it again next year!
