Finally, an AUTHENTIC margarita recipe. If you think margarita mix or frozen limeade + tequila is yummy, or you like "blended" margaritas, this might be more than you bargained for. If you like margaritas the way God intended them (on the rocks, with salt, made from scratch) you can't do better than this. Using fresh limes means you might taste some differences from batch to batch. Too sour? Add a dash more triple sec. If you don't have any Rose's Lime Juice you can just skip the "sweetened lime juice" part. I often make them with just 5 parts tequila, 4 parts triple sec, and 3 parts FRESH lime juice and they are fine. Just keep in mind, this is a serious cocktail for people with grownup palates.

This was wonderful. For anyone who isn't armed with knowledge of Tequila. Try using Sauza Hornitos or El Tesoro. Cuervo is a no-no. Mexicans won't touch the stuff.

Best margarita I have ever personally made....I HIGHLY recommend.  The secret is definitely in the fresh lime juice.  Thanks!

If you're lookin' for "Knock You On Your Tail" Margaritas - Here ya go!!  We used silver Petron (TALK ABOUT SMOOTH TEQUILA!).  Which I would recommend, but don't be heavy handed - take the time to measure out the ounces.  (I made the foolish mistake of letting the husband prepare the second round...)

I'm a big fan of fresh lime juice margaritas (I despise sour mix!!) but these were a little too strong and too tart for me. I added some sugar and that helped out a lot. VERY strong as written, but on the plus side, they were good for sipping as they still had kick even as the ice melted and they watered down.

We really liked this, but after the first batch, we cut the tequila down to 4 ounces - they were just a tad too strong as written (and we like to drink!).

These were a big hit!!!  I made jugs of them and used Raspberry Cordial instead of sweetened lime juice to make Pink Margaritas. Also made them in a blender with ice so I could make a larger amount in one go. Thanks for the fab recipe!

These were not bad, but not the best I've had. I think its better to just stick with fresh limes and skip the sweetened lime juice.

I made this recipe for cinco de mayo and they were a hit.  They taste just like the margaritas served in authentic mexican restaurants.  I didn't have time to squeeze fresh lime juice, so I bought a bottle of the pre squeezed and they were still excellent.  This recipe is going into my family recipe book!

This is a great recipe! I'm not a fan of overly sweet drinks, and found this the perfect combination. Tart and fresh tasting.

Very Good! I recommend a good quality orange liqueur like Cointreau®  or Grand Marnier®, or slightly cheaper Gran Gala® instead of triple sec. it's worth it! Also make sure you used fresh lime juice as stated. warning: it is strong! :)

I was looking for a margarita recipe that replicated the one from our local Mexican restaurant, and this is it!  Love the fresh lime juice -- it is what makes this drink.  I did back off on the tequila after the first batch because I do not like to taste the tequila over everything else, so I notched it back to 4 oz. instead.  GREAT drink, though -- just what I was looking for.

Wow! Amazing.  Used store bought lime juice and added sugar because that is what I had.  I blended up 1 1/2 limes in the blender with all the liquor added salt to the glasses and put it over ice.  Drinking it down while I type.  Refreshing!!!

Our first attraction to the recipe was the simplicity of it.  No razzle dazzle blender action.  Shooka shooka done.  After mixing our first batch, we lessoned the edge of the second batch by adding an additional  half ounce of the sweetened lime juice and an additional ounce of fresh lime juice to the cocktail.  Overall, we were very pleased(and intoxicated) with our magical margarita Sunday Funday.

Awesome!  I used a nice golden tequila and added a smidge of sugar rather than sweetened lime juice.  I had my girlfriends over for mexican dinner and served these.  They LOVED them.  So much better than the mixes!

Since our last name is Parker, I saw this recipe and felt like we should give them a try. SO glad we did! The only thing we did different was adding a tsp. of sugar instead of the sweetened lime juice. Thanks for a great recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly so that I can honestly rate it. I think that it is awful when people change things and then say they didn't like it or even worse when they just read the ingredients and base that for rating. How unfair is that???So, here goes my honest critique: I thought the drink was a little too strong and not sweet enough, also, a lot of work. I think I will stick to my margarita mix and just play a little w/ that. Thanks for the recipe, though...just not that crazy about it.

These are the best margaritas ever!  I have used this recipe many times and they are always a hit.  When serving these, however, I do warn my guests that they are very strong.  This is the only recipe I will use!!

This is a great basic recipe for a margarita.  Keep in mind, the quality of the ingredients is key.  Mexican limes are more expensive than the cheap Peruvian limes we often see in the store, but Mexican limes are also sweeter and often have more juice per lime.  Using any tequila that is not 100% blue agave is a waste of time and money with this recipe.  In addition to triple sec, I recommend a Grand Marnier floater, as  it makes the difference in any margarita.  Too sour? Try adding agave nectar instead of  simple syrup.

Simply delicious!  I typically hate margaritas because they are made with mix and overly sweet...but these were perfect! I used cointreau instead of triple sec and used all fresh lime juice instead of part sweetened lime juice.  I did add a little extra lime juice because it tasted more balanced to me.  I will definitely be making these again!  mmmmm

As good as any I've had at a restaurant, though still somewhat too sweet for my taste.  Apparently, the International Bartenders Association says a margarita should be 7 parts tequila, 4 parts Cointreau/triple sec, 3 parts lime juice.  This recipe is 5:3:4 if you include the Rose's with the lime juice.  This is a seriously strong drink, though, so I tried not to go overboard and went with 7:4:4 this time (no Rose's).  Still strong, but a little overly sour - I think the bartender's might have the right proportions here!  Will have to try again!

As others have said, high-quality ingredients are going to give the best results.  I paid what I was comfortable with for a "reposado" tequila, which is aged, and is smoother than regular, but you can do better with anejo, which is aged longer. I went with Patron's orange liqueur - half the price of Cointreau - because I couldn't tolerate the idea of putting $4 de Kuypers triple sec in with my $20 tequila!  I'll go the next price up on tequila next time, though - this one didn't even have a cork, and I felt like it got shamed by my Patron triple sec... ;)  Cheers!!

Way too limey/sour as written. Next batch I will skip the sweetened lime juice, and opt for simple syrup instead.

This is an excellent recipe. I'm with Parker in that I don't use Margarita mix unless I absolutely have to for some reason. 
I don't use sweetened lime juice but it sounds like a good idea. Otherwise this is just the way I make them. Since limes are half the price of lemons these days, it is easy to buy a bunch of limes, use a juicer and make a big batch of coctails, freezing the extra lime juice for another day. 

I also make a diet version with orange extract and splenda instead of Triple Sec. It has to be customized for the individual's taste as to how much of each one uses of each but it helps lower the calories.

Absolutely the best margarita recipe out there. Almost as easy as pouring some far inferior mix out of a plastic jug. We make our own simple syrup and use it in place of the sweetened lime juice. Just delicious.

The secret to a great Margarita is decent tequila Just use 100% Agave, no blends,  and you will be fine. I like Suaza Blue  Resposada at  about $10.00 a bottle

 A little orange a little lime and ice

This was too strong/tart for my liking, but the hubby downed it easily, so we will probably make it again!  I just have much more of a sweet tooth, but so long as you get a good tequila (Sauza Blue Silver is my go-to since it's so smooth and fresh-tasting) and some fresh limes, you will be good to go.  If you want it sweeter yourself, you can always add some simple syrup to the mix.

Wow-- these were so good and easy to make! I had to try them since we spent our honeymoon in Zijhuatenejo. We didn't have the sweetened lime juice, but they were great without it. I was never a fan on margaritas on the rocks, but now I'm converted--I'm never using one of those mixes again!

We love a good margarita ~ this one was tasty enough, but It was hard to get past the taste of straight tequila (we used Don Julio Silver). I'd have given 5 stars if we'd followed the advice of other reviewers and cut back on the tequila a little. 
On a positive note ~ my better half was positively loopy after one margarita. :)

I love this cocktail. Has become my before dinner drink.  I splurged and bought Cointreau. Also I prefer silver tequila.  For one drink I juice 2 limes. Serve in a low ball glass with the coarse salt!

Will certainly make again. I substituted a wine spirit called "Sublime" that we picked up in Australia since I didn't have the sweetened lime juice. Needed to add about 1 ounce of simple syrup as well.

This is what I have been looking for ...  I found it quite tart so I added agave syrup on next batch and I have to say near  perfect. I upped the quality of tequila to hornitos  per another review and I don't need to say more.

Loved it! These are fairly strong but taste great! I recommend using an agave tequila for a smoother flavor but they are good even with bottom shelf tequilas because the mix is so good.

Ooooohhhhh!  Yes, make this.  We sliced a jalepeno, removed the seeds, and placed it inside a mason jar.  We filled the jar with Don Julio Resepado tequila, and let it marinate for two weeks.  Now, whenever we need tequila for a recipe (wow, that sounds bad doesn't it? We don't drink tequila EVERY night.  Sometimes it's rum, or vodka.), we pull the mason jar out of the fridge and build our delicious concoction.  We only used 4 oz of tequila (no judgments please, remember there's a whole jalepeno in there).  It was delicious and strong and delicious and by the fourth sip not so strong.

Not my favorite margarita. I use all fresh limes and lime juice, as well.

Excellent recipe and the allrecipes online function which adjusts for more or less servings is fantastic! Here is a VARIATION to the recipe to make it EASY but still tasty when you are lazy, busy, or serving a large group....1.  Substitute Santa Cruz Organic Pure Lime Juice (available at most major supermarkets in SOCAL) for fresh squeezed lime juice.  Any pure lime juice not-from-concentrate should work...2.  Purchase a bottle of Tres Agaves, Agave Nectar as an additional ingredient...Changes to Parker's Recipe:...Step 1: Tequila - NO CHANGE...Step 2: Fresh lime juice - SUBSTITUTE the Santa Cruz in the same amount as the recipe...Step 3: Sweetened lime juice - SUBSTITUTE a combination of the Santa Cruz and Tres Agaves.  I prefer equal parts of the two and end up with the same total amount value as the recipe.  Step 3 is one area to experiment both with the Santa Crus / Tres Agaves mix combination and the total amount to add to the recipe...Step 4: Triple Sec - NO CHANGE...The rest of the recipe and the directions are the same...Enjoy

I added half a can of sprite to add more sweetness and make them less strong. Tasty.

Very good/fresh- I used coconut vodka for a completely different twist!
