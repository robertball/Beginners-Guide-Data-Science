I love salmon, but I don't get to make it that often because the Hubby is not a big fish fan!  I grilled the salmon, which gave it such a great flavor.  The salsa was to my surprise very very good, good enough to make and have with tortilla chips or any other type of mexican dish. The Hubby enjoyed, but just could not get him to "love" it. However I thought it was to die for. I will definately make this again, even if its only for myself!

I have made this salmon several times and we love it - I do not put the jalapeno in the salsa and use fresh pineapple.  Because of these changes I gave the recipe 4 stars instead of 5, but it is one of our favorites.
