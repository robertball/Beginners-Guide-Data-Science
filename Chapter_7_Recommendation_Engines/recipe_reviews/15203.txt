This was good, but I did make some small changes. I only used 1 can each of the soups. I stirred everything together in a large bowl before adding to baking dish, topped with shredded cheddar before baking. Everyone enjoyed it.

This always disappears like mad! However, we have made a minor change to the recipie. Instead of cheese soup, we add cream of broccoli cheese! Very delicious.

Wow! Who would think something so quick and easy to put together would taste so good!! Had my daughter and son-in-law for dinner and served an entree that took hours to make and all they did was rave about this broccoli casserole! My daughter, who doesn't cook much, asked for the recipe. This is definately a keeper for regular meals as well as Holiday dinners. Thanks, Lynnmarie!!

My Family did not like this recipe, nor did I.  It was overkill on the cheese sauce and it tasted like it had too many preservatives in it, even though I used Fresh Broccoli instead of Frozen.  I will make my own version, using my cheese sauce recipe, (from my Mac and Cheese Recipe) and fresh Broccoli.  A Sprinkle of Parmesan on top will make it perfect.  I will submit the recipe as soon as I get it set up.

This was very easy to make and tasty!  I omitted the croutons because others said they turned out soggy.  It was very soupy, which I liked, but some people might not.

Very disappointed. There was far too much sauce, as well as it being bland and "fake cheese" tasting.  It made for a bland, soggy mess.  While the general idea behind this recipe sounded good, I don't know if it can be made so, and I have no interest in trying.

I made this during the holidays as something a little different to serve as a side.  I wish I hadn't.  No one at it :-(

It was good.  I used broccoli florets - next time I will use chopped as stated in the recipe.  I am sure that would make it better.

I served this very easy casserole to my family for the first time on Christmas. My grown son had three helpings and he doesn't even like broccoli! I will definitely make this again.

This was an easy and quick recipe to make. I used fresh broccoli and steamed it and then let it drain and cool. I added only 1 can of cheddar soup with the 2 cans of cream of chicken. I mixed the broccoli, soups, and croutons all together. I sprayed my casserole with Pam and put all the ingredients in and topped the casserole with shredded cheddar cheese. It turned out wonderful! Thx!

Pretty good. I used Stove Top Canister stuffing crumbs and they didn't get soggy at all. Excellent for last minute pot-lock and when you don't want to spend a lot of money or invest a lot of time.

Didnâ€™t make any changes.  Very bland and boring.  Maybe add croutons just on top instead of mixing in.

I made this for my family and day care kids and everyone loved it! The only thing I did was added some cut up chicken breast to it. Totally easy to make and well worth it. Adding it to my list of dinners for sure!

Our family enjoyed this, but with a few changes.  I used only 1 can of each soup.  Next time, will omit croutons entirely- we all felt that they were ok, but not something we would want again.  The sauce (halved) was perfect with the broccoli.

Should have known that the croutons would be "soggy". Can't stand soggy bread. The soups together were pretty good togehter on the broc,  but I ended up throwing the remainder away due to the stuffing mix. Sorry....
