High marks for flavor, texture and presentation. I followed the recipe/directions as written.  I got the aji amarillo chili paste online from the retailer that begins with a W.  The aji gives it a unique zing with a smoldering heat that does not present initially. The dish is an unusual blend of flavors and textures that really work well together. I used 6 oz ramekins and had enough for 6 servings.  The dish is labor intensive with many steps (and lots of dirty dishes) but I would say it was worth it.  It was excellent!
