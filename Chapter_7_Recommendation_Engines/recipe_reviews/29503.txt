Adding more flavor to the stuffing would help.  Crabmeat (usually in seafood stuffings), garlic, seasoned bread crumbs, etc, makes a big difference.  When "stuffing" the shrimp curl the tail down into the stuffing so it holds it in place.  Also...drizzle with butter and you will get a tastier and more attractive shrimp.  We served ours with home-made hollandaise and everyone loved it.  A very simple recipe!

I didn't use any crackers but processed fresh bread crumbs from an herb bread that I made several days ago. I also sauteed minced onion and red pepper in butter and then added the crumbs to toast them a bit. For some extra added goodness I added crab meat to the mixture and made a roasted garlic and butter sauce to spoon over the top. Yum!

This is a great recipe! A fast and easy way to dress up prawns. I found that it was easier for me to layer the prawns in the pan, and top them with the crumb mixture....I'm sure that wouldn't work so good for dipping them after, but is great as a dinner main dish. Thank you for offering it:)

This was great. I used a lot of ritz crackers, and
not as much bread crumbs. After I made the stuffing, I drizzed a mixture of melted butter
and white wine over it.

I made this dish one afternoon for myself and happened to have quite a bit of shrimp.  All of a sudden my sister showed up unexpecteldly with a friend.  They are still calling me to tell me how much they enjoyed it.  They could not believe this was the first time I had prepared the dish.  I must admit I added a small onion, mayonaise and McCormic Season All.  I wanted to add celery but I forgot to buy some.

I tried this recipe and it was the most disgusting dinner I think I have ever made.  I took one bite and threw it all away.  I ended up microwaving frozen pizza.

This recipe was very easy to make. It tasted good but the shrimp were a little dry. (Maybe it was just my oven.) Next time I make it I will drizzle a small amount of melted butter over the shrimp before I place it in the oven. Otherwise, I enjoyed making and eating this seafood treat.

I loved this meal!!!! I felt so proud to have made it. It was definitely a new level of cooking for me, yet was so easy. However, I had difficulty putting the filling in the tiny shrimp. But don't let that scare you away from this recipe. I just pressed it down firmly with my hands and tried to prop them up in the pan so not everything would fall out. And it worked!!! I served it with cocktail sauce and store-bought crabcakes and rice. It was a hit with my husband! We felt like we were at a real seafood restaurant. Can't wait to make again!

These were great.  I used Ritz crackers instead of the soda crackers and added 6 oz lump crabmeat.  I also sauteed a 1/2 small onion and 1/4 lb chopped fresh mushrooms with 2 cloves chopped garlic and added to the mixture.  Yummy!

Very good I used minced onions, green onions (tops only), fresh garlic, fresh bread crumbs, mayo, evoo, fresh parsley, jack cheese, lobster meat, parma cheese, cayenne pepper, seasoning salt and fresh ground peppercorn and garlic seasoning. I left out the cackers and the worcestershire. The shrimp came out very pretty looking and they tasted great.

I don't think I'd serve this as a main course, but it is a wonderful appetizer!  I made it for a Christmas party that I catered & guests raved over it!  I used very large shrimp (13-15ct), quadrupled the recipe.  Next time I would only double it for the number served (20) as it is very rich.  Brought the leftovers home, it's delicious cold too!

This was definitely a great start... I added some sauteed onion, garlic and red pepper and crabmeat.  Brushed on some Melted butter and White wine while cooking and once they were out of the oven.  Good stuff!

Very good recipe, though I did alter it a bit. I used low fat Ritz crackers (better flavor than soda crackers),lite butter, and did not add bread crumbs but instead added two cans of drained crab meat. I also added some Old Bay seasoning for additional flavor. I doubled the recipe and only 5 were left. Fantastic!

I've made this recipe in a similar way, but have a few additions: Fresh garlic, minced;paprika,Italian seasonings,minced scallions and Italian Breadcrumbs.
Lots of butter to "blend" it all together,and don't bake it for 20 mins..
15 is plenty and pour melted butter after coming out of the oven. 
Easy, can be made ahead, and always a hit!
Use BIG shrimp (13/lb.)

These did not turn out well for me. The shrimp curled up and the stuffing went all over. I'm sure I did something wrong, but I don't know what. Maybe I'll try again in the future.

A good starter! I actually used this to stuff flounder fillets. I rolled the fish around them so they made rosettes, put them on a baking sheet and cooked them on the grill. I added old bay seasoning to the stuffing and drizzled the finished product with a little bit of butter at the end and it came out great. I used regular crackers and it came out just a bit too salty, so I'd use breadcrumbs or unsalted crackers next time. I also added 1 egg white so that it all stayed together. 
Very good!

Awesome & easy! I increased the breadcrumbs and eliminated the crackers. I also added some italian seasoning and used real garlic. Absolutely delicious! My 4 year old help prepare it, it could not have been easier! Definitely making this one again!

This was great! I did add the crabmeat as suggested by a few other reviewers, and did have to top off with a little extra seasoning, but outside of that, no complaints :)

Great recipe. I did change it a little bit. I used all bread crumbs and no cracker crumbs. I also did not put in the wine. I dizzled butter over them before I baked them. They were delicious.

These are pretty tasty - although the breading was a little dry. I really liked the flavor but my husband was iffy about it. I think if I left out the Worcestershire and used water instead of the white wine, he might've liked it better. Or I might just make these again sometime just for myself!

OK I have to be honest, I screwed this one up.  My shrimp were pre-cooked rather than raw so I had to do everything in a skillet on the range, but it actually came out quite good.  I would hold back some of the wine because it was a bit overpowering, other than that we enjoyed!

I think other reviewer's suggestions of adding crab to the stuffing would probably make a substantial difference. Fresh herbs would also add some zing.

Very easy and very good! I served it with rice pilaf as the main dish. Even my two year old ate it! It's a little time consuming, but I think you can buy shrimp that's been butterflied already to save some time. I stuffed 20 jumbo prawns and still had leftover stuffing. After reading the reviews, I added crabmeat,mayo,onions, eliminated the crackers, and just used 1/4 cup white wine.  Oh, and I drizzled melted butter on top. YUMMY!!

Found this recipe very bland.  The stuffing did not "stick" to the
shrimp at all.  After making it I did not serve it because it tasted so bland.
If I'd make it again, I'd eliminate the crackers and the worcestershire sauce but increase the cheese to give it flavor.

After reading the reviews, I made the following changes: used only herbed bread crumbs instead of the crackers, used 2 cloves minced garlic instead of the garlic powder, added minced green onions, and garnished the finished shrimp with crumbled bacon.  Also increased the shrimp to 20 to hold the additions to the crumb mixture.  Next time might add some finely shredded cheddard cheese to the mixture.

We did not like this.  Maybe use all bread crumbs and not crackers, no Worcestershire, only a couple of tablespoons of wine, add chicken broth for moisture, too much garlic, I think add some savory, cayenne, and some other seasonings.

My husband & I loved this recipe and I can't wait to serve it to company. The only change was using Ritz crackers because I had those on hand. Served with parmesan baked asparagus. Great dinner. Lyndaz

This was so yummy! BUT you need HUGE prawns. The largest ones available here would not stay together. Despite the fact is was more casserole like, it was still delicious!

I agree to reduce the crackers and breadcrumbs--I actually modified this recipe based around a crab stuffing, so I added fresh lemon juice with the crab, fresh parsley, some mayo & spices but would definitely reduce the breading next time.  We were shooting for a crab stuffed shrimp, so it is a work in progress.  I used toothpicks to hold the sides together so the stuffing remained intact.

I also used real garlic and green onion to add some extra flavor.  I took a hint from another shrimp recipe I have and slighty pre-cooked some bacon and wrapped it around the stuffed shrimp before baking.  It adds flavor and keeps the stuffing inside.

Great flavor in the stuffing.  Substituted Ritz crackers for soda crackers and used a little less butter.  Next time I'll use a little more white wine for a better texture in the stuffing.

I was upset because I had brought the wrong size shrimp.  I brought large instead of jumbo.  I went ahead and made it anyway.  My family loved it.  It was time consuming to stuff the small shrimp but I can say that is was worth it.  We now have a new party appetizer.
