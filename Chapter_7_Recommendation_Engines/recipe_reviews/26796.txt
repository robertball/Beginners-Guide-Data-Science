Delicious tortillas, but it's not necessary to fry these. I lightly brushed melted butter over the tortillas, sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar and just baked. The sugar caramalized beautifully and the kids said they tasted like Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal. Due to fruit allergies, I had to eliminate the apples and kiwi, but it was still wonderful just with the berries and bananas. If you have any leftover chips, use them as a base and top with caramel swirl icecream, caramel sauce, chocolate whipped cream and a few chocolate curls. Makes a really pretty presentation! Thanks Crissy!

I too sprayed my chips w/ butter flavor spray & then sprinkled w/ cinamon sugar & baked at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes. I added blueberries to the mix & I didn't peel my apple. The only thing I iwll do differently next time is dip the apple pieces in some lemon juice to prevent discoloring. My guests really enjoyed this...thanks!

Also added: fresh pineapple, red grapes, pears, and   mandrin oranges, didn't use banana though.  Used Fruit Fresh too to keep colors bright.  This is an awesome appetizer to serve guests, tastes like fresh fruit pie.  Chopping isn't too tedious if you used a chopper (mine is by Pampered Chef)  *kids love to help chop.

Wow! This needs to come with a warning: Highly Addictive! This was a beautiful combination of colors and flavors. And no matter what assortment of fresh fruit you use it's bound to be good so use your favorites and use the recipe as a guide. I added chopped peaches to mine I baked the chips vs. frying to keep this a little healthier and lower in fat. So, for the cinnamon chips I used reduced fat tortillas and cut them with a pizza cutter which made things a lot easier. I sprayed them with butter flavored Pam and sprinkled them with the cinnamon sugar. I baked them at 350 for 8 minutes flipped them and baked them for another 7 minutes. They were crispy, sweet and delicious - next time I would double the amount because they went fast. This got a lot of compliments not only for taste, but for creativity. I'll definitely make this again - great recipe!

I'm going to be one of those people you hate, because I'm rating this from the original recipe and the modifications I made.  I don't think I would've liked the salsa if I had followed the recipe to a T.  

My salsa: 2 kiwi, 2 mangos, 2 pink ladies, 8oz raspberries, 2 tsp sugar, 3 tbsp strawberry preserves, and some lime juice to prevent oxidation of the banana and apple.  Chips I used cinnamon sugar from Whole Foods.  Next time I might cut down on the apple and add another fruit 
(blueberries or peaches or both)

Today, I went to school, I had a test in science and I think I did pretty well. I came over to my friend Laura's house. We went to the store with her brother. When we were in the car, we heard Boys Like Girls, but I personally like boys. Then we heard Taylor Swift and Doug (the brother previously mentioned) is in love with Taylor Swift. I mean, not a celebrity crush. He is convinced he will marry her. Don't be surprised if the next headline is "Taylor Swift engaged to.... Doug?" He freaked out and started singing along to the song. He almost crashed the car! He's not the best at driving stick shift but he thinks he is... SEW we just play along. We bought some stuff to make drink concoctions that can't be said, because they are secret, but they were good!!! Then we got home. We decided to play truth or dare, and we did some pretty nasty dares. I had to lick the floor!  (Yes, we're 5 years old.) THEN, Laura had this great idea to make these chips! We went on Google and searched: Mexican cinnamon sugar tortilla chips. Then, we decided we didn't need the Mexican part so we took that out. And guess what popped up? This recipe! We just made them as they were directed (the baked version) We had to make some revisions though. We put the tortilla triangles in a bowl and covered them with Pam (the cooking spray) We tossed them around with some cinnamon sugar and baked 'em. Then we plated them with some whipped cream. They were very good, though the time stated was incorrect. Awesome!!!

This is my new favorite appetizer.  I used frozen strawberries and omitted the bananas and served with wheat thin chips instead of the chips noted here due to time constraints.  I couldn't stop eating them.  Got rave reviews from others too.

Alternate method for cinn. chips:  Cut tortillas as described into equal wedges.  Place on wax or parchment paper in single layer; spray both sides with buttered flavored oil.  Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar on both sides; bake for 7 minutes in 350 degree oven.  Delish!  A bit messy getting cinn. sugar everywhere! Worth it! These are very good with the fruit salsa.

Nice, refreshing.  I brought it to a baby shower and it was a hit. As always, I didn't measure exact amounts but used all the ingredients listed and it came out great.

This has become a favorite at our house.  I spray the chips with Pam and then sprinkle them with the cin./sugar mix and bake.  Everyone is always asking for the recipe.  Thanks for sharing it.

This is a great snack! We take it to volleyball tournaments and the girls LOVE IT!!! I definitely change it up and add different fruits - i usually reduce the sugar and they never know it.

Good.  A little too much cinnamon in the fruit for me.  I brushed the tortillas with butter and baked them at 350 for 15 min.

I've never made this the same way twice but it is always a hit.  My 4 year old and I do this recipe together...lots of fun! I probably use more sugar that I toss on the strawberries.  I use 2+ apple varieties like granny smith and gala; I also usually leave out the bananas because they go bad too fast. Without them the dish is GREAT overnight & leftovers a few days later! I cut my apples first and coat them with lime juice so they don’t brown (Key Lime juice is nice too)--then I add everything else.  I’ve also used Pumpkin Spice for a more “fall” flavor and sometimes toss in some grape jelly to make it thicker.  For the tortillas I have ALWAYS gone the oven route with butter flavored cooking spray and a generous coating of cinnamon and sugar.  After doing this about a dozen times here’s my cutting guide:  Cut 4 tortillas at a time (stacked) using a sharp pizza cutter.  Cut vertically in to 4 strips (cut in half, then half the 2 halves for 4 even strips), then cut horizontally the same way for a total of 16 even piles of “squares”…actually it will be 12 squares and 4 corners because the tortillas are round.  Remove the corners from your cutting board and cut each set of squares diagonally.  For every tortilla you’ll get 28 triangular chips with no waste.   You can transfer them to the cookie sheet in nice tight rows with very little wasted space so you can spray, sugar and bake a lot at a time and not waste too much.  I can fit 6+ tortillas (168+ chips) on one cookie sheet.

For the tortillas, you simply brush them with WATER before sprinkling with the cinnamon sugar and bake @ 375 6-8 minutes or until crisp. Voila...no extra fat!

This was delicious!  I made it exactly has the recipe states.  Definitely need the apples for a bit of crunch and definitely need the raspberries for the tangy.  Otherwise, I could see this being too sweet as others have fussed.  I wouldn't change a thing and my friends raved.  The chips take some time, but are perfect with this "salsa".

I found the nutmeg in the salsa a little too much. I'll probably leave it out next time. I also simply brushed the tortillas with oil, sprinkled on the cinnamon sugar, and baked for 15 minutes at 350. Absolutely excellent!

Quick, easy and delicious!  Have made this several times and would reccommend frying the tortillas instead of spraying them with Pam and baking. A great hit for kids and adults!

This was really great.  Like other reviewers, I would bake the tortillas instead of frying.  Also, I added a pear to the mix and used one banana instead of two.  I also used splenda when the recipe called for sugar.  Really great, I got wonderful reviews from my family!

i loved these chips, but i didn't make the salsa. instead of frying the chips, i sprinkled the chips with cinnamon and sugar and baked them in the oven on 375 degrees farenheit for 4 1/2 minutes. very good!

This recipe was such a hit at my mom's 60th  birthday party.  The Tortilla chips were very easy to fix, the fruit on the other hand was a little more time consuming, but it was worth it.  Instead of banana's I used pineapples.......... so awesome!!

I followed the recipe exactly as listed. Turned out pretty well and was a hit with my family. Next time I would try it with other kinds a fuit added. Peaches or pears would be a nice addition.

Love this recipe and I baked the cinnamon chips like someone else recommended.   Cut tortillas into equal wedges. Place on wax paper in single layer; spray both sides with oil. put in bag of sugar & cinn.  to coat.  bake for 7 minutes in 350 degree oven. Delish!

I made this yesterday as an appitizer for the 4 th of July. I did change the fruit up a bit I used Watermelon, cantalope, Honeydew melon, Strawberries, bananas, Kiwis, and pinapple!! It's so good alone and yet even better with the chips. I made the chips as directed but I think I will try baking them next time!

Made this with low cholestrol flour tortillas.  I did use the plate in the sink to spray each tortilla and sprinkle the cinnamon and sugar on both sides.  I stacked them up in a pile and cut wedges using a pizza cutter.  I used pizza pans with holes in them and they really baked well.  For the fruit, I used no sugar.  Fruits: mango, strawberries, granny smith apple, and fuji apple, fresh pineapple, blueberries, kiwi, and 2 peaches.  This was a 5 star hit at a summer social...healthy and low calories.  Everyone went to their "smartphones and found the recipe!"

I served this at a shower. Lots of compliments. I added Danjo pears. Tried spraying the tortillas with spray butter and than baking them but it was no where as good as deep frying them.

I gave it a 4.  I think mine turned out too sweet.  I think its cause I used peaches in heavy syrup,I drained the can, but I think whats left on peaches was a lot.I also think I added too much preserves.  So it was kinda a runny fruit salad, but pretty good the first night, so now I know how to fix it to taste better.  great recipe, husband loved the tortilla chips, I just baked mine.

Very good and colorful. I made it for a family function and was asked for the recipe by two people. I baked the chips but only needed to cook them for about 8 min. Will definately make again, and a great idea for pot lucks.  **I made this again but didn't make the chips. I bought apple chips (cinnamon flavor) & it was a big hit! The flavor & textures blended nicely!

I am always looking for healthy food and snack recipes for my family and this recipe with only the slightest bit of change made my family VERY HAPPY!!!
I used 1 tablespoon of Splenda instead of the sugar in the salsa and brushed my whole wheat tortillas with applesauce instead of butter before baking them in a 350 degree oven for 15 minutes.  Thank you so much for the recipe!!!

Yeah, this one is a keeper.  We've used this as a companion to mexican foods.  Have also used this for "pot luck" when we need to bring something other than chips.  Everyone loves it!

Very easy, however I did what others suggested and baked the chips instead of frying them at 350 for about 10-12 minutes. Got rave reviews from everyone! Will make again- planning on using leftovers in my yogurt. Yum! :-)

I love this recipe. I accidentally put too much cinnamon and nutmeg in, but it still turned out wonderful! I baked the tortilla chips, too and I prefer the baked to fried.

This recipe is amazing.  I followed the author's option of baking the chips and they turned out beautifully.  I also left out the kiwi and nutmeg since I don't like them and added a peach and a nectarine.  I took this dish on a rafting trip and we inhaled every morsel. Also, I just got one of those "ultimate chopper" things and it definitely helps with the prep work.  I had this recipe done in about 5 minutes using my new gadget.

This recipe is awesome.  Originally, I thought it would be too sugary, but it's close to perfect.  I followed the recommendation of another reviewer, and purchased Trader Joe's cinnamon pita chips.  Again, it's perfect, serve it at your next party.

This was excellent - very pretty too.  I used everything listed in the recipe with the addition of blackberries. My apple of choice was 'Honey Crisp'.  I diced everything up too.  I used Apricot perserves.  I put in about 1/2 the sugar amount, based on other reviewers' comments.  You could probably omit the sugar all together because the tortilla chips have lots of sugar on them.  Lots of compliments and lots of requests for the recipe!  Yummy!

I made this as directed and added pear, pineapple, and blueberries. I doubled this recipe for a party and there still wasn't enough chips (that I baked instead of fried)! I used the remainder of my fruit salsa for smoothies and topping ice cream. I can imagine this recipe being amazing with a myriad of other fruity combinations too. I will definitely experiment some more next time. Mmm...

Super good, only instead of making chips, I pan fry the tortilla with cin./sugar and then spoon some of the salsa into the tortilla, fold it over and cut it up like quesadillas.  The sugar caramelizes and the tortilla forms a sort of hardened shell around the fruit.  It's amazing!  I think I'll make it again soon...

Pretty good.  Tastes like a cross between a strawberry-rhubarb and an apple pie.

Absolutely delicious! I don't think I'll add so much sugar to the salsa next time -- the fruit was sweet enough. I added another cup of strawberries and another apple and it was great!

I made this for a halloween party and it was a huge hit!  I carved out a pumpkin and used it as a bowl.  I did not use any of the added sugar suggested in the recipe and I used apricot sugar free preserve.  I also added blueberries simply because my 6 year old wanted to and it gave the salsa a nice added color and taste.  Making the chips was a bit time consuming and I agree with others that said next time try to buy them instead.

Good recipe. I added a pear because I had some lying around. Just make sure you eat it quickly. I made this for a snack for the family. Next time I will cut the recipe in half so we don't struggle to finish it.   I also bought cinnamon chips instead of making them.

This was OUTSTANDING!  My family gobbled it up.  I cut up 2 apples and added another cup of strawberries.  I replaced the banana with pineapple and added green grapes sliced up.  I baked the tortilla chips as reviewers had done and I used Country Crock margarine, melted, to save on calories.  The chips came out great and the kids enjoyed "painting" the tortilla wedges.  Thanks for such a GREAT recipe!!!!

This is fantastic!!!  My whole family ate it till it was gone.  It was the hit of the party. Even my six year old enjoyed it. The only thing I changed was I added blueberries as suggested by another reviewer. I am definitely keeping ahold on this recipe. Thank you so much for sharing it.

Excellent!! I made this to accompany a taco-bar dinner, and there were no leftovers. Everyone commented about how tasty it was and a couple of people asked for the recipe. I made the chips (baked instead of fried) and chopped some of the fruit the night before (it is a little time-consuming, but worth it). About 2 hours ahead of time, I chopped the remaining fruit (bananas and apples) and combine it all. The colors stayed bright. Very fresh tasting. The only change other than baking the chips was to add a plum to the mix. A nice change from plain, old fruit salad.

I made this for my housewarming party and it was the hit of the party.  I added about 2-3 ounces of Amaretto to the fruit dip, which made it even better!!
Chopping the fruit took FOREVER!! But sooo worth it :)

everyone raves over these when I make them -  I only use 1 banana, and go very light on the nutmeg, due to family preferences.

This is a great recipe. These fruits are so good together. And I was so happy when the cinnamon tortilla chips came out! I couldn't believe how easy they were to make and how good they were. You can even make them without the fruit.

What a great idea this recipe is!  Apparently, Fuji apples are not in season right now, so I used a Gala apple - did not peel it, which adds more nutrition and color.  I omitted the kiwis, and only used 1 banana and strawberries as suggested.  The combination was very good - but a little sweet, maybe because I omitted some fruit.  I love the little bit of lime - which I think is a big part of the overall flavor.  Instead of adding cinnamon & nutmeg, I used 3/4 tsp. apple pie spice.   I sprayed the tortilla chips with cooking spray and sprinkled with cinn/sugar mix, then baked them at 375 for 15 min - the chips were overbaked.  I will try baking at 350 next time. This recipe did get the "seal of approval" from my family (husband, and 2 elementary children).

This is wonderful recipe.  There are great reviews so far, but I need to add: using a chopper is awesome, and you should try using Tupperware's Cinnamon Vanilla spice in place of the cinnamon!  It's totally awesome and mouth watering!  Big hit at my Fourth of July party!!!!

Mmmm! I did change things up- I used two peaches instead of kiwis ( do not like). I soaked the apple, one banana and peaches in pineapple juice. Drained then added the strawberries, sugar & cinnamon.(do not like nutmeg) Chopped the fruit with a chopper not with a knife.

This was a hit at my New Year's party.  Great mixture of flavors!  I added blueberries as well and they were great.  I wouldn't recommend adding the nutmeg, however.  It just tasted sort of funny.  And I had to bake my tortilla pieces at 375 degrees for 15 min.  Other than that, it was an awesome recipe and I'll make it again!

I was invited to my boss' house for a dinner party and asked to bring a healthy appetizer or dessert. After scouring the internet, I chose to make this fruit salsa, and am I ever glad I did. It was a huge hit!! I have gotten so many compliments and requests for the recipe! I left out the bananas and added blueberries and pineapple, and it was so yummy! I baked the chips and they came out great. I knew I had a winner when my 17 year old son gave it a taste test before we left the house and informed me that I needed to make some for home! Will definitely be making this again!

Wow - this was just fantastic!  I also baked the tortilla chips (I used flax seed for added fibre) and the end result was outstanding!  The only change I made was to use pear in place of the kiwi because it's what I had on hand.

I made this and everyone loved it.  I didn't have time to make the cinnamon chips so I bought Apple Cinnamon Grove and Wild Berry Patch chips from "Flat Earth" made by Frito-Lay ad they were great.

And the chips are so incredibly easy to make!

This was so good! I halved it and just left out the cinnamon and nutmeg in the salsa, and also instead of shaking the chips in a bag with the cinnamon sugar, I just drained them on a paper bag and sprinkled them with the cinnamon sugar. My whole family loved it. My 4 year old son couldn't get enough. Definitely a favorite!

This was terrific!  I used Stacey's Pita Chips-cinn/sugar flavored.  My husband ate one of my kiwi's the night before so I thought mine needed some more tartness.  I added fresh bing cherries to it and that made it much better.  I think I'm going to put the leftovers on top of waffles.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

The fruit salsa did resemble more of a fruit salad vs. salsa.  It was good, but nothing to write home about.  Most of the fruits are not at their ripest this time of year, so that may have effected it slightly.  I also purchased the SunCrisp cinnamon chips to save time.  For variety I put the salsa and smashed chips over vanilla ice cream - yum!!

Everyone loved this.  I used fuji apples, peaches, strawberries and kiwi   and omitted the sugars.  I also changed the preserves to sugar free apricot.  It was delicious.

This was good, but wasn't a huge hit.  I think it is going to depend on your audience.  It was pretty sweet and I wished it didn't get so runny.

Made this for a girl's night and it was a hit. I tripled the recipe so had plenty of leftovers and they kept well for about a week. Easy to substitute whatever fruits you have on hand.

The description is true- the salsa is great if you throw in what you have on hand!  I used unpeeled apples, slightly unripe mangoes, and a banana.  Awesome!  I made my own tortillas and they fried very quickly- about 15 seconds per side.  Next time I'll bake or fry in shallow oil so they don't get quite so crunchy.

It took a really long time to cut up all of the fruit.  I didn't fry the tortillas.  I brushed them with butter, cinnamon and sugar, and baked them at 350 for about 6 minutes until they were crispy. My son liked the crispy, sweet tortilla triangles all by themselves. So I was really glad I spent the time cutting up the fruit. :)

I made this for a picnic. There were about 40 people there. 30 of them wanted the recipe. The other 10 were too busy eating the salsa & chips to ask. I added blackberries to the mixture because I had some on hand from the Farmer's Market.  They added color & a bit of tartness/texture. Definitely a "make again"!

This is a great recipe.  In the winter try it w/cranberries (canned) instead of strawberries, it's very nice. Also in addition to the lime or instead of used fresh orange juice and zest from the orange

I made this for a family get together yesterday and I'm really disappointed....disappointed that I wasn't making this ALL summer long! Super easy to make and incredibly yummy.  Everyone loved it and it was the first thing to disappear.  I followed the recipe exactly (except to double it), but I would think you could use whatever fruit you wanted & still have it turn out fabulous.  Thanks Chrissy K for a great summer recipe!

A nice change to chips and salsa.  I baked the chips and add a bit of strawberry preserves to give it a bit of liquid but omited the sugar.  I also tossed the apples and bananas with the line juice then incorporated it to prevent them from turning brown.  The chips are my favorite.  Will make again.

I make something very similar and it is great!  I serve it with graham crackers, instead of the tortilla chips and chop everything with my chopper (tupperware) and it is so easy.  THe problem is keeping the fruit around long enough to make it!

This hit the spot!  Easy to make, very kid friendly to make also. A few minor changes, just because of what we had on hand, Didn't have kiwi, so replaced with pineapple (happened to have some fresh from the night before) Although we DID NOT fry the tortilla , we simply spread out the cut tortilla on a wired cooling rack, set the wired rack in a jello roll pan to catch any droppings of cinnamon sugar, sprayed one side with butter flavored Pam, sprinkled with cinnamon sugar, then flipped them all and repeated on the back side. Popped them in a warm oven (350) for about 8-10 minutes (I could smell the cinnamon sugar, so that was my cue to pull them out). They disappeared in mere minutes!  I had served black bean soup and salsa for supper (recipe from AR), this was a nice compliment to the meal.  WILL be making these again.

Five stars all the way!  I made this for a Thanksgiving appetizer and everyone LOVED it (except my weird uncle who thought it needed more hot sauce..."salsa without hotsauce??").   I also added a mango and baked the chips instead of frying them.  I will definitely make this again!!

I didn't try the salsa but I made the chips. I cut the tortillas with a flower cookie cutter and put the cinnamon sugar mixture in a ziplock bag and then threw the spray butter coated tortilas in the bag and shook. I then baked for 5 minutes, flipped them and baked for another 5 minutes. I didn't fry. If you do not flip the chips get a bit burnt and sticky at the bottom. I added a pinch of salt to the mixture so it wouldn't be sooooo sweet like it is if you choose not to add this ingredient. These were pretty good. The texture wasn't exactly like a chip but over all good.

Dont over bake tortillas. Spray tortillas with better, sprinkle generously with cinnamon and sugar. Bake on cookie sheet for 8-10 min (take them out before browning starts). Sprinkle with extra sugar after removing from oven.

Replaced bananas with a fresh diced peach and baked the tortilla chips rather than fried.  It was a big hit. I will make it again!

Wonderful as-is and modified.  Instead of using chips, try jicama cut into chip-like pieces.  Or substitute the apples for a different fruit in the salsa and thinly slice the apple to use as chips.

It was a hit at my gathering!  Someone suggested using local honey instead of white sugar and I just might as I plan to make this again. :)  So pretty and perfect for a party.

This was such a HIT at a party I hosted last night.  At first, people weren't really going for it, but all it took was for one person to make some "oohs" and "aahs", and then the rest of my guests devoured the entire bowl!  Thanks for a wonderful, simple recipe!

This was really good.  I did the baked chips option to make it healthier and skipped the nutmeg (just because we are not fans).

I told my husband I could make more chips and he said "Why?  I'll just spoon it up - this is good!"

Ok, well, I'm a student in highschool, and I'm also taking spanish class. we were having a party and I came across this recipe and wanted to try it out.  I'm so glad that I did beacuse it was the favorite of the entire class!  I really enjoy the freedom the dish allows because adding your favorite doesn't alter the taste. You know what they say, one bad apple... but it just isn't the case, so Thank you Crissy K for the awesome recipe!  I'm using it again tonight for our Cinco de Mayo celebration tomorrow. The class is counting on me!

We had a family baking day and I made this as snack as we baked!  My family loved it!  They all stood over the bowl of salsa and chips eating it, they couldn't put it down.  My grandfather ate the chips for his supper- he loved it.  This is a fabulous recipe.  It blends so many flavors.  It's also very quick and easy.

Left out the bananas and instead added more fresh seasononal fruit -- raspberries, strawberries and blueberries -- along with the kiwi and apples. This is great and the kids loved it. I also did my chips in the oven. Presentation is beautiful.

Add in any kind of fresh berry. Blueberry is our favorite.
Who needs chips. A big hit at Christmas Party with frozen berries.

Since the person who submitted this recipe said they are a dump and pour kind of cook, I did the dump and pour type of thing with this, and it was AMAZING!!!

What I used: strawberries, 2 kiwi, canned peaches (drained), canned pears (drained), blueberries quartered, 1 gala apple, 1 banana

What I did: I cut up the apple and banana last then mixed it in a separate bowl and added some fresh squeezed lime into the bowl.  I mixed that around to coat the banana and apple, then I dumped it all into the bowl with the rest of the fruit.  We ended up using just over 2 T. of sugar, and we just sprinkled a little cinnamon into it.  Honestly, we probably could've just left the cinnamon out of the fruit, and it wouldn't have changed the taste at all.  Instead of taking time make the cinnamon & sugar tortillas, we got some cinnamon & sugar pita chips and some cinnamon graham crackers from the store.  

It was just as delicious the second day as it was the first day, and none of the fruit at turned brown.  We will be making this again for sure.  We didn't eat it, we INHALED it! :)

We shared this with people who are diabetic and/or have other health issues where they can't eat seeds, but with everything cut up small they could eat a little bit without going overboard quickly (ie. better portion control), and it is delicious even without anything to dip it with.

It was delicious.  I brought it to a party and everyone loved it.  The only thing I would do differently was to cook the chips longer  so they would be crispier.
