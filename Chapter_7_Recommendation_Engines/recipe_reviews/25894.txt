I have to give credit where credit is due.  I have tried many recipes from this sight and I will have to say that this one is probally my favorite so far.  My whole family loves this.  It is my husbands favorite dish and my youngest son which is 9 says that this corn "rocks".  I do suggest using 1 and 1/2 (16 oz.) pkgs. of corn, 1/4 tsp. of pepper, and 1 tsp. of salt.  I also think that it is best to heat all the ingredients except for the corn on the stovetop before placing in the crockpot.  Start on high in the crockpot and cook for one hour.  Turn to low and cook for around 3-4 hours.  This one is realy good.

This was great.  Everyone loved it at my Thanksgiving dinner.  I did use two packages of frozen corn.  I also took the advice of other users and melted the cream cheese and butter together then added to the crock pot.  This was very easy and good.

Made this yesterday and it was very easy but I see why people have said in their reviews it is like corn with cream sauce instead of creamed corn.  It is the texture of the corn.  My advice (I wish I would have done this) use 2 bags frozen white corn (of course fresh is better but if you don't have fresh corn).  Put one bag in the blender or food processer with the 1/2 cup milk.  Combine bag of whole corn and blender corn in crock pot.  I think the cream cheese and butter could be reduced also.  Just ok, the recipe, I am sticking to my mom's tried and true, melt a stick of butter in pan add flour, add 2 bags white corn 1 blended in blender one whole, add milk and cook on stove top, she added pepper too, (mom :) rip).

We loved this yummy sidedish!  I didn't have frozen corn so I added 3 drained cans of regular corn instead and it came out perfect.  I changed nothing else.  Certainly a once in awhile thing with all the butter and cream cheese but I might try it out next time with a butter substitute and lower calorie cream cheese and see how that works out.  Thanks for a FANTASTIC recipe!

Yummy! I’ve never made homemade cream corn before. I cut the corn off  4 leftover ears and added a can of fiesta corn and a can of plain corn kernels that I had. As others said it seemed to need more corn for the amount of cream sauce that it makes. Do stir after your chunks of cream cheese and butter are at the melting point in your crock pot. They do not disperse evenly on their own. Flavor was more savory and corny than sweet if you do not add more sugar than the recipe calls for, but I really liked that. The cream cheese did not give it a big cheesey taste either. I love cheese but I wasn’t trying to make cheese corn. Much different and more gourmet tasting than the stuff in the can. I will make this again.

This recipe was so easy.  I just dumped everything together and stired it every hour.  The entire family loved this, and my mother in law wanted a copy of the recipe.

This recipe was INCREDIBLE! This is the closest recipe I can find to Rudy's Cream Corn in Texas. I made it as a side dish to a BBQ brisket dinner with my family. The recipe was extremely easy to make. I followed some previous reviews and melted the cream cheese/butter before added to the crock-pot with the rest of the ingredients. I did measure out 1 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. pepper. I increased the corn to 1 1/2 16-oz. bags of frozen corn kernels. I cooked it on high for about 2 hours or so, and it turned out perfectly. I used reduced fat Philadelphia cream cheese, light butter, and a sugar/Splenda blend; no one could tell a difference! I will definitely be adding this recipe to my list of favorites.

I have made this dish for many different pot-lucks and people always ask for the recipe. This is so easy to prepare the night before and take with you. It is creamy and tastes wonderful. I highly recommend this to anyone that is short on time. It is also very inexpensive to make.

this is close but not the same as RUDY´s BBQ as some have claimed... they DO NOT USE CREAM CHEESE....  you cook the corn in 1 C of heavy cream and 1 cup of milk, sugar, and white pepper. cook for 1 hour then just before done add the roux which is 1/3 cup melted butter and 1/3 of flour and add, and a dash of paprika..

I must say that I can't help but to alter a recipe no matter how good it is. I used two 16.oz bags of corn, low fat cream cheese, 1 stick of butter and 1/2 cup of 2%milk and 1/2 table spoon of sugar, 1/2of garlic powder, salt, black pepper, pinch of cayanne pepper and I did all on stove top was in crunch for dinner no time for slow cooking.I melt cream cheese and butter first until smooth before adding corn.Took about 20-25 minutes in total and family loved it already ask when is the next time I will be cooking corn that way.I make some many different corn recipe this one is a keeper. thanks

EXCELLENT!!! I am not a fan of creamed corn but my husband and children love it. I made this for them, but I became a believer. Easy recipe and delicious results.

Yummy, I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was very well recived. I doubled the recipe and the one mistake I made was not cutting up the butter and cream cheese before adding it into the crock pot. I read alot of reviews that said there was to much sauce, but I followed the recipe with only 8 extra oz of corn (40 oz bag, double recipe, why not) it was just like Rudy's and 24 people at my dinner table gobbled it up! Awesome!

Good cold weather comfort food.  I used one 16 oz package of corn, 3 oz cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup milk, cooked on high for 3 1/2 hours and the consistency was just right.  Will probably add another 1/2 T sugar next time.

No one in N. MN knows about Rudy's, but they LOVE this corn!  Be sure to melt butter & cheese together.  Add milk, sugar, S & P.  I Used Splenda.  Prepare it the day before & then cook the next day.  Great party dish.  UPDATE!!  We were able to try the creamed corn at RUDY'S in SA, Texas.  This recipe is as close as it gets!!!

Just made this for a Crock Pot potluck. Everyone loved it! When we got home my 2 year old gobbled up two bowls of it, so a hit with her too. I used almost an entire 32 oz package of corn and probably could have used the whole thing. Melted all ingredients in a saucepan on the stove before combining it.

I used two packages of frozen corn - one white and one yellow, halved the amount of butter and used low fat cream cheese. I also chose to omit the sugar and didn't miss it at all. I served this with ham and a potato casserole for Christmas dinner and it was a hit! A few guests even asked for the recipe. This one is a keeper!

This was a hit at our Thanksgiving dinner. I followed other suggestions to pre-melt the cream cheese and butter in a separate pan first. I added the sugar, salt and pepper to the saucepan and a pinch of garlic powder, too. I then used my immersion blender to make it smooth and then poured it over the frozen corn in the crockpot.

A family favorite, I had lost this recipe and I am so glad to find it again!!! What an easy and delicious side dish. I have made this many times for potlucks at church and there are NEVER any leftovers. There is always someone who thinks it is 'fresh from the garden' creamed corn. They can't believe it when I tell them its frozen corn. Since I generally like to cook large portions for church dinners and parties I have had no problem doubling and even tripling the recipe. I know you'll love it, too!!!

This was truly the very best Cream Corn recipe I have ever had, and I've had and made quite a few living in the south!! ;o)

I doubled this recipe because we were having company and the only things I changed for a double recipe was:
Using 12oz of Cream Cheese & Fat free evaporated milk. I also added 4 strips of bacon crumbled up ... it was delicious!!!!

I would recommend heating up all your ingredients minus your corn in a sauce pot and pouring over your corn in the crocker. It does make the process less lumpy.
Since everything was heated thoroughly, I only cooked mine for two hours; 1 hr on high, 1 hr on low. It was perfect!


This recipe is a keeper!!! Thank you Dotte!!!

This wasn't bad and I may try it again. However, I would probably add some additional flavorings/herbs or vegetables, such as spinach. It was, at least for us, too rich and more like a dessert.

I had high hopes for this one, but it just didn't do anything special for my family. It takes like corn with cream cheese...that's pretty much it. I'd rather have the frozen creamed corn. Sorry!

Absolutely wonderful!!  I used the combo package of white/yellow frozen corn.  Only use 4 oz. of cream cheese and do not add the sugar.  Thanks Dotte for submitting such a tasty way of fixing corn that brings compliments every time AND is sooo easy to prepare.

We use corn that we freeze in the summer and this recipe tastes like corn on the cob-it is insanely fantastic.  I don't like creamed corn-or so I thought-this is to die for!  I at least double the recipe when making it as it tastes great after being refrigerated as well.  When using our corn that we freeze we do nto add the sugar-midwest corn is sweet enough-thanks for a fantastic recipe.

This creamed corn is simply delicious!  It's totally decadent with that much cream cheese and butter, but worth the splurge every now and then.  The only comment I have is that 20 oz of corn does not yield 12 servings even with the additional ingredients.  To feed that many, you'd really need to double this recipe, so plan accordingly.

I made this for our familys Thanksgiving dinner.  If you do not stir it frequently (repeat; FREQUENTLY) it will scorch!  I cooked it on low for 5 hours and the texture of the corn was like rubber so if you make this I suggest you use fresh corn.  And you should add more liquid (i used milk) because it won't come out too creamy.  I'm giving it 3 stars because other people at the dinner "said" they liked it.  However I did not care for it.

I have made this for Thanksgiving and got requests for it at Easter! Next time I will try a full kg package of corn (peaches and cream is best) and my husband suggested that before serving I bake with a bread crumb crust and I think that might be the only way to possibly improve this amazing recipe! (I skip the sugar)

I wasn't overly impressed but I'm giving this a solid 4 stars because both my husband and daughter RAVED on how good this was! I made this dish as is with no changes or substitutions. Personally I thought the sauce was greasy and thin, but maybe because I am still looking for the way my mother-in-law used to make it!

This is the most delicious creamed corn I've ever had. It was the only dish that had no leftovers on Thanksgiving. Next time I'll triple it!

I love this recipe, we have made it for years, I now take all the ingredients except for the corn, toss in a bowl, and I add a couple of slices of American cheese, and microwave it until I can cream it all together, then I stir in the corn, and dump in the crockpot on low until time to call in the family.  Everyone has loved it!
Even if you are not a traditional creamed corn eater, you ought to try this!

I brought this to a potluck and it didn't go over well.  The taste was sweet but I think I, and others, would have rather just eat plain old corn.  It didn't taste horrible, just wasn't anything special.  I have eaten creamed corn at a potluck before but it was more thick and creamy and had a bit of a kick from green chiles or jalapenos.  I much preferred the spiced up version.

i made this for my husbands work party and he thought no one would eat it.  I promised him people in Texas love cream corn, and to trust me.  He came home and said it was gone so fast he didnt even get to try it, but everyone raved, and one guy asked him for the recipe so he could have his wife make it. I guess it must have been pretty good.

This did not turn out like I thought it would.  It was more like cream with corn, not creamed corn.  I ended up throwing a bunch out because no one wanted any after the first few bites.  I won't be making it again.

Wow, thanks to Allrecipes I'm starting to look like a celebrity chef...this recipe was way to easy and absolutely SUPERB!  I'm 24 years old and try to help out around the house in whatever way I can so during the summer I have supper on the table when the family arrives home.  My family is full of discerning eaters and they are difficult to please.  This recipe paired with Chicken Cordon Bleu I, Day Before Mashed Potatos and Basic Crepes from this site made for a wonderful Bastille Day meal.  Out of the mentioned recipes, the corn was the one everyone raved about.  I used everyones advice and used two packs of corn and the consistency and amount was perfect for a family of five.  Believe, me...this is a great recipe.  Give it a try.  By the way, the cream cheese scared me when I checked it after about three hours...it was still clumpy and not melted like I had anticipated.  I'd suggest stirring this at least once every hour.  Enjoy.

I have made this several times and it is absolutely my favorite way to eat corn.  It turns out perfect every time.  I use heavy cream instead of milk because the first time I made it I was out of milk and then after that, I didn't want to do anything differently because it was so good!  I use 3/4 tsp. sea salt and 1/4 tsp. pepper.  It also heats up very well...that is, if there are leftovers!

Fansatic!  I used corn that I had frozen off the cob from the summer.  Maybe that is why it was so delicious.  Very simple and a quick recipe to share at potlucks.  Everyone who had some loved it.

This is a wonderful yummy dish. Have to admit you probably can't count it as a veggie, but it's deliciious. I used 32 ounces of corn and I was very glad I did. Served it on Christmas day - everyone loved it.

This is an awesome side dish. While the oven is busy cooking a roast, the slow cooker can be making this corn. We loved it. I made a double batch, and it fed 6 people perfectly. The only thing I will change for future batches is to halve the butter. For us, half a cup butter was even too much for the double batch. Otherwise, delish!

My boyfriend and I both hate cream corn, but this was great.  Super easy to make and very tasty.  The whole house smelled like a corn souffle.
Originally, I was looking for something I could use for a Corn Nugget/fritter recipe I have, but we ended up having half as a side dish for dinner (that's how much we liked it).  Canned Cream Corn should be ashamed of itself.   
Tonight I try my corn fritters :)

I made this years ago from a recipe I got from Southern Living, but you cooked it on top of the stove. But I have to tell you how easy this is, and your not standing over a stove. I made it this week-end, and while I was busy with the BBQ brisket and salads this was a hands free dish. It comes out just as good, and I have to agree with another reviewer, it does taste just as good as Rudy's BBQ!

This recipe is the best!  I made it for a few of my guy friends and they were putting it on burgers.  One said "I will never eat a burger without cream corn again!"  I was even giving out the recipe to a few of them!  Didn't change a thing.  It was perfect!

I used 2 full 16 oz. bags of corn, low-fat cream cheese, skim milk and splenda.  Then added the called for 1/2 C of butter...go figure...think I cancelled out trying to make this healthier but it was heaven for sure.  Awesome taste even with the changes and I do think next time I will even try using less butter or using smart balance.  I am not a big fan of creamed corn but everyone loved this and wanted more.  I highly recommend this recipe.  Just a note - I do think this would be way way too saucy without the 2 full bags of corn.

Wonderful! My grandmother grows her own corn and makes Cream Corn from scratch. People that hate Cream Corn love hers..., this recipe almost had her beat.
I did use two packages of corn and added two pieces of already cooked bacon at the beginning. I also heated the cream cheese and butter in a pan before adding to the Crock Pot. The taste was exceptional but the texture was all wrong. I waited for it to cool and then added it to a food processor and pulsed it until it was the right consistency. I served it at my mother's birthday where we all agreed that no one tell my grandmother.

My husband and I love this and I wish I could make "just a little" for the two of us. I pared down the recipe to one bag of frozen corn but with the other ingredients added it still makes quite a bit. We'll have this for company and holidays and just think about it the rest of the time! It's excellent and a perfect recipe in our opinion!

Make this recipe on demand! It is just as easy to melt stick of butter in pot, cook frozen WK corn in butter till most water is gone, add cream cheese to melt. Pepper well. EASY!! GRANDKIDS that don't eat veggies LOVE this!
No need to salt!

The best I've ever tasted!!!
Endless thank you for the this recipe! I made it last night for Christmas dinner and I can only wish all the  "best ever" dish recipes came out tasting half as good as this one! My husband, THE most pickiest of eaters, is the best judge of food tasting for me - and he was "blown away" :)) Thank you again!!!

Yes!!! I Finally found it. My cousin makes this recipe every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas and I have been trying to find the recipe. I already got it from her once, but lost it. The only difference to her recipe is she adds a 4 oz. can of diced green chilies. In my family we call this dish " Darn Good Corn". If you need an idea for a potluck dish in the Winter/Fall this is an easy crowd pleaser.

I absolutely love this as does everyone I've ever made it for - everything from holidays & birthday parties to Meatloaf Madness Monday - it's awesome. I use about 1 tsp of salt & a heaping 1/4 tsp of black pepper - tried more and less of both, this combo works best for our taste. One quick note, if you decide you must have this as a side dish but did not plan ahead as happens to me a lot, you can put this in a 2 qt oven safe casserole dish & cook covered at 350 for 45 minutes then uncovered for another 15 to let it thicken up just a bit. Also works well with 1 12 oz bag of frozen mixed veggies mixed with 1 12 oz bag of frozen corn so ALL of the veggies get eaten at dinner time!

I was so looking forward to trying this..I absolutely LOVE Rudy's creamed corn.  This was good, not great.  And unfortunately no where close to as good as Rudy's.  I don't think I'll make again just because it's so unhealthy.

Absolutely delicious! Made for Christmas dinner because we were going to be short on oven and stovetop space. Followed the recipe ingredients exactly, but I followed the advice of others and cooked the ingredients together on the stove, prior to adding them to the crockpot.  Took a while longer than the recipe stated so I had to move it all back to the stove 2 hours in and heated in thoroughly for about 20 minutes before serving.  The flavor was amazing and everyone LOVED it!  It was super easy but I looked like a kitchen hero.  Gotta love that!  Will make again... and again! :)

I am sorry. It looked really good. When it was cooked it was just bland and processed tasting. I think I want to like slow cooker food and I just can't. I guess I need to leave the crock pot alone.

I made this as written, except that I used two 16 oz. bags of frozen corn. Served as a side dish at Christmas and everyone liked it. The bowl was emptied, not a bite left over! Easy to make and very good. Wil try fat free cream cheese next time.

I have a small crock pot for dips.  I made a single serving size for my daughter using (1) Philly Cream cheese single serving pack, (1) Birds-eye single serving frozen corn pack, 2T butter, 2T milk, 1/2 tsp sugar and salt and pepper to taste.  It cooked for about 2.5 hours.  My daughter LOVED it!

Really good! I used 4 ears of corn instead of frozen and used light cream cheese. It didn't take the full 2 hours. It was done within an hour and half. I added some salt and it was delicious!

I followed the advice of another user and melted everything in a pot over the stove and then poured it over te corn. I added an addtional 1/2 bag of frozen corn adn added 1/2 teaspoon of pepper and 1/2 tablespoon of chicken boullian granules in lieu of salt. I also upped the sugar amount to about 1 tablespoons. Very good and rich.

Great creamed corn recipe!  Very easy to make and the fact that it's made in the slow cooker is even better.  I set mine for 8 hours so that the heat wouldn't be too intense.  I think that there was just a bit too much butter.  Next time I'll use less.  Maybe I'll try decreasing the cream cheese a little too.

My husband loves creamed corn.  I hate it.  In the last 20+ years he's had it 3 times.  Tonight was the third.  And now I really really like it.  Never again will I open a can of creamed corn.  Didn't alter this recipe at all.  Thanks for the post!

This is a family favorite.  I often add a couple slices of cheddar cheese cut up to add a little more to this.  We love this recipe.

Talk about fat and calories! I'm no health nut, but this was so oily, I only took three bites and threw it out! I figured out something was wrong about an hour into cooking and added an extra cup of corn.  It didn't matter.  The butter and cream cheese overwhelmed the whole dish.  Don't waste your time and money, not to mention your cholesterol count!

Very good recipe.  Followed the suggestions of other reviewers and doubled the corn.  Second time I made it I more than doubled the corn  and it was a hit.  I used Splenda instead of sugar and used the "super sweet" frozen corn.

Great flavor.  I took the advice of a previous reviewer and doubled the corn in the recipie.  I also used fat free cream cheese and it came out great.  Definitely a keeper.

I made this recently for a pot-luck.  Man this is tasty and all my friends thought so too!  Before you knew it... the slow cooker was empty!  Every one loved it and it is so simple to make.

This is one of my favorite recipes! Super easy and tasty.  I only changed one thing. Instead of frozen corn I used can corn drained. I ended up using four cans. There was a lot left over, but it heated up perfectly for leftovers for the week. My husband loved it, it's my to go to side.  Though I will never tell him how easy it was.

Wow, did we love this corn recipe.  I did make one change to the recipe – I doubled the corn to 32 ounces, but kept everything else the same.  For my family, this produced the right amount of creaminess.  The corn was in the crockpot on low for 6 hours.  The leftovers of this dish were just as good as the first time around.  I served this with Shredded French Dip and ‘Cheesy Ranch Potato Bake’ from AR and we enjoyed a wonderful dinner.

I have made this recipe for several large family gatherings and it has been a huge hit. This coming from a family who have several family recipes for baked corn, creamed corn and corn pie. I double the recipe and never have any left over.

This recipe was so tasty and easy!  I added extra corn (2 16oz packages) while keeping the other ingredients as stated and it was perfect. I made it in the morning for a potluck at noon & it was gone in no time! Thanks for sharing this easy to make recipe.

I have made this recipe many times with one exception:  I add slivers of canned jalapenos to the recipe.  It adds a kick and enhances the taste.   - Terri

My husband and I really did not care for this, which was a bit of a surprise.  I thought he would love it- corn, cream cheese, and lots of butter!  But it was a total flop, neither of us could finish our tiny servings, and I actually ended up dumping the leftovers straight into the trash can.  We didn't hate it and it certainly wasn't terrible, it was just very unappealing.  The tangy flavor of the cream cheese combined with the corn was not very good.  I added more sugar and that actually helped, but not enough to make us like it.  It was also just so creamy and rich and the sauce so thick.  We don't shy away from trying rich foods usually, but this one just turned us off.  Sorry!  Next time I will try creamed corn with corn, a bit of cream, a bit of butter, salt, a bit of sugar, and a quick hit with my immersion blender just to chop up some of the kernels.  Oh and if you DO want to make this recipe, know that you basically just need to cook it long enough to heat the ingredients through and then stir everything together.  The corn starts getting chewy if it cooks past that stage.

Absolutely outstanding! Although, I used a 32oz bag of frozen corn and let everything else the same.  It was too soupy without adding the extra corn.  The flavor is amazing and it was a huge hit at our Easter dinner.

This was absolutely delicious but slightly too rich for me & my boyfriend's taste. Next time, I would cut the butter in half--the recipes calls for 1/2 cup (1 stick), which makes it super greasy along with the cream cheese. Otherwise, this was really wonderful!

I made this for a group of hunters and one of them being very picky.  They ate it all up!!  I did what another review suggested, I cooked the butter, cream cheese, milk, 1 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp salt together and mixed it with 1-1/2 pkgs of frozen corn.  Put it in the crockpot and let it cook!  Awesome recipe!!!

This is an EXCELLENT creamed corn; I took another reviewer's advice and heated the cheese and butter on the stove-top before adding to the corn/sugar/salt in the crockpot; I believe it does help with the consistency so you won't have any clumps of cream cheese. I would recommend 24 ounces of corn, as opposed to the 16 called for in the recipe; I felt there was just a bit too much "sauce" for the amount of corn. Can also add one bag of corn which has been run through a food processor; this will thicken the product.

I followed the recipe exactly, and found it to be too balnd and runny for my taste. I ended up using 2 full bags of corn and added 1/2 tsp of onion powder. I live alone and this makes a huge batch, so i have plenty leftover to play with the seasoning. I'll let you know what I've don and how I think it turned out

This was a good way for me to use left-over frozen corn from our daughter's reception. I served it with mashed potatoes & Chicken in Cream Sauce.  Husband LOVED it.  For me, it was just ok.  With what's left, I plan on making corn chowder:)

Oh my, this was incredible. Made as is except used more corn (a 750 g bag).  Didn't taste like cream cheese at all.  But certainly very high on the decadent scale.  I will find an excuse to make this again!

This was great!  Followed recipe as written for the most part, except I doubled it to take to a potluck.  I did half milk, half heavy cream...will probably just do as written next time.  :)  Great taste, great, easy recipe.

This was so easy and good. Make sure to double the corn amount. I added some fresh cracked pepper and chili powder. This was very good alongside sloppy joes. I think I will add a little salsa next time if I have any to use up. I will definitely make this again. update: Made a 2nd time and it seemed too runny. I will thaw the corn and drain well before adding to the slow cooker next time

Very good--creamy and sweet!  Not health food but easy and good.  My children loved it (and they can afford the extra calories)!

Super easy and OH MY GOSH so good! This is something you make and then smack yourself in the head for not thinking of it yourself. Some of the simplest ingredients that compliment each other very well.

Made without adding the milk and it was nice and creamy.  Would probably be good with some added spice.

I am so excited with this recipe Ever since I visited Rudy's in San Antonio and had their creamed corn, I've been experimenting and searching for recipe to make at home. I finally found it.  YEAH!!! I just 'tweeked' it a little by using half & half in place of the milk MMMMM   so tasty and creamy.  Can't wait to make it again.

The Cream flavor of this is delicious, however... we found the ratio of cream to corn way to heavy. Our family for Christmas is very large, so we were doubling the recipe. Luckily, I had plenty of bags of frozen corn in the freezer. To get the correct cream/corn ratio it took THREE packages of corn to the listed other ingredients...THEN, it was perfect!

This was SUCH A HIT.  I made it 3 times during the Thanksgiving Holidays.  I made it once on top of the stove, once in the slowcooker, and even on a holiday camping trip in a CAST IRON DUTCH OVEN.   It was great all 3 ways.  My families only suggestion... leave out the sugar.  It was to sweet for our tastebuds with the sugar in it.   I added more corn to each batch.   ALSO, one batch I added about 5/6 sliced of American Cheese.  That batch was the most raved about.  Thanks for a wonderful change of pace recipe.  Please know that it was a great hit... and I gave your recipe out numerous times.  Thanks again.  L.

I hate creamed corn! BUT this recipe is delicious!! I accidentally set it on high to begin with. When I came back in an hour to stir it, I reduced it to low. Still cooked for the entire 4 hours. Think next time I'll cook it less! It was just a bit too thick. Also, I think this recipe would be really good with either some peppers or crumbled bacon.

Hmmm....this sounded great. However, I followed the recipe exactly but none of the four of us really liked it.  It just seemed to add calories and fat grams without adding anything in the flavor department. And the slow-cooked corn was gummy and chewy.    Maybe I'm just a corn purist!

Not as good as I hoped for.  Not much different than if you were to use creme cheese instead of butter on corn on the cob.  Take a knife and slather it on, it would taste the same sadly.  Corn never did much up at all like cream corn should do. Not a slow cooker recipe I will ever use again.

I've never had homemade creamed corn, but my husband was asking me to make some.  This recipe is AMAZING good and very easy!  He liked it more than his grandmother's farm recipe.  It's meant as a side dish but we liked it so much we ate a bowl as a meal!  I've shared the recipe with all my friends and family and will definitely include it for holiday meals and large gatherings.

Like others, I adjust the corn quantity depending on my mood. I like baby sweet corn - smaller kernels and use more of them... also zap in the microwave first.  Sounds weird, but first time I made this because it has a very liquid consistency I poured it over some leftover fettucini and added some other small veggies... made a great cream sauce.. Always a winner... last week took it to a dinner... thought it was a little 'low brow" for the crowd...didn't care... everyone loved it best.. happy face plates all around

I could make this a 5 star with my changes. (for my family anyway)  I followed this recipe to a T.  (except makeing it serving for 5.  Next time I will use 1/3 of the amount of cream cheese, more milk and less butter.  I also pepper it.  I think I will leave out the cheese too.  Other than that I so see where it could go.  But it was also nice this way.  Thanks!  I will be making this for thanksgiving.

Very Yummy, everyone loved it,even my kids that hate creamed corn. I ended up adding a can of corn about an hour before we ate because there was a lot of sauce. I also stirred it a few times during cooking as suggested in the reviews.  A new family favorite.

This had such a great flavor, and so simple to make.  The corn was a bit chewy.  I will try using fresh corn next time.

Really good comfort food.  My mother used to serve canned creamed corn.  Never did like creamed corn served out of a can so never ate it no matter where it came from.  But knowing the difference between fresh cooked and canned, I decided to try it.  I did use sweetened condensed milk and a little bit of brown sugar instead of white sugar.  I think the cream cheese was a bit overboard for me.  next time, I'll use half as much.  But overall, I thought this was great.

This was really good. Like another person said it was really close to Rudy's. I added a little bit more sugar and 1/2 cup of milk so it wasn't so thick. That made it even closer to Rudy's.

This was a huge hit at my office pot-luck.  I did make some minor modifications:  I added a can of diced green chilies.  I also used 2 bags corn - one of which I chopped in the food processor to provide a bit more texture.  Like other reviewers, I blended cream cheese and milk over the stove before adding to the crock pot with the corn. Delicious!

Made this for Thankgiving and my husband and I really liked this as well as our guests but my two daughters didn't.  I did do what another reviewer had suggested and melted the milk, butter and cream cheese together and than pour over my corn (I used 1 1/2 packages).  Than I added 1 cup of mild shredded cheddar cheese which made it REALLY thick, so I just added more milk until I liked the way it looked.  One guest suggested it might be good with garlic added to it.  I'm going to try this at Christmas with shredded Velveeta cheese to see which flavor of cheese we like better.  Thanks for an easy recipe!!

***Update***  Made this again using frozen corn and it was terrific!  I will recommend doubling the amount of corn, or it will be swimming in sauce!

My aunt makes this everything Thanksgiving, and I tried it out this year.  I could not get it to thicken.  I even added a can of corn to try to thicken it up.  Didn't work.  We served with a strainer and it was tasty, but not the way I'm used to it.

This was good, although I thought the cream cheese overpowered most of the other flavors.  It was a little too liquidy.  But everyone did enjoy it and it was very rich.

This dish had two things I really like, corn and cream cheese. But for some reason I didn't find it to be as flavorable as I would have liked.

I agree that this was just okay.  It was missing something. I was SOOOOO excited to try this recipe (i am a cream cheese nut- it goes in everything i make practically).  It needs maybe a little bite to it, i was wondering if a handful of sharp cheddar might add to it. I am not wanting it spicy or anything.  OH

This was terribly disappointing.  The cream cheese looked like it was curdled or something, and the sauce wasn't smooth and creamy.  The taste was bland and not particularly interesting.  I made it for Thanksgiving, and I'm glad we didn't have guests.

I was disappointed with this recipe after seeing so many good reviews.  I thought it was a little too sweet.  I could tell it was corn in cream cheese and didn't think it tasted like any kind of creamed or cheesy corn.  I doubt I'll make this again.

This is a great simple side dish.  I don't have a crock pot, so i cooked it on med heat over the stove for about 10 mins.  It still turned out good, and was so easy to make!  Like everyone else, i used about double the corn and i only had whipped cream cheese.  Def. not a regual b/c very rich, but very good every once in while...will definatly put in my real recipie box :)

I made this for my Thanksgiving dinner and it turned out very well--in fact it smelled great while it was cooking!  But I'm glad I read the other reviews and doubled the corn.  I also used 1/3 reduced fat cream cheese and it still worked very well.  Thank you!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and my family loved it! I made it again on Christmas, but this time I put 2 pkg. of corn kernels instead of 1 1/4. I felt it was a little too thick the first time. However, with the cream cheese and butter, it's definitely a special occasion only dish!

I'm a strict vegetarian, and was pleasantly surprised with the results of this recipe using soy milk, margarine and tofu "cream cheese."  However, I think that one could cut back on the various fats a little bit... there's a little too much cream for the amount of corn involved.

This was the best creamed corn I have ever had.  I liked the idea that it "slow" cooks.  I doubled the portions to feed a large group and at the end there was one kernel left in the pot!

This is absolutely delicious.  Like the others, I used a bit more corn than called for.  I cut the corn off the cob of 6 large fresh ears, which ended up to be around 4 cups--maybe a little more.  I also used the low fat cream cheese because that is what I had on hand.  Since I used more corn, I doubled the milk to 1 cup instead of 1/2 cup.  Absolutely mouthwatering and this feeds a crowd.  What you don't eat can be frozen for later use, either in individual containers or in larger ones for family meals.  I also used a slow cooker plastic liner (found by the turkey oven bags you use at Thanksgiving) so there was virtually no cleanup other than putting the slow-cooker lid in the dishwasher.  Will definitely be making again!

This was enjoyed at Thanksgiving Dinner. The sauce stays creamy, unlike the recipes made with flour which tend to clump up.  I used the amount of corn listed in the recipe, but HALVED all other ingredients. It was plenty of sauce for us. I followed the recipe other than reducing sauce ingredients and it was a lovely dish.

This is my signature dish for any family or office gathering people request it all the time.  People that have never liked cream corn love this recipe.  When I make large batches I do not use as much cream cheese butter and milk I think that it  become too much like a cream sauce.  Everyone likes it just the same.  I usually make 2 80 oz bags of corn with 8 oz bars of cream cheese and 4-5 sticks of butter with milk added as needed.  If I'm in a hurry I use the microwave then put it in the slowcooker.  Everyone always loves it, even when I get carried away with the salt.

This isn't the first time I've made this recipe, but I still got the same rave reviews from the people who ate it!  Took it to Thanksgiving yesterday, made a "9 batch" for the whole crew, and it was nearly gone.  The only thing I changed this time was that I used half and half instead of milk.  Did I notice a difference?  Couldn't say for sure.  It's delish as written, delish with half and half.  This will be my "go to" for Thanksgiving from now on!! 

UPDATE 12/18/2016:  Made this again and need to clarify.  Today was an "8 batch".  Having said that, I cooked 5 sticks of butter and 5 blocks of cream cheese together, blended it some, and then added 5 half cups of half and half.  The mixture was cooked and completely smooth.  I had five bags of Birdseye baby gold and white corn in the crockpot waiting (14.4 oz bags).  I poured on the heated sauce and let this cook in the crockpot on high for an hour.  I then turned it to low, but found it was too soupy by then.  Added three more bags of corn and 3 more Tbsp. of sugar, got it fully heated again, then turned it down to low and let it go for a bit.  I had to add the extra corn to get the consistency right.  This 8 batch fits with about 1/4 inch from the rim into my 7 quart crockpot.  Hope this helps!

I made this for a thanksgiving potluck at work, and it was such a hit! I did listen to other reviewers and added more corn. I used a 32 ounce bag of frozen corn. It was so good that I am going to make it for my family's thanksgiving!

Love this recipe! Super easy, and everyone loves it! Requested everytime we have a potluck at work! 

I leave out  the sugar... It truly doesn't need it, and I made it with chive flavored cream cheese.  I never have any left!

I did put half of the corn in a blender with the milk but, stuck to the recipe otherwise.  I'll probably cook this often.

Was a great side dish!!! However, I used frozen Southwest corn and half onion, chopped. Gave the corn that little extra flavor!!!

I love this corn, and so did my family for Christmas dinner.  Not a single serving left and I doubled the recipe!  Going to make more and freeze in servings for easy weeknight dinners.

WONDERFUL as is!!!!!!  A variation I like is to add a few green chile peppers cut in small pieces for a little kick for our adult dinner party.

My husband and son love this.  I've made it at least 3 times now, and it separates every time. That doesn't affect the flavor, it just annoys me.

I made this today for a reunion. Everybody loved it and wanted the recipe. The only small change I made was to use 2-16 oz bags of the frozen corn. Will make corn this way from now on. Thank you for a great recipe. :)

Family said, "Best Cream-of-Corn I've ever tasted!" and "I've never tasted anything like this in my life". I'd never had Creamed Corn before, but when I made this for Thanksgiving, it blew my mind. Amamzing! Would have made so much more if I knew before hand how good it was. :)

This is fantastic. I just served it as a side for Thanksgiving and everyone raved about it and asked to take the leftover corn home. I cooked it for about 5 hours, with occasional stirring.

Recipe good, found a little bland.  I modified to omit milk, butter & sugar and modified to only corn, 1-8oz creme cheese & 1-2 cans Rotel with Cilantro & Lime only depending on degree of "zip" you like & were very pleased.

yummy recipe for creamed corn, to give it a bit of a bite, I added paprika and it spiced things right up and went nicely with the BBQ ribs we made.

This was easy and delicious! I softened the butter and cream cheese in the microwave before adding them to the corn in the crockpot. I added an extra cup of corn halfway through cooking because it looked like too much sauce. It was still very saucy, but oh so yummy!

I tried this recipe yesterday. I am more of an "eyeballer" than a recipe follower, so I am sure it came out different, but it was delicious. I added more corn than called for and also chopped green onions and cooked bacon (leftover from breakfast) when it was finished cooking. I made this for a potluck we went to at a campground. It was so cool to take just a few minutes, literally, and throw this together and then not have to worry about it. I got to spend my afternoon with my kids at the pool instead of making a dish for dinner. I will definitely make this again. (I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I didn't exactly follow the recipe.)

Very good...I made this for a Thanksgiving get together.  I used 32 oz of corn and kept all other ingredients the same.  I can't imagine using less corn, there would be too much sauce.  Doubling the corn was perfect.

I had high hopes for this as it sounded so good.  We were disappointed with it.  The cream cheese didn't add much flavor but did add lots of calories.  I will not make this again.

I wasnt too fond of the texture and taste of this creamed corn. I was expecting it to be totally different than it was. However, I will prob make this recipe again....with some minor adjustments to more of my liking.

I tripled this recipe for our Easter dinner side dish. Everyone loved it. Super easy. The only changes I made were to melt the butter, cream cheese, and milk together in a sauce pan. Once melted I added the sugar, salt, & pepper. Then I poured the sauce over the frozen corn in the crock pot, stirred and left it. When time to serve I think I added about another 1/2 cup of milk because it seemed just a tad thick.

I made this for an office potluck meal and everyone really liked it. I used two 32-oz. bags of frozen corn which is 4 times the recipe amount. However, I only tripled the other ingredients -- 3 sticks of butter, 3 blocks of low-fat cream cheese and 1 1/2  cups of milk etc. It came out very saucy and probably would have worked with only doubling the other ingredients. This isn't like traditional cream corn like we make in the south since it uses whole kernel corn. If I make it again I think I'll try grating some of the corn in my food processor to add corn flavor & texture to the sauce.

Pretty good and takes a fraction of the time it takes to do it the old fashioned way. I would suggest letting the corn thaw and pulsing it a second in a processor first. It releases the "milk" inside the corn and makes it closer to the real thing. I also mixed a little flour in a bit of the hot liquid to thicken it up a bit.

This was delicious.  I used 1 1/2 bags of corn, I melted the butter in the mike, then added the cream cheese for about 30 seconds to soften, mixed and added the milk and seasonings.  I poured over corn in crock pot (sprayed w/Pam) and mixed it up well.  I stirred a few times while cooking.  Definitely a keeper, will make again!!!

I was nervous about this one when I first started making it cause it looked a little runny. It was actually an amazing alternative to just the regular canned cream corn. I got lots of compliments on it and I'm sure I'll make it many times.

Very good for creamed corn. I HATE the canned stuff! It was better than what I was expecting, but I may try another recipe to see if I can still find something better.

Oh. My. Gosh. This was SOOOOO good!!! Other than my picky hubby (he doesn't like cream ANYTHING), everyone at my dinner table REALLY enjoyed this. I decided to use my slow cooker to prepare one of my Easter side dishes in order to lessen my workload and free up some space in my oven for my ham / potatoes. Prep was a BREEZE!!! I literally dumped everything in my sc, set it and went about my day (it was THAT easy!). Because of my dad's dietary needs, I used reduced-fat cream cheese and fat-free milk. I also added a pinch more sugar (personal preference).... All I can say is WOW! This will be added to my "keeper" file for sure. Thanks for sharing, Dotte! :-)

I made this as part of our Easter dinner and everyone LOVED IT. I'm not a big fan of full, rich sauces on my veggies but this is an exception!
I used fresh corn and full far versions of the dairy products. Next time I'll try with low fat dairy products and swap Splenda for the sugar. Hope it's equally as wonderful. 
Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe,,

Very good.  Made this for a holiday luncheon and it went fast.  Added a 16 oz more frozen corn and turned out great.  Will make again and again.

I made the Slow Cooker Creamed corn for Thanksgiving and was very disappointed.  Only a few of my guests liked it. I had a lot left over and I poured it into a colander and rinsed it off really good and just added butter and salt to it.   Much better!!

I am a new fan of cream cheese because of this recipe. This smelled SO good while it was cooking every time I lifted the lid to stir. I used fresh corn that was boiled and shaved off the cob. I only wish I always has fresh corn to use!

Made this for Memorial Day and it was a hit. I doubled the recipe and it still was not enough. It ran out before the meat did. Some were even serving it in a cup. Will make this again. Better than Rudy's and cheaper too.

Way to easy - loved it!!!  Made for 4th of July BBQ and I only got one small spoonful as it was all gone by the time I got it in line, will definetly have to make again because of how easy it was.  The only thing I did different was I used two whole bags of frozen corn and there was still plent of sauce left over.  I think next time when I make more for another larger BBQ I will make 1.5 times the sauce and use 4 bags of corn, we will see.

I know, I'm really REALLY bad - but I replaced half of the butter in this recipe with bacon fat. I also added a couple of minced shallots and stirred in bacon crumbles right before serving. It was amazing...

I was not impressed.  It was corn, sweetened and with some sauce, but the consensus (of the 20+ people at my Thanksgiving dinner) was... it was corn.  It was eaten, but plain corn would have been eaten too.

great slow cooker recipe!! I initially found it too rich but have since started doubling the corn amount and leaving everything else as is. This seems to have helped and now it is always a hit. This has become a holiday staple for our family and everyone always look forward to my corn. Everyone usually say it reminds them of their grandmother's corn or something along those lines. I always get recipe requests for this corn recipe. Thanks!

My family absolutely loved this!  I used 2 32oz packages of frozen corn, and doubled everything else.  It seems a little thin after 4 hours of cooking, so I left the lid off the crockpot for the last hour and it thickened up nicely!  I think the only thing I would change/add is to defrost the corn before using.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I wanted to save time and use less dishes, so I put all the ingredients into the crock pot instead of heating them separately on the stove.  I cooked the corn on high for about 2 hrs before checking.  At first I was worried, because the cream cheese was still in chunks.  I gave it a good stir and let it cook for another 15 min, and the cheese blended in perfectly.  I added 1 tsp salt & 1/2 tsp pepper & used a 1/3 less fat cream cheese. I LOVED the taste, but my 4 kids did not!  It is very rich with all the butter & cream cheese.  UPDATE: I made this again on the stove top and used 1/2 less cream cheese and added about 1/4 cup whipping cream - didn't measure just eye-balled amounts.  Result was very smooth & creamy corn with less of a cream cheese flavor.  My kids liked it better this time.

This was okay, but did not knock anyone's socks off.  I had really high hopes after reading the reviews and was a little disappointed.  I should have added a little more sugar, I think it would be better if it was a little sweeter.  I like how easy it is!

Very easy to make.  Tastes just like Rudy's cream corn.  Probably very fattening so next time I may use light cream cheese.  Made it for a baby shower and got great compliments and lots of "oohs" and "ahhs".  I used a little bit more corn than the recipe called for.

If I die and go to heaven... this is what they will serve. I put some chopped jalapenos in it because I couldn't resist. It was devine....not pretty - it tends to separate but when I almost started a fight over the leftovers I knew it was a hit.

Another one of those things I thought I hated until I tried this recipe.  I will never let my family eat creamed corn from a can again.

I was hunting for a creamed corn recipe and this was exactly what I wanted! I agree that it tastes just like Rudy's. I also used 2 bags of corn and it was perfect.

I was hoping this recipe would be a slow-cooker version of our family's scalloped corn--but it's not.  I guess because I was hoping for a different taste and texture, I wasn't very happy with the recipe.  I would say that it's okay, but the old fashioned corn, crackers and eggs recipe is what we love.

I have taken this dish to potlucks many times. I have request to bring it again and again. It's creamy enough so that if I need to add a can of corn at the last minute so it can stretch further, I can.

I made this for Thanksgiving just because I had all the ingredients on hand, and it was one of the stars of my dinner!  I am only giving 4 stars based on having to add more corn so that it was not so soupy, and I really don't think this needed a whole stick of butter for the amount of vegetable that was in it.  Will definitely make again, but will cut the butter in half and maybe add another few ounces of corn.  This was my brother's favorite of everything at the table, so I have a feeling it will be requested for every holiday meal from now unto eternity!....  :-)

This went over really well for Thanksgiving.  My family loved it, and the only complaint I received is that it may have been a little too creamy!  Will definitely make again.

This was so yummy! My 10 yr old ate 4 helpings at lunch and would have ate more if I let him!!  Took the advice of others and melted the cream cheese with the butter and it turned out great.  Will definately make often! Thanks.

We love this recipe, but using the amounts specified barely serves two of us. I have doubled and tripled the recipe, and it has turned out too runny both times. A large crock pot will help thicken it perhaps, as more surface will be exposed. Simple, cheap, and an easy addition to any planned meal.

I liked this recipe although it isn't my favorite.  Definitely stir the corn every now and then, because it does tend to burn on the sides of the crock pot.  I like the Corn Pudding 2 recipe on this website better, and it uses less butter so is healthier.

My family loves this! I have requests for it all the time since I made it the first time. I grew up with my Gramma making homemade skillet creamed corn so I wasn't as impressed as the rest of my family but apparently if you've not had real, off the cob, skillet made creamed corn this is great! And MUCH easier! LOL.

It was okay, not to flavorful.  I might add some spices next time.  Great for a non-flashy side dish.

I made this to go with my Christmas dinner of ham & sweet potatoes. This was everyone's favorite, however I doubled the amount of corn and sugar in the recipe.

OOOOH Goodness!!!  This was great.  I added a good bit Penzey's White Pepper to this and it was absolutely perfect.  I can't wait to make this again and wow my family with it Thursday on Turkey Day!

Delicious!  I made it for a group a friends and everyone wanted the recipe.  I let all the ingredients cook together for about an hour before adding the corn and then cooked on high for about 2 hours.

Incredibly easy!  I cut the kernels from fresh (cooked) corn-on-the-cob leftover from a BBQ.  It was probably about 6 ears, and that amount seemed just right.  I don't know that I'd call the recipe "creamed corn" since it really isn't what you'd expect, but the kids liked the cheesy flavor.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner this year.  It went over very well!  I was having Thanksgiving with friends and thier kitchen was packed.  Having a good slow cooker side dish recipe really helped me save space and make a good impression.

I have made this twice, once for my husband, once for my mother-in-law.  They both loved it!  I love that it is so easy to make! I use fresh, rather than frozen corn.  We have so much corn from the garden this year, so I thought I'd try some new recipes.  This one is definitely a keeper!!

This had a great flavor but there was too much sauce. I should have followed the advice in another review to use more corn than the recipe called for.  The sauce overpowered the taste of the corn and it was messy. Adding corn would lower the calorie count as well.  will do this next time!

Well...let me start OFF by saying I made this Slowcooker Creamed Corn recipe by mistake. I saved 2 very similar recipes in my collection and chose this one by mistake. Had everything in the crock pot when I realised my mistake. But everything turned out great because we really loved it. Creamy and had a great taste. It will definately be a regular in my family.

I always get rave reviews whoever I cook this for.  Sometimes I add a sprinkling of chilies.  Today, because I was to bring vegetables and corn is a grain, I added one bag of sweet frozen peas. Of course other options could be chopped green or even red peppers but today I only had peas.   I may get kicked out of the cream  corn club but ,it was delicious and we all had a boost of vitamin A!

Loved this!! I added a little garlic powder, chili powder, and a dash of cayenne pepper and it was a HIT for our Thanksgiving dinner.

I made mine with three bags of the 19oz sweet corn and only doubled the ingredients. I feel like tripling it would have made it way too creamy, but otherwise it was delicious!

This recipe is sooooo good!  I added an extra bag of corn because it seems like the frozen corn has gone from 16 oz bags to 14 oz bags. Anyway, I also added some roasted red peppers, smoked paprika and a little bit of red pepper flakes just for a kick. I will definitely be making this again!

This corn could pass as dessert. Creamy and rich. Why would anyone ever serve creamed corn from a can?

This recipe was a big hit at our Easter dinner. It was great to be able to throw ingredients into a slow cooker before church and come home to a yummy vegetable dish.

Holy moly this is some fattening creamed corn that I only make for Thanksgiving or another holiday. It's so easy to make and it's sooooooo GOOD! It never goes to waste. You could even freeze some fresh sweet corn from the summer and use that instead of canned or frozen corn from the store.

Delicious! We made this dish for Easter lunch and everyone loved it! Best part, it was super simple. We did double the recipe (and we used 2 full bags of frozen corn vs. 1.5, which i think worked out better, there was more than enough cheese sauce).

This is, by far, the number one requested recipe at our Thanksgiving dinner. So easy- just put it all in the slow cooker and stir occasionally.  Any leftovers, which we never seem to have, are great for a mashed potato/stuffing/turkey bowl!

Very much like the recipe. Doesn't need sugar if you getting sweet corn or Costco frozen corn. Make it twice nice. 2nd-time double recipe. If it's just for me I go without salt but add Ms. Dash.

I’m used to scalloped corn so I was afraid this would be too soupy. I added two cans of corn and it wasn’t soupy at all, this has a great flavor and I will for sure make it again.

I didn’t have time for the crock pot, so mixed it all up and put it in the oven.  Was very soupy.  Tasted good, but had to serve it in bowls!   Next time I’ll plan ahead and try the crock pot instead!

Really yummy.  Definitely add 2 bags of corn; otherwise too cream cheesy.  I passed a little cayenne pepper over it too but I always use a little cayenne in everything!

I will definitely make this again. It was delicious. The only thing I would forewarn about is starting it much earlier in the crockpot. I gave myself 4 hours on high but for me to have it ready by dinner time, I had to make some adjustments. Everything was cold when I started, the corn was frozen and the butter and cream cheese was cold. So I ended up having to take out the butter and cream cheese and microwave it then put it back in. Thankfully, that finally got it warming up and cooking. My suggestion is to either start way earlier, a couple of hours at least, or make sure everything is thawed out. This is the second year I’ve made this for Christmas dinner and it’s always a favorite for everyone.

This is so good and I love the simplicity of the recipe. The only change I made was I used a 2 pound bag of frozen corn as I made this one other time and found there was way too much cream sauce for the called for amount... it was perfect this time!

Made this for a large group of family members for Christmas dinner.  Followed instructions completely. It was barely touched and my husband and I found it to be very bland.  I should know better than to try a new recipe on a group of family and friends before trying it myself.

Good creamy corn. Followed others advice and added more corn and reduced milk. I also added a bit of paprika.

A big hit at Thanksgiving, but double or triple the amount frozen corn without increasing any of the cream sauce ingredients.  If you are just making one bag of frozen corn, half the cream cheese and other ingredients.  Also add some cayenne or smoked paprika for a nice zip!

I used 3 - 10 oz bags of frozen corn, 1 small can of Trader Joe's green chilies, 8 oz cream cheese, 1/2 stick of butter, 1/2 cup of half and half, salt and pepper to taste, diced red and green peppers.  I melted butter and cream cheese and mixed in half and half very well than added the rest. Stirred it constantly until bubbling and put it in a Crock-Pot sprayed with non-stick spray because I was running behind for a Thanksgiving dinner. I didn't have any leftovers as it was a huge hit! I did put a paper towel across the top of the Crock-Pot and a lid on top of that to help absorb the water from condensation. It was plenty creamy so I might add a box of Jiffy cornbread mix to thicken it up.

Brought it for a pot luck at work. My ratios were: for each pound of corn, 1/2 stick butter, 1/4 cup sugar, 4 oz. cream cheese plus salt and pepper to taste. Loved how it tasted! Nice alternative to just plain old corn.

I made this with 2 packages of 16oz frozen corn, could've used even more corn. Tasty and very rich.

I made this for national night out to go with our cookout meal - winner winner chicken dinner!!  this was so tasty - when my dad went to get my spoon - he said only about 1/2 spoon was left.  Because of the rain that day I did cook in oven - I cooked at 350 for 2 hours instead of crockpot and it turned out great

Doubled the corn, as suggested. Tastes like corn doused in too much cream cheese and butter. Would be better with some spices.

I made this for my son's birthday.  I was looking for something yummy but not time consuming to serve with other dishes.  This is it!  I did what others suggested and used 2 bags of corn.  I combined the cheese and butter and seasonings on the stove before adding to the frozen corn as well.  This went well with grilled chicken and there wasn't enough left to save!  My suggestion is to spray the crock pot liner before you cook.  Thanks Dotte and everyone who commented for this great recipe.

Absolutely amazing!!  I used 4 dozen ears of fresh sweet corn and it’s my go to recipe every year now!!  I used 1 cup of salted butter melted with 8oz cream cheese. I also used a pint of half/half and I had a cup of heavy cream in the refrigerator. YUM!!  Plan on making at least 10 more batches to put in the freezer.

I make this all the time using my microwave.  Just put everything in a glass bowl and nuke for 3-5 minutes stiring a couple times. No need to dirty a crockpot or waste a liner.  I omit the sugar its not needed at all.  Some times I use Fiesta corn or add a small can of dices green chilies.

I doubled the recipe and added meat from 8 fresh ears of corn. I also blended the cream cheese and milk together on the stove with 6 cloves of chopped garlic and 3 tbls of chopped sage before adding to the corn. Amazing! Will make again soon.

Made it with 1 and1/2 32 ounce corn. 3/4 cup butter and 12 ounces cream cheese also 4 Tab sugar. I also added some mild green chilies for a little Color and zest. It made a big batch. I think everyone liked it I only had about a half cup to take home.

I made this for Thanksgiving and thought it was pretty alright. The family said it was good, but my 6-year-old daughter LOVED it, had seconds, and requested it for lunch and dinner the next day! And she hates leftovers, for some weird reason. So, I suggest trying it and see what you think. Maybe you will love it!

I made the sauce with the exact dimensions as written. I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the corn, using 2 - 16oz frozen corn bags instead of just one as the recipe calls for. In addition, I heated up all the sauce ingredients in a sauce pan and whipped together on the stove top before pouring over the frozen corn and setting on high for 2 hours.  This easily fed 9 ppl and a 2 year old. Any leftovers were taken home by the guests. This was a keeper!! Several asked for the recipe.

This recipe is really delicious! I made it for a holiday maybe 3 years back, and it's been requested for every holiday meal since! I usually skip the giant slow cooker and make it on the stove top with canned corn. I just heat a pot on low and slowly melt the  butter and cream cheese, then stir in the sugar, salt, and pepper, then 2 drained cans of corn. I usually skip the milk, since it makes it really thin on the stove top.

I made this for a dinner party using grilled corn that I froze earlier in the year plus purchased frozen corn.  Made it just like the recipe (using reduced fat cream cheese and skim milk) and it was delicious!  Will definitely make it again.

Very easy and good.  I followed other reviews and melted the cream cheese and butter before mixing together.  I also chopped up a few strips of bacon and tossed that in because, well, it’s bacon.

I made this for the first for our Annual Thanksgiving potluck.  There's always a green bean casserole (which I don't like).  I thought corn sounds good.  

I...am...still...getting...compliments for my creamed corn more than a week later!!

I had to make a double batch (maybe a little more) so I used 2 sticks of butter and 2 packages of cream cheese and maybe 3 or 4 tablespoons of sugar and some Nature's Seasoning. And of course probably a lot of frozen corn, maybe 48 oz.

Anyway, it was a HIT!!!

I had high hopes for this as well, but to me it just tasted pretty bland, like corn with cream cheese.  Although, I must admit that my 86 year old mother loved it.

I doubled the recipe (tripled the corn) and the amount of the liquid was too much :(  I had to scoop out about 2 cups of the liquid to make it work. The only thing I didn't double was sugar. It tasted really good though.

This was delicious and I will definitely make it again.  I was in a rush, so I didn't use my crockpot.  I put everything but the corn in a saucepan and once it was melted and simmering, I added the corn.  Then I let it simmer for about 15 mins or so... until I could tell the corn was heated thru.  You'll have to stir it occasionally and keep an eye on it so it doesn't scorch.

I think this is really good and have gotten raves since I started making this for thanksgiving and/or Xmas. 

I doctor it up by using heavy cream instead of milk, a combo of white and light brown sugar for a richer taste, I also saute some diced yellow onion and then my secret ingredient, that really makes this good is BACON.. yes, bacon.. just oven cook some bacon, chop it up and throw it in at the beginning. 

Not at all heart healthy, fat free or diabetic friendly but .. it's good.

This was an instant family favorite!!  And it's easily adjustable which is nice because I never seem to have the exact right size of frozen corn (from Sam's Club).

I’ve never posted a review but thought I owed it to the writer. I’m not even a big fan of creamed corn but made it for husbands’s office potluck Thanksgiving.  Very large gathering, lots of different dishes.  It won the prize for best side dish!   Followed advice of combining sugar, butter, cream cheese, milk first and adding it to (canned) corn. I double recipe and added more corn till it looked “right.”  Major addition:  diced green chilies!!!

I don't care for runny cream corn, this recipes is perfect.  Although,  I did omit the sugar.  Why do so many recipes call for sugar,, when it is just not necessary and only adds extra calories?

This was pretty good.  I have made it a couple of times now.  Both times it did seem to curdle though, and the butter doesn't fully mix in all the way.  I reduced the butter by over half the second time, and it was just as good as adding in the full stick.  I also added in some green onions on another batch and it was a nice addition.  Thank you for the recipe!

I keep getting asked to bring this to my mother-in-laws house. The only thing I do different is to blend about half of it in the blender for a few pulses, to make it more creamy. It's a hit!

Without a  doubt, this is the very best creamed corn. I replaced the milk with heavy cream, only because I had it on hand. It is to die for! I made this for Thanksgiving, and by mistake I used 2 large (32 oz) packages of corn, so even for 40 people, I had plenty left over. What a treat to be able to eat it for several days after Thanksgiving!

This recipe isn't as creamy as I thought it would be.  I had to triple the recipe for a potluck at work and I wish I had used creamed corn with the whole kernel corn.  That would have made it creamier.  I added 3-4 tablespoons of bacon grease and crumbled cooked bacon over the corn before serving.  It was well received at the potluck but I will try a different version of this recipe the next time.

We enjoyed this recipe however we ended up tweaking it a little the second time around. Like others had suggested I puréed half of the corn with milk, this really helped with the texture. Second I added potato cubes, lastly I added some diced cooked sausage to give it a sweet and salty combo with was a total hit with the family an very delicious!

Let me tell you how frustrated I am with this recipe. ;) It is served at almost every fellowship I go to and by the time I get to it, there are about 5 kernels of corn and sauce left in the bottom of the crock-pot.  In my desperation, I scrape them up and slowly devour them.   I have tried multiple recipes trying to find one I like.  And...Oh. My!!!  This recipe is spot-on.  The creaminess is perfect.

Today, I had a problem, though.  I only had 30 minutes for lunch and couldn't find anything that looked good to me. I saw this recipe and thought I'd try it.  These are the changes I made. I sprayed a heavy glass bowl with cooking spray and dumped the butter, milk, cream cheese, and sugar into it.  I microwaved them until they were hot and bubbling. (about 8 minutes).  I then added 2 cans of drained whole-kernel corn and heated it for about 2 more minutes. Sprinkle of salt and done in about 12 minutes!  Delicious!

It's not healthy, I know, but I also don't feel the need to lick the inside of a crock-pot at a church fellowship anymore.

Blessings to Dotte for posting this recipe.  You are awesome!

I made this for my family and they loved it, even asked to make it again.  I did not alter the recipe as far as ingredients.  I did take the advice of one reviewer and heated approximately 4 oz of frozen corn in a microwave safe dish, then used an emulsion blender to break it down.  I added that to the remaining ingredients and combined.  It seemed to create a wonderful texture to the dish.  I served this with salmon and asparagus and it made an awesome dinner combination.  Thanks for sharing!

This is about the easiest creamed corn recipe I've found! As several others suggested, I added extra corn - in fact, I doubled it - and the corn-to-sauce ratio was perfect!

This was great, a huge hit at a pot luck. Was first thing to go. I was afraid it would be too "cream cheesy" but when mixed with the corn it was good. I precooked the ingredients (no corn) on the stove and dumped everything into the crock pot the night before. The day of I heated on high for 1 hour then low for 3. I also added Old Bay, which gave it some extra seasoning. I'm making this again (by popular request).

I made this exactly as the recipe said, and it turned out very good.  I mean, what doesn't turn out good with sour cream in it??  I would have scored it higher, but it just didn't seem like creamed corn.  At least not my mom's creamed corn!  It just didn't meet my expectations for creamed corn.

This was quite good. I adjusted the serving to 10. I did reduce the amount of milk, butter, and cream cheese a tad bit. I also left out the sugar and didn't miss it at all. It was done in my slow cooker in two and a half hours. My picky toddler liked it!

This is a versatile recipe that produces an alfredo-type sauce. I made it with frozen mixed veggies and frozen mushrooms. Three hours in, I tossed in some frozen chicken meatballs and shrimp. I added some red pepper flakes for some zing. We ate it over pasta, and it was awesome!

I made it for my family and they loved it, but it was a bit more liquidity then the picture and what I thought it would be. But overall it was pretty good and I'd make it again but with less butter, milk and cream cheese.

I have made this a few times and loved it. The only negative was that it was extremely rich. So, I cut the recipe in half (except the corn) but added an extra splash of milk. It worked great! Everyone liked it even better!!

I made this for Thanksgiving less than a month ago and have now made it 3 times. I took it for two potlucks because it was a hit at Thanksgiving. I suggest doubling the sauce and almost tripling the corn. Otherwise, you won't have any left. I do  use my immersion blender to blend up some of the corn so that the sauce is like creamed corn should be. I also use 1 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper per batch.  This is the best, easiest recipe ever. Love it! Thanks!

This is a great recipe. I love everything in it, so when all the ingredients are mixed together, something beautiful comes out. I did add about 10 oz. more corn, and there was still enough cream to go around. Definitely making this one again.

This recipe was very easy and yummy!  My husband is a huge fan of Rudy's creamed corn which we have in Austin, and a couple reviewers mentioned this was similar so I tried it.  He loved it!  I actually made it as a Thanksgiving side so had lots of family to try it out, and it was gone quickly and several people asked for the recipe.  I used 2 packages of corn as others suggested.  Honestly I am not a huge Rudy's creamed corn fan, it's too rich and sweet for my taste, but with the 2 bags of corn in this recipe I loved it!  This will be a repeat dish for sure.

A big hit on Thanksgiving Day. I did add additional corn as the ratio leans heavily toward the cream cheese.

I followed the recipe with one exception: I used two 16 oz. packages of frozen corn instead of 1 1/4 16 oz. packages (I like corn). Also, I simply combined all the ingredients directly in the slow cooker and cooked on high for 3-4 hours.

I think the "cream" never quite really creamed together; it was more liquid-like -- "soupy" may describe it. I'd have preferred the mixture become more of a cream. I'm a newbie cook, so be advised I may have done something wrong. However, I think next time I'll do the following:

1. Reduce the amount of 2% milk from 1/2 to 1/4 cup.
2. Mix the "cream" mixture together separately from the corn.
2A. Possibly use a hand mixer to blend and/or whip the cream mixture to help make it creamier too.
2B. Personal preference, I think it might add more texture if not also flavor by using a hand mixer to blend/shred about half of the corn -- I have memories as a kid of most creamed corn being partially shredded instead of entirely whole kernels but that may simply have been a side effect of the commercial process of making it.
3. Allow the butter to soften (it started as a hard brick).
4. Allow the cream cheese to soften more (it was fairly cold too).
5. Try cooking using the low setting for the longer time period (I was behind eight ball when needing to select slow or fast, so I opted for fast such that we weren't eating corn for dessert).

This is great! I used 24 oz of corn and melted cream cheese/ butter before. You don't have to stir as often. I have always made corn pudding from scratch, but this'd is sooo  good and sooo easy.

This is absolute fantastic!!!! Anyone that thinks it tastes like corn with cream sauce did not cook it long enough.  I easily cut this into 1/3 of the recipe and did it on the stovetop.  You just have to cook in long enough to infuse the flavor into the corn.  Yummy!

Made this today for a church potluck. Was well received and several asked for recipe. I was only left with a spoonful. The only changes I used was to 1/2 the amount of butter, used 2cups of fresh corn and a bag of thawed frozen corn and added garlic salt. I also warmed the room temp butter and cream cheese on the stove with the milk. Mine only took about 3 hours. Try it, it really is good. I took a picture of the empty crockpot to prove it!

I have made this several times and it is always a hit.  When I make it for Thanksgiving or Christmas I always have to at least double it.  Last time I made it I didn't use the crockpot I just cooked it on low on the stove for about 45 minutes or so.  So Yummy!!!!

I'm a little torn here. The recipe is good but the oil content is way too high. I'm also used to a soupier result. If I make this again, I may but the butter by at least half, reduce the cream cheese as well and increase the milk and/or half & half by at least a cup. Or, I could just save myself time and trouble and do it all by stove.

I LOVE this recipe!  I made it for our huge family Christmas dinner and it was great!  The only thing I did different is double the corn (used white shoepeg and sweet yellow) and added some garlic.  This will definitely be my go to recipe!  Thank you for posting it!

Really easy and really good. Used two drained cans of corn since I didn't have fresh or frozen, left everything else as-is. Cooked in the crockpot on high for about 3 hours and it turned out great!

was gone at the end of the dinner.  Everyone asked for the recipe. I
would only make this for a large crowd on very special occasions due
to all the calories..Postie

Warning: do NOT use neufchatel (aka low-fat cream cheese). I tried to save on calories but ended up with chunky creamed corn :(   The neufchatel just doesn't melt right. In the end, it still tasted okay but with a weird texture.

Just as the others have said.. this is very much like Rudy's creamed corn.  Simple to make and a bit surprising if you are expecting that nasty canned style cream corn. This is definitely not like canned cream corn at all!  While I do love the original recipe, sometimes it is nice to thicken it up just a little by using an additional bag of corn.. that is if you don't mind the leftovers, which we don't!

I have made this recipe without the sugar and without the milk.  I do not like to put sugar in foods that I normally think of as having more of a salty flavor.  However, if you like sugar in vegetables, I am sure that you would enjoy this version of the recipe.  Overall, a very good recipe and easy to take to social outings.  Always a hit.

O-M-Goodness!! I made a double batch because I thought my kids were coming for dinner. They didn't show up so I ate pretty much the whole thing over the next two days.  Yeah, I was sick to my stomach from the overdose of corn - but it was soooooooo good.  I used Freshlike frozen corn. This is on my Thanksgiving Day menu!!

This was very easy and very tasty!  I don't think I've ever had creamed corn and I've never made it before so I wasn't sure how it was supposed to turn out.  But my extended family loved it and said it was really good.  I made just plain corn, to be safe, and no one touched it, they all wanted the creamed corn. I cooked mine on low for six hours and the longer it cooked in the slow cooker, the better it got.  I plan to make it again soon!

I used one whole package of organic frozen creamed corn (that's all I had in the deep freeze), four "single serving" packages of chive and onion Philly cream cheese (sale at Grocery Outlet!) and I used fat free evaporated milk. Good but whoa, it's RICH. I was able to use my small crockpot, like the one I use for dips. I just threw everything in a couple hours before dinner and wa-la....all done. Good, but next time, I'd add some chopped fresh onion, minced garlic and omit the sugar. Maybe cut back the butter. All of us thought the sugar just didn't belong. I LOVED how easy it was. LOVED. And pretty much, anything with cream cheese is just awesome.

Tried this last Thanksgiving, going exactly from the recipe, & although the flavor was good, the corn itself was very overcooked and dry.

Don't think I'll ever by the stuff in the can ever again. I did use fresh corn off the cob as well as frozen. The bicolor beauty of it made for a great photo as well. Thanks Dotte, this was wonderful and a great addition to my recipe box.

I have made this a few times for larger gatherings and it is so easy to make.  Everyone loved it.  The only thing I did differently was add more corn.  And stir a few times as it cooked to break up the brick of cream cheese.

I don't think this turned out quite as expected.  I had to add a lot of corn as the sauce to corn ratio was large.  It was tasty, but I don't think I'll be making it again.

this is pretty delicious! however, i used about half the about of cream cheese because i didn't want it to be too thick. In addn, i used canned corn instead of frozen. made it for a thanksgiving potluck and everyone said it was delicious!!! tip: let the cream cheese reach room temperature so there won't be large chunks of it

OMG.......this is literally to die for yummy!  Now, can you afford to eat something this rich often, I ask?  The answer is most definitely NOT!   However, for special occasions this one is a keeper; you won't be disappointed in making it.   I even used reduced fat cream cheese and cut back on the butter and it was still fabulous.  Took it to a Christmas meal and 'they' ate it up.  It tastes just like Rudy's restaurant recipe (a Texas barbeque place).

I just tried this for Christmas and my husband and I just loved it!!! But we did decide next time to omit the sugar, as for us, don't need or care for the sweet. Did melt everything in pot on stove but corn and than added all to crockpot on hight for one hour, than low for 3 to 4. Fabulous....

I made this for a Thanksgiving dinner, with the usual "creamed corn?'  "Yuck." However, it was delicious!  I used 3 packages of steam in the microwave corn, and added a bit of chopped onion and sweet red pepper for color.  I think that next time, I'll bake it in the oven with crumbled bacon on it.  It was great, and has already been requested for our next family dinner.

I used 2 10 oz frozen corn packs. I melted all ingredients in a saucepan and poured over frozen corn in the slow cooker. I also added 1/2 tbsp of sugar. I cooked on high for 3 hrs. (stirring occasionally). I kept it on WARM till dinner time and it was just perfect.

Great Recipe!! My family loved the flavor.  I caught my son sneaking samples.  I did add 1/4 cup extra milk and followed another review by heating the milk, butter and cream cheese prior to adding to the cooker which help greatly.  We will have this again!!!

This is good as is, BUT I prefer to replace half of the cream cheese with the american cheese. Even if you like this recipe already, try this. It is a nice blend of flavors.

Yummy stuff, this corn!  I used two 16 oz. bags of frozen corn, one of white corn, one yellow, since the last time I made this, there seemed to be a whole lot of sauce left over.  It turned out beautifully.  So easy, so tasty!

This was certainly easy.  I scaled it up to 20 servings, and it still didn'[t seem to make a lot.  It got mixeed reviews, as I would expect "creamed corn" to receive.  Some people just are not fans of that texture.  They people who liked it, LOVED it.  Personally, I didn't think it was exceptional.  I DID, however, use lower-fat Neufchatel cream cheese, rather than regular.  That maybe makes the difference?  In other recipes, and/or eating it straight, I usually cannot tell much of a difference.

Also, I followed other people's examples, and melted/mixed the creamy ingredients before putting them into the crock pot...I recommend doing this, because it is very thick and creamy.

I thought the recipe was very good. I changed it a little by adding 1/2 can of roasted green chiles; two chopped shallots; and two cups shredded cheddar cheese. I would advise not letting this cook too long as mine seemed to get a little dry. Still, I got many favorable responses and it's very easy to make.

Simple, but you definitely have to keep your eye it so that it doesn't burn.  I wouldn't recommend cooking it on high.  It started burning around the edges after less than an hour on high.  I just thought the corn was ok, but my husband really liked it.  Although, he likes just about anything with corn in it.

This is a good recipe, but it needs more sugar and if your going to cook it as long as it says to you certainly need more liquid.  I had to turn my crock pot off and then turn it back on when it was closer to dinner time.  I've used a recipe similar to this but just with buttermilk instead of cream cheese and cooked it on the stove pot and it came out better than this did.

This recipe is great. I've had this recipe for a few years now and it is always a big hit. I always use two packages corn. Glad to see it made it to All Recipes!

I carried this to Thanksgiving dinner this year and it was a huge hit.  Then two of my friends wanted the recipe and their families loved it too.  Everyone thinks it tastes like homemade.  So easy to make; it has become one of my new "offers" of what to bring to a dinner.

I can never imagine eating corn any other way now -- this corn is so good that I've had another helping instead of dessert.

I followed others' suggestions and used 2 bags of corn. It was good, but still runny.  I might try just baking it instead of slow cooking.

I made this for our Christmas dinner at work.  We all enjoyed it and I will make it again.
