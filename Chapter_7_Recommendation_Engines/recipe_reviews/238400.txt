I love it, but it works better if you boil the milks with cinnamon sticks, let it cool and then blend everything together.

Skipped the water, doubled the recipe and only added 1 can of evaporated milk per batch.  Also, used 151 for rum.  Tastes just like the one I used to drink growing up in PR.

Very easy to make and a hit in the house. The ratio

to alcohol and cocquito was perfect. Will definitely do again.

I've used this recipe several times to make Coquito for friends and family and it's always a hit during the holidays.

This is delicious. I used one can of evaporated milk, increased coconut milk to 3 cans, 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk and omitted the water.  Kept the cinnamon and nutmeg the same as the recipe called for. Used cinnamon sticks as garnish and a sprinkle of coconut flakes on top. Great with or without rum. Enjoy.
