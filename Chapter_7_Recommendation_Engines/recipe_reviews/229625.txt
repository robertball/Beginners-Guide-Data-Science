I m always pleased to be the first reviewer of a really terrific recipe. I made a half recipe using it for 12 cupcakes. This cake is dee-licious - but it s NOT a pound cake. (The amount of leavening is a dead giveaway) It is a light and fluffy yellow cake not the heavy cake with the dense compact crumb so characteristic of a pound cake. So if you re looking for a sturdy cake suitable for carving or for a genuine pound cake this would not be the recipe to choose. I am not criticizing the cake at all as it is a lovely moist yellow cake. I only criticize its name.

Finally! I bought a new convection oven & all my old & new cake recipes hopelessly collapsed.This is an excellent recipe. The cake came out perfectly done fluffy moist & all. I made half the recipe & had to add 1/4 cup more buttermilk & a full teaspoon baking soda & baking powder. I think I'll try some orange zest next time to add some flavor but otherwise perfect!

I made this into cupcakes...They came out lovely light and fluffy..definitely not like a pound cake. But pretty boring so i drizzle some lemon/confectioner sugar over the rest while still warm. The whole family especially my mom in law loves it! Score one for me!! Ty for sharing this recipe:D

I will agree with the reviewer who said this is not a pound cake. Otherwise it's pretty tasty.

OMG finally a yellow cake recipe that is not dry and does not require simple syrup to make it moist. This cake is great tasting moist and easy to make. The only thing I changed was adding one tablespoon of vanilla extract instead of one teaspoon and baked it for 45 min. I would recommend waiting to eat the cake the next day. THIS IS A KEEPER.

I would give it 5 stars but I used butter instead of shortening (shortening yuck!). I used it as a base to make multiple types of cakes. I made lemon curd and used that to make lemon and lemon blueberry. I also made vanilla and a cinnamon.

Yes I will make it again. It was not really a pound cake but I did serve it with sliced strawberries and whipped cream for dessert. I did not make a frosting or glaze for it. It was delicious and moist.
