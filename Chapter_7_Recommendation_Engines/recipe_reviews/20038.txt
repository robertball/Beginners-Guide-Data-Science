This recipe is so good!!  Rather than placing on grill I place mine in the oven on 350 for just a couple of mintues or until the marshmallows are toasted/browned.
2 thumbs up!!

These are wonderful!  A nice change from s'mores. We do sometimes add peanutbutter also for an extra gooey treat.

Mmmmmmm!  We just got back from a camping trip and we have fallen in love with this recipe.  It's delicious!  My husband said that he wants to make this at home in the oven!  The only thing I would do different next time is stuff the marshmallows in first because they were all over the aluminum foil and not in the banana.  Thanks for a great idea.

When I counseled Church camps in the 70's, we called these banana boats.  Ours were slightly different.  We left the stem attached, and cut a wedge the length of the banana, leaving the peel attached on the stem end.  Then we would fill the opening with pieces of a chocolate candy bar and marshmallows, and cover with the piece of peel before cooking in the fire.  Equally good and equally messy.

These were so cool! Even my hubby who normally doesn't have dessert was curious enough to try one of these, then he went to work and told everyone so now I have to make copies of this recipe. The bananas were a little tricky to stuff but worth it. I recommend also using nonstick foil as well with these!

Let these cook slow and make sure they melt! Eat with a spoon for an excellent treat. We camp a lot through the summer, and this is a great change of pace, and mom's way to sneak in some extra fruit! For those reading other reviews, OF COURSE YOU DON'T EAT THE PEEL!!! scoop the filling out!

I tried this while camping this weekend and our guests LOVED it. I used peanut butter & milk chocolate chips and it was awesome. Everyone kept saying we needed some ice cream,whipped cream and cherries and it would be complete.  I think I will try butterscotch chips next time. Thanks for a great recipe!!

These were terrible. I won't ever try these again, they tasted like melted plastic. Maybe I did something wrong. I don't think cooked banana peels are very edible.

I made these for my family on our camping trip and they loved them! We used regular chocolate chips and peanut butter chips! I'm sure they will become a regular item on our camping menu!

This was awesome. We made this camping as an alternative to Smores and everyone went crazy for them. We used peanut butter M&M's in some bananas and mini Snickers in other bananas.  This will be a regular item we take camping from here out.  Very easy, yummy, and fun!

As an avid camper, these are a wonderful change to s'mores!  I use the posters ingredients, but to mine I also add Reeses peanut butter chips and honey roasted nuts before throwing on the fire. This is a favorite of my family!

When we make this at home (you can do it quite well over the grill) we top the bananas with crushed up graham crackers when they are done.  And remember you don't have to use chocolate chips; caramel ones are nice, or preanut butter, or cinnamon, or even the swirled kind.

Delicious! But why leave the banana in the peel? Too much hassle. Next time I will wrap all bananas individually and without the peel!

My husband really liked this but I wasn't so fond of it. The flavours were nice but I didn't like the texture of the cooked banana. Will make again for my husband.

This was a nice change from s'mores, my kids loved them.  I followed the recipe and when I took them off the campfire I added caramel sauce, crushed nuts and cherries, delicious!  Takes a little more preperation then s'mores but worth it!  Thanks!

Spectacular starter recipe! A throwback to my Girl Scout days these are totally back in. We have a fire pit and we don't have to wait to go camping to make. Use release foil and peel the bananas, use different toppings, m&m's, nuts (yes!), reese's pieces, etc. Have a can of whipped cream on hand plus a jar of cherries. DELICIOUS!!!!

Rather than spraying foil, a sheet of Reynold's Non-Stick (Release) foil works nicely.

While visiting our grandsons in Virginia I wanted to do something different and remembered these "Banana Boats" from when I was a Girl Scout...50 years ago....I used butterscotch chips, semi-sweet chips and chopped nuts with the marshmallows...yummmmmm...coconut would be good too...any of the "chips" would be great!  The boys loved making their own variations! So glad my memory isn't shot and I could remember these wonderful Banana Boats...

We called them Banana Boats when we making them in Girl Scouts!

Made 50 of them at a beach outing with families. Had the kids on an assembly line and they were a hit! 
Had to do it every year after that :):)

Oh my gosh, these are SO good!  I was a little turned off by the idea of eating a hot banana, but we had hot coals after grilling some corn and it seemed a shame to waste them.  I threw these together and my fiancee grilled them for about 10 minutes.  All four of us loved them!  I had to use marshmallow creme and nonpariels instead of mini marshmallows and chocolate chips, because that's what I had on hand.  It worked well and I think I liked them better with the marshmallow creme than I would have with mini marshmallows (I'm not fond of the texture of marshmallows, but the creme is okay).  Can't wait to make these as a treat for my nieces and nephews next time they come to visit!

I was cooking food on a stick today, and looking for some new recipes, and was given this. This actually cooked directly on the fire but was protected by the foil. I did have heavy duty foil though. I liked the concept of cutting the banana into disks and leaving it in the peel and wrapping it. I even liked the taste of the warm banana. However, the marshmallow and chocolate made it WAY TOO SWEET! This was with just a sprinkle of chocolate and marshmallow, which was no where near the amount called for in the recipe. I am definitely going to try baking a banana over the fire again but experiment with sweeteners and flavorings. I am thinking of doing a banana foster inspired one next time just lightly sweetened.

These are so yummy! I used milk chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, and marshmallows. Really STUFF the banana with these, I did not, and everyone told me I should have added more. But they were still delicious! Tastes just like a banana split. Leave them on the grill or fire until the marshmallows and chips are 90% melted (which was longer than 5 minutes for me). This was a hit at a large summer grill out!

The young adults in my church used to make these at bonfires, with a few changes: we spread in peanut butter, sprinkle with chocolate chips and coconut flakes, then drizzle with sweetened condensed milk. Seal the foil and set near the fire in coals for about 5 minutes until the bananas have softened. This is super gooey, and very sweet (at least to me) but they are a great treat once in a while.

I was really excited to make these on our camping trip, but I did not care for this recipe. I like all the ingredients, but I guess a hot banana just doesn't agree with my taste buds.

This was pretty good. The first time we made them was a little frustrating because all the marshmallow ended up on the aluminum foil. The second time we just split the bananas lengthwise on some foil and laid the toppings on, then grilled the whole thing open, which seemed a little easier. Great idea- thanks

When I was a "Scout" we made these!  We would peel the banana and cut a wedge in 4 places the length of the banana and fit a square of hershey's with a big marshmallow between the chocolate. These were placed in a foil pouch.  It was such a treat!

1 star for looks (rotten pickle appearence) but 5 stars for taste. I overloaded each bananna with marshmellows and chocolate chips, the smell was amazing when they were cooking. Great idea, lots of happy kids!

I love to cook over the campfire at our family place in the PA mountains and I'm always looking for a new idea. Tried this over the holiday weekend and it is a keeper! I used marshmellows, coconut, peanut butter chips and chocolate chips. This was so good and such a nice change. Can't wait to make these with my boy friend's kids. They will enjoy making these but will love eating them more!

We had extra bananas when we went camping last weekend and shared them with our "next door neighbors".  They were a huge hit and provided an entre' for our grandkids and their kids to be great camping buddies all weekend long.

I enjoyed this recipe as a dessert after all day camping. It combined the great taste of fruit, chocolate, and marshmallows. Yummy! I'll remember this recipe next time we go camping.

I've been raving about this recipe for a week! I'd recommend going heavier on the marshmallows and lighter on the chocolate so the chocolate doesn't overwhelm.

We took this recipe to try camping in the summer and these were very messy to make and to try and eat.  I'm not sure that I will make them again.

I first learned this 50 years ago at Girl Scout camp. Yes, 50 years ago! Only difference was we used squares of Hershey bars. It made enough of an impression on me that I did it with my friends when we started camping 20 years ago. If at all possible, bring out a glass of cold milk to go with it. Delicious!!!!

Fun recipe. The banana gets sweeter with cooking it. I had to return the banana to the fire a couple of times to get the marshmallows to melt so don't be afraid to put the banana in a hot spot of fire.

We tried this --we added vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce to make it a full banana split.  It was a nice change from smores.  Will make again.  Only suggestion--do not keep it in the coals too very long-so it won't burn.

I tried this 2 ways! I made one with sliced almonds and one with peanut butter! Both were equally delicious! I used regular sized marshmallows and just cut them into pieces with kitchen shears! I placed them in first and then added mini chocolate chips and almonds or peanut butter on top because I didn't want the marshmallows to stick to the tin foil. This was so good! I think I'll make them many more times and add different topping! You can't go wrong with this recipe!

I made these when I was a counselor at church camp, but we called them banana boats and sometimes added peanut butter. Honestly, it's the only way I will eat chocolate and peanut butter together. these are AMAZING!

So easy and so yummy! They were a big hit with my whole family. I am not a fan of marshmallows unless they are toasted golden brown, so I would be ok with leaving them out next time. I am wondering how peanut butter chips would be instead of chocolate?

We do this at GS Camp every year, this year I have Daisy Scouts (ages 5-6) and its easy enough they can make it and they LOVE doing it. For Variety, i like to put Peanut butter in mine, and it makes it like a Fondue tasting option. Really really yummy

OMG, sooo yummy. I had been wanting to try this while camping, but I knew eating bananas attracted mosquitos. Well, we decided to go halloween camping (it was 40 degrees out...no mosquitos) so I decided to try it. We put peanut butter, choc chips and marshmellows in it. placed directly in the campfire for about 7 minutes (which seemed like forever cause i was so excited)....yummy, i may need to go camping in the cold more often just to have the excuse to make these....did I say YUMMY! yet?

These sounded better then they tasted. They were messy and hard to open up. Maybe I cooked them to long.  It was hard to tell how long to cook them for.  It was an okay recipe.  Different then smores.  Try 1 tortilla with choc chips, peanut butter and marshmellows.  Wrap up in foil and put on the campfire.  YUM!

Tastes great and they're fun to make. We had a banana stuffing party and let the kids stuff the bananas with chocolate chips, coconut, and chopped pecans. We actually served these over vanilla ice cream too! Wonderlicious! 6/15/09:  DON'T let these grill too long unless you like mushy bananas!

I love it! Try using mini marshmallows and mini chips. Also, adding crumbled graham crackers. Another trick to make them less messy is to scoop out a "trough" of banana to put the ingredients in and keep peel intact to lay back over then wrap in foil.

Fantastic and sooo easy! We used marshmallow fluff the first time because we didn't have marshmallows on hand, after using the real thing the second time I would say that the fluff worked better. Good stuff, can't wait 'til we have kids to share this with! :)

These were great!  We put these on the grill after dinner one night. The kids enjoyed stuffing them with mini marshmellows, chocolate chips, and crushed graham crackers for texture.  I wasn't sure how they'd react since they're not banana lovers to begin with but they were a hit!  They've been asking to make them again ever since!

Really great treat for camfires, but pretty messy - that's part of the fun make sure you have plenty of wipes.  For the reviewer with the issue with mosquitos - but a dryer sheet in your shirt pocket - mosquitos will stay away.

This was so easy to just assemble and wrap then throw in the coals. We made an assembly line to speed things along. Our camping experience wasn't the best but there were a lot of compliments on the bananas!

Yummy!  I forgot the chocolate chips, so I broke up some cookies that had peanut butter and were fudge-covered.  My hubby was very skeptical, but he ate the whole thing and finished my youngest son's as well!  You can really play around with the flavors.

Tried this recipe while on our adults only Memorial Day camping trip.  Excellent!  I was leary because I'm not a big fan of marshmallows, but they taste just like banana splits.  Even the guys loved them.  I stuck to the recipe except we added Heath Bar chips that I had left over from my cookie baking stash at home.  Took earlier advice and not only sliced the banana, but also cut it into chunks for easier eating.  Will definitely make these for the little ones on our next family outing.

We have made this recipe for years around the campfire or even sometimes when we grill out.
I always add some peanut butter and different types of chocolate chips.  I enjoy experimenting with it. 
A good recipe :)

It was fun to make as a family.  I cut the bananas in half for my kids and we experimented with peanut butter chips.  YUM!  Good alternative to S'mores.

These were absolutely FABULOUS!!!!  I'm not much for s'mores, but this was amazing.  Will most definitely make this again, but I think will try with a little bit of ice cream on the side.  They steaming hot banana will blend with the ice cream to perfection!!!

Have made this in the firepit for many years already, 20 to be exact. You can add what ever flavor of chips you desire.  Butter scotch, mint, chocolate,  peanut butter along with your marshmallows. Remove peel and add vanilla icecream its a favorite.

This is what we former Girl Scouts called a “BananaBoat.”  Easy and delicious!  We made it in our campfire, but I guess you could also make it in the oven.  Be sure to put it on a cookie sheet, as it might drip down and mess up your stove!

I don't know what Pat did to get the plastic taste.  Should not have been there and most definitely do not eat the banana peel.  We used to have these all the time when our girls were in girl scouts.  They all loved them.  They are a great treat to have all year long.  Try them in your fireplace or back yard fire pit too.

These were good and the kids really enjoyed them! They chose to use colored mini marshmallows, which was fun and pretty. We made these on the grill, which worked out great. I make a version of this that uses butter, brown sugar, chocolate chips and coconut (oh, YUM!!!), so I prefer them to these, but the kids liked this version, so I will make them again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Omg.. is there really a 1 star review where they are the peel? I guess the recipe should say don't eat the peel, only three stuff inside.  I love these!  Grew up on them, my kids will too. 

Add raisins or coconut and they are yum!

We are avid camping cooks and this did not taste right. We felt the inside tasted more like the banana pith. Sorry, but this one did not suit our taste somehow.

This is a great recipe!!!  I remember making a similar banana while camping as a girl scout.  Only thing we did differently was to just peel back 1 section of the peel and then cutting a wedge out of the banana and then putting the marshmallows and chips in and then pulling the peel back over it before wrapping in foil!!  I think that keeps the gooey in the banana better!

My hubby and I tried this for the first time a couple of weeks ago on a camping trip to Cherokee, NC. We both loved it! Tastes just like a banana split. We are going to add cherries next time.

I had heard of these but had never tried them. My family & I went camping with friends last weekend. I made them with lots of ooo's & aaa's. So much flavor and melty goodness. My friend Karen said her husband loved it so much that he saved some on his shirt for the next morning. It was hard however to get the regular marshmellows in with chips, so I think next trip I will use the miniture ones. Thanks for the great new camping idea for dessert!!! E

Made these with my Girl Scouts when I was a leader years ago ... they were well loved, so I made them often when we were just grilling at home, especially with a crowd.  Cool option is to set out little bowls of LOTS of filling options - have used not only chips and mini marshmallows, but also chopped nuts, coconut (toasted especially good!), chopped up snicker bars, smashed up graham crackers ... your imagination and your cupboard are great inspiration!  If you think it'll be good in there ... it probably will!

It sounds so simple, but these are amazing.  The kids (and grownups, too) love these when we go camping!

Yummy treat for around the campfire!  Didn't use a grill and instead wrapped in tinfoil and put directly into the fire (around the edges).  Turned out perfect!

This was great!  I don't like bananas so I didn't make one for myself, but the rest of the family did and I tried it. I was surprised, it was so good!  We used choco chips, mini marshmallows, and sliced almonds.

Excellent, I had my class make these and they were a huge hit.  Many went home and made them.
