I realize I made this marinade last summer and never rated it...better late than never. I recall using 1 clove crushed garlic instead of the powder and used a few 'grinds' of fresh ginger instead of powder. Subbed balsamic for the red wine vinegar. I omitted the sausage and just did this with lamb pieces. Marinated overnight in the fridge and it was great flavor at the picnic the next day done on the grill. Very tenderizing marinade with great flavor. Also added some Kosher salt to the marinade and a little Harissa for spice. This is a great grill marinade and would be great with chicken as well.

I only did the lamb from this as i needed a quick idea for my BBQ! My partner wasnt over the moon about it! He felt the spice over powered everything. I think it just needs a bit of a tweak for our tastes.

Not what I expected....needs modification. I just made the chicken so maybe that's what was wrong. Smells really good but the flavor is not there. I would try this again...but with fresh masala and ginger.....

Easy to prep and the flavors worked out great. Made the complete recipe with chicken lamb and sausages. Served with coconut cilantro rice and a simple jicama/bean/tomato salad. A keeper and will make again.
