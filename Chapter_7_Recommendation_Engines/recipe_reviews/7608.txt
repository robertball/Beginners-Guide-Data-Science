I've made other desserts like this that turned out with a hard crust, but this turned out soooo soft. Be careful when pouring the topping mixture over the marshmallows, or you might cave in the middle. I had marshmallows coming up the sides of the pan, so next time when I pour on the topping, I'll do it slowly and in spoonfuls along the edges first then work my way in. Also! The bag of peanut butter chips wasn't enough, so I added peanut butter to that mixture and a little more corn syrup too.

This dessert is super rich and has great flavor! I've made it many times and my best advice is to LIBERALLY spray the sides of your baking pan to prevent the marshmallow from becoming a permanent fixture. I also spray my knife before attempting to cut this dish. Also, I've found I'm too cheap to buy the necessary 2 cups of peanut butter chips and just use a standard 12 oz. bag (which is about 1.5 cups. It works just fine. Enjoy!

What a fun recipe! This is definitely a bar recipe and not a cake. I used 1/2 cup more marshmallows than it called for (personal preference). Awesome taste, much better than a Payday candy bar. I highly recommend this recipe, it is rich and chewy and yummy!

Fun to make and tastes like my favorite candy bar!  

I plan at looking at all of Suzanne Stull's recipes.  I love the 2 I've done so far!!!!

I have to add to this review.  I've made these bars too many times to count now.  People absolutely rave about them.  I'm known for my baking and I'd say these rank on the very tippy top of my best.  The most wonderful thing is that they are easy!

This was really good. My husband was having 16 guys over for a poker party last weekend, and I decided to try this recipe out on them. Needless to say, the bars were gone instantly, and I have requests to make these again for the next get-together. 
Next time I make these, I will try to make them with chocolate cake mix.

The bar cake turned out very well but even in a tupperware it became very hard very fast. It only took a few days for it to lose the softness.

These went over pretty well but personally I think that there was just too much going on...the cake base, the marshmallows, the chips, the cereal and then the nuts... good flavor but very sweet and like I said, just too busy for my tastes!

Wow!! Yummy.  I made this for dinner guests.  My family and their family loved it.  I sprinkled chocolate chips on top at the very end.  Wouldn't change anything else about it.

Not sure where the "cake" portion of the title came from because these are definitely bars. And good ones! The regular bags of PB chips are 1 2/3 c. but I found that you really need the additional 1/3 c. to cover all of the marshmallows.

These were superb and could easily be changed up by using all the different flavored marshmallows and chips available.   Everyone at the party I took these to raved about them.  I used a funfetti cake base which people loved.  I think making with half chocolate chips and half PB would turn out great, as would using some of the seasonal marshmallow flavors.  A crowd-pleaser for all!

Um freaking AMAZING!But very sweet, very rich. After one bite, my husband got that shocked "OMG this is SO AMAZING" look...but you can't eat much more than one bar without a sugar coma! I added about 1/3 c peanut butter to the sauce before adding peanuts and crisp rice. Very gooey and very rich. Also very fast and easy to make!

Yes, this is quite good!  My husband said it tasted like a soft Payday candy bar.  I did add 1/2 a cup of peanut butter to the topping because my bag of chips was only 1 1/2 cups.  Otherwise I made as written.  I like the salty with the sweet and the softness of the cake layer.  A hit!

These bars are a must make for anyone who likes sweet & salty combinations. I did have a bit of trouble with the recipe since the peanut topping didn't "spread" very well over the melted marshmallow. I ended up mixing up another half batch of the peanut topping to completely cover all the marshmallow.

A great recommendation for candy bar lovers. If you like sweet and chewy, you will love these bars! This would also be a great recipe to make with kids. They can help mix the crust with their hands and press it into the pan. Thanks, Suzanne!

I wouldn't recommend this cake to candy bar lovers.  The base has a "cake mix" aftertaste, the bars are much sweeter and stickier than peanut candy bars.  This one isn't a keeper in my recipe box.

I love these bars.  I made them for a church lunch.  They were gone before I could get one.  (Good thing I had saved a few at the house) Several people asked me for the recipe.  I made these bars many years ago, but they were called something else.  I'm glad I found them here again!

This recipe is very easy and yet very rewarding. It's sweet and salty just like a Payday candy bar. I actually had this recipe a few years ago and lost it. I'm so glad Suzanne posted this. It's just like the one I had. Thanks!

This is my husband's favorite Christmas cookie. Used holiday rice crispies for some festive color. Also used one bag of peanut butter chips and a big scoop of peanut butter. There are a few different variations on this recipe out there but this is the best crust. Use lightly sprayed parchment paper for easy removal.

I agree with one of the other reviewers that the crust has a strong cake mix taste.  I also felt the crust was too crunchy. I am an avid baker and this recipe was definitely not a 5***** for me, as it was for so many others.  I will not make this again.

This was excellent.  It tasted just like the candy bars.  I will make this again many times.  Thanks.

This is a great recipe!  I took 1/2 the pan to work and everyone just loved them.  (I'm glad I saved some at home). Wouldn't change a thing.

This cake is so easy - it goes together in about 10 minutes. It is so good, I could probably eat the entire cake...but I choose to share it, and it doesn't last long at home or any church gathering I take it to.
