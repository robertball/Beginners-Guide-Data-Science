I really liked this recipe. The second time I made it, I used less nutmeg and substituting golden raisins for the cranberries. Not that there was anything wrong with the given recipe, I just tailored it more to suit my personal preferences. Thank you, Stoney Lake

Nice recipe. I didn't have enough apples, so I used what I had and made up the difference with a frozen berry medley (strawberries, blueberries, blackberries and raspberries...just berries with nothing on them). Turned out great! Served warm with a little half and half...didn't have any ice cream..

The addition of the dried cranberries was a nice change of pace from our usual apple crisp.  It was wonderful served with vanilla ice cream.
