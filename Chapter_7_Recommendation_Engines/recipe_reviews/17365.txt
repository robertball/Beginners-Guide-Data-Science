Simple but just what I was looking for in a cooked eggnog. I made it the first time with the cream but it was almost too thick. I left out the cream and added rum flavoring. It's just like the store bought eggnog that I love but at less than 1/4 the price.

Some tips that made this easier for me:
Cook this over medium heat in a double boiler (or in my case a metal bowl over a pot of boiling water). This will make the cooking take a little longer but will all but eliminate the risk of curdling. The target temperature should be 170F. This is hot enough to kill any bacteria but not hot enough to make scrambled eggs.

What a super simple but superb recipe! The only things I did different is to strain the egg mix before you chill it (to get out those lovely membranes). I also stirred in 1 tsp. of nutmeg before serving. Shake the nog up every time before serving and be careful about heating the egg mix, or you'll get a bowl of scrambled eggs in milk (like I did :)).

This was my first attempt at making eggnog and it was very easy and turned out delicious. Remember to refrigerate the 'nog' if you like it thick. Yummy!

The flavor was great (especially with a cinnamon sprinkled on top!)  I was looking for a recipe like my mom made when we were growing up, but being pregnant wanted something without raw eggs.  Cooking the eggs worked good (Thanks for the recommendation to strain the eggs.) , but the finished product was way too thick!  Don't whip up the cream.  Maybe I whipped it up too much... but when I drank it it made me feel bloated.  Go easy on the whipping and it might be great.

This is a marvelous recipe...be careful cooking the eggs...be sure you cook on low heat and watch the consistency. I get raves everytime I cook and serve this! Great for Christmas and New Years!!!

A nice simple nonalcoholic eggnog I will make it agian but will reduce eggs by 1/3 as my family doesn't like it quite so "eggie". Also have your icebath ready ahead of time and put the top of your double boiler into the icebath imeadiatly upon the eggnog reaching 170 degreas F or you will end up with a few srambled eggs in the mix. We just used nutmeg and it was wonderfull.

I just made this Eggnog, because I didn't want to use raw eggs, but I didn't like the consistency of it. It was just not smooth enough. The flavor was good, though.

I had my students in Foods and Nutrition class make this recipe.  Some weren't going to try it because they didn't like eggnog, but they all ended up loving it!  It's so much better than store-bought egg nog.

VERY eggy flavor.  Well, I overcooked it.  Should have read all of the reviews that said to heat to 170 degrees.  I was excited about not having to temper the eggs...but it didn't work out for me.  I'm going to try again, but this time temper the eggs and cut it down to 3 yolks.

I live in Korea (where eggnog doesn't exist) and was looking for a good, non-alcoholic eggnog. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great! The first time I did not add the whipped cream and it was fine, but the second time I added it and it was perfect. I'm sure that I'll have to make it three or four more times before Christmas!

This recipe was absolutely wonderful.  You must know that it is a thick yet light nog, so drinking it is a bit different than a nog you'd buy in the store.  I agree that you could choose not to whip the cream at all and it probably would turn out closer to a store nog.  I added cinnamon and nutmeg directly into the cooked nog before adding the whipped cream.  About 1 tsp. each.  It gives it a nice flavor without being too powerful.  If you do cook the nog too long, like the previous review, get a strainer to take out any unwanted textures that form in the nog.  When you fold in the whipped cream it'll hide a slight over-cooking.  Again, it's a thick nog but not dense.  Consider not  using the egg whites when making this recipe.

I love egg nog and I have been wanting to try making it for years and I'm glad I found this recipe to begin with.   I did make it a bit differently.  As the others suggested, I did use a double boiler and it worked out great.   Also, I am not on a diet but I am trying to eat better, so I substituted the milk with some fat free half and half for 2/3 of the milk amount and then fat free condensed milk for 1/3 of the milk amount.  It makes the egg nog extremely creamy which is how I like it.  I also used the Splenda/sugar blend for the sugar amount listed in the recipe.  Even with the changes that I made to this recipe, it truly was the best egg nog I've ever had.  Prior to serving the egg  nog, however, I give a splash of ameretto and then garnish with just a little bit of nutmeg.  I skipped the mixing in of the whipping cream since it was already creamy enough and felt this was a step that was not necessary. I also believe, that without any changes that I made, the recipe will be one of the best egg nogs you've ever tasted.

Delicious! A nice, straight-forward recipe. 5 stars if it suggested an optional complimentary form of alcohol (this eggnog is good, but I prefer mine with a little kick.) Be CAREFUL when cooking the eggs,  I overdid it, then used cold water instead of an ice bath, so they were cooking just as fast as I could strain them out of the pan. The result wasn't half bad, though; a sort of thin flan. I'd try it again!

The direction to cook until "coats a metal spoon" was a little ambigious.  Mine ended up overcooking & becoming more of a pudding consistency, with bits of solid (like tapioca).  I added cinnamon & nutmeg before folding in the whipped cream.  We ate it like pudding & the flavor was still decent, but I think it could use more- like rum extract maybe?  But seeing as how temperamental it was for me, I won't make it again.

My 17 year old son loves eggnog and he made this one weekend.  We love it!  It's so much fresher and cleaner tasting than that bought stuff.  He made it exactly according to the recipe.  I had read the comments and instead of whipping the cream to stiffer peaks he decided to make them softer so it wouldn't be as thick.  He said that this was a perfect recipe.  Thanks for sharing it with us!  A definite keeper!  Now my son can have eggnog whenever he wants.  A note about the nutmeg:  we use the fresh whole nutmeg and grate it on each cup when it's served.  That's so much better than the ground.  You really need to get a whole nutmeg and keep it around for your recipes, they'll taste a whole lot better for it.

Guests didn't care for this very much.  Folding in the whip cream at the end was very strange.  It didn't look appetizing and tasted way too sweet and thick.  Perhaps I did something wrong but I followed the recipe exactly.  I will not make this again and will keep looking for another eggnog recipe.

I agree with the previous reviewers who said that this eggnog is just too thick.  If I make again, I will cut the whipping cream or substitute it with something else.

i loved this recipe. though i would recomend that after you chill it that you mix in about a half tablespoon of nutmeg. otherwise it tastes completely normal. it was just like what you buy at the store.

Made as written minus the whipped topping and this was pretty good. Next time I will reduce the eggs because it was pretty eggy. What I liked most about this recipe is that you could serve it as is for people who don't like or can't have the alcohol yet it was thick enough to serve the alcohol on the side for those who wanted to add it.

Great recipe and was delicious. Hit a rough spot and got it a little thicker than desired (eggs started to turn into scrambled eggs) but I picked up a few things that I think will make it even better next time.

Perfect eggnog recipe! Easy to make. 
Played around with the whipcream amounts for thickness, and a bit more milk to reduce the 'egginess'. Oh and added a touch of whiskey while serving for those who needed that extra kick. Fantastic!

I am happy to see such rave reviews for any recipe...  don't turn your back on this one...  it will turn to eggnog pudding in a flash...  My guest liked it in a bowl chilled with whipped cream...  I personally was looking forward to eggnog  :)

loved it! 
I added some cocoa (about a table spoon) and it just made it perfect.
rock on!
