DELICIOUS and easy meal!  My husband usually has three bowls full, and even my picky toddler and 6 year old will eat it.  Definitely follow the "Fast Chicken Soup Base" recipe and use that, makes it so much more flavorful than plain old canned broth.  In addition to parsley I use thyme, and depending on what's in my pantry/fridge I replace the white rice with wild rice or fine egg noodles, add parsnips and celery, eliminate the peas (not a fan).  And I simmer it much longer than the 10-20 minutes recommended, more like 2 hours.  Serve with a salad and nice crusty bread or rolls, and you have yourself a super meal!!!!

I just boiled my own whole chicken instead of buying a roasted one at the supermarket.  That might make a difference in the flavor.  I don't know.  I used the chicken broth after I boiled the chicken and then strained it and added 3 more cans of canned chicken broth.   Make sure you use dried thyme leaves and not ground thyme like I did.   I have thyme growing in my flowerbeds, I should have added that instead (oh well).  I also added a little tarragon.  My boyfriend liked it.  I liked it to although we'll be eating chicken soup for days.

Hi, I have a couple questions, being that I am a very inexperienced cook. First, do you add the rice cooked or uncooked? And, do you simmer with the lid on or off? Responses are greatly appreciated! Thank you!

This is a keeper!!  I didn't want to go to the store so I made alternates.  I used 5 1/2 chicken breasts, which I boiled, and kept the chicken broth from it.  I added a couple of Tablespoons of Chicken Boullion to the broth.  And I used 3 quarts of broth, instead of 2 quarts of broth and 1 qt. of water.  I had left over spanish rice, so I used 3 cups.  And last but least, instead of peas, I used green beans.  It's a winter dish, and yummy.

Made the soup base suggested.  Added two small bay leaves, left out the peas, and ended up having to add an additional carton of chicken broth.  Had been craving chicken and rice soup all week and this was perfect!!

This is the easiest soup to make and is SO GOOD!  We have made with rice and with orzo pasta.  Both ways are really good.  I love the Fast Soup Base!

Excellent recipe. Delicious, quick and easy. Most of the time is spent simmering the broth and soup. Perfect for a cold winter meal!

This is a great recipe, the only thing is it needed a little more broth after the rice cooked down.  Other than that It was delicious

I followed the recipe exactly, and it was easy to make.  It will be a favorite in my house for a very long time.  (This recipe brought me as close to a compliment from my daughter than I have ever been!)

Classic Chicken Soup doesn't include peas to me, so I didn't use them. But with the "fast chicken soup base" it makes a perfect classic chicken soup. I did add extra chicken broth and probably had more chicken than it called for, but I ended up with about 10-12 servings. This brought back memories when my mom would make chicken soup...so delicious and cozy!

to elaine: the chicken is in the Fast Chicken Soup Base recipe! Make that, then add this recipe. This is wonderful stuff. I use less onions that called for in the base.

I used the Fast Chicken Base with some meaningful changes:Great Base Recipe...several changes I made:
1)Used bones with meat only-No skins..less fat-doesn't need it for flavor
2) NO WATER-much better flavor without
3) Added 2 extra carrots(halved then chopped) and Sauteed ALL vegetables starting with onions,5', then added carrots and celery, stirring on low-mid heat 15 minutes..this roasts the veggies and adds amazing flavor..I also added the thyme in the beginning.
4) Add Pacific Chicken Stock, boil, add bones, boil then LOW simmer,mostly covered 30'.
5) Strain and discard everything but broth.
Go to Chicken with rice recipe....

For the Soup:
1) Added 1 cup short grain organic brown rice to broth and cook covered on lowest setting 35-40 minutes...till almost done...add 3 chopped carrots(split lengthwise and chop, thinner as you get to the fatter end) and 1 stalk chopped celery. Add carrots and celery with 20' to go on rice
2) Cut skinned de-boned chicken(from making the stock) into 1" pieces, and add along with 1 cup of frozen peas to the base...bring to simmer, cover, turn off heat and set aside 15'...this prevents the chicken from overcooking. While waiting, toast a sliced Ciabatta roll drizzled with olive oil at 375 until lightly browned. I do not add any parsley or pepper. Skim to remove any surface oil and "scum"..nasty word but the stuff floating on top, basically. Enjoy!!

This is a simple and delicious recipe yet I managed too make one big mistake. While making a double recipe of the soup base I added too much Thyme. What I did (after straining out all the thyme I could) was add 4 large potatoes and 1 extra cup of rice. The result was more of a stew than a soup but it tasted wonderful!

I used the fast chicken soup base with this recipe and shared bowls of soup with two other friends.  One of them called me the next day and said she really liked it.  I could not wait to have my leftovers the next day.  Great if you are feeling a little under the weather.

This recipe has yet to let me down. Love the flavor the roast chicken gives the entire soup. For the people that are wondering about “where’s the chicken” if you read the description of the recipe it refers to the quick soup base recipe which this recipe originated from. The quick soup base recipe has the chicken in and all you have to do is throw rice or noodles. Either way both are delicious. This is my go to soup recipe on a chilly winter day. The whole family loves it! Especially the next day after the flavors really set in. I follow recipe exactly (except for the peas)

I always have my Fast chicken broth base at the ready in my freezer. I leave the chicken out until I make the soup, though. My chicken rice soup has the Mediterranean flavors I grew up with. As I bring broth to a boil, two sticks of cinnamon are added. After chicken is added and the rice, I add the salt, pepper, 1/2 tsp. Cinnamon and juice of one lemon. If I've made a double batch, and will be storing leftovers, I cook the rice separately and add upon serving to prevent the rice from bloating up.  Using converted rice helps (Uncle Bens).  Peas if desired, added last few minutes. Adjust salt and pepper before serving, and squirt a bit more lemon juice if desired.

I had a chicken carcass left over from dinner last night, and a bunch of white rice left over from the night before that...so chicken & rice soup for dinner today. I simmered my chicken carcass with some diced onions for 4 hours then removed the bones and picked off all the meat, returning it to the pot. I added a bit of broth to fill the pot more, then the peas, parsley, and some freshly sliced carrots. Lots of salt & pepper, and voila! Thanks for a great base recipe.

made it many times and gets better each time.  instead of  the water I add an extra quart of chick stock.  I also use ground thyme but a little less than half of what the recipe calls for.  ground thyme is very strong, so be careful adding it, be sure to 1/2 it and knock a little bit more off the measuring spoon.  I also add a little bit more rice than called for, but I use regular white rice and not the long grain (that is because I have a lot of white rice, not necessarly because it is better).  Receipe is fantastic!! :)
