This kugel was incredible!!!!
Let me start off by saying, I doubled the recipe before I even tried it after reading the reviews.  After having used my flat bakeware for other recipes, I had to bake it in a souffle baker - ok, so it would be a bit tall.
When preparing the recipe, I beat the eggs in the mixer and made them super fluffy.  After soaking the matzoh, and following the directions to the letter (except I added extra raisins...mmmm, and used marg. instead of butter to serve with meat) , I ended up putting what looked like soup into the oven (I was a bit concerned at this point).

Let me tell you.... I had to bake this a bit longer than the recipe called for because of the height of my baker, but what came out of the oven was an incredible, delicious sweet, moist kugel like I have never had.  I make this twice and brought it to two seders, and EVERYONE raved!  We couldn't stop eating it!

I will be using this recipe all year round!!

Absolutely fantastic!.  My dh and dd loved it and asked for seconds.  I will need to make a double batch next time.  Husband usually complains when I put raisins into anything - but he loved this - and it was so simple to make.  The only change I made was to use margarine instead of butter so I could serve with a meat meal.

Thank you so much for this! I am doing my first Passover and just made this. I'm sorry I didn't double it. It's sooooooooooooooo good. I am running out now to get more raisins to make another batch! Happy Passover!

I served this with dinner for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, and it was a hit both times. I used golden raisins and the first time I soaked them in water as the farfel was soaking in the water and then egg, and the next time I soaked the raisins in sweet wine. It made them plumper.   Definitely don't lose heart when your mixture is liquidy. It firms up quite nicely once baked!  Next time I am adding chopped apple.

AMAZING.  I brought this to my parents' for Passover.  There were 20 people and everyone loved it.  It does have a lot of cholesterol, so I later experimented using only egg whites and smart balance spread... it still tastes great!!  Thanks for the amazing recipe!

Very tasty!  I've never had anything quite like this before and decided to try the recipe despite the fact that I've never even been to a Seder. ;)  My parents both thought it was great.  Will be making it again! =D

here's how to make it 5+ stars IMHO: 1. Use Whole Wheat farfel. 2. Use golden raisins at 1.5C. 3. Use sea salt. 4. Instead of 2C white sugar, use 1.5 C Lgt Brown plus 1/3 C honey. 4. Use Vietnamese/Saigon Cinnamon (well worth the extra cost in this blandish recipe). 5. butter needs to be unsalted and softened. 6. Add 3-4 peeled and slivered Granny Smith apples. 7. May take a bit longer to cook, so loosely foil to cover if getting too brown. 8. Let rest 30 minutes to solidify before cutting

My favorite passover recipe! I add dried cherries and pecans which become delicious when cooked. I think adding any dried fruit (cranberries, apricots) would be delicious.

I'm not Jewish, and haven't made/eaten enough kugels to compare to this one, but I have Jewish family members, and we all LOVE this dish. I can never find farfel at my grocery store, so I just use a rolling pin to crush up sheets of matzoh and that works perfectly. Tastes even better the second day, so make it ahead of time.

Great for Passover. I double recipe & put in two 8" x 8" pans. I use only 3/4 cup sugar per single recipe. I use golden raisins soaked in hot water to plump up. I beat eggs in mixer to aerate. For easy removal, I grease pan & line with parchment paper, which is also greased. Make ahead as it tastes better the next day. Thanks NIBLETS!

It's good. I doubled the recipe. When it just came out of the over, the whole thing was so big, which scared me. But as it cooled, it went back and fit in the dish again :) Tasted good, but very different...

Wonderful! I couldn't find matzo farfel at our store, so I substituted egg noodles, and the recipe was still delicious. Will definitely use again next year (hopefully with farfel)!

I made this last night to have for Passover and followed the recipe exactly as stated.  It looked so good right out of the oven that I had to give it a try. Wow-such a yummy and easy Passover treat.  We will be having this for breakfast!  This recipe is a keeper and I am going to experiment with it as well!  Thank you.

This was a great passover dessert... I actually made with Splenda (so everyone could eat it), so it would probably be sweeter if actual sugar was used... but it was pretty good! I will make again next year!  Ooh, and it taste even better after a day in the fridge!

I made a double recipe.  I quartered the sugar (1/2 cup for a double recipe), and I didn't let the matzah soak as long.  I didn't have margarine or butter, so I used Safflower oil.  It came out great.  It is super easy.

Yummy Passover food does exist!  I would definitely recommend doubling the recipe (using TWELVE eggs!).  After all, you have that huge box of farfel you're never going to use anyways.  Otherwise, I didn't change the recipe.  Served it at our seder.

Made this kugel for the second time for Passover. I doubled the recipe except for the sugar. I used a  1 1/2 cups brown sugar because I prefer brown  in this type of recipe.  Just a little richer flavor and the kugel is still very sweet. I also soaked the farfel in apple juice for a short time as suggested by another reviewer. This kugel is delicious. Rave reviews from my Seder table.  I happen to be eating a square for breakfast right now. This a winning recipe. I'm sure you could sub in almost any dried fruit.
