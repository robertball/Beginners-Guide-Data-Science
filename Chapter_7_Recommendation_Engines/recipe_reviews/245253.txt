I made this for dinner last night, though I ended up deviating from the recipe quite a bit. I used egg roll wraps because my local grocery store was out of wonton wraps.  I fried them in a skillet with some olive oil to achieve that nice blistery crunch that isn't obtainable by baking. The recipe suggests frying them for 1 minute per side, but that just burns them to a crisp. I would say 20 seconds per side is plenty. Two tablespoons of sesame oil for the ground chicken was too much. That is all you will taste. I modified it to two teaspoons and it was perfect. I also added some ground ginger and white pepper for extra flavor. The cole slaw mixture as written is a mess! I'd say half the vinegar and take out the teriyaki completely. Our cole slaw was very soupy and honestly not really tangy at all because the teriyaki really overpowers everything else.  This recipe was okay, but it needed some modifying to get there.

This is a great recipe with some tweaking.
I followed the instructions that Kankan669 mentioned, I cut the teriyaki from the slaw and used half the vinegar and the slaw was PERFECT! My husband even loved it and he doesn't like slaw.

We only used 2 teaspoons of the seasame oil and that was plenty, and added a hair more stir fry sauce. 

I really wanted to bake the wontons so I sprayed the back of a muffin tin with a coconut oil spray, layed out the wontons as "tacos" and then sprayed the shells one more time before baking them, that gave them the nice golden crispness without the frying (it might take a bit longer than the 4-5 min, just watch them).

Otherwise you'll love this recipe. 3 tacos is equivalent to 272 calories. (small portions but a tasty "treat" if you still want to have a healthy small meal.)

Enjoy!!

This is a great recipe. My wife and I love the chicken wonton tacos at applebees and this is the closest to it. I added some Sriracha hot chili sauce to it after simmering the chicken, great flavor with a little kick.

Made this for my hubby since he absolutely LOVES Applebee's version.  Too much vinegar in slaw, would recommend white cabbage and 1/2 the red wine vinegar. Also, the chicken was good but needed more stir-fry sauce. Definite tips for next time! It was pretty good :)

This is incredible but I did make some changes based on others reviews. 1/2 of the red wine vinegar in the coleslaw mix and I used the pre bagged mix with Marie's coleslaw dressing. I also used soft taco shells instead of  the wonton's as I was making this as the meal and wanted a larger wrap. I used General Tsao's  stir fry sauce and added some cayenne to add some heat. Yum! Can't wait to eat leftovers tomorrow. I know I shouldn't rate 5 stars since I made changes but I think this is an awesome place to start and make changes to personal taste.

Was good and easy to make. I bought a bag of rainbow slaw (carrots, broccoli, red cabbage) which made prep much easier.  Slaw sauce was too vinegary for my taste.  Also, while the wontons look fun as taco shapes, would have been easier to eat and fill if we put the wontons IN the muffins and made muffin shell shapes instead.  Will try again!

Followed the suggestion of other reviewers and it came out very well, but it's not an exact replica of Applebee's wonton tacos if that's what you are looking for. It's decent, something different. The coleslaw is, in my opinion, the best coleslaw recipe I've ever had. Very tart and sweet. will be making it for family gathering over the summer. 

Note: I did use tortilla shells when unable to find wonton wrappers

I made this recipe as stated with no alterations.  Very tasty. My husband noted that the vinegar in the slaw dressing could be reduced but he didn’t dislike it.

Next time I may try baking the wonton wrappers flat for more of a 'tostada'. My wontons would flip over while baking making it hard to fill the 'tacos'. 

Very tasty and a good for something different in the dinner routine. Served with ginger-soy glazed edamame, egg rolls and a salad.

The chicken  and the slaw were delicious but the won ton was bad, if you bake it it comes out  with no taste and really crispy.  I wet each wrap and put two together so they were more pliable and fried them in a little olive oil.  This seemed to help but no way near Applebee's.

Okay, this is a keeper recipe! I took other reviewers’ advice and omitted the teriyaki sauce. I used pre-shredded cabbage and just kept adding to match the amount of sauce... seemed like more sauce than the amount of cabbage called for. Everyone absolutely loved them. Crunchy, saucy, so flavourful. Oh and I also added sesame seeds.

These were fantastic. I failed at making the “taco” shape, so we just crumbled the wontons and created a salad. It was delicious. Tasted just like Applebee’s

I followed the recipe.
Did not care for it. 
Too much vinegar in the slaw. 
The red cabbage was not appealing to me for some reason. next time I'd use the regular white cabbage or even the Cole slaw mixture bag they have at the grocery store.
I used a little bit less sesame oil being that from experience with this and if you use too much it's overpowering in taste. 2TB is way too much. I'll try some of the other recommendations next time I make this.

I thought this was very good.  I only used 2 tsp of sesame oil and 1 Tbls of teriyaki because 2 Tbls of each would overpower the taste.  The slaw turned out fantastic.  I sprayed the wontons with canola spray and baked as suggested on the back side of a muffin tin.  Sounded like a great idea but they were way too hard and crunchy.   I ended up throwing them away and just used warm flour tortillas and guess what?  They ended up tasting pretty close to Applebee's Oriental Chicken roll-up!  Yummy.   I may try the fried version of the wontons next time.  Thank you for the recipe!

One word....AWESOME! Did NOT eliminate anything but did cut back approximately 1/2 of all liquid seasoning. Added some ginger because i like it ?? and fried the wrappers in a little OO. Also for convenience used a bag of cole slaw mix. Rave reviews from my house!!

Omitted the coleslaw dressing (mixed rice vinegar, soy sauce, and sesame oil instead) because I loathe mayo, but I'm sure would be 5 stars with it. Followed the rest of the recipe as written. Delicious!

I added sweet Asian chilli sauce, drizzled over the top and it was great.  I fried our wontons though.

Made this to tonight and really liked it! I would probably use less of the ‘sauce’ for the slaw mixture as it was a bit soupy but I thought the taste was great. I wish I had fresh cilantro and fresh lime which would really make this perfect! Definitely will

Only difference is that the shell is not fried. Loved it anyway!!
I used pre-made, store-bought slaw mix, (cabbage and shredded carrots)

Delish. My family wasn't too impressed but I liked the flavor and mingling of everything. They will not eat this next time, haha.
