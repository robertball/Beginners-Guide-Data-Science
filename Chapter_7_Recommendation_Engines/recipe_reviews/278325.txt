Oh my goodness so good!!! I made a second batch and left in for 6 minutes instead of 5 and was so much better! A little crunchier crust. I will defiantly make again and try some other toppings besides pepperoni. My photo is too big. Wont let me share.

It’s pretty darned good.  When you’re ketoIng or low carbing you’re often looking for new yummy stuff to replace those long time favorites.  These chaffels really do the trick!
