This was a great salad!  I loved making the croutons, I'd never done that before.  That being said, I used the Chilli Seasoning Mix II from this site and 2 T. of it made the croutons way to spicy.  Next time I'll only use 1 T. for the croutons.  I also used a combination of wheat bread and sourdough bread for the croutons. Last change I made was I used Italian Dressing and did not add any extra chili seasoning to that.  My family, especially my husband really liked it. Thank you!

This was very good.  I used Spicy Ranch instead of fat free ranch and it was amazing.

Delicious!! I used Italian Dressing beause that's what I had, and whole wheat bread for the croutons, and it was excellent. Instead of the package of Chili Seasoning I always have a jar of Taco Seasoning I (also from this site) so I used that instead. Will be making this often!!

Amazingly tasty. I did add Lime juice to the chicken as it was cooking and I cheated by just buying Spicy Ranch for the dressing.  Turned out good. next time I might try adding a little cilantro.

This is a great salad! Everyone loved the croutons and there were no leftovers.  I made it without the cheese and nothing was missing.  I used a pre-seasoned can of black beans too.  I added some of the chili seasoning to the ranch dressing to make it even more southwestern.  Definitely making this one again!

Excellent recipe. I have a salad picky eater - my son - can't please him with any salad...but this one did. Had a tough time with the croutons as the chili powder soaked up all the olive oil - I didn't have the full 2 Tbsp of oil so that was surely the problem - make sure you use the full 2 Tbsp for the croutons. :) Great job on the recipe - we will use this one agin and again!
