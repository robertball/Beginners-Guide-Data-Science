This is 3 stars if you make it as written, which I did.  But it was very hard to spread, even on a 9 x 13 sheet cake. I couldn't even imagine trying to frost a layer cake with it like this.  So, I decided to chalk that cake up to experience and made another.  This time I used a heaping cup of Jif peanut butter (probably around 1 1/4 cups), 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar and 3 T of heavy cream.  I beat the room temperature butter and the room temperature peanut butter for several minutes until I could not see any butter at all in the mixture and it seemed very creamy.  Then I gradually added the powdered sugar and when it was well-blended, I added the 3 T of heavy cream and then put it on #6 on my KitchenAid mixer and let it go for 3-4 minutes.  This time it was MUCH easier to spread and tastes great!!

DELICIOUS! This recipe deserves nothing less than 5 stars.  Naturally you wouldn't expect any kind of peanut butter frosting to spread as pretty as butter cream and still taste like peanut butter, this is "peanut butter" we're talking about after all. My cake tasted fabulous and looked fabulous. It is not anything like a paste, if you follow the recipe correctly, and add milk "as needed" like it says and whip it long enough, its perfect. Major pet peeve....someone leaving a review when clearly they did not follow the recipe like it is written, how can you review this recipe if you didn't follow it? This went in my GOLDEN RECIPE BOOK. Frosted brownies with it, oh la la, Loved it!!

Very easy and nice. However, in order to get a good consistency, all ingredients should be at room temperature. If they get too grainy and hard after u added in 3 tablespoons milk, stop adding. Instead, put ur bowl into microwave on high for 30 sec, take out and stir. This will solve the problem. Great frosting. Very peanut buttery!

This frosting is amazing--it balances flavor against sweetness well, and the texture was perfect:  creamy, fluffy, not oily at all.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY as written, no alterations necessary.  I made sure my butter was softened (not just room temperature) and I used Jiff's Creamy PB with No Added Sugar;  the two whipped together beautifully in about a minute (and I just own a bottom-barrel Black & Decker hand-held mixer);  then I added the powdered sugar a half-cup at a time, whipping as I went;  I made sure to add in 1 Tbl milk between each sugar-addition so that I could judge moisture-spreadability ratio.  It kept wonderfully fluffy and spreadable for the hour and a half that I used it, then put the remainder in the fridge.  It does harden in the fridge, but gently microwaving it with a tablespoon or two or milk and then stirring returns it to its original malleability.  I liked this recipe so well, I made an additional batch substituting Nutella for the peanut butter--it tasted incredible!

i've made this several times and everyone loves it on brownies but i can never get it to be "fluffy" even though i follow the recipe and beat it for awhile...and it's usually rather greasy. any suggestions to get it to look like the picture shows?

Make sure you use butter rather than margarine. I've used margarine before and the icing comes out kind of greasy. Butter will give you beautiful, fluffy icing. Also, I add 2 tsp of vanilla when I make this.

Great multi-purpose frosting.  Worked well for piping too.  Had some left over, chilled it rolled it into balls and dipped in melted chocolate.  You have to keep them in the fridge but they are incredible.

My sister found a box of chocolate cake mix in Mom's pantry today...and decided she needed cupcakes right then!  Of course, she didn't look for frosting when she found the cake mix...so we tried this recipe.  Holy cow is it good!  And so easy!  It made a lot of frosting though...too much for a batch of cupcakes.  So, I'll have to make brownies later this week!  Yummy!

Oh my gosh, as I sit here licking the spatula and swiping my finger into the almost empty bowl, thank you, thank you, thank you for this great recipe.  I had no problems spreading the icing or mixing it.  Other than making half a recipe, which frosted my 13x9 gob cake perfectly, I made it exactly as written. Thanks again!

HORRIBLE experience!!! The stuff tastes ok, but what on Earth is the standard for "creamy" and "spreadable???"  Not this recipe, folks.  I have made frosting for years, but never came up with such an unspreadable mess, after following recipe exactly and using my Kitchen Aide to try to whip up this thick gooey concrete.  Makes a really awful presentation.  Guests were family members, and they all had a laugh at the look of the cake, but, in consolation, it did taste ok.  Never again.

I also give 3 stars for this recipe "as is." I took another reviewer's advice and used 1.25 cups peanut butter (Jif), 1.5 cups of powdered sugar; however, I didn't have cream at home, so I used 2 tbsp 2% milk (lactose free), and it turned out beautifully! I creamed the peanut butter & room temperature butter then added the powdered sugar 1/2 cup at a time, and adding the milk 1 tbsp at at time at the end. It spread very easily on my 9x13 devil's food cake and tasted delicious! Made this way, my family and I give it 5 stars!!!

I made this to put on a chocolate cake, and I might as well have spread the peanut butter on it out of the jar.  I found a different recipe that only uses 3 tablespoons of peanut butter,(butter, conf. sugar) and adds vanilla...Wow what a difference!

This is a nice, simple, peanut butter frosting. It's not sickeningly sweet, which I really appreciate. I recommend using heavy cream instead of milk as it makes the frosting creamier and richer. For best results be sure your butter isn't melty or super soft and beat until it's light in color and very fluffy.

The flavor of this frosting was delicious. However, it was difficult to spread and even more difficult to pipe. I tried adding more milk but the frosting "broke" into a greasy mess with a crumbly texture. I tried adding more sugar and peanut butter to fix it but it didn't work. How disappointing!

I see how this could be an awesome frosting...and its my fault it did not turn out right. I did not have any butter left in the house, so I used country crock butter spread instead. DO NOT USE IT. It is in no way a butter substitute other than to use on bread. I knew this from past experience, but i decided to try again anyways since its a frosting not a cookie recipie (country crock does not work for cookies either) what I ended up with was a chunky, liquidy peanut butter spread. Not wanting to just put it in the all in the trash, I put the glob in the fridge and that helped a bit. The flavor was there-the frosting consistency was not. So this a warning to those of you like me who try to just use whats in the house-don't. I will be trying this again with butter and I'm sure it will be just as great as the other reviews say.

This is the easiest frosting recipe I have ever made and it is definitely one of the tastiest!! One note is that I did not have to use all 3 tablespoons of milk and only used 1 as the frosting did not get too thick for my liking.  

I was a true cynic about using peanut butter in anything but a sandwich or on a cracker.  I offered to make a birthday cake for a friend and she said she loved peanut butter and chocolate - so I had a task!  I made this icing three days ahead of time expecting some sort of disaster and recovery effort, but it is wonderful!!  I could not stop test-tasting it! Now I have a wonderful alternative to regular buttercream!

Wow!  I am IN LOVE!  Since I am a peanut butter freak and love all things peanut butter, I went in search of a peanut butter frosting recipe to frost my delicious Texas Sheath Cake I was going to bake.  I didn't want an icing kind of thing, I wanted a nice fluffy, totally peanut butter tasting frosting and I am so glad I found this!  I looked at several different recipes before deciding this one looked more to my liking.  I am not a fan of sickening sweet frosting and usually no matter what recipe I use, I never put in the full amount of powdered sugar.  Even with this recipe, I didn't use the full amount.  But here's the kicker.  I only had Laura Scudder's Natural Peanut Butter, the kind you have to stir because it separates.  Not caring if it came out more dense, I went ahead and used it and my frosting came out fluffy and delicious!  I'm wondering if the people who complained about the frosting being greasy only mixed the ingredients together.  I used my old hand held beaters and put it on high and whipped the heck out of.  As soon as I poured the cream into it (I used cream instead of milk), it started to look more fluffy.  I rough guessed at the amount of cream I put in and then started adding the powdered sugar.  It just beat up so nicely and as soon as it was sweet enough for me, I stopped whipping it and frosted my cake.  I thoroughly enjoyed licking off the beaters and cleaning out the remnants of the bowl.  Addicting, delicious and I'll be making this forever more.

Wow! This is a Very good frosting. It tastes just like Reeses Peanut Butter Cups. It's pretty easy to whip up, very creamy and fluffy. Pipes easily onto cupcakes with no problems and stays fluffed up. I used Adam's Creamy Peanut Butter as well as Skippy's Creamy Peanut Butter interchangably and frosted on, "Too Much Chocolate Cake," and " Brownie Batter+Cupcake=The SECOND BEST Cupcake. Ever," recipes also on this website.

This frosting did not work for me at all. It was very greasy and didn't fluff up. I followed the directions exactly and didn't make any alterations. Don't know what happened, but I won't be making this again.

This recipe did not work well for me at all. I too found it greasy. So much so it practically slid off my cupcakes.  I never could get it to set-up correctly and yes I followed the recipe exactly as recommended by other posters.  I will not make this one again.  sorry

So yummy! Who needs a cupcake when you have a spoon! I added just a tad more powdered sugar so it was thick enough to pipe and hold its shape. Fabulous on dark chocolate cupcakes. Thanks!

Excellent recipe. Simple and the finished product is divine. The peanut butter flavor is just right... not too strong, but definitely there. I used this to frost Brownie Batter + Cupcake = The SECOND BEST Cupcake. Ever from this site. Great combination. Thanks! :)

I took the advice of Cyndie Schneider and this recipe still didn't work. It tastes like a overly sugary failed attempt at frosting. It would be cheaper to buy frosting (and it would taste better!).

This is a good PB frosting.  I added more PB to give it a stronger PB taste, thus making it less "fluffy", but still pipe-able and yummy.  It goes great on chocolate cupcakes!

My best friend does not like buttercream - but adores peanut butter.  I found this for his birthday many years ago and it was a hit! 
This icing has been a HUGE hit at my office: I am the "cupcake lady" and this icing is my top request, especially with chocolate-fudge cupcakes. 
Fluffy, wonderful flavor, not overly sweet.  
I owned a cake business many years ago - so I will tell you it is a bit thick to spread by hand, you really need to use a pastry bag with a large tip.  If you really want to spread it, add another Tablespoon of milk. 
I *only* use whole milk in my icings because the flavor and texture whole milk adds does make a difference.  
Also, my butter is always room temperature, as is the milk. 
The temperature of the dairy will impact the creaminess and pipe-ability/spread-ability of the icing.

For all things good and Holy, you must make this!  It's so creamy and delicious.  I had no trouble at all spreading/piping mine.  The trick is to get it to the consistency that is right for you... remember, the recipes are adaptable!  This is KILLER.  Thanks for sharing!

This frosting was about as fluffly as a tube of playdough. I followed the recipe exactly. I had to make 2 batches just to frost a 2 layer 9in cake. I will find another recipe. Also, heating up the peanutbutter before using didn't make it any easier to spread.

This was delicious!I used it on a chocolate cake - my favorite is the one on the back of the Hershey's cocoa can. I put this between the layers and on top and then colored some green and made pine trees and added gummy bears for a pine forest. Beat this frosting for quite a while and you'll get fluffy peanut butter goodness!

Awesome recipe! Easy and tasty! I sifted the confectioners' sugar to help it mix easier and it turned out very creamy and fluffy. I also added 1/3 C cocoa and turned it into chocolate peanut butter frosting. I used it on chocolate cupcakes for a perfect flavor combo!

What a great frosting, I used this to frost chocolate chip cupcakes. I followed the recipe exactly, not sure why some reviewers said it was difficult to handle. The key is to give the first few ingredients a good mix, which made it so light and fluffy.  I'm sure I will use this the next time I need to give a cake a peanut butter kick.  Thank you for sharing.

I made this with all natural pb (Adams), and it came out out just fine. Not really sure why some others using the natural style might have had problems?? I made a 1/2 batch to frost an 11"x13" cake-like blondie recipe and was very enthusiastically gobbled up & enjoyed by everyone.  :)

Loved loved loved it!  The key is to not overbeat this, and to use a good peanut butter (like creamy Jiff).  I beat the butter and peanut butter until really creamy - probably a good 3-4 minutes in my Kitchen Aid with the paddle attachment.  Add the sugar and a little milk at a time, mixing well until nice and creamy.  If you over beat, it will start to separate and look "chunky".  Stop when it's still creamy, and you won't be disappointed.  I used this to top the Brownie Batter + Cupcake recipe (also from this site), and the combination of the two was out of this world!  Can't wait to use this one on plain brownies in the future!  Thanks for the recipe!

This frosting is divine! I probably used about 1 1/4 cup peanut butter and only used 1 1/2 cups sugar. I substituted heavy whipping cream instead of milk to truly make it fluffy! Used on PBJ Cupcakes from website.

I am not quite sure how others had a problem with "separation" and it being "greasy" or "too stiff" my 13 y.o daughter made this last night with no problems at all.  We did cut back on the sugar (I don't like sweet) and added more peanut butter (I love it!) And it came out great.

Excellent frosting - not too sweet.  Recipe works as written.  I added a teaspoon or two of vanilla.  I made sure to soften the butter and Jif Natural peanut butter and creamed them together.  I didn't measure the half-n-half, just added a bit at a time until I liked the consistency.  It spread beautifully.  If you like very generous frosting on your 9 x 13 cake, I would scale this recipe to 1-1/2 times (24 servings).

I have no clue how people are not getting perfectly fluffy frosting if directions are followed to a T.   I did not change a thing and i am so happy with the results.  Do NOT use margarine.  Margarine does not have the same consistency of butter and your frosting will not be as fluffy.  Also it says to add milk AS NEEDED.  I only needed about a tablespoon of the milk.  If you use real  butter and milk only as needed instead of the full 3T, than your frosting should turn out well. I made the too much chocolate cake from this site,  with homeade chocolate frosting and bordered the cake and wrote all over the cake with this PB frosting. It was the perfect combo.

Excellent Recipe.  For me this recipe was enough to generously frost 21 cupcakes.  I probably could have stretched it to do 24 if I didn't use so much on the first few I frosted.

I've tried making this twice now.  It ALWAYS comes out greasy and with a horrible texture, like play-dough flavored like peanut butter.  I've read the other reviews and tried adding cream to it, etc.  It's just a mess!  Oh, and don't try reduced fat peanut butter.   It's even worse.  Don't bother with this one.

I just got done frosting my husband's birthday cake with this. I have to make him a chocolate cake with peanut butter frosting every year as it's his fave. This was great...easy to use and my son said it was the best frosting ever. Thanks!

YUMMY!!! Thank you, thank you for a delicious frosting! It's SO easy and not too sweet...everyone loved it! The only thing different that I did was use a stick and a half of butter to make it more fluffy, and a little extra peanut butter...whipped it up good and piped it through a ziplock bag. I made chocolate cupcakes and scooped out a little of the middle and heated up some marshmallow fluff and piped it into the cupcake and put the frosting on top (I know, I'm a cow! I was PMSing and wanted to make it even more of a treat than it was ;o). My cupcakes looked just like the one in the picture! This frosting is a keeper...I plan to use it constantly! Oh, and to the poster that said it was "too peanutty".........DUH!!!! From the recipe did she think it was going to taste like strawberry?!?!?!?! LOL! Thanks again for a great frosting!!!!

I think it tastes great. I love it. I had no problems with consistancy, and I did use the all natural peanut butter. I will say though that my boyfriend did not care for peanut butter flavored frosting.

This was NOT what I was looking for.  My son wanted a chocolate cake with peanut butter icing for his birthday cake.  I used butter and followed the recipe to the tea!  The icing was greasy and would not spread on the cake. I ended up getting a grocery store cake for his birthday last minute.  Too bad, peanut butter and chocolate sounded sooo good!

Two stars...only for flavor!  I followed this recipe exactly, and it was not fluffy.  It was greasy, unspreadable, and not at all "pretty" on my cupcakes.  I had read reviews to mix it for a long time to get it fluffy...well, I used my KitchenAid for almost fifteen minutes and it still wasn't fluffy.  Any suggestions?

I used this wonderful frosting to frost the "Black Cholate Cake"  and It was sooooo good!  My husband was in chocolate and peanut butter bliss!  I followed the recipe exactly.  But only 4 stars because I found that it did not want to stick to the cooled cake.  But very good otherwise!

This is so light and fluffy. Not too sweet like alot of crossings. I put this on dark chocolate brownies and it was delicious. I'm a peanut butter lover and I can't say enough about this recipe. It's actually a 10 star recipe.

I think the difference between a broken greasy blob and a wonderfully fluffy frosting is twofold. 1) The proper ingredients at just the right temperature, and 2) a stand mixer vs a hand-held mixer. I used a stand mixer, Jif Natural peanut butter, and organic butter that was room temp. For a few brief seconds I saw 'fluffy' and then it turned 'lumpy and greasy'. I used it anyway as the filling for my cakes, since it tasted fine. Then I took the leftovers and stiffened them up by adding several tablespoons of cocoa powder and a bit of heavy cream. 

I would suggest using the cream instead of milk, since the water content of milk will tend to increase the risk of breaking. Likewise I would recommend using a handheld mixer to make the 'fluffy' stage a little easier to spot before it disappears. 

The cocoa-stiffened leftovers became writing icing, and I ended up frosting the cake with a chocolate buttercream. It all worked out in the end, but I did want to suggest not using the stand mixer for other folks who try this in the future. 

Personally, I found the peanut butter flavor a bit weaker than I wanted. The recipe definitely needs some salt to get back that 'reese's cup' type flavor. I probably won't end up using this one again because of that. Maybe a stronger flavored peanut butter would help.

I made this recipe written as-is the first time around.  It had great flavor but still not the texture/consistency I was looking for.  I needed something that wasn't overly sweet but that would still pipe rosettes beautifully around a bundt cake.  So the second time around I needed to double the recipe.  Here's what I used:  One 16-oz. jar of PB, 3 C. sifted powdered sugar, 9 Tbsp. of half and half, 1 stick of butter (1/2 C.), and 1/2 C. of shortening.  I first creamed the butter since it was firmer than the other ingredients.  Once the PB started to increase in volume and turn lighter, I slowly added in the shortening and PB.  Then, one half cup at a time, I slowly mixed in the sugar and a few Tbsp. of liquid at a time.  I wanted to try and get this smooth, but at the end it still has a lot of air in it, which is okay since I won't be smoothing it over a large area.  So I basically had to decrease the sugar amount by 1/2 C. and increase liquid by 2 Tbsp. if looking at the original recipe.  I also added in a cap of vanilla extract.  The best way to make an actual frosting is to use a standard butter cream recipe and just simply add in a 1/2 C. of PB.  The PB flavor isn't as strong and the frosting is sweet, but it will actually be a frosting you can smooth out and decorate.  But the flavor of this recipe is much better.  I would def. use it as a filling or frosting for chocolate cupcakes!

I can only guess that it doesn't work with natural peanut butter, mine was Adams brand.  All seemed fine when I mixed the butter and peanut butter and gradually added the sugar and milk.  When I turned the speed up on my Kitchenaid to beat it for 3 minutes, it separated and produced a white liquid.  I tried adding a bit more sugar to absorb the liquid, but it didn't help.  I beat it for several minutes more and the concoction seemed to be turning into some form of juicy concrete.  While it had a good flavor, I could think of no use for it.

WOW yum! Taste like a reese's! I used this recipe on chocolate cupcakes and they tasted great. When it was at room temperature it was about a 8 but after I refrigerated them the frosting taste and texture really shined through and the frosting was definitely a 10.

I made a review a few days ago, but I'm coming back, because I made this again.  I realized that only 2 TBSP of milk is sufficient, and that if you beat it for the recommended 3 minutes, that it's not as fluffy as the 1.5 minute mark.  I overbeat it again.  Next time I won't go as long.

I'm giving this recipe a 3 star due to the directions, because to me they seem a little off. I made this last night exactly how the recipe states and it was a disaster. After gradually adding the last cup of confectioners sugar the "frosting" seized, big time. After reading others suggestions I gave it another try today. I used the exact measurements of all ingredients, except I added the confectioners sugar about one tablespoon at a time. Once I got through the first cup of sugar I added the first tablespoon of milk. Once the last cup of sugar was in I added the other two tablespoons of milk. The frosting was too thick for my liking so I added about three more tablespoons of milk. Finally!! Iced my cake and now ready to eat. This frosting isn't overpowered by peanut butter, nor is it too sweet. I will admit, however, that it is a little difficult to ice the cake with this frosting. Overall, it's an ok recipe. I will use again if I don't find another that I like.

Note to self - do not make this recipe again.  However to be fair to the submitter I will give it  three stars.  After all, the majority of the 771 reviewers loved it.  My experience was - the mixture separated during the beating process, clogged my electric beaters putting a strain on my mixer, and the goop in the blades was like caramel.  Oh well, not the perfect fluffy frosting I was hoping for.

NOT being a master baker by any means, I carefully read the recipe and through many reviews. I followed it exactly. It was fantastic, if you are a peanut butter lover! I must say, I agree with us others, for those who felt the recipe wasn't up to par, were not following the directions. It is "FLUFFY" Peanut Butter Frosting, which means lots of whipping. I blended the butter, then the peanut butter with the butter, then added the sugar, etc... Just Like it states. This takes a few+ minutes. It came out wonderful, easy to spread, and best- tastes great! Excellent, easy recipe.

Tastes great. But, I have to wonder if I'm the only one that did not get fluffy frosting after mixing for a few minutes. Within a few seconds of mixing, the frosting was very fluffy and smooth but I kept mixing since the directions said to mix for at least 3 minutes. Doing this, I ended up with thick, dense, crumbles...even after adding more milk. So, I made a second batch and stopped mixing once all the ingredients were well blended and it came out perfect.

If you like peanut butter you will love this frosting. Easy to make and what flavor. I put it on the "Brownie Batter & Cupcake=The Second Best Cupcake. Ever" recipe from this site. It is fantastic on them.

I also made this recipe and it flopped the first time.  It was very oily and thick, almost like fudge before it hardens.  I re-made the recipe, this time using butter instead of margarine.  (The recipe calls for butter, but I substitued margarine the first time.)  With real butter, the recipe turned out awesome!

I don't know what happened, but my icing would not become fluffy or blend well at all, it just stayed lumpy. I tried microwaving it as another suggested, but didn't work for me. The only things I can think of that I did a bit differently were that I halved the recipe (as someone else did with success) and used natural creamy peanut butter instead of Kraft because I do not like to eat hydrogenated oils/trans fat.  The "icing" would not spread and only tasted okay. Wasted high quality icing sugar on this :(   Just wanted to warn others who use natural peanut butter that it might not work!

I thought this recipe was fantastic!  I followed the recipe (almost) exactly, starting with butter that had been left at room temperature for a few hours.  Once softened, I beat it in a bowl with a hand mixer until whipped.  (this doesn't take long!)  Then I added the peanut butter and whipped again.  I followed with the sugar mixed by hand a little and at that point, added a little milk. (I didn't measure it, but I would guess a tablespoon or 2.)  I mixed together on low speed with my hand mixer and it was perfect!!  The consistancy and the taste was great!!  I would definitely make again.

Very peanutty, but sure not sweet enough. The other recipe on this site has a much better ratio of sugar to peanut butter in my opinion (and my mom's).

This was a really great recipe, I made it just as described but I think I need one more tablespoon of milk. I poured it over a bundt cake so I heated a bowl of the icing in the microwave for 15-20 seconds and then   poured it over the bundt, it looked and tasted fabulous.

By far THE BEST peanut butter frosting I have had!!! Came out very fluffy, not too peanut buttery but had enough flavor, sweet but not too sweet (if you like sickening sweet frostings you wont like this one) and NOT greasy which most peanut butter frostings tend to be. AWESOME!!! Will be using this recipe for my peanut butter frosting from now on. (Great with Dark Chocolate Cake I from this site!!!)

didn't like the flavor with 2 cups 10x- added another cup and it turned out much better.  I used margarine and it was fine.

YUM! My brownies were in the oven (Best Brownies Recipe from hall of fame section) and I got this brilliant idea to add peanut butter frosting on it. So I hurriedly looked thru this site and found this recipe. I made very little (cutting the ingredients by 1/2) cuz I didn't know how it was going to turn out and BOY DO I REGRET IT! IT is THE BEST Frosting EVER! I'm anxiously waiting for the brownies to cool so I can lather on the frosting and take a huge bite. I'm making these for a potluck tomorrow but I doubt any will last by then. This gets 5 YUMS!

YUM!  I wanted a dessert in a pinch so I made this to go on top of a quick chocolate cake recipe I found on this site.  The cake is still in the oven, but I just finished preparing this icing to top it, and it's really good!  It has a better consistancy than store bought icing, but I prefer just a bit more of a peanut butter taste.  I'll adjust it for the next time I make this.  Groovy!

This is fabulous! I used it to frost heart shaped brownies for my husband for Valentine's day, and it made a LOT. It was thick, but all you have to do is add a touch of milk and keep mixing until it's the consistency that you want. I had so much I also put it on top of Chocolate Mousse that I made, and still have some left over. I would suggest don't add any milk until it gets too thick to mix, and then add a tiny bit at a time until it's just right for you. I highly recommend it!

Well, here's my new official peanut butter frosting recipe.  It's so light, flavorful, yet not overpowering.  I've tried it on both brownies and chocolate cake with wonderful results.  I whipped this up an my KitchenAid and it was perfection!

I watched the video and followed the hint about allowing the butter and milk to reach room temperature, then followed the rest of the directions as written. (For the record, I used Jif peanut butter.) I needed a bit more than 3 tablespoons of milk to get the spreadable consistency. It turned out very fluffy and was probably the easiest icing I have ever spread on a cake. I had more than enough for a 9 x 13 chocolate cake. This would be great in whoopie pies. Delicious!

Absolutely loved it. The directions are clear, and the outcome was a fantastic smooth, creamy, perfect peanut butter frosting. There is no doubt I will make this frosting again. Just remember, if you need a looser consistency, add a bit more milk and beat it well. The recipe was a bit thick, as is expected of peanut butter, but with a little bit of milk it becomes perfectly pliable! Love, love, love this!!!

Wonderful! Great taste not overpowered by the peanut butter. 

Also be ready to use more than 3 tbs milk its really thick and needs to be thinned.

This is a good recipe.  Only gave it 4 stars as I found that the peanut butter flavour not as strong as a I wanted.  When mixing I used the whip attachment to the mixture and had the speed on high for 2 minutes, dropped it to 1 added one cup of icing sugar than milk and last cup then last of milk then 1 drop of vanilla extra.  Was easy to spread on the cake/ Will do again but will cut the butter in 1/2 and increase peanut butter to 1 1/2 cups.

Absolutely perfect! This was my first attempt ever at making frosting and I was so nervous about how it would turn out but you really can't go wrong with this recipe. I had marinated a German chocolate cake overnight in sweetened condensed milk and I didn't want the frosting to be too overwhelmingly sweet so the only change I made to this recipe was to cut the sugar in half. I added toffee bits and a caramel drizzle to top off the cake and ended up with the perfect marriage of sweet and salty flavors. The frosting was so fluffy and easy to spread and even after sitting outside in the heat all night at a cookout, the cake still looked amazing. I had no problems whatsoever with greasiness, separation, or texture. Everything whipped up nicely with my little Cuisinart hand mixer and the frosting had a lovely creamy consistency along with a beautiful presentation. Everyone raved about how delicious the cake was and several people even asked for the frosting recipe. I will most definitely use this delicious recipe again and again!

This is pretty good. It's fast and easy but it doesn't have the smoothest texture. There's another recipe I tried that adds cream cheese and I liked that one a bit better. I would make is again to use on brownies or as a sandwich cookie filling. Maybe between two banana cookies or something? Mmmm

AMAZING!!! Best peanut butter frosting I've ever had! So easy to make and it spread just like store bought frosting - but tastes 100x better. I'm not sure how long I beat it, I used my kitchen aid and mixed it on high until it was fluffy after adding the sugar and before adding the milk, then I added a couple tbsp of milk to make it smoother.

The taste of this frosting is good.
However, it's difficult to spread and looks awful.

My first time making my own frosting, and it turned out soooo good. I doubled the recipe, and while I was mixing in the sugar, I tasted it and it tasted sweet enough, so I didn't add the last cup of sugar that it called for. It turned out fluffy and DELICIOUS! Mouthwatering. I made chocolate cupcakes and iced them with this frosting, and added mini reece peanut butter cups! Will definitely be making this again.

Just made this for my fiances' birthday cake. I tried it during the creation and thought it was DELICIOUS. For two 8" round cakes I used made 8 servings worth of the icing and I had a small amount leftover for cake pops so that was perfect! I also mixed the milk and confectioners sugar together first, then the butter, and then the peanut butter and it was really fluffy! I think this would be awesome on brownies!

This is a really good peanut butter frosting. It came out perfect the first time I made it. I did not have to add more milk. It's the right consistency for piping and decorating.

How great is this frosting?  I made some brownies and wanted a peanut butter frosting to top it off.  Found this recipe, and -- wham -- in no time at all the brownies had a frosting.  Seriously, making this took no time at all.  I didn't need to use the milk, and I thought it tasted delicious after about half the sugar.  It was so great like that, I nixed adding the milk or additional sugar.  Perhaps it was because the peanut butter I had contained honey.  Whatever.  This recipe is the best!  Much better than store bought stuff.  Thank you for posting this.  What a fine find!

The frosting was delicious.  I put it into a pastry bag and frosted chocolate cupcakes with it so I can't comment on its spreadability but the flavor was amazing, light fluffy and almost every cupcake was gone.  I ended up using a little less than 3 tablespoons milk.  The frosting was not greasy at all.  I will definitely make this again and again.

This recipe is super easy and very delicious. If it comes out too thick, just add a little more milk, but I've used this three times in the past month by exactly following the recipe and it has been perfect every time. It's peanut butter icing, it's not going to be smooth like buttercream.

Epic. Fail. Maybe my butter was *too* soft, maybe it was the off-brand peanut butter, maybe it was the fat-free milk, I don't know. But the more I beat it, the more it separated. I ended up with a thick peanut butter mass in a milky mess. Looked like oatmeal. Hubby got the bright idea of heating it in the microwave, which accomplished nothing but separating the oil out of it as well. It did reconstitute overnight, and now I'm trying to figure out how to salvage this mess. Complete waste of time and money!

I never really use a recipe for frosting, and my vanilla/chocolate/cream cheese buttercream frostings always come out awesome.  I've tried making PB frosting in the past and it always comes out heavy and gummy and gross.  Then I broke down and sought out a recipe and I'm so glad I found this one!  It's delicious! I followed it exactly and it was deliciously peanut buttery (not overly so, though) and nice and fluffy.  5 stars for sure!

Do NOT make this frosting with ALL NATURAL peanut butter!!  That's the only kind we eat so didn't have any other ones such as peaterpan or skippy etc...  The frosting got separated and never became frosting even though I kept beating....  Then I tried to heat it up a little hoping that would help but it didn't....  I'll definitely try to make it with a different kind of peanut butter next time.  Here is my update. The 2nd time, I made it with BUTTER and Peaterpan peanut butter.  It turned out pretty good.  DO NOT use margarine as others suggested also.  It became very greasy.

I had a bag of cookie mix, which had a cookie bar recipe on it.. so I made that, and decided it needed something on top. I reduced the recipe in half ( 8 servings) and then added a couple extra tbls of peanut butter, and upped the milk to 2 tbls from there. I followed the recipe and had no issues. This frosting tastes fantastic! I saw someone mention the cake recipe on the back of the cocoa container.. I plan on making that and using this frosting next!

I could not get this frosting to be fluffy, instead it was greasy. I may have melted the butter a little instead of just softening it though. However, though it was not fluffy it was still delicious! I frosted the brownie batter cupcake with this frosting and got rave reviews

Just what I was looking for!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out delicious.  My husband told me it tasted like the inside of a peanut butter cup.  I used this to frost chocolate cupcakes (used a family recipe) and couldn't have been happier with the results.  Definitely make sure you have a glass of milk handy!  Thanks for sharing this yummy, easy recipe.

Very good light peanut butter frosting. Delicious to eat. But I tried to use it for decorating a cake and it didn't work out well. It didn't take the color as I expected and wouldn't smooth like I wanted. But that could be my inexperience. But it tastes AMAZING!!!

This is one of my favorite frosting recipes.  It goes great on a chocolate cake or brownies.  I made it as a topping for a Mayonnaise Cake, and everyone loved it.  It is not too sweet.  Several people have asked me for the recipe.

Made this according to the recipe using Jiff peanut butter and real butter (not margarine).  Made sure everything was room temperature and alternated adding powdered sugar and milk to the butter/peanut butter blend.  It came out perfect!  Light, fluffy and intense peanut butter flavor.  This recipe is a gold star Keeper!

I used this recipe just as it is but doubled it to ice a chocolate 1/2 sheet cake... Then I accented the cake with store-bought chocolate icing and mini reese cups along the border... it was for a friend's birthday and everyone at the party absolutely loved it! Delicious, impressive, and most importantly EASY! Thanks for sharing!

Just what I needed. I used Jif's Extra Crunchy Peanut Butter. For a half recipe, I did only need one tablespoon of milk. My husband didn't think that the peanut butter cookies were peanut butter-y enough so I made this frosting to make cookie sandwiches out of them. He loves them.

This is the BEST frosting.  I'm not even a big fan of peanut butter frosting and this was amazing.  I followed other reviews about whipping it, but I still had to add another tablespoon or two of milk to make it more of a spreadable consistency.  This makes a LOT of frosting, so I made brownies and dolloped stars of it on the brownies, too (in addition to the 24 cupcakes I frosted).  Yum! The taste reminds me of the inside of one of my favorite holiday candies - the buckeye.  Definitely a keeper!

PERFECT frosting for chocolate cupcakes!  I only needed to beat the ingredients for less than a minute to get it fluffy and I wouldn't suggest beating for more than that much less 3 minutes because it will start to get gritty.

Perfect peanut butter frosting! It came out so light and fluffy with just the right amount of sweetness. I whipped the butter and peanut butter together in my stand mixer until it was smooth as silk and completely blended. Then I added the powdered sugar and milk (I only used 1 1/2 cups sugar) and it was done! Very easy and very delicious; this will be my go-to recipe from now on.

This frosting has a good peanut butter flavor, not too sweet.  I added a little bit of vanilla and a pinch of salt.  The most important tip I can share us that it is very sensitive to heat because of the butter.  If you are going to pipe this frosting I would suggest refrigerating it first.  Keep the finished product chilled.

Amazing! I added this to a chocolate peanut butter layer cake as the filling and it lightened the whole thing up so it wasn't so "Death by chocolate/peanut butter" without taking any flavor away. So simple and easy to make up!

I really liked this. it was quick and easy to make. It still tasted like peanut butter, but it was very fluffy. I think it could have been a little sweeter. I used more then 2 tablespoons of milk. This was great on chocolate cake

This came out great. Very peanutty but yummy. It was VERY easy to spread you just have to mix it well enough. Add milk if its too stiff. To me it kind of tasted like the filling of a nutter butter cookie. I made chocolate cupcakes filled w/ a mini reeses cup and topped it with half chocolate buttercream & half of this peanut butter frosting. It came out beautifully.

Excellent. Beat it to death, it turns out fantastic. I used the full 3 tb milk. It has a very quiet taste, not too obnoxious.

Very delicious. Incredibly fluffy and smooth with great flavor. I did it with dark chocolate brownies, then placed a coat of this peanut butter frosting on it, sprinkled it with chopped reese's pieces, then coated that with a thing dark coat of chocolate fudge icing. It was incredible.

This was really greasy and grainy. I didn't like it all. Maybe I did something wrong.. I don't know, but I won't try this recipe again.  This was my first time trying a peanut butter frosting though and it just didn't turn out. To try and fix it I added some chocolate ganache (for the cake I was making) and more powdeered sugar.. it turned out better but it was still very greasy. I will post a picture of my cake..

I have made this recipe twice now and it is perfect. I spread it over a batch of brownies and took it over to my friends house. Five girls ate that whole batch of brownies and the leftover frosting.

First time making this...great taste(kids are fighting over the leftovers now) and will make it again but it was to thick for my liking. But I think that was me and not the recipe. I would recommend it just how it is. ;)

A great base recipe. Used as a starting point for my frosting. I made a double batch: 1 c. butter, 2 c. PB and then added the sugar to taste with just enough milk to make it spreadable. People raved about it, not too sweet and not so much peanut butter that it tastes like it's straight from the jar. I got asked for the recipe but I might just keep it my little secret :D

Very good recipe - very peanut-buttery, easily spreadable and not too sweet!  I followed recommended changes:  room temperature butter, increased peanut butter to 1-1/4 c and decreased powdered sugar to 1-1/2 c, also added 1 T vanilla and beat all for 3-4 minutes.  Put on "Too Much Chocolate Cake" from this websitel Topped with Hershey Kisses around the edge and crushed Reece's Peanut Butter Cups on top. Very pretty and very tasty!  Thanks for the recipe!

Don't use all-natural, 100% peanut butter. Use the cheap jiffy-type stuff. It will turn out much better. Also, I mixed mine in a stand-up mixer for about 5 minutes (maybe more) to get it nice and fluffy. SO GOOD!!!

This is delicious and so easy to make with things you already have on hand.  I followed the recipe exactly as written, except that I only had reduced fat peanut butter.  (What a diet, right?)  I just used my Kitchen Aid mixer and added the sugar alternately with the tablespoons of the milk.  It was really fluffy and very easy to spread.

I'm a newbie to baking & cooking & have been intimidated by making homemade frosting.  I found this recipe very easy to follow & am happy with the result, which was a little thick even though I followed the recipe as directed.  I'm chalking it up to butter & peanut butter that wasn't near traditional room temperature; my house stays cold (around 60dF) when I'm not at home (which is most of the day LOL).

This recipe was just the thing.  I used crunchy peanut butter because I was putting this frosting between the layers of a 4-layer cake, and I like extra crunch in a cake.  I ended up using 1/2 cup less powdered sugar than called for, but that was based on personal taste rather than consistency (I'm sure the full amount of sugar would have been good, too).  This was awesome for my peanut butter cake with chocolate frosting (this frosting in the layers and chocolate on the outside).  Thanks!

Super great!  I followed the recipe exactly, even though some reviews said to change the amounts.  I just made sure the butter was room temperature and whipped it like crazy with the peanut butter.  I put it on top of brownies I made in a mini-muffin pan and they were spectacular!

The recipe came out very good. The only thing I did to make it more spreadable on my cake was add a bit more milk. The secret to getting it smooth and creamy though is use a hand held mixer and keep mixing. Your frosting will turn out light, fluffy and yummy in the end.

This is the perfect peanut butter frosting!!!  It is easy to make and tastes wonderful.  I recommend useing high quality peanut butter not the no name brands.  You can really taste the higher quality of the frosting.

This tastes very good...kind of reminds me of the taste of a Reeses' Peanut Butter Cup...but I won't use this recipe again.  The consistency is not great at all.  Mine turned out grainy and funny looking...not spreadable...didn't make a very good presentation at all.  Also...it didn't make enough icing for a 2-layer cake.  Again, though...it did taste very good...especially on a rich chocolate cake!

Amazing! This recipe makes the perfect peanut butter frosting-the peanut butter flavor in the frosting is not overpowering, just the right amount of peanut butter flavor. The recipe does make A LOT of frosting though. The first time I made the recipe I used about half of the frosting on a large cake and "saved" the rest for later-which turned out to be me snacking on it for the next week. The next time I made the recipe I halved it all and the amount was perfect for a 9in x 11in cake! Definitely recommend it!!

This frosting turned out great. After reading the other reviews, I made sure all the ingredients were at room temperature and I also sifted the powder sugar before adding it to the mixer. The frosting was smooth, creamy, and easy to spread on a two layer devil's food cake. Delicious!

Excellent frosting. Tastes like a creamy Reese's peanut butter cup filling.

I was concerned about consistency. I made sure to beat butter & peanut butter well, adding 1-teaspoon vanilla. Then, added only 1/2-cup powdered sugar at a time, alternating with 1-tablespoon milk, until I achieve the desired consistency.

The thickness of frosting will change with humidity levels in the air, and the brand powdered sugar you use. By adding only part of the sugar at a time, you eliminate any problems with consistency.
Bon Appetit!

Okay, I NEVER like eating frosting, even my homemade ones!!!  I can eat this stuff by the spoonfuls.  Amazing frosting!!!  Fabulous consistency and great peanut butter taste.  I worked in a bakery for years, and I have never made a nicer frosting than this one!!! Love it!!

I made this last night to add some flavor to a chocolate/choc. chunk store bought cookie mix I made.  WOW!!  It was perfect!  I only added 2 tbsp. milk and stopped because it already looked perfectly fluffy at that point.  The taste is wonderful.  I think the trick is using the mixer for a long time.  My son was helping and he loves using the mixer so I let him mix til his heart was content and the results were fabulous!  I've already printed this one out and added to my recipe book!  I just realized my user name is similar to the submitter...no, we are not the same person!

This frosting was great!  I made it for a chocolate-peanut butter cake, and everyone who ate it wanted the frosting recipe.  It  was plenty fluffy, I beat it a while like is says to.  Mmmm, good frosting- thanks!
Added afterward: The 2nd time I made this it got thick and sticky, like honey.  I think difference was how much milk I added.  It looked grainy when I began mixing, so I added more milk, and it made it sticky.  More sugar helped a little.  I think you just have to beat it for the 3 min. before you decide if you need more milk or sugar. (?) I will still use this  recipe, though- I just have to figure out what made it work the 1st time and not the 2nd.

this stuff was awesome!  I could have just ate it all right out of the bowl!  It doesn't spread real pretty, but would be a great filling in a layer cake.  I'm thinking if I played with it more and whipped in more milk, it may have become smoother.  Otherwise, tastes great!

This turned out fluffy enough and easy to spread, but it just didn't taste good.

This tasted AMAZING, but it wasn't fluffy at all.  Maybe someone could post something helping me out?  I beat the recipe for a really long time, so I know that it isn't that I didn't mix enough.  It was greasy and impossible to spread on my cupcakes.  I ended up grabbing a clump with my fingers and slapping it on the cupcakes.  It tasted really good, but was in NO way fluffy (or spreadable!)

This is absolutely the best peanut butter frosting.  It is very light and fluffy and so easy to make.  The first time I made it I did feel that it was too sweet, so the second time I made it I cut the sugar in half and it was absolutely perfect!  Everyone that tried it absolutely loved it.  Will definitely be a keeper.  As others have said, make sure you beat it really well as that is what makes it so wonderfully fluffy.

Wonderful, just wonderful.  Although I'm a good cook I seem to have the worst time w/ frostings, they never seem fluffy enough... this was wonderful.  The only change I made was using cream rather than milk.

Not bad, but I think we were expecting something sweeter.  The appearance was not as nice as I'd hoped either-it started out shiny as I mixed it, then turned dull and a very light tan.  I used milk-maybe whipping cream would  give it a little more shine.  I think I'd prefer a more standard icing than this fluffy whipped kind, but thats a personal preference.

very creamy and the taste is perfect!  I did whip it for a while.  everyone loved it!  i frosted a 2 layer cake with it - wasn't super easy to frost, the frosting kept sticking to my knife and pulling away from the cake, but I managed!  It would probably work best on a single layer cake when frosting.

This recipe turned out great for me.  I used another reviews advice and made sure the butter and peanut butter were well creamed as well as whipping it for a longer time at the end to make it fluffy.  This was a hit with the dark chocolate cake from this site. For those that had trouble spreading the frosting, dip the knife in warm water as you spread it.

I needed a good starting point for peanut butter frosting and this was it.  However, I too found that even by following the directions it was more pastey than I like.  I added heavy whipping cream and beat until it was fluffy, and NOW it is fantastic.

Very good frosting. However I made some adjustments. Used Crisco shortening as I was out of butter. Added more peanut butter and confectioner sugar as well as milk. It's a good base for making your own frosting creations.

I gave this stuff 4 stars because the taste is fabulous.  However, I wouldn't call it frosting. It's more of a paste. The cake I made was delicious but it didn't look very pretty.  If you want really spreadable frosting then you should look elsewhere.

This is just kind of peanut butter frosting I was looking for.  Great on top of my chocolate cake.  It makes the perfect amount to make a nice thick layer on a 13x9 sheet cake.  Great flavor, without overwhelming the cake.  Not too heavy feeling either.

I added a couple tablespoons of cocoa powder to give that hint of chocolate to tie in with my cake.

The taste is very good, but you have to play around with the consistency, if your frosting something dense and small it's not a problem but I used it on a large double layered birthday cake and the frosting was tearing the cake.  I used one of my favorite recipes from this site, Lisa’s chocolate chocolate chip cake recipe and covered it with this frosting and it was a huge hit, peanut butter and chocolate, how could I miss!

The only change I made when making this recipe was to use almond milk instead of regular milk. My frosting was very difficult to spread and very gritty. I am not sure if it was the recipe itself or the almond milk, but at minimum, I would not recommend this substitution. The flavor was a very mild peanut butter flavor and made way more frosting than would be required for 2 dozen cupcakes, as other bakers noted.

Im fairly good at cooking, what a mess this recipe was. It separated and nothing I did could get it to re-emulsify. I ended up with a thick blob of fudge like stuff and the milk and oil separated out. I read on-line and to try and get it to come back together they recommended adding a block of unsweetened melted chocolate as an emulsifier. It didnt work - now I had a blob of peanut butter chocolate. I didnt want this all to go to waste so I decided to try and heat it up and melt it all together.  I put the blob over low heat and started mixing. Once it started to get melty, I added the oil and liquids that had curdled out and I kept mixing. I ended up with a thick glaze like chocolate peanut butter icing. I iced the cupcakes and everyone loved them. My son who took them to a graduation party reported that the kids thought they tasted like Girl Scout Tagalong cookies. The 2 star review is because the original recipe didnt work for me.

Followed the recipe exactly as written. The frosting was perfect, was not greasy, there was not any over powering flavors. Like I said perfect. I used Peter Pan peanutbutter. If it is to hard to spread like other reviews state, add some more milk to thin it out some.

I did use heavy whipping cream , I had on hand to use up, instead of milk.. Used about 4 tablespoons.  This is delish and makes pleanty with more to spare for 24 cupcakes.

I used 2 1/2 tabl milk and 11/2 tsp vanilla
  the family loves it!
Sometimes I omit 1/4 cup of the sugar and add 1/4 cup of cocoa.  Throw a 1/2 cup of reeses pieces in a box of cake mix and you have a reese's peanut butter cake.

Made this for my dad b/c he mentioned wanting some with chocolate cake (a few months ago) and then I found this recipe.

I did make a few changes.  I ended up using less sugar (1/3 to 1/2 less) than it called for.  And then I added more peanut butter, and then some 1/3 to 1/2 package of plain cream cheese (first to cut more of the sweetness down, and the cream cheese b/c I said "why not?").  And then I might have used more milk.  I just splashed the milk in from time to time.  I would rate it 5 stars with using less sugar (and my other tweaks didn't hurt).

But it stayed really soft and fluffy for me.  In fact, my dad thought it was too fluffy--he thought it would be thicker.

It stiffened up in the refrigerator, but then got back to smooth and fluffy when it sat out a bit.

Start out with a small amount of sugar and taste as you go.  I bet you won't use all 2 cups.  If you have a magic bullet to make the powdered sugar--even better!

It must be REALLY GOOD b/c my dad ate four slices of chocolate cake with my frosting in less than 2 hours!

AND IT'S REALLY GOOD AS THE DIP FOR TART APPLE SLICES--LIKE McINTOSH APPLES!

I keep coming back to this recipe as my base (and to remember it) and then add my little tweaks.

Pretty good recipe. I did half the cupcakes just by the recipe and the other half I added some unsweetened cocoa powder and they turned out great as well. Room temp butter and adding the milk while adding the sugar in stages is key

Loved this recipe, but found it to be a little on the sweet side depending on what you put it on. I used it on chocolate peanut butter cup cupcakes and it was a little overwhelming. I simply just decreased the amount of powdered sugar to 1 cup, and it was fantastic! It didn't effect the frosting's consistency at all. It was perfect!

Delicious! I only added about 1/2 cup and a little extra of the PB because I thought it would be too thick. I added some vanilla extract too. This is to die for!

My son requested peanut butter frosting for his birthday so I thought I would give this recipe a try. I halved the recipe to frost a 9 x 13 cake and followed the directions exactly (with the exception of adding a little vanilla) and it turned out perfect. Thank you.

I made a batch and a half with real peanut butter (homemade). I used my Kitchenaid stand mixer with the whisk (mistake). I had beautiful frosting then I added milk and it got greasy and crumbly. More milk did not make it better. I put in it the fridge and read some reviews. Someone said to keep beating it. I changed to the beater blade and mixed it more. Waala! I had the fluffy yummy frosting back. I piped in on chocolate cupcakes and topped them with chopped Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. Delicious!!

This frosting was perfect! I do not normally like frosting, but a student of mine brought me a chocolate cupcake with peanut butter frosting and i was hooked! So I looked for the perfect recipe and this is it. Perfectly sweet, perfect for piping or spreading. I beat the butter for a minute or so to make sure it was smooth before adding the peanut butter, and it was perfectly thick, fluffy, and soft. I ended up adding real close to 4 Tbsp of milk before it was done perfectly. Awesome recipe!

Created an account just to review this, seriously. This is everything I love about peanut butter without the overt sweetness.  Turned out PERFECTLY. As long as you beat the butter and peanut butter thoroughly, it is perfectly spreadable and we actually piped with it. The only thing I added was a teaspoon of vanilla, and that was just out of habit. EXCELLENT recipe.

Genius! Used it on PB filled chocolate cupcakes, my boys all loved it, I had to shoo them away with a broom to keep them out of the kitchen so I could frost! Yes, it spreads so easily, I only needed one hand! ;)

This recipe worked great.  I was concerned by poor reviews what with my own difficulty in getting icing to turn out usually, but I tried it anyways and was pleasantly surprised.  No problems at all, nice light fluffy buttercream texture, easy to spread, fantastic flavor, makes plenty.  I used room temp butter and pb and my kitchenaid stand mixer and let it whip for plenty of time as the recipe suggests.  I'm putting this in my family recipe book, its sure to be a favorite.

Pretty good frosting recipe. I prefer a more peanutbuttery frosting, but this one did the trick. I alternated sugar and milk while blending and added a 1/4 t of salt for some umph.

This recipe was fantabulous!!! I was desperate for a peanut butter frosting for my brownies and came across this recipe.  My only change was a happened to have heavy whipping cream on hand and used that instead of milk. It turned out to be the BEST peanut butter cream recipe I could have ever imagined.  It really is light and fluffy and peanut buttery...so good. It was very easy to spread and just as easy to pipe onto my brownies.  This recipe gives you plenty of frosting to be able to frost a double layer cake.  Thank you so much for posting this fantastic recipe. I have no need to ever try another peanut butter frosting recipe.

I always add a dash of salt to bring out flavor.  Also, to get proper consistency, either add more milk and beat beat beat if too stiff, or add more sugar and beat beat beat if too runny!  Pretty simple.  And make sure you use quality peanut butter!  Thank you, Nickie75!

Delicious!!  I will sometimes add a TBS or 2 of Hazelnut Creamer to it to add a little more richness and sweeter nutty taste.  It is so yummy!  This frosting has made my cupcakes a number one hit in our area!!

This is really great icing. I've never had much success with icing before, but this turned out perfectly. I added a fourth tablespoon of milk and a teaspoon of vanilla and it was smooth, fluffy, and not at all greasy. It piped really well and was easy to spread.

My mother made this icing for ALL of our birthdays so we had it at least 6 times per year...always on a layered Devil's Food cake.   I always use Jif and because its on Devil's Food, I only use 1/2 cup PB (I always use same amount of butter as peanut butter).  If I were icing a yellow cake, and wanted more of a PB flavor, I'd use more PB but I make a Devil's Food cake that is not very sweet but very flavorful so I just use 1/2 cup.  Turns out perfectly every time.  I really think the key is to not use fancy PB...use Jif and real butter not margarine.  Very fluffy and spreadable.

I just made this frosting and I didn't have enough confectioners sugar (my fault)so it didn't get as creamy as it should have but it tastes good so I frosted the cake anyway.  next time I'll make sure I have enough sugar.

I've made this recipe several times, and it's always come out great for me. It's fluffy and easy to spread. Just always make sure you don't overboard with the milk. Like the recipe says, go one tablespoon at a time so you don't get too much liquid in there. Sometimes I needed all three, but sometimes I only needed two. I don't know why other people's came out "like concrete," because this is much easier to spread for me than the store bought frostings, which are sugary and over-powering. Great peanut butter flavor. Will definitely be using this as a go-to.

Made this dairy free for allergy reasons by substituting in shortening for the butter and 4 tbs of water for the milk. Tasty and simple! Thickly frosted a 13x9.

Good recipe, needs work. I used 2 1/2 cups of sugar, not 2, 1/3 cup of milk and I also added 1tsp of vanilla. With the changes it was 1000x better,and was actually spreadable.

Delicious! I made the mistake of overbeating the frosting which made it grainy, but if you watch it carefully, it is very fluffy and perfect for brownies.

This is a great peanut butter frosting or filling.  I actually use it for gobs (whoopie pies) and I wouldn't hesitate to use it as a cake or cupcake filling and frosting.  I don't even measure the milk, I just add it until I get the consistency I want.  For added body and richness, you can also use half & half or cream.  Has great peanut butter flavor!

I think the success of this recipe depends on the type of peanut butter you use. The first time I made it I used skippy, and the frosting turned out tasty, but really hard to spread. The next time I used jiff and it turned out fluffy, creamy, and delicious. the second time I also cut out a lot of the butter. With all the peanut butter, I don't think a 1/2 cup is really needed.

Amazingness... I had a very juvenile moment after I finished mixing the frosting: I licked those mixing prongs like I a five-year old in heat. Nobody's business at all!!! It was a miracle that the frosting even made it to the cake. Topped it on the "Black Magic" Chocolate cake recipe from this site. I initially tried mixing with a fork, but the electric hand mixer does get it nice and fluffy.

Delish!   I wasn't able to get my as smooth as some of the pictures show, so I guess I'll have to try again :)  As the description states, not too sweet.  Paired with choc cupcakes.  This was JUST enough for ~30 cupcakes.

Wow. Wow wow WOW. This frosting is so darn good! Hubby convinced me to bake a chocolate PB marble cake and frost it with this. I'm not a huge PB fan, but I couldn't keep my fingers out of the mixing bowl! It's got a nice PB flavor. It's just like Goldilocks and the three bears. The frosting is not too strong, not too sweet, it's juuuuust right. Made exactly as directed except needed a couple more TBSP of milk to make it thin enough to spread, and whipped the bejeebers out of it with my KitchenAid. Will definitely be making again when the fam gets a craving for PB cake.

Perfect and easy recipe. Light and fluffy with lots of flavor. I used it on chocolate cupcakes and topped it with half of a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. They looked gorgeous. I doubled the recipe for 24 cupcakes and used a generous amount on each and had extra frosting which I will spread over my next batch of brownies. Yum...

Love it! Follow the directions exactly and you won't be disappointed. 1 cup of peanut butter was a bit much for me so I'll cut the peanut butter a little for the next time. Other than that, fantastic!

I've been looking for a while for a good peanut butter frosting recipe, and I must say that this one is probably one of the best. It taste delicious, and still keeps that peanut butter taste while being light and fluffy. I didn't measure out the amount of milk I used, and I think I ended up using more than the recipe says just to make sure that it was super light and fluffy. I also added about 3/4 of a tablespoon of cocoa, just because the taste of peanut butter can be overwhelming in big quantities.

I made this frosting and it turned out great!!!   BUT, I'm the type who doesn't really measure, I started with the margarine, then the peanut butter. I mixed them together quite well and gradually added the powered sugar. I then added a little milk at a time and it turned out WONDERFUL!!!! It spread on the cake with no problems!!!  Thanks!!!

I give this 5 stars because it's super-easy to make, and the taste is terrific.
Try it on Angel Food cake ...it's outstanding!
It's not quite as good as the PB frosting my Great Grandma used to make, but it's definitely a close second, and unlike her frosting recipe, doesn't have to be cooked on the stove top.
I followed it exactly as written, adding just enough milk to get the consistency I needed. For a peanut butter frosting that only takes a few minutes to prepare, this one can't be beat.

Made it exactly as written, but halved it, cause I only needed a bit. If it's not spreadable enough, add more liquid.  I like that it didn't overpower the food, but you could still tell what it was.  I used store brand peanut butter, and it was just fine.  Used on butter pecan cupcakes, it was surprisingly different than your standard white, or cream cheese frosting.

This recipe was wonderful the first time I made it!  Best frosting I've ever tasted and it made so much!  Second time, I was not able to spread it at all.  The only difference was that I beat it the extra 3 minutes at the end which made it unspreadable.  The first time I made it I didn't even see that step and as soon as I mixed the powdered sugar in with the already creamed butter and peanut butter, I used it to frost the cake.  And the taste was marvelous!  So good I wanted to make it again which I did and this time I saw the beat for 3 minutes and did that.  It turned what was a beautiful creamy frosting into a peanut butter fudgey type mess.  I almost cried since it was my birthday cake.  But I plopped it on and we ate it anyway.  Great recipe but I recommend do not beat it the extra 3 minutes at the end.  It might turn out for some but since I made it both ways I just wanted to offer my suggestion to make it spreadable.

Love this recipe. I use it with cake mix chocolate cupcakes, and the frosting makes them seem gourmet and fancy. To aid in frosting, I put the icing in a plastic bag (i.e. sandwich bag), cut off the corner of the bag, and use it like a piping bag. Instant designer cupcakes!

This recipe is great but I made one small change. I added 1tsp vanilla. It adds depth of flavor and prevents it from being to stiff. Makes it very creamy  used it to frost a chocolate cake. Yummy!

It's very peanut butterish and is also spreadable. However, it is way too sweet for my preference. After all, there is already plenty of sugar in peanut butter. Next time I'll start with sugar, peanut butter, butter ratio at 2:2:1 and add more sugar if needed. Possibly can also tone down butter to 1/3 cup?

I made this icing as suggested and it turned out great.  It wasn't hard to spread on the cake at all.  I creamed the peanut butter and butter first for 2 mins and then I added the powdered sugar.  As soon as I added the powdered sugar it became dry, but as soon as I added the milk it became smooth again.  I tried spreading the icing on the cake with my spreader but ended up using my hands because the mixture wasn't staying on, but if I molded the icing on it stayed in place.  It tasted amazing!!  I used Natural PB Jif since I only eat natural PB.  Sometimes it is better to use original PB, but I opted to try the Natural and it worked perfectly.  I used this icining on the Too Much Chocolate Cake Recipe also found in All Recipes and garnished with crushed peanut butter cups.  Was an amazing cake!!!  My new favorite!!

Nice, fluffy frosting, however next time I will stay with my own ratios.......1/4 cup butter with 1 cup peanut butter. Mine tastes much more peanutty, which is the main reason to make peanut butter frosting. Mine comes out nice and fluffy as well, just maybe a bit more dense......more homemade like. NICKIE75'S is more like what you get @ the store......a lighter in both taste and density. To me, you just shouldn't need that much butter added to peanut butter.

This peanut butter frosting is amazing! Its not greasy, frosts well and tastes great. I made it with Jif's Omega 3 creamy peanut butter and it turned out great. I used my Kitchen Aid mixer to make this and I ended up having to use about 4.5 TBSP of milk and I let it go in my mixer for about 2-3 minutes so it was nice and fluffy. I put this on chocolate cupcakes.

This recipe doesn't really need another positive review, but I can't help myself.  This frosting is amazing!  Creamy, peanut buttery heaven.  I followed the recipe exactly - it needs no changes.  I frosted Lisa's Chocolate Chocolate Chip Cake (also from this site) with this frosting.

When making this icing, I revised the recipe for more of a butter-cream consistency:Blend into the peanut butter and softened butter- 2 Tablespoons(TBS) vegetable shortening and 1 tsp vanilla, mix until creamy consistency. I added 1 more TBS of butter to make it more creamier. Continue to add milk 1 TBS and 1 cup of powdered sugar at a time. You will end up using only 2 TBS milk and 2 cups of powdered sugar. By the way, no need to sift the sugar. My family and friends devoured my cake and loved the chocolate-peanut butter combination. This should fix any issues with spreading the icing.

I am not saying this isn't a good recipe , I just cant get it to work for me at all, Despite 3 attempts with different kinds of butter, (melted, room temp , and cold.) It was Just to greasy  and would not incorporate and stayed crumbly,,,, so I omitted the butter and replaced it with an 8 oz pack of cream cheese, and  IT WORKED LIKE A CHARM!!!, although you can taste a hint of cream cheese, its not bad at all,,kinda taste like a "Bit O Honey" candy,

I think this might just be the perfect blend of peanut butter/fluffy/sweet. I did add a bit more peanut butter than called for because I wanted a stronger peanut butter taste as I was making it for on brownies; but next time will be using it to fill chocolate cupcakes. Delicious!! To those that said this was pasty I found that couldn't be more wrong! Add the milk as needed and beat for a bit and it is super fluffy and highly spreadable!

Well, I just halved the recipe to frost an 8 x 8 inch pan of brownies. I even ballparked the peanut butter and butter, did not pack the sugar, and used 2 tbsp of milk. I pretty much followed the directions, beating on medium with an electric mixer, at every step. I added a little more sugar at the end to make it a little stiffer, and well, I can't see the problem the one reviewer who gave it 3 stars had. My daughter gave this 3 thumbs up. I haven't frosted the brownies yet, but it has great enough flavor for this house. Instant dress up for my DH brownies. Massive pms fix.
   FTR: I used Peter Pan creamy peanut butter, room temperature unsalted butter... well, I guess you could call it soft.. it's the butter I leave out for toast. Always turns out better than straight from the fridge.

I was rather pleased with this frosting recipe; I used it on a chocolate cupcake recipe from a magazine and it turned out fantastically. Great texture and piped very well onto the cupcakes. Not overwhelmingly peanut buttery but good nonetheless!! I had to beat this icing quite a bit because it didn't come together as easily as I had hoped but it smoothed out after just a minute or two of beating on a high setting. Definitely make sure the peanut butter is softened and the butter too!

I made this exactly as written, and it is fabulous,  I used my stand mixer, and after all ingredients and all the milk had been added, I let it go on medium for 3-4 minutes.   It whipped up very nicely.  I piped it into some chocolate cordial cups, froze them, and served them chilled.   It is very good.

This frosting is delicious and just as titled, fluffy. I don't think I used as much milk as the recipe called for but it was close. The first time I made it I added more milk and it wasn't as fluffy. Will use this recipe again and again.

This was very good! What was even better is that I only needed 1 cup of confectioners' sugar instead of 2 because it was sweet enough for my taste! Really good on chocolate cake!

Really liked this frosting, paired it (as recommended) with the Brownie Batter + Cupcake recipe and it was incredibly well-received! My husband didn't want to share it with our guests. I liked the fluffiness of the recipe, it is easy and I always have the ingredients on hand. Definitely a keeper!

So good! I usually don't like peanut buttery sweets, but I needed a frosting to top my cupcakes so I tried this and so glad I did! 
Followed the recipe exactly but I added 2 tsp of vanilla. Perfect!

This was perfect!!!! Fluffy and yummy!  I think I may have over beat it in my Kitchen Aid - because it didn't stick to my brownies very well - but, the flavor was spot on!  Not too sweet!  Will make again!

I made this frosting for peanut butter and jelly cupcakes for my grandson and they were a big hit.  This is such a nice fluffy frosting and has a very good mild peanut butter tase.  Will definitely use it again.

This was easy and tasty!  I used it with the Double Chocolate Brownie Cake recipe - my fiance asked for an ice cream cake for his birthday, so I spread a layer of vanilla ice cream between the layers of chocolate cake and then spread the peanut butter frosting on after the cake and ice cream had a few hours to set up in the freezer.  I decorated it with mini Reese's cups and my fiance said it was the best cake he'd ever had!

5 stars followed the recipe to the letter, turned at fluffy and  yummy, put it on sugar free choclate cupcakes, will be at hit at work tommorrow, oh one thing i did change i took butter stright out of the frig and put in in the microwave for 20 seconds, middle of cube was melted, the other sides were just soft, made it easier to beat on low,used low speed until all the milk was added then finished the three mintues on medium speed very fluffy, start 3 minute timer when you start adding the milk. 1st time ever making a fluffy frosting and it turned out perfect,  just like the picture. will make again. thanks for posting

Just made this to frost my chocoolate cupcakes and it was absolutely amazing! The only thing I added was 1 tsp of vanilla extract and 1 tbsp of nutella.  The peanut butter taste was subtle but stood out to the chocolate. Loved it - great recipe and thanks :)

This frosting was the first frosting I have ever made and it's DELICIOUS!!! I had to add a little bit more milk to make it easier to spread, other than that used the recipe to a T. Definitely will be making this again.

Our favorite, by far at my house.  This is a hit! It is very fragile, make sure you dont add to much milk.

Made this frosting for chocolate cupcakes using all natural peanut butter (just peanuts and salt).  The whole crowd went wild!  Excellent recipe - I used the wire whip on my Kitchenaid mixer to first mix the butters together and it came out creamy and perfect!  Thanks so much!

I pretty much followed the recipe exactly but found I had to add more like 5-6 tbs milk. It did come out light and fluffy but it did have a grainy appearance to the frosting, though it was not grainy at all, in fact it was very creamy. I did think it a tad bit too sweet. Next time I will use less sugar, but it could have been too sweet because I used 1/2 cup natural Jiff and 1/2 cup white chocolate peanut butter. The kids loved it on top of the banana muffins. I will definitely save this and try it again with just pb and a bit less sugar. Would like to find out how to make it not look grainy though.

This recipe was not to my liking. I am rather accomplished at cake making but this was just a pain. I made 2 batches, the first ended up super crumbly so I figured it was too much milk. Second was smoother but still had a rough consistency. Was impossible to ice a cake with, even added a bit of store bought chocolate frosting hoping to make it more spreadable. Frosting would hardly stick to the cake and was very greasy. Great idea but I will never make this again.

This really was an awesome recipe!! Simple (which I love) and so tasty! I did try to make this with margarine against the advise of another comment, and it was REALLY greasy! Butter is definitely the only way to go!

This recipe was super easy and tasty. I made it for the topping on my mother's birthday brownies. She LOVED it way more than her own PB frosting recipe - which is really saying something! 

The only complaint I have is that it was a little too sweet for my taste. I would scale back the powdered sugar to 1 1/2 cups. 
I also found I had to use extra milk to soften it up, perhaps because I used a reduced fat peanut butter that was a bit drier than the full fat version.

All in all, GREAT recipe!

This was very easy, and we enjoyed it.  Bf was very excited about the cupcakes with pb frosting.  I used only 1 cup of sugar, since I tasted it after adding the first cup and decided it was sweet enough.  I also just kept adding tablespoons of milk until it was the consistency I needed to pipe the frosting onto the cupcakes.  I still have a lot left; I'm going to look for a brownie recipe, since I'm sure it'd be good with more chocolate.  thanks for the recipe!

This was pretty good! I used natural peanut butter which is a little drier so I needed 5½ tbsp milk. I also added some vanilla which made it alot tastier. I used half to fill some chocolate cupcakes and I'll probably use the other half to make peanut butter cups/balls :)

I made 24 servings of this recipe, and first off. It was going beautifully, all the ingredients were blending together. Then I added the rest of the sugar, and a lil more milk. And it became way to greasy. I put it in the fridge for 30 minutes, and ... didn't fix it at all. THEN I added whip cream, and it made it more fluffy. Besides that, it tasted grrrreat! :D

Amazing as-is!  You can also use margarine instead of butter for a cheaper and still delicious frosting.  Next time I am going to put some melted semi-sweet baker's chocolate in for a delicious chocolate peanut butter frosting!

I was looking for a peanut butter frosting that did not have cream cheese, and found this fantastic recipe!  I frosted a chocolate cake with this, and got many conmpliments.  Everyone found it very peanut-buttery.  I only had 3/4 cup of peanut butter, so I melted peanut butter chips and beat them in, which might have added more peanut butter flavor.  This will be my go-to peanut butter frosting recipe from now on.

This is very good frosting, however, I needed it to be more fluffy so I added another 1/2 stick of butter and got exactly what I wanted.  Good recipe, though

This recipe is not to my liking! The frosting is far from fluffy and is more like paste. I followed it exactly! I would not recommend it making it this way. I ended up adding a tub of cool whip. This made it fluffy and I was able to spread it's over the cake.  Ended up tasting pretty good.

Creamy and delicious. Great on brownies, white cake, or the spatula. Followed the directions as written. I took it on brownies to a family reunion and everyone loved it. My pan was gone long before anything else. I will use this often and forever.

Okay, so I personally would rate this four stars because I am not a big peanut butter fan but the people who are LOVED it and it was a super easy recipe and it came out perfectly light and fluffy.

This is a great multi-purpose recipe and I only made a few adjustments, as the original recipe didnt spread as easily.  Like another user, I used about 1 & 1/4 to 1 & 1/2 C. of P.B. & 1.5 C. of powdered sugar, I also added 1.5 tsp. of good vanilla, and milk came out to approx. 5 Tbsp. My husband ate his chocolate with P.B. frosting in SECONDS, and couldnt stop telling me how much he loved it. It was very peanut buttery, and that's how he likes it. Thanks so much for this recipe and ideas.

WAYYYY TOO SWEET if you make it as directed. I used Skippy peanut butter, which is pretty unsweet in the commercial peanu butter world. I increased the peanut butter to 1 1/2 cups, added 1/4 tsp salt, and used heavy cream in place of the milk. YUM. I wanted to lick the bowl clean! Thanks for the base recipe!

Creamy, fluffy, peanut buttery... But not my favorite chocolate cupcake frosting, maybe just too rich or something. Would be better with brownies

Excellent!  I make this frosting as written - it does not need "tweaked." I frosted a pan of brownies with this frosting, then covered the frosting with the itsy-bitsy peanut butter cups from Trader Joe's - outstanding! Please try this recipe as written before you attempt to "improve" it - it need no improvement - it's perfect as written!  Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!

It is yummy for sure.... but how could it not be when your ingredients are pure peanut butter, butter, and sugar. I mean, it's not figure friendly....but goodness, it is delish! Indulge!

This recipe requires about twice as much milk as is called for. However, if you add the extra milk, the topping is good when paired with chocolate cupcakes. I wouldn't say it is to die for, but it makes a decent dessert.

I used this with the Whoopie Pies I recipe from this site, and the combination was delicious.  I didn't find it difficult to spread at all, but then I probably put in more milk than the recipe calls for, I'm not sure.  (I used butter and peanut butter that were at room temperature.)  I didn't measure the milk at all, just kept adding a little at a time until the frosting was the consistency I was looking for.

Wonderful. I did a cupcake bar for my daughter's 13th birthday party and peanut butter frosting was one of the choices. It was a huge hit and so very easy to make. Peanut butter is my husbands favorite and he liked it so much he wanted to eat it out of the bowl!!!

I think this recipe was great; however I was doubling it and ran out of peanut butter.  I decided to go with the less amount and the peanut butter flavor was perfect.  With too much, it would have been was too peanut buttery, and that is why it may have been greasy for some of you.  Instead of 2 cups (while doubling recipe) i used about 1 cup or a little less.  It was great, I put it on chocolate cupcakes from scratch.  Will definitely make this again.

The first time I made this recipe, it didn't go so well - i use extra creamy peanut butter, and the icing refused to get fluffy, and was smooth and creamy like regular peanut butter.  It still tasted good though, so I decided to re-try the recipe.

I made a full recipe, and followed it exactly with the exception that I substituted the milk for cream, and I only used about half.  I beat the bejeezus out of the peanut butter and butter before I added the icing sugar, and added the icing sugar in 4 stages, making sure to fully incorporate it before adding more.  It is fantastic, and this is definitely a keeper for me!

i halved the recipe and it was enough to put a thin layer on a chocolate cake without being too much peanut butter. very creamy. and it isn't hard to spread if you add an extra tbsp or two of milk. great recipe, thank you!

This is an awesome frosting, but you do need to follow as it is written to be nice smooth and spreadable.  I only used the 3 Tablespoons of milk like it calls for and spread very nicely on  my cake.  Very good recipe.

Perfect as is. Extremely fluffy and very easy to spread. I don't understand how anyone can find it too stiff. I beat the heck out of SOFT butter and room temp low sugar PB with the whisk attachment until it's fluffy and the add the POWDERED sugar 1/2 cup at a time. After the first cup, add a TBL of milk or cream.  Keep adding powdered sugar and cream until it reaches the consistency you want. You can add/subtract PB and sugar according to your taste. No way this can fail IF you follow the recipe as written. If you substitute margarine then don't expect it to turn out well and certainly don't rate it based on your mistake! And don't even think about trying granulated sugar! You'll have gritty frosting for sure.

This frosting is AMAZING! At my request, my mom made this frosting for my chocolate birthday cake. She followed the recipe exactly and it was just enough to frost a two layer 9" round cake. She topped off the cake with some chopped peanut butter cups and it was perfection. I will definitely use this recipe in the future for brownies and cupcakes. Excellent!

I thought this was a little greasy and hard to spread. But everyone raved about it and asked for the recipe.

This frosting is great.  The first time I made it I did not have a mixer and tried making it by hand so it did not turn out fluffy and creamy also I only added 3 tablespoons of milk.  It tasted great but did not look so good and spreading it was more like working with paste.  This time I broke down and bought a blender and added more milk as needed.  It turned out great....just like the fluffy frosting in the pictures!

Very few recipes are a flop for me, but this one did just that. Disappointed that I couldn't get the same results as others here. Maybe it is the fact that I used natural peanut butter.

This frosting is perfect. It's not too overly rich. I used this frosting for the "banana cupcake" recipe I found on this site. Combining the peanut butter frosting with the banana cupcakes was an awesome combination. You've got to try it.

Made this for a 9" chocolate layer cake.  As I was mixing (and taste testing), I noticed two things: you would need more milk to deal with 2 cups of sugar and that 2 cups of sugar would be almost unbearably sweet.  I ended up using 1/2 cup butter, 1 cup pb, 3+ tbs milk and less than 1 1/3 cup of sugar.  With these changes it was still peanut buttery and not over the top sugary.

I made this icing to go over bananna cake and the combination was DELICIOUS!  You can even add a few chocolate chips to the bananna cake.  The icing is a bit harder to spread, but I found that if you whip it a bit longer with the hand mixer it becomes a little easier to work with.  ...Can't ...stop... eating the ... cake.

Yum Yum! This frosting is so different and delicious.  I followed the recipe to a T and it came out perfect, didn't have any issues with spreading.  I used natural peanut butter since it doesn't have any added sugar.

I used Jif PB and real butter. It wasn't oily at all for me, but I did use a stand mixer instead of a hand mixer. Maybe that's the difference some people are having with the recipe that's causing the oiliness. Also, the butter should be softened, but not melting. Too warm butter would cause oiliness for sure.   It was perfectly spreadable for me. If it looks too stiff in the bowl, just add a little more milk.  The only change I made was adding a little vanilla extract. The only mistake I made was not doubling the recipe!! Great recipe! Thanks!

WOW beautiful frosting.  I made it for a dark chocolate cake and though I haven't had a piece of the cake yet the frosting is out of this world.  Not overly peanut buttery but light and fluffy and just gorgeous.  I can't wait to have a nice big piece of cake now =)

I made this to use in between chocolate cake mix cookies to make peanut butter whoopie pies for my daughter's softball team.  It made 17 cookies and they were gone in minutes.  I have leftover frosting that I am going to use to frost brownies tomorrow.  Easy, delicious recipe!

I just made this to frost the "Extreme Chocolate Cake" recipe from this site.  The combo was AMAZING!  I'm not a real fan of peanut butter, but this frosting really helps compliment the taste of the chocolate cake!  Thank you so much!

Love it! I made this for the first time tonight, but it certainly won't be the last! I only needed 2 tablespoons milk and I used vanilla rice milk because that's what I had on hand. Other than that, I followed the directions just the way they are written and my frosting turned out fluffy and perfect. Wonderfully spreadable and not at all grainy. I will make this one time and time again!

Great tasting and EASY! I made cupcakes so I halved the recipe. I was a bit short on peanut butter so I added 2 tbsp of marshmallow cream to make up the volume along with 1/4 tsp vanilla (I LOVE vanilla.)  This recipe does not need any changes, mine were out of necessity and just happened to work out.

Just made this frosting, yummy! I read other reviews regarding just reading the directions on the recipe and beating for about 3 minutes. I used about 4 tablespoons of milk and it is nice, fluffy, and so good!

Yum!!!  I could (and did) eat it with a spoon!!!  It is a thick frosting - not for use on delicate cakes.

I made this today and it turned out very well! I did have to add a little more milk and also added a little vanilla. Worked great to frost brownies with. It took a while to get it the right consistency but since I was using a stand mixer I was able to just get it going and let it do the work.

Maybe because I used natural peanut butter it didn't seem to fluff so I ended up adding 3 more table spoons of milk, it didn't seem to fluff but tasted great!

Great recipe! Followed it to a T and it worked wonderfully. I think the people who say its too thick did not beat it long enough. It really fluffs up in the last minute.

A co-worker loves the peanut butter frosted brownies (topped with chopped nuts and a chocolate swirl) made by the the Awrey Bakery Company located here in Livonia, and she wanted to know if I could duplicate the recipe. Of course I went right to Allrecipes.  I found this recipe and BINGO - the perfect Peanut Butter Frosting.  I made as directed and had no problems although I admit it is a little difficult to spread. Using a 9 x 13 pan, I found that if you put a lot of some dollops across the entire brownies (works even better if they are still barely warm) and then use a metal spatula and spread in long strokes.  I then melt chocolate with a small amount of shortening, put it in a piping bag, and drizzle the chocolate back and forth in one direction, then the other and (optional) chopped nuts. Then I cover with foil and refrigerate before serving. WOW!  This has been a hit to every party I have taken it to. Haven't tried in on cake, but great on moist brownies!

Amazing!  If your frosting is turning out too thick you either need to add more milk or you have not beat it for the full three minutes.  I have made this many times and this is the perfect amount for a 9 inch two layer cake, could scale it back a bit for cupcakes you will have a lot left over.  Love this recipe and will make it many more times!

YUM! This frosting was so good my kids and I were licking the bowl! I read some reviews after I made it and found that others stated it is a must to use butter and not margarine, I used margarine and my frosting tasted like heaven but it did not look like the picture, it looks slightly greasy. Next time I will make sure to use butter.

Great tasting recipe.  I didn't alter it at all and it was so tasty and spread very easily.  I used a piping bag with tip just to be fancy and it pipped very well.

Delicious! I did add the milk a little at a time as I added the sugar and I beat it a couple of minutes like you specified and it is super fluffy! One thing I did add was about a half teaspoon of vanilla...wonderful frosting! Thank you for sharing!

No thanks, this did not turn out for me at all.  I whipped these plenty & still had a cookie dough like consistency & it just slide right off the brownies I tried to frost.  Tasted good, but nothing like frosting.

The BEST peanut butter frosting ever...and I've tasted quite a few. It's not too sweet and it's super fluffy. Make sure and take the time to beat it for a few minutes. It makes quite a bit of frosting. Oh so good!

this is the best peanut butter icing ever! made it just like the recipe and it tastes just like the insides of my granmothers peanut butter easter eggs! it is a true peanut butter recipe and isn't going to be creamy like a buttercream icing..but for a peanut butter icing it is creamy and easy to spread. i beat the 'heck' out of it in my kitchenade and that might have helped. this is my go to recipe for peanut butter icing from now on! thanks for sharing!

Everyone loved this on the brownies I made. I took the advice of another reviewer and used less confectioners sugar. I think that was my only mistake. I creamed the peanut butter and "margarine" (was all I had) really good then added the confectioners' sugar a little at a time, constantly mixing. Also, added the milk (skim - all I had) a little at a time until I got the consistency I wanted - all the while mixing. Used more than 3 tbsp. of milk, but the recipe says as needed and I was using skim. Turned out great for me although I admit I was concerned until I started adding the milk. It was enough for 2 - 8" pans of brownies. Follow the recipe and it will turn out great for you too.

It is amazing to me that anyone could make this recipe and not give it 5 stars!!! It is fabulous, as light and fluffy as any buttercream - if you beat it for a few minutes. I sifted the powdered sugar, and beat in half and half (had it on hand) till it was the right consistency. Then beat it some more just to make it good and fluffy. :) Tastes perfect, neither too sweet or greasy. Excellent on Black Magic cake. Wonderful, super easy recipe.

This recipe is spot-on!  I had NO trouble with it and it came out exactly as described by Nickie75.  If you are having problems with this recipe turning out correctly it is something you did wrong and not a problem with the recipe.  If it says to use butter, use butter. I frosted brownies with this recipe and took them to work.  Everyone wanted the recipe and some people were upset that they were all gone before they came on shift.  AWESOME is all I can say : )

SO incredible! If you are a pb lover, this is a must. A prior review or two indicated it did not come out fluffy. You really need to mix it for no less than the time it calls for in the recipe to get it to that light fluffy consistency. I also used 1 exta T of milk (actually, used 1/2 milk and 1/2 of half & half).This was probably the best pb topping on brownies I ever had. Since there was some left over, I refrigerated for a while, then rolled them into balls and dipped in dark chocolate.  Mmmmm!!!!

Amazing! 1) The directions to "add milk as needed" is key to getting this to turn out. I halved the recipe and still used three tablespoons of milk in just half a batch. (If yours does not turn out don't give a bad rating to this recipe. You did something wrong. :o) ) 2)I used SOY milk and it turned out perfect. HALF of the recipe covered 18 cupcakes.

This was really good.  I made the recipe exactly as written and it came out perfectly.  Today was my husband's birthday and he wanted brownie cupcakes with peanut butter frosting.  So I used this for the frosting and another recipe on the site called Brownie Cups.  They were perfect together.  If anyone had problems with this being greasy make sure you use butter, not margarine and do not over soften.  I used about 3 1/3 tablespoons of milk and it was the perfect consistency to pipe onto the cupcakes.  Thanks!

The perfect balance of peanut buttery sweetness! I had to fiddle with the recipe a little, as I had no confectioners sugar and knew better than to just substitute white and end up with the grittiest frosting this side of the Mississippi, so I heated the milk in the microwave and dissolved the sugar into it, halving it to 1 cup because white sugar is more potent. It all came together well, but had to be refrigerated before spreading because the heated milk made it quite runny. It set up nicely, though, and a quick fork-whip perked it right up to the perfect frosting texture, in my opinion. Smooth and easily spreadable (and it even got a little pleasantly gooey [but not runny] on my still-warm cake and made it feel very wonderfully decadent). I just can't give 5 stars because I diverted from the original recipe.

I made the recipe as written. I like peanut butter...I really do as does my 11 year old - who, 'mind you, likes EVERYTHING sweet...and most everything not sweet. But even he said no thank you to a second cupcake. We did not care for this recipe at all. I guess you have to practically LOVE peanut butter to tolerate this frosting. I really wanted to like this...it's just overpowering on devil's food cake.

I cannot figure out what I did wrong!! I followed the recipe exactly as written and came out with spot-on flavor but a very peculiar texture. I don't know if my hand held mixer just couldn't get the job done or what but the flavor is amazing enough that I'll try it again!!

GREAT RECIPE! I am not a frosting fan so I thought I would try this since it is said to not be as sweet as typical frosting! LOVE IT! Had to throw the remainser away after repeatedly trying to eat it straight with a spoon!!! I will say that I added much more milk than the recipe called for. Definetly do as the recipe states and slowly add the powdered sugar and milk. Then just keep slowly adding about 1 tbls of milk at a time until you reach your desired consitency. I think I ended up adding about 7 tbls.

Made this today and really liked it.  I did add a bit more milk to make it like I wanted it.  I even used a lower quality peanut butter.  Yum....goes really good on that Devils food cake I just made.

This recipe is to die for! We all loved it.....I did follow the review of Cyndie Schneider for the perfect results....please look for it for the perfect Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting! The only change I made was to use milk instead of heavy cream. This frosting was so peanut buttery, creamy, fluffy and totally spreadable. I had no problems with gritty-ness, greasy-ness or anything else. I topped a 9x13 dark double fudge cake (boxed mix....Duncan Hines of course) and had beautiful results. My friend just texted me for the recipe! A winner! Thanks!

Just like my mother always made!  My mom used to make this frosting on chocolate cake when I was a child, she usually added walnuts to half.  It's perfect!  I used all generic ingredients and I had no problem whatsoever.  The frosting was fluffy, easy to spread and just the right mix of peanut- butter -sweet!

Excellent recipe! Whip for longer than you might want to--it's worth it! Add more liquid if necessary--recipes won't necessarily be exactly how you prefer them. I thought it worked out VERY well and went nicely on brownies topped with a mini-reeses. YUM!

This by far is one of the best frosting/icing recipes I have made.  I can never get them to turn out right.  I followed the recipe like it said and let it whip on high speed on my Kitchen Aide for a good 3-5 minutes.  It is very tasty, even the dogs agree! (i let them lick the whip!)  I am now waiting for the brownies to get done baking so I can try it on them.  Thanks for a great recipe. *UPDATE* So yummy on the brownies!  I had quite a bit left over so I put it on sliced apples. I always like peanut butter and apples for a snack, but this was even better.

Super yummy!  As other reviewer have said, be sure to have everything at room temp, quality of peanut butter is also a must, do not skimp and use low-quality peanut butter.

Great texture and flavor. I made sure the butter was room temp and really whipped it up with the PB. I then added about 1 cup of the sugar slowly. Then I added a little milk to make it a bit over moist. I really whipped it up and if got really fluffly. I then mixed in the rest of the sugar. It came out perfect and I love that it's not to sweet.

I softened the butter, left the milk out at room temperature and added powdered sugar 1/2 cup at a time, then added a bit of milk to get a good consistency.  However, I didn't feel that there was enough peanut butter flavor, so I added probably about 1/2 cup more total, along with extra milk.  This was VERY light and fluffy, and more than adequate for a 2-layer 8 inch cake.  Also, delicious and not too heavy.  I will be making this again!

Delicious, smooth, and fluffy just like the title says. Make sure to add the ingredients slowly and beat the entire mixture a good 3 minutes to achieve the spreadable/pipeable consistency. These were great piped atop brownies.

I've made peanut butter frosting many times before and never received compliments.  Tried this recipe and everyone was commenting on how creamy and tasty it was.  They even asked what was in it.  Definitely a keeper!!

This is absolutely the best peanut butter frosting EVER!! I've made it over and over again and it always turns out fluffy and delicious. The only change I make to the recipe is to use half and half or heavy cream instead of milk. Gives it even more fluff. I usually top brownies with the frosting and when I take them to work or a picnic all you hear is YUM!! It melts in your mouth!!

I was a little disappointed that mine didn't end up fluffy like the picture shows.  Mine just turned out greasy.  If someone knows how to make it fluffy I might use this recipe again and if not I will not use this again.

I did not make this as written but instead used less sugar and more milk so as to make syrup for Banana Pancakes I from this site. It was so good! I think if I hadn't added milk, it would have set up beautifully for frosting, so I'm giving this frosting a 5 for flavor even though I didn't use it as frosting :) EDIT: Update! Made it again, as frosting. It worked beautifully but you do have to be careful with the wet/dry ratio and adjust. Be flexible. Don't just dump the ingredients in your Kitchenaid all at once and then call the recipe a failure--add them gradually the way the recipe recommends. Humidity and brand of peanut butter DO affect how much liquid or sugar this recipe will need!

I think I used a few more tbs of milk, but I eyeballed the ingredients so might have used more than 2 c of powdered sugar too.

I used a little less powdered sugar and a little extra milk, which I think helped it spread easier.  It was fluffy and oh so good!

Great frosting! Perfect consistency and great not-too-sweet flavor. Make sure to add the sugar and milk alternately so you don't add too much of either!

This was excellent!  To make it easier to spread, just continue to add milk until it is to the consistency you want.  So easy to make and excellent with anything chocolate!

This is the best peanut butter frosting and so quick and easy to make. The first time I made it I accidentally made it with 1 cup of butter instead of a 1/2 cup and it was so light and fluffy but I didn't realize I made a mistake the first time until I made it a second time and it wasn't as fluffy or as easy to spread but still tasted great. I guess if you don't mind the extra calories the mistake way was fluffier. Good recipe!

Delicious! I actually didn't have enough PB on-hand, so used only a half cup of PB. To make up for the shortage, I added a spoonful of Nutella and a dollop of whipped cream cheese for some added flavor. Excellent turn-out! My son and I couldn't stop licking the bowl and mixer ;-)

The flavor was great!  Not too strong, but definitely peanut butter. I found it a little difficult to spread, however... even after adding more liquid.

I Loved this recipe.  Although the first time I made it I messed up and only used 1/2 cup of peanut butter.  To me, it tasted better with only half of the peanut butter - a much lighter taste & a lot fluffier.  I made it by the recipe the second time & it was a lot thicker and to my family, not as tasty.

Great texture and peanut butter taste. This frosting is not very sweet. If you are looking for a sweeter frosting, you could increase the sugar up to double the amount called for. But it is also quite good as is. I spread it on graham crackers.

Very yummy and not to sweet. I put it on some brownies, and was the perfect match.

Very good, not too sweet and has a great peanut butter taste. Make sure to beat it extra long so it will fluff up.

This is outstanding on chocolate cake!!  My family members were fighting for the last piece!  I used fat free 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk and I do agree that the ingredients work best when at near room temperature.

This recipe was big on pb flavor but it was extremely difficult to spread.  I gave up on spreading, put it in a decorator's bag and piped it onto my cupcakes.  Tasted great but I think I'll see if i can find something that will spread a little easier.

I was disappointed with this frosting.  I scaled the recipe down to frost 8 cupcakes, and used reduced fat peanut butter and skim milk as they were all I had on hand.  I added the powdered sugar and milk alternately, then beat well for 3-4 minutes.  The taste was good, but my frosting wasn't "fluffy" at all, and had a definte greasy sheen.  Maybe using whole milk of cream would fluff it up better?

I was worried sick when preparing to make this for a friend's favorite birthday cake. When it started getting 'grain-y' I just added a bit more milk....it was smooth as silk. I can't wait to taste it after it's been in the fridge overnight!! I agree with a prior rater...if I loved peanut butter icing, I would probably give it a '5' also. Clearly no fault to the recipe or the creator, just my preference in frosting ;)

Great tasting and EASY to prepare. Just make sure to use shelf-stable peanut butter and not the all-natural, peanuts only that needs to be refrigerated after opening. The latter makes for a stickier and harder to manage frosting especially with layers. Things may sllllide a little.

This frosting tastes very good, but its texture is that of a very soft fudge, making it impossible to spread. I was able to smoosh it down on cupcakes, but I couldn't imagine spreading this on a cake. Also, it has a very oily appearance. For a smoother frosting, I made my second batch with less butter and more milk and got a more spreadable, less oily looking frosting.

Perfect!  Just what I was looking for.  My son wanted a chocolate cake with chocolate buttercream frosting and peanut butter filling in the middle.  This frosting worked perfectly as the "filling".  I just used half the recipe.  This will be my go-to peanut butter frosting from now on.

This frosting is absolutely delicious! The texture is incredibly fluffy, if you want the texture of an icing you buy in a store, definitely add a little more milk. Personally, I think the texture and flavor of the icing make it almost dreamy. This icing is definitely perfect for anyone who has a sweet tooth, but also loves the saltiness of peanut butter. I frosted brownies with this and they're amazing. I bet this frosting would also be devine on banana cake or just spread on saltines!

I made this frosting to go with a Dark Chocolate Cake, and it was perfect! Just as the description said...not too sweet, and definitely not too greasy! It is JUST the right amount of peanut butter so it's not crazy overwhelming. I also crushed up some Peanut Butter Cups and sprinkled them on the top of the cake, and it was great...made the cake a bit more fancy :)It was delicious, and this recipe is definitely going into my recipe box!

i frosted chocolate cupcakes and they turned out delicous!  However, i added about 5 tablespoon of mile and my frosting was very fluffy, it didnt look anywhere near as creamy as the picture.  great for cupcakes but i dont think they would do well for frosting a cake.  super yummy though!

Yummy and fluffy!!
I read many reviews that said it was too thick, wouldn't spread, etc. I found that I had to add more than 3 tbsp. milk. If you add enough milk and mix it for the stated time IT WILL BE FLUFFY!! 
I also added more peanut butter than it called for and it still only had a subtle peanutbutter flavor, which was good with the cake I put it on. But if you want a strong peanutbutter flavor, you should choose a different recipe.

Excellent!  I made it just as instructed except for adding a teaspoon of vanilla.  It was fluffy, and not too sweet, with a nice peanut butter flavor.  My husband just announced he'll be eating spoonfuls of it!  :)

This is a keeper! Wonderful texture. Just enough peanut butter flavor to enhance any cake. I used it on a chocolate cake and loved it!
I did use extra crunchy peanutbutter as I like the crunch. Kids could make this with ease and have fun. Next time I think I will buy a richer tasting peanut butter just for a change and see if I like it better.

Yum!!!  I put this on chocolate cupcakes and my family couldn't keep their hands off them!  I loved the frosting because it wasn't too sweet...it didn't have that powdered sugar taste that a lot of peanut butter frosting does.  This frosting is to die for!!

Tasted good, but I must agree with others that said this did not spread like frosting and was a little greasy.  I followed the directions perfectly--that was not the problem.  It may be helpful to include the brand of peanut butter since this seems to be reoccuring.  Otherwise, it was yummy.

Very good and very easy! I used this for the filling for a dark chocolate, double layer cake. I used about 1/2 for the filling and then frosted the cake with dark chocolate frosting and used the rest of the pb frosting to decorate the cake with.

The frosting was yummy! I added a splash of vanilla and only needed a little splash of milk. Came out perfect!

A good recipe.  I am not a fan of peanut butter but I love frosting.  My husband is a fan of peanut butter but not frosting so I put this on brownies.  It makes a lot of frosting, I only put a thin layer on to satisfy us both.  It is good, nice texture.

My daughter and I tasted the Barefoot Contessa chocolate cupcakes with peanut butter frosting and almost bought the mix because we liked it so much. Looking at the price, however, we decided to try our luck at home.  We didn't like this frosting as much as in the mix, but it was good.  I think that the difference was the Contessa's was more creamy than fluffy and had more of a peanut butter flavor.  The chocolate/ peanut butter combo is a winner, however, so I will make this again and adjust the amount of peanut butter to taste.

Fantastic!  Was very fluffy and bursting with peanut butter flavor.  It was not ugly, like one reviewer said.  After beating for the full three minutes it was light and very fluffy.  I used it on a chocolate peanut butter marble cake (from this web-site) and it was amazing.  I imagine that it would also be good on chocolate cupcakes.

i'm not a fan of peanut butter, but my my my this icing is amAAAAAzing.  i used it to frost a four layer cake that i smashed out of frustration because it wasn't cooperating; nonetheless, i saved the remaining icing and i'm either going to top it on ice cream, or eat it alone - which i think is best (that is saying a lot for someone who prefers not to put peanut butter in a pb&j sandwich).

It is a great recipe, I have to admit I added alittle more peanut butter, and it came out to about 3/4-Cup to a whole cup  total and 1/8 tsp vanilla. Also more milk, till it was creamy and moist enough to spread on the cake. Even though I did some adjusting it is a good frosting.

I continue to make this peanut butter frosting and it is a success every time. Beating it a long time will result in a wonderfully fluffy frosting. It seems that on some days I need to add just a bit of milk, maybe a tsp. or so...

This was exactly like the intro reads...light and fluffy, not overpowering.  I put it on my zucchini brownies and it was the perfect match. Frosting generously, there was still about 1/3 C left to do graham crackers for snack tomorrow!  This one goes in my favorites!  Thanks!

WOW--this frosting is amazing. I frosted the Chocolate Pound Cake III (found on this site) and it was absolutely devine. It was SO rich all you needed was one small slice and a glass of milk and you were in heaven. So positively perfect, I won't use any other frosting on my chocolate cakes from now on.

This is the best peanut butter frosting.  It's not greasy or gritty like most, I added vanilla and cut the confectioners sugar a bit.

This is my fav peanut butter frosting to make. It’s very light and not terribly sweet which I enjoy. Really goes great on everything. My latest was making it to go on homemade sugar cookies. Yum!

great frosting.  super duper fluffy.  used real butter and extra crunchy peanut butter, both at room temperature produced a beautifully light and fluffy peanut-y frosting.  I sift my confectioner's sugar to add air to it and break up clumps.  added just a few drops of caramel extract to compliment.  frosted a depression era chocolate cake.

Turned out perfect.  I beat the butter and peanut butter together until no butter visible.  Then added all the confectioner's sugar until well incorporated and then the milk and beat for about 3 minutes.  Served on a peanut butter cake.

Love this recipe! For softened butter, I put stick of butter in the microwave for 15 seconds. I use a Kitchenaid mixer to mix everything.  When I have half and half or heavy cream in the fridge, I substitute that for milk (we only have skim milk :( ), and fat makes it even better.  We put it on brownies, and wow, my teenage kids say literally, "wow!."

It taste great. Only thing. It must have been me or something. I followed the directions exactly and I had to add a lot more milk to get it spreadable. But once I did it tasted great. Not to sweet like I thought it might be. Will use again.

Absolutely LOVE this recipe! I don't usually like peanut butter icing but this one is to die for!  If you are icing a cake with it, you will need to double the recipe.  Then you can eat the excess after frosting the cake! :)

Just made this to go on a mayo cake.  Perfect. So yummy.  Nice and creamy  and good peanut flavor.  I didn't use milk but coffee instead , just enough to thin to spreadable consistancy.

SO good! Would recommend making extra (I doubled it) since this is dense it doesn’t go very far in terms of spreading it.

I found that the trick to get spreadable icing was to gradually add more cream when the mixture starts to split. With my mixer beating fast, i would add a small drizzle (like 1/2 tsp at a time) until it was loose again. With this process, i was able to turn this from yummy paste to properly whipped icing for a layer cake. 

It does take patience! My first attempt was like paste. if this happens to you - add a bit of dairy and whip more

Looking for a different PB frosting recipe, I ran across this one and it was hit with my picky PB fanatics.  Followed the recipe and found it still a little stiff so I put in a couple tsp of heavy cream and whipped the heck out it on no 6 on my KitchenAid.  Result:  FABULOUS light, creamy yummy frosting that spread like a dream on my "Matilda" chocolate cake and made my hubby a happy man.

Good recipe...I used homemade PB and added sugar to taste because I do not like frosting that is too sweet. I I cut the recipe in half for a small cake and only needed a 1/4 cup of sugar. I did not need to add any milk, very creamy and it easily spread on the cake.

Delicious, I made it in smaller quantity and pinch of vanilla. You must leave all ingredients room temperature (in our house we don't like putting peanut butter in the fridge) if you want it very smooth.

Made 1/2 the recipe with a splash if vanilla extract and it is so good.  Did all room temp ingrediants followed directs to a t and became very fluffy in the end like it said
  1/2 recipe was exactly enough to cover large pan of brownies.

This frosting is DELICIOUS.  So good, I could eat it by itself! 
I didn't make any modifications to the recipe.  
Easy to make and easy to spread.  I am adding this to my recipe book of favorite recipes!

This frosting was amazing!  I followed someone else's suggestion and used a hand mixer in order not to overbeat it, and my frosting didn't break at all.  Very happy with the flavor and consistency!  I added 2 tsp of cocoa powder to mine because I need them to be more brown to fit my "Oh " themed party.  So yeah, my photos are the  emoji-looking ones.  Still tasted great ;)

This was fluffy, delicious, perfect. I wanted a simple, smooth peanut butter frosting that was not TOO rich to put on some basic chocolate cupcakes and chose this one and I am far from disappointed. I actually don't love the chocolate cake recipe I used and this frosting is so good that I think it saved them. I had to force myself to throw out the little extra bit I had because I probably could've eaten with a spoon and I am someone who scrapes icing off cake more often than not. I guarantee I will make this again.

I  am using it for a filling  pb&j cake  . Doubled recipe only used  3 cups sugar....tasting as I go. Adding vanilla and a pinch of salt n 1 more cup of PB. Added more milk as needed to get it smooth. I am one who wants to taste the "flavor" not the sugar. Plus it is going to be a sweet jelly.

This recipe should just be called easy peanut butter fudge because that’s what you get. There is no fluffy. There will be no no perfect little mountains on top of your cupcakes.  Just unspreadable fudge like texture. Don’t get me wrong it’s super good, but it isn’t frosting. I mean you can’t really go too wrong with putting peanut butter fudge on top of a cake.

Made with walnut milk and confectioner's sugar to taste (less than called for). 1/2 the recipe was enough for 12 regular sized cupcakes. Whipped the frosting like whipping cream with a hand mixer until fluffy and after frosting, put cupcakes in the fridge to "set". Delicious and perfect texture/consistency!

This is really good, as long as you do it correctly. Whip softened butter until fluffy, then beat in the peanut butter until fluffy again, then add the powdered sugar until your desired sweetness/consistency. I omitted the milk because I wanted a stiff consistency for piping. I also used unsalted butter, but then did add about 1/2 tsp of sea salt to balance the sweetness. Really delicious, fluffy, not greasy, and not too sweet.

It tastes AMAZING!! I was short on butter so I substituted 1/4 cup of the required 1/2 cup of butter with coconut oil. I used a bit more milk than what was recommended as well but it worked perfectly! The texture isn’t spot and it doesn’t look exactly like normal frosting on but it spreads as i would expect and it melts in your mouth!

I made this to frost some brownies for hubby’s 70th birthday. This is the best peanut butter frosting recipe I have tried. My very minor variations were: a heaping cup of pb and only one tbsp of heavy cream. It came out creamy and smooth with a rich peanut butter taste. I could have halved the recipe for the brownies. I guess I will have to make a 9x12 cake this week.

I tried this hack - PB Powder instead of straight PB! Replace some of confectioner's sugar w/ PB powder (found w/ PB in store).  I can't say exact amount, I 'm thinking you can adjust to your taste. I came out with a subtle PB / buttery flavor that was fantastic!

Definitely on the thicker side but that is what I wanted for my peanut butter cup cupcakes. Paired with milk chocolate cupcakes and garnished with half a Reese cup it was perfection.

I had to make this frosting twice, because the first time I was sure I'd done something wrong (I hadn't). Both times I followed the  recipe closely and both times it was more like dough than frosting.  I couldn't even spread it, much less squeeze it through a frosting bag. I used natural peanut butter that was unmixed without added oil, so I wonder if that's why it was such a dramatic difference from the fluffy smooth frosting shown in the picture. The only reason that I didn't give this one star is because it does taste good. I think it is better suited to be eaten on graham crackers than to frost a cake or cupcakes.

Delicious!  We added a little more milk however.  It wasn't quite creamy enough with just the 3 tablespoons.

Great peanut butter flavor! I did tweak the recipe a bit to make it easier to pipe. I used 1 1/2 cups of icing sugar instead of the full two cups, and I used heavy cream in place of milk.  This recipe is a keeper!

Easy, delicious and piped on easily.
I used a butter recipe cake mix. Only used 1/2 the water and about 3/4 cup of peanut butter. Before baking sprinkled with a little chopped Hershey bar. 
Topped with this delicious frosting and topped with chopped miniature Reese’s peanut butter cups. 
Fast easy and extremely delicious!

Waaaaaay too sweet. I added less than one cup of powdered sugar and it was good. There was no need to add milk with the smaller amount either, and where’s the salt?! It needs a pinch of salt too.

After reading several reviews, I followed this recipe but used heavy cream in place of milk and Teddie Super Chunky All Natural Peanut Butter. I needed much more than the 3 tbsp of milk and just added a little more at a time until the consistency was what it needed to be. The flavor is fantastic. I made the "too much chocolate cake" recipe from this sight into 2 - 9" layers and used this to fill and frost. It's currently in the fridge until I am ready to pour the chocolate ganache I want to finish my cake with. This is definitely a keeper. Thank you.

I will make it again but for brownies or cup cakes.  Too stiff for cake.  I added, 2tsp vanilla, 1 TBLS Shortening and 1 TBLS butter to cream it more.  Tastes great just not fluffy or creamy.

I beat mine for several minutes. Actually I turned the mixer on and got caught up doing something else! Doing that is not usually a great idea but it worked out well for this recipe. The frosting was very light and fluffy.

Wow, amazingly simple and just as delicious! I made it for a chocolate cake which contains coffee, so I added in some coffee flavor to the frosting. Instead of 3 Tbs milk, I used 1 tsp Kona instant coffee, 1 Tbs brewed coffee and 2 Tbs heavy whipping cream. I added 3 Tbs worth of the liquid mixture. Even in Hawaii, this recipe is perfect, not too stiff, not too runny. The flavor is outstanding (I used Mara Natha peanut butter).

This frosting was delicious! I would definitely add the full amount of cream/milk and more as needed because I did have a hard time piping it. It also helped to microwave it slightly with a tablespoon of milk before piping

This is the best peanut butter frosting!!!
I added a bit more confectioners sugar (to finish the bag) and a bit more milk, and it still was perfect. 
Frosted a white cake this time, and can’t wait to try on brownies.  This is a keeper!

I followed the recipe exactly, except I only had almond milk. I don't know if that's why I had issues. It didn't turn out a creamy consistency at all. It has a grainy texture. I tried the microwave trick, but it didn't work. It tasted ok, but since it was for a birthday cake, I can't use it.

Soooo, soooo, soooo good! I may not have used the full amount of sugar but it was way sweet enough.  Yes, room temperature is valuable. Soooo good! If you love peanut butter like I do, you will not be disappointed.  I garnished with dark chocolate chips.  Yummylicious!

I forgot to add in my first review that I melted the butter instead of using it soft. I've learned that it helps make the icing fluffy and easy to spread.

Used real butter and real peanut butter ( knowing it would be less sweet) had to add extra milk to even get it to icing consistency- overly greasy and tasted of just gritty sugar. Gross

Update- used  Skippy, this frosting is the best frosting I have ever had. WORLD of a difference!

This was amazing!!! And as a peanut butter addict, I'd like to think I know a thing or two about good peanut butter treats. This tasted like the insides of a reese's, only fluffier. Nom.

I did play a little with the milk and powdered sugar (added more of both than the recipe called for). I just played with it until I got the consistency I was going for. I used JIF peanut butter. And I used Land-O-Lakes European Style salted butter. Paired it with the "Too Much Chocolate Cake" recipe. It was DELICIOUS!

Worked out great!  Used it to frost a 2 layered round cake.  Did a knock-on off Portillos chocolate cake and used this frosting instead of the regular chocolate...would also look great decorating with Peanut Butter Cups!

I loved this frosting. Simple to make(which i love like most other busy moms) but delicious! I would definitely make this again.  Next time I think I'll use it in on a layered chocolate cake instead of a 13×9 in like i did this time.

This frosting tastes delicious, straight from the bowl!  I did end up adding a tad bit more milk and then used it on a Hershey's Perfectly Chocolate Cake, which I decorated with different sized Reese's Cups.   It looked and tasted amazing!

It was harder to pipe at first, but got better as I progressed through the frosting stage. It may be easier to spread than pipe, but I did not try. It did taste very good. I would make it again if I needed/wanted to.

I thought this recipe would be very sweet. Turns out that it was perfect. My husband is a peanut butter lover and he was crazy for it. I put it on a vanilla cupcake. I didn’t have to change a thing. Just make sure that you mix it long enough to get it fluffy for spreading.

Made it as per the recipe. Tasty and nice color. Terrible speadability. It is like trying to spread wet cement. I will never try it for a cake again.  It may be fine if piped onto brownies or cupcakes. It is quite dry and did not adhere to the cake. A bit disappointing.  I even tried adding more milk and whipping it on high speed to get a more creamy consistency. It helped a little but not enough.

I followed the recipe almost exactly. I added 1 and a half tsp of vanilla extract to yum it up more. This was an excellent recipe and it turned out creamy and smooth. This is a new favorite in my house!

I feel bad giving this 2 stars because I guess it’s me, something I’m doing wrong... the first time I made this it was incredible. Piped well and sold out in minutes at my work bake sale. I’ve tried again innumerable times, and I just can’t figure out what I’m doing wrong but this is nothing but weird paste. It won’t even spread, let alone pipe. (You kinda have to pipe it, otherwise it looks like.... you know!) I can’t do anything with it. I’ve tested every suggestion, followed the recipe to a T, and I’m stumped. Incredibly frustrating... especially because I’ve been asked to make them again for years and I cannot recreate their elusive one-time perfection! It never reaches the “light” colour some describe.

I have made this a few times now with mixed results.  Flavor is great but texture was inconsistent.  It didn't work when I tried to beat it in the food processor: it was pasty and it separated.  It worked great when I put real softened butter, PB, and confectioners sugar in a bowl, beat that briefly with a hand held mixer, then added the milk to thin it out.  I needed more milk than recipe called for to make it fluffy.  Great on top of chocolate brownies and with a chocolate drizzle.

It needs vanilla for my taste but besides that, a good balance. Make sure to whip the butters really well first in your Kitchenaid  before adding sugar. After the milk stage whip it again well.

So amazing! My husband says to put a 1 star because the urge to eat the whole bowl just as is is out of control. So good I seriously could.

Add another victim to the greasy, blobby result list. I followed the recipe exactly, using all-natural-have-to-stir-in-the-oil PB and 2% milk. I also live in Honolulu with no air conditioning, which I suspect may have something to do with my results. Heat and humidity seem to mess with a lot of the things I try to make, often in unexpected ways -- problems I never had before I transplanted myself from the northern Midwest. I haven't seen any of the others with poor results comment on their climate or kitchen conditions (or any of the successful bakers either, for that matter) but I wonder if this explains the dichotomy in the results.  In the end, I mixed in some supermarket brand "peanut butter spread" (i.e. peanut butter with added sugar, oil, and stabilizers) and it kind came together enough to use -- but was neither fluffy nor spreadable, just a thick paste that oozed across the top of the cake.

Great recipe! I only had powdered peanut butter which worked just fine and wasn't too creamy and therefore I didn't need to add any milk. Frosting was easy to work with and surprisingly wasn't too sweet. I used on a tiered devil's food cake and now that I know the frosting isn't very sweet next time I will use on a decadent fudge cake that could use a little subduing.

You can not go wrong with this, if you are a peanut butter lover you'll love this! Just put it on your chocolate cupcakes and make them mini cupcakes and they will be amazing (I recommend Martha Stewart's chocolate cupcake recipe with this).

The taste was good.  The consistency was "sticky" and pulled up cake as I tried to spread it.  It was more like peanut butter fudge.  Need to spread VERY quickly before it cools.

Awesome recipe. I doubled it to put on a devils food layer cake and have enough left over to frost a batch of brownies.  I used Jif whipped Peanut butter so it was extra fluffy.  It wasn't oily at all. I added 3  3/4 cups of powdered sugar,  and only 3 tablespoons of milk and it was perfect. Definitely a keeper.

I chose this recipe, because of the note that it wasn't greasy (I didn't want a grease pile on top of my cupcakes. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. Granted, it was warm in my kitchen, but not overly so, and the icing was way too thick (I pushed it through cake decorating tips) and it separated when it came out--half buttery oil, half chunky substance.

TASTE-wise, this was delicious, but because I couldn't get a good texture, I don't think I'll be using this recipe again.

I always read reviews before making it. This was a very simple recipe to follow and turned out perfect, i even doubled the recipe. I prefer less sweet and more peanut butter taste so I was wasn't exact when I measured the sugar and heavy handed with the peanut butter. Easy to spread and use in the pastry bag for the cupcakes.

I have made this frosting several times and it is awesome! Maybe not as creamy as it looks in the picture but definitely YUM! I also have a pet peeve with all the negative reviews. Natural peanut butter people, really? Don't bother making CAKE if you're going healthy, duh.

I would leave zero stars but one is the lowest you can put. I'm staying with family out of town and decided to make a favorite for the fam. I make a homemad chocolate bunt cake with creamy delicious peanut butter frosting. My recipe I normally use is at home so I looked one up on line and do to the good reviews used this one. Next time I will skip it and try another because this was disappointing to say the least. I followed the recipe which is supper basic to a t and it came out horrible. 10 people tried and all 10 agreed it was nasty tasted like I just dumped play sugar in some peanut butter, the consistency was horrible not fluffy at all more like wet peanut butter and the taste just awful. If you want a good peanut butter frosting skip this one and find another.

I thought that this was an awful lot of sugar for the amount of peanut butter / butter, so I started with one.cup. That seemed sweet enough for me, especially since it was going on top of chocolate cake. And I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract.  I'll make this again. Next time I will use 3/4 cup of butter and 3/4 cup of PB.

This was amazing! I followed the suggestions of others and made sure the butter was totally softened and almost melted before mixing in any other ingredients, and also added the confectioners sugar very slowly. The flavor was amazing and the consistency turned out perfectly.

It's perfect. The best frosting for a chocolate cake! For those people who had trouble spreading it, maybe you should whip it more/faster. Mine was fluffy and easy to spread after whipping it with the beater attachment for my food processor.

Great, easy recipe. 2 cups of sugar seemed a little sweet, so I opted for 1.5 cups. Still slightly on the sweet side with the .5 reduction, but still good. 

If you're not privy to really sweet and rich deserts, I'd start at 1 cup and work my way up in .25 cup increments until you get the desired sweetness.

Too much peanut butter, it was really overwhelming and heavy. After whipping the frosting to the point it was actually fluffy and able to spread it looked almost broken and just ugly, would probably look better if you use a frosting bag and decorative tip because even when spreadable this will not look smooth. If I make this again I will use a 50/50 ratio on the butter and peanut butter.

Made exactly the way the recipe reads. This frosting probably cannot be applied in the usual fashion because it is peanut butter and use of a decorator tube might be preferred. The amount it makes is another story. I had an 8" layer cake with a layer of ice cream in the middle and barely had enough to cover the cake. The frosting is delicious, light & fluffy.

I made this after not being able to find some peanut butter frosting I previously saw at the store. It's so easy, especially with a stand mixer (I have a cheap Sunbeam brand, no need for KitchenAid). It's light and not overly sweet, probably the complete opposite of the one I was gonna buy. I put them on chocolate cupcakes, topped them with chocolate sprinkles and my boyfriend immediately devoured 3 of them.  Next, I'll try them on brownies!!

Both easy and delicious! I used cream instead of milk but either is fine I'm sure.  As indicated in the recipe, I thought it needed a bit more than 3T so added a splash more.

Amazing frosting. I used it on Banana Muffins. YUMMY! I used half the amount of powdered sugar and found it very easy to spread.

I followed the recipe EXACTLY and am not impressed. This calls for way too much peanut butter! You need to nearly double the confectioners sugar and milk to get anything even closely resembling frosting. Bummed.

This frosting on a devil's food cake was the hit of the birthday party.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract.  It was fluffy and wonderful.

I made this to top the Chocolate cake part of the Chocolate Peanut Butter Wacky cake, instead of the topping the recipe calls for. The icing was a HIT!!! Everyone at the part raved about it. I made it exactly as the recipe called for and had extra to lick off the spoon.

A great creamy, sweet, and peanut buttery frosting that practically glides onto a cake! The frosting keeps the peanut butter flavor, while adding a sweet note from the confectioners sugar.  Totally amazing!

Excellent recipe!  A friend at work "ordered" dark chocolate brownies with peanut butter frosting since I got a new stove - ha ha - so I tried this for the frosting and it turned out great!  She said it was the best she has ever had!

I made the frosting by the recipe and it was delicious but it turned out more like the inside of a peanut butter cup. Not frosting like at all. Maybe it needed more milk? I could actually pick it up and roll it in my hands without it sticking. Not sure where I went wrong but it was tasty in a chocolate cake so there's that.

I added one Tbsp of vanilla to the peanut butter and butter in the beginning. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. After whipping the peanut butter, butter and vanilla, I added the 2 cups of powdered sugar half cup at a time alternating with the 3 tablespoons of milk one tablespoon at a time. Then set my kitchen aid mixer to four and let it run until the frosting was fluffy and the graininess was gone. Turned out perfect! Spread like whipped cream. Perfect!

Basically the perfect peanut butter frosting. It's sweet without being too sweet and it's not heavy-it's wonderful! I use it on chocolate cake recipe I also got from here and both were amazing together!

Oh my gosh, I could live on this frosting! It has a perfect flavor, even if you love peanut butter. I  added 4 tablespoons of milk and it had just the right texture - not too soft or stiff, and I did not have to refrigerate it, as one reviewer mentioned. I will definitely make this recipe again, maybe using Nutella, like one reviewer did. Great recipe!

Very, very delicious! This was probably one of the best homemade icing recipes I have ever made. I followed the recipe without any major alterations, using "Simply Jif" creamy peanut butter and 3 T heavy cream instead of milk. The sweetness and consistency were perfect. Make sure to whip this icing really well! I used an electric hand mixer and pretty much whipped it up until my arm gave out. But it certainly made a difference in the fluffiness. Tastes great with chocolate cupcakes! :)

Great frosting and not too sweet.  Just be careful with how long you beat it because the first time I made it was overworked and clumpy very quickly.

I followed the directions, except I did use room temperature milk, and ingredient list as written. It did turn out fluffy and not greasy at all. The frosting spread easily at room temperature. 

I give the taste 4 stars, the 5 star was given for the ease of making the frosting.

I will make this again.

It took me three tries to make this work. I think the first two failures were due to not creaming the butter and PB properly and perhaps by using reduced fat PB. For my successful try I used the modifications suggested by Cyndie Scheider. Her changes were to use 1-1/4 cup PB, 1-1/2 cup powdered sugar and 3 tablespoons of cream. I creamed the butter and PB with my old Sunbeam Mixmaster on speed 7 for probably 3 minutes. I slowed down the mixer considerably to add the powdered sugar. I added the cream as she suggested and whipped it for 3-4 minutes on speed 11. Tastes good and spreads easily.

This was so yummy!! I love it on brownies and chocolate cake. Thanks so much for this super amazing recipe!! Normally I have to add a little more milk, because it is very thick but other than that it is really good.

I made no changes to this recipe. I followed all the steps as written. It turned out great!  It does not spread well but I put it in a frosting bag and piped it on 21 cupcakes just fine!  My coworkers loved it!  I used Jiff and 1% milk!

Perfect! Four ingredients, I whipped it in as little as fifteen minutes. Super creamy, not too thick, not too sweet, dull, or peanut-buttery. Blended blissfully with my chocolate cupcakes. I feel like a professional baker! Haha! 
Overall, great recipe, definitely worth a try (:

Thank you so much for this recipe! The flavor is perfect and not too sweet! I made this for my mom's chocolate birthday cake. It was very easy to mix up (I may have used a little more than 3 tablespoons of milk though) and spread on the cake. This will definitely be my go-to peanut butter frosting.

I made two batches both exactly the same. The only difference was the first batch I used Skippy Natural (no stir) peanut butter. Although it tasted great, the consistency was more like a soft fudge. There was nothing fluffy about it at all and it cracked when I put it on cupcakes.

I always read the reviews before I make any recipe, so I'm here to assure you that this recipe is full proof. No fuss. No recipe changes. Just ridiculously delicious. Make sure your butter is softened and your peanut butter in relatively fresh (no oil separation in the jar) and your frosting will be flawless. I took a few extra minutes whipping my butter and peanut butter together before adding my powdered sugar to insure fluffiness. I will make is again in a heartbeat!

I just made it. I thought this was the recipe I used the last time. Boy was I wrong. Will never use again. It was awful. I am an experienced cake decorator  and know what I'm doing.   So for me to say it's awful,  then it most definitely is.

I use this recipe all the time for my Peanut Butter Cake Balls.  I only make a minor change,  I had a Tsp of Vanilla Extract.  To me it helps smooth out the peanut butter flavor.

This frosting is light and fluffy and delicious! I added a bit more than 3 T milk, it spread very easily.

i made it slightly differently and it turned out wonderful.  i beat the butter and the peanut butter for a good 2-3 minutes. i added the sugar in four parts beating for a minute each time. i added 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/8 cup milk.  and then i beat for 6 minutes. it was super fluffy and the taste was amazing.

I made this frosting for my son's 10th birthday because he loves pb&js.  I made vanilla cupcakes and piped strawberry jam into them, frosted and put another dollop of strawberry jam on top. They were sooo cute and you could smell the peanut butter.  They problem with this recipe is that the peanut butter flavor is too overpowering.  All you could taste was peanut butter.  I wish I had made a test run batch first.

This is a great recipe, it just has a different kind of texture! I did add a tsp of vanilla and used heavy cream and it turned out delicious. Had more than enough frosting for a 13x9 inch chocolate cake. My family will love eating the leftovers by the spoonful out of the fridge!

The best recipe. Chocolate and peanut butter are my all time favorite! Frosting was amazing. Full of peanut butter flavor.  I didn't change a thing in the recipe. It was delicious on top of a devils food chocolate cake. Will definitely make this again!

This icing turned out perfect. I followed 1 reviewers advice and only beat the peanut butter and butter for 1 min 30 sec. I also replaced 2 teaspoons of the milk with vanilla. It turned out nice and creamy. I used it to frost a 9 x 13 chocolate cake.

This was super easy, and tasted delicious! I'm that girl who will always try and "tweek" a recipe to make it better, or simply make up a recipe as I go... Saying that, this recipe was perfect already! I only had to add more milk to make it spreadable. I made a round double layer Devil's Food cake and iced it up! Husband and family loved it!

Loved the recipe and how simple it was.
I made it for my grandma who loves reecees and peanut butter in general so it was perfect for her chocolate cake.
I added about half a cup more peanut butter for a stronger peanut taste and about 5 more tablespoons of milk to keep it creamy and it turned out great.

Fantastic!  I used it for my devil's food cake and I put chocolates on top and the cake was gone in about 10 min at my Bible study!  Just keep balancing the powdered sugar and milk until it's the desired consistency!

Yumm! Made this to top my mini cupcakes. Delicious! I made it like a true buttercream frosting though whipping the butter until it was white and then adding peanut butter then sugar. I didn't add any milk and added about a half cup more sugar turned out perfect!

I've tried another peanut butter frosting recipe on another site, but this is absolutely the BEST.  Light and fluffy and not too sweet.  The ratio of peanut butter to butter is the key here.  Scrumptious!

Definitey a 5 star rating. The only criticism I have for it is more milk! It will be super thick otherwise. I used probably almost triple what she recommends. Mine is super fluffy and easy to apply to my cupcakes now. 

Great recipe. Cheers

I made this exactly as written and I found that it was pea size consistency I used a hand mixer and it was struggling so I added a little more milk. till I thought it looked good. Fluffy no smooth yes. Mine could have been a little thicker. I did not use it all and put in the fridge tried to use it today and it was still spreadable not greasy and had a good taste. Will post what pictures I did take

I tried making this. I'm not the best at baking, and because I don't have the fanciest equipment, in fact I have old, low quality equipment, I didn't get the best result :( I made one batch to start and found it too moist and oily since I used natural peanut butter. I made a second batch and it turned out better. It tastes like any homemade peanut butter frosting-- delicious! I definitely recommend having milk with it!

HELP!  I've made this before and it's always been wonderful!  Today I've made two batches (the same as I've done before) and it turns to the texture of caramel.  What can I do?  It's very hot today, would this be the problem?

Made this for my son's birthday. He wanted a chocolate cake, but was undecided on the frosting. Well I decided to make a Reese's peanut butter type of cake. Made a 2 9 inch layer cake, but this frosting in the middle on on the top, then frosted sides with milk chocolate frosting. Froze some Reese's peanut butter cups, then chopped them up and sprinkled them on top on the outside rim. It is a very GOOD frosting. Everyone enjoyed it.

I will make this again and again! Tried others that were just so-so but everyone raved about this frosting.  I was very pleasantly surprised for how easy and quick it is to make!!! I noticed that many people stayed that it was impossible to frost with. They must not have read further in that you need to put milk in a Tbls at a time until you get the consistency you want.

Delicious and not greasy with the perfect amount of peanut butter.  I put this on the black magic cake recipe from this site and it was a delicious combo.

I used natural peanut butter and would recommend only mixing until everything in incorporated. Beating until fluffy makes it very difficult to work with, even when I tried adding a bit more milk. Maybe due to a lack of the extra oils/sugar in regular peanut butter? It still tastes wonderful! It huts looks pretty terrible because I had to kind of pat it onto the cake. Maybe a drizzle of ganache is in order!?!

I was worried the amount of the batter would be too much when i went to fill the cupcake liners but it turned out perfect! Using peanut butter frosting made these exceptional. I only wish I could now figure out a way to incorporate some strawberry preserves

Fantastic recipe! Followed the recipe exactly and it was the smoothest, creamiest consistency for a frosting. Excellent peanut butter taste, not too sweet and spread easily over my cake. This is a definite keeper!!

I have made this recipe for years... at least since 2010. It is my go-to frosting recipe! I finally made a username for this site so I could write a review. 
Helpful hints: 
-make sure to use butter, NOT margarine. Margarine is probably the reason why a few say it's greasy. 
-Make sure to use POWDERED sugar, not regular. Sometimes frosting recipes can use either, this is NOT one of those recipes. -If you have a stand mixer (such as a kitchenaid), it will work MUCH better for a smooth, creamy frosting. When I tried it with my handmixer, it was much thicker and very hard to spread.

 I hope this helps!

Just made this and it is delicious!  I'm not sure why other reviewers were having a spreadability issue. Mine turned out beautifully, and I made 0 changes to the recipe. Granted, I'm in Fl, and my house may be warmer than most. To state the obvious, but just zap your butter and peanut butter for a few seconds to soften it up if you having an issue. So good!

Ok, like many reviews, mine turned out very thick and not very spreadable. It's great for piping. I'm sore if I had added more milk it would have fixed that issue though. 

This tastes AMAZING! I love the strong peanut butter taste. I'm convinced that this on some dark chocolate brownies can save the world.

Absolutely delicious. Piped it onto chocolate cupcakes. The only change I made was adding a 4th tbsp of milk. Mine was still too thick to spread with 3.

Following some suggestions in the reviews here, I added 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract to the recipe, but otherwise followed it exactly. This buttercream is absolutely delicious without being necessarily too sweet or overpowering (my mom said it tasted like Reese's cups fillings, but I think it's lighter than that). I can't attest to its spreadability because I used it to fill macarons rather than spreading on cakes or cupcakes. It did seem a bit thick while piping, but I was also using a pastry bag without  a proper tip and probably made the hole too small. I definitely plan on making this again -- it's a fantastic macaron filling!

Bf and I both thought this frosting was delicious but sweeter than we'd like. Another friend loved it the way it was. Next time I'll halve the powdered sugar, then add to taste!

Delicious, creamy, and peanut buttery.  It is ESSENTIAL that your butter is room temp, and that you incorporate it into the peanut butter well before adding the confectioner's sugar. I added a little almond extract to give it a pop of flavor - will make this from now on with my peanut butter layer cake!

This frosting was fantastic. I had no issues with spreading this frosting. I made sure that everything was room temperature & I blended everything in stages to ensure it was blended well & smoothly. The flavor was amazing. I couldn't stop dipping my finger in the bowl. The only reason I didn't give this recipe 5 stars was because the peanut butter flavor seemed to wane by the second day. So its just a reason to finish your brownies or cake on the first day. Lol

This is delicious frosting!! I added a little more peanut butter cause I wanted more peanut butter flavor. 

I'm not sure why people are having problems with it.  It's an easy recipe and will come out perfect if you just follow the instructions given!

Made it just as the recipe indicates, and it is delicious.  I did make sure all ingredients were room-temp, and I beat it a good amount of time.  I used it on a 9X13 pan of brownies, and it was a generous amount.  There was even enough to throw in a bag with a pastry tip and add some embellishments!!  Will definitely use this one again.

This frosting is great! I was worried about the texture after incorporating all of the ingredients, but the trick is to whip whip whip! After whipping on my KitchenAid at high-speed for several minutes, this frosting is fluffy and spreadable.

Excellent frosting! I used fat free milk and added a tsp of vanilla. Very fluffy with great PB flavor.  It's a keeper!

I'm only giving 4/5 mostly due to my own incompetence. I used a kitchen aide stand mixer to make the frosting and a sifter to mix in the confectioners sugar, as such it didn't  process the way the video showed and never became crumbly instead just staying smooth the whole time, the end result was still delicious though it didn't spread as easily as it probably would have had I done it correctly. I chalk any negative things up to my own inexperience in the kitchen. 

The only reason this recipe doesn't have five stars is because I can't speak to quality of the properly made stuff. Though I'm sure it deserves it.

I've made this a couple times now, and it's already a favorite. The only change I made was adding just a little more milk, maybe a teaspoon, to thin it just a bit. Otherwise this recipe was perfect as written.

This frosting is fantastic. Not too sweet and beautifully fluffy. I put it on brownies I made in cupcake form. For the adults at my daughter's birthday party. Everybody simply loved them! I will absolutely be making this again!

This really is a very good recipe but after reading reviews it seems many were either giving it 5 stars or just 1 star.  I felt maybe I could offer some tips to help those who want to try it. It does come out very light and fluffy! 

 Tip #1 would be to make sure you use butter only and your butter is very, very soft. (like it sat out on the counter all day kind of soft).  I zapped mine in the microwave at 3rd power for 90 seconds,  the bottom was starting to melt. 

Tip #2 make sure you mix the butter and peanut butter enough.  After it's mixed keep beating for a couple of extra minutes so they are completely blended together. 

 Tip #3  I was short on powdered sugar so I only was able to about 1 cup. Add a small amount at a time and keep mixing! Again you really need everything to be very well mixed together for it to get smooth and fluffy.

 I did add 2 teaspoons of milk, one at a time, until I liked the fluffy smoothness.  I still have a lot of icing left over after putting it on a pan of brownies.

I feel like mine came out exactly how I wanted to but I didn't use as much powdered sugar as called for.  If I had added the second cup of powdered sugar I probably would have had to add more milk.  But with recipes with just a few ingredients like this one its easy to take it 1 step at a time and adjust for your own personal taste.
 
I think the most important things to remember are to use only really butter that is super softened and be sure to spend the  extra minutes with

Tastes amazing and very simple to make. I don't have a mixer so I mixed by hand.. Had a very sore arm afterwards but was sooo worth it. I see a few say to add vanilla honestly it is pretty sweet without I think it's just right no additions needed

Generally, I dislike frosting as it's always too sweet. Really good peanut butter frosting though, is amazing. I have made this several times now and it's the best peanut butter frosting I have ever tasted.  Well balanced and not too sweet. Follow the directions, use good peanut butter,  real butter and dont panic if you need a tiny bit more milk. Beat till fluffy. Works every time.

I decided to cut the recipe in half  but when I tried to pipe on cupcakes, the frosting was sort of dry and chunky; the frosting wouldn't go on smoothly. So I started from scratch and had to add more milk than required but ended up with a greasy spread. It tastes amazing but definitely was hard to spread as the original recipe.

I'd give this 10 stars if I could, it is absolutely everything the description says it is! I was nervous after reading some of the reviews but boy am I glad I made it.  I made it exactly as written and it tasted fabulous! The people who say it turned out poorly must not have followed the directions properly or used different ingredients than called for. My only tip is to make sure you really whip it well. You'll know it is done when it is fluffy and light in color. As frosting goes this is not overly sweet (it is still sweet but what frosting isn't) and has a great peanutbutter taste.

I've tried different peanut butter frosting recipes before and have had problems with them coming out in a clumpy mess or really greasy.  This frosting whips up light and fluffy and is SUPER easy to spread.  From now on, this will be my "go to" recipe for peanut butter frosting!

This is the BEST Peanut Butter Frosting ever! I wont use any other recipe. It makes the perfect amount for a 9 x 13 cake and it is so fluffy and melts in your mouth! Make sure to mix it for at least 2-3 minutes until it is light in color and fluffy! YUM!

This frosting was great, but definitely a bit of a pain to work with. I had to use about 6 tablespoons of milk to thin it enough to spread on a layer cake. It was still thick and sticky, but worked and tasted great.

Turned out perfectly.  It has a nice light flavor, not too sweet and the peanut butter is not overbearing. It spread easily and was the exact amount needed for a double layer 9" cake (chocolate, of course!).

I made this yesterday to frost my son's devil's food cake.  It's really good!  And very easy to make.  I did add one tsp. vanilla, and ended up using close to 1/4 cup of milk to get it to my desired consistency.  I will definitely make this again  :)

The absolute best peanut butter frosting. Great PB flavor and wonderful consistency.

For the person who said their's was much to thick, I'm not sure why, mine always turns out perfectly spreadable. I do use the full amount of milk called for but either way, it's as the recipe is written

Made as per recipe.  I covered a 9x13 inch cake and had about a cup or a bit more left over. Amazing taste, fluffy and yummm. Definitely a keeper. Thanks for this amazing peanut butter delight.

I made two batches, the only thing I changed between the two was the type of peanut butter. The first batch was made with an all natural peanut butter and it truly tasted like clouds. The second batch I made (the picture I took) was made with Kroger peanut butter. It still tastes wonderful, just not the same.

Absolutely delicious!! It's a new staple in this house. I made this to top chocolate cupcakes and sprinkled it with chocolate shavings. Everyone who had one raved about the frosting! Im making a batch in just a few minutes for a cupcake order for tomorrow!
One pointer: don't add any milk until you've mixed the other ingredients for a little bit. I didn't wait very long after I started mixing. The mixture looked dry and clumpy so I added a tiny bit of milk. Turns out it didn't need it. The next batch, I mixed it longer and the mixture went from a dry clump that looked like a ball of cookie dough to a delightfully fluffy yet firm frosting. No milk needed! It piped on smoothly and held its shake nicely. Truly a perfect frosting to decorate with!

it took a while for the butter to soften i recommend that you  always have the blender on high and that you put the butter in the microwave for a bit. Otherwise, wait a while before stirring. When done, overall this icing was very light, creamy, not too sweet and very delicious! It also tastes very good with brownies and milk !!!!!

This was a greasy mess right from the beginning. Used unsalted real butter. It had no taste. Tried to fix it with more confectionery sugar, vanilla and a little salt. It never came together.

This recipe is simple to make and so delicious!!! Make sure your butter is room temperature/very soft and you shouldn't have any trouble. Richest and creamiest peanut butter frosting I've ever had. Can't wait to try it on chocolate cupcakes!

I added a pinch of salt and a teaspoon of vanilla. I felt like the sweetness took away from the peanut butter flavor I wanted. The salt brought that back and vanilla cut the sweet. After that, I thought it was perfect.

I love love love this frosting.... Every time I make it for a group of people I get tons of requests for the recipe.  I'm a little confused about the comment about it being difficult to spread.  It is so fluffy for me.  Maybe you need to add a little more milk.

Had to use water instead of milk but it still turned out great. I used a frosting bag with a star tip t frost brownies. I used Adam's natural peanut butter. My new favorite pb frosting recipe. Thanks!

This was a first for me.  We LOVE peanut butter in this house and now we have a favorite frosting for chocolate cake.  Yes, it's rich!  The wonderful thing about this frosting is it is just as awesome (if not better) when it's refrigerated.  I've made this several times and the cake disappears!

I've tried doing this before without a recipe and it came out grainy. This recipe was very similar to my previous attempt so the question is why did it work this time and not before. Because the people that add reviews are smarter than I. One of the reviewers pointed out the need to have all of the ingredients room temperature. Previously I was using milk straight out of the fridge and that caused the grittiness to occur. This time I heated the milk up a bit and presto. It came out fluffy and delicious. A very simple recipe, but so good.

Amazing! Really easy delicious and not too sweet.  I'm using this on a chocolate cake but you could eat this stuff by the spoonful so don't  keep it around for long!

I reviewed a couple recipes to see what differences there were and proceeded to make a hybrid and I used a splash of vanilla also. I discovered that I didn't add enough milk to make the frosting fluffy initially but added an extra splash and it turned out great. Depending on how much  sugar you use will determine how much milk to use.

this recipe is sooooooo good! i made it with chocolate cake and it was amazing. just make sure to wait to put it on anything you bake so it can cool or else it melts. Also if it is hard to spread just add about 3 or 4 more tbs of milk to the recipe. Delicious!!!

I followed the recipe exactly, and my frosting was terribly greasy. However, I did use margarine and generic peanut butter. Perhaps that was part of the problem.

This is great!   It was nice and fluffy when made in a stand mixer with a whisk attachment.   Nothing beats homemade frosting, and I wasn't going to scratch-make a cake only to top it with something from a can.

I don't like peanut butter, but this is the best peanut butter frosting and I have ever had! It's the perfect amount of peanut butter not too much and not too little.

I read some reviews about people complaining and I just don't see why! I creamed the butter and the creamy peanut butter together until it reached a gorgeous creamy texture. Then, I added just under a cup of icing sugar (halved the recipe) and whipped it up until the lumps were out. It was thick at this point, but if you patiently add milk 1/2 tablespoon at a time, scraping down the sides and mixing as you go along, you should reach your desired consistency without any problem. I found it held up the piped design very well and tasted great at room temperature and fresh from the fridge. It was like eating a cloud of peanut buttery goodness and this coming from someone who's not the biggest fan of peanut butter! I highly suggest following the recipe as is without trying to substitute the ingredients or switching the method. Loved it!

Wow!!!  Tried these with chocolate cupcakes (just a box of chocolate cake mix with a box of pudding added in for a really moist cupcake) and it was amazing! I didn't change a thing about the recipe but I added a little too much milk - my fault - but it was still great for piping. Everyone loved them!

Rich, but the perfect pair for chocolate cupcakes. The perfect balance of peanut butter and sugar, not to peanutty, not too sweet. May add a small bit of honey or cinnamon next time for a twist.

This frosting was divine! I actually cut the amount of sugar by half, and it was still sweet enough and also the perfect consistency for a piping bag.

4 as written.  If you like a thiker peanut butter taste it is perfect for you.  I made mine for chocolate cupcakes with a mini peanut buttercup inside so I felt like as written, it would have been too much peanut butter flavor. I kept adding more powdered sugar 1/4 cup at a tme and more milk 1 Tbl at a time (probably another cup or two and anoter 3 Tbl of milk all together)  until it was a really nice light fluffy flavor  At that point it was a 5.

I have made this a couple of times. Both times I did a double batch. The second time I used one cup less sugar than it called for and I liked it more.  It wasn't quite as sweet and the peanut butter flavour stood out better.

This is thee best frosting! The only change I made was I used pastry pride instead of cream/milk. I keep pastry pride in the freezer in a freezer bag. Then I can take a large ice cream scoop and scoop out as much as I need. Today I took out one large scoop and beat it a little to help it defrost a bit. I probably ended up using almost 1/2 cup of pastry pride. It makes the frosting fluffy yet, smooth and creamy. It was fantastic!!

Amazing recipe - it's always a crowd pleaser and and my family loves it! Only one warning : Do not try to make it with organic peanut butter!!! I've made it many times before and it's always been heavenly. As I made a batch today (for a friend's birthday) I found that all I had was organic peanut butter. I was iffy, but decided to try it anyways. It ended up a complete mess. Unspreadable, clumpy, and the taste was much stronger than it ever had been before. Just wanted to warn anyone attempting the recipe so they don't ruin their frosting; make sure you have regular peanut butter before starting!

This frosting is a perfect companion to chocolate cupcakes!  My husband couldn't believe the delicious flavor the frosting provided.  I made sure all of my ingredients were softened before mixing.  The consistency turned out well.  This recipe is a keeper!

Terrible texture,  got worse with beating as recommended in recipe and comments.  I think the problem was likely that i used natural peanut butter. Highly recommend if try this you use the major brands that have additives to make them spreadable.

I followed the recipe exactly as is and tasted before adjusting. No need! It was smooth, creamy and delicious without being overly sweet. I hate bakery frosting and also store bought frosting because of this. And it was even better after I frosted the cupcakes, sprinkled them with Heath bar bits and a drizzle of melted chocolate chips and refrigerated them!

I just made this frosting it is AWESOME!! I used margarine instead of butter only because I was out of butter. I  also added a tbs of vanilla. I also  sifted my confectioners sugar. It's turned GREAT!!!!! My husband want to eat it right out of the bowl. I is light and fluffy and easy to spread on my cake. I will def be making this again.

Love, love, love this frosting!  I'd never attempted to make frosting before, but this turned out perfect!  Used it on the "One Bowl Chocolate Cake III" from this site, and it was incredible!

Very fluffy and tastes yummy. Followed the recipe except used vanilla almond milk instead of milk. Put it on 9x13 chocolate cake and had about a cup of frosting leftover. Will use for brownies soon. Will use this recipe again!

This was very tasty, however it was a little too runny when spreading. I may have used too much milk, so next time I will use a little less than stated. Went very well with my chocolate cake and covered the top with Reese's pieces. It was a hit!

Wonderfully light and fluffy texture.  Perfect amount of "peanut-buttery" taste in the flavor that is very different than any peanut butter icings I've ever tasted.  Very easy to make.  Ready to spread as soon as you mix it.  Because of that fluffy texture, it performed MUCH better coming from an icing bag than when I tried to spread it.  You CAN spread it but have to purposefully lean toward creating lots of peaks, because you cannot get a smooth surface at all.

I tried this recipe and it's awesome! Many frosting recipes that use confectioner's sugar taste like it. But the peanut butter cuts that taste, and the frosting comes out creamy, fluffy and delicious. This is my new favorite recipe.

Made this for a Chocolate Wacky Cake as a quick dessert, and it came out perfect once I made a couple of changes: 1. I used more peanut butter than stated (around 1 1/2 cups) because it just tasted like butter cream with a hint of peanut butter, 2. I used only 1 1/2 cups of sugar, and 3. I added a tsp of vanilla (as per another reviewer) which I think brought out the flavours. I had no issues with it becoming fluffy. Next time, I'll have to try Nutella in place of peanut butter (as another reviewer suggested)! All I can say is thank God no one in my family is allergic to peanuts :)

This frosting was not only perfect for the peanut butter cupcakes I made but there was plenty left over to make peanut butter cups because it tastes just like the reeses peanut butter cups filling. I followed the recipe exactly!

I tried this recipe for Thanksgiving dinner tonight, and I'm hoping it was a success! Everyone whose tried it so far says it's delicious! I added some marshmallows as my own special touch-my only critic would be for it to look more appetizing next time.

Most delicious!  As advertised,  this frosting has a great peanut butter taste without being at all greasy - just fluffy peanut butter bliss!  I will definitely use this recipe again.

Great frosting recipe.  I would recommend freezing cake prior to frosting for better frosting finish.

Awesome. Tastes great with chocolate cupcakes, brownies, or just by itself! My brother NEVER eats frosting, and he licked the mixing bowl when I was done!

I baked a cake and was out of frosting so I started searching for recipes. I came across this recipe. it was very easy to make, spread just like I wanted, and it also taste great. I was worried it would be to sweet but the peanut butter balanced out the sweetness. for those of you that said it was to think all you have to do is add a little extra milk to get it how you would like it. my kids loved it. thanks for saving me a trip to the store.

I've used this recipe MULTIPLE times, and my family absolutely love it. It's the perfect recipe, not to peanut buttery and not to sweet, it's just right. Following this recipe exactly doesn't work as well as I thought, so I made some changes. This recipe comes out perfect when you cut it in half (well for me anyways). Instead of using milk I use heavy whipping cream because of the rich and fluffy consistency. I also specifically use the reeses peanut butter. With those slight changes the frosting is pure perfection!

This was my first time making peanut  butter frosting. It was ok. My kids loved it. It was very sweet and looked like I spread some regular peanut butter on it. It tasted like a peanut butter cookie. I probably won't make it again. It was good but not what I expected.

This recipe was absolutely delicious, I could have eaten the entire bowl with a spoon. I put it on chocolate cupcakes and topped with mini reese's cups. It was very thick which made it somewhat difficult to spread, and piping took a lot of muscle power, but in the end the cupcakes looked and tasted amazing.

Great recipe and very simple. I used just a dash of water and added little by little extra room temperature butter. Room temperature as in you dent the stick of butter just by picking up, so very soft. Worked like a charm!

Very good frosting!  Made it with just a bit less conf sugar because I really wanted to taste the peanut butter.  It was perfect with just enough to decorate 24 cupcakes.  I piped on the frosting.

This is a delicious recipe. My sister loves anything involving the combination of chocolate + peanut butter, so I chose this recipe for a frosting on a Swiss chocolate cake. I cannot wait for her to taste it!

 I am not a big fan of peanut butter, but this is simply delicious! The peanut butter isn't too overwhelming and it's not too sweet, which is the usual result when I try to eat most frosting a involving peanut butter. The texture is lovely. I give this 5 stars! Will definitely use this recipe again!

The frosting goes from greasy to grainy once the milk is added. It is impossible to frost a cake with this because it is so thick that it just ends up ripping the cake with each pass of the knife. I was able to salvage the frosting by adding a bit of cream cheese to the mix.

Made as written to go on banana cake cupcakes. This was delicious and spreadable. I don't know why other raters had so much trouble. I piped this onto the banana cake cupcakes with a chocolate fudge swirl. Amazing!

I've tried this recipe 3 times, 2 of the 3 times it worked beautifully.. However the last time it was too runny.. I'm thinking temperature has something to do with it.. Everything was room temperature .. Maybe use 1 tablespoon less of milk.

Fantastic recipe. Use heavy whipping cream rather than milk, about 2 oz and unsalted butter. Use use high quality PB like Jif. Some types of low cost PB do not mix well with heavy whipping cream and becomes grainy and runny.

Taste is great but consistency was not "fluffy".  I used real butter but it seemed too oily.  Because of the flavor I will try again.

This recipe is very nice! I added a pinch of sea salt and a touch of vanilla extract to this recipe and it turned out great! I love how fluffy this frosting is, it has a lovely taste and texture, nice and light, would be great for decorating.

Maybe it was because of the peanut butter I used (it was a natural peanut butter, so there's oil separation and all--SmartBalance, was the name) but this just did not come out fluffy, nor did it look like ANYONE else's. But the flavor was pretty good.

Love it! I sometimes use marshmallow fluff to add to the fluffiness of the frosting. It holds up much nicer.

Hello new go to frosting!  Super easy, super tasty, totally divine with chocolate cupcakes.  I used Imperial margarine instead of butter and didn't end up needing milk.

I had to change it just a little for what I had on hand. Used crunchy PB, and heavy cream instead of milk. Nothing that would actually change the flavor. I must say, this tastes amazing!
It didn't make enough for me to put on a layer cake though and was just a tad too thick (my own fault for not adding more heavy cream). Will def keep this recipe to make again though.

I luv this recipe! 1st I made it, I thought I needed to add alil more milk...and it did make it alil greasy. 2nd time I used 1 tsp. vanilla, light cream (2 tbsp only) and reduced my pb to 3/4 + cup. Came out spectacular! Heeded prev. reviews and used butter not marg. Very easy, not a lot of ingredients or time involved. It's a KEEPER!

I used this frosting for a chocolate layer cake.  It tasted good, but I had an EXTREMELY hard time spreading it on my cake. Maybe using a pastry bag with this on cupcakes would be better, but I wouldn't recommend trying to frost a cake with this.

This was great and very easy. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 is that I used only half of the powdered sugar that it called for and added some vanilla.

I followed the directions and amounts exactly. I wonder if there was a typo because a cup of peanut putter is way too much. I think a standard buttercream recipe with a few teaspoons of peanut butter would have turned out well.  This was greasy and the butter separated out.

Delicious!! I only needed one tablespoon of milk to get a nice and creamy, very spreadable frosting. The 3 minutes of whipping at the end is a must as well to get that fluffiness.

I use this recipe all the time. Everyone loves it. I tend to add just a spoonful more of peanut butter and they come out great. I also use kroger brand peanut butter that has a touch of honey in it.

This was extremely greasy, sloppy to spread and clumpy.  Leave out the butter and you get a much better icing, even if you need to use a little more peanut butter and milk. It doesn't taste bad, but the consistency is horrible.

Wow! Very light and fluffy - perfect peanut butter flavor. I did have to add more milk than the recipe called for to make it really creamy - it was just a bit too stiff with 3 tablespoon. And definitely use real butter!

DO NOT ATTEMPT IF YOU DONT HAVE AN ELECTRIC MIXER. my dad threw our's out a while ago so I had to whisk this by hand--worst mistake ever. it came out grainy and I could HEAR the sugar in my mouth!& the only reason I'm giving it 5 stars is because behind all the disgusting texture I could taste it a little bit and it was good! I'm going to go try it again either using 1 cup of sugar or using 2 cups with my blender...

I don't even like peanut butter. But this frosting had me licking every spoon/bowl/paddle attachment it touched. I put the frosting on top of the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough+Cupcake Recipe from this site, and sent to work for my husband and his co workers, he came home with rave reviews and requests for more.

Wonderful recipe. If you do not have an electric mixer you can heat the peanut butter and butter to melting, mix in the powdered sugar and milk, and leave it to stiffen. It will stiffen in about 5 minutes at room temperature. Doing it this way makes the powder sugar much easier to mix in, and I mixed this frosting by hand.

I just made this but I only used 1 cup of confectioner's sugar and 2 tablespoons of milk.  It was very creamy and spread very nice.  It was enough to cover a 9x13 inch cake.  It was also not so sweet.  I will use this recipe again.

Oh my gosh, this frosting is delish. I did not deviate from the recipe and it came out perfect. Nice & fluffy -- great consistency. Quick & easy to make. We put it on chocolate cupcakes, but would be wonderful on all kinds of desserts. Can't wait to make this again!

Delicious! Rich and creamy! We all loved this frosting. I used it on boxed brownies, but can't wait to try with chocolate cake. Made enough to frost a 13 x 9 pan with a lot left over.

Such a wonderful recipe with things that I almost always have in my pantry! Easy and turned out so tasty. Simply perfect. It turned out not too sweet or too peanut-buttery. I followed directions exactly and loved the outcome. A little flub up on my part made mine not super fluffy but smooth and not thick. While adding milk by the tablespoon as needed I added one too many. That was just baker error though. I advise everyone to try it because it is oh so yummy.

It was wonderful!  I always read reviews first and "learned' that without some changes, this frosting is stiff and thick.  So I used the new whipped peanut butter on the market and added more milk until it was creamier and lighter.  My family and friends love it love it.  Have used on chocolate cupcakes and brownies.  Easy and delicious.  Helpful to make sure butter is softened and use butter not margarine.

Since I was a kid, my favorite dessert was chocolate cake with peanut butter frosting. This recipe is spot on for what I was looking for. Great peanut butter flavor and perfect, creamy texture.

This recipe was good, but not the golden color I was expecting, and the peanut butter seemed to get lost in the sugar and butter. I have never made peanut butter frosting, but my mother used to make it all the time for chocolate cakes. I guess I was expecting her frosting (I can't find a recipe that she might have used), but this wasn't it. Most of the other recipes I found were basically the same ingredients, but had twice the sugar in them. My mom's go-to cookbook was always the red plaid Better Homes and Gardens New Cook Book, but there is no recipe for peanut butter frosting in there either. Perhaps since it's been over 40 years since I had her frosting, I have forgotten what it really tastes like. This recipe just didn't have that great peanut butter flavor I was hoping for. I used Jiff creamy. Has anyone used another peanut butter that turned out great?

This frosting is superb! Fluffy, peanut buttery, and it has enough sweetness in it to balance out the peanut butter flavor nicely. A great complement to a whole host of baked goodies, since it manages to add to the dish without overpowering it. I found just it just a little too buttery for my taste, but otherwise the overall composition of this recipe was excellent and it was absolutely delicious!

This frosting is beyond amazing.  I can not believe how creamy the texture is without being too greasy and how it is still spreadable.  I like peanut butter but I absolutely love this frosting.  You have got to try it with Chef Johns Peanut butter cookies on this site.  I made the cookies in a mini muffin pan sprayed with cooking spray at 350 degrees F for 10 - 11 min. When the cookies get cooled the middles of the cookies fall.  When they completely cool pipe the frosting using a star tip in middle of cookie cup.  They are so yummy.  My little cookie peanut butter cups.

Delicious. I used this on the black magic cake from this site for my niece's birthday. Not a single piece left. I topped with chopped pb cups for decoration. Will definitely be making again and again.  Thank you.

This frosting was delicious! Very peanut buttery & a good consistency. All ingredients should be at room temperature. I used all three tablespoons milk & then beat it for probably about 4 minutes to get it the right consistency.

I love this frosting!  It turns out really creamy and easy to spread. Just make sure you add enough milk to get the consistency that you want. I've never had any problems.  It is especially good on the black magic cake. YUM!!

Nice frosting but for me it lacked the 'peanut butter' flavour I like. Certainly great texture, I used all ingrediens at room temp. Thanks for sharing.

I found this icing a tad sweet, but it was super easy and went well with chocolate cake. I did add a tsp. of salt to it to tone down the sweetness and that seemed to do the trick.

My mom made this when I was growing up, but I haven't made it myself in a long time. The secret to getting it fluffy is to add a splash of milk (sorry, but in my family we always just poured until the consistency was right - maybe start with 1/4 cup?) and about a teaspoon of vanilla. Then just beat it until fluffy. Hope this helps!

I tried this recipe as written and it was good but not mch of a peanut butter taste if you are looking for that.  The concictency did not resemble the picture it was alot lighter for me.  It was not oily at all and taste was mediocre and that is just my opinion. --Emerald

I did not allow the butter to soften (the KitchenAide can handle that chore), and still this frosting was the opposite of stiff with a beautiful creamy texture. I just didn't think it had  enough peanut butter flavor.  Less butter and more peanut butter may solve that issue, but I also thought the frosting needed a dash of vanilla.

Perfect just the way it's written!  If yours comes out too thick, you need to beat it longer &/or add more milk. (I used about 4TB of milk to get it the consistency I wanted.).

When I made the icing I found that you needed to add a lot more than the 3 Tble spoons of milk to get to a consistency that was easily piped onto a cupcake. Otherwise it turned out great!!

Very good.  Mixed up easily and then I put in my cake decorator which worked well.  Maybe not quite as creamy as other frostings, but the taste is fantastic.  I used to top the Black Magic Cake from this site, and the combination was off the charts delicious.

adding about a third of a brick of cream cheese makes it even better. i went all out and added the cream cheese and a half cup of strawberry preserves. put that on top of a chocolate cake and just watch as people tear into it.

I am not a big fan of peanut butter but wanted to try this since I had all the ingredients on hand. Using some of the suggestions I found on here, I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, made sure everything including the heavy cream I used was at room temp, added the sugar 1/2 cup at a time followed by a tablespoon of cream, and I also added some vanilla. I beat it for 3 minutes or so and ended up with a wonderful, creamy textured frosting. It was more than enough to cover my 9by12 chocolate cake. It did not come out greasy or too sweet. I think next time I will make a devil's food layer cake and after frosting will pat chocolate sprinkles on the side. Thank you for the recipe.

I only gave this a 3 because it didn't turn out smooth as other frosting recipes I've used in the past. I will try again and beat the frosting longer as maybe this was my mistake.

FANTASTIC!!!! I made this frosting to go on top of a birthday cake for my brother's birthday today and the middle layer was Strawberry jam. Mmmmmmmmmm it was so delicious! My family loved it and my cousin who doesn't like icing, really liked it! That is an ultimate compliment from her. I didn't change the recipe one bit! 
I hate when ppl put in a review and basically they've changed the whole recipe. I read the reviews to see if the recipe I am looking at has good reviews on the recipe posted. (mind my little rant) 

Hats off to NICKIE75!!!

I was expecting it to be a lot lighter and fluffier! It doesn't spread too nicely...if you don't have a piping tool.  It tasted good on chocolate cake.  I followed the video instructions exactly.

This turned out awesome!  I changed it just slightly, I used only a quarter cup of butter and I used chocolate milk. Worked out great on some fresh brownies. (Also worked out great without the brownies...)

I literally whipped this up in minutes...it doesn't get more simple than this! I frosted dark chocolate cup cakes and they were a huge hit.  I did add in a dash of pure vanilla out of habit with making frosting.  DELICIOUS!

This is super easy and really good. I found it to be grainy and crumbly too when I first made it, but I added a few more drops of milk and instantly turned creamy. I spread over top of a yellow cake and sprinkle on chopped peanuts. Delish.

After reading most of the reviews, I wasn't sure how this would turn out.  Some said it was like fudge - some said it was grainy or greasy.  I found it to be super easy to make with a great texture for piping onto chocolate cupcakes (used a mini pb cup for garnish).  I used heavy cream instead of milk because I always use cream in my frosting. Just watched as my stand mixer whipped and added cream till I got the right consistency. Used Skippy creamy peanutbutter.  I would for sure make this again.  : )

It was very good, but if you follow the recipe it comes out a little thick. Otherwise very good. If you want a strong peanut butter taste this is your recipe!

This is the perfect level of sweetness for me, a nice light finish.  I cut the recipe in half for a 9x13 sheet cake and it was perfect.

Great recipe ! I made this to frost a decadent chocolate cake, wanted something with a good peanut butter taste to go with the rich chocolate. It was AMAZINGLY GOOD ! Makes plenty enough to frost 2-9" round cakes. We loved it and think with the chocolate cake it tastes exactly like the "Funny Bones" dessert cakes by Hostess. Going to fill some chocolate cupcakes with this frosting next time.

I found it to be too thick. .. I kept adding tablespoons until I achieved the consistency I liked. About 6 in total. I haven't met any one that didn't like this frosting the way I make it. :)

This recipe would have been perfect the first time I made it but I mistakenly followed the advice on another review - whatever you do, DO NOT put this in the microwave if it looks a bit grainy.  This turns it into an oily mess that can't be saved.  Instead keep adding a little milk and mixing, it will get to the right consistency. Following the recipe exactly is the key, when I did that it turned out fluffy and delicious.

Peanut butter frosting was great. The look of it wasn't smooth  like the photo but the taste was fabulous. I guess that's what counts. It's a keeper for me.It is "yummy" says my family and friends.

Epic FAIL!!! Although this recipe had good flavor, it was not spreadable and oozed oil when attempting to pipe it. It could be that we use organic PB. It did not turn out fluffy or creamy. I am going to try it again but cut back on the butter.

perfect recipe...4 stars because I modified it to get the fluffy airy spreadable consistency. 
1/2 cup butter, 1 cup peanut butter,1/3 c heavy cream...beat those three FIRST until light and fluffy then add pwdr sugar till you get the taste and consistency you want...I added about 3-4 cups.  turned out perfect. a keeper for sure.

It was ok but very very rich.  To lighten it up I whipped a cup of heavy whipping cream and folded it into the frosting.  It was the best I have ever had with this one change.  I made the Too much Chocolate cake from this site and once frosted chilled it in the fridge.  Everyone raved.

I have made many recipes from this site, but this had to be the WORST ever!!!!!  Made it the first time with natural peanut butter and it turned into one hard ball.  I assumed that I should have used the cheap peanut butter, so I went back into town to get some.  Followed  the recipe to the "T"  ....came out almost as bad as the first.  There was nothing "fluffy" about it.....  PLEASE don't waste your time or your $ on the ingredients!

Made this frosting for Fathers Day treats. It went atop peanut butter cupcakes and brownies that I made in muffin cups. This is almost insane it is so delicious. My husband cannot stop raving except when he is licking his fingers. Thanks for the great recipe!

Wonderful flavor!! I made exactly as written had to pipe the frosting on the entire cake. Next time I will reduce the peanut butter and butter add more liquid and maybe some more powdered suger 2.5 cups? Everyone did absolutly love this recipe.

I loved this! When I went to my best friends house we made this for a double-layered cake and put it in the middle and it was amazing! Even though we put granulated sugar instead of confectioners sugar. But if you do put granulated sugar instead, probably add about a cup and a half :)

This is the BEST peanut butter frosting I've found yet. It's wonderful as is, but for my personal preference, I decrease the sugar and use more peanut butter only because I love a strong PB flavor. I use this frosting on my homemade brownies and it's a hit with my family of 7 every time. My husband has taken a batch to his Fire Station and they loved them as well. This frosting is awesome!

This is so good and easy to make. I will use this recipe more often, of course depending on the cake.

DELICIOUS!!! I loved it. Very fluffy and neither the peanut butter and the confectioners sugar overpowered the frosting. :)

I love this! I just made brownies, and wanted to add a peanut butter frosting. This recipe turned out fluffy, not too sweet, peanut buttery, and didn't take over the chocolate of the brownie. Yum. :)

I made this exactly as the recipe states with a store brand pb and installed butter. Turned out amazing and perfectly fluffy. I needed a little more milk than it called for and I used a piping bag as well. Will make this again for sure.

This was amazing!  Follow the directions and it turned out perfect. Didn't change a thing. Used it to top chocolate cupcakes with a mini reeses peanut butter cup inside and topped with chopped reeses.  Ultimate!

I tried making this with Adam's Natural Peanut butter and it was a disaster! At first everything looked like it was going well...until I beat it for three minutes and ended up with a gooey, slimy frosting (that still tastes like peanut butter and sugar at least). 

Perhaps I'll try skipping the final beating step if I ever try this recipe again.

I did not care for this recipe. Made exactly as directed.  I would not get fluffy. More like a greasy, crumbly mess.  I used Skippy peanut butter. Finally, I decided to add sugar till it would at least bind a little bit. No luck.

Very tasty recipe! I followed this recipe exactly as written, my only problem was it was very stiff, so i had to add more milk/cream. No problem though! it was fantastic. It was a bit hard to pipe through but then again, youre dealing with peanut butter :) Thanks for the recipe!!!

I made this recipe last night. It was simple to make. Make sure your butter is soft enough and add more than 3 tablespoons of milk. I think I added 5 or 6 to make it the smooth consistency I wanted for my cake. It was delicious and everyone enjoyed it.

Absolutely delicious!  I beat the softened butter and peanut together, then added the powdered sugar and milk and beat on high for a couple of minutes.  The texture and taste was perfect!  I frosted a batch of brownies with it -- perfect combination!

I love this recipe. It has a great balance in flavor. The consistency is perfect on top of my dark chocolate brownies. I play around with the amount of milk or cream that I add to get the right texture that I want depending on what I am going to frost.  I always double the recipe to ensure that we have some left over so my husband can eat the plain frosting! My husband can't stay away from the left overs!

Followed the recipe as written initially.  It tasted like powdered sugar and didn't spread well at all. Added more PB and tweaked until i was happy with it.

Just made some cupcakes with mini reece cups added to the batter and was looking for a peanut butter frosting. I cut the recipe in half for a dozen cupcakes but otherwise made it as written.  IT's a keeper.  It's creamy, spreadable, not too sweet, and an excellent topper to my cupcakes.

My 5-star rating is based on taste.

I followed the recipe exact and absolutely love the rich peanut buttery taste that this recipe lends. I made cupcakes from the Black Magic recipe (here on this site) and wanted to try it with a variety of frostings, Peanut Butter at the top of that list. Since I only made 18 cupcakes, I halved the recipe. What I found is that even using the exact ingredient proportions left the frosting: 1) a bit dry after it sat as it appeared to thicken, which was great; and 2) extremely too thick to pipe (using tip 21). I will definitely be keeping this recipe and will modify the liquid as needed to accommodate my treat (cake, brownies, etc.).

My goodness, this is so good!  It tastes like the filling in a Nutter Butter cookie.  I frosted a pan of peanut butter chip brownies and the results were beyond amazing.  This frosting would be excellent on cupcakes, too.  I did add a tsp of vanilla, but otherwise followed the recipe as-is.

Not a fan.  It really wasn't fluffy at all, just very thick and rich.  Too rich and thick for what I like.  I "fixed" it by adding more confectioners sugar and thinning it out with milk.

I originally made this frosting recipe for the peanut chocolate cake recipe which unfortunately isn't on the site anymore because the one that was with the recipe used way too much confectioners sugar and I only had enough for a smaller amount.  This frosting is light and fluffy and very peanut buttery, perfect for the peanut butter addict like me.  I didn't need all the milk the first go, but the second time round I did, mainly due to the fact that I used a different drier brand of peanut butter.  I also couldn't resist slipping in a little vanilla (or homemade vanilla paste which is my favourite flavour right now) which just perked it up a little as vanilla often does.

This recipe was easy to follow.  Tastes awesome and mine turned out easy to spread.  Since I used all natural organic peanut butter, I added one additional tbs of milk.  I do think the key was to have all ingredients at room temp.  I set my microwave to auto defrost to bring my milk to room temperature...it worked like a charm :)

five stars twice over!!! I had a craving for chocolate and peanut butter, so I made this to frost over a chocolate mayonaise cake I made. I used margarine instead of butter, I just used a little less than recipe called for in the butter, and I only had crunchy peanut butter. It still worked out fine. One of my favorite frostings!

Good and easy to make. I wouldn't cake it on like the picture because it's just too much frosting. It's very sweet and too much of it on one single cupcake is a bit overwhelming.

I have tried several peanut butter frostings, and this one takes the cake. ;) (pun intended!). I followed the recipe as stated except for blending each ingredient after adding:   I added 1/2 c of butter, 1 cup peanut butter and creamed well, for about 3 minutes. Then, I added 1 cup of confectionary sugar and blended well.  Added the other cup and also blended well.  I then eyeballed about 3-4Tbs of milk (didn't have cream on hand) and mixed well.  I wanted a slightly thick frosting though.  I have already put this recipe in my box.  I love it.  Absolutely perfect!

I use this all of the time. I am very picky about my desserts and this is the only review I have ever written because it is worthy of 5 stars.  I get asked to make brownies with this frosting all of the time. Follow the directions, use ingredients at room temp and this frosting is perfection!

I made this recipe to top homemade banana chocolate chip cupcakes. The frosting turned out perfectly. I followed the recipe exactly as it's written. I used the whisk attachment for my kitchen aid stand mixer. I made sure the butter was softened. I whipped the pb and butter for about 5 min, scraping down the bowl occasionally. I gradually added the powdered sugar and scraped down the bowl occasionally. I beat it on high speed for about 5 minutes and then added 1tbs of skim milk at a time, using 3 total. I continued to beat on high for a few more minutes. It's fluffy and perfect. Makes enough for about 24 cupcakes.

Made this for a cake and it worked perfectly. Had to use a couple extra tablespoons of milk (I found skim worked nicely) to make it a bit more spreadable, but it was amazing.

I love this recipe!!!  I accidentally added 1 cup of butter, and it was the mistake ever!!!  The frosting is now perfect to spread over cakes, brownies, etc...  You do not even need to add milk.  I Love it!!!

I made this for my chocolate cupcakes and my friends/co-workers really enjoyed it. I did not have milk on hand, so, I used heavy whipping cream.  I would make this again.  Update: I now use 3 cups of powdered sugar and about 4 tablespoons of milk.

After reading other reviews, I was careful adding the confectioner's sugar. I found that at 1.5 cups, it was way too dry. So, I didn't add any more, and added the milk as directed. It was very good. I live in a very dry climate, maybe in a more humid climate the extra 1/2 cup is necessary?  I would suggest you add the confectioner's sugar a little at a time, and stop when the consistency is correct.

Loved this!  The only change I made was to add 1 tsp of vanilla while mixing.  I made sure to mix the peanut butter and the butter very well before adding the sugar and milk, both of which I added in parts and mixed in.  It was great the first day but AWESOME! after setting up in the fridge overnight.

Where is the 6th star!?!?! Superb recipe! I have made it twice now, and have had no problems with it.  Of course, you see nuts in the pic because, in our home, there is no such thing as creamy peanut butter!! eww!! Anyway, this is perfect, as is!  Spreads great, and, like a previous reviewer, I put the left over frosting in the fridge... and... ok, I wanted just a bite of something sweet, so I got a spoonful of the cold frosting to eat... GUESS WHAT?? Tastes just like peanut butter fudge!!!!!! YUM!!! so...now i'm going to have to figure out what wonderful thing i can do with THAT lol. The pic is one of my Apple Nut Bread muffins frosted with this frosting! To DIE for! Thanks for posting this recipe!!

Great recipe! The only thing I changed was that I used evaporated milk.  All I had was skim milk and was afraid to use the that after reading some reviews. I really beat the heck out of it and it turned out to be like a whipped frosting.  Will use again and again!

Awesome recipe! The only thing I added was a 1/2 tsp of vanilla. It tastes amazing! One way to make the frosting spread easily is to scoop several spoonfuls of the frosting on to the cake so that each is touching, then spread. I didn't have any problems with it.

This icing is FANTASTIC, exactly as written; follow the instructions and add milk as needed, and it will be perfect.  I was able to pipe it and to spread it.  It's very light, not overly peanut buttery or too sweet.  It's delicious on chocolate cupcakes!

Everything tasted great until I added the milk. Then it turned gluppy. I don't know what happened. And you can over beat it. I let it beat in hopes that it would get fluffy but instead everything started separating.

Awesome recipe! Made as is it will frost two 13x9 inch pans. So I just half it when I'm only making 1 pan :) I also only use between 1 to 1 and 1/2 cups of powdered sugar. Doesn't really need the full 2 cups. I also do a "heaping cup" of peanut butter. Delicious! :)

I don't know what happened with my first batch of this frosting.  The recipe said to beat for 3 minutes to make it fluffy but the longer I beat it the worse it got.  It looked like it was separating into oil, milk and peanut butter.  Very strange.  The taste was fine and hated to throw away so I scooped out the insides of my cupcakes and used it as a filling.  Made a second batch and didn't mix as long then piped it on filled cupcakes.  Kids loved the filled cupcakes so some good came of the first flop of the frosting.

Okay, so my first try it turned out a little grainy, but it tastes amazing.  I am eating it with a spoon!  I will try again.  The only thing I did differently was add a teaspoon of vanilla.

This icing is fantastic.  You have to use butter - no substitutions, and an electric mixer.
I used Biscoff peanut butter spread.  
Follow the directions as written.

Very good frosting! I added a little more peanut butter (I like more peanut flavor)and made sure I whipped the butter and PB well. It tasted great and was very fluffy and spread easily over my brownies!

Definitely worthy of 5 stars!  I had some heavy whipping cream that needed to be used in the fridge, so I substitued the cream for milk and the frosting came out perfectly.  Thank you for the great recipe NICKIE75.  This is my go to recipe for peanut butter frosting!

This recipe was very good. I was afraid that it would be too "peanut buttery," but it was just the right amount. The only this I would like to change is a little bit less sugar. It was a little bit too sweet for my taste.

I made this recipe possibly 10 months ago, it was delicious and everyone raved about my chocolate cake with peanut butter icing, the only thing I was trying to do before this was make a peanut butter marshmallow (Fluff)  icing. I mixed a little together to see the consistency and it was too thick even adding milk it seemed to sticky. So when I made this I added a little fluff for flavor and put fluff between the cake layers. My sister wants a cake with peanut butter cups on top for her birthday so I came back for the recipe. :) its very good, not too sweet like others.

Wonderful!!  No complaints - but I did follow others' advice and beat the butter and peanut butter for several minutes before I added the powdered sugar.  I also had the butter and peanut butter at room temp.

this frosting is paired well with any chocolate cake. It's light, fluffy, and doesn't overwhelm with the peanut butter taste. Delicious.

This recipe is AMAZING!!! I altered it a little because I don't like using milk in my frostings. So here's what I did: Mix butter and peanut butter until you cannot see butter anymore ad the mixture is very creamy (at least 1 min). Add icing sugar and mix for about 30 sec then add 1 tbsp of water. Mix on Med-High (6 on mKitchen-Aid) for at least 3 min. Not only is this a very esy recipe but it's so delicious and a perfect compliment to any cake or brownie. For anyone having trouble with the consistency my advice would be to mix more, 3 min is longer than it seemes. Enjoy!!!

I made this to frost chocolate cupcakes and it turned out wonderfully! I used reviewer suggestions and only used 2.5 cups of powdered sugar and I only needed 2 Tbsp of milk. I followed the directions and it is fluffy and very spreadable! Added a tsp. Of vanilla too! The perfect sweetness! Will definitely make again!

only used 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar...tasted good, but not a very "pretty" color.  Sort of a tan color.  Might want to add the remaining powdered sugar to make it lighter.

Absolutely delicious!  Thick but silky-smooth consistency, I needed something firm that wouldn't stick for the top of cupcakes that needed to travel.  Gave my arm a workout to pipe, but could have easily been thinned if I had wanted to.

This is hands-down the most fantastic peanut butter frosting I've ever had.  I just this recipe exclusively.  A tip for folks having issues with it not spreading:  you haven't beat it long enough.  You really need to give it those full 3 or even 5 minutes with an ELECTRIC beater to get it fluffy.

Reduced the icing sugar slightly and added more peanut butter, it still turned out fantastic! The texture was right and the taste was perfect. Will definitely be using this recipe again! Goes great with brownies :)

I halved this recipe and it covered exactly two dozen cupcakes. I did not need to use any milk; it mixed up fine without it.

This was the perfect complement for some banana and banana/Nutella cupcakes I made. Another reviewer complained about the color being unattractive, but it went well with the lighter colored cake and a pastel wrapper. It was not too peanut buttery, nor was it too sweet. It also kept fine for days on the cupcakes at room temperature without any drying or molding.

This recipe is fantastic!  My family was in heaven.... Tasted like a fluffier version of the inside of a peanut butter cup.  Be sure to whip the butter and peanut butter until all lumps are out.

Perfectly sinful! Made this for a brownie cupcake and entered it into my company's cupcake wars and WON!  Everyone commented on how good the frosting was.  The only thing I altered in this recipe was I used 3/4c of peanut butter instead of the full cup.  Also agree with the other postings that everything needed to be at room temperature.

I made this tonight for some chocolate peanut butter cupcakes.  It is perfect! I did have to substitute heavy cream for milk, but I don't think it makes a difference.  Thanks for the recipe--it's a keeper.

This was the first peanut butter icing I made and I will only make this! It is fluffy and airy, but still nice and sweet. It also isn't overpowingly sweet, it keeps it's peanut butter taste greatly.

Good flavor, but I was wanting a frosting that is a little creamier.  This got very stiff and I kept adding a little bit of milk to try to thin it out and it never really helped.  I enjoyed the flavor, just wasn't the texture that I wanted.

Followed the directinos to a T and this never got fluffy for me as long as I mixed it.  My mixer broke in the midst of trying to beat it to fluffiness.  Bought a new mixer and almost burned out the motor on it when I went back and tried "fluffing" it again the next morning.
Used it anyway (on the Extreme Chocolate Cake from this site) because it was spreadable and the taste was fantabulous. Just didn't turn out fluffy like I'd wanted and when I tried piping it, it ended up kinda melting into the base layer of frosting after a while.

Wonderful! A very different frosting that you [probably] have all the ingredients already for. I used heavy whipping cream instead of milk just b/c I had it on hand (unusual) and wanted to use it up. I did end up using more than it calls for - about 6 tbs instead of 3, but it was easily frost-able, looked good, and it tasted GREAT. Hubby has already requested this for his birthday 3 months early.

delicious on a chocolate cake.  A bit hard to spread as it didn't want to stick to the cake, but well worth the effort it took.  I'll make this again.

I made this frosting exactly as it shows and it was PERFECT for the peanut butter crunch cake recipe that I found on this website as well. It's very light and fluffy and not to overpowering. I garnished my cupcakes with salted peanuts and chocolate chips and it tasted GREAT together! This will definitely be my GO TO Peanut Butter recipe!

Don't be afraid to use stick margarine if it's all you have! I did, and it was still very yummy! Not greasy at all as some had suggested and very fluffy! I added a little vanilla and only used a cup and a half of the sugar....so good! Thank you!

Holy moly this is sweet heaven in a bowl!! I'm only rating this a 4 because it came out sort of mealy, even with a little extra milk added. But the taste is a 5+! I seriously wanted to eat the frosting out of the bowl and skip the cupcakes!!! Will definitely use this again. Thanks!

Read several reviews before you make this icing.  It doesn't work as written, but if you take heed of the tips offered by the people who have tried it, you will enjoy this icing. (i.e. all ingredients should be room temp., use heavy cream, don't use margarine, microwave if it gets stiff and grainy)  Good Luck!

Used room temperature butter + Jif (my favorite peanut butter). Hardly needed any milk at all to get the consistency creamy and silky smooth. I used on mini bite size brownies with great results and rave reviews. 

Although very light textured, seems like it still would be difficult to spread on anything light or crumbly. Would be good on cookie bars, rice krispie bars, or as the filling in cookie sandwiches.

I hate rating this soo low, but I would have to agree with others that it is a lesson learned and the spreadablity is just awful!! BUT I MUST SAY THAT THIS COULD HAVE COME FROM MY OWN ERROR. I USED MY KITCHEN AID MIXER AND LEFT IT BEAT LONGER THAN IT PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE. So it could be something we need to watch! 
The taste was good. was nice on the recipe, best brownies ever! I would have to look for another recipe in the future, it just did not win me over! But also have to say, everyones taste are so different not everyone will be happy as the next guy!

I enjoyed this recipe, although I didn't find it had a stong peanut butter flavor (which I love & prefer!) I incorporated all the ingredients together at once, along with a 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and it worked out beautifully for me. It yields a lovely piping consistency!

This tasted more like peanut butter than peanut butter frosting.  It was still good since we obviously like peanut butter but was hoping for something sweeter.  Something that tasted like frosting would've been great.

I just made this recipe to go with my brownies and I love it!  To get mine so that it wasn't grainy - I added a little bit of sugar and 1 tbsp of milk at a time and mixed it well.  After I did that three times I beat it on high for 3 minutes. Perfectly fluffly!

This is a delicious and fluffy peanut butter icing. I have never had such good icing. I changed it just a tad by using a little less sugar and more peanut butter since I don't like mine really sweet SO good definitely worth trying. Thanks so much for sharing

This recipe was okay, i think the butter to peanut butter ratio was wrong. If i made this again it would be 1/2 cup of butter to 1 1/2 cups of peanut butter. The taste of the butter was overwhelming and i used Skippy brand peanut butter!!! Other then that, it was smooth and creamy...perfect 'spreadability' and sweetness!

I'm not quite sure what the problem was with some of the reviews. I followed the recipe exactly and it was PERFECT. So creamy and smooth. I will make this again and again.

This is my first time making icing own my own and I am very happy with the outcome. I followed the directions as written and it has come so light and fluffy. This is going in my recipe box at home.

I used Kraft whipped peanut butter and cut the recipe in half for a pan of squares.  Super easy to spread and it was delicious!

Really good tasting :) i referred to it in my own recipe(delicious and simple chocolate cupcakes) i must have forgotten a step though because it did not turn out very fluffy, also it was extremely hard to squeeze out of my icing bag i had to put it in the microwave for two minutes to get it to the right consistency :)

AMAZING!!!  I made this exactly as instructed and it's the best peanut butter frosting!  The delicious peanut butter taste goes well the the fluffy texture!  I did not spread the frosting as I used my decorator tool and it laid perfectly and is not sliding!!

I had great luck with this recipe. It did beat up fluffy and I did pipe it on my cupcakes and it held its shape well. I added about 1/2 a cup more sugar and I just eyeball the milk when I added it but the measurements seem right. Just because it is butter and peanut butter, it might not hold up well in heat, like a summer picnic but we had NO PROBLEM. From experience, I know the key to fluffy is room temperature ingredients as well a beating in the air with every step...first with the creaming of the wet and then as the sugar is added and then as you add the milk. Great peanut butter flavor!

This frosting has a nice taste as it is not really sweet like other frostings. Although, the taste and texture is very much like the filling for peanut butter balls or bars. Mine turned out much thicker than the pictures, although I did use creamy natural peanut butter, so it might not whip up as fluffy. The recipe could also be easily cut in half, for a square dessert, as it makes quite a bit.

Delicoius! The best frosting I've tasted! I used only 1 1/2 cups of sugar, so I didn't need milk. Great with one bowl chocolate cake III cupcakes.

GREAT recipe!!! I used the regular Jiff Peanut Butter, Organic Fat Free Milk, Giant Eagle Butter with salt and Giant Eagle Powdered Sugar. 

I left my butter on the oven while I baked my cakes. It was sift almost to melting point when I used it. I blended the peanut butter and regular butter until well blended. I added 1/4 cup of confectioners sugar until well blended. I added 1 Tbsp of milk at these intervals. After 3/4 c, 1 1/2 c and 2 cups of confectioners sugar has been added. I used my Kitchen Aide Mixer and beat it at medium speed for 1 minute. It was the right texture! I used it in the middle layer of a round chocolate cake!. used whipped chocolate frosting and decorated the top with mini reese's cups and the sided with the tiniest toll house chocolate morsels!!!!

The cake came out great! This filling was just what I was looking for!! THANK YOU! :)

Help!!! It is tasty.  But I did something wrong. I slowly added the sugar and a little milk as needed. After I beat it for approx 3 min, During the three min period it looked like it was getting think, so I added a little bit more milk and then it turned out creamy, greasy and a little on the heavy side. Can anyone help as to what I did wrong and how I can fix it, should it happens again? I put it in between the layered cake and then put the cake in the fridge.  It was like 86 degrees in the house. maybe that was it. Even though the consistency didn't turn out...the flavor is still good and I would use this again

I made it exactly as directed and it was perfect.  I've put this on a 2-layer chocolate cake twice - the second time I used a large-sized spreader for icing cakes and it made it easier than the first time when I just used a regular spatula.  Both times I've topped the frosting with the satiny chocolate glaze also found on this site and it makes it taste like a melted peanut butter cup - soooooo good!  Thanks for a great recipe!

i bet this would work great, i was following the directions perfectly, then when it started to get a little stiff, i followed someones recommendation that i microwave it for a little bit--- NIGHTMARE- DO NOT DO THIS... it separated and turned into an oily nasty mess, i will try this recipe again and try to figure out what to do when it started to get too stiff...

It was perfectly delicious! I loved it and I typically hate peanut butter sweets. If you actually follow the recipe and add the milk slowly you will get a great consistency. In to my recipe box this goes.

Outstanding frosting! I used it to top off cinnamon,dark chocolate cupcakes. I did the recipe exactly as written and it was a little to sweet, for my taste, so I cut the confectioner's sugar down to 1 1/2 cup and it was perfect.

WOW, this was amazing! I was honestly a little hesitant of making/eating peanut butter frosting, I thought it would be incredibly sweet. But this was so smooth and creamy with the right amount of sweetness! I can't wait to make it again!! Followed recipe as written! Just make sure you beat every step for about 3 minutes.

I wasn't a fan of peanut butter icing, but found this recipe on a search to make brownies with PB icing for my son's birthday.. after trying this, I am now a fan!! This frosting is delicious. It came out perfectly fluffy and spread so easily.  I love the color and the consistency was perfect! Cant wait for the kids to try it at the party tomorrow!

My son doesn't like cake, so for his birthday he wanted a giant cookie instead. I made the one from this site and topped it with the fluffy peanut butter frosting. OMG! It was amazing! The kids loved it, but the big surprise was how much my husband & I loved it. We ate the entire thing in 3 days! LOL! I am making it again for Easter dinner & I'm going to decorate it with coconut (dyed green) and chocolate eggs. YUM!

Great recipe! The only thing I changed was I used 2 1/2 Tbsp milk and added 2 Tbsp Crisco. I wasn't using it to frost a cake, but rather as a filling in a layer cake. I wanted it a bit lighter and fluffier and the Crisco really helped whip it up. Delicious light peanut butter flavor that doesn't overpower your cake! :)

OMG this is peanut butter heaven! I ended up using margerine (it was all I had on hand) and followed the tip of another reviewer and added the tablespoon of milk after each cup of the powdered sugar to keep it smooth. I added 3/4 tbsp of vanilla at the end. What worked for me: the whipping attachment on my stand mixer was a great help with this frosting! I will DEFINITELY make this again...and again....and again :-)

Excellent recipe, except had to use about 8-10 tablespoons of milk to get the frosting into creamy, spreadable consistency.

Really good!! Followed directions and thought it was great! A little tough to spread on the cake (would definitely work better on brownies), so I ended up spreading it on w/ a spatula and then patting and smoothing it on with my clean hands. Ended up looking a little like fondant, though not as smooth. Tasted fantasic! Made my chocolate cake look like an inside-out Reese's cup.

Delicious on the chocolate cupcakes I made. When I first tasted it I felt like it could have used more peanut butter. After frosting the cupcakes and trying it, I found the flavor to be perfect. I just wish it had more of a peanut butter look/color to it.

This recipe works best with heavy cream as it whips fluffier than milk.  Just don't whip for too long or you may have "real butter" cream icing.

Holy fluffiness!!!  This frosting is a-m-a-z-i-n-g!  Mine was not at all greasy, and it was SUPER fluffy!  A tad hard to spread, but let's face it, anything with peanut butter is not going to be the easiest thing to work with ;)  I softened my butter in the microwave, added the peanut butter, and used a cheap hand mixer to blend it completely together.  Then added 1/2 cup of powdered sugar at a time - with a tiny splash of milk each time as well.  Probably used a little under 2 cups of powdered sugar.  AWESOME recipe!!!

This is a delicious recipe but I found out you can't do it with an all natural peanut butter.  It ends up separating and getting really oily and lumpy.

We love this easy frosting on our browies. We went heavy on the Peanut Butter (3-4 spoon fulls), and lighter on the milk (1-2 Tablespoons) but it turned out awesome. And it never hardens up, but stays moist for at least 2 days - which is as long as the brownies have ever lasted.

Very yummy frosting!  I wanted a similar taste, but very fluffy for a cake filling.  I nixed the milk, added a little more confectioners sugar (prob. 1\2  c?).  Then I added 1 c. whipped cream.  All I can say is  WOW!

This is the best frosting recipe I have tried. It is smooth, creamy, light and fluffy. It has just the right amount of peanut butter flavor. Everyone that has tried it loves it.

AWESOME!  I'm not a lover of frosting - it's usually way too sweet.  But I could eat this stuff by the spoonful!  Super easy to whip up too.  Thanks for sharing.

This frosting took a lot more liquid, and I added until it was a consistency that I thought I could spread.  It was fluffy, but wasn't overly sweet or peanut butter tasting.  It made a LOT of frosting for a standard sized cake.  I thought it was average in taste and consistency.

Very delicious!!! It was so hard not to lick the beaters when I was done...but I did it anways!! Very creamy and fluffy!! But make sure and pay attention to the "as needed" for the milk. It really depends on where you live and the humidity sometimes. I ended up w/ about 5-6 tbls...I didnt measure! But very good and a keeper!!

This frosting is delicious.  i am not a sweets person and I couldn't help but lick the bowl.  I followed the method Cyndie Schneider indicated in her recipe.  I had no problem frosting a 9" layer cake and had extra frosting.  I used crunchy peanut butter because it was all I had on hand but it was still easy to work with and yummy.  I'm not sure I'll ever make another frosting.  Ever.

I made these for cake balls frosting.  It's absolutely amazing! I put in the lowest amount called of powdered sugar and added just a splash of milk. Absolutely perfect consistency. I will make again! I have no idea how anyone could manage to mess up this easy recipe!

Very good, but a little finicky.  I followed the instructions word for word and got a glob of greasy goo that tasted quite good, but was not frosting.  I started over and got a decent frosting that wasn't all that fluffy, but it worked. I think the first goo seized when I mixed the frosting too much.  It is all I can come up with.  Worth making again, but not no-fail.

This is really good frosting. It is a tad too sweet I think, but tasty. I didn't have powdered sugar so I made my own (1 cup sugar + 1 tbsp cornstarch blended in the blender until powdery), so maybe that's why mine turned out really sweet.

It was pretty good however I think it did need a little more than 3 tbsp of milk though. I should have added more but the result turned out ok just would have been nice to be a little smoother. I should have did the "as needed" basically :)

I think the consistency of peanut butter varies, so you just have to add milk till you get the consistency you like. I put this on top of chocolate cupcakes. Delicious!!

I'm a pretty tough reviewer, but this frosting is awesome!  I halved the recipe and added more milk and powdered sugar than is called for, but it's so good.  It made very mediocre brownies very yummy!  GREAT recipe!

Pretty good but I forgot to mix it for three minutes after combining it all, so it didn't turn out looking very fluffy. Instead, it kindof looked like I took a bunch of peanut butter and slathered it on a cake. Still tasted great though! Next time I'll be more careful (and there will be a next time!)

Decadent! This recipe is very similar to the 'peanut butter frosting' recipe on this site.  The only difference is whether to add 2 cups of confectionery sugar (as this recipe states), or 4 cups as the other recipe states.  Sooo, you guessed it, I added 3 cups of confectionary sugar.  I tasted after 2 cups and it was good, but I wanted to cut the pb taste just a tad so I opted for the extra cup of sugar. It would be fine either way.  A redo!

This frosting is delicious. My husband is allergic to peanuts, so I substituted soy butter and added a package of philly cream cheese!  Very light and fluffy. Delicious on the Argo Pumpkin cupcakes from this site!!

Just really good. I prefer the texture of crunchy peanut butter and a little less sugar.

This frosting is the perfect peanut butter frosting!  So simple to make and so tasty.  I like my frosting on the sugary side rather than the creamy side and this did not disappoint.  I was usint the frosting for whoopie pies so I made it a little stiff, too, so it would hold up to the cakes.   Love, Love, Love it...wouldn't change a thing!

When I made this recipe it turned out nice and fluffy.  It was looking a little fudgey like other reviews said, so I just added a little more milk and it became more spreadable.  The flavor is great, and although it doesn't look quite as pretty and creamy as some other icings, I was happy with it.  Looks pretty much like the picture.

This is very delicious. I made for brownies and everyone loved it. I did not make any changes and I had no problem with it spreading. I think you have to make sure you whip it long enough.

This frosting was very yummy and indeed came out light and fluffy as promised. It had a great peanut butter flavor. I would've given it 5 stars but I found it to be a tad bit too sweet. I think next time I will add just a bit less sugar and that should fix it up. This frosting was very easy to spread. For those of you who are having trouble getting it to be spreadable, you really need to make sure that everything is room temperature and that it is well combined. Also, make sure that you are adding the sugar a little at a time. You may not be adding enough milk. Remember, the recipe says 3 tbsp or AS NEEDED. Mine indeed take more than 3 tbsp. If it is not light and fluffy then you need to mix it longer. This recipe was great to do in the KitchenAid. Thanks for the recipe. It will be going into my recipe box for sure.

I did not like the consistency of this frosting. It seemed to thick for me. I beat for the 3 minutes it stated and within a few minutes afterward, it started to separate. Maybe you are supposed to use low end cheap peanut butter. The only thing I could have done wrong was that I used natural peanut butter.

This was excellent.  I made it as the center filling for an oreo cookie cake.  The chocolate/peanut butter combo was perfect.  You can add more or less milk to try and get the consistency you want.  I added a little more than the recipe called for to get good fluffy frosting.

This is wonderful frosting! I followed the recipe exactly as given. It is very creamy and fluffy. I think the key is to beat the frosting for the 3 minutes, that is what makes if fluffy and very spreadable.  I will definately be making this again.

I frosted the Black Magic Cake (also found on Allrecipe) with this and it was amazing!  I only put 1-1/2c of sugar in, instead of the 2c that the recipe calls for).  The result is a very "grown-up" version of a Chocolate Cake with Peanut Butter Frosting.  A must try!

This was terrific!  I followed the directions and it came out great!  I made mine in my stand mixer, and letting it beat for a few minutes at the end really does make it fluffy!  It pipes on cupcakes great!

This recipe is absolutely delicious...it's hard to find such a rich and tasty buttercream frosting with a twist of flavor! It's fluffy, light but rich, and melts in your mouth....you will be licking the spatula...and the bowl...and having seconds.

This frosting is very good! Not sickly sweet and plenty of peanut butter flavor. I used JIF All Natural pb. and it didnt turn out oily at all. It wasn't quite as fluffy as I was expecting but still very good and I had no problems spreading it over a pan of brownies. Yum! I did make the recipe exactly as written as well.

This is what peanut butter out of a jar should taste like; it is sweet fluffy peanut butter flavor I can eat it by itself. The chocolate cake I put it on is bland in comparison. This recipe makes me want to use pb frosting on things other than cake.... like crackers and bread...maybe even plain chocolate.

I made this just as instructed and it came out fluffy and delicious!  Used it to top the Black Magic cake, decorated with chocolate buttercream and topped it off with some semisweet chocolate morsels.  It really is very peanut buttery, and everyone loved it.

Tastes phenomenal!  Doesn't spread well AT ALL, though. I (unfortunately) didn't read the reviews before making it. Lesson learned. My cake is ugly as sin but tastes like it was touched by an angel!

This frosting is the best frosting I have ever made and eaten.  It tops all cream cheese, royal white, chocolate, etc. that I have tried.  On top of devils food cupcakes, it tasted like buckeye candy.  I will use this recipe forever now.

This icing is simply to die for! You do have to whip it for several minutes to get it nice and fluffy and I did add a bit more milk than called for but the end result was a light and fluffy icing with a big peanut butter taste. I used cupcakes that I made with boxed cake mix and it was fabulous. Next time I will make my cupcakes from scratch as this icing deserves a homemade cake on which to serve it!

Made this recipe exactly as posted and it was DELICIOUS! Nice and fluffy, easy to spread. Used it to frost chocolate cupcakes for my sons birthday party. I rolled the tops of the frosted cupcakes in crushed oreos and topped with gummy caterpillars...a big hit with the kiddos!

Absolutely delish! I made a whole recipe for a 9x13 chocolate mayonnaise cake, I love thick frosting. It held up well in the fridge and freezer as well. I froze my leftover cake and used the defrost feature of my microwave to thaw. The frosting was still perfect :) Thanks for this recipe!

I was nervous about the consistency of this recipe as per other reviews but mine came out great.  I cut my recipe in half since I was only frosting 24 mini brownie bites.  I used a hand held electric mixer and it came out creamy and delicious.  I was hoping for a sweeter taste, but combined with the chocolate flavor of the brownies, it came out perfect.

We made cupcakes for my friend's wedding in lieu of a traditional cake.  By her request, this was the frosting we topped our chocolate cupcakes with.  She'd remembered a cake her friend made her a few years ago that had this frosting - it's that good! We added half a peanut butter cup on the top.  They came out very cute, and everyone who had one raved about them.  Plus, it's very simple to make.

This recipe is AWESOME!  I followed exactly as recipe said and it came out moist and delicious.  Sometimes making something with peanut butter comes out dry but this is moist and just fantastic!  Went excellent with my chocolate cake.

OMG wow is this good!!!! I was a little worried at first cause a lot of people were saying it was thick & hard to spread, but I didn't have a problem with it. I made it exactly as called for & whipped it on high speed in my kitchen aid mixer & it was actually anything but thick. It was a tiny bit runnier than I expected it to be but not bad. I used this to frost too much chocolate cake from this site & my hubby & I were in heaven!!! It tasted like a giant cake of peanut butter cups! The frosting is phenomenal!!

this was so easy.I haven't frosted my chocolate cake yet but I tried it with a spoon and it's great! I kept adding milk a little at a time to get the consistency I wanted.Probably more like 5 tablespoons, but that's just personal preference.Thanks for sharing!

I topped chocolate cupcakes with this frosting for my boyfriend (who loves Reeses Peanut Butter Cups) and he adored them! I made sure to leave the peanut butter out for a few hours before to make sure it was easy to work with.

Yum! I like it a little more peanut-buttery so I add a tad more and it works just fine. Put it on a chocolate cake and ... heaven!

AMAZING.  End of story.  Love.  Used 1.25 cups of crunchy peanut butter, 2 cups of powdered sugar, and about 4 tablespoons milk.  I could not love it more.

I just made this icing, was pretty nervous after reading reviews and reading it was thick and hard to spread.  I followed the the measuments exact, used real butter (zapped in the microwave for 10 secs) , all 3 tbs of milk and added 1 tsp of vanilla.  Dumped it all in the bowl at one time and mixed with a hand mixer.  Turned out smooth, and fluffy! Fantastic!!

I followed the directions exactly and the icing turned out great. Piping it onto your cake, etc would probably be your best bet since the thickness makes it difficult to spread, but it's peanut butter- what else would you expect? Very tasty- almost like peanut butter fudge. I would definitely make again!

I dont like to give bad reviews but I think my failure may save another cook some heart ache.  I followed this recipe completely, and things were looking good until I added the confection sugar..... I nearly blew out the motor on my hand held mixer!  The frosting was very thick... and the oil from the peanut butter kept separating.  I used "No Name" peanut butter and my guess would be that the quality just wasnt there.  So this cook did the unthinkable and threw the whole batch in the garbage.  I may try this again... so many great reviews cannot be wrong...

This frosting was a big hit for my sons birthday party.  Make sure you whip it for a couple minutes like the recipe suggests to make it easier to spread.

DO NOT MICROWAVE THIS!  I was trying to make this in a hurry.  In order to soften the butter I cut butter into cubs and microwaved it for 5 seconds at a time moving the butter around each time so that it was not at all melted (it was probably perfect looking back)...  Anyway, this is a thick frosting and my mixer stinks!  I was impatient and after reading the advice of another review (who clearly only cares about the peanut butter deliciousness that is the frosting and not the fluffiness that is implied) thought that it was possible that I hadn't softened the butter enough and though she suggested 30 seconds I knew that that was too much and only did 12 and it was still ruinned!  It basically turned into peanut butter cookie dough = (  It tastes yum, but I have no idea what I'm going to use it for now?!? Maybe melt it down more?  Anyway, sorry to rant just trying to save someone else some heartache = I

I made this frosting this afternoon and it was amazing! You can add more or less sugar to make your desired consistency. I made mine more creamy so I added a lil' bit more milk. Great recipe!

This is a great recipe! It was a little bit too sweet for me, but that is just personal taste so I still gave it 5 stars. Next time I will use just a little less sugar and a little more peanut butter...hopefully that won't mess up the consistency too much!

Just made this frosting and mine came out perfect.  Fluffy and not overly sweet.  I used skim milk but did not measure it as I added. I cut the recipe in half and was just enough for 12 chocolate cupcakes. This is a keeper.

This frosting is very easy and delicious.  I used heavy cream instead of milk, just because I had some I needed to use up.  I didn't measure the cream, I just poured it in little by little until the frosting was nice and light.  As another reviewer pointed out, the butter should be softened, not just at room temperature and it comes out great and spread easily.  It's thicker than buttercream, but very easy to spread if you've made it by the directions.  My kids and husband just got to lick the leftovers off the beater and loved it too.  Great recipe as is...no need to make changes.

I overbeat this and made it more paste-y than fluffy.  I figured if a little beating made it fluffy, a little more wouldn't hurt - generally a good rule for frosting, but not this one.  I saw when it losts it's fluff.  So - the taste was good, and I'll use this recipe again.  I like that it wasn't overpoweringly sweet.  I made it with the cupcake portion only of black bottom cupcakes I from this site and sprinkled mini chips on top.  It definitely satisfied my chocolate peanut butter craving!

This had a good flavor but is so thick and rich going down. You have to take a drink after each bite or it coats your throat. Also, you probably want to refrigerate since it has milk, to be safe.

excellent recipe. easy, quick, and delicious. i used chunky peanut butter, cause that is all i had in the pantry and this was an emergency, and it came out great.... i used less confectioners sugar too, about half as much, cause i hafta watch my sugar, and it was still sweet and very easy to spread.

Followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out ok, was a really thick consistency and a little difficult to spread on a 9 X 13 cake but it was tasty. I would prefer a frosting that was a little lighter on the peanut butter flavor and a little more butter creamish. If you love peanut butter this might be just up your alley.

Don't whip the frosting for as long as it says to.  It looks chunkier the longer you whip it, so kind of eye ball it.  Super tasty though!

This frosting is delicious! I did have to add much more milk than the recipe called for to get the right consistancy though. One batch made enough to cover at least 35 cupcakes for me. I served this on top of the "Brownie Batter + Cupcake" recipe also from this site. Great combination!

I love peanut butter, but the frosting tasted too buttery for me. I did half the recipe, so that could explain it.

AWESOME!!!!!!! i lovee peanut butter and this had evrything i was looking for in a frosting. it was the perfect balance of sugar and peanut butter, not one overpowering the other. perfect! i used this to frost a cake mix i had in the pantry that i wanted to use up. can only imagine if i used it on the Too Much Chocolate Cake recipe, also found here. maybe add peanut buttr chips to the cake batter? yummy!!!!!

ohhh yum, I was pregnant and going though a peanut butter an chocolate phase, I swear I ate reeses peanut butter cups everyday and I decided to make brownies with peanut butter frosting. Of course I made my Husband eat them too and I was in heaven with this frosting, I could have ate a bowl of it by itself (remember I was Pregnant at the time). Anyhow I highly recommend this frosting for a perfect peanut butter taste that is light and fluffy. enjoy!

Good stuff. I used this for filling on a layer cake for my sons birthday. After the cake was cut, I could hear everyone saying as they ate it, "woah, there's peanut butter in here!" It was perfect, just what I was looking for.

I had to add quite a bit more milk to get the desired texture.  I also adapted by adding a few more ingredients.  Your recipe was good though.  I love anything with peanut butter in it!  Thanks for sharing.

This frosting was so good. It tasted like peanut butter fudge. I used it on cupcakes for my aunts birthday everyone loved it. It was a little hard to spread on the cupcakes but dipping my spatula in water did the trick. They were perfect for fall chocolate cupcakes, I put accorns made of Hershey Kisses on top. So cute!

Delicious frosting.  This recipe made enough to frost between two cake layers and spread some on top.  I didn't have enough to cover the sides, so I went with that.  It's absolutely delicious as I followed the recipe to a 't'.

I am giving this a 5 for taste, although my first attempt at making failed completely!! I followed the directions, and then took one reviewers suggestion that if it looked grainy to pop it into the microwave for 30 seconds. I recommend NOT doing this!!! It came out looking like rice krispy bars and I had to throw it all out and start over. The second time around worked great! I did end up adding two extra tablespoons of milk to get the right consistency. Will definitely use this over and over. I used it on "Grandma's Carrot Cake" recipe from this site. My grandma always used to use PB frosting on carrot & spice cakes. Sounds odd, but super Yummy! (I'm guessing people who have too thick, or crumbly frosting  has something to do with the peanut butter they are using. I have made this several times and never had issues...other than the first time when I microwaved it.)

This frosting was so easy to make and so delicious. I used a couple extra tablespoons of milk to make it a bit softer and easier to use in a decorating bag. It was perfect! Will definitely be using this frosting more often...huge hit in my book.

I think reading all of the reviews really helped modify this one.  I used 1 1/2 cups of powder sugar and only a little bit of 1/2 and 1/2.  I made sure it was super fluffy before adding any peanut butter.  It only took maybe a teaspoon of 1/2 and 1/2 to turn it fluffy.  I followed another person's suggestion and added the peanut butter a tablespoon or so at a time and then had my taste testers tell me when to stop.  I also used another person's suggestion and used reduced fat Jif.  I frosted a banana cake with this, and the finished product was described as "dangerous."

I have made this recipe twice now with somewhat better results the second time around. Both times I used it to frost a banana cake. I had two exceptions with this recipe. The first being that the frosting was too thin with the ingredient amounts as written. The second was that the frosting separated slightly showing a glisten of oil(from either the butter or the natural oil in the peanut butter)on the surface. I solved the first problem by cutting back on the butter to 3/4 of a stick of butter and increasing the confectioner's sugar to around 4-5 cups. The only way I could figure out how to fix the oil problem was to keep the frosting and whatever it was frosting refrigerated. Had it not been for these two small problems I would have given this one 5 stars.

My mom has made this frosting for years to top a store bought spice cake mix.  It helps to change the order in which you add the ingredients and to use everything at room temperature - cream the butter with a spoon, mix in the conf. sugar (the butter and sugar don't meld at this point so you will still see little flecks of yellow), add milk a little at a time, mixing WELL after each addition. If you don't stir well, you'll end up adding too much milk. If you do add too much, slowly add a little more confectionery sugar.  Once the frosting is smooth, I add one tablespoon at a time of PB until it reaches the right flavor.  I do not use an electric mixer and I use stick margarine, not butter.  I only use Jif creamy Peanut Butter. I sometimes had a quick splash of vanilla as well, but it does make it too sweet for some people's tastes.  This basic icing (without the PB) works great with other flavors as well - for Halloween we use orange flavoring and coloring to ice cut out pumpkins!

Yum!  Made for the "Brownie Batter + Cupcake = The SECOND BEST Cupcake. Ever" recipe on this site.  The cupcake part was pretty good...but the frosting was amazing.  I was eating the frosting right from the bowl.

This frosting is very tasty but being vegan, I had to use margerine (someone reviewed not to use margerine) and it was indeed very greasy.  I think the margerine made it a bit harder to spread, so I'll admit, I used my fingers for a lot of it.  I multiplied by 1.5 and had plenty to frost and fill an 8-inch two layer cake.  Yum!

I would give this 4.5 stars if it was an option. I love this. I was originally going to use it on brownies but that was way too sweet together. This is frosting that is thicker than a cake frosting but realllllly rich and yummy. I actually put it back in the fridge and it hardened up into an almost fudge consistency. My boyfriend loved that even more and said it tasted like pb fudge. Love this

Simply put... the best peanutbutter frosting around.  I couldn't stop licking the bowl, the spoon, the spreader.  Wonderful, not to thick but thick enough for topping my brownies that came out to dry.  This is the only thing that saved them.  My husband loved it too. Great recipe just "AS IS"

heaven in a bowl!  I made this twice, once for brownies, once for devil's food cake.  I think it was better on the brownies, with their dense, chocolate taste and texture.  the only change I made was a little less butter.  very easy, very good, thanks for sharing!

I made it according to recipe.  It worked out fine, really easy.    looks just like the picture from Dianne.  I used a food scale (and converted the recipe to metrics/grams for PB and butter) to help me know how much I had since measuring PB is tedious.   It is really yummy, it reminds me of reeses pieces.  My husband said "hmm, thats good".   Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly and had no problems with the consistency of this recipe. It was spreadable and definitely pipe-able as is. I frosted chocolate cupcakes with these and it was a good combination. Very peanut buttery and for my tastes, it wasn't too sweet but it was light so you could tell it was frosting. I'll definitely use this again, but most likely on brownies. Thanks for sharing!

I just made this recipe and want to say "WOW" not only is it delishous, but so easy. It's the best recipe I found so far for peanut butter icing. I followed the recipe and it was so fluffy and easy to work with. I highly recommend it and I'm not an icing person. Thank you for this fantastic recipe....

Like many others have said this is a difficult to spread, so I piped it onto my brownie cupcakes, that worked out very well.  It is fluffy with just enough peanut butter flavor, absolutely delicious! I will definitely make again!

I followed the recipe exactly, and I was hoping for something fluffier.  It ended up kind of oily and thick, and not fluffy. I'm glad I piped it onto cupcakes, because it would have been difficult to frost.

Oh my goodness.  This is the best peanut butter frosting ever.  Mine was very creamy and is definitely a keeper.

This frosting was delicious and an absolute dream on my chocolate cake. I don't know what some people are talking about; I followed the recipe exactly and had no trouble with it at all. It was a good consistency - very light and fluffy and just wonderful. I had a slight amount of trouble when spreading it, but due in no part to the frosting itself, which was very light and fluffy - the cake was just particularly delicate. All in all, this came out perfectly, and I'll definitely use it again.

Very good. I did not have a problem with the frosting being greasy. As for substitutions, I softened both the peanut butter and butter and the butter in the microwave before mixing. This eliminated the need for any milk. I also used just a little more peanut butter than the recipe calls for and sifted through the confectioners sugar while adding it to make the frosting extra smooth. I served it on top of mini brownies and it was a hit! Will definitely use again!

I followed this recipe exactly other than I halved it.  I used JIF peanut butter and real butter and it turned out perfectly.  I did not have the oiliness that oters talked about.  This is a simple recipe tht tastes fantastic on top of chocolate fudge brownies.

Very yummy! I didn't measure anything exactly how the recipe says. I mostly just "eyeballed" what looked like a cup of powdered sugar or tablespoon of milk until I was happy with the consistency and it turned out extremely delicious. Oh, and I only made half the recipe and it was just enough for 24 chocolate cupcakes.

Soo amazing! I didn't think it would be that good with only a few ingredients, but it was so stinking good. I added too much milk because one review said I would need more than it called for, but that made it thinner than I wanted. Even so, it was still the best frosting I've ever had or made.

Very good!!!  I didn't follow exactly but I am sure if I had it would still be 5 stars.  I only had a half cup of pb available, so I did 1/2 cup of butter 1/2 pb 1.5 cups powdered sugar, and 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, and probably close to 3 t milk I just added to the right consistancy.  Tasted like a Reese's frosting!!

Some 17 years ago when I was in my early teens my American Grandma was visiting us in Australia. While she was here she made a chocolate cake with peanut butter frosting. I have NEVER forgotten that cake, it was that good. So I finally decided to have a go myself. I followed this recipe exactly and the frosting turned out brilliantly. Delicious. Will DEFINITELY be making this again!

My family loved this!!! I used this to top brownies and it was awsome! This recipe made it into my cookbook. I think the key to getting this right is to add the milk as needed, I had to add about a tablespoon more. Also make sure you whip it good and it will be smooth and creamy.

This frosting, to me, tasted like peanut butter fudge.  I used it on a layer cake, and it was difficult to spread. Not because of stiffness, but because it didn't want to adhere to the cake.  It was a little rich for me.  I used it on a chocolate cake (made with chocolate pudding) and it pretty much took over the entire cake.  I probably will not make this again.

Delicious!  I used this frosting on a dark chocolate cake (two 9 inch pans).  I used about 1 1/3 cup confectioners sugar and a 1 1/2 cup Wegman's peanut butter.  I also substuted heavy cream for the milk.

If you like peanut butter, this frosting is for you!  It was absolutley delicious.  I put it on a chocolate cake made from a box mix and it transformed the cake into a chocolate, peanut butter masterpiece.  I read many of the reviews which made me a little paranoid that I was getting myself into something too complicated, but I followed the recipe exactly, except I might have added a tiny bit more milk.  (I just added milk until it was the consistency that I desired.)  I would agree with all of the other readers- the key is to make sure the butter is room temperature.  If it is, it just blends right in beautifully with the peanut butter. I have no idea why some people thought it was greasy.  Perhaps as one reader suggested, maybe they used bargain peanut butter? I used Skippy and I see other readers used Jif with no problem.  This recipe was fast and easy to make.  I will never put ready-made frosting on a chocolate cake ever again!

YUM!!! I am a peanutbutter FANATIC and this was AMAZING. Perfect blend of sweetness and peanut butter flavor. I used it as one of three different frostings I used on banana cupcakes (recipe also from this site YUM). I had enough to frost 22 cupcakes and I have half of it left! Brownies here I come! (or i might just eat it with a spoon)

I'm new to the baking scene and I love trying new recipes...this one is a keeper!  I make chocolate peanut butter cupcakes and pb&j cupcakes!   I did change it up a little though...instead of all milk, I used 2 parts cream cheese and 1 part milk :)  I also added about 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract.   I don't own an electric mixer...so I did it all by hand!  phew!  my hands are tired...but it was well worth it!

I used heavy whipping cream because I wanted it to be really fluffy.... otherwise followed the recipe pretty much right. It was a little too sweet for me, but not for my 3 year old daughter who's birthday cake it iced! Yum! Next time I make it I'll use less sugar

This was the best peanut butter frosting I've ever tasted (shh ... don't tell my mom).  It wasn't dry at all, and had a nice, spreadable texture.  I used Jif Honey Roast, which gave it an extra sweetness and may have helped with the smoothness.  It tastes amazing too.  I couldn't keep sampling it!  I will definitely be making this again!

Turned out perfect!  I used the frosting on top of banana cupcakes.  I also put the frosting on with a cake decorating frosting bag and tip so I had no trouble with it being too stiff to spread.

Really yummy and creamy! I don't like super thick frosting so I halved the recipe for brownies and it was perfect!

This frosting was absolutely delicious.  We simply mixed the incredients together because my hand beater broke. Still turned out wonderful.

I made exactly as recipe says and it's perfect. I don't like P.B. and I'm licking the bowl! I iced cup cakes with it [my first time] and it was wonderful. Thank you so much my son is going to love it and I might convert to P.B after this!

A really great, peanut-buttery recipe!  It's very rich, and I can imagine that it would go well with brownies.  I made it with the "Black Magic Cake" recipe from this site.  The only change I made was the addition of 1 tsp vanilla.

This is perfect!  We have a small local bakery that makes the best peanut butter frosted chocolate cake.  I have searched a while to find something similar and this is it!  It is very important to beat this until it is the consistancy you like.  The longer you beat it the fluffier it gets.  Thanks for the recipe. I will use this again and again.

Oh wow this was excellent frosting! I love watching it turn into frosting with every T of milk you add :) I had to use 4T of milk and added a little vanilla to it but holy peanut butter awesomeness! I used it on Chocolate Peanut Butter Wacky Cake from this site in place of the recipe icing. You gotta try this stuff! Whats better than chocolate and peanut butter in one bite? :)

MMMMM! I made a few adjustments as suggested~ 2 c. powdered sugar & 2-3 T. milk and a splash vanilla...I had to make brownies for girl scout sleepover, and am waiting for them to chill so I can cut/wrap. Right now, my daughter is trying to scrape every last drizzle out of the bowl!!! Unfortunately, some poor girl scout is going to have to get a smaller one than everyone else, because I'm snitching some for myself!! I'll have to bake a pan for home tomorrow!!! Thanks for the suggestions! Its a keeper!

Perfect for my sister's birthday cupcakes!  I honestly didn't measure the peanut butter, just put in two big spoonfuls - and used 2 T milk. You really need to use real butter for this to work, not margarine.

Made this to use with the "Too Much Chocolate Cake" (made cupcakes instead of a bundt cake) recipe that is on AllRecipes.  I followed the directions exactly and it was delicious!  I brought the cupcakes into work and my co-workers LOVED them!  I will definitely make this peanut buttery, delicious frosting again!

This frosting was fantastic. I spread it on chocolate cupcakes and it was just a perfect pairing. My step dad is obsessed with peanut butter and he flipped when I gave him some. Thumbs way up, I'll be using this recipe over and over again

As written, this recipe was a little too buttery for my taste. I added more peanut butter (about 1/2 cup) and a dash of vanilla, and it was yummy. Made more than enough for my 8" 2-layer cake.

This recipe was good but not exactly what I was looking for (trying to replace my grandmothers, lost peanut butter frosting recipe).  I should have known by the title that it may not be as creamy as I was looking for.  It was extremely light, and fluffy and looked slightly loose looking.  I'm guessing that was because the butter was a little over softened and the peanut butter was seperating slightly.  Overall it was good but I will keep looking.

Great recipe, quick and easy. I used this recipe substituting Nutella instead of Peanut Butter and used it to frost a banana cake. I loved the finished texture and taste. I had made extra as I didn't know how much I would need for the cake. My husband ended up using the leftovers for a fruit dip (YUM!). I will be making this again this weekend but with Peanut Butter this time to frost a chocolate cake.

This is a delicious peanut butter frosting. I used skim milk instead of whole milk or cream. I think it affected the smoothness of the frosting when i piped it onto cupcakes. Overall this is a delicious recipe.

The flavor was great, but my batch came out really thick and hard to spread. Next time I think I'll mix it longer and add a bit more liquid to thin it out.

This frosting was GREAT. I put it on brownies and they were gone in no time.  Next time I will us 3/4 c. of butter, 1 1/2 of peanut butter and 3 cups of sugar,(I would have liked to have a little more) as for the milk I didn't keep track of how many tbs. I used.  I just kept adding as needed.  This one is definately a keeper.

Very good recipe! Fast and with things you have around the house.  Added two table spoons of cocoa powder and a little more milk.

O.M.G.  FABULOUS!  I made a layered cake (with chocolate fudge frosting in the middle).  It was banana cake and my favorite two things together are banana and peanut butter, so I made this frosting.  I can't wait to actually try the whole thing together when I eat it tomorrow after I give it to my friend!  It spread perfectly.  I kept dipping my knife in warm water.  I had no problems with it spreading.  I will definitely make this again!

Made carrot muffins but had no cream cheese for icing. Found this recipe, only had chunky peanut butter, still gave it a try. The result was awesome. Chunky peanut broke down into grit size as whipped. I only made 1/4 batch enough for 10 muffins and cut down icing sugar coz' I prefer less sweet. Spread the frosting instead of piped it.

This is really good - was just what the recipe promies.  You gotta make sure you start out with cold butter.  If the frosting is too thick, keep adding a few drops of milk until you get that creamy and fluffy consistency.

This is the best peanut butter frosting recipe I've tried.   I found that the milk measurement isn't exact.  I've had to add milk till getting that light, fluffy frosting consistency (way more than 3 tbsp)  Delish!!!!!!!

I doubled the milk (6tbsp total) but otherwise followed the recipe as written. AMAZING results! I baked brownies from a mix. Then used cookie cutters to make heart shaped brownies, layered the fluffy PB frosting in the middle, and piped a heart of fluffy PB frosting on top. DELICIOUS! I had extra time and even piped "Happy Valentine's Day!" along the edge of the plate. Very easy to spread and pipe! 1 batch made quite a lot, & it's so good I just can't waste it so I'm contemplating what else I can bake and to use up the leftovers. My son licked the beaters & my hubby licked the spoon. Definitely a new favorite!

It was very good - I listened to another reviewer and cut the amount of powdered sugar to 1 1/2 cups and increased the heavy whipping cream to 3 tablespoons.  It spread perfectly!

This was the perfect mix of ingredients.  We cut the recipe in half for our smaller dessert, but kept the milk close to 3Tbsp.  Definitely have everything at room temperature and it will be fluffy!

I followed the recipe exactly as written, and this turned out PERFECTLY. Be patient with the mixing; it will get fluffier after a few minutes. I used this frosting on 24 cupcakes, and there was plenty. The cupcakes were a food channel recipe-- using brownie mix and filled with peanut butter chips!!

This was phenomenal tasting.  Of course I love anything peanut butter. I only had crunchy peanut butter, which adds some crunch, but if I were going to frost a cake with this, I would use creamy.  Next time, I am going to be more careful about gradually adding the powdered sugar.  I was in a hurry to frost the chocolate muffins, and perhaps should have mixed it a bit longer too.  But it was delicious!

This made a great filling for a chocolate cake.  I used a chocolate ganache for the top and sides of a four layer cake and this was a perfect light and fluffy filling to offset the rich chocolate.  Next time I think I'll frost the whole cake with this- but it might need to be doubled to do that.

Too bad 10 stars is not an option. This is AMAZING. I alternated milk and sugar and it was creamy from start to finish. I just poured in milk from container w/o measuring and I would have to say it is more than 3 tbsp. More like 5 or 6. I am serving tonight for my daughters bday on choc cucakes with a half a peanut butter cup on top!! (if i can stop eating the frosting!!!) Deeeelish. Thanks so much for sharing.

I made this frosting recipe for my daughter birthday cake and it was perfect. I didnt have a hard time spreading it all all. It was so smooth and fluffy on the cake. She loved it. I wanted to sample some on the spoon before it went on the  cake. And I loved the taste.  A great frosting!

Awesome!  This was very easy to work with and tasted delicious!  I put this on top of the Too Much Chocolate Cake recipe that I turned into cupcakes and topped it with mini chocolate chips.  They were heavenly!  Great frosting recipe.  Make sure you work with room temperature butter.  I used Jif PB and it was great!

I made this for a chocolate three layer cake.  I had made it twice.  The first time I mixed it throughly as indicated, but the frosting ended up not being fluffy.  The next batch I did not over mix and it was fluffy.  I think if you add all the powdered sugar it becomes less whipped.  I had to keep in the frig otherwise the icing would slide/melt off the cake!

I had to make this recipe twice. The first time, the whole thing seized up and turned into this oily, crumbly mess. Since it got such high reviews, I figured I did something wrong. I skipped the milk entirely the next time through and let it mix for a LONG time with each sugar addition. Came out great and everyone said it reminded them of a reese's pieces.

I love peanut butter and this recipe is delicious. I had some left and will probably end up eating it out of the fridge all week!!
It was a thicker frosting and I think it might be tough to spread on cake, but for my brownies it worked great.
I ommitted the salt.

One word: delicious!

It takes a lot of beating before it gets fluffy, but the effort is totally worth the work!

Amazing. I made as directed, and would make again with no changes. I used this to frost a pan of brownies I threw some chopped peanut butter cups into, and while the frosting was the best part no one felt it overpowered the brownies too much. Thanks so much for sharing :)

My 12 year old son made it the first time.  Easy and delicious! It has become a family favorite.  Perfect topping for a chocolate sheet cake.  Will be loved by anyone who loves peanut butter.

PERFECTION! I made this exactly as the recipe calls and it was perfect. I whipped the heck out of it with my KitchenAid mixer and it was really fluffy. I used it to ice the Too Much Chocolate Cake on this website. Let me say, I bake cakes ALL the time...I have never had such a response. People were going nuts for this cake. I will def. make again. Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious.  I enjoyed scraping the bowl :o)  It is hard to spread, so I microwaved it for 20 seconds and that helped (but it also separated slightly which ruined the look but not the taste).

WOW!  This was insanely easy to make and even better to eat.  There is no way to mess this recipe up.  I topped a Dark Chocolate cake with this yummy frosting.  It's perfect, not too sweet at all.  My turned out fluffy and perfect!

I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out precisely how it was described. It was fluffy and yummy. I received many compliments. I used this recipe on half of a brownie cake and used a chocolate icing on the other half. To my surprise the peanut butter half disappeared first!

MMMMMMMMMMMM! This is perfect with chocolate cake or cupcakes. It may be way too rich for brownies. I didn't have an electric mixer so it wasn't as fluffy or smooth, but I was still able to make it spreadable and yummy!

OMG... So good.  I have been sneaking into the fridge at night just to eat a spoonful of icing.
I went a little lighter on the sugar and used a whipping cream.

The flavor of this pb frosting is awesome!  I screwed it up by adding too much milk- be careful, it'll get grainy and gross w/ too much milk.  I ended up adding more pb, more butter, and more powdered sugar, and the texture improved.  I guess I basically doubled the recipe!
Great on brownies.

Very easy to make, my 2 & 6 year olds  even helped . We followed the directions exactly, it came out great. Tip > dont icing a hot or even warm cake , the icing will look greasy and melt. We were excited to get eating the choc cake & icing. The other half of the cake they put icing on when it was completely cool and it was GOOD. Peanut butter taste but not to overpowering. The icing sets up nicely and doesn't get to stiff.  Good icing we think, try it for yourself and see what you think.

This is a fantastic recipe! I have made it three times and will be making it again in a couple minutes. I have always used it the same way.... on brownies. I chop peanuts and put them on top of the frosting and the brownies turn out great. I will next time try it on cupcakes.

I found this recipe to be pretty good and not difficult at all.  I followed instructions pretty good and took one person's advice to use more milk and it was great - very creamy.  However, next time would use a little less peanut butter as it was a little TOO peanuty for me.

I used this with the Frosted Banana Bar recipe on this site.  It is very good, but I needed to use at least twice as much of the milk the recipe calls for to get the consistency that I was looking for.

This recipe was great!  I used it on a 9 inch layer cake and everyone just raved.  When making a layer cake again I will make a double batch so there is plenty to ice the cake as well as satisfy all the spoon & bowl lickers in my house!

I followed the recipe exactly and I think it tastes absolutely great!  The only thing I didn't like about the recipe is the consistency after I beat the frosting.  I had the perfect spreading consistency and was extremely pleased with everything up until the very end when the recipe calls to beat the frosting for at least 3 minutes.  I didn't even beat it for 2 minutes because the frosting started getting very thick and "cookie dough-like".  I even tried adding more milk which helped a little, but I would recommend not beating the frosting at the end, unless you want a harder more dough-like frosting.

Great frosting! I love how this frosting is not too sweet or overpowering. I used natural peanut butter because I find the regular kind too heavy and sugary. Skippy makes a nice natural peanut butter that doesn't require stirring and doesn't have that layer of oil sitting on top. The traditional natural peanut butter probably wouldn't have worked well with this recipe.  But the Skippy was great! I also made sure to allow the Kitchen Aide mixer to do its thing for about 5 mins. I stopped it periodically to scrape down the sides of the bowl and to note the texture. If it was too grainy I added a splash of non-dairy creamer (allergic to milk protein)and let it continue to mix. Don't cut the mix-time short because you'll end up with heavy unspreadable frosting. Mine turned out fluffy, easy to spread and there was plenty for a double layer nine-inch cake. I used a German Chocolate box mix..great combo. Also tried it with a blob of cool whip on top...awesome! I can't wait to try it on brownies!

Great recipe! I used heavy cream instead of milk and a little more powdered sugar than called for.  Delicious!

I wanted something to put on top of my brownie cupcakes, and this frosting is perfect!  It's so airy, and neither overwhelming in sweetness nor in peanut-butter-iness: absolutely delicious.  (I made it on a humid night, so almost no milk was needed, until I mixed it too long and it began to solidify - at that point, I just added a splash of milk and it was fine.)  Great recipe.

WOW! I used Kroger brand creamy peanut butter and Kroger brand butter.  Creamed them together and they were light and fluffy. I added sugar a bit at a time.  I then added milk as instructed.  SUPER creamy.  SUPER fluffy.  Great taste.  It was also as spreadable as any icing I've ever used.  Oh, and I used a hand mixer.  I normally hand beat/whip EVERYTHING, but this recipe really needs the extra horsepower.

This frosting was fabulous!  It has a great peanut butter taste and is not too sweet.  I put this on a peanut butter cake, but would like to try it on a banana cake, too.  If you like peanut butter, this frosting is one to try!

I've been trying for a long time to find just the right peanut butter icing and now I have!!! I did add a teaspoon of vanilla and a bit more milk. This is a keeper for my favorite devils food cake with a cup of hot coffee in it! Perfect pair!Thanks!

I used this recipe to fill a number of cakes that I decorated for others and haven't got a complaint yet!  If you use cream in it, it will stiffen up on you, since this is the nature of cream anyway. Half and half works beautifully if you are looking for that extra creaminess. Tastes amazing when you fill a chocolate fudge cake with it.

I made this to go on a chocolate cake. I couldn't get the texture right so it wasn't very fluffy but it still tasted very yummy. I'll try it again and see if i can get it to fluff up.

Very nice recipe and does come out as written. If you love peanut butter this is the one for you. I did start out with frozen butter and followed everything as written. It was a tad hard to spread but I added two tablespoons of light corn syrup. It thinned it enough to spread and as an added bonus it dried with a slight crackle.

I accidentally added too much milk so mine was a little thin, but this frosting is very smooth and tastes great!  I also added about a 1/2 tsp of vanilla in with my first tablespoon of milk.  Used this on the Chocolate Mayo Cake recipe from this site..yummy!

I made a chocolate cake but ran out of vanilla for the frosting and this is one of the few recipes that doesn't require it. I've NEVER had peanut butter frosting and I thought this wouldn't be that great...BOY was I WRONG this is my new favorite I followed the directions to the T and this came out perfect!

AMAZING and EASY!!!! Just follow the directions. If you try to doctor it it won't taste as good. Just make sure, as the recipie states, that everything is at room temperature. I forgot to make sure the milk was at room temperature so I actually heated it up in the microwave for 15 seconds. (I needed it to spread a little better too, so I did add a little extra milk - "AS NEEDED" just like the recipie said!) I even used a generic brand of peanut butter, and it turned out perfect! I had to double the recipie, bigger cake and my husband ate it out of the bowl faster than I could frost the cake!! 

Thanks for sharing!!

Definitely a GREAT recipe.  I've had marriage proposals at work (from other women) because of this frosting!  Works well on cakes, brownies... you name it.  Definitely beat as long as possible to get the fluffy texture.  Also, I sometimes substitute whipping cream for milk for an extra rich flavor.

This is a very good, easy recipe. I actually give this 4 1/2 stars. If I was a peanut butter freak like my daughter and husband, I'd give it 5 stars. LOL 

I made this last night according to the directions and the consistency was perfect to frost my two layer cake. It was easy to spread and the flavor was very good. 

My family really enjoyed it and it's going in my vault of recipes! :)

It is wonderful!! I added more milk, less sugar and it turned out better than I thought it would be! I'm convinced that peanut butter isn't just "partners" with jelly!!

Decent recipe, husband liked it, but I wouldn't exactly describe it as "fluffy". I used Smucker's 'natural' peanut butter and it was a little gritty and the oil separated. I recommend using the regular! Make sure the butter is softened (the stick will bend slightly) and add milk AS NEEDED... I ended up using almost a half a cup of milk. I used this on a chocolate cake, melted chocolate chips and smoothed a layer on top of that. DELICIOUS! Like a peanut butter cup...

Yummy! I used this on top of my homemade brownies. 

Method: As directed. I needed to add only 1 TBSP of whole milk. 

Changes: I added 1 tsp vanilla extract for more depth. 

Reactions: (mouth full of brownie) "MmmmmMmm. Can I have another?"

This frosting is amazing!  I made half a batch for my cake because I don't like a lot of frosting.  I used reduced fat peanut butter and ended up adding a tad more milk but otherwise kept the recipe just as is it. My boyfriend could not get enough of this frosting!!!

I agree that this is a very good recipe. Also, if it was a little too stiff to spread, all  one had to do was incorporate a little more cream or milk to make it spreading consistency.  Good recipe Nickie 75!

This is a WONDERFUL peanut butter icing receipe. I used it on my favorite chocolate cake and the receipe gave me a generous amount of icing, that was not overpowering. Thank you so much for sharing. Will DEFINATELY make again.

This recipe is the easiest way to make a batch of brownies really brilliant. Simple and incredibly rewarding. It can be a bit on the sugary-sweet side, but when used sparingly gets great praise. Wonderful for those of us who prefer our chocolate with peanut butter!

This frosting was pretty good.  I think it called for too much sugar, it turned out very sweet.  I put it on brownies and it was yummy.

This is an excellent recipe.  You just have to make sure to use stick butter or else your frosting will end up clumpy and unspreadable.

This recipe ROCKED! It was cloud like in texture and it melts in your mouth, the flavor was so good. My picky husband loved it! I did add vanilla.... and it just took a little spreading to get it on the cupcakes. This will be added to my favorites list!

This was really good. My 3 yr. old son tasted it out of the bowl and says "woo-hoo". Just make sure your cake or whatever you're putting it on is completely cool or the peanut butter will melt and the milk will seperate from it a little. I should have been more paitient with the cooling. Oh well, great recipe and I will definitely use this one again.

DELISH! I think the key to making it fluffy is to beat the tar outta the peanut butter/ butter mixture and then beating the tar outta it when everything is mixed. I used chunky peanut butter, and it still turned out fine. I will use this again and again!

Truly fabulous. I made this for my chocolate cupcakes.  I used Honey Peanut Butter, so I reduced the sugar added to taste.  Also, used soy milk, and it was wonderful- Can't wait to make it again, and I will make MORE so I can "clean the bowl"! :)

Wow! This was great, it was fluffy and had a wonderful peanut butter flavor. I only used 1 1/2 cups confectioners sugar, and a slight amount more milk. I thought it was very sweet, and good. Hubby liked it too.

Wonderful, creamy texture. I used margarine (instead of butter) and soy milk (instead of milk) as to make it non-dairy and it came out just delicious. I needed all 3 tablespoons of soy milk. This frosting has just the right peanut buttery taste. Highly recommended.

if you are looking for a frosting that is sickenly sweet, this is not it!  i have never had frosting like this before!  i used this with the one bowl chocolate cake recipe from this site and i was pleasently surprised at how perfect the flavor was.  i used all natural peanut butter with this one.  it will satisfy a sweet tooth, but even if you over indulge it will not make you sick.

I followed the directions and this frosting turned out perfectly. I only used the 3 tbsp of milk recommended and it was a perfect spreading consistency. Used it to frost the One Bowl Chocolate Cake from this site and topped with chopped peanut butter cups. Outstanding!

This recipe was perfect for my two peanut butter lovers born in January....my daughter and my boyfriend.  I used it on rich chocolate cake recipe I found on the site and it was perfect.  Not overpowering or two sweet. My daughter can't keep a spoon out of the left over icing in the fridge!
