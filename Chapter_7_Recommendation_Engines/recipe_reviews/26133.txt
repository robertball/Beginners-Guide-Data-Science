This is the best cookie dough I have ever worked
with.  I own a gourmet shop and made Valentine's cookies to sell, they were fabulous! Make sure you
properly chill the dough before working with it.
It's the best!

This was "ok".  One of only two, 5 star recipes,
I wasn't happy with.  It's not as flaky and light as I like my cookies.  I have one my cousin gave me that calls for 2 sticks of butter and it's much lighter and tastier.  I tried this one because everyone commented on how easy it was to work with.  It is easy but the flavor is more important to me that the texture of the dough.  My family is used to tasting the cream cheese and it wasn't there with these cookies.  I'll try to post Lynda's Cream Cheese cookies in case anyone is interested.

I loved this recipe!  I looked at the reviews first, so I added 1/2 tsp salt and 1/8 tsp nutmeg to the recipe and they added so much flavor! the cookies really held their shape and everyone loved them

This was by far the easiest dough that I've worked with and the cookies were great.  I took them to two different functions in one day and everyone wanted the recipe.  Thanks so much for sharing!

These are such good cookies! I've been making this recipe for years, they are REALLY good...my variation: sandwich two cookies together with raspberry jam, and roll in powdered sugar. Hmmm...thought I had some cream cheese in the fridge!

These were great!  I put them in the refrigerator for an hour and they were way to sticky, so I ended up leaving them for about 3-4 hours and they were perfect.  I did split up the dough into 4 pieces and when I rolled them I had the counter covered in a mixture of powdered sugar and flour (they say that will keep your cookies from getting to tough).  The only problem, if you can call it a problem is that the tops got bubbly and I frosted them anyway and so there was no big deal.

This dough was easier to work with when I divided it into smaller pieces (4 sections instead of 2) and, as others noted, refridgerated it until well chilled (4-6 hours.) I worked with only one small portion at a time, used a generous dusting of flour on both the countertop and top of the dough, and also used only small cookie cutters. I ended up with nearly 70 delicious heart and star shaped cookies and had very little trouble with sticky dough.

I tried this cream cheese version of the traditional sugar cookie and I it received "WOWs" from my co-workers.  Then I made them again for my family and I think they'll now expect me to make these all the time.  Great recipe! Just be sure to use a LOT of flour when rolling them out.

Wonderful! I used this recipe for Christmas cut-outs. Extremely moist and soft. I frosted and froze them and they were still great.  I had NO TROUBLE with sticky dough. You will need a floured surface each time you roll out the dough and flour the rolling pin too.

These worked wonderfully for me! I always used another cut-out recipe but decided to try something new. I saved this recipe when Christina's fabulous Easter cookie pictures popped up. I followed the recipe to a "T" and refrigerated my dough overnight. It was a breeze to work with and the cookies kept their shape very well. I will definitely be using this recipe in the future :)

These were EXCELLENT! The dough was great to work with (after refrigeration), and they did not spread one bit which was great! They had a wonderful buttery taste as well. This is my new go to cut-out cookie recipe. Thanks for posting :)

I've found my perfect cutout cookie.  My husband, who doesn't like "sugar" cookies, really loved these.  Because they aren't too sweet, they're perfect for decorating with icing or candies.  I just used this recipe to make jack-o-lantern cookies that I sanded with colored sugars.  I also liked them because they didn't expand much in the oven and really held the shape of the cutters.

These were awesome cookies! They came out perfect! It was my first time rolling out cookies and they were very easy to make. I used the Sugar Cookie Glaze by Cyndi from this site and the 2 together were perfect! Not too sweet and just the right amount of flavor. I stored them in a air tight container and they stayed soft and chewy. I will definitely be using this recipe again!

We love these cookies.  My son has so much fun using his cookie cutters with this dough.  Us adults also love it because it is more sophistacted than plain sugar cookies.  We like with or without frosting.

I tried 4 different cut out cookie  recipes this year and this one was the best by far.  They have a great sweet flavor without being too sweet. The dough is very easy to work with and they held their shape perfectly after being baked.  I rolled them 1/4 in. thick and baked them at 375 degrees for 7-8 min. so they were very soft and moist.  It will be the only cut out recipe I will be using from now on.

These cookies are excellent...light and yummy.....i had to use lots of powdered sugar and a little flour when rolling them out and i shortened the cooking time a bit but i live in south florida and i tend to have to battle the humidity when i bake....

i cut out star shapes for christmas and drizzle them with white and dark chocolate....my brother in law asks for them every year now....

Thanks for an awesome recipe that is now a part of our family tradition!

Don't let these get brown in the oven, and as soon as you put them on a wire rack to cool, brush with a powdered sugar glaze.  They stay very moist and they are a all time favorite with friends and family.  (I color the dough for the season, green shamrocks, red hearts, depends on the holiday)

The cream cheese adds a little more flavor to these cookies over just using butter.  I did add 2 1/2 cups flour and the dough was still pretty soft, even after chilling for 2 hours in the fridge.  Could be that I used fat-free cream cheese which has more liquid that the regular.  Still, the dough is easy to roll out, and the flavor is excellent.  Will use this recipe from now on!

Loved these recipes but I think I used more cream cheese than called for because I didn't have a good way to weight out 3 ounces from an 8 ounce tub, so I eyeballed it.  I love these cookies!  I didn't cut them out but instead did the first batch as balls, and balls they remained!  So for the next batch I smashed them down into disc for a more traditional cookie shape.  The texture on these is GREAT, but I don't have an electric mixer so I creamed the butter, cream cheese, and sugar with a fork.  This left small pea sized dollops of cream cheese in the dough, making it look like biscuit dough.  But I think that actually HELPED the texture, making the cookies flaky yet tender, like a biscuit.  These cookies have a great taste that's not too sugary and sweet, much more appeasing to an adult palette.

I really enjoyed the taste of these cookies; I had never made cream cheese cookies before. I chilled the dough for multiple hours,but they were way too sticky to use cookie cutters, so I just dropped them on the sheet like chocolate chip cookies.  I will use this recipe again unless I find one that is less sticky.

I LOVE these sugar cookies - but icing is a must.  I let the dough set up in the refrigerator overnight.  I rolled out the dough to about 1/4 inch thick between two pieces of wax paper - much easier than on just a floured surface.   I used an icing made from crisco, powdered sugar, milk and vanilla.  not the traditional icing - this was light and fluffy.
A big hit with everyone!

I used this recipe to make "stained glass cookies."  I cut out shapes in the cookies and filled these holes with crushed LifeSavers.  They turned out great!

Very delicious cookie.  So moist. Don't overbake or roll too thin.  I used vanilla frosting, but cream cheese frosting would be good too.

Good, I had lost my recipe to the ones I normally make and found this one as a substitute and think that this one is just as good if not better. It will remain in my personal cook book and used again. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Not great at all. Many people have suggested trying cream cheese cut outs and I am pretty disappointed. Not much flavor and the texture is not great either.

Great cut-out cookies. I decorated them using royal icing and I must admit, they were hard to resist! Very good when decorated, I didn't care too much for the cookies by themselves. The dough is much easier to work with when thoroughly chilled.

I didn't really like these very much.  I didn't find them all that easy to roll out and the texture wasn't flaky at all - more cakey.  Without the icing these don't taste like much of anything.

This is the first recipe I've used to make sugar cookies with my children aged 10, 7, and 3.  The dough was easy to make and easy to work with and taste FANTASTIC!  I made Delilah's frosting from her cookie recipe - and they are a HUGE HIT with the family and my co-workers.  I'm going to make more this week-end!

Dough was very sticky. I added an extra cup of flour. Still sticky.

I am very disappointed. Removed from frig after an hour to roll. Still no change in dough. Will leave the dough in over night to see if that will help. If not i will toss it out.

This was the stickiest dough I have ever worked with.  The cookie has a good flavor which we enjoyed but not the extra work in trying to roll it out.  I think this would probably work better if it had 1/4 c more flour.

This was my first time ever rolling out dough, so the first batch didn't come out too well.  But I chilled the dough longer and got the hang of it.  The cookies tasted fabulous and were moist and soft.

I prefer a sweeter and thicker sugar cookie, so next time I would add more sugar and roll out thicker. Can't taste the cream cheese. But the Dough was excellent to work with. This is a great and easy basic sugar cookie!

I doubled the recipe and refridgerated the dough over night.  This is the best tasting cut out recipe I have ever made.  I try a new one every year.  I will keep this for next year.  I also made the icing with cream cheese.

I have never been able to get Sugar Cookies right until this recipe.  My daughter and I made them and the whole family was impressed.  Even those who normally don't like sugar cookies liked these.  The dough was very easy to work with and the taste was great.  After reading the other reviews I think I will roll mine a little thicker next time, but that is a matter of preference.  This cookie had no bad points in our opinion.  We will make them again!

I made this with the kids in my class for Valentine's Day. We put red food coloring in 1/3 of the dough and cut out hearts, put them on top of the plain dough, and sprinkled red sugar on top. The kids liked making them and they tasted pretty good, too!

After refrigerating for about 24 hours, this dough *was* easy to work with, the easiest of any cut out cookies I have tried.  I'm still trying to decide if I am a fan of the softer texture.  We made these with sprinkles on top and they were not my husband's favorite, but I have a feeling he would have loved them with icing on top, he is a big fan of iced cookies.  The children enjoyed working with the dough and sprinkles to make the cookies.  I will probably try these again with icing.  Thank you for the recipe.

I made these and I have to say, without icing, they are very bland. Also the dough was very sticky, and I refrigerated it overnite. I had to work VERY quickly and in VERY small batches. I did not want to make the dough tough, so I lightly floured the rolling pin and the rolling surface which was a parchment paper covered counter top. 
BUT I gave it three stars because the cookie was tender and soft, which is what I prefer. Also, when I frosted them with anise and vanilla flavored butter cream frosting, they were very good tasting.

Batter very sticky. Added 4 heaping tablespoons of flour to batter. Refrigerated ~3 hours and it was easy to handle after that. Cookies came out great!

thanks for a marvelously easy recipe!  The only addition I'll make in the future is the add about 1/4 tsp of salt just to balance the sweetness and bring it out more.  Good by themselves with a glass of cold milk or frosted.

This was the best cut-out cookie I have ever made!  The dough was easy to work with after being chilled for about five or six hours.  I rolled them out with powdered sugar instead of flour, and that left them with a sweet coating on them.  I will make these every year from now on!

Just the right amount of "sweet!" I added a bit more flour than the recipe demanded. I used about 2 3/4cups of flour and it turned out splendid.

This dough was too sticky for my liking- I use a recipe I found on here "soft Christmas cookies" for all my cut out cookies and it is the best ever. Thought I would give this a try as I had extra cream cheese, don't think I'll use it again.

Great recipe.  This will replace my old cut-out recipe.  The taste and texture of the final product are great.   I added a bit of lemon zest for a bit more flavor.  The dough was sticky, but I divided it into 4 small batches prior to refrigerating for several hours.  I only worked a small bit at a time and left the remaining dough in the refrigerator until it was time to roll and cut.

I chilled dough for 12 hours, followed recipe to a "T", yet it was sticky and difficult to roll.  I added flour, and the end result was a hard not very tasty cookie.

Good, not great. They were the last cookies to go Christmas '06. Tip: make dough fairly thick (1/4")otherwise, they get to crisp.

Wow! These cookies worked perfectly to make Christams cut-out cookies! I refrigerated the dough overnight, which made rolling it out super easy. I was able to make about 4 cookie sheets-worth of cookies from just one batch. They are not too sweet, so icing will not overpower them. Also, the cookies did not spread too much in the oven (8 minutes was the perfect cooking time) and they also stayed pretty thick, just be sure to let the cookies set on the sheets for a few minutes before you take them off. I'll be using this recipe from now on! Thanks!!

These are the most delicious cookies I've ever baked. They taste even more delicious after drizzling some semi-sweet chocolate over the cookies.
The dough was quite sticky but I found after refrigerating it for almost 2 hours, and ofcourse using flour to roll the dough, they turned out wonderful :D

I can only give this recipe 3 stars based on what I've done so far.  The dough tastes wonderful but the dough was extremely sticky.  I had to use a TON of flour, and had to brush it off before baking.  I still have some dough left and based on the reviews that I have re-read, I'll let it refrigerate overnight.  I also didn't yield 48 cookies.  My cut outs are about 3 inches and I only got about 10-12 if you count the strange looking pieces.  So go small or double up on the recipe.  I just got them out of the oven and they cook quickly.  I am going to give the recipe one more try.

Dough was very sticky but we managed, we made Santa faces and Christmas trees. I thought the cookies were rather flavorless but my 7yo loved them and ate almost all...with cookie crumbs hanging off his mouth, he yelled '5 stars!' so I guess 5 stars it is....

Excellent cookie. Crunchy around the outside and soft in the middle. I used lots of flour when rolling and added a bit more cream cheese and vanilla. Not the prettiest cookie as the top can get kind of crackly but delicious!! Thank you.

This recipe worked beautifully. I rolled them very thick, and they turned out soft, and maintained their shape. In my opinion this recipe is so close to cookie bouquet's secret recipe. My boyfriend and I ate them non stop till our stomachs hurt.

After reading all those good reviews I had high hopes for this recipe. But it didn't turn out great. The cookies weren't not as creamy as expected, maybe if the cream cheese would be substituted with cream fraiche and a lemon yogurt icing. Not gonna make them again. Only 2 stars out of 5.

I was a little upset with this recipe. The dough was very sticky (even after 1.5 hours refrigerated & 20 minutes in the freezer) and diffcult to cut out shapes. I cut out 3-4 inch hearts, and this only made 18 cookies. Also, without some sort of frosting, the cookies are rather bland.

These were ok. Reminded me of animal crackers. They keep well when left out for days. Taste better after they are a day old. Held shape well.

The flavor of this cookie is good, but the dough is SO soft. I had to work with it practically right out of the freezer, and my husband's hands almost melted it immediately. I also recommend rolling it out closer to 1/4 inch thick, and baking it longer. The first tray were under baked, and did not hold together well.

I made this with a sugar substitute(Nature's Sweet) and it was wonderful!  Many of my friends and family couldn't believe that it was sugar-free.

These cookies were really sticky and I needed A LOT OF flour to get them to roll out, and at the end, the flavor was lost, without the frosting the taste was only flour. I was disappointed because the recipe turned out very very bland. However, the kept their shape during baking.

These turned out great!  Sometimes cut-outs either look good, or taste good, but not both.  These both looked good and tasted great.

They don’t taste very cream cheese like. They’re just alright cookies. Nothing special like the name would suggest. Barely tasted the cream cheese. Disappointed.

Very amateur at this, but this dough is way sticky and even if you don't add any extra flour, it's bland and tastes like flour, with barely any hint of flavor.

These cookies were great!  I used salted butter as the recipe did not call for salt and added an 1/8 of a teaspoon to the mix.  I also used 1 full teaspoon of baking powder. I used 4 ounces ( not 3 oz.)  of  good cream cheese. Before chilling the dough seemed a bit sticky so I  damped my hands to form the two dough balls to go in the  plastic easily.  I chilled the dough in the freezer for 20-25 minutes as I was in a hurry which was worked just fine.  I kept the other half in the refrigerator until time to use.  The dough is great and clean to work/ bake with.  Just make sure to  have flour ready to sprinkle on your dough ball before rolling out and on your rolling bin.  Cookies were great with and with out  frosting.

This recipe is excellent! It’s crazy to not add salt so I added 1 tsp of pink salt (always use unsalted butter when baking) and vanilla and it was perfect. Everything else was exactly as written. The cookies stayed soft and flavorful for multiple days. I will definitely be making again!

We didn't frost the cookies because we use egg yolk paints on them.  Even so, the cookies were very flavorful and received compliments.  Dough is easy to work with.  Great recipe.

Hey Yaul,
Today I wanted to try out this cookie recipe mostly because it did not have a large list of products I would need inorder to make the recipe!!! These cookies turned out amazing and are not very hard to mess up. These are great to add icing on for those worried.
Hope to make recipes from her again.

Dough is very easy for work with, not sticky like my old recipe that I been struggling with for years!  I only make sugar cookies around Christmas and wanted to use up some cream cheese so this recipe was a good fit.  I made it the day before, rolled out the newly made dough between parchment paper and refrigerated it flat.  Was super easy to pull out of the refrigerator, cut with cookie cutters and get the first batch in the oven.  A keeper.

The first batch I made, I had followed the instructions with no substitutions. The dough is sticky, but workable by adding flour to your counter and rolling pin. After baking and tasting a plain cookie it didn't really have much taste. I added frosting and that is what sold the cookie. There were a few reviews out there that said this didn't have much taste- take it into consideration if you want a plain (no frosting, topping) cookie. The second batch I added 1tsp of vanilla extract and the taste was right on. The third batch I added 1/2 tsp almond extract, which was, again, very good. My family and coworkers loved this, though so into the recipe box it goes.

The stars are for the taste, but the dough was such a sticky mess! Even after 6 hours in the fridge and half a cup of powdered sugar, the dough stuck to everything. The cookies held their shape, though.

Cookie's taste good and easy to make.   Only problem is the dough is very sticky.   2 cups of flour is not enough.  I used a extra half cup.  This made it workable to roll out.

This is in the top five cookie recipes for me.  It is more of a cake like cookie, soft and delicious.  Definitely do have to use lots of flour when rolling out, as a previous commentator said.   It is my go to cookie for any holiday!  Love it!

I refrigerate the dough overnight instead of an hour. I even added fruit jam to the dough I made a round flat cookies shapes and indent in to the middle of dough and add the jam and add a little bit of sugar to the top then bake it. Yummy!! My son love it.

The dough was nice and fluffy. Easy to work with when chilled. These are not sweet cookies, and I would roll them out a little thicker.  Good way to use up cream cheese. I used  Sugar Cookie Icing, By: JBS Box, from this site.

I followed this recipe exactly as instructed but had a different experience with the cookies--the dough was very difficult for me to work with (I had it in the fridge overnight and STILL could not use cookie cutters) and the cooking time for me was closer to 15 minutes. I live in the midwest and have a new oven; maybe it needs to be re-calibrated. Still, the cookies were good. Not the best, although frosting them makes them taste wonderful. I also really enjoyed the texture of the finished product; the cookies were perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside which I LOVE in my sugar cookies!
