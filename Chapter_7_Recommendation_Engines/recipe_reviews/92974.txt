These were really good! Instead of using a boxed pancake mix from the store I used the homemade pancake mix recipe from this site. I followed the recipe as stated and did use frozen berries. I put flax in many different bread and muffin recipes I make from allrecipes, and now pancakes!

My husband and I loved these.  I used a multigrain pancake mix by Bob's Red Mill.  The batter was really thick, I added more liquid, plus it thickened even more while standing (flax will do that!).  It was more like biscuit or muffin batter.  But I used the recommended measure and spread it out in the pan.  I used a little lower heat to account for the thickness.  Although thick and clunky looking, they were moist and light to eat.  I cooked some frozen blueberries with spenda for a compote topping that was light in calories.  Fiber, Omega-3, Antioxidants...and flavor.  What more do you want for breakfast!

I followed another user's advice and used Bob's Red Mill multigrain pancake mix. However, instead of using milk I used lowfat buttermilk and subbed egg replacement for the eggs. This is even more exceptional with the addition of chopped pecans or walnuts and a blueberry compote (a couple handfuls of blueberries and enough sugar to lightly coat, simmered over medium heat until most of the berries burst and emit their juices).

By separating the eggs and adding the beaten egg whites at the end, I was able to make these as Belgian waffles. My husband loved them. I just found a new Sunday brunch, and a healthy one at that.

My kids looked at the pancakes and asked what was wrong with them.  But, I threw in a few chocolate chips and they were a hit--even w/ my picky one.  I used Bob's Red MIll 10 grain pancake mix and the same brand in flaxseed meal.  They tasted very good and are very good for you (as healthy as a pancake can be).  I will be making these in place of our usual pancake recipe.  Thanks!

I made a double batch of this. I used my own homemade whole wheat pancake mix, lowfat buttermilk, organic eggs and last summer's frozen blueberries. These came out fluffy and we just loved them! This recipe was just perfect for me to make a healthy, filling breakfast for my boys today and freeze a couple meals worth for busy mornings I won't have time to make a hot meal. NOTE: For those who are like me and want to freeze additional for later breakfasts, just stick them in ziplock bags and for easy warm up, stick them in the toaster!

These were good and definitely not what I was expecting for something that was packed with so much fibrous goodness!  The blueberries added flavor where I wasn’t expecting it, which was a pleasant surprise.  I mixed some extra frozen blueberries and Splenda for a topping which added even more blueberry-ness, which we both loved.  They were also very filling and easy to make.  Yum!

I made these pancakes this morning with apples (no blueberries) but I can confidently give these 5 star as I know these will taste as good with blueberries.  I love that they have flax in them...my kids gobbled these up!!

I used a egg substitute which made the batter a little watery so I added an extra tablespoon of pancake mix. I also dropped a couple blueberries on each pancake while on the griddle. They came out great! I boiled some extra blueberries with a little sugar and I served the pancakes drizzled with the blueberry "syrup". Excellent and good for you!

These were pretty good.  I used a "only add water" mix, so was nervous about adding the egg and milk.  Instead, I added the amount of liquid the milk and eggs would have made (about 1 1/2 cups).  They were a little flat, though, so I am going to try it with the milk and eggs next time.

Wow, these were amazing.  Light, flavorful.  Real maple syrup was an excellent topping.  I did use a cast iron pan vs. nonstick, which made them not so "pretty", but will do it again for the health benefit.

These were great!  I also used the Homemade Pancake Mix recipe from this website instead of boxed.  And I added chopped pecans, walnuts and cinnamon.  This was a pancake I didn't feel guilty about.

Visibly only a little different, tasted GREAT!  Prepared exactly except didn't have blueberries on hand.  Made 8 - 1/3 cup pancakes.  My 3 teenage boys didn't ask what was in it, they ate it with, "MMmmm!"  Have made with mini-chocolate chips, very good recipe!  Thanks for sharing Freckles!

I made a few alterations (used soy milk, peaches, and added brown sugar and cinnamon), but I still gave it 5 stars because this is a great base and I love the addition of flax meal!  Thanks for the recipe!

It's hard to imagine these could turn out nice and fluffy, but they do!  I made these several times, each time using a different type of pancake mix (homemade versions) and each time they have turned out perfect.  I like them best when topped with a little butter and syrup.

just ok for us but I used 100% whole wheat pancake mix and it felt too gritty by also adding the flax.  Next time I'll either cut down on the flax if I use whole wheat pancake mix again or do exactly what the recipe calls for.  We just didn't have any normal pancake mix on hand.  I also had to keep adding a bit of milk between each batch because the flax sucked up all the liquids so fast.  still a good recipe but it will be even better if I make a change to the way I prepared it.

My kids LOVED these!  My son usually hates the taste of flax, but he adores these pancakes.  I didn't have pancake mix, so I got a pancake recipe and used the flour, oil, etc. from that.  And I used whole wheat flour.  Thanks for giving me an awesome way to use my flax seeds!!

These were really good! I was a little worried, as they looked rather dense and not so good, but YUMMY!!!  mmm, VERY fluffy and even better than traditional pancakes.  I topped w/ sliced strawberries and syrup.  I followed the recipe exactly, but next time I will double the blueberries, as there wasn't enough.  Mine made 6 pancakes.

Made exactly as is. I was able to make 6 large and fluffy pancakes using 1/2 cup servings. Used Dolly Sods pancakes my family picked last month. If I was to make this again, I would half the recipe for just kidlets and make my own pancake mix.

Coincidentally, I was trying to use up a bag of pancake mix bought to take camping at the same time I spied this recipe. I normally always make pancakes from scratch, so was pleased to find this recipe. I never would have thought of it myself. You're still getting all the sugars and preservatives, but at least there is some goodness added. Not sure how to review the actual pancakes, because they're still a box mix in the end. Hard to review something like that. Hence the 3 stars. Thanks for the idea.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  The only thing I changed was substituting one shredded apple instead of the blueberries and adding about 2 oz. of walnuts.  I am nuts about nuts and I think everything tastes better with nuts. I just peel the apple and shred it right into the batter after all the ingredients are mixed together.  I whipped up a batch of the Blueberry Sauce (from Allrecipes) and it was ready in no time at all, and just a perfect accompaniment to these pancakes.  The apple makes them ever so moist to eat.

Make these all the time with farm-fresh blueberries.  Sometimes I even leave out the blueberries and the pancakes are just as good.  Great recipe for anyone (like me) who can't make fluffy pancakes to save their life.

Excellent recipe! I'd never cooked with flaxseed meal. My family loved the pancakes and my 9 yr. old went back for seconds. While they were cooking, she wasn't crazy about their appearance as they varied slightly from the norm but they passed the taste test with flying colors. Even my husband was saying we should add flaxseed meal to everything. Thanks Freckles, for submitting this healthy recipe that tastes good!

Hardy (and healthy) yet fluffy pancakes.  Definitely filling and satisfying.  Kids were okay with the taste but not crazy about it.

I made them with strawberries and had to add a little more milk, but everyone agreed, they were delicious. My kids, 5,3,&1, asked why they looked different but had seconds. I made some to freeze for future mornings as well.

Could it get any easier?! My family loves bisquik pancakes, and I like adding flax seed to everything. My family couldn't even tell these were loaded with fiber. This recipe is a keeper and will be making them again, and possibly trying other fruit.

I, too, used Bob's Red Mill 10 grain pancake mix, and followed the entire recipe exact, doubling it so that we'd have leftovers. The mix quickly got very thick, and was almost impossible to flatten out. I increased the milk a bit but still had a bit of a time with the consistency of the batter, but nevertheless, they turned out delicious. I may try whipping the egg whites and making waffles out of them next!

Cut recipe in half to serve 2. Used Krusteaz Buttermilk Pancake mix and water instead of milk. Didn't have berries or fruit, so added a couple of Tbsp. more of water. Perfect. Light and fluffy and healthier with flax. Will make again.

EDIT: Not all ground flax is created equal. I LOVE this recipe now that I've found a ground flax seed that doesn't turn to cement paste! I've tried apple cinnamon and banana since. It's my "treat" on the weekend and look forward to it! very yummy!

These were really good. I tripled the batch for our big family. I also added about 3/4 cup of sugar and chocolate chips. :) ( We don't do syrup so we make them sweeter.) Everyone said they tasted a little healthy, but the kids ate them up.
Thanks!

Excellent! Like others, I'm trying to get more flax in our diets. :) I did an eighth-size batch of the Homemade Pancake Mix by Wendy to make a half-batch of these pancakes. I then used 1/4 cup flax (I ground up some flax seeds that I purchased in bulk for like 57 cents a pound instead of a store-bought seed meal!), more like 3/4 cup milk, 1 egg, and around 3/4 cup sliced up and thawed frozen strawberries. Excellent! My four-year-old scarfed them down and wanted more! Thanks for sharing, Freckles!

These are terrific! I made them just like the recipe & they turned out great. I don't feel so guilty now eating pancakes! Another little tip to help eliminate the guilt factor too is to put the syrup on your plate & dip the pancakes into it vs pouring over. You'll use much less syrup that way ;-) Thanks for sharing your recipe!

These were really good and nutritious!  They were very thick.  I used Heart Smart Bisquick.  I replaced one egg with Egg Beaters (because I ran out of eggs) which made it even healthier.  Yummy!

These are good. I didn't have any blueberries, so made them w/o. Next time will have fresh on hand. Looking forward to it. They are filling, not like those things that are called pancakes. These will stay with you. Thanks alot!

These were definitely thick. We added at least another 1/2 cup of milk, it was necessary. I also used Bob's Red Mill whole grain pancake mix. They were filling and delicious, but would probably be a bit more tasty with a tbsp. or two of sugar added to the batter. Excellent with real maple syrup!

This is a wonderful healthy alternative for Sunday morning breakfast. My children ate them better than plain pancakes.  Just make sure the batter is not too thick, I added an extra tablespoon or two of water to thin it out a little.

This was awesome!  Didn't change a thing.  My son and I recently were diagnosed with hypoglycemia and a gluten intolerance and this is a delicious and healthy breakfast!  I make 2 batches and freeze a batch for the kids for the next week.  It's so sweet with the blueberries you don't need any syrup!

Very easy and very good.  I did stir the blueberries directly into the batter and they still turned out great!  The only thing I didn't like was the partially hydrogenated oil in the pancake mix (hubby bought it).  Hopefully I can find a good organic mix so it's ultra healthy!

AMAZING pancakes! These were so simple to whip up. I too used the make-your-own pancake mix found on this site. These are real stick-to-your-ribs pancakes and adding fresh blueberries makes them so sweet and almost creates its own syrup. Make these for breakfast today!

I used this recipe in conjunction with the "Homemade Pancake Mix" (also available on this site).  I, too, found the batter a bit thick, but that was easily remedied with a bit more milk.  I'm guessing it was b/c the mix had whole wheat flour and required more moisture.  I made these plain and with mixed frozen berries, and both were very yummy.  Oh, I also threw in  about 2 T of whole flax seeds for texture.  Very good, our new staple for pancake breakfasts.

Didn't have flax meal so I used seeds.  Not so good.  Let then stand for 10 minutes or so before starting to cook them and they come out fluffier.  Used maple pecan butter to top with; yum!

These were wonderful. I found the batter to be thin, but as the pancakes cooked, they really thickened nicely and were not dense. I would definatly make sure the skillet is hot enough before cooking because the first batch I made got a little burnt before the inside was done and my last batch was perfect. My kids loved these. I love the fact that my family was eating healthy and they didn't even know it.

We have tried a lot of pancake recipes and my husband said, please print this out and save it.  This is my favorite we have tried.  I added 2 mashed bananas when I added the wet ingredients because I wanted more fruits in it for my kiddos.  I love anything with flax, so I was excited to try this recipe!

These turned out great.  I might add a small amount of vanilla next time.

Best pancakes I've ever made, and filling, too! I topped them with "Blueberry Breakfast Sauce" from this site, and enjoyed every single bite. These are my go-to pancakes from now on.

This was my first go at a "healthy" pancake, but I'm pregnant and had to answer a craving!  I found this recipe a good compromise as they do contain flax for fiber and blueberries!  I used fresh blueberries and 2% milk as that's what we always have and these came out thick, but fluffy and VERY filling!  Quite yummy with a little bit of pure maple syrup drizzled on top. In fact, they are so filling I could only eat one! Storing the remainders to be re-heated within the next couple of days as snacks! Yum!

These were yummy and very filling pancakes. I used the "Homemade Pancake Mix" recipe and left out the blueberries. Easy to make and perfect for a Sunday breakfast :)

Nice...never put flax in anything until this recipe and it worked fine and dandy.  Wouldn't even notice it, but for the color.

Pretty good, could use a little more flavor in the pancake itself, like some sugar and lemon juice, but a solid breakfast recipe.

Very nice pancakes, just be sure to keep adding milk until you get the right consistency because the flax tends to readily suck up the liquid. A healthier version of pancakes that would work well with other berries; perfect for summertime. Thanks for sharing!

These are delicious and very healthy. I didn't have any blueberries, I'm sure that would have made them even better. They are much denser than regular pancakes so one large pancake is enough for one adult! This recipe makes three large pancakes for me.

These are really, really good! I didn't think that something with flax seeds would be light and fluffy, but they are! I use 1 cup of a frozen berry medley from Costco. I don't bother to thaw them and they still come out fine. I use a whole wheat pancake mix found on a blog called Kitchen Treaty. These pancakes have become a weekend tradition. Now the only thing I need is a healthy syrup...

This was a delicious pancake and an easy recipe to follow. It turned out well! I did however use other reviewers ideas, like making and adding a compote to it and I also Toasted some pecans to add a top of it as well.
