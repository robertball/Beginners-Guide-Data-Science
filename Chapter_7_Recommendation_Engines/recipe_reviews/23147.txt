Only because I make this all the time. As for the lack of creaminess many have complained about, while the macaroni is draining, simply had a half cup of whole milk to the pot, with a pat of butter, the grated cheese and allow to come to come to a simmer (no boil), then add the canned stewed tomatoes (you choose your personal favorite flavor) heat on medium then add the macaroni and let heat until heated through. No baking here. No cracker crumbs, no nothing else. It's a side dish at best. Once you start adding other ingredients, like onions, celery, etc., and baking it with cracker crumbs and additional grated cheese, it becomes a long drawn out process. This is designed as a one dish, "hey mom, I can make this in my dorm room" kind of dish. It can be made on a camping trip. STOP mucking it up with additions, another pot or pan, the requirement for an oven, etc. Gosh, way to "not keep it simple" many of you.

I was also raised on this type of mac & cheese.  My mother used extra sharp cheddar and "chunked" it instead of shredding.  She also added Italian Seasonings and garlic with Italian stewed tomatoes.  My children now LOVE this and have become quite adept at making it themselves.  We "fight" over the crispy top it makes.

Very good.  A bit dry though.  I used low fat cheddar and diced tomatoes with 1 tsp. Italian seasoning.  I think the flavor will be a bit more intense when using stewed tomatoes.  My husband liked it so I'll be making this again.

This macaroni & cheese recipe is quite good. I think its more of a mac & cheese "jumble" because the cheese & tomatoes never really mix and they don't coat the macaroni like a sauce, as they do in traditional macaroni & cheese.  Still, it's incredibly easy, very economical and truly tasty.  My only caveat: you may want to extend the cooking time, 1/2 hour might not be long enough, depending on your oven.

Quick and easy? Yes. Good? Not what we had in mind. Very flat taste and dry. Not creamy at all, and did not reheat for leftovers very well. Sorry, NOT impressed!

This is sooo yummy!  With real cheddar, stewed tomatoes and pasta, what's not to love?  It's not a very creamy mac and cheese, but it is very cheesy with a wonderful flavor.  I used bow tie pasta instead of elbow macaroni and I kept it covered in the oven to keep the moisture in.  It was such a quick and easy recipe - and it came out very well. :)

Oh man, did this bring back memories, just like mom used to make.  Have made it several times now, first time added a little basil, and the second time for a change, added a sprinkle of cayenne...yum yum...for both..Thank you.

As other reviewers mentioned, this is not a traditional, creamy mac 'n cheese.  Though you could probably make it that way by adding in some cream cheese, etc.  Anyway, after reading the other reviews, I added another 4 oz. of cheese (I used 2%, sharp cheddar), the italian style stewed toms, and also threw in a few dashes of garlic salt.  YUM!  Not gourmet, but cheap, yummy, quick and easy.  And definitely family friendly...my 6 year old and 18 mos. old both loved it.  

Only other tips I would add is make sure to keep and include the juice from the stewed toms (will help with moistness/flavor), and I covered it with foil for the 30 minutes then boosted the heat and took off the foil for an additional five.  Turned out wonderfully moist, and just a bit crispy in places on top.  

Thanks for the easy recipe...definitely a keeper for us!  And something fun for the kids to make on their own someday.

I was surprised that this turned out so good because I can never make something baked with mostly cheese without it being stringy and oily.  I did what another reader said: while the pasta drains, put some milk and butter into the pot with the cheese and let it melt (added dried basil) and then add the tomatoes (I used Italian diced) and then put everything together to bake.  My husband liked it and it turned out creamier than I expected.  Not stringy and oily.  Thanks for the simple recipe.

This isn't quite mac and cheese as anyone who read the ingredients should know...That said, it's a top of the line quick, cheap and oh so yummy dinner. Use the italian flavored tomatoes for sure and cover with foil until mostly done. I uncovered it and raised the temp a bit to get the "crunchies" on top. It's my 11 year old son's favorite comfort dinner.

I didn't love the recipe-but i'm not one to judge. Try adding more cheese to make the mac n cheese more moist.

I made half of this recipe using stewed tomatoes with basil, garlic and oregano (froze the other half of the can, which works great!).  My stewed tomatoes were really large chunks, so I chopped them up using my kitchen scissors.  To make it a little creamier I melted the cheese with 1/4 cup of milk and a pat of butter, as suggested by another reviewer, then folded in the tomatoes and macaroni, along with some salt and pepper.  I added a panko topping that I had moistened with melted butter and baked covered for 15 minutes and uncovered for 15 minutes.  My topping wasn’t quite as browned as we like, so I turned the broiler on to get a little better color and crisp up the top.  This was a new twist on macaroni and cheese for us.  We liked it and I would make it again, but I would increase the seasonings.  There just wasn’t enough in the tomatoes to season the whole dish, so I would add a  bit more next time.

Every time I make this recipe, my husband raves about it!  He and the girls, 1 and 3, love it.  It's great with cooked chicken inside and a cracker topping.  (I use one sleeve of round buttery crackers mixed with melted butter sprinkled on top before baking.)

Made this for supper tonight and it was fantastic!  Made a couple of slight changes...I added a cup or so of cubed ham that I had in the fridge and drained the stewed tomatoes as I  thought it might end up being too watery otherwise.  Used a combo of shredded cheddar/mozza and added a bit of cheese on the top; baked with the lid on and finished the last few minutes with it off for browning.  I will make this again and again!  My husband went back for a heaping helping of seconds!!  Great easy and tasty recipe. :-)

This is delicious. After reading other reviews  I added velveeta cheese and milk to make it creamier. It is the bomb. I always used to make stewed tomatoes as a side dish so why not put them right in it!

Easy! Easy! and DELICIOUS! I made a nice meal out of it and it was tremendously filling. Since I LOVE me some spice...I started out by sautéing 1 large yellow onion and 4 large cloves of garlic, with butter. I then added a healthy teaspoon of cayenne pepper and pepper flakes along with 2 cups of cubed ham. I probably could have added 2 cups of broccoli florets, but I chose to go with fresh basil instead. Before I placed it into the oven, I added some nice croutons. EXCELLENT! Hey...when my mom asks me for a recipe, that says a lot!

Thank you.  I've looked all over for a healthier macaroni and cheese recipe and this is the only one I could find.  Very tasty and not as full of fat as most recipes for this dish are.

This recipe was delicious.  I may try to cover it next time, as the top had dried but the bottom was still not totally melted.  Very good though.  The seasoned tomatoes are a must; it would have been too bland otherwise.  THANKS.

My 5 year old and I like this just as is! The can of diced tomatoes added enough liquid that it wasn't at all dry! And make Mom feel better for having something healthy added in. Thanks.

This is just like my mom makes it, except she bakes slices on top of the macaroni to give it extra flavor :) instead of the stewed tomatoes, I use diced, they disburse more evenly through the mac and cheese. Also try adding some milk, flour and maybe an egg if you don't like the consistency.

This turned out really well.  I like the firmer texture than most macaroni and cheese.  I added some milk to it to make it creamier and some bread crumbs for a crust.

I have made this recipe several times now and love it every time.  I prefer it over the creamier kind(personal preference).  Sometimes I add  2 packages of sharp cheddar cheese for a little more texture and taste.

Very quick, easy, and relatively healthy. I threw a jalapeño in it and it gave it some extra flavor and kick.  Definitely making it again.

Are stewed tomatoes only found in certain areas? Because I am amazed at how many people said they used diced tomatoes and then said it was bland. Of course it is bland if you use diced instead of stewed tomatoes! Stewed tomatoes are full of onions, green peppers and seasonings. Read the recipe people! And try using the correct ingredients if you plan on reviewing it!!! This dish is delish and simple.

Delicious although a bit salty & I did not add any additional salt to the recipe.  Next time I may try lower sodium cheddar.  Also, maybe mix in some sausage.  Definitely good comfort food:)

I love the combination of sharp cheddar and Italian-style stewed tomatoes. Quick & easy, I have even made it on a camping trip! We like it a little creamier than this recipe provides, so I usually stir in a can of cheddar cheese soup as well to make it creamy while still super easy.

This is a very easy dish and could be made by young kids.  There is no need to double the cheese like some people have done.  It's already very cheesy.  Make sure to let it cool off before you eat it or the cheese will stick to your teeth.  I doubled the recipe and added two cloves crushed garlic, a tsp dried basil, a 1/2 tsp crushed red chili, 1/2 tsp cracked black pepper. It was moist and flavorful.  I will add a bread crumb topping next time. This dish is similar to one I used to make in a skillet with peppers and onions.  I learned it from my Grandmother. She used bacon but I am vegetarian so I use and olive oil.  Be sure to try brown rice pasta.  It won't raise your blood sugar.

It was delicious, however I changed up the recipe. I had canned diced tomatoes with garlic, use 1/2 box of medium shells (cooking for 2), used one 2 cup bag of sharp cheddar and 3/4 of a 2 c bag of Monterey Jack cheeses, and whisked one egg with about 1/4 to 1/3 cup of milk with pepper, garlic powder, poured this over everything, added butter pats over the top. After 30 minutes I mixed it up (it was moist) then put it on broil for five minutes. Will definitely make this again!

This was really easy.  I agree with catgoverness.  I took this advice and went with the butter, milk thing on the stove.  All agreed in my family that they like this side dish and instructed me to make it again.  I served it with beef sammies. You can basically do anything you'd like to this recipe per your taste.  Recipes are guidelines to creativity.  Thank you Debby for sharing.

loved this - I usually do the flour, milk & cheese but I'd run out of flour and already had the macaroni cooking - so I was really glad to find this recipe......I added a couple of big spoonfuls of mild salsa as I also didn't have any stewed tomatoes - no, it wasn't creamy but just what I was looking for....my husband loved it and so did I and it was the first time I've served mac & cheese and he hasn't doused it in ketchup and we both had seconds so no leftovers! :(

It's good, but it is a little basic. I added salt, but it still needs more spices. It might be good with some pepperoni, or chicken.

Love it, the Mac and cheese my family makes. Great for people who don’t necessarily like creamy Mac n cheese, because I don’t. I always make sure it to load it up with chilli flakes and salt and pepper.

Kids through adults like this! As some other reviewers mentioned I added butter and milk to the pot before adding the noodles. Super easy, very good. Used tin foil in the oven for 20 minutes. Last 10 minutes no foil. Perfection. -- does not taste like traditional Mac and cheese, obviously.

Followed directions exactly. Have to agree with others who call this recipe somewhat bland but I liked it well enough to make it once.  Not sure I'll ever repeat it.  Very easy to make though and ingredients are inexpensive so good side dish if you really like macaroni.

A nice alternative to Mac and Cheese that’s too heavy. The tomatoes really added a nice taste. May toss in a few black olives next time. Will definitely make it again.

I really like this recipe!  If you don't mind a less creamy texture in your macaroni but a powerful cheddar flavor combined with "home canned smoked on the grill tomatoes" you will enjoy it.  It is so easy to make with only three ingredients...I cannot eat gluten so the gluten free pasta worked great with this recipe.

This is very good.  The easiest mac and cheese recipe I've ever made.  My husband nodded his head, said, "Pretty good! Pretty good!" And went back for seconds.  Lol.  So on that response, this recipe is added to my favorites.

A real go-to mac and cheese. Craved mac and cheese with tomato and did not want to take time and bother for some of my other favourites and this looked so easy. Used cheeses I had on hand - cream cheese with herb and garlic, medium cheddar and gruyere. I did follow suggestion of some others and just heated about 1/2 cup of milk and added cheeses to make creamy. Used stewed tomatoes with Italian seasonings and sprinkled a bit of Panko breadcrumbs on top for crunch. I used about half of the juice from tomatoes because I had added milk and it was beautifully creamy but not sloppy - put the rest of the juice in the leftover so it did not dry out.  It was perfect - satisfied the craving. Very adaptable to whatever you have on hand.

I wanted a healthy choice to making Mac and cheese since my hubby loves this so much. Was hesitating about the tomatoes because he's quite a stickler.

Lovely!  I added the milk and butter for added creaminess and it was so good.  I made it in the pan without baking and I was pleased with the results.

This recipe was awesome.  I doctored it up by using tomatoes with green chilies, added smoked paprika, and used sharp and Mexican cheese.

Wow Maureen Frusha Boutwell... Who died and made you queen cook. I guess it's okay for you to say what it should and shouldn't have and how to cook something, but no one else can. You must be The ultimate chef. Here's a little advice that might help your bitter existence, make the recipes as written then simply rate it. The number of stars mean absolutely nothing when you and everyone else changes it up then rates it. Talk about egos!

I made this today and thought it was good considering how little effort is required to make it. I used the basic recipe this time and only added a little salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning.  Next time I'll probably read through the reviews and add something more to give it some extra flavor.The original recipe had good flavor with the stewed tomatoes and is fine on its own too. I didn't get a crunchy top though.

This is the base recipe to what my grandma used to make for me since I was a little girl. She has since passed and I couldn't remember what kind of tomatoes to use. However she added a few spices and MUCH MORE CHEESE lol. There was NEVER a complaint about it being dry. As for the comment that said "don't muck it up with additives" or whatever. Not everyone likes dry or plain tasting food! If you're going to put the effort into what you make then make it how you like it. It won't kill you to take an extra 10 mins preparing it for a better taste. Otherwise get a box of KD and enjoy!

EDIT - JUST made this for supper and I cannot explain how happy I am to have found this for as reasons stated above. I doubled the recipe but also added 3lbs of ground beef (to make it a whole meal). I also didn't have a second can of the stewed tomatoes so I used a can of diced. Just as fabulous as what grandma used to make!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! With doubling and addition of meat I used a big turkey roaster pan (the disposable ones) and it filled it around 2/3 full!

I made this on the stove tonight. I added a half cup of milk and some butter to make it creamy. My husband hated it, but he thinks Kraft mac n' cheese is the greatest thing to ever touch his tastebuds, so I am not suprised really. I thought it was good. Simple cheesiness cannot really be bad, can it?

I made this for my family, and it was really disappointing. I added half a cup of milk, and did it on the stove top as suggested by another user. It was bland and did not have a good taste. I even used stewed tomatoes with Italian seasonings as well. If you like bland then this is perfect. Won't be making this again.

I was looking to recreate a recipe for tomato Mac and cheese my mother-in-law used to make for my husband and came across this one. She always used 1/2 a jar of her home-made chili sauce in hers along with the ingredients listed here, so I added it to this recipe along with dried minced onion (1 tbsp). It was just like hers after these additions. If you make chili sauce, give this revision a try and see for yourself! Yum yum...good!

I wanted to keep this quick and easy, but I like creamy. While the macaroni cooked, I heated the tomatoes with  a can of cheddar cheese soup, 1/2 stick of butter and a 1/2 cup of milk in the microwave.  Then added 1 bag of extra sharp cheese and a bag of Italian cheese blend. Mixed in the cooked macaroni and baked it.  
This was off the charts!!

Has to be in my top 3 Mac & Cheese recipes.  I get requests for it every holiday!  Adding some butter and milk really makes this a delicious dish.  Thanks to catgoverness for the recommendation.

Very basic and tasty recipe - up the flavour by adding a few of your favorite herbs and a bit of garlic - I use 1 tsp each of basil, oregano, and minced garlic as well as a couple of good shakes of your favourite pepper and a smidgen of salt.   Great basic - cheap and always a good comfort food.

It was the easiest mac cheese to make, and very tasty using tomatoes. I was in a hurry to prepare, so I used everything from the can and whatever I had in the fridge. I used tomatoes garlic pasta sauce to add taste, mixed in some pork and smoked sausages. Emptied a packet of shredded pizza cheese easily found in the supermarket, and covered the top with a slice of sandwich cheddar cheese. It tired out to be a very quick meal to prepare and I portioned it into tiny bowls making it small individual servings that the kid didn't find too hard to finish.

I don't think I have ever prepared a meal in less time! Excellent, I added some bread crumbs and extra cheese on the top.
