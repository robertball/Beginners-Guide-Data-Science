I took ideas from a few of the previous reviews to make this cabbage and it was delicious!  I used bacon pieces instead of strips, apple cider vinegar and Splenda instead of sugar (Splenda is somewhat sweeter than suger so be careful).  I also threw in a vegetable bouillon cube and used less salt; instead of pouring salt on all layer, I salted 2 of 4 layers.  I don't think you need as much flour as the recipe calls for; next time, I'll use half.  Also, I could have thrown in another head of cabbage after the first head boiled down to even out the juice.  Even though there are some things that I would do differently next time, this was still the best cabbage I've made and I've made a lot of cabbage!  You can not go wrong with following the recipe verbatim.

I have searched for this recipe for years, finding similar but not exactly the flavor or sauce consistency, until now!  Excellent as given or without the bacon which is how I made it today to serve with ham. At long last, the right combination, delicious!

This is a great cabbage recipe.  Since my husband and I are on Weight Watchers, I leave out the bacon and use Splenda instead of the sugar.  That cuts the calories, therefore the "Points" and it's still delicious.  I like it with a ham slice and some microwaved sweet potatoes for a tasty but simple dinner.

Always looking for good recipes for cabbage.  Only change, cut up the bacon into bite size pieces. Love the combination of ingredients and easy to make.

I don't want it to be quite so much like sauerkraut, so rather then shredding the cabbage, I cut it up into larger pieces (bite size or larger).

This tastes alot like a cabbage dish my Hungarian grandparents make, however theirs has a orangey-red colouring. Perhaps they add paprika to it? I did make one mistake by using salt instead of the caraway seeds in the layering process. I did mix in a bunch of caraway seeds when I realized my error, and luckily the dish didn't turn out salty. I omitted the bacon just because I felt it wouldn't add all that much to the dish other than fat. The amount of sugar and vinegar in the recipe was just right to achieve the sweet-sour ratio. Another great way to make cabbage!

Before she died, I tried to get my Norwegian grandma to give me her cabbage recipe, but it was just "a little of this, a little of that" and I never felt confident enough to try.  I've made this dish twice now, and it is delicious--tastes just like my grandma's.  Thank you so much for sharing--it means a lot to me to have this connection to my roots.

This was so good with our ham.  I used less sugar but otherwise followed the directions as written and it was perfect!

I enjoyed this cabbage very much.  The sugar-vinegar mixture is a bit tricky to get just right, but once you do,it is delicious!

Great! My variation was Apple Cider Vinegar and Chinese Cabbage. I prefer the texture of Chinese cabbage.

This was really good. It didn't taste like saurkraut It was much milder. I cut up the bacon into little pieces instead of using long strips. Next time I will cook the bacon slightly first because the cabbage finished cooking before the bacon did. If I had used an older cabbage it might have been able to cook longer without going mushy, but if you cook the cabbage long enough to get the bacon done then the cabbage might be a bit mushy like mine was. Still, it tasted so good it was five stars. I took the advice and added the vinegar and suggar a little at a time till it tasted good to me and ended up using all the vinegar and a couple tablespoons less sugar but even with all the sugar I think it would have still been just fine. Everyone liked it. I made it as a side dish along side a whole Scandinavian menu, but if you used sausages in it or big Canadian bacon slices it could even be a main dish. Thank you for sharing it!

I loved this!  If you like sauerkraut and Corned Beef & Cabbage type dishes you'll like this, too.  I didn't have bacon so used smoked ham instead with fabulous results.  I also added onion which was probably unnecessary but I'd do it again.  Great recipe, thank you!

I had a lot of leftover honey-baked ham, so I cut it up and layered it in the mix. I also substituted celery seed for the caraway seed. This was so delicious that as soon as it was gone, my husband asked me to make another batch! I wish I could have given it 20 stars!

I cooked the bacon before as I was not sure you were suppose to do that...easy to make and tasted really good. I served this as a side to my Christmas dinner. i dont recommend this for that type of meal. This would be better as a side or condiment to hotdogs or brats (kind of had the sweet saurkraut taste and texture)..I will be making this again. THanks for the recipe

Very easy recipe, and came out quite tasty. I might try it without the bacon next time to make it healthier, and I'm pretty sure it would still be good.

It was ok until I started doing the vinegar and sugar.  I started with a little of each at a time and it just got worse and worse.  I guess this just is not a flavor I like.  I would recommend cooking the bacon first to render some of the fat and then add the cabbage because the bacon had chunks of fat remaining after cooking.

Good flavor. I put a lid on it and checked it after 20 min. The cabbage was a little mushy. Next time I won't put a lid on the pan and see if it's better. I don't want mushy cabbage, so not sure if 45 min of cooking it would make it mushy.

I just made this last night for my Bunco group, and we loved it!!  I used the packaged cole slaw, angel hair style, almost 2 bags.  I also cut up the bacon into bite size pieces. But everthing else, by the recipe.  Great reviews from us all!!!

NO Christmas without this one here up north!! Not in this house at least :) 

We boil it for several hours though, 3-4 I think.
