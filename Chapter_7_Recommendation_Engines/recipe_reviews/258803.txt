An easy 5 stars. I followed Chef John's recipe exactly and it turned out extremely well-balanced, which I was a little worried about given the amount of walnuts (I didn't want it to be super walnut-forward). I've uploaded a picture of how I served mine, with chicken pita pockets and bell peppers. I garnished with some parsley and an extra tiny drizzle of olive oil just to give it a light sheen, since it comes out of the fridge fairly matte in appearance. It was great as a dip with the fresh sliced orange bell peppers (I used red peppers in the recipe) and as a binding agent for my pita pocket ingredients (pan seared chicken, saut√©ed onions and peppers).

P.S. I can't stress enough the importance of the fridge chill here. I tried my muhammara fresh out of the food processor to taste it, and it was pretty good. But after it chilled completely in the fridge, all the flavors just seemed to fortify and really shine and it became great.

A great recipe.  Thanks for sharing.  Looking for a dip without cream cheese and Muhammara came up. Sometimes you can tell if a recipe is wonderful even if you don't have all the ingredients or wish to make it as your own. This is one of those.  My shortcut is: 
 I roasted 1 red and 1 yellow pepper and 1 onion cut in 2" pieces with a small amount of olive oil until soft in a hot oven for about 30 minutes on a nonstick lined pan.  In a food processor, walnuts and set aside, then garlic, then peppers and onions.  Seasoned to taste with all suggested ingredients (it tasted sweet so I didn't add molasses).  Next time, I will make it without the bread crumbs and additional olive oil for saving calories.

I've tried several Muhammara recipes and this is definitely the best. I cut the red pepper and cayenne in half and still had a nice amount of zip.  I used jarred red peppers but next time will roast my own.

Made it to bring to New Year's party for vegan friends.  Spectacular! Vegan/ non vegan....this is a great dip. Better than the sum of it's parts. Surprise! It is now on permanent rotation. I roasted peppers on grill with a handful of apple wood chips for good measure. Easy prep for folks that cook regularly. Try it once...you'll be hooked. Addictive. Thanks CJ.

I cannot find where I put the pomegranate so we may have to eat it  without. However, what a flavor--the toasted walnuts and the roasted bell pepper create a unique taste.  its in the fridge waiting for me to finish the gyros and tzatziki  (sp).  I made naan.  will try the mountain bread when I am not so hungry. I love you recipes and videos--told my daughter in NY about you. Thank you so much--one happy Texan

This spread has layers of flavor--the roasted peppers and toasted walnuts are suffused with garlic, spices, and more. Absolutely delicious--like nothing I've ever had before.

HUGE Chef John fan. All of his recipes are awesome, and this one is no exception! Husband and I found it absolutely delicious, and this is the kind of recipe where you can substitute items and still end up with a delicious dip.

I love Middle Eastern food.  I like all the ingredients, but this just had no taste.  I followed the directions to a T.  All of my spices were fresh.  I even bought really good naan at my local  Indian grocery store.  But this still looked like and tasted like red library paste with a little cayenne added.  (Or what I imagine library paste would taste like.)  I guess this is what Muhammara is supposed to taste like.  It's just not my thing.

Absolutely tasty. I'm pretty sure you can replace pomegranate molasses with honey or similar if needed!
