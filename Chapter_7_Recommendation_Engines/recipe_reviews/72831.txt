I am the recipe author so am not rating the recipe.  Just wanted to note that fresh spinach is a perfectly acceptable substitute for the arugula, and I use it frequently.  My original recipe submission said spinach or arugula, but for some reason it didn't show up when the recipe was published.  Other cheeses can be interchanged successfully as well.

I made this with what I had on hand, so I altered the recipe considerably.  I wanted to rate this anyway to encourage people to try it.  We loved it and next time we will definitely try the original version!

When I made it I substited 5oz. frozen spinach for the arugula, ricotta for the feta and gruyere for the parmesan.  I also added about a teaspoon of dried basil.

Although the flavor was great and this recipe was delicious, it was essentially a tomato filled with bean dip. Next time I'll probably throw i some diced tomatoes, couscous, sauted onions (etc..) into the filling. I think this would improve the texture.. But try it!

Love chick peas and love arugula so this was a perfect lunch for me. I added fresh garlic to the mix and some onion powder. I try so hard to get the right amount of fiber into myself everyday and this really helped and was delicious to boot! Thanks so much Kathy!!

One of the best recipes I tried this season. Naturally, I altered it a bit, using frozen spinach instead of arugula, probably about half again what was called for, and mixed some ricotta in as well as the feta and parmesan. So excellent. I will definately be making this again. Even the tomato haters liked it. It looks really impressive too.

These were pretty good.  They did get a little watery and if I make them again I will put them on convection roast in my oven to bake them.  MIL who is a vegetarian raved about them.

The stuffing was good - although I doubled the amount of feta, used fresh spinach, and used a combination of shredded and grated parmesan cheese.  Cooked for slightly more than 20 minutes.  However, when I took the dish out of the oven there was water in the bottom and the tomatoes were soggy.  Hubby wasn't a big fan.

This is good but lacks something, I added a pinch of Cayenne pepper for some zip and it helped. The reviews said that their tomatoes were watery, When I removed the pulp I took a paper towel and blotted the inside of the tomato. I then added approx (1) Tablespoon of fresh dried bread crumb to the bottom and I also mix the bread crumbs into the hummus mixture. These came out perfectly baked.

I subbed Basil for the Arugula but thought it was great recipe. My husband planted Yellow Stuffer heirloom tomatoes and they were perfect for this recipe.

This recipe was great! These are perfect for a light dinner, and really they don't take that long to prepare. The only changes I made was omitting the arugula (I didn't have any) and using a mixture of mozzerella and parm cheeses.  Thanks Kathy!

I love every ingredient in this recipe, but I thought the proportions were out of whack. I eat a lot of "green"-tasting foods, but this tasted too green even for me--yet the overall flavor was bland. I think it needs less arugula and beans, and more feta and Parm for some saltiness. A lot of reviewers mentioned that their tomatoes were too watery--I used beefsteaks and they came out very firm.

I really liked this recipe.  It was a great way to use up some of the tomatoes from our garden.  I also made the stuffed pepper recipe with this one and it was a nice combination.  A great vegetarian meal!

Healthy and Excellent. I couldn't find arugula so I substituted fresh basil- tastes like pizza without the crust!

Delicious!  Fun colors too!  I did add salt and pepper and I wish there was another recipe suggested to use the insides of the tomatoes.

Thanks!

I made this recipe as-is.  The flavor of the stuffed tomatoes was nice, but the texture wasn't right.  After 20 minutes in the oven, the arugula filling was warmed, but not really cooked and the tomatoes got very watery.  If I were to make this again, I'd cut the tomatoes in half before stuffing them and then bake them longer.

This was really easy and tasty.  I changed it up a bit by first blanching the arugula and squeezing the excess liquid out of it before throwing it in the processor and I omitted the feta and added a few extra tablespoons of parmesan.

Not very good. I blended it up with the spinach. The recipe didn't say if you needed to drain the beans or not so I didn't, and maybe that's why they didn't turn out so good? Just bland not appetizing. Sorry.

Super good and super fast! I added shredded cooked chicken and oregano. Instead of the blender, I used a potato masher on the garbanzo beans and mixed everything else in by hand (more texture & less dishes). Serving it with whole wheat toast on the side made it the perfect summer lunch - my kids even liked it!

A great base idea to modify to your liking.  I added spinach, onions, lots of garlic. I baked THEN topped with feta cheese, oregano and spices.  I also stuffed some bell peppers and can see it being a good dip for raw vegetables or bread.

Maybe I did something wrong but this not good.  I couldn't eat it.  It was very dry.  I drained the garbonzo beans, and used a mix of fresh spinach and basil in place of the argula.  Was not nearly creamy enough. Also, tomatoes aren't in season so even that part wasn't good.  Bummer :(
