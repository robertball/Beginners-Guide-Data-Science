A very nice dessert with a light flaky crust.  I added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon to the sugar mixture.  I also sprinkled the finished product with cinnamon sugar as well as the turned up edge. I love the plum/nectarine combination.  I found it very easy to cut with a pizza cutter and served it topped with Cool Whip.

Beautiful presentation and a thoroughly enjoyable dessert.  I added a handful of fresh blackberries and replaced the plums with two more large nectarines for a total of four.  After shaping the upturned edge of the crust, I moistened the dough with a light brush of water and sprinkled the edge with India Tree Sugar Crystals - turbinado sugar would have worked just as well.  The final product was quite tasty and downright pretty!

Since modified the recipe almost to the point when it becomes a new recipe, I don't know what to do about the star rating. However, I do enjoy the finished product, and so I will give it 5 stars. These are the changes that I made: - used puff pastry as the basis of the tart - its delicate flaky texture complemented the plums perfectly!; - used only plums (3 per tart); - did not use apricot jam; - used a little less than a teaspoon of ginger. In the end, you have light and refreshing (thanks to ginger) dessert that is perfect for tea with friends or as a dessert after a full dinner.

Liked this very much.  Unable to tell that cream cheese was used and that made it even better lower calories!

This is very tasty. The crust is tender and the filling was just right - I used only four purple plums. I did use tapioca instead of cornstarch and dusted with confectionery sugar after it cooled.
