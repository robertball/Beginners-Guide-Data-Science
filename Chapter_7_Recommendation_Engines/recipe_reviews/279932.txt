I made the recipe exactly how it was written! Great flavor and my boys ate it all up! The ingredients were all something I keep in my house so didnâ€™t have to buy extra for. Definitely will make again!

A really great recipe. Came out delicious and perfectly balanced as written. The cornbread is a great offset to the chili. I would call it mild to medium spiciness.

Super good! Made it with ground turkey but everything else in recipe followed exactly! Corn bread adds a very cool addition to the chili. It is definitely a keeper! Looks great when it comes out of the oven....real conversation piece!

Delicious. The spices were a bit "different", but good. Easy to make.

I didn't make any changes but next time I will reduce the sweetener in the cornbread topping.
