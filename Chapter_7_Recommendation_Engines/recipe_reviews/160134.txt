THIS RECIPE WAS VERY "SIMPLE". I USED FROZEN SHREDDED POTATOES AND THAWED THEM OUT INSTEAD OF THE SIMPLY POTATOES. IT WAS CHEAPER TO DO IT THIS WAY. I MADE IT FOR 10 SERVINGS AND THERE WAS PLENTY! I DIDN'T HAVE SEASONED CROUTONS SO I USED UNSEASONED AND ADDED SEASONING TO THE BUTTER WHEN I MELTED IT (GARLIC SALT, PEPER & PARSLEY). WILL DEFINITELY MAKE THIS AGAIN.

Super easy... I made these for Easter last year & everyone loved them.  I prepped them the night before, let them sit at room temperature the next morning for an hour, and then baked them.

I like that it makes less than my old recipe,and I love the corn flake crumbs on top.  I didn't change a thing with this recipe except next time I will cook it a little longer before I put the cornflake mixture on it.  I know it seems crazy because the cooking times are so long as it is but I had some areas where the potatoes were not quite done.  Maybe 55 minutes covered and then 25 minutes uncovered.

I used a 32 oz package of frozen cubed potatoes and  16 oz sour cream. Substituted croutons for Ritz crackers without butter on top and all other ingredients remained the same. It was a hit!! I will make again!!
