I made this sauce and let it sit for 24 hrs. Then I submerged a pork tenderloin in it for another 24 hrs in the refrigerator.I baked the pork with a small amount of sauce poured over it for 3 hrs at 325 degrees, covered, basting once an hr. Then I shredded the meat with 2 forks and poured the rest of the sauce over it, turned off the oven and when it was time to eat (about 1 1/2 hrs later)popped it on buns and ate heartily.  Loved it! Nice & spicy!

Thanks for the "real" Carolina BBQ sauce recipe.  A friend makes this all the time, but says the recipe is an old family secret.

Wow!  This was perfect!  About 3 years ago, I had been to a family reunion in NC where there was a pig roast, and they served the pork with a delicious spicy vinegar dressing that I'd never tried before.  Since then, I've had a craving for this sauce.  I scaled the sauce by half and made last night. Today, I put a half picnic in my slow cooker all day while I was at work.  I added about 1/4 cup of the sauce over the pork while cooking.  After draining and shredding the pork, I mixed about 3/4 of the remainder of the sauce with the shredded pork.  I served with some homemade cole slaw, homemade corn bread and baked beans and it was just great!  Thanks so much.  My search for a great Carolina BBQ recipe is over.  Thanks so much!!

My family is from Eastern North Carolina
(Smithfield N.C.), and this recipe is right on time. Sometimes we leave out the brown sugar, and use beer for a different kick. This mop sauce is used for roasting the pig, for chopped BBQ. I use it when grilling chops, ribs or a pork shoulder which I grilled a couple a days ago. Very good, give it a try. (TIP!!!! if you really want that eastern North Carolina taste add a little hickory or oak wood to your coals.

Definately had the NC vinegar flavor.  The spicyness got in the way a little bit.  I would suggest cutting back if you don't like your sauce super hot.

I lived in NC for years & love the BBQ there. This sauce is as close as I have come to the taste of "Carolina BBQ". Love it.

Wow! Just like the barbeque we'd get when we'd visit my nana and grandaddy in Wilmington... I was afraid it would be too spicey, but no, it was perfect.  Thank you so much!!!

Used this sauce on pork BBQ and it was great!  Very spicy and tangy, but I like it like that and so did 20 guys!  Next time I might add a bit more brown sugar and go a little lighter on the vinegar.

My husband LOVED this.  We lived in Eastern NC for 5 years.  Since we've left, this is definitely the closest we've ever been to getting the "real thing".  Thanks.

I'm an Eastern North Carolina native and I have to say that this recipe is quite authentic. I typically pick up the locally made spice pouch from the Piggly Wiggly in town. But since I never get down that way (from my home in Raleigh), I had to put this one together in anticipation of a Pig Pickin' that I'm having in a month (these sauces are always better when you let them marinate over time). 

For those giving this recipe a 1 star based on it being "too vinegary" check the ingredients. This thing is 99% vinegar. What do you expect?

All-in-all, the recipe is authentic to what I've grown to expect out of an Eastern North Carolina barbeque sauce.

This recipe is the TRUTH! I was born/raise in Goldsboro, NC - so I grew up on Wilbur's Barbeque.  I used this sauce on grilled turkey meat (I don't eat pork anymore) and it tasted better than it does back at home.  I chopped some turkey and made some coleslaw and piled it on a Kaiser bun. Thanks for sharing with us!

All I can say is oh my goodness!  This is so good!  I grew up in southeastern NC, and I grew up on this type of BBQ.  It's just like I remember at family dinners growing up.  My husband who is from Iowa said this BBQ recipe was better than some of the restaurants in NC who serve this.  I accidently put a little more hot sauce than called for, so I ended up putting a tad bit more brown sugar in it to even out the taste.  I wanted to make sure my son could eat it also.  I slow cooked a pork tenderloin in the oven for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, shredded the meat with two forks, and then poured the sauce over it.  I drained all of the excess sauce back into a cup just in case my husband wanted a little extra, but we ended up not needing it.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe!  Now when I move to Iowa in 6 months, I can bring a piece of home with me!  :)

I loved this sauce.  I made it for my daughter's graduation party( in Texas),  most guests chose a Texas style bbq sauce,  but for me when eating pulled pork it has to be Carolina style sauce.

I adore Southern BBQ.  I am in the Midwest and everyone makes it with bbq sauce which is not real bbq to me.  When I want the 'real thing', I either make this or have my sister ship me some from NC.  Thanks for sharing.

This was way too strong for us, and we live in Wilmington and my husband is from eastern NC.  If I were to make again, I'd cut back on the vinegar or add more brown sugar, and cut back on the hot sauce as well.

My husband and I had a pretty big pig-pickin and used this sauce. My husband's from Goldsboro, NC, and he was so happy when this sauce was used. Even the guests who we considered "yankees" loved it! Thanks for giving my hubby a taste of home!

Just served this to 300 of my closest friends.  They could not get enough.  Was great with pork shoulder and loin.  Totally reminds me of the best bbq joints in Eastern Carolina (North and occasionally South). Easy sauce to make; guaranteed crowd pleaser!

Exceptional !   This recipe gets rave reviews every time we do pulled pork BBQ!  Friends who grew up in NC love it ..... and for those who're monitoring certain ingredients for diets - -  it's gluten free,  and I substitute Splenda Brown Sugar for those watching sugar intake.  A real winner !

I'm from New Bern , North Carolina and you simply must cook your pork in this sauce for your pulled pork to taste like what I grew up with.  Put your pork and sauce in a slow cooker and let it cook eight hours for a six portion cut of meat, use one to one and a half cups sauce in the cooker with the pork. It will come out juicy and perfect for pulled pork sandwiches , New Bern style of course.

I love this sauce.  It is so spicy and tangy that you will exclaim,"WOW!!!" from the kick when you first try it whether you like it or not.  As is, the heat is on the scale of the "hot" salsa you buy at the store - maybe a little warmer, so cut back on the cayenne if heat is an issue.  The simplicity of this recipe allows you to get really creative with it so have fun and tweak it to your tastes.  Authenticity is great; but in the end, it's about a great sauce that you and your guests love!

This was excellent.  Served it with Sarge's EZ Pulled Pork from this site.   Great flavor!  I did scale back the recipe considerably because I was only making it for my family of 4.  I also cut back on the cayenne and red pepper so my kids would eat it.

I toned down the cayenne, red pepper and hot sauce, since we don't care for it that spicy. Still was a bit on the vinegary side. Might try it with white vinegar next time.

It is hard for me to rate this recipe.  I found the taste by itself too vinegary.  However, I did use it as a baste for my pulled pork and my beef brisket.  I later added some of it to my barbecue sauce that I used for the pulled pork and it worked really well.  But if I had to use this as a sauce by itself, NO.  So as a basting sauce I give it a 4 star, to blend in with your favorite sauce for pulled pork, after you'ved pulled/chopped the pork I give it 4 stars, as a barbecue sauce by itself, I give it 0 stars.  And because I will use it again for the above, I'm giving it a 4 star rating.

Too vinegary for me. Not what I expected and family didn't care for it either.

Absolutely spot on.  We lived in Zebulon, NC and used to drive out to the coast to get the barbeque at Simp's. I've been looking for this recipe for years.  It's the closest to Simp's I've ever found.

This recipe is right on. I was tasked by my sister to come up with something new (as opposed to the traditional ham sandwiches) to serve at our parents 40th wedding anniversary. I decided to bring a bit of the South to the North. I am a native of Minnesota (home of the HotDish) and have lived in SE Virginia for the past 15 years, so I know that new tastes don't usually come without recourse, especially with my family. I am happy to say that the Carolina Barbeque was a hit and turned out to be the perfect picnic style celebration food, and yes, I went all out and served the slaw for the correct consumption of this Southern favorite.

Wow!  Delicious.  I cooked the heck out of a pork roast in the crockpot with a little chicken broth, then shredded it and soaked it in this sauce.  I halved the recipe because it really makes a lot.  Served it with cole slaw on top on a kaiser roll.  Don't know if this is the proper southern way to enjoy it (I'm from New Jersey), but man was it good.  Have made it several times now and it always turns out perfect.  Great to serve at a cookout.

I made this for the first time as host for a family gathering and the reviews are in. For those who tried it, it was the "real deal" for vinegar-based sauce on some great pulled pork bbq. I thought it might too spicy for some, but once it was on the sandwiches it was perfect.  Two of the guests added some Texas Pete for added heat. Will definitely do this again.

I’ve made this a few times and my family loves it!! The first time I made it, I followed the recipe verbatim. The next time, instead of using red pepper flakes, I substituted 1 Tablespoon of Cayenne powder.

My question is this... should the 1 cup of light brown sugar be full-on packed or just lightly packed? If I remember correctly, I think the lightly packed wasn’t quite sweet enough. I wonder if “Lori” the recipe owner can clarify for me.

I recommend not using the cayenne peppers and use ketchup instead to give it a thickness to it. But other than that, it is pretty good and taste like Smithfield Chicken and BBQ's sauce.

I grew up in North Carolina and miss the local barbecue. Made Chef John's Pulled Pork BBQ on this site and used this sauce. Closest thing I've found to the wonderful barbecue there. Definitely a keeper.

Okay yesterday. Great today! I have given up any notion of finding N.C. barbecue here in Georgia. Parents from Lenoir Co. so father would always take us to Kings, or they would cater our family reunions. Only using a 4-lb Boston Butt , I did half the recipe, and still had more than enough. Just didn't have any cayenne peppers, so skipped that ingredient (Texas Pete sufficed). Made this with hush puppies, coleslaw, and sweet potatoes for a real taste of home.

I have tried several eastern nc bbq sauces, and I like this one the best so far. I added some additional red pepper flakes to it, which made it a little too hot. I think making it as described would provide the best result. I have a lang cooker and cook boston butts in large quantities 4-6 times a year. So  I don't do it professionally, but I do it often enough that I have more chances than most to sample these recipes. I like the western nc sauces as well, but I grew up in eastern nc, so this one feels a little more like home.
