Simple Parsnip Pancake Haiku: "Could use touch of heat. But I was amazed at these - no leftovers here!" Grating parsnips is a little time-consuming, but other than that, this recipe couldn't have been easier, and probably a whole lot better for us than the typical potato pancake that we eat. I think they could benefit from a dash of cayenne for a kick, but didn't mind dipping my bites into hot sauce. The recipe was easy to follow, and while I prepared the last of our dinner, I put the completed pancakes (about 8 min/side for my 3" blobbies) in a 300 deg oven to keep warm.

I was surprised at how much I liked this, since I am not a big rosemary fan. I may play with some herbs I like better and see if I can make it 5 stars. The secret to getting them to stay together is to make them small and cook really well before flipping.

These were nice. I like the contrast of salty and sweet so I added a bit of spicy salt.. also good with some wing sauce. It went well with sweetness from parsnips

These are so good I’ve already made them 3 times and I just discovered the recipe a week and a half ago. I made them once with thyme instead of rosemary, when I was out, and they were just as good. I’ve also used yellow onion in one batch and red in another and they were also just as good. I use Seasonello herbal salt, which is a mix of sea salt, rosemary, garlic, sage, and pepper and add some cayenne. I altered the measurements a bit to accommodate the portion I wanted. The following measurements yielded 6 good sized pancakes: 2 cups shredded parsnips (in my case, that was 1 large parsnip), 3 eggs (beaten), 1/2 cup finely chopped onion,  1 tsp Seasonello, 1 tsp thyme or rosemary, 2 Tbs olive oil, cayenne and fresh ground pepper to taste. I fried mine in peanut oil, 5 minutes each side, on medium heat. These pancakes are delicious with sriracha and I’d say they’re actually best eaten cold the next day.

These are good  I tripled the recipe but mine came out like egg foo young.  Probably my  fault  because I used Large eggs rather than small eggs per instructions.   They were still good and there were no leftovers.  Next time I will use small eggs.  Thanks for the recipie.

I was glad to find a good way to use some of the parsnips I got in my CSA box this week.  I would recommend doubling this recipe, because it's very toasty and satisfying as a side dish.  Instead of the finely chopped onion, I used half a leek, sliced fine, because I had one handy needing to be used.

Absolutely delicious, and you can substitute potatoes pretty easily as well.

These are amazing. I added some bread crumbs  to the mix and once done goat cheese and sweet/hot sauce. It was a hit!

I used two large eggs, after reading the comment that one large would probably be fine.  To fix things, I just added more parsnips and a carrot.  I also added some wheat germ, hoping it would soak up some of the extra liquid.  I used ginger, cloves, and cinnamon for spices.  They turned out pretty good.  Not sure I'd use the carrot next time, but might experiment with adding zucchini.  One of the two kids ate them, so I'd consider it a success.

Turned out great, a bit bland but still nice and very more-ish
