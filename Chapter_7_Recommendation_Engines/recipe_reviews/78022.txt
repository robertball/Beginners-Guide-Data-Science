Absolutely delicious!  I only used strawberries as I didn't have blueberries.  I used toasted almonds instead of pecans for the same reason.  Couldn't believe it - but I had run out of regular curry powder and so used Garam Masala instead and this added a wonderful cinnamon taste to the dressing.  This was a really lovely dressing all on its own, but made spectacular by the fruit and spinach.  My 11 year old daughter couldn't get enough.  Will definately put this on my "to make again" list.

I have come to love this dressing...I must admit that I am a little heavy-handed with the honey, but since that is really where most of the calories come from, it is a great low-cal dressing.

Nutritional, colorful salad..very pretty..thanks for sharing, but we found the vinegar overpowering (maybe I'm a wimp :().  I made it again, using half the vinegar (balsamic only), extra honey..and slowly whipped in a tablespoon of oil at the end to make an emulsion..my husband and I enjoyed it much more ..a few more calories, but for us it was worth it for the taste and cling factor. We'll be making it again..thank-you.

Dressing was the perfect blend & balanced for the berries and the salad.  We used blackberries (not blueberries) and roasted sunflower seeds (not pecans) for personal tastes.  We served this and everyone went bonkers over it.  Thanks to whomever created this for such a tremendous recipe!

This makes a great meal!  Very tasty....  Changes I made: - Replaced Rice Vinegar w/ Olive Oil (dressing is still a little bit more "vinegary" than I would have prefered) - added avocado  - used sliced almonds instead of pecans

Yum! This recipe is great on its own but I added a few things I had that needed to be used up. I added some avocado and cilantro (so yummy with the curry flavor) and added a bit of udo oil to the dressing (can add olive oil) as it was very tangy.. i also did not add the rice vinegar. Will definitely make it again, and for sure with cilantro, i loved the flavor!

I made the curry dressing for a standard salad for a curry-crazy friend, and will definitely make it again...  Lots of vinegar, but I love that!  It was a hit!

the dressing is pure win. I switched the pecans for sunflower seeds, and used a salad mix instead of spinach because that was the "leafy veggie" in my produce box for this week. I feel any kind of nut/seeds would fit with this recipe. =) this will stick to my recipe box forever!

This was yummy, and I love how healthy it was.  I couldn't find plain rice vinegar, so got Balsalmic Blend, and it seemed to work.  Dressing was very tangy.  Oh and I used walnuts instead of pecans.  Yummy and healthy, quick to throw together.  I'd make this again.  It would go well with chicken salad sandwiches, we had it with chicken burgers and hamburgers.

I made this some time ago and came back looking for it again.  We make a few subsitutions (nut allergies!), but don't mess with the dressing itself.  It's great on any combination of greens, meats and/or fruit.  We especially like it on a hot day with chicken, spinach, sunflower seeds and whatever berries are ready in our yard.

This was so good.  I loved it as is.  After eating some without it, I added some blue cheese and that kicked it up even another notch.  The dressing smells amazing.

Wow, this is the first recipe that totally tanked!  I followed the recipe to the last detail.  Way too much vinegar.  The spinach sucked up the liquid and was limp, like a slaw.  Sorry, but will not be making this again.

This salad is wonderful. The mix of sweet, tangy and spicy makes it very satisfying. We ate it as a light dinner with whole grain bread, and enjoyed it very much.

Too much vinegar for me. Loved the salad however, so this will be made again (sans dressing). I also substituted sunflower seeds instead of walnuts- still had the nutty flavor but was lighter.

Really wonderful.  Kept the dressing as written, but changed the salad to what I had on hand.  Used pears instead of berries and added chicken breast and made the salad a meal, also didn't add onion since my husband does not like them.

This salad was very fresh and delicious. My only complaint is that the curry was a bit too strong for me but, I'm not a huge curry fan and so I'm sure it is the perfect amout for most people. This salad screamed nutrition and low-fat. I was very pleased. *****update***I actually used the low-fat version from this site

This is a very nice spinach salad with just a hint of curry.  The lack of oil in the dressing makes this a very low-cal salad.

This salad is just delightful. To be honest, I only used about a quarter of a small red onion and I feel that was just enough. But the dressing was amazing. Complimented this dish nicely. I upped the servings by about two or so and between two adults and a two year old it was devoured. A must have for BBQ's.

This was a fabulous salad! The dressing was spicy and had some kick to it. I used red curry powder and chives instead of sweet onion. The dressing really made this salad special so definitely make it. DELICIOUS!!!!

Excellent!  I added mandarin oranges as well, and combined spring mix lettuce with the spinach.  The vinaigrette was fantabulous, although I did add a dollop of olive oil.  I might try a dollop of walnut oil the next time.  I WILL make this again.

Wonderful!  I added 1/8 tsp. sugar to make it a little less tangy.  I used candied (sugar) pecans - that helped cut down on the tartness of the vinegar.  Thanks for the recipe!

I'm pretty sure this is the salad I had at a potluck party recently.  I thought it was amazing (all that wonderful fruit and pecans) and immediately did an ingredient search when I got home. I thought when I tasted it at the party that the dressing had a light taste, but I had no idea that there was absolutely no oil.  Personally, I feel this particular recipe has a bit too much vinegar, but that's just my opinion and no reason not to give this 5 *s.  Besides DH loved it and he's not a lite dressing fan.  By the way, I used spring mix for my salad base, as that is what I had on hand.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I gave this five starts for the vinegrette dressing alone! This is an extremely adaptable salad.  I used 1 14.5 oz can of mandarin oranges, drained, and a handful of craisins in place of the strawberries and blueberries which aren't really in season right now.  I'm sure it would be equally as good with canned pears.  I also dry toasted my chopped pecans in a saute pan for a few minutes, stirring every so often.  I used one bag of baby spinach which equaled 6 cups not packed.  I poured the entire dressing over the salad and tossed to coat.  It was wonderful, even the next day when the spinach wilted and people at work were asking me what that wonderful smell was!  This is a keeper all year round because it is so adaptable and so healthy!  Thanks!

This is a wonderful salad - very light and flavorful.  I particularly enjoyed the curry dressing - I usually make extra to use on everything from arugula to pasta salad.

I used strawberries only, might have tasted better with all the selection of berries. I also substituted sliced toasted almonds for the pecans. My husband and I liked the dressing but thought it was a bit tangy.

This was wonderful.  I made no changes except to reduce the amount of onion by 1/2 but that is a matter of personal taste.  The dressing, the important part of the recipe, I made exactly as described and it was terrific.  I will definitely make this again but will also use the dressing for other salads.

Loved this. Added a few things. Olive oil to dressing. Had no problem with amount of vinegar. Just wanted to add taste of oil. Added goat cheese. Caramelized the onions. And toasted pumpkin seeds, since my son is allergic to nuts.

Love this salad. I've made it several times for company and everyone loves it. I didn't have rice vinegar so used apple cider vinegar as suggested by another reviewer. I love the dressing so much I just make it and keep it in the fridge to use on my everyday boring salad. YUM!

Excellent! I loved that there was no oil in the dressing, therefore lower cals. I loved the hint of curry. I even added a bit more and it wasn't very noticeable...just enough to give the dressing a nice twist. I gobbled it up too fast I didn't even have time to take a pic! Next time!

I still have the paper clipping of this recipe from the late 90's or so. I was really happy to find it here. One of my all time favorite salads. I make it just as stated and have also altered it by adding feta, or blue cheese crumbles, used stone ground mustard, left off the onions, left out the nuts, etc  and it has always been great.

I liked this salad, and the salad dressing is spicy, hot!  The curry adds quite a different flair.  My husband said it's a 9 out of 10, so I guess we will be having it again.  I didn't have any blueberries, too bad, because I think it would have tamed the dressing down a bit!  :-)

I did not have the fruit on hand so I did walnuts and apples, the dressing is what really makes the salad though and I think any fruit nut mixture would be great.  The dressing is great and such a nice change from the day to day!!  will make again and again!

Loved the salad, especially the dressing.  Balsamic and curry are two of our favorites! Changed the basic ingredients a bit: spinach, strawberries, almonds, feta cheese and chives.  My husband and I love to have salads for dinner - I think we've found a new staple.

My family loved this very much. My husband was worried about the fruit and the dressing because he didn't think that they would be good together. He ended up loving it. My kids also loved it. Mostly because of the fruit of course but who cares they ate raw spinach happily :) Love the dressing in this.

Nice and light salad. I only used strawberries because I didn't have blueberries. I also omitted the onions, just a preference.

My husband and I loved this, kids did not(of course!).  Didn't have any Dijon so I substituted spicy brown mustard instead and it still came out great. The dressing is delicious. I'm making this again tonight as I have lots of strawberries and blueberries on hand.

ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS: Wonderful delight on the pallet, easy on the digestion, and quite suitable for the diet conscious person. When considering the variation of the combined contents, you wouldn't think these would go well together; But they certainly do, and this is the BEST salad I've ever eaten in 50 years. Two thumbs up on this one.

This was excellent!  The dressing was a hit! I had to use olive oil instead of the rice vinegar b/c thats all I had and it worked out great!

This is an amazing salad....Didn't have blueberries...but I decided to add some plain creamy goat cheese and also I caramelized the pecan halves in the oven...just toss pecan halves in some pure maple syrup and a bit of brown sugar, and put in the oven at 400 for about 10min...you might want to stay close and keep an eye on them as every oven is different and they can burn very quickly....also I added a bit of paprika to the dressing...very good!

At first I turned my nose up at this recipe.  Couldn't imagine the flavors working together, but willing to try a new recipe.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  It's so great, too, you can use whatever berries/fruit you have on hand.  The curry & mustard add just the right amount of spicy to the salad.  You'll never miss the oil.

Yum!!!  Who needs a main course when the salad is so tasty.  I thawed a frozen berry blend since I had no fresh fruit, and it was still great.  I can't wait to try it with fresh fruits.

This is the best no-oil dressing ever! I poured it over a spinach salad with strawberries, walnuts and grilled chicken. So good.

Made this recipe according to directions. It was wonderful - loved the dressing.  Only change I would make is a scant teaspoon of curry.  Would make again. Great summer salad recipe!

I liked this.  It was different than anything I have tasted.  I made candied pecans with it and added raspberries for a tart taste.  Good!

Excellent recipe! I used blackberries and candied pecans. The curry dressing itself is a keeper for future salads.  All the ingredients complemented very well together.

Absolutely wonderful!  Great flavors -- I brought this to a pot-luck supper and everyone raved about it, asking for the recipe!  This will be something I'll make over and over again!

A great salad combination but the dressing was a bit too tangy for our liking as others have commented.  Next time I will try using raspberry vinegar or a cidar vinegar. The curry was a nice addition.  I will make this again.
