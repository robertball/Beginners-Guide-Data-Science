Okay, I've got this down now, I've made it a several times since my first review.  Here are my changes...1/2 cup mayo, 1/2 cup light sour cream. I use Emmentaler swiss cheese melts very well and is cheaper than Gruyere.  If I can't find button mushrooms I use regular sliced mushrooms.  I add a little flour and water (before adding the scallops)  to the sauce so it's not too runny.  And very important...the bread crumbs.  I use plain Panko (Japanese style) bread crumbs...so much better than the fine bread crumbs and I squeeze a little lemon juice into the melted butter and Panko crumbs. Let the casserole stand for a few minutes after removing from the oven to allow the sauce to thicken.  Better than any restaurant!

Took other reviewers' advice and used mostly thick cream with just a spoon or so of mayo to make up the quantity. Apart from that, followed recipe exactly and it was fabulously good. The other half practically burst into song and said it was the best Coquilles St Jacques he'd ever had. What we both loved about it was that the balance of the wine in the sauce was perfect - sometimes restaurants use so much it's overpowering. Will definitely make again. And again. And again. Thank you.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe the way it read the first time and modified it the next.  It was  unbelievably FANTASTIC this way: Bay scallops, 1/2 C. crumbled Ritz crackers and 1/3 C. Italian seasoned bread crumbs for the top, regular grated Swiss, cut the button mushrooms in 1/2 (instead of sliced ones), and cut down on the mayo slightly. Yum, yum, yum. 10 stars :)

My husband said this was the best Coquilles St. Jacques that he has ever had at home or in a fine restaurant.  It is also the best I have ever made or eaten anywhere.  Very rich and smooth with the wonderful nutiness of gruyere cheese.  I plan to make this for dinner the next time I have good friends coming.  Didn't rate it high for kids because of the onions and mushrooms.  Kids don't know what's good.

Hubs made this for us tonite and he said unless you want this swimming in mayonnaise and cheese cut back....on EVERYTHING - except the scallops, of course.  So a weak three stars as written. If he cut back on everything to get this to taste as awesome good as it did then I'd take his advice, especially since neither Gruyere nor scallops are cheap.  Whatever he did this was beyond 5-star delicious and decadent.  Prepared in porcelain shell dishes, this was impressive and elegant as well as lip-smacking good.

The mayo taste can be overpowering. I substitute half the mayonnaise with a heavy cream or cream cheese and it is delicious. We serve it often.

My husband LOVED this,,,he thought it was restaurant material!  Some changes I made though.  I used 6 jumbo scallops (the bigger ones I halved) because I was afraid the smaller ones would overcook and get to rubbery.  I seared them, then I used a splash of apple juice in place of wine, 1 tblspn of mayo ONLY, marble cheese (that is all I had) and some parmesean.  Once that all blended together, turn off the heat, add the scallops and a splash of cream....maybe 2-3 tblspns.  Amazing!

This was an awesome dish!!  I made this for my Italian Christmas Eve Fish dinner and everyone loved it.  I didn't add the mushrooms, because my uncle is allergic and I used bay scallops instead of the sea scallops.  It was perfect.  Thanks!!

These were very good.  I have a hard time finding recipes both my husband and I like, but we both really enjoyed this one.  I couldn't find the cheese that was called for so I used baby swiss - YUMMY!!

This is a delicious, easy dish. Perfectly flavored, not overpoweringly rich. After reading some of the reviews, I reduced the mayo considerably - by about a third. Also to reduce fat, I used low fat swiss cheese and lesser amounts of margarine throughout. I also garnished the edges with piped mashed potatoes which are a nice crispy finishing touch.

I thought these were fantastic, but no one else in my family finished theirs.  Definitely need to have a taste for gruyere to enjoy.

I made this recipe for dinner last night and it was a big hit.  Loved the flavor and it is restaurant quality.  I used Panko bread crumbs, used only 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup heavy cream per other reviews, added some minced garlic and used Swiss cheese because I did not have enough Gruyere cheese on hand.   Next time I will make this dish with the Gruyere cheese though because that is a favorite of mine.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good recipe. I did as others and decreased the mayonnaise to 1/2 cup and I used panko bread crumbs as well.  Very good and gourmet, impressed my honey and myself! A must try!

This is our favorite treat!  It is FANTASTIC!  Gruyere cheese can be hard to find and a little pricy so I sometimes sub it with a good swiss cheese. LOVE IT!

I left out the button mushrooms, but only as a personal preference. Note: this dish is REALLY rich, so you might want to take it easy on the amount of cream and cheese that is put in there. Nonetheless, it is delicious. For fancy presentation, try scooping out portions into large scallop shells.

This was a waste of good scallops and doesn't deserve to bear its name.  The sauce should be much more subtle even though I substituted half the mayo with heavy cream.  It should be creamy white not cheesy/mayo.  I definitely won't make this again.

WOW!!!  This was amazing -- my husband and I could hardly believe we were eating it at home, much less that I had made it!!  I didn't have the mayonnaise that was called for so I used half M*racle Whip and half ricotta cheese instead.  I also substituted white cooking wine (couldn't open a whole bottle for a quarter cup) and dried parsley and it was still amazing -- very rich and very cheesey!

This was EXCELLENT! I never new making Coquilles St. Jacques was so easy! I did scale it down a bit and used 1/2 pound of scallops and just used water instead of opening up a bottle of wine for such a little bit. I will DEFINITELY be making this again! Thanks Doreen!  :)

I have made this several times now. I use approx. 3/4 c. of sour cream and 1/4 c. of light mayo. I have used Emmenthaler cheese and Jarlsberg cheese when necessary. I definitely use more than 1/4 c. of white wine... I add to taste. This recipe is amazing and as good as the local French restaurant that has changed ownership and is not as good.

I made Coquilles St. Jacque totally different over the years. Heavy Cream and Milk mixture, butter,, white wine, parm/romano cheese, sliced mushrooms, as the sauce, then saute the whole scallops in this sauce.  Pour over cooked linquini.

This was an amazing recipe.  Follow people's advice below and substitute heavy cream for most of the mayo (I used 1/4 cup mayo, 3/4 cup heavy cream).  The result is absolutely delicious.  And it was fairly easy to make as well.  Hubby almost never makes the happy noises until I tweak it, but this one he LOVED right off the bat!

Absolutely scrumptious!!!!  I prepared this last night for my husband's birthday.  This dish is wonderful - so rich, so gourmet.  Not your everyday dinner; save this one for special occasions.  I'll go a touch lighter on the bread crumbs next time, but other than that, don't change a thing!

Wonderful! The cheese sauce is not too heavy, just nicely creamy. I doubled the mushrooms, because I love em.

I think sour cream would work better than the mayo to cut down on the richness of the sauce.  Will try again using about 3/4 cup sour cream.

I made this one night when I wanted to try something new.  I found the overall taste to be good, but a little gummy.  My husband, who is a very good eater and not fussy at all, did not like this.

This was a very rich dish. After spending so much money on the scallops though, I was a bit disappointed that the scallops took a backseat to the sauce.  The sauce was wonderful; perhaps too much so!  If I ever make this again, I'll use the bay scallops.  This recipe comes together very quickly too.  Thanks for the post Doreen!

This was wonderful.  Much simpler than other recipes I have for the dish.  I added some Old Bay seasoning to the scallops and a little in the sauce.  Also used half wine and half sherry.  My husband loved it, too.

Too rich. I only could eat a couple bites. My boyfriend ate all of his though. I will modify next time using less mayonnaise and cheese and adding cayenne pepper.

My wife is a scallop snob,   and she loved this recipe. I used red wine mixed with apple cider vinegar, as I had no white wine. All turned out great, we will keep this recipe for sure! Oh,  I  make my own toasted bread crumbs,  takes 10 minutes, and well worth it.

Too rich for my taste.  Perhaps the extra 1/2 lbs of scallops was too much and I would’ve preferred the gruyere cheese taste to be a little more subtle.  I made it as a casserole and will do individually if make it again.

This is an outstanding recipe! I took the advice of other reviewers and used 1/2 cup mayonnaise and 1/2 cup heavy cream, and panko crumbs for the topping. I'll try this again, adding garlic to the onion/mushroom mix. It's definitely a keeper!

I followed the recipe except that I added  a ring of mashed potato around the outside before putting it in the oven. I added a generous serving of snow peas to make it a complete main course.

Had scallops in the freezer that I needed to fix.  Read several reviews and opted to use 4 oz of cream cheese and 2 big Tb of mayo.  Also had baby Swiss so used it.  It was wonderful but very filling.  Will try using  heavy cream instead of cream cheese next time.

Cut the mayo in half and used panko crumbs, but left everything else the same and everyone enjoyed it!  Hubby commented that it was no where near as salty as commercial ones.  Will definitely make this again.

Made it for my hubby and we both agreed that the cheese was too much.  If I make it again, I will cut back on the cheese and may and maybe use some type of mustard.

We just finished dinner and wanted to review this recipe. I chose to use half the mayo and added heavy cream to measure the one cup. I also would add alittle garlic as we both like this added flavor. I also used swiss cheese and we both agree that this is a "keeper".
