I tripled the recipe and made them by hand so I could turn them into rolls. They are absolutely fabulous sandwich rolls!

For people who enjoy a savoury bread this made a really good loaf.  I did end up adding a little more water after about 5 minutes in the bread machine.
I like all the ingredients but may next time back off the dill a bit as I found it a bit too overpowering.
This made a really good crusty loaf when set to Medium.
Ideal and really yummy for toasted tomatoe sandwiches.
Will be making this again for sure.

If you like a chewy crust and warm, moist bread, then this is a good recipe made even better by using freshly chopped onions and real butter. I set my bread machine to the LIGHT CRUST setting and remove it from the pan after letting it rest on the counter for 10-15 minutes before removing it from the baking pan.

I use the heck out of my bread machine and everyone always enjoys the results, but this recipe was a HUGE hit w/ family & guests last night.  I won't "rate" a recipe unless I follow it exactly and that's what I did with this one.  No one thought the dill was too strong.  I'm making another loaf this morning and thought I'd add some caraway seeds.  My grown daughter stopped me, saying: "This recipe is perfect!  Don't mess with it!"

I made this last night.  I followed other suggestins and lessen the dill to 2 teaspoons and was glad I did.  I think a Tbsp would have been overpowering.  I used the dough cycle on my bread machine and then formed them into 10 rolls.  They were nice and crisp on the ouside and tender on the inside.  Thank you for the  recipe.

Pretty good.  this does make a very fragrant and flavorful bread, and the loaf is a small loaf when all is said and done.  I made on the dough cycle, let it rise in a pan and baked for about 45 minutes at 375 in the oven.  Turned out well.  thanks for the recipe!

Very fragrant while cooking. The bread has a very strong flavor; tasty but strong.

I have used my breadmaker extensively to bake many delicious breads, but this one just did NOT turn out. It turned out more like a scone than bread. I followed all of the instructions to the T, but somehow the bread turned out very dry, small, and hard. It's still kind of tasty in a sconey way, but certainly not what I would call bread.

This is exceptional!  I have made it a quite a few times now.  the only thing I change is I just add milk instead of water and milk powder.  This makes an excellent grilled cheese sandwich!!!  I serve with super simple tomato basil soup (recipe this site) and its always a hit!  Thank you!

I made this twice in a week - this is delicious bread! I made a couple changes per previous reviews - milk instead of water and milk powder, and reduce the dill to 2 tbs., and I increased the yeast by about a 1/4 tsp. since my first loaf took a long time to rise. This does make a pretty small loaf - I'd maybe 1.5x the recipe to make it just the right size. I also don't have a breadmaker, so I don't know if that affects the rise time. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Update: I actually won first prize at our county fair with this recipe. It's awesome!
