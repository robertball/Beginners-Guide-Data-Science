As a Belgian, my expectations about chocolate mousse are quite high. I was a little bit surprised by this recipe containing no cream at all, but it sounded very easy to prepare and to scale. I must admit that THIS IS A REAL GOOD BITTER CHOCOLATE MOUSSE. You must try it if you're a chocolate connoisseur.

Really quick and easy.  When I made it a second time, I decided to add some cream that I had as well - don't do it, it was FAR nicer without!!

Very good - I used Tia Maria as the alcohol, and 72% dark chocolate.  It took quite awhile to blend the egg yolk/chocolate mixture with the egg white, and there were a few little lumps of chocolate left, but it tasted great.  I served it in glasses with a side serve of vanilla bean ice cream to cut through the richness - guests loved it.

Delicious.  This took about 5 minutes to prepare and it came out wonderful.  For the people who said it was clumpy, you need to make sure you fold it really well.  Do that and you have a treat.

This mousse was great!  VERY easy to make and it was delicious.  All my friends loved it.  Serve them in wine glasses with a little whip cream as garnish and they look awesome too!

To the reviewer who said her chocolate became pasty  after adding her egg yolks ...this will happen if you add your eggs in hot chocolate because it cooks up the eggs.Make sure the chocolate is somewhat cool to the touch when you add the yolks and you should not have a  clumpy pasty chocolate mousse.

My mousse came out great.  I do think the kind of chocolate you use will affect the flavor; however, I don't think the quality affects the consistency of the mousse itself.  I used a cheap bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips that I bought 4-6 months ago, and the texture of the mousse still came out perfectly.  The semi-sweet flavor of the chocolate was a bit overwhelming; next time I will simply use a chocolate I like to eat as is for the mousse.  Overall a good recipe.

This was delicious!  I added 3 tsps of Baily's instead and it gave it a really nice kick.  Thanks!

This recipe was very tasty and quick to prepare. There was one scary moment when I accidentally added the liqueur to the melted chocolate before adding the eggs. DON'T DO THIS. It really got stiff and hard to manage, luckily the egg yolks went in smoothly and it turned out well (with lots of beating). I will follow the instructions precisely next time. Folding the egg whites into the chocolate properly is also key, if you don't keep folding you end up with tiny (egg white) lumps. I will definitely be trying this again with different flavoring as well! Also, to the reviewer who said they ended up with a burned chocolate taste: watch the chocolate when melting it, if you let it scorch, your mousse will not work out. Please give this recipe a try, it really is delicious!

I really like this simple recipe.  I think you can flavor it up any way you'd like to suit your taste.  I only had semi-sweet chocolate in the house and it worked just fine.

Yum! I used bittersweet Ghirardelli chocolate pieces and Frangelico hazelnut liqueur instead of rum. We first mixed about a third of the egg whites into the chocolate with a whisk to make the incorporation easier. In erring on the side of caution for fear of losing volume, we probably didn't fold the whites in as much as we should have. There were some small chunks, but honestly the mousse was still fabulous, light and airy!

This was just awful.   I melted the choc via microwave according to guide book. But when I started to add the eggs, it "dried up"??  SO it looked liked paste.  I folded in the egg whites, but that didn't make a difference, now it was soupy and GRITTY???   What a waste of eggs; especially at the price of eggs these days.

Simple and simply great. As easy as the pudding based versions with the quality of being the real deal. Added a bit of Disaronno Amaretto in place of the rum. Really good, really easy.

For some reason, we didn't like this very much.  I think it was the texture, not the flavor.  We threw half of it out and that never happens to chocolate in this house.

A WOW factor recipe I've been making for years and I was glad to find the same recipe on this site. I always use good quality dark cooking chocolate and ensure the chocolate is melted very slowly to avoid clumping before mixing in the yolks and rum or brandy. A real winner of a recipe and everyone thinks I'm a 5 star chef when I serve this one up with fresh whipped cream to finish!

This was wonderful.  Loved it.  Didn't have bittersweet chocolate but semi-sweet and unsweeted combined seemed to do the trick.  Watch out for the leftovers - a gross skim will form on top if you aren't careful.  Not pleasant.

Great recipe

While this recipe yields a tasty result... it is also a lumpy one.  I tried several different times to make this work out to the smooth texture one expects of mousse.  No matter what I tried, the chocolate set far too quickly and couldn't be thinned out enough to fold in the eggwhites gently.  I have never had this problem with any other mousse recipe.

Just made this for my husband's birthday party, and spooned it into short martini glasses. I used rum-flavored Kahlua and semi-sweet chocolate and followed the directions. To save clean-up, I used the whisk attachment on my immersion blender to beat the egg yolks and add them to the melted chocolate, and then I used my KitchenAid hand mixer to beat the egg whites. It worked perfectly, and I will have to make another half recipe so I have 14 servings. I think I will add a few raspberries to each glass to garnish for a non-dairy treat.

Wonderful! Followed the instructions exactly and it turned out perfect! After melting the chocolate I let it cool slightly and poured it into another bowl that had the egg yolks pre-mixed. I think this might have helped with what others said  about small chunks when it cooked the egg yolks. With just two ingredients, this recipe is simple and easy, but looks and tastes like you slaved for ours. Will definitely keep this recipe on hand!

So so delicious! We made it for Thanksgiving and taste tested it with Chef John's yummy chocolate mousse recipe. All of us liked this one best! We used vanilla extract in part of them and orange liqueur in the other part and they were absolutely the best part of the meal! I can't believe how easy it was, we followed the recipe exactly. I did pasteurize the eggs (boil them 3 minutes at 140 degrees) since we had kids eating them. Will make again and again and again!!

Excellent with irish creama amaretto or kaluha in place of rum. Ive tried them all.
