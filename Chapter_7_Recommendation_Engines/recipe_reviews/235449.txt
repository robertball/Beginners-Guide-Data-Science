This was good and glad I tried it.  Followed the recipe except for Step 2.  I just browned the Brussels sprouts and garlic in the oven instead of sauteing them on top of the stove.  Thanks Kyle!

Very tasty. I followed this recipe to the letter. It’s way too soft and soggy due to, I would guess, the chicken stock. The last time I made it I found a similar recipe that lacks the balsamic vinegar, and chicken stock. Everything else was  basically the same. That recipe was much better and the leftovers were still tasty.

Really good.  Added some fresh parmesan at the end and it worked well.  Love this because it is so easy, no special ingredients and is an amazing way to get kids to eat vegetables...our girls loved it.  I used pancetta instead of bacon...I find it better for cooking in situations like this.

I like this recipe because it is so simple and the cook can change the amount of ingredients "to taste" without altering the recipe. I personally LOVE garlic. So I put  much more garlic than  1 clove. However, some people are sensitive to too much garlic and will be pleased with only one.
I  tend to see too many AllRecipe cooks rave at  a recipe and then proceed to change it by adding or substituting  an ingredient. It is no longer the recipe then Folks.

This was really good. I didn't use all the bacon grease because it seemed like too much. My husband said they tasted like something you get at a restaurant. Will definitely make again!

Made it as written and it was very good.  But I felt that it could do with less bacon/drippings and would still be good.  The method of preparations was simple.  I think that next time, and there will be a next time,  that I would  reduce the amount of the bacon/drippings and the butter.  With all the fat that's in this recipe, it turns a very healthy side dish into one that's high in calories and fats.

I skipped the butter and vinegar and added a bit of brown sugar. Instead of doing these on the stove I put them in the oven. Turned out pretty good

Delicious! I slightly modified the recipe by sautéing the Brussels sprouts with a chopped onion and I added about half the butter and reduced the amount of vinegar slightly to adjust for the butter when making the vinegar glaze. I will be making this one again!

This recipe was delicious! The only modification I made was to add about 1/2 cup of chopped onion. I never cared for Brussels sprouts before, but this will be a regular dish now.

My husband and I were raised hating nasty Brussels sprouts and didn’t eat them for decades.  His praise for this recipe is “they’re not that bad” which is high praise.  Definitely worth making again!

Love this recipe but it needed a little help.  Braise the brussel sprouts first.  Pull them out THEN cook bacon.  To make this a heartier meal pull out bacon, leave drippings,  and add thinly sliced potatoes.  Once potatoes are crisp add bacon and sprouts back in and let the whole thing cook together for a few minutes.  (Onions can be cooked between bacon and potatoes).

Great recipe and very easy to make.  One bit of advice is to watch your sodium level.  The bacon cure, the balsamic vinegar, and butter could and probably do contain salt.  The first time I made this I add salt per the recipe and the dish was too salty for me and others (using unsalted butter).  Now when I prepare this I use no added salt and rely on the bacon cure and vinegar to carry that load.  Make it without and add salt to taste at the very end if you think it needs more.

We love brussel sprouts and this recipe was over the top and easy.   I used a cast iron pan and cooked it all start to finish on our gas grill outside. Perfection!

We enjoyed the Skillet Braised Brussel Sprouts, but maybe didn't saute quite enough as they were on the raw  side of al dente. I plan  to try it again but with more stock next time.

In order to keep the stovetop clear for other pots, I placed the ingredients, after softening, into a foil pan, covered is with aluminum foil and placed it in the oven to finish before serving with main course.

This dish surpassed my expectations. I’ve never eaten Brussel Sprouts before so they were my holiday dinner surprise. The family loved these little cabbage cuties. I may add a little honey with the Balsamic next time.

Great side dish for thanksgiving dinner. Combined this with another recipe I had. Seared the sprouts on cut side and added a shallot with the garlic. I didn’t use any stock as I blanched them in boiling water first. I know it’s not the Same recipe, but turned out great

I followed the recipe with everything except the black pepper as my wife and I don't care for it. Also, instead of thinly slicing a clove of garlic, I put in some small cloves of roasted garlic.

After tasting the good savory recipe, I wanted some sweetness, so I added some dried cranberries and about 1 1/2 tsp of maple syrup. After cooking off most of the moisture and softening the sprouts a bit, the resulting dish was nearly perfect.

My wife said that these were the best Brussels sprouts she ever had. She got turned off of Brussels sprouts after eating some that were bitter at a restaurant. Since I found this recipe, she thought they were worth a try again and she was very pleased. We will keep this recipe (with my tweaks) for many future meals.

Absolutely wonderful, delicious sprouts recipe!  Look at this recipe carefully and adjust steps and seasonings to your liking .  I braised a few more minutes with lid on, as I prefer my sprouts somewhat more tender.  Try this, you will be surprised at how good it is!

I didn't have bacon so I used Pancetta. I also added 1 small shallot,  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. My husband said they were the best he has ever had! I really don't like Brussels Sprouts but even I thought they were okay.

Used beef broth since that's what I had.  Used a combination of brussel sprouts and carrots, that worked well.  Didn't use the butter.

I found this recipe when I wanted something other than store bought frozen or plain old steamed brussel sprouts. Thought I had all the ingredients, but of course, I didn't. It turned out great anyway. I replaced the basalmic vinegar with apple cider vinegar and some Worcestershire sauce. Everybody really enjoyed it. Great recipe and not difficult to make. Thanks!

Tried this recipe on a whim and will definitely add it to the regular rotation.   The sprouts tasted great, the recipe was easy and quick.  I left out the dairy (butter) and didn’t notice anything missing in the flavor.

I added a few chopped green onions about 1 minute before the end of the cooking time.  Next time I may toss in some slivered almonds.
 I made this the night before a family pitch in dinner.  Then just reheated it in the microwave.  Everyone loved it.

This was really good. Wife and son are not big brussel sprout fans but ate this up and asked for more.  Only change/addition was I also diced up a small shallot and added it at the same time I added the garlic. Definitely something I will make again.

Didnt have bacon so used ground beef instead. Steamed the brussel sprouts in the chicken stock longer to make them softer. Also doubled the garlic and added onions and paprika in as well. So good!!

I made some changes,like using deli ham instead of bacon and sauteeing that in the butter along with onions in addition to the garlic, plus using freshly grated Romano cheese after drizzling on the vinegar. It came out great!

I went by the recipe, and Wow!  These are good. tangy and savory.  I got a little impatient, and didn't give the liquid time to fully evaporate, but there was still plenty of flavor on the sprouts.  I'll definitely make these again.

This is a great recipe and I've made it a couple of times. It is important to find a good vinegar or balsamic to toss it in.

Doubled the recipe but used only 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar based on other reviews I read. It was delicious and everyone enjoyed it. Nothing was left! Would definitely make again.

I made these for Christmas, just as written. I couldn’t use the oven because hubby had a prime rib in it. So I had to find a recipe to make on the stove. These were a hit. Thanks for the recipe!

This was fantastic! I made per the recipe with one minor substitution - I was out of chicken broth, but still had raw chicken in the fridge. So, I boiled it w seasoning, and used 1/2 cup of that water has the chicken broth - which is probably do again so I can watch the sodium. Overall, this was lovely, easy, and will be made again and again.

Very Good.  If you never thought you'd like Brussels (or mini-brains as my brother always used to call them) TRY this recipe!

We used to make something similar at a high end restaurant I worked in and I stumbled across this recipe while looking for something similar. It's not the same, but also doesn't take nearly as long....and boy it is good! Thanks kyle!

Not sure if I didn’t cook them long enough,  I prefer a crunch in the bacon and with the stock it was not. Probably will not make this recipe again

This might be my favorite way to do Brussels Sprouts.  Excellent recipe!  I added grated Parmesan once served which turned out to be the perfect addition to an already great dish.

If you like it sweet, go with the balsamic vinegar. I went with double fermented soy sauce and white vinegar.

Excellent, used a lower calorie bacon that I cooked by itself and just cooked Brussels in the broth without any fat added to the dish. Used Al fresco chicken bacon, for lower calories. Had a nice aged balsamic that was good. A favorite way to do Sprouts. Thank you

I think what I didn't like about it was the chicken stock. I should have substituted for vegetable stock. I did like the addition of balsamic vinegar to it. That made it a three star. I'm planning on making it again though for my mom. I have extra stock left and I think she will enjoy it even when it was so so for me. Thanks for the recipe, perhaps my mom will enjoy it and I can save the recipe for her. Also I found out how adding a touch of balsamic vinegar to brussel sprouts really gives it a flavour! As well, I liked that this was fast and easy to make.

I rarely have bacon so i do without and use olive oil for bacon fat to braise them in. I use my favorite balsamic vinegar dressing.  I have made many times since i love them so much. I even eat cold for a snack when I get home from work. Love, love, love

Delicious as promised ??. I added Craisins and chopped pecans at the step where you remove the lid to reduce the broth. Other recipes included these two which add a tangy texture and crunchy nibble. Next time I’ll add scallions with the garlic ??

I had several bags of frozen brussels sprouts that I wanted to use up, so I tried it with one of those.  They were the microwavable-type, so I just didn't overcook them. I usually have bacon fat on hand, so I added that to the pan, and then the cooked sprouts, jarred garlic and after a while, the rest of the ingredients.  I used microwavable bacon and skipped the chicken broth. Nice dish.

I loved the flavor and my husband, who usually skips vegetables, really liked them too!  I think the cooking times were a little long, I followed them exactly and the veggies were a little overcooked, but I'll definitely try this again!

We have made this a number of times and absolutely love it. I wouldn't make it too often since it uses heavy cream but I have been known to substitute half and half in its place. A nice change of pace from the healthier brussel sprouts.

I will definitely make this again. Lots of interesting flavors combining to make a really tasty dish that looks incredibly appetizing in the serving dish! Next time I might add some shallots for an added onion flavor and I might try substituting  chopped pancetta for the bacon. Always fun to try something a little different!

I made this for Christmas dinner one year to freshen up our traditional menu, and now it is a " must have" dish for the annual feast. Even those who aren't fans of the humble Brussels sprout liked this dish. Easy and delicious!

Very good. You can't go wrong with a vegetable made with bacon. I had to drain off some of the bacon fat before continuing with the recipe. Other then that I followed the recipe. I would make this again.  Good as left overs as well.

I am a huge brussels sprouts fan. This was by far the most tasty and easy recipe for making them. I will definitely make this again.

I have to admit. I hated brussel sprouts until recently and I've been researching and trying various recipes for them. This is by far the best recipe I've found. I even took some to work and my coworkers loved them too. Of course, I do add a little more bacon. Haha

I had to add more olive oil to skillet while cooking sprouts, and I used pancetta instead of bacon, but everyone loved it. Would definitely make it again.

This was delicious, even though I was short on bacon. I only had 4 thin slices in my freezer, so I cut up a breakfast sausage to go with it. It's easy to make and really tasty.

Insanely delicious. I made this twice (once to try on my in laws who all hate Brussel sprouts (they didn't try them but they were so good!) then I made them again the following weekend for 22 of my favourite relatives. Many of them asked for the recipe (which I followed to a tee, except you know, quadrupled) 

I will definitely make these again whenever I'm in the mood for sprouts.

I made it tonite, I thought there was too much bacon, but my husband says there is never enough bacon, but he liked it. He says it's a keeper. I used  unsalted butter, so there was little flavor from that addition next time I'll use salted, and there will be a next time.

I'll bet real bacon would make it even tastier, but even when made with bacon pieces, it was delicious!  The balsamic vinegar really adds a yummy, tangy flavor.

I now love Brussels sprouts.  I did change it up a bit.  After making the bacon I drained the majority of the grease out of the pan.  I put the cut in half sprouts face down in the pan and browned them at medium heat adding the garlic at the end.  I deglazed the pan with the broth.  I also added a couple dashes of Worcestershire at the end to give it a little zing.

I was amazed that my three grandchildren LOVED these brussel sprouts and wanted more.  They were delicious, and I'll definitely make them again!

Tried this tonight...cooked it exactly as the recipe called for it except I used 6 pieces of thin cut bacon as that is what was on hand. It was fabulous and had my 13-year-old who didn't want to even try it coming back for seconds. Next time I'll cook my bacon a bit longer, but boy that was good!

Made for the second time. Just a sophisticated yet easy recipe. Lots of different flavors, even though the ingredient list is small. Very good. I made 0 changes to this great recipe.

I never liked Brussel sprouts until I tried this recipe.  Frying in the bacon grease and balsamic vinegar make all the difference.  And so easy.  I'll add a shallot with the garlic when I have one.

This was a good recipe. I didn't follow it exactly, I didn't have chicken stock, so I used about 2 T olive oil instead. I think they turned out great and I will be making them again.

These were quite possibly the best brussels sprouts I've ever made. Almost as good as, if not equal to, restaurant quality. I followed the recipe exactly except I added thin slices of onion. Soooo good!!

I made this recipe exactly as written and thought it was excellent!  It's pretty easy, fast and tastes wonderful!  My husband also loved it.  Both of my little boys liked it too, though one said it tasted a bit funny (probably from the balsamic) but they cleaned it from their plates.  Thank you for a great recipe!!

Great recipe! Super quick, easy. Instead of balsamic vinegar, I used sherry vinegar which really complimented the brussels sprouts. Everyone at Thanksgiving loved them!

These are soooo good!  I tasted them before putting the butter & balsamic vinegar in & they were super good like that too.  I used a giant clove of elephant garlic & diced it into slightly bigger pieces & it was the most delicious garlic I've ever had.  The brussels sprouts didn't come out bitter at all.  From someone who grew up hating all vegetables, believe me when I say you HAVE to tr these, they're delicious!

We used low fat turkey bacon, plus a little extra butter plus brown sugar.  Amazing! better than any $12 brussel sprouts that I've purchased at a restaurant.

Followed the recipe, maybe added more garlic.  Huge winner at Xmas dinner last year.  It'll be on the menu again this holiday season.  Honestly though it's a year round thing.

These turned out excellent.  Even the fussy eater in the house liked them 

A great change from corn, peas,  carrots and the rest of the usual veggies.

Delicious! Followed the recipe as written, only added a little fresh onion to the sauté. Will enjoy this recipe again for sure. Thank you Kyle :)

This is a good recipe. I passed on the bacon because I dident have any but it was still good.  I think it would be even better with the bacon. Will try again!

I added mushrooms and more bacon. Might add some dark red wine next time rather than the balsamic. Nice side dish for any protein.

Thought this was a great easy recipe and the balsamic vinaigrette really makes the flavors pop!  Maybe add some chili flakes for some kick next time.

We really liked this haven't had them for years; the only thing I did different was to add just a little chilli flake for some heat.  we will be making these again and again!  Thank you for the recipe.

I made these for Easter this year and even the kids couldn't get enough of them!  Great flavor, easy to make, just the right texture.  These will be a staple in my house.

I received a simpler version of this recipe a few years back, found this and customized it based on the rest of the meal. I used 1lb. of bacon (hardwood smoked) cut into 1in. pieces. A 2lb. bag of brussel  sprouts cut in half. 1 whole clove of garlic. 3tbs. of butter. Pepper to taste. I cooked the bacon until crispy and then scooped it out of the grease. Cooked the halved sprouts in the bacon fat until slightly brown. Added the garlic sliced thinly to the sprouts and continued to cook until you could smell the garlic. Added the bacon back in the pan with the sprouts, garlic and butter- this makes all the flavors cream together well. I made a bound and preseasoned (Italian) pork roast in a Crock Pot. I pulled that out, let it rest for 10 minutes, sliced the binding and cut 3/4 in slices which fell apart! I laid the pieces of roast on top of the cooked sprouts in the pan I cooked in. It was simple and was served in a rustic fashion. Everyone raved! So, thanks to the cook that submitted this recipe- you helped me with the foundation of a wonderful meal!

Awesome recipe!  I made it almost exactly as listed except I used a little more garlic, skipped the butter and sprinkled them lightly with the balsamic vinegar.  Hubby gave them a thumbs up and he hates brussel sprouts!

To keep this easy I use the real bacon bacon bits rather than having to go though the effort of cooking the bacon.
