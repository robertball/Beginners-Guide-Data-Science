My husband and I loved this recipe, the problem we usually have is that I really like eggplant and he's not crazy about it.  I decided to try this out since their were so many ingredients, at way the eggplant would not have to be center stage.  He says it's a definite keeper, all,I changed was adding more spices to the sauce and the meat, and I omitted the ketchup.  Thanks for a new eggplants recipe!

I would make again.  Although I did not use ketchup or diced tomatoes and just used my left over meat spaghetti sauce from another meal.

My husband made this for us and we loved it.  You don't even miss the pasta!  We had fresh spinach so he used that instead of frozen.  He also added a small can of mushrooms.  He left out the ketchup. This is the first time I have ever gone back for seconds on lasagna.

2013 Update: Skipped the ketchup and doubled the spinach and parmesan. It was a hit.

Seems like a lot of work, but oh so worth it. It was a hit. I used turkey meat instead of beef. And cottage cheese instead of ricotta. I kept the ketchup really didn't notice it.

Made for friends on several occasions. Used recipe as written with few minor tweaks (usually just more of these ingredients we like, and Italian sausage instead of ground beef). Virtually everyone has loved this dish and several requests for recipe. This has become one of my go to recipes for company especially if we are looking to lower carbs. Personally I love it and will never use pasta again.

Eggplant instead of pasta –then adding spinach in the ricotta – what a way to eat your vegetables! This photo is the second day - microwave heated, tasted better with age. I'd heard about using eggplant instead of pasta to 'enhance' health component and shave a few calories. What a great deal eggplant turns out to be - this summer I'm growing a couple of eggplants in our garden after using eggplant on this! I did 'mostly' this recipe, it was a great hit. Reading review I passed on the ketchup. The leftovers were even better than the first day - and the second day it held together – totally.  This is wonderful- so good. :)

My husband can't have pasta so we tried this. It was one of the best I've ever had, with or without pasta.

I loosely followed the recipe because I was using up some items in the fridge.  I used some baby spinach instead of frozen, provolone instead of feta, and sausage instead of ground beef.  Also, I prefer fried eggplant instead of baked which is what I did.  I omitted the ketchup and diced tomatoes because my sauce was chunky.  So, despite my changes, this came out beautifully.
