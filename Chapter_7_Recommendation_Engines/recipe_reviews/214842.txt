I made this last night and just finished off the leftovers for lunch.  It was delicious!  My mom used to make a much simpler, much more Americanized version of "weenies and kraut" when I was a kid using hotdogs and without any seasoning besides pepper.  While I did enjoy it as a kid, I was looking for a bit more sophisticated recipe to try.  This hit the spot perfectly.  I made it exactly as the recipe calls except I subbed a little dill and cumin seed for the caraway.  I'm not a big fan of the licorice flavor spices (anise, fennel seed, etc) so I did a search for possible substitutions for the caraway.  I found dill and cumin suggested as somewhat similar in flavor, so I used half a teaspoon of each. I did have to cook it a little longer than 10 minutes before the kraut started to brown a bit.  This makes 4 very large portions and could easily feed six people with a side.  I served it with some hot german potato salad and the combination was great.

Okay, I got my hands on some homemade Farmers Sausage that a good friend of mine got the recipe for and made. I had been dying to try it after he told me all about it and I never thought I would but he came through for me. I LOVED it and I really enjoyed this recipe. I have never seen celery flakes around here so I just diced up some celery AND I did cut the brown sugar in half but that is only due to personal preference because I do not like sweet and like the sour bite the kraut gives. This recipe was super easy and super good if you like the kraut. Thanks for sharing!

Other than changing the ratio of meat to sauerkraut, we followed this recipe fairly closely. Used fresh onion instead of dried and celery seed instead of the flakes. Turned out great! Even I liked it and I don't like sauerkraut very much.

I added an apple, used celery seed (what I had on hand) and kielbasa. It was quick and easy and quite tasty. I also used only 24 oz of sauerkraut and it made plenty!!
