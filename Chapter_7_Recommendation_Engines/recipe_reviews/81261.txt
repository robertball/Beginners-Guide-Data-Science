I didn't make your recipie, but I know what it is. In Korean, it's called "pu-ching-geh." It's not pizza as we know it, think of it more like a healthy pancake. My mom adds some hot pepper paste to the mixture to give it a kick. It's mainly made as a snack and for gatherings. It's as popular as serving chips at a party. You don't have to add all those ingredients mentioned. Might be too much. Make what you'd like. I recommend carrots, cucumbers, and bean sprouts. (slice carrot and cucumber really thin, like spaghetti 2 inches in length) To make sure the middle is cooked, push the middle with the back of your spatula to flatten it out.

I grew up calling it Korean pancake but its technical name is bin-dae-dok (that's probably not how its spelled).  This is a very complicated recipe with a lot of different ingredients; the frozen veggies and cabbage (use napa cabbage) threw me off.  Overall not what I'm used to, but it didn't miss the point either.  I would omit the mixed veggies,  use angel hair shredded cabbage and increase the green onions by 4 or 5.

Loved this! I used red onion insterad of shallot, and instead of crab and tofu, added cooked chicken. I used crushed red pepper flakes in the dipped sauce. I made these in a small omelette pan since I knew anything larger would get trashed by my flipping skills. I made one, then popped it in a warm oven while I made the rest

Maybe it was because i made some substitutions, but this just didn't come out good at all.  The pancake fried up nice and golden brown on the first side, but the second side had trouble cooking.  once I got it cooked, the middle was all goey.  I don't know what went wrong.  It just wasn't good at all.

Yum! I added some chopped up kim chee in and it was really great
As for the runnyness, I just made sure it was spread out and turned the heat lower and cooked it longer...viola! By the third one it was perfect.

They were still doughy around the veggies. Cooking time way too long for the outcome.
