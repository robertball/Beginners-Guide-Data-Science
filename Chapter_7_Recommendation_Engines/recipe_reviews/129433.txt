This was very good!  The only thing I did different was that I was running low on green pepper and subbed in some yellow and orange pepper instead, and I used venison stew chunks cooked on high for about 5 hours.  Grandsons liked this, and it is a little on the sweet side, so I recommend serving with something like corn bread and cole slaw... it's just a little rich on it's own.  I'm sure I will make this again, and it makes a LOT!

We really liked this!  I did not add all of the cans of beans since I was only cooking for four people.  I also omitted the molasses (I forgot to buy it) and didn't miss it.  I served it over cornbread with shredded cheddar cheese on top!  DELICIOUS!  Could not tell it was venison.

My husband, who isn't that crazy about venison, LOVED this and ate about 5 servings! It was very good!  I followed the recipe exactly, except for adding some garlic powder.  I was a little nervous about the brown sugar and molasses making it too sweet, but it tasted fine.  Might try cutting them both in half next time to see if it is still as good with half the sweeteners.

The only substitution I made was to use Elk Steak instead of Venison. It was Amazing! My whole family loved it! The only thing I noticed was I had to cook it about 15 minutes longer than the recipe recommended to crisp the bacon.

We enjoyed this recipe.  I made it as a meal but I think it is more suited as  a hearty side dish than a meal.

This dish was delicious! It is packed with flavor.  It makes a whole lot, so be ready for left-overs.  It would probably freeze well though.  I made it with a moose roast and it tasted great.  Next time I will probaby use half of the broth; it seemed excessive to have that much liquid. After baking it turned out a little more runny than expected, but still tasted yummy.  It would be really good served over cornbread.
