Lambshanks came out  amazingly well! Meat was so tender, juicy and falling off the bone - really melted in your mouth! Flavor was great - usually use red wine to make lamb shanks but white wine was delicious. Followed recipe exactly but omitted the olive oil when browning the lamb shank. The fat from the shanks browned themselves and then I drained most of the excess oil. Great recipe - thanks!

Absolutely melt in the mouth tender. I seared mine in the pan initially and then cooked it in my slow cooker with the liquid made as described.

Simply gorgeous, they just dissolved in your mouth. I served them with roast potatoes and vegies. I poured some of the juices over the vegies at the end. Compliments all around from everyone. I was enjoying them so much I didn't want my plate to become empty. I will most definitely be cooking them again and I made no changes to the recipe.

November 2006.  Followed recipe as given, which is a switch for me.  The white wine made for a different pairing with lamb, but quite delicious.  Served with pasta with greens and olives, sauteed mushrooms, and a simple salad.  Much enjoyed by all!!

Very tasty!! My husband was drooling when he walked through the door.  I couldn't let the wine "gravy" go to waste so I thickened it with a little flour, so I could pour some over the lamb when I served it.

I stumbled on this recipe because I bought lamb shanks but had no idea how to cook them.  Rosemary is one of my favorite herbs so this recipe caught my eye.  The combination of Rosemary and lamb was perfect.

I make lamb shanks all the time, and this was a different "take" on one of our favorite meals.  I actually put them in a crockpot with a little less wine to start.  They came out beautifully moist and the meat fell off the bones.  A real winner.

I really enjoyed making this recipe. i did, however, alter it a bit by using red wine instead of white, that gave it a richer flavor. My husband is still talking about how good it was!!

Yes; this is good. I didn't have the time it would take to prepare it according to the recipe, so I browned the lamb shanks, loaded the ingredients into a pressure cooker, and let her go for 45 minutes, letting the pressure drop of its own accord. It was really tasty! I would make it again, and probably use the pressure cooker againn, too.

This sauce does nothing to enhance the lamb flavor.  In fact, the lamb completely overpowers it.  The sauce would be good with lighter-flavored protein (such as fish or chicken), but just doesn't stand up well to lamb.  I was totally disappointed!

I have tried this with shanks and lamb steaks as well, and it came out wonderfully every time.  It's also very good with sherry instead of white wine.  Even the kids liked it!  Very flavorful, easy, and totally worth the effort.  Don't be afraid of the rosemary--it takes this much, and it's amazing.

excellent.  best part was I could make it a day ahead and reheat on Easter. For gravy, I put the cooking liquid in the blender and made a gravy with that.

Tried this for the first time and was very impressed. The meat was tender and juicy. I will say that the shank part of the lamb is a bit more fatty and dark...so beware if you do not like this type of meat. Fantastic flavors and was super easy. I used chardonnay with a splash of chicken stock. Added a bit of corn strach mixed with the pan juices to thicken at the end. Served with oven roasted potatoes and peas. Will make this again  and would serve to company ( if I know they like lamb).

This recipe resulted in a luxuriously rich dinner that is guest-worthy. I made exactly per directions in my deep cast iron skillet and served with steamed broccoli and wild rice. This is one I will look forward to making again!

Well that was easy! Five stars just for the convenience. The flavor was great, too, so this will stay in the recipe box. Near the end of the cooking time, I threw some asparagus and carrots into the oven to roast and heated up some leftover potatoes for a very easy dinner. I took others' suggestion to make gravy by whisking in some flour with the liquid after the meat was plated.  Tasted great with the veggies.

I did not care for this. I thought it was strange to make lamb with white wine, and might try it with a red, if I venture to try this again.

I gave three stars because even though I didn't enjoy this particular recipe, those I cooked for did.  I found it terribly bland, almost as if the white wine soaked out any possibility of flavor which is hard since rosemary tends to be a strong ingredient by itself and usually then only more potent as other herbs/spices are added.  Now my guests loved it, it was a nice alternative to the usual mint jelly.  They found the recipe to be a great tenderizer for the lamb and mighty tasty.  I guess you either love this or hate it.

This recipe was awesome and pretty low maintenance. The only change I made was to salt and pepper it a little before searing. Poured the remaining sauce over the meat and some roasted potatoes and it was brilliant.

This was excellent!  I had some goat shanks in the freezer so I used them instead of lamb.  I browned them with the onions and garlic as directed but then transferred it to my crock pot.  Added the rest of the ingredients and let it slow cook for about 4-5 hours.  I added several cups of wine so it wouldn't dry out during cooking. It was heavenly!  Next time I will add some small potatoes and baby carrots to the pot for an all in one meal.

Great recipe, followed recipe exactly and was very pleased with the results.  It was my first time cooking lamb, and husband has requested that I add this to our rotation.  All three of my kids (3,5,7) also ate every bite!

I was very impressed with the results although I tweeked it a little bit.  Altogether the meat was so tender & moist inside.  My children loved the gravy.  I made a rice dish to suck the gravy up and the results were fantastic..

This was a wonderful dish for a dinner party as you can prepare everything in advance and then let it cook whilst you enjoy a cocktail or two with your guests. I baked mine in the oven at 180 degrees centigrade for 2 hours.

This recipe was easy and taste awesome!  I used Sherry in place of the wine and addes some petite red potatoes during the last 45 minutes they simmered...  After it was done I took out the meat and potatoes and thickened the sauce.  YUM!

Like another reviewer, I too bought lamb shanks and didn't know what to do with them.  :)  Always up for trying new things!  I followed the recipe exactly, and even my husband (who hates anything "fancy") enjoyed it.  WONDERFUL

I reduced the recipe for two people. It was easy to prepare and delicious to eat.

I love lamb shanks when I go out to eat, so I thought I would try them at home. I used this recipe except I used red wine (I go with the red for red meat rule), and while the sauce was yum the lamb wasn't fall apart tender like I expected. While cooking it I was thinking it needed to be in more liquid, and thought it would also be easier braising in the oven. I am no expert at cooking lamb shanks though so I don't know. Still rated 3* as I still ate the results, but will try another recipe next time or leave this to being a restaurant meal.

Our family and guests really enjoyed this recipe, it was delicious, I made them in the slow cooker then  thickened the gravy and served it on mashed potatoes. On the side we had roasted asparagus and a green salad. My 91 year old mother-in-law ate the whole shank and everything that went with it.

Not bad, but very bland and over cooked. Two hours is way too long unless you want it well done. It’s an easy prep and you probably have everything needed which is nice. I’ll try it again but cook it for shorter.

Only change was using a crock pot on high for that last 3 hours.  Very tasty & easy.  My guy was about to pour sauce on it but after I told him to try it first (sheesh) he was very pleased with it as is.  Passes the hungry-carnivore  test :)

Good, but not great.  I would definitely double the seasoning and add a lot more salt and pepper.

I made this with only one lamb shank but only halved the sauce ingredients using my cast iron skillet.  It was fantastic!

This was fantastic and the recipe was so concise, it was a breeze to make.  A perfect dish for a chilly night.  The meat just melted off the bone!

Braised lamb shanks are one of my favorite meals and I was drawn to this recipe because it was so simple. But it was so bland and I ugly.  But I was able to save it by adding some hearty vegetable broth, a couple cinnamon sticks and some tomatoes.
